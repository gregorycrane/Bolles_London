<div1 type="preface" n="0"><head>PREFACE</>
<p>

WHILE making the drawings and collecting notes
for this work, I tried to choose the subjects
which would be of most interest to the greatest
number of people.
<p>In an area so crowded as the City of London is with
associations-historic, religious, literary, and personal-everything could not be illustrated. Interesting, historically or as
types, the subjects must be; if they had any element of the
picturesque besides, I tried to retain it; working much in
the early morning, when the City wears its fairest looks,
before the tide of bustling humanity has filled every street
and alley.
<p>In the beginning, my explorations led me into many
backwaters, and I wished for a guide to lead me through
the maze; erratic excursions made policemen regard me with
looks of doubt; but the maze became familiar in time, and
constables became interested friends, whose cheerful philosophy lightened many trying hours; my thanks are due to
them, and to the citizens, for their unfailing courtesy during
the years of my pilgrimage.
<p>Probably there are still some corners, containing interesting specimens of domestic architecture, which I have missed;
<pb n="v" id="p.v">

there cannot be many of these. The perpetual rebuilding
which goes on discovers a little, but in the main tends to
obliterate the older fragments of the City still surviving; a
tablet marking the site is a poor substitute for the weathered
stones that have been pulled down, but it is all that these
modern times have to offer.
<p>The City becomes more and more a collection of office
buildings, and drifts steadily away from that type of little
dwellings where the older citizens lived, and loved, and suffered, beside the churches which they built and thought to
rest in when their work was done; but it is these fragments
that to their descendants at home and beyond the seas still
make London a land of dreams, and, more than any other,
a city of shrines-a place of memories.




<div1 type="body">
<p>  <pb n="1" id="p.1">
ALL the buildings figured in these drawings were standing
when the twentieth century began its course; but, in
the few years that have passed since then, a considerable
number of them have been pulled down or altered,
and it is probable that before many years have gone few of
them will survive.
<p>The London for which elderly dwellers within its gates
cherished so strong an affection will be replaced by a town of
wider streets and buildings of more elaborate design, but entirely
without that garland of human interest which appealed to them
so strongly; the undefined sense of possession which they had
in these old buildings, surviving amidst the stress of changing
conditions, was one of the few links binding them all together.
When these cease to exist, London will be the poorer.
Many of these buildings were not in any sense picturesque,
except from the dignity imparted to them by the passage of years
and association with men of bygone generations, but they were
examples of ocular history.
<p>If the Londoners of the seventeenth century, with their
town recently devastated by fire, had wealth enough, and civic
courage sufficient, to rebuild their churches, surely the men of
the present day ought to be able to preserve them; yet thirteen
of Wren's churches have gone, and these not the least interesting,
while several others are threatened. If these churches, which are

<pb n="2" id="p.2">




so great an ornament, and have played so great a part in the
history of the town, are easily sacrificed, there is little hope
that any private dwelling will survive. Our history will then be
on the printed page, or in the pillule form of the encaustic tablet,
briefly marking where something of interest stood.
When it is all done, and the last old house swept away, what
a wilderness of houses will the modern London be! To many
of the old houses surviving we can assign no tenants; or there are
names of humble citizens, no more famous than those
"Who bind the sheaf, who build the house,
Who dig the grave,"

that by some little twist of circumstances remain for all time. Such
a man as Farmer Goodman, whose name survives in <placename>Goodman's
Fields</>, and whom we are able to identify because <persname key="Stow, John">John Stow</>
gives us the measure of the milk supplied to him as a little boy.
"Never less than three pints in summer and a quart in winter,
for one halfpenny."
<p>Farmer Goodman rests from his labours in the little church
of <placename>St. Botolph</>, near the <placename>Minories</>, and his fields are covered with
squalid houses.
<p>This church, a very plain building, rebuilt about <date value=1706>1706</date>, in
place of the older church belonging to the Priory of the Holy
Trinity, contains the ashes of a few persons of distinction, including <persname>Lord Cobham</>, the chief accuser of <persname>Raleigh</> in his last
troubles, and a head, contained in a box, said to be that of the
father of <persname><rolename>Lady</> Jane Grey</persname>. When Stow wrote, <placename>Hog Lane</> (the
<placename>Petticoat Lane</> of later days) had rows of elms on either side, with
bridges and stiles, to pass over the town ditch into the pleasant fields


<pb n="3" id="p.3">

beyond. What is now <placename key="Royal Mint Street">Royal Mint Street</placename> was, in the time of
<persname key="Charles I">Charles I</>., a suburban street, bearing the name of <placename key="Rosemary Lane">Rosemary Lane</>,
where "Brandon," the executioner of that monarch, had his ragstore. In Restoration days <persname>Pepys</> tells us of little excursions with
his wife to gather cowslips in the adjacent fields, or by coach to
<placename>Bednall Green</> to <persname>Sir W. Rider's</> to dinner; "a fine, merry walk
with the ladies alone after dinner, in the garden; the greatest
quantity of strawberries I ever saw, and good ;" in Mr. Pett's garden,
adjoining his own on Tower Hill, where "I eat some of the first
cherries I have eat this year, off the tree where the King himself
had been gathering some this morning." But what London before
the fire really was like, we can now only form a vague idea.
From many chroniclers we learn of its narrow streets of
timber houses, its evil smells, its curious mixture of squalor and
opulence, with the plague always looming near in the background.
Covering no large space, the population must have been very dense.
The great market for England, whose freemen went toll and
tithe free throughout the realm, its streets perpetually thronged
with the coming and going of men from many lands; but of their
domestic life we can only guess from illuminated manuscripts, and
fragments here and there which we may or may not interpret
correctly.
<p>From the time that men began to roam the world for purposes of trade, houses of entertainment became a necessity, and
there is no reason to doubt that many of the inns and taverns of
London have existed under various names and conditions on the
same spot, from the dawn of our history; the buildings decayed,
and were rebuilt. The names changed with the ups and downs of
the ruling powers, but the taverner's trade went on continuously.



<pb n="4" id="p.4">
<p>In the vicinity of a religious house the signs were often of a
semi-pious description, but generally could also have a satirical
meaning read into them, much in the same way as holy things were
treated in miracle plays. Near every church there was a tavern,
and in some cases this was church property. An instance of this
still exists at Harmondsworth, Middlesex.

<div1 type="entry" n="1"><head>ALL HALLOWS STEYNING, STAR ALLEY</>
<p>It is probable that when houses first began to cover the
marsh surrounding the spring head of the Langbourne-Culver
Alley marks the site-the first buildings of any importance
were the Saxon church of All Hallows Steyning and the tavern
which we know as the London Tavern, backing on to the churchyard. They would then be the outposts of the city within the
wa1l, so that this would be the Fenchurch which in course of
time gave its name to the street. Whether it received the affix
of "Steyning" from being the only stone-built church at the
time is a little doubtful. The name occurs in at least one
other church, near Aldermasnbury, and it is possible that here, as
elsewhere, it records the name of the pious donor; but it is of
little consequence. The first definite mention of it is made
in <date value="1329">1329</date>, but we know that twenty-four years earlier, when
William Wallace was brought to London for trial at Westminster
Hall, and execution at Smithfield, he was at first lodged in a
tavern in Fenchurch Street, and in all probability it was this
tavern. At a later date it bore the name of the King's Head.
It changed with the times; renovated and rebuilt, it became the
"London Tavern." As houses began to be built around the
church, the passage way which we know as " Star Alley " was

<pb n="5" id="p.5">


made to provide entrances to that building from east and north;
and it is quite possible that it perpetuates one of the names
which the tavern has borne. This church was the scene of the
thanksgiving service attended by the Princess Elizabeth on her
release from the Tower, where she had been confined on suspicion
of complicity in Wyatt's rebellion. As the legend goes, she
dined afterwards at the King's Head on pork and peas. This
story leaves us marvelling at the good appetite retained by
Elizabeth after her unpleasant experience. But, by her generosity at this service, we may measure somewhat of the thankfulness that filled that parsimonious lady on her release. At the
conclusion of the service here, she gave such a handsome gratuity
to the parish clerk that he straightway took all his neighbours
home to dine with him on a leg of pork and peas; even then
his thankfulness was not exhausted, and he made it an annual
feast until his death, after which some of the residents changed
the date to November 17, and made it a parish feast in honour
of Elizabeth's accession. This later feast was celebrated in the
tavern mentioned, and the staple dishes were always legs of pork
with peas. The popular story was doubtless conjured backwards
out of this feast.
<p>During the Great Fire the church was saved from destruction
by the efforts of Samuel Pepys and the seamen whom he brought
into the city; and it is noted as one of the four churches in
London where the " Declaration of Indulgence " by James II. was
read. After that it became neglected, so that all but the tower fell
down in <date value="1764">1764</date>. In <date value="1870">1870</date> the site was purchased by the Cloth-workers' Company, a part of the churchyard laid out as a garden,
"to be unbuilt for ever," the tower repaired, and left standing.




<pb n="6" id="p.6">
Offices were erected on the site of the church and yard, and
from the price obtained, three churches were to be built in the
suburbs-All Hallows, Bromley-by-Bow, and St. Anthony's,
Stepney, being two of them.
<p>The parish was joined to St. Olave's, and some of the monuments were re-erected in that church. The old tower stands
somewhat forlorn in one of the many little patches of churchyard in the city; some have flowers and trees, others only the
straggling grass and mouldered gravestones. The graves of forgotten citizens-how many generations of them, great and small,
just and unjust, and all forgotten! No dead in the world-not
those in the sea-are so lonely as these, amid the bustle of living
men and the busy traffic of the streets to-day.

<div1 type="entry" n="2"><head>ST. OLAVE'S, SEETHING LANE</>
<p>The church of St. Olave's, at the upper end of Seething Lane,
is one of several churches of London dedicated to King Olaf of
Norway, who might be cited as showing the strange material out
of which many of the medieval saints were made; but why he
was so popular in London is something of a mystery. He wasted
great parts of this island, and his only method of uprooting
paganism was by fire and sword, which were both so much used
on his unfortunate subjects that they arose and chased him out
of Norway on two occasions; but "fire and sword and desolation"
continued his ideal of a " thorough godly reformation." And it
was not until after he had been slain in battle by his own subjects
that he began to work miracles, and was carefully removed to
Trondjem Cathedral to become the patron saint of Norway.


<pb n="7" id="p.7">

<p>This church contains the ashes of the man from whose diary
we first obtain really vivid glimpses of the life of the people; that
diary is certainly the most entertaining book in the world, and
the personality of the writer has provided material for a whole
library of learned works. "Our own" church, as it figures on
his pages, was close by the old Navy Office, and is still to some
considerable extent associated with the sea, though that Navy
Office has long gone. It is the official church for Trinity
House, on Tower Hill. Much "restored," its brick tower and
weather-worn walls overlook a little graveyard, the gateway of
which to Seething Lane has an extraordinary decoration of skulls
in high relief. The church dates from the middle of the fifteenth
century on an older foundation; the crown over the vane is in
commemoration of the service attended by Princess Elizabeth on
her release from the Tower. This crown must have been removed to St. Olave's from All Hallows Steyning. <p>There are
some fine sword-rests in the church, and the pulpit-attributed
to Grinling Gibbons-was formerly in St. Benet's, Gracechurch
Street. When that church was pulled down in <date value="1876">1876</date>, this pulpit
was bought by the Elder Brethren of Trinity House, and brought
here. The registers date from <date value="1563">1563</date>, and record the baptism of
a daughter of Sir Philip Sidney in 1585, and of Robert Devereux,
son of the Earl of Essex, in <date value="1590">1590</date>. The parents of Joseph
Chamberlain were married here on <date value="1835-03-26">March 26, 1835</date>. One of
the Penn family (George), Samuel Pepys, his brother Tom, and
his much-tried wife, are buried in the church. It is also associated with Horatio Nelson, who as a youth lived with his uncle,
Captain Maurice Suckling, at the Navy Office.
Samuel Pepys is buried "in the vault by ye communion


<pb n="8" id="p.8">

table." A few years ago a memorial was erected to him. The
Navy Office stood on the east side of St. Olave's; the ground is
now occupied by warehouses. It was from his house here that
Pepys went about his business, with dread and yet with wonderful
courage, while the "great plague" did its work. Only for a very
short time did he leave the district; and after his return he
watched the fire that followed, consuming the city; manfully
taking his part in trying to stem it; writing scornfully in his
diary of the helpless and supine attitude of some officials who did
little save look on and wring their hands.
In the surrounding streets there is little left of olden days
except the names. Mincing Lane took its title from some tenements of houses there which belonged to the "Minchuns" or
nuns of Great St. Helen's.
<p>At the north-east corner of Mark Lane a space, latterly known
as Blind Chapel Court, sometimes corrupted into Blanche
Appleton, was set apart by Edward IV. for basket-makers, wire-drawers, and other foreigners to have their shops. The name
suggests that basket-making was a favoured employment for blind
men in those days, even as now.
Sir Thomas Wyatt, the father of the more celebrated son
whose name is attached to a foolish rebellion, had a house in
Crutched Friars; and in that street, until the middle of the nineteenth century, there stood a very elaborate house, with carved
standards and beams, popularly believed to be the house of Sir
Richard Whittington; but no foundation can be gathered for
the belief.
<p>"In <date value="1512">1512</date>, Sir John Milborne, to his great praise and commendation, builded in London, beside the Crossed Friars, thirteen




<pb n="9" id="p.9">

alms-houses for thirteen poor men; and giveth them, the first
day of every month, two shillings and five pence in money.
It was directed that these alms-men should be sober, and of
honest conversation; not detectedin any open crime. And after
admission, they should be resident and abiding upon the same,
and not keep any common selling of ale, beer, or wine, or anything concerning tippling, &amp;c., with an obligation that the said
alms-men should daily come into the church of the Crossed
Friars, place themselves near the tomb of the founder, and abide
and continue there till the service be ended."


<div1 type="entry" n="3"><head>TRINITY HOUSE, TOWER HILL</><p>

Fittingly placed within sight and sound of the river, as if
watching over, yet not entering into the busy traffic, Trinity House
is of respectable antiquity, the present building being erected in
<date value="1793">1793</date> from designs by Mr. Samuel Wyatt. The Corporation of
the Elder Brethren of the Holy and Undivided Trinity was
founded under that name at Deptford in <date value="1518">1518</date>, by Sir Thomas
Spert, Knight. Incorporated by Henry VIII., its privileges were
confirmed in <date value="1658">1658</date>. In <date value="1680">1680</date> the Corporation erected its first
lighthouse, all previous lighthouses having been built by private
enterprise or charity, and in most cases charging dues from
mariners benefiting from them. In <date value="1854">1854</date> all private light dues
were abolished, and the exclusive right of lighting and buoying
the coast was given to the Board of Trinity House. They
appoint and license pilots for the English coast, the Cinque
Port pilots also passing under their jurisdiction at the same time.
<pb n="10" id="p.10">



The same Act also gave them a general supervision over the Commissioners of Northern Lights and the Ballast Board of Dublin.
It was formerly the practice to distribute the surplus monies
from light and pilotage dues and the sale of ballast to charitable
purposes, but this was also done away with in <date value="1854">1854</date>, and the
surplus income devoted to the extinction of the debt incurred by
the purchase of private rights in lighthouses.
<p>The Corporation consists of a Master (usually the Prince
of Wales), Deputy Master, nineteen acting Elder Brethren, eleven
honorary Elder Brethren, and an unlimited number of Younger
Brethren, who all belong to the sea services; two Elder Brethren
assist the Court of Admiralty as assessors, by advice only.
The founder, Sir Thomas Spert, was a seaman of mark in the
time of Henry VIII., commander of the Henry Grace de Dieu,
better known as the Great Harry, the greatest ship known at
that time. He and his three wives were buried in Stepney
Church.
<p>Trinity House appears continually in the pages of Pepys;
on the <date value="1662-07-15">15th February 1662</date>, he was sworn a Younger Brother.
He pervaded Tower Hill even more than any other district in
London, going about his work and seeing all the sights, in a
cheerful, indefatigable way. "To Aldgate," he says, "and at the
corner shop, a draper's, I stood and did see Barkestead, Okey,
and Corbet drawn towards the gallows at Tyburn, and there they
were hanged and quartered. They all looked very cheerful." A
few weeks later, "About eleven o'clock, having a room got ready
for us, we all went out to Tower Hill, and there over against the
scaffold made on purpose this day, saw Sir Harry Vane brought;
a very great press of people. . . The scaffold was so crowded

<pb n="11" id="p.11">


(with onlookers) that we could not see it done." He afterwards
learned the particulars from Boreham, a friend who had been on
the scaffold. "So to the office a little, and to Trinity House,
and there all of us to dinner."
<p>The place of the Russian trading house is still marked by
the name of Muscovy Court (through which there was a back
entrance to the old Navy Office); but the topography of the
district has been much changed by street alterations and the
making of railways.
<p>Round Tower Hill there are still a good many houses of the
early eighteenth century with the characteristic doorways and
porticoes of that period; these doorways have a pleasant old-
world look, and the designers of that period seem to have had
some secret by which the panels and mouldings retain their
contours and sharpness after generations of house painters have
worked their will on them. There is a large fragment of the
city wall in good preservation to be seen in a court just west of
the Minories. Another part was recently exposed when digging
for foundations in America Square.

<div1 type="entry" n="4"><head>TRINITY SQUARE</>
<p>The pleasant garden known as Trinity Square, with nurses,
and children at play, seems nowadays to have little kinship
with the dreaded place of execution, where for centuries so
many went to their doom. The noise of the streets and sounds
from the traffic on the river blend faintly together, and there
are pleasant and unexpected glimpses of the Tower.
"Ye towers of Julius, London's lasting shame,
With many a foul and midnight murder fed."


<pb n="12" id="p.12">

There are fine trees, an aviary, and a stretch of greensward;
something of an enchanted garden, too, for all may not enter
there. It is reserved for the residents and the children of the
Tower. And if you ask one of these little personages at play,
"Where do you live, my dear ?" the answer will probably be,
"In the Tower, sir;" for the Yeoman of the Guard, so well
known to us in light opera, is a family man, and probably always
has been so, though it may strike us as a strange thing that
children should be born and have their home in that grim
fortress.
<p>It is with something of surprise that at the western corner of
this garden you find the paved space, with a stone marking the
place of the block, engraved with two names only. Common
malefactors and others of high degree were executed all over
London, but this space was more particularly reserved for
treason executions. Persons of royal blood, and a few others,
were executed inside the Tower. The persons who suffered
here were handed over to the Sheriffs of London at a point
about half-way between this and the present gate to the Tower;
and for centuries, but especially during the reign of Henry VIII.,
the place must have reeked of blood; nobles, commoners,
citizens, priests, and 'prentices were executed singly or in
batches, in an endless stream. In an ordinary way these scenes
were regarded by the citizens merely as part of the diversions
of their daily lives, but occasionally they seemed somewhat
oppressed by fear and foreboding, as at the execution of Protector Somerset. This, Grafton describes as an eye-witness.
"The 22nd day of January, Edward, Duke of Somerset,
the king's uncle, was brought out of the Tower, and

<pb n="13" id="p.13">



delivered to the Sheriffs of London, and so with a great
company of the Gard, was brought to the scaffold on ye
Tower Hill, and there, first making his prayers on his knees
unto Almighty God, did he require the people to pray for him;
and while he was speaking, ye people suddenly were driven into
a great fear, and few or none of the multitude knew the cause
of that fear. But the matter was this; he was brought to the
scaffold very early, so that a certain hamlet of men, who ordinarily
were appointed to give attendance when any execution is done
out of ye Tower, came now very late. The Duke was on the
scaffold before they came, and they perceiving that, made haste,
and ran in with their halberts, to have come to the scaffold. The
people yt were near them, seeing them come thus running,
thinking they had come to rescue the Duke, cried Away! away!
and some ran one way and some another; they could not tell
whither nor wherefore. Others standing still to see the end,
thought they had some pardon brought; some said it thundered,
some said ye ground shook; but it was nothing so, and in ye
end the aforesaid Duke patiently and in most quiet manner, laid
his head down on the block, where he suffered the cruel stroke
of the axe, executed by a ragged rogue."
<p>This reference of Grafton seems to explain why a certain
district north of the present Mint was known as "Hangman's
Gains," and incidentally shows how numerous the executions
were, that employment was provided for a "certain hamlet of
men" as guards and attendants. This must have still continued
till after the time of Charles I., so that it was no chance employment that drew "Brandon" from Rosemary Lane to execute
that monarch.

<p>This shambles must have had a brutalising effect on the
populace in the ordinary way, and when accompanied by the
added horrors such as attended the execution of Monmouth, it
must have been worse. That Duke, as he laid his head on the
block, warned the executioner not to mangle him as he had
done Lord Russell. The admonition so unnerved the man that
he only inflicted a slight gash, and the sufferer raised himself to
complain; after two more strokes, the man threw down the axe,
swearing that his heart failed him, but was compelled by the
sheriffs to resume his task till the fifth blow severed the head
from the body.
<p>While what can be said of James I., who, bitten probably by
his wife's liking for theatrical displays, arranged, when Markham,
Gray, and Cobham were condemned for treason, to have each
culprit brought forth separately, to say his prayers and lay his head
on the block, then taken back to the Tower, finally bringing all
three out together, to be informed on the scaffold that the King
had graciously granted them their lives. He did not grant them
their liberty, for Gray died in the Tower eleven years after, and
Cobham was not released till <date value="1619">1619</date>.
<p>The Tower itself is as various in its uses as its history.
Julius Caesar had a prison there, and the earliest part of the


<pb n="16" id="p.16">

present building, the chapel, was built either by William the
Conqueror or by Rufus. It is certainly one of the most interesting places in the world. It has been a palace, a prison, a fort,
and all combined; and besides the features of the present day, there
was for centuries a menagerie kept there. In <date value="1436">1436</date> it is noted
as remarkable that "this year all the lions died in the Tower,
which had lived there a long time." The custom of keeping
wild animals there survived until about the middle of the nineteenth century. Another of the most picturesque surviving
features began in <date value="1484">1484</date>, when Henry VII. caused, for the safeguard of his body, a certain number of good archers and of other
persons that were fitting and hardy, to give their daily attendance
on his body, whom he named Yeomen of the Crown.
<p>Of the many distinguished prisoners who have fretted their
lives away in the Tower, perhaps the two who appear most
picturesque are the Princess Elizabeth-who was sent there on
suspicion of complicity in Wyatt's rebellion, a suspicion which
seems quite justified by evidence-and Raleigh. Neither of
them prove very heroic figures. Elizabeth simply went crazy
with fear, and certainly would have died from that cause had she
been kept long in confinement; while Raleigh spent his thirteen
years dabbling in chemistry, in literature, and, doubtless to gain
the favour of James I., compiled his "History of the World,"
in which he was assisted by Ben Jonson and others. Even for
that date it was no great achievement; beginning at the Creation,
it ceases about 150 B.C. It seems to have impressed the young
Prince Henry more than James, as the former said, "No man
but his father would keep such a bird in a cage." Raleigh's
dreams of El Dorado and that land where the common soldier

<pb n="17" id="p.17">

paid himself with plates of gold half a foot broad, and the
temples were filled with golden images, had more effect on the
King, and at length, after a time, Raleigh's last, foolish expedition started. It was doomed to failure from the beginning.
Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, had got copies of the
instructions, and sent them out to his brother, the Governor of
St. Thomas. When the expedition reached there, they landed,
killed the governor, and proceeded on their crazy voyage up the
Orinoco. No El Dorado, and no gold, was found; any such
metal had been as effectually drained out of the country by the
Spaniards, as in more recent times, under another power, rubber
and ivory were drained out of the Congo. Disaster and mutiny
followed, and Raleigh sneaked home, a more unheroic figure
than he went away; and after many evasions, the Tower received him-again. His trial saw him rise in dignity under the
persecution of Sir Edward Coke. Called "a damnable atheist,"
"a spider of hell," and other fine phrases by the lawyer, he
could rebuke him calmly, and as calmly meet the stroke of the
axe in Old Palace Yard.
<p>Another mystery connected with the Tower is of later
date; when, in <date value="1671">1671</date>, Colonel Blood, having ingratiated himself
with the Keeper of the Crown Jewels by proposing a marriage
between his mythical nephew and the keeper's daughter, brought
two friends to view the jewels, and while there, the unfortunate
keeper was knocked down and wounded. Blood took the
crown under his cloak, one companion put the orb in his
breeches, while the other cut the sceptre in pieces and put it in
a bag, and the three had reached the eastern gate towards St.
Katherine's before they were overtaken and arrested. All this


<pb n="18" id="p.18">

was merely serio-comic burglary. The mystery in the matter was,
that after a long trial, Blood was not only pardoned, but was
made a gentleman at court, and received an estate worth l500
a year.
<p>Evelyn says that Blood "had a villainously unmerciful
countenance, but was very well spoken and dangerously insinuating"; but the entire escapade remains a mystery to this day.


<div1 type="entry" n="5"><head>ALL HALLOWS, BARKING, SEETHING LANE</>
<p>The church of All Hallows, Barking, escaped the great fire,
and is, in many ways, one of the most interesting churches in
the city. It was of old in the gift of the Abbess of Barking,
one of the greatest abbeys in England. At the dissolution of
the monasteries, the advowson was given by Henry VIII. to the
Archbishop of Canterbury, subject to the Archdeacon of London.
On the north side, about where is now Mark Lane Station,
was a handsome chapel, founded by Richard I., augmented by
Edward IV., who gave a licence to his cousin, John, Earl of
Worcester, to found a brotherhood. "But most remarkable in
the said chapel was the image of the Glorious Virgin, erected by
Edward I., owing to a vision in his sleep, whereby, if he visited
this five times a year when in England, and kept the chapel in
repair-he was assured in the vision-he would be victorious over
all nations when his father had died, and that he would be the
subduer of the Welsh and all Scotland." The like success was
promised to each succeeding monarch on the same conditions.
For common people there were various benefits, amongst
them being " indulgences" of forty days. So that "Our Lady





<pb n="19" id="p.19">
of Barking" came to be of great repute in the land, and many
came in pilgrimage.
<p>Richard III. new built the college, and this remained until
suppressed by Edward VI.
<p>During the reigns of Mary and Elizabeth the ground was
used as a garden, and then a storehouse was built on it by Sir
William Winter, for goods brought by sea.
The church stands at the lower end of Seething Lane (this was
sometimes written Seeding Lane, and may be derived either from
Scythian, a name sometimes used for Russian, or from the grain
stored here, at the Russian trading house), and has been repaired
and added to from time to time. The brick tower was rebuilt
from the foundation in 1659; and in recent years there has been
much done in altering and restoring various parts of the edifice.
One of the many inscriptions in the church provides an
illustration of the difference between precept and practice:
that is on the tomb of "Mr. Humphrey Monmouth, Draper
and Sheriff of London, a great ornament, as well as an Alderman of the city, being a person of great wealth, so, of great
charity, especially towards the promoting of a knowledge of
the Gospel; he harboured Tyndale and encouraged his translation of the Testament, contributing largely towards the printing of it, and other pious books against the errors of Rome,
for which, in <date value="1528">1528</date>, he was put to great trouble by Sir Thomas
More, Lord Chancellor, and put into the Tower. He was
favoured by Lord Thomas Cromwell."
<p>We do not usually associate the name of Thomas More with
persecution, but in Tyndale's case there is no doubt, and the
language used in some of the seven volumes written by More




<pb n="20" id="p.20">
against him is very violent. "Thou art accursed, Tyndale, the
son of the Devil, for neither flesh nor blood hath taught thee
these heresies, but thine own father the Devil that is in hell."
"There should have been more burned, by a great many, than
there have been these seven years last past."
<p>Among others buried in the church are Henry Howard,
Earl of Surrey, beheaded in <date value="1546">1546</date> ; Sir Richard Devereux;
Margaret, wife of William Ash, Russia merchant, and daughter
of Dr. Dee, fourteen years physician to the Emperor of Russia ;
Mrs. Jane Russell, gentlewoman of the bedchamber to Queen
Mary, and wife to William Russell, sergeant of the cellar to
our late sovereign lady, Queen Elizabeth; William Arma, Esq.,
servant to Henry VIII., Edward VI., Queen Mary, and Queen
Elizabeth; and a gentleman to whom we owe the first collected
edition of Chaucer's works- "William Thinne, Esq. Pray for
the soul of William Thinne, Esq., one of the masters of the
honourable household to King Henry VIII., our sovereign Lord.
He departed from the prison of this frail life on the 10th day of

Dame Joanne Kempthorne, widow of the famous seaman, <date value="1691">1691</date> ;
and many more or less distinguished folk.
<p>Dr. George Hicks, a friend of Pepys, who officiated at his
funeral, was vicar of the church ; and here George Jeffreys (Judge),
was married to his first wife, Sarah Masham, on <date value="1667-05-23">May 23, 1667</date>.
John Quincy Adams, sixth President of the United States, was
married here, to Louisa Catherine Johnson, on <date value="1797-07-26">July 26, 1797</date>.
The headless body of Laud was carried here after his execution, and remained some time, until its removal to St. John's


<pb n="22" id="p.22">
College, Oxford. The bodies of many others who suffered on
Tower Hill were carried to this church.
<p>The open space between the church and the place of execution was utilised for erecting stands for the spectators, and it
was here that the grim episode occurred at the execution of Simon
Fraser, Lord Lovat, when he laughed on seeing the scaffolding
fall, killing and maiming many of those who had come to witness his death; yet the old man was troubled in his mind by the
thought of his body lying headless in the grave until the Resurrection, and just before the accident had begged a relative, who
was a surgeon, to sew his head on again after the execution.
Only one baptism is of much interest to us-that of William
Penn, a babe that was fated to wander many weary ways by
land and sea, ere coming to his final resting-place in the blessed
quietude of the "Jordans."
<p>The church is remarkable also as being the first where the
English tongue was used in divine service, a century and more
after it had been introduced in the law courts. (Tyndale's translation was burned in the time of Henry VIII.) "The first
time the 'Te Deum' was used in English was at the funeral of
Humphrey Monmouth, Sheriff of London, in <date value="1535">1535</date>, at Barking
Church on Tower Hill." "And at that tyme, in the steede of
the Dirige, hee had the Psalm 'Te Deum' in English sung;
whereat the people much marvelled, and the Bishop of London
was therewithal sore offended." But in the same year came the
order from Lord Cromwell, charging the curates to preach to
their parishioners, teach them their Pater Noster, Ave, and Credo,
the Commandments, and the Articles of Faith in the English
tongue. But this liberty did not last long. By <date value="1543">1543</date> it was
<pb n="23" id="p.23">



represented to the King that even the revised version of the Bible
was disfigured by unfaithful renderings, and notes calculated to
mislead the ignorant and unwary; the book had taught ignorant
men to discuss the meaning of inspired writings in ale-houses
and taverns, till, heated by liquor and controversy, they had
used bad language and provoked breaches of the peace. To
remedy this, Tyndale's version was declared "crafty, false, and
untrue," and the authorised version was to be published without notes; permission to read the Bible to others in public
was revoked; in private families it was to be read only by
persons of the rank of lords and gentlemen; reading it personally was confined to householders and females of noble or gentle
birth. Any other woman, or any artificer, apprentice, journeyman, servant, or labourer who should presume to open the sacred
volume was liable for each offence to one month's imprisonment.
To further guide his people, the King had published a book under
the title of " A Necessary Doctrine and Erudition for any Christned
Man," and that was to be the standard of English orthodoxy.
<p>The church is also memorable as being one of the three
where curfew was rung for the city, the others being Bow Church
and St. Giles, and if any parish clerk rung after these, he was to be
presented to the Quest of Wardmote.
<p>Until the beginning of the Stuart days, many great folks had
their houses round Tower Hill. In <date value="1590">1590</date> Sir Francis Walsingham
died in his "great house" in Seething Lane; and no doubt a large
proportion of the illustrious ones buried in the churches near by
were resident in the vicinity.
<p>Westward towards Billingsgate, between Eastcheap and the
river, there is a maze of narrow streets and alleys, crammed



from early morning till evening with laden porters and vehicles,
everywhere permeated with the odours of the fishy traffic from
Billingsgate Market, varied here and there with the smell of fruits
and nuts from the warehouses where this great sea-borne trade is
still handled. There are several churches in this area still standing.
St. Mary-at-Hill is a flourishing church, under quite modern ways
of management, doing much good work among the residents, for
there are still many of these, living beside their work. When
the hubbub of the market is over, on Sundays, and holidays, they
dwell in an unvexed quietude, neighbours among neighbours,
reproducing a kind of village life that is hardly possible now
anywhere else. This holds good all over the city, and dwellers
in parts of the town more highly thought of may well envy them
their freedom from noise and many of the other troubles of civilisation which pursue us to the remotest suburb. This is a church
of very ancient foundation, first as a chantry in <date value="1330">1330</date>, by Rope
de Urytel. In <date value="1337">1337</date> Richard de Hackney, citizen, presented
Nigellus Dalleye to the living; and in <date value="1497">1497</date>, while digging the
foundations for a new church, the body of his wife, Alice Hackney,
was found, undecayed and the joints flexible; after some days it
was again laid in the ground.
<p>The church was not entirely destroyed in <date value="1666">1666</date>, and on
being repaired, the parish of St. Andrew Hubbard was annexed
to it. The church of that parish stood where afterwards was the
King's Weighhouse.
<p>St. Mary was the church of the Fraternity of Fellowship
Porters, a body that ceased to exist a few years ago. Readers of
Dickens will remember it as the name of a riverside tavern in
'Our Mutual Friend," with its kindly, bustling proprietress, Miss




fession seems to have been a success, as we next find him a "reader"
to Richardson.
<p>Churches were thickly scattered all around, for besides these
now or recently standing, a little plane tree in three yards of
space near the bottom of Botolph Lane marks another.
St. Magnus by London Bridge, the tower of which appears in
the drawing, contains the ashes of Miles Coverdale: he was at
first buried in St. Bartholomew by the Exchange, and his dust was
removed thither when that church was pulled down. Troubled
in his grave, he had not much peace in life.
<p>Under his supervision was printed and published the first
complete version of the Bible in English ; at first associated with
Tyndale, after his execution Grafton became his partner: together they went to Paris. To quote Grafton's words, "In <date value="1537">1537</date>
the great Bible in English, in the great volume, was printed in
Paris, in as privy a manner as might be; but when it was known,
not only ye same Bibles, being 2500 in number, were seized and
made confiscat, but also both the printer, merchants, and correctors with great jeopardy of their lives escaped." The whole
issue was seized by the Inquisition and destroyed, except some
copies which were used for wrapping haberdashery. At Geneva,
Coverdale was afterwards engaged on the "Geneva Bible." None
of his arduous work brought him any of the world's wealth, and
when he returned to England, and was made Rector of St. Magnus,
he was too poor to pay the "first fruits." He afterwards was
made Bishop of Exeter.
<p>In olden days this church, standing so near the river, was
somewhat of a snare for the clergy, and in the time of Henry
VII. "Arnold's Chronicle" recites-" that dyvers of the priests

Abbey. Annually on the Sunday after midsummer, the Fellowship Porters assembled here for service in the morning; and during
the reading of the prayers, two by two, they reverently approached
the altar, where, on the rails, were placed two basins, in which
they placed their offerings, being then followed by the congregation in similar fashion; the money was afterwards distributed
amongst the poor and indigent members of the Society.

<div1 type="entry" n="6"><head>ST. DUNSTAN'S IN THE EAST</>
<p>St. Dunstan's in the East has associations with Sir John Hawkins, the famous seaman, cousin of Drake and companion of
Frobisher, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, and all these remarkable men
who made it their life's work to "singe the King of Spain's beard"
and capture his treasure, a doughty company, dealing in slaves,
discovering the hidden parts of the earth, and quoting Scripture,
sometimes to the embarrassment of their royal mistress. "God's
death!" she said of Hawkins, "this fool went out a soldier and
has come back a divine."
<p>We can understand them as little as we can their Queen, but
there is no possible doubt of the great part they played in the
world. Hawkins died at sea off Puerto Rico, and it is doubtful
whether his body was brought home; but his widow erected a
monument to him in St. Dunstan's, and it may be that he was
buried there. Besides his fame as a seaman, he may be remembered
as the man who first introduced into England what Cobbett called
"that accursed root," the potato, from South America.
The church was destroyed in the Great Fire, having been
rebuilt in <date value="1633">1633</date>. The fire left only the walls standing, and the
present church is the result of rebuilding and repairing in <date value="1668">1668</date>;
<pb n="25" id="p.25">



the steeple was not built until <date value="1698">1698</date>. In the church many famous
citizens were buried. In <date value="1479">1479</date>, at the funeral of Sir Bartholomew
James, the friars of St. Austin were to be paid twenty shillings,
"for that the day of his burying they come to this church and
there sing the Dirige by note and pray for his soul. To every
other of the three orders of Friars in the City, to pray for his soul,
6s. 8d. And if it may be, at the discretion of Dame Alice,
his wife, there be sung in St. Dunstan's, Dirige and Mass of
Requiem by the priests and clerks devoutly, from the time of his
burial till and unto his 'month's mind' were finished; and every
one of them to have 6s. 8d. to pray for his soul; and to every
house of Lazars in the City of London 3s. 4d. to pray for his soul."
There were many other bequests for the good of his soul, including annual memorial services for himself and his two wives.
<p>Whether this custom of singing Diriges was thirsty work or not,
bread, wine, cheese, and ale were dispensed liberally at St. Dunstan's; the accounts give the expenditure on various days:-
<list>
<item>At the anniversary of the dedication-Bread, wine and ale, 15d.
<item>St. Fabrian's and St. Bastian's Day-Bread, wine and ale, 13d.
<item>St. Dunstan's Day-Bread, wine, ale, and garlands, 6d.
<item>Ascension Day-Bread and ale, 2d.
<item>Whitsunday and Trinity Sunday, 2d.
<item>Corpus Christi Day.-Garlands and ale, 11d.
<item>Easter Eve-Bread and ale, 2d., and a quarter of cole for the Holy Fire, 5d.
</list>
<p>In the church also lies an uncle of Lord Bacon: "James Bacon,
Alderman and Sheriff of London, <date value="1573">1573</date>." This was a younger
brother of Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper, their father being Robert
Bacon of Drinkston in Suffolk. The church was also the scene
of that comedy, which went so swiftly into tragedy and back
to comedy again, in <date value="1417">1417</date>. "The Ladies Grange and Trussel,





inflamed by an old grudge about precedence, being in a pew
together, they imperiously vied for superiority, whereby they
became so outrageous that Lord Grange and Mr. Trussel interfered
and drew their swords to revenge the indignity offered to each
lady. The congregation became alarmed and tried to appease
the combatants, but the enraged gentlemen deemed every one his
enemy, and wickedly murdered Thos. Petwarden, a fishmonger,
and wounded many others. At last they were disarmed and
committed to the Poultry Compter, and soon after were excommunicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury in St. Paul's Church,
and in St. Dunstan's and all the other parish churches of London."
<p>The Archbishop made inquisition, when, after a full hearing,
Lord Grange and his lady were found culpable, and to satisfy the
Church for their impious crimes, were enjoined the following
penance: On the first day of May following, all their servants
should walk in their shirts from St. Paul's to St. Dunstan's, before
the parish priest, immediately followed by the said lord and
lady, the former bareheaded, the latter barefooted, to be followed
by the Archdeacon of London; and at the reconsecration of the
defiled church, the lady was to fill all the sacred vessels with water
and make an oblation of the value off l10 to decorate the altar, and
her lord, a pix of the value of 5 . This done, they were absolved.
The punishment seems rather hard on the unfortunate servants.
<p>The graceful tower of the church differs from all others
designed by Wren, although it is not absolutely novel. There
is a curious legend still among the people, that, when the
church was rebuilt, Wren was too busy to design the steeple, and
this was done by his wife; when nearly finished, alarm was
expressed by the church authorities at the construction, they
<pb n="26" id="p.26">



declaring that the ringing of the bells would bring the whole
structure down; but the lady reassured them, promising to stand
under the "arches" while all the bells were rung, after the work
was completed.  She carried out her promise, and when the
ringers were tired she descended, smiling at their vain fears.
The more probable explanation of this story is that the tower was
designed by the daughter of the great architect. She was known
as an accomplished designer, and some of her work is still to be
seen in more than one City church.
<p>At the bottom of Rood Lane, the church of St. Margaret
Pattens has not much general interest: the tower is wonderfully effective when seen from Idoll Lane. It is first mentioned
as belonging to the Nevills; in <date value="1392">1392</date> it was in the possession of
Robert Birkenden, who conveyed it, ten years later, to Sir Richard
Whittington, and by him it was given to the Mayor and commonalty of London. In recent years it is one of the threatened
churches, and has had a certain vogue in connection with that
curious mental condition known as modern Jacobitism.


         <div1 type="entry" n="7"><head> LOVE LANE AND WREN'S HOUSE</>
<p>There is still, near St. Mary-at-Hill, a fine old house standing, but so built up that little of it can be seen. The finest of
the houses here after the Fire was that between Love Lane and
Botolph Lane, long known as "Wren's house"; unsuccessful
efforts were made to preserve it, but it is now pulled down.
Almost certainly designed by Wren, there was no proof that he
had ever lived there, and, as he had a house in Walbrook, a short
distance away, it was unlikely.
                                                     <pb n="27" id="p.27">


     <p>It was a fine old house, and there is little doubt that it was
the place described by Dickens as "Todgers'"; every detail fitted
his description. The difficulty in finding it was no exaggeration: built on the slope, there were stables under part of it;
the door opening on to the flat roof where the Monument
loomed above, and the parapet over Love Lane, on which young
" Bailey" executed some of his acrobatic feats, were all there
while the old house was standing. From <date value="1859">1859</date> until recently,
the house was used as a school, and some internal alterations had
been made to adapt it for that purpose.
     <p>From Botolph Lane it was reached by a large courtyard
with fruit warehouses on three sides, the house occupying the
fourth. A curious dog-kennel occupied the space under the double
stair outside-the entrance hall was laid with squares of black
and white marble; on the left, a fine panelled room, the panels
having pictures painted on them, much obscured by dirt and
smoke. Some of the figures were American Indians, and probably
the house was built for a merchant of American produce having
his warehouses round his own courtyard. One of the pictures
was signed "Robinson, <date value="1696">1696</date>," which is twenty years later than
a date on one of the ceilings. The stair had a fine rail, carved
newel posts, and string-boards; on each floor, judging from the
contour of the mouldings on the ceiling, a hall extended to the
front of the house, the entire width of the stair well : the rooms
opened on either side from these landings. The ceilings had a
decoration of roses: the mantelpieces, architraves, and trusses were
all of fine design, and from one of the top rooms a small stair
led on to the flat, lead-covered roof. There was a back entrance
from Love Lane; and altogether it was a type of house few if
     <pb n="28" id="p.28">





any of which remain in the City.  A later novelist has also
described it minutely ; Mrs. Riddel made it the scene of" Mitre
Court": the site is now occupied by warehouses.
     <p>The little church of St. George, in Botolph Lane, stood
opposite the courtyard entrance to "Wren's house." It was one
of those rebuilt by Wren.  The last incumbent was Canon
MacColl, who received the living from Gladstone for political
services. The Canon made little use of the church, except to
draw his salary; the building finally fell into decay, and was
pulled down, the parish being joined to St. Mary-at-Hill, but the
Canon continued to draw the stipend to the day of his death in
1907, two years after the church had vanished. Just above the
house described, in Love Lane, there is a door and frame, of cast
iron, a very intricate design-figures, grapes, and vine-leaves. It
is probably of Sussex iron, and certainly was not made for its
present position.
     <p>At the top of the lane was the King's Weigh-house, first
started in the tenth century, for the purpose of collecting tolls
for the king, and general regulation of foreign merchants, whose
powerful guilds, such as the Hanseatic League, were somewhat
given to high-handed ways. A famous chapel afterwards occupied
part of the building till recent times, and bore its name : this has
now been removed to the vicinity of Grosvenor Square.
     <p>To the west is Pudding Lane, where on the 2nd September
1666 what is known as "the Great Fire" broke out in a bakehouse. The water-pipes from the New River were found to be
empty, and in a short time the water-wheels in London Bridge
were destroyed: thus there was no water available. The Lord
Mayor of the day displayed timidity, stubbornness, and want of
                                                     <pb n="29" id="p.29">




sense, refused military aid, nor would he allow any houses to be
pulled down (Pepys describes him), so the fire burned all Monday.
"The following night, if night it could be called, presented a
most magnificent, appalling spectacle: a vast column of fire, a
mile in diameter, was seen ascending to the clouds. The flames as
they rose were bent and broken and shivered by the fury of the
wind, and every blast scattered thro' the air innumerable flakes
of fire, which falling, started new conflagrations ; the lurid glare
of the sky, the oppressive heat of the atmosphere, the crackling
of flames, and the falling of houses and churches, combined to
fill every breast with terror. On Wednesday the Duke of York
saved the Temple Church by destroying the neighbouring buildings, and next morning a similar precaution was taken by the
King at Westminster Abbey and Whitehall. On Thursday it became calm, and hopes were expressed that the worst was over,
but it burst out again in the Temple ; it raged round Cripplegate,
and made a rapid advance towards the Tower," but gradually
died down. There were burned 13,200 houses and 89 churches,
including St. Paul's: the fire swept 373 acres within, and 63 acres
outside the walls, and in the fields towards Highgate and Islington
there were lying on the bare ground, mostly in utter destitution,
200,000 people.

     <div1 type="entry" n="8"><head> ST. MAGNUS AND THE MONUMENT</>
     <p>The drawing shows Fish Street Hill, on the west side of the
Monument, with its continuation up Gracechurch Street-the
same street, but much wider, than the Gracious Street of Pepys'
time, taking its name from Stephen le Grasse, who was Sheriff of
London in <date value="1211">1211</date>, "and builded here a parish church, and called
      <pb n="30" id="p.30">





it by his own name, Grasse Church." This custom of calling
a church by the name of the donor was very common in London,
and explains some of the most mysterious of these designations.
   Gracechurch Street in the early morning hours becomes part
of the great market of Billingsgate, the waiting vehicles extending
closely on one side as far as Lombard Street. Towards the river,
the Monument is the dominating feature; this noble Doric
column was erected by Wren in memory of the Great Fire. On
the west side, Cibber's bas-relief shows Charles II., surrounded
by Liberty, Genius, and Science, giving directions for the restoration of the City; completed in 1667, it stands on the ground
formerly occupied by the parish church of St. Margaret. An
inscription on the pedestal, ascribing the fire to the malice of the
Papists, and satirised by Pope-
           <lb>"Where London's column, pointing to the skies,
             <lb> Like a tall bully, lifts his head and lies"-
was universally considered unjust, and it has been erased for
many years past. Even now, with the advent of tall buildings,
there is a wonderful view from the top.
    <p>Just opposite the Black Prince had a house, which in later
times became the Black Bull Inn. In 1727, the Government
wanting men to man the ships, some ingenious leader of
the pres-gang placed a live turkey on the top of the Monument, which in a short time causing a great crowd, the pres-gang had the opportunity of selecting such men as they wanted.
No further comment is made, but probably the proceedings
ended in a rather tumultuous fashion.

 seems to have been a success, as we next find him a "reader"
to Richardson.
    <p> Churches were thickly scattered all around, for besides these
now or recently standing, a little plane tree in three yards of
space near the bottom of Botolph Lane marks another.
    <p> St. Magnus by London Bridge, the tower of which appears in
the drawing, contains the ashes of Miles Coverdale: he was at
first buried in St. Bartholomew by the Exchange, and his dust was
removed thither when that church was pulled down. Troubled
in his grave, he had not much peace in life.
    <p> Under his supervision was printed and published the first
complete version of the Bible in English ; at first associated with
Tyndale, after his execution Grafton became his partner: together they went to Paris. To quote Grafton's words, "In <date value="1537">1537</date>
the great Bible in English, in the great volume, was printed in
Paris, in as privy a manner as might be ; but when it was known,
not only ye same Bibles, being 2500 in number, were seized and
made confiscat, but also both the printer, merchants, and correctors with great jeopardy of their lives escaped."  The whole
issue was seized by the Inquisition and destroyed, except some
copies which were used for wrapping haberdashery. At Geneva,
Coverdale was afterwards engaged on the " Geneva Bible." None
of his arduous work brought him any of the world's wealth, and
when he returned to England, and was made Rector of St. Magnus,
he was too poor to pay the "first fruits." He afterwards was
made Bishop of Exeter.
    <p> In olden days this church, standing so near the river, was
somewhat of a snare for the clergy, and in the time of Henry
VII. "Arnold's Chronicle" recites-"that dyvers of the priests
<pb n="32" id="p.32">







and clarkes, in the time of dyvyne service, be at taverns and ale-houses, at fyshing and other triflis, whereby dyvyne service is
let."  Other delinquencies are remarked on and condemned,
the priests apparently preferring to swap fish stories in an ale-house, or try for a salmon in the eddies by London Bridge,
rather than their proper duties.
<p>     The present church was rebuilt by Wren in <date value="1676">1676</date>; and the
spire is one of the most graceful designed by him.
<p>     The carved and gilt clock, which old prints show overhanging the footway of the bridge, was erected by Sir Charles
Duncombe in <date value="1709">1709</date>, at a cost of &amp;485.      When a poor
"prentice" he had to wait for his master on London Bridge,
and missed him from not knowing the hour; he thereon vowed
that if he ever became rich he would do this-and kept his vow.
<p>     The historic associations of London Bridge are endless,
since, in <date value="1163">1163</date>, "it was first builded of tymber, begonne by a
priest named Peter, who Leyland called Peter of Colechurch."
<p>     In <date value="1209">1209</date> this bridge "that before was made of tymber,
and repaired by a college of priests yt dwelled behind Christs
Church (St. Catherine Cree) nere to Aldgate, named the 'Pappy,'
was now begone to be builded of stone, at the charge of ye
citizens of London, and of the passers by ye waye, and of other
good and charitable persons." Being the only bridge over the
Thames in London, it was a great feature in the life of the city,
subject to many assaults, partially destroying it, and was the
route of many memorable pageants and processions.  All down
the years the human tide has streamed across, or paused to look
at the  er traffic, the seagulls, and the ships that come and go for
pleasure or profit down to the sea-the Tower Bridge opening and
                                                 <pb n="33" id="p.33">





closing its huge jaws; the Tower and Custom-house dreaming
in the sunlight; steamers laden with fish from the Dogger
Bank, with armies of porters streaming along the gangways like
ants; the Dutch eel-boats lying at their moorings, as they are
shown in the earliest pictures of the scene; Southwark, at the
southern end, with its memories of players at Bankside; St.
Olave's, Tooley Street, with its memories of Harvard ; the Marshalsea; and St. Mary Overy where John Gower lies, and where James
of Scotland terminated his long captivity by marrying a cousin
of Henry VI. and leaving a bond for  l400,000 for his good
behaviour-a day's proceedings calculated to mix the feelings of
any man.
<p>     Whether, as savants say, the children's rhyme of" London
Bridge has broken down" points to human sacrifice, or not, it is
sure that all the earlier London Bridges had these in plenty;
and this more prosaic bridge of ours is free from the ghastly
shows that defiled the earlier ones, when one head or limb of
those executed succeeded another, placed there to daunt the multitude: whether the custom had any such effect seems doubtful.
<p>     When John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, was sent to the
Tower owing to his opposition to the marriage of Henry VIII.
with Anne Boleyn, the Pope sent him a Cardinal's hat. The
King, hearing of this, said, " Well, let the Pope send him a hat
when he will; Mother of God! he shall wear it on his shoulders
then, for I will leave him never a head to set it on!"
<p>    Fisher was executed on the 22nd June; and his head should
have been put on London Bridge the same night; but it was
kept back to be shown to Queen Anne Boleyn. After being
duly inspected, the head was "parboiled," pricked upon a pole,
<pb n="34" id="p.34">







and set on high on London Bridge-Henry and his new wife
doubtless congratulating themselves on being rid of him. But
the head on the pole kept getting fresher, "his cheeks a
comely red," and the people came in thousands to gaze on the
miracle, till passage over the bridge was stopped by the throngs.
After fourteen days of this, the executioners were ordered to take
it down and throw it in the Thames, and in place thereof was
set up the head of the most blessed and constant martyr, Sir
Thomas More.
<p>The water-wheels, worked by the current, in several arches of
the old bridge, were introduced by Peter Morrin, a Dutchman,
in the time of Queen Elizabeth. In 1582 he gave an exhibition
of his skill in water-raising to the Mayor and Aldermen, throwing it over St. Magnus' steeple, "which had never been seen in
England." So much were the authorities impressed by the
display that they granted him a lease for 500 years of the use
of the Thames water for 10s. per annum. He distributed the
water over a great part of the city by means of large leaden
pipes and a "forcier."  Compensation for this lease had to be
paid by more modern water companies, and probably is paid now.
Even at that time there was opposition; one "Russell" proposed to bring Uxbridge River to London, but the scheme was
too expensive. It was revived again in 1641; in the time of
George I. in the late years of the nineteenth century; and again
in an indirect fashion in these days. The present bridge stands
about 100 feet west from the position of the old one, and was
commenced in <date value="1824">1824</date>, finished in <date value="1831">1831</date>, and opened with great
ceremony by William IV. Mr. Rennie, the architect, died during
the progress of the work, and it was completed by his son and
<pb n="35" id="p.35">





Mr. Joliffe. Being found too narrow in recent years, it has
been widened to the extent of the footways; when built, the
spans were the largest of any stone bridge in Europe.
   <p>Billingsgate as a market is very old. Of the reign of Etheldred, <date value="979">979</date>, a set of rules exists, giving the dues payable. A small
vessel had to pay one halfpenny; a greater, bearing sails, one
penny; a keel or hulk, fourpence; a ship laden with wood, one
piece of timber.
   <p>In early days much of the fish must have come from the
river near by, and many laws were passed to regulate the fishery.
An early set of regulations says : "That no person shall use any
net under 21/2 inches in the mesh above Richmond Crane, nor
any net in the work called beating of the bush, of less than 3
inches. No person shall draw any net for salmon less than 3
inches in the mesh from the  oth March till 14th September
in any part of the river Thames from Kew Pile to the city of
London Mark Stone, above Staines Bridge."
   <p>  Sizes of fish to be taken or sold according to the ancient
assize : Pike, 14 ins.; Barbel, 12 ins.; Salmon, 16 ins.; Trout, 8
ins.; Tench, 8 ins.; Roach, 6 ins.; Dace, 6 ins.; Flounders, 6 ins.
(The sizes are very different nowadays.) In 1673 the rules say,
that no fisherman shall "rug" for flounders between London
Bridge and Westminster, but only two casts at low water, and
two casts at high water, and no person shall draw the shores of
the Thames, save only for salmon, and none shall fish with a net
under 6 ins. in the mesh.
   <p> The clause as to "beating of the bush " refers to a method
still practised on the Colne to some extent, perhaps illegally.
One man has a net like that used in shrimping, but on a
   <pb n="36" id="p.36">





longer pole. This is thrust into the weed beds, when another
man with a pole pokes and beats all round to force the fish into
the net.
     <p>In <date value="1699">1699</date>, by Act of Parliament, the market of Billingsgate
 was declared a free market for fish six days in the week, with
 permission to sell "mackarel" on Sundays any time before or
 after divine service. In these days there were neither preservatives nor cold storage; now, it is said to be quite easy to
 keep fish fresh for twelve months.
     <p>In the light of modern research, it seems probable that the
prevalence of leprosy in the city was owing to the consumption
of stale and badly cured fish. Many enactments were passed on
the subject, but all tending towards segregation. One of these,
in 1346, was proclaimed in every ward, " That all leprous persons
shall depart the city in fifteen days, and that no person shall
suffer any leper to remain in his house, and that all lepers shall
be removed to some of the outparts from the company and
conversation of the healthy."
    <p>Owing largely to the rough and dirty condition of the
streets and roads, the river remained the great highway until
comparatively recent times, when the hackney carriage took the
place of the waterman's boat; for these there were strict tables
of fares drawn out from time to time, and a few of them, taken
from the list prepared in <date value="1700">1700</date>, show how things have altered
in two hundred years. In the list there is a distinction made
between oars (two men) and sculls; oars being of course slightly
more expensive, while each additional passenger was charged
for, varying from 1d. to 1s. according to distance.

      "East Chepe " has long been          a famous street, and in        the
fifteenth century Lydgate's description makes it even noisier
than it is to-day:-

                 <lb>"Then I hied me unto East cheap,
                 <lb>One cried ribs of beef and many a pie;
                       <lb>Pewter pots they clattered in a heap;
                       <lb>There was harp and pipe and minstrelsy.
                       <lb>Yea by cock! nay by cock! some began to cry,
                       <lb>Some sang of Jenkin and Julian for their meed;
                       <lb>But for lack of money I might not speed.

                       <lb>The taverner took me by the sleeve:
                       <lb>Sir, sith he; will you our wine assay ?
                       <lb>I answered, that can not me much grieve,
                       <lb>A penny can do no more than it may.
                       <lb>I drank a pint, and for it did pay,
                       <lb>Yet sore a hungered from thence to yede.
       <pb n="38" id="p.38">



   <p> A famous tavern, the "Bear," remained in existence until
the nineteenth century. This was the scene of the arrest of
Prince Hal in Shakespeare's "Henry IV."
   <p> Westward, on both sides of the street, are many churches
and fragments of graveyards, crowded among the warehouses
and offices.  A remarkable feature in these streets and lanes
near Cannon Street Station, are the number of fine doorways of
early eighteenth-century design. There is one in College Street,
one in Little Trinity Lane (the Painter-Stainers' Hall), and perhaps finest of all are those at Nos. 1 and 2 Lawrence Pountney
Hill, besides the two shown in the drawing of St. Michael Royal.
Under No. 3 Lawrence Pountney Hill is the crypt of the Manor
of the Rose, mentioned in Shakespeare's " Henry VIII.," Act I.,
Scene 2. The Duke there mentioned was Charles Brandon,
Duke of Suffolk. The manor, originally in the hands of the
De la Poles, forfeited by attainder, was given, in <date value="1513">1513</date>, by
Henry VIII. to Sir Charles Brandon.  This nobleman had distinguished himself as a commander in a battle with the French
fleet in <date value="1511">1511</date>, and, much against the will of Henry, in 1515
married Mary Tudor, the King's sister, who had been previously
married to Louis of France, at Greenwich, and left a widow
after some three months-Mary informing her brother "that
she married once to please him, and would either marry now
to please herself, or go to a convent."  She fixed a short term
during which Suffolk must either take or abandon her for ever,
and on the last day he consented to risk it and take her. They
were privately married; the King after a time gave his consent,
and had them remarried before him at Greenwich. This manor
was sold in <date value="1560">1560</date>, when " Richard Hills, merchant-taylor, gave
                                                    <pb n="39" id="p.39">






l500 towards the purchase of the house called the Manor of the
Rose, for the merchant-taylors to build a school thereon." The
crypt still exists, and was long used as a wine cellar.
    <p> In the reign of Edward III., <date value="1371">1371</date>, Lawrence Pulteney
churchyard was appointed as the place where the weavers from
Flanders should meet; the weavers from Brabant in the churchyard of St. Mary Somerset. Lawrence Pulteney Church was
destroyed in the Great Fire, and not rebuilt: a part of the
churchyard remains. It was in this church that "Nan Clarges"
married her first husband, Ratford, a farrier. She afterwards
became the wife of General Monk, and so Duchess of Albemarle.
This was one of the few ladies whom Pepys did not admire, and
he writes of her in somewhat vigorous terms.


    <div1 type="entry" n="9"><head>   ST. SWITHIN'S AND LONDON STONE</>
    <p> St. Swithin's by London Stone was rebuilt by Wren in
<date value="1678">1678</date>. In <date value="1869">1869</date> the interior was restored. St. Swithin and
St. Neot were the two men who educated King Alfred, and the
former accompanied him on his journey to Rome. Perhaps the
most interesting things relating to the church are, the marriage
of John Dryden, "a bachelor aged about thirty years," with
Dame Elizabeth Howard, aged about twenty-five years, and
"London Stone," which is set behind an iron screen in the
church wall. This stone has been the subject of much learned
inquiry. Maitland writes of it as on the other side of the street
from the church, and covered by a new stone. Fabian says:
"Some of our forefathers had a conceit that London Stone was
set up in signification of the city's devotion to Christ." It is
    <pb n="40" id="p.40">





agreed that it was the Roman milestone from which all distances
in Britain were measured. Probably it was the spot where the
folk-mote, or open-air assembly, gathered to legislate for the
government of the city. There is a legend to the effect that
any citizen who was aggrieved or oppressed, and could reach
London Stone, laying his hand thereon, could appeal to the
King for redress of his suit; much in the manner which holds
good in Jersey, where "Ha Ro a l'aide mon Prince," repeated
thrice, is still a valid injunction in encroachments on property;
there it is traced as an old appeal to Rollo, Duke of Normandy.
It was some such appeal that was in Jack Cade's mind when he
struck this stone with his sword, saying, "Now is Mortimer
Lord of this city." Probably from long use as a species of
tribune, the stone acquired a certain sanctity, as a standing
emblem of the City's liberties.

<div1 type="entry"><head>WATLING STREET</>
     <p>Budge Row leads into Watling Street, towards St. Paul's.
This street dates back to Roman times, and in its brief length had
at one time many churches, and still has a wealth of memories
for those who care to search for them.
    <p>The tavern in Watling Street, at the corner of Bow Lane,
is one of the first houses rebuilt in London after the Great
Fire; judging from the brickwork, it has been partly built of
old materials, and though somewhat altered to suit modern
conditions is little changed otherwise; still showing the heavy
beams and joists used at that time.
    <p>St. Mary Aldermary, which Stow says was called Aldermary
                                                    <pb n="41" id="p.41">





because it was older than Mary-le-Bow, had nevertheless as its
first known rector John le Rus, about <date value="1288">1288</date>, nearly two hundred
years after the date of Bow Church. Anciently it belonged to the
Prior and Canons of Canterbury, and in 1400 Thomas Arundel the
Archbishop did, by indenture, exchange St. Mary Aldermary for
the advowson of the church of Westwell in Kent, with the Prior
and Chapter of Christ Church, Canterbury, reserving the vicarage
of Westwell to himself and his successors. This thirteenth-century church was partly rebuilt by Sir Henry Keeble, knight
and Lord Mayor, but he died about "Evil May Day" before the
work was finished, leaving a rhyming appeal to wealthy men to
finish the work: this was in <date value="1517">1517</date>. Many years elapsed before
the work was done by Sir William Rodoway and Richard Pearson,
in <date value="1626">1626</date>. The old benefactor was not very well treated: buried
in the church, no monument was erected to him till <date value="1534">1534</date>,
when his son-in-law, William Blount, Lord Mountjoy, "laid a
stone over him." In the troubles following the Reformation, the
monument was cast down, and Sir William Laxton, Lord Mayor
in <date value="1534">1534</date>, was buried in his place. Destroyed by the Great Fire,
the church was rebuilt by Wren in <date value="1711">1711</date> at a cost (according to
his accounts) of &pound;3457, 15s. 9d., Henry Rodgers having given
l5000 for the purpose. The tower is said to be Keeble's work,
and built of Caen stone; probably this only required partial
rebuilding, thus saving part of the money. The researches of
Dr. F. J. Furnivall have proved the connection between this
church and the ancestors of Geoffrey Chaucer. In April <date value="1349">1349</date>
Richard Chaucer, vintner of London, bequeathed his tenement
and tavern to the church, and was buried there. His son, John
Chaucer, citizen and vintner of Thames Street, in <date value="1349-07-">July 1349</date>
<pb n="42" id="p.42">





executed a deed relating to some lands, and in <date value="1380">1380</date>, the poet,
by deed, released all right in his father's house in Thames Street,
to Henry Herbury, vintner. Richard and John Chaucer were
the grandfather and father of the poet. Among other monuments, the chancel contains a sculptured tablet, which has no
inscription; this is cynically said to have been erected by a
widow who married again before there was time to do the work.
    <p>Where Bread Street crosses Watling Street, a bas-relief in
the wall of a warehouse records the fact that John Milton was
baptized here. The church and churchyard have entirely disappeared; destroyed in the Fire and rebuilt by Wren, the
church stood until <date value="1876">1876</date>, when it was pulled down and the land
used for building. At the corner of Friday Street a few square
yards remain of the graveyard of St. John the Evangelist. This
church was not rebuilt after the Fire. John Knox was rector
of a church in Bread Street for some years. At the corner of
Old 'Change and Watling Street is the Church of St. Augustine,
rebuilt by Wren in <date value="1682">1682</date>, and restored in <date value="1850">1850</date>; serving the
united parishes of St. Faith and St. Augustine; and most memorable to us as the church of which the Rev. R. H. Barham, author
of" The Ingoldsby Legends," was rector for many years until he
died in <date value="1845">1845</date>.
    <p>On the other side of Old 'Change was St. Paul's School,
facing the Cathedral churchyard, but entering from Old 'Change.
This was the school re-founded by John Colet, Dean of St. Paul's,
in honour of Christ Jesus and his Blessed Mother Mary, for 53
children, in allusion to the number of fishes in the miraculous
draught. They were to be taught free, but a competent knowledge
of reading and writing was required before admission-the hours
                                                    <pb n="43" id="p.43">




were 7 to 11, and 1 to 5, in winter and summer-and above all,
"to increase knowledge and worshipping of God and our Lord
Jesus Christ, and a good Christian life and manners." The first
master was William Lily. The school was divided by four partitions and organised in eight classes. John Milton entered as a
pupil in <date value="1620">1620</date>, and remained nearly five years. The school was
but a few hundred yards from his father's house. Besides the long
hours at school, he had a private tutor, Thomas Young, of St.
Andrews' University, and worked with insuperable industry, sitting
up half the night, so that at fifteen he was fully ripe for academical training, and in <date value="1625">1625</date> entered as a pensioner of Christ's
College, Cambridge.  This school was removed to Hammersmith some twenty-five years ago, where it still carries on the
great work begun by Dean Colet.

      <div1 type="entry"><head> ST. MICHAEL ROYAL, COLLEGE HILL</><p>
     In College Hill, west from Cannon Street Railway Station,
is St. Michael Royal, the church where rests all that is left of
Sir Richard Whittington.
     His great name and many good deeds for the city of London
were not enough to prevent his body being twice dug up in search
of spoil, so that the man about whose name so many legends
cling, was three times buried. A younger son of Sir W. Whittington of Pauntley in Gloucestershire, he was born about <date value="1360">1360</date>,
and came to London, where he became a mercer, and in <date value="1392">1392</date>

his wealth, and he died in the spring of <date value="1423">1423</date>, aged about sixty-
three years. His benefactions were greater and more widely spread
than those of any other man of his time. Almost every citizen
of wealth founded almshouses, or left money or land for some
purpose bearing on the common good; and if all these funds had
been carefully guarded, they would now have been of enormous
value, but the greater part of them appear to have vanished entirely.
    <p>College Hill takes its name from the "college" founded
there by Whittington. "This worthy man, Master Whittington,
Alderman, and three times Mayor of London, did in his lifetime
so goodly and vertuously dispose ye blessings of God given to him,
which was the abundance of wealth and riches; that first and
before all things, to shew himself mindful and thankful unto the
mighty God, he erected one house of prayer to give praise and
thanks to His holy name; which house he called Whittington
College, situate near unto the Three Cranes of the Vintry, and
in the same he placed a number of aged and poor men and
women, whom he endowed both with house, fire, cloth, and
weekly alms, as is not only to their great comforts, but also much
to his praise and commendacion.
    <p> "This man also was so zealous yt he could not be idle, but
of force compelled by God's holy spirit to be occupied in one
good work or another. In so much that he builded of his own
cost and charges a gate of London, now called Newgate, which
in times past was but an ugly and loathsome place; and he
builded more than half of the Hospital of St. Bartholomew in
West Smithfield.
    <p> "In like manner he builded at his own proper costs the
beautiful library of the Grey Friars in London, now called Christ's
                                                    <pb n="45" id="p.45">







Hospital, and he also did increase a great part of ye east end of
the Guildhall in London, besides sundry other notable and worthy
works done by him. . . . And now ye aldermen set before your
eyes this beautiful glass of the life and doings of worthy Whittington, and be profitable to your country and benefit your city
wherein God blesseth ye, that ye may live forever by fame, and
not die with rebuke, shame and contempt, as men that live only
to and for themselves, as in these later times too many of you do."
    <p> The oversight and government he committed to the Masters
and Wardens of the Company of Mercers of London, for the
good order of that most noble and goodly foundation.
    <p> The almshouses have vanished and the ground is turned to
other uses ; parts of the vaults of the church were made into wine
cellars, and remained with their dust-laden bottles, festooned with
yard-long cobwebs, under College Street, until the beginning of
this year.
    <p> The building next the church is the Mercers' School, built
on the site of Whittington's almshouses in recent years. The
building with the ornate carved doorways, known to the populace
as "Whittington's House," probably is part of the house erected
on College Hill by the third Duke of Buckingham when he sold
York House, thus referred to in the satirical "Duke of Buckingham's Litany" :-
         <lb>"For purchasing in Dowgate, and selling in the Strand,
         <lb>Calling streets by our name when we have sold the land,
                               Libera nos Domine."
     <p>There were other almshouses in the vicinity. In <date value="1378">1378</date> John
Philpot, Mayor of London, gave unto the city divers tenements
called Philpot's lands, "to the entent that the city should pay
     <pb n="46" id="p.46">




weekly, forever, to thirteen poor people, every of them seven
pence a week, and if any of them fortune to die, the Mayor for
the time being to appoint one, and the Recorder another, to the
rooms of them that be deceased."
      <p>In <date value="1357">1357</date> "Sir John Stodey, Lord Mayor, gave unto the
Vintners of London all the quadrant wherein the Vintners' Hall
now standeth, with tenements round about, from the lane called
Stodey, his lane, to the lane now called Anker Lane, where is
founded thirteen houses for thirteen poor people, which are there
kept of charity rent free."
These old citizens were not afraid of unlucky numbers, and
it has taken many years for men's minds to appreciate their wisdom
in the matter of almshouses, but in this year of grace they seem
to be slowly returning to it.
     <p>In Thames Street and the vicinity were many " great " houses
-that of the Earl of Worcester; another owned by Lord Hastings,
in the time of Richard III.; in Dowgate a house known as the
Erbar (perhaps a Cockney spelling for "harbour" or "arbour ")
    was held in <date value="1341">1341</date> by Geoffrey Scroop, and afterwards by several
 noblemen. Edward IV. gave it to his brother the Duke of
 Clarence; later it became the house of Sir Francis Drake, where
 he lived when resting from the perils of the sea and the Spaniards.
 Tower Royal marks the place of King Stephen's residence. This
 house stood opposite St. Antholin's in Budge Row; at the west
end of the same church stood the house of William of Ipres,
  where the Duke of Lancaster was at dinner when the London
citizens threatened to destroy the Savoy in <date value="1377">1377</date> because he had
imprisoned one of their number.  In later days the Duke of
  <p> Ormond had a house in the same vicinity.
     <pb n="47" id="p.47">




  <p>   Up and down are many lanes, bearing curious old-world
names, twining and curving as they did when only cart-roads
leading to the various hythes and wharfs, and, as usually happens
along the river-side, many taverns. Seamen and men of the
water-side are proverbially thirsty folk, and in the days of
Spanish galleons there was much to spend. But the space was
all swept by the Fire, and there is not much of interest left above
ground. St. James's, Garlickhithe (shown in the distance of
No. 12), contains a monument to Richard Lion, merchant and
sheriff of London, who was beheaded by Wat Tyler in Cheapside.
St. Michael's, Crooked Lane, was the resting-place of Sir William
Walworth; by license from Richard II. he enlarged the church
and added eight chantries thereto to celebrate the divine offices
for the King, for himself, and for his wife, Margaret, while living,
and their souls when dead. London may confer many favours on
its eminent citizens, but a permanent resting-place in the tomb
is certainly not one of the things assured to them.
  <p>   The name of one tavern is of considerable celebrity-"The
Three Cranes" in the Vintry. Pepys mentions it several times,
not in very complimentary terms. And after the battle of
Worcester, when Charles II. and Lord Wilmot parted at Boscobel,
each to make his way separately to London, trying to escape from
their pursuers and gain a refuge on the Continent, this tavern
was agreed on as the rendezvous where they were to inquire for
each other by the name of Ashburnham.
  <p>   The Vintry is a district where considerable fragments of the
wine trade still continue-taking its name from a large warehouse
for the storage of wine which, in early times, stood at the northeast corner of Three Crane Street and Thames Street; here, in
<pb n="48" id="p.48">





<date value="1357">1357</date>, Henry Picard, the Lord Mayor, gave a great feast to the
Kings of England, Scotland, France, and Cyprus. In Stow's
day wine was still very cheap, malmsey being sold at three half-pence a pint ; the quality we must take for granted. The gradual
rise in price since that time largely arises from the duties levied
on its importation.
  <p>   Here and there are fragments of churchyards, or a church
tower left, but there is small room left for tradition among the
swinging cranes and the waggon-cumbered streets. Commerce
is king, and all other things have to go. Southwark Bridge, the
"iron bridge" of "Little Dorrit," opened in <date value="1819">1819</date>, though a
mere modern among hoary antiquities, has nearly come to the
end of its days, and will soon be pulled down and rebuilt. In
St. Bennet's, Paul's Wharf, Inigo Jones was buried, being brought
here from his lodgings in Somerset House, where he died.
  <p>   Mr. Gomme, in his interesting compilation from the Gentle-
man's Magazine, quotes a curious story:-"<date value="1660-05-14">14th May, 1660</date>.
Information was given to the Council of State, that several of
their Majesties' goods were kept at Fontier's warehouse, near
the Three Cranes, Thames Street, for the use of Mrs. Elizabeth
Cromwellwife of Oliver, sometimes called Protector. And the
Council ordered that persons be appointed to view them; and
seventeen carts load of rich house stuff was taken from thence and
brought to Whitehall, from whence they were stolen!"


              <div1 type="entry"><head>THE HERALDS' COLLEGE</>
  <p>  The College of Arms was once the town house of the Earls
of Derby; they previously had a house in Lothbury, which was
                             D                     <pb n="49" id="p.49">




of certain interest in connection with what is said to be the first
instance of those charges of ritual murder brought against the
Jewish people and which still arise on the European continent.
This house had belonged to Isaac of Norwich, and the Jews there
were charged with the crucifixion (one account says circumcision)
of a Christian child. For this, most of the Jews in Norwich were
killed and their houses pulled down, while the Jews in London,
or certain of them, were committed to Newgate under enormous
penalties. King John gave the house of Isaac to the Earl of
Derby on the condition that he and his heirs were to serve the
King and his successors at dinner, and all yearly festivals, with
his head uncovered, without a cap, but with a garland of the
breadth of his little finger.
  <p>   The Earl who built the house here, married the mother ot
Henry VII., and Elizabeth of York was his guest during Richard's
usurpation; and it is said, that as consideration for parting
with this house to the Heralds, the Earl received the estate of
Knowsley. The Heralds, having parted with their house in
Thames Street, this house, described as on Bennett's Hill, was
granted to them by Edward VI. in <date value="1552">1552</date>. Destroyed by the
Fire, it was begun to be rebuilt three years later, but funds were
scarce. A commission obtained for the purpose of collecting
subscriptions was coldly received, only  <date value="l700">l700</date> being obtained.
Sir William Dugdale built the north-west corner at his own
charge, and Sir Henry St. George, "Clarenceux," gave the
profits of some "visitations," <date value="1530">1530</date>, (this sum would consist
of fines exacted from people using heraldic insignia when not
entitled to do so).
  <p>   The part on the east and south sides was erected on a
     <pb n="50" id="p.50">



building lease, making the whole a quadrangle; it was finished
in 1683, remaining thus until Queen Victoria Street was made,
when one side was cut off, leaving the house as it is now.
  <p>  There are many interesting relics in the building; some of
them taken from the body of James IV. when slain at Flodden
on that September evening when, in one hour's fighting, he lost
his life and the lives of ten thousand of his men. His body was
brought to London under rather peculiar circumstances. The
Scots would not believe him dead, and Henry, "to blazon his
death, obtained from the Pope permission to bury him in consecrated ground " (he had been married to Henry's sister, Margaret,
and his going to war with England when under treaty of peace
brought on him, automatically, a sentence of excommunication).
How Henry carried it out is well known. Stow saw the body,
wrapped in lead, lying in a lumber-room at Sheen, after the dissolution of the monasteries. The head was cut off, and came
by devious ways to St. Alban's, Wood Street; where the body
went, no man knows.
  <p>  The Heralds' College cannot be called a handsome structure, except for the dignity given to it by age.  A workman
described it as the place "where they keep the stud book of the
aristocracy," and the definition is, perhaps, fairly correct. The
house occupied by Doctors' Commons before the Great Fire, was
previously the house of the Blounts-Lords Mountjoy. When
that was destroyed, the Doctors were granted Exeter House, the
residence of Lord Burleigh, in the Strand, and there they remained until their own house was rebuilt, when they moved
once more to St. Paul's.
  <p>   Sir Charles Blount was the second son of Lord Mountjoy,
                                                    <pb n="51" id="p.51">





and a student at the Inner Temple, where, at a public dinner,
one day Queen Elizabeth noticed him, inquired his name, gave
him her hand to kiss, and bade him remain at Court, to the
huge disgust of Essex, who, at a tilting match at Westminster,
where the Queen bound Blount's arm with a crimson ribbon,
remarked that "every fool must have his favour."  The result
was a duel in which Essex was wounded, and Elizabeth, gratified
that two such proper young men should have fallen out over her
charms, commanded them to be friends; and in time they did
become assured friends, although they remained rivals.
  <p>   Blackfriars now has only memories of former greatness.
Here was for centuries a great religious house. The religious
orders had many liberties, and always tried to grasp a few
more; disputes with the citizens were incessant, and the latter
had no redress save by petition to the King. This they did
in <date value="1312">1312</date>, pointing out "that the citizens do not think it fair that
persons of religious orders should shirk, as they did, their share
of taxation for the fortifications which shelter them as well as
those who had to pay for their protection." Previous to this
the "Black Friars" had pulled down part of the city wall,
and used the stones to build their convent, the citizens being
ordered to build themselves another and longer wall, to
include and protect the conventual buildings.
  <p>   Yet some individual friars were popular. In <date value="1350">1350</date>, the
"black death" having carried off half of the population,
the Mayor and Aldermen petitioned Pope Clement VI. that
Brother John de Wrotheyn, a "friar preacher," and he only,
might be empowered to grant absolution in the city.
     <p>In these years, <dateRange from="1349" to="1350">1349-50</dateRange>, the plague ravaged the city
     <pb n="52" id="p.52">




so, that over and above those buried in the churches and
churchyards, more than 50,000 were buried near the Charter-house. It always smouldered, breaking out with violence every
few years. Another great pestilence was in <date value="1562">1562</date>, when the
soldiers under the Earl of Warwick, besieged by the French
at Newhaven, were stricken with the plague, and many of them
returning to England carried the infection with them.  "The
infection marvellously increased in sundry parts, but chiefly in
the City of London, so that there died in the city and suburbs,
containing 108 parishes, from the 1st day of April unto the
last day of November following, 23,660 persons. At the first
entrance of the plague into the city, the Mayor and his brethren took order that all such houses as were infected therewith,
should have a headless cross, coloured blue, with this writing
under the foot of the same, 'Per Signum Tau,' set over the
street door; but these crosses increased so sore, and the citizens were crossed away so fast by death, that at length they
were fain to leave their crosses and refer ye matter to God's
merciful hand."
  <p>   "This year because of the plague no Michaelmas term was
kept, and Parliament was prorogued unto <date value="1564-10">October 1564</date>. By
reason of the plague there was no Mayor's feast at the Guildhall,
and the Mayor took his oath at the Tower Gate, <date value="1563">1563</date>. And
yet once again for fear of the plague (although God be praised it
was very well ceased) Hilary term was kept at Herford Castle,
beside the town of Ware, where was both single cheer with
double cost and worse lodging with no less charge."
  <p>   "The aforesaid plague, by the great favour and mercy of
Almighty God, was very well stayed in London ; Easter term and
                                                    <pb n="53" id="p.53">





Midsomer term was kept at Westminster as before it had been
accustomed."  But again in <date value="1569">1569</date>, "This year there was no
Mayor's feast at the Guildhall because of the plague, for the week
wherein he took his oath, there died in the city 51 accounted to
die of the plague."
  <p>  Even after the dissolution of the monasteries, the inhabitants
of Blackfriars resisted the jurisdiction of the city until <date value="1735">1735</date>,
when an action decided in favour of the City Chamberlain
brought the district into the city bounds.
  <p>   In the reign of Elizabeth it became a place much inhabited
by people of fashion, among others by Lord Herbert, son of the
fourth Earl of Worcester; his house, the Queen, in <date value="1600">1600</date>,
honoured with her presence, on the occasion of his marriage
with the daughter of John Russell. The Queen was met at the
water-side by the bride, and was carried to the house in a "litter"
by six knights. She dined there, and supped with Lord Cobham,
who resided near by. Here she took part in what was the last
of her merrymakings, for then Essex was in prison and her
heart was ill at ease.
  <p>   There was a memorable "masque " of eight ladies and a
strange " daunce," new invented; "each lady had a skirt of cloth
of silver, a rich waistcoat wrought with silks and gold and silver,
a mantell of carnacion taffete, cast under the arms, and their
hair loose about their shoulders, curiously knotted and interlaced. Mrs. Fitton led ; the masquers chose eight ladies more
to 'daunce' the measure. Mrs. Fitton went to the Queen and
wooed her daunce. Her Majesty asked her what she was:
'Affection,' she replied.  'Affection,' said the Queen, 'is
false.' Yet her Majesty rose up and 'daunced.'"

After Elizabeth's death memorials were placed in various
churches in London. That in the church of Blackfriars may
  serve as a type, being no more effusive than the others.

       Another effusion, at St. Andrew under Hill, is quoted by
  Brayley.
    <p>    Among others who were buried in this church, long entirely swept away, were Margaret, Queen of Scots; the hearts
  of Eleanor, wife of Edward I., and her son, John, Duke of
  Cornwall; James, King of Spain; and the hearts of John and
  Margaret Vallance.
    <p>    The Black Friars enjoyed a reputation of peculiar sanctity,
  hence the wish of many to have even a part of their bodies
  buried there.  King John desired to be buried in the robes of
  the order, expecting that their virtue would help him in the
  reckoning beyond the tomb.

    <p> In 1523, Henry VIII., who followed the example of his
father, and summoned Parliament as seldom as possible, was by
his necessity compelled to summon a Parliament to Black Friars,
when, by the influence of the Court, Sir Thomas More was
chosen Speaker. The Cardinal demanded the sum of l800,000,
and proposed to raise that by a property tax of twenty per cent.
The Commons made no answer, although Wolsey called several
by name, till, losing patience, he exclaimed, "Masters, unless it
be the manner of your House (as very likely it may) by your
Speaker only in such cases to express your mind, here is without
doubt a most marvellous silence." Sir Thomas More, bending
the knee, replied, they felt abashed in the presence of so great a
personage; but, according to their ancient liberties, they were
not bound to make an answer. After his departure they agreed
to a tax of five per cent. Afterwards the Cardinal said, "Would
to God, Master More, you had been at Rome when I made you
Speaker."  "So would I too, my Lord."
    <p>Famous residents here include Cornelius Janssens; Vandyck from  <date value="1632">1632</date> till his death in  <date value="1641">1641</date> ; his daughter was born
here, and christened in St. Anne's Church. Ben Jonson was
living here in <date value="1607">1607</date>, and Carr, Earl of Somerset, and his Countess,
the divorced wife of the Earl of Essex, were living here when
Sir Thomas Overbury was poisoned in the Tower in <date value="1613">1613</date>.
    <p>The making of the bridge, in <date value="1769">1769</date>, covering over the
Fleet, and making of new streets have left nothing but memories
of the district. Probably the most tragic occurrence in Blackfriars was the terrible accident long known as the "Black
Vespers," when, of three hundred persons assembled in the
house of the French Ambassador, Count de Tillier, for the
     <pb n="56" id="p.56">





purpose of celebrating Mass, nearly a hundred were killed
by the collapse of the floor.  By the Catholics it was attributed
to a conspiracy of the Protestants; while they said, it was
"God's judgment on the idolaters."
    <p> Ludgate, of which the only fragment remaining is the statue
of Queen Elizabeth now on the front of St. Dunstan's, Fleet
Street, was, like other gates of London, long used as a prison.
A chapel was added to it by Sir Stephen Foster, "on a very
romantic occasion." He was confined there when a young man,
a handsome young fellow, and, while taking his turn of begging
at the grate, he was accosted by a rich widow, who asked what
sum would purchase his liberty ?  The amount was l20, and
the lady paid the money down, took him into her service, and
afterwards married him. He must have been cheap at the money,
for he rose to be Lord Mayor in <date value="1454">1454</date>; when he erected the
chapel, with an inscription, in honour of himself and his wife
Agnes, on a copper plate on the wall. It read :-
         <lb>"Devout soules that pass this way
           <lb>For Stephen Foster, late Major, heartily pray,
           <lb>And Dame Agnes his spouse, to God consecrate,
           <lb>That of pitie this house made for Londoners in Ludgate,
           <lb>So that for lodging and water, prisoners here nought pay,
           <lb>As their keepers all shall answer at dreadful Doomes day."
"These 'criers' or beggars were six in number, two whereof
daily beg at the grates; he at the grate is allowed one fourth
of what is given; he at the Blackfriars side, a moiety of what is
given there."
    <p> There was a gift by Nell Gwyn, a dole of bread, distributed
every ninth week: this dole of Nelly's could not have lasted
very long, as the Fire destroyed the gate, and it was not again
                                                       <pb n="57" id="p.57">





used as a prison, although some considerable part stood until
<date value="1760">1760</date>, when it is said to have been finally demolished.
    <p> Ludgate gave the conclusion to Wyatt's rebellion; a rising
against the proposed marriage of Mary to Philip of Spain. In
this matter Sir Thomas Wyatt was the catspaw of the Earl of
Devonshire. He assembled a body of men in Rochester Castle
and marched to Southwark. The Lord Mayor called a meeting
of the citizens, and Mary, with her sceptre in her hand, accompanied by her suite, entered the Guildhall, and besought the aid
of the city. Next morning twenty thousand men had enrolled
for the protection of the city. The batteries of the Tower compelled Wyatt to leave Southwark, and as all the bridges had been
destroyed he had to cross the river at Kingston, and so arrived
at Ludgate too late for aid from other conspirators. At Ludgate
he knocked and demanded admittance, "for the Queen had
granted all his petitions."  " Avaunt, traitor !" said the voice of
Lord William Howard; "thou shalt have no entrance here."
Disappointed, he retraced his steps as if lost in thought till
opposite the Bel Savage Inn, and after a little, with forty companions, fought his way back to Temple Bar. But whichever way
he turned there were soldiers; and after Norroy King-at-arms
advised him to spare the blood of his friends, he threw away
his sword and yielded to Sir Maurice Berkely, who carried him,
first to court, and then to the Tower, where he was soon joined
by his fellow-conspirators. The common men were hanged to
the number of fifty in London, a few in Kent; four hundred
were led with halters round their necks to the palace and pardoned by Mary; of those in the Tower five were condemned,
and four suffered, viz. the Duke of Suffolk, Lord Thomas Grey,
      <pb n="58" id="p.58">




William Thomas, and Wyatt himself. The Princess Elizabeth
was suspected of complicity in this affair, and was brought to
London from Ashbridge in a litter, she being unwell. She was
sent to the Tower, which filled her with terror. Protesting her
innocence she wrote, "As for the traitor Wyat, he might paraventur writ me a lettar, but on my faithe I never received any
from him;" while, as to a letter sent to the French king, "I
pray God confound me eternally if I ever sent him word, message,
token, or lettar by any menes." After a short period of detention in the Tower she was removed to Woodstock.

                         <div1 type="entry"><head>ST. PAUL'S</><p>

    <p>  From almost every street around, St. Paul's and its dome
 broods over the smaller works of men-the stone-work white
 as snow, where it faces the prevailing winds and rains ; or austere
 in its sooty dignity. Many schemes are propounded from time
 to time with the object of cleaning all the stone-work, but these
in- general have more zeal than knowledge; the authors of them
seem to believe that it is a mere question of removing soot, but
beyond that, they ought to know that certain " beds" of Portland stone, when exposed to the weather, exude a treacly glair,
which, even where there is no soot, sometimes acquires a colour
approaching crimson. It can be studied at Reforne Church,
Portland, which is absolutely exposed to all weathers. This
glair renders the stone weather-proof, and could not be removed
without serious injury to the building. In London, with the
added carbon, it assumes a purply black; but it is not a mere
accident that renders one stone grey and another black on the
                                                      <pb n="59" id="p.59">




sheltered sides of city churches ; it merely shows that the stones
come from different layers, maybe in the same quarry, and if
this varnish were removed it is probable that the unprotected stone
would "weather " at a much quicker rate. What an immensity
of labour must have been required to transport the stone for St.
Paul's and all Wren's city churches, without modern cranes and
appliances, from Portland Island to London, even though it was
hewn into shape there-a method we are inclined to think
quite modern; but evidence of the practice by Wren may be
seen in various segments of columns still lying rough hewn under
the east cliff, where the "King's Quarry," from which all this
stone came, was lately re-opened.
    <p>In the iron screen round the churchyard we see the last
large employment of south country iron, before the Black
Country moved from what now seem idyllic scenes to the
Midlands and the coalfields.
    <p> St. Paul's has had a long and varied history since the
Romans had a temple there ; and in the hazy times of Dunwallo,
a son of Brut, it is said, "In London, then called Troy, he
builded a great temple, which some suppose to be St. Paul's,
and was buried there."  In the twelfth year of the reign of
William the Conqueror, "was holden a great synod of the
clergy of the land at St. Paul's Church in London ; where, among
many other things ordeyned for the rule of the church in
England, dyvers Bishoppes seas were translated from one place to
another, as Selwye to Chichester, Kyzton to Exeter, Welles to
Bath, Sherborne to Sarisbury, Dorchester to Lyncolne, and the
sea of Lichfield to Chester."
    <p>The church suffered much and often from fire. In <date value="1136">1136</date>,

"St. Paul's Church was brent by fier; yt began at London
Bridge, and continued burning to the Danes' Church, now called
St. Clement's, about Temple Bar."  In <date value="1442">1442</date> the steeple was set
on fire by lightning, "and at last quenched by the labour and
great diligence of many men." In <date value="1561-06-">June 1561</date>, "a terrible tempest
and lightning did much harm to St. Paul's Church, which was
set on fire and first kindeleth at the top of the steeple, which
was 200 feet high from the battlements of the stone-work, and
burned downward so terribly and so vehemently that within less
space than three hours the steeple and four great roofs were
burnt and the timber of the nether aisles was utterly consumed
and burnt to ashes, to the great terror and fear of all beholders.
    <p> "The Queen's Majestie being much grieved for the loss of so
beautiful a monument, directed her highness' letters to the Mayor,
willing him to assemble the citizens to take some order for special
aid for the repairing again of the said monument. She gave in gold
1000 mark, and a warrant to take timber out of Her Majesty's
woods 1000 loads ; the citizens granted three fifteenths, the clergy
of the province of Canterbury one sixtieth of their benefices;
the clergy of London three tenths. Within one month following
the burning, the four great roofs were covered with boards, and
before the year was ended all the side aisles of the church were
made and framed new and main timber and covered with lead;
the same year the great roof of the west end was framed and made
of new and great timber in Yorkshire, brought to London by sea,
set up and covered with lead; the whole roof of the east end
was made in Yorkshire, and brought to London by sea, yet by
estimation of wise men 10,000 pounds more than is granted will
not perfect and finish the church and steeple in such sort as it
                                                      <pb n="61" id="p.61">





was before the burning thereof; which for the beautifying of the
city were well to be wished."
    <p> This was succeeded by the Gothic cathedral designed by
Inigo Jones, which was consumed in the Great Fire of <date value="1666">1666</date>,
giving Sir Christopher Wren his great opportunity, which he so
worthily used in building the cathedral we now see. It was
built in thirty-five years under one architect, one master mason
(Mr. Strong), and one bishop (Dr. Henry Compton).
    <p> The dignity of the great mass is beyond question, yet it
always seems to strike those who look on it for the first time as
small, compared with what they expected; this feeling dies away
on each repeated visit, and ends by giving the impression of a
mountain of stone. The cathedral and space surrounding it,
known as St. Paul's Churchyard, have witnessed many strange
sights; meetings of the citizens, preachings at Paul's Cross, proclamations, riots, and executions. The body of Richard II.,
killed at Pontefract, and carried bare-faced all the way to the
Tower of London "so that all men might see he was dead,"
was exposed here, "and from ye Tower he was brought through
ye citie of London, and set down in St. Paul's church bare-faced,
and there 'stode' eleven days that men might see him, and from
thence carried to Langley, and was there buried in the house of
Freres."
    <p> Only one coronation is recorded, namely, the re-coronation
of Henry VI. after his nine years' confinement in the Tower by
Edward IV. The Earl of Warwick bore his train and the Earl
of Oxford his sword-this was in October; on the 10th March
following, Edward returned, captured Henry in the Bishop's house
at St. Paul's, and sent him to the Tower once more; then assembling      <pb n="62" id="p.62">




 a great army proceeded to Gladmore Heath, near Barnet,
where he defeated his supporters, under the Earl of Warwick,
with great slaughter. In 1529 the Bishop of London caused a
great many New Testaments translated by William Tyndale to be
burned in Paul's Churchyard. In February 1538, three servants
of Prince Edward-John Jones, John Potter, and William Mannering-were hanged in the Prince's liveries, on the south side
of St. Paul's, for killing Roger Chalmleye, Esqr., in the same place.
In <date value="1570">1570</date> one John Felton, a respectable Catholic citizen of
Southwark, for posting a Bull by the Bishop of Rome upon the
Bishop of London's gate beside the west door of St. Paul's, was
hanged, dismembered, disembowelled, his members and bowels
burnt, beheaded and quartered, right before the Bishop's gate;
his head set on London Bridge, and his four quarters on the city
gates. It is difficult to see how they could have done any more
to him.
    <p>The history of the present cathedral, its tombs, and the
illustrious dead that lie there, are of common knowledge.
    <p>Paul's Cross stood at the east end of the church. The site
is partially covered by the present building. When Henry VIII.
was qualifying for his title of Defender of the Faith, by his
argument with Luther-who stigmatised the King as a fool and
an ass, a blasphemer and a liar-Wolsey, attended by other
prelates and ambassadors, proceeded to Paul's Cross. The
Bishop of Rochester preached, and the works of Luther were
burnt in the presence of the people, and it was here that
Elizabeth Barton, a foolish, epileptic young woman, who had
taken to prophecy, was, with several priests, condemned by the
Star Chamber to do penance and confess her impostures, before
                                                    <pb n="63" id="p.63">





being taken back to prison and executed at Tyburn. This was
the first episode in the downfall of Fisher and More. They
were both accused of misprision of treason because they had
heard the ravings of this young woman and had not informed
the King.  Fisher was put under attainder and fined &pound;300.
More had ceased to be Chancellor, and was now allowed to
retire from the Council. Sir Thomas Audeley got his place,
and More retired to Chelsea, but in a fortnight was summoned
to Lambeth and committed to the Tower, where Fisher, in his
seventy-seventh year, was reduced to such a state of destitution,
that he was compelled to solicit from Henry clothes to cover his
nakedness, while More was supported by the charity of friends,
conveyed to him by his daughter Margaret, who watched and
tended her father to the end-on <date value="1535-06-01">June 1, 1535</date>, when he was
brought to trial at Westminster, having to walk thither, clothed
in a coarse, woollen gown, and supporting his feeble steps with
a staff, to stand a long and tedious trial, and after condemnation
walk back to the Tower. It is some two and a half miles each
way. It is little wonder that his daughter twice broke through
the guards to fold him in her arms and help him a little on his
way. When told that the King, in his mercy, had commuted
his punishment to beheading, "God preserve all my friends
from such favours," he replied.
    <p> A tumult at Paul's Cross took place in <date value="1533">1533</date>, when Bourne,
one of the royal chaplains, was preaching, and in the course
of his sermon made some remarks on late innovations. "Pull
him down," said a voice in the crowd, and a dagger violently
thrown struck one of the columns of the pulpit. Bourne
fled for his life into St. Paul's Church, protected by Bradford
      <pb n="64" id="p.64">





and Rogers, two preachers who later came to the fire at Smithfield.
    <p> The Sunday after the coronation of Mary, the Papal legate,
Cardinal Pole, entered London at the invitation of the citizens.
Bishop Gardiner preached at Paul's Cross a sermon in which he
bitterly lamented his conduct under the late King; and exhorted
all who had fallen, through his means or in his company, to rise
with him and seek the unity of the Catholic Church. At the
south-west angle of St. Paul's stood the Church of St. Gregory;
this was not rebuilt after the fire. One account says that this
was the church where the body of St. Edmund was brought in
1010, remaining there for three years. On the north, towards
Newgate Street, is a maze of narrow streets and alleys largely
rebuilt in recent times, but still containing a fair proportion of
seventeenth-century buildings; at the eastern end "the boy of
Panyer's Alley" still keeps watch on the city's highest ground;
towards the west Warwick Lane marks the site of the town
house of the "King-maker."  It was at the Bell Inn in this
street that Archbishop Leighton died; having his desire that he
should die at an inn "like a pilgrim going home, to whom all
this world was as an inn," leaving his well-chosen library to the
diocese of Dunblane, "that country being ill-provided with
books."  This good man's father, a physician, wrote a tract,
Sion's Plea against Prelacie," in 1628; two years afterwards,
for this, he was publicly whipped at Westminster, set in the
pillory, one side of his nose slit, one ear cut off, one cheek
branded, with a hot iron, S.S. (Sower of Sedition), the whole to
be repeated on the other side of his face the following week
in Cheapside, to be fined 10,000, and to be perpetually
                                                    <pb n="65" id="p.65">






imprisoned in the Fleet, where he remained till released by the
Long Parliament, eleven years after.
    <p>A view of St. Paul's from Queen's Head Passage is given;
here, on the west side, stood Dolly's Chop House. It was
No. 8; a famous tavern kept by Richard Tarleton, a stage clown
of Queen Elizabeth's time. The tavern was known as "The
Queen's Head." It is often mentioned under its later name in
the literature of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; by
Carey, in "Polly Peachum," in "Humphry Clinker," and it
preserved its vogue down to Macaulay's day. Gainsborough
painted a portrait of the cook.


    <div1 type="entry"><head>              THE RIVER FLEET</>

    <p> The Fleet formed the western boundary of the city, tidal,
as far as Holborn Bridge, and carried barges of considerable
burthen. There were drawbridges in London Bridge, so that
sea-going ships could pass and discharge at the mouth of this
river; over it were four stone bridges, and there were extensive
quays; it received much of the drainage, and was scoured and
kept open at vast expense. In <date value="1606">1606</date>, 28,ooo was spent for
that purpose alone ; but finally becoming an unbearable nuisance
it was covered over, and made into a sewer.
    <p> As early as <date value="1543">1543</date>, by an Act of Parliament, power was given
to the city to bring water to the conduits from Hampstead Heath,
St. Mary-le-Bone, Hackney, and Muswell Hill, and to indemnify
the owners of lands for damages in making the watercourses.
As the city continued to grow, in spite of the many restrictions
      <pb n="66" id="p.66">




on the building of new houses, every brook and pond was
annexed to the water-supply, but in vain. Elizabeth issued an
order that " The citie of London, the suburbs and confines, do
increase daily by access of people in such ample sort as thereby
many inconveniences are seen already . . . where there are such
multitudes of people brought to inhabit in small rooms, whereof
great part are seen very poor, yea such as live by begging and
worse means, and they, heaped up together and in sort
smothered with many families of children and servants in one
house or small tenement, it must needs follow, if any plague
or popular sickness should by God's permission enter amongst
those multitudes, that the same would not only spread itself and
invade the whole city and confines," &amp;c.
    <p>"For remedy whereof as time may now serve, the Mayor and
Council shall see that they desist and forbear from any new
buildings or tenements within three miles of the gates of the
city. All persons who attempt the contrary, all manner of workmen, shall be committed to close prison, without bail, until they
give bonds on reasonable sums of money; all manner of stuff
brought to the place for new buildings shall be converted and
employed for the public use." There were many edicts afterwards, enforced with great severity for a time, but all failing
in their object. The Fleet and other springs at Hampstead
were, late in the eighteenth century, collected into a chain of
ponds and brought to London in two pipes; this supply is now
used for washing the streets. It could never have been good
water, being strongly impregnated with iron.
     <p>The source of the Fleet is in private grounds, and is probably as little altered in all the years as anything pertaining to
                                                     <pb n="67" id="p.67">





London. It is just beyond the bridge shown in the drawing
(No. 19).
     <p>This bit of forest land, known as Caen Wood (possibly
taking its name from the monkish builder from that city), has
fine oaks and beeches, and the badger still has his "holt"
among the tangle of bracken, bramble, and age-long undergrowth; it is the finest piece of old woodland near London.
The pond shown in the drawing is the first of the chain, which
extends down the valley between Highgate and Hampstead, and
into these all the springs and surface water on both sides are
gathered. This wood had its part in history, as being for a
time the shelter of that curious band of fanatics known as Fifth
Monarchy men. These men, dissatisfied with the Restoration,
assembled in a meeting-house in Coleman Street, whence, led
by their preacher, Venner, a cooper, they marched to St. Paul's
Churchyard, declaring for the personal reign of Jesus Christ and
that all oaths and monarchies were illegal. They numbered
fifty or sixty, and killed a man who declared for King Charles.
The Mayor and trainbands followed them in a game of hide-and-seek, varied by occasional homicide, out at one gate and back
by another ; finally they came to Caen Wood, where they reposed
themselves. They were chased, and certain of them arrested
here on the following day; but on the day afterwards, with some
additions to their ranks, they left their harbourage and marched
on the city. In Wood Street there was a small battle, in which
Venner was wounded and two other preachers killed. They
retreated through Cripplegate and dispersed: twenty troopers
were killed, and several of the trainbands, while of themselves
twenty were killed, fourteen captured, and of these eleven
     <pb n="68" id="p.68">




were hanged. So ended the only purely religious rising of that
time in England.
     <p> Farringdon Memorial Hall stands on the site of the Fleet
 Prison, notorious as a place of confinement, and the precincts
 for the irregular marriages celebrated there.
     <p> Pennant says: "Walking along the street, in my youth,
 on the side next the prison, I have often been tempted by the
 question, 'Will you be pleased to walk in and be married ?'
 Along this most lawless space was hung up the frequent sign of a
 male and female hand conjoined, with 'Marriages performed
 within' written beneath.  A dirty fellow invited you in, the
 parson was seen walking before his shop, a squalid profligate
 figure, clad in a tattered plaid night-gown, with a fiery face,
 and ready to couple you for a dram of gin or roll of tobacco."
     <p>The prison lives for us in the pages of Dickens, and
descriptions abound in other writings.  For centuries, most
of the writers had, at one time or other, made the acquaintance of its interior, and they were able to describe it intimately.
After the Fleet was covered in, the space became a marketplace for a time, and all semblance of its olden days has been
swept away.
     <p>A winding lane leads up into the "Old Bailey," Sea Coal
Lane recalling the days of shipping and sea-borne coal. Somewhere in the lane stood the Inn of Chancery which, when
removed, became the "New Inn" in Wych Street; its position
here had become remote from lawyers' haunts, and the house
had decayed.



<pb n="69" id="p.69">





                  <div1 type="entry"><head>NEWGATE PRISON</>

    <p>Coming into the "Old Bailey," we are, or rather were, confronted with Newgate Prison and the Sessions House, black,
gaunt, and grim; it, certainly, of all the buildings of London,
looked its part. No one could mistake its purpose, and withal
it had a dignity that seems lacking in the new building;
perhaps time and London smoke will add that in the course
of years. No trace remains of Green Arbour Court, where
Goldsmith lived, nor of the house which the Sidneys had
here, before their removal to Leicester Fields. The prison and
the Church of St. Sepulchre are the two features of the scene.
    <p>The church, dedicated to the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem,
was rebuilt in the reign of Henry VI. or Edward IV. Popham,
Chancellor of Normandy, was one of its great benefactors.
Restored after the Great Fire, when the nave and chancel
were much injured; the tower and porch escaped, but both
have since been worked upon.
    <p>In the church are buried Roger Ascham, tutor to Queen
Elizabeth; Sir Robert Peake, who in the Civil War held Basing
House for Charles I.; and Captain John Smith, "who perhaps
underwent more romantic adventures, and deeds of arms, than
any man who ever existed, rested here, in <date value="1631">1631</date>, from his turmoils. I refer to his history for his wonderful acts of chivalry,
for the kindness he experienced among the Turks, from the
beauteous lady ' Tragebysonda,' the charitable lady ' Calamata,'
and the blessed 'Pochahontas,' the great King of Virginia's
daughter." The learned historian seems inclined to poke fun
     <pb n="70" id="p.70">








at some of Captain Smith's adventures. Certainly his sweethearts
had very long names. The story of Pocahontas had some
foundation; that lady did come to England, and after a brief
experience was laid to rest at Greenwich. One kind-hearted
donor, also a Smith, left l36 by the year to this church, "to
help poor maids to husbands, and to put poor children
apprentice." One can easily understand how the latter could
be applied, but the first is rather puzzling. John Rogers, the
vicar, was one of the first victims at Smithfield in Mary's reign.
     <p>Newgate, as a prison, is of very ancient date; the first of
the name, succeeding one of Roman times, is supposed by John
Stow to have been erected between 1108 and 1128, when
Richard Beauveyes, Bishop of London, enlarging the precincts
of St. Paul's when rebuilding that church, after it was burned
in 1086, closed the way by Ludgate. There was no other way
out of the city westward, except by ways round about and
dangerous to horse and man: this gate was made, and retained
its title to the last.
     <p>"The gate hath been a prison for felons and other offenders
since the reign of King John, and for persons of rank, long
before the Tower was used for that purpose." In 1218 King
Henry III. called on the Sheriffs of London to repair the gate.
In 1241 the Jews of Norwich (this seems to mean all of them)
were hanged for "circumcising" a Christian child; their house
pulled down and destroyed; and Aaron the son of Abraham,
a Jew of London, with several more of his people, were sentenced
to pay 20,000 marks at two payments within a year, or be
kept perpetual prisoners in Newgate (thus making the community responsible for its members).
                                                  <pb n="71" id="p.71">





     <p>In 1255, John Offerem, a prisoner who had killed a prior
related to the Queen, made his escape out of Newgate. King
Henry III. was much displeased thereat, and called on the Mayor
and Sheriffs to justify themselves, "for though they had given
leave to imprison the offender in the jail of Newgate, yet they
had failed to see him safely kept."  To make them  more
careful, he sent them all to the Tower for a month, and fined
the city 3000 marks. In 1326, Robert Baldock, the King's
Chancellor, was put into Newgate, and ended his days there.
     <p>In 1327, Sir John Poultney gave four marks for the relief of
the prisoners; in 1383, Sir William Walworth gave somewhat
for the same purpose.
     <p>In 1414, the jailors of Newgate and Ludgate died of jail
fever, and sixty-four prisoners in Newgate shared the same fate.
     In 1422, Henry VII. gave leave to John Coventre, Jenken
Carpenter, and William Grove, executors of Richard Whittington, to re-edify the jail, with funds left by him for that purpose.
     <p>Thomas Knowles, Mayor of London, by licence of Reynold, Prior of St. Bartholomew, and John Wakering, Master
of the Hospital, conveyed the waste of water at the cistern
near the common fountain of the Chapel of St. Nicholas, to the
jails of Newgate and Ludgate, for the relief of the prisoners.
     <p>"In 1457, a great fray was in the north country between
Sir Thomas Percy, Lord Egremond, and the Earl of Salisbury's
sons, in which many were maimed and slain. Lord Egremond
being taken, was, by the King's Council, found very much in
fault, and condemned in great sums of money, meanwhile to be
kept in Newgate.
    <p>"Not long after, Egremond and Sir Richard Percy, his
    <pb n="72" id="p.72">




brother, broke out in the night, and went to the King.  Other
prisoners took the 'leads' from the gates, and defended it long
against the sheriffs and officers, but finally all submitted and
were laid in irons."
     <p>A list of donations to the prison (little food was supplied
by the authorities) range from l10 by Sir Thomas Gresham
to 3/4d. by James Smith, a fisherman; 17 stones of beef and
five dozen bread from the Ironmongers' Company, per Margaret
Deane.
     <p>The prison as rebuilt by the executors of Whittington re-
mained, with the statue of that great man and his cat, until its
final demolition on the rebuilding of the prison which has just
disappeared.
     <p>Pennant, writing in 1790, says: "The new prison, which
retains the name of 'Newgate,' from  the gate which, till
within the last few years, formed a part of it . . . a massy
building, with an extensive front of rustic work, and all the
appearance of strength and security. Yet, in the infamous riots
of 1780, the felons confined even in the strongest holds were
released, stones two and three tons weight, to which the doors
of their cells were fastened, were raised by a resistless species of
crowbar, well known to housebreakers by the name of 'pig's
feet.' Such was the violence of the fire, that the great bars of the
windows were eaten through and the adjacent stones vitrified."
     <p>In 1740 a point was settled with the keeper of Newgate
in regard to the transportation of felons. It was "that the
keeper should deliver them to the merchant 'who contracted to
carry them over,' at the door of Newgate, and there discharge
himself of any further custody, but leaving him and his officers
                                                   <pb n="73" id="p.73">





the privilege of 'protecting' them  down to the waterside,
according to any private agreement between him and the mer-
chant, it being fully understood that the sheriff should not be
responsible for their charge from the time of their first delivery."
Another custom may be noted: " On the 20th March, being
Easter Eve, the sheriffs attended the Lord Mayor through the
streets, to collect charity for the prisoners in the city prisons,
according to annual custom."
     <p>The first stone of the edifice was laid by the patriotic
Beckford, when Lord Mayor, in 1770, and the prison was nearly
finished and partly occupied when, in the riots of 1780, it was
assailed by the Gordon rioters, and almost everything com-
bustible destroyed. The ravages were made good by Parliament,
and the prison finally completed about 1782. The newspapers
of May 16, 1905, relate the finding of the foundation-stone
during the demolition. It contained some silver coins. The
architect was Dance, who also designed the Mansion House.
     <p>Its existence of nearly a thousand years as a prison made
it a place fraught with many memories. The names of most
of the unfortunate beings are forgotten, but a few still remain
-Claude Duval, Dick Turpin, and Jack Sheppard (who
broke out, but was soon recaptured), Sackville and Wither,
the poets; Penn for street preaching, Defoe for publishing
his "Shortest Way with Dissenters," Greenacre, Courvoisier,
and countless others.  Jack Sheppard was painted here by Sir
James Thornhill, and the operation was drawn by Hogarth.
     Dr. Dodd preached his own funeral sermon in the chapel
before he was hanged for forgery (the same "divine" conducted
the service at the inauguration of the "Freemason's Tavern").
      <pb n="74" id="p.74">





Lord George Gordon was imprisoned for a libel on the Queen
of France, and died within the walls, and William Cobbett
spent a considerable time here. But the goodliest figure of all
was Mrs. Fry labouring amongst the unfortunate prisoners. Her
account of their condition in 1838 describes a terrible state
of affairs.
     <p> When executions at Tyburn ceased, in 1784, they took
 place here, the last public execution being that of Michael
 Barrett, for the Clerkenwell explosion in 1868. A letter to
 the Times by Charles Dickens was the means of putting an
 end to these repulsive exhibitions. They took place over the
 nearest door shown in the drawing, called the "Debtors' Door."
 After they became private a black flag used to be hoisted over
 the near corner of the prison, to denote that the penalty of the
 law had been paid.
     <p>St. Sepulchre's bell was tolled, and that church clock gave
the hour. Formerly a nosegay was presented at this church to
each condemned prisoner on the way to execution at Smithfield,
Lincoln's Inn Fields, Tyburn, or St Giles' Fields.
     <p>In 1612 Robert Dow, a merchant tailor, left a yearly sum
of 26s. 8d., that the bellman of St. Sepulchre's should deliver
from the churchyard wall, "a most pious and awful admonition "
to the prisoners as they went by in the cart; and another in
the prison of Newgate on the night before they suffered.
     <p>This admonition ran as follows:-
                  <lb> "Ye prisoners that are within,
                  <lb> Who for wickedness and sin,
after many mercies shewn you, are now appointed to die tomorrow, in the forenoon.   Give ear, and understand that
                   <pb n="75" id="p.75">


The failure of the ghost led to the prosecution of
Parsons, who was clerk of St. Sepulchre's Church, and he
was imprisoned for twelve months, and had to stand three
times in the pillory; but the people retained their faith in
the ghost; and, instead of maltreating him, raised a subscription
for his benefit.
<p>The house of the famous Bishop of Salisbury, Burnet,
stood on the west side of St. John's Square until about thirty
years ago, when it was pulled down.
<p>After the dissolution the priory was granted to the Earl
of Aylesbury, who had a house there; and in the vicinity
resided the Earl of Berkeley, and the Duke of Newcastle,
with his wife, the semi-learned lady who figures in the pages
of Pepys. Their monument in Westminster Abbey, erected
by the lady, recites that "Here lies the Loyal Duke of Newcastle and his Duchess," adding in her own words, that,
"her name was Margaret Lucas ... of a noble family, for
all the brothers were valiant and all the daughters virtuous."
She published many volumes, and when an old woman always
had a "secretary-footman" to sleep in her dressing-room;
when some fine thought germinated in the night, he was
called up, to light a candle and commit the fugitive piece of
wisdom to paper before it was forgotten.
<p>The names of many of the adjoining streets commemorate
the names of the great families who had houses near by, or
had received portions of land from the spoils of the Church.







<div1 type="entry"><head>THE CHARTERHOUSE</><p>

At the north-east corner of Smithfield Market, with its
noise and tumult, a turning leads into Charterhouse Square.
A few old houses still remain, and many well-grown plane trees
in what is now a pleasant garden. This piece of ground, known
as "No Man's Land," lying outside the city wall, was in 1349
acquired by Stratford, Bishop of London, as a burying-place
for victims of the plague in that year, and to relieve the pressure
on the city graveyards.
<p>"In this year there was so great a death in the city of
London by pestilence, that over and beside the bodies buried
in the several churches and churchyards, monasteries and other
accustomed burial-places in London, there were buried in ye
Charterhouse churchyard, near unto Smithfield, 50,000 persons
and above. The which report I think the rather to be
true, for I myself (Grafton) in my life time have read the
like report, graven in a piece of brass upon a stone cross in
the said Charterhouse churchyard." There being no time for
any religious ceremony at their burial, the same Bishop afterwards built a chapel in which prayers might be perpetually
offered for the souls of the departed. In 1371 a Carthusian
convent was founded there, "The House of the Salutation of
the Mother of God," and this remained until the dissolution.
The prior, Haughton, expressed himself somewhat plainly about
the spoliation of the church by Henry VIII.
<p>"On the 29th day of April, the Prior of the Charter-house in London, the Prior of Beauciel, the Prior of Exham,
<pb n="102" id="p.102">




and a friar of Sion (Brentford) called Reynolds, and John Hayle,
vicar of Chiselworth, were all condemned of treason for denying
the King's supremacy, and were judged at Westminster to be
drawn, hanged, and quartered, which judgment was executed
at Tyburn the 4th day of May next following."
Several other brethren of the Charterhouse were executed
afterwards, and ten starved to death in Newgate. The manner
of their treatment in Newgate may be gathered from a letter
to Cromwell from one of the visitors, quoted by Lingard:
"My very good Lord, after my most hearty commendations, it shall please your lordship to understand that the
monks of the Charter House here at London, committed to
Newgate for their treacherous behaviour continued against the
King's grace, be almost despatched by the hand of God, as
it may appear to you by this bill enclosed. Wherefore, considering their behaviour, and the whole matter, I am not sorry;
but would that all such as love not the King's highness, and
his worldly honour, were in like case. There be departed,
Greenwood, Davye, Salte, Peerson, Grene; there be at the
point of death, Scriven, Reading ; there be sick, Jonson, Home;
one is whole, Bird." The remainder fled to Bruges.
Sir Thomas More, imprisoned in the Tower at the same
time, had lived for four years in the Charterhouse, while he
still wavered between religious orders and a career as a courtier,
and had kindly thoughts of those days. Seeing the prior and
others pass his prison window on the way to Tyburn and
the doom that awaited them, he remarked to his daughter : " Lo,
dost thou not see, Meg, that these blessed fathers be now as
cheerfully going to their deaths as bridegrooms to their
<pb n="103" id="p.103">





marriage?" The head of Haughton was set on London Bridge,
and one of his limbs over the gateway of his own convent, "as
a bloody sign to awe the remaining brethren to obedience."
This is the present gateway, the lower part of which is of
stone, and much older than the superstructure, which was built in
the early years of the eighteenth century. After some time the
place was given by Henry VIII. to Sir Thomas Audley, who sold
it to Sir Edward North ; he sold it to Dudley, Earl of Northumberland, on whose attainder and execution, in 1553, it again by
grant of the Crown reverted to Lord North, who died here in
1564. On the death of Queen Mary, "shortly after the proclamation, the Queen's Majesty, being then lodged at her private
house at Hatfield, came from thence to London and rested in the
house of Lord North, which sometime was called the Charterhouse, and abode five days, and from thence removed to the Tower
of London, where she remained until the fourteenth day of
January next following, at which time she passed through
the city of London toward her coronation. In this mean
time the Mayor and citizens of London, having intelligence of
the day and time appointed for her highness' passage through the
city, did beautify the same; and when the day of her passage
was come, her highness being placed in her chariot within the
Tower, lifted up her eyes to heaven and said (doubtless remembering her previous imprisonment there) : O Lord Almighty
and everlasting God, I give Thee most hearty thanks that Thou
should have been so merciful to me as to spare me to behold
this joyful day, and to acknowledge that Thou hast dealt as
wonderfully with me as Thou didst with Thy true and faithful
servant Daniel the prophet, whom Thou delivered out of the
<pb n="104" id="p.104">


Denne from the cruelty of the greedy, raging lyons; even
so I was overwhelmed and only by Thee delivered. To Thee,
therefore, be only thanks, honour, and praise for ever, Amen."
She passed by Gracious Street, Cornhill, Soper Lane End, the
Little Conduit, and Fleet Street. On the way were five emblematic pageants. "And as she passed through Ludgate, one
near to her repeated the great charge that the city had been at,
to whom she gave worthy answer, that she well considered the
same, and that it would be remembered." Then the Mayor
presented her with a purse containing one thousand marks in
gold, with the hope "she would continue their good lady."
She gave answer " that if need be she would willingly in their
defence spend her blood."
<p>But to return to the Charterhouse. In 1565 it was sold
for l2800 by Roger, the second Lord North, to Howard, Duke
of Norfolk, who pulled down many of the monastic buildings and
added many rooms, including the noble hall-where at present
the Poor Brethren dine-to fit it for a nobleman's use. The
grand staircase is also of this date; but Norfolk lived no great
time to enjoy it, and on his attainder and execution for proposing
to marry Mary, Queen of Scots, it again reverted to the Crown.
Queen Elizabeth subsequently granted it to that Duke's second
son, afterwards Earl of Suffolk, the builder of Audley End, that
grand house in Essex. Lord Suffolk sold it to Thomas Sutton,
of Camp's Castle, Cambridgeshire-who had made a great fortune
in sea-borne coal-in 1611, for l13,000 ; and in the June following Sutton endowed it as a charity by the name of "The
Hospital of King James." The donor died in December of
the same year, before the work was completed, and was buried
<pb n="105" id="p.105">



in the chapel, beneath a sumptuous monument, the work of
Nicholas Stone (the sculptor of York House Water Gate) and
Mr. Jansen.
<p>Sutton's bequest of 200,000 for the purpose of charity
aroused much comment and heart-searching amongst great
people. Bacon wrote a tract against the scheme. "For to
design the Charterhouse-a building fit to be a prince's habitation-for an hospital is as if one should give in alms a rich
embroidered cloak to a beggar." The foundation adopted comprised, first, a hospital for pensioners, not to exceed eighty in
number, "who shall be gentlemen by descent, and in poverty;
soldiers that had borne arms by sea or land; merchants decayed
by piracy or shipwreck ; or servants in the household of the King
and Queen; to be fifty years and upwards, except those maimed
by wars, who may be admitted at forty." The school was to be
for children of poor parents; and was finally removed to the
country in 1872, the land being sold to the Merchant Taylors
for their school. The hospital remains as Sutton left it.
The scholars have included many names famous in history:
Isaac Barrow, Blackstone, Addison, Steele, John Wesley, Unwin,
the friend of Cowper, Chief Justice Ellenborough, Thomas Day
(the author of "Sandford and Merton"), W. M. Thackeray, Sir
Charles Eastlake, Grote the historian, General Havelock, John
Leech, and many others. Memorials to some of these are in
the cloisters.
<p>Washouse, or Poplar Court, is memorable from Thackeray's
description of it in " The Newcomes," one of these little houses
being the final setting of Colonel Newcome's life. The outer
wall of this court is part of the monastic work, and in the brickwork
<pb n="106" id="p.106">


 can be traced the cross and "I. H. S." The chapel, much
altered from time to time, is probably the chapel founded by
Stratford. In Strype's time part of it was used as a dwelling-house, and the square had become a garden. Several people of
note have lived in the square-Richard Baxter in 1686, and
another famous preacher, John Howe, died here in 1691.

<div1 type="entry"><head>
ST. BARTHOLOMEW THE GREAT AND
CLOTH FAIR</><p>

Cloth Fair still holds many ancient houses, but they are
getting fewer, and modern ideas of sanitation are bound to sweep
them all away before many years have passed. The street as we
know it was built after the dissolution of the monastic orders, and
became the headquarters of the cloth trade. It still retains
some fragments of that commerce; but the greater number
of the houses are now occupied by men engaged in the meat
market, and the shops of those catering or furnishing for the
same vast business. One house is called the Earl of Warwick's
house; whether any such Earl lived there is doubtful. His
ancestor might, when he bought the priory and wished to see it
converted into cash. Many of the houses are of timber, and it is
a marvel that they have remained there so long. The passages
and alleys are very narrow; in some-as "Back Passage"-
it is hardly possible to see the sky, and it is certainly the only
fragment by which one may see how ancient London was built.
Bearing a rather doubtful reputation amongst the police, I have
found none but honest folks, and every kindness while working
<pb n="107" id="p.107">



there. The public-house near one end, known as the "Dick
Whittington," remains, in its upper part, much as it has been;
but modern improvements have made it necessary to raise the
ceiling of the ground floor by taking half of the floor above.
The babes as corner trusses are a curious feature, and there
is a resemblance to the little figure in Panyer's Alley, but that
figure is in profile.
This house claims to be the oldest licensed house in the
city of London, dating back to the fifteenth century. No doubt
Dickens knew it, but careful search of his work has not revealed
any reference to it.
The cloth trade was one in which the English people were
very backward, and it was carefully fostered from very early
times. In 1336, at a Parliament held at Northampton, it
was enacted that whatever cloth-workers of Flanders or other
countries should dwell and inhabit in England, they should
come peaceably and quietly, and have most convenient places
assigned to them, with great liberties and privileges. In time
this had the desired effect, and by the middle of the sixteenth
century it is noted, "that the last year the carriage and sale
of wool out of the realm was forbidden, by reason whereof the
wool of the realm remained unoccupied and unwanted; and it
should also appear that at that time there lacketh clothiers to
drape ye said wool. But it is now otherwise, for clothmaking
is waxen so great as when clothiers have their open vent and
trade, then all the wool of the realm will scant suffice to keep
them in work; and it may well be thought also that our
countrymen at that time were not so skilful in clothmaking
as the strangers were."
<pb n="108" id="p.108">



<p>During Bartholomew Fair the court of "Pie Poudre" sat
in Cloth Fair, at the "Hand and Shears" tavern. There were
similar courts at many of the larger wakes and fairs throughout
the country-a few of them bearing the same title. They dispensed summary justice to all offenders frequenting the fair.
The regulations for this were: To keep the peace of our
sovereign lord the King-no conventicles, congregations, or
affrays. No unsealed measures for ale, wine, or beer, upon
pain that will fall thereof. No person shall sell bread except
it be good and wholesome for a man's body; no cook, pie-baker, or huckster to sell anything except it be good and
wholesome for a man's body; none except true weights and
measures. No person to arrest, attach, summon, or "execution" except the officers assigned. That no person within
the limits shall break the Lord's Day by selling, or offering,
or sitting, tippling, or drinking in ale-house, tavern, or inn.
An early use of the word "bagman" may be noted, when, on
the 1st September 1537 "one Cratwell, bagman of London,
and two persons more, were hanged at the wrestling place,
on the back side of Clerkenwell, for robbing of a booth in
Bartholomew Fair." Bartholomew Fair, like others, especially
near a great town, developed into a saturnalia. One of
George Cruikshank's most powerful etchings deals with it
under the guise of the "Devil's Frying-Pan," and before its
suppression it had long ceased to be anything except a "pleasure " fair.
<p>Even in that guise, at an earlier day, it suited the tastes
of our forefathers.
Carey, the author of the words and music of "Sally in
<pb n="109" id="p.109">


our Alley," gives us a glimpse of the tastes of the multitude
early in the eighteenth century. The occasion of the ballad
was a shoemaker's apprentice making holiday with his sweetheart. He treated her first with a sight of Bedlam, then they
went to the puppet shows, the flying chairs (an early form
of merry-go-round), and all the other shows of Moorfields,
from whence, proceeding to the "Farthing Pie-House," he
gave her a "collation of buns, cheesecakes, gammon of bacon,
stuffed beef, and bottled ale." Carey watched them through
it all, and certainly showed his genius in translating the day's
proceedings into the graceful ballad we know so well.
In 1593, the plague raging, Bartholomew Fair was forbidden, and for "vent" (vending) of woollen clothes, kersies,
and linen cloth, to be sold in gross, and not by retail, "the
same shall be brought within the close yard of St. Bartholomew . . . and have gates to shut the same place at night.
There such cloth shall be offered for sale. To continue for
three days only."
This privilege would provide an opportunity for merchants
to replenish their stock before the travelling vendor moved
on to other centres of commerce.
There are many narrow and crooked alleys on the east
of St. Bartholomew's, and a few, but very few, ancient timber
houses. And in Bartholomew Close there are still several old
houses; one now being pulled down is probably of Tudor
times. Most of them are used as warehouses, and the three
which would have been of greatest interest have gone. These
were 56, 57, and 58.
We do not know in what house Milton lived when he
<pb n="110" id="p.110">



retired here to his friends, after the Restoration, but he remained
here until the Act of Oblivion was passed; nor which was
the dwelling of Herbert le Seur, who modelled the statue of
Charles I, now at Charing Cross.
When Benjamin Franklin came to England on Christmas
Eve, 1724, he worked in the Lady Chapel of St. Bartholomew's for S. Palmer, a printer who had succeeded Thomas
Roycroft, grandson of the printer of the Polyglot Bible.
Thomas Roycroft the elder worked at 56. At 57 was Mr.
Downing, also a printer, next door to whom, according to the
parish register, William Hogarth was born in 1697. No. 58
was then in the occupation of Widow Gibbons, with whom
apparently Hogarth's parents lodged. These three numbers
are now a modern warehouse. Yet, in the exasperating way
these things happen, the next houses nearer the church are
untouched. Local tradition has forgotten the facts, or probably the history would attach itself to the nearest old house;
but the researches of Mr. Webb, the churchwarden, have
rendered that impossible.
We would like to identify one house in this teeming city
as having been inhabited by Milton, Hogarth, or Franklin,
but it cannot be done. Of Milton there remains the cottage
at Chalfont St. Giles; of Hogarth, the little house at
Chiswick; and of Franklin, none. Even the streets where
he lived have vanished, and the Sardinian Chapel will soon
be gone. Inigo Jones, one of England's greatest architects, was
born in Cloth Fair, the son of a cloth-worker. Little Britain
and its surroundings figure largely in Dickens's "Great Expectations," and when Samuel Johnson was brought to London to
<pb n="111" id="p.111">



be touched by Queen Anne for "king's evil," his mother
lodged with Nicolson, a bookseller in Little Britain.
Little Britain is now the headquarters of the gold and
silver lace-workers; formerly a centre of the book trade.
It was here that the Earl of Dorset discovered "Paradise
Lost," and used his influence to make the poet famous-so
the story is told. If Milton got fame, he got not much
else from it. During the year 1664, over four hundred
books and pamphlets were published in Little Britain. By
that time the pamphlet was one of the favourite weapons in
the struggle for liberty that had lasted so long and been
gained so hardly by the citizens. The Government and the
Church had always regarded the man with the pen with a
jealous eye, while the man with the printing-press was a
"fearful wildfowl," when not working under their supervision.
Even at so late a time as 1639, the Star Chamber issued a
set of orders for the regulation of the press. It forbade,
first, "The importation and sale of books printed beyond
the seas, to the scandal of the Church, Government, governors
of Church or State, commonwealth, corporation, person, or
persons. Second, the printing of any book unless it was first
lawfully licensed, upon pain that the printer should be disabled
from exercising the mystery of printing, and receive such
other punishment as the aforesaid two courts should inflict.
Third, all books of the law should be licensed by the
Chief Justice or the Chief Baron; books of history and
State affairs, by one of the Secretaries of State; books of
heraldry, by the Earl Marshal; books of divinity, philosophy,
physic, poetry, and other subjects, by the Archbishop, or the
<pb n="112" id="p.112">



Bishop of London, or the chancellors or vice-chancellors of
the universities (all these might appoint licencers under them).
Fourth, that every printer should affix his own name and the
name of the author to every book, ballad, or portraiture by him.
Fifth, that there should be no more than twenty master printers,
besides those of his Majesty and the universities; no printer
should have more than two presses or two apprentices, unless
he were warden of the company. Sixth, that if any other person
presumed to print or work at a press or compose letters, he
should be set on the pillory, be whipped through the city of
London, and suffer other discretionary punishment. Seventh,
that there should be no more than four letter-founders allowed."
For one year, 1679-80, the Licensing Act was allowed to
lapse. Authors and printers availed themselves of their freedom,
but the judges soon sternly repressed that.
Through the long centuries after the Conquest the citizens
were used by the kings as a source of money; and by using their
needs the guilds and merchants slowly, slowly dragged their
liberties from the claws of contending factions, and in time were
able, to some extent, to guard their own; but it was a weary,
long time before this end was reached. In 1683 Charles II.
seized the liberties of the city, on the grounds that the
city had imposed an arbitrary tax on merchandise brought to
public market and circulated a printed petition, saying that the
King, "by the prorogation of Parliament had interrupted the
provisions necessary for the preservation of himself and his
Protestant subjects." The first was declared contrary to law,
and the second a libel on the King. The city pleaded that the
rates were reasonable and lawful by custom and charter, and
<pb n="113" id="p.113">


that if, by either of these acts, any offence had been committed,
it should be visited on the individuals themselves, and not on the
freemen, numbering fifty thousand persons. The court pronounced "That the franchise and liberty of the city of London
should be taken and seized into the King's hands." After the
Common Council presented a petition expressing their deep
sorrow and contrition, the King gave them his pardon, allowed
the Lord Mayor to continue in office, appointed a new court of
aldermen, excluding eight who were obnoxious ; and the defunct
corporation resumed its duties.
It seems probable that the monarchial outburst by the
'prentices during the first year of the Commonwealth arose
quite as much from their stomachs as their loyalty. The
Parliament had great difficulty in raising funds for the army,
and at first raised loans in the city at 8 per cent., "pledging
the public faith for the repayment of the capital"; but this
was not enough, and was superseded by a weekly assessment of
10,000 on the city of London, and 24,000 on the rest of
the country. The estates of delinquents were sequestered, and
a new branch of taxation-the excise-was introduced. It
taxed strong beer, ale, cider, perry, wine, oil, figs, sugar,
raisins, pepper, salt, silk, tobacco, soap, strong waters, and flesh
meat exposed for sale or privately killed.
Beyond this, some patriots fasted voluntarily and paid the
saving into the Treasury. This gave a hint, and was presently
developed by ordinance, appointing commissioners to go through
the city and rate every housekeeper at one meal for each of the
family, the money to be collected every Tuesday for six months.
The 'prentices had already sweated in making the defences round
<pb n="114" id="p.114">


the city, when, every morning, thousands of the citizens were
summoned to the task of making these earthworks (twelve miles
in circuit), proceeding with drums beating and colours flying to
their appointed place, their wives and daughters accompanying
them, to aid and encourage them in their new and strenuous
labour. And now, to have a compulsory fast put upon them
was too much. The 'prentices caused tumults; they broke
through the guards, fought and quarrelled with the soldiers,
demanding that the King should be brought back and take charge
of his own again; but these small riots were summarily suppressed by Sir William Waller, the commander of the defences.
One of the first acts of James II., when he succeeded to the
throne, was to arrest Alderman Cornish, who had been somewhat zealous in searching out "Popish plots," cast him into
Newgate, and convict him on the evidence of two "infamous and
profligate villains," Col. Ramsay and Goodenough. Ten days
after his arrest, the worthy Alderman was hanged, drawn, and
quartered outside his own house in King Street, Cheapside.
Remembering this, one may have some clue to the feelings of
the Lord Mayor, when James sent for him after the Prince
of Orange landed at Torbay, "and earnestly recommended
to him the care of the city during his absence," marching away
gallantly to meet the invader, and returning precipitately in a
little time to London, "where, apprehending himself in great
danger, he resolved to provide for his security by abdicating his
throne and leaving the kingdom."
The continued interference by the court in the elections of mayors and aldermen seems to have been a feature
peculiar to Stuart times. Queen Elizabeth did interfere with
<pb n="115" id="p.115">



their clothes; as in 1580, when her Majesty issued a proclamation against excess of apparel, gold chains, and cloaks,
which the men wore down to their heels, and various expensive
trimmings, limiting also their daggers to twelve inches and their
swords to three feet in length. Perhaps the citizens were rather
extravagant, as two years later we find, "The Lord Mayor and
Council enacted, That no apprentice should presume to wear
any apparel, but what he receives from his master; no hat, but a
woollen cap; neither ruffles nor cuffes, loose collars, nor other
thing than a ruff at the collar; no doublets but what were made
of canvas, fustian, sackcloth, English leather or woollen, without gold, silver, or silk trimming; to wear no other colour in
hose or stockings than white, blue, or russet. Their breeches shall
be neither stitched, laced, nor bordered; a plain upper coat
of cloth or leather without pinking, stitching, edging, or silk
about it; no pumps, shoes, or slippers but of English leather,
without pinking or edging; no girdles or garters other than
crewel woollen or leather, without being garnished; no sword,
dagger, or other weapon but a knife; no ring, or jewel of gold
or silver, or silk on any part of his apparel." So that it was little
use for the 'prentice's sweetheart to make garnishings for him.
"That he shall not go to any dancing, fencing, or music schools,
nor keep any chest, press, or other place for keeping apparel or
goods, but in his master's house, under pain ot his master's
discretion for the first offence, being whipped at the hall of his
company for the second, and serving six months longer on his
indentures for the third offence." After that came the dungeons
known as "Little Ease" under the Guildhall.
Thirteen years later the apprentices of London, "having
<pb n="116" id="p.116">



been seduced by a set of incorrigible villains, now arrived at
such a pitch of insolence that the case was laid before her
Majesty," who issued a proclamation and arrested a great many.
These were tried at the Guildhall; five were condemned and
two executed on Tower Hill. One would like to imagine
Queen Bess with more sympathy towards lads of spirit. The
municipal government was severely paternal, and did not become
less rigorous with the passage of time. The masters, being
brought up on the strictest lines, handed it on to the next
generation. The instructions of Henry VIII.'s time seem strict
enough to keep them in the strait path.
"Ye shall constantly and devoutly on your knees, every
day, serve God, morning and evening, and make conscience in
the due hearing of the Word preached, and endeavour the right
practice thereof in your life and conversation. Ye shall do
diligent and faithful service to your master for the time of your
apprenticeship, and deal truly in what you shall be trusted. You
shall often read over the covenants of your indenture, and see
and endeavour to perform the same to the utmost of your power.
Ye shall avoid all evil company, and all occasions that may tend
to draw you to the same, and make speedy return when ye shall
be sent of your master or mistresses' business. Ye shall be of
fair, gentle, and lowly speech and behaviour towards all men,
especially to all your governors ; and, according to your carriage,
expect your reward for good or ill from God and your friends.-
<date value="1526-06-01">June 1st, 1526</date>."
<p>The Blue Coat School, for many a year one of the picturesque spots of the city, is being replaced by the huge and
ugly building of ferro-concrete, the extension of the Post Office.
<pb n="117" id="p.117">



Modern departments of the Government are not so careful in
nursing home industries as those of bygone days, else the home
quarryman and mason might have had some work from this.
Perhaps in twenty years' time, when Portland stone would be
putting on the tints so suitable to London, and becoming more
beautiful with the passage of years, this building, said to contain neither stone nor brick, with the exception of some stone
veneers, will be putting on the shabby look that seems the fate
of all cement buildings, and later generations may be sorry.
Part of it stands on historic ground.
<p>In 1224 there arrived at Dover four clerks and five lay
brothers, Friars Minors of the Franciscan order; five settled at
Canterbury, four came to London, where they were lodged by
the Friars Preachers at their house at Holborn for fifteen days,
when they removed to a house in Cornhill which they leased
from John Travers, one of the sheriffs. Here they remained about
a year, becoming much straitened for room by increase of their
number, which being observed by John Iwyn, a citizen and
physician (who afterwards became a lay brother among them) he
acquired from the Mayor and commonalty of the city of London
one plot or parcel of ground lying near to St. Nicholas' flesh
shambles, and appropriated it to the use of the Gray Friars, which
then came first into England, "where afterwards they builded
them a little house and a small church." In 1292, "died Queen
Eleanor, ye wife of Henry III. and mother to King Edward I.,
whose heart was buried at the Gray Fryers in London-which
was then a small church and afterwards made greater-and her
body was buried at Ambresbury, a house of the nonnes." In
1306, "This yere the new great church of the Gray Friars was
<pb n="118" id="p.118">



begun to be builded by Lady Margaret, Queen and wife to King
Edward I., who was afterwards buried in the same church, in
the upper part of the choir. John of Britein, Earl of Richmond,
builded ye body of the said church, and the residue was finished
by the Lady Mary, Countess of Pembroke; Gilbert de Clare,
Earl of Gloucester; Margaret, Countess of Gloucester; Elianor
de Spencer and Elizabeth Brugh, sisters to Gilbert de Clare; all
which was finished in two and twenty years. But the last founder
was King Henry VIII., who erected and ordeyned it to be a
parish church, and named it Christ's Church.
<p>"In 1364 died Lady Isobel, ye King's mother, wife to
Edward IV. and daughter of Philip le Beau, the French King,
and she was buried in London in the Friars Minors, commonly
called Gray Friars, right nobly and honourably, with all the
prelates and barons of England, and lords of France, that lay
here for hostages."
<p>In 1544 this church, with many others, was standing disused
"when there was taken by the King's ships in the west country
and upon the English coast the number of three hundred French
ships and more, so that Gray Friars church in London was laid
full of wyne, and the Austin Friars and Black Friars were laid
full of herrings and other fish that was taken going into France."
The following year, 1545, the church was given to the
Mayor and city of London, to be erected into a parish church
for the use of the inhabitants of the late parishes of St.
Nicholas and St. Ewyn, which were taken down by the
Mayor, and the Friars' church enlarged with the materials.
The church of St. Ewyn stood between the north-east corner
of Newgate Market and Warwick Lane. A part of the parish
<pb n="119" id="p.119">



of St. Sepulchre was added, and it was called by the name of
Christ's Church.
<p>Here, in 1665, was buried Sir Kenelm Digby, when he
was laid in the gorgeous tomb erected by him over the remains
of his wife, Venetia Stanley. By some means the church at a
later date came into the possession of Sir Martin Bowes, a goldsmith and alderman, who sold all the magnificent monuments of
marble and alabaster for 50. Some of these may even now
be masquerading under other names in other churches. This
vandalism was of small consequence, as they would undoubtedly
all have perished in the Great Fire. The church was rebuilt
by Wren in its present form.
<p>Among other persons of note buried in the present church
is Richard Baxter, the author of "The Saint's Rest," a much
persecuted man in his day. A few hundred yards away, in
Aldermanbury, his principal enemy, Judge Jeffreys, also sleeps
quiet enough, though not so honourably remembered.
The question of the poor was as insistent in 1551 as it
is to-day. Ever and again orders were issued for the removal
of foreign beggars (that is, beggars from another district) from
the city, and in that year the question was ordered to be investigated by the combined wisdom of the Lord Mayor and
Aldermen. By their decision, they divided the poor into three
classes, viz. the sick and decayed poor, the fatherless child and
the aged poor, the sturdy vagabond and the idle poor. For
the first they created St. Thomas's Hospital in Southwark, for
the second Christ's Hospital (known to us as the Blue Coat
School), and for the third class, Bridewell, and did also
provide five lazar-houses "for those who in times past did
<pb n="120" id="p.120">



go up and down the city clapping of dishes and ringing of bells,
or lay at the church doors." And, as the "noisomeness" of the
town ditch would interfere with the usefulness of Christ's
Hospital, "Master William Chester, alderman, and John Calthorp, drapers, at their own proper cost and charges, covered
and vaulted ye town ditch in brick, from Aldersgate to Newgate,
which before was loathsome and noisome to the said hospital."
Afterwards it was entirely filled up.
<p>The first endowment given to Christ's Hospital was by a
shoemaker of Westminster, famous for his industry and early
rising; his name was Richard Castell, and the gift was tenements
and lands in Westminster of the value of 44 per annum. A
later benefactor was Guy, the founder of the hospital now
bearing his name, but formerly the St. Thomas's Hospital
referred to before. He was a native of Horsleydown, a
bookseller and printer of Bibles, who made his immense
fortune by purchasing the prize tickets of seamen at a
large discount, and investing the proceeds in the South Sea
Company.
<p>The first eating-house of a genteel sort in London was,
in 1688, opened in Christ Church Passage (recently closed up
by the Post Office extension) by Mr. Pontack, a Frenchman of
Bordeaux; the public could bespeak dinners there from four
shillings to one guinea.
<p>In Newgate Street, nearly opposite the General Post Office,
and next to a new assurance office, is still pointed out the
site of John Gilpin's shop. What foundation Lady Austen had
for the story she told to Cowper we do not know; there
may have been such a "linen draper bold" who lived there;
<pb n="121" id="p.121">


but the story appears to rest on quite as slender a basis as that
of Tom Hood's "Epping Hunt," where-
<lb>"John Huggins was as bold a man
<lb>As ever trade did know;
<lb>A warehouse good he had that stood
<lb>Hard by the church of Bow."
At an earlier date Cheapside had other literary memories.
In this street in 1591 was born Robert Herrick, the author of
some of the daintiest verse in the English language. Presented
by Charles I. to the vicarage of Dean Prior in 1629, at the
Civil War he was deprived and came to London, where he
is said to have associated with Ben Jonson and his set; but
Jonson died in 1637, and Herrick's allusion to "lyric feasts
made at the Sun" must refer to earlier convivialities. Reinstated
at the Restoration, he died at Dean Prior in 1674.
St. Martin's le Grand was not always so peaceful a district
as now, with the busy Post Office, and its multitude of young
ladies swarming in and out of the door in Angel Street. When
Henry VII. built the chapel at Westminster "for a burial-place
for himself and his posterity," precisely enjoining that "none
but blood royal should be permitted to lie therein," he procured a bull from the Pope uniting to the abbey the church of
St. Martin's le Grand and 'the manor of Tykill, in Yorkshire,
to maintain a chantry of three monks, priests, and two lay
brothers, "to say mass for his soul daily and the souls of his wife
and children," for which service they were allowed a hundred
shillings yearly.
It probably had an earlier connection with the abbey, as the
place was a sanctuary at a very early time, and often a source of
<pb n="122" id="p.122">




trouble to the city. In 1454 there was a great fray made in
St. Martin's le Grand by sanctuary men, who issued forth and
hurt divers citizens, whereof it was like to have grown a great
spoil, had not the great wisdom of the Mayor and magistrates
of the city put the same in good order in time, for there was
so grievous a complaint made to the King against the city by
the Abbot of Westminster, that the liberties were in great peril
to be seized."
<p>In 1457 "there was a good order taken for ye good usage
of St. Martin's le Grand in London, being a sanctuary." There
are still several churches in the vicinity, the churchyard of one
being laid out as a garden and known as the " Postman's Park."
St. Ann's in the Willows contains a monument to Peter
Herwood, who apprehended Guy Faux, and in 1640 was
stabbed by John James, a Dominican friar, in Westminster Hall.
In Falcon Square is a place of worship associated with
Drs. Livingstone and Moffat. It has recently been sold, and a
chapel is to be erected in Harrow with the proceeds.
In Monkswell Street is the Hall of the Barber Surgeons;
it was designed by Inigo Jones, and, among other interesting
things, contains the picture by Holbein, showing Henry VIII.
giving them their charter. As far back as Pepys' time they have
been willing to sell this work. Pepys did not like the subject,
nor the price. " I did think to give l200 for it, it being said
to be worth l1000; but it is so spoiled that I have no mind to
it, and it is not a pleasant, though a good picture." Pepys in
these words shows his good sense and his apt criticism. There
are several other good portraits-one of Inigo Jones, by Vandyke,
and the Countess of Richmond, by Lely. A leather screen
<pb n="123" id="p.123">



in the hall is said to be formed of the skin of a man who was
hanged at Tyburn, and found to be still living when brought
here for dissection; he left his skin, when he did die, to the
surgeons as a token of gratitude.
<p>The name of Cripplegate has provided matter for dispute
amongst antiquaries for centuries. The most probable origin of
the name arises from the monkish legend with reference to King
Edmund the Martyr. When his body was removed from Bury
St. Edmunds to London during the Danish invasion in 1010,
it was brought into the city by this gate, and certain lame men
being present, were miraculously cured by the holy relics;
"rising to their feet upright, and praising God." A charter
by William the Conqueror fifty years later, founding a college in
the vicinity, mentions it as Cripplegate. Like most of the gates,
it was used as a prison, and was rebuilt by the brewers of London
in 1244. From the oft-repeated rebuilding of all the city gates,
it is probable that in early times they were built of timber. Some
of them, for keeping and repair, were granted to the monks,
such as Aldgate. Moorgate was remarkable in being built
higher than the others, so that the train-bands could march out
with their pikes to exercise in Moorfields. This expanse of
rough ground, crossed by a brook which ran by Fore Street and
joined the Walbrook on the east of Moorgate, was the great
exercise ground for the city, and at an early date these exercises
did not always take the form deemed best by the authorities ; in
that resembling in many ways a question very much in evidence
now. In 1349 proclamation was made that "The people of
the realm, instead of using their skill in shooting arrows, that
honour and profit may accrue to the realm, and by the help
<pb n="124" id="p.124">



of God be no small assistance in our warlike acts; the same
people please themselves in hurling of stones and wood and iron,
some in hand-ball, foot-ball, and in cambuck (a game played
with a ball and a crooked stick, the parent, probably, of hockey
and golf), and cock-fighting, and some apply themselves to
dishonest games, whereby the said realm is likely in a short time
to become destitute of archers. We willingly apply a reasonable
remedy, and command you in the city, as well within the libertys
as without, you cause public proclamation to be made that
every one of the city, strong in body, at leisure times on holidays,
use in their recreations bows and arrows or pellets and bolts, and
learn and exercise the art of shooting, forbidding all games
which have no profit in them, under pain of imprisonment." In
those days the authorities had no doubts as to what they wished,
nor how to enforce their wishes. On May 20, 1618, James I.
declares that it is his pleasure, "After the end of Divine service
the people should not be letted from any lawful recreation
on Sundays, dancing, either for men or women, archery for men,
vaulting, or any other such, nor from having May games,
Whitsun ales, and morris dances, and the setting up of maypoles,
and other sports therewith used, and that women should have
leave to carry rushes to the churches for the decoring of them
according to their old customs." These liberties did not extend
to recusants, nor to conformists if they had not on the same day
attended Divine service.

<div1 type="entry"><head>ST. GILES', CRIPPLEGATE</><p>

St. Giles', Cripplegate, first built in 1090 by Alfune, was
destroyed by fire in 1544. It was then rebuilt and enlarged. In
1682 the tower was raised and the upper part of brick added.
After the old houses built in 1660, which stood against
it, and for the accommodation of which the mouldings had
been hacked away, were removed in 1903, the church remained as shown in the drawing for some time; it was then
cased with stone and a statue of John Milton erected near
where a part of the city wall is apparent in the drawing.
Best known, perhaps, as the scene of Cromwell's marriage
and the place where Milton's ashes lie, it is associated with
many other famous men. John Foxe held the living for a
time, but resigned it. At one time he was tutor to the family
of Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlecote, and one of these pupils
and her daughter are buried here. Intensely Protestant in
sympathy, in 1575 he petitioned Queen Elizabeth for some
Dutch Anabaptists condemned to be burnt, but unsuccessfully.
He wrote much on the controversy with Popery, but the book
on which his fame rests is his "History of the Acts and
Monuments of the Church," popularly known as the "Book
of Martyrs," first published in England in 1563. This book
was sanctioned by the Bishops and ordered by canon of the
Anglican Convocation to be placed in the hall of every
episcopal palace in England. The book has gone through
innumerable editions. Its trustworthiness is denied by Roman
<pb n="126" id="p.126">




Catholics (and William Cobbett). Foxe died in his seventieth
year, and was buried in the chancel of St. Giles'.
John Speed, the historian, was buried here in 1629. He,
assisted by Robert Cotton, a helper of Camden, wrote the
"History of England." Like John Stow, he was a tailor, and
enjoyed few advantages from education, yet he was a man
of great attainments and industry in the study of antiquities.
The first to reject old fables and exercise a just discrimination
in the selection of authorities, his history was for long the
best in existence; it extends from earliest times to the Union.
In 1606 he published maps of Great Britain and Ireland,
showing shires, hundreds, cities, and shire towns.
Here also is buried Sir Martin Frobisher, who thrice
tried to discover a north-west passage to the East; served
under Drake in the West Indies, was knighted for distinguished
bravery during a fight with the Spaniards, and died of a wound
received at Brest in 1594.
<p>A curious feature of the donations at this church was
the quantity of clothing given away, there being nearly a
dozen different distributions of gowns, shirts, coats, stockings,
smocks, &amp;c.
<p>John Milton moved to this district from St. Bride's Churchyard in <date value="1640">1640</date>, and, with the exception of two periods, remained
faithful to it all his life. The first house he occupied was
in Maidenhead Court, near Bridgewater Square. There he
wrote several tracts against Episcopacy, and married, in June
<date value="1643">1643</date>, Mary Powell, the daughter of an Oxfordshire Royalist.
His wife, "accustomed to dance with the King's officers," and
to much company, found the home uncongenial. No company
<pb n="127" id="p.127">



came, and the crying of her husband's nephews, to whom he
acted as a somewhat severe tutor, did not make the house
more cheerful. Probably it had been nothing of a love match.
She went to her parents at Forest Hill, and there remained.
The poet's letters remained unanswered, and a messenger sent
to bring her back was scornfully dismissed. So matters continued. Milton wrote some tracts on divorce, and, in expectation
of the advance of Prince Rupert's troops after the battle of
Edgehill, caused the famous poem to be affixed to the door of
his house standing so near the highway:

<lb>"Captain, or colonel, or knight in arms
<lb>Whose chance on these defenceless doors may seize,
<lb>If deed of honour ever did thee please,
<lb>Guard them, and him protect from harms.
<lb>He can requite thee, for he knows the charms
<lb>That call fame on such gentle deeds as these,
<lb>And he can spread thy name o'er land and seas,
<lb>Whatever clime the sun's bright circle warms.
<lb>Lift not thy spear against the muse's bower."


The poet's father came to live with him, and he moved
to a larger house in the Barbican (this house, No. 17, was
taken down in <date value="1864">1864</date>). His wife then, hearing that the poet
was paying attention to a Miss Davies, returned to her home
and allegiance-a fortunate event for the Powell family, providing them with a refuge when the Royalist cause failed.
He published in 1646 his collected poems, including "Comus,"
"Lycidas," "L'Allegro," and "I1 Penseroso." His father died,
leaving him with a larger income, so that he gave up all his
pupils but his nephews, and, in <date value="1647">1647</date>, removed to a house in
128


Whetstone Park, backing on to Lincoln's Inn Fields. In <date value="1649">1649</date>
he was appointed Secretary for Foreign Tongues to the Council
of State, and migrated to Scotland Yard until rooms were ready
for him in the palace. In <date value="1651">1651</date> his rooms were required for
a greater person, and he moved to Petty France, York Street,
Westminster, where are now Queen Anne's Mansions. He
lived here for eight years ; his first wife died, and his second
wife, whom he married at St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury,
also died, and was buried in St. Margaret's. Mary Powell
had left him with three daughters, and his second wife died
in childbed; of her in later years he wrote the beautiful poem
beginning, " Methought I saw my late espoused saint," and his
blindness, that had been creeping on for years, became complete. The house in Westminster was later occupied by Jeremy
Bentham and by Hazlitt. The former marked it with a tablet
as "Sacred to Milton, prince of poets." This was probably
the earliest of these tablets in London.
Milton then went into hiding in Bartholomew Close until
his pardon was passed, when he took a house in Jewin Street.
Here he lived for three years, wrote the greater part of " Paradise
Lost," and was married a third time, to Elizabeth Minshull.
Jewin Street had at one time been the Jews' burial ground,
but when Milton came there it was laid out in "fair garden
plots and summer houses." Shortly after his marriage he removed to the house in Artillery Walk, now Bunhill Row, a
small house on the west side, with open country to the north.
Here he is described, "as he used to sit, in a grey coarse
cloth coat, in warm, sunny weather, to enjoy the fresh air."
Here "Paradise Lost" was finished, and published in <date value="1667">1667</date>;
129



his "History of England" in <date value="1670">1670</date>; in <date value="1671">1671</date>, "Paradise Regained" and "Samson Agonistes," prophetic of the evil times
to come. It was during these last eleven years that the Plague
drove him out of London to the cottage at Chalfont St. Giles,
provided for him by Quaker Ellwood, the only dwelling now
standing that has sheltered John Milton. When he died he
left property valued at l1500. Aubrey says he died "of
the gowte, struck in," on the <dateRange from="2001-11-09" to="2001-11-10">9th or 10th November 1674</dateRange>,
as appears by his apothecary's books. Another account says,
"He died of consumption fourteen years after the 'Blessed
Restoration,' and was buried in the grave of his father."
The story that his bones were dug up, and partially carried
away, while Elizabeth Grant the sextoness exhibited what
remained for twopence a head, seems to be disproved. No
doubt that female ogre did, on the 4th and 5th August 1790,
exhibit some remains, and George Steevens, the editor of Shakespeare, denounced the indignity intended by "Royalist land
sharks," but satisfied himself that the corpse shown was that of
a woman.
Susannah Annesley, mother of the Wesleys, was a descendant of Samuel Annesley, "silenced" here for over-liberal
opinions.
The finely toned bells of the church for generations
rung curfew for this part of the city, and in modern times
Thomas Hardy describes the tower in glowing words. A part
of the city wall is still to be seen in the churchyard.
One of the most famous natives of the parish was Defoe.
The son of a butcher, he became a man of many enterprises; he studied for the Presbyterian ministry; he followed
130



Monmouth in the rebellion, and returning to London he
was a hosier in Freeman's Court, Cornhill; but the shop, like
the ministry, was too quiet a life. A merchant adventurer to
Spain and Portugal was his next trade: failing, he compounded
with his creditors, who must have had great faith in his probity
-they took his single bond, and they were all paid. Next a
brick and pantile maker at Tilbury, where he failed again;
appointed one of the Commissioners for the glass duty, that
office was soon suppressed, and in 1699 he took to literature.
In 1702 he wrote a satirical pamphlet against the High Church
party, "The Shortest Way with Dissenters," which immediately
got him into trouble; he was fined, pilloried, and imprisoned.
When he stood in the pillory in Cheapside, the populace
honoured him; his health was drank with acclamation, and
nothing harder than a flower was cast at him. During the two
years he spent in Newgate he had sufficient liberty to publish a
paper three times a week. On his release he was employed by
Queen Anne on a mission to Scotland with reference to the
Union, but the miry ways of politics attracted him again, and
for some pamphlets on the "House of Hanover," he was fined
1600; obtaining a pardon, he entered the Secret Service.
In <date value="1719">1719</date> he published the book which has delighted boys for all
the years that have passed-"Robinson Crusoe." This was
followed by other tales until his stormy life closed in <date value="1731">1731</date>.
His "Journal of the Plague Year " is a vivid narrative, compiled
from the recollections of older men.
The Artillery Ground, or place for the exercises of the
Honourable Artillery Company, was first used here in the time
of James I., their old ground being too crowded. It is described
131



as being "three fields from Moorgate and next to the six
windmills."

<div2 type="entry"><head>BUNHILL FIELDS</><p>
In Roscoe Street is a meeting-house associated with George
Fox the Quaker (whether he is buried there is doubtful); and
close to that is Bunhill Fields, that weird city with groves of
tombstones : this ground was set apart for use in the Plague, but
was not so used. Defoe's "great pit" was near the upper end
of Goswell Street. It was subsequently leased by several sects of
Dissenters for a burying-place, they objecting to the Church
Service ; a part was assigned to the Quakers. Among the countless
dead who lie here are Dr. Thomas Goodwin, who attended
Cromwell in his last illness; Lieut.-General Fleetwood, Cromwell's
son-in-law; George Whitehead; Daniel Defoe, <date value="1731">1731</date> ; John
Bunyan, whose tomb was restored by public subscription in 862;
Susannah Wesley, the mother of the Wesleys ; Dr. Isaac Watts;
William Blake the painter and poet; and Thomas Stothard, R.A.
A monument was erected to Defoe in <date value="1870">1870</date>. There is no trace
or record of where Blake lies.
Just over the City Road to the east is the chapel which is
the headquarters of Methodism, and the pastor's house, where
John Wesley died; one of the rooms in the house is fitted with
a somewhat meagre collection of relics relating to Wesley and
Methodism-the room where he died, and his closet; these form
a place of pilgrimage for people from all the corners of the earth.
The district north of St. Giles' Church was for a time
something of a literary centre. The Grub Street of the pamphleteers is now Milton Street: the former name is usually
<pb n="132" id="p.132">



said to have arisen as an opprobrious term in connection with
Foxe's "Book of Martyrs," published there, but the name of the
street is much older than that, being mentioned as Grub Street
in an Act for paving certain streets in 1543. Playhouse Yard,
in Whitecross Street, marks the site of the "Fortune Theatre,"
by which Edward Alleyne, the founder of Dulwich College, made
his wealth. Pepys visited it, of course, and "found the musique
better than we looked for and the acting not much worse, because
I expected as bad as could be."
It must have been a new theatre then, as shortly after the
ascension of Parliament, they passed an ordinance empowering
the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs of the city to pull down and destroy
all playhouses within their jurisdiction and to cause all the actors
and players thereunto belonging to be apprehended and punished
as common rogues and vagabonds, and also every person frequenting such playhouses to forfeit the sum of five shillings.
This space, though strictly without the city, was certainly under
their jurisdiction.
<p>From St. Giles', Cripplegate, we may still trace the course of
the city wall by London Wall, Wormwood Street, Camomile
Street, Bevis Marks, on to Duke's Place and Aldgate. In the
area between these and the Bank there are many churches
and churchyards, while many of both have been swept away: here
and there a little space of ground remains, where the churches
had not been rebuilt after the fire-"the dreadful fire," as the
worn inscription tells us; and somehow the graven letters make
us realise the terror of it in a curiously poignant way.
Who has passed along Cheapside without seeing the plane
tree growing among the tombstones marking the site of St. Peter's,

Cheap, and few have not regretted the barbarous way in which
it has been polled. The shops facing Cheapside are not a new
feature: in 1401 the parishioners were granted a licence to
erect a shop before their church, for which they had to pay the
authorities l1, 10s. 4d. per annum. This proved too high, and
the ground rent was reduced to 13s. 4d., while in place of what
was then known as "the long shop" four shops were erected
with rooms over them. Probably the ground rent has been raised
since then. At the junction of Wood Street and Cheapside stood
one of the crosses which were erected at each of the places where
the body of Queen Eleanor rested-

<lb>"Where Edward wept for Eleanor,
<lb>In mortar and in stone."

This was found an obstruction at an early date and removed.
Another fragment of "God's acre" is hidden behind the
warehouses of Wood Street, opposite St. Alban's Church; this
was St. Mary's, Steyning. There is another near Falcon Square,
and a few are entirely hidden from public vision.
Some of the churches remaining have a large amount of
interest for us, while others have very little. The church of St.
Alban's, Wood Street, recalls the story of the glazier and the
head of James IV. When this king was slain at Flodden his
body was embalmed, wrapped in lead, and brought to London
afterwards it was sent to the monastery of Sheen. Here the body
lay for many years, finally being put in a lumber-room, where,
after the Dissolution, it was found by some workmen, who cut
off the head. The scent arising from the embalming materials
took the fancy of one Young, a glazier to Queen Elizabeth, and he
134


carried it home to his house in Wood Street, where he kept it
for some time; but wearying of the ghastly ornament, he gave it
to the sexton of St. Alban's to put in the charnel-house, where
maybe it remains among the plebeian bones to this day.
This church, rebuilt by Wren, is of ancient foundation,
daring back to <date value="924">924</date>, when it was built by Athelstane.
The very vivid narrative of the Great Plague, purporting
to be written by a grocer of Wood Street, has been attributed
to Defoe.
<p>In coaching days there were a few great inns in this
street: some of the names survive, but no trace of the original
buildings.
<p>Readers of "Great Expectations" will remember one of
these houses where Pip waited on more than one occasion.
The vanished church of St. Michael's in Wood Street was
associated with a man who wrought much mischief in his time.
When Titus Oates, evicted from all his employments, found
himself homeless and penniless, it was to Dr. Tonge of St.
Michael's that he applied for relief. Tonge's imagination was
full of Jesuits and visions of plots ; the powers of Oates in manufacturing these found a suitable soil in his credulous mind, and
the structure they compiled between them cost many a good
man his life.
<p>At one time there was a prison in the street. In <date value="1554">1554</date>
"This yere the 'counter' of London, which before time out of
mind had been kept in Bread Street in the said city, was, upon
certain considerations, removed from thence to Wood Street, and
the first master or keeper thereof was Robert Smart, the swordbearer of London, a man comely and serviceable." This is an
<pb n="135" id="p.135">



instance of the difficulties that then, and at a much later time,
in the cases of Bridewell and the Fleet prisons arose in the path
of any reform.
<p>The keeper of the Compter in Bread Street, Robert Husbands, had long been notorious for his exactions and barbarous
treatment of prisoners, and a jury, of whom John Stow was a
member, was appointed to investigate the charges. They found
"that not only had this jailor extorted money from prisoners,
but he had also made his house a common receptacle of whores
and thieves, whom he suffered to lodge there for a groat apiece ";
yet after several prosecutions, the city authorities apparently
found that the easiest solution of the question was for them to
build this new prison in Wood Street, "to the no small joy of
the unhappy citizens and sufferers."


<div1 type="entry"><head>ALDERMANBURY</><p>
In Aldermanbury is the <placename>Church of St. Mary the Virgin</>,
interesting as the resting-place of Condell and Heminge, the
friends and partners of Shakespeare, who issued the first collected edition of his dramas in <date value="1623">1623</date>. There is a memorial
to them here. The church was rebuilt by Wren in <date value="1677--">1677</date>,
and one of its most distinguished incumbents was Edmund
Calamy, a native of London, who was appointed to the living
in <date value="1639">1639</date>. Of Presbyterian sympathies, yet disapproving of the
execution of Charles I., he was one of the deputies sent to the
Hague to meet Charles II., from whom he declined a bishopric;
yet by the tyranny of the High Church party he was driven
from all his appointments. He died in <date value="1666--">1666</date>, and is buried
<pb n="136" id="p.136">



in the church. Here also is buried the notorious Judge Jeffreys.
And this was the scene of the second marriage of John Milton,
to Catherine Woodcock, in <date value="1656">1656</date>.
In <date value="1438--">1438</date> <name type=x key="William Estfield">Sir William Estfield</name>, the Mayor, erected a conduit
on the south of the church to supply the inhabitants with
"sweet water from Tyburn." This conduit being destroyed
in the fire of 1666, was rebuilt, but soon after, the water from
New River and the Thames being so well supplied, it was
rendered useless, and in 1730 it was pulled down, the stones
being used to repair the gate on London Bridge.
Between this and Basinghall Street was the church of St.
Michael Bassishaw. This has entirely disappeared-a small
plane tree where was the east end of it being deemed sufficient memorial. The vaults, extending to Aldermanbury, are
now devoted to secular uses, viz. a public-house cellar.
Aldermanbury Postern marks the place of a small gate in
London Wall, and there is the church of St. Alphege. This
Alphege, or Elphegus, was a bishop in England during Saxon
times-circa 978-who concluded a peace with the Danish
invaders. The advowson was anciently in the dean and canons
of the collegiate church of St. Martin's le Grand. When
Henry VII. annexed that to Westminster Abbey, the Bishop
of Westminster remained patron till Mary granted the privilege
to Edmund, Bishop of London. It is probable that the original,
outside the city wall (part of which is still visible here), was the
collegiate church founded there by William the Conqueror.
This having become ruinous, the parishioners wished to rebuild
it, but this the King, Henry VIII., would not grant, and in
place thereof he sold them the chapel of the hospital of St.
137



Mary the Virgin, or Elsing 'Spital, for 100. This hospital
was founded in <date value="1329--">1329</date> by William de Elsing for the keep-
ing of a hundred blind men. The founder had, in testimony
of his subjection to the church of St. Paul's, to swear fealty
and pay a rent or tax of 6s. 8d. yearly. In 1331 the hospital was appropriated to the church of St. Mary the Virgin,
Aldermanbury, that having to provide a priest to administer
the sacraments at the hospital. Having acquired the chapel
of the hospital, the parishioners pulled down their old church
and used the materials to repair and enlarge their purchase.
That escaped the fire, but, becoming ruinous, was again rebuilt
by Sir William Stainer about <date value="1175--">1775</date>. It is now doomed to
destruction, but efforts are being made to retain the fourteenth-century tower, which is largely built of flints, as a last remaining
mark of the charitable institutions of the Middle Ages. The
tower is not visible from the street, and was sketched from the
roof of an adjoining warehouse. The present church contains
an interesting monument to Sir Rowland Haywood, Lord Mayor
in <date value="1570--">1570</date> and <date value="1590--">1590</date>. He is represented kneeling with his first
wife and eight children on the right, and his second wife and
eight children on the left. Just adjoining it stood, until recently,
Sion College, with a fine brick and stone front. This was
founded in <date value="1631--">1631</date> by Dr. Thomas White, Vicar of St. Dunstan's
in the West, for the use of London clergy, "where expectants
may lodge till they are provided with houses in the several
parishes in which they serve cure." Fuller resided here when
writing his "Church History." It had a chapel, library, and
hospital, and was partly burned in the Great Fire. The new
building is now on the Embankment.

<div1 type="entry"><head>THE GUILDHALL AND ST. LAWRENCE JEWRY</><p>

Several of the halls of city companies are near by, but
all have been afflicted with the craze for rebuilding in recent
years, with the exception, fortunately, of the Guildhall, home
of so many civic feasts and episodes in the struggle for civic
freedom. St. Lawrence Jewry was destroyed in the fire, and
when rebuilt, the parish of St. Mary Magdalene, Milk Street,
was annexed to it. In the church are buried Sir Richard
Gresham, knight, sometime Lord Mayor, and Audrey, his first
wife. This is said to be a brother of the more famous builder
of the Exchange. There is the epitaph-

<lb>"Lo, here the Lady Margaret North
<lb>In tombe and earth doth lye:
<lb>Of husbands four the faithful spouse,
<lb>Whose fame shall never dye.
<lb>One Andrew Francis was the first;
<lb>The second Robert, hight,
<lb>Surnamed Chertsey, alderman;
<lb>Sir David Brooke, a knight,
<lb>Was third, but he passed all.
<lb>There was a number fourth,
<lb>And for his virtue made a Lord,
<lb>Was called Sir Edward North.
<lb>These altogether do I wish
<lb>A joyful rising day,
<lb>That of the Lord and of His Christ,
<lb>All honour may they say.

And inscriptions in memory of Geoffrey Bulleyn, Mayor of
London, <date value="1413">1413</date> (this was the great-grandfather of <name type=x key=x>Anne Bulleyn</name>);
<pb n="139" id="p.139">



<name type=x key=x>Thomas Bulleyn</name>, <date value="1471">1471</date>; Lady <name type=x key=x>Alice Avenon</name>, <date value="1574">1574</date>; and John
Tillotson, Archbishop of Canterbury. The first known rector
was in <date value="1296">1296</date>, and the church takes its name from the Jewry which
was here until the expulsion of that people by <name type=x key=x>Edward I</name>. When
they settled again at Aldgate, in the days of the Commonwealth,
this became known as the "Old Jewry."
The chapel of <name type=x key=x>Mary Magdalene</name>, or London College, stood
on the east side of Guildhall Yard until late in the eighteenth
century. In the south of this chapel was a spacious library well
furnished with books, erected by the executors of Sir Richard
Whittington, but the Protector Somerset "iniquitously spoiled
it of its books."
<p>The Guildhall, like many of the great buildings of London,
has grown by accretion. In <date value="1409">1409</date> it is said, "This yere of an
evil-favoured and simple cottage was the Guildhall erected and
builded at the costs of the city, but much by the help of Richard
Whittington and other good aldermen. Yt had mind to beautify
the city wherein they had gained their wealth." Whittington
also paved the great hall with Purbeck stone, and many aldermen
contributed to the glazing of the windows. The "evil-favoured
cottage" had before that, for centuries, been the meeting-place
common to all the guilds, many of them very wealthy, and
having, no doubt, better halls of their own. The first civic feast
given here was in <date value="1500">1500</date>, when "Sir John Shaw, goldsmith,"
who had been knighted on Bosworth field, gave his first Lord
Mayor's feast. Before that time these feasts had been held at
Ewee's Hall.
<p>The charter granted to the city by <name type=x key="William I">William the Conqueror</name>
provided for the government of the city by "Portgrieves."
<pb n="140" id="p.140">



Richard I. ordained that they be governed by "Bayliffes," the
first of these being Henry Cornehill and Richard Reynery. In
<date value="1109">1109</date> King John "granted to ye citizens, by the King's letters
patents, that they should yerely choose among themselves a
mayor and two sheriffs to govern the city," and from thenceforth the name of Bailiffs to cease; the said election to be made
on St. Matthew's or Michaelmas day. The first Mayor was Henry
Fitzalwyn. In <date value="1226">1226</date>, Henry III. granted to the city, "free warren,
yt is to say, liberty to hunt a certain circuit about the citie, and
also yt the citizens of London should pass toll free throughout
all England, and also all weares in ye Thames should be plucked
up and destroyed for ever" (this refers to fish weares). Before that,
in <date value="1127">1127</date>, the liberties of the city were confirmed, and each of the
sheriffs was licensed to have two clerks and two officers, without any "mo." In <date value="1229">1229</date> "ye Mayors and rulers of ye city
made an act that from thenceforth, no sheriff of London should
continue in office for more than one yere, because by their long
continuance they began to make their offices profitable, by taking
of bribes." The same King also, "did now grant the citizens
of London, that where before they did present their Mayor
before the King, wherever he went, and so to be admitted, that
now, he should come only before the Barons of the Exchequer,
and they should admit him and give him his oath."
Edward III. at his accession confirmed the liberties
and franchises of the city, and ordained that the Mayor for
the time being should sit in all places of judgment within
the liberties of the same, for Chief Justice, the King's person
only excepted, that every alderman who had been Mayor
should be Justice of Peace in all London and Middlesex,
<pb n="141" id="p.141">



and every alderman who had not been Mayor should be Justice
of Peace in his own ward. In <date value="1339">1339</date> the King granted "that
ye Mayor and sheriffs' officers of London should from that
time use maces of silver and parcell gilt." But it was not
always a story of giving or granting on the King's side;
for everything granted there was something to pay, and
as the city grew in wealth and dignity, so the "clashes"
between them, the kings and the parliaments, became more
frequent. Towards the end of the reign of Henry III., that
monarch having nursed a lifelong grudge against them, because
they declined joining in the crusade, the citizens were in so
desperate a plight that they had nothing they could call their
own; famine was sore in the land, and many poor parents ate
their own children. They went to petition the King, who
graciously promised to be kind to them, and give them another
charter-for 60,000 marks.
<p>"On March <date value="1541">1541</date>, while Parliament was sitting, one
George Ferrars, gent. and burgess for the town of Plymouth,
was arrested in the city of London, upon a condemnation,
whereupon the Commons House, having understanding thereof,
sent the serjeant-at-arms to the 'Counter' in Bread Street to
fetch him; but the clerkes would not deliver him. The
sheriffs, Rowland Hill and Henry Suckley, came to the
'Counter,' and at first they denied the delivery of him, but
afterwards delivered him. Howbeit the matter was so taken
by the Commons that the sheriffs, the clerkes, five officers,
and the party plaintiff were sent to the Tower, and there
lay two days, and then were delivered again by the Speaker
and the Commons House."
<pb n="142" id="p.142">



<p>Three years later, the King demanded of the citizens of
London a benevolence, "which was 2s. in the pound, to be
paid after such rate as before they had been cessed at, whereat
many did much grudge, but specially one Master- Richard
Ride, alderman, who did utterly deny the payment thereof;
and being a tall man, and the council greatly offended
with him, he was thereupon appointed to serve, himself, in
proper son, as a soldier in Scotland, where he was made
prisoner and ransomed by his own charges, but shortly after
died."
<p>"Sir William Roche, alderman, sitting at this Mayor's table,
did somewhat blame the Mayor for that he was too liberal in
granting such a payment, saying he ought to have called his
brethren together before they had gone into the council, to
have taken their advice in what sort they best might have
answered the council; which words the Mayor took not in
good part, but complained on him to the council, and being
sent for, he was sent to the Fleet, and there remained six
weeks, and yet payed the money in as large a manner as any
others did."
<p>The front of the Guildhall towards King Street was much
injured in the Great Fire, but was immediately repaired and
re-erected. The hall is large enough to accommodate 7000
persons. On the east is a raised platform, where the mayor,
aldermen, and sheriffs sit. It contains many monuments.
The present front, designed by Mr. Dance, consisted of
three visions separated by fluted pilasters. The division
on the right has been removed, and the western portion

perfectly upright. Besides the countless great feasts, it has
also been the scene of more sombre episodes. In <date value="1546">1546</date>
it was the scene of the trial and condemnation of Anne
Askew, burnt at Smithfield; of the poet Earl of Surrey in
1547; in 1553 Lady Jane Grey and her husband were tried
here; in 1554 Sir Thomas Throgmorton; and in 1606 the
Jesuit Garnet. In 1642 Charles I. came here after his futile
attempt to arrest the five members of Parliament, Holles,
Haslerig, Pym, Hampden, and Stroud, at Westminster, and
claimed the assistance of the city authorities and citizens if they
took refuge in the city; with what success may be judged when,
"on the appointed day, the five accused proceeded by water
to the House of Commons, escorted by 2000 armed mariners
in boats, detachments of the train-bands on either side of the
river with eight pieces of cannon, and were received at Westminster Stairs by 4000 horsemen from Buckinghamshire."
The King had found it convenient to go to Hampton Court.
Stow gives a very fanciful derivation of the name Lothbury, from the loathsome sounds made by founders and
coppersmiths. In the corner of Old Jewry and Lothbury stood
the first Jewish synagogue in England. Henry III. in 1272
conferred this on a new order of monks, Fratres di Sacca
(clothed in sackcloth). It was conveyed by them to Robert
Fitzwalter, and became his town house, and was sold by
that family in 1411 to the Grocers, to make themselves
a hall.
<p>Between the Guildhall and Bishopsgate many churches
remain. Some have little history, and but faint stirrings of
life, while others, such as All Hallows, London Wall, perform a
<pb n="144" id="p.144">


good work with morning services for early toilers in the city,
providing a haven of rest for which many are grateful.
In Founders' Hall Court, Lothbury, in 1672, the first Scots
church in London was opened by Alexander Carmichael. No
trace of this now remains.

<div1 type="entry"><head>AUSTIN FRIARS</><p>

Hidden in a curiously secluded fashion, Austin Friars,
with its many memories, also retains some of its ancient peace,
at least in the night and morning, when the money-market
has ceased to trouble, whether an instance given by a resident
stating that on a Sunday night he heard a friend drop "a good-sized pin" at the other end of the church is quite true or not.
It has a long history, since it was founded by Humphrey Bohun,
Earl of Hereford and Essex, in 1253. Erasmus lodged there
in 1513. The Earl of Dorset was married to Lady Anne
Clifford in her mother's chambers there. Lord Strafford was
a resident in 1621. Dr. Mead lived there, and in later days
James Smith of the "Rejected Addresses." There are a few
old houses still remaining. One seventeenth-century mansion
near the Pinners' Hall has just been destroyed.
<p>St. Augustine or St. Austin established the Benedictine
Order in England in 543. The vows of the Order, besides
poverty, chastity, and obedience, also included the necessity of
seven hours' daily labour with their hands. The Benedictines
and Augustines were the builders, the artists, and the scholars
of the monastic orders; hence, this being their own church, it
was made one of the finest in London, and for nearly three
<pb n="145" id="p.145">



hundred years it was a favourite place of burial for great people.
Among many others were John Vere, Earl of Oxford, beheaded
in 1643, and other noblemen who suffered on Tower Hill.
Before that it was the place of burial of many of the barons slain
at Barnet in 1471-one of the greatest fights of the Wars of
the Roses, where the Earl of Warwick was among the killed, and
which served to settle Edward IV. on the throne. Henry VIII.,
at the Dissolution, bestowed the monastery and part of the
ground on William Paulet, Lord St. John, afterwards first
Marquis of Winchester, who built himself a town house. This
is the gentleman who claimed to have succeeded by being a
willow and not an oak. Later, the citizens of London did not
find much of the willow about the family. The church was
reserved by the King, and granted by Edward VI. to the Dutch
nation in London, to be their preaching place. The diary of
Edward VI. notes: "June 29, 1550.--It was appointed that
the Germans should have the Austin Friars for their church,
to have their service in, for the avoiding of all sects of Anabaptists and such like." This sect of Anabaptists was then,
and had been for some time, a matter of as grave concern to
Governments as Nihilism was in recent years. The grant was
confirmed by several sovereigns, and it is a good example of the
tenacity of the Dutch that they retain the church to this day.
It was a very fine structure, cruciform, with a fine spire.
Stow says, "I have not seen the like." In 1600 the Mayor and
corporation begged the Marquis to repair the steeple, urging
that the fall thereof would be a great deformity to the city,
"it being of architecture, one of the beautifullest and rarest
spectacle thereof, and also that it was a fearful and eminent
<pb n="146" id="p.146">



danger to the inhabitants next adjoining." As a reply, the
Marquis pulled down the steeple, demolished the choir and
transepts, leaving the Dutch only the nave. This remained
until 1862, when a fire destroyed most of it but the outer walls.
It was restored in 1863-65. The first Marquis died in 1571,
and it was his son who worked the havoc. He sold the monu-
ments for l100, made stables of part of the church, stripped
the lead from the roof, and covered it with tiles. By 1602
the fourth Marquis was so hard up that he sold the whole
lot for 4500 to John Swinnerton, merchant, and afterwards
Lord Mayor. Part was sold to the "Pinners" to erect a hall,
and part made into a glass-factory under the patronage of the
Duke of Buckingham. Howell, author of the "Letters," had
been sent to Venice and Holland in 1621 to pry into the secrets
of the art and engage workmen. On his return he was ap-
pointed Steward to the manufacturers. It is probable that much
of the so-called Venetian window-glass with varying purplish
tints, still to be seen in many great houses near London, was
produced here. Howell's connection with the factory did not
last long-he drifted into diplomatic life; but the manufacture
of glass continued for some considerable time.
<p>A rather uneasy neighbour for the residents was Thomas
Cromwell, who purchased divers tenements within the precincts
of the priory, and on the sites thereof in Throgmorton Street he
built for himself a magnificent house. Finding the garden too
small for his taste, he, without consulting either tenants or landlords, caused the fence to be moved 22 feet northward, and
enclosed the whole with a brick wall. A wooden house belonging
to one man was placed on rollers and moved backwards as far
<pb n="147" id="p.147">



as he considered necessary. After Cromwell's downfall the
Company of Drapers purchased the house, and it has been their
Hall ever since (1742). Although Austin Friars was given to
the Dutch for the avoiding of Anabaptists, yet under the cover of
that church they obtained a footing in England. They were hardly
treated. Queen Elizabeth on three occasions ordered them all
to leave the kingdom; domiciliary visits were made in all the
parishes of London. In 1575, twenty-seven were arrested in a
house in Aldgate: some received a reprimand, five repented, and
were condemned to bear faggots and recant at Paul's Cross, and
eleven were condemned to be burnt. One of these recanted and
the others were sent out of the kingdom, but two others were
burnt, as the Queen called to mind "that it was her duty to
extirpate error, and that heretics ought to be cut off, that they
may not corrupt others."
<p>In the eighteenth century the Pinners' Hall was used as a
meeting-house for "Anabaptists" and "Independents "-the
"Independents" meeting on Sunday morning, the "Anabaptists"
in the afternoon.
<p>Winchester House, after the Marquis parted with it, was one
of the meeting-places of the "Levellers," a party that arose under
the guidance of Colonel John Lilburne, and who objected to the
methods of government by the Parliamentary leaders, saying
that these men sought their private profit under the mantle of
patriotism. This movement caused considerable trouble for a
time, and was very severely dealt with. Lilburne they attempted
to silence by a grant of 3000, but he would have none of it,
and wrote a series of pamphlets under the title of "England's New
Chains Discovered." The last of these he read to a numerous
<pb n="148" id="p.148">



assembly at Winchester House. By Parliament it was voted a
seditious and traitorous libel, and the author, with Walwyn,
Prince, and Overton, his associates, was committed to the
Tower. Owing to this there was a mutiny among the soldiers
in Bishopsgate, and five soldiers were condemned to be shot.
Only one was executed; but at his funeral a thousand men in
files preceded the corpse, which was adorned with bunches of
rosemary dipped in blood, while it was followed to the grave by
thousands of men and women wearing black and green ribbons.
This was followed by mutinies all over the southern counties, in
which many lost their lives, terminating at Wellingborough. So
thankful was Parliament at the suppression of the movement,
that a day of thanksgiving was appointed. The Parliament,
the Council of State, and the Council of the Army assembled
at Christ Church, and after two long sermons proceeded to
the Grocers' Hall in Poultry, where they dined. The Speaker,
Lenthall, in the manner of a king, received the sword of state
from the Mayor, and delivered it to him again, and at the
conclusion of the dinner the Lord Mayor presented to Fairfax
1000 in gold in a basin and ewer of the same metal, Cromwell
receiving at the same time 500 and a service of plate.
Lilburne was afterwards released. In earlier years he had
been in trouble with the Star Chamber, and was then condemned
to stand in the pillory and be whipped from the Fleet Prison
to Westminster, receiving five hundred lashes with knotted cords,
so that evidently his persistence in controversy was not easily
turned aside.
<p>Bishopsgate is said to have been built by Erkenwald, Bishop
of London, in the seventh century. A man of saintly repute, when
<pb n="149" id="p.149">



he died at Chertsey Abbey, the citizens of London went and
by force took the body from the Abbot and carried it to
St. Paul's, where his shrine was famous for centuries.
In the thirteenth century the gate was under the charge of
the Hanseatic League, and in 1226 the citizens complained to
the Judges Itinerant "that the Dutch do not maintain Bishopgate so well as they ought, to the damage of the city." On this
complaint Gerard Marhod, Alderman of the Hanse, and others
of these merchants had to pay to the Mayor and citizens 210
marks sterling, covenanting that they should repair the gate.
In <date value="1470">1470</date> the gate was beautifully rebuilt by the Hanse merchants,
and in <date value="1551">1551</date> these merchants had stone prepared to set up a
new gate, but the English merchants made suit to the King,
Edward VI., and a stop was put to the work. The old gate
remained until <date value="1731">1731</date>, when it was rebuilt-so badly, that the
centre arch fell while the work was going on.
<p>In St. Botolph's Church is buried Sir Paul Pindar; the
front of his house can be seen in Kensington Museum.
On the other side of the way is St. Ethelburga, a church
curiously jammed between the houses, founded by an Abbess
of that name, sister of King Edwy. It has some traditional
connection with Sir Henry Hudson on the eve of his last voyage.

<div1 type="entry"><head>CROSBY HALL</><p>
Near this was one of the most interesting relics of London
-Crosby Hall, probably the only portion of a dwelling-house
in the city dating back to the fifteenth century. The house
stood on what is now Crosby Square. Sir John Crosby leased
<pb n="150" id="p.150">















the land in <date value="1466">1466</date>, and built himself a fine house "in place of
certain tenements letten to him by Alice Ashfield, Prioress of
St. Helen's," the ground being rented at l11, 6s. 8d. Grocer
and woolman, sheriff in <date value="1470">1470</date>, he was knighted by Edward IV.,
and when he died was buried in St. Helen's. This house had
many distinguished memories: Richard, Duke of Gloucester, Lord
Protector, and afterwards King Richard III., lodged there.
About 5 8 Sir Thomas More held possession of the house,
and it has been said that he wrote his Utopia" here, but that
work was published in 5 6. In <date value="1523">1523</date> More sold it to Antonio
Bonvici, who for some years leased it to William Roper, the
husband of More's favourite daughter Margaret. The house was
seized by Henry VIII., but restored by Mary on her accession.
It came into the possession of Germayne Cioll, who resided there
till <date value="1566">1566</date>, when Sir John Crosby's lease expired. Alderman Bond
paid l1500 for it, and died there ten years later: he was a
merchant adventurer, and according to the inscription on his
tomb in St. Helen's, "the most famous of his age." During
his tenure, and at later times, it was the custom to lodge ambassadors in the house: the Spanish and the Dutch ambassadors
were lodged there in Bond's time, the Duc de Sully was there
in <date value="1594">1594</date>, the Duc de Boron in <date value="1601">1601</date>, the Russian ambassador
in <date value="1618">1618</date>.
In <date value="1594">1594</date> it was bought for 2560 by Sir John Spencer,
knight, father-in-law of the first Earl of Northampton and ancestor of the present Marquis; probably its many changes had
been hard on the old house. He repaired it, added a warehouse,
and celebrated his mayoralty here in <date value="1594">1594</date>, the same year that
the Duc de Sully was lodged there. The Dowager Countess of
<pb n="151" id="p.151">



Pembroke, "Sidney's sister, Pembroke's mother," lived here in
<date value="1609">1609</date>. A few years afterwards it was the residence of the Earl
of Northampton. A William Shakespeare was a parishioner in
<date value=x>1598</date>, and the poet introduces the house in his "Richard III."
In 1638 it was held by the East India Company, and during
the Rebellion it was occupied by Sir John Langham, Sir Kenelm
Digby and other Royalist prisoners being confined there.
The fire of 1666 destroyed a large part of the house, and
six years later another fire destroyed what was left, with the
exception of the hall, which escaped injury, and survived through
more adventures.
In <date value="1672">1672</date> it was converted into a Nonconformist meeting-house, and continued so for nearly a century: the last sermon was
preached there in <date value="1769">1769</date>. A part of it was the head office of the
Post Office from <date value="1678">1678</date> to <date value="1678">1687</date>, and from <date value="1700">1700</date> the East India
Company again occupied the hall for some years. From <date value="1810">1810</date> to
<date value="1831">1831</date> it was leased to a firm of packers, who divided it into
floors and did much damage. When their lease ran out, public
attention was called to it, a fund was raised, the interior carefully
restored, and the portion facing Great St. Helen's rebuilt: the
entrance from Bishopsgate formed no part of the original
building. Reopened in <date value="1842">1842</date> as a hall, it was leased to Crosby
Hall Literary Institute till <date value="1860">1860</date>, then for seven years it was a
wine-merchant's warehouse; since <date value="1868">1868</date> it had been a restaurant.
The passage to Crosby Square was under the gallery of the hall,
which was 69 feet long, 27 feet wide, and 38 feet high. At one
time there was an entrance through the oriel.
This fragment of the old house ought to have been left
standing, if only for its connection with More and his

devoted daughter, one of the truest heroines recorded in our
history. Almost at the time of its demolition a series of manu-
scripts were put up for sale by auction in London; these
included one in Latin referring to Sir John Crosby, dated in the
third year of Elizabeth's reign-"A licence in favour of
Antonio Bonvix concerning Crosby Place in Byeshoppesgate, in
the fourth year of Edward VI.;" "A certificate of Thomas
Wytton relating to Germaine Cioll, first year of Queen Mary;"
"Assignment of Crosby Place to Germaine Cioll;" "Assignment
from Germaine Cioll to hys brother, Jho. Cioll, of Crosby
Place, in ye paryshe of St. Helene; " "Indenture of sale and
bargain of Crosby Place from Germaine Cioll to William
Bond." All the names in the deeds were quoted by John
Stow in his "Survey of London," and the manuscripts were
found amongst a quantity of waste papers, supposed to be
without interest to anybody.
<p>It was during the time Crosby Place was occupied by Sir
John Spencer, that Compton, first Earl of Northampton, wished
to pay his addresses to his daughter, the greatest heiress in
London, but the opulent merchant would have none of him.
One day he met a baker's boy carrying a large basket on his
head, and, pleased at his diligence, he gave him sixpence, only to
discover later that the baker's boy was the Earl of Northampton
and the basket had contained his daughter. Vowing that was
the only sixpence of his money they would ever receive, he
refused to be reconciled to his daughter, and would not see her.
Next year Queen Elizabeth sympathised with him about
the ingratitude of his errant daughter, and invited him to be
"gossip" with her to a babe in whom she was interested. He
<pb n="153" id="p.153">



could not refuse, even though he may have had doubts that it
was his own grandchild, and so became reconciled to his
daughter, to whom he left all his wealth. After his death she
and her husband erected to his memory the magnificent tomb
of alabaster and coloured marble now in St. Helen's, where the
daughter, in an enormous hoop, kneels in contrition at her
father's feet.
<p>In Crosby Square are some fine old houses, and behind
one of them, No. 4, there existed until this spring one of the
very few, if not the last, gardens in the city, with a fountain and
some fig trees, once part of the garden of Crosby Place. The
fig trees were probably planted by Alderman Bond, who
occupied the house about the time these trees were first introduced into England. There have been houses on the ground
from very early times, as Roman pavements have been found there.

<div1 type="entry"><head>GREAT ST. HELEN'S</><p>
Great St. Helen's, dedicated to the mother of Constantine,
was in 1180 granted by Ranulph and his son to the Dean and
Canons of St. Paul's, by whom it was granted to William, son of
William, a goldsmith, to found a priory. The parish church
existed long before the priory, as in <date value="1010">1010</date> Bishop Alwyne
brought the body of Edmund the Martyr from Edmundsbury to
this church, so that these holy relics might not fall into the
hands of the Danish invaders, and they remained here for three
years (vide St. Gregory's). In 1551 Edward VI. granted the
advowson to Nicholas, Bishop of London, and his successors.
This grant was continued by Mary in <date value="1552">1552</date>, and has since been
<pb n="154" id="p.154">



confirmed. As it stands, the church is mostly of fifteenth-century architecture, but there are portions of the thirteenth
century. Its curious structure--two parallel naves divided by a
wall-arose from its double purpose, a nuns' church and a
parish church. The altar was in a line with the parish church, and
a wide opening permitted it to be seen from the nuns' nave.
Near the east end of the north wall are two openings through
which the nuns might see the altar from the refectory and
cloisters. These parts of the nunnery remained until <date value="1789">1789</date>.
The old hall of the nuns was taken down in 1799, having been
for a long time the Hall of the Leathersellers. St. Helen's
Place was built on the site.
<p>The finely carved pulpit is said to be the work of Inigo
Jones, and many famous men and women are buried in the
church; Sir Thomas Gresham, of whom Stow says it was his
intention to build a steeple to the church in recompense for the
space occupied by his monument; Sir John Crosby, Sir John
Spencer; and some other occupiers of Crosby Place. Sir Bartholomew Rede (of whom more anon), and Sir William Pickering,
who served four princes-Henry VIII. in the field, Edward VI.
as ambassador to France; Mary as ambassador to Germany;
and Elizabeth, whom he wished also to serve as a husband, and
at one time with considerable prospect of success. He had
been to Padua to take the baths for the relief of gout, and on
his return brought with him, and presented to Elizabeth, the
first pair of silk stockings that ever came to England. Not of
noble blood, but the beauty of his person, his manners, and his
taste in the polite arts, attracted the young Queen, and so lavish
was she of her attentions that for some weeks he was first
<pb n="155" id="p.155">



favourite; but his age was against him-he was forty-seven. For
some years he persevered in his suit; he was a Catholic, yet to
please the lady he voted in favour of the Reformation. A
wealthy man, he involved himself in debt by the expensive
presents and entertainments he provided for her; but in vain.
He was cast off, treated with coldness, and occasionally with
severity, being confined to his house by the Council as a
dangerous person for years before his death.
Sir Thomas Gresham is remembered as one of the typical
merchant princes of London, who built the first Bourse or
Exchange, where his crest, a grasshopper, still presides over
the crowded ways. The legend has it, that he was the son
of a poor woman, who in a time of dearth was unable to give
him food, and left him in a field, where the baby was found
by a boy, attracted thither by the chirping of the grasshoppers. The boy took the child home. The foster-parents
were not in much easier circumstances than the mother, but
were able to feed and clothe him, and when he had grown
to boyhood, he was sent by them to relatives in London by
carrier, to be paid for on delivery-they being too poor to
do so. He became an industrious apprentice, throve in the
city, and then, in memory of his rescue, he chose the grasshopper as his crest. This picturesque legend has evidently
been invented to explain the crest.
Sir Thomas Gresham was descended from an ancient
Norfolk family, the second son of Sir Richard Gresham, who
in 1537 was Mayor of London; born in 1519, and apprenticed
to his uncle, Sir John Gresham, a mercer. Much of his
wealth in later days was accumulated in money-broking transactions.
<pb n="156" id="p.156">



 In <date value="1552">1552</date> he became the agent for Henry VIII. in
negotiating various loans at Antwerp, having to pay fourteen per
cent. interest to the Fuggers of the Tyrol, who had many
transactions of the same sort with that King before; what he
did with the money that came into his hands all throughout
his reign will always remain a mystery. The agent of the
Fuggers, one Lazarus Tucher, reports to his employers that
Gresham "is a very extreme man, and very open mouthed."
At any rate he served Henry well. Being a Protestant, he
was dismissed from his appointments by Mary; but by Elizabeth
he was knighted and appointed for a short time ambassador
to the King of Spain's regent at Brussels. In <date value="1569">1569</date>, by his
advice, the plan was adopted of borrowing from London
merchants instead of foreigners, and shortly afterwards he
carried out the idea, originating with his father, of building
a Bourse for the merchants. This was opened with great
splendour by Elizabeth, who, "having for long withdrawn
from London owing to the plague, came to Somerset House,
and thence to the city through Chepeside to St. Christopher's Church, on the backside of the Bourse, and thence to
Bishopsgate to Sir Thomas Gresham's house, where she dined,
and thence through Bishopsgate and Cornhill to the foreside
of the Bourse, and entered to the sound of trumpets in a
most royal manner." Her reception in the city was most
enthusiastic, "She praying for the people as fast as they
prayed for her, so that at her return home, she had, in a
manner, utterly lost her voice." Gresham afterwards built for
himself the fine house at Osterly Park, Brentford, where he
entertained Queen Elizabeth and many foreign persons of
<pb n="157" id="p.157">



distinction. He died suddenly in <date value="1579">1579</date>, and by his will
directed that his town house in Bishopsgate should be converted into a college, with residence and lecture rooms for
seven professors, to be salaried out of the profits of the
Exchange; they to teach divinity, physic, astronomy,
geometry, law, rhetoric, and music.
<p>This house stood until <date value="1768">1768</date>, when the ground was
transferred to the Government, and the lectures were delivered
in a room in the Exchange until <date value="1843">1843</date>, when a lecture hall
was built, out of the accumulated funds, at the corner of
Gresham Street. His will also provided for the erection and
support of eight alms-houses.
He more than most men had proved the vanity of riches.
Thrown from his horse, he was rendered lame for life; his
only son had died, and his great wealth was a burden to him.
So that it seems more probable that it is to Ecclesiastes that
his crest refers : -
<p>"And the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall
fail, because man goeth to his long home, and mourners go
about the streets."
<p>Another story, relating to the dissolving of a great and
priceless pearl in wine, has been fathered on Sir Thomas
Gresham, but he was not that kind of a man. The real hero
of that story was of earlier date-in 502 ; and the story
is interesting as an illustration of how a citizen of London
could "spread himself" in the reign of Henry VII.
In <date value="1502">1502</date> the Mayor, Sir Bartholomew Rede, kept his
mayoralty in the Goldsmiths' Hall: "And it happened at that
time that the Admiral of France and certain other noble men
<pb n="158" id="p.158">



came as ambassadors from the French King, whom the King
did feast and honourably entertain. Then he commanded
also ye mayor to entertain them in the city of London, in
the best manner. Whereupon he desired them to dinner,
the ambassadors being accompanied by many Lords and
Gentlemen to the number of 100 persons and more, and
were placed in ye Goldsmiths' Hall, where they filled three
long tables, and were served with three course of all the
daintie meats that might be gotten for money. At the first
course every mess was served with 15 dishes, at the second
12 dishes, at the third 10 dishes, so that there were served
to each mess 37 dishes of meat, the first course all in vessels
of new white silver; the second in new silver, parcel gilt;
the third in new silver, all gilt, being all marked newly with
his own mark, and no dishes nor meat was carried out of the
Hall until the dinner was clean done; for as they were
taken off the table so they were set within a park finely
paled and cunningly decked and garnished with all manner
of sweet and goodly flowers in the midst of the Hall. After
the dinner the said meats were carried out at the gate, and
were immediately given to the poor that were orderly placed
at the street ready to receive the same.
<p>"After dinner, among other guests, was an Italian jeweller,
and he shewed forth a stone of great value, and said he had
offered the same to the French King and the King of
England, but none of them would give the value thereof. The
Mayor heard him, and said, 'Have ye offered it to our sovereign
Lord the King's grace ?' The stranger answered'Yea.' Then
said the Mayor, 'Think you the King's grace refused it for want
<pb n="159" id="p.159">



of treasure ? Let me see it,' and asked him what he valued it
at. The stranger said 1000 marks. 'And will that buy it?'
saith the Mayor. 'Yea,' saith the stranger. Then the Mayor
took the jewel and commanded one to bring him a silver
mortar and pestle, and willed his officer to beat it to powder,
and so he did. Then the Mayor called for a cup of wine,
and put it in the cup and drank it out clean; and saith to
the stranger, 'Speak honourably of the King of England,
for thou hast seen one of his poor subjects drink a thousand
marks at a draught,' and then commanded his money to be
paid him."
<p>Some of the London charities have curious ceremonies connected with them, and one of these at this church is "Bancroft's
Charity." The donor, Francis Bancroft, is embalmed in a chest
with a hinged lid, and a square of glass over his face. On
certain occasions the Warden and Court of the Drapers' Company
have to pay an official visit to the tomb and open the coffin to
see that the body is still in its place, and that there is neither
dust nor cobwebs in his tomb.
<p>Bancroft had been for many years one of the Lord
Mayor's officers, who summoned the citizens on the most
trifling occasions, pillaged the poor and the rich, took bribes
from everybody, and was a common pest; he so incurred the
wrath of the citizens that it was with great difficulty his corpse
was saved at his burial, being jostled off the bearers' shoulders,
while the people seized the bells and rang them for joy at his
unlamented death.
<p>The Jews have a great synagogue close by here, in one of
the many devious passages, which they now propose to pull
<pb n="160" id="p.160">




down. From there a narrow street leads into St. Mary Axe,
famous in light opera as the home of John Wellington Wells,
"a dealer in magic and spells." It is prosaic enough now, but an
earlier wizard has endeared the street to us by placing there the
office of Fascination Fledgeby, and peopling its narrow ways
with the gracious presence of Riah, the good Jew; the
"doll's dressmaker," Lizzie Hexam, and other characters in
Dickens's somewhat crowded novel, "Our Mutual Friend."


<div1 type="entry"><head>ST. ANDREW UNDERSHAFT, ST. MARY AXE</><p>
At the Cornhill end is the church of St. Andrew Undershaft, with its memories of John Stow and "Evil May day."
The curious name is said to have arisen "because, of old time,
every year on May morning it was used, that a high and long
shaft or maypole was set up there in the midst of the street
before the south door of the church," which shaft was higher
than the steeple, but has not been raised since "Evil May day";
it was hanged on iron hooks over the doors of the houses in
Shaft Alley till the third year of King Edward VI., when one
Stephen, a curate of St. Catherine Cree, who had distinguished himself by various zealous eccentricities such as
climbing into a tree in the churchyard to preach-one day,
preaching at Paul's Cross, denounced the maypole as "an idol of
the people." Stow relates the sequel, which he saw. "The
neighbours and tenants, after they had dined and made themselves strong, gathered much help, and, with great labour,
removed the shaft from the hooks whereon it had rested in
Shaft Alley for thirty-two years, and sawed it into pieces;
<pb n="161" id="p.161">





every man taking for his share the length over his own door,
stall, or house." The present church was begun to be built
in 1520, the north side of the middle aisle, body, and choir
being given by Stephen Jennings, merchant taylor, and sometime Lord Mayor, his arms being carved on every pillar; he
died in <date value="1524">1524</date>. The church was repaired and beautified in
<date value="1629">1629</date>, <date value="1704">1704</date>, and 1723. It is one of the latest in Perpendicular
architecture, and is said to be the first erected in London with a
special view to the Reformed worship. The large west window
contains portraits of Edward VI., Elizabeth, James I., Charles I.,
and Charles II., removed there from the east window during
restoration work about <date value="1876">1876</date>. Perhaps its principal attraction
for us now is that it contains the tomb of John Stow, whose
"Survey of London" is practically the basis of all investigation
into the history of the city. His upright honesty of purpose
and candour of expression raised up for him hosts of enemies.
Finding many charities appropriated to other uses, he did not
mince matters in saying so; occasionally he made statements
which fuller inquiries showed to be unfounded; but the dislike
he aroused in many prominent men was evidence of the truth
of many of them. In <date value="1544">1544</date> he was accused by a priest, and
Grindal, Bishop of London (one of John Foxe's patrons in <date value="1566">1566</date>),
had his house searched for papistical books, but nothing was
found, and the priest was put in the pillory and branded "F. A."
(false accuser). If Stow had been more supple it would have
been better for him in a worldly sense, and the two licences to
beg, granted to him by James I., would not have been necessary.
They were surely a painful reward for all his industry.
This licence is such a brilliant example of kingly parsimony
<pb n="162" id="p.162">



 and long-winded verbosity that we can imagine it compiled by James himself.
<p>"James, by the Grace of God King of England, Scotland,

for the whole space of five and forty years until Christmas
last past, besides his pains and charge in making his book
called the 'Survey of London,' wherein he spent eight years
in searching out of antient records concerning antiquities of
London and Southwark, hath been an humble suitor to us
that we would be pleased to grant him a licence under the
Great Seal to gather the Benevolence of well-disposed people
within this Realm of England in recompense of his said labour

<pb n="164" id="p.164">



<p>This is the second licence, the first, issued in <date value="1604">1604</date>,
being for twelve months only. What success the appeal had
can only be judged by an entry on the back of the first licence,
signed by the churchwarden of St. Mary Woolnoth, stating
that the parishioners had collected 7s. 6d. John Stow died in
the April following the issue of the second licence, aged eighty
years, leaving a widow and four daughters.
<p>At the very time these licences were issued, the King
and Queen were engaged squandering thousands of pounds per
annum, and wasting the talents of Inigo Jones and Ben Jonson
<p>in the production of silly masques.
Philip Malpas, one of the sheriffs, was buried here in
<date value="1539">1539</date>, leaving, by his testament, <date value="l125">l125</date> to the poor prisoners,
125 to the other poor, every year for five years, together with
400 shirts and smocks, 150 gowns, and 40 pairs of sheets;
to poor maids' marriages, 100 marks; to highways, 100 marks;
to 500 poor people in London, 6s. 8d.; and 2os. by the year
for 20 years to the preachers of the 'Spital, and 20 marks
to a graduate to preach abroad in the countries. Queen Elizabeth united the parish of St. Mary Axe to this in the fourth
year of her reign. As we have seen, the merchants of the
Hanseatic League had the duty of repairing Bishopsgate; part
of the wall they also had to repair and defend, and when their
thirteenth-century trouble was over, the Mayor and citizens
confirmed to them their former liberties, amongst which were,
that they could appoint an alderman, provided he was an
inhabitant of London, and that they might land and store corn
for forty days before bringing it to market. No wheat corners
were allowed in those days. The district still retains the merchanting

<pb n="165" id="p.165">



 of the produce from the Baltic, though the merchants
no longer dwell there, as they did in the earlier centuries.
After flourishing here for over three centuries, the League was
expelled by Mary, the reason being given that they had engrossed nearly the whole trade of the kingdom. The year
previous to their dissolution they exported 40,000 pieces of
cloth, while all the English merchants together did not export
1100.
<p>At the upper end of St. Mary Axe was the house of priests
called "St. Augustine, Pappy in the Wall." This was founded in
1430 by William Oliver, William Barnabie, and John Stafford,
for poor and impotent priests; it was probably a house for aged
priests of the order of St. Augustine, one inmate being mentioned as the builder of the London Bridge of the time. They
were much employed in singing "diriges " at funerals.
The brotherhood continued until the time of Edward VI.,
when it was suppressed, their house being afterwards occupied
by a Mr. Morris, Sir Francis Walsingham, Mr. Barrett, and
others. Next to this was a "great" house, with courts and
gardens, belonging to the Abbots of Bury, in Suffolk. Bury
Street still records the name. After the dissolution it was owned
by Thomas Heneage, and by his son, Sir Thomas Heneage. By
some tortuous method of reasoning, the name of Bevis Marks has
been assigned as originating from this house, but the reasoning is
so difficult to follow that it may be dismissed as improbable.
The "Tun" of Cornhill stood in the middle of the street,
where it merges into Leadenhall Street; there was a pillory in
connection with it, where thievish millers and other culprits
were often placed. According to Grafton, it was, until <date value="1400">1400</date>, a
<pb n="166" id="p.166">



prison for priests-rather a surprising statement, and yet, considering the multitude of religious houses in the neighbourhood,
not improbable. In that year it was turned into a conduit at
the cost of the city. These conduits (really tanks from which
water could be drawn off) increased in number as the city spread,
rendering private wells insufficient and dangerous for the population. The water collected at various springs outside the town
was conveyed to these in leaden pipes at great expense, these
pipes having all to be made of sheet lead and soldered, until
<date value="1535">1535</date>, when Robert Brock, clerk, being then one of the
chaplains to King Henry VIII., invented "a manner of making
and casting pipes of lead wherein no solder is occupied, where
before this time ye plumbers made huge and great pipes, of most
importunate charge, as well of lead and solder as of workmanship. And by this new invention two men and a boy may, in
one day, cast of ye said pipes 300 yards in length, which before
could not be done without many men in many days, nor without double and triple charge. And after the invention hereof,
Robert Couper, Goldsmith, was ye first maker of the instruments
and practiser of the same."
<p>Apparently the plumber made our forefathers groan also.
The Act of <date value="1543">1543</date> has been noticed, giving powers to bring
water from the northern districts. This conduit was supplied with
water from Tyborne, which at an earlier date had been brought
to London by William Estfield, the Mayor in <date value="1437">1437</date>. "He
being made a knight, a right worshipful man and a great benefactor to the city of London, travailed to procure waters for the
same, and gathered a goodly store of water together from divers
springs into one place near to Tyborne, where the same remained
<pb n="167" id="p.167">



and stood still, for want of money, for five years. In the mean
season the said William Estfield had of his own costs and charges
laid one pipe of lead, and brought the same as far as Lady
Rounceval which was at Charing Cross, and then died. After
his death, his executors, John Fray, Richard Riche, and Roger
Barkes, made their humble suit unto the Lord Mayor and
Commons of the city, that they might not only be licensed to
bring the water in the pipe before laid by Estfield, but also that
they might be further licensed to bring and convey the water
from Rounceval into the conduits of the city, which they not
only offered of their own good wills freely to do, with the goods
of the said Master Estfield; but also they were content to enter
into covenant with the city for the performance of the same, and
did it accordingly. God send many such fathers and such
executors to the city of London."
<p>On the other side of Leadenhall Street, near the corner
of Lime Street, stood, until the latter part of the nineteenth
century, East India House, the headquarters of "John Company" for many years: the house has entirely disappeared, but
some of the vaults still remain. The accumulated treasures
were taken to South Kensington to form the present India
Museum. The place was of the greatest interest to us because
Charles Lamb spent the larger part of his life there as a
clerk.

<div1 type="entry"><head>ST. CATHERINE CREE</><p>
Towards Aldgate is the church of St. Catherine Cree, or
Christ's Church, as it was sometimes called, "which standeth
in the cemetery of the Priory of Holy Trinity, Minories."
<pb n="168" id="p.168">



The present church was built in <date value="1630">1630</date>, this being necessary
owing to the ground having been raised so high round the
old church that the congregation had to descend several steps
on entering it. The design is somewhat curious, and has
been attributed to Inigo Jones. The dial, so well known
to wayfarers in Leadenhall Street, was erected in <date value="1662">1662</date>. The
church escaped the fire, and was largely repaired in <date value="1686">1686</date>.
The old building appears to have been merely a mortuary
chapel, and came gradually into use as a parish church, and
was the source of many disputes between the citizens and
the friars. The present church was consecrated by Laud
on January 16, 1630-31. Some extraordinary ceremonies were
expected by the people, and the episode was fully described
by Prynne and others who came there to see. The bowings,
knockings, and genuflections then indulged in were part of
the "novelties in religion" which brought Laud to the block
on Tower Hill. Hans Holbein is buried here, and the Earl
of Arundel, in later days, wished to raise a memorial to
him, but the place where he lay could not be identified;
as he died of plague, his burial inside the church was
improbable. Among others who rest here are Sir Nicholas
Throgmorton, who died in <date value="1570">1570</date> ; a street in the city perpetuates his name, and Sir Walter Raleigh helped to keep
his memory somewhat green by eloping with his daughter;
Sir John Rainsforth, whose funeral was conducted with great
pomp. It is related, when the mourners (all being done)
went to his house for dinner, his lady, in token of her profound sorrow, would not join them, but when all were gone
she came forth and had four eggs and a dish of butter only,
<pb n="169" id="p.169">



for her dinner, thus showing that while others feasted, she
went fasting. There is also one of the fulsome monuments
raised in memory of Queen Elizabeth, such as have been noticed
previously. Interesting celebrations are the annual Flower
Sermon, and, on the 16th November, the Lion Sermon; the
latter is the gift of Sir John Gage, Lord Mayor in <date value="1646">1646</date>, in
commemoration "of his happy deliverance from a Lion which
he met in the desart, as he was travelling in the Turkish
dominions, which suffered him to pass by unmolested." African
House marks the site of Sir Nicholas Throgmorton's dwelling;
while nearer Aldgate was another large house, presented by
Henry VIII. to Mrs. Cornwallis and her heirs as a reward
for a dish of fine black puddings made by that lady and sent
to the King.
<p>John Stow lived near the pump at Aldgate, which still
survives as a landmark. Another church stood just to the west
-St. Michael's, built by Prior Norman about <date value="1110">1110</date>. The crypt
existed until <date value="1870">1870</date>, when it was destroyed in widening the street.
One or two timbered houses still stand here, but they
are plastered and painted into a somewhat Victorian appearance.
Aldgate stood on the south of Aldgate Church, Duke's
Place and "Poor Jewry Lane" being inside. A lease of the
gatehouse was granted, in <date value="1374">1374</date>, to Chaucer, on the condition
that he "will completely and sufficiently maintain and repair
the same, under penalty of being 'ousted.'" Like all the other
city gates, it was from time to time the centre of stirring scenes.
In <date value="1471">1471</date>, in May, Thomas Neville, bastard son of Lord
Fawconbridge, gathered unto him a riotous company of shipmen
and others, both of Essex and Kent, and came to London,
<pb n="170" id="p.170">



where they were denied passage through the city. They set
upon divers parts thereof, as Bishop's Gate, and Aldgate,
London Bridge, and along the water side, and shot guns and
arrows, and fired the two gates, and fought so fiercely that
they won the bulwarks at Aldgate, and certain of them entered
within the gate. But the citizens withstood the rebels, and
slew such as entered, and compelled the others to draw back
and forsake the gate, when the citizens pursued and chased
them to Stratford, and slew and took many prisoners. The
heads of Spifing and Quentine, two captains, were set on
Aldgate, but Neville escaped, and was captured and beheaded
at Southampton.
<p>The accession of Mary found a great many people "sitting
on the fence," to use a modern phrase, and amongst these was
Elizabeth; but after Arundel had argued, and Pembroke drawn
his sword-" This sword shall make Mary queen, or I will die
in her quarrel"-proclaimed at Paul's Cross, "Te Deum" sung
in the cathedral, beer, wine, and money distributed among
the people, Dr. Sands, who had preached against the daughters
of Henry the Sunday before, proceeded to the market-place
with tears on his cheeks, proclaimed the Lady Mary, and threw
his cap into the air in token of joy. Elizabeth, at the head
of one hundred and fifty horse, proceeded to Aldgate to meet
her sister as she arrived from Framlingham, and rode with
her through the streets, lined with the citizens in their gayest
attire; and, stunned by the acclamations of the people, they
entered the Tower together, where Mary liberated the State
prisoners and gave a dole of eightpence to every poor house-
holder in the city.

That Aldgate was taken down in <date value="1606">1606</date> and a new one
built. This was finally removed in <date value="1761">1761</date>.
Duke's Place and its continuation, Bevis Marks, mark the
course of the city wall. Many of the houses in Duke's Place
were of seventeenth-century date. Here the first colony of the
Jews settled when Cromwell allowed their return to England.
Curiously, with one exception, it is now entirely deserted by
that people. The name marks the site of the house of the
Duke of Norfolk, described as the manor-house by Christ-church, Aldgate, where Holbein died, and where Foxe the
martyrologist was received when he returned to London.
The Duke of Norfolk losing his head on Tower Hill, the
mansion descended to Thomas Howard, Earl of Suffolk, eldest
son of the said Duke by Lord Audley's daughter. He, on
the <date value="1583-07-31">31st July 1583</date>, sold the same to the Mayor, commonalty,
and citizens of London, "to have and to hold in as large
and simple manner as the said Earl, or Lord Audley, or the
King, or the Prior and convent, or their predecessors had used
or enjoyed the same, by virtue of any grant, privilege, prescription, law, custom, or any other ways or means whatever."
The name of the ward, Portsoken-a franchise by the gate
-dates back to about 970<date value="970"></date>, the reign of King Edgar, "when
certain knights beloved of the King, for services by them done,
requested to have a certain portion of the land on the east part
of the city, which had been left desolate and forsaken by the
inhabitants by reason of too much servitude; they besought the
King to have this land, with the liberty of a Guild, for ever.
Their request was granted, on the following conditions: that
each should victoriously accomplish three combats; one above
<pb n="172" id="p.172">



ground, one on the ground, and one in the water (this
probably means on horseback, on foot, and in the water),
and after this, that they at East Smithfield, on a certain day,
should run with spears against all comers. All of which they
gloriously accomplished, and the King named them 'Knighten
Guild.' The land extended from Aldgate to the east on both
sides of the street, north to Bishopsgate, and south unto the
Thames, and so far into the water as a horseman may ride at low
water, and throw his spear. These knights had no charter all
the days of Edgar, Ethelred, and Canute, until the time of
Edward the Confessor, whom the heirs of the knights besought
to confirm their liberties, which he graciously granted. After-
wards William, the son of William the Conqueror, made a
confirmation of these liberties in the words :
"'William, King of England, to Maurice, Bishop, and
Godfrey de Magnum, and Richard de Parre, and to his faithful
people of London, Greeting: Know ye me to have granted to
the men of the Knighten Guild, the Guild that belonged to
them, and the land that belonged thereunto, with all customs as
they had the same in the times of King Edward, and my father.
Witness, Hugh de Buche at Rething [Reading].'"
The priory was founded by Matilda, wife of Henry I., for
canons regular of the order of St. Augustine in <date value="1108">1108</date>. This was
during the outburst of religious enthusiasm that gave us St. Giles',
Cripplegate, St. Bartholomew's, and the first great St. Paul's,
"and the multitude of Brethren praising of God day and night
therein in short time so increased that all the city was delighted
in beholding of them, insomuch that, in 1115, certain burgesses
of London, progeny of these knights, coming to the chapter-house
<pb n="173" id="p.173">



 of the church of Holy Trinity, gave that church and
canons all the lands and soke called the Knighten Guild, which
lieth to the wall of the city and stretcheth to the Thames. They
gave it by the hands of Prior Norman, and the better to confirm
this grant, they offered on the altar the charter of Edward,
together with other charters, and afterwards did put the prior
aforesaid in seisen thereof by the church of St. Botolph, which is
the head of the land (this would refer to St. Botolph, Bishopsgate).
Henry, the son of this King, confirmed the charter and gave
them sack and soke, Toll and Thea Infang, these and all
customs belonging to it. The Prior, being seised of these lands,
was admitted as one of the Aldermen of London, and as such sat
in the court till the dissolution of the monasteries." The land
included St. Catherine's by the Tower, but that part was granted
in the next reign to Maud, the wife of King Stephen. This
shows all the land belonging to the knights as outside the wall,
so that they only endowed the priory after it was built. "The
priory occupied a piece of ground 300 feet long, near a
parochial chapel, St. Michael's, which stood where now (<date value="1742">1742</date>)
are rows of houses by the pump." In order to establish the
foundation, four parishes-St. Mary Magdalene, St. Michael,
St. Catherine, and the Blessed Trinity-were united and called
Christ Church.
Prior Norman built and furnished the house so well with
books and vestments, that a day came when there was nothing
left to buy food, and the brothers sat in the refectory a hungered,
which being seen by the citizens, the women vowed to bring
each a loaf every Sunday, and soon there was food for all. But
by the beginning of the thirteenth century the citizens and the
<pb n="174" id="p.174">



monks were not on such gracious terms, and the passage thirteen
feet broad, inside the city wall, was stopped up with an earthen
wall by the prior. During the life of Henry III. it was useless
for the citizens to protest against anything; the King was
angered with them, because they would not join in the crusades;
so it remained till Edward I. ascended the throne, when the
citizens protested to the Judges Itinerant, saying the way was
stopped to the hurt of the city, and disinheriting the King; the
earthen wall was then removed.
The priory passed to the Crown at the dissolution of the
monasteries, and was given by Henry VIII., with the church of
St. Catherine Cree, to Sir Thomas Audley, who by his will, on
<date value="1544-04-19">April 19, 1544</date>, granted this church to the masters and fellows of
Magdalen College, Cambridge, and their successors, to serve as a
cure for ever. They leased the church to the parishioners for ninety
years, but disputes arising among them, it was, at the expiry of
the lease in <date value="1725">1725</date>, leased to Jerome Knapp, a haberdasher in
London. The priory was granted by Charles I. to the first Earl
of Dartmouth. The church of St. James was built on the
site, out of the materials of the priory, about <date value="1623">1623</date>, and soon
acquired notoriety as the scene of many irregular marriages. In
<date value="1686">1686</date> the incumbent was suspended for three years, on account
of these scandals ; but three months later, it was discovered that
the church was extra-parochial and not subject to the ordinary.
The marriages went on as before, and thirty to forty couples were
married in a day. Between <date value="1664">1664</date> and <date value="1691">1691 </date>there were 40,000
of these weddings. The church was pulled down in <date value="1874">1874</date>, and
many of the bodies buried in the churchyard removed to Ilford
cemetery.
<pb n="175" id="p.175">

















<div1 type="entry"><head>ALDGATE WARD SCHOOL AND ST. BOTOLPH'S</><p>
At an earlier date (<date value="1810">1810</date>) the school, belonging to St.
Catherine Cree, which was in Cree Church Lane, was pulled
down and a school built on the site of the rectory of St. James.
In the old school forty boys were clothed and taught; when
removed, the clothing was abolished and more boys taught
instead. An infants' school adjoined this, and the infants' play-
ground was part of the churchyard, cemented over, a few of the
tombstones still standing against the wall, a somewhat serious
introduction to life for the infants.
The boys' school is now closed, and both having been
acquired by Sir John Cass's foundation, a large modern school
has been erected on the site. Part of the boys' school was used
as a ward meeting-room, and contained some interesting portraits,
but perhaps the most curious features were the fig trees in this
and adjoining gardens; some of these had been polled, and some
were trained on the walls; they were of great size, and cannot
have been of much later date than <date value="1530">1530</date>. Without a doubt they
formed part of a fig garden planted by the monks of Holy
Trinity. Large quantities of figs were borne by these trees, but
owing either to changes of atmosphere, or of culture, they no
longer ripened, but fell when fully formed. They formed a curious
and living link between the twentieth century and medieval
times, and few people dreamed that so near the tormented streets
by Aldgate such a pleasaunce existed-lilac planted by schoolboys
of a past generation and fig trees planted probably about the
time of their first introduction into England ; the old tiled roofs
<pb n="176" id="p.176">



of Duke's Place and the spire of St. Botolph; where rest,
among others, Lord Dacre, beheaded in <date value="1537">1537</date>, and Sir Nicholas
Carew, who suffered the same fate in <date value="1538">1538</date>, and that
Robert Don, the merchant, who, in <date value="1612">1612</date>, left the money for
the admonition addressed to condemned prisoners at Newgate.
In this church, in <date value="1742">1742</date>, a brass plate was inscribed to his
memory, with an account of his many charities. The Merchant
Taylors raised a handsome monument to him, relating that he
gave in his lifetime 3528, 10s.. 8d. to perform charitable
deeds for ever. "He lived virtuously all his lifetime, and died
in the faith of our Lord Jesus on the 2nd May, A.D. <date value="1612">1612</date>,
being full of days, at the age of near ninety years."
In the early part of the eighteenth century it is stated
that near Aldgate are divers considerable inns, much resorted
to, and from which ply a great number of short stages; these
are "The Three Nuns," "The Crown," "The Black Bull," and
"The Blue Boar."
<p>Poor Jewry was a sort of sanctuary, in which dwelt Jews
and others who had forsaken their faith, and priests who had
taken wives.
<p>By Hog Lane, which in later times became Petticoat Lane,
there was a space reserved for the citizens practising archery;
there, in <date value="1574">1574</date>, Benedict Spinola made twenty tenter-yards,
and certain gardens to relieve poor cloth-workers whose tenteryards in and about London had been built on and destroyed.
Ten years later it was presented as a grievance, "that this
land had been enclosed, preventing the archers from practising
their art, it having been previously open and common, and
the occupiers were ordered to remove their fences and buildings.
<pb n="177" id="p.177">



The tenants contended that Hog Lane was never used by the
archers, by reason of standing puddles, lay stalls, and filthy
ditches; and the way by Hog Lane was so foul and deep
in winter, that no man could pass, while in summer they
would not pass, for fear of infection from the filthiness that
lay there."
<p>Benedict Spinola apparently won the case, as he afterwards,
at great cost, levelled and cleaned the place, again making
tenter-yards and improving the passages and paths. The name
"Petticoat Lane" probably arose from the drying of cloth
or garments in these yards.
<p>In the parish of St. Botolph, beside the charity school
noticed, there were two others, one erected by Sir John Cass,
alderman, for fifty boys and forty girls; and another founded
by Samuel Starling, knight and alderman, in <date value="1673">1673</date>, for forty
boys and thirty girls; this latter was kept in his own brick
house on Little Tower Hill, at the east end of the Quest
or Town House. In the Minories, towards Aldgate, was an
abbey of nuns of the Order of St. Clare, called the Minors,
founded by the Earl of Lancaster, brother of Edward I., in
<date value="1293">1293</date>. In the plague of <date value="1515">1515</date>, there died in this house
twenty-seven nuns, besides servants. At the dissolution, the
house was surrendered by the abbess, Dame Elizabeth Salvage,
in <date value="1539">1539</date>. In the nuns' church were buried Mrs. Trussel
(the lady mentioned at St. Dunstan's), the Duchess of Norfolk,
<date value="1506">1506</date>, Lady Ellen Nevil, sister to the Lord of Raby, and
many others. This church and all the nunnery have long
been swept away.
<p>Returning westward, it may be noted that part of
<pb n="178" id="p.178">



Leadenhall Market stands on the site of an ancient charity.
In <date value="1445">1445</date>, Simond Eyze, commonly called Simpkin Eyse,
"builded Leadenhall in London and a chapel in the end
thereof, and on the gate is written this sentence: 'Dextera
Domine Exaltante me'-that is, 'God hath exalted me,' and
in this hall he left a stock of one thousand pound, to be
employed in summer in wood and coal, for the relief of
the poor in winter; the which stock, it was said, was after
borrowed by King Edward IIII., but it was not repaid, and
the city hath it not."
<p>In <date value="1309">1309</date> Leadenhall belonged to Sir Hugh Nevill, and
his widow made a feoffment of Leadenhall, with the advowsons
of St. Peter's and other churches, to Richard, Earl of Arundel,
in <date value="1362">1362</date>; passing through various hands until <date value="1408">1408</date>, when
Robert Rikeden of Essex and his wife confirmed it to Richard
Whittington and other citizens of London, with the advowsons
of St. Peter's, St. Margaret Pattens, and other churches; in
1411 Whittington and others confirmed the same to the Mayor
and Commonalty of the City of London.
<p>In <date value="1502">1502</date>, aggrieved by foreigners disposing of their
merchandise, it was petitioned, that in future all foreigners
might be restricted and compelled to bring all the small wares
by them imported, to be sold in Leadenhall Market only,
upon penalty of forfeiting such goods if sold elsewhere. In
<date value="1534">1534</date> foreign butchers, non-freemen, kept their stalls in
Leadenhall Street, where they sold their meat on Wednesdays
and Saturdays before the citizens' houses, and the inhabitants
thereof made considerable advantage of the ground whereon
they stood (charging rent from the butchers). This being
<pb n="179" id="p.179">



observed by the Lord Mayor's court, they obliged these
butchers to repair to Leadenhall Market to dispose of their
meat, stalls being erected for their accommodation, and thereby
the revenue of the city was considerably increased.
Lime Street, near the north-west corner thereof, was the
site of the second tall house in London. The first was Crosby
Place. The house here was built by Richard Wethel, a merchant taylor-the first house built of timber-to overlook his
neighbours; an evil example that has been copied ever since.
A resident in the street, Alderman Malpes, was robbed of
his goods by Jack Cade; and at the time of Evil May day,
the same house was occupied by John Mutas, a Frenchman,
who harboured there many of his countrymen, who calendered
worsted. The 'prentices and citizens spoiled the house, and
if they could have found Mutas, intended to behead him,
but he escaped, much to their disappointment.


<div1 type="entry"><head>CORNHILL AND LOMBARD STREET</><p>
St. Peter's, Cornhill, claims to be the first church founded
in Britain, in <date value="179">179</date> A.D., the founder being Lucius, the first
Christian king of London, who made it an archbishop's see;
and so it endured for four hundred years, until the coming
of St. Augustine, who removed the see to Canterbury, while
Millet, a monk who came with him, was made the first
Bishop of London, and removed the see to St. Paul's. All this
may be true, but the first authentic record is in <date value="1298">1298</date>, when
William Kingston gave to the church his tenement in Grass
Street, called Horse Mill.
<pb n="180" id="p.180">



<p>There are a few literary memories in the space lying
between Leadenhall Street and Fenchurch Street, Lombard
Street and Cornhill. The most prominent church, St. Michael's,
was rebuilt by Wren in <date value="1672">1672</date>, and the tower, from Wren's
design, in <date value="1722">1722</date>. Abutting on the churchyard is an old tavern,
the "Bell," which is evidently one of the houses built just
after the Great Fire. Only a small part of the yard remains
in front of the house. Pope was born in Plough Court in
<date value="1688">1688</date>, and Thomas Gray, whose "Elegy" is one of the bestknown poems in the English language, was the son of a
scrivener in Cornhill, born there in <date value="1716">1716</date>.
In the church of St. Edmund the King and Martyr,
Lombard Street, Joseph Addison married trouble when, on
the <date value="1716-08-09">9th August, 1716</date>, he took to wife Charlotte, Countess of
Warwick and Holland.
<p>At St. Mary Woolnoth, facing the Mansion House, we
come to memories of Cowper. John Newton, for many years
curate at Olney, and companion of Cowper, became incumbent
of this church. He and his wife were buried in the vaults,
but were removed to Olney when the basement of the church
was turned into an electric railway station. A tablet to his
memory records that "John Newton, clerk, and once an infidel
and libertine, a servant of slaves in Africa, was, by the rich
mercy of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, preserved, restored,
pardoned, and appointed to preach the faith he had so long
laboured to destroy."
Newton had been a slave dealer and trader, and his friendship with Cowper is one of the strange things of which the
world shows so many.
<pb n="181" id="p.181">



<p>The Mansion House, or official residence of the Lord
Mayor during his term of office, was erected in <date value="1739">1739</date> from
designs by the elder Dance, the bas-relief on the pediment
being designed to represent the dignity and opulence of the
city. Part of the space was occupied by the stocks, the
only pair in the city until <date value="1472">1472</date>, when the Mayor, Sir William
Hampton, issued orders that there should be one pair in each
ward "for the more effectual punishment of vagabonds."
These were mostly used for venial offences and for beggars,
who were so many in London that the first act of Henry VIII.
was to cause all the "foreign" beggars (that is, beggars from
another district) to be banished from the town and sent to
their respective parishes.
<p>The Bank of England across the way was first opened for
business in <date value="1734">1734</date>, but the building was soon found too small,
and in <date value="1788">1788</date> Mr. (afterwards Sir John) Soane was appointed
the architect for the building.
<p>The "Stockes" market occupied, from <date value="1408">1408</date>, part of the
space at the nether end of Poultry. In St. Mildred's Church,
long vanished, was buried Thomas Tusser, courtier, farmer,
chorister, and fiddler. His epitaph recorded that-
"Here Thomas Tusser, clad in earth, doth lie,
That sometime made the 'Points of Husbandrie.'
By him thou maiest here learn, we must
When all is done we sleep, and turn to dust."
Published in <date value="1557">1557</date>, his book shows much wise theory and
sound knowledge, which the author apparently failed to put in
practice.
<p>Thomas a Becket was born in this street. In <date value="1134">1134</date> it is
<pb n="182" id="p.182">



noted that "a great part of London was brent by fire, began
at Gilbert Beckett's house." In later times the Mercer's Chapel,
at the east corner of Ironmonger Lane, was built on the site.


<div1 type="entry"><head>ST. MARY-LE-BOW, CHEAPSIDE</><p>
A little to the west is the church of St. Mary-le-Bow,
known by name to millions of people who never saw it. Of
ancient foundation, dating from <date value="1087">1087</date>-the crypt of that date
still surviving-it has a varied history. In <date value="1271">1271</date> the steeple fell
and slew many people, both men and women, and was not
rebuilt for more than a hundred years. In <date value="1284">1284</date> "Lawrence
Duckett, citizen and goldsmith of London, quarrelled with one
Rauf Crepin, mercer in Cheapside, and gave him a sore wound,
and thereupon fled into Bow Church, and there remained all
night; and in the night time the friends of the said Crepin
entered into the church and slew the said Duckett, and afterwards hanged him in a window as if he had hanged himself;
for which murder there were seven men condemned, which
were drawn and hanged, and one woman was burnt, and divers
others committed to the Tower, and there remained prisoners
a long time after." Various trials by "ordeal" took place in
the church, and the arches or bows facing Cheapside were
used as stands for privileged spectators to witness tourneys in
Cheapside. The great bell rang curfew for that part of the
city, and in the fourteenth century it was ordered "that no
person shall be seen armed in the streets, no brewer keep open
his doors, after curfew is rung at Bow." In <date value="1469">1469</date> it was
<pb n="183" id="p.183">



ordained that this be done at 9 P.M. The ringer was very unpopular among the 'prentices, who threatened his life because
he rang late. He even provoked them into poetry-bad poetry,
though not destitute of meaning-
<lb>"Clerk of the Bow Bell,
<lb>With the yellow locks,
<lb>For thy late ringing
<lb>Thy head shall have knocks.'
<lb>To this the clerk replied-
<lb>"Children of the Cheap,
<lb>Hold you all still,
<lb>For you shall have this
<lb>Bow Bell rung at your will."
<p>The dispute implies that 9 P.M. was the hour when the youths
ceased work, otherwise their grievance cannot be understood.
They certainly would not have grumbled at his late ringing
for bedtime. In <date value="1472">1472</date> John Donne, a mercer, gave to the
parson and churchwardens "two tenements in Hosier Lane
for the maintenance of the bell." Hosier Lane was anciently
known as Cordwainer Street, then as Hosier Lane, and finally
as Bow Lane. To this parish were annexed the parishes of
All Hallows' Honey Lane, and St. Pancras. The church of
St. Pancras stood on the north side of Pancras Lane, near
Queen Street. In the eighteenth century it is stated that there
belong to the church three houses in Bow Churchyard, two in
Bow Lane, and l12 per year from Lloyd's Coffee-house, belonging to the same.
In Bow Churchyard was a Grammar-school erected by
Henry VI. This school remained until <date value="1737">1737</date>, when it had
to make way for the corner house and that adjoining.
<pb n="184" id="p.184">



The drawing shows the church on the western side. The
spire is much foreshortened, this being inevitable owing to the
confined space rendering a more distant view impossible, while
it is the only position in which the church can be shown.
Some of the church courts used to sit here, and here
the Bishops of London are always consecrated. In <date value="1611">1611</date>
J. Chapman, a city merchant, left money for the purpose that
a sermon be preached here annually in August to commemorate
the destruction of the Spanish Armada. It is a very plain
building, and the beautiful spire, rebuilt by Wren, cost nearly as
much as all the rest of the church, on the outer wall of which,
facing Bow Churchyard, there is a tablet to the memory of
John Milton, and inside one to John Coventry, one of the
executors of Richard Whittington.
Generations of children have repeated the nursery rhyme
beginning, " Oranges and lemons, says the bell of St. Clement's,"
and finishing with a reference to " the great bell of Bow," until
it has become quite common for people to speak of the whole
edifice as Bow Bells, while the distinction of being a real
Cockney, pertaining only to those born within sound of this
bell, is a very old popular idea. Nowadays its tones do not
penetrate any great distance over the noisy streets, but of olden
days there is nothing improbable in the legend making Dick
Whittington hear its voice at Highgate, bidding him turn again
towards London and fortune.
Nowadays it is the hoarse voice of Big Ben at Westminster
that carries farthest in the silent night hours, bearing, mayhap,
the same message of allurement to that old city of many hopes,
of many legends, and of many mysteries.
<pb n="185" id="p.185">




<p>There were several celebrated taverns in Cheapside. One
of these, the "Nag's Head," had for long a considerable place
in Church history, with reference to the laying on of hands
and the due succession of bishops. This so-called "Nag's
Head" consecration relates to the proper induction of Archbishop Parker, after the Act of Uniformity was passed by
Elizabeth. There being only one bishop left-Llandaff he
refused to officiate; and the tale was told, and believed, that in
this tavern the new bishops laid a Bible on their heads and consecrated themselves. Really, the election took place at Canterbury,
the confirmation at St. Mary-le-Bow, and the consecration at
Lambeth, those who officiated being Scory of Hereford, Barlow
of Wells, Miles Coverdale of Exeter, and Hodgekin, Suffragan
of Hereford. All these dined at the "Nag's Head" after the
confirmation, and out of that fact the story was manufactured.


<div1 type="entry"><head>BREAD STREET</><p>
Between Bread Street and Friday Street stood the "Mermaid Tavern," and in a court running towards Bow Church,
somewhere on the spot where Copestake's warehouse now
stands, John Milton was born in 1608, the son of a scrivener,
at the sign of the "Spread Eagle." Of yeoman stock, the
sign was probably borrowed from the arms of the Miltons of
Thame. His father was an accomplished musician, and composed the two well-known psalm tunes "York " and "Norwich."
Here the poet spent the first sixteen years of his life. By
the time he finished at Cambridge his father had retired to
Horton, near Windsor, and there, with occasional pilgrimages to
<pb n="186" id="p.186">



London, his life was spent until <date value="1637">1637</date>, when, on the death of his
mother, he went to Italy, not returning till <date value="1639">1639</date>.
The street is now prosaic enough, for all its memories.
There is still one church standing in it-that with the curious
name of "St. Margaret Moses." All the area was swept by
the fire of <date value="1666">1666</date>, and though the churches were rebuilt afterwards, they have since vanished, leaving only the one having the
smallest interest; All Hallows stood until <date value="1876">1876</date>. This was
the one of which John Knox was rector. It seems the most
unlikely place in the world to look for memories of the Scottish
reformer. He came to England after he was released from the
French galleys, to which he was sent when captured in St.
Andrews Castle, and remained four years-from <dateRange from="1549" to="1554">1549 to 1554</dateRange> .
He was appointed one of Edward VI.'s chaplains and rector of
this church, and lived on terms of intimacy with Cranmer and
other English reformers until the accession of Mary again drove
him to the Continent.
<p>There was also at one time the prison known as Bread
Street Compter, previously noticed.
<p>In this street, as in many others in the city, a few of the
posts remain which at one time were the only protection of the
footpath, and often referred to in old regulations, such as that of
1667, which orders "that all beggars, vagrants, tankard bearers,
or porters and other persons bearing burdens, shall not walk
within the posts at the sides of the streets from 6 A.M. to 9 P.M. ;
the two first, on pain of prosecution to the utmost rigour of the
law ; the last two, under penalties of four pence for each offence."
Bread Street is now largely occupied by warehouses and
filled with the surge of human traffic from Monday morning till

Saturday afternoon, when the tide ebbs, the city man and the
city maid go home, and few except the policemen are left; these,
with time heavy on their hands, have little to enliven the tedium
for the next thirty-six hours-solitary guardians on the shores of
a sea of old romance.


<div1 type="entry"><head>HATTON GARDEN</><p>
West of Smithfield is what was for long the Italian quarter
of London ; there are many other colonies of that nation now in
different parts of the town. Still, in Eyre Street and Saffron
Hill there remain enough to give a foreign flavour to the district.
Many of the streets here have been built on the ground
and gardens of Ely Place.
<p>At one time this house must have been in the possession of
the serjeants-at-law, as on Michaelmas term, <date value="1463">1463</date>, they kept
their feast at Ely Place, Holborn.
<p>"To this feast, the Mayor of London, his brethren, ye
Aldermen and Sheriffs, were bidde; and, at ye day appointed,
they came thither, but where they should be set at table, there
was placed the Lord Gray of Ruthin (which was treasurer of
England) to keep the state in ye hall. The Mayor perceiving
that, and considering the same had not been used in times past,
neither was it agreeable with the privilege granted by the King
to the Mayors of London-that they should in all places within
the city of London and suburbs of the same, take the chief
place among all manner of persons (except the King himself
were present), and thinking also within himself that he should
much offend the whole state of the city, if he should consent to
<pb n="188" id="p.188">



any such precedent, did therefore suddenly withdraw himself and
his brethren from thence, and went home to his own house to
dinner."
<p>In <date value="1495-11-16">1495, "on the 16th day of November</date>, was kept a serjeants' feast at the Bishop of Ely's palace at Holborn; at which
feast were present the King (Henry VII.) and Queen and all
the nobility of the realm that were then attendant at court."
Some account of how our forefathers "did" for themselves
at these feasts may be interesting. One of these, in <date value="1531">1531</date>,
given at Ely House by eleven gentlemen of the law on their
promotion to the dignity of the "coif" (serjeants-at-law), lasted
for five days, and among the guests were the King (Henry VIII.),
Queen, foreign Ministers, Lord Mayor, Judges, Master of the
Rolls, Masters in Chancery, Aldermen, Serjeants-at-Law, great
merchants, and livery men. The food provided was-

Tradition says that John o' Gaunt died at Ely Place; in
reality, he died at Leicester, but his body rested here on the
way to be honourably buried in St. Paul's.
<p>The house was either leased, or lent, for various purposes
for a long time. It was at a masked ball, given by the students
of the Inns of Court here, in honour of Queen Elizabeth, that
that lady among the maskers distinguished one " who in stature,
agility, and manner excelled all his companions." This fortunate
dancer was Christopher Hatton, a young man of slender fortune,
from Northamptonshire. His good looks so impressed her that
she bade him reside at Court, appointed him captain of the
guard, then Chamberlain, and finally Lord Chancellor. The
lawyers were mortified, and objected to plead before him;
but Hatton had a fair allowance of common sense, and,
providing himself with two serjeants, whom he consulted on
points of law, he subdued their opposition, and proved himself,
as a judge in equity, not inferior to his predecessors. He
was one of the most accomplished gentlemen at Court, and
made many friends by his opposition to harsh and irritating
measures, which were often suggested by his colleagues in
the Council.
<p>He assumed his great post in troublous times. The King
of Spain was beginning to get restive under the long series of
injuries done to his subjects. Elizabeth had captured his
treasure, given aid to his rebels, hired mercenaries to fight
his armies, and her mariners had plundered and slain his
people on the high seas and in America; but Hatton guided
things well. When he assumed the Chancellorship, a house
suitable to the dignity was necessary, and perhaps remembering
<pb n="190" id="p.190">



the scene of his first triumph, a compulsory lease of Ely Place
was taken. It was said that "he danced the Bishop of Ely
out of his house, garden, and strawberry beds"; but the
house was not confiscated. The courtier had to pay a rent
of a red rose, ten loads of hay, and l10 per annum, to
Bishop Cox, who had to make the bargain; the Bishop
reserving to himself and his successors the right of walking
in the garden and gathering twenty bushels of roses yearly.
The terms are a curious mingling of the Arcadian and the
practical.
<p>It was then that Hatton gave his house-warming, described
in the "Ingoldsby Legends." Everybody came, through
Chancery Lane, through Shoe Lane, Fetter Lane, from Cheap-
side, St. Mary-le-Bow, Bishopsgate Street, Dowgate Hill and
Budge Row.

<lb>"Here comes bold Drake, the chief who made a
<lb>Fine hash of all the powers of Spain.

<lb>With him come Frobisher and Hawkings,
<lb>In yellow ruffs, rosettes, and stockings.
<lb>Room for my Lord-proud Leicester's Earl
<lb>Retires a while from courtly cares.

<lb>Room! room! for great Cecil! place for his Dame,
<lb>Room for Southampton-for Sidney . . .
<lb>Room for Lord Hunsdon, for Sussex-for Rawleigh!-

<lb>Here's my Lord Keeper Hatton, so stately and tall!
<lb>Has led out Lady Hunsdon to open the ball.

<lb>Never was anything half so gay
<lb>As Sir Christopher Hatton's grand holiday."
<pb n="191" id="p.191">




But the grand ball is said to have had a tragic ending:
the death of Lady Hatton.
<p>It is generally admitted that a man who was a favourite
with Elizabeth had to be on bad terms with his wife; so the
story is told that during the dancing a mysterious and wonderful
dancer appeared, who danced with Lady Alice Hatton-" A
flame-coloured Belle, and a coffee-faced Beau"-round the
hall, till finally with-
<lb>"One grand pirouette, the performance to crown!
<lb>Again they go up! and they never come down."
<p>Then came thunder, lightning, rain, and noise, and the guests
fled, "with speed quite amazing." When dawn came, there was
found a hole in the roof, and a human heart lying by the
pump in Bleeding Heart Yard. So goes the legend, perpetuated
in the name. The facts are more difficult to discover, and it is
possible that the occasion was seized by Hatton to put his
ambitious and unwanted wife out of the way.
<p>No eye will now expect to see the ghosts of the lordly
company. There is no pump at which the wraith of Lady
Hatton can draw water. Bleeding Heart Yard is full of modern
warehouses, and hums with the sound of the electric motor. It
remained pretty true to Dickens's description until some twenty
years ago; the spirit of Little Dorrit exorcised all the others,
but now even her haunts have vanished.
<p>Later, during the negotiations for a Spanish marriage for
Prince Charles, Gondomar, the ambassador from Spain, was
lodged at Ely Place, favoured by the court, and so detested by
the populace that, in <date value="1620">1620</date>, some of the citizens assaulted
the Spaniard in the street; which so enraged the King that he
<pb n="192" id="p.192">



came in person to the Guildhall, reprimanded the Mayor and
the city magistrates, and threatened the city with the military
power, ordering diligent search to be made for the offenders.
A scapegoat had to be found, so one poor citizen who had
been overheard making disparaging remarks about Gondomar
was seized, and next day whipped from Aldgate to Temple Bar.
A later ambassador in the same cause, the Marquis Ynoiosa, was
lodged there, but, owing to the opposition of Buckingham, had
great difficulty in obtaining an interview with King James.
Buckingham, in a rather bullying letter to the King, says,
"In obedience to your commands, I will tell the House of
Parliament that you have taken such a fierce rheum and cough,
as, not knowing how you will be this night, you are not able to
appoint them a hearing; but I will forbear to tell them, that,
notwithstanding of your cold, you were able to speak to the
King of Spain's instruments, though not with your own subjects." The Spaniard assumed a bolder tone, and demanded
an audience of the King; that being refused, he asked for a
ship to leave the kingdom; "So as to the great joy and exultation of all the coblers and other bigots and zealous brethren of
the town, he this day comes to Ely House and to-morrow
to Dover."
<p>During the troubles with Protector Somerset, before his
downfall, those opposing him-the Earl of Warwick and several
Lords of the Council had their headquarters at Ely Place.
Somerset ordered, in the King's name, that the adjoining counties,
hamlets, and the city of London should furnish men to guard the
King. The counterblast from Ely Place declared that Somerset
had not paid the soldiers he had, was seeking to destroy the
<pb n="193" id="p.193">



nobility, and foment trouble between the higher and lower classes
of the nation. At a later time the house was granted by James I.
to the Duke of Lennox, afterwards Duke of Richmond ; he died
there, and his body lay in state for six weeks.
<p>Ely Place perpetuates the name, but no part of the Bishop's
house is left, except a fragment of the chapel, now incorporated
in the well-known Catholic church. Many of the stones of the
house were used to pave the street when Ely Place was made.
The original house appears to have stood until well on in
the eighteenth century.
<p>On the <date value="1776-10-18">18th October 1776</date>, "the Bishop of Ely took
possession of a house in Dover Street, erected by Act of Parliament, and to be called Ely House for the future, in lieu of the
old palace on Holborn Hill."
<p>Hatton Wall and Hatton Garden still recall the courtier's
name.
<p>The school in Hatton Garden bears the date 1696, and is
probably unique as a specimen of a parish school of that period ;
the figures over each doorway, representing a boy and girl in the
costume of the day, are well modelled and in good condition,
after standing the storms and smoke of London for over two
centuries. Many of the old houses surviving are of the same
date, but modern warehouses are rapidly usurping their sites.
There was a pillory at the lower end of Hatton Garden,
where, in <date value="1756">1756</date>, was a popular demonstration differing essentially
from that in the case of Defoe. Four thieftakers were condemned
to stand twice in the pillory and be imprisoned for seven years,
find security for 1000, and pay a fine, for enticing two young
lads to commit a robbery, and then prosecuting them for the
<pb n="194" id="p.194">



sake of the reward. The first two stood in this pillory, and were
severely pelted by the people, one receiving a fearful wound on
the head from a stone, and the other scarce able to survive.
The other two stood at Smithfield three days later; one was
mortally wounded in twenty minutes, and the other miserably
bruised; two of them died on their return to Newgate. In
Brook Street, Chatterton died, and Dickens made the district
the background for "Oliver Twist"; Fagin's house was in
Leather Lane.
<p>Furnivall's Inn stood on the site now occupied by the
Prudential Insurance Company. Old prints show it as a large
building of design similar to the two houses built by Inigo
Jones in Great Queen Street (there is another house of much
the same pattern in Tooks' Court, Cursitor Street). In <date value="1819">1819</date>
Mr. Peto acquired the lease of the Inn, and at that time rebuilt
the whole of it as chambers. These stood until the present
buildings were erected.

<div1 type="entry"><head>STAPLE INN</><p>
On the other side of the street, the quaint row of gables
and timbered front of Staple Inn are probably more noticed
by strangers than any other building in London.
In No. 2, on the right as you enter the gateway from
Holborn, Dr. Johnson lived for some time, and there wrote
a "little story-book called 'Rasselas'"; while Dickens, in
"Edwin Drood," makes Mr. Grewgious a resident in the Inn.
The quiet court and little garden have been described by
Washington Irving and others.
<pb n="195" id="p.195">



The front was restored by Mr. Waterhouse some twenty
years ago. It is now owned by the Prudential Assurance
Company, and by them saved from destruction.
At one time it was the hall of the Woolstaplers, then of
great importance, wool being for centuries one of the principal
exports from England. Foreign trade then, as now, brought
with it the "Fiscal question," although it was then dealt with
in a more summary fashion.
<p>"In <date value="1563">1563</date> ye merchants of the Staple procured the Queen's
Majestie's licence to ship their wool to Bruges in Flanders; but
when the shippes were all in readiness, and the wool brought
down to the water side, and divers of the same wool shipped,
there was, by ye suit of the 'Merchant Adventurers,' a stay
made, and the cause was: Forasmuch as our clothiers and merchant adventurers were restrained from Flanders, therefore it
was not thought reasonable ye merchants of the Staple should
carry our wool thither, for so it might seem not only our
merchants to be one of them against another, but also by ye
carriage away of our wool, it is like we should set their people
on worke and suffer our owne to go a-begging, to the great
hurt and decay of the Commonweal of England."
<p>Staple Inn became an Inn of Chancery at a very early
date. It was so in the time of Henry V., and the inheritance
of it was granted by Henry VIII. to the Society of Gray's Inn.

<div1 type="entry"><head>LINCOLN'S INN GATEWAY</><p>
On the west side of Chancery Lane, and just beyond the
City bounds, is Lincoln's Inn and the gateway on which Fuller
<pb n="196" id="p.196">



describes Ben Jonson at work as a bricklayer, studying Horace in
his moments of leisure. Pennant says, " This gateway is of brick,
but of no small ornament to the street. It was built by Sir
Thomas Lovell, once a member of the Inn, and afterwards
treasurer to Henry VII.; the other parts were rebuilt at different
times, but much about the same period. None of the original
building is left, for it was formed out of the house of the Black
Friars, which fronted Holborn; this was the original site of the
house of the Dominicans before they removed to the spot now
bearing their name. On part of this ground, now covered with
buildings, Henry Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, built an inn, as it was
in those days called, for himself, in which he died in <date value="1312">1312</date>.
The ground did belong to the Black Friars, and was granted by
Edward I. to that great Earl." The gate bears the date 1518,
and the arms of Sir Thomas Lovell. The adjoining houses, with
gables, and chimneys built outside the walls, are of the same age
as the gateway. Often threatened with destruction by the march
of "improvements," it is to be hoped that they may long be spared.
Southampton Row recalls the name of a house built here, on
part of the site occupied by the Black Friars; the house was
conveyed to the Earl of Southampton in the time of Edward VI.;
this was the father of the man to whom Shakespeare dedicated
"Venus and Adonis," and who was afterwards attainted for
complicity in the Essex troubles. He must have been somewhat
inclined to conspiracy, as an earlier plot-Babington's-was concocted in this house. James I. restored their dignities, and the
liberties of Southampton House, "from Holborn Bars to the
'Rolls' in Chancery Lane." Every trace of the house has long
vanished.
<pb n="197" id="p.197">



Just behind Staple Inn lies Tooks' Court, entered from
Furnivall Street by an archway. This claims the honour of being
the place where, in "Bleak House," Dickens portrays Krook's
rag-shop, but the novel places it on the west of Chancery Lane.
Cursitor Street, and the law stationers, figure in the same novel.
In Furnivall Street-formerly Castle Street--Traddles, of
"David Copperfield," lived for a time. In earlier days, <dateRange from="1619" to="1620">1619-20</dateRange>,
Lord Arundel lived here; Lady Davenant and the wife of Secretary Thurloe died here; and Paul Whitehead, the poet, was born
here in <date value="1710">1710</date>.
<p>Dickens lived for some time in Furnivall's Inn, with the
background of many of his figures around him. The " Black
Bull," associated with Sairey Gamp, was almost next door; it is
only recently that this house, with its finely modelled sign,
vanished like so many more.
<p>Many of the courts here, as elsewhere in London, have
curious names, doubtless all having a meaning could we discover
it. Perhaps from Quality Court Mr. Barrie adopted the title
for one of his plays. Fleur-de-lys Court and Falcon Court
took their names from traders' signs, but the origin of many of
the names has passed beyond us. It is rendered more difficult
by the exuberant fancy displayed by old chroniclers, who were
somewhat given to the habit of providing an explanation-to use
no harsher term-when they thought it necessary. Thus with
reference to the names of many streets in the City they provide
a cut-and-dried explanation. Bread Street was the street of the
bakers; Milk Street of the milksellers; Friday Street, where
fish might be bought for the weekly fast, and so on. Now it is
no doubt true that in ancient times there was a tendency among
<pb n="198" id="p.198">




certain trades to live in proximity; it was natural, for convenience and for mutual defence, combined, probably, with
favourable local conditions, but to contend that these streets
were entirely monopolised by certain crafts, as they are in
Oriental cities, is an absurdity, and disproved by their own
writings, where you find, time and again, names of citizens,
with entirely different crafts, living and working in these streets.
They were just as fanciful as Ben Jonson's masque of <date value="1616">1616</date>,
where Robin Cupid, a 'prentice in Love Lane with a buglemaker, "makes your bobs and bird bolts for ladies." In many
cases antiquarian research would seem to have delved too deep,
ignoring any theory that lay near the surface.



<div1 type="entry"><head>FETTER LANE</><p>

Fetter Lane has suffered much from elucidation, yet none
of the definitions are convincing. Perhaps, after all, the name
had to do with the forging of fetters, which must have been
a considerable industry, with several prisons near by. Executions occasionally took place at both ends of the lane. In
<date value="1663">1663</date> Nat Tompkins was hanged at the Holborn end for
taking part in Waller the poet's scheme to seize London for
the King.
<p>There is now but one ancient house in Fetter Lane,
and a drawing of it has been inserted. This house is now
empty, and probably will be destroyed. Formerly this was
the White Horse Inn, and it is absolutely the last entire front
of an ancient inn surviving in London. It has been occupied
<pb n="199" id="p.199">



by various shops for many years, and the yard, for the accommodation of waggons and coaches, has been absorbed by the
Mercers' School, along with what was left of Barnard's Inn.
Readers of Dickens will remember how large a part that
plays in "Great Expectations," where it is described in not
very sympathetic terms, and not by any means as one of the
places in which the novelist revelled. All the broken-down
and mouldy houses have disappeared, and, except the little Hall,
there is nothing of "respectable antiquity" in the courtyard.
When Titus Oates was at the height of his power, had accused
the Queen of treason, and had five Catholic lords shut up in
the Tower on the same charge, one of his charges of traitorous
consultation was declared to have taken place at the White
Horse Tavern on <date value="1678-04-25">April 25, 1678</date>; but when confirmation was
sought, the landlord was dead, and neither his widow nor
former servants could be found, so that part of the charge
could not be proceeded with. There is little history otherwise
attaching to the building.
<p>The old house and the Wesleyan chapel shown in the
next drawing have now disappeared. The chapel was one of
the earliest founded by Wesley (he and Whitfield both preached
there). It is said to have been built when the proposed alliance
with Count Zinzendorf and the Moravian Brethren fell through.
Standing as it did just across the way from the Moravian chapel,
the position did savour somewhat of opposition.
The street has had some distinguished residents. "Praise
God Barebones," whose name was attached to one of Cromwell's
Parliaments-the first of these, when Cromwell told them that
God was about to bring His people out of the depths of the
<pb n="200" id="p.200">
















sea, perhaps to bring the Jews home to their Station, out of
the isles of the sea. . . . And God will dwell on this hill for
ever."
<p>On the second day thirteen of the most gifted members
prayed and preached from eight in the morning till six in the
evening, but when they finally came to business they displayed
both promptitude and resolution. "These members have been
described as men in trade and of no education, because one of
them, Praise God Barebones, was a leather dealer; it is, however,
observed by one of them that, if all had not very bulky estates,
yet they were free estates, and were not of broken fortunes, or
such as owed great sums of money, and stood in need of privilege
and protection as formerly." The late revolutions had taught
them to think for themselves, and their fanaticism, converting
their opinions into matters of conscience, had superadded an
obstinacy of character not easily subdued; so this member, if a
leather seller, was a man of substance, despite his name ; he lived
in the same house, valued at l40 per annum, for twenty-five
years. It is denied that either Dryden or Otway were residents,
but Archer, in his "Vestiges of London," shows Dryden's house,
a building over the entrance to Fleur-de-Lys Court, and gives
credit to the story, although familiar with all the objections. That
court had another less reputable tenant, Elizabeth Brownrigg,
executed at Tyburn for the murder, under shocking circumstances, of her apprentice, Mary Clifford.
<p>Hobbes, the philosopher, lived in this street, and was
perhaps the most distinguished resident it ever had. A friend
of Bacon, Herbert of Cherbury, Ben Jonson, and Galileo, his
philosophy seems to be mostly engaged in finding a reasonable
<pb n="201" id="p.201">



foundation for despotic monarchy, and striving to curb any spirit
of freedom. In his " Leviathan," man is represented as a selfish,
ferocious animal, requiring the strong hand of despotism to keep
him in check. He made his philosophic foundation too strong
even for the King of France.
<p>Returning to England from Paris, he ultimately received a
pension of l100 from Charles II., that tolerant monarch remarking that "Hobbes was a bear, against whom the Church played
their young dogs, in order to exercise them."
A so-called Papist plot occurred here in 1679, when a
servant girl set fire to her master's house in Fetter Lane. She
said one Stubbs instigated her to do so. Whether this was true
or not, five Jesuits were hanged for it, and all Papists banished
ten miles from London.
<p>Tom Paine lived for some time at No. 77.

<div1 type="entry"><head>NEVILLE'S COURT</><p>

Neville's Court, on the east side of Fetter Lane, contains
some ancient houses and the Moravian Chapel. Two of these
houses on the north side are of Tudor times; local legend
says they are part of a monastery belonging to Rolfe, Bishop of
Chichester. They are timber houses, but have no monastic
character about them. They now belong to the Goldsmiths'
Company, and part of one is occupied by a prominent Labour
member of Parliament.
<p>Some of the houses retain little patches of garden ; in their
fore courts flowers and shrubs seem to thrive wonderfully, despite
<pb n="202" id="p.202">



their cramped surroundings. Many of the residents are old settlers
indeed, some of their forefathers residing there in James I.'s time.
The houses on the south side are nearly all in occupation by the
Moravian Brethren, who, to a certain extent, dwell in communities. One of these houses is of Jacobean architecture, and
was probably built and occupied by Sir Henry Neville, who, in
Elizabeth's time, narrowly escaped being concerned in the Essex
troubles. He was ambassador to the court of France, and, before
his departure there, had been invited to Drury House, the focus
of the conspirators. He himself said he only heard some disloyal conversation, which he condemned, and then departed, but
a confession attributed to Essex involved him deeper, and he was
confined in the Tower till the Queen's death.
In James I.'s time he was somewhat of a pushing politician,
who aspired to be Secretary of State, and undertook to teach that
monarch how to manage Parliament. The house came into the
possession of the Moravian Society in I744, described then as
"the great house in Neville's Alley." The earliest account of
the Moravian Missions was issued from it. It was the home of
the Rev. C. T. la Trobe and Count Reuss, and ought to be
interesting to Australians from the fact that the first governor of
Victoria-C. J. la Trobe-was born in it. It is occupied now
by some of the members of the Society, and partly as a guesthouse for the accommodation of missionaries going to or returning from distant places.
<p>The chapel is reached by a doorway and passage from the
court, and externally it is a very plain building. It was dismantled by the mob during the Sacheverell riots-Thomas Bradbury, the preacher, escaping with difficulty. These riots were
<pb n="203" id="p.203">



to some extent condoned by the authorities. Dr. Sacheverell,
being chaplain of St. Saviour's, Southwark, received shortly afterwards the rectorship of St. Andrew's, Holborn. He seems at
least to have been a man of courage. On one occasion, when
Whiston, the translator of Josephus, and a man of turbulent
temper, interrupted his preaching, he descended from the pulpit,
turned Whiston out of the building by force, and returned
calmly to finish the service.
<p>As the founder of the Moravian Brethren, Count Zinzendorf, and his work are not generally well known, some
notes on that extraordinary man may be interesting. He came
to England about 1737, and was received with much consideration by Wesley, who at one time thought of joining the
Herrnhut body, but probably found that there was not
room for both. Zinzendorf was born at Dresden in 1700, his
father being a Saxon State minister. At Halle, where he went
in 1710, he founded among his fellow-pupils the "Order of the
Grain of Mustard Seed." Six years later he was sent to Wittenberg, and two years afterwards travelled through France and
Holland, everywhere trying to convert illustrious personages to
his religious views. Appointed a member of the Saxon State
Council, a political life had no attractions for him, and he
retired to his country home at Lusatia. There he met a
wandering carpenter, Christian David, a member of the remnant
of the Hussites, or followers of Johan Huss, who had adopted
the tenets of Wycliffe, and whose action in denouncing the
corruption of the clergy brought him trouble from Pope John.
Huss was burnt at the stake and his ashes thrown into the Rhine,
yet his teaching was not forgotten, and a leader arose in that
<pb n="204" id="p.204">



mighty warrior, John Ziska, once a page to King Wenceslaus,
King of Bohemia (the same good King of the old Christmas
carol). Wherever there was fighting, John Ziska was there;
a volunteer in the English army in France, a volunteer under
Ladislaus of Poland at Tannnenburg, where 40,000 knights
were slain and he lost his right eye. As chamberlain to
Wenceslaus he struggled against the Pope, and at Prague, in
1419, caused thirteen Catholic magistrates to be thrown out
of the window of the council-room. For long he was blind,
but still kept fighting, and, it is said, left orders for his
skin to be made into a drum, to lead the Hussites on; but
after his death from plague the community became obscure
until this meeting with Zinzendorf, who induced the carpenter
and his friends to settle on his land, finally devoting his estates
to them and becoming their leader.
He was banished from Saxony, "for introducing novelties
in religion," and went to Holland, where he founded a colony;
afterwards to Esthonia and Livonia, where also colonies were
founded. In 1737 he was ordained Bishop of the Moravians
at the request of Frederick William I. of Prussia. He then
came to England. After founding this colony in Fetter Lane, he
remained for some years; in 1741 he went to North America
and founded the colony of Bethlehem. Allowed to return to
Herrnhut in 1747, he did so, and died there in <date value="1760">1760</date>. The
Moravians prefer to live in communities where possible, for the
purpose of carrying out some of the more peculiar features of
their organisation, such as the division into choirs: but these
and their ritual are alike outside the view of this work.

<div1 type="entry"><head>DR. JOHNSON'S HOUSE, GOUGH SQUARE</><p>
Between the eastern end of Neville's Court and Fleet Street
lies a congeries of courts and narrow streets, where the printing-press is never silent, and the dissemination of printed matter
flows on from year's end to year's end. This is the land sacred
to the memory of Dr. Johnson.
Of the three houses, close beside each other, where he
spent the greater part of his London life, only one now remains,
and that will probably not be for long.
In Gough Square, No. 17, he lived from <dateRange from="1748" to="1758">1748 to 1758</dateRange>;
here his wife died; here he compiled the greater part of his
Dictionary, and began the Rambler and the Idler.
After his wife's death, he was never happy in the house,
nor would he enter the room where she died. So for a brief
space he moved to Staple Inn. Returning to Johnson's Court,
which is a turning out of Gough Square, at No. 7 he lived
from <dateRange from="1765" to="1776">1765 to 1776</dateRange>. There is a tablet inserted in the wall of the
present house. During this time he published his "Journey to
the Hebrides" and his edition of Shakespeare; here Boswell,
on Easter Day <date value="1773">1773</date>, dined, for the first time, at Johnson's table:
"Very good soup, a boiled leg of lamb, and spinach, a veal pie,
and a rice pudding." It was in the year he moved here that he
made the acquaintance of the Thrales.

<div1 type="entry"><head>BOLT COURT</><p>
Finally moving to Bolt Court, quite close by, he spent
the last ten years of his life, and died there. His house, No. 8,
<pb n="206" id="p.206">




was burned down in <date value="1819">1819</date>. Writing to Mrs. Thrale in August
<date value="1780">1780</date>, he says, "This is all I have to tell you, except that I
have three bunches of grapes on a vine in my garden" (the
garden was behind the house). An old print of the house shows
also a balcony with flowers. The house was on the west side
of the court. Bolt Court is most often associated with his
name, and it is difficult for us to realise the unique position
occupied by him for so many years. Pennant, in his "Account
of London," says: I must by no means omit Bolt Court, the
long residence of Dr. Samuel Johnson, a man of the strongest
natural abilities, great learning, and most retentive memory, of
the deepest and most unaffected piety and morality, mingled with
those numerous weaknesses and prejudices which his 'friends'
have kindly taken care to draw from their dread abode." That
he was eccentric is evident; but probably it was from his kindness of heart and illimitable charity in thinking of others that
much of the admiration arose which still keeps his memory
green.
Few men could have undergone the vivisection he endured from Boswell and retained not only the respect, but
the affection, of his contemporaries, and also of the generations
after him. His sayings are quoted endlessly, but this seems
as characteristic as many of them. Talking of an eccentric
genius-Christopher Smart-who, in <date value="1763">1763</date>, was put in a madhouse, Johnson said, "He has partly as much exercise as he
used to have, for he digs in the garden; indeed, before his
confinement he used to walk to the alehouse, but he was
carried back again. He insisted on people praying with him,
and I'd as lief pray with Kit Smart as any one else. Another
207



charge was that he did not love clean linen, and I've no passion
for it." Hannah More relates her first visit to him: "Miss
Reynolds told the Doctor of our rapturous exclamations on
the road. He shook his scientific head at Hannah, and said
she was a silly thing; and when our visit was ended, he called
for his hat, as it rained, to attend us down a very long entry
to our coach; and not Rasselas himself could have acquitted
himself more cavalier."
Bolt Court has other claims besides Johnson. The Annual
Register of <date value="1776-11-16">16th November 1776</date> says : "There died Mr. James
Ferguson, lecturer in natural philosophy and astronomy, an
excellent mechanic and no bad miniature painter, at his house
in Bolt Court." Another resident was that strenuous patriot,
William Cobbett, whose publishing office was part of Johnson's
house. It is curious that he should occupy the house of the
man whom he hated so much. The reason for that hatred
is obscure, unless, indeed, it arose from the fact that Johnson
was always a Tory, while Cobbett, after a long career of
Toryism, became a Radical of the most violent type. From
the violence of the language and habitual overstatement of his
case, much of his writing has ceased to be of any interest
nowadays. He strove for liberty and right, undoubtedly, and
succeeded so far, but probably his success would have been
greater had his vituperation been less constant, and his iteration
less "damnable."
At any rate, here he sold his books and sent forth much
good advice, under the title of "Twopenny Trash," and parcels
of maize to whoever would plant it, to carry on his war against
hunger, injustice, and that "accursed root," the potato. Some
208



of his ideas were quite as odd as any of Dr. Johnson's; he
remarked, "that anybody could be made a baronet since Walter
Scott had been made one," and, "it has been the fashion of late
years to extol the virtues of potatoes. So it has been to admire
Milton and Shakespeare. I wonder how 'Paradise Lost' could
be tolerated by a people among whom astronomy, chemistry,
and navigation are understood."
An earlier Dr. Samuel Johnson was somewhat famous. In
1686 a pamphlet was circulated in the camp at Hounslow protesting against the celebration of Mass there; this was traced to
Johnson, who had been chaplain to Lord William Russell (he
had been convicted in the previous reign for a pamphlet on the
Duke of York), and he was now found guilty, adjudged to
stand thrice in the pillory, to be whipped from Tyburn to Newgate, fined 500 marks, and, to save the honour of the clergy,
solemnly degraded from the order of priesthood in the chapterhouse of St. Paul's, before punishment was inflicted.
Among the surrounding maze of courts there are a few
old houses, and fragments of history. In Crane Court the building used by the Scots Corporation as a chapel, was the room
employed by the Royal Society for its larger meetings after they
removed here from the heart of the city. It was to a meeting
here that Sir Isaac Newton travelled from Bullingham House,
Kensington, and died of fatigue on his return. Boyle, one of the
founders of the Society, was the inventor of the air-pump,
the beginning of modern pneumatic discoveries. A curious
compound of science and theology, when he died, he left provision for the delivery in London of eight sermons yearly, "for
proving the Christian Religion against notorious infidels, viz.
209



atheists, theists, pagans, Jews, and Mohammedans, not descending lower, to any controversies that are among Christians themselves." These lectures are still delivered at Bow Church.
The Scots Corporation, which now occupies this place, was
founded by James Kinnear, a merchant in the city, who, after a
long and dangerous sickness, gave part of his estate towards the
relief of the aged and necessitous poor of his country in London
and Westminster. He applied for a charter, and at the same
time communicated his intentions to some of his countrymen, who
had managed a box club (contribution-box) since the time of
James I. for the relief of journeyman tailors ; they joined in the
work, and the Earl of Lauderdale obtained for them Letters Patent
on <date value="1666-11-16">Nov. 16, 1666</date>, wherein their privileges are recited. They
decided to erect a hospital, but the Great Fire, following the
plague, caused the matter to be deferred until <date value="1670">1670</date>, when they
leased a piece of ground in Black Friars for a thousand years, at
a ground rent of l40. Money was freely subscribed, by noble
and commoner alike, and, in <date value="1672">1672</date>, they erected their hall, with
two houses at Fleet Ditch and four houses in Blackfriars, having
raised and paid 4450. About the middle of the eighteenth
century their annual disbursements amounted to about 600.
There used to be a fine pair of iron gates, decorated with
thistles and the Scottish arms, opening into the hall from
near Fleur-de-Lys Court, but these have vanished at some recent
time, and have been replaced by others of modern work.
Goldsmith lived for some time at 6 Wine Office Court;
from there Johnson took the manuscript of the "Vicar of
Wakefield" and sold it to Newberry for 60. The house was
pulled down some years ago.

In St. Andrew's, Holborn, Colonel Hutchinson, afterwards
Governor of Nottingham Castle, and one of the judges of
Charles I., was married to Lucy Apsley in 1638. Her Memoirs,
first published in 1856, are a most vivid record of the period.
In the same church Chatterton was buried. Savage, the poet, was
baptized here; and Hazlitt was married to Sarah Stoddart,
Charles Lamb acting as best man, and Mary Lamb as brides-
maid; Charles bringing disgrace on the company by giggling.
On <date value="1817-07-03">July 3 , 1817</date>, in this church was baptized Benjamin, said
to be about twelve years old, son of Isaac and Maria D'Israeli
of King's Road, gentleman. Here is buried Wriothesley, the
Chancellor who succeeded Audeley, and gained an unenviable
notoriety at the execution of Anne Askew or Kyme, who had
introduced to the attendants at court some of the books
dealing with the new doctrines.
In <date value="1546">1546</date>, "both Kyme and his wife were called before the
Lords; the former was sent home, to remain there till he was
sent for; and the latter, who refused him to be her husband,
without any honest allegation, for that she was very obstinate,
and heady in reasoning of matters of religion, wherein she
shewed herself to be of a naughty opinion, was sent to Newgate,
to remain there to answer to the law." She was tortured on the
rack until she lost the use of her limbs, and after recanting
twice was burned in <date value="1546">1546</date>, at Smithfield.
Lovelace, the poet, died in penury in Gunpowder Alley,
near by the church. The place has long vanished. When
presented at the court of Charles I. at Oxford, he is described
as the most beautiful and agreeable youth that ever eye beheld;
there, and still more in London, he was much adored by women.
211



For his devotion to the King he was imprisoned by the Long
Parliament; when released, he took service with the French
army ; from there he wrote his best-known poem, to "Lucasta"
-Lucy Sacheverell-
<lb>"From the nunnery
<lb>Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind,
<lb>To war and arms I fly."
He was wounded at the battle of Dunkirk; and when he
returned, the faithless Lucy had married another suitor. He
never throve afterwards; everything went wrong. He was
ruined, imprisoned, and, if he did not actually die of starvation,
"he became poor in body and in purse, went in ragged clothes,
and lodged in obscure and dirty places, dying in <date value="1658">1658</date>."
The Bishop of Bangor had a house near here, but many
alterations have long covered all trace of it. In <date value="1828">1828</date> Brayley
says: "The garden, some lime trees, and a rookery remained
seventy years ago, but every vestige was destroyed in the autumn
of that year." By Ludgate Circus there stand two obelisks ; one
of these is in memory of John Wilkes, and the other of his
friend and fellow-alderman, Waithman.

<div2 type="entry"><head>ST. BRIDE'S</><p>
Of Bridewell, either as a palace or a prison, nothing
remains but the name, and that is of some antiquity. Bridewell
Palace was built out of the remains of an "antient" palace
which stood near the river Fleet. This original house must have
been of great size, since, in <date value="1087">1087</date>, William the Conqueror gave
many of the choicest materials towards the rebuilding of St.
Paul's, which had been destroyed by fire.
212



Henry I. gave as many of the stones from the castle yard
as served to enclose and form the gates and precincts of that
church; notwithstanding this, a dwelling remained, to which
King John convened all the abbots and other heads of religious
houses, English and foreign, and, having them there, squeezed
from them the goodly sum of l100,000-an enormous sum in
those days. The Cistercians, who had made trouble about his
supremacy, had to pay l33,000-a penalty which ought to have
removed any doubts from their minds.
But such goings-on had to be paid for; and the Pope
sent an envoy to inform King John that in three days he would
be "unkinged," and after a brief discussion John signed a
charter at Dover, testifying that he, King of England and Lord
of Ireland, surrendered to "our Lord the Pope, and his suc-
cessors for ever, the kingdoms aforesaid," which thenceforth
were to be held as fiefs of the Holy See, and to pay tribute,
700 marks of silver for England, and 300 for Ireland. The
three days went by, and he was still King, so he hanged the
messenger; but the Pope claimed the country.
Henry VIII. rebuilt the palace in a magnificent manner
for the reception of the Emperor Charles V., who visited
England in <date value="1522">1522</date>. But the Emperor either had a dislike to
new houses, or thought it would be damp, so lodged himself
in Blackfriars, and sent his suite to occupy the new house.
It was to Bridewell Palace that Henry summoned the
Council, the Lord Mayor, and aldermen to tell them "that
he had long been tormented by scruples with regard to his
marriage with Katherine of Arragon," and it was here that
Katherine received Wolsey and Campeggio with the message
213



of her fate, "having a skein of red silk about her neck, being
at work with her maidens."
<p>Campeggio waited on her, at first in private, and then in
company with Wolsey and four other prelates. He exhorted
her, in the name of the Pope, to enter a convent. Katherine
replied "that it was not for herself she was concerned, but
for one whose interests were more dear to her than her own-
her daughter Mary; that she was a weak, illiterate woman,
a stranger without friends; and demanded the right of the
aid of counsel, selected from the subjects of her nephew. A
few days later Henry summoned the Council, the Lords, Mayor,
aldermen, and principal citizens, to hear his views on the
subject.
<p>The palace was turned into a school, and afterwards into
a reformatory, by King Edward VI. Poverty and discontent
prevailed in the realm. The extension of enclosures of common
land, and rack rents, drove multitudes to the populous towns
in search of that relief formerly distributed by the monasteries.
This reformatory was part of the scheme to improve matters.
That it was necessary is evident from the words of Lever: "Oh
merciful God, what a number of poor, feeble, halt, lame, blind,
sickly, yea, with idle vagabonds and dissembling caitiffs mixed
among them, lie and creep, begging in the miry streets of
London and Westminster !"
<p>It was at this time that Edward VI. passed his statute that
"whosoever lived idly and loiteringly for the space of three
days" came under the description of a vagabond, and was liable
to the following punishment: "Two Justices of Peace might
order the letter V to be burnt on his breast, and adjudge him
<pb n="214" id="p.214">



to serve the informer two years as his slave. His master was
bound to provide him with bread, water, and refuse meat,
might fix an iron ring round his neck, arm, or leg, and compel
him to labour at any work, however vile, by beating, chaining,
or otherwise. If the slave absented himself for a fortnight, the
letter S was to be burnt on his cheek or forehead, and he
became a slave for life. If he offended a second time, it was
felony." After two years this statute was repealed, and that of
Henry VIII. revived, which allowed persons to beg with the
license of the magistrates, and punished unlicensed beggars by
whipping, or the stocks for three days and three nights.
The tramp or derelict man is one of the curious features of
the London streets to this day. Besides the multitude of those
attracted from all parts of the country-the foreign beggars of
the old enactments-each district of the town has its own quota
of what might be called specialised tramps. Round Billingsgate
these will discuss fish, and display a knowledge of the North
Sea and all the fishing grounds that pay tribute to that market.
At Smithfield they are wise in joints and chilled meat. About
Covent Garden they will discuss blooms and market gardeners,
for they are all men of leisure, and take an interest in their
surroundings. In Fleet Street and the courts adjoining, the
tattered humanity assumes a literary air, and gossips of the
-latest political question, or the ideals of a socialist state. One
grey old man delighted in discussing poetry in general, and his
own sonnets in particular-verses full of Arcady and dewy fields,
that he, poor soul, would certainly never see again. Some-
what pathetic for the listener; but the strangest feature
is their amazing cheerfulness, a cheerfulness far surpassing
<pb n="215" id="p.215">



that of the ordinary man with his work to do and his
bread to win.
After a time as a reformatory, Bridewell became a prison-
one of the most horrible in London-and the name passed into
speech as a slang term for prisons of all sorts. Part of the space,
in the time of James I., was used for the erection of twelve new
public granaries, to hold 6000 quarters of corn, for fear of
dearth. There were others in the City and in Southwark. It
has often been proposed, in recent years, to resort to this form
of storage again.
<p>St. Bride's Church is the parish church of the largest
community of printers ever gathered together in the world, and
has been so for a long time. Although so near the roar of the
traffic in Fleet Street, it is singularly retired.
From the time of the Great Fire, the only entrance was a
narrow passage from Salisbury Square, and recently a wider
passage from Fleet Street. From earliest times a church has
stood here, always dedicated to St. Bride or Bridget. The
original building was small, but by the piety of William Viner,
warden of the Fleet, about <date value="1480">1480</date>, it was much enlarged and
ornamented with grapes and vine leaves, in allusion to his
name. Of that church, all that remains are the font, the registers,
and the communion plate. John Cardmaker, the vicar in <date value="1554">1554</date>,
was burnt at Smithfield. Rebuilt by Wren after the fire, the
church and churchyard contain the graves of Wynkin de
Worde, printer and disciple of Caxton; Sackville, the poet,
<date value="1608">1608</date>; Lovelace, <date value="1645">1645</date>; Sir Richard Baker, author of the
"Chronicle of the Kings of England," beloved by Sir Roger
de Coverley. Of this Chronicle, published in <date value="1641">1641</date>, the
<pb n="216" id="p.216">



author complacently declares "that if all other chronicles
were lost, this only would be sufficient to inform posterity."
Henry Wotton says, "It is full of sweet raptures and of researching conceits." Thomas Blount proved it full of gross errors. Of
chroniclers in general, each seemed to have a quarrel with his
neighbour or predecessor. Grafton quarrels with Stow. Gifford
says Aubrey was a credulous fool, and so on. Each was
truthful enough about matters observed by themselves; their
interpretations varied, and they all suffered from the habit of
embroidering.
<p>Like many other literary men of the period, Baker died
in prison.
<p>The entrance to a vault in the churchyard bears the arms
of Holden, friend of Pepys, and the date <date value="1657">1657</date>, and beneath the
centre aisle, is inscribed on the stone, "Here lieth the body of
Mr. Samuel Richardson of this parish;" his wife, two sons, and
a grandson lie beside him. A brass plate on the wall was put
up at the bicentenary of his death by a fellow-tradesman, Samuel
Butterworth, of Fleet Street, bookseller. Another personality
buried here is Robert Waithman, who lived over his linen-draper's
shop in Fleet Street near where the obelisk to his memory stands.
An alderman in 1818, he wrote several pamphlets, and his
memorial tablet states, "He was a friend of liberty in evil
times, and of parliamentary reform in its adverse days." He it
was who conducted the funeral procession of Queen Caroline
across London to Harwich, for burial in Germany, and, by his
coolness and courage, prevented what might have been a riot,
and possibly a massacre. William Bingley, author of " Wilkes
and Liberty," a friend and supporter, is buried on the south side
<pb n="217" id="p.217">



of the church. Others buried here are Ogilby, the translator of
Homer; the Countess of Orrery; Elizabeth Thomas, one of
Pope's beauties; and among the monuments is one to Carey
Stafford, founder of Whitefriars glassworks, and one to "Molins,
Master of Chyrurgery and Doctor of Physick, servant to His
Majesty King James I." The latter would have no sinecure in his
lifetime, if various descriptions of that monarch are true. "More
corpulent through his clothes than in his body, yet fat enough.
His clothes ever being large and easy, and doublets quilted for
stiletto-proof, his breeches in great pleats and full stuffed. His
beard was 'werey' thin, his tongue too large for his mouth, which
ever made him speak full, and made him drink 'werey uncomlie,'
as if eating his drink, which came out of the cup in each syde of
his mouth. His skin was as soft as taffete sarsnet, because he
never washed his hands, only rubbed his fingers with the wet
end of a napkin ; his legs were very weak; that weakness made
him ever leaning on other men's shoulders."
<p>The registers record the marriage of Francis Drake, and tell
something of the great plague, which, beginning in Long Acre,
spread to Westminster and eastward toward the city. The
measures taken to check its ravages seem to have been as futile
as those ridiculed by Grafton at an earlier time. The court,
the nobility, and gentry fled ; forty thousand servants were without homes; the Mayor refused certificates, and other towns
refused to admit the fugitives. Charity was not forgotten; the
King gave l1000, the city l600 per week; Lord Craven, the
Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Queen-Dowager distinguished themselves by active help, and for a time the magistrates
ensured a constant supply of provisions in the markets. At first
<pb n="218" id="p.218">



the poorer classes were chiefly affected, and of these more
women and children than men; but the end of June saw the
pestilence so destructive, that the authorities divided the parishes
into districts, with examiners, searchers, nurses, and watchmen.
On the door of every house affected a red cross one foot in length
was painted, with the words "Lord have mercy on us," and
from that moment the house was closed, all egress was refused
for one month, and the inmates doomed to remain inside the
dwelling; but in vain. Many escaped, and carried the contagion
further. In the daytime, officers were always on the watch to
remove the bodies of those who died in the streets. During the
night a cart with a bell, the men carrying torches, removed the
victims of the previous twenty-four hours; no mourners were
allowed to follow, no coffins were used, no service read ; the carts
proceeded to the nearest plague-pit, and the contents were shot in.
As the summer advanced, credulous people, with minds unhinged,
saw the ghosts of the dead walk round the pits saw in the
heavens a flaming sword which stretched from Westminster to
the Tower. Fanatical prophets appeared ; one naked, with a pan
of burning coals on his head, perambulated the city, denouncing
judgment on its sinful inhabitants; another prophesied the
destruction of the city in forty days; another day and night
roamed the forsaken streets, crying in a sepulchral voice, "Oh
the great and dreadful God."
<p>Rows of houses stood tenantless and open to the winds;
others with the red cross on every door. The streets were
grass-grown, and those who walked took opposite sides on
meeting any person. In September an experiment was tried.
Fires of sea coal, one to every twelve houses, were lit in every
<pb n="219" id="p.219">



street, court, and alley. They were kept burning three days
and nights, but were extinguished by rain. The next week
showed a decrease, but the week following, an increase; but
the high winds of autumn made some abatement, and the plague
slowly smouldered out. Long before that, men became callous
and familiarised to it, and went about their daily business. The
poor, who had lived in the fields by Hampstead and all round
London, returned. The court came back to Whitehall, the gentry
to their houses; and, though over a hundred thousand persons
had perished, the terrors were forgotten, and the streets were
thronged with multitudes in pursuit of profit, pleasure, or
crime.
<p>The King and court resumed their follies, and the citizens
their business, until the Great Fire came and swept many foul
things away, and in many ways did good service to the city.
Thomas Fuller was specially commissioned by Cromwell
to preach, and became lecturer at St. Bride's. His "Worthies
of England" contains much gossip and a vast amount of information on many subjects. Alluding to the persecutions for
religious differences, he asks, "Is there no other way to bring
home a wandering sheep but by worrying him to death ?"
while of recreation he says, "Spill not the morning, the quintessence of the day, in recreation; for sleep itself is recreation.
<p>Add not, therefore, sauce to sauce. He cannot properly have
any title to be refreshed who was not first faint. Pastime, like
wine, is poison in the morning." Although Fuller received
special favour from Cromwell, he had been of the King's party,
and during the civil war was chaplain to the King.
We cannot identify the house where Milton lodged in
<pb n="220" id="p.220">



St. Bride's Churchyard, although it is possible that it stood
until this year, when all the old houses on the south of
the church have been pulled down. It is not of great consequence, as his stay was but brief. When he returned in <date value="1639">1639</date>
from Italy, he went to lodge with one Russell, a tailor, and
his stay could not have lasted a year. In <date value="1640">1640</date> he had removed
to Maidenhead Court, Aldersgate. It is possible that his reason
for coming here was to be near his elder brother, whose rooms
in-the Temple he had visited at various times while living at
Horton.
<p>St. Bride's Well was a holy spring with miraculous qualities
at an early date. It has now been boarded up. A pump had
been introduced in modern times, but that also is now covered,
leaving a few inches of the spout visible, as shown in the
drawing. In Milton's day, and long before and after, it was
the well from which the inhabitants near by drew their supplies.
Its situation, at a corner of the churchyard wall, is revolting
to modern ideas, but it used to be quite common. Very often
the well or spring having a miraculous character was the reason
for a church being built near by it, and our forefathers saw
nothing wrong in the burying-ground approaching the spring.
The neighbouring precinct of Whitefriars was a sanctuary
until <date value="1697">1697</date>, when it was abolished. Originally the sanctuary was
for everything but treason, but, after the fifteenth century, for
debtors only. At the same time there were sanctuaries in Mitre
Court, Ram Alley, Salisbury Court, the Savoy, Fulwood's Rents
in Holborn, Baldwin's Gardens, Gray's Inn Lane, the Minories,
Deadman's Place, Montague Close, and the "Clink" and
Mint at Southwark. None of these are far apart, and before
<pb n="221" id="p.221">



their abolition the arrest of debtors must have had a strong
sporting flavour about it. The violation of sanctuary by bailiffs
was a grievous wrong, besides the added penalties of "Lynch
law" by the populace.
<p>A little to the east of King's Bench Walk stood the church
and convent of the Carmelites, or White Friars, founded in
1241 by Sir Richard Grey, ancestor of the Greys of Codnor.
Edward I. bestowed on them more ground, that they might
enlarge their buildings.
<p>Another church was built by Sir Richard Knolles, a soldier
of the time of Edward III. and Richard II. ; he was interred there
in <date value="1407">1407</date>. There also were buried John Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham, in <date value="1382">1382</date>, in his youth; Elizabeth, wife of Henry, Earl
of Kent, whose only record is "that she wasted his substance by
gaming"; John, Lord Grey of Wilton, in <date value="1418">1418</date>, and numbers
of the common gentry.
<p>At the dissolution its revenues were 63, 2s. 4d. Part of
the house was granted by Henry to Robert Moresque, and the
chapter-house, with other parts, to his physician, William Butts,
immortalised by Shakespeare. Edward VI. bestowed the house
inhabited by Dr. Butts, with the church, on the Bishop of
Worcester and his successors. It was afterwards demolished,
with all its tombs, and several houses inhabited in the reign of
Edward VI. by people of fashion. It became known as Alsatia,
a word of debatable origin, but meaning, broadly, a lawless
district, and the sanctuary doubtless encouraged its use by all
manner of rowdies and thieves. One of the streets leading
towards Salisbury Square is named Primrose Hill, perhaps
satirically quoting Shakespeare.
<pb n="222" id="p.222">



Salisbury Court was once the inn or city mansion of the
Bishops of Salisbury, afterwards of the Sackvilles, who held it at
first on long lease from the see, and then exchanged with Bishop
Jewel for a valuable consideration from that family.
<p>Lord Buckhurst, created by James I. Earl of Dorset, wrote
here " Ferrex and Porrex," a tragedy dealing with these two last
descendants of the mythical Brut, and gory enough to gratify
even Elizabeth's taste when performed before her. Here also
died two of his successors. The house, being finally pulled down,
was succeeded by other buildings, among which was the fine
theatre built after the Restoration by Wren, the Duke of
York's Theatre, beloved of Pepys; several other theatres have
stood here, for these houses are notoriously short-lived.
At one time the patentee was Sir William Davenant; and
Betterton, with all the best actors of the time, played there.
While in occupation of the Bishop, his domain must have,
for a time at least, extended to Fleet Street, as the following
story shows. In 1392 a baker's man was carrying bread along
Fleet Street. As he passed the Bishop of Salisbury's house, one of
his servants stole a loaf, which the baker endeavoured to regain,
and was wounded in the scuffle. The servant retired to the house,
and when the constable demanded him, he was not surrendered.
The populace, siding with the constable, threatened to fire the
house. In hot haste the Mayor and aldermen were summoned,
and with great difficulty got the people to go away. The culprit
was not surrendered.
<p>The Bishop went to the King, who ordered the Mayor to be
sent prisoner to Windsor. The liberties of the city were seized,
and a custos appointed, and at length the whole matter
<pb n="223" id="p.223">



was settled by the city paying a fine of 3000 marks, and, to
further mollify His Majesty, the parish clerks of London performed a "mystery play" at Clerkenwell in the presence of the
King and Queen and the whole court for three days; while at
the same time much more substantial peace-offerings were presented to the King.
<p>This sort of justice goes far to explain why the citizens took
the trouble, during the reign of King John, in <date value="1211">1211</date>, to dig the
town ditch-an enormous undertaking; it was 200 feet broad
(probably this is a misprint for 20 feet), and extended from the
Tower ditch to Christ's Hospital. It took the worthy citizens
two years to do it, but probably they were satisfied that it might
help them in their struggle for freedom. This ditch remained
till <date value="1595">1595</date>, when the last attempt was made to clean it (probably
it was no longer necessary). The work was given up, and it
became stable land, and was soon covered with buildings.
Salisbury Square has had other mobs at a later date. In
<date value="1716">1716</date> the citizens were much troubled by Jacobites, who
assembled in alehouses, where they kept cudgels; when any
tumult arose, they sallied forth and either dispersed the mob or
assisted, as it pleased them. The people were enraged at this
intervention in their quarrels, and on the 4th July attacked and
rifled one of these alehouses in Salisbury Court; for which five
of the rioters were afterwards hanged opposite the said house.
But it is the genius of Samuel Richardson which more
especially presides over this square. Born in Derby, he was
apprenticed to Mr. Wylde, a London printer, and, like the
industrious apprentice of the story-books, married his master's
daughter. Setting up in business for himself in a court off
<pb n="224" id="p.224">



Fleet Street, he prospered-printer of the Journals of the
House of Commons, in <date value="1754">1754</date> chosen master of the Stationers'
Company; and six years later he purchased a moiety of the
patent of printer to the King, which greatly increased his
profits.
<p>A prosperous and liberal man, he wrote his novels in the
back shop in the intervals of business. He was fifty when he
published his first novel, "Pamela," really the first English
novel of any consequence. It reflects the type of man he was.
It is full of the prudish moralities of a gross and dissipated age.
Much associated with women all his life, the mysteries and
intricacies of the female heart were supposed to be print to him,
to quote Mrs. Gamp ; and after the publication of "Pamela,"
he lived for the rest of his life in a halo of feminine worship.
Fielding-rude man-parodied it with "Joseph Andrews," and
gave deadly offence to Richardson thereby. His later novels
were much inferior in quality.
<p>Goldsmith worked for him as a proof-reader for a considerable time, and it would be very interesting to know what
the man thought of the master, and vice versa, but that is one
of the hidden pages of history. We know what Johnson
thought. In the Rambler, <date value="1751-07-19">February 19, 1751</date>, he writes:
"The reader is indebted for this day's entertainment to an
author from whom the age has received greater favours, who has
enlarged the knowledge of human nature, and taught the passions
to move at the command of virtue." The article denounces the
follies and extravagances of women of fashion in unmeasured
terms, and is interesting in its treatment of a question which
is still with us. Macaulay says: "Johnson, Collins, Fielding,
<pb n="225" id="p.225">
















and Thomson were certainly four of the most distinguished
persons England produced in the eighteenth century. It is
well known that all four were arrested for debt. Richardson,
like a man of sense, kept his shop, and his shop kept him, which
his novels scarcely would have done." But perhaps the others
would have done so if they had been lucky enough to have
one. Richardson's shop was near the centre of the square,
and probably was in one of the houses shown in the drawing.
All these are of a date anterior to Richardson's time, while the
public-house, which has a sign announcing that it is "The
Ancient Grocers' Discussion Hall," may have been the ale-house
referred to earlier.
<p>Locke was at one time resident in the square, and wrote
his "Essay on the Human Understanding" while living there.
A little to the west, in Fleet Street, is Mitre Court. A few
old houses are left, and there is a pleasant little glimpse through
the archway into King's Bench Walk, where, at No. 5, William
Murray, afterwards Earl of Mansfield, had his chambers, where
late one evening came a client, who, finding that he had gone to
a supper party, opened her mind so voluminously, that the
servant on his return informed him " that he could not tell who
she was-she would not give her name; but she swore so
dreadfully that I am sure she must be a lady of quality." The
servant was quite right-his visitor was Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough.
<p>In 16 Mitre Court Buildings, Charles Lamb lived from
1815 to 1825, on the attic floor, "whence with a glass he
could see the Surrey hills. My bed faces the river, so that by
perking my carcase on my elbows, without much wrying my
<pb n="226" id="p.226">



neck, I can see the white sails glide by the bottom of King's
Bench Walk." In these years among his intimates were Cole-
ridge, Leigh Hunt, Hazlitt, Talfourd, Crabb Robinson, George
Dyer, Martin Burney, and many other well-known men.
There is a Mitre Tavern in the court, but it is not the
place where Johnson, Boswell, Burke, Reynolds, and others had
a literary club; the "Mitre" known to them was No. 39 Fleet
Street.
<p>Westward is Falcon Court, taking its name from the sign of
Wynkyn de Worde; it has been entirely rebuilt. In this court
resided John Murray, the founder of the firm of publishers.
While here he published "Childe Harold" and started the
Quarterly Review.
<p>Over the way, Drayton's house, next the church, has been
shorn of its fine front, and is now a newspaper office.



<div1 type="entry"><head>CLIFFORD'S INN AND ST. DUNSTAN'S,
FLEET STREET</><p>

A passage to the west of the church leads into one of
those green spots surrounded by old houses, where time seems
to slumber.
<p>Of Clifford's Inn the history runs far back. "This house
anciently belonged to Muscaline Harley, escheator on the south
of the river Trent to Edward I." Probably he was not a good
accountant, and the house fell in to the King for money due
by Harley. Edward II. granted the same to Robert de Clifford,
<pb n="227" id="p.227">



to be held at the quit-rent of one penny annually, paid into
the Exchequer at Michaelmas.
In <date value="1345">1345</date> Isabel, widow of the baron, demised the said
messuage to certain students of the law, at the rent of 10
per year, and soon after, in consideration of l600, granted
the same to Nicolas Sulyard and others, the principal and
"ancients" of the said house, for a yearly rental of 4, since
which time it has continued a residence of the "gentlemen of
the faculty," became an Inn of Chancery in the reign of
Edward III., and had the sign of the "Black Lion." The
students, like those of other places, were liable to create troubles.
In August <date value="1442">1442</date> a nocturnal tumult happened in Fleet Street
between the students of the Inns of Court and the citizens,
occasioned by one Harbottle of Clifford's Inn. Many were
killed and wounded on both sides. The Mayor and sheriffs
and a body of citizens repaired thither at the approach of dawn,
and happily put an end to a dangerous riot, which had been
like to have involved the whole city. Many famous lawyers
have lived here, of whom Coke was perhaps the most illustrious.
He was here as a student, but the chambers most intimately
connected with his name stood where are now 1 and 2 Mitre
Court Buildings. A recent writer, Mrs. Cook, says: "Here
lived the six attorneys of the Marshalsea Courts, which rendered
this little spot the fountainhead of more misery than any whole
county of England." The place has literary associations also.
Here lived George Dyer, the bookworm friend of Charles
Lamb, the "G. D." of the "Essays." He was a classical reader
for the press, and an antiquary of repute. Lamb worked many
of his jokes on him, such as persuading him that Castlereagh
<pb n="228" id="p.228">



wrote the "Waverley Novels," and that the Persian Ambassador
and his suite went to Primrose Hill to worship the rising sun.
His mode of life was described by Leigh Hunt, with a
touch of exaggeration: "Breakfasting with no butter, no knife
to cut bread, and a teapot without a spout."
The charm of his personality and learning were great
enough to bring to his chambers such men as Sir Walter Scott,
Coleridge, Southey, and many others. In mature years he
married a widow, either a neighbour or servant, and she was
an excellent wife to him, although, as he explained, "she was
not literary," being unable to read or write.
<p>In the hall, which has been partially rebuilt in the
eighteenth century, Sir Matthew Hale and seventeen judges sat
to judge the perplexed claims arising after the Great Fire. It
seems strange to us that a learned man, an upright judge like
Sir Matthew Hale, should have, in <date value="1664">1664</date>, at Bury St. Edmunds,
condemned some poor people for witchcraft. It is even more
so when we read Baxter's opinion of him: "He was a man
of no quick utterance, but spoke with great reason. He was
most precisely just, insomuch that I believe he would have lost
all he had rather than do an unjust act. . . . The pillar of
justice, the refuge of the subject that feared oppression ..
Every man who had a just cause was almost past fear if he could
bring it before the court or assize where he sat. He was the
great instrument for the rebuilding of London . . . dealing
with all controversies that hindered, he was the constant judge
who for nothing followed the work, and by his prudence and
justice removed a multitude of grave impediments."
<p>The later traditions include Samuel Butler, a man clever,
<pb n="229" id="p.229">


reckless, and impatient of formulas, who died in <date value="1902">1902</date>. He
wrote several books, but his fame rests to a large extent on
"Erewhon." He resided in Clifford's Inn for a considerable
time.
<p>The hall is now used for various purposes, and has been
threatened with demolition for some years.
At the feasts of the Society of Clifford's Inn, a curious
and ancient custom prevailed. The president took up four
little loaves, baked together in the form of a cross, knocked
them thrice on the table in honour of the Trinity. After grace
was said, these loaves were passed down the table, as a sign
that the fragments of the feast were to be given to the poor.
The church tower shown is that of St. Dunstan's in the
West, rebuilt by Shaw in <date value="1831">1831</date> on the site of the older church
where Strafford was baptized and Baxter preached. Tyndal
was preaching here when he attracted the notice of Humphrey
Monmouth, who took him to his house to live and carry out
his translation of the Bible. In the middle of the eighteenth
century, when William Romaine preached there, the crowds
were so great as to block the street.
<p>Over the side entrance, facing Fleet Street, is a remarkable statue of Queen Elizabeth, formerly on Ludgate. Evelyn
mentions seeing it, still in position uninjured, during the Great
Fire, when the city gates and bars were melted. In the rebuilding of the church, in <date value="1832">1832</date>, the statue was sold for l16, 10s.,
but seven years later it was repurchased and put in its present
position.
<p>The church is of ancient foundation. It is mentioned in
<date value="1237">1237</date>, when the Abbot and Convent of Westminster bestowed
<pb n="230" id="p.230">



it on Henry III., for the profits to go to his pet scheme, the
house for the conversion of Jews, at the Rolls.
It was here that Pepys heard an able sermon by the
minister of the place, and "stood by a pretty modest maid,
whom I did labour to take by the hand, but she would not,
but got further and further from me; and at last I could perceive her take pins from her pocket to prick me if I should
touch her again, which seeing, I did forbear, and was glad I
did spy her design, and then I fell to gaze upon another pretty
maid in a pew close by me, and she on me, and I did go about
to take her by the hand, which she suffered a little, and then
withdrew. So the sermon ended."
<p>Another notable sermon here was that preached annually
in memory of Mr. Fisher, a cordwainer, on the 10th July.
After the sermon, certain sums were given to the poor, and
the congregation were treated to a drink of sack. No doubt
this was a popular sermon in its day.
<p>Sion College was founded in <date value="1625">1625</date> by Thomas White,
rector of St. Dunstan's in the West, for the improvement of
the London clergy.
<p>The Devil Tavern stood between the church and Chancery Lane, taking its name from the legendary conflict between
St. Dunstan and the devil. It is difficult to understand why
this saint became so popular; if half the legends told of him
are true, he must have been an unpleasant beast-witness his
treatment of King Edwy and Elgiva. His second conflict with
Satan, when he shod his majesty with red-hot horseshoes, is of
course the origin of the superstition about these things; it is not
so much that they bring luck as that they keep out the
<pb n="231" id="p.231">



devil and all his emissaries. The saint no doubt lived in a
fervour of righteousness. All pretty women, he believed, were
snares of the devil; perhaps they are, but it was carrying his
belief to excess when he and Odo of Canterbury first seared
Elgiva's face with hot irons and then had her hamstrung and
starved to death.
<p>Behind where this tavern stood is Serjeants' Inn, all
modernised. It was inhabited by serjeants of the law in the
time of Henry IV. Henry V. devised it to the judges and
apprentices of the law. It is notable as the scene of a meeting
which had considerable influence on English history. When
Charles I., in his search for means to raise money, had finished
with the inquiry into the alienation of royal demesnes, and had
on that account fined Salisbury l20,000,Westmoreland l19,000,
Sir Christopher Hatton l12,000, and many others smaller sums,
Noy, one of the commissioners, found among the records in
the Tower, writs compelling ports, on occasion, to provide ships
for the use of the King, and other writs obliging the neighbouring counties to contribute to the expense. This was too good
a discovery to be lost, and writs were issued ordering the ports
to supply certain ships, armed and manned, to rendezvous at
Portsmouth six months thence. The experiment succeeded; those
who refused to pay were imprisoned, and it was resolved to extend the measure to the whole kingdom. The various sheriffs
were informed that their counties were assessed at a certain number
of ships, reckoned at a certain sum, and payable in cash. It
was better than El Dorado. The King received l218,500
which was, however, devoted to the purpose. Sixty sail of ships
swept the narrow seas, and the admirals received orders to sink
<pb n="232" id="p.232">



every foreign ship which refused to salute the English flag.
But-there were grave doubts of the legality of the assessment.
Sir John Finch, late Speaker, was made Lord Chief Justice, and
he, visiting each judge in private, canvassed for votes, and
obtained the unanimous resolution that "where the benefit
redounded to the ports and maritime parts, the charge was
lawfully laid on them; so, for the good and safety of the
kingdom, the charge ought to be borne by the whole realm."
Three months later two other questions were propounded
to the judges: "1st, Whether, in cases of danger to the good
and safety of the kingdom in general, the King could not
impose ship money for its defence and safeguard, and by law
compel payment by those who refused; 2nd, Whether he were
not the sole judge, both of the danger and when and how it was
to be prevented." The judges assembled in the hall of Serjeants'
Inn; ten were in favour of the King's prerogative ; two-Crook
and Hutton-dissenting, but signing their names, on the principle
that the judgment of the majority was that of the whole body.
The judges had believed that their opinion was asked for the
private satisfaction of the King, and were astonished when the
Lord Keeper read it in public in the Star Chamber; and it was
ordered to be enrolled in all the courts in Westminster, while
they were ordered to repeat and explain it at the assizes during
their circuits. The idea extended. Having power to do this for
the navy, why not for the army ? What is law in England is
law in Scotland and Ireland, and the King becomes an absolute
monarch. "A quiet, courteous, submissive" gentleman in
Buckinghamshire-the last man in England expected to oppose
the judges-refused to pay his assessment of twenty shillings,
<pb n="233" id="p.233">



and the Barons of the Exchequer, with the judges, discussed the
matter for eleven days, and took three months to deliberate;
seven pronounced in favour of the King, five in favour of
Hampden; but of these only two-Hutton and Crook-denied
the right claimed by the Crown. Hailed by the court as a
great victory, it was the first seed sown that presently produced
such a woeful harvest for England and for Charles.
<p>A little higher up stood the Rolls, now covered by the
huge Record Office, in which some part of the chapel, and the
tombs, is still to be seen. Originally this house was founded-
by Henry III. for the conversion of Jews, who lived there
under a learned Christian, appointed to instruct and govern
them. The governing probably was done with a rough hand,
if we may judge from various incidents.
In <date value="1262">1262</date>, "Fyve hundred Jewes were slayne by the citizens
of London because one Jew would have forced a Christian man
to have payde more than two pence for the usury of twenty
shillings for a week."
<p>In <date value="1279">1279</date> Edward I. caused 280 Jews of both sexes to be
hanged for clipping (defacing) coins; he bestowed one-half of
their property on the preachers who undertook the trouble of
converting the unbelieving race; the other half was set aside
for the support of converts. It seems a curious method of
endowment, but a certain grim humour sometimes appears in
their dealings with this race. In 1259 Fabian telleth a tale
of a Jew "that fell into a lake upon a Satterday, which was
the Jewes' Saboth day, and would not, for reverence of his
Saboth, bee plucked out, whereof the Erle of Gloucester, hearing
that the Jew did so great reverence for his Saboth day, thought
<pb n="234" id="p.234">



he would do as much to his Saboth day, which was Sunday,
and so commanded him bee kept there until Monday, at which
tyme hee was found dead."
<p>The scheme for conversion did not flourish, and about
1289 "the Jewes were wholly expelled out of this realm, and,
in 1377, the place was first applied to the use of the Rolls or
records. The office of Master of the Rolls is of great dignity,
ranking next to that of the Lord Chief Justice of the King's
Bench, but now having nothing to do with records. The present Rolls Court is a survival from Wolsey's time. He, when
Chancellor, was much in favour of cheap and expeditious law,
and introduced several improvements in the administration of
the law, among these being a Court of Requests, where the poor
might plead their cause in person. His reputation for justice
and quickness caused this court to be so crowded with suitors,
that Wolsey was overwhelmed with business, and the King, to
relieve him, established four other courts on the same lines,
and it is one of these that survives.
<p>In 1534 the office of Master of the Rolls was held by
Thomas Cromwell-the same year that troubles began to fall
on Sir Thomas More and his friend Fisher.
<p>The chapel was rebuilt by Inigo Jones, Dr. Donne preaching the consecration sermon in 1617. It contained some fine
tombs-one to John Young, Master in the sixteenth century;
to Lord Bruce of Kinloss; to Sir Richard Allington; to Sir John
Trevor, Speaker of the House of Commons, who was compelled
to pronounce his own conviction and dismissal for bribery,
and one to Sir John Strange-
<p>"Here lies an honest lawyer-that is Strange."
<pb n="235" id="p.235">



Bishops Atterbury and Butler were both preachers, but perhaps the most famous of these was Gilbert Burnet, more popular
in his preaching than in his "History." His sermons were so
well liked that his congregation would desire him to turn the
hour-glass when it was exhausted, and give them another hour
of sermon. Charles II. wished to make him a bishop, but he
declined court favour, and remonstrated with the King on the
errors of government. Charles threw the letter in the fire;
but later, when Burnet attended Lord William Russell to the
scaffold, James II. was so incensed that he discharged him from
his offices. Burnet went abroad, returning with William of
Orange, who made him Bishop of Salisbury. His "History,"
left for publication after his death, was for many years one of
the best-abused books of the day. It was too honest for the
period.
<p>Lord Strafford was born in Chancery Lane, and over a
grocer's shop abutting on Serjeants' Inn, Cowley first saw
the light, and as a boy studied "The Faerie Queene" till he
became " irrecoverably a poet." On the same side, and almost
at the same spot, "the seventh as you walk towards Holborn,"
Izaak Walton had half a shop after he removed from the
timbered house over the way (this last is shown in Brayly's
"Londiniana"). At this time he married Ann, the sister of
Bishop Ken, memorable for his saintly life and for being the
author of the well-known hymn-
"Awake, my soul, and with the sun
Thy daily stage of duty run."

The other half of the new shop was occupied by a hosier,
<pb n="236" id="p.236">



who perhaps looked after both when gentle Izaak set his face
towards Amwell and the pleasant waters of the Lea-a long
walk even on such a fresh summer morning as he has crystallised
for us, so that the fragrance still dwells in his pages. Jacob
Tonson's shop was "the first on the east side, between Serjeants'
Inn and Fleet Street."
<p>When Coleridge ran away from Cambridge he spent his
first night in London on a doorstep in Chancery Lane, enlisting
in the army on the following day. Proclamations were delivered
here, so we read: "On the 6th December the Lord Mayor,
attended by divers of the nobility and aldermen, and eighty of
the principal citizens, in velvet and chains of gold, with the
greatest solemnity proclaimed in Chancery Lane the sentence of
death lately passed on that unfortunate princess, Mary, Queen
of Scotland." The Serjeants' Inn, on the south side of Fleet
Street, was rebuilt in 1670 by the subscriptions of the
serjeants. It had previously been held, since the time of
Henry VI., from the Dean and Chapter of York at a yearly
rental of ten marks.
<p>One of the earliest coffee-houses was the "Rainbow," by the
Temple in Fleet Street. In 1657 the owner, Farr, was indicted
for "making and selling a sort of liquor called 'coffee,' whereby,
in making it, he annoyed his neighbours by evil smells, and for
keeping of fire for the most part night and day, to the great
danger and affrightment of his neighbours." This keeping of
fires alight was a matter on which the citizens were, and had
reason to be, very nervous. When Milton wrote of the
"Bellman's drowsy charm
To bless the doors from nightly harm,"

<pb n="237" id="p.237">



he wrote of what was then a modern custom. Less than eighty
years had elapsed since, in 1556, Christopher Draper, Alderman
of Cordwainer Street Ward, appointed a man to go about his
ward at night with a bell, and at certain places, with an audible
voice, "to bid the citizens be careful of their fires and lights, to
help the poor, and to pray for the dead." The experiment was
approved, and, in the same year, by act of the Common Council,
"It was ordered, that in every ward in London there should be
appointed one man--which should be found at the charges of the
ward by turn and course of houses-to watch and to go at
night long about the ward with a little bell in his hand, which,
at every lane and street corner he should toll three times and
then cry: 'Look well to your fire and candle;' and the same
man was called the bellman. But this device had no continuance, for within four months it was clearly suppressed and
left off. Surely the policy was good and very necessary for the
good order of the city, for this was the 'frayer' away both of
w e and thief, and the bewrayer and warning-giver of fires
and other mischiefs; and therefore great pity it is so good an
order should have no better continuance. The cause of the
leaving of this watchman, as is commonly said, was, that many
citizens murmured and grudged to pay the poor man his wages
when it came to his turn, which, in some wards, is not three
pence of a household in a whole year."
<p>There was another bellman mentioned in 1563. "Yt
should make sale of all household stuff which belonged to any
persons yt should be enforced to sell the same, and to have one
farthing upon the shilling for his paines."
Coffee-houses were not regarded with very friendly eyes by
<pb n="238" id="p.238">



various governments. Men met in them and discussed the
affairs of the State and the latest pamphlet. So, in 1676, the
Attorney-General issued an order that all these were to be shut
up, although the owners had taken out licences, "Because in
such houses, and by the meeting of disaffected persons in them,
divers false, malicious, and scandalous reports were devised and
spread abroad, to the defamation of His Majesty's Government,
and the disturbance of the quiet and peace of the realm." But
this order aggravated the disease. It was denounced as unjust
and cruel a violation of the right of Englishmen to meet and
discuss political subjects; and on presentation of a petition, the
order was withdrawn, but with the condition that keepers of
such places must prevent in them the reading and publication of
libels against the King and his Government.

<div1 type="entry"><head>THE TEMPLE</><p>
The Temple is a curious maze of courts, alleys, gardens,
and narrow passage-ways, and consists of two divisions-the
Inner and the Middle Temple; but which is one and which the
other, is a geography known to the Benchers and their officers.
There are many picturesque corners within its boundaries, and
passing from Fleet Street, with its noise, you are at once lapped
in an atmosphere of quietness in which you may mentally drift
back through the centuries until you come to somewhere about
1185. There are complete and detailed histories of the place,
which fill many large volumes, but which are hardly suitable for
everyday use by the common man.
<p>The order of the Knights Templars started as a pilgrim
<pb n="239" id="p.239">



agency, much after the fashion of more modern institutions of
the same kind. After the taking of Jerusalem from the Saracens,
a vast concourse of pilgrims journeyed to the Holy Sepulchre,
and a pious man named Gerardus, associating with other persons
of his religion, assumed a black garment, with a white cross
having light spikes, and undertook the care of the Hospital
already founded in Jerusalem for the use and lodging of pilgrims,
and also undertook to protect them from the many perils on the
way in coming and returning.
<p>At the battle of Ascalon, Gerardus so distinguished himself
that Godfrey of Bouillon instituted them an order of knights,
and endowed them with great estates for their support in this
good work. Other pious men bequeathed or gave them other
estates, until ultimately the order owned, in various parts of
Christendom, 19,000 manors. Their headquarters in London
was removed to this spot in 1184, they being then settled in
their house by Smithfield for over eighty years. Continuing to
flourish, by 1303 their prior ranked as the first baron of
England, and lived in the highest state; but they grew too
great. As Spenser says-

"Where now the studious lawyers have their bowers,
There whilome wont the Templar-knights to bide,
Till they decayed through pride."

The order in England was suppressed by Edward II., and
the Temple was granted to Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pem-
broke. At his death it passed to the Knights Hospitallers, who
leased the Inner and Middle Temple to students of the common
law in 1346. The last prior of the Hospitallers living at their
<pb n="240" id="p.240">




house near Smithfield was granted a pension of l1000 a year
by Henry VIII., but died on Ascension Day, 1540, of a broken
heart.
<p>While still in the occupation of the Templars, the Temple
was the scene of a Parliament, which, though little noticed, had
far-reaching effects. This was in 1305, during the reign of
Edward I. " This yeare the nobles of Scotland, in a parliament
holden in the New Temple in London, did willingly swear to be
true to the King of England, and to kepe the law of Scotland
against all persons." In the following year, by the counsel of the
Abbot of Scone, they chose to be their King Robert le Bruce.
The Temple was not finally conferred on the lawyers until
this was done by James I., who declared in one of his speeches
in the Star Chamber on the alien question, that only three
classes of people had any right to settle in London-"the
courtiers, the citizens, and the gentlemen of the Inns of Court."
The oldest part of the church, built in memory of the
round church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, dates from
1185; the newer part, from 1240, contains many tombs of the
knights and nobles, many unidentified, and one solitary woman-
Queen Eleanor, mother of Richard I. and John. There are
also many tombs of later date. Opening from the stairs leading
to the triforium of the round church is a penitential cell, 4 feet
6 inches by 2 feet 6 inches, with openings into the church.
Here, unable to lie down, errant knights were confined under
the rigid rules of the order, not deprived of such consolation as
they might gather from the services of the church, but in some
cases starved to death, and in others dragged forth naked every
day and flogged before the high altar.


<pb n="241" id="p.241">





The organ was built by Father Smydt, and approved after
a long competition with one built by an Englishman, Harris.
Both organs were erected in the church, and Draghi, organist
to Queen Catherine, played that of Harris. The other was
played by Blow and Purcell. The preacher at the Temple is
called the Master, and at the end of his house is the monument
to Oliver Goldsmith.
<p>Every nook and cranny in the Temple has a history; all
day long, and every day, the pilgrims come and go, each trying
to spell a little of it, and none able to read it all.
Inner Temple Gateway is a Jacobean structure lately
restored and preserved by the County Council, and had nothing
to do with Henry VIII. Middle Temple Gateway as it stands
was rebuilt by Wren after the Great Fire, the previous gate
having been erected by Sir Amyas Powlett on a singular
occasion. In 1501 Sir Amyas put Wolsey, who was then
parson of Lymington, in the stocks for being drunk. Fourteen
years afterwards he was ordered by Wolsey, now Cardinal, to
come to London, and, on account of that ancient grudge, he was
ordered not to quit the town until further orders. "In con-
sequence he lodged five or six years in this gateway, which he
rebuilt; and, to pacify his Eminence, adorned the front with the
Cardinal's cap, badges, cognizances, and other devices of this
butcher's son; so low were great men obliged to stoop to that
meteor of the times." It was a son of this Sir Amyas, bearing
the same name, who was made keeper of Mary, Queen of Scots,
by Elizabeth, who wrote to him as "Amyas, my most careful
and faithful servant, God reward thee treblefold in the double
for thy most troublesome charge, so well discharged . .
<pb n="242" id="p.242">



I cannot balance in any weight of my judgement the value
I prize you at." But the lady was fickle, and his reward was
nothing, because, it is said, he refused to put Mary to death
without a warrant.
<p>In the years that have flown since Wren rebuilt the
gateway, how much of history has taken place within its shadow!
Yet it is possible that in the present widening of the street it
also may disappear.
<p>Overlooking Temple Bar, the scene of a pause in many
pageants, and long-drawn gory memories, thousands of great
men have passed through its portals-men who have made the
history of England. If ever, in the moonlight, the ghosts of the
Temple "walk," what a company they must be! For nearly
eight hundred years the greatest of the world have passed
through its courts or lived in its chambers. One "Walpurgis"
night would not suffice for a moiety of the phantoms to
pass by.
<p>Long after the Knights of St. John had vanished, Chaucer
was a student there; Spenser, Sidney, Leicester, Essex, Raleigh,
Evelyn, Pepys, Clarendon, Wolsey- a crowd of names remem-
bered and a still more numerous company forgotten. One of
Shakespeare's plays is said to have been acted in his lifetime in
the beautiful hall of the Middle Temple, and in the gardens he
lays the opening scene of the Wars of the Roses. Britain has
grown from childhood round the Temple Church. Sir John
Fortescue assures us that, in the education of the students, "All
vice was there discountenanced and banished, and everything
good and virtuous was taught there; music, dancing, singing,
history, sacred and profane, and other accomplishments." If the
<pb n="243" id="p.243">



modern lawyer or barrister found himself in garments such as
are specified and condemned in various sumptuary laws, he would
imagine himself clothed for a fancy dress ball. Henry VIII.
ordered that gentlemen of the Inner Temple should reform
themselves in their cut or disguised apparel, and not wear long
beards. In the Middle Temple in Mary's time, none of the
society shall wear great breeches in their hose after the Dutch,
Spanish, or German fashion, or lawn upon their caps, or cut
doublets. Lincoln's Inn gentlemen were forbidden to wear cut
or pansied hosen, or breeches, or pansied doublets, and yet one
slovenly gentleman was fined five groats for going, in his study
gown, into Cheapside on a Sunday, the rule being that none
should wear their study gowns in the city, further than Fleet
Bridge or Holborn Bridge, on the one side, and the Savoy on
the other. None except benchers or knights should wear in
their doublets or hose any light colour except scarlet or crimson,
or any velvet cap, or any scarf, or wings to their gowns, white
jerkins, buskins, or velvet shoes, double cuffs on their shirts,
feathers or ribbons in their caps, &amp;c. With all these fine clothes,
it is remarked that, "anciently at their entertainments their
bread served instead of plates, and no other vessels to drink out
of except wooden cups; but at present (1742) they are allowed
trenchers for their meat, and coarse green earthenware pots for
their liquor; but however the ancient custom of using mean
vessels prevails, yet there are few that fare better."
To most people it is only a few names that combine to
make the Temple sacred ground, and, curiously enough, none
of these were lawyers. Johnson, who had chambers there, to
secure peace, away from his own vexed fireside; Goldsmith,
<pb n="244" id="p.244">



who took chambers and blossomed into fine clothes on the
money received for "The Good-natured Man," and after six
years died in No. 2 Brick Court, lamented by the poor and the
outcast. Garden Court is enchanted, because Charles Dickens
imagined a little idyll of lovers meeting there, and because
Charles Lamb dwells so lovingly on it, and the fountain "which
I have made to rise and fall how many times."
Although renovated in recent years, it is a poor little
squirt. Sir Christopher Hatton had surely been dining when
he said it sprang to "a vast and almost incredible altitude."
But many a wanderer from far lands has strayed into Garden
Court and tried to idealise the scene into some likeness to what
he had dreamed of.
<p>A doorway from Garden Court and a passage from the
Strand leads into Devereux Court. The bust, high on the
wall, often said to be that of Elizabeth's Essex, is really
that of his somewhat faint-hearted son, who was a general in
the Parliamentary forces during the struggle with Charles I.
When he left London to march against the Royalists, Essex
requested the assembly of divines to keep a fast for his success.
This was done. "We spent from 9 to 5 graciously. After
Dr. Twisse had begun with a brief prayer, Mr. Marshall prayed
large two hours, most divinely, confessing the sins of the
members of the assembly in a wonderful, pathetick, and prudent
way. After, Mr. Arrowsmith preached an hour, then a psalm;
and thereafter Mr. Vines prayed near two hours, and Mr. Palmer
preached an hour, and Mr. Seaman prayed near two hours,
then a psalm. After, Mr. Henderson brought them to a sweet
conference of the heat confessed in the assembly, and other
<pb n="245" id="p.245">


seen faults to be remedied, and the conveniency to preach
against all sects, especially Anabaptists and Antinomians. Dr.
Twisse closed with a short prayer and blessing. God was so
evidently in all this exercise that we expect certainly a blessing."
The bust marks the site of the "Grecian" coffee-house, opened
in 1652 by the Greek servant of a Levant merchant. It
was patronised by Sir Isaac Newton, Dr. Halley, Hans Sloane,
Steele, Addison, and their circle. "Tom's" coffee-house, a
literary resort of Georgian days, was also in this court.
The "Grecian" was much resorted to by law students, whose
gay apparel excited the wrath and contempt of Addison. "I
do not know that I meet in any of my walks objects which
move both my spleen and laughter so effectually as the young
fellows at the 'Grecian.' "
<p>In the "Essex Head," a tavern in which the Thrales had an
interest, Johnson founded a literary club, which Joshua Reynolds
refused to join, it is said, because the standard fine was the
vulgar sum of twopence.

<div1 type="entry"><head>ESSEX HOUSE</><p>
Essex House stood on the site of Devereux Court and
the present Essex Street. Some fragments of the original building
are said to survive in Essex Hall, a well-known meeting-place
of the present day, the ground originally being part of the
Temple. This is the Unitarian chapel mentioned by Lamb in
"My Relations," where his aunt, finding the door open one
day, "went in, liked the sermon and the manner of worship,
and frequented it at intervals for some time after."
<pb n="246" id="p.246">



The first building here was the town-house of the Bishop
of Exeter, Walter Stapleton, Lord Treasurer of England. This
was the man who founded Exeter College, Oxford, but he was
not a prelate to be proud of. At that time King Edward II.
afflicted his country with various favourites. The first of these,
Piers Gaveston, was, after a long struggle in which many lives
were lost, seized by the barons and put to death. He was
succeeded by Sir Hugh Spencer and his son, and they proved
worse-"by the favour of the King practised such cruelty,
and bare themselves so haughty and proudly, that no lord
in this land might say anything against them in anything
they thought good." Out of fear of them, Queen Isabel and
her young son fled to her brother, Charles, King of France,
and among those who went with her was Walter Stapleton.
The barons invited her to come back, and they would stand for
her if she could bring but a thousand men-at-arms. But the
King and his favourites, hearing this, bribed her brother, who
warned her to avoid his realm. The poor Queen, by the aid
of Sir John of Reynauld, made her way with a few friends to
England. Meanwhile Stapleton, who knew all her "counsayles"
and "ententes," came to the King and gave him all the informa-
tion he had gathered. The barons flocked to the Queen as
soon as her landing was bruited abroad, and Edward, in a
panic, "being in feare," fled from London towards Bristowe,
leaving Stapleton to govern the city. The Bishop sent for the
Mayor and demanded the keys of the city, in virtue of his
commission, "which the Mayor denied "; and the Bishop used
stout words in the King's name, but the citizens had an evil
opinion of him, as he was a friend of the Spencers, whom they
<pb n="247" id="p.247">



hated "as evil as the devil," and he had betrayed the Queen.
The citizens arose in a rage and fury, and besieged the house,
and the Bishop fled to sanctuary in St. Paul's; but they dragged
him forth, beheaded him at the "standard in Chepe," brought
his body back, and buried it in a dung-heap at his own door
here. A great hall was added to the house by Bishop Lacy
in the time of Henry VI. It was at this house that the Duke
of Somerset, the Protector, designed the assassination of several
members of the Council. The Lord Paget was to invite
Northumberland, Northampton, and Pembroke to dine with him
at his house in the Strand, Somerset's band of a hundred cavalry
to meet and slay them on their way, or, if numerously attended,
to assassinate them at table. The scheme failed. Somerset was
tried by the grand jury at the Guildhall, impeached, and put in
the Tower; but the death of Edward VI. saved him, and, by the
influence of Mary, he was restored, and made much trouble in the
land. The house had been in possession of Lord Paget from
the time of Henry VIII. He improved the house, but, of
course, fell with Somerset, and also was restored by Mary, who
made him Lord Privy Seal. The next owner was Thomas
Howard, fourth Duke of Norfolk, who called it Norfolk House.
For a design on his part to marry Mary, Queen of Scots, he
was tried for treason and sentenced. The Queen was very
unwilling that he should be put to death, twice signing the
warrant for his execution and recalling it, but finally, urged
by the ministers and the House of Commons, did so the third
time. His son, Philip of Arundel, became owner, and later
on was also sent to the Tower, where he died after ten weary
years of confinement.
<pb n="248" id="p.248">


The next owner was Dudley, Earl of Leicester, the owner
of Kenilworth, and by him it was bequeathed to Robert
Devereux, Earl of Essex, his son-in-law. This young man
had been introduced by Dudley to the Queen, who was capti-
vated at once, and made him Master of the Horse; on the
appearance of the Armada, he, being twenty-one years of age,
was appointed Captain-General of Cavalry. She visited his
camp at Tilbury, and displayed her fondness before the whole
army; but he was young, and the " old woman," as he called
her, became somewhat irksome, and he ran away with Drake
on an expedition to Portugal, where they did not cover them-
selves with glory, leaving half their force in foreign graves. When
he returned, he found his place filled by Walter Raleigh and
Charles Blount, but after a time resumed his petulant sway,
till one day, after an expression of contempt by him, Elizabeth
struck him a violent blow on the ear and told him, "he might
go to the devil." Essex grasped his sword, but the Lord
Admiral interposed, and Essex left the room exclaiming, "that
he would not have taken such an insult from her father, much
less would he bear it from a king in petticoats." He shut
himself up in this house and sulked. Egerton, the Chancellor,
wrote to him to make submission, but in a long and indignant
letter he refused. The letter, however, quite took Elizabeth's
heart, and in a fortnight he was back at court, and reinstated
in favour. Then he was sent as Lord-Lieutenant to Ireland,
where he pined and grumbled, writing many letters to the
Queen, and at least one sonnet, wishing he could live an hermit-
<lb>"Content with hips and haws and bramble berry,
<lb>In contemplation parting out his days,"
<pb n="249" id="p.249">



but suddenly returned to London, and without stopping at his
own house, made his way to Elizabeth's presence, besmeared
with dirt and sweat from hard riding. She had just arisen, and
was sitting with her hair about her face. Essex fell on his
knees and kissed her hand. He was graciously received, but
in the afternoon he found himself in custody; there he remained
six months, and fell dangerously ill. Elizabeth sent eight doctors
to him; and, surprising to say, he recovered, and got leave to
return to his own house, with Sir Richard Berkely as his jailor.
After a time he went into the country, charging Lord Henry
Howard to tell the Queen, "that he had resolved to make
amends for his error," quoting the words of Nebuchadnezzar:
<p>"'Let my dwelling be with the beasts of the field, to eat grass
like an ox,' &amp;c., till it shall please her to restore my understanding to me." But he found no rest in the country, and
after a brief space must needs return to London and plot
treason. He had been living in privacy and solitude; now the
doors of Essex House were thrown open to former dependants,
augmented by bold and needy adventurers plotting to put
James on the throne; many of the meetings of conspirators
assembling at Drury House. Believing the citizens would rise
in his favour, he made the attempt. It was Sunday morning,
and he would meet the Mayor and aldermen at Paul's Cross
after the sermon, and call on them to follow him to the palace ;
but a few minutes before ten, Egerton, the Lord Keeper, and
others, came to his gate and demanded admittance. Parleying
with them, he lost time, and left them prisoners in his house.
Rushing into the street, he prevailed on the guard at Ludgate to
let him pass, as he was in danger from Cobham, Raleigh, and
<pb n="250" id="p.250">














others. The streets were empty, there was no meeting at Paul's
Cross, and Essex proceeded through the empty streets shouting
"For the Queen, my mistress," till he reached the house of
one of the sheriffs named Smith, in Fenchurch Street; but
Smith had vanished, and Essex remained in the house to compose
himself. At 2 P.M. a herald entered the city and proclaimed him
traitor, offering a reward of l1000 for his apprehension. The
Earl left the house, and though Burleigh retreated before him,
he was repulsed by the guard at Ludgate, and so with fifty
companions he proceeded to Queenhithe-just above where
Southwark Bridge is now-and proceeded by water to his
own house. The imprisoned lords had been released by his
own confidant, Sir Ferdinando Gorge. He proceeded to fortify
the house. In a few minutes it was surrounded by soldiers,
cannon were mounted on the tower of Clement Danes; at
6 P.M. a battering train arrived from the Tower. Lord Sands
proposed to make a desperate sally, cut their way through,
or die, as brave men ought to die, with their swords in their
hands ; but Essex, on promise of a fair trial, surrendered, and was
taken to Lambeth, passing through his water-gate and down the
stairs for the last time. Next morning he was sent to the
Tower. He was tried and condemned, but still clung to hope
of life and pleaded for forgiveness, betraying the secrets of
those implicated with him. His confession has been doubted,
but some about court carried tales to Elizabeth of his sayings
in reference to her, so in the end he was beheaded-the last
person executed within the walls of the Tower. He was thirty-
three; the Queen was sixty-seven.</p>
<p>The story of the ring has also been doubted, yet may be
<pb n="251" id="p.251">



true. It was to the effect that after Essex was condemned, he
sent a ring, which the Queen had given him as a token that she
would aid him in any great danger. This ring came into the
hands of Lady Nottingham, who kept it, instead of delivering it
to Elizabeth; in default of receiving the token, the Queen signed
the warrant for his death.</p>
<p>Lady Nottingham being a little while after upon her
deathbed in Essex House, she desired to speak to the Queen,
and having disburdened her conscience of the act, the Queen
shook the dying woman and flew away in a fury. She never
enjoyed herself perfectly after that time, but would break out in
passion, wring her hands, and cry "Oh Essex ! Essex! Essex ! "
The state of Elizabeth after the death of Essex has been
described by Sir John Harrington : "Altered in features and
reduced to a skeleton, her food was nothing but manchet
bread and succory pottage; her taste for dress was gone; she
had not changed her clothes for many days. She was the
torment of the ladies who waited on her; she stamped with her
feet, and swore violently. A sword had to be placed on her
table, which she often took and thrust violently into the tapestry."
A year later, "she dropped a tear and smote her bosom; she
held in her hand a golden cup, which she often put to her lips,
but in truth her heart seemed too full to need more filling."
What a change from an earlier description, when she was pro-
ceeding from her apartment to the chapel! "First a number
of gentlemen, barons, earls, and Knights of the Garter, the
Chancellor with the seals, between two lords carrying the
sceptre and the sword; and wherever she cast her eyes, the
spectators instantly fell on their knees. She was then sixty-five.
<pb n="p.252" id="p.252">



<p>She wore false hair of a red colour, with a crown of gold; her
face was wrinkled, her eyes small, her teeth black, her nose
prominent, the collar of the Garter about her neck, and her
bosom uncovered, as became an unmarried Queen; a long train
of young ladies in white, and gentlemen pensioners in splendid
uniforms with gilt battle-axes lined the way."
<placeName key="Essex House">Essex House</placeName>
 was occupied by various men of rank till
after the Restoration, when it fell to ruin; the greater portion
was pulled down at the close of the seventeenth century, and
<placeName key="Essex Street">Essex Street</placeName>
 and <placeName key="Devereux Court">Devereux Court</placeName>

In the house of Lady Primrose in <placeName key="Essex Street">Essex Street</placeName>
, the young <name type="person" key="Charles Edward Stuart">Pretender</name> lurked for five days in <date value="1750">1750</date>-sufficient time
to convince him of the futility of any movement on his
behalf; his father had such another escapade at the coronation
of George I. in <date value="1714">1714</date>. Thackeray used the latter incident in
"Esmond."
<p>The water-gate at the bottom of Essex Street is, without
doubt, the water-gate of the house, but is something of an
architectural puzzle. It has no feature towards the river by
which it can be traced on old maps; the pilasters look like the
work of Inigo Jones, while the design might be work of the
sixteenth century. It may be that it is the work of some of the
early Italian architects, and so as old as it appears to be; at any
rate, it is the only fragment pertaining to the house that is
visible now.

Why the authorities did not turn the old gateway aside and rebuild it over Bell Yard, instead of disposing of it, and putting up
<pb n="253" id="p.253">



the present obstruction, is beyond comprehension. Shire Lane,
now covered by the Law Courts, was the home of the Kit
Cat Club, and near them was the Bible Tavern, a place of
somewhat evil reputation, with a convenient underground
passage and trapdoor into Bell Yard.
<p>The ceremony of "Burning the Pope" was enacted opposite
the gateway of the <placeName key="Middle Temple">Middle Temple</placeName>
. This procession originally
was a celebration of the accession of Queen Elizabeth, but by
the time of Charles II. it had degenerated into a demonstration
to excite popular resentment against the Duke of York and the
Catholic religion.
<p>The most famous of these processions were in <date value="1679">1679</date>, <date value=1680>1680</date>,
and <date value="1681">1681</date>, the prime movers being known as "The Green
Ribbon Club"; they were finally suppressed by force in <date value="1682">1682</date>.
A description of the pageant of <date value="1679">1679</date> is given.
On the <date value="1679-11-17">17th November 1679</date>, the anniversary of the
accession of Queen Elizabeth, a pageant-calculated to make a
deep impression on the public mind, lately agitated by the
murder of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey-was exhibited by the
Green Ribbon Club. First appeared a bellman, with slow
and solemn pace, ringing his bell and calling at intervals,
"Remember Mr. Justice Godfrey"; next a man in the habit
of a Jesuit, bearing on horseback the figure of a dead body,
followed by nuns, monks, priests, Catholic bishops in copes
and mitres, Protestant bishops with lawn sleeves, six cardinals
with their caps, and, last of all, the Pope, in a litter, accompanied
by the devil.
<p>This procession started from Moorfields in the evening, and
amidst the glare of several thousand torches perambulated the
<pb n="254" id="p.254">



city, the spectators swearing hatred of Popery and calling for
vengeance on Papists. At last, coming to <name type="org" key="Temple Bar">Temple Bar</name>, they
halted in front of the King's Arms Tavern, fireworks were let off,
and the Pope, with all his attendants, cast into a bonfire and
consumed. The echo of the shouting "reached by continued
reverberations to Scotland, France, and Rome itself, damping
them all with a dreadful astonishment."
<p>Perhaps the first detailed notice of London fog is in
<persname key="Evelyn">Evelyn's</> Diary, <date value="1684-01-24">24th January 1684</date>, in writing of the severe
frost: "The Thames before London was still planted with
booths in formal streets, all sorts of trades and shops furnished
and full of commodities, even to a printing-press. Coaches
plied from Westminster to the Temple, and from several other
stairs to and fro as in the streets. Slides, sliding with skates, a
bull-baiting, horse and coach races, puppet plays and interludes,
cooks, tipling and other lewd places, so that it seemed to be a
Bacchanalian triumph or carnival on the water. . . London, by
reason of the excessive coldness of the air hindering the ascent
of the smoke, was so filled with fuliginous steam of sea coal that
hardly could one see across the streets, and this, filling the lungs
with its gross particles, exceedingly obstructed the breast." We
still have all these symptoms, and greatly exaggerated, but as a
rule we do not use so stately language as Evelyn in describing
them.
<p>The <orgname>Cock Tavern</> stood opposite <placename>Middle Temple Gate</>,
where is now <placename>201 Fleet Street</>. The present tavern of that
name, on the other side of the street, where it clothes itself with
the glories of the vanished house, is not the house where Pepys
flirted with Mrs. Knipp, "ate a lobster, sang and drank and
<pb n="255" id="p.255">



mighty merry till almost midnight"; nor where Tennyson
mused-
<lb>"High over roaring Temple Bar,
<lb>And set in heaven's third storey,
<lb>I look on all things as they are,
<lb>But through a kind of glory."


<div1 type="entry"><head>ST. PAUL'S</>

<p>The view given of <placename>St. Paul's</> from <placename>Fleet Street</> will strike
many as unfamiliar. It is not the view they know, when the
traffic is a raging torrent and the cathedral is drowsing in the
afternoon sun; but perhaps this is not less characteristic to those
who have seen it in the grey of the dawn-the most historic
street in the world for the English-speaking race. Every time
you walk that way, on everyday cares intent, you take your part
in a pageant that has gone on for two thousand years ; so many,
that great part of the performers are forgotten and are no
more than the dust of the highway; but this is sure-your
fellow-actors have included every King and Queen of England,
from first to last, and many from foreign lands-Roman
legionaries, crusaders, nobles, prelates, men of deeds, men of
words, men of letters, and men of visions; almost every man
and woman who has made a mark in the crowded pages of
English history-high-born and lowly, all doing their little
part in the day's work, just as you are; and so, home.
