<HEAD>Pie-Powder, otherwise Pied-Poudre Court.<NOTE N="*"><P>In p. <num value="32">32</num>, vol. iii. of Blackstone's Commentaries, he says, &ldquo;The lowest, and, at the same time, the most expeditious court of justice known to the law of England, is the court of Pie-poudre, <foreign lang=la>curia pedis pulverizati</foreign>, so called from the dusty feet of the suitors;&rdquo; or, according to Sir Edward Coke, &ldquo;because justice is there done as speedily as dust can fall from the foot.&rdquo; Upon the same principle that justice among the Jews was administered at the gates of the city, that the proceedings might be more speedy as well as public. But by a learned modern writer, it derived its name from &ldquo;pied puldreaux,&rdquo; a pedlar, in old French, and, therefore, signifying the court of such petty chapmen as resort to fairs or markets: the proceedings of the court being <hi rend=italics>de hora in horam.</hi>

<P>Jenkins, <num value="132">132</num>, pl. <num value="70">70</num>, says, &ldquo;The court is called, <hi rend=italics>curia pedis pulverizati</hi>, because of the confluence of people, who, by their motion, raise <hi rend=italics>pulverem vel lutum.</hi>&rdquo;</NOTE></HEAD>

<p><figure id="fig.2.illus.list" n="2000.66.0001"><head>Pye Powder Court, Cloth Fair, West Smithfield</head></figure> 
<P>If we were to trace the origin of this court, we should be obliged to explore very remote authority; we might resort to Sacred Writ, and produce many instances of the judges administering justice in the gate, or without the City, where their decisions were summary and effective. It is not improbable such an open situation was preferred, that the administration of justice might be as public as possible. 
<P>There can be no doubt, but that the Greeks, and Romans, from the same motives, decided causes in the Areopagus, the Forum, &amp;c. 
<P>The Britons had also their places of judicature in the open air, where the judges presided to minister 
<hi rend=italics>whilst the dust was on the feet.</hi>

<P>The Saxons, in imitation of their German ancestors, appointed <num value="12">twelve</num> of the most eminent and grave men, to ride different circuits, that justice might not be impeded to the meanest individual. Hence arose justices itinerant. 
<P>Stowe writes, that &ldquo;opposite the Bishop of Coventry's Inn, in the High Street (the Strand), stood a stone cross, where in the year <datestruct value="1294"><year reg="1294">1294</year></datestruct>, and divers other times, the justices itinerant sat without London.&rdquo; 
<P>Having glanced at the origin of courts of justice, it will be necessary to remark, that when luxury introduced covered places for deciding causes, the court of Pie-powder lost its ancient consequence, and, from being a court of general judicature, it diminished, though still maintaining its right, into a court of record for the speedy and sudden dispatch of differences arising in markets and fairs, for the sole benefit of merchants and tradesmen; for determining also all doubts and questions then and there arising, respecting sales and contracts made within, and during the time for which the market or fair is held, and not for matters arising out of the market or fair, or done before, or at any time after; but for causes happening and arising <hi rend=italics>in pleno mercato</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>in plena feria</hi>, agreeably to the act of parliment passed in the <num value="8">eighth</num> year of the reign of king Henry VII. and <num value="17">seventeenth</num> of Edward IV. cap. ii. <datestruct value="1477--"><year reg="1477">1477</year></datestruct>. 
<P>A court of Pie-powder is of <num value="2">two</num> kinds; <num value="1">first</num>, either prescriptive, and an absolute jurisdiction; or, secondly, to be in a market or fair; and to this, a court of Pie-powder is incident. 
<P>In the latter, <num value="2">two</num> things are requisite: <num value="1">first</num>, this court is to be for matters arising in the market or fair: secondly, the cases to be determined in the court within, and during the continuance of the market or fair; and this practice is, when the court is annexed to such market or fair. It is, however, very different in a Pie-powder court by prescription, because there, causes, both before and after, may be heard and determined. 
<P>It cannot be irrelevant to our subject to state that a court, by prescription, may be held without any fair, from time to time, and from day to day. It was adjudged, <num value="13">13</num> Edward IV. in point of a writ of error, where the error was assigned to reverse a judgment given <hi rend=italics>in curia pedis pulverizati</hi>, there alleged to be held <hi rend=italics>secundum consuetudinem ejusdem civitatis.</hi> The error insisted upon was, &ldquo;because it did not show, that the matter upon which the action was brought, was <hi rend=italics>in pleno mercato</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>in plena feria.</hi>&rdquo; It was considered as no error, because the court was held <hi rend=italics>according to the custom of the city.</hi> This proves that a Pie-powder court may be held, without either fair or market;<NOTE N="*"><P>See Act of <num value="17">17</num> of Edward IV. cap. <num value="2">2</num>; whereby it is enacted, &ldquo;that from the <datestruct VALUE="-05-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> day of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct> next ensuing, no steward, under-steward, bailiff, nor commissary, nor any other minister of any such courts of Pie-powder, shall hold plea, upon any action, at the suit of any person or persons, unless the plaintiff or plaintiffs, or his or their attorney, in the presence of the defendant or defendants, do swear upon the Holy Evangelists, upon the declaration, that the contract or other deed contained in the said declaration, was made or committed within the fair, and within the time of the fair where he taketh his said action, and within the jurisdiction and bounds of the same fair.&rdquo;</NOTE> and the king may, with propriety, grant such a court to be held from day to day. A court of this kind may also be held <hi rend=italics>by custom</hi>, without any fair or market; and its proper denomination being <hi rend=italics>for the speedy dispatch of business, as quick as the dust falls from the feet</hi>, its jurisdiction, as held by prescription, may be extended to all contracts, bonds, actions of trespass upon the case, &amp;c. 
<P>The difference between the <num value="2">two</num> courts of Pie-powder is thus defined: &ldquo;If any person declares upon an injury received in a fair before this court, in such case there is a necessity that he ought to set forth, &lsquo;that the injury was sustained in full fair or market;&rsquo; otherwise the plea is not good. Such is not the case in the court held by prescription; that court may hear and determine actions upon the case for words, which cannot be done in the ordinary court, during the fair.&rdquo; 
<P>The court of Pie-powder cannot take cognizance of any words that do not concern any matter touching the market; but if <num value="1">one</num> person slanders another respecting his trade or merchandise in the market, in that case the cause is cognizable by the court. 
<P>In this court the steward is sole judge, for there are no suitors; therefore, as no writ of false judgment can lie, it must be a writ of error; and where the claim is to hold this court by prescription, and also by charter, if the charter be not contrary to the prescription, this shall be held good as a confirmation <pb id="p.2" n="2"> 
<P>In this court, no steward or other minister shall hold a plea upon an action, at the suit of any person, unless the plaintiff, or his attorney, in the presence of the detendant, do swear, &ldquo;that the contract in the declaration, &amp;c. was had and made during the time of the fair, and within the jurisdiction of the fair.&rdquo; 
<P>The steward in this court being the sole judge, can have no deputy; because, as before, there are no suitors. The trial is by merchants and traders in the fair, and the judgment against the defendant shall be what the court adjudges by the way of amercement. 
<P>Having thus given an abstract of the history and the practice of the Pie-powder Court, we shall subjoin a brief description of that annually held during Bartholomew Fair, in West Smithfield. 
<P>After Rahere, in the reign of Henry I. had founded the priory of St. Bartholomew, he contracted many enemies, whose rancour was so venomous, that they conspired to take away his life; the plot was discovered to Rahere by <num value="1">one</num> of the conspirators, in time for him to apply to his sovereign for protection. The monarch not only granted that protection, but, to evince his good opinion of the persecuted prior, he granted to Rahere the prior, the canons of the church, and to the poor of the hospital, great privileges and immunities; and, among other, a fair at Bartholomew-tide for <num value="3">three</num> days: the eve of the feast of St. Bartholomew, St. Bartholomew's day, and the day following. This charter was granted in the year <datestruct value="1133"><year reg="1133">1133</year></datestruct>, and confirmed by succeeding sovereigns. 
<P>To this fair the clothiers and drapers of London, and other parts of England, constantly repaired to dispose of their commodities, and they exposed them on booths and standings in the churchyard within the priory, which, with its precincts, was enclosed on all sides by a strong wall, and gates which were locked and watched every night; the south part contained a large cemetery, with a spacious court or yard, now denominated Bartholomew Close, in which the fair was formerly held; the north and east sides of the convent were occupied by the priory garden; but when, upon the increase of inhabitants, after the dissolution of the priory those precincts and the garden were converted into streets, the fair<NOTE N="*"><P>The narrow street on the north side of the church received its denomination, <hi rend=italics>Cloth Fair</hi>, from this circumstance.</NOTE> was removed into the more open space of Smithfield. Part of the beautiful cloister still remains on the south side; but it is degraded by being converted into livery stables for horses. 
<P>Edward IV. in the <num value="2">second</num> year of his reign, by a beneficial charter to the city of London, granted, among other things, &ldquo;that a fair might be held for <num value="3">three</num> days in the year, viz. the <num value="7">7th</num>, <num value="8">8th</num>, and <num value="9">9th</num> days of September; and that they might, from time to time, have a court of Pie-powder, with all summons, attachments, &amp;c. belonging to the same; also that they might have a view of frankpledge, with all that thereunto appertaineth, &amp;c.&rdquo; 
<P>King Henry VIII. by letters patent, gave and granted to Sir Richard Rich, Knight, his heirs and assigns for ever (among divers other lands and hereditaments), the site and capital messuage and mansionhouse of the late monastery or priory of St. Bartholomew in West Smithfield, in the suburbs of the city of London, then dissolved; and also the close of the said late monastery or priory, called Great St. Bartholomew Close, and all the limits and precincts of the said close; also all those closes, houses, and edifices, called the fermary, the dorter, the brother, the cloisters, the galleries, the hall, the kitchen, the buttery, the pantry, the old kitchen, the wood-house, the garnor, and the prior's stable, of the said late monastery within the churchyard; and all those houses, edifices, curtilages, gardens, void grounds, land and soil whatever, within the said Close of the said site of the late monastery or priory belonging; and also all that water, and the aqueduct and water-course, coming and running from a certain place called the Conduit Head of St. Bartholomew, within the manor of Canbery, in the parish of Islington, in the county of Middlesex, unto and in the said site and close of the said late monastery or priory of St. Bartholomew; and all the cisterns and pipes of lead in which, and through which, the same water and watercourse was carried and led; and the chief and principal origin and spring of the same water in Islington aforesaid, unto and in the said site of the said late monastery and priory, with liberty to cleanse and amend the same.&rdquo; 
<P>And by the said letters patent, His said Majesty further gave and granted unto the said Sir Richard Rich, Knight, his heirs and assigns, &ldquo;all that <hi rend=italics>our</hi> fair and markets commonly named and called Bartholomew Fair, holden and to be holden every year within the aforesaid Close called Great St. Bartholomew Close, and in West Smithfield aforesaid, to continue yearly for <num value="3">three</num> days, viz. on the eve of the day of St. Bartholomew the Apostle, and on the day of St. Bartholomew the Apostle, and on the morrow of the same day of St. Bartholomew the Apostle; and also all the stallage, piccage, toll, and customs of the same fair and markets; and also all our courts of Pie-powder within the fair and markets aforesaid holden and to be holden every year, at the time of the same fair and markets; and all our rights, jurisdictions, authorities, privileges, offices, commodities, profits, and emoluments whatever, of such court of Pie-powder, or in any wise belonging, appertaining, incumbent, or appurtenant: and also all the scrutiny, amendment, and correction of weights and measures whatsoever, in the fair and markets aforesaid, at the time of the same fair and markets, every year occupied and to be occupied; and also the scrutiny of other things whatsoever, exposed to sale in the fair and markets aforesaid, at the time of the same fair and markets; and also the assize and assay, and the amendment and correction of bread, wine, and ale, and other victuals whatsoever, in the fair and markets aforesaid, at the time of the same fair and markets, exposed to sale; and all and singular fines, amerciaments, forfeitures, issues and profits, and other rights, commodities, and emoluments whatever, within the said fair and markets, and of and in the aforesaid court of Pie-powder, and of the stallage, and piccage, and scrutinies aforesaid, from time to time happening, coming, arising, or growing; and also all other rights, jurisdictions, privileges, franchises, liberties, free customs, offices, authorities, exemptions, acquittances, commodities, profits, and emoluments whatsoever, to the said fair and markets in any wise belonging or appertaining, or by reason or pretence of the same fair and markets <pb id="p.3" n="3"> heretofore being enjoyed or used, as fully, freely, and entirely, and in as ample and the like manner and form as William Bolton, formerly prior of the said late monastery or priory of St. Bartholomew, or any or either of his predecessors, priors of the same late monastery or priory, in right of the same late monastery or priory, at any time before the dissolution of the same late monastery or priory, or before the same late monastery or priory came to our hands, have or hath held or enjoyed, or in any wise ought to have, hold, and enjoy, such markets and fair, and stallage, piccage, tolls, customs, courts of Pie-powder, scrutiny, assize, assay, amendment, correction, fines, amerciaments, forfeitures, privileges, franchises, liberties, free customs, offices, authorities, exemptions, exonerations, acquittances, commodities, profits, and emoluments, in the aforesaid Close called Great St. Bartholomew Close, and in West Smithfield aforesaid, or in either of them, by reason or pretext of any charter, gift, grant or confirmation, or of any charters, or letters patent, or confirmations, by us or any or either of our progenitors, kings of England, to the aforesaid William Bolton, formerly prior of the said late monastery or priory of St. Bartholomew, or any or either of his predecessors, priors of the same late monastery or priory, and the convent of the same late monastery or priory, in any wise made, or granted, or confirmed, or by reason or pretext of any prescription or custom heretofore had or used, or otherwise, by whatsoever means, and as fully, and entirely, and freely as all and singular the premises came to our hands by reason or pretext of the dissolution of the said late monastery or priory of St. Bartholomew, or by reason or pretext of any charter, or grant, gift, confirmation under the conventual seal of the said late monastery or priory, or otherwise to us in any wise made of the fair aforesaid, and other the premises, or by reason or pretext of any act of Parliment, or in whatsoever other manner, right, or title, have come, or ought to come, and in our hands now are, or ought to be.&rdquo; 
<P>It appears by the above charter that there were <num value="2">two</num> fairs: <num value="1">one</num> for the priory, and <num value="1">one</num> for the city; and it is very probable, that, at the dissolution of the priory, the fairs were consolidated<NOTE N="*"><P>We are inclined to think that the <num value="2">two</num> fairs were consolidated by mutual agreement between the mayor and commonalty of the city of London, and the prior of the monastery; and that about the <num value="32">32</num>d of King Henry VI. <datestruct value="1454--"><year reg="1454">1454</year></datestruct>, an agreement was entered into between those parties, that the stallage and piccage gathered and taken in certain parts of West Smithfield, should be appropriated to the mayor and commonalty, and the stallage and piccage gathered and taken within the close of St. Bartholomew, and certain other places, should be taken by the prior.</NOTE> under the city of London <hi rend=italics>and the lord of the domains of the late priory</hi>,<NOTE N="*"><P>It does not appear that the priory was ever part of, or within, or held of the lord of any <hi rend=italics>manor.</hi> From the most ancient records it is said to have been called the Monastery or Priory of St. Bartholomew.</NOTE> which domain was taken into the city jurisdiction from the following circumstance: 
<P>On the <datestruct VALUE="1606-07-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month> <year reg="1606">1606</year></datestruct>, James I. dined at Merchant Taylors' Hall; on which occasion his eldest son, Prince Henry, was made free of that company. On that day, the King discharged a debt of <num value="60000">60,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>
contracted with the citizens by Queen Elizabeth, <num value="3">three</num> years before her death; the payment of which obtained King James more love than the value of the money. In the May following, he applied for, and received another loan of <num value="63000">63,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> from them. And in order to confirm the citizens of London in their love and affection for him, His Majesty granted them an advantageous charter: by which he was pleased to confirm all their ancient rights, liberties, and immunities, and added to their jurisdiction the precincts of Duke's Place, St. Bartholomew the Great and Less, Black and White Friars, and Cold Harbour. 
<P>Charles I. granted Moorfields and West Smithfield to the city of London, with liberty to hold fairs and markets in the said fields, with all tolls, profits, &amp;c. thereunto belonging. To which grant is added this particular clause: &ldquo;We, our heirs or successors, <hi rend=italics>will not erect, or cause to be erected, nor will permit or give leave to any person or persons to erect and build a new <num value="1">one</num>, or any messuages, houses, structures, edifices, in or upon the said field called</hi> Inner Moor, <hi rend=italics>or the field called</hi> Outward Moor, <hi rend=italics>or the said field called</hi> West Smithfield; <hi rend=italics>but that the said separate fields and places be reserved, disposed, and continued, to such-like common and public uses, as the same fields heretofore and now are used, disposed or converted, to</hi> (saving nevertheless and always reserving to us, our heirs and successors, all streets, lanes, and alleys and now waste and void ground and places, as they are now within the city and liberties of the same), to hold and enjoy the said messuages, houses, edifices, court-yards, and all and singular the premises granted or confirmed, or mentioned to be granted or confirmed, with all their appurtenances (except before excepted), to the said mayor and commonalty and citizens of the said city, and their successors for ever; to hold in fee and common burgage,<NOTE N="*"><P>A tenure by which lands are held of the king, or some lord, for annual rent.</NOTE> and not in capite,<NOTE N="*"><P>A tenure by which a person held of the king immediately, as of his crown, either by knight's service or soccage, and not of any honour, castle, or manor, belonging to it. By a statute of <num value="12">12</num> Charles II. all such tenures are abolished.</NOTE> or by knight's service.&rdquo; 
<P>After this period, and when luxury obtained ample dominion in the reign of Charles II. the lower classes of people, apeing the manners of their superiors, were involved in the vortex of sensuality and inordinate appetites; it is not to be wondered at, therefore, that the vulgar drama kept pace with the more polite, or that Bartholomew fair should extend its vagaries from <num value="3">three</num> days to a fortnight. 
<P>It became, at length, little more than a snare for idle youth and disorderly persons, and an annual scene of impiety, debauchery, and riot, till the year <datestruct value="1708"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, when the lord mayor, aldermen, and common council of London, after many previous efforts, succeeded in reducing the period of holding the fair to its former limit of <num value="3">three</num> days, and at a court held in the month of June during that year, the order was confirmed: the regulation for holding of the fair, though sometimes encroached upon, has continued to the present time. 
<P>The fair, from the time above stated, <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, seems always to have been a scene of great confusion and riot; and the sports and pastimes which have been practised in the fair, from the above time, have, at different periods, been more or less vicious; but, at present, it is more free from complaint than it used to be, as gaming formed a chief part of the amusements of the fair: particularly in the year <datestruct value="1719"><year reg="1719">1719</year></datestruct>; there being at the fair held in that year, not less than <num value="20">twenty</num> licensed dice and hazard tables permitted. <pb id="p.4" n="4"> 
<P>The amusement which the steward of the court granted licenses to people to exhibit in the fair, consisted of flying chairs, flying horses, puppet-shows, drolls, marble-boards, couler-boards, dice, hazard, and rowley-powley. 
<P>About the year <datestruct value="1730"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>, dice and hazard tables seem to have been prohibited, and those tables destroyed by the officers of the court. A few wild, or foreign animals, were then exhibited, and rope-dancing was also introduced. 
<P>About <datestruct value="1735--"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>, the up-and-downs commenced. 
<P>In the year <datestruct value="1756"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>, the noted Flocton, the showman, made his appearance in the fair, as an exhibitor of a show called the Venetian Carnival. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1757--"><year reg="1757">1757</year></datestruct>, dexterity of horsemanship took place; and from that period, puppet-shows, pantomimes, wild beasts, dexterity of hand, and the imitation of theatrical performances, appear to have been the current amusements; but of late, for about <num value="20">twenty</num> years back, theatrical performances have been introduced, and are now exhibited with no little degree of splendour. 
<P>We cannot close this article without noticing the wise regulations adopted in <datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, during the mayoralty of Sir James Shaw, Bart. It was proved by those regulations, that the usual shows and entertainments might be enjoyed by such as choose to resort to such places, without indecorum towards their persons, or injury to their property. Similar regulations should certainly claim the utmost attention of the magistracy, when the public safety is considered, and when it is considered also, what a vast revenue this fair produces to the city chamber. 
<P>The court of Pie-powder for Bartholomew fair has, for many years past, been held at at a public-house called the Hand and Shears, the corner of Middle Street, Cloth Fair; and it appears by the Lex Londinensis, and other ancient books, treating on the charter and liberties of London, that the <num value="2">two</num> eldest clerks in the sheriffs' court are attorneys in this court<NOTE N="*"><P>The judge of the court is the steward, for the time being, of the Right Honourable William Lord Kensington, who is a descendant of the family of Sir Richard Rich, Knight: to whom the grant of the dissolved monastery or priory of St. Bartholomew the Great, and the said market or fair, was made by King Henry VIII. The fair is usually proclaimed, by the steward or officer of his Lordship, at <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock, on the eve of St. Bartholomew (old style); and upon that occasion, he is attended by a rabble of disorderly persons called Lady Holland's mob, who, under the colour of greeting the return of the annual fair, commit many wanton excesses. 
<P>The other officers of the court are: an associate, who, it is believed, was formerly the common serjeant of the city of London, or <num value="1">one</num> of the attorneys of the mayor's or sheriff's court; but no associate has attended for many years;<NOTE N="*"><P>The records of the court, for nearly a century past, have been searched; but it does not appear that any officer, either from the sheriff's court, or mayor's court, has attended.</NOTE> <num value="6">six</num> serjeants at mace: <num value="2">two</num> for the lord mayor, <num value="2">two</num> for the Poultry Compter, <num value="2">two</num> for Giltspur Street Compter, and a constable appointed by the steward of Lord Kensington to attend the court.</NOTE> for examining and trying all suits brought for petty matters and offences committed in the fair either by the traders who vend their goods, by the drolls who exhibit their antics for the amusement of the vulgar, or by those who keep repositories for wild beasts, &amp;c. as well as such who obtain the money of the thoughtless by means of games of chance, or such as infringe the following proclamation, delivered within the entrance into Cloth Fair, annually, before the lord mayor, or his principal officer: 
<emph><hi rend=italics>The Proclamation made on Bartholomew Eve (now the <num value="3">third</num> Day of September), by the Lord Mayor, at the great Gate going into Cloth Fair.</hi></emph>

<P>&ldquo;The Right Honourable &mdash;, Lord Mayor of the city of London, and his right worshipful brethren the aldermen of the said city, straitly charge and command, on the behalf of our Sovereign Lord the King, that all manner of persons, of whatsoever estate, degree, or condition they be, having recourse to this fair, keep the peace of our Sovereign Lord the King. 
<P>&ldquo;That no manner of persons make any congregation, conventicles, or affrays, by the which the same peace may be broke or disturbed, upon pain of inprisonment and fine, to be made after the discretion of the lord mayor and aldermen. 
<P>&ldquo;Also, that all manner of sellers of wine, ale, or beer, sell not by measures unsealed, as by gallon, pottle, quart, and pint, upon pain that will fall thereof. 
<P>&ldquo;And that no person shall sell any bread, except it keep the assize; and that it be good and wholesome for man's body, upon pain that will follow thereof. 
<P>&ldquo;And that no manner of cook, pie-baker, nor huckster, sell or put to sale any manner of victual, except it be good and wholesome for man's body, upon pain that will fall thereof. 
<P>&ldquo;And that no manner of person buy nor sell, but with true weights and measures, sealed accordin to the statute in that behalf made, upon pain that will fall thereof.

<P>SOME circumstances which attend the presentation of the Sheriffs of London to the Court of the Exchequer, by which their election is confirmed, have in our day such an air of singularity, that it cannot be deemed impertinent to give some explanation of the very ancient practices to which we allude. The whole ceremony indeed (for a mere ceremony it has long been) originated in facts of so much importance in the municipal history of the metropolis, nay, even of the country, that we may be held excused for going yet farther&mdash;for endeavouring to trace it to the motives under which it was <num value="1">first</num> ordained; to show its immediate connexion with the stupendous system which governed our early ancestors; and to rescue it's serious character and intention from the silly conceits and gross errors of vulgar misapprehension. 
<P>Sheriffs, in common with the most of other public officers, were, previously to the Norman Conquest, elected by the people, and possessed within the spheres of their several jurisdictions an independent authority. Soon after that great event, the Crown assumed and exercised the power of appointing them, since nominally moderated by statutes which restored the old form of election, subject to the royal approbation. They became now, in many respects, the representatives of royalty in their respective districts: to them were intrusted the most ample, indeed almost discretionary, means of opposing all tumultuous assemblies, for the maintenance, according to the emphatic language of the law, of the King's peace: they were the instruments, under the immediate authority of the Crown, of embodying and arming, by a summary process, the military force of the whole kingdom. Amongst these, and many others of their high faculties, they formed the chief medium between the King and his subjects as to such of his land revenues as were derived from the several districts, or municipal bodies, which were committed to their charge: they had the power of compelling, in the King's name, the payment to them of such royal droits; and they were accountable for them to the Exchequer, by the authority of whose court, instituted by William the Conqueror, and it's powers and duties with more precision defined by Edward I. for the especial conservation of the King's revenues, they were aided or controuled as occasions might require. Of this connexion of the Sheriffs of England in general with the Court, as well as with the receipt of the Exchequer, we are enabled to draw the strongest inferences from many detached records, perhaps too far separated from each other to form a chain of proof sufficiently regular to satisfy the highly scrupulous antiquary; but that the Sheriffs of London in particular bore such relation, we have the strongest possible evidence. 
<P>&ldquo;The Sheriffs of London,&rdquo; to use the words of an excellent and most rare little treatise on the ancient customs of London, printed in <datestruct value="1656--"><year reg="1656">1656</year></datestruct>, &ldquo;pay, and are accountable yearly to the Exchequer of our Lord the King, for the farm of the said city, and of the county of Middlesex, according to the form of their charter, by occasion of which farm the said Sheriffs ought to have the ancient prizes and customs of the merchandises coming within the said city, and going out, and forfeitures, fines, and amerciaments, and all other commodities of ancient time belonging to their said offices,&rdquo; &amp;c. <pb id="p.6" n="6"> 
<P>This passage is explained by the charter granted to the City by Henry the <num value="1">First</num>, by which he demised the county of Middlesex to his citizens of London, &ldquo;by farm, for <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">three hundred</num> pounds</measure> upon account, to them and their heirs, so as the said citizens of London shall appoint a Sheriff, whom they please, of themselves, and a Justice to hold the pleas of his crown, which are to be pleaded for the same.&rdquo; And <num value="1">one</num> of the charters of King John, in his <num value="1">first</num> year, grants to the citizens of London, &ldquo;the Sheriffwick of Middlesex, with all things and customs appertaining, within the city and without, paying yearly to the King and his heirs <num value="300">300</num><hi rend=italics>l. sterling blades</hi>, at the Exchequer; the <num value="1">one</num> moiety at Easter, the other at Michaelmas;&rdquo; and allows that the citizens may &ldquo;of themselves make Sheriffs whom they will, and remove them when they please;&rdquo; and &ldquo;that they present those whom they make Sheriffs to our Justices, who may answer to us, as our Barons of the Exchequer, for the things belonging to the said Sheriffwicks, of which they ought to answer to us; and if they do not fully answer and satisfy, the citizens of London are to answer and satisfy of the amerciament of the farm,&rdquo; &amp;c. This latter charter concludes&mdash; &ldquo;of that which belongs to the Sheriffwick the Sheriffs shall answer in our Exchequer, before our Barons, saving to the said Sheriffs the liberties which other citizens of London have.&rdquo; 
<P>The terms of the charters, by a sort of complaisance, as it should seem, to the city, scarcely afford any ground even for inference of the invariable fact, that the election of Sheriffs could be of no effect till it had been sanctioned by the royal approbation. It was, however, to obtain that ratification of their choice that the citizens were commanded to present those whom they had elected to the King, represented by the Barons of his Exchequer, by whom they were fully admitted to their offices, on their taking an oath of fidelity, &ldquo;ad respondendum Domino Regi ad Scaccarium pro civitate;&rdquo; or &ldquo;ad faciendum pr&aelig;ceptum Regis;&rdquo; or &ldquo;ad faciendum Domino Regi quod alii Vicecomites facere debent,&rdquo; &amp;c.; for the form of the oath, though tending always to the same point, frequently varied in its terms. Thus the Sheriffs became servants of the Crown, and it was in that character, and not as municipal officers, that they were qualified to receive and to pay the rent, by which the citizens of London, as we have just now seen, farmed that city and the county of Middlesex of the King, as tenants <hi rend=italics>in capite;</hi> as well as other rents, some few of which we shall presently have particular occasion to notice. 
<P>The correctness of this statement is further proved by the struggles of the citizens themselves to wrest the election from the Crown. In the <num value="27">27th</num> year of King Edward the <num value="1">First</num>, Philip le Taylur was fined <num value="50">50</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> for refusing to come to the Exchequer, at the King's command; and in the <num value="9">ninth</num> of Edward the <num value="2">Second</num>, when the Mayor, Aldermen, and other citizens presented Hamon Godchep and William de Buddele, whom they had elected Sheriffs, and the Treasurer and Barons of the Exchequer called on them to take the usual oath, the citizens alleged that &ldquo;the said Hamon and William, or others whom they might elect to the office of Sheriff, were not bound, nor ought, to take any oath relative to the discharge of it, except before the Mayor and Aldermen of their city; and prayed that those <num value="2">two</num> persons whom they then presented might be admitted to the said office on their presentation, as had been formerly accustomed.&rdquo; But they were answered, that &ldquo;although it belonged to the citizens, by their charters, to choose or make Sheriffs of London and Middlesex, and to present them at the Exchequer, yet the persons whom they might so choose were not thereby exempt from taking the oath required, unless special exemption in that behalf were granted by the King.&rdquo; The citizens <pb id="p.7" n="7"> therefore were told by the Treasurer and Barons, that &ldquo;unless the said Hamon and William should take the oath in question, they the Treasurer and Barons (although they did not thereby make void or impeach the election) could by no means accept or admit those persons; for that if the said persons would execute <hi rend=italics>an office under the King, such as the office of Sheriff</hi>, before they had been sworn thereto in the Exchequer, it would be at their peril.&rdquo; Similar demands on the part of the citizens were frequently repeated, and as often rejected. 
<P>The city of London and county of Middlesex then, or, as the <num value="2">two</num> united were frequently called, the Sheriffwick of Middlesex, were, as we have seen, held of the Crown by the citizens, under the charter of Henry the <num value="1">First</num>, at the yearly rent of <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">three hundred</num> pounds</measure>. That rent appears to have been, from time to time, raised. We find in the <num value="2">second</num> charter granted by King John, the substance of which, so far as it relates to our subject, has been before stated, that the annual payment required by that Prince was <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">three hundred</num> pounds</measure> <hi rend=italics>sterling blades;</hi> an obscure and obsolete phrase, which is explained by an Exchequer record of the <num value="55">fifty-fifth</num> of Henry the <num value="3">Third</num>, by which we are informed, that when Henry de Waleys and Gregory de Rokesle, elected Sheriffs for that year, were presented by the Mayor and citizens, they were sworn, among other duties of their office, to account to the King for <measure value="315l." type=currency><num value="315">three hundred and fifteen</num> pounds</measure>, the old farm or rent (&ldquo;quod pr&aelig;dicti Vicecomites respondebunt Regi de cccxvl. de veteri ferma&rdquo;), and so in these &ldquo;pounds 
<hi rend=italics>sterling blades</hi>&rdquo; we find the <num value="1">first</num> rudiments of our guineas of modern times. The citizens, on their part, at the same time answered to the King for <measure value="85l." type=currency><num value="85">eighty-five</num> pounds</measure>, <hi rend=italics>a new payment</hi>, according to the words of the record (et pr&aelig;dicti cives respondebunt Regi de quater xx&mdash;v<hi rend=sup>l</hi>, de novo cremento), and the line of distinction here drawn seems clearly to point at the peculiar province of the Sheriffs with regard to the King's revenue; for while they were bound to receive on his behalf, and to pay into his Exchequer, the rent specially reserved to the King, as supreme feudal lord, by the royal charter or charters granted to the city, the citizens themselves appear to have been responsible, probably by their Mayor, for dues of a meaner nature. The <foreign lang=la>novum crementum</foreign>, therefore, of <measure value="85l." type=currency><num value="85">eighty-five</num> pounds</measure>, mentioned in the record in question, was perhaps some source of ordinary revenue, lately opened, for the payment of which the citizens pledged themselves, at the same time that the Sheriffs were sworn to their performance of their separate duty, and which therefore happens to be referred to in the same record. 
<P>The rent, however, for the Sheriffwick returned, at what precise time we know not, to its ancient rate of <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">three hundred</num> pounds</measure>; which, together with <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> pounds</measure> for Queenhithe, and <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure> for the borough of Southwark, constituted, as it should seem, all the annual rents, in money, for which the corporation as 
<hi rend=italics>tenant in capite</hi>, was accountable, through its Sheriffs, to the Crown; but we find scattered records of other rents, which it was their duty to receive, and to pay, so small indeed in value, that they can be considered but as merely nominal, but precisely of the same character, as arising from the same kind of tenure. Of <num value="2">two</num> of these the recollection is so remarkably preserved in the ceremonies of which we shall presently speak, that it will be proper to give here a detailed account of them. 
<P>We find in the records of the Court of Exchequer, that Henry the <num value="3">Third</num> granted to Walter le Brun, a farrier in the Strand, a piece of land there, that he might build a forge thereon, at the yearly rent of <num value="6">six</num> horse-shoes: &ldquo;Walter le Brun, mareschallus de Stranda, reddit compotum de sex ferris equorum, pro habenda <pb id="p.8" n="8"> quadam placea in parochia Sti. Clementis, ad fabricam ibidem locandam,&rdquo; <hi rend=italics>(Mag. Rot.</hi> <num value="19">19</num> <hi rend=italics>Hen. III.);</hi> and in the <num value="1">first</num> year of Edward the <num value="1">First</num>, a recognition of that grant is recorded, by which it appears that the said Walter, or perhaps his son, &ldquo;a farrier at the Stone cross,&rdquo; rendered <num value="6">six</num> horse-shoes, with their nails, for a certain forge, which he held of the King <hi rend=italics>in capite</hi> (&ldquo;Middlesex Redditus&mdash;Walter, Mareschallus, ad crucem lapideam, reddit sex ferra equorum, cum clavibus, pro quadam fabrica quam de Rege tenet in capite, ex opposito crucis lapide&aelig;&rdquo;); and it is observable, though not immediately to our purpose, that in some of the early plans of the city of London and its environs, a large plot of ground, between the Strand and the river, west of Essex Street, is distinguished by the appellation of &ldquo;The Forge.&rdquo; 
<P>Nicholas de Mora held of the Crown, <hi rend=italics>in capite</hi>, certain lands in Shropshire, called the More, at the whimsical yearly rent of <num value="2">two</num> knives, the <num value="1">one</num> good, the other very bad, (&ldquo;Salopsire&mdash;Nicholaus de Mora reddit ad Scaccarium duos cultellos, unum bonum, et alterum pessimum, pro quadam terra quam de Rege tenet <hi rend=italics>in capite</hi>, in Mora&rdquo;&mdash;(<hi rend=italics>Mich. Commun.</hi> <num value="29">29</num> <hi rend=italics>Hen. III.&mdash;Rot.</hi> <num value="1">1</num>.) 
<P>Both these estates became the property of the city of London. When it acquired &ldquo;The Forge,&rdquo; we know not; but it seems that in the reign of Henry the <num value="8">Eighth</num>, license was granted to John Adams, and others, to alienate certain lands in the county of Salop, called &ldquo;The More,&rdquo; to John Heweson, mercer and citizen of London, and to &mdash; Gresham; and of the heirs of those persons it was probably purchased by the corporation. The service to be annually rendered for it is thus stated in that grant of Henry the <num value="8">Eighth</num>, somewhat more fully than in the original record&mdash; 
<P>&ldquo;<num value="2">Two</num> culters, or knives, <num value="1">one</num> of such strength as to be able to cut a stick of a cubit's length, and the other not strong enough to cut the same; the good culter to cut the stick at the <num value="1">first</num> cut through the middle: which service is to be performed in the middle of the Exchequer, before the Treasurer and Barons, every year, on the morrow of St. Michael.&rdquo; 
<P>Thus the Sheriffs of London were the King's receivers of all such rents as became due to him from the incorporated citizens, as his tenants <hi rend=italics>in capite;</hi> and it was chiefly to the just performance of their duties in that respect that they bound themselves by the oath exacted from them on their admission to this office. The citizens, however, either from a jealousy of the primary interference of the Crown, or from a generous desire to become the purely voluntary ministers of their own constant fidelity towards it, having long striven, as we have seen, to procure the abrogation of the oath in question, finally succeeded; and Edward the <num value="3">Third</num>, by his charter, ordained that the Sheriffs should not, in future, be compelled to take any oath at the Exchequer, except on the delivery of their account. That oath, however, differs nothing in substance from the former, the only distinction between them being, that the <num value="1">one</num> refers prospectively, the other in retrospect, to the duties which the Sheriffs are to perform. The latter, which we may presume to have remained unaltered from the date of the charter last mentioned, is in the following terms: 
<P>&ldquo;You, A. B. and C. D. Esquires, shall swear that you shall yield unto his Majesty King a true account of your office of Sheriffwick in the city of London and county of Middlesex, due to his Majesty from the Feast of St. Michael the Archangel, in the year of his said Majesty's reign, until the Feast of St. Michael the Archangel then <pb id="p.9" n="9"> next following, in the year of his said Majesty's reign, that is to say, for <num value="1">one</num> whole year. And in the same account you shall charge yourselves with all such sum and sums of money as you or any of your bailiffs, officers, or ministers, for you, have levied, or lawfully might have levied, to his Majesty's use. You shall also true answer make of all felons' goods; outlawed or attainted men's goods; waifes, estrays, deodands, or other profits of the like nature due to his Majesty, by virtue of your office of Sheriffwick, or by virtue of his Majesty's prerogative royal, which have come to your hands, your under-sheriff's hands, or any of your bailiffs', officers', or ministers' hands. You shall also true answer make to all summons of the Pipe and Green Wax; and you shall deliver into this Court of Exchequer a book, fairly written on parchment, declaring where, and of whom, his Majesty is to be answered the Vicontiels written forth to you in the said summons of the Pipe. And in the same account you shall vouch no franchise or liberty, nor make any petition, nor crave any allowance or discharge, but such as shall be just and true; and well and truly you shall behave yourselves in yielding the same account, as true and just accomptants ought to do, without omission or concealment. So help you GOD.&rdquo; 
<P>Having premised these historical remarks as a necessary illustration of what is to follow, we proceed to give an account at large of the presentation in the Court of Exchequer, on the morrow after Michaelmas-day, of newly-elected Sheriffs, and of the discharge of their predecessors, in explanation of the annexed Plate. 
<P>It represents the interior of the Court of Exchequer, in Westminster Hall, formerly <num value="1">one</num> of the private apartments of the ancient Royal Palace of Westminster. The Lord Mayor stands, covered, at the centre of the Bar, with the Recorder on his right hand, and the newly-elected Sheriffs, the <num value="1">one</num> on the left of the Lord Mayor, the other on the right of the Recorder. The Aldermen who choose to attend the ceremony, behind the Lord Mayor; and the Companies of which the Sheriffs happen to be members are arranged in <num value="2">two</num> lines on either side of the Court, below the Bar, each behind its respective member. The Sword-bearer is seated at the right-hand corner of the Bar, and the Sergeant at Arms, or, as he is usually called, the Common Cryer, stands with his mace at the left. The senior City Marshal behind the Sword-bearer, and his junior at the lower end of the Court. The Common Serjeant, Town Clerk, Judges of the Sheriff's Court, City Counsel, Comptroller, <num value="1">one</num> of the Secondaries, the Remembrancer, the City Solicitor, the Clerk of the Peace for the City, <num value="1">one</num> of the Under-Sheriffs, and the Sheriff's Chaplain, are seated about the table on the left, and at the lower end. The late Sheriffs, the Under-Secondary, and the other Under-Sheriff, sit on the right; and on the Bench the Cursitor Baron, who customarily presides on this occasion. The horse-shoes, nails, knives, and sticks are placed on the table, in readiness for the discharge of those ancient rents or services which have been lately spoken of at some length. 
<P>All having been thus arranged, the Recorder addresses himself to the Cursitor Baron, on presenting the newly-elected Sheriffs for their admission into office, and their predecessors on their discharge from it. The form and method of the speeches usual on such occasions cannot be better exemplified than by those pronounced by the Recorder, John Sylvester, Esq. on the presentation and discharge of Samuel Birch and John Heygate, Esquires, on the <datestruct VALUE="1811-09-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> <month reg="09">September</month> <year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>. They are specimens rendered truly gratifying and valuable by the eloquence of the speaker, and the merit of the subjects. 
<P>&ldquo;Mr. Baron Maseres,&rdquo; said the Recorder, on presenting those gentlemen on their election, &ldquo;I have the honour to present at your Lordship's Bar Samuel Birch, Esq. alderman <pb id="p.10" n="10"> and cook and William Heygate, Esq. citizen and merchant-taylor, whom the Livery of London, by a very great majority, on a poll continued to its utmost legal extent, have elected to the important office of Sheriffs of London and Sheriff of Middlesex. Before this worthy Alderman was called to the honour of magistracy, the affection of his fellowcitizens had repeatedly returned him, for many successive years, as a faithful representative of the municipal parliament of the metropolis, in which, with a force and elegance of language worthy the highest assembly of the state, he exposed and overawed, in times big with danger, the internal enemies of the country, and rivetted the regards of his fellow-citizens to the great duties of a citizen, loyalty to their sovereign, and love of the constitution of their country. Whilst the enemies of mankind were meditating the total destruction of freedom, and all that is valuable to man in these happy isles, their last asylum, he nobly presented himself as a leader and instigator of his fellow-citizens voluntarily to enroll themselves in martial discipline, and dare the foe to meet on British ground the British bayonet, directed by a British arm. 
<P>&ldquo;His worthy colleague in the Shrievalty is known to his fellow-citizens in private life as a gentleman of great integrity, sound understanding, and largely acquainted with, and deeply interested in, the manufactures and commerce of the country.&mdash;But lately called to the great council of the city, they look forward to his public life with confidence that it will continually add to the high esteem that his private character had long created. 
<P>&ldquo;The important duties of this great office they have no doubt will, in every instance, be discharged by these gentlemen with consummate prudence, fidelity, ability, and integrity; and will, at the close of it, give them additional claims on the approbation and gratitude of the public.&rdquo; 
<P>On presenting them for their discharge, the Recorder delivered himself as follows: 
<P>&ldquo;My Lord, The late Sheriffs, Samuel Birch, Esq. and William Heygate, Esq. attend to render an account to our Lord the King of the issues and profits of their office.&mdash;When I had the honour to present these gentlemen to your Lordship, I described the former as the eloquent advocate of every principle of the constitution, the dreaded opponent of its domestic enemies, and the successful instigator of his fellow-citizens to array themselves in arms against it's external foes.&mdash;Of the latter I spoke as a highly respected member of the municipal assembly of the metropolis, whose conduct and character would be daily advancing him in the affections of his fellow citizens; and this prediction has been most honourably verified by his having been since elected to the high office of Alderman of London. Great as the expectations of their fellow-citizens were of the conduct of their Shrievalty, I have now the satisfaction to declare to your Lordship that it has been executed, in every instance, most usefully to the public, and most honourably to themselves; but the sense of their fellow-citizens on that occasion can by no other means be so well expressed as in their recorded language in the Common Hall of yesterday, in a meeting or assembly of the Mayor, Aldermen, and Liverymen of the several Companies of the City of London in Common Hall assembled at the Guildhall of the said City, on Tuesday the <datestruct VALUE="1812-09-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> day of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>.&mdash;Resolved unanimously, That the thanks of this Common Hall be given to Samuel Birch, Esq. and William Heygate, Esq. Aldermen, and late Sheriffs of this City, and Sheriff of the County of Middlesex, for their upright conduct during the whole of their Shrievalty; for their liberality and kindness to the poor prisoners committed to their care; and for their manly perseverance in supporting the chartered rights of this ancient City.&rdquo; 
<P>His speeches ended, the Recorder reads <num value="3">three</num> warrants: the <num value="1">first</num>, from the newly-elected Sheriffs to an officer of the Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer, authorizing him to receive for them all writs, and other mandates of the Court of Exchequer, according to the form of the statute; the <num value="2">second</num>, for the swearing of the <pb id="p.11" n="11"> former Sheriffs to their accounts; and the <num value="3">third</num>, for so swearing also their Under- Sheriffs. These warrants are again read; the <num value="2">two</num> former by the Filazer, the latter by the Treasurer's Remembrancer. It is ordered that they shall be filed and recorded; and the Sheriffs and Under-Sheriffs for the preceding year are then sworn to their accounts, the same oath (the terms of which we have given above) being subscribed by both. 
<P>The Cryer then makes proclamation&mdash;&ldquo;O yes, &amp;c.&mdash;Tenants and occupiers of a certain piece of waste ground, called the Moors <hi rend=italics>(the More)</hi>, in the county of Salop, come forth, and do your service, on pain and peril that may fall thereon:&rdquo; on which the senior Alderman present mounts the table, and, having cut the sticks, renders them, and the knives, according to the terms of the ancient tenure before mentioned. This done, the Cryer summons in the same manner, &ldquo;the tenants and occupiers of a certain tenement, called the Forge, in the parish of St. Clement Danes,&rdquo; &amp;c. He then proceeds to count the horse-shoes and the nails, and, on being severally questioned by an officer of the Court as to the amount of each, replies, &ldquo;<num value="6">Six</num> horse-shoes, and <num value="61">sixty-one</num> hob-nails;&rdquo; to which the officer rejoins, &ldquo;A good number.&rdquo; Thus ends this venerable annual memorial of feudal homage. <pb id="p.13" n="13">

<P>By the foregoing extracts, we may perceive that the <num value="1">first</num> building of Sir Thomas Gresham, by no means equalled the present structure either in strength or splendour, though it bore a considerable resemblance to it in other respects.<NOTE N="*"><P>Some striking differences, however, nothwithstanding this general resemblance, will be found on examining the print. Exclusive of the elegant pillar on the north side, which the present building wants, the windows and arches in the <num value="2">two</num> will be found to vary considerably, as well as their decorations. The statues, <num value="21">twenty-one</num> in number, commence with the Conqueror, and finish with Elizabeth (the reigning sovereign); next before whom are Philip and Mary. These appear to occupy only <hi rend=italics><num value="3">three</num></hi> sides of the structure. The grasshoppers at the angles, and recumbent figures beneath the arches, are likewise additions, which if at all tolerably executed, must have conduced much to the ornament and general effect of the whole.</NOTE>
The continual need it had of repairs sufficiently bespeaks the inferior nature of the workmanship and materials; and these defects, from other passages in the same book, too long to insert, appear to have continued until the great fire completely demolished the original edifice, just <num value="60">sixty</num> years after its <num value="1">first</num> foundation. 
<P>The present magnificent pile was erected, principally at the expense of the company of Mercers, joint proprietors with the city.

<P>The Inns of Court are stated to owe their <num value="1">first</num> establishment to King Henry III. who having in the year <datestruct value="1225"><year reg="1225">1225</year></datestruct> con firmed the charters granted by John his father, removed the Courts of Justice from his Palace into Westminster Hall; about which time, the lawyers, or practitioners in their Courts, began to form themselves into a Society (supposed at Thavie's Inn, in Holborn) in a collegiate manner; hence their place of residence was denominated an Inn, or House of Court: and Henry III. by his mandate, directed to the Mayor and Sheriffs of London, about the year <datestruct value="1244"><year reg="1244">1244</year></datestruct>, strictly enjoined them to make proclamation throughout the City, that no person whatsoever should presume to set up a School or Schools therein, for the teaching Law. In each of these Societies mootings were held, that is public meetings for the instruction of Students, wherein are argued divers abstruse points of Law, after the manner of trials in the Courts of Justice. 
<P>Furnival's Inn is an Inn of Chancery, situated on the north side of Holborn, and is <num value="1">first</num> noticed as a Law Seminary in the Steward's Account-book, written about the <num value="9">ninth</num> of King Henry IV. and derives its name, like most of the other Inns, from its original proprietors, the Lords Furnival. This noble family became extinct in the male line in the <num value="6">sixth</num> year of Richard II. some time before which period this Inn was demised by the Students of the Law, as is evident from the above circumstance; but the precise date of its <num value="1">first</num> legal establishment is unknown. 
<P>By Joan, the daughter and heir to William Lord Furnival, in the time of the former monarch (Henry IV.), the inheritance of Furnival's Inn came to Thomas Nevill, younger brother to Ralph Earl of Westmoreland; and by Maude, sole daughter and heir to the said Thomas and Joan, it afterwards descended to John Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury. In this line it continued till Francis Earl of Shrewsbury, in consideration of <measure value="120l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="120">120</num></measure>., by his deed, bearing date the <datestruct VALUE="-12-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> day of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, <num value="1">1</num> Edw. VI., sold it to Edward Gryffin, Esq. then Solicitor-General to the King, William Ropere, and Richard Heydone, Esqs. and their heirs, to the use of the Society of Lincoln's Inn; which sum of <measure value="120l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="120">120</num></measure>. (the purchase-money) was paid out of the treasury of that Society, and is entered in their register. The Principal and Fellows of Furnival's Inn, to whom a lease was granted by the Society of Lincoln's Inn, were to pay yearly <measure value="3l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3">3</num></measure>. <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>s</hi> <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>d</hi>, as appears by the accounts of that house, and by special orders there made, they were allowed several privileges as follows: <num value="1">First</num> in <num value="10">10</num> Eliz. it was ordered, that the utter Barristers of Furnival's Inn, of a year's continuance, and so certified and allowed by the Benchers of Lincoln's Inn, should pay no more than <measure value="4bmark" type=currency><num value="4">four</num> marks</measure> apiece for their admittance into that Society. The following year a like order was made, and every Fellow of this Inn, who had been allowed an utter Barrister here, and that had mooted here for <num value="2">two</num> vacations at the utter bar, should pay no more for his admission into the Society of Lincoln's Inn than <num value="13">13</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> though all utter Barristers of any other Inn of Chancery, excepting Thaivie's Inn, should pay <num value="20">20</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>; and that every inner Barrister of this House, who had mooted here <num value="1">one</num> vacation at the inner bar, should pay for his admission into this House, but <num value="20">20</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>; those of other houses (excepting Thaivie's Inn) paying <num value="26">26</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>

<P>Also, when by an order made at Lincoln's Inn, in <num value="27">27</num> Eliz. the admission of the gentlemen of this House and Thaivie's Inn into that Society, was raised to <num value="40">40</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> those of other Inns of Chancery were strained to <measure value="5bmark" type=currency><num value="5">five</num> marks</measure>; and in <num value="36">36</num> Eliz. those of this House had so much farther favour, that they might, after their admittance into Lincoln's Inn, stay <num value="2">two</num> years in the Inn of Chancery, paying their pensions during those <num value="2">two</num> years; and that they should be discharged of casting into commons, and of all the vacations and changes of Christmas, during the time of their stay here for those <num value="1">first</num> <num value="2">two</num> years. 
<P>Amongst other rules and orders hung up in the buttery of Lincoln's Inn, were the following, respecting the ancient mootings of this Society, and those of Thaivie's Inn: 
<emph>&ldquo;<hi rend=italics>In the Reading.</hi></emph>

<P>&ldquo;Mootes in Furnivall's Inn, every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, and Saturday, during the reading; but no exercise after the readers feast.&rdquo; 
<P>This Inn occupies a very considerable plot of ground, and is divided into <num value="2">two</num> squares or courts. The <num value="1">first</num> towards Holborn is of a good width, but shallow, and built round on the <num value="4">four</num> sides. The <num value="2">second</num>, or inner court, extends the <pb id="p.16" n="16"> depth of great part of Brook Street, and has chambers on <num value="1">one</num> side only: the date of the buildings is about the time of Charles the <num value="2">Second</num>. 
<P>Previous to being taken down in <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>, the hall was seen on entering the gateway next the street, but its aspect was by no means calculated to make a favourable impression on a spectator. It was a low plain brick building, with a small turret, and <num value="2">two</num> large projecting bow windows at the west end, and was, like the rest of the Inn, in a most neglected state. The north side of it, on passing through the passage or entrance to the inner court, with a small range of old chambers that adjoined, and whose fronts were plastered in the cottage style, had a singularly rustic appearance, bearing a much greater resemblance to a country village than a London Inn of Chancery. 
<P>The interior of the hall bore signs of greater antiquity than any other part of the building; its dimensions were <num value="40">40</num> feet by <num value="24">24</num>. The roof was of timber, arched, and divided into pannels by ribs springing from the sides; the floor at the upper end of the hall was raised for the Principals, as at the Middle Temple, &amp;c. It had in like manner a fireplace in the midst, and the same disposition of tables and benches; but they had no appearance, nor indeed the hall itself, of being often used. In the windows of this hall were a few armorial bearings; it likewise contained portraits of Lords Raymond and Pengelly. 
<P>The Society of Furnival's Inn was governed by a Principal and <num value="12">twelve</num> ancients; and the numbers were to be in commons a fortnight in every term, or pay <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> per week if absent. 
<P>Their arms are, argent a bend between <num value="6">six</num> martlets, gules within a border of the <num value="2">second</num>. 
<P>Furnival's Inn is thought by many to have been built after a design of Inigo Jones, but it bore not the least resemblance to the classical works of that great architect: the roof exhibited a jumble of inconsistencies irreconcilable with the taste and judgment of that master who stood forward as the <num value="1">first</num> artist in his way of the time. 
<P>During the taking down of the old building, to clear the foundation for the structure now erected, an accident happened in Furnival's Inn Court, by the falling of a wall, that separated it from the Inn, which from the injudicious heaping of rubbish against it, more than its strength could bear, gave way, and buried <num value="2">two</num> children in the ruins. 
<P>The view represents the front of this building, accurately delineated immediately previous to its demolition; the entrance seen to the left, is that of Furnival's Inn Court; and the inn-yard from which the stage-coach is issuing is the yard of the Bell and Crown Inn, Holborn. 
<P>The cellar adjoining to Furnival's Inn gate, merits notice from the following circumstances, well attested: it had long been frequented as an ale and cyder cellar, and falling into the hands of <num value="1">one</num> John Grey, who, after many years' application and industry, realized a sum of money, sufficient to purchase in Yorkshire, the place of his nativity, an estate of nearly <measure value="400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="400">400</num></measure>. per annum; when, having resided upon it a certain time, he grew weary of retirement, and pining for his former active situation, absolutely returned to London, and endeavoured to purchase his old cellar; but not succeeding, he proposed becoming a waiter, was accepted as such, and lived there several years, receiving a salary until he died. <pb id="p.17" n="17">

<P>The Custom House was originally built in the <num value="9">ninth</num> year of Richard II. in the mayoralty of Sir Nicholas Brembre, by John Churchman, then Sheriff, who is reported to have done many other good works towards the accommodation of the City of London. The building, from its ancient appearance in the reign of Elizabeth, seems never to have undergone the least alteration, and probably continued its original outward form until its destruction in the general conflagration, <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>. 
<P>In the year <datestruct value="1572"><year reg="1572">1572</year></datestruct>, the <num value="14">14th</num> of Queen Elizabeth, a list was brought in to the Lord Treasurer of the Queen's yearly Customs, which stood thus:

<P>The Queen lost considerably by concealments of Customs, as appeared by a note brought in about the <num value="8">eighth</num> or <num value="9">ninth</num> year of her reign, by the Customers of the port of London, of all the value of the goods shipped out or bought in by the English and strangers for the Queen's <num value="1">first</num> <num value="8">eight</num> years, taken out of the accounts delivered into the Exchequer; which <num value="1">one</num> Carmarthen, of the Custom House, drew up for the Queen's own use; wherein he set down what was, in those <num value="8">eight</num> years, concealed in Customs inward only, all things allowable deducted, viz. <num value="96720">96,720</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="12">12</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="7">7</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>; besides the petty Lustoms of strangers inwards, which is not herein reckoned. Whereupon there was a commission for concealment of Customs granted to <num value="1">one</num> <hi rend=italics>Edmond Matthews</hi>, but he was menaced with destruction, should he proceed in his investigations. 
<P>About the year <datestruct value="1590"><year reg="1590">1590</year></datestruct>, Thomas Smith was the Queen's Customer, to whom she let the Customs and Subsidies in the port of London inwards to farm (who had long before been a Collector of them), for which he paid her rent <num value="20000">20,000</num><hi rend=italics>l. per annum;</hi> whereas, as it was discovered, all the incomes of those Customs amounted nearly to <num value="30309">30,309</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="15">15</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="5">5</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>; so, as it appeared, the Queen lost yearly by that farm <num value="10309">10,309</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="15">15</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="5">5</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> This, the said Carmarthen cast up; thereby intending to let the Queen understand how much she lost by farming out her Customs, <hi rend=italics>viz</hi> above <num value="10000">10,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> a year. 
<P>There was a new officer propounded about the year <datestruct value="1572"><year reg="1572">1572</year></datestruct> to be brought into the <hi rend=italics>Custom House</hi>, viz. a Clerk for the Execution of Penal Statutes, <num value="1">one</num> Middlemore, who had moved for this place for himself, and obtained a patent for it, upon pretence, that forfeitures and penalties made by merchants might be the better answered to the Queen. About this the Lord Treasurer consulted the chief officers of the Custom House, who gave in their reasons against it, which were these: <num value="1">First</num>, that there was no place for any more officers or clerks than were already there placed, but rather lack of room for expedition of the merchants and shippers when they came there: that there had been divers like grants made for having of places in the Custom House, to whom denial had been made by the Lord Treasurer to have any place there; and that, for <hi rend=italics>Middlemore's</hi> patent, they thought it not profitable for the Queen's service, that any penal laws should be executed in her <hi rend=italics>Custom House;</hi> for that it would much hinder her revenue in her Customs and Subsidies, and also grieve the merchants, who did daily diminish in their trades, and employed their moneys upon exchange, whereof Her Majesty had no benefit. Finally, the <hi rend=italics>Custom House</hi> had always been a quiet place, appointed only for the receipt of the Queen's revenues and duties, and not for execution of penal statutes which were repugnant <num value="1">one</num> to the other. 
<P>Farming out the Customs continued until the period of the civil wars, when Sir Paul Pindar, who had farmed the Customs during greater part of King James the <num value="1">First</num>'s reign, continued the same practice under his son and successor Charles I. by whom he lost considerable sums of money advanced and lent to him during his troubles. 
<P>The <num value="1">first</num> Custom House, built, as mentioned above, in the reign of Richard II. was destroyed by the great fire in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, and of which a view is given from an extremely rare print. It was rebuilt shortly after, and again destroyed by fire in the year <datestruct value="1718"><year reg="1718">1718</year></datestruct>; rebuilt a <num value="3">third</num> time, and destroyed by the same devouring element in the year <datestruct value="1814"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>. The particulars of which are as follow: 
<P>On the <datestruct VALUE="-02-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, at about <num value="6">six</num> o'clock in the morning, the building was discovered to be on fire. The calamity was supposed to have originated from a fire-flue of <num value="1">one</num> of the offices of business, adjoining a closet on the <num value="2">two</num>-pair of stairs attached to the housekeeper's apartments. There can be little doubt of the fire having been smouldering throughout the greater part of the previous evening. The porter of the house was the <num value="1">first</num> person who discovered it. He was going up stairs, and when on the <num value="2">second</num> floor, heard a crackling of fire, and saw a flame breaking through the ceiling; he instantly rushed into the room, which was that in which Colonel Kelly slept, whom he found standing by the bed-feet, the curtains in a blaze, and the flame pouring from the above-mentioned closet. By this time the whole room was on fire, and a Mr. Drinkald had given the alarm from the quay, towards which the windows of this room looked. The porter hastened to call up the servants and the family; the Colonel ran to a room adjoining his own fronting the street, and was saved by a ladder with great difficulty, but shockingly burnt in the face and hands. The Miss Kellys most narrowly escaped, with only the covering of blankets; and Captain Hinton Kelly made his way through the fire with his sisters in the same unprovided state. Most of the servants had previously fled to the top of the house, from which they were taken down by ladders. A female servant of Miss Kelly jumped out of a <num value="2">two</num>-pair of stairs window: she was much hurt, and carried to St. Thomas's Hospital in a lifeless state. <num value="2">Two</num> orphan girls, in the service of Miss Kelly, perished. They had been awakened by the alarm; and the cook of the establishment, in making her escape, passed the door of the room in which these children slept. She threw it open, and called to them to &ldquo;follow her instantly, for the house was on fire.&rdquo; They answered her, sitting up in their bed, &ldquo;We will just put on our gowns and get away;&rdquo; but the room, which was already filled with smoke, burst into flame, and it is concluded that when they strove to make their way to the staircase, they were overpowered by the rapid progress of the fire. The engines arrived soon after <num value="7">seven</num> o'clock. About <num value="8">eight</num> the flames had obtained so great an ascendancy, that all attempts to save the edifice were abandoned. The exertions of the firemen and others employed were then directed to the <pb id="p.18" n="18"> warehouses and other buildings on both sides of the street, when a report was circulated that many barrels of gunpowder were deposited in the vaults. This report had nearly a magical effect: all withdrew to a distance, and the flames were left for some time to rage uncontrolled. At half-past <num value="9">nine</num> an explosion took place, and the shock was distinctly felt on the Royal Exchange, and by persons coming to London by the Whitechapel Road. It carried the burnt papers, ship registers, and a variety of matter, as far as Dalston, Shacklewell, Homerton, Hackney, and all the adjoining villages in the direction of the wind. The gunpowder which exploded had been deposited in the armoury of the Custom House Volunteers. The flames soon communicated to the houses in Thames Street, opposite the Custom House, and embraced, in a short time, the warehouses in Globe Yard, and the whole of the tenements extending from Beer Street to Water Lane, from which it required the utmost activity of the inmates to escape, not with their property, but with their lives. Many individuals were severely scorched. At <num value="1">one</num> o'clock the whole of the Custom House and the adjoining warehouses were completely reduced to ashes; <num value="10">ten</num> houses opposite the Custom House were burnt down by <num value="2">two</num> o'clock; among them Holland's Coffee House, the Rose and Crown and Yorkshire Grey public-houses. and the King's Arms public-house damaged. The East India and Custom House corps of volunteers were on the spot soon after the bursting out of the flames, and by unceasing attention prevented much plunder and confusion. 
<P>The actual loss to Government by the sudden destruction of the Custom House cannot be calculated; yet there is great consolation in knowing that many of the important papers of office were recovered, and several chests of valuables, with the principal records, saved. The insurance on the Custom House amounted to <num value="100000">100,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> Though public business must have materially suffered by the conflagration, the Commissioners and their officers took the most active measures to facilitate its progress. The spacious and elegant &ldquo;Commercial Sale Rooms,&rdquo; in Mincing Lane, were engaged temporarily to carry on the public business. 
<P>Several gentlemen had left large sums of money in their desks, ready to make payments on the following day. <num value="1">One</num> individual lost, it is said, upwards of <measure value="6000l." type=currency><num value="6000">six thousand</num> pounds</measure> in Bank notes, which were irrecoverable, as the memorandum of the numbers was in the desk with the notes, and met the same fate.&mdash;A very fine collection of pictures was also lost, which the Commissioners had permitted a gentleman to leave in deposit till it would be convenient for him to pay the duties, amounting to <datestruct value="1500--"><year reg="1500">1500</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> An old clerk, with great perseverance, assisted by some workmen, got through the ruins to an iron chest, upon the spot where he had usually officiated, and recovered <num value="400">400</num> guineas. 
<P>The present magnificent building is every way superior to the last, both with respect to the conveniency of its numerous offices and its dimensions; the facility with which access is given by widening the street, through means of the embankment made from the Thames; the former street rendering it extremely dangerous to passengers, who scarcely had room sufficient to pass without occasionally being compelled to walk in the middle of the road. 
<P>The new Custom House is erected on the site of a number of warehouses on the free quays, and a few dwellinghouses, extending from the Gun Tavern, westward, to Sam's Coffee House, opposite Water Lane, eastward, both inclusive, viz. 
<P>Smart's and Dice Quay.&mdash;Smart's and part of Dice Quay is in the parish of St. Mary at Hill and in the ward of Billingsgate; the whole of the remainder is in the parish of St. Dunstan in the East, in the ward of Tower, viz. Young's Quay, Ralph's Quay, Wiggin's Quay, Sabb's Quay, Bear Quay, and Porter's Quay. 
<P>The dwelling-houses are, the Gun Tavern, and the Dice and Key, the Tackle Porters, the Ipswich Arms, and the Coopers' Arms, public houses; Mr. Charles Martin, wholesale cheesemonger; Mr. Kenyon, sack merchant; and Sam's Coffee House; and a few inferior dwellings in Dice Quay Gateway and Temple Stairs Passage. 
<P>The public stairs removed, are, Temple Stairs, between Dice and Young's Quay; Bear Quay Stairs, between Wiggin's and Sabb's Quay; Custom House Stairs, at the east end of Porters' Quay.

<P>The public entrance to the Custom House, in Thames Street, is both grand and commodious; the avenues and offices are convenient and airy; the Long Room, which is perhaps for dispatch of business the best adapted of any thing of the kind in Europe, contains <num value="2">two</num> handsome stoves, and <num value="3">three</num> circular writing-desks for public use. There are <num value="2">two</num> arched communications from Thames Street to the river side, through the body of the building, which are closed at <num value="5">five</num> o'clock every evening, by very handsome ornamented iron gates. At each of the extreme ends of the structure are public entrances, never closed against foot passengers, but secured by large iron gates, against the admission of carriages of every description at unseasonable times. Both the wharf and street are well watched, and the boxes have each a glazed window to protect the watchmen from any inclemency of weather when on duty. 
<P>The front view from the Thames exhibits, without question, a prospect of the most chaste and classic architecture of modern times. The frieze which embellishes the upper part of the edifice consists in characteristic representations of every nation, state, and country in the known world. This frieze is in <num value="2">two</num> compartments: in the centre of the <num value="1">first</num>, His present Majesty, George III. appears, receiving the credentials of foreign ambassadors from their respective sovereigns. In the centre of the <num value="2">second</num>, Britannia, seated in an escalop shell, is receiving tributary offerings from the different nations inhabiting the globe. 
<P>The wharf forms a beautiful marine parade, at each end of which are handsome and convenient stairs, for the purpose of taking water and landing goods. The end of the Custom House next Billingsgate, forms a vast improvement in the access to that celebrated market, which now consists of an enlarged area or square, at <num value="1">one</num> corner of which is erected Billingsgate watch-house, built <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>, Sir William Leighton, Knt, alderman of the ward; John Ord, Esq., deputy. 
<P>The Royal Arms are placed in the centre of the Custom House, next the Thames, over the King's warehouse, and receive double effect from the supporting emblems of England's glory, the figures of NEPTUNE and BRITANNIA. 
<P>The Architect of this magnificent building is David Laing, Esq., and the designer of the frieze, with the figures of Neptune and Britannia, Mr. Bubb. <pb id="p.19" n="19">

<P>At that distant period of English History when Courts were held in the <hi rend=italics>Aula Regis</hi>, or Hall of the King's Palace, and followed the Sovereign in all his progresses and change of residence,&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> of those tribunals was placed under the authority of the Lord-Steward of the Royal Household; the process being executed by the Earl-Marshal. The jurisdiction exercised by the Lord-Steward in person, was very general; since it extended to real, personal, and mixed actions, and even to Pleas of the Crown, as Justice in Eyre and Vicegerent of the Lord Chief Justice: it is supposed by Sir Edward Coke,<NOTE N="a"><P><hi rend=italics>The Reports of Sir Edward Coke, Knight;</hi> Edit. by George Wilson, Serjeant at Law, <num value="8">8</num>vo.</NOTE> however, that this general power ceased on the passing of the Statute called <hi rend=italics>Articuli super Chartas</hi>, in the <num value="28">28th</num> year of Edward I., <datestruct value="1299--"><year reg="1299">1299</year></datestruct>-<datestruct value="1300--"><year reg="1300">1300</year></datestruct>, Stat. iii. chap v.;&mdash;by which the Judges of the King's Bench were ordered to follow the person of the King.<NOTE N="b"><P>Chapter iii. of the same Statute ordains &ldquo;of what things the Marshal of the King's Household shall hold Pleas.&rdquo;</NOTE> Beside this general jurisdiction, there was also <num value="1">one</num> particularly belonging to the Marshalsea of the King's House.<NOTE N="c"><P>The derivation of the term <hi rend=italics>Marshalsea</hi> is not stated in the larger English Dictionaries; though the name appears to be very naturally composed from Marshal and See, the seat of the Marshal: the latter word being a corruption of the French <hi rend=italics>Si&eacute;ge</hi>, a seat.</NOTE> peculiar to, and inseparable from, the King's person; namely, to decide differences and to punish criminals within the Royal Palace, or the Verge thereof, which extended to <num value="12">twelve</num> miles around it.<NOTE N="d"><P>The precincts of the Royal Court appear to have been peculiarly honoured and protected at a very early period of English History: since, in the times of the Saxons, if a quarrel took place in a Church, the crime was redeemable for <measure value="120s." type=currency><num value="120">120</num> shillings</measure>: but if any fought in the King's House, he was to forfeit <hi rend=italics>all</hi> his property, and the Sovereign might take his life or not. A very ancient Saxon constitution provides that the <hi rend=italics>Pax Regia</hi>, or Royal Peace, and privilege of the King's Palace, should extend <num value="3">3</num> miles, <num value="3">3</num> furlongs, <num value="3">3</num> acres, <num value="9">9</num> feet, <num value="9">9</num> palms, and <num value="9">9</num> barley-corns, beyond the Palace-gate.</NOTE> Of this Court the Lord-Steward was also the real head and president, but it was holden before the Steward of the Court of Marshalsea and the Marshal of the King's House; the former being deputy to the Lord-Steward, and the latter to the Earl-Marshal. 
<P>The civil jurisdiction of this Court, required that at least <num value="1">one</num> of the parties appearing before it in any cause, should be a member of the King's Household, and from this circumstance having been established in an action in the reign of James I., the practice of the Court was nearly annihilated; in consequence of which he erected a new Court of Record, entitled <hi rend=italics>Curia Virg&aelig; Hospitii Domini Regis</hi>, or the Court of the Verge of the House of the Lord the King: whereof Sir Francis Bacon, then Solicitor-General, and Sir Thomas Vavasor, then Marshal of the Household, were constituted the Judges. It continued to exist only until <datestruct VALUE="-07-12"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=12>12th</day></datestruct>, in the <num value="6">6th</num> year of Charles I., <datestruct value="1631--"><year reg="1631">1631</year></datestruct>, when another was established by Letters Patent, and called <hi rend=italics>Curia Palatii Regis Westmonasterii</hi>, the Court of the King's Palace of Westminster; the <num value="1">first</num> Judges of which were the Steward of the King's Household, Sir Edmund Verney, Knight, then Marshal of the Household, with the Steward of the Court, to which office Edward Herbert of the Inner Temple was thereby appointed. The legality of this Patent was soon questioned upon a Writ of Error in the King's Bench; but the Court appears to have existed until the commencement of the Civil War, when it probably ceased with the Royal establishment. Upon the Restoration the sittings of this tribunal were resumed, but the legality of the Patent was again doubted by <num value="1">one</num> of the Judges of the King's Bench in <datestruct value="1664--"><year reg="1664">1664</year></datestruct>; for which cause, probably, other Letters Patent were issued, dated <datestruct VALUE="-10-4"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=4>4th</day></datestruct> in that year, devoid of all the former objections, constituting a new Court with the same title, which has since been commonly known as &ldquo;the Palace Court.&rdquo; After reciting the inconveniences arising from the limited power of the Marshalsea, the Patent conferred upon the Court authority for trying all Personal Actions, of any amount, arising within <num value="12">twelve</num> miles of the Palace of Westminster: with exception, however, of the City of London, and of such pleas as already belonged to the Court of Marshalsea The Judges of the Palace- Court were the Lord Steward, the Marshal of the Household, and the Steward of the Court; all of whom should attend every court-day, excepting upon a reasonable cause of absence; and to practice in the Court there were to be <num value="4">four</num> Counsel, <num value="6">six</num> Attornies, and a Prothonotary, all nominated for life.<NOTE N="e"><P>The Report of the Committee of Enquiry concerning the Marshalsea Prison, &amp;c. presented to Parliament in <datestruct value="1729--"><year reg="1729">1729</year></datestruct>, states that it was the custom of that Court to sell all the places belonging to it; and that those of the Counsel were usually bought for <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> and those of the Attorneys for <datestruct value="1500--"><year reg="1500">1500</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> The inferior practice in the Marshalsea, however, was very much reduced by the establishment of Courts of Conscience, or Request, in and near London, by the Act of the <num value="23">23rd</num> year of George II., <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>; chap. xxvii. sect. xxii, of which assigns those Courts to pay <num value="20">20</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> yearly, in consequence, to each of the <num value="4">four</num> Counsellors of the Marshalsea. In <datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, a Bill was introduced in Parliament to extend the powers of those Courts to debts not exceeding <num value="5">5</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> in amount, which occasioned a petition from the Knight-Marshal, the Steward, and the Prothonotaries, of the Marshalsea.

Appendix p. xxiv.

Until the year <datestruct value="1800"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct> there were <num value="6">six</num> Marshal's men, who were probably the successors of those now referred to; and who bought their places from the Knight-Marshal.

<P>The proceedings conducted before this tribunal are very considerable, but are carried on entirely in the Palace-Court, though the Court of Marshalsea is still formally opened. They are generally expeditious; since the Court sits every Friday, the postponements are from week to week, and judgment is usually given in <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> hearings. The peculiarities of the various causes and attachments pursued in the Court, may be seen in <hi rend=italics>The History and Antiquities of the County of Surrey</hi>, by the Rev. Owen Manning and William Bray, Esq, Volume iii. London, <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>. folio Appendix, pages xxv, xxvi. The suits embrace actions for trespasses and assaults committed within the jurisdiction of the Court, and for debts, not under <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">40</num> shillings</measure>: the proceedings are instituted by either an attachment or a Writ of Capias.<NOTE N="g"><P>The following curious, though probably erroneous, account of the purposes of the Marshalsea Prison, is given by Sign.

The government or superintendence of it, is given by the King as a mark of favour to some gentleman; who, if a prisoner make his escape, is himself obliged to pay the debt and also the penalties annexed to the crime; and there is therefore an established rate, varying according to the rank and quality of the individual, which must be paid to the superintendant on entering the prison. For Dukes it is fixed at the sum of <num value="40">40</num> crowns, for Earls at <num value="30">30</num>, and for others at a smaller sum; beside the rent of apartments and the expense of victuals: whence the annual value of this office is estimated at about <num value="20000">20,000</num> crowns, to the superintendent. The prisoners are not kept under confinement, but have liberty to take a walk over the Bridge; a promise being <num value="1">first</num> exacted from them not to pass the limits, and to return to their post, which they generally observe; and it very rarely happens that they infringe upon the privilege.&rdquo;&mdash;In the Marshalsea prison are also confined such as are to be tried in the Admiralty Court, and until <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct> persons were committed thither for Piracy.</NOTE>

<P>The ancient Court of the Marshalsea was for many years established in King Street, Southwark; and its existence there is indicated in an order from Edward III. dated in his <num value="47">47th</num> year, <datestruct value="1374"><year reg="1374">1374</year></datestruct>, empowering the good men of Southwark to &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>rebuild</hi> in our Royal <pb id="p.20" n="20"> Street, which extends from the Church of the Blessed Margaret towards the south in the same town, a certain House, &amp;c. to hold in the same House, as well the Pleas of the Marhalsea of our Household, and for the safe custody of the prisoners in the same Marshalsea for the time being, in the same town,&mdash;as to hold in the aforesaid House all other Courts of us and our heirs, which shall be held in the same town for the time to come, by reason of the Assizes, Juries, Inquisitions to be taken <hi rend=italics>Nisi Prius</hi>, and by any other Court whatsoever.&rdquo; In <datestruct value="1377--"><year reg="1377">1377</year></datestruct>, however, the <num value="50">50th</num> year of the same King, the prisoners of the Marshalsea appear to have been kept in London. Sir Henry Piercy, the Marshal, having committed a man contrary to the City privileges, the Citizens, being persuaded by their Standard-Bearer, the Baron Fitz Walter, took up arms, and ran to the Marshal's Inn, where they brake open the gates and brought away the prisoner; intending also to have burned <hi rend=italics>the stocks in the middle of the City</hi>, in which it is to be supposed that he had been confined. About the following Easter John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, having brought a great number of ships to London, <num value="1">one</num> of the sailors was killed by an esquire. in a fray, and he was committed to the <hi rend=italics>Marshalsea in Southwark</hi>, where the other mariners prosecuted him; but upon his being pardoned they broke into the prison, stabbed him, and hung up his dead body. In <datestruct value="1381--"><year reg="1381">1381</year></datestruct> the Kentish rebels under Cade broke down the house of Sir John Imworth, then Marshal, and that of the King's Bench in Southwark, and took away the prisoners.

<P>In <datestruct value="1663--"><year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct> a charge of extortion and vexatious proceedings was made against the Prison of the Marshalsea, in a petition presented to the House of Commons from the inhabitantss of the Cities of London and Westminster, and of the Counties of Middlesex, Kent, Essex, and Surrey: for the redress of which, as well as for the regulation of the Court, several bills were brought into Parliament, though they were never carried through. At length on <datestruct VALUE="1728-02-28"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=28>28th</day>, <year reg=1728>1728</year></datestruct>-<num value="29">29</num>, the cruelties practised upon Mr. Castell in the Fleet Prison having caused his death, an enquiry into the state of the Gaols of the Kingdom was moved in the House of Commons, by James Edward Oglethorpe, Esq. Member for Haslemere, in Surrey. After having effectually redressed the oppressions of the Fleet, a Report, dated <datestruct VALUE="-05-14"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=14>14th</day></datestruct>, states that the custody of the Marshalsea Prison had been committed for life to John Darby, the Deputy-Marshal and Keeper, by Sir Philip Medowes, Knight-Marshal, on <datestruct VALUE="1720-11-25"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=25>25th</day>, <year reg=1720>1720</year></datestruct>; with the stipulation that the latter should not let his offices or fees to farm without the consent of the former. On <datestruct VALUE="1727-03-21"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=21>21st</day>, <year reg=1727>1727</year></datestruct>, however, Darby, without such consent, disposed of those profits to William Acton, Butcher, for <datestruct value="1401--"><year reg="1401">1401</year></datestruct>. yearly; and of the benefits of lodging the prisoners, &amp;c. for <num value="2601">2601</num>. yearly. To raise this rent oppression, extortion, cruelty, and even torture, were exercised; the prisoners being kept in close crowded rooms, from <num value="30">thirty</num> to <num value="50">fifty</num> being placed in an apartment not <num value="16">16</num> feet square, and <num value="3">three</num> persons being allotted to every bed, each paying <num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> per week. When the Committee <num value="1">first</num> met at the Marshalsea on <datestruct VALUE="-03-25"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=25>25th</day></datestruct> in the Women's Ward many were found lying on the floor without beds and dying for want, and the Male Ward was even worse. Upon giving food to the captives, with even the greatest caution, <num value="1">one</num> died from the loss of tone in his digestive powers, his stomach having become contracted for want of use. Most of the others recovered, only <num value="9">nine</num> dying between <datestruct VALUE="-03-25"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=25>25th</day></datestruct> and <datestruct VALUE="-05-14"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=14>14th</day></datestruct>, though previously a day had seldom passed without a death; and upon the advance of spring <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> died usually every <num value="24">twenty-four</num> hours; but, though required by law, a Coroner's Inquest had not been for many years held in the Prison. Upon the receipt of this Report, the House came to very strong resolutions against Darby and Acton; and Mr. Oglethorpe having stated that he was directed to move an Address to the King for their prosecution, it was unanimously agreed to. It has not been ascertained whether the former were prosecuted, but the Attorney-General caused <num value="4">four</num> Bills of Indictment to be preferred against the latter for the murder of as many persons. They were tried at the Spring-Assizes at Kingston in <datestruct value="1729--"><year reg="1729">1729</year></datestruct>, before Baron Carter, but Acton was acquitted on each from some contradictory evidence and discharged. He was immediately after taken up on the charge of a <num value="5">fifth</num> murder, and refused bail; but after lying in prison until the Winter-Assizes, the Grand- Jury threw out the Bill of Indictment. 
<P>The Prison of the Marshalsea is now situate on the eastern side of St. Margaret's Hill, or High Street, Southwark, a very short distance from the Church of St. George the Martyr. It previously stood, however, close to King Street, as exhibited in the Plan inserted beneath the present View. The old entrance to it was by a large and close arched gate, with heavy wooden panels and a semicircular pediment, in the front of a building level with the street; whence a narrow passage led into a long and spacious court-yard, surrounded by several irregular buildings, the northern side of which is represented in the annexed Plate. These structures constituted the dwellings of the Prison, and contained between <num value="50">fifty</num> and <num value="60">sixty</num> rooms; the peculiar names and purposes of which are also given in the references to the View. Of those apartments only <num value="6">six</num> were appropriated to Common-side Debtors; but if there were more of them than could be accommodated at <num value="3">three</num> in a room, they were received into others on the Master's Side. The aparments called &ldquo;the Oaks&rdquo; were allotted exclusively to females; but there was only <num value="1">one</num> yard for all the prisoners.

The Court-Room appeared to be the work of Inigo Jones, and was extremely rich within; being decorated with panels on the walls, and a very fine compartment coved ceiling, ornamented with carved wreaths of flowers, cartouche-shields, and the royal badge of the portcullis, with crowns and sceptres.

<P>The Borough of Southwark originally contained <num value="1">one</num> general prison for the whole County of Surrey for the confinement of all criminals which was called the White Lion, and which stood upon the site of the present Marshalsea. Very early in the last century that edifice was &ldquo;an old decayed house,&rdquo; and the county-prisoners were removed to the old Marshalsea, which was used until they were removed to the New Gaol at Horsemonger Lane, <datestruct VALUE="1798-08-3"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=3>3rd</day>, <year reg=1798>1798</year></datestruct>.

<P>The subject of crosses forms a class in the system of old English architecture of very high interest. The great variety and general beauty of their forms, their age, and a sort of traditional sanctity attached to them, unite to impress the mind of the beholder with sentiments of veneration not easily to be described. Considered as fragments of national costume, as memorials of the skill and piety of our forefathers, the man of taste must ever lament their destruction, and reprobate that excess of indiscriminating zeal in our reformers, which, in seeking the overthrow of superstition, too often waged war with the fine arts. 
<P>No building of this kind ever occasioned more noise than the <num value="1">one</num> of which we are now about to treat; this probably arose from its situation in the principal street of the metropolis. Cheapside was, from the earliest times, the great theatre of exhibition of the splendour of our ancestors. Tilts, tournaments, and processions, rendered it <num value="1">one</num> continued scene of amusement. Chaucer hints at this in his &ldquo;Coke's Tale,&rdquo;&mdash;where describing an idle city apprentice, he says: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>A prentis whilom dwelt in our citee,&mdash; 
<L>At every bridale would he sing and hoppe; 
<L>He loved bet the taverne than the shoppe; for whan ther any <hi rend=italics>riding</hi> was in CHEPE,<NOTE N="b"><P>Alluding

<L>Out of the shoppe thider wold he lepe, 
<L>And &rsquo;til that he had all the sight ysein, 
<L>And danced wel, he would not come again.</QUOTE>

<P>Its celebrated cross and conduits must have added grace to these festivities. Accordingly we hear of the former being frequently <hi rend=italics>regilt</hi>, and the latter running with <hi rend=italics>wine;</hi> while the houses and shops vied with each other in a display of sumptuous tapestry and plate. The annexed engraving, representing &ldquo;the procession of Edward VI. to his coronation at Westminster,&rdquo; exhibits a striking example of this sort of splendour: we extract from the pamphlet of the Antiquarian Society, accompanying the original plate, the following sketch:&mdash; 

 
<P>On the <datestruct VALUE="1546-02-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month> <year reg="1546">1546</year></datestruct>-<num value="7">7</num> the day fixed on for the coronation (says the order<NOTE N="c"><P>See it in Lelandi Collect. i. v. iv. p. <num value="310">310</num>, printed from a MS. formerly belonging to Will. Le Neve, Norroy King at Arms.</NOTE>), <QUOTE rend=blockquote>about <num value="1">one</num> of the clock in the afternoon, the King's Majesty proceeded from the Tower through the city of London, in most royal and goodly wise, towards his palace of Westminster. The streets through all the way where the King should pass, were well gravelled in every place, and railed on the <num value="1">one</num> side from Gracechurch Street to the Little Conduit in Cheap, to the intent, that the horses should not slide on the pavement, nor the people be hurt by the horses in the high streets. Within these rails stood the crafts along in their order, to the Little Conduit aforesaid, where stood the aldermen. On the other side the streets, in many places, stood priests and clerks with their crosses and censers, and in their best ornaments, to cense the King; and all the way where the King should pass, on either side, were the windows and ways garnished with cloths of tapestry, arras, cloths of gold and of silver, with cushions of the same, garnished with streamers and banners, as richly as might be devised.</QUOTE>

<P>Our view represents CHEAPSIDE, and a <hi rend=italics>part</hi> of the above procession at the time when the King had just arrived at the CROSS. The balconies and windows of all the houses on the left-hand side of the street are crowded with spectators, and decorated as described. Among the celebrated paintings copied in tapestry, <num value="1">one</num> is evidently from Raphael's famous picture of St. George on horseback; a print of which is engraved by Vosterman. The shops are set out with cups, vases, beakers, jars, and other elegant pieces of goldsmith's works.<NOTE N="d"><P>The houses shewn are &ldquo;Goldsmith's Row&rdquo;&mdash;built by Thomas Wood, goldsmith and sheriff, in <datestruct value="1491--"><year reg="1491">1491</year></datestruct>, on the site of a set of sheds and stalls, before called the &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Mercery</hi>,&rdquo; as being inhabited by <hi rend=italics>mercers.</hi> Stowe calls them &ldquo;a most beautiful frame of faire houses and shops, consisting of tenne faire dwelling houses and <num value="14">fourteen</num> shops, all in <num value="1">one</num> frame, uniformly builded foure stories high, beautified towards the street with the goldsmith armes and likeness of woodmen, in memorie of his name, riding on monstrous beasts all richly painted and gilt.&rdquo;&mdash;Maitland informs us, that the city then abounded in riches and splendour:&ldquo;It was beautiful,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to behold the glorious appearance of goldsmiths' shops in the south row of Cheapside, which in a course reached from the Old Change to Bucklersbury, exclusive of <num value="4">four</num> shops only of other trades in all that space.&rdquo; Vol. i. p. <num value="301">301</num>.</NOTE> The master of each house is standing at his shop door, and saluting the King as he passes.<NOTE N="e"><P>The persons in the procession are,&mdash;<num value="1">first</num> and principal the King, &ldquo;richly apparelled,&rdquo; says the account, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>with a gown of cloth of silver, all over embroidered with damask gold, with a girdle of white velvet, wrought with Venice silver, garnished with precious stones, as rubies and diamonds, with true lover's knots of pearls; a doublet of white velvet embroidered with Venice silver garnished with the like precious stones and pearles, and a pair of buskins with white velvet.

As science advanced, these monuments became an object of decoration, on which the skill and labour of the artist and sculptor were profusely lavished. Piles of solid masonry exquisitely wrought and adorned with statues, succeeded the simple pillar, placed in the churchyard, or on the road side; and gracing the most public situations, vied at length with the obelisks and columns of antiquity, while the crucifix itself was lost in the greatness of the building on which it was elevated. Of this description, rank in a very supereminent degree the crosses, or pious memorials erected by Edward I. to the memory of his Queen Eleanor, of which that in Cheap, which we now proceed to describe, was <num value="1">one</num>. 
<P>The original cross was erected in the year <datestruct value="1290"><year reg="1290">1290</year></datestruct>, and was of <hi rend=italics>stone.</hi> Cheapside is described as having been but a few years before this period an open field;<NOTE N="b"><P>Called in the year <datestruct value="1246"><year reg="1246">1246</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>Crown field</hi>, from an hostelrie, or inn, with the sign of the crown at the east end. It afterwards received the name of West-Cheeping, from 
<hi rend=italics>chepe</hi>, a market, as being originally the great street of splendid shops.</NOTE> it was consequently a fit spot for the site of such a monument. In after-ages, when the street by building on became narrowed, so large a structure must have been productive of much inconvenience, which would of itself have justified its demolition, had it not been objected to as superstitious by the fanaticism of the age. <hi rend=italics>No memorial remains of this <num value="1">first</num> cross:</hi> Stowe says, it was like the other crosses of Edward's foundation; and Mr. Pennant expressly tells us, that it had the statue of Queen Eleanor on the top, and in all respects resembled that at Northampton; but he appears to have no authority for such an assertion. There is little doubt but that it far excelled in beauty those which were subsequently erected. 
<P>In the year <datestruct value="1441"><year reg="1441">1441</year></datestruct>, this original cross was found to be decayed, and permission was solicited from the King to rebuild it with the addition of a conduit, or water-spout.<NOTE N="c"><P>The original grant, copied by Strype from Pat. <num value="21">21</num> Hen.

<P>The common granary spoken of was that built at Leadenhall. This cross expressed to serve <QUOTE lang=la>pro quadam Augea tanquam mater</QUOTE>, seems to have been for an increase and supply of water, as the mother aqueduct, to the rest of the conduits, as though there were pipes laid from hence to the rest.</NOTE> The latter reason must certainly have principally operated for pulling it down, for we can hardly suppose it much worse in a century and a half, when several of Edward's crosses still exist nearly perfect. John Hutherly, or Hatherley, then mayor of London, began by collecting large quantities of lead and other materials for the work; but it was not finished until the year <datestruct value="1486"><year reg="1486">1486</year></datestruct>, <num value="45">forty-five</num> years afterwards.<NOTE N="d"><P>The expense of its erection was defrayed by various citizens: John Fisher, mercer, contributed <measure value="600bmark" type=currency><num value="600">600</num> marks</measure> towards it.</NOTE>

<P>This <hi rend=italics><num value="2">second</num></hi> cross, exhibited in the Plate, had been completely cleaned and new gilt on the accession of Edward VI. to the crown, and is drawn probably on that account with an attention to detail, observed in none of the other buildings, and which leaves no doubt of its being a faithful portrait.<NOTE N="e"><P>It was new gilt all over in <datestruct value="1522--"><year reg="1522">1522</year></datestruct>, against the coming of the Emperor Charles V. It was again burnished as above, and also in <datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>, against the coronation of Queen Mary; and gilt in <datestruct value="1554--"><year reg="1554">1554</year></datestruct>, against the coming in of King Philip. There is no doubt but that much of this <num value="2">second</num> cross was composed of <hi rend=italics>timber</hi>, covered with <hi rend=italics>lead</hi>, from the frequent regildings it underwent; and the <hi rend=italics>last</hi> cross which succeeded it, seems to have been built with the same materials.</NOTE> It consists of <hi rend=italics><num value="3">three</num></hi> stories, decorated with suitable figures, the lowermost flanked by columns supporting angels. Its summit, which rises nearly to the height of the loftiest houses, is crowned by the elegant crucifix and <hi rend=italics>dove</hi>, which afterwards gave so much offence. The whole is in a much purer taste than the cross which succeeded it. 
<P>This beautiful architectural specimen stood the ornament of the street until the latter end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when the squeamish taste of the age began to find fault with it as a remnant of popish superstition, and its destruction was eagerly solicited. It was frequently presented as a common nuisance; but these complaints not being attended to, the petitioners began to redress themselves. An attack was made by some unknown persons, in the night of the <datestruct VALUE="1581-06-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="06">June</month> <year reg="1581">1581</year></datestruct>, on the lower tier of images, being of the <hi rend=italics>Resurrection, Virgin Mary, Christ</hi>, and 
<hi rend=italics>Edward the Confessor;</hi> all of which were miserably mutilated: the Virgin &ldquo;was robbed of her son, and her armes broken, by which shee staied him on her knees; her whole body also hailed by ropes, and left ready to fall.&rdquo;<NOTE N="f"><P>Survaie of London, p. <num value="552">552</num>, ed. <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>.&mdash;Stowe must mistake in describing the Virgin and child, as forming a part of the <hi rend=italics>lower</hi> tier of images, as the plate evidently places them in a niche on the <hi rend=italics><num value="2">second</num></hi> story. This also accounts for the figures being &ldquo;hailed by <hi rend=italics>ropes</hi>,&rdquo; in order to pull them down, as being, otherwise, out of reach. Edward the Confessor is plainly on the lower tier, being in the niche immediately beneath the Virgin.</NOTE> The Queen offered a reward for the apprehension of the offenders, but they were not discovered. It probably deterred them, however, from fresh excesses, for we hear no further of the cross until <datestruct value="1595--"><year reg="1595">1595</year></datestruct>. In that year the statue of the Virgin was fastened and repaired, and the next year &ldquo;a new sonne, mishapen, (as borne out of time,) all naked, was laide in her armes, the other images remaining broken as before.&rdquo; That these repairs were made reluctantly, was sufficiently evident by the ridicule attempted to be attached to them. <num value="4">Four</num> years afterwards further innovation was attempted to be made; a scaffold was employed to pull down the <hi rend=italics>wood-work</hi> at the upper part of the cross, which it was pretended had decayed, and substitute a <hi rend=italics>pyramid</hi> instead of the <hi rend=italics>crucifix;</hi> the Virgin, in consequence, was obliged to make way for the goddess Diana, &ldquo;a woman,&rdquo; says Stowe, &ldquo;(for the most part naked,) and water conveyed from the Thames, prilling from her naked breasts, but oftentimes dryed up.&rdquo;<NOTE N="g"><P>Stowe's Survaie, p. <num value="252">252</num>, ed. <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> Elizabeth disapproved of these attacks on the old religion; she thought that a plain crucifix, the mark of the faith of the country, ought not to be the occasion of any scandal, so directed <num value="1">one</num> to be placed on its summit and gilt. The city demurred, but afterwards complied. The Virgin was restored, the whole cross cleansed, and its top finished as required. The Virgin, however, was an abomination, of which they were determined to shew their abhorence; for <num value="12">twelve</num> nights afterwards she was worse used than ever, &ldquo;by plucking off her crown, and almost her head, taking from her her naked child, stabbing her in the breast,&rdquo; &amp;c.

<P>In this state the cross remained until the next year (<datestruct value="1600"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct>), when a fresh repair, or rather rebuilding, being judged necessary, the city consulted both universities whether the <hi rend=italics>crucifix</hi> should be erected again.

Quest. Whether the crosse in Cheapside should stand or be demolished. Ans. By George Abbot, Vice-chancellour of Oxford for the yeere abovesaid, as follows: 
<P>&ldquo;Concerning the question of setting up againe the crosse or other crucifix in Cheapside, I am of opinion&mdash;<num value="1">First</num>, that the godly and discreet zeal of the worthy city is much to be commended, who, on just and apparent grounds, &amp;c. have not rashly nor tumultuously proceeded therein, but are desirous to be informed by divines of the universities &mdash;what they may, and ought to doe; Secondly, howsoever it seeme <hi rend=italics>prima facie</hi>, to contain nothing of much moment in it; yet now, since the expectation of the whole Realme, and church of England is, what will become thereof, it cannot be supposed of lesse consequence, then that either our Religion, which is established according unto the Canon of the Scripture, or else that Papistry should receive a wound and blow thereby.&rdquo;&mdash;Objections. &ldquo;<num value="1">First</num> in these Crucifixes are resembled God the Father by an old man, the Holy Ghost by a dove, which are both of them unlawfull in true Divinity, Because God is a Spirit, and he himselfe forbids any similitude or shape of himself, when he gave the law&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Being then that <hi rend=italics>the image of the dove for the Holy Ghost was upon the Crosse in Cheapside</hi>, and the retayning thereof, is unlawfull; yea, <num value="1">one</num> of the highest points of Popery, whereof many learned men of their side are ashamed, I hold it a matter questionless in a reformed church, that the crosse is in no sort to be set up again, as it was before with the dove.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;And in this point I being undoubtedly and irrefragably resolved, in that same burdensome office of a Christian Magistrate, which now under my Lord, I doe beare, did upon sound and mature advice this last summer, burn and consume with fire in the market-place of Oxford, amongst others, a picture, wherein was the image of God the Father over a crucifix ready to receive the soul of Christ.&rdquo; &ldquo;The next considerable matter is for the Crucifix itself, what is to be judged of the image, and whether it may be retained at all. It is very likely it might be <num value="1">first</num> used historically, to put us in mind of Him that died for us, and inasmuch as sensible and visible things do much affect us, this memoriall might stir our devotion to remember Him by whose stripes we are healed. But, I think I may boldly say, if it had never began, the church had been freed of a great deal of superstition, which afterwards grewe to little lesse than Blasphemy. I remember in that college where I <num value="1">first</num> lived, a young man was taken, praying and beating his breast before a crucifix in a window, which caused the master and fellows to put it down, and set up other glasse; which example makes me nothing doubt, but that the cross in Cheapside hath many in the twilight and morning early, which doe reverence before it.

whose act is famous, or rather infamous for it, and I am informed, that so much hath been signified by the neighbours, or inquest making presentments, concerning the circumstances of this cause. By all which I do conclude, that it is a monument of their superstition, &amp;c. In which respect I hold it necessary that the Bishop of Canterbury, and the Bishop of London be sought unto; who doubtless, upon the sober intention of the governors of that city will be pleased, religiously and gravely, according unto their manifold wisdome which God hath given unto them, to looke into the matter and give instructions what is fittest to be done.<NOTE N="b"><P>&ldquo;Divers learned ministers then living, do report, Though the judgment of both Universities was consulted with about the Cross, and both desired it might be taken downe, yet they could not prevaile with B. Bancroft, but he would have it re-edified, only with much adoe they overswayed the bishop to leave off the picture of Christ on the Crosse, that was set on the top of it. Take notice of the zeale of the prelate in this business.&rdquo; Marginal Note.</NOTE>

<P>&ldquo;Master Vice-chancellour adds, man hath not sought for this opportunity, but God hath rather put it upon the citie, inasmuch, as the Crucifix being worn out with time, was ready to fall, there was a necessity imposed for taking it down. My advice therefore, and judgement in the name of God, is, that the Crucifix should not be erected there but that upon this opportunitie, advantage should be taken to give superstition a further blow, which will be very joyous to all that are already sincerely affected; and if there be any who truly love the Gospel, and are not yet so fully persuaded in this point, they also will in mildnesse yield to reason; if the superior power shall be pleased to give countenance to this deed of the citie. But if it should be misliked of hollow-hearted papists, or maligned by professed Recusants, it must be expected and not wondered at. Now if it shall be demanded what should be set up instead of the other monument, I think best to be some <hi rend=italics>Pyramis</hi> or matter of mere beauty, and not any angell or such like whatsoever; for although, in truth, that deserveth no reprehension, yet by avoyding of that, the mouthes of the adversaries may be stopped, who would otherwise storme and say, that the Creator is taken downe, and such a creature is set up in the place where hee stood; and whereas it is said, that evermore it will be called the Crosse in Cheapside; yet it may be possible, that time way weare out the appellation, or if it doe not, the name shall hurt no more than the name of <hi rend=italics>Christmass</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Candlemass</hi> doth.&rdquo;&mdash;GEORGE ABBOT, Vice-chancellor, anno <datestruct value="1600"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct>. <pb id="p.24" n="24">

<P>Then follow some arguments from Scripture against Cheapside Cross, as they were preached in Lombard Street. The preacher, whose name is not mentioned, in the midst of several arguments, drawn from Scripture, why idols, &amp;c. should be done away with, adds, &ldquo;You are in an especial manner, guilty of this lowd crying sin. Witnesse the Crosse in Cheapside, that is lately beautified by you. I am troubled to thinke how expressly God hath been provoked, and wrath, I feare will be poured out upon you for this same golden Crosse. You have adorned the covering of your images: now all men know that the crosse is that which the Papists make an idoll of; and yet you have not stained the covering thereof, but have beautified and adorned it. So that as a blessing came on them that stained the covering of their images, so a curse will most certainly follow the beautifying of the covering of those images of that crosse. And seeing Papists will worship a crosse at <hi rend=italics>Rome</hi>, surely they will then worship it also in <hi rend=italics>England.</hi> And you yourselves know also, what respect hath been shewed to this crosse, by popishly affected amongst us. Besides the beautifying of this crosse was a lavishing of your gold; and though you lavished it not on it, as an idoll, but as an ornament, yet it being an idoll, your gold was lavished on it as an idoll. O, this crosse, is <num value="1">one</num> of the jewells of the whore of <hi rend=italics>Rome</hi>, and it's left and kept here as a love token, and gives them hope <num value="1">one</num> day, that they shall enjoy it, and us againe.&rdquo; The printer of the pamphlet adds as a <hi rend=italics>finis</hi>, &ldquo;There is not such a superstitious monument in <hi rend=italics>Spain</hi>, France, no not in <hi rend=italics>Rome</hi>, nor in any part of the Christian worlde, as this Crosse is, as travellours report; and that we should gild it, and papists adore it on their knees (as many witnesses testifie), is abominable, wee doubt not but our worthies in the honourable Houses of Parliament, will take away the memory of it.&rdquo; 
 
<P>The new cross was, notwithstanding the above formidable protest, victorious over all opposition, and so continued for several years, as may be seen from the succeeding Plate, which exhibits that, the Little Conduit, and the south side of Cheapside, as they appeared in the year <datestruct value="1638"><year reg="1638">1638</year></datestruct>. 
<P>This curious Plate displays the greater part of the north side of Cheapside, as that of the procession of Edward the <num value="6">Sixth</num>, does the south.<NOTE N="a"><P>The original is in &ldquo;Le Serre's Entr&eacute;e Royalle de la Reyne Mere du Roy,&rdquo; fol. <datestruct value="1639--"><year reg="1639">1639</year></datestruct>&mdash;a book of very great scarcity and price. This print itself is worth from <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="4">four</num> guineas.</NOTE> It contains some remarkable objects exclusive of the crosse and conduit, which have not been generally pointed out. The most interesting of these is the church of St. Peter-le-Chepe, destroyed in the great fire, and of which there is no other representation extant. This stood at the corner of Wood Street, immediately opposite the cross. A little lower down, at the corner of Milk Street, is a very large house, of a most antique appearance, having a castellated front with corbel towers, and no doubt, at <num value="1">one</num> time, the residence of some considerable person. On the right hand is the celebrated Nag's Head tavern,<NOTE N="b"><P>This tavern was the pretended scene of the consecration of the <num value="1">first</num> Protestant archbishop, Parker, in the reign of Elizabeth. See the whole story refuted in Strype's Life of that prelate, pages <num value="55">55</num>, <num value="56">56</num> and <num value="57">57</num>.</NOTE> which stood at the corner of Friday Street. The other objects, peculiar to the occasion, are the various decorations in the fronts of the shops in honour of the illustrious stranger who is making her public entry.<NOTE N="c"><P>Every mark of respect and attention was shewn by the citizens on this joyous occasion. Bands of music, discharges of artillery, and ringing of bells, every where announced the happy event. This appears from the following entry in the ward-book of Cornhill: 
<P>&ldquo;Paid the ringers at the coming in of the Queene's mother, by order of Mr. Alderman, <num value="00">00</num> <num value="06">06</num> <num value="00">00</num>.&rdquo; 
<P>The particulars respecting this splendid procession will be best understood by an extract from the tract to which the original print belongs. 
<P>&ldquo;The Lord Mayor of London, having received the King's orders, before his departure from London, to make the preparatives for this entry, acquitted himself at the time very worthily. He caused immediately to be erected on <num value="1">one</num> side in the great street of London, for above a league in leugth, benches with backs and enriched with balusters <num value="3">three</num> feet high, all covered over equally with blue cloth, and commanded all the companies or fraternities of the different trades, in all amounting to <num value="50">fifty</num>, to appear in the citizen's gowns, with trimmings of marten skin, sitting on the benches the day of the entry, and every company to have its banner with their arms, in order that they might be distinguished <num value="1">one</num> from the other, when all assembled; which was executed. 
<P>&ldquo;<num value="6000">Six thousand</num> soldiers,<NOTE N="*"><P>The trained Bands.</NOTE> chosen and belonging to the City, separated in divers companies, every <num value="1">one</num> having their proper officers, all being gentlemen, were destined to form a haye or line on the other side of the street, all armed richly, some with musquets and others with pikes. And although the shops, the balconies and the windows, were to be filled anew with a great number of ladies, there were orders to hang tapestry on the houses nevertheless, according to the discretion of the owners, being well assured that all parties would endeavour to shew their zeal by their magnificence; insomuch that though this great street contained in its length many other streets, the different merchants of the <num value="1">one</num> and the other ornamented it so richly, and every <num value="1">one</num> according to their own invention, that nothing more sumptuous nor more superb could be seen. This place was dressed up with woven tapestry, that with Flemish or embroidery; <num value="1">one</num> with Chinese, and another with Indian tapestry; the scareity of which made it inestimable. The street of the drapers was hung on both sides with scarlet, which was worthy to be remarked; and the other streets of the suburbs of the city, and of the same extent, were differently ornamented.&rdquo; 
<P>Our object being merely to shew the cross, and other public buildings, we have not given the whole of this procession, which, with a continuation of private houses occupies a much greater length in the original print. A part of the King's coach is seen, with himself and the Queen-mother seated therein. The account describes it as being &ldquo;covered with crimson velvet, embroidered with gold both within and without, and drawn by <num value="6">six</num> horses of great price.&rdquo; &ldquo;A litter with the same covering, and embroidered with gold, carried by <num value="2">two</num> mules, superbly harnessed,&rdquo; follows the royal carriage. &ldquo;The coaches of the maids of honour, of the women of the chamber, the gentlemen domestics and pensioners, as also those of the officers of His Majesty, came afterwards with an infinite number of others.&rdquo;</NOTE>

<P>In comparing the representation of the cross in this print with the preceding <num value="1">one</num> in Plate II. a very material difference is perceptible. This is to be accounted for, not so much for its age, as from the various repairs it underwent in consequence of continued attacks, similar to those before noticed, and which gave it a most battered appearance. In the night of the <datestruct VALUE="1641-01-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month> <year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>, it was still further defaced, and became so much an object of contention as to occasion the publication of numerous pamphlets.<NOTE N="d"><P>&ldquo;The resolution of those Contemners that will no Crosses.&rdquo; <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>.

<P>This Dialogue is extremely contemptible, and a mere quibbling on words. As a specimen, take the following: 
<P>Cheap Cross, at the beginning of the Dialogue, says, she is so crossed that she fears her utter ruin and destruction is at hand. To which Charing Cross replies, &ldquo;Sister of Westcheap, crosses are incident to us, and all our children.&rdquo; Cheap Cross then proceeds thus: &ldquo;Happy are you, and long may you so continue.&rdquo; 
<P>CHARING CROSS. &lsquo;But what's the greatest cross that hath befallen you?&rdquo; 
<P>CHEAP. &ldquo;Nay, Sister, if my <hi rend=italics>cross</hi> were fallen, I should live in a great deal more heart's-ease than I do.&rdquo; 
<P>CHARING. &ldquo;I believe it is the <hi rend=italics>cross</hi> upon your head, that hath brought you into this trouble, is it not?&rdquo; 
<P>The next is styled, 
<P>&ldquo;The doleful Lamentation of Cheapside Cross; or, Old England sick of the Staggers. The dissenting and disagreeing in matters of opinion, together with the sundry sorts of sects now raving and reigning, being the maine causes of the disturbance and hinderance of the commonwealth.&rdquo; Cut of the Cross. <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>. (<num value="8">8</num> pages.) 
<P>P. <num value="2">2</num>. Speaking of the sectaries of the day, the author, in apology, says, 
<P>&ldquo;These sects can endure no crosse but that on silver, and for <hi rend=italics>Cheapside-Crosse</hi> it is the abomination of the city, and surplesses are smocks of the whore of Rome; and every thing, though never so laudable, and decent, and necessary, if contrary to their opinion, is by them accounted profane. They like none but sanctified, and shuttleheaded weavers, long-winded box-makers, and thorow-stitching cobblers, thumping felt-makers, jerkin coachmen, and round-headed button-makers, which spoyle Bibles, while they thumbe over the leaves with their greasie fingers, and sit by the fire scumming their porridge-pot, while their zeal seethes over in applications and interpretations of Scriptures, delivered to their as ignorant wives and handmaids, with the name and title of dear brethren, and especially beloved sisters.&rdquo; 
<P>This tract concludes with 
<P>&ldquo;<hi rend=italics>The doleful Lamentation of</hi> CHEAPSIDE-<hi rend=italics>Crosse</hi>, which was basely abused and wronged.&rdquo; 
<P>&ldquo;I, <hi rend=italics>Jasper Crosse</hi>, scituated in <hi rend=italics>Cheapside, London</hi>, upon Munday night, being the <num value="24">24</num> of <hi rend=italics>Januarie</hi>, the signe being in the head and face, which made me the more suffer; and in the yeare <num value="1640">one thousand six hundred forty</num> and <num value="1">one</num>, when almost everie man is to seek a new religion; and being then high water at <hi rend=italics>London</hi> Bridge, as their braines and heads were full of malice and envy; I the foresaid <hi rend=italics>Jasper Crosse</hi> was assaulted and battered in the King's highway, by many violent and insolent minded people, or rather ill-affected brethren; and whether they were in their height of zeale, or else overcome with passion, or new wine lately come from <hi rend=italics>New England</hi>, I cannot be yet resolved; but this I am sure, and it may bee plainly seen by all that passe by me, that I was much abused and defaced, by a sort of people which I cannot terme better than a mad and giddy-headed multitude, who were gathered together from all parts, to wrong my antiquity, and antient renowned name, so much spoken of in forraine parts. Had I ever done these my brethren the least offence, I should be sorrie, and am still willing to submit and referre myself to the grave and most just senators now assembled. Love and charity, these my brethren had none at all; for what benefit or credite did it bring to them to come by night like theeves, to steale from me here a leg, there a head, here an arm, and there a nose; they did all goe away from me, the Crosse, without profit: they have not done me so much dishonour as they have done themselves, and the honourable city, whose civill government is a patterne to all nations. But I will tell you, my crosse brethren, you both at that time wanted wit and money; wit to govern your hot and over-boyling zeale, and crosse money to pay your land-lord's rent: that is a crosse to you, not I and so wanting such crosses as those, would bee revenged of mee, to satisfie your malitious crosse-humours; I am but your stocking-horse, and colour for your future malice, your rage will not cease though you should pull mee downe, and make me levill with the ground. And when so done, then you wil cry out that there be crosses in the goldsmiths' shops, which is plate and jewels, standing upon crosse shelves, those be the crosses you intend, tho your pretence be otherwaies: Next the mercer's shops whose satten and velvet lie acrosse, and whose counters are acrosse their shops. Then the next crosses which you will finde fault withall, will bee with those rich monied men, whose bags lye crosse in their chests; then with their wives, if they bee handsome, which you will make to be crosses too, in a short space I say, deare brethren, if you be suffered to pull downe all that are acrosse you will dare to pull a magistrate off his horse, because he rides acrosse his horseback, and pull his chain to pieces because it hangs acrosse his shoulders; and if a miller's horse come to market with a sack of corne acrosse his horseback, and if you say it is acrosse, you then violently wil run and pul it down and share it as you have done part of me the crosse. And at length then our churches will prove crosses to you, specially if they have bin builded in Popish times, and so in processe of time every thing will be a crosse to you that you either love or hate; But I will conclude with this caution, that as long as we have such cross people, crosse every way especially to majistrates and men of authority, and still go unpunished, we shall alwaies have such crosse doings, and so I poore <hi rend=italics>Jeffrey Crosse</hi>, leave you to your crosse wives and your owne crosse opinions.&rdquo; 
<P>Immediately on the publication of the above there appeared,

<P>This tract has the same good vignette as the preceding, viz. a poor representation of the cross, as given in our <num value="2">second</num> Plate. 
<P>&ldquo;Forasmuch as some have undertaken to oppose (by word and deed) such as desired the abolishing of all images, more especially that of Cheapside Crosse, shewing that it is an ornament to the city, and of antiquity, which reasons are of no great consequence; we desire to give you some reasons why wee desire the extirpation of it and all such like.&rdquo; 
<P>The author proceeds with a few arguments similar to those of Archbishop Abbot, in the Tract <num value="1">first</num> quoted, and adds, 
<P>&ldquo;Besides being smoake to our own eyes, it is prejudicial to others. It wil be an occasion to keepe them from comming in to looke for Christ in an invisible way so long as they see him in a visible, it is credibly reported that some have been sent to worship that crosse. Therefore you that plead for it, your grounds cannot be good, it is a fitter ornament for <hi rend=italics>Rome</hi> or some such place, (I meane whilst the image and crosse remained on it) than for this city.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yet I do not say that it is so fit for every <num value="1">one</num> to pull them downe, but them in authority, as, thanks be to God, the Parliament have took it into consideration, and commanded that all in churches should down, and so now also the rest, for which happy Parliament let our prayers and praises be continued to God alwayes.&rdquo;<NOTE N="a"><P>Then succeeds the following poor attempt at versification.

<P>&ldquo;The aforesaid <hi rend=italics>Jasper</hi> having suffered much by losse of his members from his body, your delayes of reliefe have prooved very prejudicial to his health: for being (as I suppose) put into a heat by that suddaine encounter, and then being exposed to the violence of the weather, and a cold piercing unto his bodie through the open pores, and not bleeding currantly, I feare it festers inwardly, whereby many radicall humours are congealed therein, that in respect of his age, his disease, (occasioned by their delayes, and obnoxions), will prove very desperately incurable, without <num value="1">one</num> medicine can bee procured to apply to him, and that is a parliamentarie playster, as a preservative of his life.

<P>&ldquo;It is an easier task to reckon up all the species and several kinds of nature, then to describe all the sects, divisions and opinions in religion that are now in and about this kingdom and city of London; so that whereas there is but <num value="1">one</num> truth, and <num value="1">one</num> way guiding thereunto; the people of our land cannot agree about this <num value="1">one</num> way: but errours and scisme being multiplied manifold, they can all finde out those waies to a haire; so that the times remaine still as corrupt in manners as ever any age heretofore ever did. But I will leave all particular vices which are too common and frequent amongst us in these our dayes, and come to the subject in hand, namely, the complaint of Cheapside-Crosse, which it makes in its own defence before it suffers its decay or ruine, hearing that it must be pulled down. &ldquo;And now to see the misery of a high fortune, I that was so stout and glorious, and did not looke for a fall, am now become the hateful idoll of the city: I cannot speake much, being of <hi rend=italics>stone</hi>, but I will give you a brief expression of my antiquity; King <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> was the <num value="1">first</num> that built me, and many more crosses in severall townes at the death of good Queen <hi rend=italics>Elenor</hi>, and in <hi rend=italics>Anno</hi> <datestruct value="1441--"><year reg="1441">1441</year></datestruct>. I was repaired in beautifull manner; then sixe <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">thousand</num> pounds</measure> was given to my new erecting, and I have beene so often guelded (<hi rend=italics>gilded</hi>) at many times that I am sorry to thinke that all my glory should now be laid in the dust; but I am not the greatest that have fallen; but now it is no time for me to bable out my griefes, Time with all his houres and yeares shall lament me and my violent undoing. 
<P>&ldquo;But give me leave in my anger to expresse my mind. &rsquo;T is some body was my enemy, and I cannot tell who it was; but I can gesse well, down I must, and go even flat with the earth, and then I am sure that they will not remember me. I was glorious in many Kings' reigns and esteemed well in Queene Elizabeth's dayes, beautified at King <hi rend=italics>James</hi> his coming into England, and againe at King <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> his coming to the crowne. And I am now accounted for a Papist, all my antiquity is lost from time to time, which if I should mention would weary you with the relation. I am esteemed and held not fit to have my abiding in the citie, I am called by the name of the <hi rend=italics>Citie Idoll;</hi> the Brownists spit at me, and throw stones at mee, as they come along the streete, the Famalists hide their eyes with their fingers, the Anabaptists wish me to be knockt in pieces, as I am like to be this day; the sisters of the fraternity will not come near me, but go about by Watling Street, and come in againe by Soaper Lane to buy their provisions of the market-folkes. Oh these and the like occasions have grieved and tormented my whole fabricke, I guesse the cause, that I am now to be ruinated and quite pulled down. It is the <hi rend=italics>crosse</hi> that stands upon my head that is a moate in my eyes. Nay, they doe not onely say that I am an idoll, but that I am a supporter of idols because divers images are placed about me, but I feel myselfe now sicke, nay sick at heart, and I groane under the burthen of my own fabricke, for I hear and am certainly told <hi rend=italics>that I am to be pulled downe and defaced this morning.</hi>
Oh I feele the pangs of death come upon me, I shall never see the end of the merry month of May, my breath is at a period, my life is gone, for I feel myselfe a dying downwards, my head being the <num value="1">first</num> part that doth loose the sense, my tongue rattles in my throat.&rdquo; And just as the crosse had so said, he presently dyed; whereupon his executors hearing of it, came in; and would have him embalmed; and they <num value="1">first</num> strook off his head, and so by degrees descended to other parts of the body and left him like a sceleton or an anatomy of his body or corpes <hi rend=italics>by <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="11">eleven</num> a clock at noone.</hi> With that his executors looking about, found his will which he had got, being written in this manner. 
<emph>&ldquo;Jesper Crosse, <hi rend=italics>his last Will.</hi></emph>

<P>&ldquo;&lsquo;In <hi rend=italics>primis</hi>, I desire to be taken downe in a decent round manner, and that no spoile be made of my fabricke; &lsquo;for some parts of mee be worth mony. 
<P>&ldquo;&lsquo;<hi rend=italics>Item</hi>, I pray my executors to be civill, and that they have a care that no hurt be done at my demolishing. 
<P>&ldquo;&lsquo;<hi rend=italics>Item</hi>, The gold which I am gilded withall I appoint to be fled (flayed) and taken off by those persons which &lsquo;will give most mony for me. 
<P>&ldquo;&lsquo;<hi rend=italics>Item</hi>, I give to the red-coate souldiers all the lead which is about me to make bullets if occasion be; if not I &lsquo;give it to the company of plummers to make cesternes and pumps with, or else jacke weights. <pb id="p.28" n="28"> 
<P>&ldquo;&lsquo;<hi rend=italics>Item</hi>, I give my iron-worke to those people which make good swords at Hounslow, <hi rend=italics>for I am all Spanish &lsquo;iron, and steele to the backe.</hi>

<P>&ldquo;&lsquo;<hi rend=italics>Item</hi>, I give my body and stones to those masons and workemen that cannot tell how to frame the like &lsquo;againe, to keep by them for a patterne for in time there will bee more crosses in London than ever there was &lsquo;yet, &amp;c. 
<P>&ldquo;&lsquo;<hi rend=italics>Item</hi>, I give my ground whereon I stood to be a free market-place, hoping that no more people will goe round as they have used to do about me; but will be content to speake well of me hereafter, because I suffer so roundly and so patiently for my errours.

<P>&ldquo;This crosse in Cheapside was <num value="1">first</num> erected as I have said by <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> the <num value="1">First</num>, in commemoration of his Queene whose name was <hi rend=italics>Ellenor.</hi> Secondly, it was then builded for an ornament to the city, being placed in the chiefest place or streete of the said city, and therefore was thought and held at that time for a glorious fabricke, and would continue there for antiquity sake, rather than to give an occasion of offence to any. It hath now stood near upon <num value="400">400</num> or <num value="500">five hundred</num> yeares, still repaired and beautified, but never suffered martyrdom till now; it hath beene

<emph>&ldquo;<hi rend=italics>The Reason why</hi> Cheapside-<hi rend=italics>Crosse was pulled downe.</hi></emph>

<P>&ldquo;Because it is in its own structure a monument of idolatry, and may better suite well with an idolatrous place as <hi rend=italics>Rome</hi> and such like places, then for this ciuill citie, wherein so much preaching and teaching of God's word is used. Again, that many people by nature desire a visible God; also that it occasions a many from comming to looke for Christ in an invisible way, so long as they can see him visible. Besides, divers ignorant people who have been misled and misinformed in the Protestant religion, have by such like images been seduced and made believe that praying to severall saints, desiring them and instigating them, that they would solicite and speake to our Saviour in their behalfe, that our Saviour would make intercession to his Father for the mitigation, and for the forgiveness of their sins; this opinion of their's is very vaine, idle and ridiculous; and a great sin committed against God himself; robbing and taking away his honour due unto him; and giving it to creatures; as to the saints and angells, in worshipping pictures, crucifixes, and such like traditions and inventions of men; so this crosse hath been a great meanes to cause superstition and idolatry from time to time in worshipping and adoring it, as many people have done as they passe by it; for divers people both men and women hath been seen by severall honest, ancient, and good inhabitants dwelling neare the place, that sundry sorts of people have by <num value="3">three</num> o'clock in the morning come barefoot to the crosse, andhave kneeled downe, and said something to themselves, crossed their forehead and their breast, and so risen and making obeysance, went away, which punishment was enjoyned upon them as a penance for some sins they had committed: Likewise that hundreds of people have been publickly seen, and in the midst of the day, to bend their bodies to it, and put off their hats, and crosse themselves: not only as they have gone on foot by it, but divers that have rid on horseback, and in coaches have put out their heads and pulled off their hats and done reverence to it; this hath bin done for these many yeares together, and it hath been offensive to many good Christians to behold such idolatrous worship given to a crosse, and to images, and pictures, insomuch that it hath been often complained on by divers godly ministers, not only in their publicke sermons, but also in their printed books; shewing the unlawfulnesse of it; therefore seeing no redresse or helpe for the suppression of it; the common counsell of London did petition to the Honourable Houses of Parliament for reliefe in this case, which was soon granted, and had a warrant to take it downe, by all the faire meanes they could devise, calling to their ayd the trained bands of the city for their defence, because no uproare might arise thereby, and that no bloud might be spilt; because divers people had given out they would rather lose their lives than it should down: down it must, and it is so ordered to be taken downe that the materials may be made usefull other ways, and that they should be sold for a valuable consideration, the materials being most <hi rend=italics>lead, iron</hi>, and <hi rend=italics>stone;</hi> some report that divers of the crownes and sceptres are <hi rend=italics>silver;</hi> besides the rich <hi rend=italics>gold</hi> that it is guilded with, which, as it is reported, may be filed and taken off, and yield a good value; so that divers which have offered, some <measure value="400l." type=currency><num value="400">400</num>l.</measure> some <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">500</num>l.</measure> But they that bid must offer a <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1000</num>l.</measure> for it; and so this <hi rend=italics>Tuesday</hi> it is a taking down with a great deal of judgement and discretion, and foure companies of the trained bands of the city to guarde and defend those that are about the worke, and to keepe others from domineering, and so I leave it to bee made levell with the ground this <num value="2">second</num> day of <hi rend=italics>May</hi>

<P>The plot of ground termed Scotland Yard, was <num value="1">first</num> given by Edgar, King of England (who reigned from <num value="959">959</num> to <num value="975">975</num>) to Keneth, or Kynald, King of Scotland, from whom he had received homage for that kingdom; and he enjoined the said Keneth, once every year to repair unto him in England, for the making of laws, which in those days was done by the noblemen and peers. To which end Edgar gave that King this piece of ground, lying beside the new palace of Westminster; upon which Keneth built a house for his residence when he came up. This house was enjoyed by him and his successors until the reign of Henry II, in whose time, upon the rebellion of William then King of Scots, it was resumed into the hands of the King of England. After that, the house went to decay, but the ground where it stood, ever after retained the name of Scotland, which is preserved to this time, in that of Scotland Yard; though now (<datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>) nearly covered with magnificent modern buildings. 
<P>Margaret, Queen of Scotland, eldest sister of Henry VIII, on the death of her husband James IV, slain at Flodden Field in <datestruct value="1513--"><year reg="1513">1513</year></datestruct>, returned into England, and took up her residence at this place; by which it seems to have been considered as belonging to the royal line of Scotland exclusively, and kept distinct from any other place for their particular use and accommodation. 
<P>Scotland Yard possessed the privileges and immunities of a royal palace, no person could be arrested for debt within its precinct and jurisdiction; the liberties of which extended from the bank of the Thames at the bottom of Northumberland Street, Strand, to the corner of Downing Street, Whitehall. According to the plan of Whitehall Palace, taken by John Fisher, in <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>, and engraved by Virtue, in <datestruct value="1747--"><year reg="1747">1747</year></datestruct>, it appears that it extended along the river, and in front along the present Parliament Street and Whitehall Street, to the turning into Spring Garden beyond the Admiralty, leading into St. James' Park. 
<P><num value="3">Three</num> fourths of the inhabitants of Scotland Yard, and about Charing Cross, within the verge of the court, were composed of persons in a state of insolvency, who sought a refuge here under the protection of the Board of Green Cloth, to protect them against arrest, and other legal proceedings of their creditors. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1696--"><year reg="1696">1696</year></datestruct>, several places in and about the city of London, which in the times of popery had been allowed as sanctuaries to criminals and debtors, had ever since the Reformation pretended to a privilege of protecting the latter; no officers daring without a hazard of their lives, to arrest the lawless debtors that took refuge in them. <num value="1">One</num> of these, Whitefriars, which lay in the very heart of the metropolis, was become a notorious receptacle of broken and desperate men, where to the dishonour of Government, and to the great prejudice of the community, they defended themselves against all justice and public authority.<NOTE N="*"><P>Tindal, <num value="349">349</num>.</NOTE> This intolerable mischief the parliament redressed by an act, &ldquo;For the more effectual relief of creditors in cases of escapes, and for preventing abuses in prisons and pretended privileged places<NOTE N="*"><P>Stat. <num value="8">8</num> and <num value="9">9</num> Wm. III. c. <num value="27">27</num>.</NOTE>.&rdquo; By this statute the following places of pretended privilege were suppressed, viz., that in the Minories; those in and near Fleet Street, as Salisbury Court, Whitefriars, Ram Alley, and Mitre Court; in Holborn, Fulwood's Rents, and Baldwyn's Gardens in Gray's Inn Lane; in the Strand, the Savoy; in Southwark, Montague Close, Deadman's Place, the Clink, and the Mint: yet this last named place, the Mint, was afterwards suffered to spring up again in a more outrageous manner than ever before; and was not finally suppressed until the reign of George I.<NOTE N="*"><P>Anderson, vol. ii. p. <num value="220">220</num>.</NOTE>

<P>Scotland Yard continued to be a sanctuary to debtors, under the sanction of the Board of Green Cloth, until a short time previous to the riots in the year <datestruct value="1780"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Henrietta Maria, queen of Charles I, upon the restoration of her son, Charles II, to the crown of England, came to London, and having settled her revenues here, returned into France with her youngest daughter, Henrietta Anne, whom she bestowed in marriage to Philip, duke of Orleans, only brother of Lewis XIV. In <datestruct VALUE="1662-07--"><month reg="07">July</month> <year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>, she came again into England, and settled her court at Somerset House, where she resided till <datestruct VALUE="1665-05--"><month reg="05">May</month> <year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>, and then crossed the sea to her native country, which after <num value="4">four</num> years more became the place of her death. <NOTE N="*"><P>Sandford's Genealogical History, Edit. <datestruct value="1707--"><year reg="1707">1707</year></datestruct>, p. <num value="595">595</num>.</NOTE>

<P>The Queen's Treasury was situate in the middle of Scotland Yard, close on the bank of the river; the passage represented in the west view of the building, over which hangs a lamp, led to the walled terrace, exhibited in front of the east view, which in fine weather formed an agreeable and pleasant promenade to those inhabitants who were indulged in the liberty of access, affording a commanding prospect of the river, as high as Lambeth Palace, and downward to the Tower, including views of St. Paul's cathedral and numerous other churches and public buildings. 
<P>The vignette to the left, which represents a part of Whitehall destroyed by fire in the year <datestruct value="1797"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>, is the entrance of the passage to the privy stairs, where Charles I usually took water; that of the corresponding vignette is of an ancient window of the palace, evidently of the time of Henry VIII, and similar with some of those still remaining in St. James' Palace, erected in the reign of that king. 
<P>The part of the building which formed the Queen's Treasury, as taken from the river Thames, and represented in the upper view, consists of the arched door and square window on the basement story, with the <num value="12">twelve</num> windows above, <num value="4">four</num> on each floor. The adjoining house, now the Almonry Office, was formerly the Treasury of the late Princess Dowager of Wales, and was occupied by the treasurer's clerk until the year <datestruct value="1805"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>, when it was granted to the late Queen Charlotte, for the office of her secretary and comptroller, and was occupied by the secretary and comptroller's clerk, until the end of the year <datestruct value="1820"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>.&mdash;The west front represented in the lower view, with the soldiers relieving guard, is that of the <num value="2">two</num> houses prior to the removal of the brick wall, which divided the building; the door by the sentry box is the entrance to the Almonry Office; but no military duty is there at present performed. 
<P>The <num value="1">first</num> institution of this place, as the Queen's Treasury, was for the use of Queen Caroline, consort to George II. and continued in the occupation of gentlemen belonging to the office, till the arrival of the late Queen Charlotte, when it was granted to her Majesty for her treasury, and continued as such until her demise. 
<P>The house that was the Queen's Treasury, is now occupied by Mr. Dalgleish, and that of the Almonry Office, by Mr. Handby. The present appearance of these <num value="2">two</num> houses forms a striking contrast to the magnificent edifices recently erected in their vicinity. <pb id="p.31" n="31">

<P>IN various quarters of England, particularly in the southern, and consequently the warmer districts, as in Essex, Surrey, Deson, &amp;c. are found places commonly denominated <hi rend=italics>Cold Harbour.</hi> Nor are those places, by their local position, so peculiarly exposed to the inclemency of the weather, as to be distinguished by that denomination from all other places in their vicinity. In the heart of the City of London itself, on the sheltered northern banks of the Thames, is also a spot now and for centuries known by a similar appellation; and formerly celebrated as the residence of some of the most eminent personages of the kingdom. 
<P>Cold Harbour just mentioned, abutting on the river Thames (near the Steel Yard, the ancient residence of the merchants of Almaine or the Hanse Towns), is mentioned as originally the hall or inn (Herebrough) of the Cologne merchants, or &ldquo;Men of Colen,&rdquo; as they were termed in old writings, from which <hi rend=italics>it might have been</hi> called Colen or Coln Harbrough, and from whence the corruptions of Cole and Cold Harbour were probably derived, and not, as Maitland supposes, from its bleak cold situation. 
<P>Malcolm, in his Londinium Redivivum, in unison with a writer in the Gentleman's Magazine, vol. lxiii. p. <num value="603">603</num>, also supposes <hi rend=italics>Cold Harbour</hi> to be a corruption of a German word, signifying &ldquo;an inn,&rdquo; and that the neighbourhood of the Steel Yard makes it probable. 
<P>A late intelligent writer in the Morning Herald of <datestruct VALUE="1822-10-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> <month reg="10">October</month> <year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>, also confirms this opinion. 
<P>It was deserted by its original proprietors the merchants of Cologne, before the reign of Edward the <num value="2">Second</num>. 
<P>The earliest notice we have of this place on record is, that in the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> year of Edward II. anno <datestruct value="1320"><year reg="1320">1320</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>Sir John Abel, Knt.</hi> demised or let unto 
<hi rend=italics>Henry Stow</hi>, draper, all that his capital messuage called <hi rend=italics>Cold Harborough</hi> in the parish of <hi rend=italics>All Saints ad f&oelig;num</hi>, and all the purtenances within the gate, with the key which Robert Hartford, citizen, son to William Hartford, had and ought to have; and the aforesaid Robert paid for it the rent of <num value="33">33</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> the year. This Robert Hartford being owner thereof, as also of other lands in Surrey, deceasing without issue male, left <num value="2">two</num> daughters his coheirs, to wit, <hi rend=italics>Idonea</hi>, married to Sir <hi rend=italics>Ralph Bigot</hi>, and <hi rend=italics>Maud</hi> married to Sir <hi rend=italics>Stephen Cosenton</hi> (knights), between whom the said house and lands were divided. After the which, <hi rend=italics>John Bigot</hi>, son to the said Sir <hi rend=italics>Ralph</hi>, and Sir <hi rend=italics>John Cosenton</hi>, did sell their moieties of <hi rend=italics>Cold Harborough</hi> unto Sir <hi rend=italics>John de Poultney</hi>, son of <hi rend=italics>Adam de Poultney</hi>, the <num value="8">eighth</num> of Edward III, anno <datestruct value="1335"><year reg="1335">1335</year></datestruct>. This Sir <hi rend=italics>John Poultney</hi> dwelling in this house, and being <num value="4">four</num> times Mayor of London, the said house took the name of <hi rend=italics>Poultney's Inn.</hi>

<P>Sir <hi rend=italics>John Poultney</hi> removing to an adjacent residence within the parish of St. Lawrence Poultney, or Pountney, he, in the <num value="21">twenty-first</num> of Edward III, anno <datestruct value="1348"><year reg="1348">1348</year></datestruct>, by his charter, gave and confirmed to <hi rend=italics>Humfrey de Bohun</hi>, Earl of Hereford and Essex, his whole tenement called <hi rend=italics>Cold Harborough</hi>, with all the appurtenances sometime pertaining to <hi rend=italics>Robert de Hartford</hi>, on the way called <hi rend=italics>Hay Wharf Lane</hi>, &amp;c. for <num value="1">one</num> rose at <hi rend=italics>Midsummer</hi> to him and his heirs, for all services, if the same were demanded.

<P><hi rend=italics>Philip St. Clear</hi> gave <num value="2">two</num> messuages pertaining to this <hi rend=italics>Cold Harborough</hi> in the Ropery, towards the enlarging of the church and churchyard of 
<hi rend=italics>All Saints</hi> called the <hi rend=italics>less</hi>, in the <num value="20">twentieth</num> of <hi rend=italics>Richard II.</hi> anno. <datestruct value="1396"><year reg="1396">1396</year></datestruct>.

It was then counted a right fair and stately house. But in the year following, <hi rend=italics>Edmond</hi>, Earl of Cambridge, another of the royal brothers, had it, and was there lodged in the year <datestruct value="1398"><year reg="1398">1398</year></datestruct>.

<P>In <datestruct value="1410--"><year reg="1410">1410</year></datestruct>, Henry IV granted this house to his son, <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> Prince of Wales, by the title of <hi rend=italics>quoddam hospitium sive placeam</hi> (vocatum le <hi rend=italics>Coldherbergh</hi>) for the term of his life, and in the same year (to stock his cellars) gave him an order on the Collector of the Customs for <num value="20">twenty</num> casks and <num value="1">one</num> pipe of red wine of <hi rend=italics>Gascogny</hi>, and that without payment of any duty. 
<P>In the <num value="26">twenty-sixth</num> year of Henry VI, anno <datestruct value="1448"><year reg="1448">1448</year></datestruct>, it belonged to H. <hi rend=italics>Holland</hi>, Duke of <hi rend=italics>Exeter</hi>, and he was lodged there in the year <datestruct value="1472"><year reg="1472">1472</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1483--"><year reg="1483">1483</year></datestruct>. Richard III, by his letters patent, granted and gave to <hi rend=italics>Johna Writhe</hi>, alias Garter principal King of Arms of <hi rend=italics>Englishmen</hi>, and the rest of the King's Heralds and Pursevants of Arms, all that messuage with the appurtenances, called <hi rend=italics>Cold Erber</hi>, in the parish of <hi rend=italics>All Saints</hi> in <hi rend=italics>London</hi>, and their successors for ever, dated at <hi rend=italics>Westminster</hi>, the <num value="2">2</num>d of <hi rend=italics>March</hi> <datestruct value="1483--"><year reg="1483">1483</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>anno regni sui primo</hi>, without fine or fee. Their stay here was short. After Richard's fall at Bosworth, this grant of <hi rend=italics>Cold Harbour</hi> was annulled, and the Heralds obtained with difficulty, permission from the successor to sojourn for a time in the religious house of St. Mary of Rounceval at Charing Cross, where they remained till Edward VI granted the site to a family of Carwarden. Soon after the Heralds' removal from thence, Philip and Mary, by a charter, dated the <datestruct VALUE="-07-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct> in the <num value="1">first</num> and <num value="3">third</num> of their reign, granted to them Derby House in the parish of St. Benet, Paul's Wharf, where they still remain. After the removal of the Heralds' company from Cold Harbour, it became the temporary residence of the celebrated Margaret, Countess of Richmond, mother of Henry VII, who, on occasion of the marriage of Prince Arthur with Catharine of Arragon, entertained here the Lord Mayor and his brethren, with a variety of sports and devices; after which &ldquo;they were ensyrved after the right goodly maner bothe of their vitalls and delicates, and with divers wines abundant and plenteously.&rdquo; 
<P>In the reign of Henry VIII, the Bishop of Durham's house near <hi rend=italics>Charing Cross</hi> being taken into the King's hands, <hi rend=italics>Cuthbert Tunstall</hi>, Bishop of 
<hi rend=italics>Durham</hi>, was lodged in Cold Harbour. 
<P>Since the which time it belonged for a long time to the Earls of <hi rend=italics>Shrewsbury</hi>, and changed its name to Shrewsbury House. 
<P>The last deceased Earl took it partly down, and in place thereof builded a great number of small tenements, let out for great rents to people of all sorts. 
<P>This great house Bishop <hi rend=italics>Tunstall</hi> enjoyed even to the last year of King Edward VI, that is to the year <datestruct value="1553"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>; when the Bishop being under a cloud and deposed from his bishoprick, they took from him this house also, which the King granted to the Earl of <hi rend=italics>Shrewsbury</hi>, with the appurtenances to the said messuage belonging, together with <num value="6">six</num> houses or tenements, in the parish of St. <hi rend=italics>Dunstan's</hi> in the <hi rend=italics>East</hi>, and divers other lands in the County of York, to him and his heirs, to the yearly value of <num value="66">66</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="16">16</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="1">1</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> The date of the patent was the <num value="30">30th</num> of <hi rend=italics>June</hi>, the King dying but <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num> days after. For the Duke of <hi rend=italics>Northumberland</hi>, who now did all at Court, practised to gain as many of the nobility as he could to his purpose, and so this gratification was made to the Earl of Shrewsbury, as were divers others of the nobility in other respects gratified. 
<P>What title the Earls of <hi rend=italics>Shrewsbury</hi> had in former times to <hi rend=italics>Cold Harbour</hi> is not known, but it appears by letters (dated from thence), that that house was inhabited by them and their servants long before, namely, not far from the beginning of the reign of Henry VIII. George the <num value="6">sixth</num> Earl of Shrewsbury was in great favour and highly confided in by Queen Elizabeth, who, in the <num value="11">eleventh</num> year of her reign, intrusted to his charge the person of Mary Queen of Scots, whom he kept in safe custody from <datestruct value="1568--"><year reg="1568">1568</year></datestruct> till <datestruct value="1584"><year reg="1584">1584</year></datestruct>. Camden, speaking of this nobleman says, &ldquo;In those ticklish times he made a shift to assert his honour, and made good his trust for <num value="15">fifteen</num> years together, against all the machinations and slanders of the court party, and the ill conduct of his <num value="2">second</num> wife, to such a degree, that he left behind him the double character of a wise and faithful statesman and a brave and worthy commander. Indeed, the Earl himself was aware of the nest of enemies he had to contend with; and to inform posterity in what manner he had conducted himself through an arduous and trying duty to his sovereign and country, he caused to be erected (in his lifetime) a noble monument at Sheffield, where he was afterwards buried, on which is a Latin inscription, which sets forth, &lsquo;that he was descended from an unblemished and noble stock before the Norman conquest; that as he excelled in mind, so was he skilled in affairs of war. In Scotland, when, on those troubles that happened there, he was sent thither with <num value="3000">three thousand</num> forces, he came away with the character of a brave and gallant soldier, as afterwards he did when he came from <hi rend=italics>Berwick.</hi> On the arrival of Mary Queen of <hi rend=italics>Scots</hi> in <hi rend=italics>England</hi>, she was put under his care anno <datestruct value="1568"><year reg="1568">1568</year></datestruct>, and so continued till <datestruct value="1584"><year reg="1584">1584</year></datestruct>. His behaviour to her was generous and honourable, sparing no cost for her entertainment, neither can words express the care and concern he had for her. Nor can envy itself say otherwise, than that he was a faithful, provident, and prudent person, which shewed that his integrity was not to be suspected in the least, although evil-disposed persons gave out that he used too much familiarity with his royal prisoner. Thus, though noble by descent, he was more noble and illustrious in his actions; famous at home and abroad, loyal to his prince and true to his country, and resigned his soul in a good old age.&rsquo;&rdquo; 
<P>The strict care and charge Lord Shrewsbury had over the person of his royal prisoner Mary, prevented his residing at, and, indeed, often visiting his mansion in <hi rend=italics>Cold Harbour.</hi> His life appears to have been made up with continual fears and jealousy of losing his unfortunate prisoner. In a letter to Lord Burleigh, dated at Sheffield Castell, <datestruct VALUE="1572-08-26"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=26>26</day>, <year reg=1572>1572</year></datestruct>, the Earl says, &ldquo;I thought to remove this Quene to my loge: now finding the place where she is safetur than I loked for, and consydering if any practeses shul be used betwext this and Halowtyde is the fytteste tyme to putt it in use, therefore I mynde not to remove hur at all, unles it be for V or VI dayes to klense hur chambar, beinge kept very unklenly. She is desyrus of new men and send thes abroad, whyche if by the imbassydor's menes may be obtayned at the Quene's Ma<hi rend=sup>ties</hi> hands wyll bring new devyses. Now she is metly quyett savenge she myslykes she can not goo a hunting into the felds upon horsebake, whych I trust the Quene's Ma<hi rend=sup>te</hi> wyll not assent unto, unles she myndes to sett hur at lybarte &amp; so havenge no matter als of importans, I ende w<hi rend=sup>t</hi> my most harty comedac'ons to yo<hi rend=sup>r</hi> good Lordship.&rdquo; 
<P>The Earl of Shrewsbury was released from his charge of the unfortunate Mary in <datestruct value="1584--"><year reg="1584">1584</year></datestruct>, who continued in other keepers' custody until her execution, in Fotheringay Castle, <datestruct VALUE="1586-02-8"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=8>8</day>, <year reg=1586>1586</year></datestruct>-<num value="7">7</num>. Nor did her former keeper long survive her, he himself dying the <datestruct VALUE="1590-11-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month> <year reg="1590">1590</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Nothing farther is recorded of <hi rend=italics>Cold Harbour</hi>, or its inmates, until the year <datestruct value="1600"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct>; when we are informed, on the authority of Mr. Lodge, Norroy King of Arms, it was pulled down by Gilbert <num value="7">seventh</num> Earl of Shrewsbury, son and successor of George the <num value="6">sixth</num> Earl. The oldest representations of it, which are just before this date, shew it to have been a building in the Tudor style of architecture; but from remains exhibited at its west side, it is probable that the whole river front was once castellated, and of stone, and that it was altered and modernized as it passed through the hands of different successors. How prominent it stood on the bank of the Thames appears from Hollar's View of London taken in <datestruct value="1620--"><year reg="1620">1620</year></datestruct>, from the opposite side of the river, and published in the early part of our <num value="1">first</num> volume of this work. The entrance from Thames Street led into a spacious court-yard enclosed by buildings, through the magnificent gate-house, which was standing in Stowe's time, when the steeple and part of the choir of Allhallows the Less stood on it. 
<P>Adjoining to the mansion of <hi rend=italics>Cold Harbour</hi> were formerly <num value="2">two</num> churches, both named All Saints, or Allhallows, distinguished as the Great and the Less, both being consumed in the dreadful conflagration of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>. The great church was rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren, but the less was never restored, and the parishes were united. The only remains lately visible of the latter church, which Newcourt mentions to have been built by Sir John Poultney, were <pb id="p.32" n="32"> some fragments of walls bearing evidence of the action of the fire. The site was turned into a burying-ground. The steeple and choir of the church stood on arches forming the entrance to the mansion of <hi rend=italics>Cold Harbour.</hi> The impropriate tithes of Allhallows the Less becoming the property of Dr. Edward Waddington, Rector of Allhallows the Great and Less, and afterwards Lord Bishop of Chichester, he by his will, in <datestruct value="1731--"><year reg="1731">1731</year></datestruct>, gave the same to the Bishop of London and his successors, in trust for the rectors of Allhallows the Great, united since the fire of London with Allhallows the Less, they paying thereout <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure> annually, on every Christmas day, to the poor of the said united parishes, share and share alike. 
<P>The church of Allhallows the Great was founded by the noble family of <hi rend=italics>Despenser</hi>, and from them the patronage came to the <hi rend=italics>Beauchamps</hi>, Earls of <hi rend=italics>Warwick</hi>, by the marriage of <hi rend=italics>Richard Beauchamp</hi>, Earl of <hi rend=italics>Warwick</hi>, to <hi rend=italics>Isabel</hi> his <num value="2">second</num> wife, daughter of Thomas Le Despenser, Earl of <hi rend=italics>Gloucester</hi>
(beheaded by the rabble at Bristol, <num value="1">1</num> Henry IV, anno <datestruct value="1399"><year reg="1399">1399</year></datestruct>); who by the death of her brother <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi>, and elder sister <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth</hi>, without issue, became heir of all his lands; which Thomas was son and heir to <hi rend=italics>Edward Le Despenser</hi>, Lord of <hi rend=italics>Glamorgan</hi>, patron of this church anno <datestruct value="1361"><year reg="1361">1361</year></datestruct>. From the Earl of Warwick it passed to the crown, and Henry VIII exchanged the church with Archbishop Cranmer, to whose successors it has ever since belonged, being now <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="13">thirteen</num> independent churches of the see of Canterbury in London, denominated peculiars appertaining thereto. 
<P>It is highly probable that Cold Harbour, whilst it consisted of the aforesaid magnificent mansion, with the ground and appurtenances attached thereto, as also subsequently when taken down by the Earl of Shrewsbury, and formed into a number of small tenements, possessed (until the year <datestruct value="1607"><year reg="1607">1607</year></datestruct>) divers privileges and exemptions from the jurisdiction of the City of London; for we find that King James the <num value="1">First</num>, by his charter to the Mayor, Commonalty, and Citizens of London, in that year confirmed all their ancient rights, liberties, and immunities, and added thereto the precincts of Duke's Place, St. Bartholomew the Great and Less, Black and White Friars, and <hi rend=italics>Cold Harbour;</hi> the charter expressing, that the circuit, bounds, limits, franchises, and jurisdiction of the city shall extend to the said several places, Cold Harbour being therein mentioned as the Inn, or Liberty of Cold Herbage, otherwise Cold Harburgh, and Cooled Harborough Lane, within the liberty of London aforesaid; and the inhabitants therein to be under the rule, government, jurisdiction, oversight, search, correction, punishments, precepts, and arrests of the Mayor, Commonalty, and Citizens of London and their successors. 
<P>On the <datestruct VALUE="1744-06-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month> <year reg="1744">1744</year></datestruct>, a dreadful fire broke out in the malt warehouse, in Cold Harbour, belonging to Sir William Calvert and Co. adjoining their brewhouse, and consumed <num value="4000">4000</num> quarters of malt, a large quantity of hops, and very much damaged their brewhouse, 
<P>The buildings on each side of Cold Harbour, and which a few years since were standing and occupied (and amongst which was a large sugarhouse belonging to Messrs. Henlock and Dewes), are all now taken down, and an extensive addition on the site thereof to the brewery of Messrs. Calvert and Co. (to whom great part of the ground now belongs) is understood to be in contemplation. At the time of the fire of London, the chief part of the ground belonged to the family of De Visscher, and afterwards to the Right Honourable Lords Barrington. 
<P>The view of Cold Harbour, as represented in the Plate, is from an original by Hollar, taken in the year <datestruct value="1650"><year reg="1650">1650</year></datestruct>; that part of the building in which the archway and steps leading from the water are represented, in all probability formed a portion of the ancient mansion that escaped demolition at the time it was doomed to destruction by Earl Gilbert, the adjoining small houses forming a part of the tenements erected on the other part of the site of this once extensive building, and which, no doubt, the eligibility of the spot for mercantile speculations, enabled him to let out at large rents. The church tower at the back represents <num value="1">one</num> of the churches of All Saints or Allhallows, most likely that of the Less, as most contiguous to the mansion of <hi rend=italics>Cold Harbour;</hi>
towards the enlarging of which churchyard Philip St. Clear gave his <num value="2">two</num> messuages in the Ropery, so called because ropes in old time were made and sold in the High Street. 

 
<P>After the fire, the Waterman's Company built their hall upon the quay at the south-west corner of Cold Harbour, which, amongst other streets and lanes, was declared by Act of Common Council. <datestruct VALUE="1666-03-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> <month reg="03">March</month> <year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>-<num value="7">7</num>, to be a street or lane of note. The Hall was a handsome brick building, and was in use so late as the year <datestruct value="1780"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct> as the Hall of the Waterman's Company, having in front to the river a large and convenient flight of stone stairs, open at all times to watermen and the public. These stairs were latterly very much neglected as to repair, and a few years since were entirely removed and the wharf closed up. They for a long period since the fire of London formed a very convenient access to the river in addition to Allhallows and Old Swan stairs, and had uninterrupted use by the public for many years, without any gate, inclosure, or obstruction whatever. 
<P>The Hall, Wharf, and Stairs, as they appeared in <datestruct value="1749--"><year reg="1749">1749</year></datestruct>, are very conspicuously shewn in an excellently engraved drawing of the same published in that year, and engraved by S. and N. Buck, being a complete view of the buildings on the London and Westminster side of the river from the Tower to Mill Bank. The Hall of the Waterman's Company is now situated at St. Mary at Hill, near Billingsgate. 
<P>The very extensive brewery and dwelling-house of Messrs. Calvert and Co. represented in the plate under the ancient view of <hi rend=italics>Cold Harbour</hi>, are erected on part of the site of that extensive and once magnificent building, and on that of the subsequent erection of Waterman's Hall, and occasioned great complaints to be made by the inhabitants adjacent, on account of what in their opinion had been gradual encroachments on the public highway along the wharfs, and trespasses on their general rights founded on the King's Proclamation in <datestruct VALUE="1666-09--"><month reg="09">September</month> <year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, and Act of Parliament <num value="19">19th</num> of Charles II, for rebuilding the city of London after the dreadful fire in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, in which it was declared, that there should be a fair key or wharf on all the river side, from London Bridge to Temple Stairs; that no house should be erected within so many feet of the river as should be after declared, nor should there be in those buildings next the river, any houses to be inhabited by brewers, dyers, or sugar-bakers; which trades, by their continual smoke, contributed very much to the unhealthiness of the adjacent places; but that the Lord Mayor and Aldermen were to propose such a place or places as might be fit for those trades, and that compensation would be granted to the proprietors of such houses or lands as were taken for the public benefit. 
<P>By an additional Act in the <num value="22">twenty-second</num> year of the same King, anno <datestruct value="1670"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>, section <num value="44">44</num>, it is enacted, that for the better benefit and accommodation of trade, and for other great conveniences, there shall be left a <hi rend=italics>continued tract of ground all along from London Bridge to the Temple</hi>, of the breadth of <num value="40">forty</num> feet of assize, from the north side of the river of Thames, to be converted to <hi rend=italics>a key, or public and open wharf;</hi> and that in order thereunto all buildings, sheds, pales, walls, inclosures, and other obstructions and impediments whatsoever then standing or being within <num value="40">forty</num> feet northward of the said river of Thames, between the places aforesaid (cranes, stairs, and docks only excepted), should, within <num value="8">eight</num> months then next ensuing, be taken down and removed, and the said ground cleared and levelled. 
<P>King Charles II, by his Letters Patent, dated <datestruct VALUE="-12-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct> in the <num value="23">twenty-third</num> year of his reign, approved of the module, form, or draught of the intended key and publique and open wharf (of which a plan is annexed to the Letters Patent) and granted to the Mayor, Commonalty, and Citizens of London and their successors, all that his ground and soyle whatsoever, which was, should, or might be taken in from and out of his river of Thames, to the intent to make the line between London Bridge and the Temple uniform and regular according to the said module, form and draught. 
<P>The inhabitants of the ward of Dowgate set forth their complaint in a petition to the Honourable the Commissioners of Sewers of the city of London, shewing, &ldquo;That a considerable part of what has heretofore been used by the public as a common highway along the banks of the river Thames in Dowgate ward, has recently been enclosed with a wood paling, by the owners of the adjoining property, Messrs. Calvert and Co. and others, leaving to the public a narrow enclosed foot path; whereas during the memory of the oldest inhabitants, and supported by the inquest presentments of a more remote period, nearly the whole space now enclosed has always been used and considered as a public highway for the purpose of perambulation and fresh air, as well as for the convenience of the neighbours in other respects, the right of the possessors of the adjacent property to land over the surface of the ground not being questioned.&rdquo; This was presented and read, <datestruct VALUE="1821-02-20"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=20>20th</day>, <year reg=1821>1821</year></datestruct>, when the Court of Sewers confirmed a report of their Select Committee, stating, that it was desirable the encroachments should be removed; but on the <datestruct VALUE="1821-07-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month> <year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>, after much opposition by the inhabitants in and near Dowgate ward, an Act was passed both Houses to repeal so much of the Act of the <num value="22">twenty-second</num> of His Majesty King Charles the <num value="2">Second</num>, as restrains the proprietors of wharfs between London Bridge and the Temple, from erecting any buildings or enclosures thereon. The Act, however, includes the following important clause: 
<P>&ldquo;That nothing in this Act contained shall extend, or be construed to extend, in any manner to take away, abrogate, injure, or affect any right or claim to or in respect of any public way, street, wharf, or stairs, or any other right, claim, or interest belonging to, or claimed by the Corporation of the city of London, or the proprietors of the London Bridge waterworks, or any other person or persons whatsoever, other than and except any claim which might or may be made or arise from, under, or by virtue of the said recited Act.&rdquo; (<num value="22">22</num>d Cha. II. c. <num value="11">11</num>.) 
<P>So much of the quay of <num value="40">forty</num> feet in width, which was situated from the Steel Yard to London Bridge, was long denominated &ldquo;the New Quay,&rdquo; and is delineated in the maps to Maitland's and other Histories of London. This &ldquo;New Quay&rdquo; was the last remnant of any consequence of that noble design formed by Sir Christopher Wren, Mr. Evelyn, and others (assisted by the before-mentioned enactments of the Legislature), and intended to render the north bank of the river as far as the fire of London had extended, truly useful and ornamental, and upon which Sir Christopher Wren made a special report to the King in Council, <datestruct VALUE="1670-01-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> <month reg="01">January</month> <year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>, but which, from the negligence of those who ought to have preserved so great an object of public benefit, is now nearly annihilated. It is only necessary to add, that in the late struggle to maintain the public rights, it was resolved and declared at a numerous meeting of the inhabitants of Dowgate and the adjoining wards, held on the <datestruct VALUE="1821-03-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month> <year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>, that their object was only to preserve the few remaining open spaces along the bank of the river, and not to interfere with any buildings which had theretofore been erected, although in contravention of the said acts of <num value="19">19th</num> and <num value="22">22</num>d Charles II. 
<P>The banks of the Thames from <hi rend=italics>London Bridge</hi> to the <hi rend=italics>Old Palace at Westminster</hi>, presented a continued line of palaces and mansions of kings, princes, and persons of the <num value="1">first</num> nobility, clergy, &amp;c. beautified and adorned with well laid out gardens to the water's edge; among the principal of which may be enumerated <hi rend=italics>Cold Harbour; Baynards Castle; Bridewell</hi>, the residence of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII; the house of <hi rend=italics>Knights Templars</hi>, now the <hi rend=italics>Temple</hi>, <num value="1">one</num> of our <num value="1">first</num> Inns of Court; <hi rend=italics>Paget</hi> afterwards <hi rend=italics>Essex House; Arundell House; Somerset House; the Savoy, Durham, Salisbury, Worcester</hi>, and <hi rend=italics>Suffolk Houses;</hi>
with <hi rend=italics>Whitehall</hi>, the splendid and superb town residence of the ambitious Cardinal Wolsey! 
<P>The handsome Gate shewn in the accompanying print of the Brewery, and standing at the end of Cold Harbour in Upper Thames Street, adjoining the churchyard of Allhallows the Less, was removed in the year <datestruct value="1810"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, at the expense of Messrs. Calvert and Co. from Whitehall, and erected in its present situation, with the consent of the parish, the Wardmote Inquest, and the Commissioners of Sewers, upon condition of their setting back a part of their premises in Upper Thames Street, adjoining the east end of the churchyard, and keeping open the said gate (and another which they likewise had the permission of erecting at the south end of Cold Harbour), for the convenience of the public in passing and repassing from sun rising to sun setting, and the churchwardens having a key of each of the said gates for the public use at all times.&mdash;Since the engraving of the annexed Plate, the wooden fence narrowing the way at the waterside, and noticed in the above petition to the Commissioners of Sewers has been erected. <pb id="p.33" n="33">

<P>It appears from Stow's Survey of London, published in <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>, that the Hall belonging to this Company was situated in Bread Street, near to Allhallows Church, together with <num value="6">six</num> almshouses adjoining, for decayed brethren of that community; all of which were given to them in <datestruct value="1454--"><year reg="1454">1454</year></datestruct>, by Thomas Beaumont, Esq., Alderman and Sheriff, who was a member of the Company, and was buried in a part of the Church called the Salters' Chapel, near the south window, which was erected at his expense. In <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>, the Company purchased a large house and garden, situate between Walbrook and St. Swithin's Lane, which originally belonged to the Prior of Tortington in Suffolk, which having, at the dissolution of religious houses, devolved to the Crown, with the church and churchyard of St. Swithin, as the property of the dissolved priory, was given to John de Vere, Earl of Oxford, who changed its name to Oxford Place. Having probably been restored by Queen Mary, it was granted again by Queen Elizabeth to Edward Earl of Oxford, grandson of the former possessor, who, after some time, sold it to Sir John Hart, Alderman; who kept his mayoralty here in <datestruct value="1589--"><year reg="1589">1589</year></datestruct>. His daughter married Sir George Bolles, who thereby came into possession of the estate, and kept his mayoralty here in <datestruct value="1617--"><year reg="1617">1617</year></datestruct>. It came afterwards into the hands of Humphrey Smith, Esq., who sold it to the Company. Having made this purchase, they fitted up part of the premises as a Hall, and removed from Bread Street; letting their old Hall to several tenants, till it, with the adjoining almshouses, were destroyed by the great fire, A. D. <datestruct value="1666"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>; after which the Company let the ground on building leases, all of which have long since expired, and the buildings are now a part of the Society's estates. Their new Hall, in Oxford Place, escaped the conflagration; and St. Swithin's church being destroyed, the Company, at the request of the Bishop of London, permitted the parishioners to assemble for divine worship in their long parlour, for a considerable time, till the church was ready to receive them. The church of St. Mary Bothaw, which was under the patronage of the Archbishop of Canterbury, not being rebuilt, the parish was united with St. Swithin's, and the Archbishop and the Company presented alternately; but at length the Company sold the perpetual advowson of their turn to a gentleman of the family of Beachcroft. The parsonage-house being rebuilt after the fire, by Mr. Thomas Whistler, the court in which it stands was from him called Whistler's Court; while Oxford Court has nearly retained its original name. In <datestruct value="1692--"><year reg="1692">1692</year></datestruct> the Company granted a lease of part of their Hall (supposed to be the long parlour before mentioned) to a congregation of Protestant dissenters of the Presbyterian denomination, who fitted it up as a place for public worship, and whose descendants continued to occupy it till it was (together with the Hall) taken down. 
<P>The Company consists of a master, <num value="2">two</num> wardens, <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> assistants, and about <num value="140">one hundred and forty</num> liverymen. The present master is John Cancellor, Esq.; and the wardens are Peter Clark, Esq., and Thomas Gillespy, Esq. 
<P>The Hall underwent several alterations and improvements at different times; till at length, being much decayed, the Company resolved to rebuild it, and in consequence thereof, in <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>, it was taken entirely down. <pb id="p.34" n="34">

<P>The Meeting-house in Salters' Hall Court, adjoining the Hall, and originally constituting a part of it, was a substantial brick building, fitted up soon after the Revolution, for a congregation of Protestant dissenters, who had been previously used to assemble for divine worship at Buckingham House, on College Hill. It was a large building, having <num value="4">four</num> galleries, and was esteemed as <num value="1">one</num> of the most celebrated places of worship among the Dissenters. From its centrical and retired situation, it had often been chosen as a suitable place for carrying on lectures, or for holding the meetings of Ministers, for the purpose of considering questions of importance, relative to the welfare of the dissenting interest in general. 
<P>Mr. Richard Mayo was the pastor of the church who <num value="1">first</num> assembled here; he continued till his death, <datestruct VALUE="1695-09-8"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=8>8</day>, <year reg=1695>1695</year></datestruct>, when he was succeeded by Mr. Nathaniel Taylor, at whose death, in <datestruct VALUE="1702-04--"><month reg="04">April</month> <year reg="1702">1702</year></datestruct>, Mr. William Tong was chosen to fill the office, which he did with much acceptance and usefulness, till <datestruct VALUE="1726-03--"><month reg="03">March</month> <year reg="1726">1726</year></datestruct>-<num value="7">7</num>. But Mr. John Newman, who had been assistant to Mr. Taylor, being very acceptable to the people, Mr. Tong proposed that he should be appointed co-pastor with him, which was accordingly done in <datestruct value="1716--"><year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct>; and after Mr. Tong's death Mr. Newman continued sole pastor till <datestruct VALUE="1741-07--"><month reg="07">July</month> <year reg="1741">1741</year></datestruct>, when he was called to his rest. Mr. John Barker was appointed to succeed him in the pastoral office, and the next year Mr. Francis Spilsbury was associated with him as co-pastor. Mr. Barker continued in office till the spring of <datestruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>, when severe bodily affliction compelled him to resign it; but Mr. Spilsbury remained sole pastor till his death, in <datestruct VALUE="1782-03--"><month reg="03">March</month> <year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct>, when Mr. Hugh Worthington and Mr. Robert Jacomb were ordained as co-pastors. Mr. Jacomb resigned his situation in <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>, and Mr. Worthington continued sole pastor till his death in <datestruct VALUE="1813-07--"><month reg="07">July</month> <year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, when he was succeeded by Dr. W. B. Collyer, the present pastor. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct> the Salters' Company, having come to a determination to rebuild their hall, gave notice to the managers of the church and congregation that they must quit the premises at Lady Day <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>. It became necessary therefore to provide another place for them to assemble in, and at length some houses were purchased in Oxford Court, within a few yards of the place which they had so long occupied. These being taken down a handsome building was erected on the spot, which was opened for divine worship on Tuesday, <datestruct VALUE="1822-06-4"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=4>4th</day>, <year reg=1822>1822</year></datestruct>; the old Meetinghouse, together with the Hall, having just before been levelled with the ground. 
<P>The <num value="1">first</num> Lecture carried on here was a branch of the Merchants' lecture, established A. D. <datestruct value="1672"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>, at Pinners' Hall, in Old Broad Street. In <datestruct value="1695--"><year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>, differences having arisen among the lecturers, some of whom were Presbyterians and others Independents, the Presbyterians withdrew and carried on a lecture here, on the same day and at the same hour as they had been used to do at Pinners' Hall. This was continued by a succession of Presbyterian Ministers, till <datestruct value="1795"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>; when, being but thinly attended, it was finally given up. The next lecture established here was on Lord's day evenings, and was begun in the reign of King William the <num value="3">Third</num>. This was for a great many years extremely popular. The <num value="1">first</num> Minister who conducted it was the Rev. Robert Bragge, who, after some time, removed it to his own Meeting-house in Lime Street. It was soon after recommenced at this place by the celebrated Mr. Thomas Bradbury, who delivered it to crowded audiences for more than <num value="20">twenty</num> years. In <datestruct value="1725--"><year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct> he resigned his lectureship and was succeeded by the Rev. Samuel Baker, who was followed by several Presbyterian Ministers, some of considerable eminence, as Dr. Wm. Prior, Dr. Abm. Rees, Dr. Philip Furneaux, and Mr Hugh Worthington; it was continued by various ministers, of different denominations, till <datestruct value="1812"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, when, being ill attended, it was given up. A lecture, on a Wednesday evening, was also carried on here for several years, and was discontinued in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1735--"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>, a course of lectures were delivered here against the principal errors of the church of Rome, which were published in <num value="2">two</num> volumes octavo. But it was especially remarkable for being the place where the general body of Dissenting Ministers met in <datestruct VALUE="1719-02--"><month reg="02">February</month> <year reg="1719">1719</year></datestruct>, to consider of the best means of opposing the spread of Arian sentiments, which had made considerable progress in the west of England; some were for subscribing a declaration as a test of Orthodoxy, others opposed it as an infringement of the rights of private judgment; the numbers were nearly equal on both sides; much ill-nature was displayed, and animosity excited, but no good was produced, though it gave occasion to their enemies to speak evil against them, and was very unfriendly to the interests of true religion. <pb id="p.35" n="35">

<P>A report is mentioned and denied by Stow, as prevalent in his own time, that the most ancient building which stood on the site of this Hall, had been either a Temple, a Church, or a Jewish Synagogue. That it was not intended as an edifice for christian devotion, he argues from its position, which was north and south instead of the established arrangement of placing the altar-end in the east; and that it had not been erected for either of the other <num value="2">two</num> purposes, he maintains from the form not being circular, but that of a nobleman's house.<NOTE N="a"><P>Stow's &ldquo;Survey of London.&rdquo; Edit. by the Rev. J. Strype, Lond. <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, fol. Vol. I. book iii. chap. v. p. <num value="65">65</num>. It is not improbable that the tradition originated in the numerous adjacent dwellings appropriated to the Jews in the Old Jewry and Lothbury, in both of which there were also synagogues. That in the former was at the north corner of the street; and that in the latter was on the south side, in the part occupied by the founders. In Dr. D&lsquo;Blossiers Tovey's &ldquo;Anglia Judaica,&rdquo; Oxf. <datestruct value="1738--"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct>, <num value="4">4</num>to. pp. <num value="279">279</num>, <num value="392">392</num>, it is stated that originally the Jews had a synagogue in every house; which, however, probably signified only a chamber for prayer, partly ruinated in memory of the Temple of Jerusalem. Stow mentions &ldquo;the house of Benoyme Mittun, the Jew, in the parish of St. Michael Bassinghaughe in which the said Benomye dwelt,&rdquo; with land belonging to him in that Parish and in Coleman Street.</NOTE> Discrediting these reports, therefore, he refers the time of its foundation to a period since the Norman Invasion, because it was reared &ldquo;upon vaults of stone, which stone was brought from Caen in Normandy; being like that of Paul's Church, builded by Mauritius and his successors Bishops of London.&rdquo; He adds that he considered the most probable supposition concerning it was, that it had been &ldquo;of old time belonging to the family of the Bassings; which was in this realm a name of great antiquity and renown, and that it also bare the name of that family, and was therefore called Bassing's Haugh, or Hall. Whereunto I am the rather induced for that the arms of that family were of old time so abundantly placed in sundry parts of the house, even in the stonework; but more especially on the walls of the hall; which carried a continual painting of them on every side, so close together as <num value="1">one</num> escocheon could be placed by another: which I myself have often seen and noted before the old building was taken down. These arms were a gyrond of <num value="12">twelve</num> points, gold and azure. Of the Bassings, therefore, builders of this house, and owners of the ground near adjoining, the Ward taketh the name: as also Coleman-Street Ward of Coleman, and Farringdon Ward of William and Nicholas Farringdon; men that were principal owners of these places.&rdquo; 
<P>So early as the <num value="11">eleventh</num> century, however, the same authority states that the most noble persons inhabiting the City were appointed to be principal magistrates in this mansion; by which it appears to have been then an official residence,&mdash;probably on account of its vicinity to the ancient Aldermen's Bury, or court of meeting, in the present street called Aldermanbury,<NOTE N="b"><P>It is stated by Stow that this court-hall stood on the eastern side of the street of Aldermanbury, not far from the western end of the present Guildhall; and that he had seen the ruins of it, &ldquo;which of late hath been employed as a carpenter's yard, &amp;c.&rdquo; meaning, perhaps, about the year <datestruct value="1568"><year reg="1568">1568</year></datestruct>. It is very possible that the site of this edifice was long indicated by a place almost opposite the eastern end of the Church of St. Mary Aldermanbury, called Carpenter's Court. Strype calls it &ldquo;a very handsome fine place, with a free-stone pavement, well inhabited.&rdquo; Strype's Stow's &ldquo;Survey of London,&rdquo; Vol. I. book iii. chap. vi. pp. <num value="71">71</num>, <num value="90">90</num>.</NOTE> previously to the <num value="1">first</num> erection of a Guildhall in King Street, Cheapside, in <datestruct value="1411--"><year reg="1411">1411</year></datestruct>. The magistrates referred to, at this time bore the name of Portgraves, or Counts of the Gate;<NOTE N="c"><P>On the authority of the City Records called the &ldquo;Liber Albus&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Liber Custumarum,&rdquo; fol. clxxxvij. preserved in the Chamber of London, Strype explains the word Portgrave to be Saxon: <hi rend=italics>Port</hi> signifying a City; and <hi rend=italics>Grave</hi> in the same Teutonic, or Almain, tongue, <hi rend=italics>Comes</hi>, a Count or Earl, sounding the Earl of the City; whence the honour due to a Count, as well in the Kings presence as elsewhere in London, was due to this chief officer, while he was in his office; and thence is the reason of the sword being carried before him. Strype's Stow's &ldquo;Survey of London,&rdquo; Vol. II. book v. chap. v. p. <num value="73">73</num>. The word Port is used for a City by Aelfred, but it more commonly signifies a gate or entrance, as <hi rend=italics>Pforte</hi> does in the modern German.</NOTE> which perhaps furnishes another reason for the situation and use of the present edifice, being near to the Postern-gate of Aldermanbury. The names of some of them preserved by Stow, are Godfrey De Magun, or Magnaville, Portgrave or Sheriff, in the reigns of William the Conqueror, and William Rufus; Hugh de Buche, or Boche, in that of Henry I.; Aubrey de Vere, Earl of Oxford, slain in that of Stephen; Gilbert Becket, in the same; Godfrey Magnaville, the son of William, the son of Godfrey, Earls of Essex, by the gift of Maud the Empress; Peter Fitz Walter, and John Fitz Nigel, in the reign of John; Ernulphus Buchel; and William Fitz Isabel.<NOTE N="d"><P>Strype's Stow's &ldquo;Survey of London,&rdquo; Vol. I. book iii. chap. v. p. <num value="65">65</num>.

<P>The name of this family is connected with those of several places in different parts of England; as Bassingbourne, Basingstoke, &amp;c. and in <num value="2">two</num> other instances within the metropolis; namely, in Basing-lane, Bread Street, and the inn called the Basing-House, at Shoreditch. Of the former Stow observes that in <datestruct value="1396--"><year reg="1396">1396</year></datestruct>-<num value="97">97</num>, the <num value="20">20th</num> year of Richard II., it was called the Bakehouse; but, he adds, &ldquo;sure I am that I have not yet read of any Basing to have anything there to do.&rdquo; <hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, by Strype, Vol. I. book iii. chap. ix. p. <num value="204">204</num>.</NOTE>

<P>It is probable that the mansion at this time <num value="1">first</num> passed into the possession of that family, whose name and memory are <pb id="p.36" n="36"> still retained in the title of Basinghall-street; and to this period also belongs the series of heraldical decorations mentioned by Stow.<NOTE N="a"><P>The cavetto of a frieze remaining upon the south side of St. Stephen's Chapel, Westminster, discovered in <datestruct VALUE="1800-08--"><month reg="08">August</month> <year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>, was decorated in the manner mentioned by Stow, with a number of Shields painted with royal and noble armorial-ensigns, probably belonging to benefactors to the foundation. The shields were placed almost in contact with each other; every single escutcheon being attended by <num value="2">two</num> chimerical and grotesque figures, such as are continually to be found in the borders of the illuminated manuscripts of the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> and <num value="15">fifteenth</num> centuries: and these paintings were considered to have been executed in the reign of Edward III. &ldquo;Antiquities of Westminster,&rdquo; by J.

<P>Having probably stood for upwards of <num value="400">four hundred</num> years, about the middle of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century this edifice became ruinous and in danger of falling, which induced Richard May, Merchant-Taylor, at his decease to give the sum of <num value="300">300</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> for re-edifying the outer part; upon condition that the repairs should be performed within <num value="3">three</num> years of that time. The old Bakewell Hall was then entirely taken down: and in the month of February next following, says Stow, who witnessed the demolition,&mdash;the foundation of a new, strong, and beautiful, store house being laid, the work thereof was so diligently applied that, within the space of <num value="10">ten</num> months after, to the charges of <num value="2500">2500</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>, the same was finished in the year <datestruct value="1558"><year reg="1558">1558</year></datestruct>.

<P>The progressive alterations introduced into the manner of conducting the woollen trade during the last <num value="2">two</num> centuries, gradually reduced the commercial importance of Blackwell Hall; from the sales there having been diverted into other channels.

In <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>, was passed an Act of Parliament for &ldquo;enabling the Mayor and Commonalty of the Citizens of London, to provide convenient Courts of Justice, in and for the said city.&rdquo;<NOTE N="c"><P>Local Acts declared Public, <num value="55">55th</num> George III. <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>, chap. xciii.

The Act then empowered the Corporation to buy such parts of the Hall and Chapel as did not belong to it: to take them down: to erect and provide convenient buildings for the Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas, and Court of Requests, for the City, upon part of the sites of Guildhall Chapel and Blackwell Hall: and to grant building-leases, and sell the reserved rents and fee-simple, of any part or parts of the sites which might not be required for the said purposes, freed from the annual payment charged upon Blackwell Hall to the Orphan's Fund, in common with the other City markets.&mdash;On <datestruct VALUE="1815-07-7"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=7>7th</day>, <year reg=1815>1815</year></datestruct>, the Corporation referred the execution of this Act to the Improvement Committee; which, on <datestruct VALUE="1819-02-25"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=25>25th</day>, <year reg=1819>1819</year></datestruct>, presented a Report to the Common Council on offering part of the site of this Hall, &amp;c. for the Commissioners of Bankrupt. The Report stated that &ldquo;it having been represented to them that a notice had been given in the Honourable House of Commons of a motion intended to be made for the purpose of removing the Commissioners of Bankrupt from Guildhall to Furnival's Inn, in Holborn,&mdash;they proceeded to take the same into their serious consideration: and conceiving that it would be attended with great inconvenience if not injury, to the citizens, merchants, and traders, of the City, if the Commissioners of Bankrupt were removed to any distance from the Guildhall, where the meetings of the Commissioners have hitherto been always held, they were of opinion that, if the Guildhall cannot be rendered fit for the Commissioners&mdash;some plot of ground near to the Guildhall should be procured: and as there is a large space, part of Blackwell Hall, and premises in Basinghall Street belonging to this City, not wanted for the proposed new Courts of Justice, extending <num value="90">90</num> feet in front next to Basinghall Street, and of an average depth of <num value="87">87</num> feet, which is authorised by Act of Parliament to be let for the purpose of being built upon and afterwards to be sold; they thought it would be advisable to offer the same to the Government for sale or otherwise as may be most expedient, in order to be appropriated to the Commissioners of Bankrupt; whereby the apprehended inconvenience, and injury to the citizens, merchants, and traders, of this City, may be avoided; and that they should be empowered to make the said offer and to treat with them accordingly.

<P>In the time of Stow, this Chapel contained <num value="7">seven</num> sepulchral monuments of marble, though even then they were all defaced; having been probably wilfully mutilated at the general destruction of superstitious reliques about <datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>; and to these Strype adds several sepulchral memorials of a latter time, an account of which is given in the former notices of Guildhall Chapel. About <datestruct VALUE="1822-07--"><month reg="07">July</month> <year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>, in taking down Guildhall Chapel under the Act of Parliament already mentioned, an ancient sepulchre was discovered in digging near the north-west angle of the edifice, between <num value="12">12</num> and <num value="18">18</num> inches below the surface of the floor. It contained a stone coffin, almost entire, measuring <num value="6">6</num> feet <num value="1.75">1 3/4</num> inch in the extreme length, <num value="2">2</num> feet <num value="3.50">3 1/2</num> inches in width at the head, and <num value="1">1</num> foot <num value="3.75">3 3/4</num> inches in width at the feet. On the lid was sculptured in relievo a tall cross standing on <num value="3">three</num> steps, the head terminating in a lozenge bottonn&eacute;e at the extremities; and on the sides were engraven <num value="2">two</num> high tapers in cand esticks. On the cavetto of the sloping edge was inscribed &ldquo;GODEFREY: LETROVM- POVR: GIST: CI: DEV: DEL: EALME: EIT MERCI: or, Godfrey Letroumpour lies here; God have mercy on his soul! the letters of which were of the later unornamented Longobardic form, re-introduced into England about the reign of Edward III. Both the lid and coffin were of a kind of Purbeck stone; the former being of the usual grey colour, and the latter somewhat red and partially mutilated, which was attributed to its long exposure in the earth. In the <num value="1">1</num> wer part the coffin was a perforation for the passage of the moisture, and the interior shape was straight at the sides, with an extension for the shoulders and a circular cavity for the head. Wherever it was originally placed in the Chapel, there can be little doubt that the lid once formed a ledgerstone level with the floor; and there is reason to believe that, if the sepulchre were not coeval with the coffin, it was of considerable antiquity: each of its sides was decorated with a red cross inscribed within a circle <num value="10.75">10 3/4</num> inches in diameter.<NOTE N="b"><P><hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi>, <datestruct VALUE="1821-07--"><month reg="07">July</month> <year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>, vol. xcii. part ii. p. <num value="3">3</num>; in which will be also found a wood-engraving of the coffin and lid.

<P>On the south side of the edifice Stow relates, that there was sometime a fair and large Library, furnished with books, pertaining to Guildhall, and the London College of Priests established in Guildhall Chapel. These books, he observes, were, in the reign of Edward VI., sent for by Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, the Lord Protector, with promise that they should be returned shortly. Men laded from thence <num value="3">three</num> carriers with them: but they were never returned. This library was builded by the executors of Richard Whittington and William Bury. The arms of Whittington are placed on <num value="1">one</num> side in the stone-work; and <num value="2">two</num> letters, to wit W. and B., for William Bury, on the other side.

In the immediate vicinity of this very spot, the Corporation of London has established and erected &ldquo;a Library of all matters relating to this City, the Borough of Southwark, and the County of Middlesex.&rdquo; The design was <num value="1">first</num> brought forward in the Court of Common-Council, on <datestruct VALUE="1824-04-8"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=8>8th</day>, <year reg=1824>1824</year></datestruct>, when it was referred to a Special Committee to consider of the best method of effecting it. A Report on <datestruct VALUE="-06-4"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=4>4th</day></datestruct> stated, that the room then occupied by the Irish Society was the best adapted for the New Library; and that until such time as it could be procured, the front room by the Exchequer Court might be used: that the sum required for the outfit would be <num value="500">500</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>, with <num value="200">200</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>
yearly for the support of the Library: and that there was reason to believe that when the establishment should become known, many public bodies and spirited individuals would be induced to assist it by presents. On <datestruct VALUE="1828-01-24"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=24>24th</day>, <year reg=1828>1828</year></datestruct>, a Report stated that the Library was arranged and ready for opening, but that a Librarian had not been nominated: and recommended Mr. William Herbert to be placed in that office, to which he was subsequently appointed. The Library opened in <datestruct VALUE="1828-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>, and the Catalogue appeared in the same year; at which time the collection contained <datestruct value="1380--"><year reg="1380">1380</year></datestruct> different works, and about <datestruct value="1700--"><year reg="1700">1700</year></datestruct> volumes. In a Report of the Library Committee, dated <datestruct VALUE="1829-11-5"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=5>5th</day>, <year reg=1829>1829</year></datestruct>, it is stated that the books were <num value="2800">2800</num> in number, exclusive of <num value="100">100</num> duplicates; of which total nearly <datestruct value="1050--"><year reg="1050">1050</year></datestruct> volumes were duplicates also:<NOTE N="f"><P><hi rend=italics>Minutes of the Proceeding of the Court of Common Council</hi>, <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>, fol. p.p. <num value="74">74</num>, <num value="124">124</num>. <hi rend=italics>Ibid.</hi> <datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>, p. <num value="12">12</num>. <hi rend=italics>Ibid.</hi> <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>, p. <num value="105">105</num>.

<hi rend=italics>An Historical Account of Lumbeth Palace; The Antiquities of the Inns of Courts; The History of the Chartered Companies of London;</hi> of numerous antiquarian topographical articles which have appeared in the <hi rend=italics>Morning Herald</hi>, and other meritorious productions of a similar character. He was also <num value="1">one</num> of the original projectors, authors, and publishers, of the present work, in conjunction with Mr. Wilkinson.</NOTE> the books now (<datestruct VALUE="1834-10--"><month reg="10">October</month> <year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>) amount to nearly <num value="5000">5,000</num>. The most considerable donor to this establishment, was Mr. Thomas Whitby, Deputy of Queenhythe Ward, who gave nearly <num value="100">100</num> volumes, all relating to London; but Mr. Town-Clerk Woodthorpe, the late City-Solicitor, W. L. Newman, Esq., and several other members of the Corporation, and literary persons, were also considerable benefactors. The chief subject of the collection, is the general, ecclesiastical, and civil history of the Metropolis; with its institutions, inns of court, colleges, companies, hospitals, charities, laws, charters, customs, manners, biography, public buildings, topography, antiquities, improvements, population, prisons, riots, plagues, the great fire, Parliamentary and commercial history, &amp;c. both in printed works an manuscripts. The Library also includes a large and increasing number of Maps, Plans, Prints, and Drawings, connected with the same subject, arranged in Wards and Parishes: and a Museum of civic antiquities and works of art is also gradually accumulating. The apartment originally appropriated to this Library was the Irish Chamber above Guildhall Gate, with the room beyond it; but in <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct> a new building was commenced for its reception, from the designs of Mr. Frederick Mountague, upon the site of the cloisters between Guildhall and the adjoining Chapel. This building is entered by a staircase in the porch of Guildhall, and consists of an apartment about <num value="47">47</num> feet long, <num value="30">30</num> broad, and <num value="16">16</num> high, with an ornamented arched ceiling, lighted by a lanthorn, small flat skylights, and a large window at the eastern end, with the City Arms in stained glass, in a semi-circle above it. On each side are galleries about <num value="8.50">8 1/2</num> feet from the floor, supported by <num value="8">eight</num> piers, and ascended by bronzed iron stairs at the eastern end of the room: the whole of which walls, piers, and galleries, are lined with bookcases, with brass latticed-doors in front. The new Library is now complete, though the whole collection of books has not yet been transferred to it; and the original apartment will probably continue to be used for members of the Corporation, the great room being appropriated to visitors. By the regulation of the Library, every member of the Corporation may introduce a visitor either personally or by letter; and it is open daily from <num value="10">10</num> o'clock until <num value="4">4</num>, excepting during the month of August, and from the <num value="6">6th</num> until the <datestruct VALUE="-11-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, when it is entirely closed. <pb id="p.39" n="39">

<P>In the reign of Edward the Confessor, about A. D. <datestruct value="1053"><year reg="1053">1053</year></datestruct>, the Borough of Southwark appears to have been a separate Corporation governed by a Bailiff, and to have continued so for nearly <num value="3">three</num> centuries afterward; during which time it seems to have acquired the character anciently common to extra-judicial places and unfinished suburbs, of a kind of legal refuge for criminals and lawless persons. The consequent evils led to its connection with the City of London. since in A.D. <datestruct value="1327"><year reg="1327">1327</year></datestruct>, the Citizens made complaint to King Edward III. that &ldquo;felons, thieves, and other malefactors, and disturbers of the peace, who in the said City and elsewhere have committed manslaughters, robberies, and divers other felonies, privately departed from the said City after those felonies committed, into the Village of Southwark, where they cannot be attached by the officers of the said City, and are there openly received: and so, for default of punishment, are more bold to commit such felonies.&rdquo; The Citizens therefore besought the King, for the conservation of peace within the City, and for the restraining of such evil without,&mdash;that he would grant to them the Village of Southwark, for ever; at the accustomed farm and rent, to be yearly paid by them at the Exchequer.<NOTE N="a"><P>It is recorded in the Memoranda of the Exchequer, &ldquo;inter Recorda de Termino Sancti Michaelis,&rdquo; &ldquo;that Edward III. in the <num value="2">second</num> year of his reign, <datestruct value="1328--"><year reg="1328">1328</year></datestruct>, granted to the Mayor and Commonalty of London Ballivam de Suthwerk, id est, the Bailiwick of Southwark; which they held of the King at Fee-farm, paying <num value="101">101</num>. a year; and their Bailey was Thomas Clopham; who seems to have been put in by the Mayor and Commonalty of London.&rdquo; Rev. J. Strype's Stow's <hi rend=italics>Survey of London.</hi> Lond. <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, fol. Vol. II. book iv. chap. i. p. <num value="2">2</num>.</NOTE>
In consequence of this petition, the <num value="1">first</num> charter was granted for the annexation of London to Southwark, dated Westminster, <datestruct VALUE="-03-6"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=6>6th</day></datestruct>, in the <num value="1">first</num> year of the reign of Edward III., <datestruct value="1327--"><year reg="1327">1327</year></datestruct>. In the <num value="7">seventh</num> year of Henry IV., <datestruct value="1406--"><year reg="1406">1406</year></datestruct>, the Citizens received another patent conveying the privileges of Clerk of the Market, the return of writs, and the power of arresting offenders within the Borough, and of carrying them to their gaol of Newgate; against which the inhabitants of Southwark petitioned, stating it to be to the disherison of the King, and the impoverishing of the Ville. It appears, however, that their complaints had no effect, since in A.D. <datestruct value="1463"><year reg="1463">1463</year></datestruct>, the City received from Edward IV. a confirmation of the charter of Edward III., with several additional privileges: including the holding of a Fair on <datestruct VALUE="-09-7"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=7>7th</day></datestruct>, <num value="8">8th</num>, and <num value="9">9th</num>, having a Court of Pie-Powder, power of arrest, &amp;c. The Sheriff of Surrey seems to have been dissatisfied with this authority, as being an encroachment upon his jurisdiction; for in <datestruct value="1467--"><year reg="1467">1467</year></datestruct>-<num value="68">68</num>, the <num value="7">seventh</num> year of Edward IV., a writ was directed to him from the King commanding him to allow the liberties and jurisdictions already granted to the Mayor and Citizens of London. 
<P>After the dissolution of Religious Houses, when all the conventual property in Southwark reverted to the King, and the whole Borough became his, the Corporation petitioned Henry VIII. and his Privy-Council to annex that suburb to the City, which, however, was not then granted: and it was not until <datestruct value="1550--"><year reg="1550">1550</year></datestruct>-<num value="51">51</num>, the <num value="4">fourth</num> year of the reign of Edward VI., that the very copious charter was issued conveying the government, rents, and property, of the same to the Mayor and Commonalty of London. This charter is dated at Westminster, <datestruct VALUE="-04-23"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=23>23rd</day></datestruct>, and is stated to have been granted partly in consideration of the sum of <num value="647">647</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="1">1</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>, paid to the King's use: the Lord Mayor has never been effectually dispossessed of the authority bestowed by it, and it has continued in force to even the present time. About a month after the receipt of this charter, on Tuesday, <datestruct VALUE="1551-05-28"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=28>28th</day>, <year reg=1551>1551</year></datestruct>, the corporation erected the Borough of Southwark into an additional Ward, by the name of the Ward of Bridge Without, and elected Sir John Ayliffe, Knight, Citizen and Barber-Surgeon, to be the <num value="1">first</num> Alderman; the appointment of whom it was determined, <datestruct VALUE="1558-06-16"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=16>16th</day>, <year reg=1558>1558</year></datestruct>, the <num value="4">fourth</num> and <num value="5">fifth</num> years of Philip and Mary, should be in the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen.<NOTE N="b"><P>Strype's Stow's <hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, Vol. II. p. <num value="2">2</num>.</NOTE>
At the present time, this Ward is usually represented by the senior Alderman, called the Father of the City, who is removed thither upon a vacancy as an honourable retirement from the fatigue of office: and Mr. Bray adds that he has been sometimes allowed <num value="500">500</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> per annum for the duties which he is supposed to perform there.<NOTE N="c"><P><hi rend=italics>History and Antiquities of the County of Surrey</hi>, by Rev.

<P>By the charter of Edward VI. the Lord-Mayor, the Recorder, and all the Aldermen <hi rend=italics>past the Chair</hi>, were appointed Justices of the Peace for Southwark; and it is probable that at even an early period the Lord Mayor held his Court there, by virtue of the authority with which he had been long previously invested. As this part of Surrey, however, began to increase in population and improvement, the government of Southwark was exercised partly by the County-Magistrates; though the Lord-Mayor of London still continued to hold a session at certain periods, at the Town-Hall on St. Margaret's Hill in the Borough. From the earliest notice of such an edifice in Southwark, in <datestruct value="1540--"><year reg="1540">1540</year></datestruct>, the <num value="32">32nd</num> year of Henry VIII., it appears to have existed on the same spot as that which it still occupies, the north, or upper end of St. Margaret's Hill, beyond the Borough High-Street. In the same place formerly stood the Parish-Church of St. Margaret, which Henry I, gave to the Priory of St. Mary Overie. After the erection of the new Parish of St. Saviour in <datestruct value="1540--"><year reg="1540">1540</year></datestruct>, by the union of those of St. Margaret and St. Mary Magdalen,&mdash;a part of this Church was used as a Court, and the other part as a prison; but it is stated to have been then taken down, and the site granted to John Pope, <datestruct VALUE="1545-10-3"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=3>3rd</day>, <year reg=1545>1545</year></datestruct>, the <num value="37">37th</num> year of Henry VIII.<NOTE N="d"><P><hi rend=italics>Hist. of Surrey</hi>, vol. iii. p. <num value="553">553</num>.</NOTE> It is possible, however, that this destruction and grant were only partial, and that some portion of the building remained altered into a Court-House; such a place being noticed here <num value="5">five</num> years previous, and also as having continued until <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>, when it was burned down, and the building represented in the annexed View erected on the spot. 
<P>The Court-room of this edifice stood over a low and deep colonnade, and consisted of a brick building nearly square, covered with plaster, with a high-pointed tiled roof, an ornamental cornice, and stone quoins at the angles. <pb id="p.40" n="40"> The principal apartment was lighted by <num value="6">six</num> tall and narrow transom-casements, arched at the top; <num value="2">two</num> of which were in the front of the Hall towards St. Margaret's Hill, and between them was a handsome stone niche, with Corinthian columns, and a circular pediment and pedestal, containing a statue of Charles II. with the following inscription. &ldquo;COMBUSTUM AN. <datestruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>.

THE RIGHT HON. SIR ROBERT KITE, LORD MAYOR, S. P. Q. L. JOHN SHEWELL AND JOHN TOVEY, BRIDGE- MASTERS. PETER ROBERTS, ESQ. COMPTROLLER OF THE WORKS AND REVENUES OF LONDON BRIDGE.&rdquo; In the pediment over the statue, were originally inserted the royal arms, and on the top of the pediment a double sun dial, on which were the following mottoes. &ldquo;Dum spectas fugio&mdash;whilst you look I flie&mdash;Tempus Edax Rerum&mdash;Time is a Devourer of things.&rdquo; Beneath the windows on <num value="1">one</num> side the niche, was a shield with the City arms; and on the other the device of Southwark, connected by wreaths. The interior of the Hall was also decorated with the same armorial ensigns over the Lord Mayor's seat, which was likewise ornamented with carved wooden figures of Justice and Wisdom, and a stand for the City Sword, carved and gilt. 
<P>For some years previous to its demolition, the Old Town Hall of Southwark was in a very ruinous state; and at a sessions holden there in <datestruct VALUE="1793-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>, Sir James Sanderson, the Lord Mayor, stated to the Grand Jury that proper notice had been taken of its dilapidations, and that he hoped in future to meet them in a more convenient place. In April the workmen began to demolish the building, and the next Sessions were holden on <datestruct VALUE="-06-29"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=29>29th</day></datestruct> at the <num value="3">Three</num> Tuns Tavern, on St. Margaret's Hill; where the Jurors were only sworn and dismissed with a speech from the Recorder. The Lord Mayor, however, addressed them rather as principal inhabitants of Southwark, and stated that it had been suggested to the Committee for building the Town Hall, that it would be of great utility to have a clock erected on the front of it, and enquired their sentiments on the subject, which were given in the affirmative. Before the meeting dispersed it was stated to the Court by Mr. Muggeridge, that he had formerly presented a memorial to the Committee of City Lands recommending the consideration of the propriety of rounding the corner turning into Counter Street, on the western side of the Town Hall, to render the entrance more convenient and free from danger. The Lord Mayor promised to represent this request, but added that as the colonnade which formerly rendered that avenue so inconvenient, would be omitted in the new building, he did not think it would be complied with. Mr. Ellis contended that though this projection were to be avoided, the same evil, or a greater would still remain; since in the old building the colonnade could be used as a shelter above, whilst in the new edifice the same space of ground was to be inclosed within an iron railing to preserve the City's right, without any corresponding benefit. The Lord Mayor only repeated his former promise, and the Court broke up.<NOTE N="a"><P>The description of the Old Town Hall, and the account of its removal, are derived from <hi rend=italics>The History and Antiquities of the Parish of St. Saviour, Seuthwark</hi>; by M. Concannen, Jun. and A.

<P>The present Town Hall Southwark, was erected in <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>, and consists of a plain, though handsome building of brick, with stone ballustrades on the parapet, entablature, pilasters, panels, and ground floor which is channelled. It rises <num value="2">two</num> storys above the street, the <num value="1">first</num> of which is lighted by lofty semi-circular windows, and contains the court-room; the lower floor being occupied chiefly by offices. Between the <num value="2">two</num> windows in front is a flat stone arched recess, containing a clock; which in <datestruct VALUE="1834-02--"><month reg="02">February</month> <year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>, was made transparent with a glass dial and metal figures, and illuminated behind with gas. In building the present Hall the front was made level with that of the handsome modern house on the eastern side of it represented in the annexed Engraving; which was also erected in <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>, upon the site of some very mean buildings, and once imparted a great degree of ornament and dignity to this part of the Borough. It was at <num value="1">first</num> occupied as a banking-house, under the firm of Sir James Sanderson, Harrison, Brenchley, Bloxham, and Co.; which, after some alterations, was succeeded by that of Wilkinson, Polhill, Bloxham, Pinhorn, and Bulcock. About <datestruct VALUE="1833-07--"><month reg="07">July</month> <year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, the building was entirely removed, together with the whole of the western side of High-Street, Borough, for the formation of the south approach to the New London Bridge, called Wellington-Street; when a small part of the ground occupied by this house was added to the width of the Town-Hall, enclosing the stair-case to the court-room. 
<P>On taking down the old Court-House the statue of Charles II. was bought by some inhabitants of the vicinity, and erected as an ornament in the centre of <num value="3">Three</num> King Court, in the Borough High Street, upon a pedestal of brick and stone-work, containing a watch-box. This figure was also removed in <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>; and at the present time (<datestruct VALUE="1834-04--"><month reg="04">April</month> <year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>) stands in a garden in St. George's Road, Kent Road. The effigies of Justice and Wisdom from the Lord Mayor's Seat in the Old Town Hall, were taken to the <num value="3">Three</num> Crowns Coffee-House kept by a Mr. West, and set up near the bar: upon the several changes in the situations of all which figures, the following contemporaneous epigram has been preserved.

<P>On the south side of Basing Lane, Bread Street Ward, stood Gerrard's Hall, originally the dwelling and mansion of John Gisors, Mayor of London in the year <datestruct value="1245"><year reg="1245">1245</year></datestruct>, and of Sir John Gisors, Knt. Mayor of London and Constable of the Tower anno <datestruct value="1311"><year reg="1311">1311</year></datestruct>, who, with divers others of his name and family, since that time, have resided here. It takes its name of Gerrard's Hall from a fabulous legend of a giant named Gerrard having, in times long since, occupied it; and in Stow's time a fir pole, which reached to the roof, was shown as <num value="1">one</num> of the staves that Gerrard the giant used in the wars to run withal; there stood also a ladder of the same length, which, it was said, served to ascend to the top of the staff. The pole measured nearly <num value="40">forty</num> feet: and what did not lessen the belief of many in the size and strength of the marvellous owner, may be acounted for, from the assertion of a grave historian of the time of Queen Elizabeth: R. G. (Richard Grafton), in his Brief Collection of Histories says, &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>I, the writer hereof, did see, the</hi> <num value="10">10</num><hi rend=italics>th day of March, in the year of our Lord</hi> <datestruct value="1564--"><year reg="1564">1564</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>and had the same in my hand, the tooth of a man which weighed <num value="10">ten</num> ounces of Troy weight</hi><NOTE N="*"><P>It certainly must have been a stray tooth of the mammoth Grafton describes; or such a fabricated deception he as readily received and gave credit to, as his succeeding brother historian, Sir Richard Baker, has recorded in his very marvellous and faithful Chronicle of England. Still he has rendered his giant a dwarf in proportion, as it would require a shin bone of <num value="16">sixteen</num> rather than <num value="6">six</num> feet in length, to carry a mouthful of teeth, <num value="1">one</num> of which weighed near a pound.</NOTE>. <hi rend=italics>And the skull of the same man is extant, and to be seen, which will hold <num value="5">five</num> pecks of wheat. And the shin bone of the same man is <num value="6">six</num> foot in length, and of a marvellous greatness.</hi>&rdquo; Out of this Gisors' Hall, at the <num value="1">first</num> building thereof, were made divers arched doors, yet to be seen, which seem not sufficient for any great monster, or other than men of common stature to pass through. The pole in the Hall might be used, in old time, as then the custom was in every parish, to be set up in the street in the summer as a May-pole, before the principal hall or house in the parish or street; and to stand in the Hall before the scrine, decked with holly and ivy, at the feast of Christmas; and the ladder might serve for the decking the May-pole and roof of the Hall. 
<P>The house was built upon arched vaults, and with arched gates, of stone brought from Caen in Normandy; which clearly proves the foundation to have been shortly after the Norman conquest, anno <datestruct value="1066"><year reg="1066">1066</year></datestruct>. 
<P>In the troublesome reign of Edward II. it was ordained in Parliament, that every city and town in England, according to its ability, should raise and maintain a certain number of soldiers against the Scots, who at that time, by their great depredations, had laid waste all the north of England as far as York and Lancaster. The quota of London to that expedition being <num value="200">two hundred</num> men, it was <num value="5">five</num> times the number that was sent by any other city or town in the kingdom. To meet this requisition, the mayor in council levied a rate on the city, the raising of which was the occasion of continual broils between the magistrates and freemen, which ended in the Jury of Aldermanbury making a presentation before the Justices itinerant and the Lord Treasurer, sitting in the Tower of London, saying, &ldquo;That the commonalty of London is, and ought to be common, and that the citizens are not bound to be taxed without the special command of the king, or without their common consent; that the mayors of the city, and the <hi rend=italics>custodes</hi> in their times, after the common redemption made and paid for the city of London, have come, and by their own authority, without the king's command and commons' consent, did tax the said city according to their own wills once and more, and distrained for those taxes, sparing the rich, and oppressing the poor middle sort; not permitting, that the arrearages due from the rich be levied, to the disinheriting of the king, and the destruction of the city; nor can the commons know what becomes of the monies levied of such taxes.&rdquo; 
<P>They also complained, that the said mayor and aldermen had taken upon them to turn out of the commoncouncil, men at their pleasure; and that the mayor and superiors of the city had deposed <hi rend=italics>Walter Henry</hi> from acting in the common council, because he would not permit the rich to levy tallages upon the poor, till they themselves had paid their arrears of former tallages. Upon which Sir JOHN GISORS, some time lord mayor, and divers other principal citizens, were summoned to attend the said justices, and personally to answer to the accusations laid against them. But, being conscious of guilt, they fled from justice, screening themselves under the difficulty of the times. 
<P>How long Sir JOHN GISORS continued absent from London does not appear; but probably, on the dethronement of Edward II. and accession of Edward III. he might join the prevailing party, and return to his mansion without any dread of molestation from the power of ministers and favourites of the late reign, who were at this period held in universal detestation. Sir John Gisors died, and is buried in Our Lady's Chapel, Christ Church, Faringdon Within. 
<P>Gerrard's Hall, on the decease of Sir John Gisors, came into possession of William Gisors, <num value="1">one</num> of the sheriffs in <datestruct value="1329--"><year reg="1329">1329</year></datestruct>; afterwards to Thomas Gisors, who, deceasing in <datestruct value="1358--"><year reg="1358">1358</year></datestruct>, left unto his son Thomas his messuage, called Gisors. Hall<NOTE N="*"><P>By this it appears, that Gisors' Hall by corruption hath been called Gerrard's Hall; as Blossoms Inn for Bosom's Inn, Bevis Marks for Burie's Marks, Mark Lane for Mart Lane, Billiter Lane for Belzeter's Lane, Gutter Lane for Guthurun's Lane, Cry or Cree Church for Christ Church, St. Michel in the Quern for St. Michel at Corn, &amp;c.</NOTE>, in the parish of St. Mildred, in Bread Street; of which John Gisors made a feoffment in <datestruct value="1386--"><year reg="1386">1386</year></datestruct>, and alienated it from his family. 
<P>To what use Gerrard's Hall was applied after the Gisors family had quitted it, does not appear; but most likely it was purchased to the use we find it afterwards converted to, namely, an inn for accommodation of travellers, foreign traders, merchants, &amp;c. Maitland speaks of it as in his time an inn of good repute, and notices the arched vaults, supported by <num value="16">sixteen</num> pillars, as a great curiosity. 
<P>The general appearance of these vaulted chambers of ancient mansions has induced many persons to imagine them as appropriated solely to religious uses, particularly as they so frequently occur under the foundations of religious stuctures: but there is every reason to think they were appropriated at <num value="1">first</num> to the purposes they are at present applied to, that is, store chambers to desposit goods; of which merchants in a large way of traffic always stood in need. The yaults of Gerrard's (or Gisors') Hall, at present belong to Messrs. Jervis and Moore, wine-merchants, and are used to store the commodities they deal in. 
<P>A gigantic figure holding a truncheon, representing a military character of the early ages, still ornaments the entrance to Gerrard's Hall Inn and Tavern, at present in the occupation of Mr. Ivatts. <pb id="p.43" n="43">

<P>This handsome Gothic structure, which is situate between the east end of <hi rend=italics>Leadenhall</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Fenchurch</hi> Streets, under the houses fronting the pump at Aldgate, is still remaining entire, exhibiting a most beautiful specimen of ancient architecture. It measures north by south <num value="46">forty-six</num> feet in length, and east by west <num value="17">seventeen</num> feet in breadth, and from the floor to the vertex of the arch <num value="11">eleven</num> feet <num value="11">eleven</num> inches in height; but as the capitals of the pillars at present appear only <num value="4">four</num> feet above the floor, the altitude of the arches at <num value="1">first</num> might have amounted to eighteen feet. 
<P>This Church, by <num value="2">two</num> handsome intersected pillars, which support <num value="3">three</num> beautiful stone arches, is divided into <num value="2">two</num> aisles, the entry into which was by a door in the east side, in which were likewise small windows, as were also in the ends thereof; and adjoining to the Church, on the west, are the remains of a square stone building, but for what use the same was originally employed cannot now be ascertained, though probably it was either a steeple, a vestry-room, or parsonage-house. The walls are of square pieces of chalk, in the manner of Rochester Castle, and the arches of stone, exhibiting as skilful masonry as any thing in this age of refinement. 
<P>It is evident that this and many other at present subterraneous buildings were never so intended at their <num value="1">first</num> foundation, but have become such from the vast rise of the ground surrounding them, in consequence of the destructive fires that so frequently happened in the early ages, burying in the ruins nearly that part of the city which escaped destruction by the devouring flames. 
<P>An ancient historian relates, that &ldquo;London, in the year <datestruct value="764"><year reg="764">764</year></datestruct>, became a great sufferer by fire, and in the dreadful conflagration many of its inhabitants perished. Nor was it well recovered of this before it was again visited with a similar misfortune, by which a great number of its then remaining buildings were destroyed.&rdquo; 
<P>Anno <datestruct value="1136"><year reg="1136">1136</year></datestruct>. A very great fire happened in the City, which began in the house of <num value="1">one</num> Ailward, near London Stone, and consumed all the way east to Aldgate, and west to St. Erkenwald's shrine in St. Paul's Cathedral, both which it destroyed, together with London Bridge, which was then constructed of wood. 
<P>It is reasonable to conjecture, that the accumulation of ruins these extensive fires occasioned left the distressed inhabitants little choice in their determination; and as it would have caused infinite trouble and inconvenience to have cleared and removed the same, they wisely preferred sacrificing a few (to them) useless buildings, raised and levelled the ground, and began a foundation for new dwellings on the site of the roofs of some of their remaining habitations. The amazing descent to the banks of the Thames from several parts of the City confirms the opinion that most of the buildings denominated crypts, oratories, or undercrofts, were, in their pristine states, level in their foundations with the dwelling-places of their original builders. What greatly adds to the probability is the circumstance of our being informed that near <hi rend=italics>Belzeter's Lane</hi> (Billiter Lane) and <hi rend=italics>Lime Street</hi>, <num value="3">three</num> new houses being to be built, in the year <datestruct value="1590"><year reg="1590">1590</year></datestruct>, in a place where was a large garden plot inclosed from the street by a high brick wall, upon taking down the said wall and digging for cellarage, another wall of stone was found directly under the brick wall with an arched gateway of stone, and gates of timber to be closed in the midst towards the street. The timber of the gates was consumed, but the hinges of iron were then remaining on their staples on both sides: moreover, in that wall were square windows with bars of iron on each side this gate. The wall was above <num value="2">two</num> fathoms deep under ground, supposed to be the remains of those great fires before mentioned. Again, we learn, on the east side of <hi rend=italics>Lime Street</hi> opening into <hi rend=italics>Fenchurch Street</hi>, on that site, after the fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, Sir Thomas Cullum built <num value="30">thirty</num> houses, and that a short time previous to <datestruct value="1757--"><year reg="1757">1757</year></datestruct>, the cellar of <num value="1">one</num> of the houses giving way, there was discovered an arched room, <num value="10">ten</num> feet square and <num value="8">eight</num> feet deep, with several arched doors round it stopped up with earth. <pb id="p.45" n="45">

<P>The fire described in the preceding pages, disclosed to public view the remains of <num value="2">two</num> ancient buildings, the very existence of which was almost wholly unknown, and the original design and name of which could be only conjectured. They appear to have been <num value="1">first</num> noticed in the <hi rend=italics>Public Ledger</hi> of Saturday, <datestruct VALUE="1765-12-7"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=7>7th</day>, <year reg=1765>1765</year></datestruct>, page <num value="2070">2070</num>; where it is stated, that &ldquo;in the ruins in Cornhill and Bishopsgate Street, occasioned by the last fire, there appear the remains of the Church of St Peter, formerly the Metropolitan Church of England, afterwards removed to Canterbury.&rdquo;<NOTE N="*"><P>This supposition appears to have been very soon abandoned; for in the <hi rend=italics>Gazetteer and New Daily Advertiser</hi> of Saturday, <datestruct VALUE="-12-28"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=28>28th</day></datestruct>, after the extracts from Maitland given above, it is observed that &ldquo;from this account there can be no reason to suppose, as hinted in the papers, cither of these ancient fabrics was the ancient church of St. Peter, the <num value="1">first</num> Christian church builded by King Lucius, about <num value="400">400</num> years before the coming in of St. Austin, as set forth in a table in St. Peter's, Cornhill; the truth of which is greatly doubted by Maitland and several other good historians.&rdquo;</NOTE> The only foundation for this statement appears to have been the tradition of the extreme antiquity of that Church, recorded on a brass tablet still preserved there, a representation and an account of which are also contained in this work:&mdash; whence it was supposed that, as the district of Cornhill extended from the west end of Leadenhall to the Stocks Market, the original edifice might have stood at some distance from the present erection. The general age of that St. Peter's Church which was destroyed in the Great Fire, is commonly believed to have been about the time of Edward IV., from the armorial ensigns of various noble persons of that period, with which it was decorated as benefactors to the structure. It is probable, however, that their gifts extended to its <hi rend=italics>repair</hi> only, and the <hi rend=italics>finishing</hi> of its roof and windows, and that the steeple of the old building was actually of a date more ancient than the architecture of the ruins discovered in Leadenhall Street; the style of which appears to have been that of about the latter end of the <num value="12">twelfth</num>, or commencement of the <num value="13">thirteenth</num>, century. In the year <datestruct value="1738"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct> Maitland appears to have had an extraordinary opportunity of examining all the ancient architectural remains in this spot and its vicinity: and the following particular description of them, extracted from Entinck's edition of his <hi rend=italics>History of London</hi>, Lond. <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, folio, Vol. ii. page <datestruct value="1176--"><year reg="1176">1176</year></datestruct>, will convey the best general notion of their appearance:&mdash; 
<P>&ldquo;Under the corner house of Leadenhall and Bishopsgate Streets, and <num value="2">two</num> houses on the east, and <num value="1">one</num> on the north, side thereof, was situate a very ancient Church of Gothic construction, the principal part of which is still remaining under the said corner house, and <num value="2">two</num> adjoining in Leadenhall Street; but part of the north aisle beneath the house contiguous in Bishopsgate Street, was lately obliged to make way to enlarge the cellar. When or by whom this old church was founded I cannot learn, it not being so much as mentioned by any of our historians or surveyors of London that I can discover: However, the inside of it appears of the length of <num value="40">40</num> feet, and the breath of <num value="26">26</num> and <num value="1">1</num> inch; the former whereof consists of <num value="4">four</num> arches, and the latter of <num value="2">two</num> aisles; that towards the south being of the breadth of <num value="9">9</num> feet <num value="3">3</num> inches, and that on the north <num value="16">16</num> feet, which shews the small pillars to be only <num value="10">ten</num> inches in diameter. The roof of this ancient structure, which is a flattish Gothic arch, is at present only <num value="10">ten</num> feet <num value="9">nine</num> inches above the present floor; wherefore I suppose that this church originally was not above the height of <num value="17">seventeen</num> feet within; which, together with <num value="3">three</num> feet, the thickness of the arch, as lately discovered by a perforation, shews that the ground is very much raised in this neighbourhood. The walls of this church being so much decayed and patched with brickwork, I could discover neither door nor window therein; however, an entrance to the chief part thereof, A. D. <datestruct value="1738"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct>, is at Mr. Jones's, a distiller, opposite Leadenhall Gate.&rdquo;&mdash;It is this building, the remaining vestiges of which are exhibited in the annexed Engraving; and which are now contained in a kitchen in the basement-story of No. <num value="153">153</num>, still in the occupation of Messrs. John Robinson and Son, Silversmiths, on the north side of Leadenhall Street. These remains consist of part of <num value="3">three</num> piers of the ancient building, with <num value="2">two</num> broad pointed arches springing from short round columns with octangular capitals; the pillars themselves being greatly reduced in height by the raising of the floor of the apartment, and the extreme points of the arches being cut off by the modern ceiling. A small representation of the left hand arch, partly filled up by a glass door, is given in the <hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi> for <datestruct VALUE="1795-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>, Vol. lxv. part ii. page <num value="809">809</num>, Plate <num value="1">1</num>. No. <num value="3">3</num>. Beneath the present view of the above kitchen, is a representation of the line of houses erected in Leadenhall Street on the site of those destroyed in <datestruct VALUE="1765-11--"><month reg="11">November</month> <year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, when these ancient ruins were re-opened. That with a pediment over the windows of the <num value="2">second</num> story is the <num value="1">one</num> in which this part of the old remains is situate; and in the pediment is contained a memorial of the conflagration, and the inhabitant at that time, carved in stone, the figures of which are copied in outline between the <num value="2">two</num> subjects of the annexed Plate. They consist of a circular tablet in the centre, bearing the following inscription in Latin&mdash;&ldquo;Consumed by Fire: Restored <datestruct value="1766--"><year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct>, by T (homas) T (readway);&rdquo; who, it may be seen by the preceding list of the sufferers, was a Glover on this spot when the house was destroyed. On each side of this tablet is a stone cartouche shield, sculptured with the arms of Treadway, a bend charged with <num value="3">three</num> mullets; beneath <num value="1">one</num> of which are the owner's initials, and beneath the other the date of <datestruct value="1766--"><year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Some other ancient architectural remains, perhaps originally connected with the former, were also found under the houses extending up the eastern site of Bishopsgate Street. The description of their situation given by Maitland, fixes their locality to the side of the very house at which the fire of <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct> commenced; and which appears to have continued until that time in the same kind of occupation as it was when the ensuing account of these ruins was written. &ldquo;At the distance of <num value="12">12</num> feet from this church,&rdquo;&mdash;namely the remains already noticed at the north-east corner of Leadenhall Street,&mdash;&ldquo;is to be seen, under the house at the late Mr. Macadam's, a peruke-maker in Bishopsgate Street, a stone building of the length of <num value="30">30</num> feet, breadth of <num value="14">14</num>, and altitude of <num value="8">8</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches above the present floor; with a door in the north-side, and a window at the east end, as there probably was <num value="1">one</num> in the west. <pb id="p.46" n="46"> It is covered with a semi-circular arch, built with small piers of chalk in the form of bricks, and ribbed with stone, resembling those of the arches of a bridge. What this edifice at <num value="1">first</num> was appropriated to is very uncertain; though, by the manner of its construction, it seems to have been a chapel; but the ground having been since raised on all sides, it was probably converted into a subterraneous repository for merchandise;<NOTE N="*"><P>This is well known to have been the case with the crypt, or under-chapel of the ancient building dedicated to St. Thomas, formerly standing about the centre of old London Bridge. In the <hi rend=italics>Morning Advertiser</hi> of <datestruct VALUE="1798-04-26"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=26>26th</day>, <year reg=1798>1798</year></datestruct>, it is stated that <num value="1">one</num> of the arches in the lower part of the edifice was used for <num value="50">fifty</num> years by Messrs. Gill and Wright, Stationers, as a paper-warehouse: and that &ldquo;although the floor was always at high water mark from <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="12">twelve</num> feet under surface, yet, such was the excellency of the materials and masonry, that not the least damp or leak ever happened; and the paper was kept as safe and dry as it would have been in a garret.&rdquo;&mdash;A similar instance of the use of an under-chapel or crypt as a warehouse, is that of St. Michael, Aldgate, formerly belonging to Messrs. Tipper and Fry, Stationers, of which an account and engraving will be found in the <num value="1">first</num> volume of the present work.</NOTE> for a pair of stone stairs, with a descending arch over them, seems to have been erected since the fabric was built.&rdquo; 
<P>The re-discovery and removal of these ruins upon clearing the ground after the fire of <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, gave rise to some discussion as to their probable design and name. A view of the interior of the principal building at the corner of Bishopsgate Street, with an article on the subject, appeared in the <hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi> for <datestruct VALUE="1766-02--"><month reg="02">February</month> <year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct>, Vol. xxxvi. page <num value="56">56</num>; in which it was suggested, that the larger ruins had once formed the crypt of a church, and the smaller a charnel-house, or oratory: and Malcolm also considers it probable that they might have constituted &ldquo;small chantry chapels, or crypts of such, the founders of which are forgotten.&rdquo;<NOTE N="*"><P><hi rend=italics>Londinum Redivivum.</hi> Vol. iv.

<P>At the south east corner of the Old Palace Yard, Westminster, is a short wide passage formerly called Parliament Place, leading to an approach to the river named Parliament Stairs: which landing was in <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct> cut off by a modern wall built across the end of it. On the left of this passage, stood the south wall of the Prince's Chamber, in the ancient Palace of Westminster,<NOTE N="a"><P>Mr. Capon has stated at the close of his original description of this Vault, that he possessed an extensive collection of the most minute plans, perspective views, and measurements, of all the remaining buildings of the Old Palace of Westminster: a perfect ground-plan of which, with that of the ancient substructure of the Abbey, had occupied his leisure for upwards of <num value="30">thirty</num> years, even to the period of his death which took place <datestruct VALUE="1827-09-26"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=26>26th</day>, <year reg=1827>1827</year></datestruct>, at the age of <num value="70">70</num>. Of the remains of the Old Palace he composed a scene for the present Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, representing that structure as it might have appeared <num value="3">three</num> centuries since; with <num value="2">two</num> large wings to the same containing other portions of the edifice, derived from an ancient draught which he found in looking over some records in the Augmentation Office at Westminster. &mdash;<hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi>, <datestruct VALUE="1827-10--"><month reg="10">Oct.</month> <year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>. vol. xcvii. part ii. p. <num value="375">375</num>.</NOTE> beneath which was the <hi rend=italics><num value="1">first</num></hi> cellar hired by the Conspirators of the Gunpowder Plot; the entrance whereto was through a door in an adjoining house in a small enclosed court, behind or at the river end of the Prince's Chamber. When the plan of the conspiracy had been decided on and matured, Thomas Percy, <num value="1">one</num> of the principal plotters, hired for their use a house at Westminster, near adjoining to the Parliament, and it is supposed from the situation of the building, that it must have stood upon a spot formerly occupied by the Ordnance Office, a plain square white house with a pediment, at the south end of Westminster Hall, or on the left side of the King's late entrance to the Prince's Chamber and to the House of Lords. In the substructure this dwelling was joined by a cellar immediately beneath the Prince's Chamber, most probably at the time belonging to the house which stood there; but there is no doubt that the mining was commenced in that cellar about <datestruct VALUE="1604-12-11"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=11>11th</day>, <year reg=1604>1604</year></datestruct>. In the confession of Guy Fawkes it is stated, that when the conspirators came to the very foundation of the wall of their house and discovered the difficulty of their labour, they took to their assistance Robert Winter, and it is added that it was about Christmas when they arrived at the wall, and about Candlemas they had wrought the wall half through. Whilst they were employed in piercing it they heard a rushing in an adjoining cellar of the removing of coals, when fearing that they were discovered they sent Fawkes to procure information: who, on his return brought word that it was a cellar wherein sea-coals had been deposited, which were then on sale, and that the cellar itself was to be let.<NOTE N="b"><P>Confession of Guy Fawkes contained in <hi rend=italics>A Relation of the Gunpowder Treason</hi>, by Thomas Barlow, Bishop of Lincoln, Lond. <datestruct value="1679--"><year reg="1679">1679</year></datestruct>, sm. <num value="8">8</num>vo. pp. <num value="41">41</num>, <num value="42">42</num>.</NOTE> This was the place represented in the annexed Engraving, believed to have been originally the kitchen of the old Palace; and in position erected north and south between the Prince's and the Painted Chambers.

It was intended that the whole should be fired by a train, or slow-match, which would burn a certain time before exploding; in which interim Fawkes hoped to have passed safely through the doors leading into the court behind the Prince's Chamber, and thence down the passage to Parliament Stairs, where a boat was to wait for him to carry him to Lambeth. He expected by means of the water to escape the shock; which, however the conspirators suppose would have levelled and destroyed the whole of London and Westminster like an earthquake. The execution of <num value="4">four</num> of these persons, namely, Thomas Winter, Ambrose Rookwood, Robert Keyes, and Guy Fawkes, took place close to the exterior of the building in which this cellar was situate, as the scene of their intended crime; since it is stated that they were brought from the Tower to the Old Palace in Westminster, over against the Parliament House, and there executed.<NOTE N="e"><P><hi rend=italics>State Trials</hi>, vol. i. col. <num value="248">248</num>.

<P>The annexed Engraving consists of a view of the whole length of the ancient Crypt under the Old House of Lords,<NOTE N="b"><P>This was a narrow apartment or gallery, standing north and south, forming part of the Prince's lodgings, and connecting the Prince's and Painted Chambers, After the union with Ireland in <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>, a larger room was required for the accommodation of the <num value="32">32</num> additional Peers representing that kingdom; and the Court of Requests, formerly bearing the name of Whitehall, was appointed to be the future House of Lords. In the <hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi> for <datestruct VALUE="1807-07--"><month reg="07">July</month> <year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>, Vol. lxxvii. part ii. pp. <num value="623">623</num>, <num value="624">624</num>, are some remarks upon the very ordinary and ill-adapted fittings up of that place and the neglected state of the former apartments, with the Prince's and Painted Chambers: both before and since the accession of George IV., however, the House of Lords was decorated in a richer and more appropriate manner, and the other chambers having fallen into decay were taken down in <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> looking to the north end, or toward Charing Cross: the drawing for which was <num value="1">first</num> measured and executed in <datestruct VALUE="1799-07--"><month reg="07">July</month> <year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>, and finished previous to the demolition of the structure in <datestruct VALUE="1823-06--"><month reg="06">June</month> <year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>. The vault represented was <num value="77">77</num> feet in length by <num value="24">24</num> feet <num value="4">4</num> inches in width, and at the time referred to was only <num value="10">10</num> feet in height; but the original flooring was about <num value="4">4</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches below that shewn in the view. Mr. Capon considered from the style of the masonry that the large open doorway on the right, with all the lower parts of the walls, and the half-arch at the end of the vault,&mdash;were some of the earliest portions of the Old Palace of Westminster, erected in the times of Edward the Confessor, and William I. and II.; but that almost all the visible remainder of the architecture was of the age of Henry III. superadded to the original work. His description also states that it was through the large doorway on the right that Guy Fawkes is said to have intended escaping after he had fired the train to the combustibles deposited in the crypt; since that entrance led through a <num value="2">second</num> modern door in a court at the east end of the Prince's Chamber. On the western side of the crypt was a small apartment covered with modern brick vaulting, to which there was a communication through a large ancient stone doorway, under the <num value="1">first</num> arch on the left in the annexed view; in which vault there remained the form of an aperture in the stone wall stopped up with old brick-work, a memorial of the original breach commenced by the Powder Plot conspirators. On the south side of the same vaulted room appeared a very ancient doorway, with ornamented imposts from which sprung a segmental-arch surmounted by a semicircular-arch: the doorway led into apartments lastly occupied as wine-cellars under the Prince's Chamber or Lodgings, as that part of the Palace is denominated in a plan of the edifice of the time of Charles II,&mdash;The dark red projecting brick-work enclosing a semicircular arch on the right hand of the present View, was erected to support a fire-place in the Old House of Lords above, the hearth of which was a very large slab of Portland stone, about <num value="10">10</num> or <num value="11">11</num> feet in length, <num value="4">4</num> feet in width, and <num value="5">5</num> or <num value="6">6</num> inches in solidity. This was the work of Inigo Jones, as were also the <num value="12">twelve</num> octangular oaken pillars, fixed upon socles, or solid plinths of stone, placed down the centre of the Crypt to sustain the weight of the apartment over it. Only the upper and lower portions of these pillars are represented in the annexed Plate, to prevent the obstruction of many material and interesting parts of the walls. In the distance on the right under a half-arch, was a very ancient privy, the seat of which was formed by the edge of an upright stone and the entrance by a low and narrow triangular arch, constructed of <num value="2">two</num> stones placed conically from the sides and meeting at the apex.<NOTE N="c"><P>A large separate view of this doorway is engraven in mezzotinto in Smith's <hi rend=italics>Antiquities of Westminster</hi>, p. <num value="41">41</num>: in which is also shewn part of a cylindrical stone staircase leading to the Painted Chamber It is said to have been in this recess that Guy Fawkes was discovered ready to fire the train.</NOTE> Though actually above the ground, from its situation the whole of this Crypt was totally dark when the measurements and draughts of it were originally taken in <datestruct VALUE="1799-07--"><month reg="07">July</month> <year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>, by candle-light; though about noon at that season an imperfect light entered for a short time from an adjoining passage on the east, at the end of which were <num value="2">two</num> windows and a door-way looking full south: there had been also a small lancet-window in the recess at the end of the Crypt, which was stopped up at the time this view was taken, but was afterwards re-opened. The centre arch at the northern end was filled up with wood-work enclosing a large square door opening into a wide passage beyond, wherein was a door with a semi-circular arch, leading into a fine vaulted apartment with segmental-arches of very good workmanship, under the eastern end of the Painted Chamber. In the annexed View the whole of these doorways are supposed to be open, to shew as much as possible of the place represented. 
<P>Some few years previous to the entire removal of this Crypt, the arches were altered, the floor was paved, and the whole apartment modernised, to form a Repository for the Journals of the House of Lords. About <datestruct VALUE="1823-08--"><month reg="08">August</month> <year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, commenced the demolition of the Prince's Chamber and other ancient rooms connecting them at the top of the King's staircase, they being then in a ruinous state, together with this Crypt and the other vaults beneath; and in October were laid the foundations of Sir John Soane's Royal Gallery, which was finished <datestruct VALUE="1824-02-1"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=1>1st</day>, <year reg=1824>1824</year></datestruct>.

<P>In <datestruct value="1419--"><year reg="1419">1419</year></datestruct>, Simon Eyre, Citizen and Alderman, appears to have commenced the erection of a public Granary upon this spot; as related by Stow, on the authority of &ldquo;certain evidences of an alley and tenements pertaining to the horse-mill, adjoining to the said Leaden-hall in Grass Street, given by William Kingstone, Fishmonger, unto the Parish of St. Peter upon Cornhill.&rdquo;<NOTE N="a"><P>In a volume of official returns of the chantries attached to the Church of St. Peter upon Cornhill, drawn up in the reign of Edward VI. it is recorded that William Kingston gave to find <num value="1">one</num> priest, a lamp, and an obit, all his lands in the Parish, <measure value="44l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="44">44</num></measure>. <num value="7">7</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi></NOTE> The building, however, seems to have been decayed, or the whole of the founder's design was incomplete, upwards of <num value="20">twenty</num> years afterwards; since &ldquo;to make anew a common granary,&rdquo; was <num value="1">one</num> of those costly, but highly useful and ornamental, improvements in the City, undertaken by the Corporation in <datestruct value="1442--"><year reg="1442">1442</year></datestruct>-<num value="43">43</num>, under the Mayoralty of John Aderly, or Hatherly.

<P>The building then completed was of squared stone, and of a quadrangular form, as represented in the annexed views, having a large CHAPEL on the eastern side; over the porch of which the founder caused to be inscribed, from Psalm cxvii. <num value="16">16</num>, according to the Latin Vulgate, &ldquo;DEXTERA DOMINI EXALTAVIT ME:&rdquo; the right hand of the Lord hath exalted me: a tablet on the north wall within the chapel, exhibited the following inscription also commemorative of him, commencing, &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Honorandus famosus mercator, Simon Eyre, hujus operis, &amp;c.</hi> The honourable and famous Merchant, Simon Eyre, Founder of this Work, once Mayor of this city, Citizen and Draper of the same, departed out of this life the <datestruct VALUE="-09-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> day of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>, in the year from the Incarnation of Christ, <datestruct value="1459--"><year reg="1459">1459</year></datestruct>, and the <num value="38">38th</num> year of the reign of Henry VI.; and was buried in his Parish Church of St. Mary Woolnoth, in Lombard Street.&rdquo;<NOTE N="a"><P>Sir Simon Eyre was Sheriff of London in <datestruct value="1434--"><year reg="1434">1434</year></datestruct>, and Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1445--"><year reg="1445">1445</year></datestruct>, the <num value="24">24th</num> year of Henry VI. He was the son of John Eyre, of Brandon, in the County of Suffolk; and is traditionally said to have risen to wealth and eminence from a very inferior situation in life, which may also be inferred from his inscription mentioned above. He originally belonged to the Company of Upholders, &ldquo;and then,&rdquo; says Stow, &ldquo;by changing his copy, a Draper;&rdquo; this was probably at the time he was elected Mayor, when he would be required to become a member of <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="12">twelve</num> principal Companies of London: a practice which was <num value="1">first</num> discontinued by Alderman Wilkes, on his election in <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>. The original trade of Eyre was that of a Cordwainer, though he probably at length became a dealer in leather; for it is related that his <num value="1">first</num> step towards the attainment of his property, was receiving into his house as a lodger a Flemish Trader, who had arrived in the Thames with a freight of tanned leather, at the time there was a great demand for it, and only a short supply of it in England. When he learned what &ldquo;his guest had to dispose of, he made so successful a bargain for the whole freight, well knowing where to vend it, as laid the foundation of the fortune he left behind him.&rdquo;&mdash;Another version of the same story, printed in the <hi rend=italics>Universab Magazine</hi> for <datestruct value="1782--"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct>, Vol. lxxi. page <num value="348">348</num>, states that a vessel from Tripoli laden with leather having been wrecked on the coast of Cornwall, Eyre procured as much money as he could raise from his friends, and then travelled on foot to Penzance, where he bought the remainder of the freight, which he disposed of to considerable advantage. He is also said to have been the <num value="1">first</num> who introduced the use of morocco leather into England.&mdash;Sir Simon Eyre likewise gave to the City the Cardinal's Hat Tavern, in Lombard Street, with a tenement on the eastern side, and a mansion behind; together with an alley leading from Lombard Street to Cornhill, with the appurtenances, all which were newly built; towards a Brotherhood of Our Lady in the Church of St. Mary Woolnoth. He left issue a son Thomas, who was also succeeded by a son bearing the same name.</NOTE>&mdash;His will is filled with charitable bequests; ordering, says Stow, who gives an abstract of it from his own perusal, &ldquo;somewhat to be distributed to all prisons in London, or within a mile of that City, to relieve them. Moreover he gave <measure value="2000bmark" type=currency><num value="2000">2000</num> marks</measure> (<datestruct value="1333--"><year reg="1333">1333</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>) upon a condition, which, not performed were then to be distributed to maids' marriages, and other deeds of charity. He also gave <measure value="3000bmark" type=currency><num value="3000">3000</num> marks</measure>, (<datestruct value="1999--"><year reg="1999">1999</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>) to the Company of Drapers, upon condition that they should, within <num value="1">one</num> year after his decease, establish perpetually a master, or warden, <num value="5">five</num> secular priests, <num value="6">six</num> clerks, and <num value="2">two</num> choristers, to sing daily divine service <hi rend=italics>by note</hi>, for ever in his Chapel of the Leadenhall: also <num value="3">three</num> schoolmasters, with an usher; to wit; <num value="1">one</num> master with an usher for grammar, <num value="1">one</num> master for writing, and the <num value="3">third</num> for singing; with housing there newly built for them for ever: the master to have a salary of <num value="10">10</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> and every other priest <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>; every other clerk <num value="5">5</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>, and every other chorister <measure value="5bmark" type=currency><num value="5">5</num> marks</measure> (<num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>):&mdash;And if the Drapers refuse, this to do within <hi rend=italics><num value="1">one</num> year</hi> after his decease, then the <measure value="3000bmark" type=currency><num value="3000">3000</num> marks</measure> to remain to the Prior and Convent of Christ's Church in London, with the condition to establish as aforesaid, within

<P>The Chapel in Leadenhall, however, was not left wholly neglected, since in <datestruct value="1466--"><year reg="1466">1466</year></datestruct>-<num value="67">67</num>, the <num value="6">6th</num> of Edward IV., a Fraternity of the Holy Trinity, consisting of <num value="60">sixty</num> priests, with other brethren and sisters, was founded under the King's licence, in the same building, by William Rouse, John Risby, and Thomas Ashby, Priests. Some of these ecclesiastics performed divine service <hi rend=italics>every market-day in the afternoon</hi>, to any persons who were willing to attend; and once in the year the whole convent assembled and had solemn service, with procession of all the brethren and sisters. This foundation, therefore, was in the year <datestruct value="1512"><year reg="1512">1512</year></datestruct> with great propriety confirmed to the <num value="60">sixty</num> Trinity Priests and their successors, at the will of the Mayor and Commonalty, by an act of the Common-Council. In the volume of official returns of the chantries attached to the Parish-Church of St. Peter upon Cornhill, drawn up in the reign of Edward VI., it is stated that the lands and tenements belonging to the Brother-hood at Leadenhall, given for the maintenance of obits and the relief of the poor, amounted to <num value="7">7</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="10">10</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> yearly. 
<P>In the preceding notice of the services performed at Leadenhall Chapel, it has been seen that the establishment of a MARKET on this spot, is but little less ancient than that of the granary and religious fraternity; though it was originally more celebrated for wool, cloth, and iron, than for provisions. The <hi rend=italics><num value="2">second</num></hi> Charter granted to London by Edward IV., <datestruct VALUE="1463-08-27"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=27>27th</day>, <year reg=1463>1463</year></datestruct>, gave <hi rend=italics>Tronage</hi>,<NOTE N="b"><P>The word <hi rend=italics>Tronage</hi> signifies the customary toll or duty for weighing of wool, &amp;c., as <hi rend=italics>Trona</hi> means the beam at which it is weighed, and <hi rend=italics>Tronator</hi> the officer who attends it. The <num value="2">second</num> of these terms is used in the <num value="2">2nd</num> Stat. Westminster, <datestruct value="1285--"><year reg="1285">1285</year></datestruct>, chap. <num value="25">25</num>, for a scale beam, and that of Tronage has existed from the time of Edward II. The original word is supposed to be the Icelandic <hi rend=italics>Triona</hi>, a beak, crane, or scale-beam, whence the Scottish term <hi rend=italics>Tron</hi> is also derived.</NOTE> or weighing of wares, and especially of all wool, to the City, to be holden at Leadenhall, and no where else within <num value="3">three</num> miles; soon after which the Corporation made suit to the King for additional letters patent to establish their right over this tronage of wool in the staple held at Westminster. Order was therefore to be taken, says Stow, &ldquo;by discretion of Thomas Cooke, then Mayor, the Counsel of London, Sir Geoffrey Fielding, then Mayor of the Staple at Westminster, and of the King's Council,&mdash;what should be paid to the Mayor and Alderman of the City, for the laying and housing of the wools there, that so they might be brought forth and weighed.&rdquo; A patent to this effect appears upon the Rolls entitled &ldquo;The King's grants to the Mayor and Citizens of London, that the Tronage, or Ponderage, of Wools, which was at Wesminster, shall be for the future at the Leadenhall at London.&rdquo;

<P>So early as the year <datestruct value="1484"><year reg="1484">1484</year></datestruct>, Leadenhall appears to have been employed as a sort of general storehouse, rather than as a granary; for which purpose it was at length wholly disused. From some unknown casuality a great fire happened there, when much housing was destroyed, together with all the stocks for guns and other provisions belonging to the City; amounting to a very considerable loss, and no less charge in the repair. In the <num value="4">Fourth</num> of the annexed Views, that of the Old Skin Market, in which the ancient granary is seen above and at the back <pb id="p.52" n="52"> of the covered sheds,&mdash;it may be observed how much that building must have been damaged, by the patched eparation of the wall with brick and different sorts of stone. The upper windows, also, instead of having been restored uniformly with those beneath, with cinquefoil stone arches, consist only of the most common transom casements. 
<P>A curious document is extant of the year <datestruct value="1503"><year reg="1503">1503</year></datestruct>, the <num value="18">18th</num> of Henry VII., consisting of a request from the Commons of the City concerning the usages of Leadenhall, which shews that the market had then declined, and was very imperfectly regulated; and that the building itself was of but little value to the Corporation. The following is copy of this record: 
<P>&ldquo;Please it the Lord Maior, Aldermen, and Common Council, to enact, that all Frenchmen bringing Canvas, Linen Cloth, and other wares, to be sold; and all Foreigns bringing Wolsteds, Saies, Stamins, Kiverings, Nails, Iron-work, or any other wares; and also all manner Foreigns bringing Lead to the City to be sold;&mdash;shall bring all such their wares aforesaid to the open Market of the Leadenhall, there, and no where else, to be shewed, sold, and uttered, like as of old time it hath been used; upon pain of Forfeiture of all the said wares, shewed or sold in any other place than aforesaid: The shew of the said wares to be made <num value="3">three</num> days in a week, that is to say, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. It is also thought reasonable that the Common Beam be kept from henceforth in the Leadenhall; and the Farmer to pay therefore reasonable rent to the Chamber: for better it is that the Chamber have advantage thereby than a foreign person; and also the said Leadenhall, which is more chargeable now by half than profitable, shall better bear out the charges thereof. Also the Common Beam for Wool at Leadenhall may pay a yearly rent to the Chamber of London towards the supportation and charges of the same place: for reason it is, that a common office, occupied upon a common ground, bear a charge to the use of the commonalty. Also that Foreigns bringing wools, or any other merchandise or wares to Leadenhall, to be kept there for the sale and market, may pay more largely for keeping of their goods than Freemen.&rdquo; 
<P>But though the granary of Leadenhall had been perverted from the founder's original design, it appears to have been more than once examined and restored. In <datestruct value="1512--"><year reg="1512">1512</year></datestruct>, the <num value="3">3rd</num> year of Henry VIII., when Roger Achily entered the Mayoralty, there were not found, says Stow, &ldquo;<num value="100">one hundred</num> quarters of wheat in all the garners of the City; either within the liberties, or near adjoining: through the which scarcity, when the carts of Strafford came laden with bread to the City, as they had been accustomed, there was such press about them that <num value="1">one</num> man was ready to destroy another in striving to be served for their money. But this scarcity lasted not long; for the Maior, in short time, made such provisions of wheat, that the bakers, both of London and of Stratford, were weary of taking it up, and were forced to take back more than they wished: and for the rest the Maior laid out the money, and stowed it up in Leadenhall, and other garners of the City. This Maior also kept the City so well, that he would be at the Leadenhall by <num value="4">four</num> a clock in the summer mornings; and from thence he went to other markets to the great comfort of the citizens.&rdquo; 
<P>In the <num value="10">10th</num> year of Henry VIII., <datestruct VALUE="1519-09-28"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=28>28th</day>, <year reg=1519>1519</year></datestruct>, the Commons of London presented the following very curious memorial, &ldquo;To the Right Honourable the Mayor, and his Worshipful Brethren the Aldermen, and the discreet Commissioners in this Common Council assembled,&rdquo;&mdash;concerning a variety of purposes for which Leadenhall might properly be used; and which the Corporation appears to have allowed. 
<P>&ldquo;Meekly beseeching, Sheweth unto your good Lordship and Masterships: Divers and many Citizens of the City, who with your favours, under correction, think that the great place called the Leadenhall, should, nor ought, not to be let to farm to any person or persons,<NOTE N="a"><P><datestruct VALUE="1750-07-2"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=2>2nd</day>, <year reg=1750>1750</year></datestruct>, Leadenhall Market was let to farm to Mr. Papworth, a Grocer of Coleman Street, for <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> per Annum, and <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> fine.</NOTE> and especially to any fellowship or company incorporate; to have and to hold the same Hall for a term of years, for such inconveniences as thereby may ensue and come, to the hurt of the common-weal of the said City in time to come; as somewhat more largely may appear in the articles hereafter following. 
<hi rend=italics><num value="1">First</num>.</hi> If any assembly or hasty gathering of the Commons of the said City, for oppressing or subduing misruled people within the said City, hereafter shall happen to be called or commanded by the Mayor, Aldermen, and other Governors, of the said City for the time being; there is none so convenient and meet a place to assemble them in the said City, as the said Leadenhall, both for largeness of room and for their sure defence in time of their counselling together about the premises.<NOTE N="b"><P>This passage had probably a reference to the tumult in London on the famous evil May-day, <datestruct value="1517--"><year reg="1517">1517</year></datestruct>, when the insurgents attacked the house of a foreigner named Mewtas, at the Green Gate, on the east of Leadenhall, in Lime Street. In the subsequent executions, <datestruct VALUE="-05-5"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=5>5th</day></datestruct>, <num value="1">one</num> of the moveable gibbets was set up at Leadenhall.</NOTE> Also in that place have been used the artillery, guns, and other common armours, of the said City, to be safely kept in readiness for the safeguard, wealth and defence, of the said City to be had and occupied at times when need required; as also the store of timber for necessary reparations of the tenements belonging to the Chamber of the said City, there commonly hath been kept.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Item:</hi> if any Triumph or Noblesse were to be done or shewed by the Commonalty of the said City, for the honour of our Sovereign Lord the King and the realm, and for the worship of the said City; the said Leadenhall is the most meet and convenient place to prepare and order the said Triumph therein, and from thence to issue forth to the places therefore appointed.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Item:</hi> if any Largesse or dole of any money made unto poor people of this City, by or after the death of any worshipful person within the said City, it hath been used to be done and given in the said Leadenhall; for that the said place is most meet therefore.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Item:</hi> the honourable Father that was maker of the said Hall, had a special will, intent, and mind, as it is commonly said, that the market men and women that came to the City with victuals and other things, should have their free standing within the said Leadenhall in wet weather, to keep themselves and their wares dry; and thereby to encourage them, and all others, to have the better will and desire, the more plenteously to resort to the said City to victual the same. And if the said Hall should be let to farm, the will of the honourable Father should never be fulfilled nor take effect.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Item:</hi> If the said place, which is the chief fortress, and most necessary place within all the City, for the tuition and safeguard of the same, should be let to farm out of the hands of the chief heads of the said City, and especially to any other body politic, it might at length, by likelihood, be occasion of discord and debate between the said bodies politic. Which God defend. For these, and many other great and reasonable causes, which hereafter shall be shewed to this honourable court, your said beseechers think it much necessary that the said Hall be still in the hauds of this City, and to be surely kept by sad and discreet officers; in such wise that it may always be ready to be used and occupied for the common-weal of the said City, when need shall require; and in no wise be let to any body politic.&rdquo; 
<P>In the year <datestruct value="1528"><year reg="1528">1528</year></datestruct>, continues Stow, &ldquo;the <num value="20">20th</num> of Henry VIII., surveyors were appointed to view the garners of the City; namely those at the Bridge-house, and Leadenhall, how they were stored of grain for the service of the City. And here it should be noticed that, of old time, the bakers of bread at Stratford near Bow<NOTE N="c"><P>The custom of bringing bread from Stratford to London appears to have been of considerable antiquity. In <datestruct value="1310--"><year reg="1310">1310</year></datestruct>-<num value="11">11</num>, the <num value="4">4th</num> year of Edward II., in the Mayoralty of Richard Reffeham, a baker named John of Stratford was drawn on a hurdle through the streets of the city with a fool's hood on his head, and loaves of light bread suspended round his neck, for making his bread less than the Assize directed. The ancient poem of <hi rend=italics>Pierce Plowman's Vision</hi> also refers to the supply of London from Essex in a famine in the <num value="44">44th</num> year of Edward III., under the Maroyalty of John Chichester.

<P>So late as <datestruct value="1528"><year reg="1528">1528</year></datestruct>-<num value="29">29</num>, the <num value="20">20th</num> year of Henry VIII., Sir James Spencer being Lord Mayor, <num value="6">six</num> bakers of Stratford were amerced in the Guildhall of London for making loaves under the Assize; but Stow records that those bakers discontinued serving the City about <num value="30">thirty</num> years previous to the publication of the <num value="1">first</num> edition of his <hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, which would bring the time to <datestruct value="1568--"><year reg="1568">1568</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> were allowed <pb id="p.53" n="53"> to bring daily, excepting on the Sabbath and principal feasts, divers long carts laden with bread; the same being <num value="2">two</num> ounces in the penny wheat loaf heavier than the penny wheat loaf baked in the City: the same to be sold in Cheap (Cheapside;) <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> carts standing there, between Gutheran's (now Gutter) Lane, and Fauster's (Foster) Lane end; <num value="1">one</num> cart in Cornhill, by the Conduit, and <num value="1">one</num> other in Grass (Grace) Church Street.&rdquo; 
<P>The sale of provisious within the immediate precincts of Leadenhall, appears to have commenced in <datestruct value="1522--"><year reg="1522">1522</year></datestruct>, when the <hi rend=italics>Rippiers</hi> of Rye in Sussex sold fresh fish there.<NOTE N="a"><P><hi rend=italics>Rippiers</hi>
are persons who bring fish from the sea-coast to the interior of the country. The original word is <hi rend=italics>Riparii</hi>, and is derived from <hi rend=italics>Ripa</hi>, a river, or river-banks.</NOTE> At this time the name seems also to have belonged to a market held at the eastern end of Cornhill, opposite the ancient granary; but the <hi rend=italics>foreign</hi> butchers, or those who were not Freemen of the City, had standings without the verge, in the High Street of Lime Street Ward,&mdash;on the north side of the present Leadenhall Street,&mdash;opposite the citizens' houses, where they sold meat every Wednesday and Saturday; the inhabitants deriving considerable benefit by the ground which they occupied. When this was observed by the Corporation, an ordinance was passed in <datestruct value="1533--"><year reg="1533">1533</year></datestruct>, that the butchers also should be obliged to attend in Leadenhall Market, where stalls and blocks were erected for their accommodation; their standings being paid for to the Chamber of London. At the same time the Lord Mayor and Aldermen having ascertained the reasonable prices of beef and pork to be <num value="0.50">1/2</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> per lb., and veal and mutton <num value="0.75">3/4</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> per lb. in pursuance of an Act of Parliament for their regulation,&mdash;it was found thats uch regulation rather increased, than reduced, the price, and the Act was therefore soon after repealed.<NOTE N="b"><P>The Act referred to was that passed <num value="25">25th</num> Henry VIII., <datestruct value="1532--"><year reg="1532">1532</year></datestruct>, chap. iii. fixing the prices as above stated, and ordering the &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Haver-du-pois</hi>&rdquo; weight to be used by all butchers: which weight was enforced by another Act, <num value="26">26th</num> Henry VIII. <datestruct value="1533--"><year reg="1533">1533</year></datestruct>, chap. i. In his <num value="27">27th</num> year, <datestruct value="1535"><year reg="1535">1535</year></datestruct>, chap. xix. these Acts were suspended for <num value="2">two</num> years; and in his <num value="33">33rd</num> year, <datestruct value="1541"><year reg="1541">1541</year></datestruct>, chap. xi. they were repealed on the petition of the Masters, Wardens, and Fellowship, of the Butchers of London. Previous to the establishment of the above prices, a fat ox was sold in London for <num value="26">26</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> at the most; a fat wether or calf, for <num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>; a fat lamb for <num value="12">12</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> ; fat mutton, for <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> the quarter; a <num value="100">hundred</num> weight of beef, for <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> at the dearest time, and pieces of beef weighing from <num value="2.50">2 1/2</num>lbs. to <num value="3">3</num>lbs. and upwards, l<hi rend=italics>d.</hi> each, or <num value="13">thirteen</num> or <num value="14">fourteen</num> such pieces for <num value="12">12</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>; at every butcher's stall in the City. After the price was fixed, however, the graziers gained, and the butchers lost: since the former knew, or were supposed to know, the weight of their cattle, and made the whole charge amount to the standard, which at length procured the above-mentioned petition and repeal. About the time now referred to, the number of butchers in London and the suburbs, did not exceed <num value="80">80</num>, each of whom killed <num value="9">9</num> oxen weekly; but when Anthony Munday, continued Stow's <hi rend=italics>Survey</hi> in <datestruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>, the butchers were estimated at <num value="120">120</num>, each killing <num value="6">six</num> oxen per week.</NOTE>

<P>It was probably the advancing success of Leadenhall as a general mart, which occasioned such considerable exertions to be made in <datestruct value="1534--"><year reg="1534">1534</year></datestruct>, to have the proposed national <hi rend=italics>Bourse</hi>, or Exchange, for Merchants, to be established on the same spot. At this time their meeting-place was in the open air in Lombard Street, which was exposed to many inconveniencies; and though various plans had been proposed for their removal, the <num value="1">first</num> effectual attempt was made in <datestruct value="1531--"><year reg="1531">1531</year></datestruct>, by Sir Richard Gresham, Knight, the King's Merchant, then Sheriff of London. His exertions however, were not successful, although he sufficiently interested Henry VIII. to induce him to send letters to the City <num value="3">three</num> years afterwards, directing the building of a Bourse at Leadenhall. Many Common Councils were therefore called for the purpose; but in <datestruct value="1535--"><year reg="1535">1535</year></datestruct>, during the Mayoralty of John Champneys, &ldquo;it was fully concluded that the Bourse should remain in Lombard Street as afore, and Leadenhall be no more spoken of concerning this matter.&rdquo; 
<P>During the time that the body of Henry VIII. lay in state in his Chapel at Westminster, for about <num value="12">twelve</num> days, to <datestruct VALUE="1547-02-13"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=13>13th</day>, <year reg=1547>1547</year></datestruct>, Leadenhall was <num value="1">one</num> of the places where his funeral dole was distributed to the poor of the City, by the hands of his Almoner, Nicholas Heath, Bishop of Worcester, and others, his ministers and assistants. It consisted, says Stow, who probably witnessed it, of &ldquo;great plenty of money, and was given both in open doles, and by way of proclamation.&rdquo;<NOTE N="c"><P>The alms ordered by the King's Will, were <measure value="1000bmark" type=currency><datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct> marks</measure>, (<num value="666">666</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="13">13</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>) to be given &ldquo;to the most poore and nedy people that may be found; common beggars as moch as may be avoyded:&mdash;part in the same place, and thereaboutes, where it shall pleas Almighty God to call us to his mercy; part by the way; and part in the same place of our buriall.&rdquo;&mdash;Rymer's <hi rend=italics>F&aelig;dera</hi>, <num value="2">2nd</num> Edition, Vol. xv. page <num value="111">111</num>. As Henry died at Westminster, the poor of London were included in his funeral dole, in conformity with the <num value="2">second</num> provision mentioned in his testament.</NOTE>

<P>About this time was the period of the youth of Stow, when he relates that the use to which Leadenhall was then applied was as follows: &ldquo;In a part of the north quadrant, on the east side of the north gate, were the common beams for weighing of wool and other wares; as had been accustomed: on the west side of the market were the scales to weigh meal. The other <num value="3">three</num> sides were reserved, for the most part, to the making and resting of the pageants shewed at Midsummer in the watch. The remnant of the sides and quadrants were employed for the stowage of woolsacks, but not closed up: the lofts above were used partly by the painters in working for the decking of pageants and other devices, for beautifying of the watch and watchmen. The residue of the lofts were letten out to merchants, and the wool-winders and packers, therein to wind and pack their wools.&rdquo; 
<P>The ancient use of Leadenhall as a storehouse for arms, appears to have been continued or resumed during the Civil Wars; probably being made such when the City was fortified, in <datestruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct>-<num value="43">43</num>. In the tumult which began in Moorfields on Sunday, <datestruct VALUE="1648-04-10"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=10>10th</day>, <year reg=1648>1648</year></datestruct>, a party of the insurgents attacked the Lord Mayor's house, forced the guard, and brought thence a piece of ordnance, with which they captured the magazine at Leadenhall. All that day they were gathering forces through the City by beat of drum, and shouts for God and King Charles; but early the next morning General Fairfax entered without opposition at Aldersgate, charged the main body at Leadenhall, received the fire of their cannon, and finally dispersed them. 
<P>The following curious account of the subsequent use of this place as a market <hi rend=italics>before</hi> the Fire of London, is taken from <num value="1">one</num> of the Harleian MSS., apparently the recollections of a foreigner then living in England, and written about the beginning of the eighteenth century; with the intention of shewing the variety and abundance of its supplies, as well as its importance long previous.<NOTE N="d"><P>Harleian MSS. No. <num value="5900">5900</num>, described in the Catalogue as &ldquo;a book in folio, being a catalogue of books relating to the City of London, with many other illustrations of its history and antiquities.&rdquo; The article above cited will be found near the close of the volume, entitled &ldquo;Seuerall thinges omitted relating to y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> elustration of y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> famous Citey of London:&mdash;as of ther Marketts and fayres.&rdquo;</NOTE>&mdash;&ldquo;Then in Leaden-Hall you may see y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> quantety of wooll, which is ther vented euery weeke, brought in after it hath been sorted by y<hi rend=sup>e</hi>

<P>Such appears to have been the state in which Leadenhall continued until the Great Fire of London in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, which, in this part of the City, terminated near the present spot; the contemporary surveys of the destruction representing the line of its ravages on the south and west sides of the principal building, the size and solidity of which were considered to have arrested the progress of the flames. Even of this edifice, however, little more than the stone work was left standing, all the houses around it, and in the yards belonging to it, being entirely destroyed: though it appears that the space within was soon and easily cleared, since about <datestruct VALUE="-09-7"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=7>7th</day></datestruct> a proclamation was issued for markets to be held at Leadenhall, the Tower, Mile-end Green, &amp;c. An apartment within the building, designated &ldquo;the great room,&rdquo; perhaps the ancient Chapel, was also taken by the Parish of St. Peter upon Cornhill, to be fitted up for public worship, whilst that Church lay in ruins after the same fire, at the rent of <num value="26">26</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> per annum.<NOTE N="b"><P>MS. extracts from the Vestry-books of St. Peter's Cornhill, by the late Mr. Robert Wilkinson, now in the City Library at Guildhall.&mdash;This entry is dated <datestruct VALUE="1669-11-4"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=4>4th</day>, <year reg=1669>1669</year></datestruct>.

<P>In subsequently restoring Leadenhall as a market-place, the quantity of ground employed for that purpose was considerably increased, there being then added to it all the courts and yards belonging to the building, with some other adjoining portions bought by the City: so that the country butchers, &amp;c. were now actually included within its limits, and no longer left standing in the highway between the corners of Gracechurch Street, and Lime Street, to the great inconvenience of passengers. At the time that markets were so held, there belonged to them certain officers whose duty it was to clean the streets where they stood, remove the soil left behind, and furnish those who attended them with boards and other accommodations. These officers were called Sergeant- Yeoman, Yeoman of the Channel, Yeoman of Newgate Market, Foreign-taker, &amp;c., and they received certain allowances from the dealers for their labours; but when the City Markets were let to farm after the Great Fire, the farmers themselves made all provisions and received all dues, and the officers retained only their names.<NOTE N="c"><P>Strype's Stow's <hi rend=italics>Survey of London.</hi> Vol. II. book v. chap. <num value="29">29</num>. page <num value="398">398</num>.</NOTE>

By this table &ldquo;every stall or standing of <num value="8">8</num> feet long and <num value="4">4</num> feet broad, for the sale of flesh-meat or fish, under the public shelter of Leadenhall, was not to exceed <num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>

John Strype, in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, when he published his excellent edition of Stow's 
<hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>,&mdash;&ldquo;if I should say of Europe, I should not give it too great a praise.&rdquo;&mdash;The whole extent of ground which it then occupied, consisted of <num value="3">three</num> spacious squares, all enclosed with buildings; having a principal entrance in Leadenhall Street, under the broad-arched gateway of the old building, and a <num value="2">second</num> through Queen's College Passage, more to the east.

<P>At this time the front of the ancient edifice itself stood at the south-west end of Leadenhall Street, and <num value="1">one</num> side stretched down behind the houses on the north-east of Gracechurch Street. The north front presented a large stone building of <num value="2">two</num> stories, separated by buttresses into <num value="9">nine</num> divisions, each containing <num value="2">two</num> small

<pb id="p.55" n="55"> square windows, <num value="1">one</num> over the other, the lower divided by a mullion with <num value="2">two</num> cinquefoil arches. At each of the corners of the hall, was an octangular turret containing the staircases, lighted by small arched windows, and covered with a pinnacle, which rose above the flat leaded battlements and opened upon them; and over the centre of the front roof was suspended a bell beneath a wooden canopy, of a shape similar to those at the corners, though somewhat larger. The basement story at <num value="1">one</num> period exhibited a line of broad arched windows, with an arched doorway at each end, and a gateway of the same form in the centre, with a narrow foot passage on the western side.<NOTE N="a"><P>A small etching of this part of the Hall, taken in <datestruct value="1782--"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct>, will be found in Carter's <hi rend=italics>Views of Ancient Buildings in England.</hi> Lond. <datestruct value="1785--"><year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct>-<num value="93">93</num>, <num value="24">24</num>to. Vol. v. plate xcviii.</NOTE> This part, however, was subsequently concealed, like the interior cloisters, with several small shops and sheds; the tiled roofs of which reached almost to the bases of the lower windows. The apartments of this building were long, narrow, and dark, having very low ceilings, with the windows close to them, and were occupied for a variety of purposes: as the western side for the reception of goods bolonging to the East India Company, the eastern as the Colchester Baize Hall, and the north end as a warehouse for the sealing of leather. This part of Leadenhall was taken down about <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>, and a line of shops and houses erected on the site. 
<P>The <num value="1">first</num> of the interior squares was immediately behind the north-east corner of Gracechurch Street; and from its peculiar appropriation, was at <num value="1">one</num> period called the &ldquo;Beef Market.&rdquo; This was properly <hi rend=italics>Leadenhall Market</hi>, as it lay between the <num value="2">two</num> sides of the Hall itself, and was entered from the ancient gateway in Leadenhall Street. It comprised a space of <num value="160">160</num> feet in length from north to south, by <num value="80">80</num> feet in breadth from east to west, containing about an <num value="100">hundred</num> stalls for butchers; many of them measuring <num value="8">8</num>, <num value="10">10</num>, or <num value="12">12</num>, feet, by <num value="4">4</num>, <num value="5">5</num>, or <num value="6">6</num>; fitted up with racks, hooks, blocks, and all other conveniences, and sheltered by roofs or the warehouses above. In the same court on Tuesday was held the Leather Market, which was also greatly resorted to by tanners; on Thursday the Colchester waggons came to it with baize, and fellmongers with wool; on Friday it was used for the sale of raw hides, or occasionally of tanned leather to curriers, and on Saturday for selling of beef and other provisions. The site of this court is still occupied by part of the Skin and Leather Market; and of <num value="3">three</num> sides a square of warehouses. The rest of Leadenhall was taken down in <datestruct VALUE="1812-06--"><month reg="06">June</month> <year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>; considerable improvements were made there in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>; and in <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct> the whole of the Leather Market was rebuilt. 
<P>The <num value="2">second</num> court mentioned by Strype was situated to the east and south-east of the former, and called &ldquo;the Green Yard Market;&rdquo; because it was anciently a green plat of ground. It then became the City's storehouse for building materials; and the southern part was at length converted into &ldquo;the Flesh Market,&rdquo; for veal, mutton, lamb, &amp;c. The court in which it was held contained <num value="170">170</num> feet in length from east to west, and <num value="90">90</num> feet in breadth from north to south; and it included <num value="140">140</num> standings for butchers, roofed over, and of the same size as those in the Beef Market. In the middle of this court, in Strype's time, was a row of shops for fishmongers, with kitchens or rooms over them, extending from north to south; and at the south-west side stood a fair market-house raised upon columns, having vaults beneath, and rooms above, surmounted by a clock and bell-tower. The tenements about the court were then inhabited chiefly by cooks, victuallers, &amp;c. and the streets leading into it by other dealers in provisions. This part of Leadenhall Market was rebuilt in <datestruct value="1730--"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>, with a new opening into Lime Street; when the old Green Market was left vacant, and the stalls for meat and fish removed more to the south. The site of all these is now occupied by the Wholesale Butcher Market. 
<P>The <num value="3">third</num> court of Leadenhall was formerly called &ldquo;the Herb Market,&rdquo; because, adds Strype, only &ldquo;herbs, roots, fruits, &amp;c. are there sold.&rdquo; It was then about <num value="140">140</num> feet square, the west, east, and northern, sides having covered walks, with columns, enclosing <num value="28">28</num> standings for gardeners, with cellars beneath; and another range of covered stalls for the sellers of tripe, &amp;c. The south side was occupied by victuallers, butchers, poulterers, &amp;c. The whole of this capacious square is now covered with a high slated roof with skylights, and filled with counters, and forms the Poultry Market. 
<P>The whole of Leadenhall Market, with the exception of the part last mentioned, is situate in the Parish of St. Peter upon Cornhill, the ancient boundary being fixed at a passage into Lime Street, formerly called &ldquo;the Green Yard.&rdquo;<NOTE N="b"><P><hi rend=italics>The Parish Clerks' Survey of London</hi>, <datestruct value="1732--"><year reg="1732">1732</year></datestruct>, <num value="12">12</num>mo. page <num value="127">127</num>.</NOTE> Under the year <datestruct value="1656"><year reg="1656">1656</year></datestruct>, the vestry-books contain an entry that &ldquo;<datestruct VALUE="-09-24"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=24>24th</day></datestruct> beinge Wednesday, the Churchwarden, <num value="5">five</num> parishioners, and Mr. Jarman, the Citie Carpenter, Clement Bacon, Clerk, and Walter Yonge, Sexton, all went into the Green Yard in Leaden Hall, to view the bounds of the Parish of St. Peter upon Cornhill. At which they found an ancient peece of brass, whereon was engraved the date of the yeere <datestruct value="1626--"><year reg="1626">1626</year></datestruct>, fastened on the side of the doore-post, at which door they enter into Lime Street through a little Alley. Mr. Bedford, the Clerk of St. Dionis Backchurch, beeinge present, saw the peece of brass nailed there.&rdquo; The boundary-plate is now fixed against the south wall of the offices belonging to the East India House, in the <num value="4">fourth</num> turning into Leadenhall out of Lime Street, which enters nearly opposite to the north-east corner of the Wholesale Butcher Market; with a similar mark for the Parish of St. Dionis Backchurch fixed beside it. At the eastern end of the same passage is a boundary plate for the Parish of St. Andrew Undershaft. Such are the principal features of the ancient and modern Market of Leadenhall. 
<P>The Engravings which are attached to these notices, exhibit the last remains and dilapidated state of the original Hall and Chapel at the time of their final removal. The <num value="1">first</num> is a North-East view of the Chapel, and North end of the Outside of the Hall, as seen from the entrance in Leadenhall Street; and through the arch on the right are seen part of the interior cloisters which surrounded the court containing the Leather Market. 
<P>The South-East view of the same Chapel, and South end of the Exterior of the Hall, shews their appearance <pb id="p.56" n="56"> from the old Green Market, subsequently called the Pea Market, and the present Skin Market; near where the Limehouse and Blackwall stages now stand. Above the Hall are seen the steeple and turret of the Churches of St. Peter and St. Michael, Cornhill. The passage on the right looks into a part of the Skin Market immediately behind Leadenhall street; and the gateway on the left into the quadrangle of the Leather Market. 
<P>In the <num value="3">Third</num> engraving is given a view of the Interior of Leadenhall Chapel looking East; when it was used as a warehouse for skins and tanned hides; a short time previous to its final demolition in <datestruct VALUE="1812-06--"><month reg="06">June</month> <year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>. This Chapel projected eastward from the exterior of the eastern cloisters of Leaden Hall, from which it was entered by a large arched doorway, having the arms of the founder over the centre;<NOTE N="a"><P>These arms are generally blazoned Gules, bazant&eacute;e, <num value="2">two</num> flanches sable, each charged with a lion rampant guardant, argent.</NOTE> and on each side of the interior arch was a perforated gothic screen, of exquisite workmanship. The building was oblong, and was divided on the exterior sides into <num value="4">four</num> parts, by buttresses reaching nearly to the roof, and separating as many large windows of the depressed pointed arch form, each parted into <num value="3">three</num> lights, by stone mullions with cinquefoil arches; the window at the eastern end being considerably larger than the others, and containing <num value="5">five</num> lights. On the outside the Chapel was almost completely enclosed by a case of wooden sheds, which reached nearly to the bases of the windows. It was covered with rafters and tiling of the coarsest modern workmanship, instead of the ancient roof, which had been pointed, and was supported within by carved brackets of chesnut wood, resting on corbels let into the walls against the buttresses: but of those brackets, only the scrolls and <num value="1">one</num> fragment remained when the building was destroyed. Within the Chapel, at the south-west corner, was a small oaken door curiously studded and pannelled, opening into a square apartment, which had probably been the sacristy; against the walls of which Mr. John Thomas Smith discovered some slight remains of painted figures.<NOTE N="b"><P><hi rend=italics>Topographical Antiquities of London.</hi> Lond. <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>, <num value="4">4</num>to. page <num value="18">18</num>, Plates <num value="8">8</num>, <num value="9">9</num>, where will be found <num value="2">two</num> very excellent and interesting engravings of Leadenhall, and the Interior of the Chapel looking West.</NOTE> <num value="1">One</num> of these exhibited the cheek, ear, and side of a head, with long yellow hair, flowing over blue and red drapery; the whole very much resembling the paintings discovered in St. Stephen's Chapel, Westminster, executed in the reign of Edward III. Those at Leadenhall, however, were neither embossed nor gilded; but were outlined and shaded with red ochre. 
<P>Plate IV. exhibits a view of the Skin Market, taken from the old quadrant or cloisters of Leadenhall, and looking Eastward through the arch in the centre. These cloisters consisted of a series of broad pointed arches separated by the buttresses of the building, which were <num value="9">nine</num> in number on the east and west, and <num value="6">six</num> on the south. Some of the arches were closed up with brick walls, others had doors or windows formed in them, and the mouldings of all were injured or destroyed; so that they exhibited an air of ruin, repaired in the coarsest and most imperfect manner. They were also still farther darkened and concealed by the tiled sheds and pillars which reached almost to the lower line of windows; the rusted iron bars and shattered casements of which added to the gloomy aspect of the Hall itself, and gave to it in its latter time the appearance of a prison. <pb id="p.57" n="57">

<P>In <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>, the workmen employed in digging for the foundation of the intended new houses on the north side of Cockspur Street, on opening the ground at the south-west corner of Hedge Lane, or Whitcomb Street, and near the west entrance of the King's Mews, they observed several rude and unshapen pieces of sculpture, which suggested the idea of parts of a Corinthian capital; also a large stone of a conical form (placed in the fore-ground of the annexed view) on whose top were remains of sculptured foliage, &amp;c. On further excavation, and clearing away the earth, were discovered the fragments of <num value="3">three</num> walls, evidently of great antiquity, and which no doubt were remains of some eminent building; though of such remote date as to forbid any positive decision of the time or purpose of its erection. The largest of these fragments, which measured about <num value="6">six</num> feet in thickness, lay east and west, and stood by itself; and opposite, on the west side, were the other <num value="2">two</num>, which lay north and south, the southern end of the <num value="1">first</num> touching the northwest end of the other, in a parallel direction; these did not exceed <num value="4">four</num> feet in thickness. The distance from the east end of the larger fragment to the outside of the other <num value="2">two</num> walls was about <num value="60">sixty</num> feet. The were in good preservation, particularly the northmost of the <num value="2">two</num>, which rose nearest to the surface of the ground, and so very compact, that it was with great difficulty they could be broken by driving into them large iron crows. The parts had evidently been connected by others, decayed and gone, and the ruins altogether made a venerable and interesting appearance, though we presume they had formed but a small part of the original structure. 
<P>The materials that composed these mural fragments were various, and well worthy of notice, consisting of ragstone, some chalk, a few bricks, and particularly of silicious substances, that had no doubt contributed much to their durability; the bricks in the composition prove them to be of very ancient date, as well as the circumstance that Hedge Lane ran immediately by the site of these ruins, and was about <num value="2">two</num> centuries ago a lane bounded by a hedge, that in all probability these ruins were buried, if not entirely unknown at that time. 
<P>Their discovery has given rise to numerous conjectures as to the original building: the most prevalent (and, perhaps, the best founded) of which is, that they were the remains of the Royal Mews burnt in <datestruct value="1534--"><year reg="1534">1534</year></datestruct>,<NOTE N="*"><P>For an account of which see Pennant's London, edition <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, page <num value="151">151</num>.</NOTE> in the reign of Henry the <num value="8">Eighth</num>, and became neglected and buried after the fire: this idea is supposed to account for their concealment so many years; but if even this were the case, they certainly had been connected with a still older building, of which, perhaps, we have not the smallest account. They are by some supposed the remains of a religious edifice, from the circumstance of human bones having been dug up among the ruins. Pennant mentions a hermitage dedicated to St. Catharine, which anciently stood near Charing Cross, as also a small church near the same spot; but the latter is said to have been west of the foundation, nor did the place of the former exactly agree with them. Some conjecture them to be remains af an obscure chapel, fallen into decay through neglect, want of money, or from some other cause, and of which no memorial has been preserved; while others think them to have been the base of the ancient Charing (originally called Cher&egrave; Reine, or dear Queen's) Cross, set up in honour of Eleanor, queen of Edward the <num value="1">First</num>,<NOTE N="*"><P>Queen Eleanor, on her journey to Scotland, died in Lincolnshire, whence her body was brought for interment in the Abbey; and every place where it rested was made to perpetuate her memory by the erection of a Cross, which distinguished marks of respect are well known to have been gained by her conjugal affection, so brilliantly displayed in a hazardous exposure of her own life to save that of the King, when they were in Palestine.</NOTE> as the last place where her corpse rested on its way to be interred in Westminster Abbey. All these are, however, mere suppositions; and it can only be added, that the reader, presented with these surmises, and a faithful representation of the ruins and their locality, is left to form his own opinion respecting them. <pb id="p.59" n="59">

<P>Down to even after the middle of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, the north bank of the Thames above the Temple, was lined with the mansions and gardens of the English nobility.<NOTE N="a"><P>The custom of erecting mansions by the river Thames appears to have commenced with the Bishops, and an established residence belonging to the See of Canterbury seems to have existed at Lambeth in the <num value="11">eleventh</num> century: for &ldquo;anciently,&rdquo; says Selden, &ldquo;the noblemen lay within the city for safety and security; but the Bishop's houses were by the water-side, because they were held sacred persons whom nobody would hurt.&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Table Talk</hi>, Article, &ldquo;Bishops before the Parliament.&rdquo; <num value="2">2</num>.&mdash;After the Great Charters of <datestruct value="1215--"><year reg="1215">1215</year></datestruct> had permanently fixed the Court of Common Pleas at Westminster, that city also became the most usual place for holding the Parliament; and therefore many of the Bishops especially, and afterwards others of the nobility, for the convenience of residence whilst in attendance on it, were induced to erect mansions along the edge of the river; which at length formed a continuous line of buildings connecting Westminster and Charing with the City of London.

The lower story was formed of a continuous projection, with small upright windows separated by panels; and the upper floor of separate bays, each containing <num value="3">three</num> broad transom-casements, divided by ornamental brackets, decorated with mouldings, between which were retiring intervals of the wall.

<P><num value="1">One</num> of the largest mansions and estates on the south side of the Strand, was that called York Place; which in the Plan of London executed by Radulphus Aggas about the year <datestruct value="1560"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>, is represented as extending from Durham Place, about the present Adelphi, to the western extremity of the garden of the modern Northumberland House.

<P>Notwithstanding the admitted extravagance of the Duke of Buckingham, Evelyn has preserved a contemporaneous report in his favour; since in noticing the wealth of Sir Robert Clayton, <datestruct VALUE="1679-11-18"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=18>18th</day>, <year reg=1679>1679</year></datestruct>, he observes &ldquo;some believed him guilty of hard dealing, especially with the Duke of Buckingham, much of whose estate he had swallow'd.&rdquo;</NOTE> About the middle of the western side of those erections stood the Market which is the subject of these pages and the annexed plate; but the <num value="1">first</num> notice in which any of the Hungerford Family is represented as residing in the vicinity of this spot, states the dwelling to have been as far from it as Durham Yard, or about the present Adelphi Terrace. &ldquo;A great fire,&rdquo; says Samuel Pepys in his <hi rend=italics>Diary</hi>, <datestruct VALUE="1669-04-26"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=26>26th</day>, <year reg=1669>1669</year></datestruct>, &ldquo;happened in Durham Yard last night, burning the house of <num value="1">one</num> Lady Hungerford, who was to come to town to it this night: and so the house is burned down, new furnished, by the carelessness of the girl sent to take off a candle from a bunch of candles, which she did by burning it off, and left the rest, as it is supposed, on fire.

<P>Sir Richard Colt Hoare, the historian of the Hungerfords, relates nothing of the time or manner in which they became possessed of their property in the Strand, perhaps because it was so inconsiderable in comparison with that which they owned in Wiltshire and other places; nor does he record the particular period at which it was alienated: his information upon these points being only the following.&mdash;&ldquo;Having traced the marriages and means by which they <hi rend=italics>obtained</hi> such extensive possessions, it becomes me to state by what unlucky means they were finally

Lord Arundel was then at Oxford, and had committed his fortress to his lady, Blanche, <num value="5">fifth</num> daughter of Edward Somerset, <num value="4">fourth</num> Earl of Worcester, with only <num value="25">twenty-five</num> soldiers; yet when summoned to surrender she refused at once, saying, she had a command from her lord to keep it, and that command she would obey. She held out the defence for <num value="9">nine</num> days, and then capitulated upon the most honourable terms. These terms the besiegers broke as usual, but were soon dislodged from the fortress by the resolution of Lord Arundel; who, on his return, ordered a mine to be sprung beneath it, and thus sacrificed that noble structure to his loyalty. At the present Wardour Castle are still preserved several cannon-balls, of <num value="7">seven</num> and <measure value="9l." type=currency><num value="9">nine</num> pounds</measure> each, which were discharged against it when the besiegers attempted to carry it by storm.<NOTE N="c"><P>A very interesting account of this seige will be found in that part of the <hi rend=italics>History of Modern Wiltshire</hi> including the <num value="100">Hundred</num> of Dunworth, by James Everard, Baron Arundell of Wardour, and Sir R.

(<datestruct value="1643--"><year reg="1643">1643</year></datestruct>) <num value="4">4</num>to.&mdash;In this tract it is stated that Sir Edward Baynton had proof of a correspondence between Hungerford and Lord Seymour; and that the former had used various means of drawing away the troops of Baynton, pretending an order from the Parliament, which he could not satisfactorily prove. Baynton then determined to seize him, and send him safely to the Parliament, but Hungerford fled to Cisseter; &ldquo;and there, I doe verily believe,&rdquo; says the writer of the letter, &ldquo;did bribe <num value="2">two</num> Scotch Lieutenant-Colonels to performe this exploit; for he fled out of Wilts about <num value="6">six</num> weekes agone, and carried his family and goods into Somersetshire, where he doth now reside, and onely comes skulking now and then into Wiltshire, to put tricks upon me.&rdquo;&mdash;The other tract is entitled <hi rend=italics>Sir Edward Hvngerford's Vindication for the Svrrendering of Malmsbury, in Wiltshire, to the King's forces, after it was taken by Sir William Waller: as it was sent in a letter from the said Sir Edward Hungerford to a worthy Member of the House of Commons; and now published for the satisfaction of all such as desire to be truly informed of the whole passages in the winning and loosing of Malmsbury, within lesse than a weehe's time in Aprill last.</hi> London: <datestruct VALUE="1643-05-6"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=6>6th</day>, <year reg=1643>1643</year></datestruct>, <num value="4">4</num>to. The defence of Sir Edward is, that upon the capture of Malmsbury he was ordered to take charge of it; but when he expected to receive it in a complete state of defence, he found it without ammunition or money, and with more prisoners than soldiers. He informed Waller, of this deficiency, and received supplies and reinforcements under Serjeant-Major Clifton, whom Hungerford &ldquo;perceiving to be an officer able and fit to secure the town,&rdquo; he ordered him to take command of it, and, leaving his own troops behind him, withdrew with his servants to Bath to raise farther supplies. It appears that Clifton never went to Malmsbury at all, that the troops there were weak and discontented, and that the town was consequently retaken without any opposition.

<P>Perhaps <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest notices of the declining fortune of Sir Edward Hungerford, is to be found in the 
<hi rend=italics>Journals of the House of Commons</hi>, Thursday, <datestruct VALUE="1664-12-1"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=1>1st</day>, <year reg=1664>1664</year></datestruct>, when a Bill was introduced to enable him, then a Member of the House, to sell lands in the County of Devon; doubtless a part, or the whole, of the possessions of his <num value="1">first</num> <num value="2">two</num> wives. The property of the main line of the Hungerfords, when it became vested in him, was also gradually dismembered and alienated; and it is stated in the same Journals, Monday, <datestruct VALUE="1677-03-26"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=26>26th</day>, <year reg=1677>1677</year></datestruct>, that <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="4">four</num> bills sent down from the Lords, was &ldquo;to enable Sir Edward Hungerford, a Member of this House, to make leases for years of Hungerford House, in the Strand, in the Parish of St. Martin in the Fields, in the County of Middlesex, and of certain other houses and tenements thereto adjoining.&rdquo; This bill received the Royal Assent on Tuesday, <datestruct VALUE="-04-10"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=10>10th</day></datestruct>, and his other and more extensive estates were at length assigned to trustees, by whom the ancient family possession of Farleigh Castle and Manor were in <datestruct value="1686--"><year reg="1686">1686</year></datestruct> sold to Henry Baynton, of Spye Park, Esq.; who also dying insolvent, the Castle was resold under a decree of Chancery to Joseph Houlston, Esq.<NOTE N="d"><P><hi rend=italics>History and Antiquities of the County of Somerset</hi>, by the Rev.

<P>It might be supposed from the title of the above bill, that when Sir Edward Hungerford leased out the family house in the Strand he had no other design than that which is expressed; but in the Harleian Manuscript already cited, it is stated that from the success of Lord Clare in the market which he had established in his new buildings in Clement's Inn Fields, &ldquo;they haue got seuirall charters for the erection of seuerall outhers, sence the yeare <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>: as those of St. James, by the Earle of St. Albon's; Blumesbury, by the Earle of Southamton; Broke Market, by the Lord Broke; Hungerford Market, and Nupport Market: beside the Hay Market, ney Charing-Cross, and that at Petty-France, at Westminster; with ther Majesties Fayre in y<hi rend=sup>e</hi> feldes behind Peckadelle.&rdquo; Whatever were the original design of Sir Edward, he procured Letters Patent dated at Westminster, <datestruct VALUE="1679-05-24"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=24>24th</day> <year reg=1679>1679</year></datestruct>, the <num value="31">31st</num> Charles II., giving to him and his heirs perpetually the privilege of holding and keeping an open Market every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, throughout the year, excepting for corn and grain, upon the estate described in the instrument as Hungerford House, alias Hungerford Inn, situate in or near the Strand, in the Parish of St. Martin in the Fields. This mansion appears to have been then taken down, and on the site of it, and the grounds belonging to it, the original Hungerford Market and Buildings were erected, bearing the name of the proprietor; including several adjoining courts and passages, and, for the period, a handsome street into the Strand.<NOTE N="e"><P>Stow's 
<hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, by Strype, Vol. II. book vi. chap. v. p. <num value="76">76</num>. Strype observes that the Hungerford mansion was a large but old house, with a garden. On the succeeding page he thus notices the residence to which Sir Edward removed when the former was destroyed:&mdash;Spring-Garden, a very large open place, with good built houses, well inhabited; some of which are large, with good gardens, as Sir Edward Hungerford's, where the Spanish Ambassador lately resided.&rdquo;</NOTE> Though the opening of such establishments be occasionally noticed in the very brief periodical papers of the time, there does not appear to be any record of the commencement of the present; but Hungerford Buildings are incidentally mentioned in the <hi rend=italics>London Gazette</hi>, from Monday, <datestruct VALUE="-11-8"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=8>8th</day></datestruct> to <num value="11">11th</num> <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>.

This instrument also gave the additional license and authority to all persons for ever thereafter to bring and expose to sale meal, flour, grain, and corn; and empowered the proprietors to take toll, &amp;c. according to the usage of other markets. Sir Stephen Fox was the ancestor of the present Earl of Ilchester and Lord Holland; and from him the property of Hungerford Market passed into the possession of the family of Wise, that of the late proprietor, soon after the grant of the <num value="2">second</num> charter. 
<P>From the time when it was <num value="1">first</num> opened, there have been numerous attempts made to establish the trade of this place, especially as a fish-market for the western part of London;<NOTE N="a"><P>The most celebrated scheme for supplying Westminster with fish at a reduced rate, was that introduced in <datestruct value="1761--"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>, patronized by the Society of Arts, wherein the fish were to be brought from the coast in light land-carriages. On Friday, <datestruct VALUE="-10-16"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=16>16th</day></datestruct>, a warehouse for the sale of such fish was opened in Covent Garden Market, and another had been previously set up in Oxford Market. In <datestruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct> an Act of Parliament was procured for the plan, but after about <num value="2">two</num> years trial it entirely failed, as it was stated for want of farther and proper encouragement; and on Monday, <datestruct VALUE="1765-05-13"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=13>13th</day>, <year reg=1765>1765</year></datestruct>, Mr. John Blake, the superintendant, resigned all future conduct of the concern. The original design was attributed to a Mr. John Tull.&mdash;See <hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi>, vols. xxx to xxxv.&mdash;On Monday, <datestruct VALUE="1750-01-15"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=15>15th</day>, <year reg=1750>1750</year></datestruct>, a new fish-market was opened near Cannon-row, Westminster, but this attempt failed from the obstruction which the old London Bridge offered to the passage of boats which were to supply it. So lately as <datestruct VALUE="1818-08-17"><month reg="08">Aug.</month> <day reg=17>17th</day>, <year reg=1818>1818</year></datestruct>, a notice appeared in the papers for erecting <num value="2">two</num> additional market-houses for fish for the West end of London, which were to be regularly supplied by steam vessels employed for the purpose.</NOTE> which, however, appear to have been chiefly and most effectually prevented by a statute of the <num value="10">tenth</num> and <num value="11">eleventh</num> years of William III. <datestruct value="1699--"><year reg="1699">1699</year></datestruct>, chapter xxiv. This enacted, that Billingsgate Market be every day, excepting Sunday, a free and open market for all sorts of fish, and that any person may buy or sell there: that all buying any fish there, may sell them again in any other market or place in London, or elsewhere, by retail; but that no person shall employ himself, or be employed, in buying at Billinsgate any quantity of fish, to be divided by lots or in shares between any fishmongers or others, to be afterwards sold by retail or otherwise: nor is any fishmonger to engross or buy any quantity of fish, but what shall be for his own sale or use, under the penalty of <num value="20">20</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> for each offence; <num value="1">one</num> half being given to the poor of the parish, and the other to the prosecutor. 
<P>It is probable that of the original appearance of Hungerford Market scarcely any idea can now be conceived, but its aspect in the latter days of its existence is represented in the annexed Engraving, the view in which was taken from the most favourable point in the whole place, namely, the north-west corner, looking towards the river.<NOTE N="b"><P>Another print of the Old Hungerford Market, also taken from the western side, but without the colonnade and nearer to the river, was originally published by the artist, Mr. Frederick Nash, in a series of <hi rend=italics><num value="12">Twelve</num> Views of the Antiquities of London</hi>, <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>-<datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, <num value="4">4</num>to. of which excellent etching an impression is given in the <hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi>, vol. cii. part ii. p. <num value="113">113</num>, with an historical and descriptive paper.

At the upper part of the north end of the building on the exterior, was a black marble tablet with an inscription, surmounted by an arched recess of stone, containing a bust of Sir Edward Hungerford, in Roman armour,<NOTE N="c"><P>A wood engraving of this bust, &amp;c. will be found on page <num value="114">114</num> of the Magazine last cited. In the drawing of the effigy, the artist appears not to have understood the ornamental termination of the left of the <hi rend=italics>humerales</hi>, or shoulder-pieces, of the Roman cuirass, wherein it is habited; in consequence of which he has delineated it like a large cross, and has partly led the author of the descriptive account into an error concerning it, since he states in a note, that &ldquo;the cross, or rather saltire, on his breast, which should have been represented within a shield, is the ancient badge of the Order of the Bath.&rdquo; The writer was most probably thinking of the badges of the Order of the Thistle and St. Patrick; for until the alteration of this Order by George IV., when Prince Regent, in <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>, there never was any kind of cross connected with the insignia of the Knights. In the <hi rend=italics>Relation of the Ceremonies</hi>, &amp;c. already cited, p. <num value="7">7</num>, the badge then used is thus described: &ldquo;Then his Majesty put the red ribband, with the Order hanging to it, over the Knight's head: which Order has <num value="3">three</num> crowns of gold enamelled with green (or rather blue) and encompassed with this motto: In uno tria juncta.&rdquo; This device is said to have been the arms of King Arthur, from whom the Order of the Bath was adopted.</NOTE> with flowing hair; the latter, perhaps, being a representation of that costly dress wig mentioned by Sir R.

This bust is considered to be the only known portrait of Sir Edward Hungerford which has been published,<NOTE N="d"><P>Mrs. Crewe was in possession of a portrait of this Sir Edward, as well as of several other family pictures. <hi rend=italics>Hungerfordiana</hi>, p. <num value="119">119</num>.</NOTE> and was perhaps the work of Gibbons: it is represented with the inscription at length beneath the annexed View, with the Armorial Ensigns of the Hungerford family.<NOTE N="e"><P>These Arms are Sable, <num value="2">two</num> bars Argent, in chief <num value="3">three</num> plates: Crest, out of a ducal coronet Argent, a garb Or between <num value="2">two</num> serrated sickles, Vert, the handles Gules.

Even this appearance was limited to the western side, as upon the eastern the original colonnade had been entirely taken down. At the time the present view was taken, the great centre building had been long deserted and falling into decay, and was then entirely closed; whilst the covered appartments adjoining to it on each side of the exterior, which were originally designed for butchers, poulterers, fishmongers, &amp;c. were converted into close sheds for stables, the reception of carts and carriages, lumber, or the large working utensils of various persons resident on the spot; excepting the north end which was occupied by an engine-house and a cow-keeper.

The principal of those advantages were the erection and re-establishment of a handsome, spacious, light, clean, well ventilated, and accessible, market, for the supply of the western end of London, correspondent with the many improvements which had already taken place there; and the formation of a wharf and jetty for steam-vessels,&mdash;which, it was presumed, might pass through the New London Bridge up the river,&mdash; commodiously situate near the taverns and colonnades of the edifice. It was also stated that the Market was designed for the purposes of general barter, but that its situation was particularly well-adapted for the sale of fish, and all provisions brought to London by water. The capital required for carrying the whole of this design into effect, including also the cost of the freehold property to be bought, was estimated at <num value="210000">210,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>, to be raised in shares of <num value="100">100</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> each,<NOTE N="b"><P>This estimate was announced at a meeting of the encouragers of this undertaking held at the Company's office <datestruct VALUE="1830-02-18"><month reg="02">Feb.</month> <day reg=18>18th</day>, <year reg=1830>1830</year></datestruct>, William Courtenay, Esq. in the Chair, who stated to the meeting that the Committee appointed in the preceding spring had succeeded in obtaining the option of buying the freehold of the Hungerford Estate, with all its market-privileges, of Mr. Wise the proprietor for the sum of <num value="110000">110,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>, and that <num value="100000">100,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>, more would be required for re-erecting the market and houses.

To form a space sufficient for the erection of the design concluded on, the site of the old market was brought together with those of the surrounding houses, of the buildings in Hungerford street, and of some few in the Strand, in order to ensure a proper frontage, and convenient access. The ground was then cleared, the work was commenced, and the <num value="1">First</num> Stone of the new building was laid on Saturday, <datestruct VALUE="1831-06-18"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=18>18th</day>, <year reg=1831>1831</year></datestruct>, by the late Right Honourable George Agar Ellis, Lord Dovor.<NOTE N="d"><P>It is a remarkable circumstance that the Gazette of Friday, <datestruct VALUE="-06-17"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=17>17th</day></datestruct>. <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>, deposited with the other memorials beneath the <num value="1">First</num> Stone of this building, should contain the official announcement of the peerage of Lord Dovor; and that the above ceremony should be the <num value="1">first</num> public act performed by him after he had received the title.</NOTE>

<P>Upon that occasion Alexander Baring, William Courtenay, Andrew Macklew, Esqrs. and other Directors of the Company having assembled with the Rev. Dr. Richards, Vicar of the Church of St. Martin in the Fields, and the parochial charity-children,&mdash;the ceremony commenced by the latter singing the <num value="104">104</num>th Psalm; after which Dr. Richards offered up the following prayer.&mdash;&ldquo;O Almighty and Everliving God, in whom all our good works are begun, continued, and ended, mercifully look down with thy favour upon this undertaking of which we are now about to lay the foundation. Prosper it, we beseech Thee, with thy blessing. Make it the happy instrument of multiplying to us thy bounties, which are showered down upon us, unworthy as we are, in such abundance. Sanctify it to us as the means of preserving to our use the kindly fruits of the earth, so that in due time we may enjoy them; and grant that it may continue a lasting memorial of thy goodness to this great metropolis, to our children and our children's children. Grant this we most humbly beeseech Thee, for the sake of Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.&rdquo;&mdash;The Architect then announced that the bottle which had been prepared to be deposited in the cavity beneath the <num value="1">First</num> Stone, contained the Times newspaper of that morning, the London Gazette of the day preceding, a list of the Directors and Officers of the Hungerford Market Company, and some gold, silver, and copper coins of the sovereign. This bottle having been deposited, and the cavity covered by an inscription-plate, Lord Dovor standing at the south-east angle of the building received the silver trowel; and having spread the mortar the stone was lowered into its place. He then struck it with the mallet, and proved it by the level and square; and closed the ceremony with an address to the audience.&mdash;&ldquo;Allow me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to take this opportunity of expressing the pride and pleasure I feel, that it has fallen to my lot to be called upon this day to lay the <num value="1">First</num> Stone of the Hungerford Market. I trust I may congratulate all present on the prospect which is now held out that the great work so auspiciously begun will go on prosperously; that it will prove a convenience to the public, an ornament to the metropolis, and a source of well-earned profit to the proprietors. I will detain you but <num value="1">one</num> moment longer whilst I allude to what I am willing to consider a fortunate coincidence,&mdash;that this day is the anniversary of the glorious battle of Waterloo; and that, as peace has its victories as well as war, I will venture to hope that this circumstance may be received as a good omen of our having at length vanquished all those difficulties which must ever accompany the undertaking of new public works. I trust we shall now proceed with the <num value="1">one</num> which we have this day commenced, without farther interruption or delay, to its happy and successful completion.&rdquo; 
<P>The erection of the edifice was then rapidly proceeded with, and the fish-department of the Market was opened with the commencement of the oyster-season, Saturday, <datestruct VALUE="1832-08-4"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=4>4th</day>, <year reg=1832>1832</year></datestruct>, at <num value="8">8</num> o'clock in the morning, without any ceremony.

The oysters were, nevertheless, bought up, the sale commencing at <num value="14">14</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> per <num value="100">hundred</num> and ending at <num value="12">12</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>: but this inauspicious beginning might be fairly attributed to the incomplete state of the establishment.<NOTE N="a"><P><hi rend=italics>Observer</hi>, Monday, <datestruct VALUE="1832-08-6"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=6>6th</day>, <year reg=1832>1832</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> About the end of <datestruct VALUE="1833-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, large bills were posted over London, stating that Hungerford Market would be opened on Tuesday, <datestruct VALUE="-07-2"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=2>2</day></datestruct>d; at which time many <num value="1000">thousand</num> persons were assembled in boats on the river, and in all parts of the building: the galleries of the lower quadrangle being to be entered only by tickets. The commencement of the ceremony was announced by cannon, which were also repeatedly fired during the day, and a procession was then conducted throughout the whole premises, consisting of the Beadle of the Market, the workmen, contractors, Architect, the Directors, and other officers of the Company, and the Parochial authorities, with music: after which the Chairman of the Company delivered an address. The opening was also celebrated by a regatta on the river, and by a balloon in which Mr. Graham ascended at <num value="4">4</num> o'clock from the lower quadrangle; as well as by fireworks, an illumination, and a ball, on the river-terrace at night. 
<P>The hall, or principal building of the New Hungerford Market, as described by the Architect, is <num value="157">157</num> feet in length, exclusive of the porticoes, by <num value="123">123</num> feet wide; and consists of a nave, with side-aisles containing ranges of shops against the walls, over which are galleries with counters, for the sale of such articles as require a neat display, arranged somewhat in the manner of a bazaar. In front of these counters along the galleries, is a walk from which the scene below may be advantageously and commodiously viewed; and the ascent from beneath is by <num value="4">four</num> staircases, <num value="1">one</num> at each extremity of the porticoes. The roof of the nave, or centre division of the building, is raised above those of the sides by tiers of open arches, which secure an ample supply of light and air, and the coverings of the aisles are also open in the centre. The floor of the hall is occupied by ranges of stands, with convenient avenues between them and underneath the whole floor are <num value="8">eight</num> series of vaultings, or arched cellars, having approaches in various directions. The columns, stairs, pavement, and parts of the front, of this important building are of granite. This hall is erected between <num value="2">two</num> spacious courts, surrounded by colonnades, built upon different levels accommodated to the descent of the ground towards the river. The north, or upper area, is <num value="140">140</num> feet long by <num value="69">69</num> wide, and, with Hungerford Street, is made level with the Strand; and as the original street did not enter this area in the centre, it is now (<datestruct VALUE="1833-09--"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>) rebuilding in a more uniform situation, and with an increased width of from <num value="20">20</num> to <num value="30">30</num> feet. The houses in this part consist of shops on a moderate scale, and the lower corners of the street of public houses for the upper division of the Market. The lower court, on the south of the hall, is <num value="130">130</num> feet long, by <num value="63">63</num> wide, and is made level with the water-side, the height of <num value="1">one</num> story beneath the former; the descent from the grand central building being by a spacious flight of steps. This constitutes the Fishmarket, and it is terminated by a wharf next the river, about <num value="245">245</num> feet in length; whilst the south front of the building presents a colonnade and terrace, with wings of handsome houses, intended for taverns. The width of the building next the Thames is <num value="126">126</num> feet, and the total length of the Market from the river to Hungerford street is <num value="475">475</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches.<NOTE N="b"><P><hi rend=italics>Description of the Plan for the revival of Hungerford Market, with Plans of the Buildings, and proposed improvements, Lond.</hi> <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, <num value="8">8</num>vo. pp. <num value="26">26</num>. containing a large folding ground-plan, and <num value="3">3</num> outline elevations.</NOTE>

<p><FIGURE id="fig.2.66.1" n="2000.66.0035"><HEAD>A South View of <placename>Queen Elizabeth's Free Grammar School</placename>, in <placename>Tooley Street</placename> in the <placename>Parish of St. Olave, Southwark</placename>; with a Plan of the adjacent Neighbourhood.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 
<P>This noble institution was <num value="1">first</num> planned and erected a Grammar School for the education of the poor as well as the rich, by the pious affection and good dispositions of the ancient inhabitants of the parish of St. Olave. The view here presented has been taken from the old Flemish burying-ground adjoining the premises belonging to the school. 
<P>This edifice (by no means ornamental) is very ancient. Formerly about this spot there stood a number of walnuttrees; and it is observed that this, as well as several other old buildings in the neighbourhood, are principally constructed with that kind of timber. A place called Walnut-tree Alley still remains. 
<P>Amongst the revered lists of parochial benefactors here alluded to, the names of William Humphreys, Vassal Webling, and Thomas Birt, stand most conspicuous. 
<P>With a true feeling for mental, as well as corporal want, they, in consecration as it were, of a part of their wealth to the honour of Him who enabled them to gain it, divided their kind bequests between a provision for the mind as well as the body, and judiciously determined that the Free Grammar School and the charitable funds of this parish should share in their munificence. 
<P>May their memory be blessed, and this record of their well-directed liberality animate others to an imitation of their example! 
<P>The freehold lands belonging to this school are situated principally in the adjoining parish of St. John<NOTE N="*"><P>In the year of our Lord <datestruct value="1735--"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct> this parish was divided, and the parish of St. John Horsleydown was by Act of Parliament taken from it; consequently the parish of St John receives an equal participation in the benefits of this Free Grammar School.</NOTE> (formerly all St. Olave's), in the streets called Freeschool Steet, Fair Street, Back Street, Broad Street, &amp;c. and are usually let by the Governors upon building leases; but though considerably improved of late, and will no doubt continue to improve, they produce no more than is sufficient for the support of an institution of this magnitude: besides, the Governors give yearly a certain sum to the poor of the parish both of St. Olave and St. John, and subscribe very liberally to the support of the <num value="2">two</num> Girls parochial Schools in the said parishes. 
<P>That this most noble institution should descend with improvements to futurity, the worthy inhabitants humbly supplicated the learned and renowned Princess Queen Elizabeth, that, under the royal authority, <num value="16">sixteen</num> of the discreet inhabitants for the time being for ever, might be formed into <num value="1">one</num> body corporate, for the better management of it and its revenue. 
<P>With this petition the illustrious Elizabeth not only most graciously condescended to comply, but signalized her compliance with, among other liberties, privileges, powers and jurisdictions, the high distinction of permitting the school to bear her glorious name. 
<P>And in the charter renewed by Charles the <num value="2">Second</num>, the Governors are authorized to maintain and educate <num value="2">two</num> scholars at the University, if any such shall be elected out of the School, until they have severally taken the degree of Bachelor of Arts; being <num value="1">first</num> brought up in the said School, and inhabitants of the said parish: which scholars are to be elected by the Governors for the time being, and their successors, or the major part of them, and to be allowed such maintenance towards their education in the University, as they the said Governors, and their successors, or the major part of them, shall see fit. The number of boys now educated is nearly <num value="300">three hundred</num>, and all may, upon application, receive a small apprentice fee, upon this proviso, founded upon the strictest attention to their interest, that the masters to whom they are to be bound, be of a good character, of a competent trade, freemen of the city of London, and members of the Church of England. 
<P>Such liberality merits the fullest claim to the successive praises of posterity. This is a seminary, in which the sons of the rich and of the poor may meet together, and receive from the same lips the same instruction&mdash;a school in which genius, however depressed by domestic penury, may raise its befriended head, and not only be taught how to unfold its powers, but also have the path delineated, and be assisted to walk in it, till it can employ them to the public and its own advantage. But the education here bestowed is not confined to the learned professions, or to superior abilities. It extends its beneficial influence to all the occupations of human understanding. For although it has not pleased the Almighty Father of mankind to give to all men indiscriminately the same intellectual powers, equal capacities and comprehensions, proportioning in some measure perhaps the gifts of the mind to the several purposes and uses for which he intends the possessor; yet education, like the former and latter rain, can raise and quicken those seeds which would have lain dormant and inactive in the solid mass, and can give to every grain of ingenuity its own body. The anniversary of this institution is held yearly on the <datestruct VALUE="-11-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, the day on which the illustrious Princess came to the throne, when a sermon is preached on the occasion.<NOTE N="*"><P>The <num value="1">first</num> sermon was preached by the Rev. James Evans, Rector of the parish, <datestruct VALUE="1791-11-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>. At the request of the Governors, this Sermon was printed and circulated in the parish. It has been thought proper to make some extracts from the Sermon here alluded to. 
<P>&ldquo;But, after all, it appears that <num value="1">one</num> important end of the institution of this School, expressly mentioned in its charter, is now almost totally unanswered, namely, the education of the children of the wealthier part of the parishioners. 
<P>&ldquo;No doubt, when this salutary provision was made, there was not those opportunities of education with which the present day so much abounds. But it is a great and singular happiness, that for the initiation of youth in learning, as well as religion, a national method by authority is provided by the establishment of various schools of this description in many parts of the kingdom; and that this our happiness might be more complete, it is sincerely to be wished, that it were the universal method throughout the realm, not only that science might be more thoroughly and regularly taught, but that religion might be more uniform among us; for, whatever respect may be due to the principles and abilities of many individuals, it is in general true that much mischief is done by education being so much in private hands as it is. 
<P>&ldquo;Nor can there be any hesitation in saying that the more our public schools are encouraged, the greater will be the benefit derived to the state, as there is no security that they, who, of their own accord, assume the office of instruction, will not mix their own caprices with the execution of it. What cause then is to be assigned, that the richer part of individuals refuse the education which is here offered to their children? 
<P>&ldquo;If it is an idle fear of bringing an imputation upon their worldly circumstances, such ideas ought to be opposed with a manly firmness, and not to seek at an expensive distance what may be gained at their own doors; having this advantage of retaining their children under their own roofs, of watching daily the improvements they make, and, above all, of being the guardians of their morals.&rdquo;</NOTE>

<P>On this day likewise <num value="2">two</num> clergymen of known respectability and learning are appointed to inspect into the progress of the scholars, and to report the result of their examination to the Court of Governors. <pb id="p.68" n="68"> 
<P>The fidelity with which the Masters acquit themselves, is owing principally to the great attention and most vigilant circumspection of the Governors in their appointment; and to this end, they never suffer any recommendation to operate upon their choice, but that of talent and fitness for the office. 
<P>Robert Tyler, Esq. of Dulwich, late clerk to the Court of Governors, left, after the death of his wife, a considerable legacy to the School, besides <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure> to each of the <num value="7">seven</num> Masters. 
<P>The gentlemen who conduct this institution at the present period are the following:&mdash; 
<emph>GOVERNORS.<NOTE N="*"><P>The Governors usually hold <num value="4">four</num> Courts during the year; namely, in January, March, June, and November; extraordinary Courts are occasionally held. The Governors are authorized by the charter to elect new Governors as often as vacancies occur, who hold their situation for life, unless they resign the office. The Masters, Officers, &amp;c. are elected annually, but in no instance have any of the Masters been removed unless in cases of gross misconduct.</NOTE></emph>

<P>This building is situated on the south side of St. Saviour's churchyard, and is a very handsome structure, well adapted for the purposes of its intention; it consists of a spacious school-room, in which <num value="30">thirty</num> boys receive their education in Grammatical learning. The exterior is a plain brick fabric, consisting of <num value="3">three</num> casement windows on each side of a large door way, before which is an iron railing. This story is surmounted by another, consisting of <num value="7">seven</num> lofty casement windows, furnishing in the whole a neat appearance. 
<P>During the period that monastic foundations flourished in this kingdom, it was customary for schools to be encouraged by the principals of those foundations, for bringing up youth fit to exercise the various offices of the church; and we read that as early as the time of Richard de Belmeis, bishop of London in the reign of King Henry I. a school for the education of youth in classical learning was founded by charter in a part of St. Paul's Cathedral. Attached also to the abbey-church of St. Peter, Westminster, was a school of the same kind; and undoubtedly all the monasteries had similar places for instruction. 
<P>When, however, the dissolution of monasteries, in the reign of Henry VIII. took place, these places for instruction shared equal mischiefs with the abbies to which they belonged; and the dangers operating from such a dispersion of youth and distressed persons, who had had their whole support from monasteries, were so much to be feared, that government considered it highly necessary to form establishments of the like natnre; hence arose those hospitals under the patronage of the city of London, during the reign of Edward VI.; for St. Paul's school, founded by Dean Colet, was then the only grammar-school in which were taught the true rudiments of classical learning in that city. 
<P>When Queen Elizabeth came to the crown, she, as well as her enlightened brother Edward, considered the importance of diffusing learning among her subjects; to forward which she not only re-founded the grammarschool at Westminster, but encouraged her subjects to acts of equal benevolence. 
<P>The priory church of St. Mary Overy, Southwark, having been purchased by the inhabitants as a parish church, the desire of instilling useful knowledge among youth induced Thomas Cure, the Queen's saddler, and several other benevolent persons, to found the grammar-school we are now describing, for the instruction of boys and youth of the same parish; and for this purpose obtained letters patent from Queen Elizabeth in the <num value="4">fourth</num> year of her reign, by which they were formed into a corporation to enact statutes, to purchase and dispose of lands, to appoint masters and scholars to the school, in any way they thought most proper for the benefit of the establishment; and the school has flourished to the present period. 
<P>The charter granted by Queen Elizabeth for the foundation of St. Saviour's Free Grammar-school, is translated as follows: 
<P>&ldquo;Elizabeth, by the grace of God, of England, France and Ireland, Queen, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c. To all to whom these presents shall come, greeting. 
<P>&ldquo;Whereas our beloved subjects Wm.

<P>&ldquo;And for the better effecting our intention aforesaid, and that the lands, tenements, rents, revenues, and other emoluments to be granted, assigned, and appointed for the support and maintenance of the school aforesaid, may be better managed for the continuation of the same, that for the future there may and shall be for ever, within the parish of St. Saviour aforesaid, <num value="6">six</num> of the most discreet and creditable inhabitants of the said <pb id="p.70" n="70"> parish for the time being, who shall be, and shall be called the Governors (managers or trustees) of the possessions, revenues, and goods of the said Grammar-school, commonly called, or to be called, the Free Grammarschool of the parishioners of the parish of St. Saviour, in Southwark, in the county of Surrey. 
<P>&ldquo;And therefore know ye, that we have assigned, elected, nominated, constituted, and declared, by these presents, that our aforesaid beloved Thomas Cure, Richard Ryall, John Oliff, Thomas Pulter, Thomas Biff, and William Browker, inhabitants of the said parish, shall be and are the <num value="1">first</num> and present modern governors of the possessions, revenues, and goods of the said Free Grammar-school of the parishioners of the parish of St. Saviour, in Southwark, in the county of Surrey; for the well and faithful exercising and occupying of the said office during their lives, from the date of these presents; and that the said governors, in reality, fact, and name, moreover may and shall be <num value="1">one</num> body corporate and politic by themselves for ever incorporated and erected under the name of the Governors of the possessions, revenues, and estates of the Free Grammar-school of the parishioners of the parish of St. Saviour, in Southwark, in the county of Surrey; and we by these presents incorporate the said Thomas Cure, Richard Ryall, John Oliff, Thomas Pulter, Thomas Biff, and William Browker, governors of the possessions, revenues, and estates of the Free Grammar-school of the parish of St. Saviour, in Southwark, in the county of Surrey; and we really and fully create, erect, ordain, make, and constitute by these presents, a body corporate and politic, under the same name for ever.

<P>&ldquo;By a brief from the Privy Seal of the date aforesaid, with the authority of Parliament. 
<P>&ldquo;P. CORDET.&rdquo; 
<P>The statutes and orders for the government of this school are very excellent for that purpose; and were drawn up by the founders, and improved by their immediate successors, with the approbation of Dr. Robert Horne, in <datestruct value="1562--"><year reg="1562">1562</year></datestruct>, and Dr. Thomas Bilson, in <datestruct value="1614--"><year reg="1614">1614</year></datestruct>, both bishops of Winchester. We shall select from those in <datestruct value="1614--"><year reg="1614">1614</year></datestruct>, the regulations as far as relates to the admission of scholars. 
<emph>&ldquo;Of the Choice of the Scholars, and their Admission.</emph>

<P>&ldquo;The scholars shall be of the children and youth of the parish of St. Saviour, there born or dwelling; but if the governors see reason, they may also take in those of other parishes and places, so that the whole number exceed not <num value="100">one hundred</num>, lest the school-master and usher, oppressed with multitude, shall not be able to set forward their scholars with credit and profit; provided that no parishioner's son nor youth be refused. 
<P>&ldquo;The scholar shall be a boy of that age and towardness, that he be able to read English well, and to write a legible hand, and already entered, or fit to be entered, into the Accidence or Grammar in Latin at the least. 
<P>&ldquo;He shall be brought to the school, with his parents, master, or governor, and by <num value="1">one</num> of the governors of the same school, to be entered and admitted; for the parent, master or governor of the child shall come to the governor of the school, appointed for admission, or in his absence to <num value="1">one</num> of the other governors, signifying their desire to have a child taught in the same school, and request his furtherance for the admission. 
<P>&ldquo;When the child by the parent, master, or governor is brought to the school, the school-master, or in his necessary absence, the usher, shall read unto such parent, master, or governor, these orders, viz. 
<P>&lsquo;If you will have your child a scholar here, you must submit your child to be ordered in all things according to the statutes of this school, the discretion of the master, and the direction of the governors. 
<P>&lsquo;You shall, upon warning given by the master or usher, to the child, furnish him with all things fit for his learning, as a little Bible or Psalm Book, and other books, paper, pens, ink, satchel, candles in winter, wholesome and handsome clothing beseeming your estate. You shall take care of his body, to be clear and healthful, as well for the comfort of himself, as other convenient considerations to be observed in the school. 
<P>&lsquo;You shall provide that he may keep his ordinary hours and times in coming to school, and shall not take him thence any such time as he may miss lectures, doing of his task enjoined, or repetitions, without good cause of sickness, or any other occasion, to be made known to the master, for fear his not profiting be unjustly imputed to the school and teachers, which indeed is the only fault of such parents; and also lest the boy, accustomed to be absent, without his master's knowledge of the cause why, may use to be a truant, and so lose his time, to the discomfort of his parents and teacher, and undoing of the child. 
<P>&lsquo;You shall also take special care of your child when, by the orders of the school, he is to be absent at dinner-time, supper-time, and after all holydays and play-days, whereof you have knowledge, that your child be not at liberty to frequent naughty company, which may infect his conversation with any ill quality or hurt to his body or health; but shall see him civilly aud religiously spend his time; for, by this kind of license, the child, well instructed at school, will not only lose his master's virtuous directions, but learn to take no care, nor make conscience of any nurture. 
<P>&lsquo;You shall not cease to call upon him to use the time of his absence from the school, in repetition and further confirming that which he hath learned, as also of preparing himself against his next coming to school. This great discretion and severity at home, will make him love the school, desire to give his parents satisfaction of his profiting, and perfect that good learning and manners which his master at school shall teach him; fo <pb id="p.72" n="72"> the master may do much, but good and discreet government at home makes all sure and doth the greatest good; for the master, in his absence, cannot follow them, so that ill government at home may do more hurt than the master can do good at school. 
<P>&lsquo;You shall not suffer your child to bring any money of his own to the school, but leave it at home, that he may not be tempted to buy and sell at school, or others tempted to defraud him of it. 
<P>&lsquo;You shall pay all such duties to the school-master or usher, as by the orders of the school is required at your hands, viz. <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence to the master at their entrance, and <measure value="2d." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> pence</measure> every quarter towards brooms and rods, and to the usher fourpence every quarter, and the week after Michaelmas, <measure value="1l." type=currency><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> of good candles, to burn the winter following at their studies. 
<P>&lsquo;If you refuse these good orders, or that your child grow unruly or stubborn, or a picker, stealer, or usual swearer or blasphemer, or use any revellings, or threatening speeches towards the school-master and usher, and do not presently reconcile himself with submission, upon knowledge thereof you shall be content your child shall be for ever banished by the governors and schoolmaster, and peaceably take him away, and yourself shall bear the blame of his not profiting, but the credit of the school shall be maintained as good and laudable.&rsquo; 
<P>&ldquo;If the parent or governor promise thus much, then let his child be admitted by the governors and received by the school-master in this form: the child with his own hand shall write in a book for that purpose, his name, parents, country born, age, and book which he learneth, with the day and year of his admission, and subscribe it with his name as thus: 
<P>&lsquo;I John Thompson, the <num value="1">first</num>, <num value="2">second</num>, or <num value="3">third</num>, &amp;c. son of Richard Thompson, of the parish of St. Saviour in Southwark, in the county of Surrey, chandler, of the age of <num value="7">seven</num> years and <num value="3">three</num> months, reading and learning in the Accidence, and entering into Propria qu&aelig; Maribus, and also Tully his <num value="2">second</num> Epistle, among those gathered by Sternius, and Corderius' Dialogues, &amp;c. was admitted into the Grammar-school of St. Saviour in Southwark, the <datestruct VALUE="-01-19"><day reg="19">nineteenth</day> day of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>, in the year of our Lord <datestruct value="1611--"><year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct>. 
<P>&lsquo;By me, 
<P>&lsquo;JOHN THOMPSON.&rsquo; 
<P>&ldquo;This done, and the accustomed fees paid for entrance, the master shall place him in his form that shall be best fit for his learning.&rdquo; 
<P>There are exhibitions in the <num value="2">two</num> universities for scholars of St. Saviour's Grammar-school; particularly for <num value="2">two</num> scholars, by the gift of John Bingham, Esq. formerly a governor.

<P>No country in the known world abounds so much in charitable institutions, and endowments for those purposes, as Great Britain; and no particular place for its extent, can vie with or compare to London, for the number and variety of its establishments of this description. A stranger can neither enter nor depart out of the capital, by any road, but his eye is attracted by some humane establishment or other. Almshouses, Hospitals, and Public Schools present themselves in every direction; and the means of education for the poorer classes of late vears have so much increased throughout the country, that there is not a village but has an establishment for this truly laudable end.<NOTE N="*"><P>His present Majesty George III. is well known to have greatly encouraged and patronized every plan for educating and bettering the condition of the poor; and on <num value="1">one</num> occasion was heard to say, he hoped the time was not far distant, when every person of suitable years, throughout the kingdom, would be able to read his Bible.</NOTE> Among the earlier promoters of these beneficial plans, was Mr. Ralph Davenant, Rector of St. Mary, Whitechapel, who towards the end of the reign of King Charles the <num value="2">Second</num>, founded a Free School, for the poor children of that parish to be taught gratis; but wanting a sufficient endowment to carry it into proper effect, it was upwards of <num value="20">twenty</num> years after the death of the original founder, considerably enriched by a donation of <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">one thousand</num> pounds</measure>; as was expressed by an inscription on the gallery in the church west, where the children then used to sit, viz. 
<P>&ldquo;Anno <datestruct value="1701"><year reg="1701">1701</year></datestruct>.

<P>The name of the noble-minded person who gave this <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">one thousand</num> pounds</measure>, ever remained unknown; but it was conjectured to have been a lady, who, going out of town, saw the school, and was informed of the great number of poor people, inhabitants of this parish, not able to give their children education. 
<P>The following are the particulars of this building and its original endowment. 
<P>These Schools (for there are <num value="2">two</num> of them) are situated on the north side of what is now called the Roadside, Whitechapel, adjoining to the Workhouse, a plain, modern, extensive, and commodious erection; and were founded A. D. <datestruct value="1680"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>, by indenture tripartite &ldquo;between Ralph Davenant, Clerk, Rector of the parish church of St. Mary Matfellon, alias Whitechapel, in the County of Middlesex; and Mary, his wife, relict of William Vesey, Clerk, deceased; and <num value="1">one</num> of the daughters and coheirs of John Johnson, Doctor in Divinity, late Rector of the parish, of the <num value="1">first</num> part: &mdash;and Henry Gullifer, Citizen and Dyer of London, and Sarah his wife, <num value="1">one</num> other of the daughters and coheirs of the said John Johnson, of the <num value="2">second</num> part;&rdquo; and <num value="13">thirteen</num> trustees, whose names are mentioned in the indenture, but who need not to be here named, &ldquo;on the <num value="3">third</num> part:&rdquo; and endowed the <num value="1">one</num> for boys, by the aforesaid Ralph Davenant and Mary his wife, with <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3">third</num> portion of an estate in Essex, commonly called Sandon Park; the other for girls, endowed by the aforesaid Henry Gullifer and Sarah his wife, with <num value="1">one</num> other <num value="3">third</num> portion of the above-mentioned estate; and the uses are as follow: 
<P><num value="1">First</num>, the Boys' School.&mdash;&ldquo;Towards the finding and keeping in the parish of St. Mary Matfellon, alias Whitechapel, from time to time for ever, after the decease of the said Ralph Davenant and Mary his wife, <num value="1">one</num> Schoolmaster, who shall be a man of sober life and conversation, and in full Communion with the Church of England, and chosen by the Trustees for the time being, in a School, to be provided for him by the said Ralph Davenant, or otherwise out of the rents and profits of the same; <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3">third</num> for the teaching of <num value="40">forty</num> boys, born in the said parish of St. Mary, Whitechapel, to be from time to time chosen by the said Trustees: and the said Trustees shall pay such Schoolmaster all the clear rents and profits of the same; <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3">third</num> part to be paid half-yearly: in consideration of which payment, and of his dwelling in the School-house, he shall carefully and according to the direction of the Trustees, teach the aforesaid boys to read English, and to write and cypher; and that he be especially obliged to teach them the Catechism of the Church of England, and to instruct them in the principles of Christianity; and this he shall be bound to do without taking any other reward, directly or indirectly, for teaching the said poor children; neither shall he teach any more than the said <num value="40">forty</num> boys, except he do maintain an usher at his own charges, without neglecting the <num value="40">forty</num> boys of the Foundation, and withal he shall not admit above <num value="30">thirty</num> scholars more in any case.&rdquo; 
<P>Uses of the Girls' School.&mdash;&ldquo;<num value="1">First</num>, That out of the clear rents and profits of the said <num value="3">third</num> part, <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> pounds</measure> per annum shall be paid and applied for and towards the finding and keeping a skilful woman of the Church of England, to be chosen by the Trustees, to teach in a School to be provided for her by the said Ralph Davenant, or otherwise, out of the rents and profits of the same <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3">third</num> part, <num value="30">thirty</num> poor girls born in the said parish, to be chosen by the said Trustees; in consideration of which <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> pounds</measure> per annum, and of her dwelling iu the School-house, she shall carefully and according to the direction of the Trustees, teach the aforesaid <num value="30">thirty</num> poor girls <num value="1">one</num> part of the day to read, and learn, without book, the Catechism of the Church of England; and the other part of the day to knit and sew plain work, and to do any other work which the Trustees shall think needful for them to learn; and this she shall be bound to do without taking any reward, directly or indirectly, for the teaching of the said poor children, except she shall find them materials to work upon; and then, and in such case, she shall have the benefit of the work which the girls shall do, or <pb id="p.74" n="74"> so much thereof as the Trustees shall see reasonable: neither shall she teach any other besides the said <num value="30">thirty</num> poor girls, except she do maintain an assistant at her own charges, without neglecting the said <num value="30">thirty</num> poor girls of the Foundation; and withal, she shall not admit of above <num value="30">thirty</num> scholars more in any case; and to the intent that the residue and the remainder of the clear yearly profits of the same <num value="3">third</num> part shall be laid out yearly in materials for the said girls to work with, which when done shall be divided amongst them, according to the discretion and direction of the Trustees for their better encouragement: that the schoolmaster and mistress, with their scholars, shall on all holydays and work days, when divine service is performed at the parish church, in orderly and decent manner resort to it; and the master and mistress shall take care that the scholars behave themselves with due reverence and attention, and that they shall say their Catechism publicly in the church, so often as the Rector or Curate of the parish shall think fit to require them.&rdquo; 
<P>The above uses have been copied verbatim from <num value="2">two</num> schedules annexed to the indenture; and have been kindly furnished by the present Rector of Whitechapel, the Rev. Daniell Mathias, to whom the publisher is further indebted for the following particulars: 
<P>The Rev. Ralph Davenant, D.D. by his will, which is dated A. D. <datestruct value="1680"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>, appears to have made ample provision for the erection of these Schools, which he therein says, that he &ldquo;had intended building in his lifetime.&rdquo; And it hence appears, that he was a member of Trinity Hall, Cambridge; and he leaves &ldquo;to the Master, Fellows, and Scholars, <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">one hundred</num> pounds</measure>, to be laid out in books for the library.&rdquo; 
<P>It appears likewise, that he was a native of Gillingham, in Dorsetshire, to the poor of which parish he leaves <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure>, to be distributed after his demise; and also &ldquo;<measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">one hundred</num> pounds</measure> to the Bishop of Exeter, to be distributed by him amongst such of the poor clergy, and their widows and children, in his diocese, as he shall think most meet, and do deserve this charity.&rdquo; 
<P>The estate at Sandon seems to have been the marriage-portion of the <num value="3">three</num> daughters and coheirs of the Rev. John Johnson, viz. Mary, the wife of Ralph Davenant, and Sarah, the wife of Henry Gullifer (these <num value="2">two</num> died without issue), and Judith Rachel, the wife of Davant Jenkinson. This Judith had issue, and to them the <num value="3">third</num> portion of the estate descended. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, the <num value="2">two</num> portions of this estate, with which these Schools had been endowed, were separated from the remainder by Act of Parliament, and now form <num value="1">one</num> entire farm, producing an income of <num value="200">200</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> per annum. 
<P>It might be thought that the effigy in front of these Schools, with its canonical decorations, was a representation of their venerable and pious Founder. But Fronte nulla fides. The fact is, it was met with and purchased some <num value="30">thirty</num> years ago (the representation of whom no <num value="1">one</num> can say), by Samuel Hawkins, Esq. then Treasurer to these Schools, and placed by him in the niche hitherto unoccupied, to ornament the building, and to attract the eyes of the beholders. 
<P>In the year <datestruct value="1705"><year reg="1705">1705</year></datestruct> an unknown benefactor purchased an estate at East Tilbury for <measure value="900l." type=currency><num value="900">nine hundred</num> pounds</measure>, and gave it in aid of these Schools, recommending at the time, if the funds would allow of it, that clothing might be added to education. The name of this liberal benefactor has never been divulged. 
<P>Since this period many and munificent have been the benefactions to these Schools: so that at present their permanent income from funded and landed property is not much less than <num value="600">six hundred</num> per annum. <num value="100">One hundred</num> boys and <num value="100">one hundred</num> girls are now taught, clothed and apprenticed (when apprenticing fees <num value="1">first</num> began to be given does not appear), in these Schools. The children chosen are, agreeable to the foundation deed, the poor born in the parish. They are elected without the least favouritism, according to priority of application, at the age of <num value="8">eight</num> years, and are apprenticed out at <num value="14">fourteen</num>; care always being had, that their masters and mistresses be of useful trades, good characters, and members of the established church. 
<P>Perhaps it may be right here to mention a wise and liberal bequest lately made to these Schools, in the very spirit and design of the original Foundation. Luke Flood, Esq. late Treasurer, leaves <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> consols; the interest to accumulate for <num value="7">seven</num> years, and then to be divided annually amongst such boys as shall have completed the term of their apprenticeship, and shall produce testimonials from their masters, that they have served them faithfully, and from some minister of the established church, that they have attended divine service regularly. 
<P>It is but an act of justice to the Trustees, to whom the management of these Schools has been from time to time committed, here to state, that there no where appears ever to have been any misapplication of the funds. No alterations have been made but for the better. There have been an augmentation of the funds, an augmentation of the numbers educated, an augmentation of advantages to the children, an augmentation of the master and mistress's salaries, and consequently, an augmentation of the means of doing good. 
<P>Independent of local benefits, these Schools (under divine Providence) have been the instrument of giving much good to the nation at large. In them Dr. Bell <num value="1">first</num> introduced and practised his system of education. When this system was much sought after, it was here found in great perfection. Hence very many schools throughout the kingdom derived a knowledge of this efficacious mode: and before the formation of the Central National School, this was, perhaps, the only place whence teachers, properly qualified, could be had. 
<P>The Schools, having stood nearly a century and a half, were lately taken down, and a very handsome and more commodious building erected on their site; the cost of which had long been providing and provided for by the several benefactions, given expressly for this purpose. 
<P>The accompanying view of these Schools is a faithful representation of the place as originally built, with the entrance and walled Court-yard, showing the passage through the building to the garden or outward grounds. The niche in the centre evidently designates the use for which it was intended; and but for the information of the Reverend Gentleman who favoured us with the foregoing particulars, we should have been induced to think the effigy coeval in antiquity with the niche, and that the <num value="1">one</num> was constructed to supply the deficiency of the other; and convey to posterity the physiognomy and costume of the pious and worthy Rector, Ralph Davenant, the munificent founder. 
<P>The <num value="2">two</num> entablatures under the view of the Schools are given from the <hi rend=italics>stone</hi> originals placed in front of the old building; but now rendered useless to preserve, from the considerable augmentation the Charity has received subsequent to their being set up. 
<P>The Inscription cut in stone, and placed in an arched recess over the entrance to the new edifice, which is built in a line with the workhouse, is as under:

<P>In the ordinary histories of this excellent establishment, it is commonly observed that there are traces remaining of a seminary connected with St. Paul's Cathedral, earlier than that founded by Dean Colet; but without giving any particular information concerning it, or even accurately distinguishing it from that much more recent foundation, although they were existing at the same time and were altogether different. The only full and satisfactory account of the Ancient St. Paul's School, is contained in an unpublished well-written series of letters and documents, printed some years since, relating to a persevering and meritorious, although an unsuccessful, attempt to recover the benefits of that school to those for whom they were originally intended; the boys of the Cathedral choir.<NOTE N="a"><P><hi rend=italics>A Series of Evidences respecting the Ancient Foundation for the Education of the St. Paul's Choristers, from the Twelfth to the Eighteenth Century.

This <num value="1">first</num> edition was a pamphlet of <num value="28">28</num> pages, which was afterwards succeeded by an enlarged impression of the same matter, containing <num value="122">122</num> pages in the whole, and also printed for private circulation only, entitled, <hi rend=italics>Correspondence, Legal Proceedings, and Evidences, respecting the Ancient School attached to St. Paul's Cathedral</hi>, Lond. <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, <num value="4">4</num>to. The correspondence consists of copies of the letters and answers which passed between the compiler of the work and all the principal officers of the Cathedral, between <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct> and <datestruct VALUE="1813-10--"><month reg="10">October</month> <year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>. It is related in the <num value="1">first</num> letter of that correspondence, addressed to the Bishop of London, <datestruct VALUE="1812-01-12"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=12>12th</day>, <year reg=1812>1812</year></datestruct>, that the following was the neglected state of the children belonging to the choir of St. Paul's, which had been for some time a subject of general animadversion; especially when viewed in contrast with their former condition.&mdash;In the earlier ages of the Cathedral, the choristers and other members of the choir formed part of the Dean's household; and even when the latter ceased to live together as a community, the children-choristers, or <hi rend=italics>pueri eleemosynarii</hi>, still continued to enjoy the same advantage: since when they had been once received into the Church, their board, education, and all other contingencies, were provided for by the estates devoted to that purpose, which were then more than sufficient to defray all those expenses. Even until within a few years previous to the commencement of this correspondence, they were still maintained and educated from the funds of the Cathedral; but the original sum allowed for their board having become totally inadequate thereto, through the depreciation of money, in the year <datestruct value="1800"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct> the Almoner of St. Paul's applied to the Chapter for an augmentation. Instead of complying with his request, the Chapter declined making any addition to the sum anciently assigned for the maintenance of the choristers, and the Almoner was obliged to dismiss them from his protection, though he divided between them their trifling salary; pp. <num value="1">1</num>, <num value="2">2</num>,.<num value="25">25</num>, note a. It is believed that a sum under <num value="40">40</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> per annum, probably the nominal value of the ancient estates of the school, was divided between the parents of the choristers instead of being applied to the education of the children; and about the same sum, formerly an ample allowance to the Almoner for the board of <num value="10">ten</num> boys, was paid as an equivalent for their maintenance; p. <num value="7">7</num>, note a. In consequence of this dismissal, many of the children of the choir reside at a considerable distance from the Church and Singing- Master, and much of the day is consumed in the streets, without any inquiry being made as to the employment of their time; since if they appear in their places at the hours of service, no thought is bestowed upon their conduct during the remainder of the day. To remunerate their singing-master for his instruction,&mdash;though as it may be also observed in some degree to benefit themselves by the practice afforded them,&mdash;they are frequently hired out to Oratorios at the Theatres, and to public concerts, in the evening, and exposed unprotected to whatever society they may meet with in such assemblies, and left to find their way home after the conclusion of the performance: all which is in direct disregard of the statute concerning them, which orders that some mature person should watch over them, even in going to and returning from school. Nor was their education less neglected, since excepting that they attended the singing-master for the lessons requisite to enable them to perform the choralservice, and that they were called upon a very few times in the year to repeat the Catechism, they were literally kept without instruction. The Almoner, however, a short time before the publication of this Correspondence, had &ldquo;engaged a writing-master to attend them twice a week for about <num value="2">two</num> hours; which was the utmost time allotted for their education throughout the day, exclusive of their casual lessons in music, which rarely occupied half so much: their master professing that his time between <num value="9">9</num> in the morning and <num value="5">5</num> in the evening was too valuable to be bestowed on the choristers;&rdquo; p. <num value="50">50</num>.&mdash;The volume whence these particulars are extracted states of the chorister on whose behalf the <num value="1">first</num> efforts were made for reviving the Ancient School of the Cathedral,&mdash;that he was scarcely <num value="7">seven</num> years of age when he entered the choir; that his conduct there had been unexceptionable; that his attendance on it prevented his education elsewhere; that when he was upon the point of leaving the music-school at <num value="16">sixteen</num>, he could neither play a bar, nor had he even been taught to read his notes; and that he had then an employment and an education to seek. p. <num value="37">37</num>. As to the classical learning of the choristers it is observed that the foundation bearing the name of their Ancient School refuses to admit them, under the plea that liberal provision had been made for the education of the Cathedral-boys, though the law by which they are excluded is not stated. p. <num value="19">19</num>. 
<P>In consequence of this neglected state of the choristers, in <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct> a petition on their behalf was presented to the Master of the Rolls, under the Act of the <num value="52">52nd</num> year of George III., <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, for providing a summary remedy in cases of abuses of trusts created for charitable purposes. The cause came to a hearing on <datestruct VALUE="1814-04-28"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=28>28th</day>, <year reg=1814>1814</year></datestruct>, Sir Samuel Romilly. Mr., now Sir Lancelot, Shadwell, and Mr. Stephen, being counsel for the petitioners, and Mr. Leach and Mr. Bell appearing for the Dean and Chapter, Chancellor, and Almoner of St. Paul's. The pleadings were resumed on <datestruct VALUE="-05-2"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=2>2nd</day></datestruct>, when Mr. Greenhill was heard on the part of the Precentor, and Mr. Harbord on that of the Chancellor; after whom Sir Samuel Romilly spoke at considerable length in reply. The Master of the Rolls reserved the case for further deliberation; but on <datestruct VALUE="-08-5"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=5>5th</day></datestruct> he delivered his decision to the effect following.&mdash;That a very considerable proportion of the petition related to objects out of the jurisdiction of the Court; or with regard to which the Court could not exercise its jurisdiction in a summary mode of proceeding: that he concluded the Court had nothing to do with the observance or non-observance of the statutes of a Cathedral, or the performance of the duties of its ministers and officers: that the petition stated that certain funds are not applied to their intended purposes, and if the Court <hi rend=italics>had</hi> jurisdiction to decide on the <hi rend=italics>existence of a charitable trust</hi>, it would be proper ground of complaint; but as that became a question of property, it should be decided in the same solemn manner in which every other question of property is decided: and, in fine, that the <hi rend=italics>existence of the trust</hi>
was the point of controversy between the parties. &ldquo;It had been attempted to be shewn,&rdquo; continued the Master of the Rolls, &ldquo;that the estates of the Dean and Chapter, and of the Chancellor of St. Paul's, are liable to certain burthens and trusts to which, within living memory, they have never been subject. Documents are produced, which are ancient instruments, for the purpose of shewing that grants have been made to the Chancellor of lands, tythes, and other property for the purpose of supporting and maintaining a school for the education of the choristers, but it does not appear to me that these documents do at any time distinctly shew that to have been the purport of those grants. The officer,&mdash;namely, the Registrar of the Dean and Chapter,&mdash;does not admit of any such trust. The Act of Parliament says <hi rend=italics>not that the Court is summarily to decide whether the estates be subject to such a charitable trust</hi>; but that in every case of <hi rend=italics>a breach, or supposed breach, of any trust created for charitable purposes, it should be lawful for the Court to proceed upon petition.</hi> The only case in which it is stated that there is any devise or grant to the Almoner for a charitable purpose, is that of the will of Richard De Newport, who gave certain houses to the Almoner for the maintenance of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> choristers, for a period not exceeding <num value="2">two</num> years after their voices were broken. The Almoner takes no notice of this in his affidavit, and does not state whether the houses exist; but Mr. Hodgson,&mdash;the Registrar,&mdash;in <num value="1">one</num> of his affidavits, states he is informed, and believes, that the Almoner of the Cathedral, for the time being, has been in the habit of maintaining a chorister or <num value="2">two</num> after they have ceased to sing in the Cathedral, in consequence of the breaking of their voices, until they have been otherwise provided for. This, therefore, should seem to be a subsisting and undisputed charity; and it appears that there must be an enquiry what the trust consists of, what are the rents and profits, and how they are applied.&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Correspondence, &amp;c. on the Ancient School of St. Paul's</hi>, pp. <num value="63">63</num>-<num value="66">66</num>.</NOTE>&mdash; So early as the <num value="8">eighth</num> century the Papal injunctions required that every Conventual Church should have a school adjoining to it, under its immediate care and control; whence originated the ancient Catholic proverb, &ldquo;wherever there is a monastery there is a school.&rdquo; It is not improbable that the <num value="1">first</num> foundation of such seminaries in Britain was contemporaneous with that of the Churches of which they formed a part; and such an antiquity seems to be hinted at in that Decree of the Eleventh General Lateran Council, A.D. <datestruct value="1179"><year reg="1179">1179</year></datestruct>, which ordains that every Cathedral Church should have its schoolmaster, as, it is added, has been accustomed.<NOTE N="b"><P>Article xxii. &ldquo;Forasmuch as the Church of God, like a holy mother, looking sometimes to the support of the body, and sometimes that benefit should be increased to the souls of the poor,&mdash;is bound to provide that the poor should not have all opportunities of learning and profiting taken away, though they cannot be aided by the power of their own relations;&mdash;in every Cathedral-Church a master ought to teach poor scholars, he being a Clerk of the same Church, to whom some adequate benefice should be assigned. The like also should be <hi rend=italics>restored</hi> in other Churches and Monasteries, if in times past any such have belonged to them and have been taken away: which Master by his teaching should succour the poor, and by his learning spread open the way to instruction. And for liberty of teaching no price whatsoever should be demanded or obtained, under any custom from any of those who desire to teach; nor are any whomsoever to be prevented from being taught who greatly desire it, and are fitting for it. And he who shall presume to act against this ordinance shall be displaced from his ecclesiastical benefice. It is meet also to be observed, that he who is of a covetous soul shall not have the fruit of his labour in the Church of God, whilst he sells the ecclesiastical licence of teaching to the hindrance of the fair profit of others.&rdquo; &mdash;<hi rend=italics>Chronicon Gercasii Dorobernensis.</hi> A.D. <datestruct value="1179"><year reg="1179">1179</year></datestruct>, <datestruct VALUE="-04-5"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=5>5th</day></datestruct>, Henry II.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Histori&aelig; Anglican&aelig; Scriptores X.</hi>, by Roger Twysden, Lond. <datestruct value="1652--"><year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct>, fol. col. <datestruct value="1454--"><year reg="1454">1454</year></datestruct>.</NOTE>&mdash;Of the establishment connected with St. Paul's in London, the <num value="1">first</num> notice now extant appears to be a charter of Richard De Belmeis, or Beaumes, Bishop of London, about A.D. <datestruct value="1123"><year reg="1123">1123</year></datestruct>, granting to Hugh the Schoolmaster and his successors, <pb id="p.76" n="76"> the habitation of <num value="1">one</num> Darandus, at the corner of the turret or bell-tower, together with the custody of the Library belonging to the Cathedral.<NOTE N="a"><P>Harleian MSS.

He was also called 
<hi rend=italics>Magister Scholarum</hi>, or Master of the Schools, not only as being at the head of that attached to St. Paul's, but also as possessing the direction of all others within the City. His duty in the former character was especially to find a fit acting Master for the Grammar-School of St. Paul's, and, having presented him to the Dean and Chapter for approval, to give him possession of the office; and farther at his own expense to keep in repair the houses and buildings belonging to the school. The master thus appointed was to be a sober honest man, of good and laudable learning, who should instruct the boys, especially those belonging to the Church, in grammar, and set them an example of a good life, taking care not to deprave the minds of those little ones by any evil in word or deed, but with chaste language and conversation to train them up into holiness and the fear of God, and be unto them a master, not in grammar only, but also in virtue and piety. So scrupulously indeed was he required to watch over them, that the statutes direct him to place them under a proper conductor in their walks and in going to school.<NOTE N="e"><P>Dugdale's

<P>Down to the beginning of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, almost the only acts of public charity in England were the erecting and adorning of Churches, the foundation and endowment of monasteries and religious houses, the establishment of chantries for the dead, and the making of some provision for students in the Universities. At this period Dr. John Colet, Dean of St. Paul's, appears carefully to have considered the best means of securely investing and consecrating the ample estate which he possessed, in some extensive and perpetual charity which should be most generally useful and beneficial to the Church and nation of England: he having then no near relation living, though he had been the oldest of <num value="22">twenty-two</num> children. He was at length convinced that it would be the most effectually conducing to the restoration of learning to provide a Grammar-school for the instruction of youth, the seat of which he appears to have soon resolved should be in London, since that was not only his native City, but he was also the <num value="2">second</num> dignitary of the Metropolitan Cathedral there, and he found it in nothing more defective than public schools.<NOTE N="j"><P>Knight's &ldquo;Life of Dean Colet,&rdquo; pp. <num value="98">98</num>-<num value="100">100</num>.&mdash;It appears from a petition to the Commons in Parliament in the <num value="25">25th</num> year of Henry VI., <datestruct value="1447--"><year reg="1447">1447</year></datestruct>, that this deficiency of Schools in London had been for a considerable time a subject of complaint, which probably arose from that privilege granted to the Magister Scholarum of St. Paul's already mentioned. The commencement of the memorial desires the assembled Commons &ldquo;to considre the grete nombre of Gramer Scoles that sometime were in divers partes of this realme, besyde tho that were in London, and howe fewe ben in thise dayes; and the grete hurt that is caused of this&mdash;not oonly in the Spirituel partie of the Churche, where often tymes it apperith too openly in som persones with grete shame, but also in the Temporell parties, to whom it is full expedient to component congruite, for many causes, as to your wisedoms apperith. And for as muche as to the Citie of London the commune concours of this lond, wherein is grete multitude of younge peple, not oonly borne and brought forthe in the same Citie, but also of many other parties of this lond, some for lacke of Scole-maistres in their oune contree, for to be enfourmed of Gramer there, and some for grete almesse of lordes, merchaunts, and other, the which is in London more plenteously done than in many other places in this reaume, to such pouere creatures as never should have been brought to so grete vertu and connying as thei have, ne hadde it ben by the meane of the almes abovesaid:&mdash;Wherefore it were expedient that in London were a sufficeant nombre of Scoles, and good enfourmers in Gramer; and not for the singular avail of ii or iii persones grevously to hurt the multitude of yong people of all this lond: For where there is grete nombre of lerners and few techers, and all the lerners be compelled to go to the same few techers and to noon other, the maistres wexen riche in money and the lerners pouere in connyng, as experience openly shewith against all vertu and ordre of well publick.&rdquo;&mdash;The petition goes on to request that the Commons would intercede with the King for the establishment of Grammar-Schools in the Parishes of Allhallows the Greater, St. Andrew's in Holborn Suburbs, St. Peter's upon Cornhill, and St. Mary Colechurch, in London; under Master William Lycchefield, Master Gilbert, and Master John Cote, the Parsons of those Churches, and John Neell, Master of the Hospital of St. Thomas of Acres, and their successors; which petition was complied with and the seminaries instituted.&mdash;&ldquo;Rotuli Parliamentorum ut et Petitiones of Placita in Parliamento.&rdquo; fol. vol. v. p. <num value="137">137</num>. No. <num value="1">1</num>.</NOTE> &ldquo;It may seem,&rdquo; says Fuller, &ldquo;false Latin that this Colet, being Dean of Paul's, the school dedicated to St. Paul, and distanced but the breadth of a street from St. Paul's Church,&mdash;should not intrust it to the inspection of his successors, the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's, but committed it to the care of <pb id="p.78" n="78"> the Company of Mercers for the managing thereof. But Erasmus rendereth a good reason from the mouth and minde of Colet himself, who had found by experience many laymen as conscientious as clergymen in discharging this trust in this kinde; conceiving also that a whole company was not so easie to be bowed to corruption as any single person, how eminent and publick soever.&mdash;For my own part, I behold Colet's act herein as not only prudential, but something prophetical, as foreseeing the ruin of church-lands, and fearing that this his school, if made an ecclesiastical appendage, might in the fall of church-lands get a bruise, if not lose a limb thereby.&rdquo;<NOTE N="a"><P>&ldquo;The Church History of Britain,&rdquo; by Thomas Fuller, Lond. <datestruct value="1655--"><year reg="1655">1655</year></datestruct>. fol. book v. Century xvi. <num value="167">167</num>, paragr. <num value="15">15</num>, <num value="16">16</num>.</NOTE>&mdash;The latter was also probably the chief reason that the Dean did not more immediately connect his establishment with the Ancient School belonging to the Cathedral and choir; added to which Dr. Knight observes that he wished his seminary to be independent of the power of the Chancellor of St. Paul's over the schools of London, which perhaps he had observed to be somewhat abused; and therefore made a distinct separation between them, and constituted the Company of Mercers governors of his foundation.<NOTE N="b"><P>Knight's &ldquo;Life of Dean Colet,&rdquo; p. <num value="118">118</num>.</NOTE>

<P>In stating the exact period at which the School of Dean Colet was established, Dr. Knight remarks that &ldquo;our common historians have differed so much in the date of its foundation, taking their liberty within the space of <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> years;&rdquo; and he assigns as a reason the time occupied in buying and clearing the ground, erecting the new pile of buildings, providing of suitable masters, and settling the endowment in trust for ever. He considers that it was begun, and even greatly advanced, <hi rend=italics>before</hi> the death of Henry VII., <datestruct VALUE="1509-04-21"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=21>21st</day>, <year reg=1509>1509</year></datestruct>, previous to which it is actually placed by Alexander Nevile;<NOTE N="c"><P><num value="24">24th</num> Henry VII. &ldquo;In this year, <datestruct value="1508"><year reg="1508">1508</year></datestruct>, John Colet erected his costly and magnificent School in that part of the churchyard of the Cathedral which looks towards the east.

<P>The account by Erasmus above referred to is the best and most interesting description of Dean Colet's School, since the writer was in England at the period of its completion, and living in the greatest familiarity with the Founder. It is contained in a Latin epistle to Jodocus Jonas, from which the following extract is translated. &mdash;&ldquo;Upon the death of the father of Colet, when by right of inheritance he was possessed of a considerable sum of money, lest the keeping of it should corrupt his mind and turn it too much to the world, he laid out a great part of it in building a new School in the Churchyard of St. Paul, dedicated to the Child Jesus; a magnificent fabric: to which he added <num value="2">two</num> handsome dwelling-houses for the <num value="2">two</num> several masters, to whom he assigned ample salaries, that they might teach a certain number of boys gratuitously. He divided the School into <num value="4">four</num> apartments. The <num value="1">first</num> is the porch or entrance for <hi rend=italics>Catechumens</hi>, (or children to be instructed in the principles of religion); and no child is admitted there, unless he can already read and write. The <num value="2">second</num> apartment is for the lower boys, who are taught by the <hi rend=italics>Hypodidasculus</hi>, (or usher). The <num value="3">third</num> is for those who are more learned, (under the head-master). Which former parts of the School are divided from the other by a curtain, which can be drawn or undrawn at pleasure. Over the Master's chair is seated a figure of the Child Jesus, of excellent work, in the act of teaching; whom all the assembly, both at coming in and going out of school salute with a short hymn.<NOTE N="e"><P>The following is the address above referred to, which will be found in the original Latin in &ldquo;Dean Colet's Institution of a Christian Man, for the use of his School, prefixed to the Rudiments of the Latin Tongue.&rdquo; Knight's &ldquo;Life of Colet,&rdquo; Append. No. xi. p. <num value="446">446</num>, entitled, &ldquo;A little Prayer to the Child Jesus presiding in the School.&mdash;O my most sweet Lord Jesus, who, whilst as yet a child in the <num value="12">twelfth</num> year of thine age, didst so discourse with the doctors in the Temple at Jerusalem as that they all marvelled with amazement at thy super-excellent wisdom; I beseech thee that in this thy School, by the tutors and patrons whereof I am daily taught in letters and instruction,&mdash;I may be enabled chiefly to know thee, O Jesus, who art thyself the only true wisdom; and afterwards to have knowledge both to worship and to imitate thee: and also in this brief life so to walk in the way of thy doctrine, following in thy footsteps, that as thou hast attained unto glory, I also, in departing out of this life, may through thy grace happily arrive at some part thereof. Amen.&rdquo;&mdash;Beside this prayer, in conformity with the <num value="1">first</num> wish of the Founder, Erasmus composed a short poem in Iambic verse, &ldquo;to signify the choice and preference of the Divine Protector and Governor of the School;&rdquo; which appears to have been hung up in the Proscholion, together with a Sapphic ode &ldquo;imploring the Divine aid and success to this new foundation, and expressing the design of it to be for the institution of boys in the Greek and Latin tongues, and the principles of religion.&rdquo; Copier of these verses are given in Knight's &ldquo;Life of Colet,&rdquo; pp. <num value="140">140</num>-<num value="143">143</num>, notes. Erasmus likewise composed an Oration in Latin, also connected with the same subject, entitled &ldquo;Desiderii Erasmi Roterodami Concio de Pvero Jesv, olim pronvnciata &agrave; Pvero in Schol&acirc; Johannis Coleti Londini Institvt&acirc;; in qv&acirc; pr&aelig;sidebat Imago Pveri Jesu docentis specie;&rdquo; which will be found printed in his Works, Vol. v. col. <num value="559">559</num>-<num value="560">560</num>; and in Knight's &ldquo;Life of Colet,&rdquo; pp. <num value="338">338</num>-<num value="356">356</num>.

All children are not to be admitted as a matter of course, but to be selected according to their parts and capacities. The most sagacious Founder saw that the greatest hopes and happiness of the commonwealth were in the training up of children to good letters and true religion: for which purpose he laid out an immense sum of money, and yet would not admit any <num value="1">one</num> to share in the expense. A certain person having left a legacy of <num value="100">100</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> sterling towards the fabric of the School, Colet perceived a design in it; and, by permission of the Bishop of London, procured that the money should be laid out upon the holy vestments for St. Paul's Church. When he had finished all his arrangements, be left the perpetual care and government of the establishment, not to the clergy, not to the Bishop, not to the Chapter, as it is called, nor to nobles,&mdash;but to certain <hi rend=italics>married</hi> citizens,<NOTE N="a"><P>The impure celibacy of the monastic orders having brought them into very general disrepute, long before the time of Erasmus, he takes occasion to commend the wisdom and honesty of Dean Colet's adoption of married men for the guardians of this School; in his remarks on seminaries, &amp;c., contained in the learned and elaborate &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Dialogue de Rect&acirc; Latini Gr&aelig;cique sermonis Pronunciatione</hi>,&rdquo; between Ursus and Leo.&mdash;&ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Ursus.</hi> In like manner John Colet, a man eternally worthy of memory, in that school for children which he annexed to the Church of St. Paul, considered nothing with more labour than to whom should be committed the completion of this affair. The Bishops held the matter unworthy of their solicitude. As for Scholars themselves receiving the authority, they were rather inclined to arbitrary government than to take care of the school: and he had himself observed even the duty of the Schoolmaster was best discharged where he was not severe. In the Colleges of Secular Canons the greater part of them was almost always of the worst sort; and in Magistrates either judgment was wanting, or else they indulged in private favour. <hi rend=italics>Leo.</hi> What counsellors then did he at length discover? <hi rend=italics>Ursus.</hi>

A <num value="3">third</num> boy follows holding a rude flag, said to be decorated with the figure of a staff used for throwing at cocks. The date of this illumination is stated to be A. D. <datestruct value="1433"><year reg="1433">1433</year></datestruct>. Shrove Tuesday was the principal time when school boys claimed the diversion of cock-fighting; and on the morning of that day those of London were accustomed to bring game-cocks to their masters, and were permitted to amuse themselves till dinner time by seeing them fight in the school-room. Fitz-Stephen, &ldquo;Descriptio Nobilissim&aelig; Civitas Lundoni&aelig;, pp. <num value="45">45</num>, <num value="74">74</num>. The abolition of this practice was worthy of the good sense and humanity of Colet. 
<P>The Public disputations at the feast of St. Bartholomew, <datestruct VALUE="-08-24"><month reg="08">Aug.</month> <day reg=24>24th</day></datestruct>, were doubtless the remains of a similar custom mentioned by Fitz-Stephen in the reign of Henry II. &ldquo;On festivals,&rdquo; says that author, &ldquo;at those churches where the feast of the patron-saint is solemnized, the masters convene their scholars. The youth on those occasions dispute; some in the demonstrative way, and some logically. These produce their enthymemes, and those the more perfect syllogisms. Some the better to shew their parts, are exercised in disputation, contending with <num value="1">one</num> another; whilst others are put upon establishing some truth by way of illustration. Some sophists endeavoured to apply a vast number and flow of words, others to impose upon you with false conclusions. As to the orators, some with their rhetorical harangues employ all the powers of persuasion, taking care to observe the principles of art, and to omit nothing apposite to the subject. The boys of different schools wrangle with each other in verse, contending about the principles of grammar, or the rules of the perfect tenses and supines. Others there are who in epigrams or other compositions in numbers, use all that low ribaldry we read of in the ancients; attacking their schoolmasters, but without mentioning names, with the old fescennine licentious verses, and discharging their scoffs and sarcasms against them, touching the foibies of their school-fellows with a true Socratic wit, or biting them more keenly with a Leonine tooth. The audience fully disposed to laugh&mdash;with curling nose ingeminate the peals. Pers. iii. <num value="87">87</num>.&rdquo; Descriptio Nobiliss. Civitat. Lundoni&aelig;, pp. <num value="31">31</num>, <num value="63">63</num>. Of these meetings and disputations, Stow observes in <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>, that the same had been long since discontinued, though the arguing of schoolboys about the principles of grammar, was retained till even his time. &ldquo;For I myself in my youth,&rdquo; adds he, probably referring to about the year <datestruct value="1535"><year reg="1535">1535</year></datestruct>, &ldquo;have yearly seen, on the Eve of St. Bartholomew the Apostle, the scholars of divers grammar-schools repair unto the churchyard of St. Bartholomew, the Priory in Smithfield, where, upon a bank boarded about under a tree, some <num value="1">one</num> scholar hath stepped up and there hath opposed and answered till he were by some better scholar overcome and put down: and then the overcomer taking the place did like as the hrst; and in the end the best opposers and answerers had rewards, which <num value="1">1</num> observed not. But it made good schoolmasters, and also good scholars, diligently against such times to prepare themselves for the obtaining of this garland.&rdquo; It appears that at this period the above part of the statutes of St. Paul's school, prohibiting the scholars disputing at St. Bartholomew's was disregarded; since Stow mentions it as <num value="1">one</num> of the free-schools attending those exercises; unless it may be supposed that he refers to the <hi rend=italics>ancient</hi> St. Paul's School attached to the Cathedral. The best scholars, he adds, were those of St. Anthony's Hospital in Threadneedle Street, and they were rewarded as such by Sir Martin Bowes with silver bows and arrows, when he attempted to revive the Bartholomew disputations in the reign of Edward VI. Between the boys of these schools, there existed in consequence a curious sort of rivalry which frequently led to less ceremonious but more characteristic discussions than those above described. &ldquo;The scholars of Paul's,&rdquo; says Stow, &ldquo;meeting with them of St. Anthony's, would call &lsquo;them St. Anthony's Pigs,&rsquo; and they again would call the others &lsquo;Pigeons of Paul's;&rsquo; because many pigeons were bred in Paul's Church, and St. Anthony was always figured with a pig following him: and, mindful of the former usage, they did for a long season disorderly in the open street provoke <num value="1">one</num> another with &lsquo;Salve;&rsquo; &lsquo;Salve, tu quoque.&rsquo; &lsquo;Placet tibi mecum disputare?&rsquo; &lsquo;Placet.&rsquo; And so proceeding from this to questions in grammar, they usually fell from words to blows with their satchels full of books; many times in so great heaps that they troubled the streets and passengers: so that finally they were restrained with the decay of St. Anthony's School.&rdquo; Strype's Stow's &ldquo;Survey of London,&rdquo; Vol. I. book i. chap. xxii. pp. <num value="123">123</num>, <num value="124">124</num>.</NOTE> and not to have any Remedyes, or Play-days granted by the Master, under a penalty of <num value="40">40</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>, unless desired by the King, an Archbishop, or a Bishop in person.

possessed of a good voice for singing, and a comely figure, was anciently elected to receive the dress, state, and title of a bishop; wearing a mitre and crosier, and exercising canonical authority over his companions, who were dressed as priests: whence he was called Episcopus Puerorum, Bishop of the Boys or the Boy Bishop. They took possession of the church and performed all ceremonies and offices, which might be performed by a Bishop and his Prebendaries, sometimes even including the mass itself: the statutes of Eton College, given A. D. <datestruct value="1441"><year reg="1441">1441</year></datestruct>, order that the Episcopus Puerorum shall perform divine service on St. Nicholas day, though by no means on that of the Holy Innocents; whilst the statutes of Winchester College, given A. D. <datestruct value="1380"><year reg="1380">1380</year></datestruct>, state that the &ldquo;pueri,&rdquo; namely the Bishop and other boys, are permitted on the latter festival to perform all sacred offices in the chapel, according to the use of the Church of Sarum. This remarkable ceremony was particularly practised in Salisbury Cathedral, and in the statutes belonging to it there is a chapter &ldquo;De Episcopo Choristorum;&rdquo; as well as a long and minute account of it in the Processionale of the same church.&mdash;<num value="1">One</num> of the Boy-Bishops of that Cathedral is supposed to have died during his time of office, and to have been buried in his pontifical robes, as appears by the monumental effigy of a youth preserved there, dressed in the habit of a bishop. It is not known at what period this ceremony was <num value="1">first</num> practised, but it was prohibited by proclamation <datestruct VALUE="1543-07-22"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=22>22nd</day>, <year reg=1543>1543</year></datestruct>, the <num value="33">33rd</num> year of Henry VIII.

On the Eve of St. Nicholas, <datestruct VALUE="-12-5"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=5>5th</day></datestruct>, Bonner issued another ordinance directing that St. Nicholas should not be carried about; because Cardinal Pole had summoned a convocation of the Bishops and Clergy to meet at Lambeth on the following day. The festival, however, was observed in London by the parishes of St. Andrew, Holborn, and St. Nicholas Olave, in Bread Street. It was held again in <datestruct value="1555--"><year reg="1555">1555</year></datestruct>, <datestruct value="1556--"><year reg="1556">1556</year></datestruct>, and <datestruct value="1557--"><year reg="1557">1557</year></datestruct>; but after the accession of Elizabeth it appears to have been wholly disused.&mdash;&ldquo;The history of English Poetry,&rdquo; by Thomas Warton, London. <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>, <num value="8">8</num>vo. vols. ii. p. <num value="82">82</num>. iii. pp. <num value="215">215</num>- <num value="217">217</num>. iv. pp. <num value="127">127</num>, <num value="146">146</num>-<num value="148">148</num>.&mdash;&ldquo;Historical Memorials&rdquo; of Ecclesiastical and Civil Events in England under Mary I. by the Rev.

<P>There are some curious notices extant concerning the Boy Bishop connected with St. Paul's Cathedral. In the inventory of the vestments, &amp;c. belonging to it appear&mdash;&ldquo;Item, <num value="1">one</num> white mitre embroidered with little flowers, the gift of John Belemaynes for the performance of the Bishop of the little boys.&mdash;Item, a staff, the head and pomel of which are of gilded copper, set about with many and divers images: assigned to the use of the Bishop of the children.&rdquo; Dugdale's &ldquo;Hist. of St. Paul's,&rdquo; pp. <num value="315">315</num>, <num value="316">316</num>. In the old statutes of the Cathedral there appear many orders concerning this ceremony, <num value="1">one</num> of which is that the Canon called Stagiarius shall find the Boy Bishop his robes and a fair horse. There is also a book bearing the following title, &ldquo;The Song of the Chyld-Bysshop, as it was songe before the Queenes Maiestie in her priuie chamber at her manour of Saynt James in the ffeeldesh on Saynt Nicholas day and Innocents day this yeare, now present by the Chyld Bysshope of Poule's Churche with his company.

It cannot be doubted however, that in ordering the observance of this ceremony by his scholars, he was guided by the same principle which induced him to place the school under the patronage of the Child Jesus: the exhibiting to them an example with which youth and schoolboys might peculiarly sympathise. St. Nicholas, whom the Boy Bishop was designed to celebrate, was the patron of children and of scholars, and was considered at the time to be an eminent instance of early piety; since his legends relate that even in his cradle he observed the fasts of the Church, by sucking only once on Wednesdays and Fridays. From a layman he rose to be Bishop of Myra, in Lycia, and died in A.D. <datestruct value="343"><year reg="343">343</year></datestruct>: and says Knight, &ldquo;I shall only remark that there might this at least be said in favour of the old customs that it gave a spirit to the children; and the hopes that they might some time or other attain to the <hi rend=italics>real</hi> mitre, made them mind their books.&rdquo;</NOTE>

The direction that the children of St. Paul's School shall &ldquo;not sing out&rdquo; when walking in these processions, appears to be almost synonymous with an order in the monastic rule of St. Dunstan, that convents should proceed to morning mass &ldquo;silently psalmodising;&rdquo; which referred to the rule that in whatever occupation a religious person was engaged, a psalm was always to be in the mouth or the thoughts; the psalms being also particularly learned by children. &ldquo;British Monachism,&rdquo; by the Rev.

<P>A very important and interesting feature in the history of St. Paul's School, is the production of those excellent elementary works which were composed expressly for the scholars of this establishment; some of which are still retained in use in almost their original forms. The <num value="1">first</num> of these was the well-known book by Colet himself, of the Rudiments of Latin Grammar, with an abridgement of the principles of religion as taught in the School; in which, says Strype, he put those <num value="1">first</num> rudiments into an easier and apter method for learning than any were before:<NOTE N="b"><P>The ancient grammars which were in general use from the <num value="6">sixth</num> to the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, were chiefly the following. That of Aelias Donatus, grammarian of the <num value="4">fourth</num> century, the Master of St. Jerome, after whom a grammar was often called Donat: the &ldquo;Arte Grammaticia,&rdquo; &amp;c. of Priscianua, the celebrated grammarian of the <num value="6">sixth</num> century: and the &ldquo;Doctrinate Puerorum&rdquo; of Alexander De Ville Dien, or Dolensis, so called from his birth-place at Dol, in Bretagne, who lived in the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century. The latter was written in leonine verse, and continued in general use until <datestruct value="1514--"><year reg="1514">1514</year></datestruct>, when an assembly at Malines declared that the &ldquo;Commentarii Grammatici&rdquo; of John Despaut&egrave;re, or Van Pauteren, a celebrated grammarian called the Priscian of the Netherlands, was easier and better adapted to youths. It is supposed by Wood that the <num value="1">first</num> English grammatical work of merit was that by John Holt, of Magdalen College, and Usher of Magdalen School, Oxford, entitled &ldquo;Lac Puerorum, M. Holti. Mylke for Children. Enprynted at London by Wynkyn De Worde, in flete streete at the sygne of the sonne.&rdquo; <num value="4">4</num>to. no date: It is dedicated to Morton, Archbishop of Canterbury, and preceded by some very elegant Latin verses by Sir Thomas More, to whom Holt had been tutor. This was succeeded by the grammatical works of John Stanbridge, and his scholar Robert Whyttynton, Thomas Linacre, &amp;c. It may also be proper to add to these notices, that from the <num value="11">eleventh</num> century the ordinary Latin Dictionary was the &ldquo;Elementarium Doctrin&aelig; Rudimentum,&rdquo; an alphabetical glossary by Papias, which was enlarged by Ugution and Hugh of Pisa. On these works were most probably founded the earliest printed English and Latin Dictionaries, entitled &ldquo;Promptorium Parvulorum sive Clericorum Medulla Grammatic,&rdquo; by Richard Fraunces, a preaching-friar, <num value="1">first</num> printed by Richard Pynson, <datestruct VALUE="1499-05-5"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=5>5th</day>, <year reg=1499>1499</year></datestruct>. fol.; and &ldquo;Ortus Vocabulorum: alphabetico ordine fere omnia qu&aelig; in Catholico breviloquo Cornucopia Gemma vocabulorum atque Medulla Grammatices ponuntur cum perpuleris Additoribus Ascens et Vernacul&aelig; Lingu&aelig; Anglican&aelig; expositionem continens:&rdquo; printed by Wynkyn de Worde, Westm. <datestruct value="1500--"><year reg="1500">1500</year></datestruct>, fol. The latter work consists of a short grammar and a large dictionary, containing upwards of <num value="700">700</num> pages, compiled by John Balbi, or De Genoa; and was <num value="1">first</num> printed by Gutenberg at Mentz in <datestruct value="1460--"><year reg="1460">1460</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> which he recommended in a short elegant Latin epistle to William Lily, the Master, to teach it to the children; dated from his own house the kalends (<num value="1">1st</num>) of <datestruct VALUE="1510-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1510">1510</year></datestruct>.<NOTE N="c"><P>Rudimenta Grammatices &agrave; Johanne Coleto, Decano Ecclesi&aelig; Sancti Pauli, London, in usum Scholae ab ipso institut&aelig;.

In the modern accidence is also included the English Syntax, which was composed by Lily; as appears by the title of several ancient editions, &ldquo;Gulielmi Lilii Angli Rudimenta,&rdquo; beginning &ldquo;When I have an Englyshe, &amp;c.&rdquo; Antw. <datestruct value="1530--"><year reg="1530">1530</year></datestruct>, <datestruct value="1534--"><year reg="1534">1534</year></datestruct>. <num value="12">12</num><hi rend=sub>o</hi>. Since Lily's time, however, it has been greatly improved both with regard to method and an enlargement of double the quantity. The older impressions of this book coutain Colet's epistle to Lily, the principles of the Christian religion, and the Founder's regulations for admitting children into St. Paul's School.&mdash;Wood, in his &ldquo;Athen&aelig; Oxonienses,&rdquo; vol. i. col. <num value="33">33</num>, questions if Colet were the author of these Rudiments, observing that &ldquo;this is generally said to be written by Lily; yet some there are that stick not to tell us that the said introduction was written by Dr. Colet or David Tolley. Dr. Bliss, however, rightly remarks that the work certainly was the composition of Dean Colet; which is also confirmed by the statements of Ward and Baker.</NOTE> This was succeeded by another small work also attributed to Colet, on the Construction of the <num value="8">Eight</num> Parts of Speech, and likewise presented to Lily with a Latin letter, dated from his own house, A.D. <datestruct value="1513"><year reg="1513">1513</year></datestruct>. It generally passes under the name of the Latin 
<hi rend=italics>Syntaxis</hi>, because with some alterations and great additions, it constitutes that part of the work called Lily's Grammar; but in consequence of these improvements, the name of the real author has become exceedingly doubtful. Erasmus states that Dean Colet charged Lily to amend and improve this treatise, and then return it to him, after which being desirous that it should be rendered still more perfect, he sent it to Erasmus, then perhaps the best grammatical critic in Europe, who made so many alterations in it that neither of the authors was willing to assume it for his own. It was therefore published by Erasmus in <datestruct value="1515--"><year reg="1515">1515</year></datestruct>,<NOTE N="d"><P>&ldquo;Libellus de Octo Orationis Partium Constructione.&rdquo; Paris apud Nic. Crispinum, <datestruct value="1515--"><year reg="1515">1515</year></datestruct>, <num value="8">8</num>vo.

Many of the examples of expression in this part of the Latin Grammar are historical, and refer to the public events of the period when it was composed, about the commencement of the reign of Henry VIII.: as the prosecution of Empson and Dudley for extortion, in <datestruct value="1510--"><year reg="1510">1510</year></datestruct>, &ldquo;Regum est tuere leges,&rdquo; the King is to defend the laws; &ldquo;Refert omnium animadverti in malos,&rdquo; it concerns all that the bad be punished. In other editions of the syntax the examples were also adapted to the period of the impression; as in that of <datestruct value="1520--"><year reg="1520">1520</year></datestruct>, &ldquo;Audito Regem Doroberniam proficisci,&rdquo; I hear that the King has set out to Canterbury, referring to Henry's rapid journey to that city to meet the Emperor Charles V. &ldquo;Meruit sub rege in Gallium,&rdquo; he served under the King in France; alluding to the Emperor Maximilian, being retained by Henry VIII. at <num value="100">100</num> crowns a day, and fighting under the English standard at Terouenne, in Flanders <datestruct value="1513--"><year reg="1513">1513</year></datestruct>. Similar instances are even still more numerous. In the latter edition of the Syntax by Erasmus, some of the examples related to Colet, as &ldquo;Vixit Rom&aelig;, studiit Oxoni&aelig;, natus est Londinio, discessit Londino,&rdquo; he lived at Rome, studied at Oxford, was born and died at London. In the commencement of the English Introduction also, instead of the words &ldquo;Joannes is my proper name,&rsquo; referring to Colet, the name of Prince Edward was inserted by Dr. Richard Cox, his tutor, afterwards Bishop of Ely; and &ldquo;Henricus Anglia&rdquo; placed at the beginning of the Latin part.

Yet notwithstanding this, after the book <hi rend=italics>had</hi> been submitted to the judgment of another, he had so modest a mind in the estimation of himself, that he would not have his name appear to it when it was put forth to the world.&rdquo;<NOTE N="a"><P>Georgii Lilii &ldquo;Elogia Virorum Illustrium.&rdquo; <datestruct value="1559--"><year reg="1559">1559</year></datestruct>. <num value="8">8</num>vo. p. <num value="89">89</num>.</NOTE>
It is observed by Ward, that from the time of its <num value="1">first</num> composition this Syntax has been in some degree new framed and enlarged, and soon after its publication, it was illustrated with notes by Henry Prime, the Master of a public school belonging to a monastery in Munster.<NOTE N="b"><P>&ldquo;Gymnasiarcha apud Monasteriensis Grammat.&rdquo; Edit.

<P>Lily also composed for Dean Colet's School those Latin verses usually called &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Propria qu&aelig; Maribus</hi>,&rdquo; from the commencing words, containing short rules for distinguishing the genders of nouns, which were also printed after his death, with large annotations, by Thomas Robertson,<NOTE N="c"><P>&ldquo;Annotationes in libri Gulielmi Lilii de Latine Nominibus Generibus,&rdquo; &amp;c.

</NOTE> Robertson states, however, that he either did not execute it, or did not design to publish it, and that therefore he undertook it himself, and drew up those rules which are now in use; his own edition of <datestruct value="1532--"><year reg="1532">1532</year></datestruct> being entitled &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Thom&aelig; Robertsoni, Eboracensis, De Nominibus Heteroclitis opusculum, cum Annotationibus ejusdem.</hi>&rdquo;<NOTE N="e"><P>In an edition of the grammar printed in <datestruct value="1585--"><year reg="1585">1585</year></datestruct> the author's name is inserted Rob.

Robins.: later editions, differing from all the former, have it printed Tho. Robinson, which is confirmed by William Haine in his Epistle to Lily's rules construed. The following is the full title to Robertson's Annotations on Lily.&mdash;&ldquo;Gvlielmi Lilii, olim Schol&aelig; Pavlin&aelig; apvd Londinvm Moderatoris, de Latinorvm, Nominvm Generibvs, de Verborom Pr&aelig;teritis et Svpinis; Regul&aelig; non minvs vtiles qvam compendios&aelig;, cvm Annotationibvs Thom&aelig; Robertsoni, Eboracensis.

In all these verses Knight observes that the rules were made more compendious and the lines smoother than they had been in any other system. Another Latin poem, likewise by Lily,<NOTE N="f"><P>The composition of this poem, and of even some parts of the Latin Grammar assigned to Lily, is attributed by Thomas Hearne to that John Leland, who lived in the reign of Henry VI., taught &ldquo;Literas Humaniores&rdquo; near St. Fridiswide's Church at Oxford, died and was buried there <datestruct VALUE="1428-04-29"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=29>29th</day>, <year reg=1428>1428</year></datestruct>, and was called &ldquo;Senior,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Grammaticus,&rdquo; to distinguish him from John Leland, the King's Antiquary to Henry VIII., who was born about <datestruct value="1506--"><year reg="1506">1506</year></datestruct>. The following is a translation of the passage referred to, taken from Hearne's Pr&aelig;fatio to the &ldquo;Chronicon sive Annales Prioratus de Dunstaple,&rdquo; Oxf. <datestruct value="1733--"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>. <num value="8">8</num>vo. vol. i. p. lvii.; when speaking of Prior Richard de Morinus, who died A.D. <datestruct value="1244"><year reg="1244">1244</year></datestruct>.&mdash;&ldquo;Nor should any think that Richard spent all his care in vain in being thus vigilant, and troubling himself with so many labours in France for the benefit of children; since, in my estimation at least, to him should be attributed the method of teaching grammar usurped by us in England, which then became so very much obscured as to be almost lost; until a long time afterward John Leland, surnamed &ldquo;Grammaticus,&rdquo;&mdash;(a most sagacious man, and sufficiently learned in Latin literature for his time, whom our greatest personages of Oxford regard with admiration,)&mdash;for a great while applied the grammatical rules more commodiously to the understanding and capacities of children, a good part of which were approved by William Lily himself; <hi rend=italics>who also altered Leland's Admonitions of a Schoolmaster, and then published them as if they had been his own: just as if the works of others could be made to appear ours.</hi> This is moreover to be seen in certain ancient remains in our libraries; of which the Bodleian ought in justice to be enumerated. These Admonitions have been retained in the latest and most accurate editions of Lily's Grammar, and they should not be laid aside, since the youth of these our times have greatly degenerated, for evil customs will pervert nature itself. Those who esteem that Grammar to be the best work for preceptors, (who should learn as well as teach, and refrain themselves as well as restrain others)&mdash;allege that none <hi rend=italics>can</hi> be either greater or better because it had the bounty of the state, and was the best a long time ago: but Marcus Tullius Cicero has declared, whatever certain Tully-haters may think of it, that there would appear to be some particular gift of Providence for every generation and being, that all to the utmost of their power should strive after the perfection of eloquence.&rdquo; &mdash;A list of the grammatical works attributed to Leland will be found in the Rev. William Huddesford's &ldquo;Lives of those eminent Antiquaries, John Leland, Thomas Hearne, and Anthony &agrave; Wood;&rdquo; Oxf. <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>. <num value="8">8</num>vo. vol. i. pp. <num value="2">2</num>, <num value="109">109</num>:&mdash;taken from a MS. volume belonging to Worcester Cathedral, No. <num value="798">798</num>, p. <num value="19">19</num>.

That part of the Latin Syntax &ldquo;De Figuris,&rdquo; was taken by Erasmus partly from Peter Mosellanus, as to the verbal figures; and partly from Gerard Listrius, a learned physician, his friend, as to the figures of construction, with some alterations: and in some of the older editions of the Latin Grammar those parts have the names of their respective authors attached.<NOTE N="g"><P>&ldquo;Tabul&aelig; Schematibus et Tropis Petri Mosellani.&rdquo; Antw. <datestruct value="1529--"><year reg="1529">1529</year></datestruct>.

<P>Such were the several parts of the celebrated work usually called Lily's Grammar, most of which were originally published in separate editions either in London or abroad, before the work received the King's sanction for general use. There were in England contemporaneous with Lily several persons celebrated for their scholastic learning and their works on philological literature; as John Holt, John Stanbridge, Robert Whyttynton, created Doctor of Grammar and Rhetoric at Oxford, William Horman, Thomas Linacre, &amp;c. and their many and various compositions, with others in previous use, caused a great diversity in the books employed for teaching. The preference and esteem, however, in which the Grammer of Lily was held, was very early shewn by a letter from Cardinal Wolsey to the Master of his Free-School founded at Ipswich in <datestruct value="1528--"><year reg="1528">1528</year></datestruct>, recommending the use of Lily's rules.<NOTE N="c"><P>&ldquo;Rudimenta Grammatices, et docendi methodus, non tam Scol&aelig; Gypswichian&aelig;, per Reverend.

Sept.&rdquo; (<num value="1">1st</num>.) &ldquo;We suppose,&rdquo; says Wolsey, in noticing Lily's improvements in teaching, &ldquo;that it is unknown to none how great an effort of the mind is study, to which our diligence should be always directed; not for our own private benefits, but for that of the state and nation which should be chiefly consulted by us in all our labours.&rdquo; The establishment at Ipswich was divided into <num value="8">eight</num> classes similar to that of Dean Colet, and the Cardinal therefore adds, &ldquo;which order should be used for teaching the children who have been admitted into our school, and in reading to them the same authors. These rudiments will also be easily explained in it, and the children imbued therewith; for it greatly concerns us to be established under the best kind of government. In this way, then, proceed, to illustrate the most graceful studies, and deserve well of your country.&rdquo;</NOTE> At length, says the Address to the Reader prefixed to the English Introduction, &ldquo;the diuersitie of grammars is well and profitably taken awaie by the King's Maiestie's wisedome, who, foreseeing the inconvenience and favourably providing the remedie, caused <num value="1">one</num> kind of grammar, by sundrie learned men to be diligently drawn, and so to be set out, only everywhere to be taught, for the use of learners and for the hurt in changing of schoolemaisters.&rdquo; &ldquo;This seems,&rdquo; adds Ward, &ldquo;to be what is meant by Sir Thomas Elyot when speaking of that Prince (Henry VIII.), he sais that he hath not himself disdained to be the chiefe authour and setter-forthe of an Introduction into grammar for the childrene of his louing subiectes.&rdquo; The time when this work was completed has been differently related by writers; Thomas Hayne places it in the year <datestruct value="1543"><year reg="1543">1543</year></datestruct>, and Anthony &agrave; Wood in <datestruct value="1545--"><year reg="1545">1545</year></datestruct>.

Fuller adds that &ldquo;a stipend of <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> a year was allowed the King's Printer for printing the grammar, and that it was penal to teach any other.

Append.</NOTE> As the right of printing the authorised Grammar was given by royal license to certain proprietors, the patentees being desirous of improving the work solicited Dr. John Ward, Professor of Rhetoric in Gresham College, to prepare a new and accurate edition of it for publication. For this purpose, he states that they &ldquo;collected together a great number of different <pb id="p.85" n="85"> editions, printed at London, Oxford, Cambridge, and in Ireland, with several others containing particular parts of it, as they were published before the whole was brought into its present form.&rdquo; All these were carefully collated, and several corrupted passages rectified by them, and in <datestruct value="1732--"><year reg="1732">1732</year></datestruct> appeared the <num value="1">first</num> improved edition by Ward, with an extremely curious Preface, containing an historical and bibliographical account of the Grammar itself, and the various editions through which it had passed. 
<P>Another work, which was dedicated from its <num value="1">first</num> appearance to St. Paul's School, and which was long retained there, is the <hi rend=italics>Copia Verborum</hi> of Erasmus, who in an expostulary epistle to Colet gives an account of the manner in which he disposed of it to him. Walking <num value="1">one</num> day with him in his garden, Erasmus spake of the great pains he had bestowed upon <num value="2">two</num> books <hi rend=italics>De Copia Verborum et Rerum</hi>, to form the style and assist the invention of young scholars; upon which the Dean asked him to dedicate them to the School at St. Paul's. Erasmus, however, declined, saying that the establishment was too poor to pay for them, and he required a patron with some money, since he had been at considerable cost in books, transcribers, &amp;c., to which Colet replied that he was unable to afford him an adequate recompense for his labours, but that he would willingly give him <num value="15">fifteen</num> angels (<num value="5">5</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="12">12</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>); and upon repeating the offer Erasmus accepted of it. Some time intervening between this agreement and the publication of the book, it appears that Colet forgot the agreement, and that the author recalled it to his memory by a humorous Latin letter; to which the Dean returned a very grave answer. He stated that he was indeed indebted to Erasmus, for that he owed him his whole self; though he remembered no such promise as that claimed of him: that his funds were then very low on account of his great expense about the School; and that he had not leisure to recollect himself. Erasmus replied by acknowledging the favours of Colet, modestly palliating his claim, and stating also the particular time and place when it was made; and soliciting payment as earnestly as he could for that which he would not call a debt, but a very seasonable bounty to him. He intimates also, that some friends of Colet thought him a little too frugal; which, if it were a fault, did not arise from any tenacious avarice in him, but diffidence; since he could not deny some confident petitioners, and was therefore unable to gratify those who deserved better of him. Colet now appears to have immediately satisfied Erasmus, who addressed the work to him in a very elegant Latin letter, dated London, the <num value="3">3rd</num> of the Calends of May (<datestruct VALUE="-04-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>), <datestruct value="1512--"><year reg="1512">1512</year></datestruct>.<NOTE N="a"><P>Knight's &ldquo;Life of Colet,&rdquo; pp. <num value="148">148</num>&mdash;<num value="151">151</num>.&mdash;&ldquo;Desiderii Erasmi Roterodami De Duplici Copia Verborum ac Rerum Commentarii Duo; ad Authore ipso aucti:&rdquo; Argent. <datestruct value="1516--"><year reg="1516">1516</year></datestruct>. <num value="4">4</num>to.

Dr. Knight observes that the name was afterwards adopted for that system of religious doctrine formed by the Convocation in the commencement of the Reformation, and approved by Henry VIII. called <hi rend=italics>The Institution of a Christian Man;</hi> from the title anciently given to any little abridgment of the principles of religion.<NOTE N="b"><P>Knight's &ldquo;Life of Colet,&rdquo; pp. <num value="143">143</num>&mdash;<num value="145">145</num>. Erasmus attributes this work almost entirely to Dean Colet in <num value="2">two</num> of his epistles, and states that he had only put it into verse in a plain and simple manner, speaking of it as a trifle, though valuable in the benefit which it might be of to youth. The Latin and English versions are both printed in the Appendix to the same work, No. xi. pp. <num value="442">442</num>-<num value="460">460</num>. &ldquo;Erasmi Opera,&rdquo; vol. v. cols. <datestruct value="1357--"><year reg="1357">1357</year></datestruct>&mdash;<datestruct value="1359--"><year reg="1359">1359</year></datestruct>. The summary of religious instruction referred to by Dr. Knight was very similar to that of Erasmus, and was called &ldquo;The godly and pious Institution of a Christen man, counteynyne the Exposition or Interpretation of the commune Crede of the Seuen Sacramentes, of the X Commandements, and of the Pater Noster, and the Aue Maria, Justification and purgatory.&rdquo; It was drawn up by the Bishops in <datestruct value="1534--"><year reg="1534">1534</year></datestruct>, and was printed by Thomas Berthelet in <datestruct value="1557--"><year reg="1557">1557</year></datestruct> in <num value="4">4</num>to. and <num value="8">8</num>vo.</NOTE> It may be properly noticed in this place that St. Paul's School was further indebted to Erasmus for procuring it the services of John Ritwyse, the <num value="1">first</num> Sur-Master, whom he found at King's College, Cambridge, when Colet desired him to find him an usher, and whom he solicited and encouraged to undertake the office.<NOTE N="c"><P>Knight's &ldquo;Life of Colet,&rdquo; pp. <num value="167">167</num>, <num value="169">169</num>.</NOTE>

<P>There are but very few particulars extant descriptive of the appearance of the original building erected for this School. In mentioning the establishment of seminaries in London, Stow observes that as divers of them became decayed by the suppression of those religious houses of which they were members, in the reign of Henry VIII., others were newly erected and founded instead of them. &ldquo;As, namely, Paul's School, in place of an old ruined house, was builded in the most ample manner and largely endowed in the year <datestruct value="1512"><year reg="1512">1512</year></datestruct>, by John Colet, Doctor of Divinity and Dean of St. Paul's.&rdquo;<NOTE N="d"><P>&ldquo;Strype's Stow's Survey of London,&rdquo; vol. <num value="1">1</num>, book i. chap. xxii. p. <num value="124">124</num>.</NOTE> The Rev. John Strype, however, who acknowledges with gratitude his education in this School, gives some interesting particulars of its appearance before the Great Fire, and states that it was &ldquo;built up again much after the same manner and proportion as it was before.&rdquo;<NOTE N="e"><P>Ibid. Vol. I. book i. chap. xxv. p. <num value="167">167</num>. &ldquo;From this school,&rdquo; says Strype, p. <num value="164">164</num>, &ldquo;I was sent to Cambridge; having had my education there by the good providence of God for nearly the space of <num value="6">six</num> years: and therefore it will be pardoned to my public gratitude to that place, if I insist a little longer in my declaration of the <num value="1">first</num> founding of it, and of matters relating thereto.&rdquo; Knight, in his &ldquo;Life of Colet,&rdquo; p. <num value="109">109</num>, note z, also observes that, &ldquo;the new school was built according to the ancient model, though much more magnificently; but his testimony is not of equal value with that of Strype, though he was likewise a scholar of the same institution; since Dr. Knight died <datestruct VALUE="1746-12-10"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=10>10th</day>, <year reg=1746>1746</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="72">72</num>, and consequently had never seen the ancient school; whilst Strype was born <datestruct VALUE="1643-11-1"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=1>1st</day>, <year reg=1643>1643</year></datestruct>, and died <datestruct VALUE="1737-12-11"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=11>11th</day>, <year reg=1737>1737</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> &ldquo;The Founder,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;delighted in Inscriptions and Mottoes, which he appointed to be set up in several parts and places of the School, as short and pithy intimations of his mind and intentions, which were all there remaining <hi rend=italics>before</hi> the Great Fire. Over the windows on the outside towards the street, were these words engraved in great capital letters SCHOLA CATECHIZATIONIS PVERORUM, IN CHRISTI OPT. MAX. FIDE ET BONIS LITERIS. Over the school door was INGRE- DERE VT PROFICIAS. Upon each window on the inside were to be read these words painted on the glass, AVT DOCE, AVT DISCE, AVT DISCEDE, suggesting to both scholar and teacher their duty or doom; which I remember the Upper-Master in my time used often to inculcate upon such scholars as were idle or negligent, <hi rend=italics>Either learn or</hi>
<pb id="p.86" n="86">

<P>But this figure was destroyed with the School in the Great Fire, yet was afterwards found in the rubbish by a curious man and searcher into the City antiquities: who observed and told me that it was cast and hollow, by a curious art now lost.&rdquo;<NOTE N="d"><P>The authority on which this information was given is stated by Strype in the margin to be that of John Bagford, the antiquary, who has also in other places referred to the execution of figures, &amp;c. in terra-cotta, the material of which Colet's bust is made, as a lost art. A more particular notice of it likewise from Bagford, with a reference to that bust, occurs in the following passage from Strype's &ldquo;Life of John Stowe,&rdquo; prefixed to the &ldquo;Survey of London,&rdquo; in describing his monumental effigy, Vol. I. p. xiv. &ldquo;This figure of Stow, which seems to be stone, I have been told by an ingenious person in antiquities, to be nothing else but clay burnt; a fine art known and practised in former times. Of this sort there were several effigies in churches before the Great Fire. <num value="1">One</num> of these was the head of Dr. Colet, set up both in St. Paul's Church, whereof he was Dean, and in his school hard by, founded by him, which I well remember, since I was a scholar there divers years before the Fire. But now there be scarcely any remainders of that kind, excepting this of Stow, standing in a Church that escaped the spreading conflagration Anno <datestruct value="1666"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, wherein so many churches were destroyed.&rdquo; The art of modelling in terra-cotta, or baked clay, appears to have been extensively practised in England from the end of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> to the middle of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, and &ldquo;bakyn images of erthe&rdquo; of kneeling angels bearing the emblems of the crucifixion, a dead Christ coloured, and histories of the Nativity and Resurrection, were ordered by Henry VII. to be exhibited on all festival days upon the altar in his Chapel at Westminster. In the beautiful gate erected at Whitehall, after the design of Hans Holbein, for Henry VIII., were several busts in terra-cotta, painted and gilt, <num value="3">three</num> of which are considered to have represented Henry VII., Henry VIII. at the age of <num value="16">sixteen</num>, and John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester; they are supposed to have been modelled by Torregiano, who executed those for the Chapel of Henry VII. Another curious instance of the ancient use of this material in England is shewn in a very beautiful moulding, supposed to have been executed in a mould in the time of Edward the Confessor, found in the old Palace at Westminster. &ldquo;Antiquities of Westminster,&rdquo; by the late J.

The remainder of the design, which is of the same height in the wings and intermediate parts of the building, is divided into <num value="3">three</num> stories, the lowermost being also rusticated and containing entrances and windows, and the upper story having windows only; above which an entablature carried from the portico and blocking-course, with acroteria over the wings, completes the elevation. The back part of the building in the Old &lsquo;Change is of brick, with stone ornaments, and also consists of a centre and wings, surmounted by a pediment, and having the ground-floor open. The interior of the school itself is handsomely fittedup, and contains <num value="3">three</num> tiers of seats on each side, with <num value="4">four</num> desks in the centre for the Masters. Above each of the doors of entrance is inscribed the Founder's original motto DISCE AUT DISCEDE, and the ceiling is carved and panelled, with a large and handsome flower in the centre.

<p><figure id="fig.2.90.1" n="2000.66.0039"><head>Megg's Alms Houses.</head></figure>
 
<P>The Almshouses built and endowed by William Meggs, Esq. in the year <datestruct value="1658"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>, are situated in the Whitechapel Road on the south side. The building is on a moderate, or rather contracted scale, and exhibits but <num value="3">three</num> external entrances, and but <num value="1">one</num> story in height; containing <num value="9">nine</num> windows to each floor in front; over the uppermost of which, in the centre, are placed the Founder's arms, carved in stone, agreeably to the tenor of his will. To each of these Houses is attached a small garden; but since their <num value="1">first</num> erection the buildings altogether have been repaired, improved, and further endowed by Benjamin Goodwin, Esq. formerly of Saint Edmond Bury, and many years an inhabitant of this parish, anno <datestruct value="1767"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>; from which improved state our view is correctly drawn. 
<P>Although Mr. Meggs caused these Houses to be built in <datestruct value="1658--"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>, it does not appear he had entirely made up his mind as to the intended extent of endowment until <num value="17">seventeen</num> years afterwards; and even then, as himself states, he had altered his intention as to the power of placing poor people in them. 
<P>By his will, which is dated A.D. <datestruct value="1675"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, he bequeaths <datestruct value="1200--"><year reg="1200">1200</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> to be laid out in the purchase of land for their maintenance. The inmates are to receive <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> per week, and a sack of coals each at Christmas: the residue of the rents is directed to be laid out in repairs. <hi rend=italics>The persons to be chosen</hi> into these Houses are described in his will, &ldquo;decayed inhabitants of this Upper Hamlet of Whitechapel; and my mind and will is, that none but single persons shall inhabit or dwell in any of the said Houses, nor any more than <num value="1">one</num> person in each room, nor any under the age of <num value="50">fifty</num> years at the least, nor any person that shall not frequent the church to hear divine service at the usual times of assembling, according to the laudable custom of the Church of England, nor any persons that are vagrants, beggars, or such as receive pensions of the parish; but only such decayed householders as are fit to partake of such a charitable gift.&rdquo; 
<P>The choice of persons, for the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="10">ten</num> years after his decease, rests with his executors (the Rector and Churchwardens recommending): after this period it is to rest with the Rector and Vestrymen of the Upper Hamlet of Whitechapel; yet &ldquo;none is to be admitted without the approbation and consent of the Rector.&rdquo; 
<P>Thinking that the above bequeathed <datestruct value="1200--"><year reg="1200">1200</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> would be insufficient for the support of these Houses, in a codicil he orders <num value="300">300</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> to be added to the <datestruct value="1200--"><year reg="1200">1200</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> and to be laid out in the purchase of land. He increases the allowance from <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> to <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence, and directs a greater quantity of coals to be given. And his regard for the poor people is thus farther expressed: &ldquo;This being done, if there shall be an overplus of rent, the said to be for the repair of the said Almshouses, when need shall be, or the further and better relief of any of the said poor people, that should lie sick and weak at any time: my hope is, that my executor will have a great care in performing my mind and will herein for the relief and comfort of these poor people; for it is my mind and will they should be well provided for; and, although I did never affect vain glory, yet I think it not amiss, soon after my decease, that my executor should cause a stone to be set up under my arms, where there is a place left for it to be engraven and cut, declaring whose gift it is, and what maintenance is left.&rdquo; 
<P>In a sheet written with his own hand, and added as a codicil to his will, dated <datestruct VALUE="1677-02--"><month reg="02">February</month> <year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>, he says, &ldquo;I have altered my mind as to that point (i. e. the power of placing poor people into the Almshouses), and do hereby declare my mind, that my nephew, William Goulston, whom I have made my executor, with advice of counsel, shall have full power to purchase land for the said sum of <datestruct value="1500--"><year reg="1500">1500</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> and to order and appoint all things touching the same, the placing and appointing what poor shall come in upon the <pb id="p.92" n="92"> death of any of the said poor people; of whose Christian care in this charitable work I doubt not in the least, as he will answer to God the contrary of not performing my mind and meaning herein.&rdquo; 
<P>This nephew William Goulston (or <hi rend=italics>Sir</hi> William, as he is afterwards called) seems to have little regarded this solemn injunction of his uncle, and to have ill performed his trust. For the execution of the will and codicils was resisted by the Goulstons, and the business thrown into Chancery. The Lord Keeper decreed that the will and codicil be performed by the defendants Goulstons, and land be purchased. He also decreed that the Rector and Churchwardens should have the nomination of the poor people, and the defendant Goulston and his heirs, the approval. 
<P>From some cause, not now to be ascertained, this decree was never carried fully into effect. No land was ever purchased, and the only remains of <datestruct value="1500--"><year reg="1500">1500</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> at present is <datestruct value="1300--"><year reg="1300">1300</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> South Sea Annuities, payable at the Accomptant General's office. 
<P>Such a sum as this was, being altogether unequal to the maintenance and repair of the Houses, they of course soon became a heap of ruins. But in the year <datestruct value="1767"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>, Benjamin Goodwin rebuilt them, and bestowed <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="3">3</num> per cent. reduced, for their better support; and <num value="100">100</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="3">3</num> per cent. reduced, the interest to be laid out in coals.

<P>The London Workhouse (of which a slight mention has been made in the account of Sir Paul Pindar's House) is a large brick building, situated near the south-east corner of Half Moon Alley, in Bishopsgate Street Without; and is supposed to have been built on what formerly constituted part of the premises of the liberal and wealthy owner of that mansion.<NOTE N="*"><P>See statement in the Acts of Common Council, quoted below, as to &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>altering</hi> of divers houses and tenements in Bishopsgate Street, of which Sir Paul's house was very probably <num value="1">one</num>.</NOTE>

<P>By its constitution this establishment was partly an hospital, and partly a house of correction, <num value="1">one</num> portion thereof having been appropriated to the relief and encouragement of the deserving poor, and the other, to the punishment of vagrants and disorderly persons. Its foundation has been ascribed to an Act of Parliament passed in <datestruct value="1662--"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>; but the more remote cause of its erection is to be traced to an Act of the House of Commons, in <datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct>, which established a corporation for this purpose, by the name of the President and Governors for the Poor of the City of London and Liberties thereof. The preamble of that Act states &ldquo;the increase of poor to be very great within the City and Liberties, for want of due provision for their relief and employment, &amp;c.; for remedy whereof, and for better execution of the laws formerly made,&rdquo; it enacts, &ldquo;that there be from thenceforth, a corporation consisting of a President, Deputy-president, Treasurer, and <num value="48">48</num> Assistants; whereof the Lord Mayor, for the time being, always to be President, and <num value="10">ten</num> of the Assistants to be Aldermen; and the other <num value="50">50</num> to be Freemen chosen out of the wards, <num value="2">two</num> out of each ward respectively.&rdquo; The <num value="1">first</num> members are named, with Sir John Wollaston, Lord Mayor, at their head. They were invested with authority, at any time or times, upon reasonable cause, to remove their Deputy-president, and Treasurer, and to make fresh appointments, as also to regulate in certain particulars their own body, were constituted in all respects a corporation, empowered to hold courts, have a common seal, &amp;c. In the administration of their trust, they were, at discretion, to apprehend all rogues, vagrants, sturdy beggars, and idle and disorderly persons, within the City or Liberties, and to set them to work or punish them, as the circumstances of the case might require; as also to take up and employ other poor persons and children. And the Common Council of London were enjoined upon their application, properly made, to assess their several wards in such sums as might be found necessary for the support of the Charity (the inhabitants of such wards having a right of appeal in case of injustice), and were empowered to distrain on nonpayment, &amp;c. 
<P>This Institution, at the Restoration, was thought to have been so serviceable, that upon further application of the City to Parliament, it received full legislative sanction by the passing of the Acts <num value="13">13</num> and <num value="14">14</num> Car. II., which, repeating, as before, the necessity of relief and employment, &amp;c., for such particular classes of poor,&mdash;enact, &ldquo;that from thenceforth there should be <num value="1">one</num> or more corporation or corporations, workhouse or workhouses, within the City of London, &amp;c.;&rdquo; the former to consist of the like members, and to be invested with similar powers and privileges, as the persons appointed by the preceding Act of <datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct>. Money was to be raised, in cases of necessity, by the Common Council, in like manner as before, and the same powers were given of enforcing payment. The Corporation were allowed to make byelaws (to be approved by the magistrates), for the better performance of their trusts, and to purchase lands or tenements to the annual value of <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3000</num></measure>, &amp;c. 
<P>In pursuance of the power thus granted, we find in an Act of Common Council (<datestruct value="1706--"><year reg="1706">1706</year></datestruct>), Sir Thomas Rawlinson, Mayor, that by a former Act of that Court (<datestruct value="1698--"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>), and by <num value="3">three</num> other prior Acts of the said Court of Common Council, there had been several sums of money raised on the inhabitants of the City, for &ldquo;purchasing the building, and <hi rend=italics>altering</hi>
of divers houses and tenements in Bishopsgate Street, to make them convenient for the <hi rend=italics>confinement</hi>, maintaining, and employing of great numbers of vagrants, idle and disorderly persons, and distressed children, found in the public streets and passages of this City;&rdquo; and that there was still wanting the further sum of <measure value="5101l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5101">5101</num></measure> <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> to support the same. It was then enacted, that <measure value="4887l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4887">4887</num></measure> <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="0.25">0 1/4</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> should be raised by <num value="1">one</num> entire assessment upon the citizens, in the proportions to each parish as there specified. 
<P>The several parishes formerly paid <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">one</num> shilling</measure> a week for each child they had in the Workhouse, beside their assessments; but Michaelmas, <datestruct value="1751--"><year reg="1751">1751</year></datestruct>, the Governors came to a resolution, that no more children, paid for by the parishes to which they belong, should be admitted into the house; and it was afterwards further resolved, that only such children should be taken in as were committed by the Magistrates of the City, found begging in the streets, pilfering on the quays, or lying about in glass-houses and uninhabited places. 
<P>The building for the reception of these poor, called the London Workhouse, appears to have been finished about the year <datestruct value="1680"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>, during the mayoralty of Sir Robert Clayton, whose portrait, as its <num value="1">first</num> President and Governor, still remains an ornament of the Court-room. It was originally divided into <num value="2">two</num> parts; the <num value="1">first</num>, next Bishopsgate Street, and called &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>the Steward's side</hi>,&rdquo; was chiefly for the accommodation of poor children; the west end or side, called &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>the Keeper's side</hi>,&rdquo; was for vagabonds and dissolute poor. In this latter place the females taken up in the streets, were employed in beating hemp, washing of linen, &amp;c., similarly to Bridewell, and the men in other hard labour. This part has <pb id="p.94" n="94"> been long abandoned by such characters, and is the same now remaining in ruins, where the prisoners from Ludgate were confined, and called Ludgate Prison, as mentioned in the account of Sir Paul Pindar's house. 
<p><FIGURE id="fig.2.94.1" n="2000.66.0042"><HEAD><placename>Ludgate Prison</placename>, with a Plan of the London Workhouse, Sir Paul Pindar's House, Lodge &amp;c.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 
<P>The &ldquo;Steward's side&rdquo; of the Workhouse, which is still in use, is a long high range of brick building, with stone dressings, &amp;c., the general appearance of which will be best understood from the vignette view at the bottom of the accompanying Print, which represents the Bishopsgate Street front, or principal entrance. Though formerly a handsome structure, it is now in a sad state of dilapidation, and evidently, like the Charity itself, hastening fast to ruin. <num value="1">One</num> relic of its former importance is the Court-room, in which the President and Governors formerly met on the business of the Charity. This apartment, now forlorn and deserted, has a look of decayed grandeur which reminds <num value="1">one</num>, that the Chief Magistrate of London, and his brethren, once assembled here. It is spacious and lofty: at the upper end is the seat for the President, adorned with Corinthian columns, entablature, &amp;c., and before it a massy table, round which the other members of the Corporation sat. The walls above are ornamented with lists of benefactors, painted in gold letters on tables of black. The following is the aggregate amount of the sums given in different years, with the names of some of the principal donors: Anno <datestruct value="1730"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>, <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure>; <datestruct value="1731--"><year reg="1731">1731</year></datestruct>, <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure>; <datestruct value="1732--"><year reg="1732">1732</year></datestruct>, <measure value="1050l." type=currency>&pound; <datestruct value="1050--"><year reg="1050">1050</year></datestruct></measure>; <datestruct value="1733--"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>, <measure value="205l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="205">205</num></measure>; <datestruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></datestruct>, <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>; <datestruct value="1735--"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>, <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>; <datestruct value="1736--"><year reg="1736">1736</year></datestruct>, <measure value="1370l." type=currency>&pound; <datestruct value="1370--"><year reg="1370">1370</year></datestruct></measure>, of which sum Samuel Wright, Esq., contributed <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct></measure>; <datestruct value="1738--"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct>, <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure>; <datestruct value="1740--"><year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct>, <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>; <datestruct value="1741--"><year reg="1741">1741</year></datestruct>, <measure value="105l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="105">105</num></measure>; <datestruct value="1742--"><year reg="1742">1742</year></datestruct>, <measure value="1200l." type=currency>&pound; <datestruct value="1200--"><year reg="1200">1200</year></datestruct></measure>, whereof from a &ldquo;Person Unknown&rdquo; <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct></measure>; <datestruct value="1744--"><year reg="1744">1744</year></datestruct>, <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>; <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct>, Samuel Pennant, Esq., Alderman and Sheriff, <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure> (this gentleman was related to Mr. Pennant, the eminent topographical writer); <datestruct value="1746--"><year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct>, <measure value="1020l." type=currency>&pound; <datestruct value="1020--"><year reg="1020">1020</year></datestruct></measure>; <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>, <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>; <datestruct value="1759--"><year reg="1759">1759</year></datestruct>, <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure>; <datestruct value="1764--"><year reg="1764">1764</year></datestruct>, Jeunix Dry, Esq., <measure value="2840l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2840">2840</num></measure> (this gentleman is said to have been the proprietor and donor of the ground on which the Workhouse stands); <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>; <datestruct value="1771--"><year reg="1771">1771</year></datestruct>, <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> <num value="10">10</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>; <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure>; <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>, <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure>. Over the mantelpiece is the portrait of Sir Robert Clayton, just mentioned, an undoubted original, and finely painted. It is a half-length, in the dress, and with the insignia, of Lord Mayor. Above it, are richly carved, the state sword, mace, cap of maintenance, &amp;c., and below, and on each side, are shields of arms and other ornaments. Both this picture and the carvings (the latter of which are exquisite) deserve a better situation. At the end of the room, opposite the President's chair, is a handsome clock, enriched with civic ornaments, the gift of Lady Anne Clayton, <datestruct value="1709--"><year reg="1709">1709</year></datestruct>. 
<P>The number of children formerly on this Foundation amounted to <num value="400">400</num>, exclusively of vagrants and disorderly. The yearly charge of maintaining these children is stated by Maitland, <datestruct value="1751--"><year reg="1751">1751</year></datestruct>, to have amounted to <measure value="2400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2400">2400</num></measure> per annum, besides the profits of their earnings; and the private gifts had, according to the same writer, exceeded <measure value="15000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="15000">15,000</num></measure>; yet these means are admitted by him to have been insufficient, the real estate of the Corporation, exclusively of the ground on which the Workhouse stood, amounting then to little more than <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> a year; and he earnestly invokes the assistance of the humane and charitable. Since that time the affairs of the Corporation have still further declined, and a few years more will probably see the whole dissolved, and the site converted to other purposes. 
<P>The benefits of this establishment formerly, will be seen from the following statements (Hist. Lond. v. ii. B. ii. p. <num value="819">819</num>, et seq.). Beggars and vagrants discharged from Easter, <datestruct value="1700--"><year reg="1700">1700</year></datestruct>, to Easter, <datestruct value="1713--"><year reg="1713">1713</year></datestruct>, <num value="5555">5555</num>.

Of the children educated here altogether, during half a century, viz., from <datestruct value="1701--"><year reg="1701">1701</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1751--"><year reg="1751">1751</year></datestruct>, there had been discharged or provided with employments and situations, besides those mentioned above, <num value="3000">3000</num>; and within that time <num value="20854">20,854</num> dissolute poor disposed of: among whom, he adds, several notorious impostors, pretending to be lame, dumb, and blind, had been committed and punished with confinement and hard labour. 
<P>The boys on the Foundation were formerly employed principally in weaving nets for the British fisheries: <num value="1">one</num> boy is stated to have usually knitted <num value="25">25</num> yards of this netting per week, at eighteenpence the <num value="20">20</num> yards; and every boy knitting above <num value="24">24</num> yards in that space, had a penny per week allowed him by way of encouragement. In <num value="29">29</num> weeks was knit in this way, <num value="10529">10,529</num> yards, <hi rend=italics>i.e.</hi>, at the rate of <num value="362">362</num> yards per week. The girls were employed in slighter works, fitted to their sex, age, &amp;c. Their food was plain, but wholesome and sufficient. 
<P>&ldquo;It is to be wondered at,&rdquo; says Maitland, &ldquo;how all things are contrived here to the best advantage, for thrift and good husbandry, to maintain in clothes and food, such a vast number as live and are harboured here. Some are tailors, some shoemakers, some knit stockings. They brew their own drink, having in the new building (a large range of workshops, &amp;c., before mentioned by him as then just finished) erected a large and convenient brewhouse, and over that a malthouse. They killed their own beef and mutton, and have for that purpose a slaughter-house; but since they find it better husbandry to buy their meat of the butcher. And in case of sickness, broken limbs, or sores, or wounds, they have advice, physic, and surgery gratis.&rdquo; 
<P>The dress of the children, the costume of whom will be seen in the <num value="2">two</num> figures of them over the front entrance, was all the same, being made of russet cloth, with a round badge worn upon the breast, representing a poor boy and a sheep; the motto (which is also that of the arms of the Charity), &ldquo;God's Providence is our Inheritance.&rdquo; <num value="1">One</num> of these boys, John Trusty, aged <num value="11">eleven</num> years, delivered a speech to Queen Anne, on her visiting Guildhall, in <datestruct value="1702--"><year reg="1702">1702</year></datestruct>, which Maitland has given at length in his account. <pb id="p.95" n="95">

<P>In the year <datestruct value="1666"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, the House of Bridewell was burnt, and all the apartments belonging to it; likewise all the dwellinghouses in the precinct, which were about <num value="2">two</num>-thirds of the revenue of the house; but the governors, till the hospital could be rebuilt, made provision for the several arts-masters and their apprentices, in places remote from the city. 
<P>The Chapel, Court Room, workhouses, dwellinghouses, within the said hospital, by the care and pains of the governors, were soon rebuilt in a more convenient manner. The reparations, rebuilding, and other incidental charges, occasioned by the fire, amounted to above <measure value="6000l." type=currency><num value="6000">six thousand</num> pounds</measure>. Beside the great loss that this house sustained by the fire in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, its revenue was much impaired by <num value="2">two</num> other fires that happened at Wapping, where a great many tenements belonging to it were burnt; the <num value="1">one</num> in <datestruct VALUE="1673-06--"><month reg="06">June</month> <year reg="1673">1673</year></datestruct>, and the other in <datestruct VALUE="1682-11--"><month reg="11">November</month> <year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct>. 
<P>The old chapel belonging to Bridewell precinct was enlarged and beautified at the cost and charge of the governors and inhabitants of the precinct, in the year <datestruct value="1620"><year reg="1620">1620</year></datestruct>: Sir Thomas Middleton being then president, and Mr. Thomas Johnson treasurer of the hospital. The enlargement was by taking in a large room, which, before the date above named, joined upon the head of the chapel: this ground adding to the length of the chapel (at the full breadth going with it) full <num value="24">twenty-four</num> feet. The room thus taken in, trimmed, beautified, and consecrated, was made a handsome chapel; it being before a room empty, waste, rude, and unsightly, though then in the use deserving a fair commendation; for then the ground was a chapel for the prisoners of the house, into which, every Sabbath, through a backward passage, they were brought from their several lodgings to hear divine service and sermons. 
<P>Close by the pulpit hung the picture of Edward VI, with these lines under it: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>This Edward of Fair Memory the Sixt 
<L>In whom with Greatness, Goodness was commixt, 
<L>Gave this Bridewell, a Palace in old times,

<P>Here also was Queen Elizabeth's monument, with the common verses, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Here lies her Type, &amp;c.</QUOTE>

<P>This chapel being destroyed by the fire, in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, it was re-edified, and finished in <datestruct value="1668--"><year reg="1668">1668</year></datestruct>, in the manner hereafter described. It had a square roof, and <num value="2">two</num> galleries, at the north and west sides, supported by columns of the Tuscan order; at the west side were places for the hospital boys, and others for the prisoners. The walls brick; the wainscot and finishing very neat. The altar-piece consisted of <num value="2">two</num> pilasters, with their entablature and circular pediment of the Corinthian order; between which were the Commandments done in gold on black, and the Lord's Prayer and Creed in gold on blue, in gilt frames; and further enriched with gilt cherubim, leaves, fruit, &amp;c. carved in relievo. The chancel was paved with black and white marble at the <num value="1">first</num> building, but now the whole floor of the chapel was paved in the same manner. The last part, with a handsome pair of iron gates, were the gift of Sir William Withers, of whom there is an excellent engraved portrait (with a fac-simile of his autograph) from an original picture, in the possession of Edmund Lodge, Esq. now Norroy Herald. 
<P>To this chapel and precinct belonged the following officers: The Rev. Mr. Gibbons, preacher chosen by the governors; the reader, the Rev. Mr. Jenkins; the <num value="2">two</num> chapel wardens, <num value="1">one</num> in the house, the other in the precinct; and <num value="1">one</num> constable living within the house, generally the porter thereof. 
<P>The Court Room has a chair for the president, and convenient seats for the governors. It is adorned with columns of the Composite order, a gallery, &amp;c. but the most valuable embellishments are the several handsome tables, on which the names of the benefactors are depencilled in gold letters. 
<P>Over the door, at the entrance, is this inscription: &ldquo;This Chapel, Court Room, and Parlour, were repaired and beautified in the year <datestruct value="1706"><year reg="1706">1706</year></datestruct>. Sir Thomas Rawlinson, lord mayor, then president; Thomas Gardiner, Esq. treasurer.&rdquo; 
<P>And over the gates going into the chapel: &ldquo;These Iron Gates, and the Marble Pavement, were the gift of the Right Worshipful Sir William Withers, Knt. and alderman, president of this hospital Anno Dom. <datestruct value="1713--"><year reg="1713">1713</year></datestruct>.&rdquo; 
<P>The management of the affairs in this hospital is by the governors, who are above <num value="300">three hundred</num>, beside the lord mayor and court of aldermen; all of whom are likewise governors of the hospital of Bethlem. The officers are a president, a treasurer, a court clerk, a steward, a matron, a porter, and <num value="4">four</num> beadles, the youngest of whom is to give correction to the criminals. 
<P>Bridewell was anciently a palace, and honoured with the residence of several of our monarchs, even as early as King John. It was formed partly out of the remains of an ancient castle, the western <hi rend=italics>arx palatina</hi> of the city, which stood near the river Fleet, close to the Thames. In <datestruct value="1087--"><year reg="1087">1087</year></datestruct>, William I gave many of the choicest materials toward the rebuilding of St. Paul's cathedral, which had been destroyed by the fire. And Henry I gave as many of the stones, from the walls of the castle-yard, as served to enclose and form the gates and precinct of the church. Notwithstanding this, the dwelling remained, and became the residence of several of our monarchs. It remained neglected till Henry VIII resided here. To this palace that arbitrary prince convened all the abbots, and other heads of religious houses, English and foreign, and squeezed out of them a <measure value="100000l." type=currency><num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> pounds</measure>; in those days an enormous sum:&mdash;from the Cistercians, who would not own his supremacy, not less than <num value="33000">thirty-three thousand</num>. He enlarged the palace, and furnished it in a most magnificent manner, for the reception of the Emperor Charles V, who visited England in <datestruct value="1522--"><year reg="1522">1522</year></datestruct>.&mdash; After all the expense, the Emperor lodged in Black Friars, and his suite in the new palace; and from the palace a gallery of communication was erected over the ditch, and a passage cut through the city wall, into the Emperor's apartments. 
<P>Henry VIII appears to have been particularly attached to this place; and in the year <datestruct value="1525"><year reg="1525">1525</year></datestruct>, a Parliament being then holden in Black Friars, he created states of nobility there, viz. 
<P>Henry Fitzroy, a child (which he had by Elizabeth Blunt) to be Earl of Nottingham, Duke of Richmond and of Somerset, lieutenant-general from Trent northward, and warden of the East, Middle, and West Marches for anenst Scotland. 
<P>Henry Courtney, Earl of Devonshire, cousin-german to the King, to be Marquis of Excester. 
<P>Henry Brandon, a child of <num value="2">two</num> years old, son to the Earl of Suffolk, to be Earl of Lincoln. 
<P>Sir Thomas Manners, Lord Ross, to be Earl of Rutland. 
<P>Sir Henry Clifford, to be Earl of Cumberland. 
<P>Sir Robert Ratcliff, to be Viscount Fitzwater. 
<P>Sir Thomas Boloine, treasurer of the King's household, to be Viscount Rochford. <pb id="p.96" n="96"> 
<P>In the year <datestruct value="1528"><year reg="1528">1528</year></datestruct>, Cardinal Campeius was brought to the King's presence, being then at Bridewell, to which palace he had called all his nobility, judges, counsellors, &amp;c. and here, the <datestruct VALUE="-11-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, in his great chamber, he made unto them an oration touching his marriage with Queen Katherine. And in <datestruct value="1529--"><year reg="1529">1529</year></datestruct>, the same King Henry and Queen Katherine resided here, while the question of their marriage was argued at Black Friars. 
<P>The palace fell afterwards into decay, and was begged by the pious Bishop Ridley, from Edward VI, to be converted to some charitable purpose. The way in which it became a House of Correction was thus: &ldquo;In the year <datestruct value="1553"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>, the <num value="7">7th</num> of Edward VI, the <datestruct VALUE="-04-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, Sir George Barne, being maior of this city, was sent for to the court at Whitehall, and there at that time, the King gave unto him, for the communalty and citizens to be a workhouse for the poor and idle persons of the city, his house of Bridewell, and <measure value="700bmark" type=currency><num value="700">seven hundred</num> marks</measure> of land, late of the possessions of the house of the Savoy; and all the bedding and other furniture of the said workhouse of Bridewell, and the hospital of St. Thomas in Southwark.&rdquo; 
<P>This gift King Edward confirmed by his charter, dated the <datestruct VALUE="-06-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, next following. And in the year <datestruct value="1555"><year reg="1555">1555</year></datestruct>, in the month of February, Sir William Gerard, maior, and the aldermen, entered Bridewell, and took possession thereof, according to the gift of the said King. The same was also confirmed by Queen Mary. 
<P>Concerning the forwarding of this good work of Bridewell, and bringing it to a desired perfection, this act of Common Council was made the last of February, in the <num value="2">second</num> and <num value="3">third</num> years of Philip and Mary. 
<P>&ldquo;Forasmuch as King Edward VI had given his house of Bridewell unto the city, partly for the setting of idle and lewd people to work, and partly for the lodging and harbouring of the poor, sick, weak and sore people of this city; and of poor wayfaring people repairing to the same; and had for this last purpose, given the bedding and furniture of the Savoy to that purpose; therefore, in consideration that very great charges would be required to the fitting up of the said house, and the buying of tools and bedding, the money was ordered to be gotten up among the rich people of the Companies of London, &amp;c.&rdquo; 
<P>And as the city had appointed Grey Friars, now called Christ Hospital, for the education of poor children, and St. Bartholomew, and St. Thomas in Southwark, for the maimed and diseased; Edward formed the governors of these charitable foundations into a corporation, allowed them a proper authority for the exercise of their offices, and constituted himself the founder and patron. 
<P>In the following reigns granaries, and storehouses for coal, were erected at the expense of the city within this hospital, and the poor were employed in grinding corn with hand-mills, which were greatly improved in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. 
<P>For the encouragement of manufactures, a number of handicraft tradesmen of several professions are allowed habitations in this hospital, for the purpose of taking apprentices, at the appointment of the governors, to train up to their respective occupations. These tradesmen are termed arts-masters of Bridewell, and their apprentices were well known, until within the last <num value="30">thirty</num> years, by the name of Bridewell boys: prior to that time, they uniformly wore a very awkward dress, consisting of blue cloth jackets, without any shirts, clumsy trowsers of the same thick stuff, and white hats; but now they are apparelled as other tradesmen's apprentices, having neither a particular colour or fashion, to distinguish them from other persons. These youths having faithfully served their apprenticeship, are not only made free of the city, but have <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> given them toward business for themselves. Prior to the vast increase of insurance offices against fire, and the multiplied numbers of engines and firemen, the Bridewell boys were particularly active and expert in their assistance on those calamitous occasions, and were generally the <num value="1">first</num> to check the ravages of that destructive element. 
<P>To this hospital, abandoned women, pickpockets, vagrants, and incorrigible servants, are committed by the lord mayor and aldermen; as are also disobedient apprentices, by the chamberlain of the city; where they are obliged to beat hemp, and if the nature of their offences require it, undergo the correction of whipping. 
<P>On the completion of Blackfriars Bridge, the front of Bridewell Hospital, then greatly decayed, was taken down, and handsomely rebuilt, several feet backwarder; to give the street a straight direction from Fleet Street to the Bridge; by which means the front court is much contracted from its former size. 
<P>Not a vestige remains of those parts of the ancient building, represented in the N.W. view of the Chapel, and part of the great staircase, as given in the Plate; every stone and brick, including the projecting tower, having been taken down, to make way for the modern improvements, which have since taken place. The distant view is that of Bridge Street. The Plate will be seen by a reference to the <num value="1">first</num> volume of this work. 
<P>The present new Chapel is a substantial brick edifice, very neatly fitted up with pews; it has <num value="4">four</num> handsome windows, <num value="1">one</num> over the communion table, and <num value="3">three</num> looking toward the large court-yard of the hospital; there are no other ornaments or embellishments than the King's arms placed on the wall opposite the centre of the middle window, and an excellent organ in a very handsome and spacious gallery fronting the altar. 
<P>The chapel doors are screened with iron gates, the same as have been before mentioned, the gift of Sir William Withers. In a small apartment to the right of the entrance is placed a neat marble font, upon a pedestal; and the opposite chamber on the left is used as the vestry-room. 
<P>The handicraft tradesmen, and their apprentices, are almost wholly done away with; and the once royal palace of Bridewell is now in use solely as a city prison and penitentiary for the lewd and dissolute of both sexes, and as a probationary place to reform and reclaim them from vice, by means of occupation and instruction. 
<P>The accompanying Plate is a view of that part of the quadrangle of the court of this hospital, comprising the male prison, part of the female prison, and the great hall containing Holbein's painting of the presentation of the charter.

<p><FIGURE id="fig.2.96.1" n="2000.66.0045"><HEAD><placename>St. John's House, Hoxton</placename>, with a Plan of its Environs.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 
<P>This ancient house, generally known by the name of the White House, Hoxton Old Town, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, in the county of Middlesex, is supposed to have been erected early in the reign of King James the <num value="1">First</num>, by Oliver, <num value="3">third</num> Lord St. John of Bletsoe, in the county of Bedford, and until within the last <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40">forty</num> years, there was a vane upon the top of the building, the fan of which was perforated with St. J O <datestruct value="1610--"><year reg="1610">1610</year></datestruct>, which was remembered to have remained many years in the recollection of a very respectable inhabitant lately living in the neighbourhood. 
<P>The St. Johns, Lords of (Bletshoe) Bletsoe, are descended from Sir John St. John of Stanton St. John in the county of Oxford, who had the honour of knighthood conferred on him by King Henry VII, at the creation of his eldest son Arthur, Prince of Wales. And from this Sir John, in lineal descent, was Oliver St. John, Esq. who by letters patent, bearing date <datestruct VALUE="-01-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>, <num value="1">1st</num> of Elizabeth, was advanced to the dignity of a baron of the realm, by the title of Lord St. John of Bletsoe; and in the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> of the same reign, was <num value="1">one</num> of the peers that sat in judgment on Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk; and dying in the <num value="24">twenty-fourth</num> of Elizabeth, was succeeded by his eldest son John, the <num value="2">second</num> baron of this title, who was <num value="1">one</num> of the peers that sat on the trial of Mary Queen of Scots; he died on the <datestruct VALUE="1596-10-23"><day reg="23">twenty-third</day> of <month reg="10">October</month> <year reg="1596">1596</year></datestruct>, and by his will ordered his body to be buried at Bletsoe, in such manner as his father was buried. He left issue by Catharine his wife, daughter to Sir William Dormer, of Ethorpe, in the county of Bucks, knight, <num value="1">one</num> sole daughter and heir, Anne, married to William Lord Howard of Effingham, eldest son to Charles Howard, Earl of Nottingham. Dying without issue male, he was succeeded in the title by his brother, Oliver St. John, the <num value="3">third</num> Lord of Bletsoe, who married Dorothy, daughter and heir to John Read, of the county of Gloucester, Esq. by whom he had <num value="8">eight</num> sons, and <num value="7">seven</num> daughters, viz. Oliver, his successor; John, who died young; Anthony, Alexander, and Rowland, who became knights; and Henry, Beauchamp, and Dudley, which last <num value="3">three</num> died young; of the daughters, Elizabeth was married to Sir William Beecher; Margaret, to Sir Thomas Cheney; Judith, to Sir John Tompson; Anne, to Robert Charnock, Esq. and Catharine, Dorothy, and Martha, the <num value="3">three</num> younger, died unmarried. 
<P>The initial letters and date of the year on the vane, evidently point out this house to have been the residence of Oliver St. John, the <num value="3">third</num> Baron of Bletsoe, who died here in the year <datestruct value="1618"><year reg="1618">1618</year></datestruct>. Yet there is every reason to believe the building to be of much greater age, than that of the period of James I: it more nearly resembles the architecture of the reign of Henry VIII; and the present occupant, Mr. Tipple, has been informed by several persons, whom curiosity led to view the house, that it had only undergone a thorough repair in the year <datestruct value="1610"><year reg="1610">1610</year></datestruct>, when a new vane was put up; but that the erection of the building was at least of <num value="100">one hundred</num> years prior date. 
<P>Oliver the eldest son of the preceding Baron was the <num value="4">fourth</num> Baron of Bletsoe, and in the <num value="22">twenty-second</num> of James I. was created Earl of Bolingbroke: he married Elizabeth, daughter and heir to William Paulet, of the county of Somerset, by whom he had issue <num value="4">four</num> sons; Oliver, his successor; Paulet, made knight of the Bath at the coronation of King Charles I; Francis, who died unmarried; and Anthony; also <num value="3">three</num> daughters; Elizabeth, who died young; Dorothy, married to John, Lord Rochford, eldest son of Henry, Earl of Dover; and Barbara, who died young. His Lordship was succeeded by Oliver his eldest son (called Lord St. John), who had been made knight of the Bath at the coronation of King Charles I; and bearing arms against the King in the battle fought near Kineton, <datestruct VALUE="1642-10-23"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=23>23</day>, <year reg=1642>1642</year></datestruct>, was there slain. He left issue by Arabella his wife, daughter to John, Earl of Bridgewater, <num value="4">four</num> daughters; Frances, married to Sir William Beecher, of Howbery in the county of Bedford; Elizabeth, to John Bennet, of Cotsbach, in the county of Leicester, Esq.; Arabella, to Sir Edward Wise, of Fidleham, in the county of Devonshire; and Dorothy, married to Francis Charleton of Apley, in the county of Salop, Esq. Dying without issue male, Oliver, son and heir to Sir Paulet St. John, knight of the Bath (<num value="2">second</num> son to Oliver the <num value="1">first</num> Earl of Bolingbroke) by Elizabeth daughter and heir to Sir Rowland Vaughan, of the Spittle, near Shoreditch, in the suburbs of London, succeeded his grandfather in the title; and having married Lady Frances, <num value="2">second</num> daughter of William, Duke of Newcastle, died without issue, <datestruct VALUE="1687-03-18"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=18>18</day>, <year reg=1687>1687</year></datestruct>-<num value="8">8</num>. He was succeeded by Paulet St. John, his brother and heir, who dying unmarried, on the <datestruct VALUE="1711-10-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month> <year reg="1711">1711</year></datestruct>, the earldom became extinct; and the barony of Bletsoe devolved on Sir Andrew St. John, of Woodford in the county of Essex, <num value="1">one</num> of the descendants of Sir Rowland St. John, <num value="5">fifth</num> son of Oliver, the <num value="2">second</num> Baron of Bletsoe. 
<P>The family of St. John were extremely numerous. Sir Alexander St. John (<num value="4">fourth</num> son of the nobleman that died at Bletsoe in <datestruct value="1618--"><year reg="1618">1618</year></datestruct>) with a numerous succession of relatives were buried in the church of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, as appears by the parish registers: and on the north side, near the east end of the old church, was a handsome white marble monument adorned with pilasters, entablature, pediment, and <num value="2">two</num> Cupids, with the following inscription: 
<P>Sir Alexander St. John, knight, son to the right honourable Oliver St. John, Baron of Bletsoe, caused this monument to be erected in memory of his late faithful and truly virtuous consort, the Lady Margaret St. John, daughter of John Trye, of Hardwick in the county of Gloucester, Esq. whose body lyeth near unto this place interred, expecting a glorious resurrection. Aetat. <num value="73">73</num>, Ob. <datestruct VALUE="1656-08-27"><day reg="27">27</day> <month reg="08">Aug.</month> <year reg="1656">1656</year></datestruct>. 
<P>The above Sir Alexander St. John was elected to parliament for the town of Bedford in the <num value="12">twelfth</num>, eighteenth, and <num value="21">twenty-first</num> years of James I, and <num value="1">first</num> of Charles I, and knighted in <datestruct value="1608--"><year reg="1608">1608</year></datestruct>, with his brother Anthony. His lady was the widow of Thomas Draynor, Esq. (buried at Shoreditch, <datestruct VALUE="1632-06-4"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=4>4</day>, <year reg=1632>1632</year></datestruct>) and married to her <num value="2">second</num> husband Sir Alexander St. John, the <datestruct VALUE="1633-11-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month> <year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>. The widow Draynor is noticed among the benefactors to the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, but the amount is not specified; it was added to the sums given by Mrs. Tice; which were laid out <datestruct VALUE="1633-04-9"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=9>9</day>, <year reg=1633>1633</year></datestruct>, with other benefactions, amounting in all to the sum of <measure value="256l." type=currency><num value="256">two hundred and fifty-six</num> pounds</measure>, in purchasing of Richard Middleton, <num value="3">three</num> tenements, and <num value="3">three</num> acres of land (the Land of Promise, in Hoxton) as a parish estate. These premises were leased out <datestruct VALUE="1636-02-7"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=7>7</day>, <year reg=1636>1636</year></datestruct>, to H. Hempson, for <num value="41">forty-one</num> years at <measure value="16l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="16">16</num></measure> per annum; to Edward Hunt, <datestruct VALUE="1668-10-1"><month reg="10">Oct.</month> <day reg=1>1</day>, <year reg=1668>1668</year></datestruct>, for <num value="51">fifty-one</num> years, at <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> per annum; to Charles Garret, <datestruct VALUE="1683-10-17"><month reg="10">Oct.</month> <day reg=17>17</day>, <year reg=1683>1683</year></datestruct>, for <num value="65">sixty-five</num> years, at the same rent; and lastly to Samuel Beighton, from Lady Day <datestruct value="1744--"><year reg="1744">1744</year></datestruct>, for <num value="13">one hundred and three</num> years at <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> per annum. 
<P>Ellis, in his History and Antiquities of Shoreditch, informs us, that the house in Spital Square, inhabited by Mr. Pearson, has long been called Spital House; and in the early part of the last century was the dwelling of the celebrated Viscount Bolingbroke. That it was the same that was inhabited by Sir Rowland Vaughan is beyond a doubt; but whether it afterwards descended to Lord Bolingbroke cannot be affirmed with any certainty. Soon after <datestruct value="1700--"><year reg="1700">1700</year></datestruct>, the estate passed by purchase, from the St. Johns of Bletsoe, to the Tillard family, in which it still continues. 
<P>St. John's House, Hoxton, was kept from about the years <datestruct value="1740--"><year reg=1740>1740</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg=1750>1750</year></datestruct> as a boarding school, by the father of the learned George Baddeley, D.D. And from this gentleman it descended successively to Messrs. Barnes, Smith, Hills, Burrows, and Tipple, the latter of whom has it at present in use, as an asylum for paupers farmed out by various parishes. 
<P>The interior of this once noble mansion still exhibits the rank, wealth, and consequence of its former inhabitants. An entrance hall of no mean dimensions, divides the gronnd apartments, consisting of <num value="4">four</num> rooms. The <num value="1">first</num> room on the right is at present (<datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>) converted into a sitting parlour, in the best state of repair and neatest possible order; the wainscot is composed of an oaken panelled partition; and a very spacious curiously wrought mantlepiece, with carved festooned ornaments of fruit and flowers of solid oak, finishes this striking feature of the room, the whole of which is well painted, grained, and varnished. The room behind this is appropriated to the use of delivering bread and other necessaries to the different inmates that are here accommodated. The rooms on the left of the entrance (once decorated with carved heads of cherubim, some of which are still remaining) were formerly united, and in use as a chapel for the family, and where, as in all similar establishments, morning and evening prayers were regularly read; but they are now solely in use as a receptacle for lumber. Fronting the entrance is a noble and spacious staircase, with richly carved bannisters and other decorative ornaments, exhibiting the splendour and magnificence of its founder. Indeed it appears, neither expense nor pains were spared to render this house desirable to a <num value="1">first</num>-rate family of distinction. 
<P>A very curious door of oak, of great weight and thickness, opens into a back court, spacious and convenient, in which are some out-buildings of modern erection, that serve as wards and sitting rooms for those who are on this establishment. The back entrance to St. John's House was ornamented with brick pillars and gates, in a similar manner to those that at present embellish the front. The ground and gardens must have formerly been very extensive; the remains of an ancient arched gateway, at the extremity of a field behind the house extending as far as Kingsland Road, being remembered to exist within these few years, and which was probably the entrance to a paddock appertaining to the other grounds and gardens. <pb id="p.99" n="99">

<P>It is generally stated that Sir Andrew Judde established these Alms-houses and his celebrated Free-School at Tunbridge, under the authority of the same Letters-patent, dated <datestruct VALUE="-05-16"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=16>16th</day></datestruct>, in the <num value="7">7th</num> Year of Edward VI., <datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>; but, independently that such an instrument was probably not required for the foundation in St. Helen's, the record of the original license for that School in the Rolls Chapel, contains no reference to the former charity. Whether Sir Andrew were the actual founder of this establishment or not, it is evident, by the ensuing extract from his Will, that he considered himself as such; and that he at least augmented the original endowment of the members, and vested the funds and government in the Company of Skinners of London. This instrument is dated <datestruct VALUE="1558-09-2"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=2>2nd</day>, <year reg=1558>1558</year></datestruct>, and was proved the following <datestruct VALUE="-10-15"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=15>15th</day></datestruct>; and is recorded in the register of the Prerogative Office, <num value="58">58</num> Noodes, Quire <num value="22">22</num>.

<P>In the statement relating to this Charity given by the Skinners' Company in answer to the enquiries of the Parliament Commissioners, it is observed concerning the above bequest, that &ldquo;there is nothing in the books of the Company to shew that any such purchase or conveyance was ever made, as directed by the Will of Alice Smith, nor does it appear that any annual receipt of a sum of <measure value="15l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="15">15</num></measure>. is distinctly applied as Mrs. Alice Smith's donation; but the several payments, as directed by the Will of Mrs. Alice Smith, are, in fact, made by the Company.

<P>Beneath the annexed Engraving of the present front of this edifice, is a small Ground-plan shewing the presumed site of the original Alms-houses, as it appears to be indicated in the large <num value="4">four</num>-sheet Map of London by Radulphus Aggas, about the year <datestruct value="1560"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>; wherein at &ldquo;St. Elen's&rdquo; is shewn a line of small low buildings, under a connected roof, with a centre house having a gable-front rising above them. But whatever might be the original site and form of these buildings, as they stood considerably beyond the extent of the ravages of the Great Fire, they remained until they fell into decay with years; and in <datestruct value="1729--"><year reg="1729">1729</year></datestruct> the Skinners' Company erected the present Alms-house, on the west of the former, and on the north side of the approach to Great St. Helen's from Bishopgate Street, opposite the back of Crosby Hall. It seems probable that this spot immediately adjoined to the old buildings, and that it was fixed there that the pensioners might remain undisturbed until the new Alms-house was quite completed. In its arrangements the increased value of the ground on which it stands is made particularly evident, since the Alms-men are placed in distinct apartments and floors only, instead of separate dwellings. The rooms are <num value="6">six</num> in number, <num value="3">three</num> on each side of the door-way and passage in the centre; and consist of a bed-chamber and sittingroom for each person, with closets and other conveniences. Upon entering, the doors of the apartments on the ground-floor are on the right and left of the passage, and those to the upper-chambers are from the landings of staircases ascending from the back part of the house, communicating with a paved yard behind. The apartments of the basement-story are used for coal-cellars. <pb id="p.101" n="101">

<P>The comparative neglect of this establishment in the histories of the Metropolis, is probably to be attributed to the circumstance, that the benefits of the charity are divided between <num value="2">two</num> parishes; and that altogether it forms but a single and minor branch of numerous benefactions which the foundress ordered for several places in the County of York. The spot on which these dwellings are built, was originally part of those unoccupied fields and pasture-grounds on the north of the City, which were appointed for the erection of a Pest-House or lazaretto, for the reception of distressed persons infected by the Plague of <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>: and thence called Pest-House Fields.<NOTE N="a"><P>Another field appropriated to the same purpose and bearing the same name as those above mentioned, was in St. James's Parish. &ldquo;The site,&rdquo; says Maitland, &ldquo;whereon Marshall Street, part of Little Broad Street, and Marlborough Market, are now erected, was denominated Pest Field, from a lazaretto thereon, for the reception of poor and miserable objects of the neighbourhood, that were afflicted with the dreadful Plague, Anno <datestruct value="1665"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>. And at the lower end of Marshall Street, contiguous to Silver Street, was a common cemetery, wherein some thousands of corses were buried of those that died of that dreadful and direful contagion.&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend=italics>History of London</hi> by William Maitland, Lond. <datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>. fol. p. <num value="776">776</num>. Some other Pest-Houses were erected in Tothill Fields, Westminster.</NOTE> They extend from Old Street on the south, to Islington on the north, and Hoxton on the east; and the Pest-House itself was situate beyond the western end of the great bason of Peerless Pool, on the south side of the Hospital erected in <datestruct value="1707--"><year reg="1707">1707</year></datestruct> for the reception of poor French Protestants resident in Great Britain:<NOTE N="b"><P>In William Faden's edition of Richard Horwood's excellent and elaborate <hi rend=italics>Plan of London</hi>, <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>,&mdash;the present French Hospital is erroneously marked as &ldquo;anciently the Pest House;&rdquo; whereas both the buildings were actually standing together at the same time.

It is probable that the site of it is now indicated by Russell's Row, the tablet of which bears the date of <datestruct value="1738--"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct>, perhaps from having been erected immediately on the destruction of the Pest House: it joins the northern extremity of the French Hospital, and forms the northwest end of Bath Street.</NOTE> near the site of the burial-ground adjoining St. Luke's Hospital. The street now called Bath Street, marks part of the direction of a broad lane originally named Pest-House Row, from the place to which it led; and before the formation of the City Road the same path was continued in a straight line across the fields to Islington, joining on to the lower end of Shepherds' Walk, at the present Eagle Tavern, which formerly bore the well-known sign of the Shepherd and Shepherdess. A short distance to the north of that place of entertainment, forming the south corner of Tenter Row, and opposite the eastern wall of St. Luke's Workhouse, are erected the Alms-Houses of the Viscountess Lumley.

It was, together with the estate of Paris Garden itself, anciently part of the possessions of Bermondsey Abbey, and was for some time, &ldquo;with a <hi rend=italics>mill</hi><NOTE N="*"><P>Called elsewhere &ldquo;Widflete mill.&rdquo; It was a <hi rend=italics>drain</hi> windmill, like those in the fens of Cambridgeshire, for draining off the water.</NOTE> and other appurtenances,&rdquo; held of that Monastery by the Knight Templars. It came to the Crown on the Dissolution, and remained part of the royal domains until nearly the middle of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when it was exchanged away by that princess to her cousin, Lord Hunsdon; and was afterward granted, at his request, to Robert Newdigate, and Arthur Fountague. The Manor-house is described in the grant then made, as &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>the mansion-house within the mote;</hi> the gate-house; <num value="4">four</num> pastures, <num value="1">one</num> of which is called Chapel-hall; <num value="2">two</num> pastures ditched about,&rdquo; &amp;c. Thomas Cure, Esq. (buried in St. Saviour's Church, and the founder of certain alms-houses in that parish) afterwards became possessed of this property, and retained it some years. It subsequently was owned by other persons, needless here to mention, until, in the year <datestruct value="1655"><year reg="1655">1655</year></datestruct>, it came into the hands of Richard Taverner and William Angell, who in the following year made a partition, in which Taverner was to have part of the land, and Angell the Manor-house, then called &ldquo;HOLLAND'S LEAGUER,&rdquo; with such of the land as remained. In <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, Angell conveyed the Manor-house and the ground, &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>encompassed with a mote</hi>,&rdquo; containing <num value="1">one</num> acre, to Hugh Jermyn, of Lombard Street, woollen-draper; and in <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>, the same William Angell conveyed other part of the demesne land to trustees, for the erecting of the Church and parish of Christ Church. 
<P>The origin of the name of this place (Holland's Leaguer) seems involved in some obscurity. It does not appear to have been so called in the grant to Newdigate (<num value="20">20</num> Eliz.) just noticed, being there simply designated as the Mansion-house, &amp;c. In the partition of the estate between Taverner and Angell (<datestruct value="1656--"><year reg="1656">1656</year></datestruct>) however, it is named Holland's Leaguer. Mr. Bray (Hist. of Surry) has in part explained the meaning of this appellation, and only in part, by saying, that in a play of Shakerley Marmyon, called Holland's Leaguer (among Garrick's collection of old plays in the British Museum) the plot, if it deserves that name, turns on <num value="1">one</num> of the dramatis person&aelig; observing, that Holland was besieged and <hi rend=italics>beleaguered</hi>, and laying a plan for its defence; and a gallant promising to go to the wars to please a lady; but, instead of that, going to a house where some frail fair ones had lodgings; and which was so well guarded by gates and portcullisses, that it was with some difficulty access was gained. He adds, that allusion is there made to the possible necessity of swimming across the moat, and some other things which agree with the description of the Manor-house. This accounts for half, but no more, of the name. In another work of the same writer, however, called also Holland's Leaguer, and published in <datestruct value="1632--"><year reg="1632">1632</year></datestruct>, the whole name is fully explained, as well as the Manor-house itself described.<NOTE N="*"><P>This professes, according to its title, to be &ldquo;An historical Discourse of the Life and Actions of Donna Britannica Hollandia, the Arch-mistress of the wicked Women of Eutopia.&rdquo; Madam Hollandia, or <hi rend=italics>Holland</hi>, it seems by this, was the name of a noted procuress of the day, who rented the Manorhouse of Paris Garden, and had converted it into a brothel. The tract is principally occupied with an account of the exploits of this lady, whose licentious conduct having at length attracted the notice of the police, a party of peace officers was sent to dispossess her of her strong hold, and bring her before the magistrates. These, on account of the resistance she made, and is described as still making at the publication of the pamphlet, are said to be then besieging or be-<hi rend=italics>leaguering</hi> the place; and hence the name the author has given to it here, and in his play above quoted. It is probable it was afterward (i. e. after <datestruct value="1632--"><year reg="1632">1632</year></datestruct>) called &ldquo;HOLLAND'S LEAGUER,&rdquo; only from this circumstance.</NOTE>

<P>This scarce tract, which has for a frontispiece a view of the House (and of which our Plate is an exact fac-simile copy) though written in a most quaint and rambling style, contains some information as to the then state of the mansion and its neighbourhood, which it is worth while to notice. 
<P>After describing the procuress, Donna Hollandia (see the note below) as having been routed from a former residence, and just escaped from Newgate, he makes her seek for a more convenient place, where she might carry on her profession, which she ultimately finds in the then untenanted and deserted Manor-house of Paris Garden. 
<P>&ldquo;At length she is informed of a place fit for her purpose, beeing wonderous commodiously 
<note type=sum place=marg>Like the Banck Side.</note>
planted for all accommodations:&mdash;It was out of the citie, only divided by a delicate river. There was many handsome buildings, and many hearty neighbours; yet, at the <num value="1">first</num> foundation, it was renowned for nothing so much as for the memory of that famous Amazon, Longa Margarita<NOTE N="*"><P>Or 
<hi rend=italics>Long Meg</hi>&mdash;this was probably <num value="1">one</num> of the old stew-holders on this spot, and a name for its notoriety then still remembered. The whole passage evidently alludes to the ancient brothels on the Bankside.</NOTE>, who had there for many yeeres kept a famous <hi rend=italics>infamous</hi> house of open hospitality. 
<P>&ldquo;Shee no sooner heard this report, but presently turning her sailes, shee made for that coast, where shee found such abundance of naturall and artificiall entrenchments, that even the House seemed to be in itselfe a little city. 
<P>&ldquo;Here shee inquires what strong hold or forte was to be let for yeerly reuenue, and presently 
<note type=sum place=marg>The site of her House.</note>
shee was brought to a fort, citadell, or <hi rend=italics>mansion-house</hi>, so fortified and envyroned with all manner of fortifications, that ere any foe could approach it, hee must march, more than a musketshot, on a narrow <hi rend=italics>banke</hi> (where <num value="3">three</num> could not go on breast) betwixt <hi rend=italics><num value="2">two</num> dangerous ditches;</hi> then enter a port, bulwarked on every side, and crosse immured both before and behind with deepe ditches, a drawbridge and sundry pallysadoes: then another passage in all poynts like the former, sluced with ditches, and baracadoed with strong rampiers; then another ditch of much larger continent than any before spoke of, with same like a circumference, and girded in its armes all the whole mansion.<NOTE N="*"><P>The 
<hi rend=italics>moat</hi> is here meant.</NOTE> Then a world of other bulwarks, rivers, ditches, trenches, and outworkes, which hem'd in the orchards, gardens, base-courts, and inferior offices, making every <num value="1">one</num> capable of a severall fight, and every fight able for many houres to play with an army.&rdquo; 
<P>This description of the Manor-house, abating its figurative and hyperbolical style, agrees tolerably well with the mention of it in the grant to Newdigate, viz. &ldquo;The Mansion-house within the mote, the gate-house, <num value="4">four</num> pastures 
<hi rend=italics>ditched</hi> about,&rdquo; &amp;c. The writer proceeds to notice the neighbourhood, and further identifies the spot by an allusion to the adjoining <hi rend=italics>theatres:</hi>

<P>&ldquo;When she had taken a full survey of this forcelet, and seen how commodious and fit it was for her purpose, shee then inquires what other benefits were appertaining vnto it, as neighbourhood, pleasant walks, concourse of strangers, and things of like nature; in all which shee received full satisfaction: especially, and above all the rest, she was most taken with the report of <num value="3">three</num> famous <hi rend=italics>amphytheators</hi>, which stood so neere scituated, that her eye might take a view of them from her lowest turret:&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> was the <hi rend=italics>Continent of the World</hi>, <NOTE N="*"><P>The GLOBE.</NOTE> because half the yeere a world of beauties and brave spirits resorted vnto it; the other was a building of excellent <hi rend=italics>Hope</hi> <NOTE N="*"><P>The HOPE, or BEAR GARDEN situate at a small distance from the Globe.</NOTE>; and though wild beasts and gladiators did most possesse it, yet the gallants that came to behold those combats, though they were of a mixt society, yet were many noble worthies among them. The last which stood, and as it were <hi rend=italics>shak'd hands with this</hi>
<pb id="p.104" n="104"> 
<hi rend=italics>fortress</hi>, becing in times past as famous as any of the others, was now fallen to decay, and like a dying <hi rend=italics>Swanne</hi>, hanging down her head, seemed to sing her own dierge<NOTE N="*"><P>This was the SWAN THEATRE, which from the above account seems to have been then on the decline as a place of amusement. Its nearness to Holland's Leaguer is significantly described by the phrase of their seeming &ldquo;to shake hands with each other.&rdquo; This was the fact, the Swan standing on the site of the present Falcon Foundery, and Holland's Leaguer being immediately opposite.</NOTE>.&rdquo; 
<P>The rest of this tract is taken up with a list of the ladies, collected at the Mansion for the entertainment of company; a description of the domestics, including the bully or ruffian, named <hi rend=italics>Cerberus</hi>, and an account, finally, of its being besieged or <hi rend=italics>beleaguered</hi> by the police, as before noticed; and which, conveying no useful information, it is needless to repeat. 
<P>The situation of Holland's Leaguer was on part of the present Holland Street, Blackfriars Road, leading to Bankside, which street formed part of the site, and is in Roque's Plan of London, <datestruct value="1746--"><year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct>, called &ldquo;Holland Leger. Some remains of the Mansion itself existed within memory, but the moat had been long filled up.<NOTE N="*"><P>It is shown with the site of the House in Morgan's Plan of London, of a prior date to Roque's Plan just named.</NOTE> Its general form is shown in the print, which also contains some explanatory lines illustrative of the place and its inhabitants. 
<P>From the information of several very old inhabitants of the parish of Christ Church, it appears that the spot of ground called Holland's Leaguer (the site of which is now occupied by Holland Street and its neighbourhood) was an artificial and elevated place, in form an oblong square, surrounded by the tide, which ebbed and flowed from a sluice about <num value="20">twenty</num> feet from the ferry called Cat's Dock, now filled up. The ascent to the place on the west was by a number of mutilated ancient stone steps. Within the space stood a house occupied by <num value="1">one</num> Gascoigne, a hatter, and subsequently by <num value="1">one</num> Philips. Part of the ground was a deposit for rubbish, and from the remains of trees and bushes, appeared to have been a garden. 
<P>Its elevated situation gave it a commanding view of the river Thames, having the Falcon Tavern on the east, and overlooking the houses that stood between it and the waterside. The house was taken down about the time of forming the road to Blackfriars Bridge. 
<P>Adjoining Holland's Leaguer were several public houses of note; viz. the Windmill and Orange Tree, in Paris Garden Lane; the Falcon Tavern <NOTE N="*"><P>See a print of this subject in the former volume of this work.</NOTE> before mentioned; and the Castle still remaining at the bottom of Holland Street. Opposite the Castle were <num value="2">two</num> other houses; <num value="1">one</num> called the Next Boat, the other the Beggar's Bush; the latter being memorable for giving title to the play of that name; and the resort of all the beggars of the time in that neighbourhood. Also a house called the Blue Pump, now standing in Holland Street, and having formerly the sign of a Man (probably a sailor) pumping with all his might, and underneath, the following inscription: &ldquo;Poor Tom's last refuge.&rdquo; 
<P>In a tract called &ldquo;the Paris Garden Medley <NOTE N="*"><P>This tract was, about <num value="40">40</num> years since, in the possession of Mr. Stocks, who has kept the Castle public house <num value="38">38</num> years. To Mr. Stocks, and to Mr. Stanton, who has lived upward of <num value="70">70</num> years in the parish, the publisher is indebted for much information respecting Holland's Leaguer inserted in this account.</NOTE>, or a choice collection of all the songs that were sung at the houses of resort on the Bankside,&rdquo; the chief designation of Holland's Leaguer in the songs and in conversation was that of Nob's Island. 
<P>Opposite the house that stands at the corner of Castle Yard (formerly called Lady Clark's Yard) was a mill-pond, on the site of which stands the glasshouse belonging to Messrs. Pellat and Green. 
<P>John Marshall, Gent. of the Borough of Southwark, by his will dated <datestruct VALUE="1627-08-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> <month reg="08">August</month> <year reg="1627">1627</year></datestruct>, bequeathed the sum of <num value="700">700</num><hi rend=italics>l</hi> for the building of a church in the manor of Paris Garden, in such place as the trustees named in his will (of whom Sir Samuel Brown, late <num value="1">one</num> of the Justices of Common Pleas, was <num value="1">one</num>) should think fit. And William Angel, lord of the manor, by indenture dated <datestruct VALUE="1670-04-1"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=1>1st</day>, <year reg=1670>1670</year></datestruct>, for a consideration therein mentioned, assigned a convenient piece of land within the manor for building the said church with a churchyard. 
<P>The founder endowed his church with <num value="40">40</num><hi rend=italics>l</hi> per annum for the minister, also power to advance it to <num value="60">60</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> The presentation to be in the trustees and their successors for ever. They were also directed by the founder to pay the rents of a certain messuage in Ax Yard, St. Saviour's, of the annual value of <measure value="20bmark" type=currency><num value="20">20</num> marks</measure>, to the said minister and his successors. 
<P>In the reign of King Charles II, on the petition of the inhabitants of Paris Garden, an Act of Parliament was passed for making the manor parochial, by the name of the Parish of Christ Church, agreeably to the will of the founder of the church. An act also vests the ground whereon the church stands, with the churchyard, in the trustees and their heirs for ever. The profits of burials in the church and churchyard (except the vaults made by William Angel) to be applied to the repairs of the church, &amp;c. The rector to receive all tithes, oblations and dues, payable by the inhabitants of Paris Garden. The trustees were also empowered to raise an additional sum of <num value="400">400</num><hi rend=italics>l</hi> out of the estate of Marshall the founder, for completing the new church, and paying to the churchwardens or impropriators of St. Saviour's <num value="100">100</num><hi rend=italics>l</hi> in lieu of tithes or other contributions payable by the inhabitants of the manor. The Act also provides, that no part of the manor of Southwark, or Clink liberty, belonging to the see of Winchester, should be considered within the parish of Christ Church. 
<P>The plan engraved under the view of Holland's Leaguer, exhibits the state of the northern part of the parish of Christ Church, as it appeared between the years <datestruct value="1736--"><year reg=1736>1736</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1746--"><year reg=1746>1746</year></datestruct>; the site of the Leaguer and mote, with the several streams and watercourses intersecting the grounds in its vicinity, forming a striking contrast to the accompanying modern plan, which shows the alteration in the value of property, and the great increase of population in this parish, within the last <num value="70">seventy</num> years. 
<P>It may be worthy of remark, that the celebrated architect Sir Christopher Wren had a house next door to the Falcon Inn, from which he could view at a distance the progress made in building St. Paul's Cathedral. 
<P>In the next new plan of the Parish of Christ Church, Paris Garden Stairs, and Paris Garden Lane, shown in the ancient plan, are occupied by the premises of Mr. Devey, coal-merchant, who has built upon, and closed this avenue, and the whole parish is now covered by Great Surry Street, Nelson Square, and a number of modern streets, consisting of well-built houses, erected within the last <num value="30">thirty</num> years. The avenues leading to the church (see the plate) have been altered and improved. A considerable addition to the burial-ground has recently been made by Act of Parliament, and a very general improvement has taken place in the appearance of this parish. <pb id="p.105" n="105">

<P>An authentic account of the origin of this once-celebrated and depraved place of entertainment and resort, is contained in a letter from James Theobald, Esq. to the Right Hon. Lord Willoughby de Parham, President of the Society of Antiquaries, <datestruct VALUE="1757-05-10"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=10>10th</day>, <year reg=1757>1757</year></datestruct>; which was printed in the Hon. Charles Howard's &ldquo;Historical Anecdotes of some of the Howard Family,&rdquo; London, <num value="17">17</num>C<num value="9">9</num>, <num value="12">12</num>mo. In the account therein of Thomas, Earl of Arundel, the writer states that &ldquo;Arundell House being now to be pulled down, great part of the furniture was removed to Stafford House, with the museum, &amp;c. And as there were many fine statues, bas-relievos, and marbles, they were received into the lower parts of the gardens, and many of them placed under a colonnade there, and the upper part of the ground next the Strand let to builders, who continued the street next the Strand from Temple-bar towards Westminster: and also to build thereon the several streets called Arundell, Norfolk, and Surrey, Streets, leading from the Strand towards the River, as far as the cross street, called Howard Street, which ran parallel with the Strand.<NOTE N="a"><P>&ldquo;An Act of Parliament was obtained to entail that noble estate on the heirs-male of the Norfolk Family, and to exempt it from being charged with either jointures or family debts: and gave a power to the then Duke of Norfolk to let a part of the side of the house and gardens to builders at a reserved ground-rent, which rent was to accumulate, in order to raise a fund for building a mansion-house for the family on that part of the gardens which lay next the river.&rdquo; <hi rend=italics>Anecdotes of the Howard Family</hi>, p. <num value="93">93</num>. The act referred to was entitled &ldquo;An Act for building Arundell House, and the tenements thereunto belonging.&rdquo; Private Acts, <num value="22">22nd</num> and <num value="23">23rd</num> Charles II., <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>. cap. <num value="19">19</num>.</NOTE> When the workmen began to build next the Strand, in order to prevent incroachments, a cross-wall was built to separate the ground let to building from that reserved for the family mansion; and many of the workmen to save the expense of carrying away the rubbish, threw it over this cross-wall, where it fell upon the colonnade, and at last broke it down; and falling on the statues, &amp;c. placed there, broke several of them. A great part of these, in that sad condition, was purchased by Sir William Fermor.&mdash;Some others of these broken statues, not thought worth replacing, were begged by <num value="1">one</num> Boyder Cuper, who had been a servant, I think gardener, in the family; and were removed by him to decorate a piece of garden-ground which he had taken opposite Somerset water-gate, in the Parish of Lambeth,<NOTE N="b"><P>In the Rev. Samuel Denne's &ldquo;Additions to Dr. Ducarel's History of Lambeth,&rdquo; Lond. <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>. <num value="4">4</num>to. p. <num value="394">394</num>. Nichols' &ldquo;Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica,&rdquo; vol. x. it is stated that Cuper was Collector of the Poor for Lambeth, in <datestruct value="1650--"><year reg="1650">1650</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> which at that time was a place of resort for the citizens and others in holyday time, still called after him by the name of Cuper's, and thence corruptly Cupid's Gardens, which were much of the same nature as Sadler's Wells and Marybone Gardens; called also a musickhouse, as they had always music attending, and a large room for dancing when the company were so disposed.&rdquo; Pages <num value="94">94</num>, <num value="95">95</num>, <num value="98">98</num>. The period at which Cuper's Gardens were originally formed, was probably some time <hi rend=italics>after</hi> the year <datestruct value="1682"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct>, since the great Map of London, executed by Thomas Ogilby and William Morgan, published in that year,<NOTE N="c"><P>In the <hi rend=italics>London Gazette</hi> of Mond. <datestruct VALUE="-05-1"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=1>1st</day></datestruct>, and Thurs. <datestruct VALUE="1682-05-4"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=4>4th</day>, <year reg=1682>1682</year></datestruct>, are an announcement of this excellent and beautiful Map as recently completed for sale; with the Royal License granted to Morgan for the sole property of the plan for <num value="14">fourteen</num> years.</NOTE> represents the form of the ground on which they afterwards stood, as a long narrow field surrounded by water-courses, and intersected by a path up the centre, with a few lonely buildings on <num value="1">one</num> side. In the same Map is also shewn &ldquo;the ground for Arundel House,&rdquo; a large vacant square next the river, at the south end of the present Norfolk Street, in the Strand, occupying the whole space between the western side of Surrey Street, and the eastern side of Arundel Street; on which it was intended to erect another Arundel House, though that design was never carried into effect. In the next great Map of the Metropolis, published in the reign of William and Mary by Robert Morden and Philip Lea, the site intended for Arundel House is filled up to the water's edge; whilst that of Cuper's Gardens remains unaltered, excepting that a landing-place from the river is marked &ldquo;Cupitt's Staiers,&rdquo; and <num value="2">two</num> square fields on the east of the narrow meadow are lettered &ldquo;Bowling Greens.&rdquo; These, however, then belonged to Sir Peter Rich, and were divided from Cuper's Gardens by a broad water-course. Even the additions made to this plan by Thomas Jefferys to the year <datestruct value="1732"><year reg="1732">1732</year></datestruct>, do not indicate any other alterations on this spot; but in the separate plan of Lambeth and Christ-Church Parishes, inserted in the Rev. J. Strype's edition of Stow's &ldquo;Survey of London,&rdquo; <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, Volume II. Book vi. Perambulation, page <num value="83">83</num>, the gardens <hi rend=italics>are</hi> indicated, and appear to be disposed in nearly the same order as that represented in the Ground-plan given beneath the <num value="1">first</num> of the annexed Plates, taken from the great survey made by John Rocque and John Pine, in <datestruct value="1746--"><year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct>. Long after these gardens were established, that part of Lambeth on which they stood was the extensive marsh bearing its name, divided by water-courses; the southern bank of the Thames between the boundary of Christ-Church Parish and Stangate, being separated into gardens with dwelling-houses, in a similar manner to those on the opposite shore, though of a much inferior character. <num value="1">One</num> of the gardens adjoining the river, belonged to the Dukes of Norfolk, who also possessed a capital mansion in Lambeth near the Church:<NOTE N="d"><P>It appears that in the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century this property belonged to Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, whose estates, having lapsed to the Crown for want of issue, were given to Thomas de Brotherton, <num value="5">fifth</num> son of Edward I., who made him Earl Marshal of England, and whose half-brother, Edward II., created him Earl of Norfolk. The elegant and learned Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, and his father, resided in Norfolk-House at Lambeth; and Leland states that it was there that he taught the former the Latin language. Thomas Howard, <num value="3">third</num> Duke of Norfolk, had a library at this place, and during his confinement in the Tower under Henry VIII. he petitioned the Lords of the Council to permit him to have some books from his house at Lambeth, without which for a dozen years he had not been able to compose himself to sleep. After the Duke's attainder, Norfolk House was seized for the Crown, and was granted by Edward VI. to William Parr, Marquess of Northampton, being then valued at <num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="10">10</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="10">10</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> per annum. In <datestruct value="1552--"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct> he exchanged it for the Lordship and Manor of Southwark which had belonged to the Bishop of Winchester: but on the reversal of the Duke's attainder, in the <num value="1">first</num> year of Queen Mary, this mansion was restored to him, and in the <num value="1">first</num> year of Elizabeth he sold it to Richard Garth and John Dyster for <num value="400">400</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>
Beside Norfolk House, the same family also possessed a garden adjoining to the river, which in <datestruct value="1636--"><year reg="1636">1636</year></datestruct> was occupied by Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel, with a piece of land called the Prince's Meadow. The former of these appears to have been afterwards Cuper's Gardens, since Mr. Bray was in possession of a plan of part of the Liberty of Paris Garden, on which the ground subsequently occupied by Cuper is called the Earl of Arundel's; and there is a place pointing towards it marked as the Earl of Arundel's Walk, between <num value="2">two</num> rows of trees, apparently entered through a gateway next Lambeth town. If this property were ever connected with Norfolk-House, it must have been reserved when the latter was sold about <datestruct value="1558--"><year reg="1558">1558</year></datestruct>. &ldquo;History and Antiquities of the County of Surrey,&rdquo; by the Rev. Owen Manning and William Bray, Esq. vol. iii.

<P>It appears from the Letter of Mr. Theobald, that the originator of Cuper's Gardens was succeeded by another of the same family, by whom the place was partly despoiled of its chief ornaments: since he observes that the Arundel sculptures continued there &ldquo;for a considerable time, till Mr. John Freeman, of Fawley-Court, near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, and Mr. Edmund Waller, of Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire, happening to see them, and observing something masterly in the designs and drapery of several of them, and that they were fragments of very curious pieces of sculpture, they called on me, who then lived in that neighbourhood, to know if I were acquainted with the then owner of them, Mr. <hi rend=italics>John Cuper</hi>, and, finding I was, desired I would treat with him for them, and left in my hands a bank note of <num value="100">100</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>, with liberty of going as far as that sum. After <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> days meeting I agreed with him for <num value="75">75</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> which I paid him; and soon after the sculptures were divided between the <num value="2">two</num> gentlemen, and sent by them part of them to Fawley-Court, and part to Beaconsfield, where they remain at present.&rdquo;<NOTE N="e"><P>&ldquo;Anecdotes of the Howard Family,&rdquo; pp. <num value="99">99</num>, <num value="100">100</num>.&mdash;Mr. Theobald's Letter also contains an account of the disposition of the other mutilated Arundel Marbles not removed by Cuper. Some of these were at <num value="1">first</num> carried to a piece of ground near the above Gardens let on lease to the Duke of Norfolk; but the person employed by him as agent took the lease in his own name, and let the ground for a timber-yard to <num value="1">one</num> who made a wharf there: and when the foundations of St. Paul's were laid, <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, great quantities of rubbish were brought there to raise the ground, in doing which these fragments were buried, and lay for many years forgotten. About the year <datestruct value="1712"><year reg="1712">1712</year></datestruct> this ground was rented by the father of Mr. Peter Theobald, who, in digging foundations for buildings, met with several fragments, which were taken up and laid on the ground. The Earl of Burlington hearing of them desired to see them, and Mr. Theobald making him the offer of such as he liked, some of them were carried to Chiswick- House, and <num value="1">one</num> bas-relief was inserted in the pedestal of a pillar erected there. Some years after Lord Petre told Mr. Theobald that he had heard from the Duke of Norfolk, that in some part of the ground there were still fragments of the Arundel Collection; and procured the proprietor's consent to make a search for them. There were at length discovered <num value="6">six</num> statues, some of a colossal size, without heads or arms; which trunks were sent to the Duke's seat at Worksop. There were also some few blocks of veined marble, out of which Mr. Theobald endeavoured to cut mantle-pieces and slabs for his house, the Belvidere in Lambeth, over against York Buildings, but the cost exceeded their worth, though some that were cut out were made use of. The fragment of a column, about <num value="6">6</num> feet long and <num value="18">18</num> inches in diameter, he removed to his house at White-Walham in Berkshire and used it as a roller. So late as <datestruct value="1811"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct> Messrs. Lett, who occupied a timber-yard here as successors to Mr. Peter Theobald, in making a dock, dug up a colossal female figure and other fragments. &ldquo;Anecdotes of the Howard Family,&rdquo; pp. <num value="100">100</num>, <num value="106">106</num>. &ldquo;History of Surrey,&rdquo; vol. iii. p. <num value="481">481</num>.</NOTE> It will be seen, however, by a subsequent notice of Cuper's Gardens in <datestruct value="1753--"><year reg="1753">1753</year></datestruct> that they were not even then entirely despoiled of their original ancient sculptures; <pb id="p.106" n="106"> and in &ldquo;The Natural History and Antiquities of Surrey,&rdquo; by John Aubrey, London, <datestruct value="1719--"><year reg="1719">1719</year></datestruct>, <num value="8">8</num>vo. volume v. pages <num value="282">282</num>, <num value="284">284</num>, are <num value="8">eight</num> plates representing some of the mutilated statues and busts referred to by Theobald, with a description. It is there observed that they had received very ill usage from the ignorance and stupidity of those who knew not their value; and were still exposed to the open air and folly of passers-by. The author adds that he would have given a more particular account of these and other antiquities, &ldquo;had the son of the person who rents the Gardens, and pretends much knowledge of these hidden treasures, been pleased to have given the world an account; but his own folly and timorousness, and avarice together shut his mouth, that not a word of intelligence could be extorted from him: for as he said he understood that he should not get anything, so he would not lose his breath for nothing.&rdquo;<NOTE N="a"><P>Impressions of Aubrey's plates of these sculptures, formed into <num value="4">four</num> in quarto, were published in Ducarel's &ldquo;Hist. of Lambeth,&rdquo; p. <num value="78">78</num>.</NOTE>

<P>Perhaps the earliest descriptive notice of Cuper's Gardens is that given in Edward Hatton's &ldquo;New View of London,&rdquo; <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, <num value="8">8</num>vo. volume ii, page <num value="785">785</num>; which states that they appear to be opposite Somerset Stairs, and that &ldquo;here are pleasant gardens and walks, with bowling-greens, &amp;c. whither many of the westerly part of the town resort for diversion in the summer season.<NOTE N="b"><P>The following is Aubrey's notice of this place. &ldquo;Near the bank side lyes a very pleasant garden, in which are fine walks, known by the name of <hi rend=italics>Cupid's Gardens.</hi>
They are the estate of Jesus College, in Oxford, and erected by <num value="1">one</num> who keeps a publick-house; which, with the conveniency of its arbours, walks, and several remains of Greek and Roman Antiquity, have made this place much frequented.&rdquo; Tab. II. of Aubrey's Plates is entitled in Latin, &ldquo;This and the <num value="6">six</num> plates following exhibit certain fragments preserved in a garden near Lambeth.&rdquo;</NOTE> Near these stairs on the river lies at anchor, excepting in the winter, &ldquo;The Royal Diversion,&rdquo; commonly called &ldquo;The Folly,&rdquo; perhaps from the foolish things there sometime acted. It is a timber building erected on a strong barge, where used to be the entertainments of musick, &amp;c. It takes its name from the late Queen Mary the <num value="2">Second</num>, who they say once honoured it by her presence.&rdquo;<NOTE N="c"><P>A representation of this vessel will be found in the View of Whitehall in the time of James II. published in the <num value="1">first</num> volume of this work; and it is also shewn in a view of Somerset House by L. Knyff, taken from the river about <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, contained in the &ldquo;<num value="60">Sixty</num> Additional Plates to I. T.

It consisted of a flat barge or raft, sustaining a wooden edifice with several apartments, large windows along the side, <num value="4">four</num> turrets at the angles, and a platform on the top surrounded by a ballustrade. The original design of it was to be a Musical Aquatic Summer House, and it was at <num value="1">first</num> visited by persons of quality for both refreshment and pleasure; but its character appears to have been always equivocal, and it became at length entirely possessed by courtesans, and a receptacle for drinking and promiscuous dancing of the most dissolute persons. It was then suppressed by the Magistrates, the vessel was suffered to fall into decay, and at last the materials of it were consumed for firewood.</NOTE> It is probable that the <num value="1">first</num> improvement of the Gardens is that announced in the <hi rend=italics>Daily Advertiser</hi> of Tuesday, <datestruct VALUE="1738-03-28"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=28>28th</day>, <year reg=1738>1738</year></datestruct>;<NOTE N="d"><P>An erroneous conjecture has been formed that Cuper's Gardens were the same place with Belvidere House, Lambeth, mentioned in the ensuing advertisement from <hi rend=italics>The Freethinker</hi> of <datestruct VALUE="1781-04-28"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=28>28th</day>, <year reg=1781>1781</year></datestruct>; but it will be seen that the place so named was considerably higher up the river, added to which the mansion belonged to Mr. Theobald at the time the Gardens were open and flourishing. &ldquo;This to give notice to the Nobility and Gentry of both sexes, that Charles Bascom is newly settled in the house called Belvidere upon the river <hi rend=italics>over against York Buildings:</hi> where there are pleasant gardens and variety of fish-ponds.

The old Duchess of Marlborough would have retained him with a pension, but he would not endure confinement, and was engaged by <num value="1">one</num> Evans, who kept a home-brewed alehouse of great resort, known by the sign of the Hercules Pillars, opposite Clifford's Inn Passage in Fleet-street, and performed in a great room upstairs during the winter season. He played extempore voluntaries, fugues in the sonatas and concertos of Corelli; as also most of his solos, and many of Mr. Handel's opera songs with exquisite neatness and elegance. He also played on the violin, and on that instrument imitated so exactly the irregular intonation, mixed with sobs and pauses of a quaker's sermon, that none could hear him and refrain from immoderate laughter. The man of the house dying, his widow took Cuper's Gardens, and erected therein an orchestra and organ, intending it as a place of entertainment for the summer evenings, like Vauxhall, with the addition of fireworks. It subsisted for <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> summers, but failing at length, Jones, who was supported by her all the time, was turned adrift, and about the year <datestruct value="1738"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct>, or very probably several years later, died.

<P>It is believed by Dr. Ducarel that the estate comprising Cuper's Gardens was given by the Howard Family to Jesus College, Oxford, which possesses <num value="3">three</num> acres of land here, whereon many of the buildings of Messrs.

Part of the ground required for the south approach to the Strand, now called Waterloo Bridge, was the site of Cuper's Gardens, belonging to Messrs. Beaufoy; the value of whose short lease, and the loss occasioned by removing their old works and establishing others, was estimated by a jury at about <num value="36000">36,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> On their removal to South Lambeth about <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, the building represented in the Plates was taken down, and the Waterloo Road, <num value="60">sixty</num> feet in width, was cut through the <num value="3">three</num> acres which they had occupied and the centre of Cuper's Gardens, towards the Obelisk.<NOTE N="g"><P>By the formation of this road about an acre was left between it and the other hand of the Prince of Wales, which also became his property, that his land might have a frontage to the road which without it he would not have possessed. The Strand Bridge Company was also to make a cross-road from Stamford Street over the Prince's Meadew to the Surrey New Road, through the New Inn Stables at the foot of Westminster Bridge, to nearly opposite Astley's Theatre. <hi rend=italics>Ibid.</hi> This is the present York Road.</NOTE> The erection of Waterloo Bridge was also the cause of a total and most important alteration in this part of Lambeth, by the formation of numerous new roads at a very considerable elevation above the level of the ancient marsh, instead of the circuitous and inconvenient way called Narrow Wall; the contrast of which may be more accurately observed in the Plan annexed, wherein are exhibited those modern improvements, with the disposition of the roads and neighbourhood in <datestruct value="1746--"><year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct>. A farther improvement here was the erection of <num value="1">one</num> of the new Churches appropriated to the Parish of Lambeth, on the eastern side of the Waterloo Road, beyond the southern extremity of Cuper's Gardens; a representation of which building is also given on the <num value="1">first</num> of the annexed Plates. The site of this edifice having been a marsh and a large piece of water, a foundation of piles was made which occupied <num value="3">three</num> months; but the <num value="1">First</num> Stone was laid by the Archbishop of Canterbury, <datestruct VALUE="1823-06-30"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=30>30th</day>, <year reg=1823>1823</year></datestruct>, and the Church was consecrated by the Bishop of Winchester, on Wednesday, <datestruct VALUE="-11-23"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=23>23</day></datestruct>d, <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>. It was dedicated to St. John the Evangelist, was erected from the designs of Mr. E. Bedford, and the estimated expense of it was <num value="18191">18,191</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="5">5</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>; the interior being capable of accomodating <num value="2032">2032</num> persons. The structure itself is in the form of a parallelogram, erected of brick with stone dressings, and the whole of the western end is occupied by a portico, with <num value="6">six</num> Greek Doric columns, supporting an entablature, cornice, and <pb id="p.110" n="110"> pediment of the same, with wreaths of myrtle in the frieze. Within the portico the western end is guarded by ant&aelig;, or double pilasters, at the angles, and is divided into <num value="2">two</num> stories by a plain stone band: in the lower division there are <num value="5">five</num> door-ways, and above as many corresponding windows, <num value="4">four</num> of which are blank and the centre glazed. The north and south sides are also both divided into <num value="2">two</num> stories, each containing <num value="6">six</num> square arched windows below, and the same number of lofty windows above: the eastern end is divided by ant&aelig; into <num value="3">three</num> divisions also parted into <num value="2">two</num> stories with a window in the centre, and terminated by an entablature and pediment. The elevation of the steeple consists of a square tower and spire; the lower story being of regular stone courses containing the clock; that above it of <num value="2">two</num> Ionic columns and ant&aelig;, enclosing an arched window in each face; the <num value="3">third</num> open with other columns and pilasters; and the <num value="4">fourth</num> an obelisk rising from a base and surmounted by a globe and cross. Around the whole exterior of this building is a wide terrace, which was required to fill up the space between the church and the new road elevated to the level of Waterloo Bridge; the whole of which area is laid out in catacombs.<NOTE N="a"><P>A description of this Church by Mr. E. J. Carlos, with a view, is inserted in the &ldquo;Gentleman's Magazine&rdquo; for <datestruct VALUE="1827-05--"><month reg="05">May</month> <year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, vol. xcvii. part <num value="1">1</num>. p. <num value="390">390</num>.</NOTE>

<P>In the centre of the site of Cuper's Gardens, and also on the eastern side of the Waterloo Road, stands the Royal Infirmary for Children, established by the late Dr. J. B. Davis, in <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, and erected in <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, which the benevolent Founder did not live to see completed. On the eastern side of the Waterloo Bridge, the Plan shews the situation of the ancient sluice by which the streams of numerous water-courses for draining this part of the extensive level of Lambeth Marsh, were collected and discharged into the Thames. Near the same spot, the Plan indicates the site of the old Tavern of the Feathers, belonging to Cuper's Gardens, represented in the <num value="3">third</num> of the present Views. During the erection of the Waterloo Bridge it was used for the pay-table of the labourers employed there, by which the proprietor realized so large a property, as to enable him about <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>, to erect the very lofty edifice called the New Feathers; which stands <num value="3">three</num> stories on the ground below the Bridge, and rises <num value="2">two</num> stories above the level of the Wateroo Road. The site of the old Feathers is now (<datestruct VALUE="1834-05--"><month reg="05">May</month> <year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>) a timber-yard, close to the eastern side of the <num value="1">first</num> land-arch of the Waterloo Bridge; and beside it is a private dwelling-house used as the tavern when the original building was <num value="1">first</num> removed. In concluding these notices it may be observed that the Plan also shews Curtis's Halfpenny Hatch, near Vine street, Lambeth, for the convenience of passengers going from that place to Southwark. In Glover's Hatch, somewhat more to the south, the celebrated comedian Parsons had a summer retreat which he called Frog Hall, but the site of all these places is now entirely obliterated; and the whole of the old wooden houses on the western side of the Bridge, forming Lime Tree and Swan Courts, have been removed, and a spacious opening made called the Belvidere Road leading into Pedlar's Acre. <pb id="p.111" n="111">

<P>IT is probable that the earliest public pleasure gardens established near London, were those attached to the many springs of mineral-water surrounding the Metropolis, called Wells. They seem to have appeared <num value="1">first</num> at the time that every kind of dramatic amusement was in the lowest state of depression; and to have gradually advanced from places devoted to medicinal purposes, to those of general and crowded resort, entertainment, dissipation, and depravity. This progress was evidently both easy and natural. As exercise was required for those who came to drink the waters, the houses of the various Wells had always a piece of ground attached to them, which was planted either as a lawn or garden for a promenade; but these being improper for the many showery days occurring in the season for taking the waters, most of the Springs had also a large room erected for the same purpose upon the increase of their patients. As the greater number of those visitors attended on certain days only, when they not unfrequently took breakfast at the taverns of the Wells, by way of receiving the waters at the best time, early in the morning;&mdash; <num value="1">one</num> or more of such days in every week gradually became distinguished as public-breakfast mornings, from their full attendance. At these times the proprietors at length ventured to introduce music, and ultimately dancing, as the age and manners became less rigid; for the attractions of others besides those who came for the benefit of their health, of whom a small sum was required for admission, instead of the stated subscription or payment for drinking the waters. This entertainment was afterwards increased, by its extension to the evenings of the public days; when the gardens were illuminated, a short concert and ball were added, and sometimes a display of fireworks. To these mixed places of resort, appear to have suceeded those gardens the entertainments of which were almost entirely of the latter character; some of the earliest of them being the Spring-Gardens, Vauxhall, and Cuper's Gardens: an account of both of which will be found in the present work. The attractions of the former still continue; but the amusements of the latter appear to have terminated in the year <datestruct value="1759"><year reg="1759">1759</year></datestruct>, and its decline was in all probability the cause of the establishment of Finch's Grotto Gardens, since a notice of their being opened occurs in the public prints of the year following. 
<P>The very name of this once-attractive place of resort is at the present time almost unknown; and as it appears scarcely ever to have been indicated in the maps of the Metropolis, its extent is to be ascertained rather from the directions contained in the advertisements of it,<NOTE N="a"><P>&ldquo;A boat to be had any hour of the Night, at the Falcon, near Blackfriars' Bridge; and the Coach-way is by Blackman Street.&rdquo; <datestruct value="1766--"><year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct>.&mdash;&ldquo;Such Gentlemen and Ladies as chuse to come by water, will please to observe that Mason's Stairs are the nearest to the Gardens.

The ensuing entirely original account, however, was communicated to the late Mr. Wilkinson more than <num value="10">ten</num> years since, from more than <num value="1">one</num> person well acquainted with the place and its history, especially from <num value="1">one</num> of Finch's Waiters, then upwards of <num value="80">eighty</num> years of age; and it has been altogether amplified by materials and information equally authentic. The principal site of Finch's Grotto Gardens, appears to have been a triangular piece of land forming the western side of St. George's Street, Southwark; and bounded on the south by the road called Dirty Lane, and on the north by a vinegar-yard in Lombard-street, and the extremity of St. Saviour's Parish.<NOTE N="b"><P>The Gardens are stated to have extended from the corner of Suffolk Street to Gravel Lane; and to have occupied the ground forming the garden of St. Saviour's Workhouse, erected in <datestruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></datestruct>, with that of the residence of the late John Harris, Esq. <hi rend=italics>History and Antiquities of the Parish of St. Saviour</hi>, by M.

The name was partly derived from that of the proprietor, a Herald-Painter, who inherited the house and grounds from an aunt named Topham; and partly from a Grotto which he made over a medicinal spring of some reputation, which rose in the grounds not far from the house. In the centre of the Grotto was a fountain playing over artificial embankments, and forming a natural and beautiful cascade; the whole spot being planted with ever-greens and shrubs, whilst lofty trees were dispersed through the other parts of the gardens. Towards the northern extremity stood an orchestra, containing an organ built by Pike, of Bloomsbury; and there was also a large octagonal music-room, for the promenade and concert on wet evenings, elegantly decorated with paintings and festoons of flowers: on <num value="1">one</num> side of it was erected an orchestra, which did not come forward into the room. The gardens likewise contained a long range of tea-rooms On the front of the tavern attached to the Gardens, appeared the words &ldquo;Licensed Pursuant to Act of Parliament, <num value="25">Twenty-fifth</num> of King George the <num value="2">Second</num>;&rdquo; and in such reputation was this house, that the <num value="2">two</num> Members of Parliament for Southwark used to give at it their annual dinner to their constituents. The Borough Assembly was also held there during the winter, when the organ was removed from the orchestra into the great room above and occasional singing introduced; whilst card-tables were laid out in another apartment. A lodge of Free-Masons, and a Club composed of the most respectable persons of the vicinity, were likewise established at the Grotto-house. Such being the imperfect description of this place now preserved, the ensuing are some particulars of the entertainments there, derived from the contemporaneous public prints.

<P>An enlarged representation of the stone and inscription is given beneath the present View; and the original, after having remained for some time in the possession of a respectable tradesman of the neighbourhood, was in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct> used as a step in the yard of the house of Mrs. Stevens, near the site of the Gardens, the verse being then almost illegible. Until after the year <datestruct value="1787"><year reg="1787">1787</year></datestruct>, Finch's Grotto Gardens remained in nearly a perfect state, though entirely closed, the music-room being converted into a mill, and kept by a person named Neale; and it was also used as an armoury for the Southwark Volunteers. The neighbourhood of the Grotto, having become infamous for the many depredations committed there, the landlord of this house changed the name of the sign from the Grotto to the Goldsmiths' Arms, in the hope of removing the disrepute attached to it. A succeeding tenant, however, upon learning the character it formerly possessed, resumed the original name under the title of &ldquo;The Old Grotto New Reviv'd,&rdquo; as exhibited in the annexed View: but when that public-house was removed for the formation of the Southwark Bridge Road in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, another landlord re-named it the Goldsmiths' Arms. The new house so called stands at a short distance on the western side of the road, more upon the site of the Gardens, but possesses only a small confined yard paved with red brick. There is still, however, a long piece of ground formerly occupied by the Gardens behind it, on which several small and inferior wooden cottages were made out of a range of tea-rooms, destroyed in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>. At the end of this line in <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct> was remaining a very large and old mulberry-tree; and beyond the gardens attached to those miserable dwellings was a water-course, derived from Loman's Pond, and dividing them from a field occupied only by dust and rubbish. The latter was the chief site of the Gardens of Finch's Grotto, the water being probably crossed by light ornamental wooden bridges, similar to those built over the Fleet in the gardens of Bagnigge Wells; and the extent of the ground occupied at this place might be discovered by a regular line of trees planted across the field to the north-west, behind the workhouse of St. Saviour's Parish and the residence of the late John Harris, Esq. returned M.P. for Southwark in <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>. <pb id="p.115" n="115">

<P>The tradition of the Tower is, that the Sculpture, of which our Engraving is a reduced fac-simile, is the Autograph of the unfortunate ANNA BOULLEN. It appears in the Hall of the Regalia House, upon a large and massive stone. The Arms, beneath, have so completely crumbled away, as to be utterly inexplicable. We observe, however, that this ill-fated Lady, even in her prison hours, indulged her affection toward the cruel HENRY; of which this Inscription presents a touching and melancholy proof. Her own name is joined with his initial, and the Rose and Thistle, the emblems of his sovereignty.

<P>After the execution of the Rebel Lords, KILMARNOCK, BALMERINO, and LOVAT, their remains were buried in the Tower Chapel, very near the great door. For several years the exact spot of their interment was unknown, though, as has been said, it long continued an object of curiosity. A stone, cut with <num value="2">two</num> ovals and <num value="1">one</num> lozenge, was observed on the pavement of the chapel; but none understood its meaning, till a few years ago, when, on opening a grave in that spot, <num value="3">three</num> <hi rend=italics>Coffin-plates</hi> were found, inscribed with the names of these unfortunate Lords. The mystery of the stone was then developed; the <num value="2">two</num> <hi rend=italics>ovals</hi> denoted the interment of Lords Kilmarnock and Balmerino, and the <hi rend=italics>square</hi> that of Lord Lovat. Not any trace of coffins or bones could be found; and Lovat's plate, which is of <hi rend=italics>lead</hi>, is almost consumed with damp and time. The other <num value="2">two</num> are of pewter. 
<P>It is observable, that the line drawn through the ovals appears to have ended there, and to have been subsequently lengthened for the addition of the lozenge. Lovat was executed some months after his ill-fated confederates.

<P>Without attempting to decide, or even to enter into, the discussion as to whether the Papists were the real authors of the Great Fire in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>; or whether it broke out from some obscure and unintended cause, and, aided by an extraordinarily dry season, a favourable wind, narrow streets, and wooden buildings, by the permission of Providence spread its ravages over the whole City:&mdash;without attempting to determine this, it will be most consistent with the limits of the present work, to state that this splendid Column was erected by the celebrated Sir Christopher Wren, to commemorate that destruction, under the belief that it was entirely attributable to the emissaries of the Church of Rome. Perhaps the earliest notice of the Monument now extant, is contained in the Act of Parliament for the Rebuilding of London, <num value="19">19th</num> Charles II., <datestruct value="1667--"><year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>, Chap. <num value="3">3</num>, Sect. xxix.; entitled, &ldquo;A Pillar to be set up in memory of the Fire.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;And the better to preserve the memory of this dreadful visitation, be it farther enacted, that a Column or Pillar of brass or stone, be erected, on, or as near unto the place where the said Fire so unhappily began, as conveniently may be, in perpetual remembrance thereof; with such an Inscription thereon, as hereafter by the Mayor and Court of Aldermen in that behalf be directed.&rdquo;&mdash;By the Act of the <num value="22">22nd</num> of Charles II., <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>, Chap. <num value="11">11</num>., Sect. lxiii., Art. <num value="15">15</num>, the Parishes of St. Magnus, London Bridge, and St. Margaret, New Fish Street, are ordered to be united; and the site of the latter Church was fixed upon, on the eastern side of Fish Street Hill, as the spot where the intended Monument should stand, on account of its immediate vicinity to that where the Fire commenced, part of it being only about <num value="130">130</num> feet distant. 
<P>In the year following this stupendous work was begun, as it is stated in the inscription upon the Pillar itself; and recorded in the MS. memoranda of the Wren family, belonging to and cited by Mr. Elmes: &ldquo;<datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct> ad <datestruct value="1677--"><year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>, Structuram Column&aelig; Coloss&aelig; speculatori&aelig; Londinensis, ex Ordine Dorico, inchoavit et perficit.&rdquo;<NOTE N="a"><P><hi rend=italics>Memoirs of the Life and Works of Sir Christopher Wren; with a brief view of the Progress of Architecture in England, from the beginning of the reign of Charles I to the end of the</hi> <num value="17">17</num><hi rend=italics>th Century; with an Appendix of Authentic Documents.</hi> By Jas.

To remedy this want Sir Christopher Wren had already laid a complaint before the King in Council, and a proclamation was issued dated Whitehall, <datestruct VALUE="1669-05-4"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=4>4th</day>, <year reg=1669>1669</year></datestruct>, prohibiting the exportation of any more stone from the Isle of Portland, without his permission as Surveyor-General.&rdquo;<NOTE N="b"><P>Ibid. p. <num value="269">269</num>, and note &Dagger;.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Parentalia: or Memoirs of the Family of the Wrens.</hi> Compiled by Christopher, son of the Architect, and published by his grandson, Stephen Wren, Esq.

<P>The Act of Parliament already cited shews that the form of a Column was always proposed to be that of the memorial of the Great Fire; but many alterations were made from the original design and model, and even from those appointed to be executed, in the course of its erection. Such subsequent improvements were usual in the works of Sir Christopher Wren; and none of his previous designs appear to have been equal to the present Monument. In the collection of his Drawings in the Library of All Souls' College, Oxford, is <num value="1">one</num> of this edifice, which represents it with flames of gilded bronze issuing from the apertures of the shaft, in the manner of the Roman Rostral Columns, the apex being surmounted by a phenix of the same. It is well known also, that the architect once proposed to erect on the summit a colossal gilded brass statue of Charles II.;<NOTE N="c"><P>As founder of the new City, in the manner of the Roman columns which terminated in statues of the C&aelig;sars. Another figure proposed by Sir Christopher Wren for the summit of the Monument was that of a female &ldquo;crowned with turrets, holding a sword, and cap of maintenance, with other ensigns of the City's grandeur and re-erection.&rdquo; 
<hi rend=italics>Parentalia</hi>, <num value="322">322</num>.&mdash;There was a large whole-sheet engraving of the former design published by Sir Christopher's son, entitled, &ldquo;Columna Londinensis: Qu&acirc; Sol Majorem non vidit.&mdash;Inter admiranda artis Patern&aelig; Monumenta Monumentum Aere perennius, Aereis formis (quo lati&ugrave;s innotescat) adumbrari curavit Christophorus &agrave; Christophoro Wren.&rdquo; N. Hawksmoor, Delin. <datestruct value="1723--"><year reg="1723">1723</year></datestruct>. H. Hulseberg, Sculps. In this print the cippus of the column is surmounted by a figure of Charles II. in a Roman habit, with the present termination represented on a scroll suspended at the side: the former being described in the Latin references as the statue of King Charles, designed according to the judgment of the architect; and the latter as a badly-turned brazen urn set upon the Column, and forced upon the architect in opposition to his wish. Small figures of the Monument and Trajan's Pillar for comparison of their relative size appear upon a terrace in the back ground.

A flaming urn for the top of the Monument.&mdash;No. <num value="72">72</num>. A broad urn, or sarcophagus, at the corners of which are dragons supporting the City arms, and in the centre side appear the Royal arms and supporters, all in rich cartouchshields, somewhat resembling those which are carved above the square base of the present Monument.&mdash;No. <num value="73">73</num>. A square pyramidal column rising out of flames with the City dragons, on a broad urn-shaped, or sarcophagus, base.&mdash;No. <num value="74">74</num>.

The iron-work of the gallery represents thunderbolts.&mdash;No. <num value="78">78</num>. A large pen-drawing of the whole of the present Monument, very carefully executed, on a scale of <num value="5">five</num> feet to an inch. The gallery is plain, and the top is crowned with a globe having <num value="4">four</num> flames issuing from the sides, and <num value="5">five</num> more above.&mdash;Another design is mentioned in the <hi rend=italics>Parentalia</hi>, p. <num value="322">322</num>, consisting of a pillar of somewhat less proportion than that which was erected, &ldquo;viz.&rdquo; says that work, &ldquo;<num value="14">14</num> feet in diameter, and after a peculiar device: for as the Romans expressed by relievo on the pedestals and round the shafts of their columns, the history of such actions and incident as were intended to be thereby commemorated; so this monument of the conflagration and resurrection of London was represented by a pillar in flames; the flames blazing from the loopholes of the shaft, which were to give light to the stairs within, were figured in brass-work gilt, and on the top was a phenix rising from her ashes of brass gilt likewise.&rdquo; A whole-sheet engraving of probably this design was executed by Hulseberg, and &ldquo;Printed for Samuel Harding in St. Martin's Lane,&rdquo; &amp;c., representing a pillar, with a single long flame blazing upward from every loophole. The gallery is surrounded by a rail formed of fireballs and thunderbolts, and it encloses a square cippus crowned with a broad urn and a phenix rising out of fire. On the base is a sheet or mantle stretched out, with a representation of the burning of London; and on each side of the plate are compartments containing small figures of the Trajan Pillar and Rostral Column of Duilius.</NOTE> some curious particulars concerning which are contained in the following document, the original of which is in the possession of Mr. William Upcott, of the London Institution. <pb id="p.118" n="118"> 
<P>&ldquo;In pursuance of an Order of the Comittee for City Landes, I doe heerwith offer the severall designes, which some monthes since, shewed His Majestie for his approbation, who was then pleased to thinke a large Ball of metall gilt would be most agreeable, in regard it would giue an Ornament to the Town, at a very great distance; not that His Majestie disliked a Statue; and if any proposal of this sort be more acceptable to the City, I shall most readily represent the same to his Majestie. 
<P>&ldquo;I cannot but commend a large Statue, as carrying much dignitie with it; and that which would be more vallewable in the eyes of Forreiners and strangers. It hath been proposed to cast such an <num value="1">one</num> in Brasse of <num value="12">twelve</num> foot high for <num value="1000">1000</num>lbs. I hope (if it be allowed) we may find those who will cast a figure for that mony of <num value="15">fifteen</num> foot high, which will suit the greatnesse of the Pillar, and is (as I take it) the largest at this day extant, and this would undoubtedly bee the noblest finishing that can be found answerable to soe goodly a worke, in all men's judgements. 
<P>&ldquo;A Ball of Copper, <num value="9">nine</num> foot diameter, cast in several peeces with the Flames and gilt, may be well done, with the iron-worke and fixing, for <num value="350">350</num>lbs; and this will be the most acceptable of any thing inferior to a Statue, by reason of the good appearance at a distance, and because <num value="1">one</num> may goe up into it; and upon occasion use it for fireworkes. 
<P>&ldquo;A Ph&oelig;nix was at <num value="1">first</num> thought of, and is the ornament in the wooden modell of the pillar, which I caused to be made, before it was begun; but upon <num value="2">second</num> thoughtes I rejected it, because it will be costly, not easily understood at that highth, and worse understood at a distance; and, lastly, dangerous, by reason of the sayle the spread winges will carry in the winde. 
<P>&ldquo;The Belcony must be made of substantiall, well-forged worke, there being no need, at that distance, of filed worke; and I suppose, (for I cannot exactly guesse the weight) it may be well performed and fixed, according to a good designe, for <num value="4">four</num> score and <num value="10">ten</num> poundes, including painting.

Towards the labours and fortunes of the Citizens it was fatal, but harmless towards their lives: That it might in all things resemble the Last Conflagration of the World. 
<P>The destruction was rapid; for within a short space of time the same City was seen most flourishing and reduced to nothing. 
<P>On the <num value="3">Third</num> Day, when this fatal Fire had baffled all human counsels and endeavours, it stopped as it were by a command from Heaven, and was on every side extinguished.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>But the Papistical fury which so execrably achieved it is not yet quenched.</hi>

<emph>ON THE SOUTH SIDE.</emph>

<P>Charles the <num value="2">Second</num>, Son of Charles the Martyr, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, a most gracious Prince, commiserating the deplorable condition of all things, whilst the ruins were yet smoking, provided for the comfort of his Citizens, and the ornament of his City; remitted their taxes, and referred the petitions of the Magistrates and people of London to the Parliament, which immediately passed an Act that the Public Works should be restored to greater beauty with the Public Money, to be raised by an impost upon coals: that the Churches, and the Cathedral of St. Paul, should be rebuilt from their foundations, with all magnificence; that Bridges, Gates, and Prisons, should be newly made; the Conduits improved; the Streets made straight and regular; such as were steep levelled, and those which were too narrow widened; and the markets and shambles moved away into other open places. It was also appointed that every house should be enclosed with intervening party-walls, and the whole raised of equal height in front; that the walls should be all consolidated of squared stone or brick; and that none should delay building beyond the space of <num value="7">seven</num> years: care was likewise taken to prevent by the law all suits which might arise concerning their boundaries. Anniversary Prayers were also enjoined; and, to perpetuate the memory hereof to endless posterity, THIS COLUMN WAS ERECTED. 
<P>The work was carried on with diligence, LONDON HATH RISEN AGAIN; and it is doubtful whether with greater Speed or Beauty&mdash;for the space of <num value="3">three</num> years saw that FINISHED, which was believed to be the labour of an age.

<P>The English Inscription which charged the Papists with the burning of London, and which formed <num value="1">one</num> continued line round the top of the plinth,&mdash;will be found on the Plate already mentioned. Another Inscription of a similar kind, but still more violent, was the following, which was cut in stone against a house on the eastern side of Pudding Lane, on the site of that where the Fire originally commenced. 
<P>&ldquo;Here, by the Permission of Heaven, Hell broke loose upon this Protestant City, from the malicious Hearts of barbarous Papists, by the Hand of their Agent Hubert, who confessed, and on the Ruins of this Place declared the Fact, for which he was hanged, viz.

<P><num value="1">One</num> of the earliest criticisms on the Monument was the following written by the architect's friend, the amiable John Evelyn in his <hi rend=italics>Discourse of Medals</hi>, Lond. <datestruct value="1697--"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct>, page <num value="162">162</num>. &ldquo;Our late discoveries of new worlds, and conflicts at sea; the sanglant battles that have been fought on land; the fortitude and sufferings of an excellent Prince; the Restoration of his successor; the Conflagration and Re-edifying of the greatest City of the world in less than <num value="20">twenty</num> years, (which had been near <num value="2000">2000</num> years in building, nor then half so vast, &amp;c.);&mdash; call aloud for their Medals apart. We yet see in medal none of the Column erected in memory of that dreadful Fire, the biggest and highest all Europe has to shew; and infinite pity &lsquo;tis, that it had not been set up where the Incendium and burning ceased, like a Jupiter Stator, rather than where it fatally began,&mdash;not only in regard of the eminency of the ground, but for the reason of the thing; since it was intended as a grateful monument and recognition to Almighty God for its <hi rend=italics>extinction</hi>, and should therefore have been placed where the devouring flames ceased and were overcome, more agreeably to the stately trophy, than where they <num value="1">first</num> took fire and broke out; and where a plain lugubrious marble, with some opposite inscription, had perhaps more properly become the occasion. But this was over ruled, and I beg excuse for this presumption, though I question not that I have the architect himself on my side; whose rare and extraordinary talent, and what he has performed of great and magnificent, this Column, and what he is still about, and advancing under his direction, will speak and perpetuate his memory, as long as <num value="1">one</num> stone remains upon another in this nation.&rdquo;&mdash;The same author in the dedication of his <hi rend=italics>Account of Architects and Architecture</hi>, Lond. <datestruct value="1697--"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct>, folio, addressed to Wren, says that &ldquo;if the whole art of building were lost, it might be recovered and found again in St. Paul's, the <hi rend=italics>Historical Pillar</hi>, and those other monuments of your happy talent and extraordinary genius.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The Monument,&rdquo; says a later Critic, &ldquo;is undoubtedly the noblest modern column in the world; nay in some respects it may vie with those celebrated ones of antiquity, which are consecrated to the names of Trajan and Antonine. Nothing could be more bold and surprising, nothing more beautiful and harmonious. The Bas-relief at the base, allowing for some few defects, is finely imagined and executed as well; and nothing material can be cavilled with, but the inscriptions round about it. Nothing, indeed, can be more ridiculous than its situation, unless it be the reason which is assigned for it. I am of opinion that if it had been raised where Cheapside Conduit stood it would have been as effectual as a remonstrance of the misfortune it is designed to record, and would have added an inexpressible beauty to the vista, and received as much as it gave.&rdquo;<NOTE N="a"><P><hi rend=italics>A Critical Review of the Public Buildings in and about London and Westminster.</hi> (By James Ralph.)

It would appear from No. <num value="69">69</num> of the designs of the monument described in a preceding note, that there was some intention of erecting a memorial of the fire in Cheapside. The following farther account of this proposed pillar there, is found in the <hi rend=italics>Magn&aelig; Britanni&aelig; Notitia, or the Present State of Great Britain</hi>, by John Chamberlayne, <num value="29">29th</num> Edition, Lond. <datestruct value="1728--"><year reg="1728">1728</year></datestruct>. <num value="8">8</num>vo. part <num value="1">1</num>. Book iii. p. <num value="251">251</num>. &ldquo;The Obelisk in Cheapside, a piece of workmanship designed, and begun to be erected by the City, at the west end of Cheapside, where before the Fire of London stood the Church of St. Michael le Quern: It is to be (if finished as was intended) an Obelisk, or Aguglia, upon a pedestal, the height whereof to be <num value="160">160</num> feet, and made in imitation of those ancient ones which formerly adorned Old Rome; and in this, and the last, century, have been taken out of the old ruins, and again erected for the beautifying of New Rome.&rdquo; 
<P>This passage is wanting in the <num value="31">31st</num> edition of Chamberlayne's work, <datestruct value="1735--"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>, which points out the time when the erection of the edifice was abandoned.&mdash;A remark exactly similar to those above cited. as to the improper situation of the Monument is also to be found in a much more recent work, the <hi rend=italics>Observations of a Russian during a residence in England, &amp;c. Translated from the Original Manuscripts of Oloffe Nepea.</hi> &ldquo;A well-constructed column,&rdquo; says the author, &ldquo;which commemorates the destruction of the City an <num value="150">hundred and fifty</num> years ago, is placed in the lowest situation; visible only from the water-side, amidst the spires of surrounding churches, and totally lost in the distant view. The reason for placing the column here, is that only which ought not to have been adduced, namely, that here <hi rend=italics>began</hi> the fire; whereas sound reason would have pointed out the spot where the destructive element was conquered, where its ravages <hi rend=italics>ceased</hi>, and where the affrighted people were suffered to repose.&rdquo;</NOTE>
<pb id="p.121" n="121"> 
<P>Some very curious, though extremely infamous and ignorant notices of the Monument, are given by Edward Ward, in his <hi rend=italics>London Spy</hi>, London, <datestruct value="1709--"><year reg="1709">1709</year></datestruct>, <num value="8">8</num>vo. Part iii. pages <num value="55">55</num>-<num value="57">57</num>, which probably contain the popular estimation it was held in at the time they were written. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; says my friend, &ldquo;I'll show you a towering edifice, erected through the wisdom and honesty of the City, as a very <hi rend=italics>high</hi> memorandum of it's being laid <hi rend=italics>low</hi>, either by a judgment from heaven for the sins of the people, or by the treachery of the Papists, according to the inscription of the Monument, who, I suppose, as ignorant of the matter as myself; for that was neither built then, nor I born: So I believe we are equally as able to tell the truth of the story, as a quack astrologer is, by the assistance of the signs and planets, what was the name of Moses' great-grandfather, or how many quarts of water went to the world's drowning. You'll be mightily pleased with the loftiness of this slender column; for its very height was the <num value="1">first</num> thing that ever occasioned wry necks in England, by the people staring at the top on't. To the glory of the City, and the everlasting reputation of the projectors of this high and mighty Babel, it was more ostentiously than honestly built by the poor Orphans' money; many of them since having begged their bread, and the City have here given them a stone. Look ye, now you may see it; pray view and give me your opinion.&mdash;What, is it of no use, but only to gaze at?&mdash;Yes, yes, says my friend, Astrologers go often to the top on't, when they have a mind to play the peeper, and see Mars and Venus in conjunction; though the chief use of it is for the improvement of Vintner's boys and drawers, who come every week to exercise their supporters, and learn the Tavern-trip by running up to the Balcony and down again, which fixes them in a nimble step, and makes them rare light heeled emissaries in a month's practice. Do you observe the carving, which contains the King's and his brother's pictures. They were cut by an eminent artist, and are looked upon by a great many impartial judges to be a couple of extraordinary good figures: Pray what think you?

Though, I have heard, their chief drift in this memorable undertaking was to get estates to themselves without mistrust; that they might enjoy them without molestation.&mdash;As you say, this edifice, as well as some others, was projected as a memorandum of the Fire, or an ornament to the City; but gave those corrupted magistrates that had the power in their hands, the opportunity of putting <measure value="2000l." type=currency><num value="2000">two thousand</num> pound</measure> into their own pockets, whilst they paid <num value="1">one</num> towards the building.<NOTE N="a"><P>This passage refers to the insolvency of the City about the end of the reign of James II., towards the Freemen's Orphans under age, of whose persons and property it had long the sole legal custody, according to the ordinary feudal law of wardship.

<P>By immemorial custom a Court of Record has been, and is still, held in the City of London, for the care and government of orphans; and the Lord Mayor and Aldermen were invested with the custody and guardianship of all orphans of freemen whilst under age and unmarried, and with the management of the personal estates of deceased freemen, and in some cases of their landed estates; and with power to require the executors and administrators of freemen dying, to exhibit true inventories of their estates before them in the Court of Orphans; and to give security to the Chamberlain of London and his successors, by recognisance if the parties lived within the City, and by bond if without, for the Orphans' part; and in case of refusal to commit them to prison till they obeyed: whence it appears that the investing of the property of Orphans in the Chamber of London was, until the Act of <num value="11">11th</num> George III. chap. <num value="18">18</num>, which released the Citizens of London from this liability,&mdash;a matter of obligation, not choice. It appears that the freemen of the City have also the privilege of investing their property at interest in the Chamber of London; and have usually availed themselves of it when the interest to be obtained from investments or other securities was less than <num value="4">4</num> per cent, the rate allowed by the said Chamber. From these sources very large sums had accumulated in the reigns of James I. and Charles I.; which, in the eventful periods of public calamity that followed, were so entirely lost to the Corporation and their creditors, that they were obliged to declare themselves entirely unable to discharge either interest or principal of their debts, to the Orphans and others, out of the surpluses of their rents, after defraying the expense of the government of the City. Under these circumstances, in the year <datestruct value="1689"><year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct>, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Commonalty, presented a petition to Parliament in which they set forth that by general and national troubles after the reign of Charles I.; by their former payment of large sums to the Orphans; by the great Fire of London; by reason of the late illegal Quo Warrantos brought against them; and by other losses;&mdash;their debts to the Orphans amounted to a sum vastly greater than they were able to pay, and they prayed the House to assist them by making provision for the discharge of these, and the claims of other creditors. After several unsuccessful applications to Parliament, an Act was obtained for that purpose in the year <datestruct value="1694"><year reg="1694">1694</year></datestruct>,&mdash;<num value="5">5th</num> and <num value="6">6th</num> of William and Mary&mdash;intituled an Act for the Relief of the Orphans and other Creditors of the City of London. The whole debt at this time amounted to <measure value="747472l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="747472">747,472</num></measure>. <num value="18">18</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="4.50">4 1/2</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>, for the defraying of which the Act charged the estates and revenues of the Corporation with the annual payment of <measure value="8000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="8000">8000</num></measure>, for ever: and assigned to the Orphans' Fund certain rents and duties to be levied in the City until the year <datestruct value="1750"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>. These grants, however, for many years proved insufficient in their produce for payment of the interest of the debt at <num value="4">4</num> per cent, the rate directed by the Act; which deficiency had, between the years <datestruct value="1694--"><year reg=1694>1694</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1713--"><year reg=1713>1713</year></datestruct> occasioned an arrear of interest, or increase of the capital debt, of <measure value="90631l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="90631">90,631</num></measure>. <num value="1">1</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="9.75">9 3/4</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>: but from the year <datestruct value="1714"><year reg="1714">1714</year></datestruct> the fund became equal to the charges upon it for interest, and even produced surpluses, which by <datestruct value="1737--"><year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct>, discharged those arrears. In the <num value="21">21st</num> year of George II. <datestruct value="1747--"><year reg="1747">1747</year></datestruct>-<num value="48">48</num>, another Act was passed for farther relief of the Orphans, &amp;c. providing for the continuance of the said duties, &amp;c. till the year <datestruct value="1785"><year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct>; by which Act also, all the surpluses which had accrued since <datestruct value="1737--"><year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct>, with all future surpluses, after discharging the interest and expenses, were to be applied towards reducing the principal debt. The original Orphans debt became extinct <datestruct VALUE="1820-04-12"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=12>12th</day>, <year reg=1820>1820</year></datestruct>; but the authority of Parliament has been at various times obtained for charging upon this fund sums of money for effecting different improvements, in consequence of which it has altogether amounted to as much as <measure value="1731472l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1731472">1,731,472</num></measure>. <num value="18">18</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="4.50">4 1/2</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> Up to <datestruct VALUE="1822-01-5"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=5>5th</day>, <year reg=1822>1822</year></datestruct>, the sums which had been paid in reduction of the original debt and sums subsequently charged upon it, chargeable upon the Orphans' Fund, amounted to <measure value="623000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="623000">623,000</num></measure>; and the whole amount of the debt and additions after the passing of the Act of the <num value="53">53rd</num> of George III. for improving the West end of Cheapside and St. Martin's le Grand, and for providing a site for a New Post Office, for which the Corporation was empowered to raise money and to charge it upon this fund, was <measure value="984000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="984000">984,000</num></measure>.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Reports from Committees.</hi> Vol. iv. fol.

<P>Mr. Thornhill considered it might be safely affirmed that it was not until <datestruct value="1678--"><year reg="1678">1678</year></datestruct> that the charge against the Roman Catholics of having fired the City, began to obtain anything like general credence; when the notorious Titus Oates made his discovery of the Popish Plot, and stated some particulars concerning the Fire in the <num value="34">34th</num> Article of his <hi rend=italics>True Narrative of the Horrid Plot and Conspiracy of the Popish Party against the Life of his Sacred Majesty, the Government, and the Protestant Religion.</hi> London, <datestruct value="1679--"><year reg="1679">1679</year></datestruct>. folio, pages <num value="22">22</num>, <num value="23">23</num>.<NOTE N="d"><P><hi rend=italics>Ibid.</hi>
pp. <num value="312">312</num>, <num value="313">313</num>.&mdash;The following is a summary of Mr. Thornhill's proofs that the Fire of London was not attributed to the Papists until <datestruct value="1678--"><year reg="1678">1678</year></datestruct>.&mdash;In the speech of Sir Thomas Player, Chamberlain of the Corporation, made on <datestruct VALUE="1679-09-12"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=12>12th</day>, <year reg=1679>1679</year></datestruct>, is this passage: &ldquo;It cannot be forgotten that <num value="13">thirteen</num> years ago this City was a sad monument of the Papists' cruelty; it being <hi rend=italics>now</hi> out of all doubt that it was they who burned the City.&rdquo; In the Votes of the House of Commons, <datestruct VALUE="1680-01-10"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=10>10th</day>, <year reg=1680>1680</year></datestruct>, is a resolution &ldquo;that it is the opinion of this House that the City of London was burned in the year <datestruct value="1666"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct> by the Papists; designing thereby to introduce arbitrary power and Popery into this kingdom.&rdquo; Mr. Thornhill adds that this vote is the more remarkable, because it was the <num value="1">first</num> conclusion which the House had come to upon the subject: since the Committee appointed on <datestruct VALUE="1666-09-25"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=25>25th</day>, <year reg=1666>1666</year></datestruct>, to enquire into the causes of the Fire, made a report dated <datestruct VALUE="1667-01-22"><day reg="22">22nd</day> <month reg="01">Jan.</month> <year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>, and upon <datestruct VALUE="-02-8"><month reg="02">Febr.</month> <day reg=8>8th</day></datestruct> following the Parliament was prorogued before it had declared any judgment upon the subject. To these evidences are to be added the exhibitions in the Pageant of Sir Patience Ward, Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>-<num value="81">81</num>, of the Protestant's Exhortation and Plotting Papist's Litany; and the zealous revival of the solemnity of Burning the Pope on <datestruct VALUE="1679-11-17"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=17>17th</day>, <year reg=1679>1679</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>, the anniversary of the accession of Queen Elizabeth, in the processions called London's Defiance to Rome, and the Solemn Mock Procession, or the Tryal and Execution of the Pope and his Ministers.&mdash;None of these proofs, however, can be considered as conclusive of anything farther than that the detection of the immature plot of <datestruct value="1678--"><year reg="1678">1678</year></datestruct> had revived that suspicion and indignation of the country against the Papists, which had been partly suppressed at the time of the Fire of London, and partly diverted in the repairing of private losses, and the rebuilding of the City. Lord Clarendon, whilst he maintains that &ldquo;no combination, not very discernible and discovered, could have effected that mischief in which the immediate hand of God was so visible,&rdquo;&mdash;admits it to have been a very general and real belief that the conflagration had arisen &ldquo;by a real and formed conspiracy;&rdquo; and his own narrative, which will be found in the <num value="1">First</num> Volume of this Work, furnishes many arguments to the same effect. &ldquo;It could not be conceived,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>how a house that was distant a mile from any part of the fire, could suddenly be in a flame</hi>, without some particular malice; <hi rend=italics>and this case fell out every hour.</hi>&rdquo; Even the distracted conduct of the melancholy Hubert, who acknowledged himself the agent by whom the <num value="1">first</num> house was fired, was not without a very remarkable consistency; since he was able to distinguish, though led blind-fold to several parts of the City, the particular site of the building: though, adds Lord Clarendon, &ldquo;the house and all which were near it were so covered and buried in ruins, that the owners themselves, without same infallible mark, could very hardly have said where their own houses had stood; but this man led them directly to the place, described how it stood, the shape of the little yard, the fashion of the door and windows, and where he <num value="1">first</num> put the fire; and all this with such exactness, that they who had dwelt long near it could not so perfectly have described all particulars.&rdquo; Upon this confession Hubert was tried, condemned, and executed; yet Lord Clarendon strangely observes, that &ldquo;neither the judges nor any present at the trial did believe him guilty, but that he was a poor distracted wretch, weary of his life, and chose to part with it in this way. Certain it is, that upon the strictest examination that could afterwards be made by the King's command, and then by the diligence of the House, that upon the jealousy and rumour made a Committee that was very diligent and solicitous to make that discovery, there never was any probable evidence, that poor creature's only excepted, that there was any other cause of that woful fire than the displeasure of God Almighty.&rdquo; In the Report of that Committee, which has been already referred to, many circumstances are stated which strongly support the belief that the fire was caused by incendiaries. Several persons gave evidence of different conversations with, and communications from, Papists, in which the destruction of London by Fire was distinctly alluded to <hi rend=italics>before</hi> the conflagration: and others testified that fire-balls and combustibles were found on different foreigners, who were apprehended under very suspicious circumstances, whilst the flames were raging. The Chairman of the Committee concludes the Report, however, by stating that several such persons were traced to the Guards, but that no farther discovery could be made of them.</NOTE> When this belief was established, it was determined to record the same upon the Monument; and the following were the proceedings of the Corporation on the subject.

<P>The whole of the alteration which took place in consequence of this Order, appears to have been the erasure of the last word of the original inscription on the north side, &ldquo;Elanguit,&rdquo; which was recut in the same situation, something more than an inch higher up; the <num value="1">first</num> cutting of the letters, however, remaining still very visible.<NOTE N="b"><P>Another erasure in this part of the Inscription is visible in the <num value="5">fifth</num> line from the present termination, in the word &ldquo;Florentissimam,&rdquo; the last <num value="3">three</num> letters of which appear to have been executed by the stone-cutter twice over, and then partially obliterated.</NOTE>
The addition was then made, as represented in the annexed Engraving, the beginning word of it being placed at the extremity of the former concluding line, and the remainder forming a full line below, at the very bottom of the panel. The English Inscription was added on the upper edge of the lowest member of the plinth, in <num value="1">one</num> continuous line, commencing on the western side of the north-west corner. Throughout the whole of the reign of Charles II. this record was continued unaltered; but only a very few months after his death on <datestruct VALUE="1685-02-6"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=6>6th</day>, <year reg=1685>1685</year></datestruct>, the above additions were obliterated, the particular time being thus fixed by Evelyn in his <hi rend=italics>Diary:</hi> &ldquo;<datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>, <datestruct VALUE="-06-17"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=17>17th</day></datestruct>. At this time the words engraven on the Monument, intimating that the Papists fired the City, were erased and cut out.&rdquo; The erasure was effected by cutting a long and shallow curved channel, or flute, to the depth of the letters. The stone in Pudding Lane, containing the like accusation, appears to have been also removed at the same time; but upon the re-establishment of Protestantism the following direction was issued for the restoration of both.

<P>Mr. Thornhill states that this resolution of the Common-Council was begun to be carried into effect on the morning of Wednesday, <datestruct VALUE="1831-01-26"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=26>26th</day> <year reg=1831>1831</year></datestruct>; when Mr. Charles Pearson, Mr. Richard Taylor, and himself, attended with the workmen, and were the <num value="1">first</num> to commence the erasure of those Inscriptions.<NOTE N="b"><P><hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi>, Vol. ci. part <num value="1">1</num>. p. <num value="315">315</num>. note.&mdash;An account of the debate in the Common Council on this subject may be seen in the <hi rend=italics>Times</hi> of Tuesday, <datestruct VALUE="1830-12-7"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=7>7th</day>, <year reg=1830>1830</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> Those parts of the stone from which they were obliterated were then cut down into the present deep square channels, about <num value="3">three</num> inches below the original surface. 
<P>In the peculiar construction of this noble Column, however, the Architect had another design beside that of preserving the memory of the Great Fire; since it is stated that he built it hollow, that it might be used as an astronomical tube for discovering the parallax of the earth, by observing the different distances of the stars in the Dragon's Head from the zenith, at various seasons of the year: but as he found the oscillation of the pillar very considerable from it being shaken by the motion of the carriages which were continually passing, the intention of thus using it was abandoned.<NOTE N="c"><P><hi rend=italics>Lives of the Professors of Gresham College</hi>, by Jno. Ward, LL.D. Lond. <datestruct value="1740--"><year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct>. fol. p. <num value="104">104</num>. It is farther stated by the same authority that Sir Christopher Wren also designed to make use of the hollow in the centre of the staircase on the south side of St. Paul's Cathedral, <num value="96">96</num> feet <num value="10">10</num> inches in height, for the same astronomical purpose; assisted by the great telescope presented to the Royal Society by Constantine Huygens, but that instrument, being <num value="123">123</num> feet in length, proved too large for his purpose. The observations were to have been made by Sir Christopher's kinsman, James Hodgson, afterwards Mathematical Master at Christ's Hospital, who appears to have given Ward the whole of the above information. The thought of making such a scientific use of buildings was perhaps suggested by Dr. Hooke, <datestruct VALUE="1669-10-28"><month reg="10">Oct.</month> <day reg=28>28th</day>, <year reg=1669>1669</year></datestruct>, when he stated to the Royal Society that he considered &ldquo;<num value="1">one</num> of the exactest ways of measuring a degree of the earth was by making accurate observations of the heavens to a <num value="2">second</num> by a perpendicular tube, and then taking exact distances to a <num value="2">second</num> also.&rdquo; <hi rend=italics>Life of Dr. Robert Hooke</hi> prefixed to his <hi rend=italics>Posthumous Works</hi> by Richard Walker, Lond. <datestruct value="1705--"><year reg="1705">1705</year></datestruct>, fol. p. xiv.&mdash;Dr. Hooke also entertained the thought of fixing a large telescope against a high edifice, since in his <hi rend=italics>Discourse of Earthquakes</hi>, read before the Royal Society, <datestruct VALUE="1686-02-9"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=9>9th</day>, <year reg=1686>1686</year></datestruct>-<num value="87">87</num>, in mentioning telescopes of <num value="60">60</num>, <num value="80">80</num>, or <num value="100">100</num>, feet in length, he says, &ldquo;nor will it be very difficult to find in this city a convenient building or tower for resting the end of a telescope of <num value="100">100</num> feet: there are houses enough to be found of sufficient height, if a <num value="50">50</num> or <num value="60">60</num> feet telescope be made use of.&rdquo; <hi rend=italics>Posthumous Works</hi>, p. <num value="359">359</num>. An astronomical contrivance similar in its intended use to the tube of the Monument, was also about the time of its erection introduced by Dr. Flamsteed into the Royal Observatory at Greenwich; namely, a well sunk in the southeast corner of that which is now the garden behind the Observatory, for the purpose of seeing stars in the day-time, and of observing the earth's parallax. It was <num value="100">100</num> feet deep, with stone stairs to the bottom; but has long being arched over, as the improvements in the telescope have superseded it for astronomical uses. In the Paris Observatory was a cave or cellar of <num value="170">170</num> feet descent; but the most extraordinary structure of this nature is that mentioned in Dr. Gruithuisen's account of a zenith-telescope for the use of a Katachthonian Observatory to be built <num value="16">16</num> German, or <num value="74">74</num> English, miles below the surface of the earth.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Philosophical Magazine</hi>, <datestruct VALUE="1828-08--"><month reg="08">Aug.</month> <year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>, vol. iv. New Series, art. xxiv. p. <num value="135">135</num>.</NOTE> Another scientific purpose to which the Monument was applied, was that of employing it for ascertaining the pressure of the atmosphere at different heights; some experiments concerning which were made by Dr. Robert Hooke, and Messrs. Hunt and Crawly, and reported to the Royal Society, <datestruct VALUE="1678-05-30"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=30>30th</day>, <year reg=1678>1678</year></datestruct>. In these experiments Dr. Hooke stated that he found the quicksilver in the tube to stand higher at the bottom than at the top of the Column, by almost <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3">third</num> of an inch; and also that he observed the same to ascend by degrees, as nearly as he could perceive proportionally to the space descended in going down the Pillar from the top to the bottom.<NOTE N="d"><P><hi rend=italics>History of the Royal Society</hi>, by Dr. Thomas Birch, Vol. iii. Lond. <datestruct value="1757--"><year reg="1757">1757</year></datestruct>. <num value="4">4</num>to. p. <num value="409">409</num>. Dr. Hooke added, that as the stations of the mercury differed so little, it was not easy to determine their certain proportions to the height of the Column; and he therefore proposed against the next meeting of the Society to repeat the experiment with an instrument capable of measuring the same an <num value="100">hundred</num> times more exactly. The instrument referred to was then produced, and is stated to have been upon the same principle as the Wheel-barometer, but more curiously wrought; and the proposed trial was ordered to take place at the Column on the Thursday morning following at <num value="11">11</num> o'clock: there do not appear, however, to have been any farther proceedings concerning it entered upon the Council-books of the Society.</NOTE> Some similar results were likewise reported to the Society by the Rev. William Derham, made in <datestruct VALUE="1698-09--"><month reg="09">September</month> <year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>.<NOTE N="e"><P><hi rend=italics>Philosophical Transactions</hi>, Vol. xx. Lond. <datestruct value="1698--"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>, <num value="4">4</num>to. No. <num value="236">236</num>. Art. <num value="1">1</num>. p. <num value="2">2</num>. In this latter experiment the mercury was found to descend <num value="1">1</num>-<num value="10">10th</num> of an inch at the height of <num value="80">80</num> feet, and <num value="2">2</num>-<num value="10">10</num>ths at the elevation of <num value="160">160</num> feet.</NOTE>

<P>It is probable that from the time of its completion the height of the Monument rendered it an object of exhibition; and it is evident from the preceding notice of it by Ward, that it was not only such in <datestruct value="1709--"><year reg="1709">1709</year></datestruct>, but that the keeping of it was then conferred upon a decayed citizen, which has probably also been the case ever since its erection.<NOTE N="f"><P>The annual sum paid by the Corporation of London to the Keeper of the Monument is about <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure>, which is supposed to be made <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure> by the admission-money taken of visitors; though this is probably more than the appointment is worth. At this rate there would be <num value="7200">7200</num> persons visit the gallery of the Column every year; but the number must be of course fluctuating. In the small descriptive pamphlets sold by the Keepers of the Monument there is an acknowledgment to the Corporation for the gift of the appointment. In that printed for Samuel Arnott, on the reverse of the title is a dedication to the Lord Mayor, &amp;c. &ldquo;My Lord and Gentlemen. Permit me to add a few lines, with the account of the Monument, to you; under whose favour and protection I remain with all due respect and gratitude your devoted servant Samuel Arnott.

<P>The base of this Column is surrounded by an area and iron railing on the north, east, and south, sides, in which are set tubs with plants and flowering-shrubs; the front is even with the street. In all the older views of this edifice, the yard around it is represented as considerably higher than the part on which it is built, and the street in front; the above <num value="3">three</num> sides having a descent of several steps. At the present time, however, there are steps on a small part of the south side of Monument Yard only, the street and the base of the pillar having been made level with the highest part of the square.<NOTE N="a"><P>This improvement probably took place at either the amendment of the pavement of London by Act of Parliament passed in the <num value="12">12th</num> year of George III., <datestruct value="1771--"><year reg="1771">1771</year></datestruct>; or at the great repair of the Monument in <datestruct value="1786--"><year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct>.

In concluding these historical and descriptive particulars of this celebrated Column, it remains only to mention a few remarkable circumstances which have taken place at it. 
<P><num value="1">One</num> of the most curious feats of agility exhibited in the last century was that called Steeple-flying, in which the performer glided down a rope stretched tightly from the tower or spire of a church, to some distance below;<NOTE N="c"><P>The manner of performing this feat is particularly described by Strutt, in his <hi rend=italics>Sports and Passtimes of the People of England</hi>, Lond. <datestruct value="1801--"><year reg="1801">1801</year></datestruct>, <num value="4">4</num>to. Book iii. Chap. v. Sect. xii. p. <num value="168">168</num>, as practised about the year <datestruct value="1750"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>, at Hertford, from the tower of All Saints' Church. The end of the rope was drawn tightly over <num value="2">two</num> strong pieces of wood nailed across each other, about <num value="80">eighty</num> yards from the base of the building, and then made fast to a stake driven into the ground. Some feather-beds were placed upon the cross-timbers, to break the fall of the performer; who was also provided with a flat board, having a groove in the midst of it, fastened to his breast. When he was ready to descend, he laid himself on the top of the rope with his head downwards, his legs being held by a person behind, until he had properly balanced himself and fixed the groove: he was then liberated, and descended with incredible swiftness upon the feather-beds. The person referred to by Strutt had lost <num value="1">one</num> of his legs, and the substitute worn by him was at this time counterpoised by a quantity of lead. He performed thrice in the same day, once blowing a trumpet, and once firing a pistol in the descent.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>The Daily Journal</hi> of Friday, <datestruct VALUE="1732-09-22"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=22>22nd</day>, <year reg=1732>1732</year></datestruct>, states, that on &ldquo;the <num value="9">9th</num> instant a man flew from St. Mary's Steeple, Cambridge, upon the shambles, and <hi rend=italics>up again</hi> with great dexterity: firing <num value="2">two</num> pistols and tossing his flags when he was midway, and hung by his feet, and acted the tailor and shoemaker to the great admiration of the spectators.&rdquo; This kind of exhibition appears to have been of considerable antiquity, since Froissart states that on Sunday, <datestruct VALUE="1399-06-26"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=26>26th</day>, <year reg=1399>1399</year></datestruct>, when Isabel of Bavaria, Queen of Charles VI., made her public entry into Paris, a master-engineer from Geneva had a full month before fastened a cord to the highest tower of N&ocirc;tre Dame, which passed high above the streets, and was fixed to the loftiest house on the bridge of St. Michael. As the Queen was passing the street of N&ocirc;tre Dame, he left the tower, and seating himself on the cord descended singing, with <num value="2">two</num> lighted torches in his hands, for it was then dark, to the great astonishment of all. He kept the lighted torches in his hands that he might be seen by all Paris, and even <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> leagues off. He played many tricks on the rope, and his agility was highly praised. <hi rend=italics>Chronicles</hi>, Vol. iv. Chap. xxii. p. <num value="78">78</num>, Translation by Col.

His remains were taken to St. Magnus' Church to be owned, when it was discovered that the unfortunate person was a weaver, named William Green, dwelling near Cox's Square, Spitalfields; and that the cause of the accident was as follows: &ldquo;In the iron gallery of the Column there is a live eagle to be seen, for which it is customary to pay a penny; but the person not being there to show it, it being enclosed in a wooden cage, he in projecting his body too far over the rails to look in at the back of the box, which is open to the iron-work, losing his hold, fell against the top of the pedestal, and from thence against <num value="1">one</num> of the posts in the street; whereby the top of his skull was laid quite open, and the other parts of his body terribly shivered.&rdquo;<NOTE N="a"><P><hi rend=italics>General Advertiser</hi>, Tuesday, <datestruct VALUE="1750-06-26"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=26>26th</day>, <year reg=1750>1750</year></datestruct>.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Penny London Post</hi>, <datestruct VALUE="-06-25"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=25>25th</day></datestruct> to <num value="27">27th</num>.</NOTE> There were found in the pocket of this person eighteen guineas, but if his fall were really accidental, it is remarkable that he left his watch in the care of the Keeper of the Monument.<NOTE N="b"><P><hi rend=italics>Penny London Post</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>Morning Advertiser</hi>, Wednesday, <datestruct VALUE="-06-27"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=27>27th</day></datestruct> to <num value="29">29th</num>, <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>.</NOTE>&mdash;On Monday, <datestruct VALUE="1788-07-7"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=7>7th</day>, <year reg=1788>1788</year></datestruct>, about <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock, <num value="4">four</num> persons went to the top of this pillar, at which place <num value="1">one</num> of them got over the iron rail on the north side, threw himself down, and was dashed to pieces upon a pile of hard mortar in the yard beneath.

The whole passage is as follows:

<P>Levy.&mdash;An insolvent Israelite, who threw himself from the top of the Monument <hi rend=italics>a short time before.</hi>&rdquo;&mdash;The suicide took place in <datestruct VALUE="1810-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, and the Rejected Addresses were published in <datestruct VALUE="1812-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>.&mdash;&ldquo;An inhabitant of Monument Yard informed the writer that he happened to be standing at his door, talking to a neighbour; and looking up at the top of the pillar, he exclaimed, &lsquo;Why the flag's coming down!&rsquo; &lsquo;Flag!&rsquo; exclaimed the other, &lsquo;&lsquo;tis a man!&rsquo; The words were hardly uttered when the suicide fell within <num value="10">ten</num> feet of the speakers.&rdquo;</NOTE> Its fall was broken by its striking against <num value="1">one</num> of the dragons at the corner of the base of the pillar, but the unfortunate person at length fell upon his head in Monument Yard, and expired without a groan; a convulsive motion of the shoulders being the only sign of life exhibited by him when he fell. His head was terribly shattered, and the brain protruded from it in several places; whilst the face was so greatly disfigured as to be with difficulty recognised. It was reported that Mr. Levy was subject to hereditary insanity, his mother having been for many years confined in a private, madhouse, and the Coroner's Inquest returned a corresponding verdict; but the immediate cause of his suicide was attributed to the failure of a commercial speculation. He had been at the Bank-Coffee House in the morning before he went to the Monument, and when he ascended he evinced no uncommon emotion, but appeared to the Keeper to be perfectly easy and collected in his mind. He left a widow and <num value="8">eight</num> children.<NOTE N="g"><P><hi rend=italics>Morning Herald</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Times</hi>, Friday, <datestruct VALUE="1810-01-19"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=19>19th</day>, <year reg=1810>1810</year></datestruct>.</NOTE>

<P>The last circumstance worth notice connected with this building is, that on Wednesday, <datestruct VALUE="1825-06-15"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=15>15th</day>, <year reg=1825>1825</year></datestruct>, a printed bill was issued stating that &ldquo;This Evening the Monument will be superbly Illuminated with Portable Gas, in Commemoration of Laying the <num value="1">First</num> Stone of the New London Bridge by the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor.<NOTE N="h"><P>The Right Hon.

<P>After having stood for upwards of a century and a half in a situation by far too narrow to allow of any front view of this magnificent Column, a very fine prospect of it was opened about <datestruct VALUE="1833-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, by the removal of the opposite lines of houses in forming Arthur Street, leading across from Fish Street Hill to the northern entrance of the New London Bridge. From the western end of this street, the beauty and grandeur of the Monument may be most happily contemplated; and the beholder cannot fail to observe that so exquisite and accurate are its <pb id="p.127" n="127"> symmetry and proportions, that the view includes the whole of it with ease and satisfaction, notwithstanding the vast dimensions of its height and capacity.

<P>It teaches the Present and Future Age should any like destruction assail them to propitiate the Divinity by prayer: and it also gratefully records the benefits of the King and rulers of the nation, by whose bounty the City has acquired greater security as well as ornament.

<P>To the Friendly Reader. Forasmuch as by an ordinance of Parliament it was enacted that a Column should be erected in memory of the Conflagration of London, I also, with others, of whom I speak without envy,&mdash;put together my Inscription for the same: partly Mistorical, or Narrative; and partly Poetical, that is to say such as is proper to monuments; by which may be testified the affection of my mind for this renowned City: which is here set forth to view, that the remainder of this small leaf may not be left altogether empty. The noble and ingenious Citizens may hold me excused in that I have placed this Inscription such as it is in the end of my labours, by remembering the common saying, <hi rend=italics>The End Crowns the Work:</hi>

<emph>MAY THE CITY OF LONDON BE HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS.</emph>

<P>In the Year of Human Salvation, <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, the <num value="6">Sixth</num> of the Restoration of KING CHARLES, and in the Eighteenth of his Reign, on the <num value="4">Fourth</num> Day of the Nones of September, a fatal and irresistible Fire began in a bakehouse at this place, in a long and narrow lane; and was spread around by a wind which blew it both forwards and backwards. It continued for <num value="3">three</num> days, in which Houses, Churches, Palaces, and other edifices, as well private as public,&mdash;which now by the goodness of God we see renovated, and therefore it is to meet to worship the same, since to no nation hath it appeared more surely,&mdash;were enwrapt in a flood of fearful flames, and this most noble City was for the greatest part reduced to ashes: until at length it seemed that nothing less than a miracle could abate the fury of that overthrow, the commencement of which was so violent, the continuance destruction without the power of resisting ruin, and the end complete conflagration. Forasmuch as this took place, it pleased the Senate in Council, in perpetual memory of the event, to appoint This Obelisk, or Prospect Tower, from which the view of all belonging to that City lies spread open on every side, that posterity may know the Divine Wrath as well as Mercy; of both of which here is given a testimony, in the extreme raging of the Fire, and in the present renown and beauty.&mdash;May this devoted Column emulate those of Seth,<NOTE N="REPEAT"></NOTE>
and endure to the Last Day when the Universe shall be consumed, equally adorned by and adorning this place and the dwellings which lie beneath it on every side, long seeing and long to be seen, the Monument of the extinction and the beautified resurrection of the same City. <pb id="p.128" n="128">

<P>It is, or rather, until the subject was more accurately invested, it was, the general opinion, that the <hi rend=italics>English Stage</hi> rose later, and made slower advances towards <hi rend=italics>mature refinement</hi> and <hi rend=italics>classic elegance</hi>, than that of any other nation. With respect to the Theatres of <hi rend=italics>Greece</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Rome</hi>, we must, in contravention of this proposition, state, that the origin of these was unquestionably as humble, and their progress to perfection as slow, as that of the English Stage; nor do we think, in times comparatively modern, that either <hi rend=italics>France</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Germany</hi> have any reason to assume much pride in the superiority of their early Dramas: the <hi rend=italics>histrionic rites</hi> of the <hi rend=italics>Druids</hi> were common to the <num value="3">three</num> countries; and certainly, in their <hi rend=italics>ecstatic effusions</hi>, they came very near to the sublimity of <hi rend=italics>tragedy.</hi> Their umbrageous groves, their natural scenery, solemn incantations, and all the dramatic machinery of their invocations, were transmitted to the <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> and 
<hi rend=italics>Saxon</hi> historians; and, with many of their <hi rend=italics>rites</hi> and <hi rend=italics>customs</hi>, especially those whose impressions were <hi rend=italics>tragic</hi>, adapted, and in some instances <hi rend=italics>burlesqued</hi>, by the latter. That the profession of <hi rend=italics>Actors</hi>, under the general appellation of <hi rend=italics>Minstrels</hi>, flourished in very early times in <hi rend=italics>England</hi>, we have every reason to believe: <hi rend=italics>John</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Salisbury</hi>, a monk of <hi rend=italics>Canterbury</hi>, who wrote in the <num value="12">12th</num> <hi rend=italics>century</hi>, in the <num value="1">1st</num> book of his treatise, entitled, <hi rend=italics>Policraticus, de Nugis Curialium</hi>, chapters <num value="6">6th</num>, <num value="7">7th</num>, and <num value="8">8th</num>, particularly the latter, speaks <hi rend=italics>De histrionibus et mimis, et pr&aelig;stigiatoribus</hi> (of <hi rend=italics>Actors, Stagebuffoons</hi>, and <hi rend=italics>Jugglers</hi>), which were unquestionably the players of <hi rend=italics>common interludes</hi>, introduced by the <hi rend=italics>Romans</hi>, in their <hi rend=italics>Histriones</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Mimi</hi>, continued by the <hi rend=italics>Saxons</hi> in their <hi rend=italics>Gleemen</hi>, and adopted by the <hi rend=italics>Normans</hi> in their <hi rend=italics>Iniquity;</hi>
from whom lineally descended the <hi rend=italics>Vice</hi> of the middle ages, whose <num value="1">first</num> business it was to <hi rend=italics>teize the devil;</hi> and the <hi rend=italics>Punch</hi>
of modern times, who, under the direction of <hi rend=italics>Pod</hi><NOTE N="*"><P>POD, a famous <hi rend=italics>master</hi> of the <hi rend=italics>motions</hi>, or player of <hi rend=italics>common interludes</hi>, celebrated by <hi rend=italics>Ben Jonson</hi>, in &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Bartholomew Fair.</hi>&rdquo;</NOTE> and his descendants, had nearly the same occupation. But to return to our early Drama: <hi rend=italics>William Stephanides</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>Fitzstephen</hi>, who was also a monk of <hi rend=italics>Canterbury</hi>, that wrote in the reign of HENRY II., and died in that of RICHARD I., <datestruct value="1191--"><year reg="1191">1191</year></datestruct>, in his <hi rend=italics>Descriptio Nobilissim&aelig; Civitatis Londin&aelig;</hi>, thus characterized those scenes which, performed by <hi rend=italics>Minstrels</hi>,<NOTE N="*"><P><hi rend=italics>Dugdale</hi>
apud <hi rend=italics>Percy</hi>, Sect. <num value="4">4</num>.</NOTE> used to exhilarate the spirits of our remote ancestors: &ldquo;LONDON, instead of the <hi rend=italics>common interludes</hi> belonging to the <hi rend=italics>Theatres</hi>,<NOTE N="*"><P>By this passage we also learn that <hi rend=italics>interludes</hi> were <hi rend=italics>common</hi> in London in the <num value="12">12</num><hi rend=italics>th century</hi>, that <hi rend=italics>Theatres</hi> were established, and <hi rend=italics>Minstrels</hi> well known.</NOTE> has plays of a more holy subject; representations of those miracles which the holy confessors wrought, or of the sufferings, wherein the glorious constancy of the martyrs did appear.&rdquo; Still, however, we find that the efforts of the <hi rend=italics>secular</hi> at least kept pace with those of the <hi rend=italics>ecclesiastical actors;</hi> nay, it appears, from <hi rend=italics>Stat.</hi> <num value="4">4</num>, of HENRY IV., that the opposition of professional performers was (in some places) considered of such <hi rend=italics>importance</hi>, that it was necessary to arm the <hi rend=italics>clergy</hi> with the strongest powers for its repression. Accordingly their performances were interdicted, their persons proscribed, their morals condemned, and their manners anathematized: yet, notwithstanding these <hi rend=italics>strong measures</hi>, they still found such encouragement from the people, that, in spite of the censures and fulminations of the <hi rend=italics>clergy</hi>, they continued their exhibitions; which, during the triumphant reign of HENRY V. flourished so much, that the <hi rend=italics>Monastic Companies</hi>, as they may be entitled, found, that, instead of launching execrations which were laughed at, it would be rather to their interest to imitate those that they had so severely reprobated, and by the introduction of <hi rend=italics>common interludes</hi>, founded upon the <hi rend=italics>Mimes</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Atellan&aelig;</hi> of the <hi rend=italics>Romans</hi>, to relieve the gravity of their <hi rend=italics>miracle plays.</hi> From this happy combination, which by <hi rend=italics>profane dramatists</hi> had been termed 
<hi rend=italics>Mysteries</hi>, arose a species of <hi rend=italics>church</hi> exhibition, commonly, but most improperly, called MORALITIES. 
<P>The long wars of <hi rend=italics>York</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Lancaster</hi> entirely banished domestic hilarity, and repressed, in a great degree, religious festivity; the plays usually performed in churches, or displayed with long trains of processional pomp and show, virgins and youths, saints, monarchs and popes, angels and devils, on stages erected upon wheels, whence their appellation <hi rend=italics>Pageants</hi>, were, from about the middle of the <num value="15">15</num><hi rend=italics>th century</hi>, in some degree suspended, and were not generally revived until during the reign of EDWARD IV., who, to please the citizens of <hi rend=italics>London</hi>, &amp;c., favoured their reappearance. The stern system of RICHARD III. affrighted dramatic genius, if that species of spectacle to which we have alluded, may be so termed, once more from the land; but the peaceable time of HENRY VII., the settlement of the <hi rend=italics>government</hi>, the revival of <hi rend=italics>learning</hi>, and the expansion of the <hi rend=italics>human mind</hi>, conduced to its <hi rend=italics>nurture</hi>, and <hi rend=italics>ultimately</hi> to its <hi rend=italics>perfection.</hi>

<P>But although the DRAMATIC GENIUS of our <hi rend=italics>isle</hi> made some advances, yet still it appears to have struggled hard with <hi rend=italics>monastic absurdities</hi> and <hi rend=italics>vulgar ribaldry. Motions</hi><NOTE N="*"><P>Puppet-shows.</NOTE> and <hi rend=italics>Miracle plays</hi>, in both of which, events recorded in <pb id="p.130" n="130"> the <hi rend=italics>Holy Scriptures</hi><NOTE N="*"><P><hi rend=italics>The Deluge, Joseph and his Brethren, Jephtha's rash Vow, Nineve</hi>, which is recorded as a famous <hi rend=italics>getpenny, Solomon</hi>, &amp;c.</NOTE> were <hi rend=italics>mingled</hi> with <hi rend=italics>common interludes</hi>, and <hi rend=italics>travestied</hi> with the <hi rend=italics>vilest trash</hi> and the most 
<hi rend=italics>obscene buffoonery</hi>, kept possession of <hi rend=italics>Theatres</hi>, and even, profane as it may now seem, of CHURCHES, in the early part of the reign of HENRY VIII. The <hi rend=italics>Reformation</hi> chased these scenic monsters from sacred places, and indeed formed a new era in the <hi rend=italics>morals</hi> as well as in the <hi rend=italics>religion</hi> of the country. 
<P>The <num value="1">first</num> symptom of these dramatic improvements is to be observed in the comedies of <hi rend=italics>John Heywood</hi>, of which, &ldquo;THE PLAY OF THE WEATHER,&rdquo; is dated <datestruct value="1533--"><year reg="1533">1533</year></datestruct>; &ldquo;THE <num value="4">FOUR</num> P <QUOTE>S,&rdquo; <datestruct value="1547--"><year reg="1547">1547</year></datestruct>, &amp;c. &ldquo;GAMMER GURTON</QUOTE> S NEEDLE,&rdquo;<NOTE N="*"><P>Written by JOHN STILL, M.A., afterwards Bishop of Bath and Wells.</NOTE> stated but erroneously, to be the oldest of our dramatic pieces, is dated <datestruct value="1575--"><year reg="1575">1575</year></datestruct>, and is said to have been performed soon after the <hi rend=italics>interludes</hi>, except those at the <hi rend=italics>Red Bull, St. John Street</hi>, had been consigned to their proper station, BARTHOLOMEW FAIR.

<P>We have thought it necessary, as an introduction to our few remarks upon the views of <hi rend=italics>Theatres</hi>, &amp;c., exhibited in this work, briefly, and consequently slightly, to state the progress of our Drama, from its lowest state of barbarity and rudeness, to its highest flight of elegance and sublimity; but, alas! when we contemplate the works of our immortal bard, and also those of <hi rend=italics>Jonson, Beaumont, Fletcher</hi>, and <hi rend=italics>Massinger</hi>, we must lament that their temples, the <hi rend=italics>Theatres</hi>, were by no means adequate to the powers of those divinities that were therein worshipped: to confess the truth, they were mean buildings, barns, rooms, or yards at inns; undecorated, unilluminated, ill-contrived, and totally improper for scenic representations. Such were our <hi rend=italics><num value="1">first</num> public Playhouses.</hi> The <hi rend=italics><num value="2">second</num></hi> (of which <hi rend=italics><num value="17">seventeen</num></hi> were erected in and adjacent to the <hi rend=italics>metropolis</hi>, in the course of <hi rend=italics><num value="60">sixty</num></hi> years): with respect to these, they certainly were built upon a regular plan, and were much more convenient, but they were still open at the top, of consequence exposed to the weather; and their plays, in which <hi rend=italics>Rhodes, Malta, London, Paris, Milan</hi>, &amp;c., written <hi rend=italics>upon boards</hi>, and displayed <hi rend=italics>upon blankets</hi>, served to mark the <hi rend=italics>changes of place</hi>, were exhibited by <hi rend=italics>daylight;</hi> a circumstance which, together with that last hinted, put all scenic delusion out of the question, and banished in a great degree the <hi rend=italics>witchery</hi> of the <hi rend=italics>Drama;</hi> in short, these Theatres were too much like <hi rend=italics>bear-gardens</hi> in their external appearance, while internally they were equally deficient of 
<hi rend=italics>propriety</hi> and <hi rend=italics>property</hi> of <hi rend=italics>scenery</hi> and <hi rend=italics>decoration.</hi> The inconvenience of their forms appears conspicuous in the print of <hi rend=italics>Shakespear's Theatre</hi>, the <hi rend=italics>Globe</hi>, on the <hi rend=italics>Bankside, Southwark;</hi> and the <hi rend=italics>Swan</hi>, in its vicinity. The <hi rend=italics>Hope</hi> and the 
<hi rend=italics>Rose</hi>, that were situated in the neighbourhood, were, as appears also by their prints, in the same style.<NOTE N="*"><P>Turning to the view of London, &amp;c., as they appeared in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Queen Elizabeth</hi>, it will be seen that there were <hi rend=italics><num value="4">four</num> Theatres</hi>

<P>Some of the most characteristic features of London and its suburbs in their early state, were the waters, springs, and wells, by which they were originally distinguished; and which the improvements and extension of the metropolis have gradually caused to be covered or filled up. Independently of the Thames on the south of Middlesex, the larger waters consisted of the following. The Flete, or River of Wells, flowing down from the north at the western extremity of the City; terminating in the stream afterwards called Fleet-Ditch, and running into the Thames: a smaller water, called the Wall-Brook, rising from <num value="3">three</num> heads in Moor-fields, passing through the centre of the City, and also flowing into the Thames: and <num value="2">two</num> channels still less, named the Lang-Bourne, and the Old-Bourne: the former of which issued from a spring in the eastern quarter of London, and ran parallel with the Thames into the Wall-Brook, behind the present Mansion-house; and the latter rose from <num value="2">two</num> heads about Brook-street, Holborn, and ran east into the River of Wells. 
<P>The principal Springs and Wells of ancient London, were in the northern suburbs, and they are thus noticed by Fitz- Stephen, about the year <datestruct value="1174"><year reg="1174">1174</year></datestruct>: &ldquo;Round the City again, and towards the north, arise certain excellent springs, at a small distance, whose waters are sweet, salubrious, and clear; and whose runnels murmur o&lsquo;er the shining stones. Of these, Holy-Well, Clerken-Well, and St. Clement's Well, may be esteemed the principal; as being much the best frequented, both by scholars from the schools, and the youth of the City, when they are disposed to take an airing.&rdquo;<NOTE N="*"><P><hi rend=italics>Descriptio Nobilissim&aelig; Civitatis Londoni&aelig;</hi>, Edit. by the Rev. Samuel Pegge, Lond. <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, <num value="4">4</num>to. pp. <num value="27">27</num>, <num value="61">61</num>.</NOTE> In the immediate vicinity of the Clerken-Well, however, Stow records that there were also situate various other wells; as Skinners' Well, Fag's Well, Tode Well, Loder's Well, and Rad Well: all which having the fall of their overflowing into the Flete River, much increased the stream, and gave it in that place the name of Wells.<NOTE N="*"><P>Stow's 
<hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, Edit. by the Rev. J. Strype, Lond. <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>. Fol. Vol. I. book i. chap. v. p. <num value="23">23</num>.</NOTE> The water of such springs seems to have been esteemed principally on account of its clear and sparkling appearance, occasioned by its containing considerable quantities of Carbonic-acid gas; whence, as also in those instances where the water has been found remarkably free from saline matter, such springs have been usually distinguished by the name of Holy Wells. On account of that very small quantity of saline matter, their medical properties were in general very inconsiderable; and therefore the decline of the reputation of most mineral fountains has been as rapid as its rise. 
<P>From the expressions of Fitz-Stephen it is evident that the Wells of London were places for sports and assemblies; and that the spring called CLERKEN-WELL was <num value="1">one</num> of the most eminent of them. In noticing the amusements of the City, he further observes that &ldquo;London, in lieu of the ancient shews of the scene, has exhibitions of a more devout kind; being either representations of those Miracles which were wrought by holy Confessors, or of those passions and sufferings in which the Martyrs so signally displayed their fortitude.&rdquo;<NOTE N="*"><P><hi rend=italics>Descript. Nobiliss. Civitat. Londoni&aelig;</hi>, pp. <num value="45">45</num>, <num value="73">73</num>.</NOTE> Though there be no actual statement that these sacred histories were exhibited at the Clerken-Well, it is very possible that such was the case; as it is explicitly asserted by Stow,<NOTE N="*"><P>This ancient and very curious tract of Gulielmus Stephanides, or William Fitz-Stephen, was <num value="1">first</num> printed and translated by Stow at the end of his <hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>, <num value="4">4</num>to., as being an author &ldquo;more choice than any other for the ancient estate of this City;&rdquo; and also because &ldquo;the said author being rare, I have in this place thought good by impression to impart the same to my loving friends.&rdquo;</NOTE> that the fountain derived its name from the dramatic performances of the Clerks of the Metropolis upon that spot. Further than this, it has been suggested that both the name and the practice are even still more ancient: and it is at least remarkable that the <hi rend=italics>Fons Clericorum</hi>, as the title is written by Fitz-Stephen, and the Clarks' Well, as it is rendered by Stow,&mdash;is still universally known by an English word much older than either author; being called <hi rend=italics>Clerken</hi>- Well, with the ordinary Anglo-Saxon plural termination. From these circumstances, the latter name has been entirely referred to an English origin; so that instead of deriving the term Clerk from the Norman-French <hi rend=italics>Clerc</hi>, it may as fairly be deduced from the Latin <hi rend=italics>Clericus</hi>, and the Anglo-Saxon <hi rend=italics>Clere, Cleric, Clerices</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>Cleroc</hi>, as written in the <num value="9">ninth</num> and <num value="10">tenth</num> centuries:<NOTE N="*"><P><hi rend=italics>Dictionarium Saxonico et Gothico-Latinum</hi>, by Edw.

<P>The few positive particulars collected by Stow concerning the Dramatic performances of this place, evidently relate to a very remote period, mentioned in contradistinction to the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century. &ldquo;Clarkes-Well, or Clarkenwell,&rdquo; he observes, &ldquo;is curbed about square, with hard stone; not far from the west end of Clarken-Well Church, without the wall that encloseth the Church. The said Church took the name of the Well, and <hi rend=italics>the Well took the name of the Parish- Clerks of London, who, of old time, were accustomed there yearly to assemble, and to play some large history of Holy Scripture.</hi> For example, <hi rend=italics>of latter time</hi>, to wit in the year <datestruct value="1390"><year reg="1390">1390</year></datestruct>, the <num value="14">14th</num> of Richard II., I read that the Parish-Clerks of London, on the <datestruct VALUE="-07-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, played Interludes at Skinners' Well, near unto Clarks' Well; which Play continued <num value="3">three</num> days together, the King, Queen, and Nobles being present. Also in the year <datestruct value="1409"><year reg="1409">1409</year></datestruct>, the <num value="10">10th</num> of Henry IV., they played a Play at the Skinners' Well which lasted <num value="8">eight</num> days, and which was of matter from the Creation of the World: there were to see the same most part of the nobles and gentles in England, &amp;c.<NOTE N="**"><P>The latter performance appears to have been succeeded by &ldquo;a royal jousting in Smithfield, between the Earl of Somerset and the Seneschal of Hainault, Sir John Cornwall, Sir Richard Arundel, and the son of Sir John Cheyney, against certain Frenchmen.&rdquo; Strype's Stow's <hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, Vol. I. book iii. chap. xii. p. <num value="239">239</num>.</NOTE> Other smaller Wells were many near unto Clarks'-Well: namely, Skinners' Well, so called for that the Skinners of London held there certain Plays, yearly played, of Holy Scripture.

They comprised the whole Scripture-history, from the Creation of the World to the Day of Judgment; divided into separate portions, each consisting of a single event, sufficient for <num value="1">one</num> day's short performance: and the Prologue recited on the <num value="1">first</num> day, declared the subjects intended to be represented in the ensuing exhibitions with their order.<NOTE N="*"><P>The fullest particulars on the subject of the old English Mysteries are contained in the following works: the Introduction attached to an edition of the Chester Mysteries of Noe's Flood and the Slaughter of the Innocents, privately printed for the Roxburghe Club in <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>, <num value="4">4</num>to. by J.

<pb id="p.132" n="132"> The dialogue was generally composed in rhyming stanzas, and was probably delivered in a sort of chaunting recitative; which will account for the Parish-Clerks being in so great esteem as actors of such pieces, since they were the principal professers of vocal melody before the Reformation, and their Fraternity had the sole direction of all sacred music in churches. They were also accustomed to attend at all great funerals; in which their office was to walk before the hearse, carrying their surplices, till they came to the Church-door, singing solemn dirges all the way. From the <num value="9">ninth</num> century they were known under the name of the Fraternity of St. Nicholas, by which style they were Incorporated by Henry III. in <datestruct value="1233--"><year reg="1233">1233</year></datestruct>.<NOTE N="*"><P>Strype's Stow's <hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, Vol. II. book v. chap. xiv. p. <num value="231">231</num>.</NOTE>

<P>The <num value="1">first</num> circumstance in the modern history of Clerken-Well appears to be that in <datestruct value="1674--"><year reg="1674">1674</year></datestruct>, George Compton, <num value="4">fourth</num> Earl of Northampton, presented the Parish of St. James with that very Spring for the use of the poor during pleasure. The officers immediately leased it to John Cross, brewer, for <num value="21">twenty-one</num> years at <num value="40">40</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> per annum;<NOTE N="*"><P><hi rend=italics>Hist. of Clerkenwell</hi>, p. <num value="85">85</num>.</NOTE> and it was in his occupation in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, when the Rev. John Strype gave the following account of it. &ldquo;The Old Well of Clerken-Well, whence the Parish had its name, is still known to the inhabitants. It is on the right hand of a lane that leads from Clerken-Well to Hockley-in-the-Hole, in a bottom. <num value="1">One</num> Mr. Crosse, a brewer, hath this Well enclosed: but the water runs from him into the said place. It is enclosed with a high wall, which formerly was built to bound in Clerken-Well Close:<NOTE N="*"><P>The close alluded to belonged to the Priory of St. Mary, for Nuns of the Benedictine Order, founded at Clerken-Well soon after the year <datestruct value="1100"><year reg="1100">1100</year></datestruct>; the western wall of which is known to have taken this direction, leaving the reservoir of the fountain still farther to the west on the outside. In the large Plan of London published by Radulphus Aggas, about the year <datestruct value="1562"><year reg="1562">1562</year></datestruct>, the water of the Clerken-Well is shewn rushing in a considerable stream through a circular aperture in the wall of a house on this spot into a kind of square basin, or receptacle within <num value="3">three</num> low walls built out from the house. Another representation of the Springs upon this spot, still more ancient, is a drawing by George Vertue executed for the Society of Antiquaries, from an old parchment roll belonging to Nicholas Mann, Esq., shewn by Mr. Birch in <datestruct value="1747--"><year reg="1747">1747</year></datestruct>; consisting of a survey of the Wells and Waters of St. John. Clerken-Well, and of the Charter House, with a plan of that edifice, the cells, and the Chapter house, originally made in <datestruct value="1511--"><year reg="1511">1511</year></datestruct>. In the Plan of St. James's Parish, Clerken-Well, of <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, inserted in Strype's Stow's <hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, Vol. II. book iv. chap. iii. p. <num value="63">63</num>, the street in which the Spring is situate is without a name; but the north-west part of it which terminates in the fields is marked Town's End Lane. After that time it was named <hi rend=italics>Rag</hi> Street, from the number of dealers in rags and old iron who resided in it; but since <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct> it has been called Ray-street, as it is at present. <hi rend=italics>History of Clerkenwell</hi>, p. <num value="261">261</num>.</NOTE> the present Well being also enclosed with another lower wall from the street. The way to it is through a little house, which was the watch-house: you go down a good many steps to it. The Well had formerly iron-work and brass cocks, which are now cut off: the water spins through the old wall. I was there, and tasted the water, and found it excellently clear, sweet, and well-tasted. The Parish is much displeased, as some of them told me, that it is thus gone to decay, and thought to make some complaint at a Commission for Charitable Uses; hoping by that means to recover it to common use again, the water being highly esteemed hereabouts, and many from those parts send for it.&rdquo;<NOTE N="*"><P>Strype's Stow's <hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, Vol. II. book iv. chap. iii. p. <num value="69">69</num>.</NOTE>
Since the time of this statement a pump was erected over the Spring, the situation of which was altered in <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct> to a more convenient spot; and the water itself now appears to issue from the old wall with great slowness and difficulty, as if some obstruction were at the fountain-head.<NOTE N="*"><P><hi rend=italics>Hist. of Clerkenwell</hi>, p. <num value="265">265</num>.</NOTE>

<P>The annexed Engraving represents an Inscription upon a cast-iron tablet fixed upon the front of the present Pump, as a memorial of the site and history of this celebrated fountain. Its situation is on the north side of Ray-Street, near the eastern end by Clerken-Well Green, as indicated in the Ground Plan at the side of the View. On the western side of the Pump is the building formerly a watch-house, which in <datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct> was converted into a prison, for such persons as might be apprehended by the parochial constables for misdemeanours on Sundays: it is now, however, very little used, &mdash;seldom, or never, on Sundays,&mdash;but occasionally during the week persons are confined in it for offences committed before the watch be set. The Pump itself is of iron, let into the wall of a low shop on the eastern side of it, long noted for the sale of birds; the cages of which are hung round the front so as almost to obscure the white panel with the inscription. Of that inscription, the work whence several of the present notices have been derived, observes that part of the information conveyed by it is not only gratuitous, but unlikely to be accurate. It is there stated, that &ldquo;the water was greatly esteemed by the Prior and Brethren of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem;&rdquo; but their House had a copious supply within its own precinct, and had no reason to resort to a finer spring than that immediately without the north wall of the Hospital court, which now supplies the pump before the Charity-School in Aylesbury Street. It is also further asserted, that &ldquo;the Spring by which it is supplied is situated <num value="4">four</num> feet eastward;&rdquo; which rightly indicates the place of the <hi rend=italics>former pump</hi>, but the <hi rend=italics>water issues forth about</hi> <num value="25">25</num> <hi rend=italics>feet northward.</hi> There it falls into an oblong receptacle paved with square tiles, extending beneath the former watch-house and the adjoining shop; the dimensions of which receptacle are somewhat more than <num value="25">25</num> feet by <num value="9">9</num>. An aperture in the floor enables the curious inquirer to descend by a ladder, and view the outlet of the fountain, which is extremely minute; so that in summer, when the water is in the greatest request, the store is frequently exhausted and the pavement left dry.<NOTE N="*"><P>The flow of water issuing from these Springs, appears to have been always uncertain and liable to fail. When the Earl of Exeter resided in St. John's Square, in <datestruct value="1637--"><year reg="1637">1637</year></datestruct>, and required to be furnished from the White-Conduit which supplied the Charter-house, the governors of that establishment refused to let him have the water from the fountain-head, but allowed him a pipe from the water-house of the Hospital, carrying at the rate of <num value="2">two</num> gallons an hour. The pipes which conveyed this water to the Charter-house were cleaned in <datestruct value="1654--"><year reg="1654">1654</year></datestruct>; but the supply was then so much reduced, that the governors ordered the New River water to be adopted instead.</NOTE> The Spring is approached from its receptacle by steps, over which is a brick arch; most probably erected at the restoration of the well, since the time of Strype.<NOTE N="**"><P><hi rend=italics>Hist. of Clerkenwell</hi>, pp. <num value="263">263</num>, <num value="264">264</num>, <num value="287">287</num>.</NOTE>

<P>The situation of the other celebrated Spring of this place called Skinners' Well, is now altogether unknown; and even in the period of Strype was very doubtful. &ldquo;It is almost,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;quite lost; and was so in Stow's time: but I was certainly informed by a knowing parishioner, that it lies on the west of the Church, enclosed within certain houses there. The Parish would fain recover this Well again, but cannot tell where the pipes lie. But Dr. Roger, who formerly lived in a house there, showed Mr. E(dmund) H(oward), late churchwarden, <measure value="2bmark" type=currency><num value="2">two</num> marks</measure> in a wall in the close, where as he affirmed the pipes laid, that it might be known after his death.&rdquo;<NOTE N="*"><P>Strype's Stow's <hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, Vol. II. book iv. chap. iii. p. <num value="69">69</num>. The other wells of Clerken-Well were dammed up in the time of Stow; &ldquo;And so remained,&rdquo; adds Strype, &ldquo;and altogether unknown, till within these <num value="40">forty</num> years or thereabouts (<datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>), when, upon some occasion, they or some of them were new discovered: and being found mineral waters, of the nature of Tunbridge, they became greatly frequented by Citizens, and used as chalybeate waters for correcting hypochondriacal distempers.&rdquo; It is stated in <hi rend=italics>The History of Clerkenwell</hi>, p. <num value="266">266</num>, that the position of another of the wells mentioned by Stow near the Church, had been recently discovered in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>.</NOTE>

<P>On the <placename>Bankside</placename>, seem to have preceded, in point of time, the several other ancient Theatres of the metropolis. The precise date of their erection is not ascertained, but a <hi rend=italics>bear-garden</hi> on the Bankside is mentioned by <num value="1">one</num> CROWLEY, a poet, of the reign of Henry VIII. as being at that time in existence. He informs us, that the exhibitions were on a <hi rend=italics>Sunday</hi>, that they drew full assemblies, and that the price of admission was then <hi rend=italics><num value="1">one</num> halfpenny!</hi>

<P>Whether these &ldquo;rough games,&rdquo; as a certain author terms them, were then exhibited in the same, or similar amphitheatres, to those afterwards engraved in our old plans, or in the open air, the poet does not inform us. Nor does Stowe's account afford any better idea. He merely tells us, that there were on the west bank &ldquo;<hi rend=italics><num value="2">two</num> beargardens</hi>, the <hi rend=italics>old</hi> and the <hi rend=italics>new;</hi> places, wherein were kept beares, bulls, and other beasts to be bayted; as also mastives in several kenels, nourished to bayt them. These beares and other beasts,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;are there kept in plots of ground, scaffolded about, for the beholders to stand safe.&rdquo; 
<P>In <name>Aggas's</name> plan, taken <datestruct value="1574--"><year reg="1574">1574</year></datestruct>, and the plan of BRAUN, made about the same time, these plots of ground are engraved, with the addition of <num value="2">two</num> <hi rend=italics>circi</hi>, for the accommodation of the spectators, bearing the names of the &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Bowll Baytyng</hi>, and the <hi rend=italics>Beare Baytynge.</hi>&rdquo; These are accurately copied in the accompanying Plate.<NOTE N="*"><P>Plate I.</NOTE> In both plans, the buildings appear to be completely circular, and were evidently intended as humble imitations of the ancient Roman amphitheatre. They stand, agreeable to the preceding description, in <num value="2">two</num> adjoining fields, separated only by a small slip of land; but some differences are observable in the spots on which they are built. 
<P>In Aggas's plan, which is the earliest, the disjoining slip of land contains only <num value="1">one</num> large pond, common to the <num value="2">two</num> places of exhibition; but in Braun, this appears divided into <hi rend=italics><num value="3">three</num></hi> ponds, besides a similar conveniency near each Theatre. The use of these pieces of water is very well explained in Brown's Travels (<datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>), who has given, at page <num value="168">168</num>, a plate of the &ldquo;Elector of Saxony his Beare Garden at Dresden,&rdquo; in which is a large pond, with several bears amusing themselves in it; his account of which is highly curious: 
<P>&ldquo;In the hunting-house, in the old town,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;are <num value="15">fifteen</num> bears, very well provided for, and looked unto. They have <hi rend=italics>fountains</hi> and <hi rend=italics>ponds</hi>, to wash themselves in, wherein they much delight: and near to the pond are high <hi rend=italics>ragged posts</hi> or <hi rend=italics>trees</hi>, set up for the bears to climb up, and <hi rend=italics>scaffolds</hi> made at the top, to sun and dry themselves; where they will also sleep, and come and go as the keeper calls them.&rdquo; 
<P>The ponds, and dog-kennels, for the bears on the Bankside, are clearly marked in the plans alluded to; and the construction of the amphitheatres themselves may be tolerably well conceived, notwithstanding the smallness of the scale on which they are drawn. They evidently consisted, within-side, of a lower tier of circular seats for the spectators, at the back of which, a sort of screen ran all round, in part open, so as to admit a view from without, evident in Braun's delineation, by the figures who are looking through, on the outside. The buildings are unroofed, and in both plans shewn during the time of performance, which in Aggas's view is announced by the display of little flags or streamers on the top. The dogs are tied up in slips near each, ready for the sport, and the combatants actually engaged in Braun's plan. <num value="2">Two</num> little houses for retirement are at the head of each Theatre. 
<P>The amusement of <hi rend=italics>bear-baiting</hi> in England existed, however, long before the mention here made of it. In the Northumberland Household Book,<NOTE N="*"><P>Compiled in the reign of Henry VII. and since privately printed.</NOTE> page <num value="253">253</num>, enumerating &ldquo;al maner of rewardis customable usede yerely <pb id="p.134" n="134"> to be yeven by my Lorde to strangers, as players, mynstraills or any other strangers, whatsomever they be,&rdquo; are the following: 
<P>&ldquo;Furst, my Lorde usith and accustomyth to gyff yerely, the Kynge or the Queene's <hi rend=italics>barwarde.</hi> If they have <num value="1">one</num>, when they custome to com unto hym, yerely&mdash;vj. s. viij. d.&rdquo; 
<P>&ldquo;Item, my Lorde usith and accustomyth to gyfe yerly, when his Lordshipe is at home, to his <hi rend=italics>barward</hi>, when he comyth to my Lorde in Christmas, with his Lordshippe's beests, for makynge of his Lordship pastyme, the sayd xij. days&mdash;xx. s.&rdquo; 
<P>It made <num value="1">one</num> of the favourite amusements of the romantic age of Queen Elizabeth, and was introduced among the princely pleasures of Kenilworth in <datestruct value="1575--"><year reg="1575">1575</year></datestruct>, where the droll author of the account introduces the bear and dogs deciding their ancient grudge <hi rend=italics>per duellum.</hi><NOTE N="*"><P>Princely Pleasures of Kenilworth, p. <num value="22">22</num>, quoted by Mr. Pennant, in his Account of London, page <num value="36">36</num>.</NOTE>

<P>It is not to be wondered at, that an amusement, thus patronized by the great, and even by royalty itself, ferocious as it was, should be the delight of the vulgar, whose untutored taste it was peculiarly calculated to please. Accordingly bear-baiting seems to have been amazingly frequented, at this time, especially on <hi rend=italics>Sundays.</hi>
On <num value="1">one</num> of these days, in <datestruct value="1582--"><year reg="1582">1582</year></datestruct>, a dire accident befell the spectators. The scaffolding suddenly gave way, and multitudes of people were killed, or miserably maimed. This was looked upon as a judgment, and as such was noticed by divines, and other grave characters, in their sermons aud writings. The Lord Mayor for that year (Sir Thomas Blanke) wrote on the occasion to the Lord Treasurer, &ldquo;that it gave great reason to acknowledge the hand of God, for breach of the Lord's Day,&rdquo; and moved him to redress the same. 
<P>Little notice, however, was taken of his application; the accident was forgot; and the barbarous amusement soon followed as much as ever. 
<P>In the succeeding reign, the general introduction of the drama operated as a check to the practice, and the public taste took a turn. <num value="1">One</num> of these theatres gave place to the GLOBE; the other remained long after. This <num value="2">second</num> theatre, which retained its original name of the <hi rend=italics>Bear-baiting</hi>, was rebuilt on a larger scale, about the beginning of James the <num value="1">First</num>'s reign; and of an octagonal form instead of round, as before; in which respect it resembled the other theatres on the Bankside. Plate II. contains a view of it in this state, from the long print of London by <hi rend=italics>Vischer</hi>, usually called the Antwerp view.<NOTE N="*"><P>A copy of this view is in the Pepysian Library, Cambridge; a duplicate, from which the present print was taken, was lately in my possession, and has been since purchased by John Dent, Esq.&mdash;EDITOR.</NOTE> In this representation, the slips, or dog-kennels, are again distinctly marked, as well as the ponds. Plate III. shews it as it was a <num value="3">third</num> time rebuilt on a larger scale, and again of the circular shape,<NOTE N="*"><P>This is copied from the large <num value="4">four</num>-sheet view of London, by Hollar, made about <datestruct value="1648--"><year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> when <hi rend=italics>plays</hi> and prize-fighting were added to the amusements exhibited at it. 
<P>In the reign of James I. the &ldquo;Bear-garden&rdquo; was under the protection of royalty, and the mastership of it made a patent place. The celebrated actor <hi rend=italics>Alleyn</hi> enjoyed this lucrative post, being for several years keeper of the King's wild beasts, or master of the royal Bear-garden, situated on the Bankside, in Southwark. The profits of this place are said by his biographer to have been immense, sometimes amounting to <num value="500">500</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> a year; and well account for the great fortune he raised. A little before his death he sold his share and patent to his wife's father Mr. Hinchtoe, for <num value="580">580</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>

<P>We have a good account of the &ldquo;Bear-baiting,&rdquo; in the reign of Charles II. by <num value="1">one</num> Mons. Jorevin, a foreigner, whose observations on this country were published in <datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>,<NOTE N="*"><P>Republished in the Antiquarian Repertory, Ed. <datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, under the title of &ldquo;A Description of England and Ireland, in the <num value="17">17th</num> Century, by Mons. Jorevin.&rdquo; Vol. iv. p. <num value="549">549</num>.</NOTE> and who has given us the following curious detail of a visit he paid to it: 
<P>&ldquo;We went to see the BERGIARDIN, by SODOARK,<NOTE N="*"><P>Bear-garden, Southwark.</NOTE> <hi rend=italics>which is a great amphitheatre</hi>, where combats are fought between all sorts of animals, and sometimes men, as we once saw. Commonly, when any fencing-masters are desirous of shewing their courage and their great skill, they issue mutual challenges, and, before they engage, parade the town with drums and trumpets sounding, to inform the public there is a challenge between <num value="2">two</num> brave masters of the science of defence, and that the battle will be fought on such a day. We went to see this combat which was performed on a stage <hi rend=italics>in the middle</hi> of this Amphitheatre, where, on the flourishes of trumpets, and the beat of drums, the combatants entered, stripped to their shirts. On a signal from the drum, they drew their swords, and immediately began the fight, skirmishing a long time without any wounds. They were both very skilful and courageous. The tallest had the advantage over the least; for according to the English fashion of fencing, they endeavoured rather to cut, than push in the French manner, so that by his height he had the advantage of being able to strike his antagonist on the head, against which, the little <num value="1">one</num> was on his guard. He had, in his turn, an advantage over the great <num value="1">one</num>, in being able to give him the Jarnac stroke, by cutting him on his right ham, which he left in a manner quite unguarded. So that, all things considered, they were equally matched. Nevertheless the tall <num value="1">one</num> struck his antagonist on the wrist, which he almost cut off; but this did not prevent him from continuing the fight, after he had been dressed, and taken a glass or <num value="2">two</num> of wine to <pb id="p.135" n="135"> give him courage, when he took ample vengeance for his wound; for a little afterwards, making a feint at the ham, the tall man, stooping in order to parry it, laid his whole head open, when the little <num value="1">one</num> gave him a stroke, which took off a slice of his head, and almost all his ear. For my part, I think there is an inhumanity, a barbarity and cruelty, in permitting men to kill each other for diversion. The surgeons immediately dressed them, and bound up their wounds; which being done, they resumed the combat, and both being sensible of their respective disadvantages, they therefore were a long time without giving or receiving a wound, which was the cause that the little <num value="1">one</num>, failing to parry so exactly, being tired with this long battle, received a stroke on his wounded wrist, which dividing the sinews, he remained vanquished, and the tall conqueror received the applause of the spectators. For my part, I should have had more pleasure in seeing the battle of the <hi rend=italics>bears</hi> and 
<hi rend=italics>dogs</hi>, which was fought the <hi rend=italics>following day on the same Theatre.</hi>&rdquo; 
<P>It does not appear at what period the Bear-baiting was destroyed, but it was, probably, not long after the above period. Strype, in his <num value="1">first</num> edition of Stowe, published <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, speaking of &ldquo;Bear Alley,&rdquo; on this spot, says, &ldquo;Here is a glass-house, and about the middle a <hi rend=italics>new-built</hi> court, well inhabited, called <hi rend=italics>Beargarden Square;</hi> so called, as built in the place where the Bear-garden formerly stood, until removed to the other side of the water; which is more convenient for the butchers, and such like, who are taken with such rustic sports as the baiting of bears and bulls.&rdquo;<NOTE N="*"><P>Vol. ii. p. <num value="28">28</num>.</NOTE> The Theatre was evidently destroyed to build this then <hi rend=italics>new</hi>
court. 
<P>It may seem going too far, to follow this sport to the other side of the water, whither Strype describes it to have emigrated, and where it was jointly encouraged with its former companion, <hi rend=italics>prize-fighting.</hi> But as many of our old Theatres appear to have been appropriated, on their desertion, to this latter amusement, an account of its modern state, as a companion to the Frenchman's narrative, shall form the conclusion of this article. 
<P><num value="1">One</num> <hi rend=italics>Figg</hi> was the most renowned continuator of this species of spectacle, which his admirers termed &ldquo;the noble science of self-defence;&rdquo; but which Maitland<NOTE N="*"><P>Vol. ii. p. <datestruct value="1327--"><year reg="1327">1327</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> more properly designates as a &ldquo;barbarous performance, by those whom necessity (occasioned by a scandalous laziness and indolence) induces to expose themselves to be horribly mangled for a little money, while the bloodily-minded spectators satiate themselves with human gore, to the great reproach of religion.&rdquo; This man was in high vogue about the year <datestruct value="1731"><year reg="1731">1731</year></datestruct>, and kept a school for instruction in Oxford Street. 
<P>Hogarth engraved his card, a copy of which is given in Samuel Ireland's Graphic Illustrations of that artist (p. <num value="89">89</num>), where is the following account of him, and his exhibitions: 
<P>&ldquo;A portrait of Figg is introduced in the <num value="2">second</num> plate of the Rake's Progress, amongst other high characters who were to assist in finishing his education. In celebrating the feats of this valiant &lsquo;master of fence,&rsquo; the pen as well as the pencil, was frequently employed; and as the rage for single combat, in some <num value="1">one</num> or other of its forms, seems as prevalent now as at any former period, it may not prove unpleasant to the amateur, to find in what style his encomiasts held him forth. Captain John Godfrey, in his Treatise upon the useful Science of Defence, published in quarto, <datestruct value="1747--"><year reg="1747">1747</year></datestruct>, page <num value="41">41</num>, says, &lsquo;Figg was the Atlas of the sword; and may he remain the gladiating statue! In him strength, resolution, and unparalleled judgment conspired to form a perfect master. There was a majesty shone in his countenance, and blazed in all his actions, beyond all I ever saw. His right leg, bold and firm: and his left, which could hardly ever be disturbed, gave him the surprising advantage already proved, and struck his adversary with despair and panic. He had that peculiar way of stepping in, I spoke of, in a parry; he knew his arm, and its just time of moving; put a firm faith in that, and never let his adversary escape his parry. He was just as much a greater master than any other I ever saw, as he was a greater judge of time and measure.&rsquo;&rdquo; 
<P>We shall close our account of this wonderful character, by transcribing <num value="1">one</num> of the heroic advertisements that appeared in the daily papers of that time. 
<P>&ldquo;At Mr. Figg's Great Room, at his house, the sign of the City of Oxford, in Oxford Road, to-morrow, Wednesday, the <datestruct VALUE="-11-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, the Nobility and Gentry will be entertained (for the last time this season), in a most extraordinary manner, with a select trial of skill in the Science of Defence, by <num value="4">four</num> following masters, viz. 
<P>&ldquo;We, William Holmes and Felix Mac Guire, the <num value="2">two</num> <num value="1">first</num> and most profound swordsmen in the kingdom of Ireland, whom in combat the universe never yet could parallel, being requested to return to our native country, are determined to make our departure ever memorable to Great Britain, by taking our solemn public leave of the renowned Mr. Figg and Mr Sutton, at the time and place appointed; to which we hereby invite them, in order to prove we can maintain our titles, and claim a preference in the list of worthies. &lsquo;Tis not the accidental blow Mr. Holmes received on his metacarpus, the last time he fought Mr. Figg, has shocked his courage, or given room for Mr. Mac Guire to decline his interest; no, it has been the fate of the best of generals to retreat, and yet to conquer; and the loss of a leg or an arm has augmented the glory of a commander, because blind fortune, and not the want of conduct, forfeited a limb, which force nor envy e'er could take away. <pb id="p.136" n="136"> 
<P>&ldquo;We, James Figg, from Thame, in Oxfordshire, and Edward Sutton, of renowned Kent, by the lofty language and pointed similes of the above bravo's, guess at their aspiring minds, and sincerely promise, since they covet to be great men, that if, at the time and place appointed, they obtain a victory by the sword, we will present them with our truncheons, being <num value="4">four</num> foot longer than that with which Alexander was honoured at the head of his army, and far more serviceable in case of a rupture: on the other hand, if it be our fortune to deprive them of their intended glory in <num value="1">one</num> sense, we will endeavour to be grateful in another, by sending them home admirals like Bembo or Carter, whose names, the loss of a leg and an arm, made ever memorable, and may serve for the copy of their departure, if blind fortune (as they call it) act according to custom, &amp;c. 
<P>&ldquo;NOTE: Mr. Holmes and Mr. Figg are to fight the <num value="1">first</num> bout; Mr. Mac Guire and Mr. Sutton the <num value="2">second</num>; Mr. Holmes alternately with Mr. Figg: Mr. Mac Guire and Mr. Sutton in like manner, and so successively during the battle; and, if <num value="1">one</num> be disabled, his associate to go through the weapons with his <num value="2">two</num> antagonists. A full house being expected, gentlemen are desired to meet sooner than usual, the masters being commanded to mount at <num value="3">three</num> precisely, by reason of the shortness of the days, and the length of a double battle, &amp;c.&rdquo;

<P>The precise period at which this theatre was <num value="1">first</num> erected, it would be difficult to ascertain; but from such evidences as we have been able to collect, it appears to have been built some time between the years <datestruct value="1570--"><year reg=1570>1570</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1580--"><year reg=1580>1580</year></datestruct>. It stood on a plot of ground situated between the upper end of St. John's Street and Clerkenwell Green, the site of which is distinguished in the plan of Clerkenwell parish inserted in the <num value="1">first</num> edition of Strype's Stowe, <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, and in that of London published by Rocque in the year <datestruct value="1738"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct>, by the name of &ldquo;RED BULL YARD.&rdquo; This name it retained for many years afterwards, when it received its present <num value="1">one</num> of &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Woodbridge Street</hi>,&rdquo; in compliment to the college at Woodbridge, in Suffolk, of which the ground forms <num value="1">one</num> of the estates. 
<P>The editor of this work has not been able to discover any trace of the playhouse itself, which, from its being disused as a theatre soon after the Restoration of Charles II., it is probable has long since given way to, or been incorporated with, modern buildings. The spot it occupied may, however, be easily guessed, and, perhaps, is exactly pointed out in existing leases. The parish-books of Clerkenwell, which have been obligingly searched for information by W. Cook, Esq., the vestry clerk, unfortunately throw no light on our inquiries relative to the Red Bull, as they contain accounts of a recent date only. 
<P>The following titles of scarce plays, performed at this theatre, were communicated by a correspondent, and prove its existence as early as the latter end of Elizabeth's reign:&mdash; 
<P><title>The <num value="4">Four</num> &rsquo;Prentices of London,</title> an Historical Play, by Thomas Heywood, acted at the <hi rend=italics>Red Bull</hi>, by the Queen's Servants. <num value="4">4</num>to.; printed <datestruct value="1615--"><year reg="1615">1615</year></datestruct>.

<P>&ldquo;THE <num value="7">SEVEN</num> CHAMPIONS OF CHRISTENDOME,&rdquo; by John Kirke. Acted at the Cockpit, and at the <hi rend=italics>Bull</hi>, in St. John's Street. <num value="4">4</num>to.; <datestruct value="1638--"><year reg="1638">1638</year></datestruct>. 
<P>The time when the last play was represented is uncertain; but it was probably at a much later period than the preceding ones. 
<P>In the early part of the reign of Charles I. the Red Bull was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="6">six</num> theatres then allowed in London, and seems to have been much frequented; but chiefly by the lower order of people. This we learn, as well as the nature of its performances, from a passage in a poem addressed to Mr. D&lsquo;Avenant (afterwards <hi rend=italics>Sir</hi> William), on his play of &ldquo;The Just Italian,&rdquo; by a gentleman of the court:<NOTE N="*"><P>Poems by Thomas Care, Esquire, <num value="1">one</num> of the Gentlemen of the Privie Chamber, and Sewer in Ordinary to His Majesty. <num value="2">2nd</num> Edit., <num value="12">12</num>mo., <datestruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct>, p. <num value="162">162</num>.</NOTE>

<P>In the preface to the <num value="2">second</num> part of this scarce book, the compiler details some particulars of the Red Bull, and the state of theatricals at that period, which are highly amusing: 
<P>&ldquo;When the publique theatres were shut up, and the actors forbidden to present us with any of their tragedies, because we had enough of that in earnest; and comedies, because therein the vices of the age were too lively and smartly represented; then all that we could divert ourselves with were these humours and pieces of plays, which passing under the name of a merry conceited fellow, called <hi rend=italics>Bottom the Weaver, Simpleton the Smith, John Swabber</hi>, or some such title, were allowed us, and that by stealth too, and under pretence of rope-dancing, or the like; and these being all that was permitted us, great was the confluence of the auditors; and these small things were as profitable, and as great getpennies to the actors, as any of our late famed plays. I have seen the RED BULL playhouse, <hi rend=italics>which was a large <num value="1">one</num></hi>, so full, that as many went back for want of room, as had entered; and as meanly as you may now think of these drols, they were then acted by the best comedians, then and now in being; and, I may say, by some that then exceeded all now living; by name: the incomparable <hi rend=italics>Robert Cox</hi>, who was not only a principal actor, but also the contriver and author of most of these farces. How have I heard him cryed up for his <hi rend=italics>John Swabber</hi>, and <hi rend=italics>Simpleton the Smith?</hi> in which latter, he being to appear with a large piece of bread and butter, I have frequently known several of the female spectators and auditors to long for some of it: and once that well-known natural <hi rend=italics>Jack Adams</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Clarkenwell</hi>, seeing him with bread and butter on the stage, and knowing him, cryed out, &lsquo;Buz, buz, give me some, give me some!&rsquo; to the great pleasure of the audience.<NOTE N="*"><P>The Jack Adams here mentioned, was a character well-known at the time, and whose nativity is calculated in Partridge's Almanack for the year <datestruct value="1809"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, with the following notice: &ldquo;I shall now give my readers the nativity of Jack Adams, a native of Clerkenwell parish, London; who was born an idiot, or so great a natural, that the parish not only maintained him, but allowed a nurse to attend him to preserve him from harm. This <hi rend=italics>Jack Adams</hi> was born the <datestruct VALUE="-12-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> day of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, at <num value="11">11</num> o'clock at night, <datestruct value="1625--"><year reg="1625">1625</year></datestruct>; and was so great a natural, as to be obliged to wear long coats, besides other marks or tokens of stupidity.&rdquo;</NOTE> And so naturally did he act the Smith's part, that being at a fair in a country town, and that farce being presented, the only master smith of the town came to him, saying, &lsquo;Well, although your father speaks so ill of you, yet when the <hi rend=italics>fair</hi> is done, if you will come and work with me, I will give you <measure value="12d." type=currency><num value="12">twelve</num> pence</measure> a week more than I give any other journey man.&rsquo; Thus was he taken for a smith bred, that was indeed as much of any trade.<NOTE N="*"><P>To explain the above anecdote, and give a specimen of these Drolls, take the following from the book itself. Title: &ldquo;The Conceited Humours of Simpleton the Smith.&rdquo; 
<emph>Argument needless, It being a thorow Farce, and very well known.</emph>

<emph>Simpleton the Old, Simpleton the Young, Doll, a Wench, &amp;c. 
<hi rend=italics>Enter Old</hi> SIMPLETON.</emph>

<P><hi rend=italics>Old Simp.</hi> If ever dog was weary of his day, then have I cause to be weary of my life. I am a blacksmith by my trade; and although I say it, I have been counted a good workman too; but I could never yet forge or hammer out means enough to satisfy the insatiate gut of my son, Simpleton. He hath a stomach may well defye a gyant, or the great eater of Kent: for no sooner is his head out of the ale, but his nose is in the pantry. But I have thought of a course, which he shall either take in hand, or graze with <hi rend=italics>Hob</hi> my horse. Here, sirrah, Simpleton, where are you? 
<P><hi rend=italics>Y. Simp.</hi> Here, here, father. 
<P><hi rend=italics>O. Simp.</hi> Where, where, sirrah! 
<P><hi rend=italics>Y. Simp.</hi> At the <hi rend=italics>cupboard</hi>, Father; at the <hi rend=italics>cupboard.</hi>

<P><hi rend=italics>O. Simp.</hi> I thought as much. But come you hither, sirrah, or I shall make your ear sing prick-song for you. 
<emph><hi rend=italics>Enter Young</hi> SIMPLETON <hi rend=italics>with a</hi> GREAT PIECE OF BREAD AND BUTTER!</emph>

<P><hi rend=italics>Y. Simp.</hi> &lsquo;Tis a miserable condition, that a man cannot eat a little bit for his afternoon's lunchin, but he must be disturbed in the best of his stomach. 
<P><hi rend=italics>O. Simp.</hi> A bit! dost thou call it? O&lsquo;my conscience, this devouring rascal, old as I am, would eat <hi rend=italics>me</hi> if he found me in the cupboard. 
<P><hi rend=italics>Y. Simp.</hi> I do not think there is such a genteel smith in the town, that hath such an old niggardly coxcomb. He knows I have no better a stomach than a young green-sickness girl, and yet he grutches me every bit I eat. 
<P><hi rend=italics>O. Simp.</hi> Leave off your muttering, and lend me an ear a while. 
<P>The old man then proposes a marriage to his son with Doll, whom the latter serenades with a viol under her chamber-window. She, disturbed by his noise, empties the urinal on his head, &amp;c., and finally is run away with by a young gentleman.&mdash;Such was the trash which then pleased!</NOTE>
<pb id="p.139" n="139"> 
<P>&ldquo;Thus were these compositions liked and approved by all; and they were the fittest for the actors to represent, there being little costs in cloaths, <hi rend=italics>which often were in great danger to be seized by the then souldiers</hi>, who, as the poet says, <hi rend=italics>Enter the Red Coat, Exit Hat and Cloak</hi>, was very true, not only in the audience, but the actors too were commonly, not only stripped, but many times imprisoned, till they paid such ransom as the souldiers would impose upon them; so that it was hazardous to act anything that required any good cloaths; instead of which <hi rend=italics>painted cloaths</hi> many times served the turn to represent rich habits. Indeed, poetry and painting are of kin, being the effects of fancy; and <num value="1">one</num> oftentimes helps the other, as in our ingenious and rich scenes, which show to the eye what the actor represents to the ear. And this painting puts me in mind of a piece I once saw in a country inn, where was, with the best skill of the workman, represented King <hi rend=italics>Pharaoh</hi>, with <hi rend=italics>Moses</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Aaron</hi>, and some others: to explain which figures was added this piece of poetry: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Here Pharaoh, with his goggle eyes, does stare on 
<L>The high priest Moses, with the prophet Aaron. 
<L>Why, what a rascal 
<L>Was he that would not let the people go to 
<L>Eat the phascal.</QUOTE>

<P>&ldquo;The painting was every wayes as defective and lame as the poetry; for, I believe, he who pictured King Pharaoh, had never seen a king in his life, for all the majesty he was represented with was goggle eyes, that his picture might be answerable to the verse. But enough of this story; which pleasing me, I must confess I have forced in here, hoping it will please you too, and then I have my ends.&rdquo; 
<P>Monarchy and the stage being restored together, the remnants of the <num value="6">six</num> scattered playhouses which had subsisted in Charles the <num value="1">First</num>'s time, were formed into <num value="1">one</num> company, <hi rend=italics>and acted for the <num value="1">first</num> time at the Red Bull playhouse.</hi>
Here, and at Gibbons's Tennis Court, Clare Market (where they built a temporary theatre), they continued acting in all <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, <datestruct value="1661--"><year reg="1661">1661</year></datestruct>, <datestruct value="1662--"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>, and <datestruct value="1663--"><year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct>, when Killigrew got his patent. 
<P>From this period it is probable that the Red Bull became disused as a place of amusement, as no further mention is made of it, amongst the theatres of the metropolis, which were soon afterwards removed to politer parts of the town.

<P>The view of the inside of the Red Bull, accompanying this account, forms the frontispiece to Kirkman's book, from which we have so largely quoted. The print has no name under it, but was evidently intended to represent that theatre, as the place where these drolls were principally, and for a time <hi rend=italics>exclusively</hi>, acted. And it is more expressly designated, by the publishers having assembled on the stage all the chief performers of that house <pb id="p.140" n="140"> in the leading characters of each droll; and amongst them <hi rend=italics>Cox</hi>, the hero, author, and probably stage manager of that concern.<NOTE N="*"><P>The characters shown in the plate are Sir John Falstaff and the Hostess, Clause, French Dancing Master, Changeling, Simpleton, and the Clown. These, no doubt, are meant, at least as far as regards dress, as portraits of the leading actors in the principal drolls performed at the <hi rend=italics>Red Bull</hi>, and subsequently printed by Kirkman: though we only know the name of <num value="1">one</num> of them, viz., Robert Cox, who is represented as playing Simpleton. The names of the pieces to which these characters belonged, were, &ldquo;The Bouncing Knight,&rdquo; from Shakspeare's Merry Wives of Windsor; &ldquo;The Lame Commonwealth,&rdquo; altered from the Beggar's Bush; &ldquo;Monsieur, the French Dancing Master,&rdquo; a piece compressed from The Varieties; Simpleton, the Smith, a piece so named; and &ldquo;The Bubble,&rdquo; from Green's Tu Quoque.<NOTE N="(a)"><P>See Brome's Cunning Lovers, p. <num value="19">19</num>. The Clown uses the expression, &ldquo;Tu quoque.&rdquo; Query, Whether it was not peculiar to Clowns? &mdash;A remark by Mr. Douce.</NOTE>
&ldquo;The most part of these pieces,&rdquo; the publisher tells us, &ldquo;were written by such persons as were known to be the ablest artists that ever this nation produced, by name, <hi rend=italics>Shakespear, Fletcher, Johnson, Shirley</hi>, and others. And these collections,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;are the very souls of their writings, if the witty parts thereof may be so termed. And the other small pieces composed by several authors, are such as have been of great fame in this last age.&rdquo;</NOTE>

<P>Of the actors here it is not easy to make a catalogue. <hi rend=italics>Cox</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Kirkman</hi> have been noticed. The celebrated 
<hi rend=italics>Tarlton</hi> is also said to have performed at this house, which he might have done from its vicinity to the CURTAIN at Holliwell, of which we know he was a member. 
<P><hi rend=italics>Thomas Jordan</hi> was an actor belonging to the company at the Red Bull. He flourished in the reign of Charles the <num value="1">First</num>, and was <num value="1">one</num> of the few players and poets who lived to see the restoration of Charles the <num value="2">Second</num>. On the death of John Tatham, he succeeded him as city poet, or pageant-writer to the Lord Mayor, and regularly composed the pageants from the year <datestruct value="1671"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1684--"><year reg="1684">1684</year></datestruct>.

After struggling in vain with the difficulties of those times, its company was dispersed, and it was offered for sale <datestruct value="1661--"><year reg="1661">1661</year></datestruct>; but although it was temporarily opened in the reign of CHARLES II.; the efforts of such Comedians as could be collected, counteracted as they were by the companies of Sir <hi rend=italics>William Davenant</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Henry Killegrew</hi>, Esq. could be attended with very little success.

<P>The <hi rend=italics>vestige</hi>, of which our plate exhibits a correct view, is the front of this once famed <hi rend=italics>Fortune Theatre</hi>, situate in 
<hi rend=italics>Golden Lane</hi>, formerly in the parish of <hi rend=italics>St. Giles, Cripplegate</hi>, now in that of <hi rend=italics>St. Luke, Middlesex</hi>; which, although at present so deplorable in its appearance, and abject in its vicinity, was, when under the direction of <hi rend=italics>Alleyn</hi>, of considerable importance, as a source of dramatic amusement to the inhabitants of <hi rend=italics>Finsbury</hi> and <hi rend=italics>London</hi>; and which has, we think, been subsequently <hi rend=italics>immortalized</hi>, when viewed as the <hi rend=italics>seed</hi>, the <hi rend=italics>germ</hi>, from the flourishing state of which part of the means were procured,<NOTE N="*"><P><hi rend=italics>Alleyn</hi>
had also, in conjunction with his brother-in-law, <hi rend=italics>Henslow</hi>, the <hi rend=italics>lucrative</hi> place of keeper of his <hi rend=italics>Majesty's Bears</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>Royal Bearward</hi>, by which he is said to have cleared <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> per annum.</NOTE> to found and endow that truly noble and philanthropic establishment, DULWICH COLLEGE. We therefore now look with mingled pleasure and veneration at their last remains, reflecting, also, that from these harmless recreations of our ancestors, not only many persons received support at the time, but a long series of benefits have derived to their posterity. The front of the <hi rend=italics>Fortune Theatre</hi> displayed in the annexed print, on which the <hi rend=italics>royal arms</hi>, and other <hi rend=italics>mutilated figures</hi> and <hi rend=italics>ornaments</hi>, executed in <hi rend=italics>stucco</hi>, are still to be seen, in the whole of its exterior now apparent; its back court, part of which was covered by the stage, dressing-rooms, &amp;c. is now laid out in mean tenements; its garden, and surrounding walks and avenues, <num value="1">one</num> of which, it appears, was once called <hi rend=italics>Armitage Alley</hi>, have been long since formed into a street, which still retains the commemorative name of <hi rend=italics>Playhouse Yard</hi>, though <hi rend=italics>Jews'-row</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>Rag-fair</hi>, would <hi rend=italics>now</hi> be far more proper appellations. 
<P>With respect to the interior of the front of this <hi rend=italics>Theatre</hi>, which, having stood near <hi rend=italics><num value="2">two</num> centuries</hi>, is rapidly hastening to oblivion, it was probably built in a more substantial manner (as it was consigned to the audience) than the back, in which we have just observed the stage, &amp;c. were placed. It is a curious circumstance still to be observed, that in the upper story the floor of the gallery yet remains, nay, the marks were the seats were fixed are to be discovered: this floor consequently descends in the same manner, though not perhaps so regular in its declination as that of the gallery of a modern Playhouse; and <num value="1">one</num> would be rather puzzled to conjecture how it was possible to place any furniture upon this inclined plane, did not <hi rend=italics>necessity</hi> solve the difficulty of the case. The poor inhabitants of this Theatre, once the mansion of <hi rend=italics>mirth</hi> and (we hope) of <hi rend=italics>morality</hi>, under the impulse of <hi rend=italics>dire necessity</hi>, do, by some means or other, contrive to accommodate their wretched beds, &amp;c. to their situation, though it is certainly like living <hi rend=italics>on a flight of stairs.</hi>

<P>The difficulties that we have hinted as attendant on the Theatre, called forth, in a very eminent degree, the genius of the manager, Mr. Rich, who may be deemed the father of the pantomime in this country; for, although his precursors, Weaver and his SIRE, made some attempts at the <hi rend=italics>revival</hi> of this <hi rend=italics>classic</hi> art, they by no means succeeded, though the former fancied he had derived them correctly from the heathen mythology.

<P>But the time when the <hi rend=italics>little Theatre</hi>, as it might comparatively be called, in Lincoln's Inn Fields, arrived at the very <hi rend=italics>acme</hi> of its success and glory, was in the year <datestruct value="1728"><year reg="1728">1728</year></datestruct>, when the celebrated piece, the &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Beggar's Opera</hi>,&rdquo;<NOTE N="*"><P>The Beggar's Opera had been offered to the company of Drury Lane, and was refused.</NOTE> commanded an uninterrupted run of <hi rend=italics><num value="63">sixty-three</num> nights</hi>, during the <num value="1">first</num> season, and, as it has been tritely, though truly said, &ldquo;made Gay rich, and Rich gay.&rdquo;<NOTE N="*"><P>This opera produced a <hi rend=italics>mania</hi> in town; it totally changed the character of the rising generations, and, as the annals of police too

<P>The contracted size of the Playhouse, compared to the amazing success of its dramas, as we have just stated, the repeated complaints of the spectators within, and of the neighbours without, though these complaints arose from very different causes, which have been already shown, together with the obvious want of <hi rend=italics>stage room</hi> for processions, and, above all, for <hi rend=italics>pantomimical exhibitions</hi>, induced the manager to determine upon the building of another Theatre: accordingly, <hi rend=italics>Covent Garden</hi> was the chosen spot, and his friend, James Sheppard, Esq.,<NOTE N="*"><P>He built <hi rend=italics>Sheppard's Market, Curzon Street, May Fair</hi>, &amp;c., and was an eminent surveyor: we believe the business of surveying was, in a great degree, divided between Morley and himself.</NOTE> was the director and architect; he formed the plan, made the design, which met with general approbation, and largely interested himself in the subscription.

<hi rend=italics>Lincoln's Inn.</hi> It will here be necessary to take a slight notice of <hi rend=italics>Hogarth's print</hi> of the removal of the <hi rend=italics>Lincoln's Inn Fields</hi> company to COVENT GARDEN, as this triumphant procession forms a part of the series of prints which we have faintly endeavoured to illustrate.

Bickerstaff's &ldquo;Unburied Dead&rdquo; was performed at Lincoln's Inn Fields in <datestruct value="1743--"><year reg="1743">1743</year></datestruct>, and many others between the above periods, but it does not appear by any regular company, which, indeed, its vicinity to the theatres would have prevented.

<P>This Theatre was <num value="1">first</num> opened by Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant (at whose sole expense it had been erected), in the spring of <datestruct value="1662--"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>, and was, as an author well acquainted with it assures us,<NOTE N="*"><P>Downes, who was book-keeper and prompter here, from its <num value="1">first</num> opening until its close, and who afterwards held the same situation at Dorset Gardens, on the uniting of the <num value="2">two</num> companies (the King's and the Duke's), until the year <datestruct value="1708"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>. He was employed in writing out parts, attending rehearsals, &amp;c.</NOTE> the <num value="1">first</num> regular theatre built after the Restoration; the <num value="1">first</num> at which scenes and decorations were brought into use; and the <num value="1">first</num> visited by King Charles II. on his return to England, who honoured its opening with his own presence, and that of his court. 
<P>The granting of <num value="2">two</num> patents, about the same time, occasioned the erection of <num value="2">two</num> companies, under the respective denominations of the &ldquo;King's Company&rdquo; and the &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Duke's Company;</hi>&rdquo; that under Killigrew being sworn the King's Servants; and the <num value="1">one</num> under D&lsquo;Avenant being sworn by my Lord Manchester, then Lord Chamberlain, to serve His Royal Highness the Duke of York, at the Theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields, which from this circumstance assumed the name of the &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Duke's Theatre;</hi>&rdquo; as the <num value="1">one</num> in Drury Lane, under Killigrew, did from the like circumstance assume the name of the &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>King's Theatre.</hi>&rdquo; 
<P>Of these <num value="2">two</num> companies, that under Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant was prior in point of time, and claims our present attention. Their comparative merits, it is perhaps impossible, at this period, to discuss fairly. Drury Lane, as the largest and principal theatre, had probably, if not the best, the more numerous company; as we learn from a list of them on its opening in <datestruct value="1663--"><year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct>, that <hi rend=italics>all</hi> the performers who had acted before the civil wars were selected and engaged for this purpose; and Kynaston, taken from the company that acted under Rhodes the bookseller, at the Cockpit, in Drury Lane.<NOTE N="*"><P>Rhodes, who afterwards became a bookseller and theatrical manager, was originally &ldquo;wardrobe-keeper&rdquo; to King Charles I.'s company of comedians in <hi rend=italics>Black Friars;</hi> but in the year <datestruct value="1659"><year reg="1659">1659</year></datestruct>, on General Monk's marching his army from Scotland into London, he got a licence from the then governing powers, to fit up a house for acting, called the &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Cockpit</hi>,&rdquo; in Drury Lane. Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant, who had removed from Rutland House (where he had been permitted to play operas), and was then performing here, on gaining his patent from the King, some time afterwards, created Rhodes's company the King's Servants, and engaged them for his new-built Theatre.</NOTE> The celebrated Nell Gwynn was <num value="1">one</num> of this company likewise, and became in a short time no inconsiderable attraction. 
<P>Sir William having completed his company in the beginning of the year <datestruct value="1662"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>, soon after the date of his patent, in order to prepare plays to open his new Theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields, then nearly finished, rehearsed the <num value="1">first</num> and <num value="2">second</num> parts of the &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Siege of Rhodes</hi>&rdquo; and the &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Witts</hi>&rdquo; at Apothecaries' Hall, and in the spring of the same year opened his house with the former of these pieces, having new scenes and decorations; the <num value="1">first</num>, says Downes, which were introduced into England.<NOTE N="*"><P>This is a mistake: for scenes had been before used in private exhibitions. It ought, therefore, to have been added, &ldquo;on a public theatre.&rdquo; Sir William had himself introduced them (probably in a less perfect state), about <num value="4">four</num> years before this period; not indeed in a play, but in an entertainment entitled &ldquo;The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru,&rdquo; expressed by vocal and instrumental music, and by <hi rend=italics>art of perspective in scenes</hi>, represented daily at the Cockpit in Drury Lane, <datestruct value="1658--"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>. Scenes of the most splendid kind had been used in the masques at court, by Inigo Jones, long before.</NOTE>

<P>Nothing could be more splendid than this opening. The King, who had never before attended a public theatre since his restoration, the Duke of York, and all the principal nobility, were present. Downes, the historian of this Theatre, and who officiated as prompter, was himself, as he informs us, to have acted the part of <hi rend=italics>Haly;</hi> but was so overawed by the august presence of the King, and the pomp that surrounded him, that he was unable to proceed in the part, and was (to use his own expression) &ldquo;for ever spoilt from being an actor.&rdquo; 
<P>From <datestruct value="1662--"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>, we have a particular account of the several new pieces got up at this Theatre, and their various success. 
<P>The Siege of Rhodes (the opening piece) ran <num value="12">twelve</num> successive nights, which, considering the comparatively small number of play-going people at that time, indicates that it must have possessed no small degree of attraction. The Siege of Rhodes was succeeded by the comedy of the &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Witts</hi>,&rdquo; written by the same author, and which was performed <num value="8">eight</num> successive nights to great houses. 
<P>Shakespeare's Hamlet, which had been some time in preparation, was next produced with a considerable degree of 
<hi rend=italics>&eacute;clat.</hi> On this occasion the celebrated Betterton made his <num value="1">first</num> attempt to represent that difficult character, in which he afterwards obtained such high celebrity, as to put all competition at defiance. His success has been ascribed in a great measure to the instructions of Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant, who taught him the part as he had seen it performed by 
<hi rend=italics>Taylor</hi> of the Black Friars playhouse, who was the original Hamlet of the author, Shakespeare's, own instructing. Betterton, however, possessed all the requisites of a great actor, as he afterwards proved in the long course of his <pb id="p.146" n="146"> professional life. This eminent tragedian had been the apprentice of Rhodes, the bookseller, before mentioned, together with Kynaston; who was also a famous performer at this time, and who had been accustomed to represent the female characters, which Sir William now superseded the necessity of, by <num value="1">first</num> introducing actresses on &verbar; the English stage, who grew so expert (as a certain author informs us), not only in their own parts, but those of the actors, that before the end of Charles the <num value="2">Second</num>'s reign, some plays (and particularly the &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Parson's Wedding</hi>&rdquo;) were represented all by 
<hi rend=italics>women</hi>, as in his father's reign, and before, they were all by men.&rdquo; 
<P>Hamlet, which produced a considerable accession to the treasury of the Theatre, was succeeded by Sir William's play of &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Love and Honour.</hi>&rdquo; This drama was very richly clothed. The King gave Betterton (now becoming the great attraction of the town) his <hi rend=italics>coronation suit</hi>, in which he acted the part of Prince <hi rend=italics>Alvaro;</hi> the Duke of York, to Mr. <hi rend=italics>Harris</hi>, his, to perform Prince <hi rend=italics>Prospero</hi> in; and my Lord of Oxford, to Mr. Joseph Price, his, who played <hi rend=italics>Lionel</hi>, the Prince of Parma's son. Thus splendidly got up, this piece had a very great run. 
<P>Romeo and Juliet, The Twelfth Night, and King Henry VIII. by Shakespeare, were respectively produced afterwards, and attended with proportionable success. The other new pieces got up at this Theatre during the following seasons, were, &ldquo;The Adventures of <num value="5">Five</num> Hours,&rdquo; which ran <num value="13">thirteen</num> days; the &ldquo;Rivals,&rdquo; by D&lsquo;Avenant, which ran <num value="9">nine</num> days; Cowley's &ldquo;Cutter of Coleman Street;&rdquo; Webster's &ldquo;Duchess of Malfey;&rdquo; &ldquo;Mustapha,&rdquo; by the Earl of Orrery, which was expensively produced, and eagerly followed; and the then great favourite &ldquo;Love in a Tub,&rdquo; by Sir George Etherege. This latter piece, Downes informs us, got the company more reputation and profit than any preceding comedy, the receipts of the house amounting to upwards of <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> within the month. This sum, considering the smallness of the Theatre, the low prices of admittance, and the then value in money, it must be confessed was very great. 
<P>These were the principal, or stock plays, performed here from the opening until <datestruct VALUE="1665-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>, when the <hi rend=italics>plague</hi>
beginning to rage, the company ceased acting, and the Theatre continued closed until the Christmas after the great fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>. From this period the company recommenced acting, with the play of Mustapha, which was performed by <hi rend=italics>command</hi>, at Court. After this they continued to perform at their Theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields,<NOTE N="*"><P>&ldquo;On the back side of Portugal Row, is a street which runneth to Lincoln's Inn Gate, which used to pass without a name, but since the place is increased by the new buildings in Little Lincoln's Inn Fields, and the settling of the Playhouse, it may have a name given it, and not improperly, <hi rend=italics>Playhouse Street.</hi> Fronting the Playhouse, is a street which goeth to <hi rend=italics>Plough Stables</hi>, which also had no name, unless <num value="1">one</num> may call it Grange Street, from the Grange Inn, a place of good note; nigh to which is the parish round-house, on the back side of which is a churchyard, also belonging to the parish.&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Strype's Stow</hi>, vol. ii. p. <num value="819">819</num>, <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> with various success, until the smallness of the house, and other inconveniences attached to it, rendered a removal necessary, and the new Theatre in Dorset Gardens was begun to be built. 
<P>The desertion of the Lincoln's Inn Field's Theatre took place towards the close of the year <datestruct value="1671"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>, from which period its history, as a playhouse, ceased; and, though D&lsquo;Avenant's building does not appear to have been occupied for theatrical representations, yet on the same site a new Theatre was erected by Mr. Christopher Rich, who, on his expulsion from Drury Lane, employed the short remainder of his life, in consulting with Mr. Sheppard, who had previously built the playhouse in Goodman's Fields, about finishing Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre, of which he had sometime obtained a lease at a low rent; and having a presentiment of his removal from Drury Lane Theatre, he had, under the direction of the said Sheppard, begun to build, though slowly, in the year <datestruct value="1709"><year reg="1709">1709</year></datestruct>-<num value="10">10</num>, as it now standeth; for which operation he had an abundant leisure. 
<P>But, alas! whatsoever plans the sage manager might have had in his head, it is plain they all fell, like himself, to the ground. The Weekly Packet of <datestruct VALUE="1714-11-6"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=6>6</day>, <year reg=1714>1714</year></datestruct>, states that &ldquo;Christopher Rich, Esq., the patentee of the playhouse, and a great encourager of poetical performances, died <num value="2">two</num> days since, without seeing his new <hi rend=italics>Theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields</hi> perfected; which is left to the care of Mr. John Rich, his eldest son.&rdquo; The same paper adds, <datestruct VALUE="1714-11-13"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=13>13</day>, <year reg=1714>1714</year></datestruct>, that &ldquo;Mr. Rich, driven from the Theatre by his rebellious subjects, was buried at <hi rend=italics>St. Andrew's</hi>, Holborn, from his house adjoining the King's Theatre, accompanied (attended) by several of those who have resisted his authority when living.&rdquo; And in the same publication, <datestruct VALUE="-12-18"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=18>18</day></datestruct>, same year, is the following paragraph: &ldquo;This day the new playhouse in Lincoln's Inn Fields is to be opened, and a comedy acted, called the Recruiting Officer, though it is said that some of the gentlemen who have left the service of Drury, are ordered to return to their colours, upon pain of not exercising their lungs elsewhere.&rdquo; 
<P>It seems that, although this company flourished at <num value="1">first</num>, in a few years it experienced difficulties. The London Journal, in <datestruct VALUE="1720-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, states, that the house was seized in execution for debt, and the company dissolved.

<P>IT appears, from a reference to the patent for the erection of this theatre, which is dated as early as the year <datestruct value="1663"><year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct>, and which recites, by way of <hi rend=italics>Inspeximus</hi>, <num value="2">two</num> preceding patents (the <num value="1">one</num> dated <datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct>, and the other dated <datestruct value="1662--"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>, the latter being an exemplification of the former, and which Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant, the grantee, had surrendered into the Court of Chancery for the purpose of obtaining the firstmen- tioned patent of <datestruct value="1663--"><year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct>), that the design of building a theatre on this spot had been long in contemplation. It begins with reciting, that 
<P>&ldquo;Whereas King Charles I. of glorious memory, by his letters patent, under the great seal of England, bearing date at Westminster, the <datestruct VALUE="-03-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct> in the <num value="14">14th</num> year of his reign&rdquo; (<datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct>), &ldquo;did give and grant unto Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant, by the name of William D&lsquo;Avenant, <hi rend=italics>Gentleman</hi>, his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, his full power, license, and authority, that he, they, and every of them, by him and themselves, and by all and every such person and persons, as he or they should depute and appoint, and his and their labourers, servants, and workmen, should and might lawfully, quietly, and peaceably frame, erect, new build, and set up, <hi rend=italics>upon a parcel of ground lying near unto, or behind the <num value="3">Three</num> Kings Ordinary, in Fleet Street</hi>,<NOTE N="*"><P>The site of this tavern or ordinary was, until of late, distinguished by a <hi rend=italics>bas relief of <num value="3">three</num> kings</hi>, fixed in the front of a house near the entrance to Salisbury Square. It is probable, also, that it gave rise to the sign of the <num value="3">Three</num> Kings public house in Fleet Street, nearly opposite.</NOTE> in the parishes of St. Dunstan's in the West, London, or in St. Bride's, London, or in either of them; or in any other ground, in or about that place, or in the whole street aforesaid, then allotted to him for that use; or in any other place that was, or thereafter should be assigned or allotted out to the said Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant, by Thomas Earl of Arundel and Surrey, then Earl Marshal of England, or any other commissioner, for building, for the time being in that behalf, A THEATRE, OR PLAYHOUSE, with necessary <hi rend=italics>tiring</hi> and retiring rooms, and other places convenient, <hi rend=italics>containing in the whole</hi> <num value="40">40</num> <hi rend=italics>yards square at the most:</hi> wherein plays, and musical entertainments, scenes, or other the like presentments might be presented. And that the said King did grant unto the said Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant, his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, that it should and might be lawful to and for him the said Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant, his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, from time to time, to gather together, entertain, govern, privilege, and keep such and so many players and persons to exercise actions, musical presentments, scenes, dancing, and the like, as he the said Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant, his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, from time to time, to act plays in such houses, so to be by him or them erected, and exercise, music, musical presentments, scenes, dancing, or other the like, as the same or other houses, or times, or after plays are ended, peaceably and quietly, <hi rend=italics>without the impeachment or impediment of any person or persons whatsoever</hi>, for the honest recreation of such as should desire to see the same. And that it should and might be lawful to and for the said Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant, his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, to take and receive of such as should resort to hear and see any such plays, scenes, and entertainments whatsoever, such sum or sums of money as was, or then after, from time to time, should be accustomed to be given or taken in other playhouses and places, for the like plays, scenes, presentments, and entertainments as in and by the said letters patent, relation being thereunto had, at large might appear.&rdquo; <pb id="p.148" n="148"> 
<P>The instrument proceeds to state the exemplification of such letters patent under the great seal of England (ann. <num value="13">13</num> Car. II.), which was the patent granted at the same time with Killigrew's, and under which the Lincoln's Inn Fields theatre had been opened, and the delivery of such exemplification, and the before-recited letters patent of Charles I. into the Court of Chancery to be cancelled; and continues to recite, that in consequence of such surrender, &amp;c. and upon the humble petition of the said Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant, and in consideration of the good and faithful services he had rendered and might render, there should be given and granted by that then present patent &ldquo;full power, license, and authority, for him to frame,&rdquo; &amp;c, as before, &ldquo;in any place within the cities of London and Westminster, or the suburbs thereof, where he, or those he should employ, might best find accommodation for that purpose, to be assigned and alloted out by the surveyor of the works (Sir Christopher Wren), <num value="1">ONE</num> THEATRE, OR PLAYHOUSE, with tiring and retiring rooms, and other places convenient, <hi rend=italics>of such extent and dimensions as the said Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant, &amp;c. should think fitting;</hi> wherein tragedies, comedies, plays, operas, music, scenes, and all other entertainments of the stage, whatsoever, might be presented.&rdquo; 
<P>We thus see that the original patent, authorizing Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant to build a theatre on this spot, had been granted long before the commencement of the civil wars, but for reasons with which we are now unacquainted, it had never been carried into execution. For its non-erection afterwards, the troubles which succeeded afford a sufficient excuse. Sir William's predilection for this situation to erect his playhouse in, probably arose from its having been before appropriated to a similar purpose; it having been the site of a small theatre, the company of which styled themselves &ldquo;The Prince's Servants,&rdquo; and their representations were by candle-light, which was then considered a novelty. On the Restoration, and Sir William gaining a renewal of the patent, he chose (probably from its vicinity to the <hi rend=italics>Cockpit</hi> in Drury Lane, where he had been ever since his removal from Rutland House, in <datestruct value="1648--"><year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct>, permitted to represent operas) Lincoln's Inn Fields, for the site of his new theatre. There is every reason to think, however, that he soon perceived his mistake, and again resumed his original intention, as the <num value="2">second</num> grant for building a theatre in Dorset Gardens is dated only <num value="1">one</num> year from the founding of the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre, <datestruct value="1663--"><year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct>; yet, notwithstanding the bo ve grant, no preparations were made for building the new theatre in Dorset Gardens during the life of Sir William (probably from want of funds); and he continued at the head of his Lincoln's Inn Fields concern until his death, which took place on <datestruct VALUE="1668-04-17"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=17>17</day>, <year reg=1668>1668</year></datestruct>. 
<P>On Sir William's demise, his theatre and property descended to his widow, the Lady D&lsquo;Avenant (her son, Mr. Charles D&lsquo;Avenant acting for her); over which, and the concerns of the company, Betterton and Harris were constituted stage managers; when the incommodiousness of their small theatre rendering the necessity of a new <num value="1">one</num> imperious, the Dorset Gardens plan was renewed, and Sir Christopher Wren employed to erect a larger and more elegant theatre on that site. 
<P>During the progress of this new house, which was intended to outrival that of Drury Lane, by the orders of his Soverign, King Charles II. (who took great interest in the business), Betterton went over to France, to view the scenery and machinery in use in the theatres there; and, on his return, so much improved the stage, by new and expensive decorations, that the proprietors were obliged to raise the prices of admittance: Boxes from <num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> to <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>; Pit from <num value="1">1</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>
to <num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>; <num value="1">First</num> Gallery from <num value="1">1</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> to <num value="1">1</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>; and Upper Gallery from <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> to <num value="1">1</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>; which had been the stated prices at the former theatre.<NOTE N="*"><P>Wilkes's View of the Stage.</NOTE>
<pb id="p.149" n="149"> 
<P>The new theatre being now finished, the company removed from Lincoln's Inn Fields thither, on the <datestruct VALUE="1671-11-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month> <year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>, when they opened with the comedy of &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Sir Martin Mar-All</hi>,&rdquo; which was represented <num value="3">three</num> successive nights with much applause. Of the other pieces brought forward at this theatre, during an interval of <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="9">nine</num> years, during which it continued open, it would be needless in this place to speak. In the great rivalry between it and Drury Lane, each had alternately the start of the other; but the situation was finally found so inferior, in spite of all exertions, that in the year <datestruct value="1682"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct> the <num value="2">two</num> patentees <hi rend=italics>united patents;</hi> and the &ldquo;Duke's Company,&rdquo; being incorporated with and made a part of the &ldquo;King's Company,&rdquo; immediately deserted the Dorset Gardens Theatre, and removed to Drury Lane. 
<P>Some time after, a difference happening between the united patentees and the chief actors, as Mr. Betterton, Mrs. Barry, and Mrs. Bracegirdle, the latter complaining of oppression from the former; they for redress appealed to Lord Dorset, then Lord Chamberlain, for justice: who espousing the cause of the actors, with the assistance of Sir Robert Howard, finding their complaints just, procured from King William a separate license for Mr. Congreve, Mr. Betterton, Mrs. Barry, Mrs. Bracegirdle, and others, to set up a new company, calling it, &ldquo;The New Theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields;&rdquo; and the house being fitted up from a <hi rend=italics>tennis-court</hi>, they opened it the last day of <datestruct VALUE="1695-04--"><month reg="04">April</month> <year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>, with a new comedy, called, &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Love for Love.</hi>&rdquo;<NOTE N="*"><P>This is the present remaining theatre in Portugal Street, which has been generally mistaken for, and confounded with, the &ldquo;Duke's Theatre,&rdquo; in Bear Yard, or Little Lincoln's Inn Fields.</NOTE>

<P>After this separation of Mr. Betterton's company from Mr. Rich, in <datestruct value="1695--"><year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>, they performed with various success, till, about the end of <datestruct value="1704--"><year reg="1704">1704</year></datestruct>, Betterton assigned his license, and his whole company, over to Captain Vantbrugg, to act under his at the theatre in the Haymarket, which was opened on the <datestruct VALUE="1705-04-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1705">1705</year></datestruct>. Here they acted with indifferent success until <datestruct VALUE="1706-10-15"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=15>15</day>, <year reg=1706>1706</year></datestruct>, when Captain Vantbrugg with the concurrence of the Lord Chamberlain, transferred his license and government of the theatre to Mr. Swinney, who brought with him from Rich,&mdash;Wilks, Cibber, Mills, Mrs. Oldfield, &amp;c. and united them to the old company; Mr. Betterton and Mr. Underhill being the only remains of the Duke of York's Servants from <datestruct value="1662--"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct> till this their union in <datestruct value="1706--"><year reg="1706">1706</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Dorset Gardens, for several years after its desertion, became the receptacle of various adventurers; and conjurors, prize fighters, and other exhibitors (whose bills and puffs may be seen in the advertisements of the day), here showed off their wonderful powers. It was standing, and apparently perfect, in the year <datestruct value="1720"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, as we learn from a small elevation of it, in the plan of St. Bride's parish, inserted in Strype's Stowe of that date. 
<P>The annexed view sufficiently explains the appearance of this very elegant theatre. It is copied from a unique drawing preserved in the Pepysian Library at Cambridge. 
<P>We shall conclude this article by inserting the remainder of the patent granted to Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant, which contains various regulations, &amp;c. for the government of his new theatre, and which modern events, and their being still in force, have rendered peculiarly interesting: 
<P>&ldquo;And we do hereby, for us, our heirs and successors, grant unto the said Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant, &amp;c. full power, license, and authority, from time to time, to gather together entertain, govern, privilege, and keep, such and so many players and persons to exercise and act comedies, tragedies, &amp;c. within the house to be built as aforesaid, or within <hi rend=italics>the house in</hi>

And such persons to permit and continue at and during the pleasure of the said Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant, &amp;c. from time to time, to act plays and entertainments of the stage of all sorts, peaceably and quietly, without the impeachment or impediment of any person or persons whatsoever, for the honest recreation of such as shall desire the same: and that it shall and may be lawful to and for the said Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant, his heirs and assigns, to take and receive of such of our subjects as shall resort to see or hear any such plays, scenes, and entertainments whatsoever, such sum or sums of money as either have accustomably been given and taken in the like kind, as shall be thought reasonable by him or them, in regard of the great expense of scenes, music and such new decorations as have not been formerly used. 
<P>&ldquo;And further for us, our heirs and successors, we do hereby give and grant unto the said Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant, his heirs and assigns, full power to make such allowance, out of that which he shall so receive by the acting of plays and entertainments of the stage as aforesaid, to the actors, and other persons employed in acting, representing, or in any quality whatsoever, about the said theatre, <hi rend=italics>as he or they shall think fit. And that the said company shall be under the sole government and authority of the said Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant, his heirs and assigns; and all scandalous and mutinous persons shall, from time to time, by him and them be ejected and disabled from playing in the said theatre.</hi> And for that we are informed that divers companies of players have taken upon them to act plays publicly in our said cities of London and Westminster, or the suburbs thereof, without any authority for that purpose, we do hereby declare our dislike of the same, and will and grant that only the said company, erected and set up, or to be erected and set up, by the said Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant, his heirs and assigns, by virtue of these presents, and <num value="1">one</num> other company erected and set up, or to be erected and set up, by Thomas Killigrew, Esquire, his heirs and assigns, and none others, shall from henceforth act or represent comedies, tragedies, plays, or entertainments of the stage, within our said cities of London and Westminster, or the suburbs thereof: which said company to be erected by the said Thomas Killigrew, his heirs or assigns, shall be subject to his and their government and authority, and shall be styled the company of US and OUR ROYAL CONSORT. And the better to preserve amity and correspondence, and that the <num value="1">one</num> may not encroach upon the other by any indirect means, <hi rend=italics>we will</hi> and ordain, that no actor, or other person employed about either of the said theatres, <hi rend=italics>ejected</hi> by the said Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant and Thomas Killigrew, or either of them, or <hi rend=italics>deserting</hi> his company, shall be received by the governor, or any of the said other company, or any other person or persons, to be employed in acting, or in any manner relating to the stage, without the consent and approbation of the governor of the said company, whereof the said person so ejected or deserted was a member, signified under his <hi rend=italics>hand and seal.</hi> And we do by these presents declare all other company and companies, saving the <num value="2">two</num> companies before mentioned, to be silenced and suppressed.

And we do likewise, permit and give leave, <hi rend=italics>that all the women's parts to be acted in either of the said <num value="2">two</num> companies for the time to come, may be performed by women</hi>, as long as these recreations, which, by reason of the abuses aforesaid, were scandalous and offensive, may, by such reformation, be esteemed not only harmless delight, but useful and instructive representations of human life, to such of our good subjects as shall resort to the same.&rdquo;

<P>The Cockpit in Drury Lane was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="6">six</num> playhouses allowed in London, in the reign of King Charles I. for the acting of stage plays, which continued to be performed until the breaking out of the civil wars; when the flight of the King from the metropolis left the prevailing party and parliament in full power both with respect to church and state; who conceiving dramatic amusements as serving no other ends than corrupting the morals of the people, suppressed every diversion of that kind, with the exception of the Red Bull Theatre in St. John Street, where feats of activity and drolls were only permitted to be performed. On the restoration of Charles II. theatrical amusements were revived, and the scattered remains of the <num value="6">six</num> companies formed themselves into <num value="2">two</num>, and performed under the title of the King's and Duke's Servants. The former, under Killigrew (who had obtained a patent from the King), built them a new Theatre in Drury Lane, on the site of the Cockpit,<NOTE N="*"><P>The Cockpit had been pulled down and rebuilt, as it appears, that, <datestruct VALUE="1617-03-4"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=4>4</day>, <year reg=1617>1617</year></datestruct>, &ldquo;the Playhouse lately erected in Drury Lane was pulled down by the mob, and all the apparel torn in pieces.&rdquo; <hi rend=italics>Downes's Roscius Anglicanus, p.</hi> <num value="1">1</num>, <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>.

<P>The introduction of females on the stage <num value="1">first</num> took place at this period, and the Drury Lane Company being strengthened with Mrs. Eleanor Gwynn, a known favourite and mistress of the King, could not fail of being attractive and drawing great profit and company to the Theatre, which from this time was called, and has ever since been styled, &ldquo;Theatre Royal.&rdquo; In <datestruct VALUE="1672-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>, Drury Lane Theatre was burnt, with from <num value="50">fifty</num> to <num value="60">sixty</num> houses in the neighbourhood; and in <datestruct value="1674--"><year reg="1674">1674</year></datestruct> a new Theatre, built by Sir Christopher Wren, opened <datestruct VALUE="-03-26"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=26>26th</day></datestruct> with a Prologue and Epilogue by Dryden; and in the same year all stage-plays were suppressed. In <datestruct value="1682--"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct> the Duke's Servants formed an union with the King's Company, and removed from the Theatre in Dorset Garden to that of Drury Lane; and became incorporated his Majesty's Servants. Colley Cibber, in noticing this transaction, says, &ldquo;<num value="1">One</num> only Theatre being now in possession of the whole town, the united patentees imposed their terms upon the actors; for the profits of acting were then divided into <num value="20">twenty</num> shares, <num value="10">ten</num> of which went to the proprietors, and the other moiety to the principal actors, in such subdivisions as their different merit might pretend to. This occasioned great contentions from time to time between the patentees and performers, which arose to such an height, that Mr. Betterton, in <datestruct value="1693--"><year reg="1693">1693</year></datestruct>, having consulted a few of the principal persons in the Theatre, and interested several of the nobility to aid them in a scheme to obtain an independent licence to perform on their own account, they shortly after had the honour of an audience of the King, who graciously dismissed Mr. Betterton and his adherents, with an assurance of relief and support; and accordingly a select number of them were empowered by his royal licence to perform for themselves at the Tennis Court Theatre, Bear Yard, Little Lincoln's Inn Fields; where they performed Congreve's Love for Love with extraordinary success, and for a time carried on the concern with great spirit. This secession of the actors arose from the parsimonious conduct of Mr. Christopher Rich, who had purchased the patent of Charles D&lsquo;Avenant. In <datestruct value="1703--"><year reg="1703">1703</year></datestruct> the <num value="2">two</num> Theatres united, on which occasion Farquhar wrote a Prologue, under Rich's direction. Soon after this, Sir Thomas Skipwith, who had a share in the patent, and disgusted with the conduct of the property, in a fit of generosity gave his share to a Colonel Brett, who by great prudence so much improved it, that Sir Thomas applied to the Court of Chancery for restitution; obtained it, and soon after lost it at a gaming table. In <datestruct value="1709--"><year reg="1709">1709</year></datestruct>, by order of the Lord Chamberlain, the house was closed; and the same year <num value="1">one</num> Collier obtained permission to re-open the Theatre; to effect which, on the <num value="22">22</num>d of November, he forcibly excluded Rich from the premises, where he continued acting till Cibber, Doggett, and Wilks' management commenced. On the <datestruct VALUE="1712-01-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1712">1712</year></datestruct>, Sir Richard Steele had his name inserted in the patent for his life, and <num value="3">three</num> years after: this was granted to him because both the existing patents were in <num value="1">one</num> person's hands. In <datestruct value="1713--"><year reg="1713">1713</year></datestruct> Mr. Booth came into the management, in opposition to Doggett, who retired. Sir Richard Steele dying in <datestruct value="1729--"><year reg="1729">1729</year></datestruct>, Booth, Wilks, and Cibber severally sold out, and Mr. Highmore commenced manager; when the performers, led on by Theophilus Cibber, revolted, and acted for themselves at the little Theatre in the Haymarket; which so much perplexed Highmore, as to involve him in the greatest difficulties, and finally being ruined, the patent and management came into the hands of Fleetwood in <datestruct value="1736--"><year reg="1736">1736</year></datestruct>, who carried on the concern with various success <num value="10">ten</num> years. On the <datestruct VALUE="1737-03-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct>, the servants, who had been deprived of the former privilege of the use of the gallery gratis, forced their way in; the ringleaders were secured and sent to Newgate, and on the <num value="23">23</num>d of April following <num value="5">five</num> were tried at Hicks's Hall, and sentenced to hard labour: they had made an unsuccessful attempt the February previous. In the year <datestruct value="1743"><year reg="1743">1743</year></datestruct>, <datestruct VALUE="-11-8"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=8>8</day></datestruct>, a riot took place in the Theatre, while the King (George II.) was present: from which time the guards have regularly attended.

<P>Friday, <datestruct VALUE="1809-02-24"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=24>24</day>, <year reg=1809>1809</year></datestruct>, about <num value="5">five</num> minutes past <num value="11">eleven</num> at night, the flames burst out at the lobby windows of the front in Brydges Street, while volumes of smoke were seen issuing from every part of the Theatre. In less than a quarter of an hour it spread into <num value="1">one</num> unbroken flame over the whole of the immense pile, extending from Brydges Street to Drury Lane; so that the pillar of fire was not less than <num value="450">450</num> feet in breadth. It is impossible for the mind to conceive anything more magnificent than the spectacle, if the idea of the horror and ruin which it brought on the sufferers, could have been separated from the sublimity of the object. In about <num value="30">thirty</num> minutes after its commencement, the Apollo on the top fell into the pit, and soon after the whole of the roof fell. The reservoir for water on the top was at this time unfortunately empty (which our readers will recollect formed, with the iron curtain, the topic of reliance for security in the Prologue<NOTE N="*"><P>This Prologue was repeatedly spoken by the present Countess of Derby.</NOTE> with which the new theatre was opened). Any attempt to go near the flames was totally impracticable; and all that was saved from ruin was done by the presence of mind and activity of Mr. Kent, a literary gentleman, who was the <num value="1">first</num> to discover the flames; he hurried to the door, and gave the alarm. Mr. Powell the prompter, and Mr. Johnston the mechanist, with <num value="2">two</num> watchmen and Mr. Kent, were the only persons present; for, being a Friday in Lent, there had been no play nor rehearsal. They ascertained that the fire broke out in the hall under the lobby at the Brydges Street entry, which had been shut up that season, and where some plumbers had been at work. It was, when Mr. Kent broke in, confined to that spot: but in <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> minutes it ran up the front boxes, and spread like kindled flax. This may be accounted for from the body of air which so large a hollow afforded, and also the circumstance of the whole being a wooden case. For our readers will recollect, that the immense pile was constructed of timber, and that the frame stood for many months, exhibiting a very fine carcase of carpenter's work before the ribs were filled--in with bricks. Timber was then under <num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> per load; and the architect thought that this wooden work would contribute to the propagation of sound: it did not perhaps perfectly succeed in this respect, but it certainly contributed to the conflagration. Finding it impossible to prevent the destruction of the building, the gentleman saved the books from the room called the Treasury, and they were carried safely to Mr. Kent's house in Tavistock Street. The only other article saved was a bureau in Mrs. Jordan's room: Mr. Kent broke the panels of the door, and brought out the bureau. All further endeavours were rendered impossible by the excess of the heat. About a quarter before <num value="12">twelve</num>, a body of horse-guards, and foot-guards, and volunteers, came to the place, and engines reached the spot from every quarter, but they could do nothing. Part of the wall next to Vinegar Yard fell down, and the house of Mrs. Mac-Beath the fruiterer caught fire. The night was uncommonly fine, and the body of flame spread such a mass of light over the metropolis, that every surrounding object glittered with the brightness of gold. Mr. Sheridan was in the House of Commons, assisting in the important discussion on Mr. Ponsonby's motion.<NOTE N="*"><P>Mr. Ponsonby's motion was THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR IN SPAIN, and was lost by a majority of <num value="93">93</num>&mdash;there being for the motion <num value="127">127</num>, and for ministers <num value="220">220</num>, votes.</NOTE> The House was illuminated by the blaze of light, and the interest universally taken in the circumstance interrupted the debate. A motion was made to adjourn; but Mr. Sheridan said, with great calmness, &ldquo;that whatever might be the extent of the private calamity, he hoped it would not interfere with the public business of the country.&rdquo; He then left the House, and the discussion proceeded. Many of his friends accompanied him to the scene, but it was too late for any effort to be made; and all the engines could effect was, to save the houses in Vinegar Yard and Russell Street (the roofs of which had caught fire) from being burnt down. About half-past <num value="1">one</num>, parts of the out-walls, both in Russell Street and <pb id="p.153" n="153"> Vinegar Yard, fell down and completely blocked up the passage; but fortunately no lives were lost. The houses in Little Russell Street, facing the Theatre, were dreadfully seared and whitened. Some of them had been on fire in the window-frames, and all the windows were broken by the heat. In Vinegar Yard, <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> small houses, close to the box-door, were burnt and gutted with the fire. Had not the wall in Little Russell Street fallen inwards on the Theatre, it must have crushed the opposite houses. The fire burnt fully up to Drury Lane, to which a part of the building, made into a scene-painting room, we believe, had been lately carried. 
<P>The ruins of Drury Lane Theatre remained long a nuisance to the neighbourhood, and probably would have so continued unnoticed by the proprietors, for want of means to rebuild the Theatre, had not a set of gentlemen formed a plan, and framed a Bill, which was brought into parliament to obtain a patent for a <num value="3">third</num> Theatre, awakened the energies and genius of Mr. Sheridan, who, without loss of a moment's time, formed a Committee, of which Mr. Whitbread was chairman, to investigate the whole concern, and contrive a way to restore the building. This had the desired effect; Mr. Mellish's Bill was thrown out of parliament, and the affairs of Drury Lane went prosperously on. 
<P>&ldquo;The Committee for rebuilding Drury Lane Theatre having completed their arrangement on the <datestruct VALUE="1811-10-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, Mr. Whitbread, their chairman, waited upon the Prince Regent, at Carleton House, on the <num value="18">18th</num>, and laid their final resolutions and plan before his Royal Highness, which were honoured with his warmest approbation. The sum required, and subscribed, was <num value="400000">400,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>, out of which, <num value="40000">40,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> was made applicable to the purchase of the old patent interest, viz., <num value="20000">20,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> to Mr. Sheridan, who resigns all interest whatever in the property; and the other <num value="20000">20,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> in equal portions between Mrs. Linley, Mrs. Richardson, and Mr. T. Sheridan. The old renters, and other creditors, accept of <num value="25">twenty-five</num> per cent. in full of their respective demands; and the Duke of Bedford absolves the property of his claim, amounting to <num value="12000">12,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> The remainder of the money subscribed is deemed competent to the completion of the work. The Committee have decided in favour of the plan of Mr. Benjamin Wyatt, who is appointed architect; and have entered into a contract with Mr. Rowles, builder, who has displayed his ability in the erection of the New Mint and other public structures. He has engaged, under a bond of <num value="20000">20,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>, to perfect the Theatre on or before <datestruct VALUE="1812-10-1"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=1>1</day>, <year reg=1812>1812</year></datestruct>, at an estimate of <num value="112500">112,500</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> On the <num value="19">19th</num>, Mr. Whitbread, accompanied by some other gentlemen, delivered to the builder possession of the ground and materials; and a numerous body of workmen commenced their labours on the site. On the <num value="30">30th</num>, at a <num value="2">second</num> General Meeting, the Subscribers generally ratified their subscriptions, and <num value="120000">120,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> is already on the books of the Committee, with the promise of further sums. 
<P>&ldquo;<datestruct VALUE="-04-11"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=11>11</day></datestruct>, New Drury Theatre is in great forwardness; a meeting of the Subscribers was held this day at the Crown and Anchor, Lord Holland in the chair. The house is to be opened on the <datestruct VALUE="-10-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>; the cost of the whole will be <num value="150000">150,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> Thanks were voted to the noble Chairman and Mr. Whitbread; the latter elucidated particulars relative to the funds, building, scenery, &amp;c., and asserted that the undertaking held out prospects of emolument infinitely greater than those of any similar undertaking.&rdquo;&mdash;These prospects have not yet been realized. 
<P>&ldquo;September&mdash;the scaffolding before Drury Lane Theatre being removed, the public have now a full view of the principal front. The architecture is simple and elegant, and its uniformity must strike every beholder. The front in Brydges Street is the only part which is stuccoed at present, but it is intended that the whole shall be done as soon as the finances will allow. The house was lighted up on Thursday night to judge of the effect. The audience part of the house forms <num value="3">three</num>-fourths of a circle, which, making some little allowance for the deviation in the drop within the proscenium, may be said to be completed by the circular sweep which connects the outer wall of the boxes with the proscenium. The view of the stage is relieved by the appearance on either side of <num value="2">two</num> magnificent herculean columns, representing verde antique marble. Columns of a similar description ornament the grand saloon. The lustres by which the house is lighted, are made from designs formed by the architect. On the staircases at each pillar are placed antique lamps. <hi rend=italics>Melpomene</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Thalia</hi> are placed in the niches on either side of the proscenium, above the cornice, and the royal arms are painted on the semicircular panel formed by the arch, which appears to surmount the <num value="2">two</num> pillars over the proscenium. The uniform shape of the back wall of the boxes gives an unobstructed range to the sound, at the same time that its thickness (<num value="3">three</num> feet) is an effectual security against the spreading of flames. In the corridors which surround and lead to the boxes, the floors are formed of stone, and rest upon brick arches, without any intermixture of timber. Another wall <num value="3">three</num> feet thick surrounds these corridors. By an invention of Colonel Congreve, water is laid on to all parts of the building, and the reservoir will contain <num value="200">200</num> hogsheads, which will supply the pipes for half an hour; and the Directors of the York Buildings' Water-works are engaged, by means of steam-engines, to replenish the reservoir. The scenes will move on an iron railway. The whole building will be completed for <num value="112000">112,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> The expense, including lamps, lustres, stoves, grates, furniture of the most tasteful and costly description, and architect's commission, will not exceed <num value="125000">125,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>; and the whole amount of expenditure, including scenery, wardrobe, and all the other property necessary to be provided for opening the Theatre for theatrical performances, will not exceed <num value="150000">150,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>&rdquo; 
<div2 type="chapter" n="44" id="c.44"><HEAD>Opening of <placename>Drury Lane New Theatre</placename>.</HEAD>

<P>This Theatre opened on Saturday the <datestruct VALUE="-10-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, with Hamlet, to an immense audience. The public expectation had been so much excited, that the doors were crowded at an early hour, and the difficulty of entrance was excessive. When, at length, the crowd had slowly laboured their way into the hall, they found other difficulties, and the passages to the doors for receiving money were scenes of nearly as much struggle and danger as the street. This <pb id="p.154" n="154"> hall is a large unornamented oblong entrance, lighted by a handsome circular lamp, with a range of narrow iron railing inclosing the pay-doors. The next progress is into a circular apartment, surrounded by columns, and covered by a dome. In the centre is a cast from the beautiful statue of Shakespeare, by Roubillac, in the garden of Mrs. Garrick, at Hampton, left, after her decease, to the British Museum. 
<P>On the landing-place of each of the grand staircases, a line of railing, bronzed and gilt, is drawn across for the ticket receivers; and these once passed, the audience are let loose among the galleries of this striking edifice. The general avenue to the upper part, in the interior, is a showy circular passage, running round the Shakespeare Hall, at about a <num value="3">third</num> of its height, lighted with antique lamps of bronze, and branching off to the saloon and the boxes. The saloon, on the construction of which the architect probably occupied much of his means, is handsome, so far as size might assist its effect. Large ottomans are placed at intervals in <num value="2">two</num> lines down the middle, and the recesses in the sides lined with sofas. The colour of the furniture is throughout scarlet. <num value="2">Two</num> coffee-rooms close the extremities. Chandeliers and lamps, on antique models, are interspersed in great profusion. On the box-doors being opened, the Theatre blazes upon the eye; and it is scarcely possible for any eye to look upon it without being dazzled and delighted by its prodigal and luxuriant beauty. The back of the boxes sweeps, as it appeared to us, a segment of about <num value="2">two</num>-thirds of a circle; but the front deviates, with uncommon elegance, from a figure almost too precise and too unmanageable for the purposes of a theatre, and assumes the form of an irregular conchoid, or, to use a more familiar illustration, a horse-shoe considerably flattened in the middle. This form gives great advantages in seeing and hearing, from bringing forward the audience more equally to the front. We understand that the centre boxes are <num value="17">seventeen</num> feet nearer the stage than in the Covent Garden Theatre, and <num value="16">sixteen</num> feet nearer than in the former house. The front of the dress-boxes is simple and delicate; that of the <num value="1">first</num> circle, retiring by a slight bend, is covered by gilding and colours; the fronts of the upper rows are gorgeously decorated with green and gold; the back of the boxes is a strong red&mdash;the cushions a deep crimson. To the credit of the architect and the committee, the basket is wholly omitted. The pit contains only <num value="17">seventeen</num> rows of seats, but it seems capacious and well-arranged; the entrances are at the back. The orchestra occupies but a part of it, and the seats at either end reach down to the stage. The aspect of the stage is admirable: the place of the stage doors is filled up by <num value="2">two</num> immense groups of gryphons or sphinxes in bronze, supporting each a blazing tripod of hydrostatic lights, the invention of Mr. Barton.<NOTE N="*"><P>The tripods of hydrostatic lights have been removed since the <num value="1">first</num> season, and other trifling alterations taken place.</NOTE> The flame rises from a circle of <num value="36">thirty-six</num> small tubes above the edge of the urn, and from its brilliancy, wavering delicacy, and slight connection with its support, excited universal admiration. Over these, on a line with the <num value="1">first</num> and <num value="2">second</num> circles, are the managers' boxes, small and singularly tasteful; above these is a magnificent cornice&mdash;and the whole is surmounted by the statue of a muse. This is all finely picturesque. From the overpowering brightness of the stage and the tripods, the eye rises to the graceful ornament of those recesses that look, with their gold and imaged work, like pavilions in an eastern garden, and from them gradually fixes on the pale marble form of a muse, surrounded with the severer lines of the architecture, slightly shaded from the burning brightness of the stage, and standing in all the grace of chaste, lonely, Greek simplicity. <num value="2">Two</num> large green columns with gilded capitals limit the stage on either side; and the architect seems to have availed himself of them in a very able manner. From the comparative narrowness of the stage, it might have been feared that the figures of the performers would appear disproportionably large, at least to all that majority of the audience not perfectly on their level; but, by bringing forward those pillars, and still more by, if we may so express ourselves, extending their pedestal on both sides of the proscenium, an immediate contrast is formed, which reduces the stature of the performer to the due proportion. From this, which struck us as a very happy expedient, the stage appeared to have all the advantage, without the inconvenience of that size, which has given rise to so much complaint in the Covent Garden Theatre. On a comparison with this latter Theatre, defects occur to us in both; but the mutual character differs so widely, that a perfect contrast is beyond our powers. The <num value="1">one</num> produces its effect by rigid regularity; the other, by various elegance. In the <num value="1">one</num>, decoration obtrudes itself reluctlantly, and is submissive to the sterner spirit of the temple; in the other, the very wantonness of a luxuriant taste sports in all its fancies, and impresses all it touches with the spirit of an oriental palace. Shakespeare would have chosen Covent Garden for the stern passion of his <hi rend=italics>Othello</hi>, or the desperate and sublime cruelty of his <hi rend=italics>Lady Macbeth</hi>; but for the light elegance, and fairy beauty, and fantastic splendour of the <hi rend=italics>Tempest</hi>, or the <hi rend=italics>Midsummer Night's Dream</hi>, he would have turned unwillingly from Drury Lane. They are both able works, and do honour to the liberality and the skill by which they have been raised within so short a period; but a decision on their respective merits must depend on the peculiar habits of the decider. <pb id="p.155" n="155">

<P>Covent Garden Theatre owes its foundation and rise to Mr. John Rich, son and successor to Mr. Christopher Rich, late patentee of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, who having, through a parsimonious disposition, appropriated to himself a greater share of the profits in that Theatre than in reason and justice he was entitled to, raised such an host of enemies in the actors under him, that William Collier, Esq., a lawyer and Member of Parliament for Truro in Cornwall, of an enterprising disposition, taking advantage of these intestine feuds, obtained a lease and licence over the head of Rich, in Drury Lane Theatre, which he took possession of by force, though not before his opponent had carried away everything of the stage property worth removing. Some time before this, Rich had taken a lease of D&lsquo;Avenant's Theatre, and possessing his patent, began building a new Theatre on the site of the old <num value="1">one</num> in Portugal Street, but did not live to see it finished. His son, however, opened it in the year <datestruct value="1714"><year reg="1714">1714</year></datestruct>, and continued his company there until their final removal to Covent Garden, in <datestruct value="1733--"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>. Mr. Rich, finding his Theatre in Portugal Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, too small for his favourite performances in pantomime, had long contemplated building a Theatre on a larger scale; and, judging Covent Garden convenient for this purpose, plans were drawn by Mr. Sheppard, his director and architect, which, on being submitted to general inspection, met the approbation of the public, who subscribed considerable sums towards the undertaking, on being admitted renters or shareholders in the concern. Workmen were immediately employed to clear some old buildings (supposed part of the Convent left by Inigo Jones) for the foundation; and Mr. Sheppard completely finished the building in <num value="22">twenty-two</num> months, commencing in <datestruct VALUE="1731-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1731">1731</year></datestruct>, and left it ready for opening in <datestruct VALUE="1732-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1732">1732</year></datestruct>; though the company did not remove from Portugal Street till early in the ensuing year, <datestruct value="1733"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>. The novelties Mr. Rich produced this season were, Achilles, an opera, by Gay, brought out a few months after the author's death; and the Parricide, a tragedy, by Shirley. The manager gained considerable popularity from the circumstance of the patentees of Drury Lane Theatre refusing a benefit to <num value="2">two</num> persons, whom they had been under obligations to, and had given a promise by <num value="3">three</num> of their managers, but afterwards refused their concurrence; Mr. Rich, on the <num value="1">first</num> application from <num value="1">one</num> of the parties, immediately consented to give a benefit at his house, from no other motive than a knowledge of the difficulties the person laboured under in his circumstances, though otherwise entirely unknown to him. 
<P>The great attraction of Covent Garden Theatre consisted in the pantomimes, which the manager spared no cost or pains to draw the attention of the public to visit, though on <num value="1">one</num> occasion it proved a melancholy, instead of a pleasant entertainment, as we learn that on the night of <datestruct VALUE="1736-10-1"><month reg="10">Oct.</month> <day reg=1>1</day>, <year reg=1736>1736</year></datestruct>, in the entertainment of Dr. Faustus, at the Theatre Royal in Covent Garden, when the machine, wherein were Harlequin, the Miller's Wife, the Miller, and his Man, was got to the full extent of its flying, <num value="1">one</num> of the wires which held the hind part of the car broke <num value="1">first</num>, and then the other broke, and the machine and all the people in it fell down upon the stage; by which unhappy accident, the young woman who personated the Miller's wife had her thigh broke and her knee-pan shattered, the Harlequin had his head bruised and his wrist strained, the Miller broke his arm, and the Miller's Man had his skull so fractured, that he soon after died. The audience was thrown into the greatest surprise; and nothing was heard but shrieks and cries of the utmost agony and horror. 
<P>The year <datestruct value="1737"><year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct> was rendered memorable at Covent Garden Theatre<NOTE N="*"><P>At Covent Garden Theatre, <num value="1">one</num> John Somerford tumbled from the upper gallery into the pit, being <num value="10">ten</num> yards, without receiving any hurt. When the play was done, he told Mr. Rich that he had made himself free of the gallery, and hoped he should have the liberty of going into it when he pleased; to which Mr. Rich consented, with a provided always, that he did not come out of it in the same abrupt manner.</NOTE> by the success of the burlesque opera of the 
<hi rend=italics>Dragon of Wantley</hi>, written by Carey, and set by Lampe, &ldquo;after the Italian manner.&rdquo; This excellent piece had run <num value="22">twenty-two</num> nights, when it was stopped, with all other public amusements, by the death of Queen Caroline, <datestruct VALUE="-11-20"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=20>20th</day></datestruct>; but was resumed again on the opening of the Theatres in January following, and supported as many representations as the Beggar's Opera had done <num value="10">ten</num> years before; and if Gay's original intention in writing his musical drama was to ridicule the opera, the execution of his plan was not so happy as that of Carey, in which the mock heroic, tuneful monster, recitative, splendid habits, and style of music, all conspired to remind the audience of what they had seen and heard at the lyric Theatre, more effectually than the most vulgar street tunes could do, and much more innocently than the tricks and transactions of the most abandoned thieves and prostitutes. Lampe's music to this farcical drama was not only excellent <num value="80">eighty</num> years ago, but is still modern and in good taste. 
<P>Mrs. Cibber's name was announced in the play-bills to perform the part of Lady Constance in King John, at Covent Garden Theatre, in the year <datestruct value="1750"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>; but, being suddenly taken ill, Mrs. Woffington, who was ever ready to show her respect to the public, and her willingness to promote the interest of her employer, came forward to the front of the pit, ready dressed for the character of Constance, and offered, with the permission of the audience, to supply Mrs. Cibber's place for that night. The spectators, instead of meeting her address with approbation, seemed entirely lost in surprise. This unexpected reception so embarrassed her, that she was preparing to retire, when Ryan, who thought they only wanted a hint to rouse them from their insensibility, asked them bluntly if they would give Mrs. Woffington leave to act Lady Constance? The audience, as if at once awakened from a fit of lethargy, by repeated plaudits strove to make amends for their inattention to the most beautiful woman that ever adorned a theatre. 
<P>From the death of Mr. Rich, which happened in <datestruct VALUE="1762-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>, to the <datestruct VALUE="1767-09-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>, Covent Garden Theatre was under the direction of Mr. Beard, his son-in-law, by the appointment of the widow, and the rest of the parties concerned; Mr. Rich leaving, besides his widow, <num value="4">four</num> daughters, all then living and married, who were to have an equal dividend amongst them. Mr. Beard being bred to music, he very judiciously exerted his powers to distinguish that Theatre by musical performances, as his predecessor had done by pantomime. Mr. Garrick was in his zenith at Drury Lane Theatre, and drew the whole town, until the tide was turned through Mr. Beard's musical performances of Love in a Village, Artaxerxes,<NOTE N="*"><P>In <datestruct value="1763--"><year reg="1763">1763</year></datestruct> a very serious riot took place at this Theatre, in consequence of the managers refusing to admit half price to the opera of Artaxerxes; the audience became enraged at the parsimony of the proprietors. and, in revenge for their obstinacy, completely gutted the house. The public in the end triumphed, and half price has ever since been taken, with the exception of a <num value="1">first</num> season to an expensive and popular pantomime.</NOTE> the Maid of the Mill, &amp;c., aided by the best singers and instrumental performers, brought crowded houses for <num value="4">four</num> successive prosperous seasons, at the expiration of which, Mr. Beard, who had been long troubled with an incurable deafness, once more brought the patent forward, which was purchased for <measure value="60000l." type=currency><num value="60000">sixty thousand</num> pounds</measure>, paid down in <datestruct VALUE="1767-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>, by Messrs. Colman, Harris, Rutherford, and Powell: Mr. Colman undertaking the regulation of <pb id="p.156" n="156"> the stage department. This alliance, however, was of short duration, as, in <datestruct VALUE="1768-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1768">1768</year></datestruct>, Messrs. Harris and Rutherford made a forcible entry into the Theatre, expelled by violence the house-keeper appointed by the acting managers, nor would quit possession until compelled by virtue of a warrant under the hand and seal of the high sheriffs of London and Middlesex: this produced a paper war, which was carried to a considerable extent, but ended in an arrangement, that left the patent and Theatre in possession of Messrs. Harris and Powell; and, on the decease of the latter, Mr. Harris became sole patentee, under a certain obligation of paying a moiety of the profits to the daughters of Mr. Powell. 
<P>Mr. Harris had determined, in the year <datestruct value="1781"><year reg="1781">1781</year></datestruct>, to take down his Theatre, and alter the inside; and for this purpose employed Mr. Richardson as principal architect: but the project was not carried on so far; other alterations, less expensive, were deemed equally good. The roof was raised <num value="8">eight</num> feet over the stage, and to a proportionate height to the back of the <num value="2">second</num> gallery, which opened a full view of the stage, even to the spectators in the back seats. The <num value="1">first</num> gallery projected equal to the front of the boxes, and <num value="4">four</num> seats beyond the front of the <num value="2">second</num> gallery. By these means the Theatre had a light appearance, giving a full view of the stage. The seats in the galleries and pit were raised <num value="6">six</num> inches higher than before. 
<P>The boxes, which were constructed on a very advantageous plan, were considerably elevated, and built upon the stage as far as the space before occupied by the side stage doors. The boxes were separated by Corinthian pillars, white with gold flutings and ornaments, which also supported the upper boxes and <num value="1">first</num> gallery; in the front of each box was a curtain of crimson drapery, and the linings were of the same colour; at the back of the front boxes several others were erected on a new construction, being detached from the rest. The sounding-board over the stage represented a clear sky. The front of the lower green boxes was pannelled white, with cornices and festoons of flowers gilt. The entrances were also considerably improved. The house opened <datestruct VALUE="1782-09-23"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=23>23</day>, <year reg=1782>1782</year></datestruct>, with an occasional prelude by Mr. M&lsquo;Nally. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1785--"><year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct> Covent Garden Theatre received various improvements in painting, gilding, and the removal of some of the boxes, which rendered the house more commodious. 
<div3 type=section id="c.45.1"><HEAD>Destruction of Covent Garden Theatre by Fire.</HEAD>
 

 
<P><datestruct VALUE="1808-09-20"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=20>20</day>, <year reg=1808>1808</year></datestruct>. About <num value="4">four</num> o'clock in the morning this extensive building was discovered to be in flames; and so fierce and rapid was the fire, that no exertion could stop its course. Within less than <num value="3">three</num> hours after its commencement, the whole of the interior was destroyed; nearly all the scenery, wardrobe, musical and dramatic libraries, and properties of all kinds, were a heap of smoking ruins. A considerable number of engines promptly attended, but there was a total want of water for some time, the main pipe having been cut off with the intention of laying down a new <num value="1">one</num>, and above an hour elapsed before some of the engines could be supplied; they afterwards played with the utmost possible effect for upwards of an hour, when the roof of the Theatre fell in with a dreadful crash, and thus announced the destruction of the interior of the building. The fire raged with most violence at the upper end of Bow Street, on the western side of which, <num value="7">seven</num> houses were destroyed, including the public-house called the Strugglers. In Hart Street the flames communicated to the houses on the opposite side of the street from the Theatre, and <num value="4">four</num> of them caught fire at the same moment; but, by the great activity of people and firemen, they suffered little more damage than a severe scorching. 
<P>The most painful part of this unexpected event, however, remains to be described: at an early stage of the fire, a party of firemen broke open the great door under the Piazza, Covent Garden; and, having introduced an engine into the passage, they directed it towards the galleries, where the fire appeared to burn more fiercely, when, dreadful to relate, the burning roof of the passage fell in, and buried them, with several others, who had rushed in along with them, in the ruins. It was a considerable time before the rubbish, which now blocked up the door, could be cleared away; when it was effected, an awful spectacle presented itself&mdash;the mangled bodies of dead and dying appearing through the rubbish, or discovered in each advance to remove it. At <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock <num value="11">eleven</num> dead bodies had been removed into the churchyard of St. Paul's, Covent Garden; <num value="3">three</num> of them were firemen belonging to the Ph&oelig;nix fire-office: some were sent to the Middlesex Hospital, miserably mangled, with broken limbs and severe bruises. Several respectable young men having approached too near the flames, perished by the steam which arose from the burning ruins upon which the engines were playing. The number of persons whose lives were unfortunately sacrificed to their activity and assiduity in endeavouring to arrest the progress of the flames, amounted to <num value="20">twenty</num>. Many others (more perhaps in number) were severely and dangerously wounded. The insurances on the Theatre scarcely exceeded <measure value="50000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50000">50,000</num></measure>, and the savings from the Shakespeare premises amounted to <measure value="3500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3500">3500</num></measure> more, which, on the whole, was not more than <num value="1">one</num> <num value="4">fourth</num> part of the sum requisite to replace the loss. The actual loss, however, was immense: besides the usual stock of scenery, there was an additional quantity for a new melo-drama, which was shortly to be brought forward. Of the originals of the music of Handel, Arne, and many other eminent composers, there are no copies; and of many other pieces of music, only an outline had been given. Some excellent dramatic productions, the property of the Theatre, were lost for ever. 
<P>The Bedford and Piazza Coffee-houses escaped the flames, owing to a wall which had been erected by the proprietors of the Theatre from the back of the adjoining premises. Another accident happened on Wednesday, by the falling of a wall in Hart Street, which killed <num value="1">one</num> man, and bruised several others. They had been warned of their danger, but disregarded it. 
<P>The organ, left by Handel as a legacy to the Theatre, stated to be worth upwards of <num value="1000">one thousand</num> guineas, and which only played during the Oratorios, was consumed. The Beef-steak Club, which held its meetings at the top of the Theatre, lost their stock of wines, valued at <measure value="1500l." type=currency>&pound; <datestruct value="1500--"><year reg="1500">1500</year></datestruct></measure>. Mr. Ware, the leader of the band, lost a violin of <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure> value, which had been left behind him that night for the <num value="1">first</num> time in <num value="2">two</num> years; Mr. Munden his wardrobe, which cost him near <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure>; Miss Bolton her jewels; and the other performers property, in the aggregate, to a considerable amount. 
<P>A subscription was opened for the relief of the sufferers. The King's Theatre was, with much liberality, offered by Mr. Taylor to Mr. Harris; and the Covent Garden Company began performing in their new quarters, in the Haymarket, on the <num value="26">26th</num>. The performances were Douglas and Rosina. 
<P>Tuesday, <datestruct VALUE="-01-10"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=10>10</day></datestruct>, the workmen employed in clearing away the ruins of Covent Garden Theatre, at the Piazza door, where the Ph&oelig;nix engine, with the firemen, were so unfortunately destroyed, dug out, near the cistern, the body of a young man, not burnt, but crushed to death. It proved to be the son of Mr. Webb, of Tottenham Court Road, and had been missing ever since that dreadful morning; but his parents, until the discovery of the corpse, had flattered <pb id="p.157" n="157"> themselves with the delusive hope that he had been either trepanned into a regiment of the line, or been impressed into the navy. 
<P>Saturday, <datestruct VALUE="-12-31"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=31>31</day></datestruct>, the foundation-stone of the new Theatre in Covent Garden was laid by H. R. H. the Prince of Wales, as Grand Master of the Freemasons: the Duke of Sussex, Earl Moira, and other distinguished noblemen, with some hundreds of that order, attended in procession. Considerable importance and interest was given to the spectacle by the honour thus conferred upon it; and all necessary pre-arrangements having been admirably attended to by the proprietors and the architect, the whole ceremony passed with much <hi rend=italics>eclat.</hi> H. R. H. the Prince of Wales arrived at <num value="1">one</num> o'clock, and was received by Earl Moira, and other superior members of the order; a discharge of artillery and loud acclamations welcomed his approach, while all the bands uniting, struck up &ldquo;God save the King.&rdquo; His path, from the entrance to the marquee, was covered with green cloth. His Royal Highness having arrived at the marquee, Mr. Smirke, the architect, presented him with a plan of the building: His Royal Highness then advanced, and deposited in the basement-stone a brass box, containing <num value="2">two</num> medals, <num value="1">one</num> of bronze, on which was a portrait of His Royal Highness, and on the reverse, the following inscription:

<P>There were deposited also gold, silver, and copper British coins of the latest coinage. 
<P><num value="3">Three</num> masons then spread mortar over the lower stone; and Earl Moira, Deputy Grand Master, having presented the Prince with a silver trowel, His Royal Highness, as Grand Master, finished spreading it, and the stone was slowly let down; its descent was proclaimed by a discharge of artillery. The plumb, the level, and the square were then presented by the acting Grand Master, with which the Prince tried the position of the stone, after which he finished the laying of it by <num value="3">three</num> strokes with a mallet; he now poured over it the antient offerings of corn, wine, and oil, from <num value="3">three</num> silver vases. His Royal Highness then returned the plan into the hands of the architect, desiring him to complete the edifice comformably to it; and, addressing Messrs. Harris and Kemble, he expressed his wishes for the success and prosperity of the undertaking. 
<div2 type="chapter" n="46" id="c.46"><HEAD>The New Theatre Royal, Covent Garden.</HEAD>
 
<P>The structure itself is a correct model of Grecian architecture, adapted to the dramatic improvements and purposes of the present time. It was necessary, therefore, that the sculptural decorations should agree as much as possible with the idea, in character and execution. The order of architecture in this building is taken from that of the Temple of Minerva, at Athens; and the basso-relievos explain the purposes of the edifice, in the 
<div3 type=section id="c.46.2"><HEAD>Sculptures on each side the Grand Portico:</HEAD>

<P>Of which the piece representing the ANTIENT DRAMA&mdash;in the centre, <num value="3">three</num> Greek Poets are sitting: the <num value="2">two</num> looking towards the portico are Aristophanes, representing the Old Comedy, and (nearest to the spectator) Menander, representing the New Comedy; before them Thalia presents herself with her crook and comic mask, as the object of their imitation: she is followed by Polyhymnia playing on the greater lyre, Euterpe on the lesser lyre, Clio with the long pipes, and Terpsichore, the muse of action or pantomime. These are succeeded by <num value="3">three</num> nymphs, crowned with the leaves of the fir-pine, and in succinct tunics, representing the hours or seasons governing and attending the winged horse, Pegasus. 
<P>The <num value="3">third</num> sitting figure in the centre, looking from the portico, is Aeschylus, the father of tragedy: he holds a scroll open on his knee; his attention is fixed on Wisdom, or Minerva, seated opposite the poet; she is distinguished by her helmet and shield: between Aeschylus and Minerva, Bacchus stands leaning on a faun, because the Greeks represented tragedies in honour of Bacchus. Behind Minerva stands Melpomene, or Tragedy, holding a sword and mask; then follow <num value="2">two</num> Furies, with snakes and torches, pursuing Orestes, who stretches his hands to supplicate Apollo for protection &mdash;Apollo is represented in the quadriga, or <num value="4">four</num>-horsed chariot of the sun. The last described figures relate to part of Aeschylus's tragedy of The Choephor&aelig;. 
<P>The MODERN DRAMA.&mdash;In the centre (looking from the portico) Shakspeare is sitting: the comic and tragic masks, with the lyre, are about his feet: his right hand is raised, expressive of calling up the following characters in the Tempest: <num value="1">first</num>, Caliban, laden with wood; next Ferdinand, sheathing his sword; then Miranda, entreating Prospero in behalf of her lover: they are led on by Ariel above, playing on a lyre. This part of the composition is terminated by Hecate (the <num value="3">three</num>-formed goddess) in her car, drawn by oxen, descending. She is attended by Lady Macbeth, with the daggers in her hand, followed by Macbeth, turning in horror from the body of Duncan behind him. 
<P>In the centre (looking towards the portico) is Milton seated, contemplating Urania, according to his own description in the Paradise Lost: Urania is seated facing him above; at his feet is Sampson Agonistes chained. The remaining figures represent the Masque of Comus; the <num value="2">two</num> Brothers drive out <num value="3">three</num> Bacchanals, with their staggering leader, Comus. The Enchanted Lady is seated in the chair: and the series is ended by <num value="2">two</num> tigers, representing the transformation of Comus's devotees. 
<P>The designs of both <hi rend=italics>basso-relievos</hi>, and the model of the antient drama, are by Mr. Flaxman. The model of the modern drama, and the execution in stone, is by Mr. Rossi. 
<P>The statues representing Tragedy and Comedy are placed in niches at each end of the front. 
<P>Tragedy, which occupies the niche in the southern extremity of the building, or that nearest to Russell Street, is a fine figure, holding the tragic mask and dagger. The sculptor is Mr. Rossi. <pb id="p.158" n="158"> 
<P>Comedy holds the shepherd's crook or <hi rend=italics>pedum</hi> on her right shoulder, and the comic mask in her left hand. This statue, which is the workmanship of Mr. Flaxman, is placed in the niche of the northern extremity of the building, next to Long Acre. 
<P>According to common conception, there is not sufficient discrimination between the <num value="2">two</num> figures; and, indeed, it is thought that they might both be taken for representations of the Tragic Muse. But the figure of Comedy is founded upon the severe taste of antiquity; and, as its object is to correct as well as please, it is marked by dignified tranquillity, more than by the smirking graces which might be supposed to characterize Farce, rather than legitimate Comedy; nor are the violent energies of Tragedy expressed in the other figure&mdash;a solemn, grave attitude, and &ldquo;looks commercing with the skies,&rdquo; give an impressive majesty to her appearance. The statue of Comedy exhibits a milder dignity, and is simply elegant. 
<div3 type=section id="c.46.3"><HEAD>Interior of the Theatre.</HEAD>
 
<P>The pit is spacious, and the benches are raised gradually, to a very convenient elevation for a view of the stage; and the galleries hold fully an equal number with the former ones, though they are on a quite different construction. <num value="1">One</num> great advantage attends this change: in summer the doors of the galleries and the windows of the lobbies being left open, the audience in those parts cannot be oppressed by heat, as in the former theatre. 
<P>Under the gallery is a row of annual boxes, constituting the <num value="3">third</num> tier; they consist of <num value="26">twenty-six</num> in number, with a private room behind each. The access to these boxes is by a beautiful staircase, exclusively appropriated to them, and not connected with any other part of the house, with also a lobby, exclusively, spacious and magnificent in the extreme.<NOTE N="*"><P>Fortunately an arrangement took place with respect to these boxes, after nearly <num value="3">three</num> months' contest in the celebrated O. P war; and they are now in use with the rest to the public.</NOTE>

<P>The lower boxes are upon the same plan as those in the old house. There is, however, an additional seat; each box will thus hold <num value="12">twelve</num> persons, being <num value="3">three</num> more than in the old house. The grand staircase from Bow Street to the boxes is most superb, and, in extent, greatly exceeds that of the Opera House. The doors of the boxes are of solid mahogany. 
<P>The front of the stage is surmounted with the royal arms, and the pillars at the sides are plain and elegant. This, indeed, is the characteristic style of the whole house. The artist has studied the <hi rend=italics>simplex munditiis</hi>, and never did artist more completely realize the principle. An elegant simplicity, equally remote from glare and glitter on the <num value="1">one</num> side, and crudity and coldness on the other, prevails throughout. The fronts of the boxes are of a colour between bronze and stone, with a Chinese flower in continuation between the tiers, and <hi rend=italics>parsem&eacute;</hi> with stars. The house is lighted by gas. 
<P>The ceiling of the Theatre is painted to imitate a dome. The proscenium of the stage is a large arch, from the top of which hang red curtains festooned in the Grecian style, and ornamented with a black Grecian border, and gold fringe: on each of these festoons is painted a gold wreath, in the centre of <num value="1">one</num> of which is written, in gold letters, the motto of the stage, &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Veluti in Speculum.</hi>&rdquo; The proscenium is supported by pillars, painted to imitate yellow stained marble, of which colour are the sides of the pit; and the stage doors are white and gold. 
<P>The artist has been also particularly attentive to the comfort and accommodation of the performers. The gentlemen's dressing-rooms are on <num value="1">one</num> side, and those of the ladies on the other. There are <num value="3">three</num> green-rooms, all of them on the side of Bow Street. The wardrobe-room is spacious and superb; in the centre is a square table, of great size, the surface mahogany, highly polished; the presses which line the room are in wainscot, finished with the most exquisite taste. 
<P>In the construction of this splendid edifice, the calamitous fate of the <num value="2">two</num> late great winter Theatres has not been forgotten. Every means of safety against fire, or other accident, that ingenuity could devise, has been adopted. At all convenient intervals are strong party-walls, with iron doors, by which, if a fire were to break out, it would be confined within that particular compartment, and be prevented from spreading through the house. The fire-places are made with the grates turned upon a pivot, by which means the front can be moved round to the back, and the fire is thus extinguished without the possibility of accident. Water-pipes are also insinuated into every part of the house, through which they are spread like veins through the human body. Great brass cocks, which, when turned, would pour the contents into the house, present themselves to the eye in the lobbies and other open places. The flight of stairs to the upper gallery consists of <num value="120">120</num> steps, and the number of bricks laid down in <num value="7">seven</num> months, amounted to <num value="7">seven</num> millions&mdash;a circumstance which may afford an idea of the magnitude of the edifice, and the celerity with which it has been built. The materials are of the best quality, and the building is most substantial and secure. Its strength was tried by immense leaden weights, placed on several tiers, greatly exceeding the weight of the most crowded audience that could be compressed into the house; and yet the building did not in any point give way in the slightest degree perceptible. This experiment was totally useless to any person competent to form an opinion of the work. To weak and timid people it may, however, be satisfactory. 
<P>The entrance to the Theatre is even grander than the Theatre itself. The noble stone portico on the outside is well known. As you enter this to proceed to the boxes, you turn to the left; and, at the top of a short flight of steps, which is surmounted on each side by a pedestal, on which is placed a bronze Grecian lamp, are seated the money-takers. After passing them, there is another noble flight of steps, along each side of which, on a level with the top step, runs a row of <num value="4">four</num> round Ionic pillars, and <num value="2">two</num> half square ones, all exactly imitated from porphyry: between each of these hangs a bronze Grecian lamp; fronting you, as you ascend these steps, is a cast statue of SHAKSPEARE, placed under an arch in the ante-room. The statue is quite a new design: the face is more like the Felton likeness than the Chandos; and the figure is standing in a graceful attitude, folding his drapery round him. The ante-room is supported by pillars in equally exact imitation of porphyry. The principal lobby is a long room, ornamented with <num value="8">eight</num> beautiful cast statues from the antique; but it is small, and the parts devoted to the serving of refreshments are rather confined. The lobby upstairs is still smaller, and the staircases are narrow. Upon the whole, however, the Theatre is well contrived, and tastefully executed; and both in its inside and outside worthy of the metropolis in which it is placed. <pb id="p.159" n="159">

<P>This Theatre was built in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct> by a carpenter, named Potter, upon mere speculation; and it appears to have remained unoccupied for <num value="13">thirteen</num> years, though it has been said that the celebrated Miss Fenton (the original &ldquo;Polly,&rdquo; in the Beggar's Opera), afterwards Duchess of Bolton, was noticed here in the year <datestruct value="1726"><year reg="1726">1726</year></datestruct>, while playing the Parish Girl, in &ldquo;What d&lsquo;ye call It?&rdquo; 
<P>It is well situated for a summer Theatre, but perhaps rather too far westward for a winter house; and is particularly convenient behind the scenes, well stocked with scenery, a good wardrobe, and every requisite for carrying on the drama. Before the curtain, the auditory part is very neatly and elegantly fitted up, the whole being white and gold; the lobbies are rather confined, but the house is exceedingly well formed for the view of the performances. 
<P>The building stands upon Crown land; and as the leases expire in a few years, it is probable the house will be rebuilt, to form a neat, elegant, and commodious Theatre, though not much larger than the present structure. The depth of the premises, from the Haymarket to Suffolk Street, is <num value="136">136</num> feet: the width, <num value="48">48</num> feet, with a scene-room, independent of the main building, on the north side, <num value="54">54</num> feet by <num value="18">18</num> feet; and will hold, at <num value="5">5</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> and <num value="1">1</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <measure value="290l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="290">290</num></measure>; there have been on a benefit night <measure value="312l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="312">312</num></measure>; but then it must be excessively crowded. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1733--"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>, Theophilus Cibber collected several deserters from the Drury Lane company, then under Highmore's management, among whom were Mills, Johnson, Miller, Griffin, Harper, and Mrs. Heron: they acted without any licence but for a short time; for, on <datestruct VALUE="1733-11-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>, it was ordered in Westminster Hall, that the revolters should quit the Haymarket, and return, within <num value="14">fourteen</num> days, to Drury Lane Theatre. 
<P>Fielding opened with what he styled <hi rend=italics>The Great Mogul's Company</hi> in <datestruct value="1735--"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>, and brought forward his <hi rend=italics>Pasquin</hi>, which he acted upwards of <num value="40">forty</num> successive nights, and in <datestruct value="1736--"><year reg="1736">1736</year></datestruct> he acted regular plays, but was not so successful as during the previous season; and next year the Licensing Act completely stopped his proceeding. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1744--"><year reg="1744">1744</year></datestruct>, Macklin started manager here, and Foote made his debut in Othello, on the <datestruct VALUE="-02-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>; Macklin performed Iago; and the famous Dr. (afterwards Sir John) Hill personated Lodovico. 
<P>Foote commenced in the spring of <datestruct value="1747--"><year reg="1747">1747</year></datestruct>, on his own account, and gave an entertainment, which he called <hi rend=italics>The Diversions of the Morning:</hi> but this being without any licence, he was compelled to call the same performance, <hi rend=italics>Foote's Giving Tea</hi>, and performed it more than <num value="40">forty</num> mornings. 
<P>On the <datestruct VALUE="1749-01-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1749">1749</year></datestruct>, the Bottle Conjuror's imposition was practised here, in which he promised to get into a quart bottle; but having filled the house, he decamped with the money; and the public, in resentment, destroyed the whole of the interior. 
<P>In the same year French plays were attempted, with a licence, and occasioned a great riot on the <num value="1">first</num> night; but though they were quietly permitted for <num value="3">three</num> successive nights, the speculation was so discouraged, that the actors shortly after were compelled to beg in the streets. 
<P>During the spring Foote brought out an entertainment called <hi rend=italics>The Auction of Pictures.</hi>

<P>Foote, in <datestruct value="1754--"><year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct>, made a successful year. 
<P>Theo. Cibber opened in <datestruct VALUE="1755-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1755">1755</year></datestruct>, and played a few nights under the title of <hi rend=italics>Bayes's Company.</hi>

<P><datestruct value="1758--"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct>. Cibber opened with the Lord Chamberlain's permission, when Mrs. Abington made her debut. 
<P>It was not, however, till <datestruct value="1760"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>, that Foote made his <num value="1">first</num> attempt to open this as a regular Theatre, during the recess of the winter houses; when he produced <hi rend=italics>The Minor.</hi>

<P>In <datestruct value="1761--"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>, the owner of some dancing dogs having previously engaged the Theatre, Foote was prevented having a season. He therefore joined Murphy, and opened Drury Lane Theatre during this summer, but regained the use of the Haymarket the following year, and continued it for the <num value="5">five</num> succeeding years, without interruption. 
<P>Between the season <datestruct value="1766--"><year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct> and <num value="7">7</num>, Foote being on a visit at Lord Mexborough's seat, was induced to mount a horse of high courage, and join in the chase; he being a bad horseman was thrown, his leg broken, and shortly after amputated. The Duke of York was of the party, and being unintentionally instrumental to the accident, succeeded in obtaining for Foote a licence, or patent for acting plays at the Haymarket, during his life, from <datestruct VALUE="-05-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct> to <datestruct VALUE="-09-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>; the winter managers being previously consulted, it was settled that that time would not infringe on their patent, being granted for the period they were closed. 
<P>Foote greatly altered and improved the Theatre, which he had taken for a term of years, and nearly rebuilt it: the inside was decorated in the Chinese style. Previously to this there was but <num value="1">one</num> gallery, and <num value="1">one</num> general entrance to the front of the house and the stage. Foote now removed <num value="2">two</num> shops in front, built the portico, and made separate entrances to each part; he then purchased a house in Suffolk Street, and made that the stage entrance. The whole now assumed the appearance of a regular Theatre, and Foote opened it on the <datestruct VALUE="1767-05-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>, with an appropriate prologue, or rather prelude, and it then became a Theatre Royal. 
<P>Several dramatic historians have stated that Foote had a Royal Patent granted to him: no such record has as yet been found. Foote probably had a <hi rend=italics>Royal Licence</hi> during life, from the above-stated period; for he could not close his treaty with Colman until he had obtained His Majesty's permission for so doing; and when the present Mr. Colman sold half, he was obliged, before the purchase could be concluded, to obtain the King's consent to add the names of Messrs. Winston and Morris to his own. 
<P>Foote now went on his regular seasons. In <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, his well-known whimsical notice to the performers appeared in the Green Room. In <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct>, he strayed out of his regular season, and presented, <datestruct VALUE="-02-15"><month reg="02">Feb.</month> <day reg=15>15</day></datestruct>, his celebrated Puppet Show, afterwards denominated &ldquo;Piety in Pattens.&rdquo; In <datestruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct>, the Royal Family <num value="1">first</num> visited the Theatre. 
<P>Foote's trial in <datestruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></datestruct> (occasioned by his attack on the Duchess of Kingston), preyed heavily on his mind, and there is very little doubt shortened his life. He bargained with Mr. Colman for the licence, <hi rend=italics>or patent</hi>, for an annuity of <measure value="1600l." type=currency>&pound; <datestruct value="1600--"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct></measure>, beside paying him as an actor; but he only lived to receive <num value="2">two</num> quarters of his annuity, and died a very, <hi rend=italics>very</hi>
poor man. Foote fell a sacrifice to his own <hi rend=italics>talents;</hi> if he had been possessed of less ability, or could have kept within the bounds of prudence in the exercise of it, he might have been a very rich man, and most probably much longer lived; but depending so entirely upon himself as actor, author, satirist, and mimic, he was quite careless respecting how the other <pb id="p.160" n="160"> parts in his pieces were acted; and as to dresses, scenes, &amp;c., &amp;c., he even hired his dresses in Monmouth Street, as he did almost every other thing, and thereby paid much more than he could have purchased them for; and still had no wardrobe, music, or any requisite to carry on the business of a Theatre. Colman opened with a prologue, written by himself, and soon re-established the Theatre: his motto was, &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Stet fortuna domus.</hi>&rdquo; 
<P>In the spring of <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>, the Opera House having been burnt down, Italian operas were performed here. To increase the number of boxes, the <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num>-shilling</measure> gallery was divided off, in something like pews, and let as private boxes. 
<P>Mr. Colman, sen., being incapable of conducting the Theatre, in consequence of a mental malady, his son, Mr. Colman, jun., was appointed committee to his estate, and manager of the Theatre; in which he has continued till the present time. 
<P>During the year <datestruct value="1793"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>, the Drury Lane Company having been deprived of the use of the Opera House on Tuesdays and Saturdays (<hi rend=italics>Opera nights</hi>), performed here on those nights. In <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>, Mr. Colman, jun., upon his own occount, by arrangement with Mr. Sheridan (with whom he agreed to pay half the renters of Drury Lane, and engage part of the company), opened upon the Drury Lane patent till the new Drury Lane Theatre was completed, which took place in the March following. 
<P>In <datestruct VALUE="1794-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>, the unhappy accident happened, by which so many lives were lost. His Majesty had commanded the play on this evening, but was totally unacquainted with the accident until he had quitted the Theatre, as were also a great majority of the audience. The unfortunate persons were <num value="15">fifteen</num> killed, and many very severely hurt. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>, Mr. Colman died, and Mr. Colman, jun., became manager and sole proprietor in his own right. Mr. Colman, in <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>, sold half the Theatre, having obtained the King's permission to include the names of the new purchasers, Messrs. J. Winston and D. E. Morris, with his own in the licence. From <datestruct VALUE="1808-12-1"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=1>1</day>, <year reg=1808>1808</year></datestruct>, till the last day of <datestruct VALUE="1809-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, the Covent Garden company, their Theatre having been destroyed by fire, acted at this Theatre. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, the licence was extended to <num value="5">five</num> months, and since progressively to <num value="7">seven</num> months, but not acted upon, on account of law disputes, &amp;c. During <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, the additional term was acted upon, and half, or rather <num value="2">second</num> price, taken for the <num value="1">first</num> time here (except when the performances were agreeably to the Drury Lane and Covent Garden licences). From the <datestruct VALUE="-09-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct> till the end of the season, the prices have been regularly <num value="5">5</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> boxes, <num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> pit, <num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="1">first</num> gallery, <num value="1">1</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> upper gallery. When half price was taken, the prices then were, box <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>, <num value="2">second</num> price <num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>; pit <num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>, <num value="2">second</num> price <num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>; <num value="1">first</num> gallery <num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>, <num value="2">second</num> price <num value="1">1</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>; upper gallery <num value="1">1</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>, <num value="2">second</num> price <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> In <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, the Theatre was not opened, on account of the disputes among the proprietors; and during the years <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg=1814>1814</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg=1815>1815</year></datestruct>, opened for very short seasons. This Theatre has suffered great injury from the winter houses extending their seasons; Covent Garden has lately kept open so late as the <datestruct VALUE="-07-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, and Drury Lane nearly as late; by which the Haymarket season has been compressed to little more than <num value="6">six</num> weeks instead of <num value="17">seventeen</num>. 
<P>The elder Colman made many endeavours to open with the commencement of his licence, and more than once closed again till the winter houses were shut. Mr. Colman, jun., in <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, made the attempt with what he called his <hi rend=italics>rural Company;</hi> he tried it again in <datestruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct>, but then dropt it. In <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, it was again brought forward, but proved unsuccessful. 
<P>For the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> years of the partnership formed in <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>, the concern went on with the greatest prosperity and profit, till, in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, Mr. Morris filed a Bill in Chancery, to remove Mr. Colman from the office of principal manager, and Mr. Winston from his office of stage manager, to both of which they were appointed by the deed of partnership in <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>; and from both of which they have not been removed. This very expensive litigation has considerably injured each individual, as well as the property; and caused the Theatre to be closed in the year <datestruct value="1813"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Messrs. Colman and Winston have given the legal notice required by the deed of partnership, that they intend to sell their shares; this they mean to effect, unless, by arbitration, or some other mode, a speedy arrangement is made so that the Theatre may be carried on with that liberality which is due to the public, and without which it is impossible to obtain the patronage of an English metropolis. 
<P>During the winter a variety of benefits for individuals take place, under the licence of the Lord Chamberlain. For many years the late Mr. Walker exhibited his Eidouranion during Lent, with great profit to himself. Oratorios have also been given here several Lent seasons, and once Music and Readings. 
<P>The Theatre is totally unincumbered, has no renters' shares, and only <num value="3">three</num> proprietors, Messrs. George Colman, James Winston, and David E. Morris. 
<P>The following eminent performers made their London entr&eacute;e here:&mdash;

<P>It will be seen by the external view, that the new Theatre was not built in any part on the site occupied by the old Theatre; though the proximity might raise a reasonable doubt hereafter with historians as to that fact, especially as there has been transferred to the new building, the long-considered valuable heritage of &ldquo;Little.&rdquo; The present Theatre is built upon land demised by the Crown for a term of <num value="99">ninety-nine</num> years, and is not more than a judicious improvement upon the former <num value="1">one</num>, without a peculating attack on the <num value="2">two</num> material senses of seeing and hearing. 
<P>The old Theatre closed on Saturday, the <datestruct VALUE="1820-10-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month> <year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>,<NOTE N="*"><P>We preserve the Farewell Address as delivered by Mr. Terry. 
<P>&ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen, This night closes the performances at this Theatre, which, in consequence of the great improvements in this part of the capital, is, it seems, to be pulled down. Yet it is not without regret that we take our leaves of a building which has been honoured with your liberal protection for more than half a century, and which has introduced so many celebrated authors and favourite performers to your flattering approbation and the distinction of your patronage. 
<P>&ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen, Various unforeseen circumstances have arisen to depress this property; and the constant encroachment of the winter Theatres upon its season (originally established under a Royal Patent), has so materially injured it, as to threaten its very existence, and to reduce the Proprietors to the alternative of either supinely submitting to the annihilation of their interests, or assiduously struggling to obtain <hi rend=italics>an independent company.</hi>

<P>&lsquo;&ldquo;The preparations for a <hi rend=italics>new Theatre</hi> are in a forward state, and the Proprietors confidently trust, that by next season they shall be able to welcome their kind patrons in a Theatre <hi rend=italics>more commodious</hi>, and worthy their countenance and protection. 
<P>&ldquo;And now, Ladies and Gentlemen, the Proprietors beg you to accept their most grateful acknowledgments for your liberal support, and to assure you that it will still be their unremitting study to merit your favour, and ensure a continuance of your protection. All the performers, Ladies and Gentlemen, desire me to unite their grateful thanks for your distinguished approbation, and we all most cordially bid you farewell.&rdquo;</NOTE> with the tragedy of King Lear, and the farce of Fortune's Frolic; and the new Theatre opened as early as the <datestruct VALUE="-07-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct> following, with an Address from Mr. Terry, the inimitable comedy of the Rivals, and a new petite opera, called Peter and Paul, or Love in the Vineyards. 
<P>So much has been done by the artists in the <num value="2">two</num> views of this Theatre, that very little remains to be added of a house, of which the history has scarcely commenced. 
<P>The ceiling presents an allegorical painting of Morning, represented as Apollo, guiding the chariot of the Sun, while the cooling Zephyr floats upon the horizon. As a contrast in the opposite quarter, we descry Cynthia, as Night, clothed with stars, retiring before her more resplendent compeer. We are at a loss to know in what manner this supposed allegory is, or ever was, applicable to either the time or the amusements of a Theatre. Our ancestors never, that we have heard, frequented playhouses sufficiently early for the &ldquo;silken flag&rdquo; to glare in the beams of the &ldquo;rising sun;&rdquo; and for ourselves we must admit the quiet glow of the yet young moon seems more apposite with the hour of amusement, and more likely to associate with many of the scenes that form the business of the stage, though we doubt if either could be justified as a correct taste. Again, we have attached as ornaments, groups of Cupids, with trophies of the different seasons. All this, if not absolutely absurd, is as inconsistent as dressing the actor of Macbeth in a gold laced coat, bag wig, and cocked hat. Nor does the proscenium, embellished, probably, to correspond with the ceiling, display a more correct judgment. The complicated drop scene has been attempted to be rendered intelligible to &ldquo;human eye&rdquo; by the following description, put forth under authority, and which, fortunately, does not leave conjecture anything to supply. It &ldquo;represents, on the left hand of the audience, the entrance of a temple of &ldquo;the composite order, richly ornamented with basso relievos, and supposed to be dedicated to Apollo. The statues of &ldquo;Thalia and Melpomene surmount the principal entrance. On the right hand, an altar dedicated to Beauty; and &ldquo;flowers and various ornaments, allusive to the costumes of the Bacchantes, are also introduced. The era of the new &ldquo;building, as well as of the new and glorious reign of the present Monarch, are alluded to by the temple of the &ldquo;Muses, illuminated by the glory of the rising sun [<hi rend=italics>Risum teneatis amici</hi>], that spreads its beams over the whole &ldquo;scene.&rdquo; The arch of the roof appears supported by palm-trees, which are novel and simple, and have a good effect: however, as a plant not being indigenous, rather inapplicable to the present purpose. The boxes consist of <num value="2">two</num> tiers (being <num value="1">one</num> more than in the old house), besides <num value="2">two</num> rows of side boxes, having projecting fronts formed in pannel, and ornamented with a light gilt frame-work over a pink ground. The pit and galleries are commodious; and the spectator finds an advantage from the seats being rather wider apart than in the former Theatre. An attempt was properly made to assist the voice of the actors by a sounding-board over the stage, which not answering, was removed at the end of the <num value="1">first</num> season. 
<P>For the immediate purpose of building this Theatre rent-charges were created at <num value="22">22</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> per annum for each <num value="250">250</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>
subscribed, with the privilege of admission to any part of the house (except the stage, behind the scenes, and private boxes), for <num value="20">twenty</num> years, from the <datestruct VALUE="1821-04-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="04">April</month> <year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>, and to be transferable annually free of expense. It was stated that the old Theatre, as well as the new <num value="1">one</num>, were free from every debt or claim, and that the rent-charges were to raise <num value="12000">12,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> being &ldquo;the <num value="1">first</num> and only charge on the Theatre, except the ground-rent.&rdquo; 
<P>It was somewhat unfortunate that economy was an absolute preliminary to the building of this Theatre, although not of a gigantic size; and we regret the necessity of observing, that the word has been misused for parsimony. The staircases, balustrades, and lobbies, awakened, from strong similarity, the keenest recollection, so repeatedly impressed upon our memory as poor authors, by our forced visits to the King's Bench prison. They are rude, naked, and chilling; and the effect of the view of them, in passing to the interior, is petrifying, and repels all those associations of comfort and hilarity, which the mind naturally embodies in its eagerness for recreation and pleasure. 
<P>There is a descent of steps in the avenue to the pit. Who could have expected it? and what bold architect will attempt, by reasoning, to justify the same, after the fatal accident at the old Theatre in <datestruct VALUE="1794-02--"><month reg="02">February</month> <year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>?

<P>At the beginning of the last century, the company of players with the celebrated Betterton at their head, having refitted the Tennis Court in Little Lincoln's Inn Fields, performed there with considerable success for a few seasons; but finding the house too small, and that the Drury Lane company were more attractive than themselves, by possessing a more convenient and spacious theatre, and backed by the Kit-cat club, joined in a proposition made them by Sir <hi rend=italics>John Vanbrugh</hi>, to build for their use a stately theatre in the <hi rend=italics>Haymarket;</hi> which, as being nearer the court than the neighbourhood of Drury Lane, might be more likely to succeed than any other part of the metropolis. To commence the building of this Theatre, Sir John began with raising a subscription of <measure value="30000l." type=currency><num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> pounds</measure> from <num value="300">three hundred</num> persons of quality, at <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">one hundred</num> pounds</measure> each; in consideration whereof every subscriber, for his own life, was to be admitted to whatever entertainments should be publicly performed there, without farther payment for his entrance. The plan succeeded to Sir John's wish, the money was raised, and the building begun under Sir John's inspection, who was himself the sole architect, as well as <num value="1">first</num> projector. Of this Theatre <hi rend=italics>Colley Cibber</hi> informs us, he saw the <num value="1">first</num> stone laid, in <datestruct value="1704--"><year reg="1704">1704</year></datestruct>; &ldquo;on which was inscribed <hi rend=italics>the little Whig</hi>, in honour to a lady of extraordinary beauty, then the celebrated toast, and pride of that party.&rdquo; A satirical writer says, &ldquo;The Kit Cat club is now grown famous and notorious all over the kingdom, and they have built a Temple for their Dagon, the new play-house in the Haymarket. The foundation was laid with great solemnity, by a noble babe of grace;<NOTE N="*"><P>The &ldquo;Babe of Grace&rdquo; or &ldquo;Little Whig;&rdquo; was the beautiful Lady Sunderland, <num value="2">second</num> Daughter of the Duke of Marlborough.

In this golden dream they however found themselves miserably deceived and disappointed; as, on the opening of this grand and superb structure, it was immediately discovered, that almost every quality and convenience of a good theatre had been sacrificed and neglected, to show the spectator a vast triumphal piece of architecture! and that the best play was less capable of delighting the auditor here, than it would be in the plain and unadorned house they had just come from; for, what with their vast columns, their gilded cornices, and immoderately high roof, scarce <num value="1">one</num> word in <num value="10">ten</num> could be distinctly heard. The extraordinary and superfluous space occasioned such an undulation from the voice of every actor, that generally, what they said sounded like the gabbling of so many people in the lofty isles of a cathedral. The tone of a trumpet, or the swell of a musical voice, might be sweetened by it; but the articulate sounds of a speaking voice were drowned by the hollow reverberations of <num value="1">one</num> word upon another. &lsquo;Tis true, the spectators were struck with surprise and wonder at the magnificent appearance the house displayed on every way they turned their eyes. The ceiling over the orchestra was a semi-oval arch, that sprung <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet higher from above the cornice. The ceiling over the pit, too, was still more raised; being <num value="1">one</num> level line from the highest back part of the upper gallery, to the front of the stage. The front boxes were a continued semicircle to the bare walls of the house on each side, and the effect altogether truly surprising. In the course of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> years the ceilings over both the orchestra and pit were lowered; and instead of the semi-oval arch, that over the orchestra was made a flat, which greatly improved the hearing. Not long before, the Italian Opera began <num value="1">first</num> to steal into England; but in as rude a disguise, and unlike itself as possible, in a lame, hobbling translation into our own language; with false quantities, or metre out of measure, to its original notes; sung by our own unskilful voices, with graces misapplied to almost every sentiment, and with action lifeless and unmeaning through every character. The <num value="1">first</num> <hi rend=italics>Italian</hi> performer that made any distinguished figure in it, was <hi rend=italics>Valentini</hi>, a true sensible singer at that time, but of a throat too weak to sustain those melodious warblings for which the fairer sex have since idolized his successors. To strike in, therefore, with this prevailing novelty, 
<hi rend=italics>Sir John Vanbrugh</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Mr Congreve</hi> opened their new Haymarket Theatre, on Easter Monday, <datestruct VALUE="1705-04-9"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=9>9th</day>, <year reg=1705>1705</year></datestruct>; with Signor Giacomo Greber's Loves of Ergasto, set to Italian music; a prologue by Mrs. Bracegirdle, written by Garth: and plays commenced by the Lincoln's Inn Fields company under Betterton, who had closed the latter theatre, with the Virtuoso and Acis and Galatea, on <datestruct VALUE="-03-31"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=31>31st</day></datestruct>. They acted every evening till <datestruct VALUE="-06-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>; but their short career evidently wanted attraction.

The Triumph of Love was acted about <num value="5">five</num> nights, by foreigners, without success; and plays were then performed, the <num value="1">first</num> new piece being the Conquest of Spain. The following Oct. re-opened by Vanbrugh only, with a new comedy by him, called the Confederacy; in the company were Betterton, Leigh, Booth, Pinkethman, Dogget, Pack, Mrs. Porter, Mrs. Bracegirdle, &amp;c.

The scenes were new, representing Arcadia; but the habits were old. It was a short opera, and on <num value="2">second</num> representation the boxes, were raised to half a guinea.

On the <datestruct VALUE="1713-01-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> <month reg="01">January</month> <year reg="1713">1713</year></datestruct>, was performed a tragic opera, with heroic habits, <num value="4">four</num> new scenes, and other costly decorations, called Theseus, with music by Handel. M<hi rend=sup>c</hi>Swiney the manager, having ineffectually tried to obtain a subscription for <num value="6">six</num> nights, gave out tickets for <num value="2">two</num> nights only; laying the boxes and pit into <num value="1">one</num>; and the house was very full at each performance. After the <num value="2">second</num> night M<hi rend=sup>c</hi>Swiney absented himself without paying the singers' salaries, and leaving the habits and the scenes unpaid for. This circumstance created considerable confusion among the singers, who finally resolved to go on with the opera on their own account, dividing the gain amongst them, under the superintendence of Monsieur John James Heidegger. On <datestruct VALUE="-01-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>, Theseus repeated at the usual prices, and house much fuller than on preceding night.

The following is a description of a subscription masquerade at the Opera House, &ldquo;allowed to be more magnificent than has been known in Italy, Venice, or any other countries.&rdquo; 
<P>&ldquo;The room (says the writer) is exceedingly large, beautifully adorned and illuminated with <num value="500">500</num> wax lights; on the sides are divers beaufets, over which is written the several wines therein contained, as Canary, Burgundy, Champaign, Rhenish, &amp;c. each most excellent in its kind; of which all are at liberty to drink what they please; with large services of all sorts of sweetmeats. There are also <num value="2">two</num> sets of music, at due distance from each other, performed by very good hands. By the vast variety of dresses (many of them very rich) you would fancy it a congress of the principal persons of all nations in the world, as Turks, Italians, Indians, Polanders, Spaniards, Venetians, &amp;c. There is an absolute freedom of speech, without the least offence given thereby; while all appear better bred than to offer at any thing profane, rude, or immodest, but wit incesantly flashes about in repartees, honour and good humour, and all kinds of pleasantry. There was also the groom porter's office, where all play that please, while heaps of guineas pass about with so little concern in the losers, that they are not to be distinguished from the winners. Nor does it add a little to the beauty of the entertainment, to see the generality of the masqueraders behave themselvs agreeable to their several habits. The number, when I was there on Tuesday, last week, was computed at <num value="700">700</num>, with some files of musquetiers at hand, for the preventing any disturbance which might happen by quarrels, &amp;c. so frequent in Venice, Italy, and other countries, on such entertainments. At <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock a person gives notice that supper is ready, when the company pass into another large room, where a noble cold entertainment is prepared, suitable to all the rest; the whole diversion continuing from <num value="9">nine</num> o'clock till <num value="7">seven</num> next morning.

Senesino then returned, and Faustini and Cuzzoni still engaged.

House closed <datestruct VALUE="-06-6"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=6>6th</day></datestruct>.<NOTE N="**"><P>About this period arose the long, violent, but petty and ridiculous altercation, between the rival heroines Cuzzoni and Faustini, and their respective fashionable supporters, for the useless right of precedence. It was said, by a writer in the <hi rend=italics>Craftsman</hi>, &ldquo;the adherents on both sides are very numerous; Faustini's are the most powerful, but Cuzzoni's the most judicious.&rdquo; The same writer remarks: &ldquo;The case it seems, stands thus. The right of possession is certainly in Cuzzoni, which she hath enjoyed, without molestation, for some years, and is confirmed to her by divers treaties between her and the Academy. Faustina, on the other hand, jusists that Cuzzoni hath consented and promised to yield up that right to her, by a secret stipulation under her own hand, which she is ready to produce. Cuzzoni seems to prevaricate a little in this affair; for, as she cannot well deny her own hand-writing, she would persuade the world that it is only a sort of promise; or, as she terms it amongst her friends, an artful finesse and expedient to make Faustina easy for the present.&rdquo; Sir John Hawkins tells us, &ldquo;The directors, greatly troubled with this dispute, and foreseeing the probable consequences of it, fell upon an odd expedient to determine it. The time for a new contract with each of these singers was at hand, and they agreed among themselves to give a salary to Faustini, <num value="1">one</num> guinea a year more than to her rival. Lady Pembroke and some others, the friends of Cuzzoni, hearing this, made her swear upon the Holy Gospels never to take less than Faustini, and the directors continuing firm in their resoluion not to give her quite so much, Cuzzoni found herself ensnared by her oath, into the necessity of quitting the kingdom. This she did at the end of the following season, when her engagement probably terminated, and Faustini, as well as Senesino, also quitted England at the same period.&rdquo; Etiquette and precedence in the opera establishment, is allowed to an absurd extent. We write in <datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>, and know if Signora A. anounces to the manager she is ill (or fancies so), and cannot (or will not) perform, and he obtains a substitute in Signora B.; after that preliminary is arranged, the express permission of Signora A. must be got, to permit Signora B.&rsquo;s appearance, by the manager, before he dare venture to announce the alteration.</NOTE>

<P>The continued disputes and separations which daily took place between the managers and players of the King's and Duke of York's Companies, from their <num value="1">first</num> establishment at the Restoration, to the reign of George the <num value="1">First</num>; and the erection of a large Theatre in the Haymarket, by Sir John Vanbrugh; induced a person named Odell<NOTE N="*"><P>It was in the year <datestruct value="1728"><year reg="1728">1728</year></datestruct>, that Odell took a th owster's shop in Ayliffe Street, Goodman's Fields, and collecting together a number of strolling players of both sexes, <num value="1">first</num> opened it as a Theatre.</NOTE> to found another at the east end of the town, for the like theatrical purposes, and who boldly, without any licence whatever, began to act plays: in this practice he continued unmolested a year or <num value="2">two</num>, in which time a number of brothels and other houses of ill fame collecting in the neighbourhood, it was considered a nuisance too near the City, and the Lord Mayor and Aldermen petitioned the Crown to suppress it: but at the same time a lawsuit<NOTE N="*"><emph><hi rend=italics>On the Playhouse Dispute at Westminster.</hi></emph>

The case of the actor was thus: the patentees and managers of the King's Company were much distressed, and considerable losers, by the desertion of their principal performers, who had set up for themselves in the Haymarket; when the patentees were advised to put the Act of the <num value="12">twelfth</num> of Queen Anne in force against these deserters, as vagabonds; accordingly Mr. Harper was taken from the stage by a Justice of Peace's warrant, and committed to <hi rend=italics>Bridewell</hi>, as <num value="1">one</num> within the penalty of the said Act. When the legality of this commitment was tried in Westminster Hall, the actor obtained a verdict in his favour, it appearing he was a housekeeper, and having a vote for the Westminster Members of Parliament.

<P>We have been well informed Mr. Cibber was mistaken in his observation on the pleadings in Court at that trial, that, so far from the circumstance of being a housekeeper serving as a protection from the Vagrant Act, a learned counsellor asserted, that it was in the power of the greatest subject in England to be guilty of an act of vagrancy; and that the only point to be disputed was, whether Harper's performing in the Haymarket Theatre was committing that act.</NOTE> with the congratulations of crowds that attended and wished well to his cause. 
<P>The cause of the prosecuted comedian having gone so strongly in his favour, the House in Goodman's Fields continued to act with impunity. In <datestruct value="1737--"><year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct> the property of this Theatre had passed into the hands of Mr. Henry Giffard, who, encouraged by a subscription, pulled it down, and rebuilt it in a very handsome and expensive manner, under the direction of Shepherd, the architect of Covent Garden Theatre.

Such a ph&aelig;nomenon as Garrick was not calculated long to illume the meridian of Goodman's Fields; and, with the departure of the British Roscius, to adorn the western stage, the interest and attraction of the Theatre in Goodman's Fields sunk to rise no more. <pb id="p.169" n="169">

<p><FIGURE id="fig.2.168.1" n="2000.66.0087"><HEAD>Arena of the <placename>Royalty Theatre, Well Street, Wellclose Square</placename>; Built by John Palmer, Esq. formerly of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; Proscenium.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 
<P>The origin of this Theatre sprung from the Quixotic attempt of a celebrated performer to raise his fame and fortune by a bold venture at once; but, unfortunately, in the experiment, he not only lost the whole capital of the well-earned toil of many years' industrious application and deserved reputation, but entailed on himself and family a series of distresses and misfortunes, that ended but with his life. Mr. John Palmer, of Drury Lane Theatre, in conjunction with several friends, having projected a scheme for the erection of a Theatre at the east end of the metropolis, proceeded to raise as much money as possible by subscription, and otherwise, to carry their plans into effect: in consequence, on the <datestruct VALUE="1785-12-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> day of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct>, Mr. Palmer, assisted by his son (a grand procession being made on the occasion), laid the <num value="1">first</num> stone of the spacious building intended for a new Theatre, near Wellclose Square, and deposited in a cavity appropriated for that purpose, an inscription, which was publicly read by John Morgan, Esq., Recorder of Maidstone; of which the following is an authentic copy: &ldquo;The inscription on this scroll is intended to convey the following information; That, on Monday, the <datestruct VALUE="-12-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> day of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, in the year of our Lord <datestruct value="1785--"><year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct>, and in the <num value="26">26th</num> year of the reign of our Most Gracious Sovereign George the <num value="3">Third</num>, the <num value="1">first</num> stone of a building, intended for a place of public entertainment, was laid by John Palmer, Comedian, in the presence of a numerous party of friends to the undertaking; John Wilmot, Esq., being the architect and builder. The ground selected for the purpose, being situated within the liberty of His Majesty's fortress and palace of the Tower of London, it has been resolved, that, in honour of the magistrates, the military officers, and inhabitants of the said fortress and palace, the edifice, when erected, shall be called THE ROYALTY THEATRE, sanctioned by authority, and liberally patronized by subscription.&rdquo; Mr. Palmer was the appointed manager; and among the performers engaged, were Messrs. Quick, Ryder, Johnstone; Mrs. Martyr, Mrs. Wells, &amp;c. The opening of the Theatre was announced for <datestruct VALUE="1787-06-20"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=20>20</day>, <year reg=1787>1787</year></datestruct>; but, previous to this, a cautionary advertisement appeared in the public prints, signed by Messrs. Harris, Linley, and Colman, managers of the Theatres Royal, showing the statute which enacts, that persons, acting contrary to the provisions in that act, shall be deemed <hi rend=italics>rogues</hi> and <hi rend=italics>vagabonds;</hi> and announcing a determination to prosecute all who should offend against the law. This had the desired effect, and all the chief actors and actresses seceded from the company. Fnding they could not act legally for hire, a subterfuge was resorted to, and the Theatre was opened for the benefit of the London Hospital, with the comedy of &ldquo;As You Like It,&rdquo; and the farce of &ldquo;Miss in her Teens,&rdquo; the characters were not expressed in the bills of the day, but were as follow:

<P>The house was exceedingly full, but far from brilliant, as no ladies of distinction ventured in, the contest for places being so violent. The curtain rose at <num value="7">seven</num> o'clock, and a few voices calling for Mr. Palmer's patent, occasioned some disturbance, which was soon quelled, and the performance commenced with a prologue, written on the occasion, by Arthur Murphy, Esq., and spoken by Mr. Palmer. The play and farce being concluded, Mr. Palmer, having previously requested the audience would stay, came forward, and read an address, in which it was stated, &ldquo;That the Theatre was built under a letter of approbation from the Lieutenant Governor of the Tower; and, being situated in a palace and fortress, in a district immediately within his jurisdiction, his consent, added to a licence obtained from the magistrates, authorizing a place of public entertainment, was deemed legal authority;&rdquo; that, under that impression, he had embarked his all in this Theatre, and in the event of it, everything dear to his family was involved; but when he considered the case of other performers, who had been also threatened with prosecutions, he felt, whatever risk he ran himself, it was too much for them to venture on. He begged pardon of the audience for trespassing on their patience, but that, circumstanced as things were, and a combination being formed to oppress and ruin him, it was not in his power to give out another play. Mr. Palmer proceeded. &ldquo;Under the Act of Parliament, which empowers the magistrate to allow certain performances, I obtained a licence; and to whatever purpose of innocent amusement this Theatre may be converted, your future patronage will abundantly compensate for every difficulty I have had to encounter. Tumblers and dancing dogs might appear before you unmolested; but the other performers and myself standing forward to exhibit a moral play, is deemed a crime. The purpose, however, for which we have this night exerted ourselves, may serve to show that a Theatre near Wellclose Square, may be as useful as in Covent Garden, Drury Lane, or the Haymarket. All that remains at present is to return you my most grateful thanks for the indulgence with which you have honoured me this night; I forbear to enlarge upon that subject&mdash;my heart is too full&mdash;I have not words to express my feelings. I shall be ever devoted to your service. Until it is announced that this house shall be again opened with a species of entertainment not subjecting me to danger, I humbly take my leave.&rdquo; The issue of this contest appeared soon after in an advertisement, in which Mr. Palmer declared his intention of opening his Theatre on Monday, <datestruct VALUE="-07-3"><month reg="07">July</month> the <day reg=3>3rd</day></datestruct>, &ldquo;with a species of entertainment, which the too rigid censors of his conduct could not impede.&rdquo; The Theatre accordingly opened with burlettas, pantomimes, &amp;c.; and so attached was Mr. Palmer to the undertaking, that he, and Mr. Bannister, sen., whose friendship made him forget his interest, absolutely refused to return in the winter to their former situations. Some interest was made to get a patent now, but superior interest baffled the design; and when the Theatre lost the attraction of novelty, it dwindled into nothing, Mr. Palmer laid down his office of manager, and returned to Old Drury, where he was warmly congratulated by his admiring friends and the public in general. The Royalty Theatre was shut up for some years, but lately has been occupied in various theatrical speculations, and is now in use under the denomination of &ldquo;The East London Theatre.&rdquo;

<P>Henry Killegrew having obtained a patent from King Charles II. to build a Theatre for dramatic entertainments, collected a company of performers from among those dispersed at the breaking out of the civil wars, and until such time as he could get his Theatre in Drury Lane ready for their reception, had plays for a time at the Red Bull, in St. John's Street, and afterwards converted Gibbon's Tennis Court, Clare Market, Little Lincoln's Inn Fields, into a temporary Theatre; at which <num value="2">two</num> places his company continued performing in all <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, <datestruct value="1661--"><year reg="1661">1661</year></datestruct>, and some of them during <datestruct value="1662--"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct> and part of <datestruct value="1663--"><year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct>: at which period the Theatre in Drury Lane was finished and made ready for performances, where they in future continued acting, calling themselves His Majesty's Company of Comedians<NOTE N="*"><P>The performers were Mr. Theophilus Bird, Mr. Hart, Mr. Mohun, Mr. Lacy, Mr. Burt, Mr. Cartwright, Mr. Clun, Mr. Baxter, Mr. Robert Shatterell, Mr. William Shatterell, Mr. Duke, Mr. Hancock, Mr. Kynaston, Mr. Wintersel, Mr. Bateman, Mr. Blagden. It appears by this list of the actors of Drury Lane, that all the performers who had acted before the civil wars, were selected to complete the King's Company, and Kynaston taken from the company that acted under Rhodes, the bookseller, at the Cockpit, Drury Lane.</NOTE>; which olearly proves Gibbon's Tennis Court was never other than a temporary Theatre, and no way connected with the Duke's Theatre in Portugal Street, with which its history has been often confusedly blended.

The nobility likewise bestowed their influence; the Lord Chamberlain also interested the KING in their favour, as men that had suffered much and gained little; so that, under the royal sanction, aided by the liberality of the Court and of the City, the interior of the Great Tennis Court in Lincoln's Inn Fields<NOTE N="*"><P>This Tennis Court is mentioned in <hi rend=italics>old plays</hi>, and indeed in documents of superior authority, as situated near Holywell Street, St. Clement Danes. It was a licensed gaming-house, under the direction of Clement Cotterell, Esq., groom-porter to King James I. The Duke's Theatre was in this place, then called Little Lincoln's Inn Fields, <hi rend=italics>Bear Yard</hi>, &amp;c., but totally distinct from the other.</NOTE> was a <num value="2">second</num> time cleared, and within its walls a Theatre was erected; which, under the auspices of Congreve, Betterton, &amp;c., was opened on the <datestruct VALUE="1695-04-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>, with the new comedy of &ldquo;Love for Love&rdquo; (which was performed with extraordinary success the remainder of the season), and closed in June. Mr. Betterton is said to have been induced to quit Drury Lane, partly by ill treatment from the managers, and partly with a view to repair, by more enlarged profits from speculation, the loss of his whole fortune (upwards of <num value="2000">2000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>), which he had suffered in the year <datestruct value="1692"><year reg="1692">1692</year></datestruct>, by adventuring it in a commercial scheme to the East Indies. 
<P>The prosperity of this new Playhouse, though great at <num value="1">first</num>, was by no means permanent; and after <num value="2">two</num> years' sunshine, the affairs of the Company suffered so much, that the concern was entirely broken up, and the performers dispersed: from that time the Tennis Court Theatre was never used for any public dramatic purpose. 
<P>The site of Gibbon's Tennis Court, and other tenements, in <hi rend=italics>Bear Yard</hi>, near Clare Market, was the spot originally called Ficket's Fields, where the Lollards met temp.

VIII. to Anthony Singer; rent to the Crown <num value="17">17</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> Charles I., in his <num value="15">fifteenth</num> year, granted to Thomas York, his executors and assigns, license to erect as many buildings as they thought proper, upon St. Clement's Inn Fields, in that parish, the inheritance of the then Earl of Clare, to be built on each side of the causeway leading from Gibbon's Booling Alley, at the coming out of Lincoln's Inn Fields, to the Rein Deer Yard, that leadeth to Drury Lane. When Clare Market was erected, <datestruct value="1657--"><year reg="1657">1657</year></datestruct>, Rein Deer Yard was, from the sports of the butchers, called <hi rend=italics>Bear Yard;</hi> and the south-west corner of the square, Little Lincoln's Inn Fields. A part of this Theatre was occupied by James Belbon, a brewer, who, about <num value="45">forty-five</num> years ago, kept the Lamb Brewhouse, in Vere Street, Clare Market, from which there was a passage into Bear Yard. His ale, &amp;c., was brewed on or under the stage part of the Theatre: and we are informed that, at the time the affairs of the Roman Catholics demanded privacy, they used to meet in this house, which had an oratory standing, until about the year <datestruct value="1680"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>. The original sign of the HOLY LAMB in stone was preserved. Dr. Oates resided near this place at the beginning of his career. 
<P>The remains of this little Theatre, which, from their obscure situation, had long been unnoticed, were accidentally discovered after a fire, which happened <datestruct VALUE="1809-09-17"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=17>17</day>, <year reg=1809>1809</year></datestruct>, and which left nothing but a portion of the bare walls. The inside, in the various transformations it had undergone, had been stripped many years before, and retained but little to remind us of its former destination: for some time it had been respectively devoted to the purposes of a carpenter's shop, and to boiling the provisions of a neighbouring dealer in tripe. 
<P>At the back of <hi rend=italics>Bear Yard</hi>, Little Lincoln's Inn Fields, is a public house, still remaining, known by the name of the 
<hi rend=italics>Black Jack</hi>, long celebrated as a rendezvous for players, who have used it as a place of general meeting since the time of Shuter, the comedian, who frequented it; and where the performers of Drury Lane and Covent Garden Theatres, mostly met the friends to whom they had promised <hi rend=italics>orders:</hi> it used to be constantly attended by Suett, Sedgwick, Quick, Munden, Edwin, &amp;c., of late days; and heretofore by Shuter, Dunstall, Weston, and other celebrated comedians; but the present resort of most theatrical persons is the O. P. and P. S. Coffee-house, Russel Court, Drury Lane, and the Coal Hole Chop-house, Fountain Court, Strand, where most country managers and theatrical candidates daily meet on business as well as pleasure. 
<P>The view representing the ruins occasioned by the fire in Bear Yard, Little Lincoln's Inn Fields, <datestruct VALUE="1809-09-17"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=17>17</day>, <year reg=1809>1809</year></datestruct>, is that of the original Tennis Court, used <num value="1">first</num> as a Theatre by the King's Company of Comedians, under Killegrew's patent, until the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane was built, and made ready for their reception: but not at any period occupied by the Duke of York's Company, under Sir William D&lsquo;Avenant, as often erroneously it has been thought. <pb id="p.173" n="173">

<P>In the summer of <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>, Mr. Astley, sen., the original projector of Horsemanship amusements, and proprietor of the Amphitheatre, Westminster Bridge Road, obtained a license from the Lord Chamberlain to exhibit similar amusements in the City of Westminster, during the period his <hi rend=italics>Amphitheatre of Arts</hi> (as he styled it) was closed, viz., from Michaelmas until the Passion Week following. He had seen, and was in treaty for a piece of seemingly waste ground, part of the site on which stood the well-known tavern, named after the Queen of Bohemia, who, subsequent to the death of her royal consort, was privately married to the Earl of Craven, and resided here, when it was called Craven House; but afterwards being converted to a tavern, the owner adopted the sign of the Queen of Bohemia's Head, in commemoration of her residence in the house. The ground Mr. Astley speculated on, seemed the most unfit and confined for theatrical purposes, being everything in shape but a square, round, or oval; indeed, it was composed of almost every possible angle. Notwithstanding this disadvantage Mr. Astley commenced building, and was his own designer and architect. On the <datestruct VALUE="1806-09-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, it was opened, under the title of the OLYMPIC PAVILION. The auditory part represented a large tent, showing the timbers, roof and rafters, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. The accommodation consisted of <num value="1">one</num> round tier of boxes, a pit underneath, and a gallery at the back of the pit, enclosed with iron chains, which was a very dungeon. There was a ride in the centre, and an orchestra ranging with the boxes upstairs: the stage was on a level with the ride, and part of it was taken into the ride whenever the latter was used for horsemanship; the horses came through the stage-door, and the preparation occupied considerable time. The Theatre was lighted by <num value="12">twelve</num> Grecian (patent) lamps, suspended from the roof, and a centre lustre of <num value="24">twenty-four</num> patent lamps. 
<P>The building was entirely of wood; the roof (with a small dome in the centre) covered with sheets of tin, canvassed over, and then pitched and tarred. The expense attending this temporary building was as much as would have erected a substantial Theatre; and Mr. Astley resorted to every species of exhibition, as horses, elephants, dogs, tumblers, jumpers, and flyers, to fill his house, but to very little purpose. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct> Mr. Elliston purchased all Astley's right for <num value="3000">3000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> (and a small annuity during his life), subject to a ground-rent of <num value="130">130</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> a year for the Theatre, and house in Craven Buildings connected with the Theatre. The lease is for <num value="63">63</num> years, with the option of purchase from the ground landlord (Lord Craven) at <num value="2000">2000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> A short time before Elliston's purchase, Astley had considerably altered the house, removing the gallery to its proper situation over the boxes; to effect which, he materially raised the roof, converted the ride into a commodious pit, and at a great expense, and on an entirely new plan, made the HORSE-RIDE on the stage. Every time the horsemanship was exhibited, <num value="16">sixteen</num> large and heavy flaps were to be hoisted up by tackle, and the circular ride appeared about <num value="2">two</num> feet below the level of the stage; the loss of time this preparation occasioned, made him soon abandon it entirely. 
<P>Besides the internal improvements, a colonnade was formed on <num value="2">two</num> sides of the Theatre, which has greatly added to the convenience of the public. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct> Astley was, from money expended and ill success, nearly <num value="10000">10,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> minus by this concern, when Mr. Elliston took it off his hands, and placed the amusements on a more respectable footing than ever they had been conducted under his predecessor. It was opened in the autumn of that year, under the title of the LITTLE DRURY LANE THEATRE, with an excellent company, and the Theatre much altered, improved, and decorated. In <num value="3">three</num> weeks the Lord Chamberlain obliged Mr. Elliston to close his exhibitions; but on the <datestruct VALUE="1813-12-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, he re-opened as the Olympic Theatre, and during that and the subsequent season, the House was more numerously and respectably attended than it had ever been before; but not to equal the expense the proprietor had put himself to in the fittings up, decorations, and alterations. 
<P>After the close of the season <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, Mr. Elliston, in his usual liberal and spirited manner, expended a considerable sum, in order to give the public a very superior Theatre and entertainments, to any hitherto produced in what are styled Minor Theatres. The whole of the interior was rebuilt and elegantly decorated; <num value="6">six</num> <hi rend=italics>nightly</hi> private boxes added, a commodious pit and spacious entrances made; superb new chandeliers put up, a handsome coffee-room, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. 
<P>For the stage (which was all new, both scenery and decorations) was engaged an excellent company to act the pieces, and Messrs. Dibdin, Oulton, Barrymore, Lawler, and Moncrief, were retained as authors; Messrs. Charles Horn, G. W. Reeve, M. Corri, and Nicholson, as composers. 
<P><hi rend=italics>The Diamond Arrow, All at Coventry</hi>, and <hi rend=italics>Bamfylde Moore Carew</hi>, written by Mr. Moncrief (a young man of great talent), deserve most particular mention as pieces of very superior merit. Neither of our Theatres Royal could have preserved better order in their Theatres, or their performances have been more punctually conducted than was that year observed here. The Theatre was well attended; but <num value="1">one</num> season cannot repay the heavy expense of extensive alteration and improvements. 
<P>The prices are, boxes <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>, pit <num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>, gallery <num value="1">1</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>; half-price is taken at half past <num value="8">eight</num>, and the house will hold <num value="150">150</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>
The stage is very large, and capable of exhibiting any stage performance. 
<P>Mr. Elliston, about <num value="2">two</num> years ago, had plans made by Mr. Wilkins, for building a superb Theatre, extending its front into Newcastle Street (and had negotiated for <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> houses which stood in his way, and were to have been pulled down; the expense, however, of his last improvement, we believe, has caused him to abandon the idea entirely. The Theatre was to have cost <num value="25000">25,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>

<p><FIGURE id="fig.2.174.1" n="2000.66.0090"><HEAD>South West View of <placename>Sadler's Wells</placename>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 
<P>The history of Sadler's Wells is combined with the following circumstances: Nearly in the centre of the coach-yard of this popular place of summer amusement, is a well of mineral water, covered by a brick arch, to which originally numbers came for relief from nervous and other disorders; it belonged to the Monks of St. John, Clerkenwell, and was, even after the dissolution of that priory, so much resorted to, that in the time of Oliver Cromwell the use of it was prohibited, as a medium of superstition, and the well closed up by <hi rend=italics>protectorial</hi> authority. In consequence the place lost its celebrity, and lay dormant till a person named Forcer, took the premises, and opened what was then called a music-house, where concerts were performed. It is most probable, but of this we are not positively informed, that it was also a tea-house, something like Bagnigge Wells, or White Conduit House, in the neighbourhood. Forcer's son added rope-dancing, tumbling, &amp;c. to the music and singing; and in process of time, Sadler took the premises, made it a more regular place of entertainment, and gave it the name of Sadler's Wells, which indicates that the waters of the well were then given gratis to those who frequented the amusements. But it does not appear certain that Sadler charged a price for seeing the performances, but rather, that all those who came to the house for refreshments were admitted to them gratis. Rosamon succeeded Sadler, and introduced a still more regular character of entertainments, and to every <num value="1">one</num> of the audience he gave a ticket, which entitled the person who possessed it to a pint of wine, or punch, for sixpence; and it is said that he sold in this way an immense quantity of wine; and perhaps the pleasure of enjoying so exhilarating a beverage at so trifling a rate, induced numbers to frequent the entertainments. Rosamon had a partner, whose name at this instant we do not recollect, who left his share to his widow, upon condition, that if she married she was to forfeit her interest in the theatre to Rosamon; she incurred the forfeiture, and thus Rosamon became sole proprietor; but having bad success for a season or <num value="2">two</num>, he sold part of the concern to Mr. Arnold, a goldsmith; and some time after sold the remainder of his property in it to King, the celebrated comedian, and Serjeant, the King's trumpeter; it was then <num value="1">first</num> made a regular theatre: dances, burlettas, and pantomimes, were introduced; though rope-dancing and tumbling were continued. King sold out to Wroughton, the actor; and the then firm, being Wroughton, Arnold, and Serjeant, applied to parliament, for an act to secure to them a monopoly of pantomime; it passed the House of Commons, but was thrown out in the Lords, it is said, through the interference of Lord Thurlow, then Chapcellor. 
<P>King and Serjeant sold out soon after, and the new proprietors were the late Mr. Siddons, a quarter; the late Mr. Hughes, proprietor of the Weymouth, Exeter, Plymouth Dock, Dartmouth, and several other provincial theatres, a quarter; the aforesaid Mr. Arnold, a quarter; Mr. Wroughton, an <num value="8">eighth</num>; and a Mr. Coates, a tanner at Bermondsy, an <num value="8">eighth</num>. A Mr. Lonsdale, originally a calico pattern cutter, and a man of great theatrical genius, was engaged by them to write pieces, invent the pantomimes, &amp;c. and to manage the stage; and the Theatre flourished under his management till about the year <datestruct value="1800"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>, when it declined from some circumstance or other, and Mr. Lonsdale resigning, was succeeded by Mr. C. Dibdin, jun.; but still for <num value="3">three</num> years the theatre kept in a declining state, which induced the proprietors to rebuild the audience part, and dispose of their property in it: the new proprietors were, the aforementioned Mr. Hughes, Mr. C. Dibdin, jun. Mr. T. Dibdin, the late Mr. Reeve, the composer; Mr. Andrews, the scene-painter; and Messrs. Barfoot and Yarnold, private gentlemen. The aquatic exhibitions were now introduced, rope-dancing, tumbling, &amp;c. exploded, and every pains taken to bring the theatre nearer to a level with the regular theatres. Mr. C. Dibdin was the author and stage manager, Mr. Reeve the composer, and Mr. Andrews the painter; and under this triumvirate the theatre flourished; and has generally proved a nursery for the Theatres Royal. Messrs. Yarnold and Andrews sold out some time since, and at present the firm is Messrs. C. and T. Dibdin and Barfoot, with the widow of Mr. Hughes and the daughter of the late Mr. Reeve. This theatre has been a lucrative concern, though the season of <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct> had been bad on account of the various public spectacles, which injured all places of amusement; but upon the decline of these, the usual attraction of the theatre predominated. <num value="1">One</num> feature this theatre has, different from all others: the proprietors are extremely anxious to construct the entertainments so that the most delicate or modest may have no occasion to blush; and that the junior branches of society may not be shocked, or the senior disgusted, with the infamous behaviour of loose women, they take every care to exclude this class of public nuisances from the theatre, and by care and resolution they have so far succeeded, that such characters are rarely to be seen there; the consequence is, that the respectable part of the community more frequently carry their children to Sadler's Wells than to any other place of amusement. The aim of the proprietors is to have the performances more classical and rational than the other minor theatres, and the theatre certainly bears a much more imposing character than it ever before did. It is the oldest minor theatre in London, having been on the same spot, and licensed, above a century; and is the only theatre in London, <num value="1">one</num> excepted, that was never burnt down. 
<P>The following are the dimensions of the interior of this theatre: Across from wall to wall, <num value="50">50</num> feet in the clear. Depth of the stage, from the orchestra to the back wall, <num value="74">74</num> feet. Across from box to box, <num value="33">33</num> feet. Height of the proscenium, <num value="23">23</num> feet. Orchestra, <num value="33">33</num> feet by <num value="6">6</num>. From the orchestra to back of the pit, <num value="47">47</num> feet. <hi rend=italics>Reservoir</hi> (for the aquatic spectacles), in length <num value="90">90</num> feet, breadth <num value="30">30</num> feet. Lower tank, <num value="90">90</num> feet by <num value="36">36</num>; upper ditto, <num value="15">15</num> feet square by <num value="5">5</num> feet. Leather hose, <num value="4">4</num> inches calibre, that can be conveyed to any part of the theatre with the greatest ease. The water is always on the main, from which a large bore is laid from the steam engine, which fills the tank in <num value="26">twenty-six</num> hours, and rises a perpendicular height <num value="37">37</num> feet, to the top of the house. 
<P>The view which we have given of Sadler's Wells, from an original painting by Mr. Andrews, exhibits its beautiful situation on the banks of the New River, comprehending, in perspective, the house of Mrs. Hughes; the entrances to the boxes, pit, and gallery; and in the distance, the residence of Mr. C. Dibdin, manager.

<P>This most elegant and superb building, which would have done honour to Greece at its most splendid period of taste and magnificence, was built after the model of the Pantheon at Rome, and opened as a place of public entertainment for concerts, balls, masquerades, &amp;c. <datestruct VALUE="1772-04-28"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=28>28th</day>, <year reg=1772>1772</year></datestruct>. The architect was Mr. Wyatt, who gained considerable reputation by the way in which he finished his undertaking. 
<P>The proprietors embraced every opportunity to engage the most celebrated performers, both vocal and instrumental, in order to render it worthy the notice of the numerous votaries of fashion and pleasure that resorted to it in throngs; and, for a considerable length of time, it continued a formidable rival to the Italian Opera and Ranelagh, and on many occasions took the lead of both. 
<P>In the year <datestruct value="1776"><year reg="1776">1776</year></datestruct>, the proprietors ventured to engage a celebrated female Italian singer, named Lorenza Agujari, generally denominated <hi rend=italics>the Agujari</hi>, at the enormous salary of <num value="100">ONE HUNDRED</num> POUNDS A NIGHT, for singing <num value="2">two</num> songs only! and yet, however exorbitant the demand, or imprudent the compliance with it may seem, the managers have since involved the proprietors in disgrace and ruin, by going a more economical way to work; indeed, in subsequent undertakings, they have more frequently had money to pay than receive; for, notwithstanding so much was disbursed to the <hi rend=italics>Agujari</hi>, much was likewise cleared, and the dividend was more considerable than it has ever been since that memorable era. 
<P>After the departure of Agujari, for the <num value="2">second</num> and last time, the managers of the Pantheon engaged the Georgi, a young singer, afterwards married to Banti, the dancer, as her successor&mdash;a measure adopted merely on speculation. She was the daughter of a <hi rend=italics>gondoliere</hi> at Venice, and for some time a piazza performer in that city. After this exercise of her natural vocal powers, she sung her way to Lyons, where she performed in coffee-houses for such small donations as are usually bestowed on itinerant talents in such places. Hence, by the power of song, she was conveyed and <hi rend=italics>bien nourrie</hi> to Paris, where her voice was so much admired, that, after very little teaching by some of her countrymen, whom she met with there, she was permitted to sing at the <hi rend=italics>Concert Spirituel.</hi> Here the applause was so loud, that it soon reached England, and inclined the proprietors of the Pantheon to engage her for <num value="3">three</num> seasons, upon condition that <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> a year should be deducted out of her salary, for the payment of an able master to cultivate her voice. Sacchini was the <num value="1">first</num> appointed to this office, but soon found her so idle and obstinate, that he quitted her as an incurable patient. She was next assigned to Signor Piozzi, whose patience was likewise exhausted before she became a perfect singer.<NOTE N="*"><P>&ldquo;Abel, after these unsuccessful trials, took her in hand, and, in pure love for her voice and person, gave her instruction at his lodgings in the country, which being then at <hi rend=italics>Fulham</hi>, gave occasion to <num value="1">one</num> of her countrymen, who had long tried in vain to find Abel in town, to say, that he despaired of ever meeting with him, for he was always going to Foolish.&rdquo;&mdash;Banti died at Bologna, <datestruct VALUE="1806-03-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> <month reg="03">March</month> <year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>. She caught cold upon her return from the Carnival at Venice, which brought on a fever, of which she died in a few days.</NOTE>
After her return to her own country, where the air is more favourable to good singing than in any other, she improved, by example, perhaps, more than precept; so much, that she was frequently employed as <num value="1">first</num> woman in the operas of the principal cities of Italy&mdash;an honour to which she was well entitled, if an old adage of that country is true, that &ldquo;there are a <num value="100">hundred</num> requisites necessary to make a good singer, of which, whoever is gifted with a fine voice, has <num value="99">ninety-nine</num>.&rdquo; 
<P>The Pantheon gradually sunk in the public estimation, and was only occasionally used for benefit concerts and masquerades; but, being admirably calculated for showy exhibitions, it was let out to various speculators, among whom, were Lunardi, Walter Clagget, &amp;c. &amp;c. Lunardi and his cat drew vast numbers of visitors; and Clagget's musical apparatus had its day: mathematical and electrical experiments were likewise tried, but never continued in any <num value="1">one</num> way beyond a season. In the year <datestruct value="1788"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct> it was fitted up and established as an Opera House or Theatre, in which character it continued till the year <datestruct value="1792"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>, when it was destroyed by fire; soon after this accident it was rebuilt for masquerades, concerts, &amp;c. and continued so until the year <datestruct value="1812"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, when it was rebuilt by Mr. Cundy as an Opera House, upon the model or design of the theatre at Milan, and is most admirably constructed for sight and sound. It contains <num value="175">175</num> boxes, with a pit <num value="60">60</num> feet wide, by <num value="60">60</num> feet deep&mdash;the stage is <num value="90">90</num> feet by <num value="75">75</num>&mdash;the interior is decorated in an elegant manner; the whole forming a spacious and superb theatre, not inferior to any in Europe, and is now <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> ornaments to the metropolis of the British empire. 
<P>The paintings and decorations which ornament the interior are admirably executed; that on the ceiling represents the throne of Apollo, as the god of harmony, and the planet who rules the whole creation. The artist has taken his subject from Ovid's Metamorphoses, lib. ii. v. <num value="30">30</num>.

<P>We have been particular in the description of the above embellishments, having received the account from the gentleman who made the designs, and executed the paintings. 
<P>The Pantheon, notwithstanding its central situation, has never yet answered the expectations of the various persons who have from time to time speculated to bring it into notice and repute as a permanent place of public entertainment. Nor is it likely that, while the patentees of the already licensed theatres in the metropolis have embarked such large capitals in theatrical property, can have the least influence with the ruling powers, such places as the Pantheon, the Royalty, or any minor concern, will ever obtain a power to perform the regular Drama in opposition to claims of such long standing. All possible means were attempted in <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct> to license it as an English Opera House; but Mr. Arnold having succeeded in obtaining his licence for the Lyceum Theatre for that purpose, the permission was refused, and the Pantheon has continued dormant ever since. In its original state it was admirably calculated for public exhibitions, masquerades, and musical performances; and it is greatly to be regretted the proprietors had not fitted it up more for the latter purpose than any other, as the prevailing taste of the public at present leads so much more to the encouragement of that science than any other of what description soever. 
<P>On the commemoration of Handel at Westminster Abbey, in the year <datestruct value="1784"><year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct>, it was found, notwithstanding the immense numbers that venerable structure would contain, it was inadequate to answer the purpose of gratifying the lovers of music, who came from all parts of the country; and, although there were <num value="3">three</num> days of performance at <num value="1">one</num> guinea per ticket each person, and <num value="3">three</num> rehearsals at half a guinea each, it was found necessary to repeat the performances at the Pantheon, which on that occasion was crowded to excess, the receipt being <datestruct value="1690--"><year reg="1690">1690</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="10">10</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> The profits arising from these musical performances were given to charitable institutions, particularly to the funds of St. George's Hospital, Hyde Park Corner, the Middlesex Hospital, to the Fund for the Support of decayed Musicians, their Widows and Children, &amp;c. &amp;c. It was reported the finances of St. George's Hospital were in such a state, that, without assistance, this laudable and charitable establishment must have fallen into entire decay. 
<P>The grand room of this building originally consisted of a large square, the <num value="4">four</num> corners being cut off by angles; on each side was a colonnade of <num value="6">six</num> Ionic columns, and <num value="6">six</num> Corinthian columns above, surmounted by a very large dome, <pb id="p.179" n="179"> with a skylight in the centre; that side nearest Oxford Street, through which the company entered, was a semicircle without the square. The orchestra occupied the opposite side, and was also a semicircle. The <num value="4">four</num> angles were occupied by <num value="4">four</num> stoves in niches in the lower part, and statues in the niches above; a number of very fine statues were also placed in niches in the semicircular entrance, particularly of His Majesty, the Queen, and Britannia, in white porphyry. The whole of the building open to the public contained a suite of <num value="14">fourteen</num> rooms.

Their Majesties for the <num value="1">first</num> time were present at this place. The band consisted of <num value="200">200</num> performers, and <datestruct value="1600--"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct> persons were present. 
<P>Burney, in his Account of the Commemoration of Handel, says, 
<P>&ldquo;This most elegant building far surpasses, in beauty, any other place appropriated to public amusements throughout Europe: it is infinitely more the wonder of foreigners than natives; and yet these, however often they may have seen it, still regard it with fresh admiration; and though it was natural to think it impossible that any thing could be added to the splendour of the structure, the original architect, Mr. James Wyatt, happily exercised his genius in preparing for the reception of Their Majesties, and effected it. 
<P>&ldquo;The east and west galleries, and the passages behind the colonnade, as well as the gallery over the orchestra, were fitted up with benches for company. Over the entrance, and opposite the orchestra, was erected a gallery on <num value="6">six</num> Ionic pillars; in the centre of the gallery was placed Their Majesties' box, lined with crimson satin, and ornamented with looking-glasses, crimson damask curtains, with the royal supporters in gold, &amp;c. &amp;c.&rdquo;

At <num value="7">seven</num> in the morning a lady called for &ldquo;God save the King,&rdquo; which was sung and encored TWICE, accompanied by the band.

A new room was built at the back of the stage, for the scene painters, when converted into a Theatre. In this room the fire broke out, and it being locked up, the watchmen did not discover it for some time. The whole of the Theatre, scenery, dresses, &amp;c. was consumed, but scarcely any of the adjoining buildings were even damaged. The front building, which is almost unconnected with the Theatre, was but little damaged. The loss was estimated at <num value="60000">60,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>&mdash;only <num value="15000">15,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> was insured 
<P><datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>, The interior was rebuilt, and opened with a masquerade in April. Ashley intended to have removed his Oratorios from Covent Garden to this place; but a license was refused him by the Lord Chamberlain. 
<P>The building now assumed a totally different appearance; it was not now a Theatre, but a fancy sort of large room for music, masquerades, &amp;c. A gallery went round <num value="3">three</num> sides of the room, to which there were <num value="2">two</num> staircases; under the gallery were small recesses of boxes, similar to those at Ranelagh for supper parties of about a dozen; each box being inclosed with a painted curtain till the supper was announced, when they all ascended. Masquerades, at <num value="1">one</num> guinea, including supper and wine, and at half a guinea, with tea and coffee, and a very few concerts, were occasionally given here till <datestruct value="1810"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>. 
<P><datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, Messrs. Gedge and Bonnor put forth a prospectus of a &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>National Institution</hi> for improving the manufactures of the United Kingdom, and the arts connected therewith; for promoting the general interests of its commerce, both foreign and domestic, established in the year of the Jubilee, A.D. <datestruct value="1810"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, at the Pantheon, London.&rdquo; The prospectus stated that they had taken the Pantheon at <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct></measure> a-year. The grand saloon was <num value="125">125</num> feet long, <num value="84">84</num> feet wide, and <num value="54">54</num> high, with <num value="8">eight</num> other spacious rooms, some <num value="50">fifty</num>, some <num value="60">sixty</num> feet in length, beside convenient rooms for counting-houses, with extensive vaults, &amp;c.; the floors contained <num value="23640">23,640</num> square feet. An exhibition of every species of manufacture in every state, and every machine connected therewith&mdash;an office for mercantile information&mdash;gentlemen retired from business, who would undertake arbitrations, and arrange all partnership concerns&mdash;a general agency throughout the kingdom, and all parts of the globe&mdash;commercial chamber, comprising all London and country newspapers, pens, ink, paper, tea and coffee, and a constant correspondence with the Royal Exchange and the public offices, and quick conveyance of important news to any distant part&mdash;a benevolent fund for manufacturers, artizans, and mechanics, &amp;c. &amp;c.: the whole to be carried on by subscribers to the several classes. This was acted upon in a small degree; many subscriptions were received, and the front building was fitted up, and the rooms opened; the grand saloon was also prepared for the exhibition, but suddenly the whole scheme was dropped. This prospectus held forth such plans, that, instead of the Pantheon, it would have required a space as large as Salisbury Plain to have carried it into execution. The thing was impracticable. 
<P>Colonel Greville, who had removed his <hi rend=italics>Pic Nic</hi> to the Argyle Rooms, took the Pantheon of Gedge and Bonnor: having obtained a license from the Lord Chamberlain for music, upon a limited scale, at the Argyle Rooms, imagining he could transfer it to Oxford Street, and have another Opera House, he, in conjunction with a Mr. Cundy, a wine <pb id="p.180" n="180"> merchant, caused the interior to be once more converted into a most <hi rend=italics>superb</hi> theatre, containing <num value="173">173</num> private boxes. They soon found their error, and therefore, on <datestruct VALUE="1812-02-27"><month reg="02">Feb.</month> <day reg=27>27</day>, <year reg=1812>1812</year></datestruct>, they opened the &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Pantheon Theatre</hi>&rdquo; at Opera prices, with Italian burlettas and ballets; they mustered a very strong company&mdash;Bertinotti Radicati, Cauvini, Collini, Signor Fischer, Rovedino, Morelli, Bertini, &amp;c. singers; The present Miss Stephens was a subordinate singer here. Leader, Spagnioletti&mdash;Scenery, Marinari&mdash;Composer, Trento&mdash;Ballet-master, Rossi&mdash;the ornaments by Signor Aglio&mdash;and a suitable ballet establishment. Notwithstanding this very strong company, and a determination and exertion of a number of the nobility to make this the fashionable rival to the Opera House, it failed almost immediately, and closed on the <datestruct VALUE="-03-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>. Another night was announced for the <datestruct VALUE="-05-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, but it did not open. Greville shortly after very luckily got out of the concern, leaving Cundy the ostensible proprietor, though many of the nobility were in fact proprietors, having advanced money for their boxes; and also a number of tradesmen, who had accepted boxes instead of payment of their accounts. Thus were nearly <num value="50000">50,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> which the Theatre cost, expended foolishly; but it happened to be of other people's money, who will never get a penny back. 
<P><datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, <datestruct VALUE="-07-23"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=23>23</day></datestruct>, another attempt was made to open it as an English Opera House, with The Cabinet and the Deserter, and on the <datestruct VALUE="-08-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, an information was laid against Cundy and the performers, by Mr. Raymond of the English Opera House, and Martindale of the Lord Chamberlain's Office: when the matter was heard at Marlborough Street, Mash, the Lord Chamberlain's head clerk, avowed the information was laid by direction of the Lord Chamberlain. Cundy was convicted in <num value="9">nine</num> penalties of <num value="50">50</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> each; and, on his giving notice of appeal at the quarter sessions, was informed an information would be laid for every performance. Hill, the stage-manager (who lately died in Jamaica), and several performers, were also convicted in <num value="50">50</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> penalties, but none of them were ever exacted; a few weeks terminated their season. The Theatre was considerably too large, and the expenses too great for such an undertaking. In the following December (<num value="27">27th</num>) it was again opened for ballets, pantomimes, &amp;c. upon a very inferior scale, and lasted only <num value="3">three</num> weeks. Italian operas were then advertised to commence in a fortnight, but did not. The prices now were&mdash; boxes, <num value="5">5</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>; pit, <num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>; gallery, <num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>; with <num value="2">second</num> price at half-past <num value="9">nine</num>&mdash;boxes, <num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>; pit <num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>; gallery, <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure>

Every door, seat, even nails, were drawn, and the whole of the pit taken up, floor and all; they fetched under <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> and the sale lasted <num value="4">four</num> days: Cundy had for some time been out of the way. 
<P><datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, The Duke of Norfolk, on the <datestruct VALUE="-04-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, presented in the House of Lords a petition from Nicholas Wilcox Cundy, for leave to bring in a bill to act the regular Drama at the Pantheon, stating its establishment in <datestruct value="1791--"><year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>, being burnt in <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>, his purchase of Greville, with the transfer to him, and refusal to license by the Lord Chamberlain; leave was given, and no more heard of it. 
<P><datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>, Mr. Elliston was in treaty, and nearly concluded an engagement of the building, which was most fortunately for him broken off; for the place is too large even for a regular opera establishment. <pb id="p.181" n="181">

<P>This Theatre commenced building in the year <datestruct value="1802"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, by removing <num value="11">eleven</num> old ruinous houses, formerly part of the estate of the Earls of Bedford, near which their mansion was situated, with the Convent Garden behind it. There is an ancient well on the premises, as fine a spring as any in the county of Middlesex; and several silver coins of Elizabeth's reign were found in digging the foundation. 
<P>The estate was purchased, the land-tax redeemed, and the Theatre wholly built from its foundation by Mr. John Scott, resident in the neighbourhood, out of his own private fortune, unaided by subscription or loan, at an expense of <measure value="25000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="25000">25,000</num></measure>; and was opened on the <datestruct VALUE="1806-11-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, under an annual licence of the Lord Chamberlain, to commence and end in the month of October. 
<P>The entertainments during that season consisted of a mechanical and optical exhibition, with songs, recitations, imitations, and various interludes. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>, <datestruct VALUE="-11-14"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=14>14</day></datestruct>, the House opened for its <num value="2">second</num> season, with an address to Hope, written and spoken by Miss Scott, daughter of the proprietor, then a very young lady; but who possessed an uncommon taste and genius for dramatic poetry, music, and the stage. 
<P>Mr. Giroux, a dancing-master of celebrity, with part of his family, and about <num value="30">thirty</num> of his pupils and apprentices, joined this concern, and several ballets were produced under their direction. 
<P>This season Miss Scott's dramatic genius produced a melo-drama, called Ulthona, the Sorceress, in which she performed herself; the music was composed by Mr. Holst, and it had a run of <num value="60">sixty</num> nights. Her <num value="2">second</num> production was a burletta, The Magistrate, equally prosperous. 
<P>During every succeeding season the concern has been well supported, with entire new and successful pieces, and a great influx of audience; the dramatic company also being enlarged the stage was found to be much too contracted for the business of the Theatre. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, immediately on its close in the month of April, the whole of the south end next the Strand, was taken down, all the interior removed, and <num value="26">26</num> feet added to the length of the Theatre; of which <num value="15">15</num> feet were given to the stage, and <num value="11">11</num> feet to the audience part; <num value="12">twelve</num> additional boxes were added; the front house next the Strand was purchased, and a new and handsome entrance made. This was completed in about <num value="7">seven</num> months, at an expense of <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5000</num></measure>, and the Theatre re-opened on Monday, <datestruct VALUE="-12-26"><month reg="12">December</month> the <day reg=26>26th</day></datestruct>, in the same year. 
<P>The structure is most advantageously situated, either for a winter or summer Theatre, being in the best part of the Strand, nearly opposite the Adelphi. 
<P>The particulars of the house are as follow: from the front next the Strand to the back of the stage, depth <num value="183">183</num> feet, <num value="40">40</num> feet wide, and <num value="55">55</num> feet high from the foundation. Under the pit, which is elevated <num value="10">10</num> feet above the foundation, is a convenient range of <num value="6">six</num> dressing-rooms; under the stage, a green or waiting room, and another for the band. 
<P>The pit ranges entirely under the boxes, and is rather out of proportion large; it holds upwards of <num value="800">800</num> persons: there are <num value="29">twenty-nine</num> boxes, in <num value="2">two</num> tiers, which will contain, in sitting and standing room, <num value="460">460</num> persons. 
<P>The building contains but <num value="1">one</num> gallery, which will hold <num value="560">560</num> persons. So that, by calculation, the house, at the present prices of boxes <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>, pit <num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>, gallery <num value="1">1</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>, on a very full night, will hold about <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure>. 
<P>There is a large and convenient room for scene-painting, <num value="40">40</num> feet by <num value="36">36</num>, and <num value="5">five</num> cisterns for water in the top, supplied by a hydraulic pump from the well in the bottom. 
<P>The foot-lights, now adopted in many of the other houses, were <num value="1">first</num> introduced here. The advantage is, they light the stage without obstructing the sight of the audience from the pit. <pb id="p.182" n="182"> 
<P>In the summers of <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>, in consequence of the alteration and enlargement of the stage, <num value="50">fifty</num> new suits of scenery were painted. 
<P>The whole of this property, now in the possession of its original proprietor, is freehold, and unincumbered by renters or annuitants. 
<P>The following new and original dramas have been wholly written by Miss Scott, none of which having been published, of course remain stock pieces, the property of this Theatre, and cannot be performed elsewhere, unless by permission, viz.:

<P>Previous to the erection of any building on this spot, Philip Astley, father of the present proprietor, having hired the ground for equestrian performances, in the year <datestruct value="1774"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>, put up a few deal boards in front of the road, and commenced his exhibition of feats of horsemanship, assisted by the music of a drum and <num value="2">two</num> fifes. The price of admission to the space without the railing of the ride was sixpence, and the horsemanship was relieved occasionally by tumbling and other agility of the body, the <num value="1">first</num> clown to which was a person named Porter, who continued with Mr. Astley several seasons. The novelty of the entertainment drew a vast concourse of spectators, and the road on that side the way was impassable in the afternoon (the performances being in the daytime), from the number of children and others that attended to get a peep at the exhibition through the apertures of the deal partition. The success of his <num value="1">first</num> season enabled Mr. Astley to inclose more conveniently his ride, and assisted by a slight covering he commenced his evening amusements, consisting of the Liliputian World, or Chinese Shadows, transparent fireworks, horsemanship, slack-rope vaulting, tumbling, Polanders' tricks, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. In the mornings, the Amphitheatre was used as a riding-school; and Mr. Astley met with great encouragement from the nobility and gentry as a riding-master, the knowledge of which art he acquired when a light-horseman in General Elliot's regiment. 
<P>Mr. Astley, jun., as a boy, was an excellent rider, but was by no means so successful on the stage, where he, until within these few years, performed in pieces of serious action. Mrs. Astley from her infancy was a very successful exhibitor on horseback, and was for many seasons the heroine of the serious pantomimes. 
<P>In <datestruct VALUE="1792-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>, Mr. John Horner, head carpenter, was killed by an explosion of gunpowder used in preparing some fireworks, which buried him in the ruins. 
<P><datestruct VALUE="1794-08-17"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=17>17</day>, <year reg=1794>1794</year></datestruct>. In the morning the Theatre and <num value="19">nineteen</num> adjoining houses were destroyed by fire. The horses alone were saved. 
<P><datestruct VALUE="1800-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>. John Astley married Miss Hannah Waldo Smith. 
<P><datestruct VALUE="1803-09-2"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=2>2</day>, <year reg=1803>1803</year></datestruct>. About half-past <num value="2">two</num> in the morning, the Theatre with nearly <num value="40">forty</num> houses was consumed by fire: everything was lost except the horses. But the most distressing circumstance was the loss of Mrs. Woodham, Mrs. Astley's mother. She was seen at the <num value="2">two</num> pair of stairs window of the dwelling-house in front, and a ladder was raised to extricate her. She appeared to intimate she had forgot something; which, it is conjectured, was the receipts of the <num value="2">two</num> previous nights' performance (left in her care), and retreated for it, and almost immediately returned to the window; but the very instant she appeared, the floor fell in, and she was lost. This lady was about <num value="60">sixty</num> years of age, came out at Covent Garden Theatre, <datestruct VALUE="1770-01-17"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=17>17</day>, <year reg=1770>1770</year></datestruct>, as Rosetta, in Love in a Village, in which she was very successful, and continued performing at that theatre <num value="2">two</num> seasons. She was a pupil of Dr. Arne, and being uncommonly elegant in dress and person, was generally called BUCK Spencer. Miss Spencer afterwards sung at Mary-le-bone Gardens, then went to Ireland, and was a great favourite there many years. She married a Mr. Smith, and afterwards a Mr. Woodham. The neighbouring houses destroyed and damaged, being inhabited by persons of the lower class, who lost their all, occasioned great distress among them. The fire broke out in the lamp-room, occasioned by some sparks from the fireworks used on the previous night falling on the tow. The loss in the Theatre was estimated at <num value="30000">30,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>, of which only <num value="5000">5000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> was insured. 
<P>Mrs. Astley, sen., died a week previous, and Mr. Astley, sen., was a prisoner of war in France, where he went during the very short peace to look after his property, he having a theatre in Paris. On the <num value="17">17th</num> of the same month, Astley was permitted, on the score of ill health, to go to Piedmont, from which place he contrived to escape down the Maine, from thence towards the Rhine, and to Husum, where he <num value="1">first</num> heard of the loss of his wife and his Theatre. 
<P>The present Theatre was immediately built; is <num value="140">140</num> feet long and <num value="65">65</num> wide in the auditory part, and <num value="130">130</num> feet wide behind the curtain; a width very necessary for the horse spectacles which are here exhibited in their proper place. <pb id="p.184" n="184"> It is lighted by a centre chandelier of <num value="50">50</num> patent lamps, and <num value="16">16</num> chandeliers round the house. The new Theatre was announced <hi rend=italics>Astley's Royal Amphitheatre of Arts</hi>, under the patronage of their Royal Highnesses the PRINCE OF WALES and DUKE OF YORK; the words <hi rend=italics>of Arts</hi> have been lately omitted. 
<P>An annual prize has been given, for near <num value="20">twenty</num> years, of a wherry, to be rowed for by watermen, in honour of His Majesty's birthday. This fully answers the purposes intended; it shows the giver's loyalty, and brings a full house to witness the successful candidate receiving his prize, which is given him in the Theatre, when &ldquo;God save the King&rdquo; is sung by the whole company. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, the season commenced at the usual time (Easter) under the firm of Astley, Davis, and Parker; the partnership was for <num value="7">seven</num> seasons, and terminated a few weeks back (<datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>). During this period, the horse spectacles on the stage have been brought to the highest perfection, and those seasons, with some trifling exceptions, have been more profitable than any preceding ones. 
<P>Mr. Astley, sen., died at Paris, <datestruct VALUE="1814-09-20"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=20>20</day>, <year reg=1814>1814</year></datestruct>, of the gout in his stomach, aged <num value="73">73</num> years, and the Theatre became the property of his son. Mr. Astley published some books on horsemanship, and Memoirs of his own life. The late Mrs. Astley appeared on horseback on the Drury Lane stage in the Jubilee, <datestruct value="1786--"><year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Within these <num value="2">two</num> years, another accident happened at this Theatre: a neighbour (a sadler) was killed by a stag which was exhibited, and which he was playing with <num value="1">one</num> morning in the stables. 
<P>The progressive improvement in the performances at this Theatre, may be judged from the following extract of an advertisement of the exhibitions here in the year <datestruct value="1780"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, shortly after its <num value="1">first</num> establishment as an enclosed Theatre for evening entertainments: &ldquo;Astley's Amphitheatre Riding House, Westminster Bridge. This and every evening, will be presented the following pleasing amusements, with many new additions never exhibited in London. Doors to be opened at half past <num value="5">five</num>, to begin at half past <num value="6">six</num> o'clock precisely. Admittance.

Scene I. A curious Opera Dancer, with all the new Attitudes in a comic Dance called the Dutch Woman. Scene II. The Dock Yard, with a Representation of the several Artists at work on a large Ship, to conclude with a Song on Admiral Rodney's Victory over the Spaniards, by Mr. Connel. Scene III. The Lion Catchers. Scene IV. The Broken Bridge, with a Song by Mr. Wilkinson. Scene V. The Duck Hunters. Scene VI. The Storm, &amp;c. The whole of the above exhibition to conclude with a Hornpipe, in a most extraordinary manner. Between the acts of the Chinese Shadows, will be presented an exhibition called the Theatre of Florence, representing several frontispieces of beautiful fireworks, which have been displayed in different parts of Europe. Part III. Horsemanship on a single Horse, by Mr. Griffin, Mr. Jones, Mr. Miller, &amp;c. Part IV. Tumbling and other agility of body, by Mr. Nevit, Mr. Porter, Mr. Dawson, Mr. Garmon. Clown, Mr. Burt. Part V. Horsemanship on <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="3">three</num> horses, in a manner truly entertaining. Part VI. Slack Rope Vaulting on full swing in different attitudes. Part VII. Polanders' Tricks on Chairs, Ladders, &amp;c. Part VIII. The Clown on Horseback, with several parts of Horsemanship burlesqued. Part IX. The Taylor riding on the Dancer, the Hunter, and Road Horse. The whole to conclude with the amazing performance of Men piled on Men, or the Egyptian Pyramids.&rdquo; 
<P>All sorts of phenomena have been exhibited here; a lady with hair that lay several feet on the ground walked round the ring attended with candles by Mr. Astley, sen.; very short and tall men and women, particularly a Dutch dwarf, Wybrand Lolkes, from Aelst, in West Friesland; grimaciers, the monstrous craws, Cherokees, Indian chiefs, Catabaws, dancing dogs, and the wonderful monkey, General Jacko. 
<P>The representation of the Bastile was a very early stage representation here; and so extremely imperfect was it, that caricatures were put forth in the magazines of the performance, with a man bringing on a banner, stating, &ldquo;This is a draw-bridge;&rdquo; an explanation often necessary to stage representation at that period. 
<P>Mr. Astley for many years explained the different exhibitions to the audience; and not being gifted with the happiest orthography, gave great delight to the Gallery and Pit, and afforded ample scope for several successful mimicking imitators. Shortly after its establishment, the Riding House title was dropped, and it was called <placename>The Royal Grove</placename>, or <placename>Astley's Amphitheatre</placename>. <pb id="p.185" n="185">

<P>This Theatre is built on the site of His Majesty's late Concert Rooms for Ancient Music, <num value="1">first</num> suggested and established by the late Earl of Sandwich, under the sanction of the King, and after honoured in bearing the name of his Rooms. Their Majesties several times visited the musical performances at this place; but it being found too small and inconveniently situated to accommodate the numerous subscribers, the Hanover Square Rooms were engaged, and the Ancient Concerts for many years have been performed there. 
<P>Hyde the Trumpeter afterwards rented these premises, and they were called Hyde's Rooms, for Concerts. On his quitting them they were untenanted for some time, and very much out of repair, when Colonel Greville engaged them, fitted them up in an elegant manner, and instituted his celebrated PIC NIC Society, which made so much noise and glee among the fashionable world, that it was thought it would considerably hurt the regular theatres; indeed, so much so, that the proprietors of the <num value="2">two</num> winter houses interfered, and endeavoured to stop their performances; however, the Dilettanti opened under a sort of agreement with Sheridan and Richardson, that not more than <num value="10">ten</num> representations should take place each season, and no hired performers of any existing theatre to act in them. The parts to be acted BONA FIDE by ladies and gentlemen, and to be inserted on their cards, &ldquo;With Consent of the Proprietors of the established Winter Theatres.&rdquo; Such an agreement was assented to and hastily signed by Col. Greville, who immediately after withdrew his signature. Their motto was, &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>On fait ce qu'on peut, et non ce qu'on veut</hi>&rdquo;&mdash;We do what we can, but not what we wish. They commenced on the <datestruct VALUE="1802-03-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, with a prologue by Greville, and an interlude, written by and principally acted by himself, founded on the difficulty and opposition he had experienced in forming the society; and <num value="2">two</num> French proverbs, Zing Zing and Les Foux, acted by French people. The company then retired to the refreshment-rooms, and the audience part of the Theatre was in a few minutes converted into a supper room, for the audience to return and partake of a cold collation. After supper catches and glees were introduced, accompanied by a grand pianoforte; and the company departed about half-past <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock. The subscription for the season was <num value="5">five</num> guineas, and in lieu of PIC NIC <num value="1">one</num> guinea, with <num value="6">six</num> bottles of wine for the season, half white, half red, no wine being allowed to be sold on the premises: the subscription to be paid to Messrs. Coutts and Co. The Society continued here for some time, and several full plays were acted, occasionally assisted by actresses and actors from the winter houses. Captain Sowden, who went up in the balloon with Garnerin, and compared Epping Forest to a gooseberry-bush, was Greville's official man in the stage direction. Sowden was the same who, in <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, appeared at the Haymarket Theatre by the name of Stapleton, in Dennis Brulgruddery, and afterwards engaged by the Drury Lane Company at the Lyceum, and in both instances completely failed. Richard Choyee Sowden, alias Stapleton, died in <datestruct VALUE="1811-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, at Islington, in the <num value="31">thirty-first</num> year of his age. He was a man of singular eccentric habits, had been a captain in the navy, and driven to the stage by necessity, after squandering away his property, having at <num value="21">twenty-one</num> inherited <measure value="6000l." type=currency><num value="6000">six thousand</num> pounds</measure>. 
<P>In the year <datestruct value="1808"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>, Saunders (the father of Master Saunders, the rider) fitted up the interior of this place in a very temporary manner, and opened it for horse-riding principally, but had some trifling stage performances, which was attended by very low company, and lasted but for a short period, though he made every possible exertion to fill his house, by parading the whole troop of performers through the streets and squares of the neighbourhood daily. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, Mr. J. Paul, a pawnbroker in Upper Mary-le-bone Street, who had made some property by his business (solely for the purpose of gratifying his wife's ambition to perform, and for which she was but very indifferently qualified), took the Rooms on lease, pulled down the fittings--up within the walls, built an elegant little Theatre, adorned the outside, erected a portico to the entrances, and opened with Love in a Village, as a burletta, contrary to Act of Parliament, Mrs. Paul playing Rosetta. A very few weeks terminated their career, and Paul became a bankrupt. 
<P>The Theatre was afterwards let to several speculating managers; and some tradesmen who had been for many years <pb id="p.186" n="186"> respectably situated in business, were infatuated enough to embark in this ruinous concern, and lost their all: among whom ranked as the chief, Mr. Spragg, printer; and Mr. Cooke, the dyer and hot-presser: the latter of whom did not long survive the misfortunes he had entailed on himself. 
<P>Penley, the brother of the late actor of Drury Lane, was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> adventurers that engaged the place after Paul's failure, but with very little success, commensurate with his expectation. Of the Drury Lane Penley, an anecdote is at present in circulation, of rather a singular nature. The late Mr. Raymond, with several of his brother comedians (among whom was Mr. Penley), having, about <num value="2">two</num> years since, made a party to enjoy a day at Greenwich, previous to dinner amused themselves in the Park, and among other diversions of the mimic party, a sham duel was proposed, and performed: in which it was Mr. Raymond's part to fall; Mr. Penley was appointed to the office of sham undertaker; but afterwards, quitting the stage, and commencing the business of an upholsterer and real undertaker, performed in earnest that last office to his departed brother actor and friend, Mr. Raymond, on Sunday, <datestruct VALUE="1817-10-28"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=28>28th</day>, <year reg=1817>1817</year></datestruct>, when the latter was buried in the churchyard of St. Paul, Covent Garden, attended to the grave by his theatrical brethren of both houses, in thirtyfive mourning coaches, a cavalcade of <num value="13">thirteen</num> private carriages closing the procession. 
<P>The season in which the Regency Theatre most prospered was when Cobham (afterwards of Sadler's Wells and the Surrey Theatre) performed the parts of Marmion, and Gloucester, in Jane Shore, both of which pieces brought crowded houses. Indeed, this gentleman's performance of Marmion attracted such notice, that it is said Mr. Kemble, who purposely went to see him play the part, gave his opinion, that, had his figure been equal to his conception, action, and delivery, he would have become <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest ornaments to the stage.<NOTE N="*"><P>It is truly surprising to see the blindness and want of judgment in many of our theatrical caterers, who could so simply pass unnoticed the talent and judgment of this performer, and substitute in the place several histrionic adventurers, whose performances previously had disgraced our country barns. The melancholy beggarly accounts from empty benches, and subsequent losses, too evidently bear testi mony to the truth of this remark.</NOTE> But even Cobham did not possess the power to draw sufficient company beyond a season; and the novelty ceasing, the Regency fell into decay. 
<P>Mrs. Powell, formerly of Drury Lane and Covent Garden Theatres, who on several occasions had successfully been (in both those Theatres) a substitute for Mrs. Siddons, condescended to appear on these boards; and Fitzwilliam, the present favourite of the Surrey Theatre, is indebted to the Regency Theatre for his <num value="1">first</num> introduction to a London audience. The confined scale, however, of the establishment, prevented any manager from securing long the service of a favourite actor; none of which ever considered the Regency engagement otherwise than a prelude to better situations, of which they invariably availed themselves with the <num value="1">first</num> convenient opportunity. 
<P><datestruct VALUE="1814-12-5"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=5>5</day>, <year reg=1814>1814</year></datestruct>, the lease was sold by auction by Robins; the only bidders were, Watson, the Cheltenham manager, and Beverley, formerly of Covent Garden Theatre, in a minor department. Beverley made the <num value="1">first</num> bidding, <num value="50">fifty</num> guineas, which the assignees would have gladly accepted, and, rather than not have got rid of it, would have presented it to any <num value="1">one</num>. They bid against each other till it was knocked down to Beverley at <num value="310">three hundred and ten</num> guineas. The conditions of sale stated the privilege of keeping open all the year, upon a magistrate's licence&mdash;the Theatre to have cost <num value="4000">4000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> upon a term of <num value="13">thirteen</num> years from Christmas, <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, at the very low rent of <num value="177">177</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>&mdash;sold by order of the assignees, and the money to be paid in <num value="3">three</num> months: it was stated that the taxes were <num value="35">35</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>, that the movable property was worth <num value="300">300</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>, and the Theatre was usually let for <num value="20">20</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> a week. 
<P>If the present occupier can possibly make it answer, it must be by reducing the expenses to a very low scale indeed, and employing the whole of his family in the concern. Their chief support is from the half price. 
<P>The entrance to the King's Ancient Concert Rooms was (prior to the converting them into a Theatre) in Pitt Street, communicating with John Street, Tottenham Court Road, and Charlotte Street, Rathbone Place. 
<P>The Committee of the Musical Fund held their meetings here; and every quarter a part of them attended, to receive the statement, and settle the claims on their establishment. All orphan children of Musicians belonging to the Fund were apprenticed from this place. The premium given is <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> pounds</measure>; and <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure> to each for working tools, &amp;c., at the expiration of their apprenticeship. <pb id="p.187" n="187">

<P>The Cobourg,<NOTE N="*"><P>The word is thus spelled in all the official documents at the Heralds' College.</NOTE> although the last erected of our present Theatres, has to boast of higher antiquity for its foundation than any, without exception, of its rival neighbours on either side the river. The marshy land, on which this fabric is erected, requiring artificial aid, the ancient palace of John a Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, called the Savoy, being taken down about the time, for the purpose of opening a communication to the Waterloo Bridge, and improving that part of the Strand, the projectors and proprietors of the then intended new Theatre contracted for a sufficient quantity of the ancient stones of which the Savoy palace was built, and had them transported in barges to the Surrey side of the river, from whence they were conveyed in wheelbarrows to the place of destination; and on those materials the superstructure of the Cobourg Theatre was raised. 
<P>It is not a century since all this part of St. George's Fields was completely inundated with water, and the health of the neighbouring inhabitants constantly endangered by the unwholesome vapours incessantly arising from the stagnated waters, only refreshed by accidental spring tides. Nothwithstanding the insalubrity of the soil, several persons of the highest consequence took up their abode in its immediate vicinity: the Bishops of Rochester had their town residence in Carlisle Lane, near the Marsh Gate; and Bonner, the well-known Bishop of London, had an establishment within a few <num value="100">hundred</num> yards of the Cobourg Theatre, which in all probability stands on some portion of that Prelate's former ground. Part of his house is still remaining, which, with some others on the opposite side of the road, exhibit curious specimens of our early building. 
<P>St. George's Fields have undergone a surprising and rapid improvement within the last <num value="30">thirty</num> years, and bid fair, through a ready communication with the metropolis by the Waterloo Bridge, to become a prosperous neighbourhood, in trade and manufacture, in the course of a very few years. At present, however, <num value="2">two</num> Theatres might have been considered sufficient to furnish amusement to the population, but the project of erecting a <num value="3">third</num>, &ldquo;the Cobourg,&rdquo; originated under the following circumstances: 
<P>A few years back Mr. Jones, the leaseholder of the Royal Circus (since called the Surrey Theatre), became insolvent, when the lease came into the hands of <num value="5">five</num> persons, his assignees: they let the house to Mr. Elliston for <num value="2200">2200</num> guineas, and <num value="3">three</num> adventurers took it at <num value="2000">2000</num> guineas after he left it, at Lady-day, <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>. <num value="1">One</num> of this latter firm died soon after, another became a bankrupt, and the <num value="3">third</num> continued until the expiration of the agreement, which was also the termination of Mr. Jones's lease, and the property reverted to the ground landlord, Temple West, Esq., who asked <measure value="4200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4200">4200</num></measure> per annum. (The old ground-rent was <num value="200">200</num> guineas). Jones, with the last renter, came forward at Lady-day, <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, hoping to obtain the Theatre, and offered <measure value="600l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="600">600</num></measure> for what had last let for <measure value="2100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2100">2100</num></measure>, and for which was now required <measure value="4200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4200">4200</num></measure> (a liberal offer!) So trifling a sum was refused, with an intimation that a proper offer would be attended to. 
<P>The license, which is from Michaelmas to Michaelmas, was held by the assignees for the lessee, and Mr. West offered them <measure value="600l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="600">600</num></measure> for the unexpired part of it. (The license could only be used at the Royal Circus.) This, however, they declined; likewise to make any further offer. They thought by holding the license to bring Mr. West to their terms; but he, applying to Parliament, obtained an Act to perform at the Royal Circus from Easter to Michaelmas, <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, although the assignees held the license for that period. The leaseholders now stripped the Circus of everything the law would allow, and had a public sale on the premises, the <datestruct VALUE="1816-03-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, when all the trumpery not worth removing was sold, with <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> menage horses, &amp;c., &amp;c.; and they immediately projected building a new Theatre, to the remaining old scenery, dresses, &amp;c. Shortly after, the following handbill was put in circulation: 
<emph>&ldquo;PROPOSALS FOR THE ROYAL COBOURG THEATRE.</emph>

<P>&ldquo;Mr. Jones, late Proprietor of the Royal Circus, having agreed for a piece of land near the foot of Waterloo Bridge, on the Surrey side, for the purpose of building a Theatre, and having obtained the patronage of Her Royal Highness <pb id="p.188" n="188"> the Princess Charlotte of Wales, and His Serene Highness the Prince of Saxe-Cobourg, proposes to dispose of a part, by way of subscription, as follows:&mdash;The whole is estimated at <measure value="12000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="12000">12,000</num></measure>. 
<P>&ldquo;A subscriber of <num value="1">one</num> <num value="8">eighth</num> of that sum to be considered a joint proprietor. 
<P>&ldquo;Subscribers for <num value="1">one</num> share of <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> to receive interest at <measure value="5l." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> pounds</measure> per cent., and each share to entitle the holder to a personal free admission, transferable each season. 
<P>&ldquo;The holder of <num value="5">five</num> shares to be eligible to be elected a trustee, and the holder of <num value="2">two</num> shares to be entitled to vote on all occasions. 
<P>&ldquo;For the present, subscriptions are received at Sir John Pinhorn and Company's, Bankers, Southwark, in the name of 
<P>&ldquo;Each subscriber to pay down <num value="25">25</num> per cent. at the time of subscribing, and <num value="25">25</num> per cent. monthly till the whole is paid. 
<P>&ldquo;As soon as <measure value="4000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4000">4000</num></measure> shall have been subscribed, a general meeting of the subscribers to be called, for the purpose of framing regulations for the government of the concern, and electing trustees, treasurers, and other officers. 
<P>&ldquo;Materials, to the amount of several <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">thousand</num> pounds</measure>, are already purchased; the whole property, in scenery, dresses, &amp;c., &amp;c., at the Surrey Theatre, has been removed to this concern; and the Theatre is intended to open at Christmas next. 
<P>&ldquo;Subscriptions are also received, and further information will be communicated, by Mr. Jones, near the Obelisk, St. George's Fields; and Mr. Chippendall, Solicitor to the Theatre, Great Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields.&rdquo; 
<P>It will very easily be believed, that, upon such a prospectus, few, if any, subscribers came forward; and that there was no cause to call the general meeting therein proposed. Mr. Jones, the former leaseholder; a Mr. Dunn, the last tenant; and Mr. Serres, the marine painter (who procured the patronage of the Prince and Princess; which patronage entirely led to the procuring the license), formed the partnership; the <num value="1">first</num>, for his former connexion with the Circus, and procuration of the ground; the <num value="2">second</num> having scenery, dresses, &amp;c., &amp;c.; and the <num value="3">third</num> for the patronage, and thereby the license. 
<P>Upon the strength of the patronage they obtained, the proprietors ventured to designate their Theatre &ldquo;Royal;&rdquo; a title that can only attach to a Theatre sanctioned by His Majesty. The license was obtained at the Quarter Sessions, <datestruct VALUE="1816-10-16"><month reg="10">Oct.</month> <day reg=16>16</day>, <year reg=1816>1816</year></datestruct>; but the work proceeded very slowly, for want of money, till the spring, <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>, when a few <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> pounds</measure>, advanced by Mr. Glossop, on the part of his son, Mr. Jos. Glossop, junior, then out of the kingdom, enabled them again to proceed, which they did till that money was expended; and on the day preceding Good Friday, <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>, the workmen struck, and carried away the scaffolding. It lay in this state until the autumn; when, Mr. Glossop having advanced money, as before stated, thought proper to make such arrangements with the above-mentioned persons (who were little more than nominally concerned), that he might complete the Theatre, which he immediately put into execution, and opened the house Whit-Monday, <datestruct VALUE="1818-05-11"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=11>11th</day>, <year reg=1818>1818</year></datestruct>.<NOTE N="*"><P>The following bill of the entertainments represented on the <num value="1">first</num> night of this Theatre's opening, is preserved to show the great variety and strength the company mustered on the occasion:&mdash;

<P>&dagger;&dagger;&dagger; The Proprietors, in order to meet the wishes and suggestions of many Noble Patrons and Friends, have appropriated the lower circles of boxes as dress boxes. The accommodation of the frequenters of the upper circle has also been paid particular attention to&mdash;a full and perfect view of the Stage is maintained&mdash;while the appropriation of a tastefully decorated Saloon, for the purpose of refreshments will, it is hoped, add to the general comfort.&mdash;Lower boxes, <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>s.</measure> Upper boxes, <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure> Pit, <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>s.</measure> Gallery, <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure>&mdash;Doors to be opened at half-past <num value="5">five</num>, to begin at half-past <num value="6">six</num>.

<P>Extra patroles are engaged for the bridge and roads leading to the Theatre, and particular attention will be paid to the lighting of the same.</NOTE> The Theatre is situated nearly in the centre of the new <pb id="p.189" n="189"> road leading from the Marsh Gate, Lambeth, to Rowland Hill's Chapel, Blackfriars Road, and immediately opposite the road from Waterloo Bridge, in the Strand. 
<P>Notwithstanding every exertion was made to get the house ready by Whitsuntide, the proprietors were necessitated to open it in a very unfinished state, and it was not completed for several weeks after. Before the performance commenced, a quarrel took place between the stage manager and the principal proprietor and director of the Theatre. The stage manager was for playing the last piece <num value="1">first</num>, and the <num value="1">first</num> last, that he might exhibit at Covent Garden Theatre, and enjoy the benefit of a double salary. They severally addressed the audience: the former, as director of the stage, insisted on commencing with the pantomime, and complained to the audience, that the director had locked up his <hi rend=italics>clown's breeches</hi>, without which he could not appear before them. After some delay the pantomime was performed <hi rend=italics><num value="1">first</num></hi>, and Mr. Norman went to Covent Garden. On the Thursday following, Mr. W. Barrymore's name appeared in the bills as the stage manager (Astley's bills at the same time, and long after, also announced Mr. W. Barrymore stage manager of their Theatre), and after the <num value="1">first</num> week, Norman was discharged as a performer. 
<P>On the <datestruct VALUE="-10-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct> a benefit was given as a commencement of a Theatrical Fund; but it must be long, very long, before this fund can benefit the subscribers; even Drury Lane and Covent Garden Funds, with their numerous and large subscriptions, and donations (and where so few claimants are likely to arise, to what may be expected here), have not until very lately been in a flourishing state: the attempt, however, is laudable, and merits every support the parties interested can afford it. The season closed on Monday, <datestruct VALUE="1818-10-12"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=12>12</day>, <year reg=1818>1818</year></datestruct>, and had been tolerably successful. When the neighbourhood is improved and extended, and the directory get more experienced in their new profession, it may perhaps answer their expectations. 
<P>The proximity of it to the Strand, Covent Garden, Fleet Street, Charing Cross, and the western part of the metropolis, gives the Cobourg Theatre a decided advantage over the other Surrey Theatres; and in proportion as the <pb id="p.190" n="190"> buildings in the Bridge road proceed to accumulate, in like proportion will the chance of success attend the Cobourg establishment. 
<P>The Theatre is very pretty, and does credit to the architect, though we think it injudicious, if they hope, and they say they do, that Prince Leopold will visit them, to place so many objects in his view to remind him of his severe loss. The Marine Saloon&mdash;of which they have said so much themselves!&mdash;will not bear criticism; winding stairs are bad, and should never be introduced where there is plenty of room (as they have here), particularly to the boxes. 
<P>There are <num value="2">two</num> tier of boxes divided into sections, adorned with elegant medallions from the antique, representing the Loves and the Graces, in imitation of cameos, on a red ground, in octangular frames, surmounted with elegant carved and gilt mouldings. 
<P><num value="8">Eight</num> private boxes are provided for the advantage of the proprietors, and <num value="4">four</num> managers' boxes are erected over the stage doors. 
<P>The principal stage box is richly adorned and canopied with crimson velvet, gold fringed, to receive and accommodate any royal visitor. 
<P>The Cobourg Theatre is in the parish of St. Mary, Lambeth. <pb id="p.191" n="191">

<P>The celebrated lyric poet, Mr. Charles Dibdin, Senior, was the <num value="1">first</num> projector of this place of amusement, about the year <datestruct value="1780"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>. Horsemanship, which had been lately brought to a pitch of perfection unknown before, was at this period much admired, having been rendered familiar to the public by the rival exhibitions of Hughes and Astley. Hughes opened his Riding School, on the Surrey side of Blackfriars Bridge, <datestruct VALUE="1772-04-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> <month reg="04">April</month> <year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, under the name of the British Horse Academy, in opposition to Astley's British Riding School, which had begun the previous May, at the Surrey side of Westminster Bridge. At this time, they both performed in the open air by daylight, if not wet weather; began at <num value="5">five</num>, and mounted at <num value="6">six</num> o'clock. The admission to the Ride was <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure>; to the Room, <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>s.</measure> They both continued until <datestruct VALUE="1773-07--"><month reg="07">July</month> <year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct>, when their exhibitions were shut up by the magistrates. Astley went on again in <datestruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct>, but Hughes never re-opened his old Riding School. This exhibition of horsemanship by Hughes <num value="1">first</num> gave the idea to Mr. Dibdin, who conceived, if it could be divested of its vulgarity, it might become an object of public encouragement and profit. His plan was to introduce all the dexterity and romantic interest of ancient chivalry, such as tournaments, running at the ring, and various other feats of equestrian celebrity, &amp;c. &amp;c. into the stage representations, and thereby to create an interest as well as desire of encouragement in the superior classes of the public. A sum of money was offered to him by friends in furtherance of this project, and a spot was fixed upon on the Surrey side of Blackfriars Bridge, for building a requisite theatre. The reversion of the ground, which was situated near the Surrey road turnpike, was vested in Colonel West, father of the present Temple West, Esq. Mr. Dibdin immediately applied to the former gentleman, who not only approved of the scheme, but instantly joined in it. He was introduced to Dibdin's friends, and the whole business of building, opening, &amp;c. was arranged in a short time: Colonel West purchased the life-interest in the premises, and became <num value="1">one</num> of the proprietors. Mr. Dibdin's intention was to open upon a small scale, at <num value="1">first</num>, to get on by degrees, and thus to avoid the jealousy of the larger theatres; but this timid management West overruled; he was for coming out at once an object of attraction, and under a proper license, which he was confident might be obtained from the Lord Chamberlain: or otherwise, that the dormant patent of Mr. Harris might be procured; but the Lord Chamberlain unfortunately had no jurisdiction in Surrey, nor could the patent have been used in that county, nor was it likely Mr. Harris should thus have set up an enemy againt himself. Both of these schemes were tried, and failed. It was afterwards arranged to open the concern under the best favourable circumstances that offered, and it was at the same time agreed, that Mr. Dibdin should be the sole manager for life (but nothing was reduced to writing), and to receive a <num value="4">fourth</num> of the profits. Hughes was to conduct the horse department, and Mr. Grimaldi (father of the present popular clown of the same name) was engaged as ballet-master. 
<P>The building, which is said to have cost nearly <num value="15000">15,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> was substantial and elegant; and appeared in all respects a place worthy of public encouragement. It was begun in <datestruct VALUE="1782-02--"><month reg="02">February</month> <year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct>, and opened <datestruct VALUE="-11-7"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=7>7</day></datestruct> in the same year, but <hi rend=italics>without</hi> a license.<NOTE N="*"><P>With this advertisement: &ldquo;<datestruct VALUE="-11-7"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=7>7</day></datestruct>, will open the Royal Circus, and Equestrian Philharmonic Academy, with a variety of entertainments, upon a plan entirely new. Feats of horsemanship, relieved by the efforts of a number of children educated in the Academy, who will perform their exercises in music, dancing, oratory, &amp;c. The Circus, dresses, decorations, and whole troops of performers, entirely new. The equestrian part conducted by Mr. Hughes. Doors open at <num value="6">Six</num>, begin at <num value="7">Seven</num>. Boxes, <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>s.</measure> Pit, <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>s.</measure> Gallery, <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure>&rdquo; 
<P>This advertisement was discontinued after the <num value="14">14th</num> of the same month: and on <datestruct VALUE="1782-12-19"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=19>19</day>, <year reg=1782>1782</year></datestruct>, the Royal Circus, and Equestrian Academy, was advertised to open under the direction of Hughes. No mention is made in this advertisement, of <hi rend=italics>children.</hi></NOTE> The magistrates closed its doors at Christmas, but it re-opened on the <datestruct VALUE="1783-03-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month> <year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>, under the usual magistrates' license. The <num value="1">first</num> drawing up of the curtain, in November, took place before a crowded and elegant audience, with a prelude followed by a grand entr&eacute;e of horses, a grand ballet (by children), &ldquo;Admetus and Alceste,&rdquo; various feats of horsemanship by Hughes's pupils, and a pantomime parody (also by children), called &ldquo;Mandarina, or the Refusal of Harlequin.&rdquo; <num value="2">Two</num> little boys (the Leanders) played the trumpet, and the performances closed with fireworks. Among the juvenile performers were Miss Romanzini (now Mrs. Bland), Miss Wilkinson (Mrs. Mountain), Miss de Camp (Mrs. C. Kemble), Mr. Russell, the Misses Simonets, Laborie, the Leanders (hornplayers,) &amp;c. 
<P>Near the commencement of the ensuing season, when the proprietors applied for the license at the quarter sessions, they were refused, and it was granted in <hi rend=italics>Hughes's</hi> name only; he having been for some time secretly working to effect this point. Soon after the opening in <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>, Colonel West died; the other proprietors (among whom was Sir John Lade) interfered, and thus commenced the disputes which ultimately destroyed the concern. At this time there were about <num value="60">sixty</num> children engaged, with a school master and mistress to attend them. The season was for <num value="5">five</num> months, and <num value="9500">9500</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> was taken during that period. 
<P>At the end of the season, Mr. Dibdin, having been expelled the management by a cabal formed against him, filed a bill in equity to ascertain his right. This occasioned a general quarrel among the parties: Hughes (who was the opponent of Dibdin, and <num value="1">one</num> of the cabal) called on that gentleman unexpectedly, and proposed to him to seize the Theatre and open it, accounting to the proprietors for their fair proportions in the concern, and at the same time promised to have Mr. Dibdin's name inserted in the next license. They accordingly took forcible possession, and publicly announced to open on Easter Monday <datestruct value="1784--"><year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct>; before which time, however, a convention took place; and it was agreed that Dibdin and Hughes should rent the Theatre at <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> a year. They opened, the receipts were great, and all went on well for about <num value="5">five</num> weeks, when they quarrelled about a scheme of Mr. Dibdin's, to bring forward a commemoration of Arne. This was the plea for Hughes to get rid of Dibdin; &ldquo;he seized the money at the door, kicked the Treasurer out of the house,&rdquo; &amp;c.; the representations were in consequence not properly conducted, the House was soon deserted by the public, and Mr. Dibdin entirely quitted the Circus, on receiving from the proprietors <num value="100">100</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> in liquidation of all his claims. 
<P>The House continued open the following summer, with but indifferent success, until the year <datestruct value="1789"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>, when the late John Palmer, comedian, became a prisoner in the King's Bench, obtained the privilege of the rules, and resided in the London Road; and entering into an agreement with a Mr. Read (who at that time held the Theatre of the proprietors, and who in <datestruct value="1791--"><year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct> published the History of the Circus, with his own case), he performed there, and conducted the performances until the <datestruct VALUE="-11-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, when the Circus was shut up, in consequence of an information laid against it by the winter Theatres. During Palmer's management the &ldquo;BASTILE&rdquo; was produced, and performed to crowded audiences <num value="79">seventy-nine</num> successive nights, chiefly through his own excellent performance of Henry in it.<NOTE N="*"><P>The public manner in which Palmer acted every night, the sums he received, and which it is said he squandered, in open defiance of his creditors, caused the clause in the next Debtors' Act, making all public houses and places of amusement, <hi rend=italics>out</hi> of the Rules.</NOTE> At the time Palmer joined it, the Theatre was fast verging towards dissolution, from gross and repeated abuses in its management, by persons without judgment or principle. 
<P>The House appears to have closed from the last mentioned period, until Easter Monday <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>; for a play-bill of that date announces, &ldquo;The Royal Circus to open for the <num value="1">first</num> time these <num value="4">four</num> years.&rdquo; The performances at that period consisted of horsemanship, by Hughes's troop from Russia, and Handy's troop; Rope-dancing, Tumbling, Balancing, <pb id="p.192" n="192"> and the Taylor riding to Brentford; but <hi rend=italics>no</hi> stage performances. The prices were, Boxes, <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure> Pit, <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>s.</measure> and Gallery, <num value="1">1</num>s In May, a pantomimic interlude was added. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>, Temple West and Jane West (his mother) let the Theatre to James Jones, for <num value="21">21</num> years, at <num value="200">200</num> guineas per annum (a pretty strong proof of the wretched state to which it had been reduced); and the next year, <datestruct value="1796"><year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>, the House having been refitted, altered, and a coffee-room added, opened under the stage management of Lascelles, a dancing-master and pantomimist. The success was, however, through the whole of that season but very indifferent; though an excellent company for such a Theatre, it must be admitted, was engaged&mdash;containing in the horse department, <num value="2">two</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> performers in the world, George Smith and Crossman; and among the stage performers, Mrs. Parker, and her daughter-in-law, Mrs. H. Johnston; the Bolognas, father and son; Mrs. Iliff; Jew Davis (as he was familiarly called in the profession); Mrs. Henley, and Mr. Pilbrow (excellent burletta performers), &amp;c. &amp;c. The next season the Circus company, who had been in Scotlaud during the winter, were augmented by the addition of the late &ldquo;Tom Blanchard&rdquo; (formerly of Covent Garden Theatre), Mrs. Herbert, afterwards a very favourite singer and performer here, and under the stage management of Mr. Cross (Lascelles having been discharged); and the pieces being judiciously got up, and in general well performed, the House by the end of the season became an established theatre. 
<P>During <datestruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>, Mr. Cross, having married the daughter of Mr. James Jones, was by him admitted to a share of the proprietorship, and being a spirited man, and well adapted to conduct such a concern, produced several pieces with a degree of expense and splendour which rivalled the winter houses. Among these pieces were &ldquo;Black Beard,&rdquo; a grand equestrian pantomime called &ldquo;the Magic Flute,&rdquo; &amp;c.; and the receipts either in this or the following season amounted (from information of the Treasurer of the Theatre) to between <num value="17000">17,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> and <num value="18000">18,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>

<P>The Theatre was rebuilt in <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct> (the interior), from Cabanel's designs, and opened on Easter Monday. Stage and ceiling raised, and the lobbies rendered more commodious.&mdash;It was opened with Almoran and Hamet. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>, it was altered and further embellished. During this and part of the preceding season, several new performers had been engaged, some of whom then evinced merit, and have since held respectable situations at the winter theatres. Among the names may be more particularly mentioned, Messrs. Broadhurst, J. Smith, and G. Smith, of Drury Lane; and Gibbon (singers); the late Mr. Wallack, an excellent performer for such a House, and the late Mrs. Roffey. Mr. Byrne, formerly of Covent Garden Theatre, was also engaged at this time, as harlequin and balletmaster; and Laurent as clown. With such a company the concern continued to gain ground in the public favour. 
<P>A new &ldquo;fruitery&rdquo; added, and &ldquo;silver tickets&rdquo; issued, in <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>. 
<P>During <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct> (<datestruct VALUE="-08-12"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=12>12</day></datestruct>), a fire broke out between <num value="1">one</num> and <num value="2">two</num> o'clock in the morning; it was got under by <num value="4">four</num> o'clock; but the whole of the Theatre was destroyed, with <num value="3">three</num> or more adjoining houses. The insurance was for only <num value="3000">3000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>

<P>In <datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, a new Theatre having been erected with great promptitude, was opened on Easter Monday this year. Cross was continued acting manager, under a committee of <num value="5">five</num> trustees (Jones being involved), to regulate the finance. The Theatre cost rebuilding <num value="14500">14,500</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> Like all theatres conducted by committees, the establishment soon went to ruin; it lingered until 
<P><datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, When Elliston took the Theatre for <num value="5">five</num> years, from the <datestruct VALUE="-03-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, at <num value="2100">2100</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> per annum; besides the <num value="210">210</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> ground-rent, taxes, &amp;c. &amp;c. He opened on Easter Monday with an Address, merely relative to his having boldly ventured on the Theatre, and turned singer without a voice, &amp;c.; after which the Beggar's Opera was performed as a 
<hi rend=italics>burletta.</hi><NOTE N="*"><P>Mr. Elliston started with a determination to mutilate our established dramatic pieces, and he succeeded. Not even Shakespeare's sacred name could stop his unrelenting hand; and Macbeth, sung in doggrel rhyme, evinced the little feeling an actor of high reputation on our national boards, had for our divine bard. From this bad example, have all the minor theatres gradually encroached upon the regular drama, and now openly violate the laws laid down for their government. Astley's, Sadler's Wells, the Royalty, the Regency, and even the Olympic and the Sans Pareil (though the latter are licensed by the Lord Chamberlain), stand in this predicament, their permission to play, expressly limiting them to the performance of <hi rend=italics>burlettas;</hi> and though, upon a late appeal, the law officers did not think proper to know what <hi rend=italics>was</hi> a burletta, they might, if they would consult the published documents on Palmer's claims to act at the Royalty, learn to know what is <hi rend=italics>not</hi> a burletta. Mr. Elliston's next project was to petition Parliament to perform musical pieces, with regular dialogue, for himself, and the other minor theatres. And on <datestruct VALUE="1810-03-1"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=1>1</day>, <year reg=1810>1810</year></datestruct>, he addressed a letter to Mr. Perceval, to whom he stated, &ldquo;that the license under which he acted, required that the dialogue should be attended throughout by an accompaniment of music, and that he meant to solicit leave to bring in a Bill to act operas.&rdquo; In this, of course, he failed.</NOTE>

<P>In <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, under the name of the &ldquo;Surrey Theatre&rdquo; (late royal Circus), Mr. Thomas Dibdin became sub-director. The horse-ride on this occasion was converted into a pit, but it was much too large. Elliston's <num value="1">first</num> season was incredibly successful, but his expenses were great, and he extended his seasons from <num value="6">six</num> months (from Easter to Michaelmas) to more than <num value="10">ten</num> months (much longer than the place would attract); so that before he quitted, in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, he had lost considerably. The following pieces were, among many others, altered during his management into burlettas: Macbeth; George Barnwell; Bold Stroke for a Wife; Honey Moon; London Hermit; Beggar's Opera; Children in the Wood; Matrimony; Mayor of Garrett; High Life below Stairs; Silvester Daggerwood; Raising the Wind; Son in Law; Blind Boy, &amp;c. &amp;c. 
<P>Mr. Elliston quitted the premises, <datestruct VALUE="1814-03-25"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=25>25</day>, <year reg=1814>1814</year></datestruct>, and for the remaining <num value="2">two</num> years of Jones's term they were engaged by a Mr. Dunn, who had been an assistant in the House, unknown and unacquainted with the proper mode of conducting a theatre; and a Mr. Branscomb, landlord of the Circus Coffe-house; for <num value="2000">2000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> a year. They admitted a Mr. Heywood as a partner, and again turned the pit into a circus for horsemanship. Branscomb soon after died, Heywood became a bankrupt, and this Mr. Dunn was sole arbiter. No wonder the concern was soon ruined; and so it was literally. At last even the Dog and Duck and Apollo Gardens would have been reckoned genteel places compared with it. It was in the end noticed by the magistrates. Compelled to quit before their term expired, Messrs. Dunn and Co. gutted the place of every moveable which the law allowed them to take; and on the <datestruct VALUE="1816-03-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="03">March</month> <year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, they had an auction on the premises, and sold all the rubbish not worth carrying away, and <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="9">nine</num> horses.<NOTE N="*"><P>The continuation of the account of this Theatre, from the above period until it was opened by Mr. T. Dibdin, &amp;c. will be found in an account of the Cobourg Theatre.</NOTE>

<P>Mr. T. Dibdin commenced <datestruct VALUE="1816-07-1"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=1>1</day>, <year reg=1816>1816</year></datestruct>, with a piece called &ldquo;A House Warming,&rdquo; an occasional Address, the Sicilian, and Chevy Chase; a new and commodious pit on an elevation of <num value="9">nine</num> degrees; the House altogether improved and splendidly embellished, and a numerous and well-selected company and band. The scenery and the whole of the stage apparatus were new and excellent, and the concern in all respects was on an extensive scale of expense. There were also free admissions, private boxes, a fruit-room, &amp;c. Although unsuccessful in conducting the affairs of Drury Lane Theatre, Mr. Dibdin was here quite at home. His quickness in converting some of our most popular novels into pieces suited to such a Theatre, is just what is required; they last the short time they are wanted, and are heard of no more. Since his management great variety has been brought forward, and his success has been various, sometimes losing greatly, and at other times tolerably well attended. The present season (<datestruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></datestruct>) is said, however, to have been extremely productive, from the attraction of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> fortunate pieces.

<P>This place of amusement, previously to its having become a fixed and permanent Theatre, as it at length appears to be, has perhaps had as many tenants, and undergone as many transmutations, as any place of the kind in the kingdom. When the Society of Artists was incorporated in the year <datestruct value="1765"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, James Payne, Esq. an eminent architect, purchased this part of the ground belonging to Exeter House, on which he built this elegant fabric, as a Lyceum, or Academy and Exhibition-room, to anticipate the royal establishments then in contemplation; and several exhibitions afterwards took place. It is <num value="1">first</num> noticed in the Exhibition Catalogues of that society, in the year <datestruct value="1772"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, as &ldquo;The New Room near Exeter Change.&rdquo; In the succeeding Catalogues of <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>, it is similarly designated; but in the Catalogue for the year <datestruct value="1775"><year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct>, the Exhibition is stated to be at the Society's &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Academy</hi> near Exeter Change.&rdquo; In <datestruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></datestruct>, it is called in some advertisements of chance exhibitions, which took place here, &ldquo;the Great Room, Exeter Change;&rdquo;<NOTE N="*"><P>The following were some of these about this period, and afterwards.&mdash;<datestruct VALUE="1775-06--"><month reg="06">June</month> <year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct>, &ldquo;The Comic Mirror,&rdquo; an entertainment, was exhibited a great number of nights, at <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure> admission; and again in the spring of <datestruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></datestruct>, at the &ldquo;Great Room&rdquo; near Exeter Change. And the preceding year (<datestruct value="1776"><year reg="1776">1776</year></datestruct>) the Theatre called the &ldquo;Patagonian Theatre,&rdquo; was <num value="1">first</num> opened here.&mdash;<datestruct value="1782--"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct>. The Lyceum, &ldquo;formerly the Exhibition Room of the Society of Artists,&rdquo; was advertised to be opened as a &ldquo;School of Eloquence,&rdquo; i.e. a debating society.&mdash;In <datestruct VALUE="1789-06--"><month reg="06">June</month> <year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>, the late John Palmer had an entertainment here, which he called &ldquo;As You Like It,&rdquo; assisted by Cartwright's Musical Glasses and Philosophical Fireworks. Admission, <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>s.</measure> <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure> and <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>s.</measure>&mdash;And in <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>, Mr. Dibdin <num value="1">first</num> performed here his &ldquo;Wags and Oddities.&rdquo;</NOTE> and we believe after this period, it ceased for a long time to be used for the exhibitions of the Royal Academy, as their Catalogues state those annual displays of art to have taken place at Spring Gardens. The last time it is mentioned, as connected with the Royal Academicians, is in the year <datestruct value="1790"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>, when the Exhibition of Painting, &amp;c. was held, according to the Catalogue, at &ldquo;their (i. e. the Society's) Old Room, called the <hi rend=italics>Lyceum</hi>, near Exeter Change.&rdquo; 
<P>About this time the premises, which were large, and certainly eligible for the purpose, were converted to their present use, under the auspices of their then landlord, the late Mr. Lingham, of the Strand, by whom they had been recently purchased. Some of the earliest performances, we believe, took place under the management of the late Mr. Reeve, the composer, who had a mixed entertainment there, consisting of Songs, Recitations, &amp;c. upon the plan of Mr. Dibdin's entertainments, called &ldquo;Mirth's Museum;&rdquo; in which Wewitzer, Gray, Master and Mrs. Reeve, performed.

<P>On <datestruct VALUE="1795-02-9"><month reg="02">Feb.</month> <day reg=9>9</day>, <year reg=1795>1795</year></datestruct>, Handy, a professor of horsemanship, opened a temporary theatre here, with a ride, which he called &ldquo;The New Circus.&rdquo; This adjoined the old room, or Theatre occupied before by Reeve, and stood on the site of the present Theatre. Price of admission, <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure> <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>s.</measure> and <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure> And it was afterwards engaged by Astley, when his Amphitheatre at Westminster Bridge was burnt down, who opened it on Easter Monday, <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>, at <measure value="2s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> <measure value="1s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="1">1</num>s. and <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> admission, having been occasionally used, both before and after their occupancy, for private theatricals. The late Dr. Arnold, about the year <datestruct value="1798"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>, in conjunction with Lingham, pulled down nearly the whole interior, and erected in its stead an elegant Theatre of enlarged dimensions. This was intended for musical performances of different kinds, which the Doctor was himself to have composed and superintended. But though possessed of considerable interest, and notwithstanding his having engaged a good company, he failed in getting it licensed, and involved himself, in consequence, in much expense and difficulty. 
<P>After remaining shut up for some time, or made but little use of,<NOTE N="*"><P>It was engaged during this interval as follows:&mdash;<datestruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>, Lloyd exhibited his astronomical apparatus, accompanied by a lecture, &amp;c. in the Theatre for private theatricals, and where Elliston, &amp;c. performed, termed the New Theatre. <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>, Wilks, from Dublin, gave an entertainment here, as also Collins, Kean, &amp;c.</NOTE> the premises, in the year <datestruct value="1801"><year reg="1801">1801</year></datestruct>, were engaged by Mr. Lonsdale, many years stage-manager of Sadler's Wells, and a literary man, well known to the theatrical world for his talents and ingenuity. Assisted by the able exertions of those eminent artists, the present Sir Robert Ker Porter (then Mr. Porter), Mr. Charles Pugh, of Covent Garden Theatre, Mr. William Mulready (now R.A.), and others, that gentleman brought forward a very superior and instructive exhibition, under the title of &ldquo;Aegyptiana,&rdquo; consisting of a series of beautiful scenery, &amp;c. with descriptions of Egypt; and other pieces of a similar nature. But though duly acknowledged and unequivocally praised by the well-informed as a most refined and classical evening's amusement, it was, to use the words of Hamlet, &ldquo;Caviare to the multitude.&rdquo; Like his predecessors, after having nearly ruined himself by his alterations and refitting of the Theatre, he was obliged to vacate it at the end of the season, and after various chequers of adverse fortune, he died of a dropsy and a broken heart, on the <datestruct VALUE="1816-02-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month> <year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, in his <num value="59">fifty-ninth</num> year, and was buried at St. Clement's Danes, attended by a numerous and respectable assemblage of his literary and scientific friends.<NOTE N="*"><P>Mr. Mark Lonsdale was a man eminent in his qualifications as a literary character&mdash;a man of integrity&mdash;a firm friend&mdash;and possessed of a liberal and valuable mind. He was a native of Carlisle; and, after having been in the metropolis for some time, he turned his pursuits, both as an author and mechanic, to the most intricate parts of theatrical amusement. His abilities procured his promotion to be manager of Sadler's Wells, under the proprietorships of Messrs. King, Wroughton, Arnold, and Hughes: he was the immediate predecessor of Mr. C. Dibdin. When he gave up his situation at the Wells, he became a part proprietor of the pictures of the battles of Seringapatam, &amp;c. exhibited at the Lyceum some years since. The exhibition entitled Aegyptiana was too classic: such a mode of rational amusement did not suit the inclinations of the <hi rend=italics>beau monde.</hi> The <hi rend=italics>shadows</hi> of the PHANTASMAGORIA, though terrific, were attractive! The public chose to be <hi rend=italics>terrified</hi> rather than <hi rend=italics>informed;</hi> and the Lyceum was, therefore, subservient to all the illusions of a Magic Lantern. It was Mr. Lonsdale's intention, had his <num value="1">first</num> plan succeeded, to have given the peculiarities of the geography, natural history, and manners of the inhabitants of other countries, but a disarrangement of his circumstances was the reward to his <num value="1">first</num> national endeavour. He then retired to Ireland, where he became tutor to a young nobleman, till his dramatic friends, having determined upon drawing him from his undeserved seclusion, found for him a situation in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. The shock, however, which his mind had received, was too much for his constitution, naturally tender; and he expired a victim to that neglect which his abilities and disposition had not, by any means, merited.</NOTE> Mr. De Philipstal, the person who <num value="1">first</num> introduced the Phantasmagoria into this <pb id="p.194" n="194"> country, had at this period the lower, or smaller Theatre (for the premises had been formed into <num value="2">two</num> Theatres), when, from the novelty of his entertainment, he realized considerable sums of money. 
<P>Mr. Bologna, jun. the harlequin of Covent Garden Theatre, was the next speculator in the premises, who opened the Theatre which had been occupied by Mr. De Philipstal, with an improved species of Phantasmagoria, called &ldquo;Phantascopia,&rdquo; and other amusements, in which he succeeded tolerably well for <num value="1">one</num> season.<NOTE N="*"><P>At this time the lower Theatre was occupied by a company of Germans, with an entertainment called Ergascopia, at the head of whom was Mr. Windsor, the Gas Company projector, who <num value="1">first</num> exhibited a specimen of the gas light in the large Theatre.</NOTE> The late Mr. Dibdin afterwards gave his entertainments here, assisted by various speaking and singing performers; but being, with all his merit, near this time getting out of fashion, he did but little. He was succeeded in <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>, by Laurent, the clown at Astley's. 
<P>This weak man (who had, by exertion and parsimony, saved some hundreds of pounds) nearly rebuilt, or materially altered the interior, and again converted it into <num value="1">one</num> Theatre, which he opened under the foolish title of &ldquo;The Theatre of Mirth.&rdquo; The performances, as might be expected from such a title, being only of a character to please the very lower orders, and the Theatre ill-managed, it was again closed at the end of a season, and the projector retired a bankrupt. 
<P>The next year (<datestruct value="1806"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>), Mr. Ker Porter's picture of the Battle of Agincourt was exhibited here. And Palmer afterwards gave his entertainment called &ldquo;Portraits of the Living and Dead.&rdquo; These were followed in <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>, by Incledon's &ldquo;Voyage to India,&rdquo; and Dibdin's &ldquo;Professional Volunteers.&rdquo; 
<P>Mr. S. Arnold (son of the Doctor) more fortunate than his father, at length in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, obtained a regular license for opening the Lyceum for the performance of English Operas, &amp;c. and notwithstanding some occasional ill success, still keeps possession. Soon after his taking the Theatre, Drury Lane Theatre being burnt down, that company were, by permission of the patentees, allowed to perform here until their own house was rebuilt. It received during this period the more imposing name of &ldquo;The Theatre Royal, Lyceum.&rdquo; 
<P>Finding his prospects of encouragement increase, Mr. Arnold was induced, <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> seasons since, entirely to rebuild the Lyceum Theatre, both interior and exterior, on a scale of grandeur and elegance, which renders it little inferior to the winter Theatres. In the getting up of pieces, and selection of his company, he appears to spare no expense, and has brought forward some very respectable performances, as well as many good actors. At present (<datestruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></datestruct>) Mr. Mathews, the Comedian, has concluded an entertainment delivered entirely by himself, which nightly drew crowded audiences to this Theatre, as he also did during the recess of last year. <pb id="p.195" n="195">

<P>Every subject which casts new light towards a Memoir on so justly celebrated a person as the late David Garrick, will doubtless be received with pleasure by those at present living who have witnessed his wonderful performances; as well as those to whom he is only known by traditionary anecdotes, handed to posterity by contemporary persons with himself. The Ipswich Theatre, therefore, becomes doubly interesting, both as a topographical illustration of its county history; and, as connected with the metropolitan theatres, in being, as it were, the very cradle of that surprising genius the BRITISH ROSCIUS! Garrick having made his <num value="1">first</num> public appearance on the boards of this Theatre, on the <datestruct VALUE="1741-07-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> <month reg="07">July</month> <year reg="1741">1741</year></datestruct>, in the character of Captain Duret&ecirc;te, in Farquhar's comedy of the Inconstant, or the Way to win Him. Though it is generally supposed his <num value="1">first</num> part was that of Aboan, in Southern's tragedy of Oroonoko, or the Royal Slave; prior to the date of his appearance under the name of Lyddall. 
<P>It always is a matter of curiosity and research to learn from what source the foundation or spring is derived, from which public institutions or buildings take their rise; the earliest information we can collect concerning Ipswich theatricals is from the following play-bill.<NOTE N="*"><P>It is probable, that theatrical representations were <num value="1">first</num> established at Ipswich, and some serious accident happened at a theatrical representation there, about <datestruct value="1729--"><year reg="1729">1729</year></datestruct>. In that year was published <hi rend=italics>A Prelude to the Plays; or, a few serious Questions, proposed to the Gentlemen, Ladies, and others, that frequent the Playhouse; which they are desired to answer deliberately to themselves, before they go again to those Diversions.</hi> Of this octavo tract there were <num value="2">two</num> editions in the same year, and the <num value="2">SECOND</num> is dedicated &ldquo;To the worshipful the Bailiffs and other Magistrates of His Majesty's ancient Corporation of Ipswich, or any others in like Places of Trust and Honour, through His Majesty's Dominions.&rdquo; <num value="1">One</num> of the questions begins: &ldquo;Could you never think that there was a rebuke of divine Providence upon those that attended these plays; when in <hi rend=italics>Ipswich</hi>, and other places, their building fell down, to the hurt of many, and the fright of many more?&rdquo;</NOTE>

<CELL>by Mr. Lyddall<NOTE N="*"><P>It is a well-known and established fact, that Garrick played here under the name of Lyddall; and though this is the <num value="1">first</num> notice of him by that name in the Ipswich Journals, yet it appears pretty evidently he had sustained several principal parts in the same Theatre for upwards of a month prior to the name of Lyddall being announced, which the following singular circumstance will fully bear us out in asserting, viz. that on <datestruct VALUE="-06-10"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=10>10th</day></datestruct>, in the same year, the part of Lord Foppington, in the Careless Husband; on the <num value="12">12th</num>, Orestes, in the Distrest Mother; on the <num value="22">22nd</num>, Ventrebleu and Roger Rakeit, in Lethe; on the <num value="24">24th</num>, Sir Harry Wildair, in the Constant Couple; on the <num value="26">26th</num>, Chamont, in the Orphan; and on <datestruct VALUE="-07-10"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=10>10th</day></datestruct>, Orestes, in the Distrest Mother, were represented at this Theatre, yet no name of performer appears in the bills attached to either of the characters; and when we consider the contrariety of character, and all principal! in tragedy! comedy! and farce! who but such a ph&aelig;nomenon as Garrick could have supported the Herculean labour, of rendering himself greatly eminent in all? This, however, was soon afterwards made manifest, by his prodigious success at the Goodman's Field Theatre, in the arduous and trying part of Richard the <num value="3">Third</num>, in the following October; that the whole season lasted with that performance alone, and was so attractive, that the carriages of the nobility and gentry filled the whole space from Temple Bar to Whitechapel, every time this matchless performer appeared. The <num value="2">second</num> time the name of Lyddall appeared in the Ipswich Journal was on Tuesday, the <datestruct VALUE="-07-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, when he performed the part of Dr, Caius, in the Merry Wives of Windsor; and, as Dr. Burney conjectures, Harlequin in the afterpiece; and was by the manager deemed so attractive, that the name of no other actor appears in the bill. The same company continued playing to the <datestruct VALUE="-08-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, but the dramatis person&aelig; are not given in the bills.&mdash;It appears that Paget, <num value="1">one</num> of this company, published, in September, a poem, called a Voyage to Ipswich.</NOTE></CELL>

<P>In <datestruct VALUE="1741-12--"><month reg="12">December</month> <year reg="1741">1741</year></datestruct>, Yeates's Company performed Ballad Operas and Pantomimes for <num value="3">three</num> Weeks.&mdash;Boxes <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>s.</measure>&mdash;Pit <measure value="1s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="1">1</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure>&mdash; Gal. <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure>&mdash;Upp. Gal. <measure value="6d." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> 
<P>On the <datestruct VALUE="1742-05-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month> <year reg="1742">1742</year></datestruct>, the Norwich Company advertise their performances at Woodbridge; most of the actors' names the same as in <datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>. And on the <datestruct VALUE="1742-06-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month> <year reg="1742">1742</year></datestruct>, the Company from the Theatres in London announce Richard the <num value="3">Third</num>, and the Lying Valet, written by Mr. Garrick (as it was performed upwards of <num value="30">thirty</num> nights successively, with universal applause, at the Theatre in Goodman's Fields, London.) On this occasion a Mr. Peterson played Richard. The same Company advertise no more till the <datestruct VALUE="-08-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, when (by desire of Lady Barker) they played the Miser and the Lying Valet; and closed their season on the <datestruct VALUE="-08-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, announcing for the <num value="17">17th</num> Othello and the Lying Valet. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1743--"><year reg="1743">1743</year></datestruct>, the Norwich Comnany played in the autumn at Woodbridge and Saxmundham, and in December at the Playhouse in Tankard Street, Ipswich; after which, to the end of <datestruct value="1746--"><year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct>, the Norwich Company appear to have had <num value="2">two</num> seasons yearly at the Theatre in Tankard Street, which is in use for that purpose to the present time. 
<P>The Ipswich Theatre has undergone much alteration since the time of Garrick's performances on those boards. About <num value="20">twenty</num> years since it was rebuilt, or rather re-edified, most part of the old walls being incorporated in the present building, which at that time was new fronted and decorated with a heavy colonade; since removed, which gives the aspect of the building the exact resemblance as represented in the Plate. The building to the right, with the bench and figures before it, is the Tankard Tavern; in use to the present time as a Tavern, though that has undergone some alteration since the period our drawing was taken; the windows at present being much improved by widening; the gateway, under the window, is the passage to the Pit; the boarded gateway next the Tavern, probably, is the entrance way to the Upper Gallery and Stage Door. 
<P>By the play-bills it appears, that when Garrick made his debut as an actor, he was already before the public as an author: his Farce of <hi rend=italics>Lethe</hi> having been performed at the Theatre in Drury Lane, on Tuesday, <datestruct VALUE="1740-04-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct>, after the play of the Careless Husband, as a &ldquo;New Dramatic Satire, called Lethe, or Aesop in the Shades,&rdquo; for the benefit of Mr. Gifford. It is believed, that this farce was also produced in Goodman's Fields, in the winter of <datestruct value="1740--"><year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct>-<num value="1">1</num>. This fact appears to have been unknown to Murphy, who places his Lethe after his Lying Valet. The play-bill of Saturday, the <datestruct VALUE="1741-07-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1741">1741</year></datestruct>, does not militate against the fact of Aboan's being the <num value="1">first</num> part he played. 
<P>&dagger;&dagger;&dagger; <hi rend=italics>For much of the above particulars we gratefully acknowledge our immediate obligation to the liberal communication of Mrs. J. Cobbold, of Holywells, near Ipswich.</hi>
