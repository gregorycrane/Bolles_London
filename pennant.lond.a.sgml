<p>At the period when a portion of the original <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Establishment of A British Town.</NOTE> inhabitants of this island felt an impulse towards civilization; and were inclined to withdraw from their native dens in the depth of woods, in order to form society; they cleared a spot in the midst of their forests, and placed towns, similar to those which the discoverers of the new world found occupied by the savages of <hi rend=italics>America;</hi><note><hi rend=italics>De Brie's Virginia,</hi> tab. xix. xx.</NOTE> and similar, though probably inferior, to those of the more polished race of <hi rend=italics>Negroes.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Moore's</hi> Travels into <hi rend=italics>Africa,</hi> <num value="26">26</num>.</NOTE> The <hi rend=italics>Britons</hi> soon found the danger of living in families separated and undefended. They sought for security in places surrounded with woods or morasses, and added to the natural strength by forming ramparts and sinking <pb id="p.2" n="2"> fosses.<note><CIT><QUOTE lang=la>Oppidum autem <hi rend=italics>Britanni</hi> vocant quum sylvas impeditas vallo atque fossa munierunt.</QUOTE> <BIBL>C&aelig;sar de Bel. Gal. lib. v.</BIBL></CIT>&mdash;<CIT><QUOTE lang=la>Locum egregi&egrave; et natur&acirc; et opere munitum.</QUOTE> <BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></CIT> <bibl><author>Strabo,</author> lib. iv. p. <num value="306">306</num>.</bibl></NOTE> But they preferred spots fortified by nature; and made artificial works only where nature shewed herself deficient. Within such precincts they formed their towns: their buildings were most mean and simple, covered with reeds or sticks like <hi rend=italics>American</hi> wigwams, or like modern hovels of the peasants of <hi rend=italics>Lochaber,</hi> or the cabins of the <hi rend=italics>Irish</hi> commonalty, to this moment as rude as those of the <hi rend=italics>British</hi> aborigines. To these precincts the <hi rend=italics>Britons</hi> resorted with their cattle, their wives and children,<note><CIT><QUOTE lang=la>Conjuges et liberos in loca tuta transferrent.</QUOTE> <BIBL>Tacitus in Vit. Agric. c. <num value="27">27</num>.</BIBL></CIT></NOTE> which they left thus protected, while they sallied out to war, or to the employments of the chace: for their cloathing was the skins of beasts, and their food the flesh, with the addition of milk, and farinaceous diet. The <hi rend=italics>Britons</hi> soon became acquainted with <num value="1">one</num> great use of the cow, notwithstanding they remained ignorant of the art of making cheese till the arrival of the <hi rend=italics>Romans.</hi> Agriculture was soon introduced among those who earliest formed towns or communities: possibly by strangers who visited them from the continent. They cleared the land in the neighborhood of their dwellings, they sowed corn, they reaped and deposited it in granaries under-ground, as the <pb id="p.3" n="3"> <hi rend=italics>Sicilians</hi> practise to this very day; but the latter leave it in the grain, our predecessors lodged it in the ear, out of which they picked the grains as they wanted them, and, ignorant of mills, at <num value="1">first</num> bruised, and then made them into a coarse bread.<note><hi rend=italics>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> lib. v. c. <num value="11">11</num>.</NOTE> The same nation who taught them the art of agriculture, <num value="1">first</num> introduced a change of dress. From the <hi rend=italics>Gauls</hi> of the continent, they received the <num value="1">first</num> cloth; the dress called the <hi rend=italics>Bracha,</hi> a coarse woollen manufacture. But probably it was long before they learned the use of the loom, or became their own manufacturers. This intercourse layed the foundation of commerce, which in early times extended no farther than to our maritime places. They <num value="1">first</num> received the rudiments of civilization, while the more remote remained, in proportion to their distance, more and more savage, or in a state of nature. In the same degree as the neighboring <hi rend=italics>Gauls</hi> became acquainted with the arts, they communicated them to the nearest <hi rend=italics>British</hi> colonists; who, derived from the same stock, and retaining the same language and manners, were more capable and willing to receive any instructions offered by a congenerous people. For this reason <hi rend=italics>Cantium,</hi> the modern <hi rend=italics>Kent,</hi> and probably the country for some way up the <hi rend=italics>Thames,</hi> was, as <hi rend=italics>C&aelig;sar</hi> informs us, the most civilized of any part <pb id="p.4" n="4"> of <hi rend=italics>Britain;</hi> the inhabitants differing very little in their manner of life from the <hi rend=italics>Gauls.</hi> It was from the merchants who frequented our ports, that he received the <num value="1">first</num> intelligence of the nature of our country, which induced him to undertake its invasion, and which in after-times layed the foundation of its conquest by the <hi rend=italics>Romans.</hi>

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>London.</NOTE> There is not the least reason to doubt but that <hi rend=italics>London</hi> existed at that period, and was a place of much resort. It stood in such a situation as the <hi rend=italics>Britons</hi> would select, according to the rule they established. An immense forest originally extended to the river-side, and even as late as the reign of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> II. covered the northern neighborhood of the city, and was filled with various species of beasts of chace.<note><hi rend=italics>Fitzstephen's</hi> Descr. <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> <num value="26">26</num>.</NOTE> It was defended naturally by fosses; <num value="1">one</num> formed by the creek which ran along <rs type=subject>Fleet-ditch;</rs> the other, afterwards known by that of <rs type=subject>Walbrook.</rs> The south side was guarded by the <hi rend=italics>Thames.</hi> The north they might think sufficiently protected by the adjacent forest.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>London Stone.</placename></NOTE> Near <rs type=subject>St. Swithin's</rs> church is a remnant of antiquity, which some have supposed to have been <hi rend=italics>British;</hi> a stone, which might have formed a part of a <hi rend=italics>Druidical</hi> circle, or some other object of the antient religion. Others have conjectured it to have been a military stone, and to have served <pb id="p.5" n="5"> as a standard from which they began to compute their miles, as it is placed near the center of the <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> precincts. This seems very reasonable, as the distances from the neighboring places coincide very exactly. At all times it has been preserved with great care, placed deep in the ground, and strongly fastened with bars of iron. It seems preserved like the <hi rend=italics>Palladium</hi> of the city. It is at present cased like a relique, within freestone, with a hole left in the middle, which discovers the original. Certainly superstitious respect has been payed to it; for when the notorious rebel <hi rend=italics>Jack Cade</hi> passed by it, after he had forced his way into the city, he struck his sword on
<rs type=subject>London stone,</rs> saying, &ldquo;Now is <hi rend=italics>Mortimer</hi> lord of this citie;&rdquo;<note><hi rend=italics>Holinshed,</hi>
<num value="634">634</num>.</NOTE> as if that had been a customary ceremony of taking possession.
<p>THERE is every reason to suppose that the <hi rend=italics>Romans</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG>When Founded.</NOTE> possessed themselves of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Claudius;</hi> under whom <hi rend=italics>Aulus Plautius</hi> took <hi rend=italics>Camulodunum,</hi> the present <hi rend=italics>Colchester,</hi> and planted there a colony, consisting of veterans of the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> legion, about a <num value="15">hundred and five</num> years after the <num value="1">first</num> invasion of our island by <hi rend=italics>C&aelig;sar.</hi> This was the <num value="1">first</num> footing the <hi rend=italics>Romans</hi> had in <hi rend=italics>Britain.</hi> It seems certain that <hi rend=italics>London</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Verulam</hi> were taken possession of about the same <pb id="p.6" n="6"> time; but the latter clames the honor of being of a far earlier date, more opulent, populous, and a royal seat before the conquest of <hi rend=italics>Britain</hi>. <hi rend=italics>Camulodunum</hi> was made a <hi rend=italics>Colonia,</hi> or a place governed entirely by <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> laws and customs; <hi rend=italics>Verulamium,</hi> a <hi rend=italics>Municipium,</hi> in which the natives were honored with the privileges of <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> citizens, and enjoyed their own laws and constitutions; <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Only a pr&aelig;Fectura.</NOTE> and <hi rend=italics>Londinium,</hi> only a <hi rend=italics>Pr&aelig;fectura;</hi> the inhabitants, a mixture of <hi rend=italics>Romans</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Britons,</hi> being suffered to enjoy no more than the name of citizens of <hi rend=italics>Rome,</hi> were governed by <hi rend=italics>Pr&aelig;fects</hi> sent annually from thence, without having either their own laws or magistrates. It was even then of such concourse, and such vast trade, that the wise conquerors did not think fit to trust the inhabitants with the same privileges as other places, of which they had less reason to be jealous.
<p>THERE is no mention of this important place, till the reign of <hi rend=italics>Nero;</hi> when <hi rend=italics>Tacitus</hi> speaks of it as not having been distinguished as a colony, but famous for its great concourse of merchants, and its vast commerce: this indicates, at lest, that <hi rend=italics>London</hi> had been at that time of some antiquity as a trading town, and founded long before the reign of that emperor. The exports from hence were cattle, hides, and corn; dogs made a small article; and, let me add, that slaves were a considerable object. Our internal parts were on a <pb id="p.7" n="7"> level with the <hi rend=italics>African</hi> slave coasts; and wars among the petty monarchs were promoted for the sake of a traffic now<note>And since the <num value="1">first</num> publication of this work so happily abolished. ED.</NOTE> so strongly controverted.<note><hi rend=italics>Strabo,</hi> lib. iv. p. <num value="265">265</num>.</NOTE> The earliest imports were salt, earthen ware, and <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Imports.</NOTE> works in brass, polished bits of bones emulating ivory, horse-collars, toys of amber, and glasses, and other articles of the same material.<note><hi rend=italics>Ib.</hi> lib. iv. p. <num value="307">307</num>.</NOTE> We need not insist on the commerce of this period, for there was a great trade carried on with the <hi rend=italics>Gauls</hi> in the days of <hi rend=italics>C&aelig;sar;</hi> that celebrated invader assigning, as his reason for attempting this island, the vast supplies which it furnished to his <hi rend=italics>Gaulish</hi> enemies,<note><hi rend=italics>Bell. Gall.</hi> lib. iv.</NOTE> and which interrupted his conquests on the continent.
<p>THE <num value="1">first</num> mention of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> was occasioned by <NOTE PLACE=MARG>When <num value="1">First</num> Mentioned.</NOTE> a calamity, in the year <datestruct value="61"><year reg="61">61</year></datestruct>, in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Nero,</hi> which nearly occasioned the extinction of the <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> power in <hi rend=italics>Britain.</hi> The heroine <hi rend=italics>Boadicea,</hi> indignant at the personal insult offered to her and her family, and the cruelties of the conquerors to the unhappy <hi rend=italics>Britons,</hi> made a sudden revolt, and destroyed <hi rend=italics>Camulodunum,</hi> after putting all the colonists to the sword. <hi rend=italics>Tacitus</hi> gives us the prediction of the ruin of that city, with all the majesty of historical superstition. <CIT><QUOTE lang=la>Nulla pal&agrave;m <pb id="p.8" n="8"> causa delapsum <emph>Camaloduni</emph> simulacrum victori&aelig;, ac retro conversum, quasi cederet hostibus.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Destroyed by the Britons.</NOTE> THE <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> general <hi rend=italics>Paulinus Suetonius,</hi> on this news, suddenly marched across the kingdom, from his conquests in <hi rend=italics>North Wales,</hi> to <hi rend=italics>London;</hi> which, finding himself unequal to defend with his small army, he evacuated to the fury of the enemy, after reinforcing his troops with all the natives who were fit to serve. Neither the tears or prayers of the inhabitants could prevale on him to give them his protection. The enraged <hi rend=italics>Boadicea</hi> destroyed all who continued behind. <hi rend=italics>Verulamium</hi> met with the same fate. In all the <num value="3">three</num> places <num value="70000">seventy thousand</num> <hi rend=italics>Romans</hi> and <hi rend=italics>British</hi> allies perished.<note><hi rend=italics>Ib.</hi> lib. xiv. c. <num value="33">33</num>.</NOTE>
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Enlarged by the Romans.</NOTE> WHEN the <hi rend=italics>Romans</hi> became masters of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> they enlarged the precincts, and altered their form. It extended in length from <hi rend=italics>Ludgate-hill</hi> to a spot a little beyond the <hi rend=italics>Tower.</hi> The breadth <pb id="p.9" n="9"> was not half equal to the length, and at each end it became considerably narrower. Mr. <hi rend=italics>Maitland</hi> suspects that the walls were not built till a very late period of the empire, and that it was an open <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Long an Open Town.</NOTE> town; because the city happened to be surprized, in the days of <hi rend=italics>Dioclesian</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Maximilian,</hi> by a party of banditti, who were cut off by a band of <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> soldiers, who fortunately had, at the very time they were engaged in the plunder, come up the river in a fog. The time in which the wall <NOTE PLACE=MARG>When Walled.</NOTE> was built is very uncertain. Some ascribe the work to <hi rend=italics>Constantine</hi> the Great. <hi rend=italics>Maitland,</hi> to <hi rend=italics>Theodosius,</hi> governor of <hi rend=italics>Britain</hi> in <num value="369">369</num>; of whom we know no more, than that, after he had cleared the country of the barbarians, he redressed grievances, strengthened the garrisons, and repaired the cities and forts<note><hi rend=italics>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> lib. xxviii. c. <num value="3">3</num>.</NOTE> which had been damaged. If <hi rend=italics>London</hi> was among those, it certainly implies a prior fortification. Possibly their founder might have been <hi rend=italics>Constantine,</hi> as numbers of coins of his mother <hi rend=italics>Helena</hi> have been discovered under them, placed there by him in compliment to her. This conjecture we may strengthen by saying, that in honor of this empress, the city received from her the title of <hi rend=italics>Augusta;</hi> which for some time superseded the antient <num value="1">one</num> of <hi rend=italics>Londinium.</hi> Long before this period, it was fully <hi rend=italics>romanized,</hi> and the <pb id="p.10" n="10"> customs, manners, buildings, and arts of the conqueror were adopted. The commerce of the empire flowed in regularly; came in a direct channel from the several parts then known, not as in the earlier days (when described by <hi rend=italics>Strabo</hi>) by the intervention of other nations; for till the settlement of the <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> conquest, nothing could come immediately from <hi rend=italics>Italy.</hi>

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Extent and Form.</NOTE> THE antient course of the walls was as follows: &mdash;It began with a fort near the present site of the <hi rend=italics>Tower,</hi> was continued along the <hi rend=italics>Minories,</hi> and the back of <hi rend=italics>Houndsditch,</hi> across <hi rend=italics>Bishopsgatestreet,</hi> in a strait line by <hi rend=italics>London-wall</hi> to <hi rend=italics>Cripplegate;</hi> then returned southward by <hi rend=italics>Crowder's Well Alley,</hi> (where several remnants of lofty towers were lately to be seen) to <hi rend=italics>Aldersgate;</hi> thence along the back of <hi rend=italics>Bull-and-Mouth-street</hi> to <hi rend=italics>Newgate,</hi> and again along the back of the houses in the <hi rend=italics>Old Bailey</hi> to <hi rend=italics>Ludgate;</hi> soon after which it probably finished with another fort, where the house, late the King's Printing House, in <hi rend=italics>Black Friars,</hi> now stands: from hence another wall ran near the river-side, along <hi rend=italics>Thames-street,</hi> quite to the fort on the eastern extremity. In another place I shall have occasion to mention that the river at present is moved considerably more to the south, than it was in the times in question.
<p>THAT the <hi rend=italics>Romans</hi> had a fort on the spot at <pb id="p.11" n="11"> present occupied by the <hi rend=italics>Tower,</hi> is now past doubt, since the discovery of a silver ingot, and <num value="3">three</num> golden coins; <num value="1">one</num> of the emperor <hi rend=italics>Honorius,</hi> the others of <hi rend=italics>Arcadius.</hi> These were found in <datestruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></datestruct>, in digging for the foundation of a new office for the Board of Ordnance, through the foundation of certain antient buildings, beneath which they were met with on the natural ground. The ingot was in form of a double wedge, <num value="4">four</num> inches long, and <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="3">three</num> quarters broad in the broadest part, and <num value="3">three</num>-eighths of an inch thick in the middle; it appears to have been cast <num value="1">first</num>, and then beaten into form by a hammer; its weight is <num value="10">ten</num> ounces <num value="8">eight</num> grains of the troy pound. In the middle is struck, in <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> letters,
<emph>EX OFFIC HONORII</emph>

<p>This is supposed to have come from the royal mint, then at <hi rend=italics>Constantinople,</hi> and intended to ascertain the purity of the silver coin, that might have been sent over with it, <hi rend=italics>Honorius</hi> reigning over the empire of the west, as <hi rend=italics>Arcadius</hi> did over that of the east. This was at the expiration of the <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> power in <hi rend=italics>Britain.</hi> The coins were supposed to have been part of the money sent to pay the last legion which was ever sent to the assistance of the <hi rend=italics>Britons.</hi> The <hi rend=italics>Tower</hi> was the <pb id="p.12" n="12"> treasury in which the public money was deposited. The coins are in fine preservation. On the reverse is an armed man treading on a captive, with the legend VICTORIA AVGGG, and at the bottom CONOB. The <num value="1">first</num> alludes to the success of the legion against the <hi rend=italics>Picts</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Scots.</hi> CONOB. may intend <foreign lang=la>Constantinopoli obsignata.</foreign><note>See the learned Dean <hi rend=italics>Milles's</hi> essay on these subjects in the <hi rend=italics>Arch&aelig;ologia,</hi> v. p. <num value="291">291</num>. tab. xxv.</NOTE>
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Towers.</NOTE> THE walls were <num value="3">three</num> miles a <num value="165">hundred and sixty-five</num> feet in circumference, guarded at proper distances, on the land side, with <num value="15">fifteen</num> lofty towers; some of them were remaining within these few years, and possibly may be so still. <hi rend=italics>Maitland</hi> mentions <num value="1">one</num>, <num value="26">twenty-six</num> feet high, near <hi rend=italics>Gravel-lane,</hi> on the west side of <hi rend=italics>Houndsditch;</hi> another, about <num value="80">eighty</num> paces south-east towards <hi rend=italics>Aldgate;</hi> and the bases of another, supporting a modern house, at the lower end of the street called the <hi rend=italics>Vineyard,</hi> south of <hi rend=italics>Aldgate.</hi> But since his publication, they have been demolished, so that there is not a trace of them left. The walls, when perfect, are supposed to have been twentytwo feet high, the towers <num value="40">forty</num>. These, with the remnants of the wall, proved the structure to be <hi rend=italics>Roman,</hi> by the tiles and disposition of the masonry. <hi rend=italics>London-wall,</hi> near <hi rend=italics>Moorfields,</hi> is now the most entire part left of that antient precinct.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>A Specula.</NOTE> I MUST not omit the <hi rend=italics>Barbican,</hi> the <hi rend=italics>Specula</hi> or <pb id="p.13" n="13"> <hi rend=italics>Watch-tower</hi> belonging to every fortified place. This stood a little without the walls, to the northwest of <hi rend=italics>Cripplegate.</hi>

<p>THE gates, which received the great military <NOTE PLACE=MARG>The Gates.</NOTE> roads, were <num value="4">four</num>. The <hi rend=italics>Pr&aelig;torian</hi> way, the <hi rend=italics>Saxon Watling-street,</hi> passed under <num value="1">one</num>, on the site of the late <hi rend=italics>Newgate;</hi> vestiges having been discovered of the road in digging above <hi rend=italics>Holborn-bridge:</hi> it turned down to <hi rend=italics>Dow</hi>-gate, or more properly <hi rend=italics>Dwr</hi>-gate or <hi rend=italics>Water</hi>-gate, where there was a <hi rend=italics>Trajectus</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Ferry,</hi> to join it to the <hi rend=italics>Watling-street,</hi> which was continued to <hi rend=italics>Dover.</hi> The <hi rend=italics>Erminstreet</hi> passed under <hi rend=italics>Cripplegate;</hi> and a vicinal way went under <hi rend=italics>Aldgate,</hi> by <hi rend=italics>Bethnal Green,</hi> towards <hi rend=italics>Oldford,</hi> a pass over the river <hi rend=italics>Lee</hi> to <hi rend=italics>Duroleiton,</hi> the modern <hi rend=italics>Leyton,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Essex.</hi>

<p>IN most parts of antient <hi rend=italics>London, Roman</hi> antiquities <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Antiquities.</NOTE> have been found, whenever it has been thought necessary to dig to any considerable depth. Beneath the old <hi rend=italics>Saint Mary le Bow</hi> were found the walls, windows, and pavement of a <hi rend=italics>Roman Temple;</hi> and not far from it, eighteen feet deep in adventitious soil, was the <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> causeway. The great elevation of the present ground above its former state, will be taken notice of in another place.
<p>IN digging the foundation for rebuilding <hi rend=italics>St. Paul's,</hi> was found a vast c&oelig;metery: <num value="1">first</num> lay the <hi rend=italics>Saxons,</hi> in graves lined with masses of chalk, or in <pb id="p.14" n="14"> coffins of hollowed stones; beneath them had been the bodies of the <hi rend=italics>Britons,</hi> placed in rows. Abundance of ivory and boxen pins, about <num value="6">six</num> inches long, marked where the latter had been deposited. These are supposed to have fastened the shrouds in which the bodies were wrapped.<note><hi rend=italics>Parentalia,</hi> p. <num value="266">266</num>.</NOTE> These perishing, left the pins entire. In the same row, but deeper, were <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> urns intermixed, lamps, lacrymatories; fragments of sacrificial vessels were also discovered, in digging towards the north-east corner; and in <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, not far from the east corner, at a considerable depth, beneath some flinty pavement, were found numbers of vessels of earthen ware, and of glass, of most exquisite colors and beauty, some inscribed with the names of deities, heroes, or men of rank. Others ornamented with a variety of figures in <hi rend=italics>bas relief,</hi> of animals and of rose-trees. <hi rend=italics>Tesserul&aelig;</hi> of jasper, porphyry, or marble, such as form the pavement we so often see, were also discovered. Also glass beads and rings, large pins of ivory and bone, tusks of boars, and horns of deer sawn through. Also coins of different emperors, among them some of <hi rend=italics>Constantine;</hi> which at once destroys the conjecture of Mr. <hi rend=italics>Maitland,</hi> who supposes that this collection was flung together at the sacking of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> by our injured <hi rend=italics>Boadicea.</hi> <pb id="p.15" n="15"> 
<p>IN <datestruct value="1711--"><year reg="1711">1711</year></datestruct>, another c&oelig;metery was discovered, in <hi rend=italics>Camomile-street,</hi> adjoining to <hi rend=italics>Bishopsgate.</hi> It lay beneath a handsome tessellated pavement, and contained numbers of urns filled with ashes and cinders of burnt bones; with them were beads, rings, a lacrymatory, a <hi rend=italics>fibula,</hi> and a coin of <hi rend=italics>Antoninus.</hi>

<p>IN <hi rend=italics>Spittlefields</hi> was another <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> burying-place, <NOTE PLACE=MARG>In <placename>Spittlefields.</placename></NOTE> of which many curious particulars are mentioned by old <hi rend=italics>Stow,</hi> in p. <num value="323">323</num> of his Survey of <hi rend=italics>London:</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Camden</hi> gives a brief account of another, discovered in <hi rend=italics>Goodman's fields.</hi> Among the antiquities found in <hi rend=italics>Spittlefields,</hi> was a great ossuary made of glass, encompassed with <num value="5">five</num> parallel circles, and containing a gallon and a half: it had a handle, a very short neck, and wide mouth of a whiter metal. This was presented to Sir <hi rend=italics>Christopher Wren,</hi> who lodged it in the <hi rend=italics>Museum</hi> of the Royal Society.<note><hi rend=italics>Parentalia,</hi> p. <num value="267">267</num>. <hi rend=italics>Grew's</hi> Museum, <num value="380">380</num>.</NOTE> I point out these as means of discovering the antient <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> precincts of the city. The c&oelig;meteries must have been without the walls: it being a wise and express law of the XII Tables, <hi rend=italics>that no <num value="1">one</num> should be buried within the walls.</hi> I cannot think that the urns found near <hi rend=italics>St. Paul's</hi> were funereal; if they were so, the <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> walls must have been much farther to the east than they are generally supposed <pb id="p.16" n="16"> to have been placed; which by no means appears to have been the fact.
<p>I WILL only mention <num value="1">one</num> other antiquity found here: very few indeed have been preserved, out of the multitude which must have been discovered in a place of such importance, and the capital of the <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> empire in <hi rend=italics>Britain.</hi> That which I shall speak of is a sepulchral monument, in memory of <hi rend=italics>Vivius Marcianus,</hi> (a <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> soldier of the <num value="2">second</num> legion, quartered here,) erected by his wife <hi rend=italics>Januaria Matrina.</hi> It represents him as a <hi rend=italics>British</hi> soldier, probably of the <hi rend=italics>Cohors Britonum,</hi> dressed and armed after the manner of the country, with long hair, a short lower garment fastened round the waist by a girdle and <hi rend=italics>fibula,</hi> a long <hi rend=italics>Sagum</hi> or plaid flung over his breast and <num value="1">one</num> arm, ready to be cast off in time of action, naked legs, and in his right hand a sword of vast length, like the <hi rend=italics>claymore</hi> of the later <hi rend=italics>Highlanders;</hi> the point is represented resting on the ground: in his left hand is a short instrument, with the end seemingly broken off. This sculpture was found in digging among the ruins, after the fire in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, in the <hi rend=italics>vallum</hi> of the <hi rend=italics>Pr&aelig;torian</hi> camp near <hi rend=italics>Ludgate.</hi> The soldiers were always buried in the <hi rend=italics>Vallum;</hi> the citizens in the <hi rend=italics>Pom&oelig;rium,</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Parentalia,</hi> p. <num value="266">266</num>.&mdash;The <hi rend=italics>Pom&oelig;rium</hi> was a space on the outside of fortified towns, on which all buildings were prohibited.</NOTE> without the gates. It is very <pb id="p.17" n="17"> differently and faultily represented by Mr. <hi rend=italics>Gale.</hi> The hair in his figure is short, the sword also short, and held with the left hand across his body, the instrument is placed in the left hand, and resembles an exact <hi rend=italics>Baton:</hi> the dress also differs. I give the preference to the figure given by Mr. <hi rend=italics>Horsely,</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Gale's Iter Anton,</hi> <num value="68">68</num>. <hi rend=italics>Britannia Romana,</hi> <num value="331">331</num>. tab. <num value="75">75</num>.</NOTE> which he corrected after that given by Dr. <hi rend=italics>Prideaux,</hi> from the <hi rend=italics>Arundelian</hi> marbles. But Mr. <hi rend=italics>Horsely</hi> fairly confesses that the representation is far more elegant than in the mutilated original.
<p>AFTER the <hi rend=italics>Romans</hi> deserted <hi rend=italics>Britain,</hi> a new and <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Saxon invasion.</NOTE> fierce race succeeded. The warlike <hi rend=italics>Saxons,</hi> under their leaders <hi rend=italics>Hengest</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Horsa,</hi> landed in <num value="448">448</num>, at <hi rend=italics>Upwines fleot,</hi> the present <hi rend=italics>Ebbsflete,</hi> in the isle of <hi rend=italics>Thanet.</hi> The <hi rend=italics>Britons</hi> remained masters of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> at lest <num value="9">nine</num> years after that event; for, receiving a defeat in <num value="457">457</num>, at <hi rend=italics>Creccanford, (Crayford)</hi> they evacuated <hi rend=italics>Kent,</hi> and fled with great fear to the capital.<note><hi rend=italics>Sax. Chron.</hi></NOTE> By the year <datestruct value="604"><year reg="604">604</year></datestruct>, it seems to have recovered from the ravages of the invaders. It became the chief town of the kingdom of <hi rend=italics>Essex. Sebert</hi> was the <num value="1">first</num> Christian king; and his maternal uncle <hi rend=italics>Ethelbert,</hi> king of <hi rend=italics>Kent,</hi> founded here a church dedicated to <hi rend=italics>St. Paul.</hi> At this time <hi rend=italics>Bede</hi> informs us that it was an <hi rend=italics>emporium</hi>
<pb id="p.18" n="18"> of a vast number of nations, who resorted thither by sea and by land.
<p>IN the reign of that great prince ALFRED, <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> or, to use the <hi rend=italics>Saxon</hi> name, <hi rend=italics>Lundenburg,</hi> was made by him the capital of all <hi rend=italics>England.</hi> In consequence of a vow he had made, he sent <hi rend=italics>Sighelm,</hi> bishop of <hi rend=italics>Sherbourn,</hi> <num value="1">first</num> to <hi rend=italics>Rome,</hi> and from thence to <hi rend=italics>India,</hi> with alms to the Christians of the town of <hi rend=italics>St. Thomas,</hi> now called <hi rend=italics>Bekkeri,</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Meliapour:</hi> who returned with various rich gems, some of which were to be seen in the church of <hi rend=italics>Sherbourn,</hi> in the days of <hi rend=italics>William</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Malmesbury.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Sax. Chron.</hi> <num value="86">86</num>. <hi rend=italics>Will. Malmsb.</hi> lib. ii. <num value="248">248</num>.</NOTE> It must not be omitted that he was the <num value="1">first</num> who, from this island, had any commerce with that distant country. Our commerce by sea, even in the next century, was not very extensive, the wise monarch <hi rend=italics>Athelstan</hi> being obliged, for the encouragement of navigation, to promise patents of gentility to every merchant, who should, on his own bottom, make <num value="3">three</num> voyages to the <hi rend=italics>Mediterranean.</hi>

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Norman Conquest.</NOTE> THE succeeding ravages of the <hi rend=italics>Danes</hi> reduced <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> and its commerce, to a low ebb: yet it seems in some measure to have recovered before the Conquest. We are wonderfully in the dark respecting the state of its government, both <pb id="p.19" n="19"> in the <hi rend=italics>Saxon</hi> period, and at that of the Conquest: in respect to the former, we know no more than that it was governed by a <hi rend=italics>Portreve</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Portgrave,</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Long Governed by A Portgrave.</NOTE> or guardian of the port; and this we learn from the concise charter granted to the city by <hi rend=italics>William</hi> the Conqueror, in which he salutes <hi rend=italics>William</hi> the bishop, and <hi rend=italics>Godfrey</hi> the <hi rend=italics>Portreve,</hi> and all the burgesses. &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>William</hi> kyng gret <hi rend=italics>William</hi> Bisceop, and <hi rend=italics>Gosfregth</hi> Porterefan, and ealle tha Burhwarn binnen Londone, Frencisce and Englisce frendlice.

And ic nelle ge wolian thaet aenig man eow eanig wrang beode. God eow ge healde.&rdquo;<note><hi rend=italics>Strype's Stow.</hi></NOTE> It is probable that the bishop of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> for the time being, and the <hi rend=italics>Portgrave,</hi> were united in the government, for in the <hi rend=italics>Saxon</hi> charters they are mentioned together: in the time of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> the Confessor, <hi rend=italics>Alfwar</hi> the bishop, and <hi rend=italics>Wolfgar</hi> my <hi rend=italics>Portgrave. William</hi> bishop, and <hi rend=italics>Swerman</hi> my <hi rend=italics>Portgrave.</hi>

<p>LONDON certainly could not have been in the very low condition, which some writers represent, at the time of the Conquest. It ventured to sally out on the Conqueror, but without <pb id="p.20" n="20"> success. It fell more by internal faction, than its own weakness; yet there was strength enough left, to make <hi rend=italics>William</hi> think proper to secure its allegiance, by building that strong fortress the <hi rend=italics>Tower.</hi> In <num value="70">seventy</num> years from that event, an historian<note><hi rend=italics>Fitzstephen.</hi></NOTE> then living pretends, that <hi rend=italics>London</hi> mustered <num value="60000">sixty thousand</num> foot, and <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> horse. If this is any thing near the truth, is it possible but that <hi rend=italics>London</hi> must have been very powerful at the time of the Conquest? for the period between that event and the reign of <hi rend=italics>Stephen,</hi> was not well calculated for a great increase of populatioa. I rather concur with those who think that the muster must have been of the militia of the neighboring counties, and <hi rend=italics>London</hi> the place of rendezvous. A writer<note><hi rend=italics>Peter de Blois,</hi> archdeacon of <hi rend=italics>London.</hi> See <hi rend=italics>Fitzstephen,</hi> p. <num value="28">28</num>, in the note.</NOTE> of that period, and at the very time resident in the capital, with more appearance of truth, makes the number of inhabitants only <num value="40000">forty thousand</num>.
<p>DURING the time of the Conqueror, and till the reign of <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> I. the name of the civil governor continued the same. That monarch, to support the madness of the <hi rend=italics>crusade,</hi> received from the citizens a large sum of money; and in return, permitted them to chuse annually <num value="2">two</num> <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Next by Bailiffs.</NOTE> officers, under the name of bailiffs, or sheriffs; <pb id="p.21" n="21"> who were to supersede the former. The names of the <num value="2">two</num> <num value="1">first</num> upon record are <hi rend=italics>Wolgarius,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Geffry de Magnum.</hi>

<p>IN the next reign was added the office of <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Changed to A Mayor.</NOTE> mayor, a title borrowed from the <hi rend=italics>Norman Maire,</hi> as well as the office. <hi rend=italics>Henry Fitzalwyn</hi> was the <num value="1">first</num> elected to that trust. He had been before mayor, but only by the nomination of his prince.
<p>IN the reign of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> III. after the citizens had suffered many oppressions, he restored a form of government, and appointed <num value="24">twenty-four</num> citizens to share the power. In his son's reign, we find the city divided into <num value="24">twenty-four</num> wards; the supreme magistrate of which was named <hi rend=italics>Alderman,</hi> an exceedingly antient <hi rend=italics>Saxon</hi> title. <hi rend=italics>Aelder-man,</hi> a <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Aldermen.</NOTE> man advanced in years, and accordingly supposed to be of superior wisdom and gravity. In the time of <hi rend=italics>Edgar,</hi> the office was among the <num value="1">first</num> in the kingdom. <hi rend=italics>Ailwyn,</hi> ancestor to the <num value="1">first</num> mayor, was alderman of all <hi rend=italics>England;</hi> what the duties of his office were, does not appear.
<p>HE must be a <hi rend=italics>Briareus</hi> in literature, who would dare to attempt a history of our capital, on the great, the liberal, the elegant plan which it merits. I, a puny adventurer, animated with a mind incapable of admitting a vacant hour; restless when unemployed in the rural scenes to which my fortunate lot has destined me, must catch and enjoy the idea of the minute. In the <pb id="p.22" n="22"> pursuit of my plan, I wish to give a slight view of the shores I am about to launch from: the account must be brief and confined; limited to what I shall say of their antient state, to the period bounded by the REVOLUTION; intermixed with the greater events, which have happened in nearer days.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Situation.</NOTE> THE choice of the situation of this great city was most judicious. It is on a gravelly soil; and on a declivity sloping down to the borders of a magnificent river. The slope is evident in every part of the antient city, and of the vast modern buildings. The antient city was defended in front by the river; on the west side by the deep ravine, since known by the name of <hi rend=italics>Fleet-ditch;</hi> on the north by morasses; on the east, as I suspect, by another ravine. All the land round <hi rend=italics>Westminster Abbey</hi> was a flat fen, which continued beyond <hi rend=italics>Fulham:</hi> but a rise commences opposite to it, and forms a magnificent bend above the curvature of the <hi rend=italics>Thames,</hi> even to the <hi rend=italics>Tower.</hi> The <hi rend=italics>Surry</hi> side was in all probability a great expanse of water, a lake, a <hi rend=italics>Llyn,</hi> as the <hi rend=italics>Welsh</hi> call it; which an ingenious countryman of mine,<note>Mr. <hi rend=italics>William Owen,</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Barmouth,</hi> now resident in <hi rend=italics>London.</hi></NOTE> not without reason, thinks might have given a name to our capital; <hi rend=italics>Llyn Din,</hi> or the city on the lake. This most probably was the <pb id="p.23" n="23"> original name: and that derived from. <hi rend=italics>Llong</hi> a ship, and <hi rend=italics>Din</hi> a town, might have been bestowed when the place became a seat of trade, and famous for the concourse of shipping. The expanse of water might have filled the space between the rising grounds at <hi rend=italics>Deptford,</hi> and those at <hi rend=italics>Clapham;</hi> and been bounded to the south by the beautiful <hi rend=italics>Surry Hills. Lambeth Marsh,</hi> and the <hi rend=italics>Bankside,</hi> evidently were recovered from the water. Along <hi rend=italics>Lambeth</hi> are the names of <hi rend=italics>Narrow Walls,</hi> or the mounds which served for that purpose; and in <hi rend=italics>Southwark, Bankside</hi> again shews the means of converting the antient lake into useful land: even to this day the tract beyond <hi rend=italics>Southwark,</hi> and in particular that beyond <hi rend=italics>Bermondsey-street,</hi> is so very low, and beneath the level of common tides, that the proprietors are obliged to secure it by embankments.
<p>I BEGIN my account by crossing over the <hi rend=italics>Thames</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Surry.</placename></NOTE> into <hi rend=italics>Surry,</hi> which, with <hi rend=italics>Sussex,</hi> formed the country of the antient <hi rend=italics>Regni,</hi> being part of this island to which the <hi rend=italics>Romans</hi> permitted a kingly government, merely to enjoy the insolent boast of having kings as their slaves. The <hi rend=italics>Saxons</hi> bestowed on this part their own names of <hi rend=italics>Suthry</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Suthrea,</hi> from its situation on the southern part of the river. I proceed to my accustomed walk of LAMBETH. In the <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Lambeth.</placename></NOTE> earlier times it was a manor, possibly a royal <pb id="p.24" n="24"> <num value="1">one</num>, for the great <hi rend=italics>Hardiknut</hi> died here in <datestruct value="1042--"><year reg="1042">1042</year></datestruct>, in the midst of the jollity of a wedding dinner: and here, without any formality, the usurper <hi rend=italics>Harold</hi> is said to have snatched the crown, and placed it on his own head.
<p>ABOUT the time of <hi rend=italics>Hardiknut's</hi> death this place was part of the estate of <hi rend=italics>Goda,</hi> wife to <hi rend=italics>Walter</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Mantes,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Eustace</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Boulogne;</hi> who presented it to the church of <hi rend=italics>Rochester,</hi> but reserved to herself the patronage of the church. It became, in <datestruct value="1197--"><year reg="1197">1197</year></datestruct>, the property of the see of <hi rend=italics>Canterbury,</hi> by an exchange made between <hi rend=italics>Glanville</hi> bishop of <hi rend=italics>Rochester,</hi> and the archbishop <hi rend=italics>Hubert Walter. Glanville</hi> reserved out of the exchange a small piece of land, on which he built a house called <hi rend=italics>Rochester Place,</hi> for the reception of the bishops of <hi rend=italics>Rochester,</hi> whenever they came to attend parlement. In <datestruct value="1357--"><year reg="1357">1357</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>John de Shepey</hi> built <hi rend=italics>Stangate-stairs,</hi> for the convenience of himself and retinue to cross over into <hi rend=italics>Westminster. Fisher</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Hilsley</hi> were the last bishops who inhabited this palace; after their deaths it fell into the hands of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. who exchanged with <hi rend=italics>Aldrich</hi> bishop of <hi rend=italics>Carlisle,</hi> for certain houses in the <hi rend=italics>Strand.</hi> Its name was changed to that of <hi rend=italics>Carlisle-house.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Ducarel's Lambeth,</hi> <num value="72">72</num>.</NOTE> The small houses built on its <pb id="p.25" n="25"> site still belong to that see. It had been the design <NOTE PLACE=MARG>A College of Secular Monks Projected Here.</NOTE> of archbishop <hi rend=italics>Walter,</hi> to erect here a college of secular monks, independent of those of <hi rend=italics>Canterbury.</hi> It was originally designed, by archbishop <hi rend=italics>Baldwyn,</hi> to have been built at <hi rend=italics>Hackington,</hi> or <hi rend=italics>St. Stephen's,</hi> near that city: but such a jealousy did those holy men conceive at the thought of a rival house so near to their own, that by their interest with the pope the project was layed aside. It was afterwards resumed by <hi rend=italics>Hubert Walter,</hi> who thought he could give no offence by erecting the college on this distant manor; but the monks obtained a bull from the pope in their favor, and such humiliating terms were prescribed to the archbishop, that thenceforth he entirely desisted from the design.<note><hi rend=italics>Ducarel's Lambeth,</hi> <num value="8">8</num>, <num value="9">9</num>.</NOTE> The mortifications which the primates met with in the prosecution of it, seem to have <num value="1">first</num> determined them in fixing their residence here. <hi rend=italics>Walter</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Langton</hi> successively lived at the manor-house of <hi rend=italics>Lambeth.</hi> The latter improved it, but the building was afterwards neglected and became ruinous. No pious zeal restored the place, but the madness of priestly pride. <hi rend=italics>Boniface,</hi> a wrathful and turbulent primate, elected in <datestruct value="1244--"><year reg="1244">1244</year></datestruct>, took it into his head to become a visitor of the priory of <hi rend=italics>St. Bartholomew,</hi> to which he had no right. The monks met him <pb id="p.26" n="26"> with reverential respect, but assured him the office did not belong to the bishop. The meek prelate rushed on the sub-prior, knocked him down, kicked, beat, and buffeted him, tore the cope off his back, and stamped on it like <num value="1">one</num> possessed, while his attendants payed the same compliments to all the poor monks. The people, enraged at his unpriestly conduct, would have torn him to pieces; when he retired to <hi rend=italics>Lambeth,</hi> and, by way of expiation, rebuilt it with great magnificence.
<p>THIS palace was very highly improved by the munificent <hi rend=italics>Henry Chichely,</hi> who enjoyed the primacy from <datestruct value="1414--"><year reg="1414">1414</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1443--"><year reg="1443">1443</year></datestruct>. I lament to find so worthy a man to have been the founder of a building so reproachful to his memory as the <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Lollards Tower.</placename></NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Lollards</hi> tower, at the expence of nearly <measure value="280l." type=currency><num value="280">two hundred and eighty</num> pounds</measure>. Neither protestants or catholics should omit visiting this tower, the cruel prison of the unhappy followers of <hi rend=italics>Wickliffe.</hi> The vast staples and rings, to which they were chained before they were brought to the stake, ought to make protestants bless the hour which freed them from so bloody a period. Catholics may glory, that time has softened their zeal into charity for all sects, and made them blush at these memorials of the misguided zeal of their ancestors.
<p>THIS palace suffered greatly in the civil wars. After those of <hi rend=italics>York</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Lancaster,</hi> it was restored <pb id="p.27" n="27"> by archbishop <hi rend=italics>Morton.</hi> He also built the gateway; in the lower room of which are still to be seen the rings to which the overflowings of the <hi rend=italics>Lollards</hi> tower were chained.
<p>AFTER the civil wars of the last century, when <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Fanatical Fury.</NOTE> fanatical was united with political fury, it was found that every building devoted to piety, had suffered more than they had done in all the rage of family contest. The fine works of art, and the sacred memorials of the dead, were, except in a few cases, sacrificed to puritanical barbarism, or to sacrilegious plunder. <hi rend=italics>Lambeth</hi> fell to the share of the miscreant regicide <hi rend=italics>Scot.</hi> He turned the chapel into a hall, and levelled, for that purpose, the fine monument of archbishop <hi rend=italics>Parker:</hi> he pulled down the noble hall, the work of <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Great Hall.</NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Chichely,</hi> and sold the materials for his own profit. <hi rend=italics>Juxon,</hi> on the Restoration, found the palace of his predecessors a heap of ruins. His piety rebuilt a greater part than could have been expected from the short time he enjoyed the primacy. He restored the great hall on the antient model, when the archbishop with his particular friends sat at the high table: the steward with the servants, who were gentry of the better rank, occupied the table on the right hand side; the almoner, the clergy, and others, that on the left. None but nobility or privy counsellors were admitted to the table of the archbishop. The bishops themselves <pb id="p.28" n="28"> sat at the almoner's; the other guests at the steward's. All the meat which was not consumed, was regularly given to the idle poor, who waited in crowds at the gate. It is not the defect of charity in modern prelates that this custom is disused;<note>A <hi rend=italics>dole,</hi> however, consisting of <num value="15">fifteen</num> quartern loaves, <num value="9">nine</num> stone of beef, and <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure> worth of halfpence, is still distributed, in <num value="3">three</num> equal portions weekly, to <num value="30">thirty</num> poor parishioners of <hi rend=italics>Lambeth.</hi> ED.</NOTE> but the happy change in the times. Every <num value="1">one</num> must now eat the bread of his own industry; a much more certain support than the casual bounty of the great, which misfortunes often prevented, and left the object a prey to misery and famine. What is styled the luxury of the times, has by no means superseded deeds of alms. Wealth is more equally diffused; but charity is equally great: it passes now through many channels, and makes less noise than when it was poured through fewer streams.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Library.</NOTE> THE fine library in this palace was founded by archbishop <hi rend=italics>Bancroft;</hi> who died in <datestruct value="1610--"><year reg="1610">1610</year></datestruct>, and left all his books to his successors, for ever. The succeeding archbishop, <hi rend=italics>Abbot,</hi> bequeathed all his books in his great study, marked G. C., in the same unlimited manner.
<p>ON the suppression of episcopacy, this valuable library was preserved by the address of the celebrated Mr. <hi rend=italics>Selden.</hi> It seems that archbishop <pb id="p.29" n="29"> <hi rend=italics>Bancroft</hi> had left his books to his successors, on condition that the immediate successor was to give bond that they should not be embezzled, but delivered entire from <num value="1">one</num> to the other for ever. On failure of this article, they were to go to <hi rend=italics>Chelsea College,</hi> in case it was built in <num value="6">six</num> years after his decease. The college never was finished: whether any of <hi rend=italics>Bancroft's</hi> successors gave the security does not appear. The books were remaining at <hi rend=italics>Lambeth</hi> in <datestruct value="1646--"><year reg="1646">1646</year></datestruct>, <num value="2">two</num> years after the execution of archbishop <hi rend=italics>Laud;</hi> when, probably fearing for their safety in times so inimical to learning, Mr. <hi rend=italics>Selden</hi> suggested to the university of <hi rend=italics>Cambridge</hi> their right to them; and the whole were delivered into their possession. On the Restoration, archbishop <hi rend=italics>Juxon</hi> demanded the return of the library; which was repeated by his successor <hi rend=italics>Sheldon,</hi> as founded on the will of the pious founder; and they were restored accordingly. Archbishop <hi rend=italics>Sheldon</hi> added a considerable number: and archbishop <hi rend=italics>Tenison</hi> augmented it with part of his books.
<p>THAT very worthy prelate archbishop <hi rend=italics>Secker,</hi> besides a considerable sum expended in making catalogues to the old registers of the see, left to the library all such books from his own as were not in the former, which comprehended much the largest and most valuable part of his own collection. <pb id="p.30" n="30">
<p>ARCHBISHOP <hi rend=italics>Cornwallis</hi> bestowed many valuable books in his life-time. And the present archbishop has given a considerable sum for fitting up a proper repository for the valuable collection of manuscripts. The whole number of printed books amounts to <num value="25000">twenty-five thousand</num>.
<p>THE other apartments have within these few <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Gallery.</NOTE> years received considerable improvements. The great gallery, which is nearly <num value="90">ninety</num> feet long by <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet <num value="9">nine</num> inches broad, has lately had the addition of a bow window, by the<note>The right reverend <hi rend=italics>John Moore</hi> died in <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>, and was succeeded by Dr. <hi rend=italics>Charles Manners Sutton,</hi> who has followed the liberal example of his predecessors in the augmentation of the library and the general improvement of the archiepiscopal residence.

Among these distinguished characters, <hi rend=italics>Katherine Parr</hi> has <pb id="p.31" n="31"> found a place, and not without just clame; it being reasonable to suppose, but for the death of her tyrant, she would have been devoted to the stake for the favor she bore to the reformed religion.

Zoology was in their time but in a low state, and credulity far from being extinguished: among the eggs is <num value="1">one</num> supposed to have been of the <hi rend=italics>dragon,</hi> and another of the <hi rend=italics>griffin.</hi> You might have found here <num value="2">two</num> feathers of the tail of the <hi rend=italics>ph&oelig;nix,</hi> and the claw of the <hi rend=italics>ruck,</hi> a bird able to <hi rend=italics>trusse an elephant.</hi> Notwithstanding this, the collection was extremely valuable, especially in <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Their Garden.</NOTE> the vegetable kingdom. In his garden, at his house in <hi rend=italics>South Lambeth,</hi> was an amazing arrangement of trees, plants, and flowers. It seems to have been particularly rich in those of the east, and of <hi rend=italics>North America.</hi> His merit and assiduity must have been very great; for the eastern traveller must have labored under great difficulties from the barbarity of the country; and <hi rend=italics>North America</hi> had in his time been but recently settled. <pb id="p.39" n="39"> Yet we find the names of numbers of trees and plants still among the rarer of much later times. To him we are also indebted for the luxury of many fine fruits; for, as <hi rend=italics>Parkinson</hi> observed, &ldquo;The choysest for goodnesse, and rarest for knowledge, are to be had of my very good friend Master <hi rend=italics>John Tradescante,</hi> who hath wonderly labored to obtaine all the rarest fruits hee can heare off in any place of <hi rend=italics>Christendome, Turky,</hi> yea, or the whole world.&rdquo;<note><hi rend=italics>Parkinson's Paradisus Terrestris,</hi> p. <num value="575">575</num>.</NOTE> He lived at a large house in this parish, and had an extensive garden, much visited in his days. After his death, which happened about the year <datestruct value="1652"><year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct>, his collection came into the possession of the famous <hi rend=italics>Elias Ashmole,</hi> by virtue of a deed of gift which Mr. <hi rend=italics>Tradescant,</hi> junior, had made to him of all his rarities, in true astrological form, being dated <hi rend=italics>December</hi> <num value="16">16</num>, <datestruct value="1657--"><year reg="1657">1657</year></datestruct>, <num value="5">5</num> <hi rend=italics>hor.</hi> <num value="30">30</num> minutes <hi rend=italics>post merid.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Ashmole's</hi> Diary, <num value="36">36</num>.</NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Ashmole</hi> also purchased the house, which is still in being; the garden fell to decay.

The collection of curiosities were removed <pb id="p.40" n="40"> by Mr. <hi rend=italics>Ashmole,</hi> to his <hi rend=italics>Museum</hi> at <hi rend=italics>Oxford,</hi> where they are carefully preserved. Many very curious articles are to be seen: among others, several original dresses and weapons of the <hi rend=italics>North Americans,</hi> in their original state; which may in some period prove serviceable in illustrating their manners and antiquities.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Monument Described.</NOTE> THE monument of the <hi rend=italics>Tradescants</hi> was erected in <datestruct value="1662--"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>, by <hi rend=italics>Hester,</hi> relict of the younger. It is an altar tomb: at each corner is cut a large tree, seeming to support the slab: at <num value="1">one</num> end is an <hi rend=italics>hydra</hi> picking at a bare scull, possibly designed as an emblem of Envy: on the other end are the arms of the family: on <num value="1">one</num> side are ruins, <hi rend=italics>Grecian</hi> pillars, and capitals; an obelisk and pyramid, to denote the extent of his travels: and on the opposite, a crocodile, and various shells, expressive of his attention to the study of natural history. Time had greatly injured this monument; but in <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct> it was handsomely restored, at the expence of the parish; and the inscription, which was originally designed for it, engraven on the stone. As it is both singular and historical, I present it to the reader.

<p>FROM <hi rend=italics>Lambeth</hi> I returned by the water-side, near the end of <hi rend=italics>Westminster</hi>-bridge, along a tract once a dreary marsh, and still in parts called <hi rend=italics>Lambeth</hi> marsh; about the year <datestruct value="1560"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>, there was <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Lambeth Marsh.</placename></NOTE> not a house on it, from <hi rend=italics>Lambeth</hi> palace as far as <hi rend=italics>Southwark.</hi> Sir <hi rend=italics>William Dugdale</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Dugdale's</hi> Embankments, p. <num value="67">67</num>.</NOTE> makes <pb id="p.42" n="42"> frequent mention of the works for securing it, in old times, by embankments or <hi rend=italics>walls</hi> as they are styled, to restrain the ravages of the tide. The embankments in <hi rend=italics>Southwark</hi> must have been the work of the <hi rend=italics>Romans,</hi> otherwise they never could have erected the buildings or made the roads of which such frequent vestiges have been found. Most of this tract is become firm land, and covered with most useful buildings even to the edge of <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Mrs. Coade's Artificial Stone.</placename></NOTE> the river. In a street called <hi rend=italics>Narrow Wall</hi> (from <num value="1">one</num> of the antient embankments) is Mrs. <hi rend=italics>Coade's</hi> manufactory of artificial stone. Her repository consists of several very large rooms filled with every ornament which can be used in architecture. The statue, the vase, the urn, the rich chimneypiece, and, in a few words, every thing which could be produced out of natural stone or marble by the most elegant chissel, is here to be obtained at an easy rate. Proof has been made of its durable quality. A beautiful font, the ornament of <hi rend=italics>Debden</hi> church in <hi rend=italics>Essex,</hi> formed of this material on a most admirable antique model, was given to it by the liberality of <hi rend=italics>Richard Muilman Trench Chiswell,</hi> esq; and is the admiration of every person of taste.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>English Wines;</NOTE> NOTWITHSTANDING the climate of <hi rend=italics>Great Britain</hi> has, at lest of late years, been unfavorable to the production of wines: yet, in the year <datestruct value="1635"><year reg="1635">1635</year></datestruct>, we began to make some from the raisins or dried <pb id="p.43" n="43"> grapes of <hi rend=italics>Spain</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Portugal. Francis Chamberlayne</hi> made the attempt, and obtained a patent for <num value="14">fourteen</num> years, in which it is alleged that his wines would keep good during several years, and even in a voyage under the very line.<note><hi rend=italics>Rymer's F&oelig;dera,</hi> xix. <num value="719">719</num>.</NOTE> The art was most successfully revived, several years ago, by <hi rend=italics>Mark Beaufoy,</hi> and the foreign wines most admirably mimicked. Such is the prodigality and luxury of the age, that the demand for many sorts exceeds in a great degree the produce of the native vineyards. We have skilful fabricators, who kindly supply our wants. It has been estimated, that half of the port, and <num value="5">five</num>-sixths of the white wines consumed in our capital, have been the produce of our home wine-presses. The product of duty to the state from a single house, was in <num value="1">one</num> year, from <hi rend=italics>July</hi> <num value="5">5th</num>, <datestruct value="1785--"><year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct>, to <hi rend=italics>July</hi> <num value="5">5th</num>, <datestruct value="1786--"><year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct>, not less than <num value="7363">7,363</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="9">9</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="8.50">8 1/2</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> The genial banks of the <hi rend=italics>Thames</hi> opposite to our capital, yield almost every species of white wine; and, by a wondrous magic, Messrs. <hi rend=italics>Beaufoy</hi> pour forth the materials for the rich <hi rend=italics>Frontignac</hi> to the more elegant tables; the <hi rend=italics>Madeira,</hi> the <hi rend=italics>Calcavella,</hi> and the <hi rend=italics>Lisbon,</hi> into every part of the kingdom.
<p>THIS great work, and that for making vinegar, <NOTE PLACE=MARG>And Vinegar.</NOTE> are at a small distance from Mrs. <hi rend=italics>Coade's.</hi> I can scarcely say how much I was struck with the <pb id="p.44" n="44"> extent of the undertaking. There is a magnificence of business, in this ocean of sweets and sours, that cannot fail exciting the greatest admiration: whether we consider the number of vessels, <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Great Tons.</NOTE> or their size. The boasted ton at <hi rend=italics>Heydelberg</hi> does not surpass them. On <num value="1">first</num> entering the yard, <num value="2">two</num> rise before you, covered at the top with a thatched dome; between them is a circular turret, including a winding staircase, which brings you to their summits, which are above twentyfour feet in diameter. <num value="1">One</num> of these conservatories is full of sweet wine, and contains <num value="58019">fifty-eight thousand one hundred and nine</num> gallons; or eighteen <num value="115">hundred and fifteen</num> barrels of <hi rend=italics>Winchester</hi> measure. Its superb associate is full of vinegar, to the amount of <num value="56799">fifty-six thousand seven hundred and ninety-nine</num> gallons, or <num value="1700">seventeen hundred</num> and <num value="74">seventy-four</num> barrels, of the same standard as the former. The famous <hi rend=italics>German</hi> vessel yields even to the last by the quantity of <num value="40">forty</num> barrels.<note>According to Mr. <hi rend=italics>Keysler,</hi> the <hi rend=italics>Heydelberg</hi> vessel holds <num value="24">two hundred and four</num> tons.</NOTE>
<p>BESIDES these, is an avenue of lesser vessels, which hold from <num value="32500">thirty-two thousand five hundred</num>, to <num value="16974">sixteen thousand nine hundred and seventy-four</num> gallons each. After quitting this <hi rend=italics>Brobdignagian</hi> scene, we pass to the acres covered with common barrels: we cannot diminish our <pb id="p.45" n="45"> ideas so suddenly, but at <num value="1">first</num> we imagined we could quaff them off as easily as <hi rend=italics>Gulliver</hi> did the little hogsheads of the kingdom of <hi rend=italics>Lilliput.</hi>

<p>THIS ground, so profitable to the proprietors, and so productive of revenue to the state, was in my memory the scene of low dissipation. Here <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Cuper's Garden.</placename></NOTE> stood <hi rend=italics>Cuper's Garden,</hi> once noted for its fireworks, and for the great resort of the profligate of both sexes. This place was ornamented with several of the mutilated statues belonging to <hi rend=italics>Thomas</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Arundel,</hi> which had been for that purpose begged from his lordship by <num value="1">one</num> <hi rend=italics>Boyder Cuper,</hi> a gardener in the family.<note><hi rend=italics>Howard's</hi> Memoirs, <num value="98">98</num>.</NOTE> The more valuable of them were bought by lord <hi rend=italics>Lemster,</hi> father of the <num value="1">first</num> earl of <hi rend=italics>Pomfret,</hi> and presented by the earl's widow to the university of <hi rend=italics>Oxford.</hi> These grounds were then rented by lord <hi rend=italics>Arundel.</hi> On the pulling down of <hi rend=italics>Arundel-house,</hi> to make way for the street of that name, these, and several others of the damaged part of the collection, were removed to this place. Numbers were left on the ground, near the river-side, and overwhelmed with the rubbish brought from the foundation of the new church of <hi rend=italics>St. Paul's.</hi> These in aftertimes were discovered, dug up, and conveyed to the seat of the duke of <hi rend=italics>Norfolk,</hi> at <hi rend=italics>Worksop</hi> manor. Injured as they are, they appear, from the <pb id="p.46" n="46"> etchings given by Doctor <hi rend=italics>Ducarel,</hi> to have had great merit.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Great Timber-Yards.</placename></NOTE> THE great timber-yards, beneath which these antiquities were found, are very well worthy of a visit. <num value="1">One</num> would fear that the forests of <hi rend=italics>Norway</hi> and the <hi rend=italics>Baltic</hi> would be exhausted, to supply the want of our overgrown capital, were we not assured, that the resources will successively be increasing equal to the demand of succeeding ages.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>St. George's Fields.</placename></NOTE> TO the south are <hi rend=italics>St. George's Fields,</hi> now the wonder of foreigners approaching our capital, through avenues of lamps, and by a road of magnificent breadth and goodness.

The neighboring marsh of <hi rend=italics>Lambeth</hi> was in the last century overflowed with water: but <hi rend=italics>St. George's Fields</hi> might, owing to their distance from the river, admit of a temporary encampment.
<p>ON approaching <hi rend=italics>St. George's Fields</hi> from <hi rend=italics>Westminster</hi>-bridge <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Westminster Lying--in Hospital.</placename></NOTE> are <num value="2">two</num> charities of uncommon delicacy and utility. The <num value="1">first</num> is the <hi rend=italics>Westminster Lying in Hospital.</hi> This is not instituted merely for the honest matron, who can depose her burthen with the consciousness of lawful love, but also for the unhappy wretches whom some villain, in the unguarded moment, hath seduced, and then left a prey to desertion of friends, poverty, want, and guilt. Least such &ldquo;may be driven to despair by such complicated misery, and be tempted to destroy themselves, and murder their infants,&rdquo;<note>See the account of the institution.</NOTE> here was founded, in <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, <pb id="p.48" n="48"> this humane preventative <hi rend=italics>The Westminster New Lying--in Hospital.</hi> To obviate all objection to its being an encouragement to vice, no <num value="1">one</num> is taken in a <num value="2">second</num> time: but this most excellent charity is open to the worthy distressed matron as often as necessity requires. None are rejected who have friends to recommend them. And of both descriptions upwards of <num value="4000">four thousand</num> have experienced its salutary effects.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Asylum, or House of Refuge.</placename></NOTE> FARTHER on is another institution of a most heavenly nature, calculated to save from perdition of soul and body, the brighter part of the creation: such on whom Providence hath bestowed angelic faces and elegant forms, designed as blessings to mankind, but too often debased to the vilest uses. The hazard that these innocents constantly are liable to, from a <num value="1000">thousand</num> temptations, from poverty, from death of parents, from the diabolical procuress, and often from the stupendous wickedness of parents themselves, who have been known to sell their beauteous girls for the purpose of prostitution, induced a worthy band to found, in the year <datestruct value="1758"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct>, the <hi rend=italics>Asylum,</hi> or <hi rend=italics>House of Refuge.</hi> Long may it flourish, and eternal be the reward of those into whose minds so amiable a conception may have entered!

<p>THE <hi rend=italics>King's-bench</hi> prison, in this parish, is of <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>King's bench Prison.</placename></NOTE> great antiquity. To this prison was committed <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> prince of <hi rend=italics>Wales,</hi> afterwards <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> V. by the spirited and honest judge <hi rend=italics>Gascoigne,</hi> for striking or insulting him on the bench. It is difficult to say which we should admire most, the courage of the judge, or the peaceful submission of the prince to the commitment, after he was freed from the phrenzy of his rage. The truth of the fact has been doubted; but, it is delivered by several grave historians, such as <hi rend=italics>Hall,</hi> who died in <datestruct value="1547--"><year reg="1547">1547</year></datestruct>, who mentions it <hi rend=italics>folio</hi> <num value="1">1</num>; <hi rend=italics>Grafton,</hi> perhaps his copyist, at p. <num value="443">443</num>; and the learned Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Elyot,</hi> a favorite of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. in his book called <hi rend=italics>The Governour,</hi> relates the same in p. <num value="102">102</num>, book ii. c. <num value="6">6</num>. of that treatise.

The reform of this great prince was very early: for I never can believe him to have been a hypocrite when he wrote in the strain of piety to his father, on the subject of a victory obtained at <hi rend=italics>Usk,</hi> over the famous <hi rend=italics>Glyndwr.</hi><note>Tour in <hi rend=italics>Wales,</hi> i. <num value="369">369</num>. ed. <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>. vol. iii. p. <num value="362">362</num>.</NOTE> He was at that time only <num value="17">seventeen</num> years of age, and it appears that he quitted his follies long before the period in which the persisting in them becomes disgraceful to the prince or to the subject.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Guy's Hospital.</placename></NOTE> MR. <hi rend=italics>Guy,</hi> not satisfied with his great benefactions to the hospital of <hi rend=italics>St. Thomas,</hi> determined to be the sole founder of another. The relation is very remarkable. At the age of <num value="76">seventy-six</num>, he took a lease, of the governors of the former, of a piece of ground opposite to it, for the term of <num value="999">nine hundred and ninety-nine</num> years, and on it, in <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>, at the expence of <num value="18793">18,793</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="16">16</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> began to build the hospital which bears his name: and left to endow it, the prodigious sum of <num value="219499">219,499</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> amassed from a very small beginning, chiefly by purchasing seamen's tickets! in the reign of queen <hi rend=italics>Anne;</hi> and by his great success in buying and selling South Sea stock, in the memorable year <datestruct value="1720"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>; and (ostensively) by the sale of bibles!&mdash; he seems to have profited both of GOD and <hi rend=italics>Mammon.</hi>

<p>HE was the son of an <hi rend=italics>Anabaptist</hi> lighterman and coal-monger, in <hi rend=italics>Southwark.</hi> On the death of his father, his mother brought him to <hi rend=italics>Tamworth,</hi> her native town; and at a fit age bound him <pb id="p.71" n="71"> apprentice to a bookbinder and bookseller, in <hi rend=italics>Cheapside.</hi> On the expiration of his term, he set up for himself with the small sum of <measure value="200l." type=currency><num value="200">two hundred</num> pounds</measure>. He joined with a set of booksellers, who carried on a trade in bibles, printed in, and smuggled out of <hi rend=italics>Holland,</hi> to the great injury of the lawful printers. This was done for a considerable time; till the king's printers, by several prosecutions and seizures, obliged these illicit traders to desist. <hi rend=italics>Guy,</hi> more artful and more pertinacious than his late partners, prevaled on the university of <hi rend=italics>Oxford</hi> to contract with him for their privilege of printing bibles. But it is generally supposed that his great wealth was acquired by those articles in which Heaven most certainly had no concern. Attached to <hi rend=italics>Tamworth,</hi> he founded there an almshouse and a library; and left a perpetual annuity of <num value="125">125</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> for their maintenance, as well as for apprenticing poor children belonging to the town; which chose him for <num value="1">one</num> of its representatives.<note><hi rend=italics>Maitland,</hi> ii. <datestruct value="1306--"><year reg="1306">1306</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> His death happened on <hi rend=italics>December</hi> <num value="27">27th</num>, <datestruct value="1724--"><year reg="1724">1724</year></datestruct>, in the <num value="80">80th</num> year of his age; before which he saw his hospital covered with the roof. In the <num value="1">first</num> court is his statue in brass, dressed in his livery gown. Besides his public expences, he gave, during life, to many of his poor relations, <num value="10">10</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> or <num value="20">20</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> a year; and to <pb id="p.72" n="72"> others money to advance them in life; he bequeathed to his aged relations, <num value="870">870</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> in annuities; and to his younger relations and executors, the sum of <num value="75589">75,589</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>!!!<note>He also bequeathed to <hi rend=italics>Christ's</hi> Hospital an annuity of <num value="400">400</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> for receiving <num value="4">four</num> children, yearly; and <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> for discharging poor prisoners within the city and counties of <hi rend=italics>Middlesex</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Surrey,</hi> who could be released for <num value="5">5</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> In consequence of this legacy, above <num value="600">six hundred</num> persons have obtained their liberty. ED.</NOTE>
<p>IN the chapel (shouldering <emph rend=caps>God's</emph> altar) is another statue of Mr. <hi rend=italics>Guy,</hi> a most elegant performance, by Mr. <hi rend=italics>J.

He is represented standing, in his livery gown, with <num value="1">one</num> hand raising a miserable sick object, and with the other pointing to a <num value="2">second</num> object, on a bier, carried by <num value="2">two</num> persons into his hospital. This superfluity cost a <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">thousand</num> pounds</measure>; a proof of the exuberant wealth of the foundation, which could spare such a sum to be wasted on a needless occasion. I was told that at this time there were only <num value="200">two hundred</num> beds: <num value="3">three</num> wards being out of use, undergoing certain alterations. But I could not obtain the lest account of the annual number of patients, or of the expenditure, or revenue; which other hospitals never fail to lay before the public.

He gives little information respecting its <hi rend=italics>present</hi> state, more than that the officers are numerous, that there is a <hi rend=italics>small</hi> neat building for lunatics, <num value="13">thirteen</num> wards, and <num value="411">four hundred and eleven</num> beds.

<p>MR. <hi rend=italics>Maitland</hi> obtained a <hi rend=italics>septenary</hi> account of the patients admitted into this hospital between the years <datestruct value="1728--"><year reg=1728>1728</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1734--"><year reg=1734>1734</year></datestruct>, by which we learn, that in the <num value="7">seven</num> years they amounted to <num value="12402">12,402</num>; and that the total disbursements in the year <datestruct value="1738"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct> amounted to <measure value="7978l." type=currency><num value="7978">seven thousand nine hundred and seventy-eight</num> pounds</measure>: and then the house contained <num value="12">twelve</num> wards, and <num value="400">four hundred</num> and thirtyfive beds.

<p>THE conventual church was then pulled down by Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Pope,</hi> who built a magnificent house on the site.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Church of St. Mary Magdalen.</placename></NOTE> THE present parochial church of <hi rend=italics>St. Mary Magdalen</hi> was founded by the priors of <hi rend=italics>Bermondsey,</hi> for the use of their adjoining tenants.
<p>THE remains of antiquity in this neighborhood are, the antient gate of the Abbey, with a large arch and a postern on <num value="1">one</num> side.

If the dock was deepened, and correspondent wharfs were erected, sloops and smaller vessels might come from different sea-ports, and here discharge their cargoes, without the expence of re-loading lesser craft, in order to reland them at this dock. It antiently belonged to the priory of <hi rend=italics>St. Saviour's Bermondsey,</hi> as did certain adjacent mills, which in <datestruct value="1536--"><year reg="1536">1536</year></datestruct> were let by the monks to <num value="1">one</num> <hi rend=italics>John Curlew,</hi> for <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> then the value of eighteen quarters of good wheat; and he was besides bound to grind <hi rend=italics>gratis</hi> all the corn used in that religious house.

<p>As the <hi rend=italics>Borough High-street</hi> was the great passage into a great part of our kingdom, to and from our capital, it was particularly well furnished with inns.

The use is now transferred to the Heralds. This was the rendezvous of the jolly pilgrims, who formed the troop which our father of poetry describes sallying out to pay its devotions to the great <hi rend=italics>St. Thomas Becket,</hi> who for a long time superseded almost every other <hi rend=italics>Saint.</hi>

<p>The memory of our great poet's pilgrimage is perpetuated by an inscription over the gateway: &ldquo;This is the inn where Sir <hi rend=italics>Jeffry Chaucer,</hi> and <pb id="p.79" n="79"> <num value="9">nine</num> and <num value="20">twenty</num> pilgrims, lodged, in their journey to <hi rend=italics>Canterbury,</hi> in <datestruct value="1383--"><year reg="1383">1383</year></datestruct>.&rdquo;

<emph>WESTMINSTER.</emph>

<p>I NOW return to the extremity of the western part of our capital, on the northern bank of the river. In the time of queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth,</hi> the shore opposite to <hi rend=italics>Lambeth</hi> was a mere marshy tract. <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Mill-Bank.</placename></NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Mill-bank,</hi> the last dwelling in <hi rend=italics>Westminster,</hi> is a large house, which took its name from a mill which once occupied its site. Here, in my boyish days, I often experienced the hospitality of the late Sir <hi rend=italics>Robert Grovenor,</hi><note>Grandfather to the present <hi rend=italics>Robert</hi> earl <hi rend=italics>Grosvenor.</hi> ED.</NOTE> its worthy owner, by an ancestor of whom, it was purchased from the <hi rend=italics>Mordaunts,</hi> earls of <hi rend=italics>Peterborough.</hi> All the rest of his vast property about <hi rend=italics>London</hi> devolved on him in right of his mother, <hi rend=italics>Mary,</hi> daughter and heiress of <hi rend=italics>Alexander Davies</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Ebury,</hi> in the county of <hi rend=italics>Middlesex.</hi> I find, in the plan of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> by <hi rend=italics>Hollar,</hi> a mansion on this spot, under the name of <hi rend=italics>Peterborough</hi>-house. It probably was built by the <num value="1">first</num> earl of <hi rend=italics>Peterborough.</hi> It was inhabited by his successors, and retained its name till the time of the death of that great but <pb id="p.81" n="81"> irregular genius <hi rend=italics>Charles,</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Peterborough,</hi> in <datestruct value="1735--"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>. It was rebuilt in its present form by the <hi rend=italics>Grovenor</hi> family.
<p>A LITTLE farther was the antient <hi rend=italics>Horse-ferry</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Horseferry.</placename></NOTE> between <hi rend=italics>Westminster</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Lambeth:</hi> suppressed on the building of <hi rend=italics>Westminster</hi>-bridge. The ferry having been the property of the archbishops of <hi rend=italics>Canterbury,</hi> they were allowed the sum of <num value="3000">3,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> which was funded.
<p>A LITTLE beyond the <hi rend=italics>Horse-ferry</hi> stands the <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>St. John the Evangelist's.</placename></NOTE> church of <hi rend=italics>St. John the Evangelist,</hi> <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="50">fifty</num> voted by parlement, to give this part of the town the air of the capital of a Christian country. It was begun in <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>, and finished in <datestruct value="1728--"><year reg="1728">1728</year></datestruct>. The architect was Mr. <hi rend=italics>Archer,</hi> but Sir <hi rend=italics>John Vanbrugh</hi> has usually the discredit of this pile.<note>For this, and a number of other corrections and additions, I am obliged to the MS. notes of Mr. GRAY, in an interleaved copy of <hi rend=italics>London and its Environs,</hi> which I had the honor of perusing, by the favor of the Earl of HARCOURT.</NOTE> Notwithstanding it is deservedly censured for its load of ornaments, they are by no means destitute of beauty. The aim at excess of magnificence is not a fault peculiar to the builder.
<p>AT a small distance to the east is that noble <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Westminster Abbey.</placename></NOTE> specimen of gothic architecture, the conventual church of <hi rend=italics>St. Peter's</hi> Abbey of <hi rend=italics>Westminster.</hi> The church is said to have been founded about the <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Founded by Sebert.</NOTE> year <datestruct value="610"><year reg="610">610</year></datestruct>, by <hi rend=italics>Sebert</hi> king of the <hi rend=italics>East-Saxons,</hi> on <pb id="p.82" n="82"> the ruins of the temple of <hi rend=italics>Apollo,</hi> flung down, quoth legend, by an earthquake. The king dedicated his new church to <hi rend=italics>St. Peter;</hi> who descended in person, with a host of heavenly choristers, to save the bishop, <hi rend=italics>Mellitus,</hi> the trouble of consecration. The saint descended on the <hi rend=italics>Surry</hi> side, in a stormy night; but, prevaling on <hi rend=italics>Edric,</hi> a fisherman, to waft him over, performed the ceremony: and, as a proof, left behind the chrism, and precious droppings of the wax candles, with which the astonished fisherman saw the church illuminated. He conveyed the saint safely back; who directed him to inform the bishop that there was no farther need of consecration. He likewise directed <hi rend=italics>Edric</hi> to fling out his nets, who was rewarded with a miraculous draught of salmons: the saint also promised to the fisherman and his successors, that they never should want plenty of salmon, provided they presented every <num value="10">tenth</num> to his church. This custom was observed till at lest the year <datestruct value="1382"><year reg="1382">1382</year></datestruct>. The fisherman that day had a right to sit at the same table with the prior; and he might demand of the cellarer, ale and bread; and the cellarer again might take of the fish's tail as much as he could, with <num value="4">four</num> fingers and his thumb erect.
<p>THE place in which it was built was then styled <hi rend=italics>Thornie</hi> island, from its being over-run with thorns and briers; and it was besides insulated <pb id="p.83" n="83"> by a branch of the <hi rend=italics>Thames.</hi> Part of the insulation seems to remain. It commences a little above the old bridge at <hi rend=italics>Chelsea,</hi> leading to <hi rend=italics>Jenny's Whim,</hi> and the secondary stream supplies <hi rend=italics>Chelsea</hi> water-works.<note>According to <hi rend=italics>Maitland, Thorney</hi> island was effected by a branch of the <hi rend=italics>Thames,</hi> which entered from the east at the spot in <hi rend=italics>Channel</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Canon</hi>-row, where <hi rend=italics>Manchester</hi>-buildings now stand, and running westward, intersected <hi rend=italics>King</hi>-street, then followed <hi rend=italics>Gardener's</hi>-lane, <hi rend=italics>Prince's</hi>-street, and <hi rend=italics>College</hi>-street, till it was re-united with the river. The editor of <hi rend=italics>Smith's</hi> antiquities of <hi rend=italics>Westminster</hi> fixes its commencement farther north, to a spot adjoining the southern end of the present <hi rend=italics>Privy</hi>-gardens, the boundary of the antient palace of <hi rend=italics>Whitehall.</hi> ED.</NOTE> This church was burnt by the <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Burnt by the Danes. Rebuilt by Edgar.</NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Danes;</hi> and restored by the incontinent king <hi rend=italics>Edgar,</hi> in <num value="958">958</num>, under the influence of <hi rend=italics>St. Dunstan,</hi> the most continent of men, and such a lover of celibacy that he drove out of the church every married priest. <hi rend=italics>Edgar</hi> ravished nuns: but he founded or re-founded <num value="50">fifty</num> monasteries, and planted, with very poor endowments, in this, <num value="12">twelve</num> monks of the <hi rend=italics>Benedictine</hi> order.
<p>IT was reserved for the pious Confessor to rebuild <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Again by Edward the Confessor.</NOTE> both church and Abbey; he began the work in <datestruct value="1049--"><year reg="1049">1049</year></datestruct>, and finished it in a most magnificent manner in <datestruct value="1066--"><year reg="1066">1066</year></datestruct>, and endowed it with the utmost munificence. An Abbey is nothing without reliques. <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Reliques.</NOTE> Here was to be found the veil, and some of the milk of the Virgin: the blade-bone of <hi rend=italics>St. Benedict:</hi> the finger of <hi rend=italics>St. Alphage:</hi> the head of <hi rend=italics>St.</hi>
<pb id="p.84" n="84"> <hi rend=italics>Maxilla:</hi> and half the jaw-bone of <hi rend=italics>St. Anastasia.</hi> The good <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> was buried in his own church. <hi rend=italics>William</hi> the Conqueror bestowed on his tomb a rich pall: and in <datestruct value="1163--"><year reg="1163">1163</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> II. lodged his body in a costly ferretry, translating it from its pristine place.
<p>THIS church had been a noted sanctuary, and was <num value="1">one</num> of those exempted from suppression by <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. <hi rend=italics>Stow</hi> thinks that the privilege was granted to this church by its founder, king <hi rend=italics>Sebert.</hi> That venerable and able antiquary the Reverend Mr. <hi rend=italics>Pegge,</hi> supposes that it only took place after the canonization of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> the Confessor, in <datestruct value="1198--"><year reg="1198">1198</year></datestruct>. I refer to his elaborate work on the subject of sanctuaries, in the <num value="8">eighth</num> volume of the <hi rend=italics>Archaeologia.</hi> I shall only mention a very remarkable instance of a most sacrilegious violation of the privilege in this very church: in which, in the year <datestruct value="1378"><year reg="1378">1378</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>Robert Haule,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>John Schakel,</hi> esquires, had taken refuge, for no other reason than to save their persons from the rage of <hi rend=italics>John</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Gaunt</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>Lancaster,</hi> for refusing to deliver to him a <hi rend=italics>French</hi> hostage, to whose ransom they had a right. The duke sent here <num value="50">fifty</num> armed men. They <num value="1">first</num> seduced <hi rend=italics>Schakel</hi> from the sanctuary. <hi rend=italics>Haule</hi> refused to confide in their promises; but remained at the altar, attending at high mass. <hi rend=italics>Haule</hi> made a manful resistance with his short sword, and drove them into the chancel, <pb id="p.85" n="85"> where he was slain. In his last words he recommended himself to God, the avenger of such injuries; and to the liberty of our holy mother the church. With him was murdered his servant, and a monk who had entreated the assassins not to violate the holiness of the place. <hi rend=italics>Haule</hi> was interred in the Abbey. Part of an inscription, relative to this cruel act, was remaining on a brass, in the time of <hi rend=italics>Weever.</hi><note>Funeral Monuments, <num value="484">484</num>, <num value="5">5</num>.</NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Sudbury,</hi> archbishop of <hi rend=italics>Canterbury,</hi> made complaint in parlement of this breach of privilege. The church was shut about <num value="4">four</num> months, till it was purified from the profanation. The offenders were excommunicated, a large sum of money paid to the church, and all its privileges confirmed in the next parlement.
<p>EITHER from the decay of the building, or a <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Rebuilt A <num value="3">Third</num> Time by Henry Iii.</NOTE> particular zeal and affection which <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> III. had for the royal <hi rend=italics>Confessor,</hi> that prince pulled down the <hi rend=italics>Saxon</hi> pile, and rebuilt it in its present elegant and magnificent form. In <datestruct value="1245--"><year reg="1245">1245</year></datestruct> he undertook this great work, in the mode of architecture which began to take place in his days, but did not carry it on farther than <num value="4">four</num> arches west of the middle tower; and the vaulting of this was not finished till <datestruct value="1296"><year reg="1296">1296</year></datestruct>. He did not live to complete his design, which was carried on by his successor. It advanced slowly in succeeding reigns, and, <pb id="p.86" n="86"> from the portcullis on the roof of the last arches, it appears that <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VII. or VIII. contributed to the repairs, that being the device of those monarchs. It was never finished: the great tower, and <num value="2">two</num> western towers, remaining incomplete at the Reformation; after which the <num value="2">two</num> present towers arose. That in the centre is wanting. A casual fire had long before destroyed the roof; but by the piety of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> and several of the abbots it was restored to the beauty and splendor we so justly admire.
<p>HENRY III. performed <num value="2">two</num> acts of pious respect to the remains of the founders of this Abbey, which must not be omitted. He translated those of <hi rend=italics>Sebert</hi> into a tomb of touchstone, beneath an arch made in the wall. Above were paintings, long since defaced, done by order of the king, who was strongly imbued with the love of the arts; Mr. <hi rend=italics>Walpole</hi><note>Anecdotes of Painting, <num value="1">1</num>, <num value="2">2</num>, &amp; seq.</NOTE> has preserved several of the precepts for a number of paintings in this church, and other places. Among them are directions for painting <hi rend=italics>duos</hi> CHERUMBINOS <hi rend=italics>cum hilari vultu et jocoso.</hi>

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Shrine of Edward the Confessor, by Cavalini.</NOTE> BUT what does that prince the most honor is the shrine,<note>Engraven by Mr. <hi rend=italics>Vertue,</hi> and published among the <hi rend=italics>Vetusta Monumenta,</hi> tab. xvi.</NOTE> which he caused to be made in honor of the <hi rend=italics>Confessor,</hi> placed in a chapel which bears <pb id="p.87" n="87"> his name. This beautiful mosaic work was the performance of <hi rend=italics>Peter Cavalini,</hi> inventor of that species of ornament. It is supposed that he was brought into <hi rend=italics>England</hi> by the abbot <hi rend=italics>Ware,</hi> who visited <hi rend=italics>Rome</hi> in <datestruct value="1256--"><year reg="1256">1256</year></datestruct>. <hi rend=italics>Weever</hi> expressly says, &ldquo;He brought from thence certain workmen, and rich porphery stones, whereof hee made that curious, singular, rare pavement before the high altar; and with these stones and workmen he did also frame the shrine of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> the Confessor.&rdquo;<note>Funeral Monuments, <num value="485">485</num>.</NOTE> This beautiful memorial consists of <num value="3">three</num> rows of arches; the lower pointed, the upper round: and on each side of the lower is a most elegant twisted pillar, an ornament the artist seems peculiarly fond of. Children, or childish age, have greatly injured this beautiful shrine, by picking out the mosaic, through the shameful connivance of the attendant vergers.
<p>ROUND this chapel are <num value="12">twelve</num> other chapels, all built by <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> III. They were an afterthought, and formed no part of the original design. Before this shrine seem to have been offered the <hi rend=italics>spolia opima.</hi> The <hi rend=italics>Scotch regalia,</hi> and the sacred chair from <hi rend=italics>Scone,</hi> were offered here; and <hi rend=italics>Alphonso,</hi> <num value="3">third</num> son to <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> I. who died in his childhood, presented the golden coronet of our unfortunate prince the last <hi rend=italics>Llewelyn.</hi>
<pb id="p.88" n="88">
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Another, by the Same artist.</NOTE> THIS is not the only specimen of <hi rend=italics>Cavalini's</hi> skill, which we possess in this kingdom. Mr. <hi rend=italics>Walpole</hi><note>It need scarcely be stated that the Mr. <hi rend=italics>Walpole,</hi> so often referred to, was the celebrated <hi rend=italics>Horace</hi> afterwards earl of <hi rend=italics>Orford.</hi> ED.</NOTE> has, at his beautiful villa near town, another shrine of his workmanship, brought, in <datestruct value="1768--"><year reg="1768">1768</year></datestruct>, from the church of <hi rend=italics>Santa Maria Maggiore,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Rome;</hi> and placed in a chapel in his gardens. It was erected, in <datestruct value="1256--"><year reg="1256">1256</year></datestruct>, over the bodies of the holy martyrs <hi rend=italics>Simplicius, Faustina,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Beatrix,</hi> by <hi rend=italics>John James Capoccio,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Vinia</hi> his wife. It differs in form from the shrine of <hi rend=italics>St. Edward,</hi> but is formed of the same materials, and adorned with the same twisted columns.
<p>ALONG the freeze of the screen of the chapel, are <num value="14">fourteen</num> legendary sculptures respecting the Confessor. They are so rudely done, that we may conclude that the art at this time was at a very low ebb. The <num value="1">first</num> is the trial of queen <hi rend=italics>Emma.</hi> The next the birth of <hi rend=italics>Edward.</hi> Another is his coronation. The <num value="4">fourth</num> tells us how our saint was frightened into the abolition of the <hi rend=italics>dane-gelt,</hi> by seeing the devil dance upon the money bags. The <num value="5">fifth</num> is the story of his winking at the thief who was robbing his treasury. The <num value="6">sixth</num> is meant to relate the appearance of our SAVIOUR to him. The <num value="7">seventh</num> shews how the invasion of <hi rend=italics>England</hi> was frustrated by the drowning of the <hi rend=italics>Danish</hi> king. Eighthly is seen the quarrel between the <pb id="p.89" n="89"> boys <hi rend=italics>Tosti</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Harold,</hi> predicting their respective fates. In the <num value="9">ninth</num> sculpture is the <hi rend=italics>Confessor's</hi> vision of the <num value="7">seven</num> sleepers. Tenthly, how he meets <hi rend=italics>St. John the Evangelist</hi> in the guise of a pilgrim. Eleventhly, how the blind were cured by their eyes being washed in his dirty water. Twelfthly, how <hi rend=italics>St. John</hi> delivers to the pilgrims a ring. In the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> they deliver the ring to the king, which he had unknowingly given to <hi rend=italics>St. John</hi> as an alms, when he met him in the form of a pilgrim. This was attended with a message from the <hi rend=italics>Saint,</hi> foretelling the death of the king. And the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> shews the consequential haste made by him to complete his pious foundation.<note>All these are accurately engraven and fully explained, in the <num value="1">first</num> volume of Mr. <hi rend=italics>Carter's</hi> Antiquities.</NOTE>
<p>IN this very chapel is a <num value="3">third</num> proof of the skill <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Henry III. His Tomb, by the Same.</NOTE> of <hi rend=italics>Cavalini</hi> or some of his pupils. It is an altar tomb of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> himself, enriched like the shrine, and with wreathed columns at each corner.<note>See <hi rend=italics>Sandford's</hi> Genealogies, <num value="92">92</num>.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Dart,</hi> tab. <num value="85">85</num>. vol. ii.&mdash; <hi rend=italics>Gough's</hi> Sepulch. Mon. i. <num value="57">57</num>. tab. xx, xxi.</NOTE> The figure of this prince, who died in <datestruct value="1272--"><year reg="1272">1272</year></datestruct>, is of brass, and placed recumbent. This is supposed to have been the <num value="1">first</num> brazen image known to have been cast in our kingdom. The little book, sold at the door to the visitors of this solemn scenery, will be a sufficient guide to the fine and numerous funebrial <pb id="p.90" n="90"> memorials of the place. Let me only observe, that here may be read an excellent lecture on the progress of these efforts of human skill, from the simple altar tomb to the most ostentatious proofs of human vanity. The humble recumbent figure with uplifted hands, as if deprecating the justice of Heaven for the offences of this mortal state; or the proper kneeling attitude, supplicating that mercy which the purest must stand in need of, may be seen here in various degrees of elegance. The careless lolling attitude of heroes in long gowns and flowing periwigs succeeds; and after them, busts or statues vaunting their merits, and attended with such a train of <hi rend=italics>Pagan</hi> deities, as would almost lead to suppose it a heathen <hi rend=italics>Pantheon</hi> instead of a <hi rend=italics>Christian</hi> church.
<p>AS far as respects the figures on the antient tombs, there is a dull uniformity. They generally are recumbent; often with their hands joined, and erect. If their spouses are placed on their side, as a mark of conjugal affection, the hand of <num value="1">one</num> is clasped in that of the other. Frequently the legs of the hero are crossed, in case he had gained that honorable privilege by the merits of a crusade, and his hand is employed in the menacing action of unsheathing his sword. The sides of the tombs are often embellished with figures of the offspring of the deceased; frequently with figures of mourners, <pb id="p.91" n="91"> <hi rend=italics>pleureurs,</hi> or weepers,<note>See the curious contract, in <hi rend=italics>Dugdale's Warwickshire,</hi> p. <num value="354">354</num>, between the executors of <hi rend=italics>Richard Beauchamp</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Warwick,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>John Essex,</hi> marbler; <hi rend=italics>William Austin,</hi> founder; and <hi rend=italics>Thomas Stevens,</hi> copper-smith; for their making xiv lords and ladyes in divers vestures called <hi rend=italics>weepers,</hi> and xiv images of <hi rend=italics>mourners,</hi> to be gilt by <hi rend=italics>Bartholomew Lambespring, Dutchman,</hi> and goldsmythe of <hi rend=italics>London.</hi></NOTE> generally in monastic habits, as whole convents were wont (and still are accustomed, in <hi rend=italics>Catholic</hi> countries) to pour out their pious inhabitants to form processions at the funerals of the great. In our capital, the fraternity of <hi rend=italics>Augustine Papey,</hi> the threescore priests of <hi rend=italics>Leaden-hall,</hi> and the company of parish-clerks, skilled in singing <hi rend=italics>diriges</hi> and the funeral offices, were accustomed to attend the solemn burials.
<p>TASTELESS as are the figures of the deceased, yet the ornaments above are often in the richest style that the wild unfettered genius of <hi rend=italics>Gothic</hi> architecture could invent; fine and light sculpture of foliage, of animals, or human forms. The monuments of <hi rend=italics>Aymer de Valence</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Pembroke,</hi> who was murdered in <hi rend=italics>France</hi> in <datestruct value="1323--"><year reg="1323">1323</year></datestruct>, and of <hi rend=italics>Edmund Crouchback</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Lancaster,</hi> are magnificent. On the side of these tombs are the figures of the <hi rend=italics>pleureurs,</hi> or mourners, exemplified in numbers of other tombs in this kingdom. Mr. <hi rend=italics>Gough</hi> has favored us with very elegant engravings of both of these, in his splendid work on <hi rend=italics>British</hi> sepulchral monuments. <pb id="p.92" n="92">
<p>IN the reigns of queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>James</hi> I. begins to appear a ray of taste in the sculptors. I shall instance <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="6">six</num> sons of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> lord <hi rend=italics>Norris,</hi> who appear kneeling round his magnificent cenotaph (for he was buried at <hi rend=italics>Rycot</hi>) in the chapel of <hi rend=italics>St. Andrew.</hi> This figure has <num value="1">one</num> hand on his breast, the other a little removed from it; an attitude of devotion, inexpressibly fine, in defiance of the ungraceful dress of the time. Lord <hi rend=italics>Norris</hi> died in <datestruct value="1589--"><year reg="1589">1589</year></datestruct>.<note><hi rend=italics>Dugdale's</hi> Baronage, ii. <num value="404">404</num>.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Dart,</hi> by mistake, calls this nobleman <hi rend=italics>Francis;</hi> who was grandson to <hi rend=italics>Henry,</hi> and left only <num value="1">one</num> child, a daughter. He fell a suicide, in a fit of proud resentment, for an imaginary affront on account of a lord <hi rend=italics>Scrope,</hi> which he had not the sense, or the courage, to accommodate in a proper manner.</NOTE>
<p>ANOTHER proof is in the monument of Sir <hi rend=italics>Francis Vere,</hi> who died in <datestruct value="1608--"><year reg="1608">1608</year></datestruct>, distinguished by <num value="30">thirty</num> years of able service in the Low Countries in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth.</hi> He is represented in a gown recumbent; over him, <num value="4">four</num> fine figures of armed knights, kneeling on <num value="1">one</num> knee, support a marble slab, on which are strewed the various parts of his armour. At <hi rend=italics>Breda</hi> is the tomb of <hi rend=italics>Ingelbert</hi> II. count of <hi rend=italics>Nassau,</hi> who died in <datestruct value="1504--"><year reg="1504">1504</year></datestruct>, executed on the same idea.
<p>THE figure of young <hi rend=italics>Francis Hollis,</hi> son of <hi rend=italics>John</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Clare,</hi> cut off at the age of eighteen, in <datestruct value="1622--"><year reg="1622">1622</year></datestruct>, on his return from a campaign in the <hi rend=italics>Netherlands,</hi> has great merit. He is placed, dressed <pb id="p.93" n="93"> like a <hi rend=italics>Grecian</hi> warrior, on an altar, in a manner that does great credit to <hi rend=italics>Nicholas Stone,</hi> or rather to the earl, to whom Mr. <hi rend=italics>Walpole</hi> justly attributes the design.
<p>The figure of Doctor <hi rend=italics>Busby,</hi> master of <hi rend=italics>Westminster</hi> school, who died in <datestruct value="1695--"><year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>, is elegant and spirited. He lies resting on <num value="1">one</num> arm; a pen in <num value="1">one</num>, a book in the other hand: his countenance looking up. His loose dress is very favorable to the sculptor,<note><hi rend=italics>Francis Bird.</hi> ED.</NOTE> who has given it most graceful flows: the close cap alone is inimical to his art.
<p>I cannot go through the long series of tombs: nor will I attempt, like the <hi rend=italics>Egyptians</hi> of old, to bring the silent inhabitants to a posthumous trial, or draw their frailties to light. I will only mention the crowned heads who here repose, till that day comes which will level every distinction of rank, and shew every individual in his proper character. <hi rend=italics>Qualis erat,</hi> says a beautiful and modest inscription, <hi rend=italics>iste dies indicabit.</hi>

<p>THE <num value="2">second</num> of our monarchs who lies here, is <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Edward I.</NOTE> the renowned <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> I. in an altar tomb, as modest and plain, as his fame was great. A long inscription in monkish lines imperfectly records the deeds of the conqueror of <hi rend=italics>Scotland,</hi> and of the antient <hi rend=italics>Britons.</hi> In <datestruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>, antiquarian curiosity was so urgent with the respectable dean of <hi rend=italics>Westminster,</hi>
<pb id="p.94" n="94"> as to prevale on him to permit certain members of the society, under proper regulations, to inspect the remains of this celebrated hero; and discover, if possible, the composition which gave such duration to the human body. The writs <hi rend=italics>de cera renovanda circa corpus regis Edwardi primi</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Archaeologia,</hi> iii. <num value="376">376</num>, <num value="398">398</num>, <num value="399">399</num>.&mdash;Similar warrants were issued on account of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> III. <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> II. and <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> IV.</NOTE> being extant, gave rise to this search.
<p>IN the minute relation by that able and worthy antiquary the late Sir <hi rend=italics>Joseph Ayloffe,</hi> bart. almost every particular is given. On lifting up the lid of the tomb, the royal body was found wrapped in a strong thick linen cloth, <hi rend=italics>waxed</hi> on the inside: the head and face were covered with a <hi rend=italics>sudarium</hi> or face-cloth of crimson sarcenet, wrapped into <num value="3">three</num> folds, conformable to the napkin used by our Saviour in his way to his crucifixion, as we are assured by the church of <hi rend=italics>Rome.</hi> On flinging open the external mantle, the corpse was discovered in all the ensigns of majesty, richly habited. The body was wrapped in a fine linen cere-cloth, closely fitted to every part, even to the very fingers and face. Over the cere-cloth was a tunic of red silk damask; above that a stole of thick white tissue crossed the breast, and on this, at <num value="6">six</num> inches distance from each other, quatre-foils of philligreework, of gilt metal set with false stones, imitating rubies, sapphires, amethysts, &amp;c.; and the intervals <pb id="p.95" n="95"> between the quatre-foils on the stole, powdered with minute white beads, tacked down into a most elegant embroidery, in form not unlike what is called the true lover's knot. Above these habits was the royal mantle of rich crimson sattin, fastened on the left shoulder with a magnificent <hi rend=italics>fibula,</hi> of gilt metal richly chased, and ornamented with <num value="4">four</num> pieces of red, and <num value="4">four</num> of blue, transparent paste, and <num value="24">twenty-four</num> more pearls. The corpse, from the waist downwards, was covered with a rich cloth of figured gold, which fell down to the feet and was tucked beneath them. On the back of each hand was a quatre-foil like those on the stole. In his right hand was a sceptre with a cross of copper gilt, and of elegant workmanship, reaching to the right shoulder. In the left hand the rod and dove, which passed over the shoulder and reached the royal ear. The dove stood on a ball placed on <num value="3">three</num> ranges of oak leaves of enamelled green; it was of white enamel. On the head was a crown charged with trefoils made of gilt metal.<note>The dress is represented on a seal of this monarch's, in <hi rend=italics>Sandford's</hi> Genealogy, <num value="120">120</num>, with tolerable accuracy.</NOTE> The head was lodged in the cavity of the stone-coffin, always observable in those receptacles of the dead. I refer the reader to the <hi rend=italics>Archaeologia</hi> for the other <hi rend=italics>minuti&aelig;</hi> attendant on the habiting of the royal corpse. It was dressed in conformity to antient usage, even as early as the <pb id="p.96" n="96"> time of the <hi rend=italics>Saxon Sebert.</hi> The use of the cerecloth is continued to our days: in the instance of our late king, the <num value="2">two</num> serjeant-surgeons had <num value="122">122</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>

<p>THIS picture, after the test of nearly <num value="400">four hundred</num> years, is in the highest preservation; and not less remarkable for the elegance of the coloring, than the excellence of the drawing, considering the early age of the performance. It was retouched by <hi rend=italics>Vandyk,</hi> and again about the year <datestruct value="1727"><year reg="1727">1727</year></datestruct>. The back ground is elevated above the figure, of an uneven surface, and gilt. The curious will find, in Mr. <hi rend=italics>Walpole's</hi> Anecdotes, vol. i. an ingenious conjecture respecting the method of painting in that early period, which has given such amazing duration to the labors of its artists. This portrait was originally hung up in the choir of the Abbey; but about a dozen years ago was removed to the <hi rend=italics>Jerusalem</hi> chamber.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Henry V.</NOTE> WITHIN a beautiful chapel of gothic workmanship, of open iron-work, ornamented with various images, is the tomb of the gallant prince <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> V.<note><hi rend=italics>Sandford,</hi>
<num value="289">289</num>.</NOTE> a striking contrast to the weak and <pb id="p.99" n="99"> luxurious <hi rend=italics>Richard.</hi> This was built by <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VII. in compliment to his illustrious relation and predecessor. His queen <hi rend=italics>Catherine</hi> had before erected his monument, and placed his image, cut in heart of oak, and covered over with silver, on an altar tomb; the head was (as our learned guide told us) of solid silver, which, in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. was sacrilegiously stolen away. The wooden headless trunk still remains.
<p>ON each side of this royal chapel is a winding staircase, inclosed in a turret of open iron-work, which leads into a chauntry founded for the purpose of masses, for the repose of the soul of this great prince. The front looks over the shrine of the Confessor. Here is kept a parcel of human figures, which in old times were dressed out and carried at funeral processions; but at present, very deservedly, have obtained the name of the <hi rend=italics>ragged regiment.</hi> More worthy of notice is the elegant termination of the <hi rend=italics>columell&aelig;</hi> of the <num value="2">two</num> staircases, which spread at the top of the turrets into roofs of uncommon elegance.
<p><num value="1">ONE</num> end of this chauntry rests against that of the chapel of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VII. Among the stone statues placed there is the <hi rend=italics>French</hi> patron <hi rend=italics>St. Denys,</hi> most composedly carrying his head in his hand.
<p>ON the south side of the chauntry, over his monument, is the representation of his coronation. <pb id="p.100" n="100"> The face of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> is distinguished by a wen under his chin; with which it was probably marked, as it is not to be supposed that the sculptor would have added a deformity.<note>Mr. <hi rend=italics>Carter</hi> intends to engrave this in his specimens of antient sculpture.</NOTE>
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>His Queen.</NOTE> CATHERINE, his royal consort, had less respect payed to her remains. She had sunk from the bed of the conqueror of <hi rend=italics>France,</hi> to that of a common gentleman: yet gave to these kingdoms a long line of princes. She died in <datestruct value="1437--"><year reg="1437">1437</year></datestruct>, and was interred in the chapel of our lady in this church. When her grandson <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VII. ordered that to be pulled down, to make room for his own magnificent chapel, he ungratefully neglected the remains of this his ancestress, and suffered them to be flung carelessly into a wooden chest, where they still rest near her <hi rend=italics>Henry's</hi> tomb.

<p>AT the dissolution, this great monastery, the <num value="2">second</num> mitred Abbey in the kingdom, underwent the common lot of the religious houses. In <datestruct value="1534--"><year reg="1534">1534</year></datestruct>, <pb id="p.107" n="107"> the abbot, <hi rend=italics>William Benson,</hi> subscribed to the king's supremacy, and in <datestruct value="1539--"><year reg="1539">1539</year></datestruct> surrendered his monastery into the royal hands, and received as a reward the office of <num value="1">first</num> dean to the new foundation, consisting of a dean and <num value="12">twelve</num> prebendaries. It was also erected into a bishoprick, but the only bishop was <hi rend=italics>Thomas Thirleby;</hi> it being suppressed in <datestruct value="1550--"><year reg="1550">1550</year></datestruct>, on his translation to <hi rend=italics>Norwich.</hi>

<p>WHEN the protector <hi rend=italics>Somerset</hi> ruled in the fulness of power, this magnificent, this sacred pile narrowly escaped a total demolition. It was his design to have pulled it down, and to have applied the materials towards the palace he was then erecting in the <hi rend=italics>Strand,</hi> known by the name of <hi rend=italics>Somerset</hi>-house. He was diverted from his design by a bribe of not fewer than <num value="14">fourteen</num> manors.&mdash; Mortals should be very delicate in pronouncing the vengeance of Heaven on their fellowcrea- tures: yet, in this instance, without presumption, without superstition, <num value="1">one</num> may suppose his fall to have been marked out by the Almighty, as a warning to impious men. He fell on the scaffold on <hi rend=italics>Tower-hill,</hi> lamented only because his overthrow was effected by a man more wicked, more ambitious, and more detested than himself. In their ends there was a consent of justice: both died by the ax: and both of their headless bodies were flung, within a very short space of time, into the same place, among the attainted herd. <pb id="p.108" n="108">
<p>IN the reign of queen <hi rend=italics>Mary,</hi> the former religion of the place experienced a brief restoration. She with great zeal restored it to the antient conventual state: collected many of the rich habits and <hi rend=italics>insignia</hi> of that splendid worship; established <num value="14">fourteen</num> monks, and appointed for their abbot <hi rend=italics>John Feckenham,</hi> a man of great piety and learning, who, on his expulsion in the succeeding reign, finished his days in easy custody in <hi rend=italics>Wisbech</hi> castle.
<p>IN <datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct> it was changed into a collegiate church, consisting of a dean, and <num value="12">twelve</num> secular canons, and <num value="30">thirty</num> petty canons, and other members, <num value="2">two</num> school-masters, and <num value="40">forty</num> king's or queen's scholars, <num value="12">twelve</num> almsmen, and many officers and servants.<note><hi rend=italics>Tanner.</hi></NOTE> But there seems to have been a school there from the <num value="1">first</num> foundation of the Abbey. <hi rend=italics>Ingulphus,</hi> abbot of <hi rend=italics>Crowland,</hi> speaks of his having been educated at it; and of the disputations he had with the queen of the <hi rend=italics>Confessor,</hi> and of the presents she made him in money in his boyish days.<note>Quoted by <hi rend=italics>Stow,</hi> book <num value="1">1</num>. vol. i. <num value="123">123</num>.</NOTE>
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Cloisters.</NOTE> BESIDES the church, many of the antient appendages remain. The cloisters are entire, and filled with monuments. The north and west cloisters were built by abbot <hi rend=italics>Littlington,</hi> who died in <datestruct value="1386--"><year reg="1386">1386</year></datestruct>: he also built the granary, which <pb id="p.109" n="109"> was afterwards the dormitory of the king's scholars; of later years rebuilt.
<p>THE entrance into the chapter-house (built in <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Chapter-house.</NOTE> <datestruct value="1250--"><year reg="1250">1250</year></datestruct>) is on <num value="1">one</num> side of the cloister, through a most rich and magnificent gothic portal, the mouldings most exquisitely carved: this is divided into <num value="2">two</num> gothic doors. The room is an octagon, each side of which had most superb and lofty windows, which being now filled up, it is lighted by smaller ones. The opening into this room is as noble as that from the cloister. The stone roof is destroyed, and <num value="1">one</num> of plank is substituted. The central pillar remains, light, slender, and elegant, surrounded by <num value="8">eight</num> others; bound by <num value="2">two</num> equidistant <hi rend=italics>fasci&aelig;,</hi> and terminated in capitals of beautiful simplicity. By consent of the abbot, in <datestruct value="1377--"><year reg="1377">1377</year></datestruct>, the commons of <hi rend=italics>Great Britain</hi> <num value="1">first</num> held their parlements in this place; the crown undertaking the repairs. Here they sat till the year <datestruct value="1547"><year reg="1547">1547</year></datestruct>, when <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> VI. granted the chapel of <hi rend=italics>St. Stephen</hi> to their use. It is at present filled with the public records, among which is the original <hi rend=italics>Domesday</hi> book, now above <num value="700">seven hundred</num> years old: it is in as fine preservation as if it was the work of yesterday.
<p>BENEATH the chapter-house is a very singular <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Crypt.</NOTE> crypt. The roof, which forms the floor of the former, is supported by a short round pillar, quite hollow. The top spreads into massy plain ribs, <pb id="p.110" n="110"> the supports of the roof. The walls are not less than eighteen feet thick, and form a most firm base to the superstructure. They had been pierced with several small windows, which are now lost by the vast increase of earth on the outside;<note>This crypt is only accessible through the house of Mr. <hi rend=italics>Barrow.</hi></NOTE> <num value="1">one</num> is just visible in the garden belonging to Mr. <hi rend=italics>Barrow.</hi>

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Jerusalem Chamber.</NOTE> THE <hi rend=italics>Jerusalem</hi> chamber formed a part of the abbot's lodgings; and was built by <hi rend=italics>Littlington.</hi> It is noted for having been the place where <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> IV. breathed his last: he had been seized with a swoon while he was praying before the shrine of <hi rend=italics>St. Edward:</hi> and, being carried into this room, asked, on recovering, where he was? Being informed, he answered, (I will give his reply in the words of <hi rend=italics>Shakespeare,</hi> borrowed from history)

<p>NOT far from the Abbey stood the <hi rend=italics>Sanctuary,</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Sanctuary.</NOTE> the place of refuge absurdly granted, in old times, to criminals of certain denominations. The church belonging to it was in form of a cross, and double; <num value="1">one</num> being built over the other. Such is the account that Doctor <hi rend=italics>Stukely</hi> gives of it, for he remembered it standing:<note><hi rend=italics>Archaeologia,</hi> i. p. <num value="39">39</num>.</NOTE> it was of vast strength; and was with much labor demolished. It is supposed to have been the work of the <hi rend=italics>Confessor.</hi> Within its precincts was born <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> V.; and here his unhappy mother took refuge, with her younger son <hi rend=italics>Richard,</hi> to secure him from his cruel uncle, who had already possession of the elder brother. Seduced by the persuasions of the duke of <hi rend=italics>Buckingham,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Thomas Scott</hi> alias <hi rend=italics>Rotherham,</hi> archbishop of <hi rend=italics>York,</hi> she surrendered the little innocent, who was instantly carried to his brother in the <hi rend=italics>Tower,</hi> where they were soon after involved in <num value="1">one</num> common fate.
<p>To the west of the sanctuary stood the <hi rend=italics>Eleemosynary</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Eleemosynary.</NOTE> or <hi rend=italics>Almory,</hi> where the alms of the Abbey were wont to be distributed. But it is still more remarkable for having been the place where the <num value="1">first</num> printing press ever known in <hi rend=italics>England</hi> was erected. It was in the year <datestruct value="1474"><year reg="1474">1474</year></datestruct>, when <hi rend=italics>William</hi>
<pb id="p.112" n="112"> <hi rend=italics>Caxton,</hi> probably encouraged by the learned <hi rend=italics>Thomas Milling,</hi> then abbot, produced <hi rend=italics>The Game and Play of the Chesse,</hi> the <num value="1">first</num> book ever printed in these kingdoms. There is a slight difference about the place in which it was printed, but all agree that it was within the precincts of this religious house. Would the monks have permitted this, could they have foreseen how certainly the art would conduce to their overthrow, by the extension of knowledge, and the long-concealed truths of Christianity?
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>St. Margaret's Church.</placename></NOTE> BENEATH the shadow of the Abbey stands the church of <hi rend=italics>St. Margaret,</hi> built originally by <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> the Confessor. The parish church had been in the Abbey, to the great inconveniency of the monks. It was rebuilt in the time of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> I. and again in that of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> IV. This church is honored with the remains of the great Sir <hi rend=italics>Walter Raleigh,</hi> who was interred here on the same day on which he was beheaded in <hi rend=italics>Old Palace Yard.</hi> It was left to a sensible churchwarden to inform us of the fact, who inscribed it on a board about <num value="20">twenty</num> years ago.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Its Fine Window.</NOTE> THE east window is a most beautiful composition. It was made by order of the magistrates of <hi rend=italics>Dort,</hi> and by them designed as a present to <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VII.; but he dying before it was finished, it was put up in the private chapel of the abbot of <hi rend=italics>Waltham</hi> at <hi rend=italics>Copt-hall:</hi> there it remained till the <pb id="p.113" n="113"> dissolution; when it was removed to <hi rend=italics>Newhall</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Essex,</hi> afterwards part of the estate of general <hi rend=italics>Monk,</hi> who preserved it from demolition. In <datestruct value="1758--"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct> it was purchased from the then owner, by the inhabitants of this parish, for <num value="400">four hundred</num> guineas. By a most absurd and tasteless opposition, this fine ornament ran a great risque of being pulled down again. The subject is the crucifixion: a devil is carrying off the soul of the hardened thief; an angel receiving that of the penitent. Silly enough! but the other beauties of the piece might surely have moved the reverend zealot to mercy. The figures are numerous, and finely executed. On <num value="1">one</num> side is <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VI. kneeling; above him his patron saint, <hi rend=italics>St. George.</hi> On the other side is his queen in the same attitude, and above her the fair <hi rend=italics>St. Catherine</hi> with the instruments of her martyrdom. This charming performance is engraved at the expence of the Society of Antiquaries.
<p>THE royal palace which clames seniority in our <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Palace at Westminster</placename>.</NOTE> capital, was that of <hi rend=italics>Westminster,</hi> founded by the <hi rend=italics>Confessor,</hi> who was the <num value="1">first</num> prince who had it in regular residence. It stood near the <hi rend=italics>Thames:</hi> the stairs to it on the river still keep the name of <hi rend=italics>Palace stairs;</hi> and the <num value="2">two</num> <hi rend=italics>Palace Yards</hi> also belonged to this extensive pile.
<p>THE <hi rend=italics>New Palace Yard</hi> is the area before the hall. In old times a very handsome conduit, or, <pb id="p.114" n="114"> as it was called, fountain, graced <num value="1">one</num> part: and opposite to the hall, on the site of the present passage into <hi rend=italics>Bridge-street,</hi> stood a lofty square tower, which, from its use, was called the <hi rend=italics>Clock Tower.</hi> This may be seen in <hi rend=italics>Hollar's</hi> print, N<hi rend=sup>o</hi> <num value="6">6</num>, and in the old plan of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> as it was in the beginning of the reign of queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth.</hi>

<p>MANY parts of this adjacent palace exist to this day, sunk into other uses. Succeeding monarchs <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Westminster-Hall.</placename></NOTE> added much to it. The great hall was built by <hi rend=italics>William Rufus,</hi> or possibly rebuilt; a room of that description being too necessary an appendage to a palace, ever to have been neglected. The entrance into it from <hi rend=italics>New Palace Yard,</hi> was bounded on each side by towers,<note><hi rend=italics>Kip</hi> has given a view of it, N<hi rend=sup>o</hi> <num value="40">40</num>.</NOTE> most magnificently ornamented with numbers of statues in rows above each other, now lost, or concealed by modern buildings: a mutilated figure of an armed man, supposed to have been <num value="1">one</num>, was discovered under the Exchequer staircase in <datestruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></datestruct>.<note><hi rend=italics>Carler's</hi> antient sculptures, N<hi rend=sup>o</hi> <num value="1">1</num>.</NOTE> The size may be estimated, when we are told that <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> III. entertained in this hall, and other rooms, <num value="6000">six thousand</num> poor men, women, and children, on new-year's day, <datestruct value="1236--"><year reg="1236">1236</year></datestruct>. It became ruinous before the reign of <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> II. who repaired it in <datestruct value="1397--"><year reg="1397">1397</year></datestruct>, raised the walls <num value="2">two</num> feet, altered the windows, and added a new roof, as well as a <pb id="p.115" n="115"> stately porch and other buildings. The expence was paid by a levy on banished strangers, or refugees, who had sought an asylum in <hi rend=italics>England.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Stowe's Survaie,</hi> <num value="887">887</num>.</NOTE> In <datestruct value="1399--"><year reg="1399">1399</year></datestruct> he kept his <hi rend=italics>Christmas</hi> in it, with his characteristical magnificence. <num value="28">Twenty-eight</num> oxen, <num value="300">three hundred</num> sheep, and fowls without number, were daily consumed. The number of his guests each day were <num value="10000">ten thousand</num>. We need not wonder then, that <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> kept <num value="2000">two thousand</num> cooks. They certainly were deeply learned in their profession; witness the <hi rend=italics>Forme of Cury,</hi> compiled about <datestruct value="1390--"><year reg="1390">1390</year></datestruct>, by the master cooks of this luxurious monarch, in which are preserved receits for the most exquisite dishes of the time. This book was printed by the late worthy <hi rend=italics>Gustavus Brander,</hi> esq; with an excellent preface by that able antiquary the reverend Doctor <hi rend=italics>Pegge.</hi> Mr. <hi rend=italics>Brander</hi> favored me with a copy; but excepting a magician of <hi rend=italics>Laputa</hi> could conjure up a few of <hi rend=italics>Richard's</hi> cooks, I despair of ever treating my brethren with a feast <hi rend=italics>&agrave; l'antique.</hi>

<p>THIS room exceeds in dimensions any in <hi rend=italics>Europe,</hi> which is unsupported by pillars; its length is <num value="270">two hundred and seventy</num> feet; the breadth <num value="74">seventy-four</num>. Its height adds to its solemnity. The roof consists chiefly of chesnut wood, most curiously constructed, and of a fine species of <pb id="p.116" n="116"> <hi rend=italics>gothic.</hi> It is every where adorned with angels supporting the arms of <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> II. or those of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> the Confessor; as is the stone moulding that runs round the hall, with the hart <hi rend=italics>couchant</hi> under a tree, and other devices of <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> II.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Parlements Held in it.</NOTE> PARLEMENTS often sat in this hall. In <datestruct value="1397--"><year reg="1397">1397</year></datestruct>, when, in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> II. it was extremely ruinous, he built a temporary room for his parlement, formed with wood, and covered with tiles. It was open on all sides, that the constituents might see every thing that was said and done; and, under the pretence of securing freedom of debate, he surrounded the house with <num value="4000">four thousand</num> <hi rend=italics>Cheshire</hi> archers, with bows bent, and arrows nocked ready to shoot.<note><hi rend=italics>Stow's Survaie,</hi> <num value="888">888</num>, <num value="889">889</num>.</NOTE> This fully answered the intent: for every sacrifice was made to the royal pleasure.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Courts of Justice.</placename></NOTE> COURTS of justice, even in early times, sat in this hall, where monarchs themselves usually presided; for which reason it was called <hi rend=italics>Curia Domini Regis,</hi> and <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="3">three</num> now held in this hall is called the court of <hi rend=italics>king's bench.</hi> Originally the <hi rend=italics>Communia placita</hi> followed the king's court wheresoever it happened to be. The king presided in person, and was attended by his judges: he sate on an elevated seat, and the judges on a bench below to assist him with their advice. <pb id="p.117" n="117"> <hi rend=italics>Madox</hi> enumerates many of the palaces,<note>Antiquities of the Exchequer, i. <num value="6">6</num> to <num value="25">25</num>.</NOTE> in the great hall of which the monarchs presided, and he specifies the business done. This was found an inconveniency to the subjects, who were obliged to follow the court to great distances to obtain justice. The <hi rend=italics>Magna Charta</hi> made provision against the grievance in the xxiid article. &ldquo;Communia placita non sequantur curiam nostram, sed teneantur in aliquo certo loco:&rdquo; and <hi rend=italics>Westminster-hall</hi> was the place appointed, as being within the <num value="1">first</num> and chief palace of our kings. But <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> I. in his <num value="28">28th</num> year obtained a statute, directing, in the following curious law <hi rend=italics>french,</hi> that the law courts should follow him wheresoever he went, that he might receive the benefit of their assistance. <QUOTE lang=fr>Dautre part le roi voet qe le chaunceliere e les justices de soen banc lui suivent issint qil eit touz jours pres de lui ascuns sages de la lei, qui sachent les busoignes que viegment a la curt, duement deliverer a tote les foiz qe mester serra.</QUOTE><note><hi rend=italics>Anglic&egrave;.</hi> <QUOTE>And on the other party the king wills, that the chancellor and the justices of his bench shall follow him, so that he may have at all times near unto him some sages of the laws, which be able duly to order all such matters as shall come unto the court, at all times when need shall require.</QUOTE></NOTE>
<p>THE most antient of the courts now held under <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Chancery.</placename></NOTE> this venerable roof, is that of the <hi rend=italics>chancery,</hi> where <pb id="p.118" n="118"> the lord high chancellor sits during term. We have no account of the person who <num value="1">first</num> filled the office. <hi rend=italics>Unwona,</hi> chancellor to king <hi rend=italics>Offa,</hi> who began his reign in <num value="758">758</num>, is the <num value="1">first</num> named. The <num value="1">first</num> after the conquest, in <datestruct value="1067--"><year reg="1067">1067</year></datestruct>, was <hi rend=italics>Maurise,</hi> afterwards bishop of <hi rend=italics>London.</hi> Till about <datestruct value="1559--"><year reg="1559">1559</year></datestruct> this high office was mostly filled by churchmen. Their place of sittings was at a long marble table, to which was an ascent of <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> steps: the chancellor himself sat in a marble chair fixed in the wall opposite to the middle of the marble table. These were remaining in <hi rend=italics>Dugdale's</hi> time,<note><hi rend=italics>Orig. judiciales,</hi> <num value="37">37</num>.</NOTE> but even then covered with the courts there erected.

On the suppression of this office, in the year <datestruct value="1267"><year reg="1267">1267</year></datestruct>, the name was changed to <hi rend=italics>capitalis justiciarius,</hi> and the <num value="1">first</num> chief justice was <hi rend=italics>Robert de Brus.</hi><note>The same, <num value="38">38</num>.</NOTE> Let me mention here the high antiquity of monarchs themselves discharging the glorious office of attending in person to the rights of their subjects, the prince being the fountain of justice, as well as <pb id="p.119" n="119"> of honor. <hi rend=italics>Augustus</hi> is recorded to have administered justice in person, and sometimes to have set up all night for that purpose. Our <hi rend=italics>Saxon</hi> monarchs continued the custom; and after them the <hi rend=italics>English</hi> for a very long period.
<p>THE <hi rend=italics>common-pleas</hi> is the <num value="3">third</num> court of justice <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Commonpleas.</NOTE> held in this hall.

Originally a certain number of lords spiritual and temporal sate. The supreme judge is now called chief Baron, and the others the <hi rend=italics>puisne</hi> Barons.
<p>THE judges of the courts were made knights bannerets; <hi rend=italics>Walter de Clopton,</hi> chief justice of the king's bench, and <hi rend=italics>Robert de Cherleton,</hi> chief justice of the common pleas, received the honor of knighthood as bannerets at <hi rend=italics>Windsor</hi> on the feast of <hi rend=italics>St. George,</hi> in the year <datestruct value="1387"><year reg="1387">1387</year></datestruct>,<note>The same, <num value="103">103</num>.</NOTE> and had materials given them for making most sumptuous habits for the occasion.

They were at <num value="1">first</num> kept in <hi rend=italics>Cotton-house,</hi> which was purchased by the crown. They were afterwards removed to another house in <hi rend=italics>Westminster,</hi> and finally deposited in the <hi rend=italics>British Museum.</hi> Let me add, that the room in which the books were originally lodged, had been the oratory of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> the <hi rend=italics>Confessor.</hi>

<p>IN this hall was carried on the important trial <pb id="p.121" n="121"> of the great earl of <hi rend=italics>Strafford.</hi> I mention it, to shew the simplicity of <num value="1">one</num> part of the manners of the times. The commons, who had an inclosed place for themselves, at a certain hour pulled out of their pockets bread and cheese, and bottles of ale; and, after they had eat and drank, turned their backs from the king, and made water, much to the annoyance of those who happened to be below.<note>Provost <hi rend=italics>Baillie</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Scotland's</hi> Letters, in <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> His lordship was brought into the hall by <num value="8">eight</num> o'clock in the morning.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Prince's Chamber.</NOTE> IN the <hi rend=italics>Prince's</hi> chamber, where his majesty puts on his robes when he comes to the house of lords, is a curious old tapestry, representing the birth of queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Court of Requests.</NOTE> THE court of requests is a vast room modernised; at present a mere walking-place. The outside of the south end shews the great antiquity of the building, having in it <num value="2">two</num> great round arches, with zigzag mouldings, our most antient species of architecture.

To this day, the manner in which Providence directed the discovery is unknown. The plot evidently was confined to a few persons of desperate zeal and wickedness: they did not dare to trust so dreadful a design to the multitude. The success, they knew, must be followed with a general insurrection, and completion of their wishes. The opportunity would have been too irresistible, even to those who, in cool blood, would have rejected with horror a plan so truly diabolical.
<p>THE commons of <hi rend=italics>Great Britain</hi> hold their <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>House of Commons</placename>, Once St.<placename>Stephen's Chapel.</placename></NOTE> assemblies in this place, which was built by king <hi rend=italics>Stephen,</hi> and dedicated to his namesake the protomartyr. It was beautifully rebuilt by <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> III. in <datestruct value="1347--"><year reg="1347">1347</year></datestruct>,<note><hi rend=italics>Smith,</hi> in his <hi rend=italics>Antiquities of Westminster,</hi> has collected much curious information relative to the re-building <hi rend=italics>St. Stephen's</hi> chapel, and proves (p. <num value="82">82</num>) that the work commenced as early as the <num value="4">4th</num> of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> III. or the year <datestruct value="1330"><year reg="1330">1330</year></datestruct>.

<p>THE west front, with its beautiful <hi rend=italics>gothic</hi> window, <NOTE PLACE=MARG>West Front.</NOTE> is still to be seen as we ascend the stairs to <pb id="p.126" n="126"> the court of requests; it consists of the sharppointed species of <hi rend=italics>gothic.</hi> Between it and the lobby of the house is a small vestibule of the same sort of work, and of great elegance. At each end is a <hi rend=italics>gothic</hi> door, and <num value="1">one</num> in the middle, which is the passage into the lobby. On the south side of the outmost wall of the chapel appear the marks of some great <hi rend=italics>gothic</hi> windows, with abutments between; and beneath, some lesser windows, once of use to light an under-chapel. The inside of <hi rend=italics>St. Stephen's</hi> is adapted to its present use, and plainly fitted up.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Sub-Chapel.</NOTE> THE under-chapel was a most beautiful building: the far greater part is preserved, but frittered into various divisions, occupied principally by the passage from <hi rend=italics>Westminster-hall</hi> to <hi rend=italics>Palace Yard.</hi>

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Bust of Charles I.</NOTE> IN the passage stood the famous bust of <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> I. by <hi rend=italics>Bernini,</hi> made by him from a painting by <hi rend=italics>Vandyck,</hi> done for the purpose. <hi rend=italics>Bernini</hi> is said, by his skill in physiognomy, to have pronounced from the likeness, that there was something unfortunate in the countenance.
<p>THE far greater part of the under-chapel of <hi rend=italics>St. Stephen</hi> is possessed by his grace the duke of <hi rend=italics>Newcastle,</hi> as auditor of the exchequer.<note>During the time that Mr. <hi rend=italics>Addington,</hi> now viscount <hi rend=italics>Sidmouth,</hi> was Speaker, the commons voted that most of these apartments should be appropriated to his use, and that of his successors in office. Various improvements have taken place, particularly since the honorable <hi rend=italics>Charles Abbot</hi> has been advanced to the chair, which he fills so worthily. His eating-room is immediately under the chapel. The <hi rend=italics>belfry</hi> has been converted into a handsome staircase, leading to some spacious rooms, <num value="2">two</num> of which are fitted up as a gallery for the reception of portraits of Speakers of the House of Commons from the time of Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas More</hi> in <datestruct value="1523--"><year reg="1523">1523</year></datestruct> to the present day. ED.</NOTE> <num value="1">One</num> <pb id="p.127" n="127"> side of the cloister is entirely preserved, by being <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Beautiful Cloister.</NOTE> found convenient as a passage: the roof is <hi rend=italics>gothic,</hi> so elegant as not to be paralleled even by the beautiful workmanship in the chapel of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VII. Several parts are walled up for the meanest uses; a portion serving, with its rich roof, for a coalhole. That which has the good fortune to be allotted for the steward's room, is very well kept.
<p>ON <num value="1">one</num> side of the cloister, projects into the <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Small Oratory and Chauntry.</NOTE> area a small oratory, as richly ornamented as other parts of this building: above is a neat chauntry in the same style. A gallery runs over each side of the cloister, with windows of light stone tracery, looking into the court or area, which is deformed by a modern kitchen and its appendages.
<p>FROM <num value="1">one</num> part of the gallery are stairs, which <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Antient Square Tower.</NOTE> lead to a very antient square tower of stone, standing almost close to the side of <hi rend=italics>Westminster-hall.</hi> It probably was a belfry, to hold the bells that roused the holy members of the chapel to prayer.
<p>IN what is called the grotto room, are fine remains <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Sculptures of St. Stephen.</NOTE> of the roof and columns of this sub-chapel. <pb id="p.128" n="128"> The roof is spread over with ribs of stone, which rest on the numerous round pillars that compose the support. The pillars are short; the capitals round and small, with a neat foliage intervening. In a circle on the roof is a martyrdom of <hi rend=italics>St. Stephen,</hi> cut in stone. In another circle, is a representation of <hi rend=italics>St. John</hi> the <hi rend=italics>Evangelist</hi> cast into a cauldron of boiling oil, by command of the emperor <hi rend=italics>Domitian.</hi>

<p>I CANNOT but remark the wondrous change in the hours of the house of commons, since the days in which the great earl of <hi rend=italics>Clarendon</hi> was a member: for he complains &ldquo;of the house keeping <hi rend=italics>those disorderly hours,</hi> and seldom rising till after <hi rend=italics><num value="4">four</num></hi> in the afternoon.&rdquo;<note>His life, i. <num value="80">80</num>. octavo ed.</NOTE>
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Woolstaple.</NOTE> Not far from <hi rend=italics>Westminster-hall,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>New Palace Yard,</hi> stood the staple of wool, removed to <hi rend=italics>Westminster,</hi> and several other places in <hi rend=italics>England,</hi> in <datestruct value="1353--"><year reg="1353">1353</year></datestruct>, by <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> III. These had previously been kept in <hi rend=italics>Flanders:</hi> but their removal brought great wealth into the kingdom, and a considerable addition to the royal revenue: for the parlement in those days granted to the king a certain sum on every sack exported. <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VI. had <num value="6">six</num> woolhouses here, which he granted to the dean and canons of <hi rend=italics>St. Stephen's.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Strype's Stow,</hi> ii. book vi. p. <num value="7">7</num>.</NOTE> The concourse of people, which this removal of the wool-staple to <pb id="p.129" n="129"> <hi rend=italics>Westminster</hi> occasioned, caused this royal village to grow into a considerable town: such is the superiority of commerce. Part of the old gateway to the staple was in being as late as the year <datestruct value="1741"><year reg="1741">1741</year></datestruct>, when it was pulled down to make room for the abutment of <hi rend=italics>Westminster</hi> bridge.<note><hi rend=italics>Anderson's Dict.</hi> i. <num value="184">184</num>.</NOTE>
<p>THE <num value="1">first</num> stone of that noble structure was laid <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Westminster Bridge.</placename></NOTE> on <hi rend=italics>January</hi> <num value="24">24th</num>, <datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>, by <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Pembroke,</hi> a nobleman, of whom Mr. <hi rend=italics>Walpole</hi> says, none had a purer taste in architecture. It was built after the design of Monsieur <hi rend=italics>Labelye,</hi> an ingenious architect, a native of <hi rend=italics>Switzerland.</hi><note>Who died at <hi rend=italics>Paris</hi> in <datestruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>.

In this bridge, grandeur and simplicity are united. Fault has been found with the great height of the balustrades, which deny to the passengers a clear view of the noble expanse of water, and the fine objects, especially to the east, which are scattered with no sparing hand. I cannot agree with the happy thought of the <hi rend=italics>French</hi> traveller,<note>M. <hi rend=italics>Grosley's</hi> tour to <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> i. <num value="27">27</num>, <num value="28">28</num>.</NOTE> who assures us, that they were made so high to prevent the suicide to which the <hi rend=italics>English</hi> have so strong a propensity, particularly <pb id="p.130" n="130"> in the gloomy month of <hi rend=italics>November;</hi> for, had they been low, how few could resist the charming opportunity of springing over! whereas at present, the difficulty of climbing up these heights is so great, that the poor hypochondriac has time to cool; and desisting from his glorious purpose, thinks proper to give his days their full length, and end them like a good Christian in his peaceful bed.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Tide.</NOTE> THE tide has been known to rise at this bridge <num value="22">twenty-two</num> feet; much to the inconveniency of the inhabitants of the lower parts of <hi rend=italics>Westminster,</hi> for at such times their cellars are laid under water; but its height depends much on the force and direction of the wind at the time of flood.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Canon or Channel Row.</placename></NOTE> BEYOND this palace, to the north, stood some streets and lanes by the water side, distinguished in older times by the residence of some of our nobility. In <hi rend=italics>Canon Row,</hi> so named from being inhabited by the canons of the church, but corrupted into <hi rend=italics>Channel Row,</hi> was the stately house built by the termagant <hi rend=italics>Anne Stanhope,</hi> wife to the protector <hi rend=italics>Somerset;</hi> whose dispute, about some point of female precedency, is said to have contributed in some degree to her husband's fall. She left this house to her son <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Hertford.</hi> Here <hi rend=italics>William</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Derby</hi> had, in <datestruct value="1603--"><year reg="1603">1603</year></datestruct>, a fair mansion; and <hi rend=italics>Henry Clinton</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Lincoln,</hi> another; and in this row, <hi rend=italics>Anne Clifford</hi> tells us, that on the <num value="1">first</num> of <hi rend=italics>May,</hi> <datestruct value="1589--"><year reg="1589">1589</year></datestruct>, she was begotten <pb id="p.131" n="131"> by her most valiant father <hi rend=italics>George</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Cumberland,</hi> on the body of her most virtuous mother <hi rend=italics>Margaret,</hi> daughter of <hi rend=italics>Francis</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Bedford.</hi> Astonishing accuracy!
<p>IN this part of the town were some other houses of our nobility. In <hi rend=italics>Manchester-court, Canonrow,</hi> stood the house of the earls of <hi rend=italics>Manchester.</hi> In the remote <hi rend=italics>Tothil-street,</hi> stood the houses of lord <hi rend=italics>Grey,</hi> and of lord <hi rend=italics>Dacres,</hi> mentioned in <hi rend=italics>Norden's</hi> map of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> in <datestruct value="1603--"><year reg="1603">1603</year></datestruct>; and in <hi rend=italics>Lea's</hi> map, published in <datestruct value="1700--"><year reg="1700">1700</year></datestruct>, is the earl of <hi rend=italics>Lindesey's</hi> house near <hi rend=italics>Old Palace Yard;</hi> of which I find no other account, than that it was inhabited, in <datestruct value="1707--"><year reg="1707">1707</year></datestruct>, by <num value="1">one</num> of the <hi rend=italics>Dormers,</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Caernarvon.</hi><note>New view of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> ii. <num value="627">627</num>.</NOTE>
<p>IMMEDIATELY beyond these buildings began <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Palace of Whitehall.</placename></NOTE> the vast palace of <hi rend=italics>Whitehall.</hi> It was originally built by <hi rend=italics>Hubert de Burgh</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Kent,</hi> the great, the persecuted justiciary of <hi rend=italics>England,</hi> in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> III. He bequeathed it to the Black Friars in <hi rend=italics>Holborn,</hi> and they disposed of it to <hi rend=italics>Walter de Grey</hi> archbishop of <hi rend=italics>York,</hi> in <datestruct value="1248--"><year reg="1248">1248</year></datestruct>. It became for centuries the residence of the prelates of that see, and was styled <hi rend=italics>York-house.</hi> In it <hi rend=italics>Wolsey</hi> took his final leave of greatness. The profusion of rich things; hangings of cloth of gold and of silver; thousands of pieces of fine <hi rend=italics>Holland;</hi> the quantities of plate, even of pure gold, which <pb id="p.132" n="132"> covered <num value="2">two</num> great tables,<note>See <hi rend=italics>Fiddles's</hi> Life of <hi rend=italics>Wolsey,</hi> <num value="497">497</num>.</NOTE> (all of which were seized by his cruel rapacious master) are proofs of his amazing wealth, splendor, and pride. <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> became possessed of it about the year <datestruct value="1529"><year reg="1529">1529</year></datestruct>, by the forfeiture of his fallen servant: the antient palace of <hi rend=italics>Westminster</hi> having some time before suffered greatly by fire. From this time it became the residence of our princes, till it was almost wholly destroyed by the same element in <datestruct value="1697--"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct>.
<p>HENRY was an uncommon composition: his savage cruelty could not suppress his love of the arts: his love of the arts could not soften his savage cruelty. The prince who could, with the utmost <hi rend=italics>sang froid,</hi> burn Catholics and Protestants, take off the heads of the partners of his bed <num value="1">one</num> day, and celebrate new nuptials the next, had, notwithstanding, a strong taste for refined pleasures. He cultivated architecture and painting, and invited from abroad artists of the <num value="1">first</num> merit. <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Fine Gate.</NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Holbein</hi> designed the most beautiful gate at <hi rend=italics>Whitehall,</hi> built with bricks of <num value="2">two</num> colors, glazed, and disposed in a tessellated fashion. The top, as well as that of an elegant tower on each side, was embattled. On each front were <num value="4">four</num> busts in baked clay, in proper colors, which resisted to the last every attack of the weather: possibly the artificial stone revived in this century. These I have <pb id="p.133" n="133"> been lately informed, are preserved in private hands. This charming structure fell a sacrifice to conveniency within my memory:<note>It was taken down in <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>.

Henry</hi> built it as a passage to the park, the tennis-court, bowling-green, the cock-pit, and tilting-yard; for he was extremely fond of athletic exercises; they suited his strength and his temper.
<p>IT was the intention of <hi rend=italics>William</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>Cumberland,</hi> to rebuild the beautiful gate, <num value="1">first</num> mentioned, at the top of the long walk at <hi rend=italics>Windsor,</hi> and for that purpose he had all the parts and stones numbered; but unfortunately the design was never executed.<note>The editor of <hi rend=italics>Smith's</hi> Antiquities of <hi rend=italics>Westminster</hi> stigmatises the above description as &ldquo;vague and superficial;&rdquo; the <hi rend=italics>candid</hi> reader will probably think it sufficient for a work of a general nature.

<p><num value="2">Two</num> principal heroes of the time were <hi rend=italics>Sir</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Noble Band of Knights Tilters.

His own armour he offered at the foot of a crowned pillar, near her majesty's feet: after which he clothed himself in a coat of black velvet pointed under the arm, and <pb id="p.138" n="138"> instead of a helmet, covered his head with a buttoned cap of the country fashion.<note>See Mr. <hi rend=italics>Walpole's</hi> Miscellaneous Antiquities, N<hi rend=sup>o</hi> <num value="1">1</num>. p. <num value="41">41</num>.</NOTE> He died aged <num value="80">80</num>, in the year <datestruct value="1611"><year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct>, and was interred in the once elegant little church of <hi rend=italics>Quarendon,</hi> near <hi rend=italics>Aylesbury.</hi> It is difficult to say whether that or the tomb is most ruinous. The figure of the knight appears in armour reclining, with <num value="1">one</num> hand supporting his head, the other on his sword; on his neck is a rich collar with the <hi rend=italics>George</hi> pendant; his hair is short and curled; his face bearded and whiskered.

<p>In a work which furnished so few architectural subjects for the engraver, I present the reader with the portrait of this venerable knight, taken from an original in the possession of the late Mrs. <hi rend=italics>Sydney Lee,</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Chester;</hi> who with great politeness obliged me with a reduced copy. He sprang from a <hi rend=italics>Cheshire</hi> family, the same which produced the <hi rend=italics>Lees,</hi> earls of <hi rend=italics>Lichfield.</hi> Sir <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> has by him a large dog, to which he once was indebted for his life. By accident it was left <num value="1">one</num> night in his bed-chamber, unknown to a faithless servant, <pb id="p.139" n="139"> who entered the room with an intent to rob and murder his master, but was seized on his entrance by the affectionate animal. At <hi rend=italics>Ditchly,</hi> the former seat of the <hi rend=italics>Lees,</hi> earls of <hi rend=italics>Lichfield,</hi> is a fine full length of Sir <hi rend=italics>Henry,</hi> and his trusty dog.

<p>IN the time of <hi rend=italics>James</hi> I. <hi rend=italics>Whitehall</hi> was in a most ruinous state. He determined to rebuild it <pb id="p.140" n="140"> <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Origin of the Present Banquetting-House.</NOTE> in a very princely manner, and worthy of the residence of the monarchs of the <hi rend=italics>British</hi> empire. He began with pulling down the banquetting-rooms built by <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth.</hi> That which bears the name at present was begun in <datestruct value="1619--"><year reg="1619">1619</year></datestruct>, from a design of <hi rend=italics>Inigo Jones,</hi> in his purest manner; and executed by <hi rend=italics>Nicholas Stone,</hi> master-mason and architect to the king: it was finished in <num value="2">two</num> years, and cost <measure value="17000l." type=currency><num value="17000">seventeen thousand</num> pounds</measure>; but was only a small part of a vast plan, left unexecuted on account of the unhappy times which succeeded.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Cieling.</NOTE> THE cieling of this noble room cannot be sufficiently admired. It was painted by <hi rend=italics>Rubens,</hi> who had <measure value="3000l." type=currency><num value="3000">three thousand</num> pounds</measure> for his work. It is said that he was assisted in the execution by his scholar <pb id="p.141" n="141"> <hi rend=italics>Jordaens.</hi> The subject is the <hi rend=italics>apotheosis</hi> of <hi rend=italics>James</hi> I.; it forms <num value="9">nine</num> compartments; <num value="1">one</num> of the middle, represents our pacific monarch on his earthly throne, turning with horror from <hi rend=italics>Mars,</hi> and other of the discordant deities, and as if it were giving himself up to the amiable goddess he always cultivated, to her attendants, Commerce and all the fine arts. This fine performance is painted on canvass, and is in good preservation; but, a few years ago, it underwent a repair by Mr. <hi rend=italics>Cipriani,</hi> who, as I am told, had <measure value="2000l." type=currency><num value="2000">two thousand</num> pounds</measure> for his trouble. The present altar-piece (which is very ill suited to the style of the place) was brought thither from <hi rend=italics>Whitehall,</hi> having escaped the fire, and was the gift of queen <hi rend=italics>Anne.</hi> Near the entrance is a bust of the royal founder.
<p>LITTLE did <hi rend=italics>James</hi> think that he was erecting a pile from which his son was to step from the throne to the scaffold. He had been brought, in the morning of his death, from <hi rend=italics>St. James's</hi> across the park, and from thence to <hi rend=italics>Whitehall,</hi> where, ascending the great staircase, he passed through the long gallery to his bed-chamber, the place allotted to him to pass the short period before he received the fatal blow. It is <num value="1">one</num> of the smaller rooms marked with the letter A, in the old plan of <hi rend=italics>Whitehall.</hi> He was from thence conducted along the galleries and the banquetting-house, through the <pb id="p.142" n="142"> wall, in which a passage was broken,<note><hi rend=italics>Herbert's Memoirs,</hi> <num value="135">135</num>.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Warwick's Memoirs,</hi> <num value="334">334</num>.</NOTE> to his last earthly stage. This passage still remains, at the north end of the room, and is at present the door to a small additional building of late date. At the time of the king's death, contiguous to the banquetting-house was a large building with a long roof, and a small cupola rising out of the middle.<note>Represented in <num value="1">one</num> of <hi rend=italics>Hollar's</hi> prints.</NOTE> The late dutchess of <hi rend=italics>Portland</hi> did me the honor of shewing to me a rich pearl surmounted with a crown, which was taken out of the ear of the murdered monarch, after his head was struck off.<note>This is figured in <num value="1">one</num> of the private plates engraven at the expence of her Grace.</NOTE>
<p>THE banquetting-house has been, many years past, converted into a chapel. <hi rend=italics>George</hi> I. appointed a salary of <num value="30">30</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> a year to be paid to certain select preachers, to preach here every <hi rend=italics>Sunday.</hi>

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Cabinet of Charles I.</NOTE> THE collection of paintings formed by this most accomplished prince, was esteemed the <num value="1">first</num> in <hi rend=italics>Europe.</hi> They were kept in a room called the <hi rend=italics>Cabinet-room,</hi> in this palace; which was built by order of prince <hi rend=italics>Henry,</hi> from a design of <hi rend=italics>Inigo Jones.</hi> I have a view of it, and of some of the antient parts of <hi rend=italics>Whitehall</hi> which stood next to <hi rend=italics>St. James's</hi> park. This building is distinguished by the <hi rend=italics>Venetian</hi> window. It stood on the site of the <pb id="p.143" n="143"> duke of <hi rend=italics>York's</hi> house. <hi rend=italics>Vanderdort</hi> was appointed keeper, with a salary of <num value="50">50</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> a year. On the death of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> it was confirmed to him by <hi rend=italics>Charles,</hi> at the reduced salary of <num value="40">forty</num>. The view is taken from a drawing by <hi rend=italics>Levines,</hi> an artist who had worked under <hi rend=italics>Rembrandt.</hi> This I owe to the liberality of Dr. <hi rend=italics>Combe.</hi>

<p>THE pictures were disposed of by order of the ruling powers. As a proof of his majesty's judgment in collecting, several were sold for a <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">thousand</num> pounds</measure> apiece; a price seldom known in these days, when money bears so far less a value.
<p>IN <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct> a complete plan of this great palace was <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Plan of Whitehall.</NOTE> taken by <hi rend=italics>John Fisher,</hi> and engraven by <hi rend=italics>Vertue,</hi> in <datestruct value="1747--"><year reg="1747">1747</year></datestruct>. It appears that it extended along the river, and in front along the present <hi rend=italics>Parlement</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Whitehall</hi>-street, as far as <hi rend=italics>Scotland Yard;</hi> and on the other side of those streets to the turning into <hi rend=italics>Spring Garden,</hi> beyond the <hi rend=italics>Admiralty,</hi> looking into <hi rend=italics>St. James's</hi> Park. The merry king, his queen, the royal brother, prince <hi rend=italics>Rupert,</hi> the duke of <hi rend=italics>Monmouth,</hi> and all the great officers, and all the courtly train, had their lodgings within these walls; and all the royal family had their different offices, such as kitchens, cellars, pantries, spiceries, cyder-house, bake-house, wood-yards and coal-yards, and slaughter-house. We see among the fair attendants of queen <hi rend=italics>Catherine,</hi> many names which make a great figure in <hi rend=italics>Grammont,</hi>
<pb id="p.144" n="144"> and other chronicles of the time: such as the countess of <hi rend=italics>Castlemaine,</hi> Mrs. <hi rend=italics>Kirk,</hi> and Mrs. <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Nell Gwynne.</NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Killegrew.</hi> I did not imagine that <hi rend=italics>Nell Gwynne</hi> could have any establishment so near to the injured <hi rend=italics>Catherine,</hi> till Mr. <hi rend=italics>Pegge's Curialia,</hi> part i. p. <num value="58">58</num>. set me right. I shall give the discovery in his own words: &ldquo;I am ashamed to confess I find Mrs. <hi rend=italics>Eleanor Gwynne</hi> (better known by the name of <hi rend=italics>Nell Gwynne</hi>) among the LADIES of the PRIVY CHAMBER to queen <hi rend=italics>Catherine.</hi> This was bare-faced enough to be sure! Had the king made a momentary connection with a lady of that denomination, the offence might have been connived at by the queen; but the placing <num value="1">one</num> of the meanest of his creatures so near the queen's person was an insult that nothing could palliate but the licentiousness of the age, and the abandoned character of the lascivious monarch.&rdquo; <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> thought fit to dignify her (most improperly it must be allowed) with this office: but her residence was in <hi rend=italics>Pall-mall,</hi> in the <num value="1">first</num> good house on the left side of <hi rend=italics>St. James's</hi> Square, as we enter from <hi rend=italics>Pall-mall.</hi> The back room on the ground floor was (within memory) entirely of looking-glass; as was said to have been the cieling. Over the chimney was her picture; and that of her sister was in a <num value="3">third</num> room. This celebrated favorite died in <datestruct value="1691--"><year reg="1691">1691</year></datestruct>, a true penitent for the frailties of her past life. At the period I <pb id="p.145" n="145"> mention, this house was the property of <hi rend=italics>Thomas Brand,</hi> esq; of the <hi rend=italics>Hoo,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Hertfordshire.</hi>

<p>THE other royal favorites had the sanction of offices, such as maids of honor and the like, which, in all ages, like charity, were sure to cover a multitude of sins. In our days we may remember the naked <hi rend=italics>Iphigenia</hi> placed near an exalted personage, but her attendance was dispensed with; as I doubt not was the case with the lady in the reign of the profligate <hi rend=italics>Charles.</hi>

<p>I MUST not omit, that from the palace into the <hi rend=italics>Thames</hi> were <num value="2">two</num> stairs, <num value="1">one</num> public, the other the privy stairs for the use of majesty alone; the former are still in use, the latter are made up in the old wall adjacent to the earl of <hi rend=italics>Fife's</hi> house at <hi rend=italics>Whitehall,</hi> but the arch of the portal remains entire. <hi rend=italics>Henry,</hi> and his daughter <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth,</hi> made all their parties by water or on horseback; but the princess was occasionally mounted on a litter, carried on men's shoulders. Coaches had been introduced into <hi rend=italics>England</hi> by <hi rend=italics>Henry Fitzalan</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Arundel,</hi> <num value="1">one</num> of her admirers: but the spirited princess seems to have disdained the use. She rode in a dress of form and magnificence equal to what she appeared in at the drawing-room; but never put on breeches or boots, like the late <hi rend=italics>Czarina;</hi> nor yet the equivocal dress of the ladies of the present age.
<p>No <num value="1">one</num> is unacquainted with the noble and <pb id="p.146" n="146"> commodious improvements which succeeded. The space occupied by the former palace, most part of <hi rend=italics>Privy Garden,</hi> is covered with the houses of nobility or gentry, commanding most beautiful views of the river. Among the <num value="1">first</num> (on the site of the small-beer cellar, of which a view is preserved in N<hi rend=sup>o</hi> <num value="4">4</num>. of <hi rend=italics>Hollar's</hi> prints of <hi rend=italics>Whitehall</hi>) is the <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Earl of Fife's.</NOTE> house<note>Sold in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, after the death of Lord <hi rend=italics>Fife,</hi> to the earl of <hi rend=italics>Liverpool,</hi> for <num value="12000">12,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> ED.</NOTE> of the earl of <hi rend=italics>Fife.</hi> From his judicious embankment, is a matchless view of its kind, of the <num value="2">two</num> bridges with the magnificent expanse of water, <hi rend=italics>Somerset-house, St. Paul's,</hi> and multitudes of other objects less magnificent, but which serve to complete the beautiful scene.
<p>IN the great room is some very fine <hi rend=italics>Gobelins</hi> tapestry. I never can sufficiently admire the expression of passions, in <num value="2">two</num> of the subjects; the fine history of <hi rend=italics>Joseph</hi> disclosing himself to his brethren, and that of <hi rend=italics>Susanna</hi> accused by the <num value="2">two</num> elders. Here are also great numbers of fine paintings by foreign masters; but, as I confine myself to those which relate to our own country, I shall only mention a small <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of <hi rend=italics>Mary Stuart,</hi> with her child, an infant, standing on a table before her.

Such is the merit of this piece, that, notwithstanding it is supposed to have been the performance of <hi rend=italics>Jameson</hi> the <hi rend=italics>Scotch Vandyck;</hi> yet it has been often attributed to the great <hi rend=italics>Flemish</hi> painter.<note>Mr. <hi rend=italics>Walpole.</hi></NOTE>
<p>IN the vacant part of <hi rend=italics>Privy Garden</hi> is still to <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Statue of James II.</NOTE> be seen a noble statue in brass of our abdicated monarch, executed by <hi rend=italics>Grinlyn Gibbons,</hi> the year before he deserted his throne. The artist received <num value="300">300</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> for his performance.
<p>THIS statue was placed to the east of a most <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Curious Dial.</NOTE> curious dial, constructed by <hi rend=italics>Francis Hall,</hi> alias <hi rend=italics>Line,</hi> a jesuit, and set up in <datestruct value="1669--"><year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct>. It stood on a pedestal, and consisted of <num value="6">six</num> parts rising <num value="1">one</num> above the other, with multitudes of planes cut on each, which are so many dials subservient to the purposes of geography, astrology, and astronomy. To <num value="4">four</num> of these parts are globes placed on a branch like a chandelier. The description surpasses my powers. I must leave the reader to consult the very scarce book printed by the inventor, <pb id="p.148" n="148"> at <hi rend=italics>Liege,</hi> in <datestruct value="1673--"><year reg="1673">1673</year></datestruct>, in which are plates of the several parts, and their various uses explained.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Horseguards.</NOTE> THE horse-guards had their stables in the place they occupy at this time; but the present building was erected in the reign of his late majesty, after a design, I think, by <hi rend=italics>Vardy:</hi> it cost above <measure value="30000l." type=currency><num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> pounds</measure>. I have given a print<note>From a painting in possession of the earl of <hi rend=italics>Hardwick.</hi></NOTE> of the Horse-guards as they were in the time of <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> II. In it is the merry monarch and his dogs; and in the back view, the banquetting-house, <num value="1">one</num> of the gates, the treasury in its antient state, and the top of the cockpit.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Admiralty-office.</placename></NOTE> The Admiralty-office stood originally in <hi rend=italics>Dukestreet, Westminster;</hi> but in the reign of king <hi rend=italics>William</hi> was removed to the present spot, to the house then called <hi rend=italics>Wallingford-house,</hi> I believe from its having been inhabited by the <hi rend=italics>Knollys's,</hi> viscounts <hi rend=italics>Wallingford.</hi> From the roof, the pious <hi rend=italics>Usher,</hi> archbishop of <hi rend=italics>Armagh,</hi> then living here with the countess of <hi rend=italics>Peterborough,</hi> was prevaled on to take the last sight of his beloved master <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> I. when brought on the scaffold before <hi rend=italics>Whitehall.</hi> He sunk at the horror of the sight, and was carried in a swoon to his apartment.
<p>The present Admiralty-office was rebuilt in the late reign, by <hi rend=italics>Ripley:</hi> it is a clumsy pile, but <pb id="p.149" n="149"> properly veiled from the street by Mr. <hi rend=italics>Adams's</hi> handsome screen.<note>Mr. <hi rend=italics>Walpole.</hi></NOTE>
<p>A little farther to the north stood, in the <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Palace For Kings of Scotland.</NOTE> place now occupied by <hi rend=italics>Scotland-yard,</hi> a magnificent palace built for the reception of the <hi rend=italics>Scottish</hi> monarchs, whenever they visited this capital. It was originally given by king <hi rend=italics>Edgar</hi> to king <hi rend=italics>Kenneth</hi> III. for the humiliating purpose of his making to this place an annual journey, for the purpose of doing homage for the kingdom of <hi rend=italics>Scotland,</hi> and in after times for <hi rend=italics>Cumberland</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Huntingdon,</hi> and other fiefs of the crown. Here <hi rend=italics>Margaret,</hi> widow of <hi rend=italics>James</hi> IV. of <hi rend=italics>Scotland,</hi> and sister to <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. resided for a considerable time after the death of her husband: and was entertained with great magnificence by her royal brother, as soon as he was reconciled to her <num value="2">second</num> marriage with the earl of <hi rend=italics>Angus.</hi>

<p>A little above stood <num value="1">one</num> of the celebrated <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Charing-cross.</placename></NOTE> memorials of the affection of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> I. for his beloved <hi rend=italics>Eleanor,</hi> being the cross erected on the last spot on which the body rested in the way to the Abbey, the place of sepulture. This and all the others were built after the designs of <hi rend=italics>Cavalini.</hi> This was destroyed by the religious fury of the reformers. From a drawing communicated to me by Doctor <hi rend=italics>Combe,</hi> it appears to have been of an <pb id="p.150" n="150"> octagonal form, and in an upper stage ornamented with <num value="8">eight</num> figures: but the <hi rend=italics>gothic</hi> parts appear far from being rich.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Fine Statue of Charles I.</NOTE> THE cross was in the next century replaced by a most beautiful and animated equestrian statue in brass, of <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> I. cast in <datestruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>, by <hi rend=italics>Le S&oelig;ur,</hi> for the earl of <hi rend=italics>Arundel.</hi> It was not erected till the year <datestruct value="1678"><year reg="1678">1678</year></datestruct>, when it was placed on the present pedestal, the work of <hi rend=italics>Grinlyn Gibbons.</hi> The parlement had ordered it to be sold and broke to pieces: but <hi rend=italics>John River,</hi> the brazier who purchased it, having more taste or more loyalty than his masters, buried it unmutilated, and shewed to them some broken pieces of brass in token of his obedience. M. <hi rend=italics>d'Archenholz</hi> gives a diverting anecdote of this brazier: he says, that he cast a vast number of handles of knives and forks in brass, which he sold as made of the broken statue. They were bought with great eagerness; by the loyalists, from affection to their monarch; by the rebels, as a mark of triumph over the murdered sovereign.<note>See M. <hi rend=italics>Archenholz's Tableau d&lsquo;Angleterre,</hi> i. <num value="163">163</num>.</NOTE>
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>St. Mary Rounceval.</NOTE> ON the site of part of <hi rend=italics>Northumberland-house,</hi> stood the chapel of <hi rend=italics>St. Mary Rounceval,</hi> a cell to the priory of <hi rend=italics>Rouncevaux,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Navarre.</hi> It was founded by <hi rend=italics>William Marshal</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Pembroke,</hi> in the time of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> III., and suppressed by <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> V. among the alien priories, but rebuilt by <pb id="p.151" n="151"> <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> IV. who fixed a fraternity in it.<note><hi rend=italics>Newcourt,</hi> i. <num value="693">693</num>.</NOTE> In the reign of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> VI. a grant was made of the site to Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Cawarden.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Tanner.</hi></NOTE>
<p>NOT far from hence, opposite to <hi rend=italics>Charing-Cross,</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Hermitage.</NOTE> was an hermitage, with a chapel dedicated to <hi rend=italics>St. Catherine.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Stow's Survaie,</hi> <num value="839">839</num>.</NOTE> This, in <datestruct value="1262--"><year reg="1262">1262</year></datestruct>, belonged to the see of <hi rend=italics>Llandaff;</hi> for I find in that year that <hi rend=italics>William de Radnor,</hi> then bishop, had leave from the king to lodge in the cloister of his hermitage at <hi rend=italics>Charing,</hi> whenever he came to <hi rend=italics>London.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Willis's Landaff,</hi> <num value="51">51</num>.</NOTE>
<p>ON the north side of <hi rend=italics>Charing-Cross</hi> stand the <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Mews.</NOTE> royal stables, called from the original use of the buildings on their site, the <hi rend=italics>Mews;</hi> having been used for keeping the king's falcons, at lest from the time of <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> II. In that reign the accomplished Sir <hi rend=italics>Simon Burley,</hi> knight of the garter, was keeper of the king's falcons at the <hi rend=italics>Meuse,</hi> near <hi rend=italics>Charing-Cross.</hi> This office was by <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> II. granted to his son by <hi rend=italics>Nell Gwynne, Charles</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>St. Albans,</hi> and the heirs male of his body. In the reign of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. the king's horses were kept here. In <datestruct value="1534--"><year reg="1534">1534</year></datestruct> a fire destroyed the building, with a great quantity of hay, and several great horses. It was rebuilt in the reigns of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> VI. and queen <hi rend=italics>Mary.</hi> In the year <datestruct value="1732"><year reg="1732">1732</year></datestruct> the present handsome edifice arose.
<p>St. James's palace was originally a hospital, <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>St. James's Palace.</placename></NOTE> <pb id="p.152" n="152"> founded and dedicated to <hi rend=italics>St. James,</hi> by some pious citizens, before the Conquest, for <num value="14">fourteen</num> leprous females: and <num value="8">eight</num> brethren were added afterwards, to perform divine service. It was rebuilt in the time of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> III. The custody was given to <hi rend=italics>Eton</hi> college, by a grant of the <num value="28">28th</num> of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VI. but I am told that the living of <hi rend=italics>Chattisham,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Suffolk,</hi> was exchanged for it; the college, on this consideration, having resigned it to <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. At that time its revenue was valued at <num value="100">100</num><hi rend=italics>l. per annum.</hi> On the quarrel between the great earl of <hi rend=italics>Warwick</hi> and lord <hi rend=italics>Cromwel,</hi> about the cause of the <num value="1">first</num> battle of <hi rend=italics>St. Albans,</hi> lord <hi rend=italics>Cromwel,</hi> fearing the rage of that violent peer, was at his own desire lodged here, by way of security, by <hi rend=italics>John Talbot</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Shrewsbury,</hi> at that time lord treasurer of <hi rend=italics>England.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Fenn's</hi> Letters, i. <num value="110">110</num>.</NOTE> It was surrendered to the king in <datestruct value="1531--"><year reg="1531">1531</year></datestruct>, who founded on its site the present palace, which <hi rend=italics>Stow</hi> calls a goodly manor. <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>St. James's Park.</placename></NOTE> His majesty also inclosed the park, which was subservient to the amusement of this and the palace of <hi rend=italics>Whitehall. Charles</hi> II. was particularly fond of it, planted the avenues, made the canal, and the aviary, adjacent to the <hi rend=italics>Bird-cage-walk,</hi> which took its name from the cages which were hung in the trees. <hi rend=italics>Charles,</hi> says <hi rend=italics>Cibber,</hi> was often seen here, amidst crowds of spectators, feeding his <pb id="p.153" n="153"> ducks, and playing with his dogs,<note>Apology for the life of <hi rend=italics>Colley Cibber,</hi> <num value="26">26</num>.</NOTE> and passing his idle moments in affability even to the meanest of his subjects, which made him to be adored by the common people; so fascinating in the great are the habits of condescension!
<p>DUCK-ISLAND was erected into a government, <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Duck-island.</placename></NOTE> and had a salary annexed to the office, in favor of <hi rend=italics>M. St. Evremond,</hi> who was the <num value="1">first</num> and perhaps the last governor:<note><hi rend=italics>S. Pegge,</hi> esq.</NOTE> and the island itself is lost in the late improvements.
<p>AT the south end of <hi rend=italics>Duke-street,</hi> adjacent to this part of the park, is a large house once used for the Admiralty-office (see p. <num value="148">148</num>). It was <num value="1">first</num> built for lord chancellor <hi rend=italics>Jefferies,</hi> and is easily known by a large flight of stone steps which his royal master permitted to be made into the park for the accommodation of his lordship:<note><hi rend=italics>Stow's London,</hi> ii. book vi. p. <num value="64">64</num>.</NOTE> they terminate above in a small court, on <num value="3">three</num> sides of which stands the house. On the left is the chapel now called <hi rend=italics>Duke-street</hi> chapel. In the time of <hi rend=italics>Jefferies,</hi> it was the hall in which his lordship heard causes, whenever it was inconvenient for him to go to <hi rend=italics>Westminster-hall</hi> or to <hi rend=italics>Lincoln's-inn.</hi>

<p>NOT far from hence, where the iron gates, at the bottom of that noble street <hi rend=italics>George-street,</hi> are placed, stood a storehouse for the ordinance in the time of queen <hi rend=italics>Mary.</hi> I remember a dirty dark <pb id="p.154" n="154"> passage leading into the park, which preserves its memory, but was corruptly called <hi rend=italics>Story's Gate.</hi>

<p>IT does not appear that this palace was inhabited by any of our monarchs till after the fire at <hi rend=italics>Whitehall. James</hi> I. presented it to his accomplished son <hi rend=italics>Henry,</hi> who resided here till his lamented death in <datestruct value="1612--"><year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct>. <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> I. was brought here from <hi rend=italics>Windsor,</hi> on <hi rend=italics>January</hi> <num value="19">19th</num>,<note><hi rend=italics>Whitelock.</hi></NOTE> by the power of the army, which had determined on his death. Some of the <num value="11">eleven</num> days which he was permitted to live were spent in <hi rend=italics>Westminster-hall,</hi> and of the nights in the house of Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Cotton,</hi> adjacent to his place of trial. On the <num value="27">27th</num> he was carried back to <hi rend=italics>St. James's,</hi> where he passed his <num value="3">three</num> last days in exemplary piety. On the <num value="30">30th</num> he was brought to the place of execution; and walked, unmoved at every insult, with a firm and quick pace, supported by the most lively sentiments of religion.
<p>His son, the bigoted <hi rend=italics>James,</hi> sent to the prince of <hi rend=italics>Orange,</hi> when he had approached in force near to the capital, a most necessitated invitation to take his lodgings in this palace. The prince accepted it: but at the same time hinted to the frightened monarch that he must leave <hi rend=italics>Whitehall.</hi> It was customary to mount guard at both the palaces. The old hero lord <hi rend=italics>Craven</hi> was on duty at <pb id="p.155" n="155"> the time when the <hi rend=italics>Dutch</hi> guards were marching through the park to relieve, by order of their master. From a point of honor he had determined not to quit his station, and was preparing to maintain his post; but, receiving the command of his sovereign, he reluctantly withdrew his party and marched away with sullen dignity.<note><hi rend=italics>Dalrymple's</hi> Memons.</NOTE>
<p>DURING the reign of king <hi rend=italics>William, St. James's</hi> was fitted up for the residence of the princess <hi rend=italics>Anne</hi> (afterwards queen) and her spouse prince <hi rend=italics>George</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Denmark.</hi> From that time to the present it has been regularly the court of our monarchs.
<p>JAMES, the son of <hi rend=italics>James</hi> II., who so long made pretensions to the <hi rend=italics>British</hi> throne, was born in the room now called the old bed-chamber; at present the anti-chamber to the levee room. The bed stood close to the door of a back-stairs, which descended to an inner court. It certainly was very convenient to carry on any secret design; and might favor the silly warming-pan story, had not the bed been surrounded by <num value="20">twenty</num> of the privy-council, <num value="4">four</num> other men of rank, <num value="20">twenty</num> ladies, besides pages and other attendants. The tale was adopted by party, and firmly believed by its zealots. But, as <hi rend=italics>James</hi> proved false to his high trust, and his son shewed every symptom of following <pb id="p.156" n="156"> his example, there was certainly no such pretence wanting for excluding a family inimical to the interests of the GREAT WHOLE.
<p>UNCREDITABLE as the outside of <hi rend=italics>St. James's</hi> may look, it is said to be the most commodious for regal parade of any in <hi rend=italics>Europe.</hi> Every <num value="1">one</num> knows that the furniture of this palace is unbecoming the place. Yet in a ramble I once made through the apartments, I saw several portraits of personages <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Portraits.</NOTE> remarkable in their day. Among others (in <num value="1">one</num> of the rooms behind the levee rooms) is a small fulllength of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> prince of <hi rend=italics>Wales,</hi> son of <hi rend=italics>James</hi> I. He is dressed in green, standing over a dead stag, drawing a sword, probably to cut off its head, according to the custom of the chace. A youth, <hi rend=italics>Robert</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Essex,</hi> afterwards the <hi rend=italics>parlementarian</hi> general, is kneeling before him; each of them have hunting horns; and behind the prince is a horse; and on the bough of a tree are the arms of <hi rend=italics>England;</hi> and behind the young lord, on the ground, are his own. These are the bearings of the <hi rend=italics>Devereuxes,</hi> and prove the mistake of Mr. <hi rend=italics>Granger,</hi> and of Mr. <hi rend=italics>Warton,</hi> who, in his Life of Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Pope,</hi> I am told, attributes them to lord <hi rend=italics>Harrington;</hi> but his arms were a <hi rend=italics>fret</hi> on a field <hi rend=italics>sable.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Wright's Rutlandshire,</hi> <num value="51">51</num>.</NOTE> Both these young noblemen were honored with the friendship of that accomplished <pb id="p.157" n="157"> prince, and both educated with him. At <hi rend=italics>Wroxton,</hi> the seat of the earl of <hi rend=italics>Guildford,</hi> is another picture of the same subject.<note>On this picture, engraved by <hi rend=italics>Harding</hi> in the Biographical Mirrour, ii. p. <num value="53">53</num>, are the <hi rend=italics>Harrington</hi> arms, on a shield near the prince's young associate.

<p>HERE is another small piece, of <hi rend=italics>Arthur,</hi> elder brother to <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII., painted very young, with a bonnet on his head. <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> stands by him, and his sister <hi rend=italics>Margaret,</hi> of infant ages. This picture is by <hi rend=italics>Mabuse,</hi> who visited <hi rend=italics>England</hi> in the reign of their father.
<p>HENRY VII. and VIII. full-lengths, and each of them with his queen before an altar. The fortunate <hi rend=italics>Jane Seymour</hi> (who died in her bed) is the consort of the son, here represented.

<p>THE diminutive manhood of the dwarf <hi rend=italics>Geoffry Hudson,</hi> is to be seen in another picture. He appears less by being represented walking under some very tall trees.
<p>IN the lords old waiting-room is <hi rend=italics>Henry Darnley,</hi> in black, tall and genteel. His hand is resting on his brother <hi rend=italics>Charles Stuart,</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Lenox,</hi> dressed in a black gown.
<p>IN another room is <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> II. of <hi rend=italics>Spain,</hi> at the age of <num value="4">four</num>, in black, with a sceptre in his hand, strutting and playing the monarch. He was inaugurated in <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>. His reign was unhappy. <hi rend=italics>Spain</hi> at no period was in so low, so distressful a condition. His dominions were parcelled out in his life-time: but he disappointed the allies, and, after some struggle, the designation of his will in favor of the house of <hi rend=italics>Bourbon</hi> took place.
<p>HERE is to be seen the famous picture by <hi rend=italics>Mabuse,</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Adam</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Eve.</hi> Mr. <hi rend=italics>Evelyn</hi> justly remarks the absurdity of painting them with navels, and of introducing a fountain with rich imagery amidst the beauteous wilds of paradise. <hi rend=italics>Raphael,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Michael Angelo,</hi> made the same mistake with <pb id="p.159" n="159"> regard to the navel, on which the learned Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Brown</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Vulgar Errors,</hi> p. <num value="194">194</num>.</NOTE> wastes a long page and a half to disprove its possibility.
<p>IN the queen's library (built by queen <hi rend=italics>Caroline,</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Queen's Library.</NOTE> and ornamented by <hi rend=italics>Kent</hi>) now a lumber-room, I saw a beautiful view from <hi rend=italics>Greenwich</hi> park, with <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> I., his queen, and a number of courtiers, walking. And <num value="2">two</num> others, of the same prince and his queen dining in public. And another of the elector palatine and his spouse at a public table; with a carver, looking most ridiculously, a monkey having in that moment reared from the board and seized on his beard. Possibly this feast was at <hi rend=italics>Guildhall,</hi> where <hi rend=italics>Frederic</hi> was most nobly entertained by the hospitable city, in <datestruct value="1612--"><year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct>, when he made the match with the daughter of our monarch, which ended so unhappily for both parties.
<p>TO the east of <hi rend=italics>St. James's</hi> palace, in the reign <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Marlborough-house.</placename></NOTE> of queen <hi rend=italics>Anne,</hi> was built <hi rend=italics>Marlborough-house,</hi> at the expence of the public.

The present duke added an upper story, and improved the ground floor, which originally wanted the great room. This national compliment cost not less than <measure value="40000l." type=currency><num value="40000">forty thousand</num> pounds</measure>. <pb id="p.160" n="160">

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Assassination of Thynne.</NOTE> IN this street was committed the horrid assassination of <hi rend=italics>Thomas Thynne,</hi> esq., of <hi rend=italics>Longleat,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>February</hi> <datestruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></datestruct>-<num value="2">2</num>, at the instigation of count <hi rend=italics>Coningsmark,</hi> a <hi rend=italics>Swedish</hi> nobleman of the <num value="1">first</num> rank and fortune, in hopes of gaining lady <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth Ogle,</hi> the rich heiress, daughter to <hi rend=italics>Josceline,</hi> last earl of <hi rend=italics>Northumberland</hi> of the name of <hi rend=italics>Percy,</hi> and widow to <hi rend=italics>Henry Cavendish</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Ogle,</hi> son to <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>Newcastle. Thynne</hi> was either married or contracted to the lady. The count hoped by the removal of his rival to attain his purpose. He had been in <hi rend=italics>England</hi> and made his addresses to her; but not with the success he expected: left the kingdom for a short time, and then returned to put his horrid design in execution.

<p>THE gallant earl of <hi rend=italics>Devonshire</hi> would have avenged the death of his friend. <hi rend=italics>Coningsmark</hi> accepted the challenge, but his conscience prevented him from meeting the earl. <hi rend=italics>Thynne</hi> was a most contemptible character, and passed through the world, as is frequent even to this day, by the merit of a great fortune.

<p>WHERE <hi rend=italics>Sackville-street</hi> was afterwards built, stood <hi rend=italics>Piccadilla hall,</hi> where <hi rend=italics>Piccadillas</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Turnovers</hi> were sold, which gave name to that vast street, called from that circumstance <hi rend=italics>Piccadilly.</hi> This street was completed, in <datestruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct>, as far as the present <hi rend=italics>Berkeley-street.</hi> The <num value="1">first</num> good house <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Burlington-House.</placename></NOTE> which was built in it was <hi rend=italics>Burlington-house:</hi> the noble founder, father to the late earl of <hi rend=italics>Burlington,</hi> said he placed it there &ldquo;because he was certain no <num value="1">one</num> would build beyond him.&rdquo; Nobody is ignorant of the vast town that, since that period, has extended itself beyond this palace.

<p>THE <hi rend=italics>Pest-house-field</hi> was surrounded with buildings before the year <datestruct value="1700"><year reg="1700">1700</year></datestruct>, but remained a <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Carnaby-market.</placename></NOTE> dirty waste till of late years, when <hi rend=italics>Carnabymarket</hi> occupied much of the west part.

It was originally called <hi rend=italics>Gelding-square,</hi> from the sign of a neighboring inn; but the inhabitants, indignant at the vulgarity of the name, changed it to the present.<note>This anecdote was communicated by the late earl of <hi rend=italics>Bath</hi> to a friend of mine.</NOTE> In these fields was the <hi rend=italics>lazaretto,</hi> during the period of the dreadful plague of the year <datestruct value="1665"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>.

<p>IN <datestruct value="1700--"><year reg="1700">1700</year></datestruct> <hi rend=italics>Bond-street</hi> was built no farther than <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Bond-street.</placename></NOTE> the west end of <hi rend=italics>Clifford-street.</hi> It took its name from the proprietor, a baronet of a family now extinct. <hi rend=italics>New Bond-street</hi> was at that time an open field, called <hi rend=italics>Conduit Mead,</hi> from <num value="1">one</num> of the conduits which supplied this part of the town with water: and <hi rend=italics>Conduit-street</hi> received its name for the same reason.
<p><hi rend=italics>GEORGE-street, Hanover-square,</hi> and its church, <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>St. George's, Hanover-square.</placename></NOTE> rose about the same time. The church was built by <hi rend=italics>John James,</hi> and finished in <datestruct value="1724--"><year reg="1724">1724</year></datestruct>. Its portico would be thought handsome were there space to <pb id="p.168" n="168"> admire it. It now looks <hi rend=italics>Brobdignagian.</hi> This was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="50">fifty</num> new churches, and the parish stolen out of that of <hi rend=italics>St. Martin in the Fields.</hi> It is the last in this part of <hi rend=italics>Westminster,</hi> excepting the distant <hi rend=italics>Marybonne.</hi> Every part besides was open ground covered with dunghills, and all sorts <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>May-Fair.</placename></NOTE> of filth. <hi rend=italics>May Fair</hi> was kept about the spot now covered with <hi rend=italics>May-Fair</hi> chapel, and several fine streets. The fair was attended with such disorders, riots, thefts, and even murders, that, in <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, it was presented by the magistrates. It revived again, and I remember the last celebrations: the place was covered with booths, temporary theatres, and every enticement to low pleasure.
<p>AT the time of Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Wiat's</hi> insurrection, in <hi rend=italics>February,</hi> <datestruct value="1554--"><year reg="1554">1554</year></datestruct>, part of the army marched to make their attack on <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> over this tract, then an open country as far as <hi rend=italics>Charing-Cross.</hi> On the spot called <hi rend=italics>Hay-hill,</hi> near the present <hi rend=italics>Berkeleysquare,</hi> there was a skirmish between a party of the insurgents and another of the royal army, in which the former were repulsed. After the execution of Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas,</hi> his head (on that account) was set up on a gallows, at that place,<note><hi rend=italics>Strype's</hi> Memorials, iii. <num value="120">120</num>.</NOTE> and his parboiled quarters in different parts of the neighborhood of the capital. <num value="3">Three</num> of the insurgents <pb id="p.169" n="169"> were also hung in chains near the head of their leader.
<p>THIS extensive tract, at present a vast seat of the most elegant population, is far from being destitute of places of devotion: but chapels arose instead of churches, subordinate to their respective rectors. In this enlightened age it was quickly discovered that &ldquo;Godliness was profitable to many.&rdquo; The projector, the architect, the mason, the carpenter, and the plasterer, united their powers. A chapel was erected, well-pewed, wellwarmed, dedicated, un-endowed, un-consecrated. A captivating preacher is provided, the pews are filled, and the good undertakers amply repayed by the pious tenantry.
<p>THE history of <hi rend=italics>Conduit-street</hi> chapel, or <hi rend=italics>Trinity</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Conduit-street Chapel.</placename></NOTE> chapel, is very remarkable. It was originally built of wood by <hi rend=italics>James</hi> II. for private mass, and was conveyed on wheels, attendant on its royal master's excursions, or when he attended his army. Among other places, it visited <hi rend=italics>Hounslow</hi> heath, where it continued some time after the Revolution. It was then removed, and enlarged by the rector of the parish of <hi rend=italics>St. Martin's,</hi> and placed not far from the spot on which it now stands. Dr. <hi rend=italics>Tennison,</hi> when rector of <hi rend=italics>Saint Martin's,</hi> got permission from king <hi rend=italics>William</hi> to rebuild it: so after it had made as many journies as the house of <hi rend=italics>Loretto,</hi> it was by <hi rend=italics>Tennison</hi> transmuted into a good <pb id="p.170" n="170"> building of brick, and has rested ever since on the present site. All parochial duties have been performed from that time without intermission; and it continued annexed to the parish of <hi rend=italics>Saint Martin's,</hi> which sold it about <num value="15">fifteen</num> years ago to Mr. <hi rend=italics>James Robson,</hi> the present proprietor, who has modernized the building with a new front, and fitted up the inside with great neatness and propriety.
<p>THE late <hi rend=italics>Carew Mildmay,</hi> esq; who, after a very long life, died a few years ago, used to say, that he remembered killing a woodcock on the site of <hi rend=italics>Conduit-street,</hi> at that time an open country. He and general <hi rend=italics>Oglethorpe</hi> were great intimates, and nearly of the same age; and often produced proofs to each other of the length of their recollection.

<p>&ldquo;GRATITUDE prompts me to mention a most irreparable loss in my amiable friend, <hi rend=italics>Benjamin Stillingfleet,</hi> esquire, in whom were joined the best heart, and the ablest head.

How great, yet how unnecessary was his diffidence in public: how ample his instruction in private! How clear his information: how delicate the conveyance! The pupil received advantage, edified by the humility of the master. Thoroughly imbued in divine philosophy, he had an uncommon insight into the uses of every object of natural history; and <pb id="p.186" n="186"> gave sanction to those studies which, by trivial observers, are held most contemptible. The end of his labors was the good of mankind. He attempted to destroy the false shame that attended the devotee to ornithology; the chace of the insect; the search after the cockle; or the poring over the grass. He proved every subject to be of the greatest service to the world, by the proper remarks that might be made on them: the traveller, the sailor, the husbandman might, if they pleased, draw the most useful conclusions from them.&rdquo; He pointed out in the philosophy of nature the most unerring guide.

<p>THERE was no continued street here till about <NOTE PLACE=MARG>The Street Completed in <datestruct value="1533--"><year reg="1533">1533</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> the year <datestruct value="1533"><year reg="1533">1533</year></datestruct>: before that time, it entirely cut off <hi rend=italics>Westminster</hi> from <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> and nothing intervened except a few scattered houses, and a village which <pb id="p.188" n="188"> afterwards gave name to the whole. <hi rend=italics>St. Martin's</hi> stood literally in the fields. But about the year <datestruct value="1560"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct> a street was formed, loosely built; for all the houses on the south side had great gardens to the river, were called by their owners names, and in after-times gave name to the several streets that succeeded them, pointing down to the <hi rend=italics>Thames;</hi> each of them had stairs for the conveniency of taking boat, of which many to this day bear the names of the houses. As the court was for centuries, either at the palace at <hi rend=italics>Westminster</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Whitehall,</hi> a boat was the customary conveyance of the great to the presence of their sovereign. The north side was a mere line of houses from <hi rend=italics>Charing-Cross</hi> to <hi rend=italics>Temple-bar;</hi> all beyond was country. The gardens which occupied part of the site of <hi rend=italics>Covent-Garden</hi> were bounded by fields, and <hi rend=italics>St. Giles's</hi> was a distant country village. These are circumstances proper to be noticed, as they shew the vast increase of our capital in little more than <num value="2">two</num> centuries.
<p>IN the same century was a <num value="2">second</num> epoch respecting the buildings of this part of the town. The <num value="1">first</num> was at the time we have mentioned, or, to speak from strong authority, as they appear in the plan of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> made about the year <datestruct value="1562"><year reg="1562">1562</year></datestruct>, by <hi rend=italics>Ralph Aggas.</hi> Our capital found itself so secure in the glorious government of <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth,</hi> that, by <pb id="p.189" n="189"> the year <datestruct value="1600"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct>,<note>See the plan of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> as it was in the year <datestruct value="1600"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct>, published by <hi rend=italics>John Bowles.</hi></NOTE> most considerable additions were made to the north of the long line of street just described. <hi rend=italics>St. Martin's-lane</hi> was built on both sides. <hi rend=italics>St. Giles's</hi> church was still insulated: but <hi rend=italics>Broad-street,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Holborn,</hi> were completely formed into streets, with houses all the way to <hi rend=italics>Snowhill. Covent-garden,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Lincoln's-inn-fields,</hi> were built, but in an irregular manner. <hi rend=italics>Drury-lane, Clare-street,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Long-acre,</hi> arose in the same period.
<p>THE present magnificent palace, <hi rend=italics>Northumberland-house,</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Northumberland-house.</placename></NOTE> stands on the site of the hospital of <hi rend=italics>St. Mary Rounceval. Henry</hi> VIII. granted it to Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Cavarden.</hi> It was afterward transferred to <hi rend=italics>Henry Howard</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Northampton;</hi> who, in the time of <hi rend=italics>James</hi> I. built here a house, and called it after his own name. He left it to his kinsman the earl of <hi rend=italics>Suffolk,</hi> lord treasurer; and, by the marriage of <hi rend=italics>Algernoon Percy,</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Northumberland,</hi> with <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth</hi> daughter of <hi rend=italics>Theophilus</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Suffolk,</hi> it passed into the house of the present noble owner. The greater part of the house was built by <hi rend=italics>Bernard Jansen,</hi> an architect in the reign of <hi rend=italics>James</hi> I.; the portal, since altered by the late duke of <hi rend=italics>Northumberland,</hi> by a cotemporary architect, <hi rend=italics>Gerard Christmas,</hi> who left on it his mark, C. &AElig;.<note>Mr. <hi rend=italics>Walpole.</hi></NOTE> <pb id="p.190" n="190"> In this house is the noble picture of the <hi rend=italics>Cornaro</hi> family, by <hi rend=italics>Titian.</hi> It is very unfortunate that nothing can be more confined than the situation. The noble front is pent up by a very narrow part of the <hi rend=italics>Strand;</hi> and at the back by a cluster of mean houses, coal-wharfs, and other offensive objects, as far as the banks of the <hi rend=italics>Thames.</hi> Fortunately, by the favor of government, the power is now obtained of giving the place the most magnificent improvement. The late duke received a lease from the crown of all the intervening ground as far as the river; and, within these very few years, an absolute exchange for certain lands in <hi rend=italics>Northumberland,</hi> to erect batteries on against foreign invasion, at the period when the project of universal fortification prevaled. In a short time all nuisances may be removed, and in their stead may be seen to arise a terrace emulating that of <hi rend=italics>Somerset-house:</hi> with a view to which the grant is said to have been solicited.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Hungerford Stairs.</placename></NOTE> A LITTLE farther are <hi rend=italics>Hungerford</hi> stairs and market; which take their name from the great family of the <hi rend=italics>Hungerfords</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Fairleigh,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Wiltshire.</hi> Sir <hi rend=italics>Edward,</hi> created knight of the Bath at the coronation of <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> II. had a large house on the site, which he pulled down, and multiplied into several others. On the north side of the market-house is a bust of <num value="1">one</num> of the family in a large wig. <pb id="p.191" n="191">
<p>ON the other side of the <hi rend=italics>Strand,</hi> almost opposite <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>St. Martin's in the Fields.</placename></NOTE> to <hi rend=italics>Hungerford-market,</hi> stands the church of <hi rend=italics>St. Martin in the Fields,</hi> once a parish of vast extent; but much reduced at present by taking from it the tract now divided into the parishes of <hi rend=italics>St. James, St. Anne,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>St. Paul, Coventgarden.</hi> We cannot trace the time of its foundation. It was early bestowed on the abbot and convent of <hi rend=italics>St. Peter, Westminster.</hi> In <datestruct value="1222--"><year reg="1222">1222</year></datestruct>, there was a dispute between the abbot and the city of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> about the jurisdiction of this church.

In <datestruct value="1607--"><year reg="1607">1607</year></datestruct> it was enlarged, because of the increase of buildings. In <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct> it was found necessary to take the whole down; and in <num value="5">five</num> years from that time, the present magnificent temple<note>It is engraven by <hi rend=italics>H.

This seems the best performance of <hi rend=italics>Gibbs,</hi> the architect of the <hi rend=italics>Ratcliff Library.</hi>

<p>A LITTLE beyond <hi rend=italics>Hungerford-market</hi> had been of old the bishop of <hi rend=italics>Norwich's</hi> inn; but was exchanged in <datestruct value="1535--"><year reg="1535">1535</year></datestruct>, in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. <pb id="p.192" n="192"> for the Abbey of <hi rend=italics>St. Bennet Holme,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Norfolk.</hi> The next year <hi rend=italics>Charles Brandon,</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>Suffolk,</hi> exchanged his house, called <hi rend=italics>Southwark-place,</hi> for it.

The lords chancellors <hi rend=italics>Egerton</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Bacon</hi> resided in it: after which it was granted to the favorite <hi rend=italics>Villiers</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>Buckingham,</hi> who made it a magnificent house. In <datestruct value="1648--"><year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct> the parlement bestowed it on lord <hi rend=italics>Fairfax;</hi> whose daughter and heir marrying <hi rend=italics>George Villiers,</hi> <num value="2">second</num> duke of <hi rend=italics>Buckingham,</hi> it reverted again to the true owner, who for some years after the Restoration resided in it.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Durham-place.</placename></NOTE> DURHAM-YARD takes its name from a palace, built originally by <hi rend=italics>Anthony de Beck,</hi> patriarch of <hi rend=italics>Jerusalem,</hi> and bishop of <hi rend=italics>Durham,</hi> in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> I; designed by him for his town residence <pb id="p.193" n="193"> and that of his successors. It was rebuilt by bishop <hi rend=italics>Thomas de Hatfield,</hi> who died in <datestruct value="1381--"><year reg="1381">1381</year></datestruct>. Bishop <hi rend=italics>Tunstal</hi> exchanged it with <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. who made it a palace. <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> VI. gave it for life to his sister <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth:</hi> but <hi rend=italics>Mary,</hi> considering the gift as sacrilege, granted the reversion to the see of <hi rend=italics>Durham.</hi> It was called <hi rend=italics>Durhamplace,</hi> i. e. palace. Be it known to all whom it concerns, that the word is only applicable to the habitations of princes, or princely persons, and that it is with all the impropriety of vanity bestowed on the houses of those who have luckily acquired money enough to pile on <num value="1">one</num> another a greater quantity of stones or bricks than their neighbors. How many imaginary <hi rend=italics>Parks</hi> have been formed within precincts where deer were never seen! and how many houses, misnamed <hi rend=italics>Halls,</hi> which never had attached to them the privilege <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Great Feasting Here in <datestruct value="1540--"><year reg="1540">1540</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> of a manor!

But both challengers and defendants were <hi rend=italics>English.</hi> After the gallant sports of each day, the challengers rode unto this <hi rend=italics>Durham-house,</hi> where they kept open household, and feasted the king and queen (<hi rend=italics>Anne</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Cleves</hi>) with her ladies, and <pb id="p.194" n="194"> all the court. &ldquo;In this time of their housekeeping, they had not only feasted the king, queen, ladies, and all the court, as is aforeshewed; but also they cheered al the knights and burgesses of the common house in the parliament; and entertained the maior of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> with the aldermen and their wives, at a dinner, &amp;c.

<p>IN this and part of the following year, is most strongly exemplified the unfeeling heart of this cruel prince. His sudden transitions from nuptials, and joyous festivities, to the most tyrannical executions, often for offences of his own creation. In that small space of time, he married <num value="1">one</num> queen, and put her away, because he thought her a <hi rend=italics>Flanders</hi> mare. He espoused another, and (not without cause) put her and the confident to her incontinence to death. He caused to be executed a hopeful young peer, and <num value="3">three</num> young gentlemen, for a common manslaughter resulting from a sudden fray. He burnt numbers for denying the religion of <hi rend=italics>Rome,</hi> and inflicted all the barbarous penalties <pb id="p.195" n="195"> of high treason on multitudes, for denying a prerogative which he had wrested from the pope, the head of that very worship which he supported with such rigour.
<p>IN the reign of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> VI. the mint was established in this house, under the management of Sir <hi rend=italics>William Sharrington,</hi> and the influence of the aspiring <hi rend=italics>Thomas Seymour,</hi> lord admiral. Here he proposed to have money enough coined to accomplish his designs on the throne. His practices were detected: and he suffered death. His tool was also condemned; but, sacrificing his master to his own safety, received a pardon, and was again employed under the administration of <hi rend=italics>John Dudley</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Northumberland.</hi> It afterward became the residence of that ambitious man; who, in <hi rend=italics>May</hi> <datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>, in this palace, caused to be solemnized, with great magnificence, <num value="3">three</num> marriages; his son, lord <hi rend=italics>Guildford Dudley,</hi> with the amiable lady <hi rend=italics>Jane Grey:</hi> lord <hi rend=italics>Herbert,</hi> heir to the earl of <hi rend=italics>Pembroke,</hi> with <hi rend=italics>Catherine</hi> younger sister of lady <hi rend=italics>Jane:</hi> and lord <hi rend=italics>Hastings,</hi> heir to the earl of <hi rend=italics>Huntingdon,</hi> with his youngest daughter lady <hi rend=italics>Catherine Dudley.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Holinshed,</hi>

<p>DURHAM-HOUSE was reckoned <num value="1">one</num> of the royal palaces belonging to queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth;</hi> who gave the use of it to the great Sir <hi rend=italics>Walter Raleigh.</hi> In <datestruct value="1640--"><year reg="1640">1640</year></datestruct> it was purchased of the see by <hi rend=italics>Philip</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Pembroke,</hi> who pulled it down and built houses on the site.
<p>ON the mention of <hi rend=italics>Raleigh,</hi> let me say, that illustrious character had a house at <hi rend=italics>Islington</hi>
(perhaps) his <hi rend=italics>villa,</hi> now known by the name of the <hi rend=italics>Pyed Bull Inn.</hi> It is still standing, but makes a poor figure, compared with the modern erections, its pert neighbors, on every side.

<p>DURHAM-YARD is now filled with a most magnificent <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Adelphi.</placename></NOTE> mass of building, called the <hi rend=italics>Adelphi,</hi> in honor of <num value="2">two</num> brothers, its architects, purchasers of the houses built by the earl of <hi rend=italics>Pembroke.</hi> Before the front to the <hi rend=italics>Thames</hi> is a terrace, commanding a charming view towards the river, when it is not obscured by the damps and poisonous fogs which too often infest the air of the lower part of our capital.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>The New Exchange.</NOTE> TO the north of <hi rend=italics>Durham-place,</hi> fronting the <pb id="p.197" n="197"> street, stood the <hi rend=italics>New Exchange,</hi> which was built under the auspices of our monarch, in <datestruct value="1608--"><year reg="1608">1608</year></datestruct>, out of the rubbish of the old stables of <hi rend=italics>Durhamhouse.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Wilson,</hi>

This was a fashionable place of resort. In <datestruct value="1654--"><year reg="1654">1654</year></datestruct> a fatal affair happened here. Mr. <hi rend=italics>Gerard,</hi> a young gentleman, at that time engaged in a plot against <hi rend=italics>Cromwell,</hi> was amusing himself in the walk beneath, when he was insulted by <hi rend=italics>Don Pantaleon de Saa,</hi> brother to the ambassador of <hi rend=italics>Portugal,</hi> who, disliking the return he met with, determined on revenge. He came there the next day with a set of bravos, who, mistaking another gentleman for Mr. <hi rend=italics>Gerard,</hi> instantly put him to death, as he was walking with his sister in <num value="1">one</num> hand, and his mistress in the other. <hi rend=italics>Don Pantaleon</hi> was with impartial justice tried, and condemned to the axe. Mr. <hi rend=italics>Gerard,</hi> who about the same time was detected in the conspiracy, was likewise condemned to die. By a singular chance both the rivals suffered on the same scaffold, within a few hours of eath other; Mr. <hi rend=italics>Gerard</hi> with <pb id="p.198" n="198"> intrepid dignity: the <hi rend=italics>Portuguese</hi> with all the pusillanimity of an assassin.<note><hi rend=italics>Clarendon.

<p>THIS exchange has long since given way to a row of good houses, with an uniform front, engraved in Mr. <hi rend=italics>Nichols's</hi> Progresses of queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth,</hi> which form a part of the street.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Destroyed by Wat Tyler.</NOTE> IN <datestruct value="1381--"><year reg="1381">1381</year></datestruct> it was entirely destroyed by <hi rend=italics>Wat Tyler,</hi> out of spleen to the great owner <hi rend=italics>John</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Gaunt.</hi> He set fire to it in several places. The rebels issued a proclamation, that no <num value="1">one</num> should convert any part of the rich effects to his own use, under pain of death. They actually flung into the fire <num value="1">one</num> of their companions, who had reserved a piece of rich plate. They afterward found certain barrels, which containing, as they thought, gold and silver, they flung them into the flames. The contents <pb id="p.201" n="201"> happened to be gunpowder; which blew up the great hall, and destroyed several houses. Devolving to the crown, <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VII. began to rebuild it, with the design of forming it into an hospital for a <num value="100">hundred</num> distressed people.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Church of St. Mary le Savoy.</placename></NOTE> Here is besides the church of <hi rend=italics>St. Mary le Savoy.</hi> It was originally the chapel to the hospital; but was made parochial on the impious destruction of <hi rend=italics>St. Mary le Strand</hi> by the duke of <hi rend=italics>Somerset.</hi> It is engraven in tab xii. vol. ii. of the <hi rend=italics>Vetusta Monumenta.</hi> The roof is remarkably fine, flat, and covered with elegant small compartments cut in wood; and shields, containing emblems of the passion, surround each, with a neat garland.
<p>AMONG the monuments, in the chancel, that in memory of the wife of Sir <hi rend=italics>Robert Douglas</hi> merits notice. The lady, who died in <datestruct value="1612--"><year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct>, is but a secondary figure, and placed kneeling behind her husband, dressed in a vast distended hood. Before her is her husband, in an easy attitude, reclined, and resting on his right arm; the other hand on his sword. He is represented in armour with a robe over it; on his head a fillet, with a bead round the edge: a motto on his arms, <hi rend=italics>Toujour sans taches.</hi><note>See the inscription in the New View of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> ii. <num value="402">402</num>.

<p>IN a pretty <hi rend=italics>gothic</hi> niche, on the opposite side (occupied probably in old times by the image of <pb id="p.203" n="203"> our lady) is now the figure of a kneeling female, with a countess's coronet on her head.

<p>ANOTHER fine monument of a recumbent lady, in a great ruff and long gown, with her arms cut on it, attracts our notice; but unfortunately the inscription is lost.
<p>BURLEIGH-HOUSE is said to have been a noble <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Burleigh-house.</placename>, or <placename>Exeter-house.</placename></NOTE> pile, built by that great statesman the lord treasurer <hi rend=italics>Burleigh,</hi> who died here in <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>. It was built with brick, and adorned with <num value="4">four</num> square turrets. It was afterwards called <hi rend=italics>Exeter-house,</hi> from the title of his son and successor. On its site was erected <hi rend=italics>Exeter-exchange.</hi> It was a very handsome pile, with an arcade in front, a gallery above, and shops in both. The plan did not succeed; for the New Exchange had the preference, and stole away both tenants and customers. A part of the old house is still to be seen. All originated in sacrilege. On the site stood a house belonging to the parson of <hi rend=italics>St. Martin's:</hi> Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Palmer,</hi> a creature of the duke of <hi rend=italics>Somerset,</hi> obtained it by composition, in the time of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> VI., and began to build there a magnificent house of brick and timber.<note><hi rend=italics>Stow's Survaie,</hi> <num value="835">835</num>.</NOTE> <pb id="p.204" n="204"> This afterward came into the hands of lord <hi rend=italics>Burleigh,</hi> who finished it in the magnificent manner we have mentioned.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Wimbledon-House.</placename></NOTE> A LITTLE farther (where <hi rend=italics>Doyley's</hi> warehouse now stands) was <hi rend=italics>Wimbledon-house,</hi> built by Sir <hi rend=italics>Edward Cecil,</hi> son to the <num value="1">first</num> earl of <hi rend=italics>Exeter,</hi> and created by <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> I. viscount <hi rend=italics>Wimbledon. Stow</hi> in his <hi rend=italics>annales,</hi> p. <datestruct value="1044--"><year reg="1044">1044</year></datestruct>, says that it was burnt quite down on <hi rend=italics>November</hi> <num value="19">19th</num>, <datestruct value="1628--"><year reg="1628">1628</year></datestruct>, and that the day before his Lordship had the misfortune of having part of his house at <hi rend=italics>Wimbledon,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Surry,</hi> blown up by gunpowder. I remember that when I was a boy, I was brought by my mother into a very great glass-shop, a little beyond <hi rend=italics>Wimbledon</hi>- house. The keeper of it was an aged man full of the garrulity often attendant on the advanced period of life. He gave us the following curious anecdote of the lively <hi rend=italics>Nell Gwynne.</hi> &ldquo;When I was an apprentice,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;Mrs. <hi rend=italics>Gwynne</hi> came into our shop, she had not been there long, but a violent noise was heard in the street; on enquiry it was found to proceed from a battle between <hi rend=italics>Nell's</hi> footman, a country lad, and <num value="1">one</num> of the mob, in which the lad got a bloody nose. His mistress asked him what was the cause of the quarrel. Why, my Lady, they called your Ladyship a wh&mdash;re. Poh! Poh! you fool, says <hi rend=italics>Nell,</hi> you should never mind <pb id="p.205" n="205"> that, for many people call me so. That may be, says her champion, but they shall never call me a wh&mdash;re's man.&rdquo;
<p>NOT far from hence stood the <hi rend=italics>Strand Bridge,</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Strand Bridge.</placename></NOTE> which crossed the street, and received the water which ran from the high grounds, through the present <hi rend=italics>Catherine-street,</hi> and delivered it into the <hi rend=italics>Thames.</hi>

<p>ON the south side of the <hi rend=italics>Strand</hi> stood a number <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Other antient Buildings.</NOTE> of buildings, which fell victims to sacrilege, in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> VI. <hi rend=italics>St. Mary le Strand,</hi> was a very antient church and parish, a rectory, in the gift of the bishops of <hi rend=italics>Worcester,</hi> who had near it their inn, or town residence. The bishops of <hi rend=italics>Litchfield</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Coventry</hi> had another, built by <hi rend=italics>Walter de Langton,</hi> elected to that see in <datestruct value="1296--"><year reg="1296">1296</year></datestruct>. It was also called <hi rend=italics>Chester Inn,</hi> as that bishoprick <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Chester Inn.</placename></NOTE> was at the time annexed to the former. The bishops of <hi rend=italics>Landaff</hi> had also another house or inn. Finally, the <hi rend=italics>Strand Inn,</hi> an inn of Chancery, belonging to the <hi rend=italics>Temple.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Dugdale's</hi> Origines Judiciales, <num value="230">230</num>.</NOTE> I must stop a moment to say, that <hi rend=italics>Occleve,</hi> the poet of the reign of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> V. studied the law here: the place of his education is called <hi rend=italics>Chestres Inn;</hi><note>Mr. <hi rend=italics>Thomas Warton.</hi></NOTE> but, as that was never appropriated to the study of the law, I little doubt but it is a mistake for this adjacent house. All of these were levelled to the ground <pb id="p.206" n="206"> <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Somerset-house.</placename></NOTE> by the protector <hi rend=italics>Somerset,</hi> to make way for the magnificent palace which bears his name. The architect is supposed to have been <hi rend=italics>John</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Padua,</hi> who had a salary in the preceding reign, under the title of <hi rend=italics>devizor of his majesty's buildings,</hi><note>Anecdotes of Painting, i. <num value="114">114</num>.</NOTE> which was continued to him in the reign of the son. No atonement was made, no compensation to the owners. Part of the church of <hi rend=italics>St. John of Jerusalem,</hi> and the tower, were blown up for the sake of the materials. The cloisters on the north side of <hi rend=italics>St. Paul's</hi> underwent the same fate, together with the charnel-house and chapel: the tombs were destroyed, and the bones impiously carried away and flung into <hi rend=italics>Finsbury Fields.</hi> This was done in <datestruct value="1549--"><year reg="1549">1549</year></datestruct>, when the building was begun: possibly the founder never enjoyed the use of this palace; for in <datestruct value="1552--"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct> he fell a just victim on the scaffold. The crime of sacrilege is never mentioned among the numerous articles brought against him. This is no wonder, since every great man in those days, protestant and papist, shewed equal rapacity after the goods of the church.
<p>AFTER his death his palace fell to the crown. Queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth</hi> lived here at certain times, most probably at the expence of her kinsman lord <hi rend=italics>Hunsdon,</hi> to whom she had given the use of it. <hi rend=italics>Anne</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Denmark</hi> kept her court here: which was, <pb id="p.207" n="207"> as <hi rend=italics>Wilson</hi> says, &ldquo;a continued <hi rend=italics>Mascarado,</hi> where she and her ladies, like so many sea-nymphs or <hi rend=italics>Nereides,</hi> appeared in various dresses to the ravishment of the beholders!&rdquo; <hi rend=italics>Catherine</hi> queen of <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> II. lived here for some time in the life of her unfaithful spouse; and after his death, till she retired into her native country.
<p>THE architecture of old <hi rend=italics>Somerset-house</hi> was that <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Antient Building.</NOTE> mixture of <hi rend=italics>Grecian</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Gothic,</hi> introduced into <hi rend=italics>England</hi> in the reign preceding its erection. The back-front, and the water-gate, were built from a beautiful design of <hi rend=italics>Inigo Jones,</hi> after the year <datestruct value="1623"><year reg="1623">1623</year></datestruct>. A chapel was begun by him in that year, and afterward finished. It was intended for the use of the <hi rend=italics>Infanta</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Spain,</hi> the designed spouse of <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> I. when prince of <hi rend=italics>Wales;</hi> but, on the failure of that romantic match, it served for the uses of the professors of her religion.
<p>THIS palace was improved and beautified by the queen dowager <hi rend=italics>Henrietta Maria,</hi> in <datestruct value="1662--"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>, when she flattered herself with the hopes of passing the remainder of her days in <hi rend=italics>England.</hi> <num value="2">Two</num> of our most celebrated poets, <hi rend=italics>Cowley</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Waller,</hi> thought proper to offer their incense on her majesty's attention to <hi rend=italics>Somerset-house.</hi> <num value="1">One</num> of <hi rend=italics>Waller's</hi> thoughts is tender and elegant:
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Constant to <hi rend=italics>England</hi> in your love,
<L>As birds are to their wonted grove:
<L>Tho&lsquo; by rude hands their nests are spoil'd,
<L>There, the next spring, again they build.</QUOTE>
<pb id="p.208" n="208">
<p>As <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> II. did not find it compatible with his gallantries that his spouse <hi rend=italics>Catherine</hi> should be resident at <hi rend=italics>Whitehall,</hi> he lodged her, during some part of his reign, in this palace. This made it the haunt of the Catholics; and possibly, during the phrenetic rage of the nation at that period against the professors of her religion, occasioned it to have <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Murder of Sir Edmondbury Godfrey.</NOTE> been made the pretended scene of the murder of Sir <hi rend=italics>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> in the year <datestruct value="1678"><year reg="1678">1678</year></datestruct>. The infamous witnesses against his supposed murderers declared, that he was waylaid, and inveigled into the palace, under pretence of keeping the peace between <num value="2">two</num> servants who were fighting in the yard: that he was there strangled, his neck broken, and his own sword run through his body: that he was kept <num value="4">four</num> days before they ventured to remove him; at length, his corpse was <num value="1">first</num> carried in a sedan-chair to <hi rend=italics>Soho,</hi> and then on a horse to <hi rend=italics>Primrose-hill,</hi> between <hi rend=italics>Kilburn</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Hampstead.</hi> There it certainly was found, transfixed with the sword, and his money in his pocket, and his rings on his fingers. The murder therefore was not by robbers, but the effect of private revenge; yet it is not probable that it was committed within these walls; for the assassins would never have hazarded a discovery by carrying the corpse <num value="3">three</num> miles, when they could have so safely disposed of it in the <hi rend=italics>Thames.</hi> The abandoned character of the witnesses, <hi rend=italics>Prance</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Bedloe</hi> (the <pb id="p.209" n="209"> former of whom had been treated with most horrid cruelties, to compel him to confess what he declared he never was guilty of) together with the absurd and irreconcileable testimony which they gave on the trial, has made unprejudiced times to doubt the whole. That he was murdered is indisputable: he had been an active magistrate, and had made many enemies. The marks of strangling round his throat, and his broken neck, evince the impossibility of his having put an end to his own existence, as some have insinuated. But the innocence of the <num value="3">three</num> poor convicts would not avale, the torrent of prejudice prevaled against them; and they were executed, denying the crime in the moment of death. <num value="1">One</num> was a Protestant: the <num value="2">two</num> others <hi rend=italics>Roman Catholics,</hi> and belonging to the chapel; so probably were fixed upon, by the instigators of the accusation, in order to involve the queen in the uncharitable suspicion. I wish I could exculpate the zealots of that reign, from giving ample cause (in this and other instances) to the <hi rend=italics>Catholics</hi> to recriminate on them the unjust executions of the period of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Mary.</hi>

<p>THIS tragedy became at the time the subject of many medals.<note>See <hi rend=italics>Evelyn's</hi> Medals, <num value="171">171</num>, <num value="172">172</num>, <num value="173">173</num>.</NOTE> On <num value="1">one</num> is the bust of Sir <hi rend=italics>Edmondbury,</hi> and <num value="2">two</num> hands strangling him: on the reverse, the pope giving his benediction to a man <pb id="p.210" n="210"> strangling another on the ground.

<p>The Royal Society, and the Society of Antiquaries, hold their meetings here; and here also are annually exhibited the works of the <hi rend=italics>British</hi> painters and sculptors.

Here was kept the magnificent collection of statues formed by the earl. Howsoever faulty the noble historian may have represented him in some respects, his judgment in the fine arts will remain indisputable.

He was <pb id="p.217" n="217"> seized by the mob, hurried to <hi rend=italics>Cheapside,</hi> where they beheaded him, and carried his corpse before his own palace, and there buried it beneath a heap of sand. The house is said to have been very magnificent. <hi rend=italics>Lacy,</hi> bishop of <hi rend=italics>Exeter</hi> in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VI. added a great hall. The <num value="1">first</num> lord <hi rend=italics>Paget,</hi> a good catholic, made no scruple of laying violent hands on it, in the grand period of plunder.

<p>SINCE the GUARDIAN did not think it beneath him to celebrate some of the <hi rend=italics>capital</hi> artificers of his time, A. D. <datestruct value="1713"><year reg="1713">1713</year></datestruct>, in his <num value="1">first</num>, <num value="43">forty-third</num>, and <num value="64">sixty-fourth</num> numbers, I may venture to mention <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Bat Pidgeon.</NOTE> the great <hi rend=italics>Bat Pidgeon,</hi> who in his advanced age cut my boyish locks in the year <datestruct value="1740"><year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct>. He lived in the corner house of <hi rend=italics>St. Clements Church-yard,</hi> next to the <hi rend=italics>Strand,</hi> and was most eminent in his day, among the very few who at that time practised the art. In <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct> an army might be raised among the professors! In the times I mention, <hi rend=italics>Bat</hi> might have been the only <num value="1">one</num> to whom the family of the <hi rend=italics>Lizards</hi> (N<hi rend=sup>o</hi> <num value="43">43</num>.) and other persons of rank would entrust their heads. Our sex, even the youngest, in general wore wigs, much to the disadvantage of the soft features of the early age: and the ladies confided the important charge of their lovely tresses, then uncontaminated by grease and powders, to their cleanly maids, or the fashionable tiring-woman, a profession long ago lost in our metropolis.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Temple-bar.</placename></NOTE> The <hi rend=italics>Strand</hi> was divided, in <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>, from <hi rend=italics>Fleetstreet,</hi> by the gate called <hi rend=italics>Temple-bar;</hi> before the great fire, by nothing but posts, rails, and chains. On the east side, in the niches, are the statues of <hi rend=italics>James</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Anne</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Denmark,</hi> not without some <pb id="p.219" n="219"> animation, and on the opposite, those of <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> I. and <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> II.; all by <hi rend=italics>John Bushnel,</hi> who died in <datestruct value="1701--"><year reg="1701">1701</year></datestruct>. On this gate has been the sad exhibition of the heads of such unhappy men who have attempted the subversion of the government of their country. The last (and may they be the last!) were of those who fell victims, in <datestruct value="1746--"><year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct>, to principles fortunately extinct with the family from which they originated. This gate is the western limit of <hi rend=italics>Farringdon Ward Without,</hi> or the western extremity of the city of <hi rend=italics>London.</hi>

<p>ON the right hand are the entrances into the <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>The Temple.</placename></NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Temple,</hi> <num value="1">one</num> of our celebrated seats of law, which took its name from that gallant religious military order the <hi rend=italics>knights templars.</hi> They were originally <hi rend=italics>crusaders,</hi> who happening to be quartered in places adjacent to the holy temple in <hi rend=italics>Jerusalem,</hi> in <datestruct value="1118--"><year reg="1118">1118</year></datestruct>, consecrated themselves to the service of religion, by deeds of arms.<note><hi rend=italics>Newcourt's Repertorium,</hi> i. <num value="589">589</num>.</NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Hugo de Paganis, Geoffry</hi> of <hi rend=italics>St. Omers,</hi> and <num value="7">seven</num> others, began the order, by binding themselves, after the manner of the regular canons of <hi rend=italics>St. Augustines,</hi> to chastity and obedience, and professing to protect the pilgrims to the <hi rend=italics>Holy Land</hi> from all wrong and robbery on the road. At <num value="1">first</num> they subsisted on alms, and had only <num value="1">one</num> horse between <num value="2">two</num> of them; a rule was appointed for them, and they wore a white habit, <pb id="p.220" n="220"> afterward distinguished by a red cross on their left shoulder. By their devotion, and the fame of their gallant actions, they became very popular in all parts of <hi rend=italics>Europe;</hi> and were so enriched by the favor of princes, and other great men, that, at the time of their dissolution, the order was found possessed <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Fall of the Knights Templars.</NOTE> of <num value="16000">sixteen thousand</num> manors. They became at last so infected with pride and luxury, as to excite general hatred; and a persecution, founded on most unjust and fictitious accusations, was formed against them in <hi rend=italics>France,</hi> under <hi rend=italics>Philip le Bel.</hi> Their riches seem to have been their chief crime: numbers of innocent and heroic knights suffered in the flames, with the piety and constancy of martyrs; some of them, at the stake, summoned their chief enemies, <hi rend=italics>Clement</hi> V. and <hi rend=italics>Philip,</hi> to appear in a certain time at the divine tribunal; both of those princes died about the time prescribed, which, in an age of superstition, proved the validity of the summons. This potent order came into <hi rend=italics>England</hi> in the reign of king <hi rend=italics>Stephen,</hi> and had their <num value="1">first</num> house in <hi rend=italics>Holborn,</hi> which was called the <hi rend=italics>Old Temple.</hi> They founded the <hi rend=italics>New Temple</hi> in <datestruct value="1185--"><year reg="1185">1185</year></datestruct>, where they continued till the suppression of the order in <datestruct value="1310--"><year reg="1310">1310</year></datestruct>, when they were condemned to perpetual penance, and dispersed into several monasteries. <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> II. granted this house, and all their other possessions in <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> to <hi rend=italics>Thomas</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Lancaster,</hi> and, after his rebellion <pb id="p.221" n="221"> and forfeiture, to <hi rend=italics>Aymer de Valence,</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Pembroke;</hi> on his death, they reverted to the crown, and were given to the knights hospitallers of the order of <hi rend=italics>St. John of Jerusalem,</hi> a few years after they had so valiantly driven the <hi rend=italics>Turks</hi> out of the isle of <hi rend=italics>Rhodes.</hi> These knights again granted the Temple to the students of the common law, in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> III. to whose use it has been ever since applied.
<p>THE church was founded by the templars in the <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Its Round Church.</NOTE> reign of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> II. upon the model of that of the holy sepulchre, and was consecrated in <datestruct value="1185--"><year reg="1185">1185</year></datestruct>, by <hi rend=italics>Heraclius,</hi> patriarch of <hi rend=italics>Jerusalem.</hi> The entrance is through a door with a <hi rend=italics>Norman</hi> arch. Within, the form is circular, supported by <num value="6">six</num> round arches, each resting on <num value="4">four</num> round pillars, bound together by a <hi rend=italics>fascia.</hi> Above each arch is a window with a rounded top, with a gallery, and rich <hi rend=italics>Saxon</hi> arches intersecting each other. On the outside of the pillars is a considerable space, preserving the circular form. On the lower part of the wall are small pilasters meeting in pointed arches at top, and over each pillar a grotesque head. Joined to this building, is a large choir of a square form, with narrow <hi rend=italics>gothic</hi> windows, evidently built at a different time. On the outside is a buttress between every window.
<p>ON the floor of the round church are <num value="2">two</num> groups <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Monuments.</NOTE> of knights. In the <num value="1">first</num> are <num value="4">four</num>, each of them <pb id="p.222" n="222"> cross-legged, <num value="3">three</num> of them in complete mail, in plain helmets flattened at top, and with very long shields. <num value="1">One</num> is known to have been <hi rend=italics>Geoffry de Magnaville,</hi> created earl of <hi rend=italics>Essex</hi> in <datestruct value="1148--"><year reg="1148">1148</year></datestruct>. His end was singular; for, driven to despair by the injustice of his monarch king <hi rend=italics>Stephen,</hi> he gave loose to every act of violence. He was mortally wounded at an attack of <hi rend=italics>Burwel castle,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Cambridgeshire;</hi> and, being found by some templars, was dressed by them in the habit of the order and carried from the spot: as he died excommunicated, they wrapped his body in lead, and hung it on a crooked tree in the Temple orchard. On being absolved by the pope (it being proved that he expressed great penitence in his last moments) he was taken down, and buried <num value="1">first</num> in the cemetery, and afterward in the place where we find this memorial of him.<note>Mr. <hi rend=italics>Gough's</hi> Monum. i. <num value="24">24</num>. tab. v.</NOTE>
<p><num value="1">ONE</num> of these figures is singular, being bareheaded, and bald, his legs armed, his hands mailed, his mantle long, round his neck a cowl, as if, according to a common superstition in early days, he had desired to be buried in the dress of a monk, least the evil spirit should take possession of his body. On his shield are <num value="3">three</num> <hi rend=italics>fleurs de lis.</hi>

<p>IN this group is a stone coffin of a ridged shape, conjectured to have been the tomb of <hi rend=italics>William Plantagenet,</hi> <num value="5">fifth</num> son of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> III. <pb id="p.223" n="223">
<p>IN the <num value="2">second</num> group are other figures, but none of them cross-legged, except the outermost: all are armed in mail. The helmets much resemble the former, but <num value="2">two</num> are mailed. <num value="1">One</num> figure is in a spirited attitude, drawing a broad dagger; <num value="1">one</num> leg rests on the tail of a cockatrice, the other in the action of being drawn up, with the head of the monster beneath. None of the <num value="8">eight</num> figures, except that of <hi rend=italics>Geoffry de Magnaville,</hi> are ascertained; but <hi rend=italics>Camden</hi> conjectures that <num value="3">three</num> are intended to commemorate <hi rend=italics>William</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Pembroke,</hi> who died in <datestruct value="1219--"><year reg="1219">1219</year></datestruct>, and his sons <hi rend=italics>William</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Gilbert,</hi> likewise earls of <hi rend=italics>Pembroke,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Marshals</hi> of <hi rend=italics>England.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Camden,</hi> i. <num value="382">382</num>.&mdash;The others are engraven in plate xix.</NOTE> In the <num value="1">first</num> group, <num value="1">one</num> of the figures bears a lion on his shield, the arms of that great family. <hi rend=italics>Gilbert</hi> was brought up to the church, and, notwithstanding he was totally unskilled in exercises of chivalry, would enter into the gallant lists; but mounting a fiery courser, was run away with, flung, and killed, at a tournament at <hi rend=italics>Ware,</hi> in <datestruct value="1242--"><year reg="1242">1242</year></datestruct>.
<p>THE being represented cross-legged is not always a proof of the deceased having had the merit either of having been a <hi rend=italics>crusader,</hi> or having made a pilgrimage to the holy sepulchre. I have seen, at <hi rend=italics>Mitton</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Yorkshire,</hi> <num value="2">two</num> figures of the <hi rend=italics>Sherbornes,</hi> thus represented: <num value="1">one</num> died in <datestruct value="1629--"><year reg="1629">1629</year></datestruct>, the other in <datestruct value="1689--"><year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct>: who, I verily believe, could never <pb id="p.224" n="224"> have had any more than a wish to enter the holy land.
<p>To these antient monuments may be added that of a bishop, in his episcopal dress, a mitre, and a crosier, well executed in stone.
<p>OF illustrious persons of later date, is the famous <hi rend=italics>Plowden,</hi> a <hi rend=italics>Shropshire</hi> man, treasurer of this society in <datestruct value="1572--"><year reg="1572">1572</year></datestruct>, and a lawyer of most distinguished abilities. <hi rend=italics>Camden</hi> says of him, that in integrity he was <num value="2">second</num> to none of his profession. His figure is represented recumbent, and in his gown.
<p>HERE is interred the celebrated <hi rend=italics>Selden,</hi> who died in <datestruct value="1654--"><year reg="1654">1654</year></datestruct>. He was the best skilled in the constitution, and the various branches of antiquity, of any man. Yet, towards the close of his life, he was so thoroughly convinced of the vanity of all human knowledge, as to say, that the <num value="11">11th</num>, <num value="12">12th</num>, <num value="13">13th</num>, and <num value="14">14th</num> verses of the <num value="2">second</num> chapter of the epistle to <hi rend=italics>Titus,</hi> afforded him more solid consolation than all that he had ever read.
<p>SIR <hi rend=italics>John Vaughan,</hi> born at <hi rend=italics>Trawscoed,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Cardiganshire,</hi> lies near his friend Mr. <hi rend=italics>Selden:</hi> the principles of both were anti-monarchical. After the Restoration, the former declined preferment offered by the chancellor <hi rend=italics>Clarendon,</hi> but afterward accepted the office of chief justice of the common-pleas, from the enemies of that illustrious character. He died in <datestruct value="1674--"><year reg="1674">1674</year></datestruct>. <pb id="p.225" n="225">

<p>THE account of the great feast given in the hall of the <hi rend=italics>Inner Temple,</hi> by the serjeants, in <datestruct value="1555--"><year reg="1555">1555</year></datestruct>, is extremely worth consulting;<note><hi rend=italics>Origines Judiciales,</hi> <num value="128">128</num>.</NOTE> and also of the hospitable Christmassings of old times. <hi rend=italics>Dudley</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Leicester</hi> once enjoyed them, and, with the romance of his mistress, styled himself <hi rend=italics>Palaphilos,</hi>
<pb id="p.226" n="226"> prince of <hi rend=italics>Sophie.</hi> He was entertained here by a person representing a sovereign prince. <hi rend=italics>Palaphilos,</hi> on seeing him, calls <hi rend=italics>Largess,</hi> and receives instantly a chain of the value of a <num value="100">hundred</num> talents.

<p>THE <hi rend=italics>Middle Temple</hi> gate was erected by Sir <hi rend=italics>Amias Powlet,</hi> on a singular occasion.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>The Temple Garden.</NOTE> THE garden has of late been most judiciously enlarged, by a considerable embankment extending into the river; and part of the filthy muddy shore is converted into a most beautiful walk.

If elegance alone were to be consulted, it is heartily to be wished that these embankments may make a farther progress; the want of which, alone, gives to the <hi rend=italics>Seine,</hi> at <hi rend=italics>Paris,</hi> a boasted superiority.

<p>Adjacent to <hi rend=italics>Chancery-lane,</hi> the bishops of <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Chichester-rents.</placename></NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Chichester</hi> had their town-house.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Lincoln's-Inn.</placename></NOTE> THE gate to <hi rend=italics>Lincoln's-Inn</hi> is of brick, but no small ornament to the street. It was built by Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Lovel,</hi> once a member of this inn, and afterward treasurer of the houshold to <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VII. The other parts were rebuilt at different times, but much about the same period. None of the original building is left, for it was formed out of the house of the <hi rend=italics>Black Friars,</hi> which fronted <hi rend=italics>Holborn;</hi> and out of the palace of <hi rend=italics>Ralph Nevil,</hi> chancellor of <hi rend=italics>England,</hi> and bishop of <hi rend=italics>Chichester,</hi> built by him in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> III. on a piece of ground granted to him by the king. It continued to be inhabited by some of his successors in the see. This was the original site of the <hi rend=italics>Dominicans,</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Black Friars,</hi> before they removed to the spot now known by that name. On part of the ground, now covered with buildings, <hi rend=italics>Henry Lacy,</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Lincoln,</hi> built an <hi rend=italics>Inne,</hi> as it was in those days called, for himself, in which he died in <datestruct value="1312--"><year reg="1312">1312</year></datestruct>. The ground belonged to the <hi rend=italics>Black Friars,</hi> and was granted by <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> I. to that great earl.

<p>THE chapel was designed by <hi rend=italics>Inigo Jones;</hi> it is <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Chapel.</NOTE> built upon massy pillars, and affords, under its shelter, an excellent walk. This work evinces that <hi rend=italics>Inigo</hi> never was designed for a <hi rend=italics>gothic</hi> architect. The lord chancellor holds his sittings in the great hall. This, like that of the Temple, had its revels, and great <hi rend=italics>Christmasses.</hi> Instead of the <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Antient Revels.</NOTE> Lord of <hi rend=italics>Misrule,</hi> it had formerly its <hi rend=italics>King of the Cocknies.</hi> It had also a <hi rend=italics>Jack Straw;</hi> but in the time of queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth</hi> he, and all his adherents, were utterly banished. I must not omit, that in the same reign sumptuary laws were made to regulate the dress of the members of the house; who were forbidden to wear long hair, or great ruffs, cloaks, boots, or spurs. In the reign of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Regulations about Beards.</NOTE> beards were prohibited at the great table, under pain of paying double commons. His daughter <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth,</hi> in the <num value="1">first</num> year of her reign, confined them to a fortnight's growth, under penalty of <num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>; but the fashion prevaled so strongly, that the prohibition was repealed, and no manner of size limited to that venerable excrescence!
<p><rs>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</rs> would have been <num value="1">one</num> <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields.</placename></NOTE> of our most beautiful squares, had it been built on <pb id="p.236" n="236"> a regular plan.

In the commission it is alleged, &ldquo;That more public works, near and about the city of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> had been undertaken in the <num value="16">sixteen</num> years of that reign, than in ages heretofore: and that the grounds called <hi rend=italics>Lincolnes-Inn-Fields</hi> were much planted round with dwellings and lodgings of noblemen and gentlemen of qualitie: but at the same time it was deformed by cottages and mean buildings, incroachments on the fields, and nusances to the neighborhood.

The view of this side of the square, and of <hi rend=italics>Lincoln's-Inn</hi>-gardens, is very pleasing, particularly when the latter are illuminated by the western sun. Here also was, in the time of king <hi rend=italics>William,</hi> a play-house erected within the walls of the tennis-court, under the royal patronage. In this theatre <hi rend=italics>Betterton,</hi> and his troop of actors, excited the admiration of the public, if we may credit <hi rend=italics>Cibber,</hi> as much as <hi rend=italics>Roscius</hi> did that of the people of <hi rend=italics>Rome,</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Garrick</hi> of those of <hi rend=italics>England</hi> in recent days.
<p>ON another stage, of a different nature, was <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Execution of Lord Russel.</NOTE> performed the sad tragedy of the death of the virtuous lord <hi rend=italics>Russel,</hi> who lost his head in the middle of the square, on <hi rend=italics>July</hi> <num value="21">21st</num>, <datestruct value="1683--"><year reg="1683">1683</year></datestruct>.

<p>IN antient times it was customary to present to malefactors, on their way to the gallows (which, about the year <datestruct value="1413"><year reg="1413">1413</year></datestruct>, was removed from <hi rend=italics>Smithfield,</hi> and placed between <hi rend=italics>St. Giles's High-street,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Hog-lane</hi>) a great bowl of ale, as the last refreshment they were to receive in this life.<note><hi rend=italics>Newcourt,</hi> i. <num value="611">611</num>.</NOTE> Such a custom prevaled at <hi rend=italics>York,</hi> which gave rise to the saying, that the sadler of <hi rend=italics>Bawtry</hi> was hanged for <hi rend=italics>leaving his liquor.</hi> Had he stopt, as usual, his reprieve, which was actually on the road, would have arrived time enough to have saved him. <pb id="p.240" n="240">
<p>HERE was executed, in the most barbarous manner, the famous Sir <hi rend=italics>John Oldcastle,</hi> baron <hi rend=italics>Cobham.</hi> His crime was that of adopting the tenets of <hi rend=italics>Wycliffe.</hi> He was misrepresented to our heroic prince <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> V. by the bigoted clergy, as a heretic and traitor; and to have been actually at the head of <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> <hi rend=italics>Lollards,</hi> in these very fields. About a <num value="100">hundred</num> inoffensive people were found there: <hi rend=italics>Cobham</hi> escaped; but was taken some time after in <hi rend=italics>Wales.</hi> He suffered death on this spot: was hung on a gallows, by a chain fastened round his body, and, thus suspended, burnt alive. He died, not with the calm constancy of a martyr, but with the wildest effusions of enthusiastic ravings.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Church.</NOTE> THIS church was rebuilt in <datestruct value="1625--"><year reg="1625">1625</year></datestruct>. Owing to the ground around it being raised by filth and other adventitious matter; the floor was <num value="8">eight</num> feet below the level which it had acquired in the year <datestruct value="1730"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>. This alone made it necessary to rebuild the church in the present century. The <num value="1">first</num> stone was laid in <datestruct value="1730--"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>; it was finished in <datestruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></datestruct>, at the expence of <measure value="10000l." type=currency><num value="10000">ten thousand</num> pounds</measure>, in a manner which does great credit to its architect, Mr. <hi rend=italics>Henry Flitcraft.</hi>

<p>IN this church was interred the famous lord <hi rend=italics>Herbert,</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Cherbury,</hi> who died in <datestruct value="1648--"><year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct>.

<p>IN the church-yard I have observed with horror <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Churchyard.</NOTE> a great square pit, with many rows of coffins piled <num value="1">one</num> upon the other, all exposed to sight and smell. Some of the piles were incomplete, expecting the mortality of the night. I turned away disgusted at the view, and scandalized at the want of police, which so little regards the health of the living as to permit so many putrid corpses, tacked between some slight boards, to disperse their dangerous <hi rend=italics>effluvia</hi> over the capital. Notwithstanding a compliment paid to me in <num value="1">one</num> of the public papers, for having occasioned the abolition of the horrible practice, it still remains uncorrected in this great parish. The reform ought to have begun in the place <num value="1">first</num> stigmatized!
<p>NEAR this church was the house of <hi rend=italics>Alice</hi> dutchess <hi rend=italics>Dudley,</hi> who died here in <datestruct value="1669--"><year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="90">ninety</num>. She was the widow of the great Sir <hi rend=italics>Robert Dudley,</hi> son to <hi rend=italics>Robert</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Leicester,</hi> who, by various untoward circumstances, was denied legitimacy, and his paternal estates. He was created a duke of the empire, had assumed the title of duke of <hi rend=italics>Northumberland,</hi> and lived and died in great estimation in <hi rend=italics>Tuscany.</hi> This lady was <pb id="p.242" n="242"> advanced to the title of dutchess by <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> I. but without any entail. She merited the honor by the greatness of her mind and extent of her charities. Her body was interred at <hi rend=italics>Stonely,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Warwickshire,</hi> the place of her family, she being the <num value="3">third</num> daughter of Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Leigh,</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Stonely,</hi> ancestor of the late lord <hi rend=italics>Leigh.</hi> A fine monument was erected to her honor at <hi rend=italics>Stonely,</hi><note>See <hi rend=italics>Dugdale's Warwickshire,</hi> i. <num value="260">260</num>; in which is a print of the tomb, and a list of her great charities.</NOTE> and there is a grateful memorial of her in this church.
<p>THE mention of <hi rend=italics>St. Giles's bowl,</hi> naturally leads to that of the late place of the conclusion of human laws.

<p>I SHALL return through the mile and a quarter <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Oxford-street.</placename></NOTE> of country, at this time formed into <hi rend=italics>Oxford-street,</hi> as handsome a <num value="1">one</num> as any in <hi rend=italics>Europe,</hi> and, I believe, the longest.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Montague-house.</placename></NOTE> MONTAGUE-HOUSE (now the <hi rend=italics>British Museum</hi>) was built on a <hi rend=italics>French</hi> plan, by the <num value="1">first</num> duke of <hi rend=italics>Montague,</hi> who had been ambassador in <hi rend=italics>France.</hi> The staircase and ceilings were painted by <hi rend=italics>Rousseau</hi> and <hi rend=italics>La Fosse:</hi> the apotheosis of <hi rend=italics>Iris,</hi> and the assembly of the gods, are by the latter.

<p>I MUST mention, that to the east of <hi rend=italics>Bloomsburysquare,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Great Ormond-street,</hi> stood in my memory <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Powis-house.</placename></NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Powis-house,</hi> originally built by the marquis of <hi rend=italics>Powis,</hi> in the last century.

<p>BEDFORD-ROW, in this neighborhood, took its <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Bedford-row.</placename></NOTE> name from the uses to which those lands, and others adjacent, were bequeathed by Sir <hi rend=italics>William Harpur,</hi> son of <hi rend=italics>William Harpur,</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Bedford;</hi> viz. to found a free and perpetual school, in that his native place; for portioning poor maidens; for supporting poor children; and for maintaining the poor with the surplus; all of them inhabitants of the said town. Part of the lands were of his own inheritance; part belonging to the <hi rend=italics>Chartreux,</hi> at that time lately dissolved. Some of the lands were lost, others granted to Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Fisher,</hi> baronet, for other lands belonging to him; the remainder granted, in the year <datestruct value="1668"><year reg="1668">1668</year></datestruct>, upon lease, <pb id="p.246" n="246"> by the corporation of <hi rend=italics>Bedford,</hi> trustees to the charity, for the purposes of building, for the term of <num value="41">forty-one</num> years, at the yearly rent of ninetynine pounds: and in <datestruct value="1684--"><year reg="1684">1684</year></datestruct>, the reversion to <hi rend=italics>Nicholas Barbon,</hi> D.

A suit arose, about the year <datestruct value="1725"><year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct>, between the warden and fellows of <hi rend=italics>New College,</hi> and the corporation of <hi rend=italics>Bedford,</hi> concerning the right of appointing the masters to the school, and their salaries. The same was decided, in <datestruct value="1725--"><year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct>, in favor of the college; the corporation was to pay the head-master <measure value="30l." type=currency><num value="30">thirty</num> pounds</measure> a year, and the usher <num value="20">twenty</num>; and the other charities to be paid proportionably to the revenues of the estate.
<p>ON the expiration of the <num value="2">two</num> leases, in <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>, the annual revenues arising from the rents amounted to <num value="2336">2,336</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="17">17</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> and the houses at will to <num value="273">273</num><hi rend=italics>l.;</hi> and it was found that improvements might be made which would increase the revenue so far as to make the whole amount to <num value="3000">3,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> a year.

<p>AMONG other regulations, in consequence of <pb id="p.247" n="247"> the increased revenue, by an act made about the year <datestruct value="1762"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>, new houses were directed to be built for the schoolmaster, usher, and writing-master.

<p>NOT far from <hi rend=italics>Holborn,</hi> is the church of <hi rend=italics>St.</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>St. George's Bloomsbury.</placename></NOTE> <hi rend=italics>George,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Bloomsbury,</hi> which, with its magnificent porch supported by pillars of the <hi rend=italics>Corinthian</hi> order, placed before a plain body, and its wondrous steeple, I cannot stigmatize more strongly than in the words of Mr. <hi rend=italics>Walpole,</hi> who styles it, a masterpiece of absurdity. On the tower is a pyramid, at each corner of which are the supporters of <hi rend=italics>England,</hi> a lion and an unicorn alternate, the <num value="1">first</num> with its heels upwards: the pyramid finishes with the statue of <hi rend=italics>George</hi> I.

<p>WE now enter again on the stormy latitude of <pb id="p.248" n="248"> the law. <hi rend=italics>Lincoln's-Inn</hi> is left a little to the south. <hi rend=italics>Chancery-lane</hi> gapes on the same side, to receive the numberless <hi rend=italics>malheureux,</hi> who plunge unwarily on the rocks and shelves with which it abounds. <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Gray's-inn.</placename></NOTE> The antient seminary of the law, <hi rend=italics>Gray's-Inn,</hi> stands on the north side.

<p>JOHN GERARD, the most celebrated of our antient botanists, had his garden in <hi rend=italics>Holborn.</hi> The <num value="1">first</num> of his publications was the catalogue of the plants he had growing in his own garden. It was published by <hi rend=italics>J.

The garden contained <pb id="p.253" n="253"> nearly <num value="1100">eleven hundred</num> species, and seems to have been the <num value="1">first</num> of the kind in our island. <hi rend=italics>Gerard</hi> was patronised by several of the <num value="1">first</num> characters of the time: during <num value="20">twenty</num> years he superintended the garden of the great statesman lord <hi rend=italics>Burleigh;</hi> on his death, he found in Sir <hi rend=italics>Walter Raleigh</hi> another patron: and the same in lord <hi rend=italics>Edward Zouch,</hi> and lord <hi rend=italics>Hunsdon,</hi> lord high treasurer of <hi rend=italics>England.</hi> All those noblemen were much smitten with the useful and agreeable study of botany.<note>Doctor <hi rend=italics>Pulteney's</hi> Progress of Botany, &amp;c. i. <num value="126">126</num>.</NOTE>
<p>HATTON-STREET, the late <hi rend=italics>Hatton-garden,</hi> succeeded <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Hatton-Garden.</placename></NOTE> to the town-house and gardens of the lord <hi rend=italics>Hattons,</hi> founded by Sir <hi rend=italics>Christopher Hatton,</hi> lord keeper in the reign of queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth.</hi> He <num value="1">first</num> attracted the royal notice by his fine person, and fine dancing; but his intellectual accomplishments were far from superficial. He discharged his great office with applause; but, distrusting his legal abilities, never acted without the assistance of <num value="2">two</num> able lawyers. The place he built his house upon, was the orchard and garden belonging to <hi rend=italics>Ely-house.</hi> Here Sir <hi rend=italics>Christopher</hi> died in <datestruct value="1591--"><year reg="1591">1591</year></datestruct>, and was interred in the cathedral of <hi rend=italics>St. Paul's.</hi> By his interest with the queen he extorted the ground from the bishop, <hi rend=italics>Richard Cox,</hi> who for a long time resisted the sacrilege. Her letter to <pb id="p.254" n="254"> the poor bishop was dictated in terms as insolent as indecent.
<p>&ldquo;Proud Prelate!
<p>You know what you was before I made you what you are now; if you do not immediately comply with my request, by G&mdash;d, I will unfrock you.

<p>THIS palace was long before distinguished by the death of a much greater man; for, at this house of the bishop of <hi rend=italics>Ely,</hi> say historians, <hi rend=italics>John</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>Lancaster,</hi> otherwise <hi rend=italics>John of Gaunt,</hi> breathed his last, in <datestruct value="1399--"><year reg="1399">1399</year></datestruct>, after (according to <hi rend=italics>Shakespeare</hi>) giving his dying fruitless admonition to his dissipated nephew <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> II. It was possibly lent to him, during the long possession that bishop <hi rend=italics>Fordham</hi> had of the see, after the duke's own palace, the <hi rend=italics>Savoy,</hi> was burnt by the insurgents.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Ely-House.</placename></NOTE> ADJACENT stood, in my memory, <hi rend=italics>Ely-house,</hi> the residence of the bishops of <hi rend=italics>Ely. John de Kirkby,</hi> who died bishop of <hi rend=italics>Ely,</hi> in <datestruct value="1290--"><year reg="1290">1290</year></datestruct>, laid the foundation of this palace, by bequeathing several messuages in this place; others were purchased by his successor <hi rend=italics>William de Luda;</hi> at length the whole, consisting of <num value="20">twenty</num>, some say of <num value="40">forty</num> acres, was inclosed within a wall. <hi rend=italics>Holinshed</hi> has recorded the excellency of the strawberries <pb id="p.255" n="255"> cultivated in the garden by bishop <hi rend=italics>Morton.</hi> He informs us that <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>Glocester</hi>
(afterward <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> III.) at the council held in the <hi rend=italics>Tower,</hi> on the morning he put <hi rend=italics>Hastings</hi> to death, requested a dish of them from the bishop. Mr. <hi rend=italics>Grose</hi> has given us <num value="2">two</num> representations of the buildings and chapel. Here was a most venerable hall, <num value="74">seventy-four</num> feet long, lighted with <num value="6">six</num> <hi rend=italics>gothic</hi> windows; and all the furniture suited the hospitality of the times: this room the serjeants at law frequently borrowed to hold their feasts in, on account of its size.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Chapel.</NOTE> THE chapel (which was dedicated to <hi rend=italics>St. Etheldreda,</hi> foundress of the monastery at <hi rend=italics>Ely</hi>) has at the east end a very handsome <hi rend=italics>gothic</hi> window, which looks into a neat court, lately built, called <hi rend=italics>Ely-place.</hi> Beneath is a crypt of the length of the chapel. The cloisters formed a square on the south side.
<p>THE several buildings belonging to this palace falling into ruin, it was thought proper to enable, by act of parlement, in <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, the bishop to alienate the whole. It was accordingly sold to the <pb id="p.257" n="257"> crown, for the sum of <measure value="6500l." type=currency><num value="6500">six thousand five hundred</num> pounds</measure>, together with an annuity of <measure value="200l." type=currency><num value="200">two hundred</num> pounds</measure> a year, to be payed to the bishop and his successors for ever. Out of the <num value="1">first</num>, <num value="5600">five thousand six hundred</num> was applied towards the purchase of <hi rend=italics>Albemarle-house,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Dover-street,</hi> with other messuages and gardens. The remainder, together with <measure value="3000l." type=currency><num value="3000">three thousand</num> pounds</measure> paid as dilapidations by the executors of bishop <hi rend=italics>Mawson,</hi> was applied towards building the handsome house at present occupied, in <hi rend=italics>Dover-street,</hi> by my respected friend the present prelate.<note>The honorable <hi rend=italics>James Yorke.</hi> ED.</NOTE> This was named <hi rend=italics>Ely-house,</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Ely-House</placename>, in Dover-street.</NOTE> and is settled on the bishops of <hi rend=italics>Ely</hi> for ever. It was the fortune of that munificent prelate <hi rend=italics>Edmund Keene,</hi> to rebuild or repair more ecclesiastical houses than any churchman of modern days. He bestowed most considerable repairs on the parsonage house of <hi rend=italics>Stanhope,</hi> in the bishoprick of <hi rend=italics>Durham.</hi> He wholly rebuilt the palace at <hi rend=italics>Chester.</hi> He restored almost from ruin that at <hi rend=italics>Ely;</hi> and, finally, <hi rend=italics>Ely-house,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Dover-street,</hi> was built under his inspection.
<p>FROM hence is a steep descent down <hi rend=italics>Holborn-hill.</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>St. Andrew's Holborn.</placename></NOTE> On the south side is <hi rend=italics>St. Andrew's</hi> church, of considerable antiquity, but rebuilt in the last century in a plain neat manner. Here was buried <hi rend=italics>Thomas Wriothesley,</hi> lord chancellor in the latter <pb id="p.258" n="258"> part of the life of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII.; a fiery zealot, who, not content with seeing the amiable innocent <hi rend=italics>Anne Askew</hi> put to the torture, for no other crime than difference of faith, flung off his gown, degraded the chancellor into the <hi rend=italics>Bourreau,</hi> and with his own hands gave force to the rack.<note><hi rend=italics>Ballard's</hi> lives of <hi rend=italics>British</hi> ladies, <num value="52">52</num>.</NOTE> He was created earl of <hi rend=italics>Southampton,</hi> just before the coronation of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> VI.; but, obstinately adhering to the old religion, he was dismissed from his post, and confined to <hi rend=italics>Southampton-house,</hi> where he died in <datestruct value="1550--"><year reg="1550">1550</year></datestruct>.
<p>THE well-known party tool Doctor <hi rend=italics>Sacheverel</hi> was rector of this church. He had the chance of meeting in his parish a person as turbulent as himself, the noted Mr. <hi rend=italics>Whiston:</hi> that singular character took it into his head to disturb the doctor while he was in his pulpit venting some doctrine contrary to the opinion of that heterodox man. The doctor in great wrath descended from on high, and fairly turned <hi rend=italics>wicked Will. Whiston</hi> out of church. Before I quit this long street, let me add, that <hi rend=italics>Holeburne</hi> was, at the time of forming the <hi rend=italics>Domesday-book,</hi> a manor belonging to the king.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Cock-Lane Ghost.</NOTE> IN ascending to <hi rend=italics>West Smithfield, Cock-lane</hi> is left to the right; a ridiculous scene of imposture, in the affair of the <hi rend=italics>Cock-lane</hi> ghost, which was to <pb id="p.259" n="259"> detect the murderer of the body it lately inhabited, by its appearance in the vault of <hi rend=italics>St. John's</hi> church, <hi rend=italics>Clerkenwell.</hi> The credulity of the <hi rend=italics>English</hi> nation was most fully displayed, by the great concourse of people of all ranks, to hear the conversation held by <num value="1">one</num> of the cheats with the ghost. It ended in full detection and exemplary punishment of the several persons concerned in the villainy.
<p><hi rend=italics>SMITHFIELD</hi> is celebrated on several accounts: <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Smithfield.</placename></NOTE> at present, and long since, for being the great market for cattle of all kinds. For being the place where <hi rend=italics>Bartholomew-fair</hi> was kept; which <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Bartholomew-Fair.</placename></NOTE> was granted, during <num value="3">three</num> days annually, by <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> II. to the neighboring priory. It was long a season of great festivity; theatrical performances by the better actors were exhibited here, and it was frequented by a great deal of good company; but, becoming the resort of the debauched of all denominations, certain regulations took place, which in later days have spoiled the mirth, but produced the desired decency. The humours of this place will never be lost, as long as the inimitable print of <hi rend=italics>Bartholomew-fair,</hi><note>Or rather <hi rend=italics>Southwark Fair:</hi> but the same humours might be found in both.</NOTE> of our <hi rend=italics>Hogarth,</hi> shall exist.
<p>FOR a long series of reigns, <hi rend=italics>Smithfield</hi> was the <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Place For Tournaments;</NOTE> field of gallant tilts and tournaments: and also the spot on which accusations were decided by duel, derived from the <hi rend=italics>Kamp-fight</hi> ordeal of the <pb id="p.260" n="260"> <hi rend=italics>Saxons.</hi> Here, in <datestruct value="1374--"><year reg="1374">1374</year></datestruct>, the doating hero <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> III. in his <num value="62">sixty-second</num> year, infatuated by the charms of <hi rend=italics>Alice Pierce,</hi> placed her by his side in a magnificent car, and, styling her the <hi rend=italics>Lady of the Sun,</hi> conducted her to the lists, followed by a train of knights, each leading by the bridle a beautiful palfrey, mounted by a gay damsel: and for <num value="7">seven</num> days together exhibited the most splendid justs in indulgence of his disgraceful passion.
<p>HIS grandson, <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> II. in the same place held a tournament equally magnificent. &ldquo;There issued out of the <hi rend=italics>Towre</hi> of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi>&rdquo; says the admiring <hi rend=italics>Froissart,</hi> &ldquo;fyrst threescore coursers apparelled for the justes, and on every <num value="1">one</num> a squyer of honour riding a soft pase. Than issued out threescore ladyes of honoure mounted on fayre palfreyes, and every lady led a knight by a cheyne of silver, which knights were apparelled to just.&rdquo; I refer to my author<note><hi rend=italics>Froissart,</hi> tom. iv. ch. xxii. Lord <hi rend=italics>Berner's</hi> translation, ii. p. ccix.</NOTE> for the rest of the relation of this splendid spectacle; certainly there was a magnificence and spirit of gallantry in the dissipation of those early times, which cherished a warlike and generous spirit in the nobility and gentry of the land. Something like is now arising, in the brilliant societies of archers in most parts of <hi rend=italics>Britain,</hi> which, it is to be hoped, will at lest share the hours consumed in <pb id="p.261" n="261"> the enervated pleasures of music; or the dangerous waste of time in the hours dedicated to cards.
<p>THE only duel I shall mention is that in which <NOTE PLACE=MARG>For Trials by Duel.</NOTE> the unfortunate Armourer entered into the lists, on account of a false accusation of treason, brought against him by his apprentice, in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VI. The friends of the defendant had so plied him with liquor, that he fell an easy conquest to his accuser. <hi rend=italics>Shakespeare</hi> has worked this piece of history into a scene, in the <num value="2">second</num> part of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VI. but has made the poor Armourer confess his treasons in his dying moments: for in the time in which this custom prevaled, it never was even suspected but that guilt must have been the portion of the vanquished. Let me add, that when people of rank fought with sword and lance, <hi rend=italics>Plebeian</hi> combatants were only allowed a pole, armed with a heavy sand-bag, with which they were to decide their guilt or innocence.
<p>IN <hi rend=italics>Smithfield</hi> were also held our <hi rend=italics>Autos de F&egrave;;</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG>For Executions.</NOTE> but, to the credit of our <hi rend=italics>English</hi> monarchs, none were ever known to attend the ceremony. Even <hi rend=italics>Philip</hi> II. of <hi rend=italics>Spain</hi> never honored any, of the many which were celebrated by permission of his gentle queen, with his presence, notwithstanding he could behold the roasting of his own subjects with infinite self-applause, and <hi rend=italics>sang-froid.</hi> A stone marks the spot, in this area, on which those cruel exhibitions were executed. Here our martyr <hi rend=italics>Latimer</hi>
<pb id="p.262" n="262"> preached patience to friar <hi rend=italics>Forest,</hi> agonizing under the torture of a slow fire, for denying the king's supremacy: and to this place our martyr <hi rend=italics>Cranmer</hi> compelled the amiable <hi rend=italics>Edward,</hi> by forcing his reluctant hand to the warrant, to send <hi rend=italics>Joan Bocher,</hi> a silly woman, to the stake. Yet <hi rend=italics>Latimer</hi> never thought of his own conduct in his last moments; nor did <hi rend=italics>Cranmer</hi> thrust his hand into the fire for a real crime, but for <num value="1">one</num> which was venial through the frailty of human nature.
<p>OUR gracious <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth</hi> could likewise burn people for religion. <num value="2">Two</num> <hi rend=italics>Dutchmen,</hi> anabaptists, suffered in this place in <datestruct value="1575--"><year reg="1575">1575</year></datestruct>, and died, as <hi rend=italics>Holinshed</hi> sagely remarks, with &ldquo;roring and crieing.&rdquo;<note>P. <datestruct value="1261--"><year reg="1261">1261</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> But let me say, that this was the only instance we have of her exerting the blessed prerogative of the writ <hi rend=italics>de H&aelig;retico comburendo.</hi> Her highness preferred the halter: her sullen sister, faggot and fire. Not that we will deny but <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth</hi> made a very free use of the terrible act of her <num value="27">27th</num> year: a <num value="168">hundred and sixty-eight</num> suffered in her reign, at <hi rend=italics>London, York,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Lancashire,</hi> and several other parts of the kingdom, convicted of being priests, of harbouring priests, or of becoming converts.<note><hi rend=italics>Dod's</hi> Church History, ii. <num value="321">321</num>.</NOTE> But still there is a balance of a <num value="19">hundred and nine</num> against us in the article persecution, and that, by the agonizing death of fire: for the smallest number <pb id="p.263" n="263"> estimated to have suffered under the savage <hi rend=italics>Mary,</hi> amounts, in her short reign, to <num value="277">two hundred and seventy-seven</num>.<note><hi rend=italics>Heylin,</hi> and other historians.</NOTE>
<p>THE last person who suffered at the stake in <hi rend=italics>England</hi> was <hi rend=italics>Bartholomew Legatt,</hi> who was burnt here in <datestruct value="1611--"><year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct>, as a blasphemous heretic, according to the sentence pronounced by <hi rend=italics>John King,</hi> bishop of <hi rend=italics>London.</hi> The bishop consigned him to the secular arm of our monarch <hi rend=italics>James,</hi> who took care to give to the sentence full effect.<note>See part iv. of the history of the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="14">fourteen</num> years of king <hi rend=italics>James.</hi></NOTE>&mdash;This place, as well as <hi rend=italics>Tyburn,</hi> was called <hi rend=italics>The Elms,</hi> and used for the execution of malefactors even before the year <datestruct value="1219"><year reg="1219">1219</year></datestruct>.&mdash;In the year <datestruct value="1530"><year reg="1530">1530</year></datestruct>, there was a most severe and singular punishment inflicted here on <num value="1">one</num> <hi rend=italics>John Roose,</hi> a cook, who had poisoned <num value="17">seventeen</num> persons of the bishop of <hi rend=italics>Rochester's</hi> family, <num value="2">two</num> of whom died, and the rest never recovered their health. His design was against the pious prelate <hi rend=italics>Fisher,</hi> who at that time resided at <hi rend=italics>Rochester</hi>-place, at <hi rend=italics>Lambeth.</hi> The villain was acquainted with the cook, and, coming into the bishop's kitchen, took an opportunity, while the cook's back was turned to fetch him some drink, to fling a great quantity of poison into the gruel which was prepared for dinner for the bishop's family and the poor of the parish. The good <pb id="p.264" n="264"> bishop escaped. Fortunately, he that day had abstained from food. The humility and temperance of that good man is strongly marked in this relation, for he partook of the same ordinary food with the most wretched pauper.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Of William Pennant.</NOTE> I CANNOT help indulging myself with the mention of <hi rend=italics>William Pennant,</hi> an honest goldsmith, my great great great great great great uncle, who, at his house, the <hi rend=italics>Queen's-head</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Smithfield,</hi> acquired a considerable fortune towards the latter end of the reign of <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth,</hi> and the beginning of that of <hi rend=italics>James</hi> I. It appears by his will, dated <hi rend=italics>May</hi>
<num value="4">4th</num>, <datestruct value="1607--"><year reg="1607">1607</year></datestruct>, that he was employed by the court, for numbers of his legacies were to the royal servants. His legacy to Sir <hi rend=italics>William Fortescue,</hi> knight, his <pb id="p.265" n="265"> wife's brother, has now a singular appearance:&mdash; <num value="1">one</num> chain of gold and pearle, weighing about <num value="12">12</num> ounces and a quarter; <num value="1">one</num> billament of gold and pearl, being <num value="19">19</num> pieces; a round salt of silver and a cover thereto, weighing <num value="15">15</num> ounces and somewhat more; <num value="6">six</num> white silver spoons; <num value="1">one</num> feather bed, bolster, <num value="2">two</num> pillows, <num value="2">two</num> blankets, <num value="1">one</num> blue rug; a testearn of satten, figured russet and black, and vallance to the same; <num value="5">5</num> curtains of taffety sarcenet; <num value="1">one</num> chair, and a stool with a back of satten figured russet; <num value="10">ten</num> black, and <num value="6">six</num> stools covered with black wrought velvet; and also a great chest covered with black leather, with an in-lock and all things in it, excepting certain plate hereafter bequeathed. He left to his nephew <hi rend=italics>Hugh Pennant,</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Bychton, Flintshire,</hi> the manor of <hi rend=italics>Moxhall,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Essex,</hi> with a considerable estate; but the fruits of the labors of this industrious tradesman, were all dissipated by a <hi rend=italics>gentleman</hi> of the family, who fortunately quitted this life before he had wasted our paternal acres. But the charities of <hi rend=italics>William Pennant,</hi> to the poor of <hi rend=italics>Whiteford</hi> parish, in the county of <hi rend=italics>Flint,</hi> are more permanent: for to this day they completely cloath <num value="20">twenty</num> poor people; and in a few years more the trustees of the bequeathed lands flatter themselves with the hopes of doubling the number.
<p>WE now reach a great extent of holy ground, consecrated for the purposes of monastic life, or <pb id="p.266" n="266"> for the humane purpose of affording relief to our distressed brethren, in their passage through this world. I have not in view a conventual history of <hi rend=italics>London:</hi> but only mean to give a brief account of those foundations which have a clame to pre-eminence. <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Church of St. Bartholomew.</placename></NOTE> The church of <hi rend=italics>St. Bartholomew the Greater</hi> is at a small distance from <hi rend=italics>Smithfield;</hi> it is only the choir of the antient building, and the center on which stood the great tower. In the choir are the remains of the old architecture; massy columns, and round arches: <num value="8">eight</num> arches, part of the cloisters are still preserved in a neighboring stable. Adjacent is a portion of the south transept, now converted into a small burying-ground. This was <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Priory of St. Bartholomew.</placename></NOTE> a conventual church, belonging to a priory of Black Canons, founded in <datestruct value="1102--"><year reg="1102">1102</year></datestruct>, by <num value="1">one</num> <hi rend=italics>Rahere,</hi> minstrel or jester to <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> I; who, quitting his profligate life, became the <num value="1">first</num> prior of his own foundation. Legend relates, that he had a most horrible dream, out of which he was relieved by <hi rend=italics>St. Bartholomew</hi> himself, who directed him to found the house, and to dedicate it to him. <hi rend=italics>Rahere</hi> has here a handsome monument, beneath an arch divided by elegant tabernacle-work. His figure is recumbent, with an angel at his feet, and a canon in a great hood kneeling on each side, as if praying over him.

His lordship paints him as a man of a pleasant and companionable wit and conversation, and such a license in his words, and in his actions, that a man of less virtue could not be found out: yet, by making his house the rendezvous of all the silenced ministers; by spending a good part of his estate, of which he was very prodigal, upon them; and by being present with them at their devotions, and by making himself merry with them, and at them, which they dispensed with, he became the head of that party, and got the style of a <hi rend=italics>godly man.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Clarendon,</hi> ii. <num value="210">210</num>.</NOTE>
<p><rs>St. Bartholomew's hospital</rs> will ever be a <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>St. Bartholomew's Hospital.</placename></NOTE> monument of the piety of <hi rend=italics>Rahere;</hi> for from him it took its origin.

They raised vast sums for their buildings among the rich: and there were few of their admirers, when they came to die, who did not console themselves with the thoughts of lying within their expiating walls; and, if they were particularly wicked, thought themselves secure against the assault of the devil, provided their corpse was wrapped in the habit and cowl of a friar.

<p>SIR WALTER <num value="1">first</num> intended to found here a college for a warden, dean, and <num value="12">twelve</num> secular priests; but, changing his design, he, in conjunction with <hi rend=italics>Northburgh,</hi> bishop of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> founded a priory for <num value="24">twenty-four</num> monks, of the rigid order of <hi rend=italics>Carthusians,</hi> which was finished in <datestruct value="1370--"><year reg="1370">1370</year></datestruct>.<note><hi rend=italics>Tanner.</hi></NOTE> The last prior but <num value="1">one</num>, <hi rend=italics>John Howghton,</hi> subscribed to the king's supremacy in <datestruct value="1534--"><year reg="1534">1534</year></datestruct>; yet, was executed soon after, for his opposition to the royal will. <num value="3">Three</num> years after that there was a <num value="2">second</num> subscription, in which <hi rend=italics>William Trafford,</hi> the last prior, <pb id="p.280" n="280"> and <num value="2">two</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num> of his house, subscribed to the king's supremacy.<note><hi rend=italics>Willis's</hi> Abbies, ii. <num value="126">126</num>.</NOTE> At the Dissolution its revenues were reckoned, according to <hi rend=italics>Dugdale,</hi>
<num value="642">642</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> a year.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Mr. Sutton's Foundation.</NOTE> That gentleman made a most dignified use of his purchase. In the time of <hi rend=italics>James</hi> I. he converted it into a most magnificent hospital, consisting of a master, a preacher, a head school-master, and <num value="2">second</num> master, with <num value="44">forty-four</num> boys, <num value="80">eighty</num> decayed gentlemen, who had been soldiers or merchants, besides physician, surgeons, register, and other officers and servants of the house. Each decayed gentleman has <measure value="14l." type=currency><num value="14">fourteen</num> pounds</measure> a year, a gown, meat, fire, and lodgings; and <num value="1">one</num> of them may, if he chuses, attend the manciple to market, to see that he buys good provisions. This is the greatest gift in <hi rend=italics>England,</hi> either in protestant or catholic times, ever bestowed by a single man, till we come to the time of the foundation of <hi rend=italics>Guy's Hospital,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Southwark.</hi>

<p>There is scarcely any vestige of the conventual <pb id="p.281" n="281"> building, which is said to have stood in the present garden. The present extensive house was the work of the duke of <hi rend=italics>Norfolk.</hi> It was inhabited by the noble purchaser: the last time, it was made his easy prison; for, having been committed to the <hi rend=italics>Tower</hi> in <datestruct value="1569--"><year reg="1569">1569</year></datestruct>, he was permitted to return to his own house, under the custody of Sir <hi rend=italics>Henry Nevil,</hi> the plague at that time raging within the <hi rend=italics>Tower</hi> liberties. But soon relapsing into his romantic design of a marriage with the unhappy <hi rend=italics>Mary Stuart,</hi> he was here seized, and conveyed to his former place of confinement. In the great hall are the <hi rend=italics>Howard</hi> arms, and the date <datestruct value="1571"><year reg="1571">1571</year></datestruct>; the very year of his final imprisonment.
<p>HIS grandson, lord <hi rend=italics>Thomas Howard,</hi> was in possession of this house at the accession of <hi rend=italics>James</hi> I. This monarch, to shew his respect for a family which had so severely suffered in the cause of his mother, made his <num value="1">first</num> visit, on entering his new capital, on <hi rend=italics>May</hi> <num value="7">7th</num>, <datestruct value="1604--"><year reg="1604">1604</year></datestruct>, to this nobleman. His majesty and his train were most splendidly entertained here <num value="4">four</num> whole days;<note><hi rend=italics>Stow's Annals,</hi> <num value="823">823</num>.</NOTE> at his departure, he was as profuse of his honors as he had been at <hi rend=italics>Theobalds</hi> just before, for he dubbed here not fewer than fourscore knights.
<p>IN <num value="1">one</num> of the great apartments is a very good <pb id="p.282" n="282"> half-length of Mr. <hi rend=italics>Sutton,</hi> in a black gown furred, and with a white beard.&mdash;Mr. <hi rend=italics>Sutton</hi> was descended from a good family in the county of <hi rend=italics>Lincoln:</hi> and became, in the reign of queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth,</hi> <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest merchants in our capital. Vast as his wealth was, he was more distinguished by his integrity, generosity, and true charity than by his riches, which were all gained by fair trade, by honorable posts under government, and even by deeds of arms. In a letter of <hi rend=italics>marque</hi> he took a <hi rend=italics>Spanish</hi> prize, worth <measure value="20000l." type=currency><num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> pounds</measure>. He commanded the bark called the <hi rend=italics>Sutton,</hi> as a volunteer against the <hi rend=italics>Spanish Armada.</hi> I will return to his charities, to mention <num value="1">one</num> species, which I recommend in the strongest manner to all whom Heaven hath blessed with the luxurious power of doing good: &mdash;he was used, in dear years of grain, to buy great quantities, and to cause it to be retailed at lower prices to his poor neighbors. By this plan he relieved their wants, he took away the cause of riots, and probably prevented the rise of infectious disorders by the necessitated use of bad and unwholesome diet.
<p>I WILL now return to the subject of this noble foundation. He himself intended to have filled the post of master; but being seized with his last illness, by deed nominated the Reverend <hi rend=italics>John Hutton</hi> to the office. He died <hi rend=italics>December</hi> <num value="12">12th</num>, <pb id="p.283" n="283"> <datestruct value="1611--"><year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="79">79</num>: his body was embalmed, kept in his own house till <hi rend=italics>May</hi> <datestruct value="1612--"><year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct>, when it was deposited with great pomp in <hi rend=italics>Christ-church;</hi> from whence, in <datestruct value="1614--"><year reg="1614">1614</year></datestruct> (the chapel in his hospital being by that time finished) it was carried on the shoulders of the poor into the vault prepared for its reception. His figure, in a gown, lies recumbent on the tomb: on each side is a man in armour standing upright; and above a preacher addressing a full congregation. This was the work of <hi rend=italics>Nicholas Stone,</hi> who (including a little monument to Mr. <hi rend=italics>Law,</hi> <num value="1">one</num> of Mr. <hi rend=italics>Sutton's</hi> executors,) had <measure value="400l." type=currency><num value="400">four hundred</num> pounds</measure> for his performance.<note>Mr. <hi rend=italics>Walpole's Anecdotes,</hi> ii. <num value="25">25</num>.</NOTE>
<p>IN the Master's apartments are portraits of the following distinguished characters.

<p>THE earl of <hi rend=italics>Shaftsbury,</hi> in his chancellor's robes, sitting.
<p>CHARLES TALBOT, <num value="1">first</num> earl, and afterward duke of <hi rend=italics>Shrewsbury,</hi> a full-length, in robes of the garter, with a white rod, as lord treasurer, in <datestruct value="1714--"><year reg="1714">1714</year></datestruct>, delivered to him by the queen, with her dying hand. A nobleman of fine abilities, and fine address, wavering and unsettled: a strong revolutionist; yet, in a little time, seduced into a <pb id="p.284" n="284"> plan of dethroning the very prince whom he had invited over. He died neglected by all parties; permanent only in the protestant religion, to which he was an early convert by the arguments of our great <hi rend=italics>Tillotson.</hi> He died in <hi rend=italics>February</hi> <datestruct value="1718--"><year reg="1718">1718</year></datestruct>, giving, almost with his last breath, assurance of his adherence to the church of <hi rend=italics>England.</hi>

<p>THE duke of <hi rend=italics>Monmouth,</hi> in a long black wig, dressed like the former; but not so richly.
<p>THE munificent <hi rend=italics>Sheldon,</hi> archbishop of <hi rend=italics>Canterbury,</hi> is represented sitting. He did honor to his promotion by his patron <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> II. whom he attended in his exile. He was equally conspicuous for his charity and his piety. He expended above <measure value="66000l." type=currency><num value="66000">sixty-six thousand</num> pounds</measure> in public and private benefactions, in relieving the miserable distressed in the time of the pestilence, and in redeeming Christian slaves. His theatre at <hi rend=italics>Oxford</hi> is a magnificent proof of his respect to the university in which he had most honorably presided, as warden of the <hi rend=italics>College of All Souls.</hi>

<p>HERE is a <num value="3">three</num>-quarters piece of Doctor <hi rend=italics>Thomas Burnet,</hi> master of this house, highly celebrated for his learning, and equally so for the spirit with which he resisted the obtrusion of a <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> catholic into the office by <hi rend=italics>James</hi> II. He was the author of the famous Sacred Theory of the Earth, a beautiful and eloquent philosophical romance: and of the <hi rend=italics>Archaeologia Philosophica.</hi>
<pb id="p.285" n="285"> This latter subjected him to such censure, for the sceptical opinions it contained, as to prevent his farther preferment. He died in <datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct>. He is represented as a thin man, of a good countenance, in a black gown, and short hair.
<p>THE hero <hi rend=italics>William</hi> earl <hi rend=italics>Craven</hi> is the last; a full-length, in armour, with a truncheon; and a distant view of the camp.
<p>THESE noblemen had all been governors of this great charity.
<p>WHEN <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> lord <hi rend=italics>North</hi> resided at this house, he was honored by queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth</hi> with <num value="1">one</num> of her expensive visits. She went in procession from the <hi rend=italics>Tower,</hi> on <hi rend=italics>July</hi> <num value="10">10th</num>, <datestruct value="1561--"><year reg="1561">1561</year></datestruct>, on horseback, attended by a vast train: lord <hi rend=italics>Hunsdon,</hi> her kinsman, bore the sword before her: the ladies followed close behind, all on horseback. Here her highness staid <num value="4">four</num> days; supped with lord <hi rend=italics>Cecil</hi> on the <num value="4">fourth</num> night, returned, and took leave of her host the next morning;<note><hi rend=italics>Strype's</hi> Annals, i. <num value="269">269</num>.</NOTE> much, I dare say, to his satisfaction: for <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth</hi> seldom visited but to drain the purses of her good subjects: for wealth, she well knew, was productive of independence: and independence, she well knew, would be productive of resistance to her arbitrary spirit.
<p>Immediately beyond the <hi rend=italics>Charter-house,</hi> stood <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Priory of St. John of Jerusalem.</placename></NOTE> the priory of <hi rend=italics>St. John</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Jerusalem,</hi> of the warlike <pb id="p.286" n="286"> order of the knights hospitalers. After the taking of <hi rend=italics>Jerusalem</hi> from the <hi rend=italics>Saracens,</hi> there was a vast concourse of pilgrims to the holy sepulchre. A pious man of the name of <hi rend=italics>Gerardus,</hi> associating with other persons of his religious turn, assumed a black garment, with a white cross on it, with <num value="8">eight</num> spikes; and undertook the care of an hospital, before founded at <hi rend=italics>Jerusalem,</hi> for the use of the pilgrims; and also to protect them from insults on the road, either in coming or returning. <hi rend=italics>Godfrey</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Boulogne</hi> <num value="1">first</num> instituted the order; and, in reward of the valour of <hi rend=italics>Gerardus,</hi> at the battle of <hi rend=italics>Ascalon,</hi> endowed the knights with great estates, to enable them to support the object of their order: the kings of <hi rend=italics>France</hi> were the sovereigns. After the loss of <hi rend=italics>Jerusalem,</hi> they retired from place to place; but, having taken <hi rend=italics>Rhodes,</hi> fixed there, and were then styled Knights of <hi rend=italics>Rhodes.</hi> In <datestruct value="1522--"><year reg="1522">1522</year></datestruct>, on the loss of that island, they retreated to <hi rend=italics>Malta,</hi> and were afterwards known by the name of Knights of <hi rend=italics>Malta.</hi> The order, before the separation of <hi rend=italics>England</hi> from the church of <hi rend=italics>Rome,</hi> consisted of <num value="8">eight</num> nations. The world is filled with their prodigious valour.
<p>JORDAN BRISET, and <hi rend=italics>Muriel</hi> his wife, persons of rank, founded this house in the year <datestruct value="1100"><year reg="1100">1100</year></datestruct>, and it received consecration from <hi rend=italics>Heraclius,</hi> patriarch of <hi rend=italics>Jerusalem.</hi> This order at <num value="1">first</num> styled itself servant to the poor servants of the hospital at <hi rend=italics>Jerusalem;</hi>
<pb id="p.287" n="287"> but their vast endowments infected them with an uncommon degree of pride. The whole order had, in different parts of <hi rend=italics>Christendom,</hi> <num value="19000">nineteen thousand</num> manors. In <datestruct value="1323--"><year reg="1323">1323</year></datestruct>, the revenues of the <hi rend=italics>English</hi> knights templars were bestowed on them. This gave them such importance, that the prior was ranked as <num value="1">first</num> baron of <hi rend=italics>England,</hi> and lived in the highest state. Their luxury gave offence to the rebels of <hi rend=italics>Kent</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Essex,</hi> in <datestruct value="1381--"><year reg="1381">1381</year></datestruct>. These levellers burnt their house to the ground; but it soon rose with double splendor.

<p>THE house and church remained entire during <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>St. John's Clerkenwell.</placename></NOTE> the reign of <hi rend=italics>Henry,</hi> for he chose to keep in them his tents and toils for the chace. In that of his son, the church (famous for the beauty of its tower, which was graven, gilt, and enameled) was blown up with gunpowder, by order of the protector <hi rend=italics>Somerset,</hi> and the stones carried towards building his palace in the <hi rend=italics>Strand.</hi> In the next <pb id="p.288" n="288"> reign, a part of the choir which remained, and some side-chapels, were repaired by cardinal <hi rend=italics>Pole,</hi> and Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Tresham</hi> was appointed lord prior:<note>Mr. <hi rend=italics>Brooke, Somerset</hi> Herald.</NOTE> but the restoration was short-lived, being again suppressed by <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth.</hi>

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Albemarle-house.</placename></NOTE> CLOSE to <hi rend=italics>Clerkenwell-green,</hi> stands <hi rend=italics>Albemarle,</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Newcastle-house;</hi> the property and residence of the mad dutchess, widow of the <num value="2">second</num> duke of <hi rend=italics>Albemarle,</hi> and last surviving daughter and coheiress of <hi rend=italics>Henry Cavendish</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>Newcastle,</hi> who died here in <datestruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></datestruct>. At p. <num value="244">244</num>, some account is given of this lady. The house is entire, and at present occupied by a cabinet-maker. In the garden is <num value="1">one</num> side of the cloister of the nunnery, part of the wall, and a door belonging to the nuns' hall. Scattered over the ground are the remains of the antient monuments of Sir <hi rend=italics>William Weston,</hi> and others, shamefully ruined, being flung here during the rebuilding of the church.
<p>OPPOSITE to this house is another, very large, <pb id="p.293" n="293"> ascended to by a long flight of steps. It is now divided into <num value="3">three</num> houses. It is called <hi rend=italics>Oliver</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Cromwell-house.</placename></NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Cromwell's;</hi> and tradition says, it was his place of conference with <hi rend=italics>Ireton, Bradshaw,</hi> and others. If it had been his residence, it probably was usurped from some of the loyalists, and made his mansion, before he attained his fullness of power, and lived in regal state at <hi rend=italics>Whitehall.</hi>

<p>IN the fields, at a small distance from <hi rend=italics>Clerkenwell,</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>New River Head.</placename></NOTE> is the <hi rend=italics>New River Head,</hi> the great repository which supplies the largest portion of our capital with water. To extend the supply, another reservoir was made on the heights, at a little distance to the north, into which the water is forced by a steam engine; from hence it streams down to places which the other had not the power of benefiting. These reservoirs may be called the HEART of the work. The element, essentially useful as the vital fluid, at <num value="1">first</num> rushes through veins of vast diameter; divides into lesser; and again into thousands of ramifications, which support the life of this most populous city.
<p>NO <num value="1">one</num> ought to be ignorant that this unspeakable benefit is owing to a WELSHMAN! Sir HUGH MIDDLETON, of <hi rend=italics>Denbigh;</hi> who, on <hi rend=italics>September</hi>
<num value="20">20th</num>, <datestruct value="1608--"><year reg="1608">1608</year></datestruct>, began, and on <hi rend=italics>September</hi> <num value="29">29th</num>, <datestruct value="1613--"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct>, completed the great work. He brought the water from <hi rend=italics>Amwell,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Hertfordshire,</hi> a distance of <pb id="p.294" n="294"> <num value="20">twenty</num>, but, from the necessity of making a <hi rend=italics>detour</hi> to avoid hills and vallies, it was increased to <num value="38">thirty-eight</num> miles <num value="3">three</num> quarters and <num value="16">sixteen</num> poles. Yet it was impossible to escape difficulties. His daring spirit penetrated the hills in several places: and carried the river over <num value="2">two</num> vallies. Over <num value="1">one</num> it extended <num value="660">six hundred and sixty</num> feet in length, and <num value="30">thirty</num> in height: and over another, <num value="462">four hundred and sixty-two</num> feet in length. The original source of this river was, by the vast increase of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> found inadequate to its wants. The New River company found it necessary to have recourse to another supply. They applied to parlement for powers to obtain it from the river <hi rend=italics>Lee,</hi> the property of the city. <hi rend=italics>London</hi> opposed the benefit intended its inhabitants; but in vain! parlement wisely determined against their objections: so the blessing was forced upon them! and the river <hi rend=italics>Lee</hi> supplies the greater part of the wants of the city. Sir HUGH MIDDLETON was ruined by the execution of his project. So little was the benefit understood, that, for above <num value="30">thirty</num> years, the <num value="72">seventy-two</num> shares, it was divided into, produced only <measure value="5l." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> pounds</measure> apiece. Each of these shares was sold originally for a <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> pounds</measure>.

<p>I NOW descend to the <hi rend=italics>Temple,</hi> and resume my journey along <hi rend=italics>Fleet-street,</hi> as far as the southern extremity of the walls of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> the antient precinct.

<p>For this he was represented to king <hi rend=italics>Athelstan</hi> as a conjuror. He was an excellent workman in brass and iron.

<p>NEXT to the <hi rend=italics>Temple,</hi> is another <hi rend=italics>Serjeant's-Inn,</hi> destined, originally, for the same purpose as that in <hi rend=italics>Chancery-lane.</hi> And nearer to the <hi rend=italics>Thames,</hi> a little east of the <hi rend=italics>King's-Bench Walks,</hi> stood the <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>The White Friars.</placename></NOTE> church and convent of <hi rend=italics>Carmelites,</hi> or <hi rend=italics>White Friars;</hi> founded in <datestruct value="1241--"><year reg="1241">1241</year></datestruct>, by Sir <hi rend=italics>Richard Grey,</hi> ancestor of the lord <hi rend=italics>Greys</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Codnor.

<p>THE creek, called <hi rend=italics>Fleet-ditch,</hi> had its entrance <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Fleetditch.</placename></NOTE> from the <hi rend=italics>Thames</hi> immediately below <hi rend=italics>Bridewell;</hi> and reached as far as <hi rend=italics>Holborn-bridge,</hi> at the foot of <hi rend=italics>Holborn-hill;</hi> and received into it the little river <hi rend=italics>Fleet, Turnmill</hi> brook, and another called <hi rend=italics>Oldbourn,</hi> which gave name to that vast street. The tide flowed up as high as <hi rend=italics>Holborn-bridge,</hi> and brought up barges of considerable burden. Over it were <num value="4">four</num> stone bridges, and on the sides extensive quays and warehouses. It was of such utility, that it was scoured and kept open at a vast expence; and, not later than <datestruct value="1606--"><year reg="1606">1606</year></datestruct>, nearly <measure value="28000l." type=currency><num value="28000">twenty-eight thousand</num> pounds</measure> were expended for that purpose.
<p>In the performing of this work, at the depth of <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet, were found several <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> utensils; and a little deeper, a great quantity of <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> coins, in silver, copper, brass, and other metals, but none in gold. At <hi rend=italics>Holborn-bridge</hi> were found <num value="2">two</num> brazen <hi rend=italics>Lares,</hi> about <num value="4">four</num> inches long; <num value="1">one</num> a <hi rend=italics>Bacchus,</hi> the other a <hi rend=italics>Ceres.</hi> It is a probable conjecture <pb id="p.306" n="306"> that these were thrown in by the affrighted <hi rend=italics>Romans,</hi> at the approach of the enraged <hi rend=italics>Boadicea,</hi> who soon took ample revenge on her insulting conquerors. Here were also discovered numbers of <hi rend=italics>Saxon</hi> antiquities, spurs, weapons, keys, seals, &amp;c.; also medals, crosses, and crucifixes, which might likewise have been flung in on occasion of some alarm.
<p>THIS canal being afterward neglected, and becoming a nuisance, was filled up, and a sewer formed beneath to convey the water to the river. <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Fleet-market.</placename></NOTE> The fine market, which extends the whole length of the old ditch, rose in its place in <datestruct value="1733--"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>; in which year an act was passed to empower the lord mayor and citizens to fill up the ditch at their own expence, and to vest the fee-simple of the ground in them and their successors for ever. I recollect the present noble approach to <hi rend=italics>Blackfriars-bridge,</hi> the well-built opening of CHATHAMPLACE, a muddy and genuine ditch. This was the mouth of the creek, which, as <hi rend=italics>Stow</hi> informs us, in <datestruct value="1307--"><year reg="1307">1307</year></datestruct> was of depth and width sufficient &ldquo;that <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> ships navies at once, with merchandizes, were wont to come to the aforesaid bridge of <hi rend=italics>Fleete.</hi>&rdquo;<note>Survaie of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> p. <num value="15">15</num>.</NOTE> It must be recollected, that at this period there were drawbridges upon <hi rend=italics>London-bridge,</hi> through which ships of a certain <pb id="p.307" n="307"> size might pass, and discharge their cargoes in the mouth of the <hi rend=italics>Fleet.</hi>

<p>IN walking along the street, in my youth, on <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Profligate Marriages.</NOTE> the side next to this prison, I have often been tempted by the question, <hi rend=italics>Sir, will you be pleased to walk in and be married?</hi> Along this most lawless space was hung up the frequent sign of a male and female hand conjoined, with, <hi rend=italics>Marriages performed within,</hi> written beneath. A dirty fellow <pb id="p.310" n="310"> invited you in. The parson was seen walking before his shop; a squalid profligate figure, clad in a tattered plaid night-gown, with a fiery face, and ready to couple you for a dram of gin, or roll of tobacco. Our great chancellor, lord HARDWICKE, put these <hi rend=italics>d&aelig;mons</hi> to flight, and saved thousands from the misery and disgrace which would be entailed by these extemporary thoughtless unions.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>City walls.</NOTE> I SHALL now give a general view of the <hi rend=italics>Walls,</hi> the antient defence of the city; and of the <hi rend=italics>Townditch,</hi> a work of considerable labor. In my progress I shall point out whatsoever was remarkable in the adjacent suburbs, or the parts within the city which border on the walls. There never was any alteration made in the course of this <num value="1">first</num> precinct; it was preserved through all succeeding ages, and in every reparation or additional strength which was thought necessary. Its direction was from the <num value="1">first</num> irregular. The <hi rend=italics>Romans,</hi> as was frequently the case, consulted the necessity of the ground.<note><hi rend=italics>Vegetius.</hi></NOTE> It commenced at the <hi rend=italics>Palatine-tower,</hi> ran in a straight line along the eminence of <hi rend=italics>Ludgate-hill,</hi> and above <hi rend=italics>Fleet-ditch,</hi> as far as <hi rend=italics>Newgate;</hi> then suddenly was carried northerly to a spot a little beyond <hi rend=italics>Aldersgate,</hi> and at that place ran strait in a northern direction almost to <hi rend=italics>Cripplegate;</hi>
<pb id="p.311" n="311"> from whence it resumed a strait eastern course as far as <hi rend=italics>Bishopsgate,</hi> in which a long remnant of the wall, still called <hi rend=italics>London Wall,</hi> is to be seen. From <hi rend=italics>Bishopsgate</hi> it assumes a gentle curvature pointed to the <hi rend=italics>Tower,</hi> over the site of which it originally passed, and probably finished in a <hi rend=italics>Castellum</hi> in this, as it did in the western extremity. Another wall guarded the river, and ran the whole length of the south side of the city, in the direction of the vast street called <hi rend=italics>Thamesstreet.</hi> But all this I shall particularise in my walk round the antient walls.
<p>I SHALL <num value="1">first</num> mention another considerable addition to the strength of those fortifications. The <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Town-ditch.</placename></NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Town-ditch</hi> was a stupendous work, begun in the reign of king <hi rend=italics>John,</hi> in <datestruct value="1211--"><year reg="1211">1211</year></datestruct>, by the <hi rend=italics>Londoners</hi> themselves, possibly as a protection against their own monarch; who, in resentment to them, had just removed the Exchequer to <hi rend=italics>Northampton.</hi> It was <num value="200">two hundred</num> feet broad, and extended, on the outside of the walls, from <hi rend=italics>Tower-ditch,</hi> to <hi rend=italics>Christ's Hospital.</hi> Notwithstanding the multitude of hands employed, it was not finished in less than <num value="2">two</num> years. It was filled with water, as is evident from the quantity of good fish <hi rend=italics>Stow</hi> informs us were taken in it.<note><hi rend=italics>Survaie,</hi> i. p. <num value="47">47</num>.</NOTE> The citizens for some centuries were at a great expence in cleansing and keeping it <pb id="p.312" n="312"> open: but after the last attempt, in <datestruct value="1595--"><year reg="1595">1595</year></datestruct>, the work was given over, it became stable land, and was soon covered with buildings. Part remained within our memory. At present the site is beautified with a circus, crescent, and square.
<p>THE western wall terminated near the river with a fort, which I apprehend to have been the castle of <hi rend=italics>Montfichet,</hi> soon to be mentioned.
<p>NEAR it, in the course of the wall, stood <hi rend=italics>the Tower on the City Wall,</hi> built at the expence of the city, in the reigns of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> I. and II. in which those kings occasionally resided. It stood till the <num value="17">17th</num> of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VII. when it was pulled down.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Black Friars.</placename></NOTE> WITHIN the walls, opposite to <hi rend=italics>Bridewell,</hi> stood the great house of <hi rend=italics>Black Friars,</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Dominicans;</hi> founded by the interest and exhortations of <hi rend=italics>Robert Kilwarby,</hi> archbishop of <hi rend=italics>Canterbury,</hi> about <datestruct value="1276--"><year reg="1276">1276</year></datestruct>; when <hi rend=italics>Gregory Rocksley,</hi> and the barons of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> presented him with the ground. <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> I. and his queen <hi rend=italics>Eleanor</hi> became great benefactors; by the assistance of whom, the archbishop built the monastery, and a large church richly ornamented. This obtained every immunity which any religious house had. Its precinct was very large; it had <num value="4">four</num> gates, and contained numbers of shops, the inhabitants of which were subject only to the king, the superior of the house, and their own justices. It also became a sanctuary <pb id="p.313" n="313"> for debtors, and even malefactors; a privilege which it preserved even long after the suppression of religious houses.
<p>To make way for this foundation, <num value="2">two</num> lanes were pulled down, and a part of the city wall; which last was rebuilt immediately, by a charter granted by <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> I. for that purpose. The <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Castle of Montfichet.</placename></NOTE> castle of <hi rend=italics>Montfichet</hi> also fell a sacrifice to this house. It was built by <hi rend=italics>Gilbert de Montfichet,</hi> a follower of the Conqueror; and, growing ruinous, by gift of the king the materials were used for building the church, on the site of this antient tower. The church became a fashionable place of interment of people of rank; and to be buried in the habit of the order, was thought to be a sure preservative against the attacks of the devil. Among other illustrious personages were <hi rend=italics>Hubert de Burgh,</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Kent,</hi> and his wife <hi rend=italics>Margaret,</hi> sister to <hi rend=italics>Alexander</hi> II. king of <hi rend=italics>Scotland;</hi> the heart of queen <hi rend=italics>Eleanor;</hi> lord <hi rend=italics>Fanhope;</hi> that patron of learning <hi rend=italics>John Tiptoft,</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Worcester,</hi> beheaded in <datestruct value="1470--"><year reg="1470">1470</year></datestruct>; <hi rend=italics>James Touchet,</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Audley,</hi> beheaded in <datestruct value="1497--"><year reg="1497">1497</year></datestruct>; Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Brandon,</hi> knight of the Garter; <hi rend=italics>William Courtenay,</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Devonshire;</hi> and much other great and noble dust.
<p>IN the same church were also held several parlements. The remarkable <num value="1">one</num> of <datestruct value="1450--"><year reg="1450">1450</year></datestruct>, in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VI. was adjourned from <hi rend=italics>Westminster</hi> to this place: here the weak monarch vainly endeavoured <pb id="p.314" n="314"> to divert the storm raised by his subjects against the favorite of his queen, <hi rend=italics>William de la Pole,</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>Suffolk;</hi> and, by a poor expedient, a simulated exile, drove him to instant death.
<p>HERE, in <datestruct value="1524--"><year reg="1524">1524</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. held another, in order to oppress his subjects with an aid of <measure value="800000l." type=currency><num value="800000">eight hundred thousand</num> pounds</measure>, to carry on his imprudent wars. The virtue of the commons resisted the demand, and gave him only a moderate tax. This was called the <hi rend=italics>Black</hi> parlement, as it began amongst the <hi rend=italics>Black Monks,</hi> at <hi rend=italics>Westminster;</hi> and ended among the <hi rend=italics>Black Friars.</hi>

<p>HERE cardinal <hi rend=italics>Campeggio,</hi> and cardinal <hi rend=italics>Wolsey,</hi> sat, in <datestruct value="1529--"><year reg="1529">1529</year></datestruct>, as judges and legates, on the question of divorce between <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> and the illfated princess <hi rend=italics>Catherine</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Arragon; Henry</hi> and his queen at that time residing in the palace of <hi rend=italics>Bridewell,</hi> ready to attend the farcical citations of that court. And in this place <hi rend=italics>Wolsey</hi> himself fell from all his greatness; for here began the parlement which gave the sentence of <hi rend=italics>premunire,</hi> the last stroke to all his prosperity.
<p>NOTWITHSTANDING all the great events which honored this house, its revenues, at the Dissolution, were only <measure value="100l. 15s. 5d." type=Currency><num value="100">one hundred</num> pounds <num value="15">fifteen</num> shillings and <num value="5">five</num> pence</measure>.

The prior's lodgings, and the hall, were sold to Sir <hi rend=italics>Francis Bryan,</hi> in <datestruct value="1547--"><year reg="1547">1547</year></datestruct>. <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi>
<pb id="p.315" n="315"> VI. afterward granted the rest to Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Cawarden.</hi>

<p>IN the reign of queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth,</hi> the <hi rend=italics>Black Friars</hi> became a place much inhabited by people of fashion. Among others, <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> lord <hi rend=italics>Herbert,</hi> son of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Worcester,</hi> Lord Privy- Seal,<note><hi rend=italics>Collins's</hi> peerage, i. <num value="252">252</num>.</NOTE> had a house here, which queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth,</hi> in <datestruct value="1600--"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct>, honored with her presence, on occasion of his nuptials with the daughter and heiress of <hi rend=italics>John</hi> lord <hi rend=italics>Russel,</hi> son of <hi rend=italics>Francis</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Bedford.</hi> The queen was met at the water-side by the bride, and carried to her house in a <hi rend=italics>lectica</hi> by <num value="6">six</num> knights; her majesty dined there, and supped in the same neighborhood, with lord <hi rend=italics>Cobham;</hi> where there was &ldquo;a memorable maske of <num value="8">8</num> ladies, and a straunge dawnce new invented.

In the midst of the discourse the floor fell, and <num value="94">ninety-four</num> persons, besides the preacher, perished. It is disgusting to reflect on the uncharitable bigotry of the times. The <hi rend=italics>Protestants</hi> considered the accident as a judgment on the <hi rend=italics>Catholics,</hi> for their idolatry: the <hi rend=italics>Catholics</hi> attributed it to a plot of the <hi rend=italics>Protestants,</hi> to bring destruction on their dissenting brethren.

It was enlarged, and had the addition of a chapel, by Sir <hi rend=italics>Stephen Forster,</hi> on a very romantic occasion. He had been confined there, and, begging at the grate, was accosted by a rich widow, who asked him what sum would purchase his liberty. She payed it down, took him into her service, and afterward married him. In the chapel was an inscription in honor of him and <hi rend=italics>Agnes</hi> his wife, dated <datestruct value="1454--"><year reg="1454">1454</year></datestruct>, the year in which he enjoyed the honor of being lord mayor of the city.

<p>By a sort of <num value="2">second</num> sight, the Surgeons Theatre <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Surgeons theatre.</placename></NOTE> <pb id="p.322" n="322"> was built near this court of conviction and <hi rend=italics>Newgate,</hi> the concluding stage of the lives forfeited to the justice of their country, several years before the fatal tree was removed from <hi rend=italics>Tyburn</hi> to its present site. It is a handsome building, ornamented with <hi rend=italics>ionic</hi> pilasters; and with a double flight of stops to the <num value="1">first</num> floor.<note>This was taken down in the recent improvements, and the Theatre removed to <hi rend=italics>Lincoln's Inn Fields,</hi> where a stately edifice is just completed for the use of the Society.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Newgate;</placename></NOTE> THE new prison, which retains the name of <hi rend=italics>Newgate,</hi> from the gate which, till within these few years, formed a part of it, is immediately beyond the Sessions-house: a massy building, with an extensive front of rustic work, having all the appearance of strength and security. Yet, in the infamous riots of <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, the felons confined even in the strongest holds were released; stones of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> tons in weight, to which the doors of their cells were fastened, were raised by that resistless species of crow, well known to housebreakers by the name of the <hi rend=italics>Pig's-foot.</hi> Such was the violence of the fire, that the great iron bars of the windows were eaten through; and the adjacent stones vitrified. <pb id="p.323" n="323">
<p>THE gate stood a little beyond this building: <NOTE PLACE=MARG>When Built.</NOTE> and as a military way has been traced under it, no doubt there must have been <num value="1">one</num> during the time the city was possessed by the <hi rend=italics>Romans:</hi> although the place had been made up, and no vestiges of it left. The gate which supplied its place, is supposed by <hi rend=italics>Stow</hi> to have been erected between the years <datestruct value="1108--"><year reg=1108>1108</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1128--"><year reg=1128>1128</year></datestruct>, when <hi rend=italics>Richard Beauveyes,</hi> bishop of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> by enlarging the precinct of <hi rend=italics>St. Paul's,</hi> had obstructed the usual way under <hi rend=italics>Ludgate,</hi> and made this new outlet necessary.

In <datestruct value="1412--"><year reg="1412">1412</year></datestruct>, this gate was rebuilt by the executors of the famous Sir <hi rend=italics>Richard Whittington,</hi> out of the effects he had allotted for works of charity: his statue, with the cat, remained in a niche to its final demolition, on the rebuilding of the present prison. It was destroyed in the fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, and rebuilt in its late form. It <pb id="p.324" n="324"> had <num value="1">one</num> great arch, and <num value="1">one</num> postern for passengers: and on each side a half hexagon tower.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>New Compter.</placename></NOTE> TO the north of <hi rend=italics>Newgate,</hi> immediately across the street (and, with the east end of <hi rend=italics>St. Sepulchre's</hi> church, forming the entrance of <hi rend=italics>Giltspurstreet</hi>) is lately built a vast pile, of a proper strength and simplicity, intended to supply the place of <num value="1">one</num> or both of the city prisons, called <hi rend=italics>Compters.</hi>&mdash;This, and the edifices just mentioned, form all together a superb, but melancholy groupe of public buildings; and are a noble improvement of this spot; which, a few years ago, was much incumbered with a number of old houses, interrupting the free course of the air, the view, and the intercourse of passengers.

<p>THE <hi rend=italics>Bagnio</hi> in this court seems the <num value="1">first</num> we <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Bagnios.</placename></NOTE> had in our capital: a neat contrived building, says <hi rend=italics>Strype,</hi> after the <hi rend=italics>Turkish</hi> fashion, for the purposes of sweating and hot-bathing; and much approved by the physicians of the time. It probably was somewhat of the nature of <hi rend=italics>Dominicetti's</hi> plan. At length it also became a sort of <hi rend=italics>Hotel,</hi> or lodginghouse, for any short period. This, and the <hi rend=italics>Hummums</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Covent-garden,</hi> were the only houses of the kind which supported a fair character; till <hi rend=italics>Pero's,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>St. James's-street,</hi> was set up: since which, the conveniency of <hi rend=italics>Hotels,</hi> on the <hi rend=italics>French</hi> model, is universally experienced. Doctor <hi rend=italics>Shaw</hi> in his Travels, p. <num value="231">231</num>, observes, that <hi rend=italics>Hummums</hi> is corrupted from the <hi rend=italics>Arabic</hi> word <hi rend=italics>Hammam,</hi> which signifies a Bagnio or Bath.
<p>IN the wall of a house in <hi rend=italics>Pannier-alley,</hi> in this, or rather <hi rend=italics>Blow-bladder-street,</hi> is a figure in stone of a naked boy, sitting on something like a pannier; and beneath is this inscription:

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Bridgewater-House.</placename></NOTE> THE earls of <hi rend=italics>Bridgewater</hi> had also a house in the <hi rend=italics>Barbican,</hi> called after their title.

It was in the last century, at the time <hi rend=italics>Newcastle</hi> was besieged, celebrated for its orchards, productive of such quantities of fruits, says Mr. EVELYN, as never were produced before or after that time. Mr. EVELYN attributes this to the decrease of smoke, resulting from the scarcity of coal in the <pb id="p.333" n="333"> capital from that event. He inveighs with great indignation at the increase of that species of fuel; and at the introduction of so many manufactories, productive of smoke, which not only deformed our noblest buildings with the sooty tinge, but also, from the quantity of coal, brought on catarrhs, coughs, and consumptions, in a degree unknown in <hi rend=italics>Paris,</hi> and other cities, who make use of wood only. His words are strong: &ldquo;The city of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi>&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;resembles rather the face of mount <hi rend=italics>&AElig;tna,</hi> the court of <hi rend=italics>Vulcan Stromboli,</hi> or the suburbs of <hi rend=italics>Hell,</hi> than an assembly of rational creatures, and the imperial seat of our incomparable monarch.&rdquo;<note><rs>Evelyn's</rs> <hi rend=italics>Fumifugium,</hi> <num value="18">18</num>, <num value="19">19</num>, <num value="21">21</num>, <num value="30">30</num>.</NOTE> The project of this good and able writer, of supplying <hi rend=italics>London</hi> with wood fires, was certainly very humane: but, from the destruction of the woods even in his days, was as little feasible as it would be at present.

<p>BY this charter, barbers were not to practise surgery, farther than drawing of teeth: and surgeons were strictly prohibited from the feat or craft of barbery, or shaving. Use was to make both perfect. But by the year <datestruct value="1745"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct>, it having been discovered, that the above arts were foreign to, and independent of each other, the barbers and the surgeons were, by act of parlement, separated, and made distinct corporations. It was very fit that an association, which was now become very ludicrous, should be dissolved: our surgeons began at that period to rise into great fame. True it is, that pupils then went to <hi rend=italics>Paris</hi> to improve in the art: at present, <hi rend=italics>Europe</hi> looks <pb id="p.339" n="339"> up to our surgeons as at the summit of the profession.
<p>IT will be curious to turn back from these times to those of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. to compare the state of surgery: when at <num value="1">one</num> time there were very few, as <hi rend=italics>Gale</hi> tells us, worthy to be called surgeons. His account of those employed in the army is very humorous. &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;when I was in the wars at <hi rend=italics>Muttrel (Montreuil)</hi> in the time of that most famous prince king <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. there was a great rabblement, that took on them to be surgeons: some were sow-gelders, and some horse-gelders, with tinkers, and coblers. This noble sect did such great cures, that they got themselves a perpetual name; for, like as <hi rend=italics>Thessalus's</hi> sect were called <hi rend=italics>Thessalions,</hi> so was this noble rabblement, for their notorious cures, called <hi rend=italics>Dogleaches;</hi> for in <num value="2">two</num> dressings they did commonly make their cures whole and sound for ever; so that they neither felt heat nor cold, nor no manner of pain after. But when the duke of <hi rend=italics>Norfolk,</hi> who was then general, understood how the people did die, and that of small wounds, he sent for me, and certain other surgeons, commanding us to make search how these men came to their death; whether it were by the grievousness of their wounds, or by the lack of knowledge of the surgeons; and we, <pb id="p.340" n="340"> according to our commandment, made search through all the camp; and found many of the same good fellows, which took upon them the names of surgeons; not only the names, but the wages also. We asking of them whether they were surgeons or no, they said they were; we demanded with whom they were brought up, and they, with shameless faces, would answer, either with <num value="1">one</num> cunning man, or another, which was dead. Then we demanded of them what chirurgery stuff they had to cure men withal; and they would shew us a pot, or a box, which they had in a budget; wherein was such trumpery as they did use to grease horses heels withal, and laid upon scabbed horses backs, with rewal, and such like. And others, that were coblers and tinkers, they used shoemaker's wax, with the rust of old pans, and made therewithal a noble salve, as they did term it. But in the end, this worthy rabblement was committed to the <hi rend=italics>Marshalsea,</hi> and threatened, by the duke's grace, to be hanged for their worthy deeds, except they would declare the truth what they were, and of what occupations; and in the end they did confess, as I have declared to you before.&rdquo;<note><hi rend=italics>Aikin's</hi> Memoirs of Medicine, p. <num value="99">99</num>.</NOTE> I must not <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Picture of dr.

They have under their care alms-houses for <num value="10">ten</num> poor men, and as many women. <hi rend=italics>John Sympson,</hi> rector of <pb id="p.343" n="343"> <hi rend=italics>St. Olave's,</hi> who superintended the building,<note><hi rend=italics>Newcourt's Repertorium,</hi> i. <num value="348">348</num>.</NOTE> added, at his own expence, for the use of the studious part of the <hi rend=italics>London</hi> clergy, a library <num value="120">one hundred and twenty</num> feet long; and amply filled with books. The original hospital was founded by <hi rend=italics>William Elsing,</hi> mercer, in <datestruct value="1329--"><year reg="1329">1329</year></datestruct> (on the site of a decayed nunnery) for the support of a <num value="100">hundred</num> blind men. He afterward changed it into a priory, and became himself the <num value="1">first</num> prior; who, with <num value="4">four</num> canons regular, were to superintend the miserable objects.
<p>NEAR the corner of the wall, to the north of <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>St. James's in the Wall.</placename></NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Sion College,</hi> stood the chapel of <hi rend=italics>St. James's in the Wall,</hi> belonging to an hermitage dependent on the Abbey of <hi rend=italics>Gerandon,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Leicestershire,</hi> as early as the year <datestruct value="1298"><year reg="1298">1298</year></datestruct>. The abbot placed here <num value="2">two</num> chaplains, <hi rend=italics>Cistercian</hi> monks of their house, to pray for the souls of <hi rend=italics>Aymer de Valence,</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Pembroke,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Mary</hi> his wife. After the Dissolution, it was granted to <hi rend=italics>William Lambe,</hi> <num value="1">one</num> of the gentlemen of the chapel to <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. citizen and cloth-worker, who endowed and gave it to the cloth-workers of <hi rend=italics>London.</hi> Here the company have <num value="4">four</num> sermons preached to them annually, on which times, the master, wardens, and livery of the company, after the sermon, relieve with clothing and money <num value="12">twelve</num> poor men, and <pb id="p.344" n="344"> as many women. This was but a small part of the charities of this good man, which extended over most parts of the city. <hi rend=italics>Lamb's Conduit fields</hi> took their name from <num value="1">one</num> of them. He founded in that tract, or on the part to which they did in his days extend, several conduits, distinguished by a lamb on the top of the buildings. These were of no small service before the bringing of the New River to supply the capital. This worthy benefactor died in <datestruct value="1577--"><year reg="1577">1577</year></datestruct>, was buried in <hi rend=italics>St. Faith's</hi> church, and is commemorated by an epitaph filled with irresistible puns on his innocent name.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Grub-street.</placename></NOTE> I PASS by <hi rend=italics>Cripplegate,</hi> by the south ends of <hi rend=italics>Whitecross-street,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Grub-street:</hi> the last celebrated for the (supposed) residence of authors of the less fortunate tribe, and the trite and illiberal jest of the more favored. In this same street dwelt <hi rend=italics>John Fox,</hi> above-mentioned; and the very remarkable <hi rend=italics>Henry Welby,</hi> esq; of <hi rend=italics>Lincolnshire,</hi> who lived in his house, in this street, <num value="44">forty-four</num> years, without ever being seen by any human being, excepting an old maid servant, who only was permitted to approach him in cases of great necessity. He was to the hour of his death possessed of a large estate; but an attempt being made on his life, by his ungrateful younger brother, he took the frantic resolution, thus to seclude himself from the world. He passed his days in most exemplary <pb id="p.345" n="345"> charity. He died <hi rend=italics>October</hi> <num value="29">29th</num>, <datestruct value="1636--"><year reg="1636">1636</year></datestruct>, and was buried in the church of <hi rend=italics>St. Giles's, Cripplegate.</hi> His old maid servant died only <num value="6">six</num> days before her master. It is therefore not improbable that Mr. <hi rend=italics>Welby</hi> died for want of assistance, as in our days that oddity Mr. <hi rend=italics>Elwes</hi> had nearly done, on the death of his old woman. Mr. <hi rend=italics>Welby's</hi> management, in his strange retreat, is too long to relate: the curious reader will find the whole in the <num value="369">369</num>th page of the <hi rend=italics>Ph&oelig;nix Britannicus.</hi>

<p>THE Fletchers, Bowyers, makers of Bowstrings, and of every thing relating to archery, inhabited, in old times, this street. It is the last street, in this part of the town, which was in being about the time of <hi rend=italics>Aggas's</hi> map: all beyond (as far as <hi rend=italics>Bishopsgate-street Without</hi>) were gardens, fields, or morass: the last the original state of this part of the present <hi rend=italics>London.</hi> This tract was in the <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Finsbury</placename>, and <placename>Moorfields.</placename></NOTE> manor of <hi rend=italics>Finsbury,</hi> or rather <hi rend=italics>Fensbury;</hi> and, in the days of the historian <hi rend=italics>Fitzstephen,</hi> was an arrant fen; of which he gives the following account, in his description of the pastimes of the citizens, in his time; in which is mentioned the awkward substitute of the skate. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; says the historian, &ldquo;when that vast lake, which waters the walls of the city towards the north, is hard frozen, the youth in great numbers go to divert themselves on the ice; some taking a small run, for an increment of velocity, place their feet at <pb id="p.346" n="346"> a proper distance, and are carried sliding sideways a great way. Other will make a large cake of ice, and, seating <num value="1">one</num> of their companions upon it, they take hold of <num value="1">one</num>'s hands and draw him along, when it happens, that, moving swiftly on so slippery a plain, they all fall headlong. Others there are who are still more expert in these amusements on the ice; they place certain bones, the leg-bones of animals, under the soles of their feet, by tying them round their ankles, and then, taking a pole shod with iron into their hands, they push themselves forward by striking it against the ice, and are carried on with a velocity equal to the flight of a bird, or a bolt discharged from a cross-bow.&rdquo;<note><hi rend=italics>Fitzstephen,</hi>

<p>THESE fields were, till of late years, the haunt of most motley amusements, and some of not the most innocent nature; among them was every allurement to low gaming, by little fraudulent tricks. It was likewise the great <hi rend=italics>Gymnasium</hi> of our capital, the resort of wrestlers, boxers, runners, and foot-ball players, and the scene of every manly recreation. Here the mountebanks set up their stages, and dispensed infallible medicines, for every species of disease, to the gaping gulls who surrounded them. Here too, I lament to <pb id="p.347" n="347"> say, religion set up its stage itinerant, beneath the shade of the trees; and here the pious wellmean- ing <hi rend=italics>Whitefield</hi> long preached so successfully, as to steal from a neighboring <hi rend=italics>charlatan</hi> the greater part of his numerous admirers, in defiance of the eloquence of the doctor, and the witty sallies of his pied attendant. The faithful <hi rend=italics>merry andrew</hi> told his master not to be discouraged: he would engage soon to dislodge this powerful adversary. He accordingly climbed a tree above the head of the zealous preacher, who, in the midst of an ecstatic attitude, received from the impious wretch the full effects of a most active drug, and was forced to quit his discourse with the utmost precipitation. But <hi rend=italics>andrew</hi> found it difficult to escape with his life; for he was assailed on all sides by showers of stones from the justly enraged congregation; and long felt, in his battered bones, the consequence of his wit. Mr. <hi rend=italics>Whitefield</hi> used often to relate the adventure with much humour: and I received the account from a gentleman who heard him describe his piteous mishap.
<p>ON the north part of these fields stood the <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Dog-House.</placename></NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Dogge-house,</hi> in which were kept the hounds for the amusement of the lord mayor. Here resided the <hi rend=italics>Common Hunt,</hi> an officer, the <num value="2">second</num> in rank among those who formed the <hi rend=italics>Pr&aelig;torian</hi> establishment: <hi rend=italics>Master Sword-bearer</hi> alone took place of him: <hi rend=italics>Master Common Hunt</hi> followed him, and <pb id="p.348" n="348"> was to wait for his lordship's commands, on <hi rend=italics>Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Saturdays.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Strype's Stow,</hi> ii. book v. p. <num value="163">163</num>. and his Survaie, p. <num value="960">960</num>.</NOTE>
<p>IT was, in the time of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> II. of so little value, that the whole was let at the rent of <measure value="4bmark" type=currency><num value="4">four</num> marks</measure> a year. It could only be passed over on causeways, raised for the benefit of travellers. In <datestruct value="1414--"><year reg="1414">1414</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>Thomas Fauconer,</hi> mayor, opened the <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Moorgate.</placename></NOTE> postern in the wall, called <hi rend=italics>Moorgate,</hi> to give the citizens a passage into the country. He also began to drain this watery tract. In <datestruct value="1512--"><year reg="1512">1512</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>Roger Atchley,</hi> mayor, made further progress in the work.<note><hi rend=italics>Dugdale</hi> on embanking, <num value="73">73</num>.</NOTE> Successive attempts brought the ground into the state we see it at present.
<p>THE manors of <hi rend=italics>Holywell</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Finsbury,</hi> were early granted to the prebend of <hi rend=italics>Finsbury</hi> in the cathedral of <hi rend=italics>St. Paul's.</hi> In <datestruct value="1315--"><year reg="1315">1315</year></datestruct>, the prebendary, <hi rend=italics>Robert de Baldock,</hi> granted all his clame in the said manors<note><hi rend=italics>Newcourt's Repert.</hi> i. <num value="159">159</num>. They were called <hi rend=italics>Mora de Halywell et Finesbury.</hi></NOTE> to Sir <hi rend=italics>John Gisors,</hi> mayor, and to the commonalty of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> for which they were to pay to <hi rend=italics>Baldock,</hi> and his successors, annually, the sum of xx<hi rend=italics>s.</hi> The right afterwards reverted to the church; and the prebendary granted, within this century, to the city a lease for <num value="41">forty-one</num> years, on which a few buildings were erected. It was then discovered that to build on so short a tenure <pb id="p.349" n="349"> would be imprudent. The prebendary and the city applied to parlement, and got the power enlarged to <num value="99">ninety-nine</num> years. The prebendary for the time being and the city unite in granting the leases. On this, <hi rend=italics>Finsbury-square</hi> arose within these <num value="2">two</num> years: a square that does not give place in beauty, and not much in size, to the most boasted in the west end of the town. To the disgrace of the builders, <num value="2">two</num> houses on the south fell down almost as soon as they were built: and the rest of that side is in a most perilous state. The city caused a survey to be made: and the demolition of that side now depends on the resolutions of the next common-council. Possibly the gibbeting of a builder (in effigy) in the middle of the area, may have a happy effect throughout the capital. The late prebendary got for himself and family above <measure value="2000l." type=currency><num value="2000">two thousand</num> pounds</measure> a year for the remainder of the lease. It is said that the value of rent to the prebendary in possession, and to the city, is at this time not less than <measure value="6000l." type=currency><num value="6000">six thousand</num> pounds</measure> a year.
<p>BETWEEN <hi rend=italics>Bishopsgate</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Moorfields</hi> stood <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Bethlem</placename>, or <placename>Bedlam.</placename></NOTE> the hospital of <hi rend=italics>St. Mary</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Bethlem;</hi> founded by <hi rend=italics>Simon Fitz-mary,</hi> sheriff of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> in <datestruct value="1247--"><year reg="1247">1247</year></datestruct>, for a prior, canons, brethren, and sisters, of a peculiar order; subject to the visitation of the bishop of <hi rend=italics>Bethlem.</hi> They were to be dressed in a black habit, and distinguished by a star on their <pb id="p.350" n="350"> breast.<note><hi rend=italics>Steven's</hi> Suppl. ii. <num value="274">274</num>.</NOTE> In <datestruct value="1403--"><year reg="1403">1403</year></datestruct> most of the houses belonging to this hospital were alienated, and only the master left, who did not wear the habit of the order.

The mayor and commonalty had taken some steps to execute his design: but in <datestruct value="1545--"><year reg="1545">1545</year></datestruct> were prevented by the munificence of their monarch, who bestowed it on the city of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> when it was converted to the humane purpose of receiving persons laboring under this most dreadful of maladies. At <num value="1">first</num> (the medical relief excepted) their expences were borne by their friends, or their parishes; but this edifice being found too small, and growing ruinous, in <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct> the lord mayor and aldermen, removing the site to the present place, began the noble hospital we now see; and, great as it is, finished it in the next year, at the expence of <num value="17000">seventeen thousand</num> <pb id="p.351" n="351"> pounds. The front and wings extend <num value="540">five hundred and forty</num> feet; and make a magnificent appearance.

<p>The great population of this part of the town, <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Spittlefields.</placename></NOTE> called <hi rend=italics>Spittle-fields,</hi> was owing to the blessed persecutions of the <hi rend=italics>Huguenots,</hi> in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Louis le Grand;</hi> who sent thousands of his industrious subjects into our kingdom, to transfer to his bitterest enemies the arts and manufactures of his own. They flourished in this place to a great <pb id="p.360" n="360"> degree: at present they suffer a temporary depression from the giddiness of fashion, which, of late, preferred the vegetable material of cotton, to that produced from the antient silkworm.

<p>LONG after, <hi rend=italics>Shoreditch</hi> acquired much fame from another great man, <hi rend=italics>Barlo,</hi> an inhabitant of this place, and a citizen; who acquired such honor as an archer, by his success in a shooting-match at <hi rend=italics>Windsor,</hi> before <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. that the king named him on the spot <hi rend=italics>Duke of Shoreditch.</hi> For a long series of years after this, the captain of the archers of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> retained the title. On the <num value="17">17th</num> of <hi rend=italics>September,</hi> <datestruct value="1583--"><year reg="1583">1583</year></datestruct>, the <hi rend=italics>Duke</hi> (at the expence of the city) had a magnificent trial of skill: he sent a summons to all his officers, and chief nobility, with all their train of archery in and about <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> to be ready to accompany him to <hi rend=italics>Smithfield.</hi> In obedience, appeared the marquis of <hi rend=italics>Barlo,</hi> and the marquis of <hi rend=italics>Clerkenwell,</hi> with hunters who <pb id="p.362" n="362"> wound their horns; the marquises of <hi rend=italics>Islington, Hogsden, Pankridge,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Shacklewell,</hi> who marched with all their train fantastically habited. Nearly a <num value="1000">thousand</num> had gold chains; and all were gorgeously attired. The sum of archers were <num value="3000">three thousand</num>; their guards, with bills, <num value="4000">four thousand</num>; besides pages and henchmen. And the duke sallied out to meet them from <hi rend=italics>Merchant Taylors hall,</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Strype's Stow,</hi> i. book i. p. <num value="250">250</num>.</NOTE> to exhibit such a sight that was never seen before, nor ever will again; unless a combination of the modern societies of archers should treat the capital with the revival of this antient and worthy pageantry.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Bishopsgate.</placename></NOTE> THE building of <hi rend=italics>Bishopsgate,</hi> which divides the street, is attributed to <hi rend=italics>Erkenwald,</hi> elected bishop of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> in <num value="675">675</num>: the reparation of it, to <hi rend=italics>William,</hi> prelate at the time of the Conquest. <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> III. confirmed to the <hi rend=italics>Hans</hi> merchants certain privileges, for which they were bound to support this gate. Accordingly, in <datestruct value="1479--"><year reg="1479">1479</year></datestruct>, it was elegantly rebuilt by them. In memory of the founder, and the <num value="1">first</num> repairer, there were <num value="2">two</num> statues of bishops: and besides, <num value="2">two</num> others, conjectured to have been designed for <hi rend=italics>Alfred,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Aeldred</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Mercia,</hi> to whose care that great prince had committed the gate.
<p>NOT far without the gate stands a house, called <pb id="p.363" n="363"> the <hi rend=italics>White Hart,</hi> of most antient date, not less <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>White Hart.</placename></NOTE> than <datestruct value="1480--"><year reg="1480">1480</year></datestruct>, which is still perpetuated in large figures in the front: but none of the original building appears to be left.

The great fire almost entirely destroyed those in the city. In <hi rend=italics>Holborn, Broad St. Giles's,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>St. John's Lane, Clerkenwell,</hi> are some old houses: in <hi rend=italics>Catherine Wheel Alley,</hi> in this street, is a very old house in a ruinous state: and there are some also about <hi rend=italics>Temple-bar.</hi> It is no wonder that we have so few; till about the year <datestruct value="1200"><year reg="1200">1200</year></datestruct> there were very few stone houses, and none tiled or slated: they were built with wood, and thatched with straw or reeds. In the year <datestruct value="1189"><year reg="1189">1189</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> I. ordered that they should be built with stone to a certain height, and that they should be covered with slate or burnt tile. This order was repeated, but it was long before it was obeyed. This is not much to be wondered at; for, above a century afterward, such simplicity reigned, that <num value="1">one</num> <hi rend=italics>Peter Spileman</hi> made fine for his lands to <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> II. to find (among other things) <hi rend=italics>litter</hi> for the king's bed, and hay for his horse.<note><hi rend=italics>Blunt's</hi> Jocular Tenures, <num value="123">123</num>, last edition.</NOTE>

Here it was customary for pious people to walk, on purpose to relieve the bed-ridden, who lay on a ground floor, covered with a neat cloth, and with a pair of beads, to shew to charitable passengers their helpless situation, and that they were incapable of doing more than pray for them.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Duke's Place.</placename></NOTE> <rs>Duke's Place</rs> is of considerable extent; much inhabited by the <hi rend=italics>Jews:</hi> it stands on the site of the <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Priory of Christchurch.</placename></NOTE> priory of the <hi rend=italics>Holy Trinity,</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Christ-church;</hi> founded in <datestruct value="1108--"><year reg="1108">1108</year></datestruct>, by <hi rend=italics>Matilda,</hi> wife to <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> I: the prior was always an alderman of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> and of <hi rend=italics>Portsoken</hi> ward; who, if he happened to be exceedingly pious, appointed a substitute to transact temporal matters. <hi rend=italics>Norman</hi> was the <num value="1">first</num> prior; and he and his successors rode, on solemn days, with the aldermen, but in their monastic habits. This is said to have been the richest priory in <hi rend=italics>England;</hi> and possibly for that reason was selected to be the <num value="1">first</num> which was dissolved.<note><hi rend=italics>Fuller's</hi> Church History, book vi. <num value="306">306</num>.</NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi>

<p><num value="2">Two</num> gateways, and some parts of the ruins of this priory, may be still traced, enveloped in more modern buildings: some of the south transept may be discovered in certain houses; from which it appears that the architecture was of the round arch, or <hi rend=italics>Saxon</hi> style.<note>Mr. <hi rend=italics>Carter</hi> has made drawings of these remains.</NOTE>

The arches are very elegant, supported by ribs, which converge, and meet on the capitals of the pillars; which are now nearly buried in the earth; but are supposed to be covered with <num value="16">sixteen</num> feet of soil. The whole addition of soil, since its foundation, probably amounts to <num value="26">twenty-six</num> feet; an amazing increase, which might almost occasion <num value="1">one</num> to suspect it to have been the sub-chapel of some now-lost church.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>St. James's, Duke's Place.</placename></NOTE> THE church of <hi rend=italics>St. James, Duke's Place,</hi> rose out of the ruins of this priory, in the time of <hi rend=italics>James</hi> I. and the mayoralty of Sir <hi rend=italics>Edward Barkham.</hi>

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Aldgate.</placename></NOTE> EALDGATE, or <hi rend=italics>Aldgate,</hi> which signifies <hi rend=italics>Old Gate,</hi> stood in the place where the wall formed an angle, and took a southerly direction, which terminated in a postern near <hi rend=italics>Tower-hill.</hi> It was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="4">four</num> principal gates; the <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> road passed under it, so a gate must have existed on the site in the earliest times. It was also <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="7">seven</num> that had double doors, as was evident by the hinges, which existed in the time of <hi rend=italics>Stow.</hi> Mention <pb id="p.367" n="367"> is made of it in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Edgar,</hi> by the name of <hi rend=italics>Ealdgate.</hi> In the fierce wars between king <hi rend=italics>John</hi> and his barons, the latter entered the city through this gate, and committed great ravages among the houses of the religious. Their chieftains repaired, or rather rebuilt <hi rend=italics>Aldgate,</hi> after the <hi rend=italics>Norman</hi> manner; and made use of stone brought from <hi rend=italics>Caen,</hi> and a small brick called the <hi rend=italics>Elanders</hi> tile, which probably has been often mistaken for <hi rend=italics>Roman.</hi> This gate was of great strength, and had a deep well within.
<p>IN <datestruct value="1471--"><year reg="1471">1471</year></datestruct>, the <hi rend=italics>Bastard Falconbridge,</hi> at the head of <num value="5000">five thousand</num> riotous people, attacked the city on this side, won the gate, and forced in a few of the forces which defended it; but, the portcullis being let down, the assailants were all slain. The valiant alderman of the ward, and the recorder, then ordered it to be drawn up, and sallying forth, defeated the Bastard with great slaughter. In <datestruct value="1606--"><year reg="1606">1606</year></datestruct>, this gate was taken down, and rebuilt under the care of <hi rend=italics>Martin Bond,</hi> aforementioned: as a proof of its antiquity, I may mention that many <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> coins were found among the foundations.
<p>Immediately without the gate, is the church <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>St. Botolph's, Aldgate.</placename></NOTE> of <hi rend=italics>St. Botolph, Aldgate.</hi> It is <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="4">four</num> dedicated, in <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> to this favorite saint. In it is the vault of the <hi rend=italics>Darcies,</hi> of the north; and the tomb of <hi rend=italics>Thomas</hi> lord <hi rend=italics>Darcie,</hi> knight of the Garter; with his figure on it, representing him asleep, <pb id="p.368" n="368"> with a shroud wrapped round him; his face, breast, and arms naked. The figure is at present deformed by fresh painting, and the inscription rendered illegible. This nobleman, disliking the innovations in religious matters, took a secret part in the insurrection called the <hi rend=italics>Pilgrimage of Grace:</hi> and, in conjunction with the archbishop of <hi rend=italics>York,</hi> was supposed to have given up to <hi rend=italics>Aske,</hi> chief of the malecontents, the castle of <hi rend=italics>Pontefract,</hi> on very frivolous pretences.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Sir Nicholas Carew.</NOTE> HERE also was buried another victim to the unrelenting <hi rend=italics>Henry,</hi> Sir <hi rend=italics>Nicholas Carew,</hi> his master of the horse, and knight of the Garter.

<p>IN the c&oelig;metery of this church stood formerly <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Persian Tomb.</NOTE> the very remarkable tomb (in the altar form) of <hi rend=italics>Coya Shawsware,</hi> a merchant, and secretary to <hi rend=italics>Nogdi-beg,</hi> the <hi rend=italics>Persian</hi> embassador.

During a month after, the friends of the deceased visited the grave morning and evening, and made their orisons on the spot, till they were driven away by the rudeness of the <hi rend=italics>English</hi> mob.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>House of John Stow.</placename></NOTE> NEAR <hi rend=italics>Aldgate</hi> lived and died the able historian <hi rend=italics>John Stow.</hi> He relates a cruel execution on a gibbet, erected on the pavement before his house, on the bailiff of <hi rend=italics>Rumford,</hi> in the time of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> VI. In that age there were most barbarous and tyrannous punishments, by martial law, against all spreaders of rumors. The times were turbulent, but slighter penalties than death might have sufficed. The unhappy man, on the ladder, declared, in the presence of our historian, &ldquo;That he knew not for what offence he was brought to die, except for words by me spoken yesternight to Sir <hi rend=italics>Stephen,</hi> curate and preacher of this parish; which were these: He asked me, What news in the countrey?

And this was all, as God be my judge.&rdquo; Upon these words of the prisoner, Sir <hi rend=italics>Stephen,</hi> to &lsquo;avoide the reproach of the people, left the citie, and never was heard <pb id="p.371" n="371"> of since among them to my knowledge.&rsquo;&mdash;I shall have farther occasion to speak of Sir <hi rend=italics>Stephen,</hi> who was a fanatical firebrand of those days.
<p>ON the outside of the gate, begin the long street <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Whitechapel.</placename></NOTE> and suburb of <hi rend=italics>Whitechapel.</hi> The church stands very distant from the entrance into the street.

<p>IN the end of the reign of queen <hi rend=italics>Anne,</hi> this <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Libellous Picture.</placename></NOTE> church was prophaned by a most libellous and scandalous picture of the Last Supper, placed above the altar, by the then rector.

<p>IN this parish some of our nobility had formerly their villas, for the sake of country air.

<p>FROM <hi rend=italics>Aldgate</hi> the walls ran southward to the <hi rend=italics>Thames,</hi> and ended, as is generally supposed, with a fort; on the site of which arose the present TOWER of <hi rend=italics>London.</hi> To the north of it was a <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Postern Gate.</NOTE> postern, for the benefit of foot passengers: it was originally a fair and strong gate, built of stone brought out of <hi rend=italics>Kent,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Caen</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Normandy.</hi> It stood till the year <datestruct value="1440"><year reg="1440">1440</year></datestruct>, when it fell down; not, as is conjectured, from the pulling down of <num value="300">three hundred</num> feet of the adjacent wall in <datestruct value="1189--"><year reg="1189">1189</year></datestruct>, for the <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>The Tower of London.</placename></NOTE> purpose of enlarging and strengthening the Tower, but from decay; it being made at the same time with that fortress, which was built by the Conqueror in his <num value="1">first</num> year, and strongly garrisoned with <hi rend=italics>Normans,</hi> to secure the allegiance of his new and reluctant subjects.
<p>THE <num value="1">first</num> work seems to have been suddenly flung up in <datestruct value="1066--"><year reg="1066">1066</year></datestruct>, on his taking possession of the capital: this included in it a part of the antient wall; for, soon after the murder of Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Overbury,</hi> a dispute arose whether he was poisoned in the liberties of the city, or in the county of <hi rend=italics>Middlesex:</hi> on examination, part of the antient wall was discovered; and his apartment found to be to the west of it, and in consequence the criminals were tried within the jurisdiction of the city. Had it been on the other side, it would have been adjudged to have been within the county. An additional proof of this fortress having been built <pb id="p.383" n="383"> upon the remains of another more antient, occurred in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, when in digging on the south side of what is called <hi rend=italics>C&aelig;sar's</hi> chapel, were discovered some old foundations of stone, <num value="3">three</num> yards broad, so strongly cemented that it was with the utmost difficulty they were forced up.
<p>THE great square tower called the <hi rend=italics>White Tower,</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>White Tower.</placename></NOTE> and by the <hi rend=italics>Welsh, Twr Gwyn,</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Twry Bryn-gwyn,</hi> was erected in the year <datestruct value="1078"><year reg="1078">1078</year></datestruct>, when it arose under the directions of the great military architect <hi rend=italics>Gundulph,</hi> bishop of <hi rend=italics>Rochester;</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Guillelm.

The <pb id="p.384" n="384"> commander had the title of <hi rend=italics>Palatine</hi> bestowed on him, being, as was the case with several of the great men of that time, who had places of importance intrusted to their care, endowed with regal powers; such, for example, as the earl palatine, <hi rend=italics>Hugh Lupus,</hi> had in the county palatinate of <hi rend=italics>Chester.</hi><note>Lord <hi rend=italics>Lyttelton's Henry</hi> II. iii. <num value="139">139</num>.</NOTE>
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>St. John's Chapel.</placename></NOTE> WITHIN this tower is a very antient chapel, dedicated to <hi rend=italics>St. John,</hi> for the use of such of our kings and queens as wished to pay their devotion here, ever since the time of <hi rend=italics>William</hi> the Conqueror. It is of an oblong form, rounded at the east end: on each side are <num value="5">five</num> thick short round pillars, with vast squared capitals cut in different forms on their sides, with a cross on each: the arches are round, and all suit the architecture of its date. At the east end are <num value="2">two</num> pillars of the same form as the others. Above is a gallery, with windows with round arches, looking into the chapel. This gallery is said to have been allotted for the females. The columns pass down quite to the ground floor, through a lower apartment, which is now a magazine of gun-powder.<note>The gunpowder is removed, and the room appropriated to the reception of records.

<p>IN the south-east angle of the inclosure were the royal apartments, for the Tower was a palace <pb id="p.386" n="386"> during nearly <num value="500">five hundred</num> years, and only ceased to be so on the accession of queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth.</hi>

<p>HENRY VIII. on the death of his father, immediately retired to the Tower for some time for the sake of privacy, and to have leisure to form an administration, and here he continued several months.<note>Mr. <hi rend=italics>Pegge's Curialia,</hi> part iii. p. <num value="9">9</num>.</NOTE> He was attended by his yeomen of the guard. <num value="15">Fifteen</num> of these were left in the Tower, and their name changed to that of <hi rend=italics>Warders.</hi> These seem not to have been allowed the same distinction of dress as those who attend the royal person, till the following reign.

Here (in the upper floor of the <hi rend=italics>Bloody Tower</hi>) the sweet innocents <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> V. and his brother, duke of <hi rend=italics>York,</hi> perished, victims to the ambition of their remorseless uncle. And the empoisoning of Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Overbury</hi> makes up the sum of the known murders, the reproaches of our antient fortress. Here was a strait room or dungeon, called the <hi rend=italics>Little Ease,</hi> from the misery the unhappy occupier of so very confined a place endures. But this will appear a luxurious habitation, when compared with the inventions of the age of <hi rend=italics>Louis</hi> XI. of <hi rend=italics>France;</hi> with his iron cages, in which persons of rank lay for whole years; or his <hi rend=italics>Oubliettes,</hi> dungeons made in form of reversed cones, concealed with trap-doors, down which dropped the unhappy victims of the tyrant, brought there by <hi rend=italics>Tristan l&lsquo;Hermite,</hi> his companion and executioner in ordinary. Sometimes their sides were plain, sometimes set with knives, or sharp-edged wheels; but in either case, they were true <hi rend=italics>Oubliettes:</hi> the devoted were certain to fall into the land where all things were forgotten.
<p>THE tradition is, that <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VI. was murdered <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Wakefield Tower.</placename></NOTE> in the <hi rend=italics>Wakefield Tower,</hi> in a fine octagonal room, at present filled with papers belonging to the <hi rend=italics>Record Office,</hi> containing all the records from the Conquest to the year <datestruct value="1483"><year reg="1483">1483</year></datestruct>. The rest, to the <pb id="p.388" n="388"> present time, are kept in the <hi rend=italics>Rolls</hi> chapel. This Tower took its name from having been the place in which the prisoners, taken at the battle of <hi rend=italics>Wakefield,</hi> were confined.
<p>THE <hi rend=italics>Tower</hi> was <num value="1">first</num> inclosed by <hi rend=italics>William Longchamp,</hi> bishop of <hi rend=italics>Ely,</hi> and chancellor of <hi rend=italics>England,</hi> in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> I. This haughty prelate having a quarrel with <hi rend=italics>John,</hi> <num value="3">third</num> brother to <hi rend=italics>Richard,</hi> under pretence of guarding against his designs, surrounded the whole with walls embattled, and made on the outside a vast ditch, into which, in after times, the water from the <hi rend=italics>Thames</hi> was introduced. Different princes added other works. The present contents, within the walls, are <num value="12">twelve</num> acres and <num value="5">five</num> rods; the circuit, on the outside of the ditch, <num value="1052">one thousand and fifty-two</num> feet. It was again inclosed with a mud-wall by <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> III: this was placed at a distance from the ditch, and occasioned the taking down a part of the city wall; which was resented by the citizens; who, pulling down this precinct of mud, were punished by the king with a fine of a <measure value="1000bmark" type=currency><num value="1000">thousand</num> marks</measure>.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Beauchamp Tower.</placename></NOTE> THE <hi rend=italics>Beauchamp Tower</hi> is noted for the illustrious personages who have been confined within its walls. Among them is the ill-fated <hi rend=italics>Anna Bullen.</hi> It was from hence she wrote her celebrated letter to her pitiless tyrant, dated from her <pb id="p.389" n="389"> <hi rend=italics>doleful prison in the Tower.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Spectator,</hi> vol. vi. N<hi rend=sup>o</hi> <num value="397">397</num>.</NOTE> It is a composition that gives place to none in the true pathetic. From hence she was led to the block, placed on the green before this Tower, and received the fatal stroke with patience and resignation, on the <num value="19">19th</num> of <hi rend=italics>May</hi> <datestruct value="1536--"><year reg="1536">1536</year></datestruct>.
<p>AN innocent usurpress succeeded to her apartments in <datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>. Here the amiable, the learned, the good <hi rend=italics>Jane Gray</hi> was confined (for the faults of an ambitious father-in-law) and remained a prisoner <num value="5">five</num> months. She seems to have been pitied even by <hi rend=italics>Mary.</hi> She probably would not have suffered, but for the imprudent insurrection of her weak father, the duke of <hi rend=italics>Suffolk.</hi> She was the most accomplished lady of her time; was mistress of the <hi rend=italics>Greek</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Latin</hi> tongues; versed in <hi rend=italics>Hebrew, Chaldee, Arabic, French,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Italian;</hi> was skilled in music; and the toilets worked with her own hand, preserved at <hi rend=italics>Zurich</hi> with great reverence, prove the excellence of her needlework. Her letters to <hi rend=italics>Bullinger,</hi> most exquisitely written, I have seen in the library in that city. She fell, at the age of <num value="17">seventeen</num>, on the same spot as <hi rend=italics>Anna Bullen</hi> did, on <hi rend=italics>January</hi> the <num value="12">12th</num>, <datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>-<num value="4">4</num>, and with most invincible fortitude: as she was conducted to the block (whether by accident or whether by design) she met the headless body of <pb id="p.390" n="390"> her beloved husband, beheaded just before on <hi rend=italics>Tower-hill.</hi> A line in <hi rend=italics>Greek,</hi> to the following purport, was her consolation: &ldquo;That if his lifeless body should give testimony against her before men, his most blessed spirit should give an eternal witness of her innocence in the presence of GOD!&rdquo;
<p>A LITTLE farther on I shall give an account of another illustrious prisoner, <hi rend=italics>Philip</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Arundel,</hi> who died a natural death within this Tower. I may here add, that it seems to have been a common prison for others of less note, as appears by the numerous inscriptions cut on the walls, or on the wainscot. I observed on the staircase a shield of arms with a pomegranate in chief, and an escutcheon of pretence with <num value="3">three</num> pears? and on the outside, near to it, the letters P. E. A. And in another place a shield with a heart in the middle, with <num value="3">three</num> mullets, <num value="2">two</num>, <num value="1">one</num>. These I refer to the learned in heraldry to explain.
<p>IN the lieutenant's lodging is to be seen a large piece of stone or marble, with <num value="5">five</num> circular tablets on the face, memorials of the Gunpowder plot. It was erected in <datestruct value="1607--"><year reg="1607">1607</year></datestruct>, by Sir <hi rend=italics>William Wade,</hi> lieutenant of the <hi rend=italics>Tower.</hi> The middle compartment, which is the largest, gives an account of the conspiracy. On a smaller are the names of the conspirators. On another, the names of the counsellors who sat in this room to examine <pb id="p.391" n="391"> those miscreants. Above are the arms of the counsellors. In this room is a bust, said to be that of <hi rend=italics>James</hi> I. but so animated, that I should have supposed it to have been that of the gallant <hi rend=italics>Raleigh.</hi> I hope that some antiquary will copy, and favor the public with the inscriptions.<note>An interior view of the room, with several plates containing the inscriptions, are given in the <num value="13">13th</num> volume of the <hi rend=italics>Archaeologia.</hi> ED.</NOTE>
<p>EDWARD IV. built the Lions Tower: it was <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Lions Tower.</placename></NOTE> originally called the Bulwark; but received the former name from its use. A menagery had very <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Royal Menagery.</placename></NOTE> long been a piece of regal state; <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> I. had his at his manor of <hi rend=italics>Woodstock,</hi> where he kept lions, leopards, lynxes, porcupines, and several other uncommon beasts. They were afterwards removed to the <hi rend=italics>Tower. Edward</hi> II. commanded the sheriffs of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> to pay the keepers of the king's leopards <measure value="6d." type=currency><num value="6">six</num> pence</measure> a day, for the sustenance of the leopards; and <num value="3">three</num> half-pence a day for the diet of the keeper, out of the fee-farm of the city. I should have mentioned before, that <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> issued his order to the sheriffs, to supply <measure value="4d." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> pence</measure> a day for the maintenance of his white bear (<hi rend=italics>urso nostro albo</hi>), and his keeper in the <hi rend=italics>Tower</hi> of <hi rend=italics>London.</hi> They were also to provide a muzzle, and an iron chain to hold the said bear out of the water; and a long cord to hold it during the time it was fishing in the <hi rend=italics>Thames:</hi> they were besides ordered <pb id="p.392" n="392"> to build a small house in the <hi rend=italics>Tower</hi> for the king's elephant (<hi rend=italics>elefantem nostrum</hi>) and to make provision both for beast and keeper.<note><hi rend=italics>Madox</hi> Antiq.

<p>THE royal menagery is to this day exceedingly well supplied. In <hi rend=italics>April</hi> <datestruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></datestruct>, there was a singular variety of leopard, brought from <hi rend=italics>Bengal.</hi> It was wholly black, but the hair was marked, on the back, sides, and neck, with round clusters of small spots, of a glossy and the most intense black; the tail hung several inches beyond the length of the legs, and was very full of hair.<note>Engraved and described by <hi rend=italics>M. de la Metherie,</hi> dans le Journal de Physique, <hi rend=italics>Juillet,</hi> <datestruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct>, p. <num value="45">45</num>. tab. ii. and also by Mr. <hi rend=italics>Pennant</hi> in his History of Quadrupeds, i. <num value="283">283</num>. tab. lv.

<p>THE office of the keeper of the menagery was added to that of constable of the <hi rend=italics>Tower,</hi> for the sake of the emolument. In the reign of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VII. <hi rend=italics>John de Vere,</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Oxford,</hi> was constable, and was appointed keeper of the lions, with the salary of <measure value="12d." type=currency><num value="12">twelve</num> pence</measure> per diem, and <measure value="6d." type=currency><num value="6">six</num> pence</measure> for each beast.<note><hi rend=italics>Rymer,</hi> xii. <num value="276">276</num>.</NOTE> <pb id="p.393" n="393">
<p>THE little book sold in the <hi rend=italics>Tower,</hi> will give a very satisfactory account of all its curiosities, natural and artificial. To that I refer my reader. I will only say, that the room in which the artillery is kept, and the armory of small arms above (each <num value="340">three hundred and forty</num> feet <num value="5">five</num> inches long) do great honor to our kingdom. They are now in the most admirable order; and I am told by my son, who hath visited the most boasted in <hi rend=italics>Europe,</hi> that these far exceed any he saw. They well merit the attention of our countrymen. I must also direct their attention to the fine sculpture in stone, of the royal arms surrounded by suitable trophies, on the pediment in front of the building, the work of our great artist <hi rend=italics>Gibbons.</hi>

<p>FOR a considerable time, there was a dispute <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Towerhill.</placename></NOTE> between the crown and the city, about the right to the <hi rend=italics>Tower-hill</hi> (the <hi rend=italics>Gwynfryn</hi> of the <hi rend=italics>Welsh</hi>). In the reign of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> IV. the king's officers erected there a gallows, and a scaffold for the execution of offenders. The citizens complained; <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> immediately disavowed the act, by public proclamation, and resigned to them the monopoly of the ax and the halter, and vested in them the exclusive privilege of hanging, drawing, and quartering. From that time the fatal <hi rend=italics>apparatus</hi> has always been provided by the city. The condemned are delivered to the sheriffs by the lieutenant, who receives from the former a receipt for their delivery; <pb id="p.394" n="394"> the sheriffs then see execution done, as in other places.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>The <num value="1">First</num> Person Beheaded on Towerhill.</NOTE> THE <num value="1">first</num> whom I recollect to have suffered here by the more honorable death of the ax, was Sir <hi rend=italics>Simon de Burley,</hi> knight of the Garter, tutor of <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> II. and the most accomplished man of his time, who, in <datestruct value="1388--"><year reg="1388">1388</year></datestruct>, fell a victim to the malice of the potent faction, which had usurped the regal authority. Queen <hi rend=italics>Anne,</hi> the good queen <hi rend=italics>Anne,</hi> went on her knees to the duke of <hi rend=italics>Glocester,</hi> the king's uncle, to implore mercy; and continued in that attitude <num value="3">three</num> hours before the inexorable tyrant.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>The Former Rough Treatment of Prisoners.</NOTE> THERE was, during a very long period, a barbarous meanness, a species of insult to the unhappy criminals, which is in our days happily changed into every species of tenderness and humanity, consistent with public justice and security. In revenge for the death of Sir <hi rend=italics>Simon,</hi> and many others who suffered in the same cause, the great earl of <hi rend=italics>Arundel, Richard Fitzalan,</hi> was hurried instantly from the place of trial, the palace at <hi rend=italics>Westminster,</hi> to <hi rend=italics>Tower-hill:</hi> his arms and his hands were bound; and the king glutted his eyes with the bloody scene. That great peer <hi rend=italics>Thomas</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>Norfolk,</hi> who was confined here in the last year of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. was reduced to beg for sheets. He was to have lost his head, but was saved by the death of the tyrant on the very day <pb id="p.395" n="395"> appointed for his execution. It is said, that it was intended that the king's death should have been concealed till the execution had taken place: but that when the officer of the <hi rend=italics>Tower</hi> waited on his grace to prepare him for execution, by a fortunate guess, the duke told him, the king was dead! He was kept in custody during the next short reign, but was released on the accession of queen <hi rend=italics>Mary.</hi> He mounted his horse, on the verge of fourscore, to assist in quelling the insurrection of Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Wyat,</hi> in <datestruct value="1554--"><year reg="1554">1554</year></datestruct>. This served to fill the <hi rend=italics>Tower</hi> with new subjects for the mean insults of the times. Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas,</hi> and the rest of the prisoners, were brought into the <hi rend=italics>Tower</hi> through the <hi rend=italics>Traitors-gate.</hi> The lieutenant received them, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, with insults and gross abuse. When Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas</hi> appeared, gallantly dressed, the lieutenant actually collared him: Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas</hi> gave him a fierce and reproachful look, bravely telling him, <hi rend=italics>This is no masterie now!</hi>

<p><num value="1">ONE</num> person of rank suffered here by the more <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Sir Gervis Elwayes.</NOTE> infamous death of the halter.

There is something very peculiar in his admonition to the spectators, against appealing to Heaven by a rash <pb id="p.396" n="396"> vow; for, having been greatly addicted to gaming, he had said seriously in his prayers, <hi rend=italics>Lord, let me be hanged if ever I play more:</hi> and yet he broke it a <num value="1000">thousand</num> times.<note>See the whole in The <num value="1">first</num> xiv Years of King <hi rend=italics>James's</hi> Reign, p. <num value="150">150</num>.</NOTE> Of what utility would be a sensible collection of these proofs of the FINGER OF GOD, exemplified to mankind in the detection and punishment of every species of crime!

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Executed Persons Buried there.</NOTE> TO the present church, after his execution, was finally removed the body of the conscientious <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Fisher, Bishop of Rochester.</NOTE> amiable prelate <hi rend=italics>Fisher,</hi> bishop of <hi rend=italics>Rochester;</hi> a <pb id="p.397" n="397"> victim to his opinion of the pope's supremacy, and the treachery of the attorney-general <hi rend=italics>Bich,</hi> who, under pretence of consulting him, obtained his confidence, and betrayed him. The pope rewarded his orthodoxy with a cardinal's hat, but it did not arrive till the poor bishop's head was on a pole on <hi rend=italics>London-bridge.</hi> His headless corse was removed, to be near that of his friend, who suffered about <num value="3">three</num> weeks after, in the same cause, the great Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas More.</hi> But his body <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Sir Thomas More.</NOTE> did not long keep company with that of his brother sufferer, nor his head on the bridge. His affectionate daughter, <hi rend=italics>Margaret Roper,</hi> procured the <num value="1">one</num> to be removed to <hi rend=italics>Chelsea;</hi> and the head, accidentally blown into the <hi rend=italics>Thames,</hi> to be given to her. She kept it during life as a relique, and directed that after her death it should be lodged in her arms and buried with her.
<p>HERE rest the beauteous <hi rend=italics>Anna Bullen,</hi> and the <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Anna Bullen.</NOTE> protligate <hi rend=italics>Catherine Howard;</hi> the former suffered, <hi rend=italics>May</hi> <num value="19">19th</num>, <datestruct value="1536--"><year reg="1536">1536</year></datestruct>, under a fictitious charge of adultery, made by a tyrant lusting for a new object, and the latter on a full conviction of the same crime. <hi rend=italics>George</hi> lord <hi rend=italics>Rochford,</hi> the innocent brother of the former, involved in the accusation, preceded her to the grave by <num value="2">two</num> days; as his infamous wife, a cause of their death, accompanied, unpitied, her mistress <hi rend=italics>Catherine Howard,</hi> in execution and in sepulchre. It is impossible not to <pb id="p.398" n="398"> moralize on comparing the manner in which she was brought prisoner to this fatal fortress, with the gay and splendid pageantry, which attended her and her savage spouse from <hi rend=italics>Greenwich</hi> by water to the same place, on <hi rend=italics>May</hi> <num value="29">29th</num>, <datestruct value="1533--"><year reg="1533">1533</year></datestruct>; and from the <hi rend=italics>Tower,</hi> <num value="2">two</num> days after, with still greater magnificence, to her coronation.<note>See a very curious account of the processions in the <hi rend=italics>Antiquarian Repertory,</hi> iii. <num value="202">202</num>.</NOTE> She rejoiced too publicly on the death of <hi rend=italics>Catherine</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Arragon,</hi> whose place she most wrongfully usurped: in less than <num value="5">five</num> months, she herself fell as a criminal.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Margaret Countess of Salisbury.</NOTE> As I cannot discover the place of interment of the venerable <hi rend=italics>Margaret</hi> countess of <hi rend=italics>Salisbury,</hi> beheaded on the green within the <hi rend=italics>Tower,</hi> on <hi rend=italics>May</hi>
<num value="27">27th</num>, <datestruct value="1541--"><year reg="1541">1541</year></datestruct>, I must suppose that it was within the chapel. There is no reason to imagine that the tyrant would pay more respect to her remains, than to those of his royal consorts. This illustrious woman was daughter to <hi rend=italics>George</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>Clarence,</hi> and last of the royal line of <hi rend=italics>Plantagenet.</hi> That seems to have been her only crime, except that of being mother to cardinal <hi rend=italics>Pole,</hi> to whom <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> bore the most inveterate hatred. She was attainted, by a servile parlement, in <datestruct value="1539--"><year reg="1539">1539</year></datestruct>, upon no other proof than that of a banner being found with the <num value="5">five</num> wounds of CHRIST embroidered on it. This being the symbol chosen by <pb id="p.399" n="399"> the northern rebels, was thought sufficient to establish her guilt. The king, on a trifling insurrection, in which it was impossible she could have any concern, ordered her to be put to death. The executioner directed her to lay her head on the block, which she refused to do, telling him, that she knew of no guilt, and would not submit to die like a traitor. He pursued her about the scaffold, aiming at her hoary head, and at length took it off, after mangling the poor victim, of <num value="70">seventy</num> years of age, in the most barbarous manner.
<p>THAT meteor <hi rend=italics>Thomas Cromwel,</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Essex,</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Thomas Cromwel, Earl of Essex.</NOTE> the great promoter of the suppression of religious houses, experienced the common lot of the preceeding. He suffered, among other charges, for being a favorer of heretics; yet died in the firm profession of the Catholic religion.
<p>THE turbulent <hi rend=italics>Thomas Seymour,</hi> baron <hi rend=italics>Sudley,</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Thomas Seymour, Baron Sudley.</NOTE> and lord high admiral, was beheaded in <datestruct value="1549--"><year reg="1549">1549</year></datestruct>, and buried in this church, by a warrant from his own brother, the protector <hi rend=italics>Somerset.</hi> On <hi rend=italics>January</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Protector Somerset.</NOTE> <num value="24">24th</num>, <datestruct value="1552--"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct>, the protector himself mounted the same scaffold, and, notwithstanding his high rank, was flung into the same grave among the attainted herd. His ambitious rival, the instrument of his death, <hi rend=italics>John Dudley,</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>Northumberland,</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG>John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland.</NOTE> lost his head, and was laid by his side, <pb id="p.400" n="400"> on the <num value="22">22</num>d of <hi rend=italics>August,</hi> <datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex.</NOTE> THE favorite carl of <hi rend=italics>Essex, Robert Devereux,</hi> was reluctantly given to the block by his fond mistress, after a long struggle between fear and affection. Mr. <hi rend=italics>Walpole</hi> observes, that it was a fashion to treat the passion of that illustrious princess as a romance. She, it is alleged, was <num value="68">sixty-eight</num>, but it was forgotten that the earl was only <num value="34">thirty-four</num>. Let their ages have been reversed, you would never have heard of the unhappy love of <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth. Essex,</hi> impressed with a strong sense of religion, died a true penitent. When marshal <hi rend=italics>Biron</hi> heard of his end, he said he died more like a priest than a soldier. <hi rend=italics>Biron,</hi> in the same sad circumstances, ended his days like a frantic coward.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Duke of Monmouth.</NOTE> BENEATH the communion table reposes the handsome, restless, ungrateful son of <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> II. the duke of <hi rend=italics>Monmouth.</hi> His ambition, like that of many of those he followed to this place, occasioned his death. He is said to have died calmly; and to have acknowledged the guilt of rebellion: but love preserved her influence to the last moment. He was married very young, and for interested motives. He had made a connection of the most tender nature with lady <hi rend=italics>Harriet Wentworth,</hi> who lived with him as his wife. He <pb id="p.401" n="401"> could not, with all the arguments of our best divines, be convinced of the sin of adultery; he called her the choice of his ripened years. I have been told a tradition, that lady <hi rend=italics>Harriet</hi> had placed herself in a window, to take a last and farewel look; he was master enough of himself to make her a graceful bow. With more certainty can I say, that the king, on the evening of the execution, visited the widowed dutchess, to give assurance of his attention to her and her children. Consolation she did not want, for she had been separated from him; and when, at the duke's earnest request, she had an interview with him in the <hi rend=italics>Tower,</hi> their interview was, as <hi rend=italics>Barillon</hi> expresses it, <hi rend=italics>aigre de part et d&lsquo;autre.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Dalrymple's</hi> Memoirs, ii. <num value="168">168</num>.</NOTE>

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Talbot Edwards, Keeper of the King's Regalia.</NOTE> I PASS over less interesting monuments, to the little stone on the floor, which records, that &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Talbot Edwards,</hi> late keeper of his majesty's regalia, <num value="30">30th</num> <hi rend=italics>September,</hi> <datestruct value="1674--"><year reg="1674">1674</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="80">80</num>,&rdquo; was deposited here. Was it not a shameless reign, in which no farther remembrance of this good and faithful servant was delivered to posterity? This venerable man was keeper of the <hi rend=italics>regalia,</hi> when the ruffian <hi rend=italics>Blood</hi> made the notorious attempt on the crown, <pb id="p.403" n="403"> and other ornaments of majesty. Never was a more determined villain: &ldquo;with a head to contrive, and heart to execute any wickedness.&rdquo; <hi rend=italics>Blood</hi> contrived, under the guise of a clergyman, to make acquaintance with Mr. <hi rend=italics>Edwards;</hi> insinuated himself into his favor and confidence. After various visits, with the assistance of several other associates, he seized on the old man, whom he had requested to shew the jewels to his friends, gagged him, and on his resisting, struck him on the head with a mallet, and gave him several stabs. <hi rend=italics>Edwards</hi> thought it prudent to counterfeit death. <hi rend=italics>Blood</hi> put the crown under his parson's gown: another put the globe in his breeches: a <num value="3">third</num>, not being able to conceal the sceptre by reason of its length, broke off the rich ruby and put it in his pocket. As soon as they were gone, <hi rend=italics>Edwards</hi> forced out the gag, and gave the alarm; they were instantly pursued, and <num value="3">three</num> of them soon taken. <hi rend=italics>Blood</hi> struggled hard for his prize, saying, when it was wrested from him, <hi rend=italics>It was a gallant attempt, though unsuccessful; it was for a</hi> CROWN.
<p>THE curiosity of the king was excited to see a man engaged in so many important villanies: under pretence of obtaining discoveries, his majesty made the wretch a visit; from that moment the artful <hi rend=italics>Blood</hi> dated his security: he told the king so many plausible tales; such indifference he <pb id="p.404" n="404"> shewed for his own life, such anxiety for that of his majesty (for he insinuated that his comrades would certainly revenge his death, even on his sacred majesty) that in a short time he obtained his pardon. It was necessary to apply to the duke of <hi rend=italics>Ormond</hi> for permission, the ruffian having made the attempt on his grace's life not long before. The duke nobly answered, &ldquo;If his majesty could forgive him stealing the crown, he might easily forgive the attempt upon his life; and if such was his majesty's pleasure, that was a sufficient reason for him, and his lordship (the earl of <hi rend=italics>Arlington,</hi> who brought the message) might spare the rest.&rdquo; <hi rend=italics>Blood</hi> was not only pardoned, but received into favor, had a pension of <num value="500">five hundred</num> a year, and was perpetually seen at court, enjoying the smiles of majesty, and even successfully employing his interest, as a most respectable patron. But all good men looked on him with horror, and considered him as a <hi rend=italics>Sicarius</hi> to a profligate set of men, to overawe any who had integrity enough to resist the measures of a most profligate court. This miscreant died peacefully in his bed, <hi rend=italics>August</hi> <num value="29">29th</num>, <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>, fearlessly, and without any signs of penitence; totally hardened and forsaken by Heaven.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Arthur Earl of Essex.</NOTE> ARTHUR earl of <hi rend=italics>Essex,</hi> accomplice with lord <hi rend=italics>Russel,</hi> ended here his days. Despair seized him on his confinement, and, forsaken by Heaven, he put an end to his existence by the razor. He was of a party charged with equal freedom in religious as political principles. He vindicated and practised suicide. His death was charged on the court, but without the lest grounds. The prince <pb id="p.411" n="411"> who could bring lord <hi rend=italics>Russel</hi> to the block by a legal course, need never have incurred the odium of assassination on a less important partner of the conspiracy.
<p>HERE died, in <hi rend=italics>September,</hi> <datestruct value="1592--"><year reg="1592">1592</year></datestruct>, Sir <hi rend=italics>John Perrot,</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Sir John Perrot.</NOTE> the supposed son of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. by <hi rend=italics>Mary</hi> wife to <hi rend=italics>Thomas Perrot,</hi> esq; of <hi rend=italics>Haroldstone,</hi> in the county of <hi rend=italics>Pembroke.</hi> In his great stature, and high spirit, he bore a strong resemblance to that monarch. Young <hi rend=italics>Perrot</hi> <num value="1">first</num> attracted his notice by a quarrel which he had with <num value="2">two</num> yeomen of the guard, whom he foiled at the <hi rend=italics>stews</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Southwark.</hi> He was in high favor in the following reign; but in that of <hi rend=italics>Mary</hi> he fell into disgrace, on account of his attachment to the reformed religion. When queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth</hi> succeeded, he experienced the smiles of his sovereign and sister. At length he was constituted lord deputy of <hi rend=italics>Ireland,</hi> where he became very unpopular, by reason of his haughty conduct; was recalled, unjustly accused, and condemned for treason. <hi rend=italics>Naunton,</hi> in his <hi rend=italics>Fragmenta Regalia,</hi><note>P. <num value="25">25</num>.</NOTE> probably gives the real cause of the queen's resentment, which was excited by a very gross thing which he had said of his royal mistress. His sentence was respited; but he died of a broken heart, unable, from his <pb id="p.412" n="412"> lofty spirit, to brook the ill-treatment he met with from <num value="1">one</num> he thought so near an ally.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Lady arabella Stuart.</NOTE> IN this prison also sunk a victim to unmerited misfortunes, the innocent <hi rend=italics>Arabella Stuart,</hi> daughter of <hi rend=italics>Charles Stuart,</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Lenox,</hi> and younger brother to lord <hi rend=italics>Darnley,</hi> father to <hi rend=italics>James</hi> I. Her affinity to the crown brought her under the jealousy of both <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth,</hi> and that monarch. <num value="1">One</num> object of the conspiracy in <datestruct value="1603--"><year reg="1603">1603</year></datestruct>, for which lord <hi rend=italics>Cobham,</hi> Sir <hi rend=italics>Walter Raleigh,</hi> and others, were condemned, was supposed to be that of placing the crown on the head of this unfortunate lady; on which she was confined to her own house. She found means to be married privately to Sir <hi rend=italics>William Seymour,</hi> <num value="2">second</num> son of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> lord <hi rend=italics>Beauchamp,</hi> son of the earl of <hi rend=italics>Hertford.</hi> On the discovery of the wedding, he was committed to the <hi rend=italics>Tower:</hi> she to close custody at the house of Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Parry,</hi> at <hi rend=italics>Lambeth.</hi> They artfully contrived their escape on the same day: <hi rend=italics>June</hi> <num value="3">3</num>d, <datestruct value="1611--"><year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct>: he arrived safe at <hi rend=italics>Dunkirk;</hi> the lady was taken in <hi rend=italics>Calais</hi> road, and committed to the <hi rend=italics>Tower,</hi> where her misfortunes deprived her of her senses.<note>Illustrations of <hi rend=italics>British</hi> History, by <hi rend=italics>Edmund Lodge,</hi> esq. iii. <num value="178">178</num>.</NOTE> She was released by death, <hi rend=italics>September</hi> <num value="27">27th</num>, <datestruct value="1615--"><year reg="1615">1615</year></datestruct>; and found an honorable interment in <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VII th&lsquo;s chapel, near the remains of her ill-fated relation <pb id="p.413" n="413"> <hi rend=italics>Mary</hi> queen of <hi rend=italics>Scots.</hi> Her husband lived to succeed to the title of Duke of <hi rend=italics>Somerset;</hi> and was the faithful servant and friend of <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> I.
<p>I SHALL mention <num value="2">two</num> other noblemen who were <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Henry, <num value="9">Ninth</num> Earl of Northumberland, and His Wizards.</NOTE> confined within these walls, on account of some particularities which attended their durance. The <num value="1">first</num> is <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Northumberland,</hi> imprisoned on the very just suspicion of being privy to the Gunpowder treason. During the time he was in custody, he amused himself most rationally in the company of learned men, who were permitted to have access to him. Among others, were <num value="3">three</num> who were called his <hi rend=italics>Wizards:</hi> possibly he might be fond of astronomy, or dabble in judicial astrology; circumstances that, with the vulgar, might easily fasten on him the imputation of dealing with the devil.
<p>A VERY remarkable accident befel <hi rend=italics>Henry Wriothesly,</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Earl of Southampton, and His Cat.</NOTE> earl of <hi rend=italics>Southampton,</hi> the friend and companion of the earl of <hi rend=italics>Essex,</hi> in his fatal insurrection: after he had been confined here a short time, he was surprized by a visit from his favorite cat, which had found its way to the <hi rend=italics>Tower;</hi> and, as tradition says, reached its master by descending the chimney of his apartment. I have seen at <hi rend=italics>Bulstrode,</hi> the summer residence of the late dutchess of <hi rend=italics>Portland,</hi> an original portrait of this earl, in the place of his confinement, in a black dress and <pb id="p.414" n="414"> cloak, with the faithful animal sitting by him.<note>In the same collection is another portrait of the same nobleman, out of confinement, richly dressed, with a rich helmet and armour lying by him.</NOTE> Perhaps this picture might have been the foundation of the tale.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Lord Chancellor Jeffries.</NOTE> THE fallen lord chancellor, the cruel instrument of despotism under <hi rend=italics>James</hi> II. died, imprisoned here, of a broken heart, aided by intemperance. He was <num value="1">first</num> interred in the church belonging to the <hi rend=italics>Tower;</hi> and afterward was removed to that of <hi rend=italics>St. Mary, Aldermanbury,</hi> and deposited near the body of his rakish son, lord <hi rend=italics>Wem.</hi> In my younger days, I have heard of a hard-hearted insult on this once great man, during his imprisonment. He received, as he thought, a present of <hi rend=italics>Colchester</hi> oysters; and expressed great satisfaction at the thought of having some friend yet left: but, on taking off the top of the barrel, instead of the usual contents, appeared an halter!
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Gryffydd, Father of Our Last Prince Llewelyn.</NOTE> To conclude this melancholy list, I shall return to antient times, to lament the sad fate of my countrymen, victims to <hi rend=italics>English</hi> ambition. Here was basely confined, by <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> III. my countryman <hi rend=italics>Gryffydd,</hi> father of our last prince <hi rend=italics>Llewelyn ap Gryffydd;</hi> who, impatient of imprisonment, attempted to escape by lowering himself from the walls: the line he was descending by broke, and, <pb id="p.415" n="415"> being of a great bulk, he was dashed to pieces, and perished in a most miserable manner.<note><hi rend=italics>Powel's</hi> History of <hi rend=italics>Wales,</hi> <num value="307">307</num>.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Wynne's</hi> History, <num value="263">263</num>.</NOTE>
<p>IT is supposed that many of the <hi rend=italics>Welsh</hi> nobility, <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Welsh Manuscripts Destroyed in the Tower.</NOTE> imprisoned within this fortress, had obtained leave that part of their libraries might be sent to them, for their amusement in their solitary hours: so that in time it became a repository of <hi rend=italics>Welsh</hi> literature. These valuable manuscripts were at length burnt by the villainy of <num value="1">one</num> <hi rend=italics>Scolan,</hi> to the irreparable loss of our history and our poetry. <hi rend=italics>Gutto'r Glynn,</hi> who wrote about the year <datestruct value="1450"><year reg="1450">1450</year></datestruct>, thus relates the fact:

<p>DAFYDD LHWYD AP LLEWELYN <hi rend=italics>o Vathavarn,</hi> a poet, who flourished in <datestruct value="1480--"><year reg="1480">1480</year></datestruct>, gives our countryman <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Owen Tudor.</NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Owen Tudor,</hi> grandfather to <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VII. a nobler prison than I fear we can warrant from history.<note>See <hi rend=italics>Rymer's F&oelig;d.</hi> x. <num value="685">685</num>, <num value="709">709</num>.</NOTE> He certainly thought it derogating from the honor of <hi rend=italics>Wales,</hi> to send his hero to <hi rend=italics>Newgate</hi> like a common felon.

<p>IN the reign of <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> III. Sir <hi rend=italics>William Gryffydd,</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Penrhyn,</hi> chamberlain of <hi rend=italics>North Wales,</hi> suffered imprisonment in the <hi rend=italics>Tower,</hi> at the same time with lord <hi rend=italics>Strange,</hi> for their supposed attachment to the interests of the duke of <hi rend=italics>Richmond,</hi> afterward <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VII. Sir <hi rend=italics>William</hi> had also his poetical friend, in <hi rend=italics>Howel ap Reinalt,</hi> who, in a <hi rend=italics>Cywydd,</hi> celebrates the confinement of his patron.
<p>A LITTLE to the south of <hi rend=italics>East Smithfield,</hi> is the hospital of <hi rend=italics>St. Catherine's,</hi> originally founded <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>St. Catherine's Hospital.</placename></NOTE> in <datestruct value="1148--"><year reg="1148">1148</year></datestruct>, by <hi rend=italics>Matilda</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Boulogne,</hi> wife of king <pb id="p.418" n="418"> <hi rend=italics>Stephen,</hi> for the repose of her son <hi rend=italics>Baldwin,</hi> and her daughter <hi rend=italics>Matilda:</hi> and for the maintenance of a master, brothers and sisters, and other poor persons. In <datestruct value="1273--"><year reg="1273">1273</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>Eleanor,</hi> widow of <hi rend=italics>Henry,</hi> possessed herself of it, dissolved the old foundation, re-founded it in honor of the same saint, for a master, <num value="3">three</num> brethren chaplains, <num value="3">three</num> sisters, <num value="10">ten</num> <hi rend=italics>Bedes</hi> women, and <num value="6">six</num> poor scholars. Queen <hi rend=italics>Philippa,</hi> wife of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> III. was a great benefactress to this hospital: and to this day it remains under queenly patronage, according to the reservation made by the pious re-foundress <hi rend=italics>Eleanor.</hi> Our present gracious queen is the <num value="29">twenty-ninth</num> royal patroness.
<p>THE mastership is a sinecure of considerable value. In this hospital is a house for him, and all its members. The reader will find the disposition of them, in the plan printed by Mr. <hi rend=italics>Nichols,</hi> in the account of <hi rend=italics>St. Katherine's</hi> hospital, and its collegiate church; a work of that able antiquary the late <hi rend=italics>Andrew Coltee Ducarel,</hi> LL. D. He was interred in the collegiate church, where a plain piece of marble informs us of little more than the period of his existence.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Church.</NOTE> THE church is a handsome <hi rend=italics>gothic</hi> building, but nearly lost in the various houses, which shut it from public view. The east window is very elegant; and in the modern improvements, the utmost propriety is preserved in the imitation of the antient <pb id="p.419" n="419"> architecture. The wooden pulpit is a curiosity: on its <num value="8">eight</num> sides are represented the antient building, and different gates of the hospital; beneath each compartment extend, EZRA THE SCRIBE&mdash;STOOD UPON A&mdash;PULPIT OF WOOD&mdash; WHICH HE HAD&mdash;MADE FOR THE&mdash;PREACHIN <hi rend=italics>Neh&mdash;e.</hi> chap. viii. <num value="4">4</num>.
<p>UNDER <num value="1">one</num> of the stalls is a very good carving of the head of queen <hi rend=italics>Philippa,</hi> and another of her spouse. They bear a resemblance to the monumental sculpture of those great personages.
<p>THE most remarkable monument is that of <hi rend=italics>John</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Tomb of John Holland, Duke of Exeter.</placename></NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Holland,</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>Exeter,</hi> who is represented recumbent, with a fillet round his head, and in a long gown, the weeds of peace.<note><hi rend=italics>Milton's L&lsquo;Allegro.</hi></NOTE> By him are placed the figure of his <num value="1">first</num> wife <hi rend=italics>Anne,</hi> daughter of <hi rend=italics>Edmund</hi> earl <hi rend=italics>Stafford,</hi> and widow of <hi rend=italics>Edmund Mortimer,</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>March;</hi> and another of his sister <hi rend=italics>Constance,</hi> <num value="1">first</num>, wife to <hi rend=italics>Thomas Mowbray,</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>Norfolk;</hi> and afterward to Sir <hi rend=italics>John Grey,</hi> eldest son of <hi rend=italics>Reginald</hi> lord <hi rend=italics>Grey,</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Ruthe&nacute;. Ashmole</hi> says, that she was represented, on the tomb, with the Garter round her left arm, a mark of distinction on only <num value="2">two</num> other monuments: but time hath obliterated this badge of honor. This potent peer was a great benefactor to the hospital, founded in it a chauntry; and bequeathed to the <pb id="p.420" n="420"> high altar in the church, &ldquo;a cuppe of byroll, garnished with gold, perles, and precious stones, to be put in the sacrament,&rdquo; and a number of other valuable effects. He died in peace in <datestruct value="1447--"><year reg="1447">1447</year></datestruct>, a wonderful thing in his family; not fewer than <num value="4">four</num> of this great house, in little more than a century, having fallen by violent deaths.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>The Bere-house.</placename></NOTE> BELOW <hi rend=italics>St. Catherine's,</hi> on the river side, stood the great breweries or <hi rend=italics>Bere-house,</hi> as it is called in the map published in the <num value="1">first</num> volume of the <hi rend=italics>Civitates Orbis.</hi> They were subject to regulations as early as the reign of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VII.; who, in <datestruct value="1492--"><year reg="1492">1492</year></datestruct>, licenses <hi rend=italics>John Merchant,</hi> a <hi rend=italics>Fleming,</hi> to export <num value="50">fifty</num> tons of ale called <hi rend=italics>Berre.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Rymer,</hi> xii. <num value="271">271</num>.</NOTE> And in the same reign <num value="1">one</num> <hi rend=italics>Geffry Gate,</hi> probably an officer of the king's, spoiled the brewhouses at <hi rend=italics>St. Catherine's</hi> twice, either for sending too much abroad unlicensed, or for brewing it too weak for their home customers.<note><hi rend=italics>Maitland,</hi> ii. <datestruct value="1017--"><year reg="1017">1017</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> The demand for this article from foreign parts increased to a high degree; in the reign of queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth,</hi> <num value="500">five hundred</num> tons were exported at once, as is expressed for the queen's use, at <num value="1">one</num> time; probably for the service of her army in the Low Countries; <num value="350">three hundred and fifty</num> barrels to <hi rend=italics>Embden;</hi> <num value="300">three hundred</num> to <hi rend=italics>Amsterdam;</hi> and again <num value="800">eight hundred</num> to <hi rend=italics>Embden.</hi> At this time there seems to have been a free exportation, <pb id="p.421" n="421"> except when checked by proclamation, for fear of enhancing the price of corn, by excess of brewing in scarce times; but even then it was permitted by the royal licence.<note><hi rend=italics>Strype's Stow,</hi> ii. <num value="292">292</num>.</NOTE>
<p>THOSE who wish to attempt to restore the spirit of the boisterous reign of <hi rend=italics>Henry,</hi> as far as depended on the boasted <hi rend=italics>British</hi> liquor, may use the following receipt:<note>Customes, &amp;c. of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> printed in or about <datestruct value="1521--"><year reg="1521">1521</year></datestruct>, by <hi rend=italics>Pynson.</hi></NOTE> x quarters malte. ii quarters wheet. ii quarters ootos. xl lb. weight of hoppys, to make lx barrel of seugyll beer.
<p>IT is not in my power to trace the progress of this important article of trade. Let me only say that it is now a national concern: for the duty on malt, from <hi rend=italics>July</hi> <num value="5">5th</num> <datestruct value="1785--"><year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct>, to the same day <datestruct value="1786--"><year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct>, produced a milli&ograve;n and half of money,<note><p>Vast quantities of our beer or porter are sent abroad; I do not know the sum, but the following extract from a newspaper, will shew the greatness of our Breweries.
<p>The following is a list of the chief porter brewers of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> and the barrels of strong beer they have brewed, from <hi rend=italics>Midsummer</hi> <datestruct value="1786--"><year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct>, to <hi rend=italics>Midsummer</hi> <datestruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></datestruct>. And we make no doubt but it will give our readers much pleasure, to find such a capital article of trade solely confined to <hi rend=italics>England;</hi> and the more so, as a large quantity of the porter makes a considerable part of our exports.

<p>AT a time when they were raising sacks of malt up into the store-rooms, <num value="1">one</num> of the men (and he was <num value="1">one</num> of the strongest) being in the waggon fixing the girth round the sacks to be drawn up by the crane, his thumb accidentally got fastened between the girth and sacks, and the men above began, before he could disengage himself, to draw him up with the sacks, and when at the height, which is <num value="60">sixty</num> feet, the girth broke, and he came down, with the sacks, into the waggon without being much hurt: so little that he got well in a fortnight, and about his business.&mdash;Of this I was informed by Mr. <hi rend=italics>Sheperd,</hi> <num value="1">one</num> of the clerks.
<p>I AM now arrived at the very eastern extent of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> as it was in the age of queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth.</hi> A small village or <num value="2">two</num> might be found in the remaining part of the county of <hi rend=italics>Middlesex,</hi> but bordered by marshes, which frequently experienced <pb id="p.425" n="425"> the ravages of the river. This tract had been a manor in the <hi rend=italics>Saxon</hi> times, called <hi rend=italics>Stibben-hedde,</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Stepney.</placename></NOTE> i. e. <hi rend=italics>Stibben-heath.</hi> In later days it belonged to <hi rend=italics>John de Pulteney,</hi> who had been <num value="4">four</num> times lord mayor, viz. in <datestruct value="1330--"><year reg="1330">1330</year></datestruct>, <datestruct value="1331--"><year reg="1331">1331</year></datestruct>, <datestruct value="1333--"><year reg="1333">1333</year></datestruct>, and <datestruct value="1336--"><year reg="1336">1336</year></datestruct>. The bishops of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> had here a palace, as appears from antient records, &ldquo;Given from our palace of <hi rend=italics>Stebonhyth,</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Stebonheath,</hi>&rdquo; which is supposed to have filled the space now covered with several tenements.<note><hi rend=italics>Newcourt,</hi> i. <num value="737">737</num>.</NOTE> An antient square gateway is I think still standing.

From the <num value="26">26th</num> of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> I. several inquisitions were made to examine the state of the banks and ditches, and the tenants, who were found negligent, were presented as delinquents.<note><hi rend=italics>Dugdale</hi> on embanking, <num value="69">69</num>.</NOTE> The church, which stands far from the river, was originally called <hi rend=italics>Ecclesia omnium Sanctorum,</hi> but was afterward styled that of <hi rend=italics>St. Dunstan;</hi> for the whole body of saints was obliged to give way to him who had the courage to take the devil himself by the nose.<note>Lives of the Saints.</NOTE> The church is by no means distinguished by its architecture.

<p>This vast parish is at present divided into <num value="6">six</num> others, yet the mother parish still remains of great extent.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Perry's Docks.</placename></NOTE> THE dock and ship yard, the property of Mr. <hi rend=italics>Perry,</hi> the greatest private dock in all <hi rend=italics>Europe,</hi> is at the extremity of this parish, at <hi rend=italics>Blackwall,</hi> the upper part of the eastern side of the <hi rend=italics>Isle of Dog's.</hi> It may be called the eastern end of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> being nearly a continued succession of <num value="6">six</num> miles and a half of streets, from hence to <hi rend=italics>Tyburn</hi> turnpike.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Wapping.</placename></NOTE> THE great extent of <hi rend=italics>Wapping,</hi> which stretches along the river side from <hi rend=italics>St. Katherine's,</hi> arose from the opinion of the commissioners of sewers, in <datestruct value="1571--"><year reg="1571">1571</year></datestruct>, that nothing could secure the manor from the depredations of the water, more effectually than the building of houses: for they thought the tenants would not fail being attentive to the safety of their lives and property. The plan succeeded, and in our days we see a vast and populous town <pb id="p.427" n="427"> added to the antient precincts (which had stagnated for ages). <hi rend=italics>Wapping</hi> forms a long narrow street, well paved, and handsomely flagged on both sides, winding along the banks of the <hi rend=italics>Thames,</hi> as far as the end of <hi rend=italics>Limehouse,</hi> an extent of nearly <num value="2">two</num> miles; and inhabited by multitudes of seafaring men, alternate occupants of sea and land: their floating tenements lie before them. In fact, the whole river, from <hi rend=italics>London</hi> bridge, for a vast way, is covered with a double forest of masts, with a narrow avenue in mid-channel. These give importance and safety to the state, and supply the mutual wants of the universe. We send the necessaries and luxuries of our island to every part; and, in return, receive every article which should satiate the most luxurious, wealth that ought to make avarice cry, Hold! enough! and matters for speculation for the laudable and delicate longings of the intellectual world.
<p>THE hamlet of <hi rend=italics>Shadwell</hi> is a continuation of the <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Shadwell.</placename></NOTE> buildings along the river. Between the houses and the water, in all this long tract of street, are frequent docks, and small building yards. The passenger is often surprized with the sight of the prow of a ship rising over the street, and the hulls of new ones appearing at numbers of openings. But all that filth and stench, which <hi rend=italics>Stow</hi> complains of, exists no longer. <hi rend=italics>Execution Dock</hi> still <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Execution Dock.</placename></NOTE> remains at <hi rend=italics>Wapping,</hi> and is in use as often as a <pb id="p.428" n="428"> melancholy occasion requires. The criminals are to this day executed on a temporary gallows placed at low-water mark; but the custom of leaving the body to be overflowed by <num value="3">three</num> tides, has long since been omitted.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Radcliff.</placename></NOTE> THE village of <hi rend=italics>Radcliff,</hi> to which <hi rend=italics>Wapping</hi> now joins, is of some antiquity. From hence the gallant Sir <hi rend=italics>Hugh Willoughby,</hi> on <hi rend=italics>May</hi> the <num value="20">20th</num>, <datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>, took his departure on his fatal voyage for discovering the north-east passage to <hi rend=italics>China.</hi> He sailed with great pomp by <hi rend=italics>Greenwich,</hi> where the court then lay. Mutual honors were payed on both sides. The council and courtiers appeared at the windows, and the people covered the shores. The young king alone lost the noble and novel sight; for he then lay on his death-bed; so that the principal object of the parade was disappointed.<note><hi rend=italics>Hacklugt,</hi> i. <num value="239">239</num>.</NOTE>
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Lime-house.</placename></NOTE> LIMEHOUSE is a continuation of the town along the river-side: it is a new creation: and its church, <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="50">fifty</num> new churches, was finished in <datestruct value="1724--"><year reg="1724">1724</year></datestruct>. This may be called the end of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> on the <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Poplar.</placename></NOTE> water-side; but it is continued by means of <hi rend=italics>Poplar,</hi> a chapelry in the parish of <hi rend=italics>Stepney</hi> (antiently a regal manor, so named from its abundance of poplar trees) across the upper part of the <hi rend=italics>Isle of Dogs,</hi> in a strait line to the river <hi rend=italics>Lea,</hi> the division of this county from <hi rend=italics>Essex.</hi>
<pb id="p.429" n="429">
<p>WAPPING, <hi rend=italics>Shadwell,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Limehouse,</hi> have their respective churches; and <hi rend=italics>Poplar</hi> its chapel. The <num value="2">two</num> <num value="1">first</num> have nothing to attract the eye. <hi rend=italics>Limehouse</hi> has its awkward tower, a dull square rising out of another, embellished with pilasters; heavy pinnacles rise out of the uppermost: the whole proves how unhappily Mr. <hi rend=italics>Hawksmoor,</hi> the architect of <hi rend=italics>Bloomsbury</hi> church, exerted his genius in the obsolete art of steeple-building. In the year <datestruct value="1730"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct> it was added to the bills of mortality.
<p>IN our walk through <hi rend=italics>Limehouse,</hi> we crossed the <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Poplar Canal.</placename></NOTE> New Cut, or <hi rend=italics>Poplar</hi> canal, near its discharge into the river. This was begun about <num value="20">twenty</num> years ago; runs by <hi rend=italics>Bromley,</hi> and joins the river <hi rend=italics>Lea</hi> near <hi rend=italics>Bow,</hi> where barges enter by means of a lock called <hi rend=italics>Bow-lock.</hi> This canal is about a mile and a quarter in length; and serves to bring to our capital corn, malt, and flour, from the neighborhood of <hi rend=italics>Hertford,</hi> and several other counties, which put their productions on board the barges at that town. It is also of great use to convey to the <hi rend=italics>Thames</hi> the produce of the great distilleries near <hi rend=italics>Bow;</hi> and also to the internal counties coals, and several articles from the metropolis. This canal saves the great circuit of passing down to <hi rend=italics>Lea-mouth,</hi> and thence round the <hi rend=italics>Isle of Dogs;</hi> a navigation often impeded by contrary winds and tides, which frequently fall out so adverse, as to occasion great delays. Yet this canal by no <pb id="p.430" n="430"> means annihilates the use of the river <hi rend=italics>Lea</hi> to and from its mouth; but barges go indifferently either way, as conveniency, or the circumstances abovementioned, occur. Besides, many barges will enter the river <hi rend=italics>Lea</hi> to save the navigation expences of the New Cut.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Limehouse Dock.</placename></NOTE> LIMEHOUSE <hi rend=italics>Dock</hi> is a little farther to the southeast, and is much used.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>The Folly.</NOTE> WE finished our walk, and dined at a small house called the <hi rend=italics>Folly,</hi> on the water's edge, almost opposite to the splendid hospital at <hi rend=italics>Greenwich,</hi> where we sat for some hours enjoying the delicious view of the river, and the moving picture of a succession of shipping perpetually passing and repassing.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Bills of Mortality.</NOTE> IT is wonderful, that in this great city there should have been no regular <hi rend=italics>Census;</hi><note>The <num value="1">first</num> general <hi rend=italics>Census</hi> of the kingdom took place in <datestruct value="1801--"><year reg="1801">1801</year></datestruct>; the result, as far as relates to the metropolis, will be given in the Appendix.

I will allow them to be delivered annually, by the only censors we have, <hi rend=italics>the company of parish-clerks,</hi> with all possible accuracy, as far as their knowledge extends: but, as it is admitted that a number of people find their burials in c&oelig;meteries without the bills, equal nearly to those which are annually renorted to <pb id="p.431" n="431"> be interred within their jurisdiction, the uncertainty of the enumeration collected from them must be allowed. In the last year, <num value="19697">19,697</num> were buried within the bills: if the above assertion<note>Mr. <hi rend=italics>Richardson.</hi></NOTE> is well founded, the sum must be <num value="39394">39,394</num>. I refer the decision of the numbers of inhabitants to the skilful in calculation. I have heard it averred that the present number is a million. <num value="3">Three</num> ingenious writers have made the following estimates. Mr. <hi rend=italics>Howlet</hi> gives in his at <num value="800000">800,000</num>, Mr. <hi rend=italics>Wales</hi> at <num value="650000">650,000</num>, and Doctor <hi rend=italics>Price</hi> at <num value="500000">500,000</num>. <hi rend=italics>Maitland</hi> gives the total, in the time of his publication (<datestruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>) to have been <num value="725341">725,341</num>.<note><hi rend=italics>Maitland,</hi> ii. <num value="755">755</num>.&mdash;This book is dedicated to <hi rend=italics>Slingsby Bethel,</hi> esq; who was lord mayor in that year.</NOTE> The increase of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> since his days gives a probability that the enumeration is not much exaggerated.
<p>BILLS of mortality took rise in <datestruct value="1592--"><year reg="1592">1592</year></datestruct>, in which began a great pestilence, which continued till the <num value="18">18th</num> of <hi rend=italics>December</hi> <datestruct value="1595--"><year reg="1595">1595</year></datestruct>. During this period they were kept in order to ascertain the number of persons who died: but when the plague ceased, the bills were discontinued.

<p>AMONG the multitudes who fall victims to disease, is a melancholy account of the rural youth, who crowd here in numbers, laboring under the delusion of preferment: some perish soon, without even attaining a service; or, urged by want, fall under the cognizance of justice. Others get admission into shops, or into places, where they experience hard work, hard wages, hard lodgings, and scanty food. They soon fall ill, are neglected, or flung into an hospital when passed all relief: they perish. Their native villages want their innocent labor, and the wholc rustic community, I may say the whole kingdom, suffers for the indiscreet ambition of these unhappy youths or of their simple parents.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Radcliff Highway.</placename></NOTE> WE varied our road on our return, by taking that of <hi rend=italics>Radeliff Highway,</hi> a broad and very long street, ending in <hi rend=italics>East Smithfield.</hi> On the north side stands another of the <num value="50">fifty</num> new churches, <pb id="p.433" n="433"> <hi rend=italics>St. George's Middlesex:</hi> square rises out of <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>St. George's Middlesex.</placename></NOTE> square, to compose the steeple: its upper story is incomprehensible, the outside stuck around with chimney-like columns, square at the lower parts, above making a sudden transition into the round.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Sir John Leake.</NOTE> THIS house is unworthy of the greatness of its design. In the council-room are some portraits of eminent men. The most remarkable is that of Sir <hi rend=italics>John Leake,</hi> with his lank grey locks, and a loose night-gown, with a mien very little indicative of his high courage, and active spirit. He was the greatest commander of his time, and engaged in most actions of note during the reigns of king <hi rend=italics>William</hi> and queen <hi rend=italics>Anne.</hi> To him was committed the desperate, but successful attempt of breaking the boom; previous to the relief of <hi rend=italics>Londonderry.</hi> He distinguished himself greatly at the battle of <hi rend=italics>La Hogue;</hi> assisted at the taking of <hi rend=italics>Gibraltar;</hi> and afterward, as commander in chief, reduced <hi rend=italics>Barcelona;</hi> took <hi rend=italics>Carthagena,</hi> and brought <hi rend=italics>Sardinia</hi>

He lived privately at <hi rend=italics>Greenwich,</hi> where he died in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, and was buried in a manner suitable to his merits, in the church at <hi rend=italics>Stepney.</hi> His life was written, and privately printed on large paper, octavo, in <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>, by <hi rend=italics>Stephen Martin Leake,</hi> esq; late garter king at arms. Only <num value="50">fifty</num> copies were printed; so that the book bears an immoderate price.
<p>IT is in this house that the business of the institution is carried on; but the mother-house is at <hi rend=italics>Deptford,</hi> the corporation being named <hi rend=italics>The master, wardens, and assistants of the guild or fraternity of the most glorious and undivided Trinity,</hi> and of <hi rend=italics>St. Clement,</hi> in the parish of <hi rend=italics>Deptford Strond,</hi> in the county of <hi rend=italics>Kent.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Strype's Maitland,</hi> ii. book v. p. <num value="286">286</num>.</NOTE>

It was not till the reign of king <hi rend=italics>William</hi> that it became celebrated as a fishmarket. In <datestruct value="1699--"><year reg="1699">1699</year></datestruct>, by act of parlement, it was made a free port for fish, which might be sold there every day in the week except <hi rend=italics>Sunday.</hi> The object of this has long been frustrated, and the epicure who goes (as was a frequent practice) to <hi rend=italics>Billingsgate</hi> to eat fish in perfection, will now be cruelly disappointed.
<p>I CANNOT give a list of the fishes most acceptable in the <hi rend=italics>Saxon</hi> ages; but there is a list of those which were brought to market in the reign of <pb id="p.441" n="441"> <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> I. who descended even to regulate the prices, that his subjects might not be left to the mercy of the venders.

<p>By the very high price of the pike, it is very probable that this fish had not yet been introduced into our ponds, but was imported at this period as a luxury, pickled, or some way preserved. <pb id="p.442" n="442">
<p>AMONG these fishes, let me observe, that the conger is, at present, never admitted to any good table; and to speak of serving up a porpesse whole, or in part, would set your guests a-staring. Yet, such is the difference of taste, both these fishes were in high esteem. King <hi rend=italics>Richard's</hi> master cooks have left a most excellent receipt for <hi rend=italics>Congur in Sawse;</hi><note>Forme of Cury, <num value="52">52</num>.</NOTE> and as for other great fish, it was either eaten roasted, or salted, or in broth, or <hi rend=italics>furmente with porpesse.</hi><note><num value="53">53</num>, <num value="39">39</num>, <num value="56">56</num>.</NOTE> The learned Doctor <hi rend=italics>Caius</hi> even tells us the proper sauce, and says, that it should be the same with that for a <hi rend=italics>Dolphin;</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Caii</hi> opuscula, <num value="116">116</num>.</NOTE> another dish unheard of in our days.
<p>I CONFESS myself unacquainted with the words <hi rend=italics>Barkey, Bran,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Betule: Sard</hi> was probably the <hi rend=italics>Sardine</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Pilchard:</hi> I am equally at a loss about <hi rend=italics>Croplings,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Rumb:</hi> but the pickled <hi rend=italics>Balenes</hi> were certainly the <hi rend=italics>Pholas Dactylus;</hi><note><hi rend=italics>British Zoology,</hi> ed. <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>. iv. <num value="156">156</num>.</NOTE> the <hi rend=italics>Balanus</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Rondeletius de Testaceis,</hi> <num value="28">28</num>; and the <hi rend=italics>Dattili</hi> of the modern <hi rend=italics>Italians,</hi> which are to this day eaten, and even pickled.
<p>TO this list of sea-fishes, which were admitted in those days to table, may be added the sturgeon, and ling; and there is twice mention, in archbishop <hi rend=italics>Neville's</hi> great feast, of a certain fish, both roasted and baked, unknown at present, called a <hi rend=italics>Thirl-poole.</hi>
<pb id="p.443" n="443">
<p>THE seal was also reckoned a fish, and, with the sturgeon and porpesse, were the only fresh fishes which, by the <num value="33">33</num>d of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. were permitted to be bought of any stranger at sea, between <hi rend=italics>England</hi> and <hi rend=italics>France, Flanders,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Zealand.</hi>

<p>ON <hi rend=italics>April</hi> <num value="11">11th</num> of the present year, I passed through <hi rend=italics>Billingsgate,</hi> and observed on the ground, some large pieces of ice, in which I was told the salmon from <hi rend=italics>Berwich,</hi> and other parts of our northern fishery, was packed in boxes. The ice is preserved in ice-houses throughout the winter entirely for that purpose.
<p>A LITTLE to the west is <hi rend=italics>London-bridge.</hi> The <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>London-bridge.</placename></NOTE> year of its foundation is not settled. The <num value="1">first</num> mention of it is in the laws of <hi rend=italics>Ethelred,</hi> which fix the tolls of vessels coming to <hi rend=italics>Billingsgate,</hi> or <hi rend=italics>ad Pontem.</hi> It could not be prior to the year <datestruct value="993"><year reg="993">993</year></datestruct>, when <hi rend=italics>Unlaf,</hi> the <hi rend=italics>Dane,</hi> sailed up the river as high as <hi rend=italics>Staines,</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Saxon Chron.</hi> <num value="148">148</num>.</NOTE> without interruption: nor yet after the year <datestruct value="1016"><year reg="1016">1016</year></datestruct>, in which <hi rend=italics>Ethelred</hi> died: and the great <hi rend=italics>Canute,</hi> king of <hi rend=italics>Denmark,</hi> when he besieged <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> was impeded in his operations by a bridge, which even at that time must have been strongly fortified, to oblige him to have recourse to the following vast expedient:&mdash;He caused a prodigious ditch to be cut on the south side of <pb id="p.444" n="444"> the <hi rend=italics>Thames,</hi> at <hi rend=italics>Rotherhithe,</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Redriff,</hi> a little to the east of <hi rend=italics>Southwark,</hi> which he continued at a distance from the south end of the bridge, in form of a semicircle, opening into the western part of the river. Through this he drew his ships, and effectually completed the blockade of the city.<note><hi rend=italics>Saxon Chron.</hi> <num value="148">148</num>.</NOTE> But the valour of the citizens obliged him to raise the siegc. Evidences of this great work were found in the place called <hi rend=italics>The Dock Head,</hi> at <hi rend=italics>Redriff,</hi> where it began. <hi rend=italics>Fascines</hi> of hazels, and other brush-wood, fastened down with stakes, were discovered in digging that dock, in <datestruct value="1694--"><year reg="1694">1694</year></datestruct>; and in other parts of its course have been met with, in ditching, large oaken planks, and numbers of piles.<note><hi rend=italics>Maitland,</hi> i. <num value="35">35</num>.</NOTE>
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>When Built.</NOTE> THE bridge originated from the public spirit of the college of priests of <hi rend=italics>St. Marie Overie.</hi> Before, there had been a ferry, left by her parents to their only daughter <hi rend=italics>Mary;</hi> who, out of the profits, founded a nunnery and endowed it with the profits of the boat. This house was afterward converted into the college of priests, who not only built the bridge but kept it in repair: but it must be understood <NOTE PLACE=MARG><num value="1">First</num> of Timber.</NOTE> that the <num value="1">first</num> bridge was of timber, the materials at hand, and most probably rudely put together. This account is given by <hi rend=italics>Stow,</hi> from the report of <hi rend=italics>Bartholomew Linsted,</hi> alias <hi rend=italics>Fowle,</hi> last <pb id="p.445" n="445"> prior of <hi rend=italics>St. Marie Overie;</hi> but was doubted, because the work has been supposed to be too great, and too disinterested for a college of priests, who were to give up the certain profits of the ferry, for those resulting precariously from an expensive undertaking. Even the existence of a religious house before the Conquest has been suspected: but the <hi rend=italics>Domesday</hi> book puts that out of doubt, by informing us, <hi rend=italics>Ipse episcopus habet unum monasterium in Sudwerche.</hi> Numbers of useful, as well as pious works, in early days, originated from the instigation of the churchmen, who often had the honor of being called the founders, when the work itself was performed by their devotees. Neither is it to be supposed that they could keep it in repair: the same zeal which impelled people to contribute to the building, operated in the investiture of land for its future support; and this appears to have been done in several instances; yet the endowments were so small, that a supplementary tax was often raised.
<p>IN <datestruct value="1136--"><year reg="1136">1136</year></datestruct>, the bridge was burnt down. By the <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Burnt in <datestruct value="1136--"><year reg="1136">1136</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> year <datestruct value="1163"><year reg="1163">1163</year></datestruct> it grew so ruinous as to occasion its being rebuilt, under the care of <num value="1">one</num> <hi rend=italics>Peter,</hi> curate of <hi rend=italics>St. Mary Colechurch,</hi> a celebrated architect of those times. It was soon after determined to build a bridge of stone, and, about the year <datestruct value="1176"><year reg="1176">1176</year></datestruct>, <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Rebuilt in <datestruct value="1176--"><year reg="1176">1176</year></datestruct> With Stone.</NOTE> the same <hi rend=italics>Peter</hi> was employed again. It proved the work of <num value="33">thirty-three</num> years: the architect died <pb id="p.446" n="446"> <num value="4">four</num> years before it was completed; and another clergyman, <hi rend=italics>Isenbert,</hi> master of the schools of <hi rend=italics>Xaintes,</hi> was recommended to the citizens, by king <hi rend=italics>John,</hi> for the honor of finishing it;<note><hi rend=italics>Maitland,</hi> Hist. Lond. i. <num value="45">45</num>.</NOTE> but they rejected their prince's choice, and committed the work to <num value="3">three</num> merchants of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> who completed <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Chapel in <num value="1">One</num> of the Piers.</NOTE> it in <datestruct value="1209--"><year reg="1209">1209</year></datestruct>. <hi rend=italics>Peter</hi> was buried in a beautiful chapel, probably of his own construction, dedicated to <hi rend=italics>St. Thomas,</hi> which stood on the east side, in the <num value="9">ninth</num> pier from the north end, and had an entrance from the river, as well as the street, by a winding staircase. It was beautifully paved with black and white marble, and in the middle was a tomb, supposed to contain his remains.
<p>THIS great work was founded on enormous piles, driven as closely as possible together: on their tops were laid long planks <num value="10">ten</num> inches thick, strongly bolted; and on them was placed the base of the pier, the lowermost stones of which were bedded in pitch, to prevent the water from damaging the work: round all were the piles which are called the <hi rend=italics>Sterlings,</hi> designed for the preservation of the foundation piles. These contracted the space between the piers so greatly, as to occasion, at the retreat of every tide, a fall of <num value="5">five</num> feet, or a number of temporary cataracts, which, since the foundation of the bridge, have occasioned the <pb id="p.447" n="447"> loss of many <num value="1000">thousand</num> lives. The water, at spring-tides, rises to the height of about eighteen feet. The length of this vast work is <num value="915">nine hundred and fifteen</num> feet, the exact breadth of the river. The number of arches was <num value="19">nineteen</num>, of unequal dimensions, and greatly deformed by the sterlings, and the houses on each side, which overhung and leaned in a most terrific manner. In most places they hid the arches, and nothing appeared but the rude piers. I well remember the street on <hi rend=italics>London-bridge,</hi> narrow, darksome, and dangerous to passengers from the multitude of carriages: frequent arches of strong timber crossed the street, from the tops of the houses, to keep them together, and from falling into the river. Nothing but use could preserve the repose of the inmates, who soon grew deaf to the noise of the falling waters, the clamors of watermen, or the frequent shrieks of drowning wretches. Most of the houses were tenanted by pin or needlemakers, <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Pinmakers.</NOTE> and &oelig;conomical ladies were wont to drive from the <hi rend=italics>St. James's</hi> end of the town, to make cheap purchases. <hi rend=italics>Fuller</hi> tells us, that <hi rend=italics>Spanish</hi> needles were made here <num value="1">first</num> in <hi rend=italics>Cheapside,</hi> by a negro, who died without communicating the art. <hi rend=italics>Elias Crowse,</hi> a <hi rend=italics>German,</hi> in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth,</hi> was more liberal, and <num value="1">first</num> taught the method to the <hi rend=italics>English. Fuller's</hi> definition of a needle is excellent, <hi rend=italics>quasi</hi> NE IDLE. <pb id="p.448" n="448">
<p>IN the bridge were <num value="3">three</num> openings on each side, with ballustrades, to give passengers a sight of the water and shipping. In <num value="1">one</num> part had been a <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Draw-bridge.</NOTE> draw-bridge, useful either by way of defence, or for the admission of ships into the upper part of the river. This was protected by a strong tower. It served to repulse <hi rend=italics>Fauconbridge</hi> the Bastard, in his general assault on the city in <datestruct value="1471--"><year reg="1471">1471</year></datestruct>, with a set of banditti, under pretence of rescuing the unfortunate <hi rend=italics>Henry,</hi> then confined in the <hi rend=italics>Tower.</hi> <num value="60">Sixty</num> houses were burnt on the bridge on this occasion.<note><hi rend=italics>Holinshed,</hi>
<num value="690">690</num>.</NOTE> It also served to check, and in the end annihilate, the ill-conducted insurrection of Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Wyat,</hi> in the reign of queen <hi rend=italics>Mary.</hi> The top of this tower, in the sad and turbulent days of this kingdom, used to be the shambles of human flesh, and covered with the heads or quarters of unfortunate partizans. Even so late as the year <datestruct value="1598"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>Hentzner,</hi> the <hi rend=italics>German</hi> traveller, with <hi rend=italics>German</hi> accuracy, counted on it above <num value="30">thirty</num> heads.<note><hi rend=italics>Fugitive Pieces,</hi> vol. ii. <num value="243">243</num>.</NOTE> The old map of the city, in <datestruct value="1597--"><year reg="1597">1597</year></datestruct>, represents them in a most horrible cluster.
<p>AT the north end of the bridge <num value="1">one</num> <hi rend=italics>Peter Corbis,</hi> a <hi rend=italics>Dutchman,</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Stow's Survaie.&mdash;London and its Environs,</hi> iv. <num value="146">146</num>.</NOTE> in the year <datestruct value="1582"><year reg="1582">1582</year></datestruct>, invented and placed an engine to force the water of the <hi rend=italics>Thames</hi> into leaden pipes, to supply many of the adjacent parts of the city. It has, since that time, been so <pb id="p.449" n="449"> greatly improved, by the skill of the <hi rend=italics>English</hi> mechanics, as to become a most curious as well as useful piece of machinery, and to be extremely worthy the attention of those conversant in that branch of science.
<p>I MUST not quit the bridge, without noticing an <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Dreadful Calamityby Fire.</NOTE> unparalleled calamity, which happened on it within <num value="4">four</num> years after it was finished. A fire began on it at the <hi rend=italics>Southwark</hi> end; multitudes of people rushed out of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> to extinguish it; while they were engaged in this charitable design, the fire seized on the opposite end, and hemmed in the crowd. Above <num value="3000">three thousand</num> persons perished in the flames, or were drowned by overloading the vessels which were hardy enough to attempt their relief.
<p>THE gallant action of <hi rend=italics>Edward Osborne,</hi> ancestor <NOTE PLACE=MARG>A brave action.</NOTE> to the duke of <hi rend=italics>Leeds,</hi> when he was apprentice to Sir <hi rend=italics>William Hewet,</hi> clothworker, must by no means be forgotten. About the year <datestruct value="1536"><year reg="1536">1536</year></datestruct>, when his master lived in <num value="1">one</num> of these tremendous houses, a servant-maid was playing with his only daughter in her arms, in a window over the water, and accidentally dropt the child. Young <hi rend=italics>Osborne,</hi> who was witness to the misfortune, instantly sprung into the river, and, beyond all expectation, brought her safe to the terrified family. Several persons of rank payed their addresses to her, when she was marriageable; among others, the earl of <hi rend=italics>Shrewsbury:</hi> but Sir <hi rend=italics>William</hi> gratefully decided in favor <pb id="p.450" n="450"> of <hi rend=italics>Osborne;</hi> OSBORNE, says he, <hi rend=italics>saved her,</hi> and OSBORNE <hi rend=italics>shall enjoy her.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Stow,</hi> ii. book v. <num value="133">133</num>.&mdash;and <hi rend=italics>Collins's</hi> Peerage, i. <num value="235">235</num>.</NOTE> In her right he possessed a great fortune. He became sheriff of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> in <datestruct value="1575--"><year reg="1575">1575</year></datestruct>; and lord mayor in <datestruct value="1583--"><year reg="1583">1583</year></datestruct>. I have seen the picture of his master at <hi rend=italics>Kiveton,</hi> the seat of the duke of <hi rend=italics>Leeds,</hi> a half-length on board: his dress is a black gown furred, a red vest and sleeve, a gold chain, and a bonnet. He served the office of lord mayor in <datestruct value="1559--"><year reg="1559">1559</year></datestruct>; and died in <datestruct value="1566--"><year reg="1566">1566</year></datestruct>. <hi rend=italics>Strype</hi> mistakes, when he says, that Sir <hi rend=italics>William</hi> died in <datestruct value="1599--"><year reg="1599">1599</year></datestruct>, and was buried in the cathedral of <hi rend=italics>St. Paul:</hi> another person of the same name lies there, under the handsome monument<note>Engraven in <hi rend=italics>Dugdale's</hi> History of <hi rend=italics>St. Paul's,</hi> <num value="66">66</num>.</NOTE> ascribed by our old historian to the former.
<p>OF the multitudes who have perished in this rapid descent, the name of no <num value="1">one</num>, of any note, has reached my knowledge, except that of Mr. <hi rend=italics>Temple,</hi> only son of the great Sir <hi rend=italics>William Temple.</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG>A Suicide.</NOTE> His end was dreadful, as it was premeditated. He had, a week before, accepted, from king <hi rend=italics>William,</hi> the office of Secretary at War. On the <num value="14">14th</num> of <hi rend=italics>April,</hi> <datestruct value="1689--"><year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct>, he hired a boat on the <hi rend=italics>Thames,</hi> and directed the waterman to shoot the bridge; at that instant he flung himself into the torrent, and, having filled his pockets with stones, to destroy all chance of safety,<note><hi rend=italics>Reresby's Memoirs,</hi> <num value="346">346</num>.</NOTE> instantly sunk. In the boat <pb id="p.451" n="451"> was found a note to this effect: &ldquo;My folly, in undertaking what I could not perform, whereby some misfortunes have befallen the king's service, is the cause of putting myself to this sudden end. I wish him success in all his undertakings, and a better servant.&rdquo; I hope his father's reflection, on the occasion, was a parental apology, not his real sentiments: &ldquo;That a wise man might dispose of himself, and make his life as short as he pleased.&rdquo; How strongly did this great man militate against the precepts of Christianity, and the solid arguments of a most wise and pious heathen!<note>CICERO in his <hi rend=italics>Somnium Scipionis.</hi></NOTE>
<p>Very near to the northern end of the bridge, is the church of <hi rend=italics>St. Magnus.</hi> It is probably of great <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Church of St. Magnus.</placename></NOTE> antiquity; yet the <num value="1">first</num> mention of it is in <datestruct value="1433--"><year reg="1433">1433</year></datestruct>. It was consumed in the great fire, but within <num value="10">ten</num> years was restored in its present handsome form. The bottom of the tower is open, so as to admit a most convenient thoroughfare to the numerous passengers.
<p>A LITTLE higher up, on the left hand, is <hi rend=italics>Eastcheap,</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Eastcheap.</placename></NOTE> immortalized by SHAKESPEARE, as the place of rendezvous of Sir <hi rend=italics>John Falstaff</hi> and his merry companions. Here stood the <hi rend=italics>Boar's Head</hi> tavern; the site is now covered with modern houses, but in the front of <num value="1">one</num> is still preserved the memory of the sign, the <hi rend=italics>Boar's Head,</hi> cut in <pb id="p.452" n="452"> stone, which, I am informed by a friend who used to frequent the old house when it was a tavern, was originally above the chimney-piece in the great eating-room. Notwithstanding the house is gone, we shall laugh at the humor of the jovial knight, his hostess, <hi rend=italics>Bardolph,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Pistol,</hi> as long as the descriptive pages of our great dramatic writer exist in our entertained imagination. I must mention, that in the wall of another house is a <hi rend=italics>Swan</hi> cut in stone; probably, in old times, the sign of another tavern.
<p>THE renowned <hi rend=italics>Henry,</hi> prince of <hi rend=italics>Wales,</hi> was not the only <num value="1">one</num> of the royal family, whose youthful blood led them into frolic and riot. His brothers, <hi rend=italics>John,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Thomas,</hi> with their attendants, between <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="3">three</num> o'clock, after midnight, raised such an uproar, that the mayor and sheriffs thought proper to interfere. This the princes took as an insult on their dignity. The magistrates were convened by the celebrated chief justice <hi rend=italics>Gascoigne;</hi> they stood on their defence, and were most honorably dismissed, it being proved that they did no more than their duty, towards the maintenance of the peace.<note><hi rend=italics>Stow's Survaie,</hi> <num value="404">404</num>.</NOTE>
<p>THIS street was famous, in old times, for its convivial doings; &ldquo;The cookes cried hot ribbes of beef rosted, pies well baked, and other victuals:<note>Id. ibid.</NOTE> there was clattering of pewter, pots, harpe, pipe, <pb id="p.453" n="453"> and sawtrie.&rdquo; Evident marks of the jollity of this quarter.
<p>IN <hi rend=italics>Pudding-lane,</hi> at a very small distance from <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Fire in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> this church, began the ever-memorable calamity by fire, on the <num value="2">2</num>d of <hi rend=italics>September,</hi> <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>. In <num value="4">four</num> days it consumed every part of this noble city within the walls, except what lies within a line drawn from the north part of <hi rend=italics>Coleman-street,</hi> and just to the south-west of <hi rend=italics>Leaden-hall,</hi> and from thence to the <hi rend=italics>Tower.</hi> Its ravages were also extended without the walls, to the west, as far as <hi rend=italics>Fetter-lane,</hi> and the <hi rend=italics>Temple.</hi> As it began in <hi rend=italics>Pudding-lane,</hi> it ended in <hi rend=italics>Smithfield</hi> at <hi rend=italics>Pye-corner;</hi> which might occasion the inscription with the figure of a boy, on a house in the latter place, now almost erased, which attributes <hi rend=italics>the fire of</hi> LONDON <hi rend=italics>to the sin of gluttony.</hi> The boy is represented wonderfully fat indeed! I leave the reader to consult the <num value="2">second</num> volume of the <hi rend=italics>City Remembrancer,</hi> for the melancholy detail.
<p>SIR <hi rend=italics>Christopher Wren</hi> was coeval with this misfortune. The plans which he offered to the public for rebuilding the city, with genuine taste, and a splendor worthy of ancient <hi rend=italics>Rome,</hi> were unfortunately rejected. Perhaps the times are not greatly to be blamed; there were a <num value="1000">thousand</num> difficulties in respect to the division of property; there was, in a vast commercial city, such as <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> an impatience to resume their former occupations, <pb id="p.454" n="454"> and a prejudice for the antient sites. It was difficult to persuade people to relinquish, for a mere work of taste, a spot productive of thousands, to them or their predecessors. These things considered, it is not to be wondered that we are left to admire, on paper only, the vast designs of this great architect. But still he was the restorer of several of our public buildings: many of our temples arose with improved beauty from his plans; and several other buildings, which we have had, or shall have occasion to mention.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>The Monument.</placename></NOTE> THAT astonishing proof of his genius, the <hi rend=italics>Monument,</hi> is placed on the side of <hi rend=italics>Fish-street,</hi> very near to the spot where the calamity began:

Here the sculptor found, luckily, <num value="1">one</num> example to compliment the attention of the thoughtless monarch towards the good of his subjects; for, during the horrors of the conflagration, and after it was subdued, his endeavours to stop the evil, and to remedy its consequences, were truly indefatigable. The king was seriously affected by this calamity, and many emotions of piety and devotion were excited in him. There was, for a short time, great reason to expect the fruits of this his brief return to Heaven: but they were quickly blasted by the uncommon wickedness of the people about him, who, by every profane witticism on the recent calamity, and even by suggesting that it was the blessing of God, to humble this rebellious city, and to prepare it for his yoke, soon removed every good thought from the royal breast.<note>Continuation of Lord <hi rend=italics>Clarendon's</hi> Life, <num value="675">675</num>.</NOTE> This noble column was begun in <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>; and finished in <datestruct value="1677--"><year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>, at the expence of <num value="14500">14,500</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> A melancholy period of party rage! and the injurious inscription, written by doctor <hi rend=italics>Thomas Gale,</hi> afterwards dean of <hi rend=italics>York,</hi> was permitted.

The plague, which, for a series of ages, had, with very short intervals, visited our capital in its most dreadful forms, never appeared there again after the rebuilding of the city in a more open and airy manner; the removal of several nuisances, which, if not the actual origin of a plague, supplied assuredly <num value="1">one</num> great <hi rend=italics>pabulum,</hi> when it had seized our streets.

<p><rs>Marseilles' Good Bishop</rs> must not engross every tongue. We had in our capital, during this <pb id="p.457" n="457"> sad calamity, heroes that might vie in piety with that worthy prelate. Sir JOHN LAURENCE, lord <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Sir John Laurence.</NOTE> mayor in the year of the plague, shewed equal intrepidity, humanity, and charity. Fear of the disease seemed to have steeled the hearts of men; for, as soon as its nature was certainly known, above <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> servants were turned into the streets to perish: no <num value="1">one</num> would receive them into their houses; and the villagers near <hi rend=italics>London</hi> drove them away with pitch-forks, and fire-arms.<note>Journal of the <hi rend=italics>Plague-year.</hi></NOTE> Sir JOHN LAURENCE took these wretched fugitives under his protection, relieved them with his own fortune as long as that lasted, and then by subscriptions which he solicited from all parts.

<p>THE heroism of <hi rend=italics>George Monk,</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>Albemarle,</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Duke of A Bemarle, and Earl Craven.</NOTE> and of <hi rend=italics>William</hi> earl <hi rend=italics>Craven,</hi> must not pass unnoticed; their virtue forbad them to absent themselves in this dire season. They, in conjunction with the civil magistrate, took every means to alleviate the calamity, and to prevent its progress: here their valour was put to the test; and amidst the horrors of death, which no wisdom could avert, they behaved with the same coolness as when they were supported by the glory of victory, amidst the thunder of artillery, and flights of bullets. In <pb id="p.458" n="458"> <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Archbishop Sheldon.</NOTE> archbishop <hi rend=italics>Sheldon</hi> was united the firm courage of the former characters, with the piety of a churchman. He continued at <hi rend=italics>Lambeth</hi> during the whole contagion: preserving, by his charities, multitudes who were sinking under the pressure of disease and want; and, by his pathetic letters to his suffragans, procured from their dioceses benevolences to a vast amount.
<p>ALMOST opposite to the place where the Monument now stands, was a large stone house, the habitation of <hi rend=italics>Edward,</hi> our famous black prince, the flower of <hi rend=italics>English</hi> chivalry.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Fishmongers-Hall.</placename></NOTE> AT a small distance, to the west of the bridge, is <hi rend=italics>Fishmongers-hall,</hi> a very handsome building, erected since the destruction of the old hall by the great fire. It faces the river, and commands a fine view of the water and the bridge. In the courtroom are several pictures of the various sorts of vendible fishes. A printed catalogue of the species and varieties, with their seasons, was presented to me when I visited the place.
<p>IN the great hall is a wooden statue of the brave Sir <hi rend=italics>William Walworth,</hi> armed with his rebelkill- ing dagger; here is also another of <hi rend=italics>St. Peter:</hi> the former was of this company; the latter with great propriety is adopted as its tutelar saint. The arms <pb id="p.459" n="459"> of the benefactors are beautifully emblazoned in painted glass on the several windows.
<p>THIS is <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="12">twelve</num> great companies: it originally was divided into <hi rend=italics>Stock-mongers</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Saltfish-mongers;</hi> the former were incorporated in <datestruct value="1433--"><year reg="1433">1433</year></datestruct>; a period in--which we had very considerable trade with <hi rend=italics>Iceland</hi> in that very article:<note>See <hi rend=italics>Arct.

There was once a desperate feud between this company and the Goldsmiths, about precedency.

This company pays <num value="800">800</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> a year to charitable uses.
<p>THE next place I shall take notice of, to the <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Cold Harbour.</placename></NOTE> west of this hall, is <hi rend=italics>Cold Harbour,</hi> mentioned as a tenement as early as the reign of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> II. A magnificent house was, in after-times, built on the spot, which, from its occupant, Sir <hi rend=italics>John Poultney,</hi>
<num value="4">four</num> times mayor of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> was, in the style of the times, called <hi rend=italics>Poultney-Inn:</hi> for the town habitations <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Poultney-Inn.</placename></NOTE> of most of the great men were called <hi rend=italics>Inns. Warwick-Inn</hi> was the palace of the great <pb id="p.460" n="460"> king-maker, and many others had the same addition. In feudal days the town had no pleasures to attract the great; they seldom came there but to support a cause (as now and then is the case with a modern senator), to make or unmake a king, or lay the foundation of civil broils. In <datestruct value="1397--"><year reg="1397">1397</year></datestruct>, it was the <hi rend=italics>Inn</hi> of <hi rend=italics>John Holland,</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>Exeter,</hi> and earl of <hi rend=italics>Huntingdon,</hi> who here gave a dinner, and doubtlessly a very magnificent <num value="1">one</num>, to his halfbrother <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> II. Next year it became the inn of <hi rend=italics>Edmund</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Langley,</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Cambridge,</hi> but still retained the addition of <hi rend=italics>Poultney.</hi> In <datestruct value="1410--"><year reg="1410">1410</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> IV. granted this house to his son <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> prince of <hi rend=italics>Wales,</hi> by the title of <hi rend=italics>quoddam hospitium sive placeam</hi> (vocatum <hi rend=italics>le Coldeherbergh</hi>), for the term of his life. And in the same year (to stock his cellars) gives him an order on the collector of the customs for <num value="20">twenty</num> casks and <num value="1">one</num> pipe of red wine of <hi rend=italics>Gascony,</hi> and that without the payment of any duty. In <datestruct value="1472--"><year reg="1472">1472</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>Henry Holland,</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>Exeter,</hi> lodged in it. In <datestruct value="1485--"><year reg="1485">1485</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> III. granted it to <hi rend=italics>Garter</hi> king of arms, and his brother heralds. In the time of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. it was given to <hi rend=italics>Tonstal,</hi> bishop of <hi rend=italics>Durham,</hi> in lieu of <hi rend=italics>Durhamplace.</hi> On his deposal it was granted to the earl of <hi rend=italics>Shrewsbury,</hi> by <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> VI; and changed its name to that of <hi rend=italics>Shrewsbury-house.</hi>

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Steel-Yard.</placename></NOTE> TO the west of this place was the <hi rend=italics>Steel-yard,</hi> a most noted quay for the landing of wheat, rye, <pb id="p.461" n="461"> and other grain; cables, masts, tar, flax, hemp, linen cloth, wainscot, wax, steel, and other merchandize, imported by the <hi rend=italics>Easterlings,</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Germans.</hi> Here was the <hi rend=italics>Guildhalda Teutonicorum,</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Guildhall</hi> of those people.

They were not to forestall the market from the burghers of <hi rend=italics>London;</hi> and to pay toll, at <hi rend=italics>Christmas,</hi> <num value="2">two</num> grey cloths, and <num value="1">one</num> brown <num value="1">one</num>, with <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure> of pepper, <num value="5">five</num> pair of gloves, <num value="2">two</num> vessels of vinegar; and as many at <hi rend=italics>Easter.</hi> The name of this wharf is not taken from <hi rend=italics>Steel</hi> the metal, which was only a single article, but from <hi rend=italics>Stael-hoff,</hi> contracted from <hi rend=italics>Stapel-hoff,</hi> or the general house of trade of the <hi rend=italics>German</hi> nation. The powerful league of the <hi rend=italics>Hanse Towns,</hi> and the profits we made of their trade (for they were for a long season the principal importers of this kingdom) procured them great privileges. They had an alderman of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> for their judge, in case of disputes; and they were to be free from all subsidies to the king, or his heirs; saving, says the king, to us and our heirs, our antient prizes, <hi rend=italics>prisis juribusque consuetudinibus constumisque.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Rymer,</hi> xi. <num value="498">498</num>.</NOTE> In <pb id="p.462" n="462"> return for these distinguishing favors, they were to keep in repair the gate called <hi rend=italics>Bishopsgate.</hi> In <datestruct value="1282--"><year reg="1282">1282</year></datestruct>, they were called on to perform their duty, the gate being at that time in a ruinous state; they refused; but being compelled by law, <hi rend=italics>Gerard Marbod,</hi> their alderman, advanced the necessary sum. In <datestruct value="1479--"><year reg="1479">1479</year></datestruct>, it was even rebuilt in a most magnificent manner, by the merchants of the <hi rend=italics>Steelyard.</hi> As they decreased in strength, and we grew more powerful and more politic, we began to abridge their privileges. We found that this potent company, by their weight, interfered with the interest of the natives, and damped their spirit of trade. After several revocations and renewals of their charter, the house, in <datestruct value="1597--"><year reg="1597">1597</year></datestruct>, was shut up, by our wise and patriotic queen, and the <hi rend=italics>German</hi> inhabitants were expelled the kingdom.
<p>AT this time it is the great repository of imported iron, whence our metropolis is supplied with that necessary material. The quantity of bars, that fill the yards and warehouses of this quarter, strikes with astonishment the most indifferent beholder.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Triumphs of Riches and Poverty.</NOTE> IN the hall of this company were the <num value="2">two</num> famous pictures, painted in distemper by <hi rend=italics>Holbein,</hi> representing the triumphs of Riches and Poverty.

<p>IN the triumph of Riches, <hi rend=italics>Plutus</hi> is represented in a golden car, and <hi rend=italics>Fortune</hi> sitting before him, flinging money into the laps of people, holding up their garments to receive her favors: <hi rend=italics>Ventidius</hi> is written under <num value="1">one</num>; <hi rend=italics>Gadareus</hi> under another; and <hi rend=italics>Themistocles</hi> under a man kneeling beside the car: <hi rend=italics>Cr&oelig;sus, Midas,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Tantalus</hi> follow; <hi rend=italics>Narcissus</hi> holds the horse of the <num value="1">first</num>: over their heads, in the clouds, is <hi rend=italics>Nemesis.</hi> There are various allegorical figures, which I shall not attempt to explain. By the sides of the horses walk dropsical and other diseased figures, the too frequent attendants of riches. <pb id="p.464" n="464">
<p>POVERTY appears in another car, mean and shattered, half naked, squalid, and meagre.

By the sides of the car walks <hi rend=italics>Labor,</hi> represented by lusty workmen with their tools, with chearful looks; and behind them <hi rend=italics>Misery,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Beggary,</hi> in ragged weeds, and with countenances replete with wretchedness and discontent.
<p>NOT remote from hence formerly stood the <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>The Erber.</placename></NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Erber,</hi> a vast house or palace. <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> III. for it is not traced higher, granted it to <num value="1">one</num> of the noble family of the <hi rend=italics>Scroopes;</hi> from them it fell to the <hi rend=italics>Nevilles.

<p>There is, besides, a statue of that saint in the same room; and another picture of him above stairs.

<p>OUR great wine trade was at <num value="1">first</num> with <hi rend=italics>Bourdeaux,</hi> and the neighboring provinces; it commenced as early as the Conquest, perhaps sooner.<note><hi rend=italics>Camden,</hi> i. <num value="672">672</num>.</NOTE> <pb id="p.469" n="469"> But it became very considerable in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> II. by reason of his marriage with <hi rend=italics>Eleanor,</hi> daughter of the duke of <hi rend=italics>Aquitaine;</hi> our conquest of that, and other great wine-provinces of <hi rend=italics>France,</hi> increased the trade to a high degree, and created great fortunes among the adventurers of this company.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Tower Royal.</placename></NOTE> THE <hi rend=italics>Tower Royal,</hi> which stood in a street of the same name, a little beyond this church, must not pass unnoticed.

Hither the princess <hi rend=italics>Joan,</hi> the royal mother, retired during the time the rebels were committing every excess in all parts of the town; and here the youthful monarch found her, after he had, by his wonderful calmness and prudence, put an end to this pestilential insurrection.<note>The same, ibid.</NOTE>
<p>IN this tower <hi rend=italics>Richard,</hi> in <datestruct value="1386--"><year reg="1386">1386</year></datestruct>, lodged, when his royal guest <hi rend=italics>Leon</hi> III. king of <hi rend=italics>Armenia,</hi> or, as <hi rend=italics>Holinshed</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Holinshed,</hi>

<p>JOHN duke of <hi rend=italics>Norfolk,</hi> the faithful adherent of the usurper <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> III. had a grant of this tower from his master, and made it his residence.<note>Mr. <hi rend=italics>Brooke.</hi></NOTE> In queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth's</hi> time it was turned into tenements and stables.
<p>NEAR the water-side, a little to the west of <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Worcester-place.</placename></NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Vintners-hall,</hi> stood <hi rend=italics>Worcester-place,</hi> the house of the accomplished <hi rend=italics>John Tiptoft,</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Worcester,</hi> lord high treasurer of <hi rend=italics>England.</hi><note>Royal and Noble Authors, i. <num value="59">59</num>.</NOTE> All his love for the sciences could not soften in him the ferocious temper of the unhappy times he lived in.

<pb id="p.473" n="473">
<p>The next place of antiquity, on the banks of the <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Queenhithe.</placename></NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Thames,</hi> is <hi rend=italics>Queen-hithe,</hi> or harbour: its original name was <hi rend=italics>Edred's-hithe,</hi> and it possibly existed in the time of the <hi rend=italics>Saxons.</hi> This was <num value="1">one</num> of the places for large boats, and even ships, to discharge their lading; for there was a draw-bridge in <num value="1">one</num> part of <hi rend=italics>London-bridge,</hi> which was pulled up, occasionally, to admit the passage of large vessels; express care being taken to land corn, fish, and provisions, in different places, for the conveniency of the inhabitants; and other <hi rend=italics>hithes</hi> were appointed for the landing of different merchandise, in order that business might be carried on with regularity. When this <hi rend=italics>hithe</hi> fell into the hands of king <hi rend=italics>Stephen,</hi> he bestowed it on <hi rend=italics>William de Ypres,</hi> who, in his piety, again gave it to the convent of the <hi rend=italics>Holy Trinity,</hi> within <hi rend=italics>Aldgate.</hi> It again fell to the crown, in the time of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> III. and then acquired its present name, being called <hi rend=italics>Ripa Regin&aelig;,</hi> the <hi rend=italics>Queen's Wharf.</hi> That monarch compelled the ships of the Cinque Ports to bring their corn here, and to no other place. It probably was part of her majesty's pin-money, by the attention paid to her interest in the affair.
<p>WHEN I visited this dock, I saw a melancholy proof of the injury trade may sustain by the ruinous state of <hi rend=italics>Blackfriars-bridge,</hi> the result of the bad materials of which part of it has been unhappily composed. A large stone had fallen out of <pb id="p.474" n="474"> its place. A vast barge deeply laden, I think, with corn and malt, struck on this sunk rock, and foundered. It was weighed up, and brought into this place to discharge its damaged cargo.
<p>A LITTLE to the north-west of <hi rend=italics>Queen-hithe,</hi> on <hi rend=italics>Old Fish-street-hill,</hi> stood the inn or town residence of the lords of <hi rend=italics>Mont-hault,</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Mold,</hi> in <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Church of St. Mary Mounthaw.</placename></NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Flintshire.</hi> The present church, named from them <hi rend=italics>St. Mary Mounthaw,</hi> had been their chapel. In <datestruct value="1234--"><year reg="1234">1234</year></datestruct>, the bishop of <hi rend=italics>Hereford</hi> purchased it, and it became his inn, and so continued till <datestruct value="1553"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>, when it was granted to <hi rend=italics>Edward Clinton,</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Lincoln.</hi> In this parish was also the house of <hi rend=italics>Robert Belknap,</hi> <num value="1">one</num> of the judges who was banished by the turbulent lords in the time of <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> II; when it became forfeited, and was granted to <hi rend=italics>William</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Wickham,</hi> bishop of <hi rend=italics>Winchester.</hi>

<p>I CANNOT ascertain the place, but in <hi rend=italics>Thamesstreet,</hi> somewhere to the north-east of <hi rend=italics>St. Paul's</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Beaumont-Inn.</placename></NOTE> wharf, stood <hi rend=italics>Beaumont-Inn,</hi> or house, the residence of the noble family of that name. <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> IV. in <datestruct value="1465--"><year reg="1465">1465</year></datestruct>, presented it to his favorite, the lord <hi rend=italics>Hastings.</hi> On the advancement of his grandson to the earldom of <hi rend=italics>Huntingdon,</hi> it was named after the title of the noble possessors.
<p>IN this neighborhood, near <hi rend=italics>Trig-stairs,</hi> the abbot of <hi rend=italics>Chertsey</hi> had his inn, or city mansion: it <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Sandys-house.</placename></NOTE> was afterwards called <hi rend=italics>Sandys-house,</hi> because it became the residence of the lord <hi rend=italics>Sandys.</hi>
<pb id="p.475" n="475">
<p>NEAR <hi rend=italics>Broken Wharf,</hi> (between <hi rend=italics>Trig-stairs</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Queen-hithe</hi>) was an antient and large building of stone, with arched gates, the residence of <hi rend=italics>Hugh de Bigot,</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Norfolk,</hi> in the time of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> III. In <datestruct value="1916--"><year reg="1916">1916</year></datestruct>, it was possessed by <hi rend=italics>Thomas Brotherton,</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>Norfolk,</hi> and earl-marshal; and in <datestruct value="1432--"><year reg="1432">1432</year></datestruct>, by <hi rend=italics>John Moubray,</hi> also duke of <hi rend=italics>Norfolk.</hi> But in the reign of queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth</hi> it was much more honored, by being the mansion of that opulent and charitable citizen <hi rend=italics>Thomas Sutton,</hi> founder of the <hi rend=italics>Charter-house</hi> hospital, and author of numberless other good deeds.
<p>OPPOSITE to <hi rend=italics>Queen-hithe,</hi> on the south side of <hi rend=italics>Thames-street,</hi> is <hi rend=italics>Little Trinity-lane,</hi> where the company of Painter-stainers have their hall. These <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Painter-stainers-hall.</placename></NOTE> artists formed themselves into a fraternity as early as the reign of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> III. and also erected themselves into a company; but were not incorporated. They styled themselves <hi rend=italics>Painter-stainers;</hi> the chief work being the staining or painting of glass, illuminating missals, or painting of portative or other altars, and now and then a portrait; witness that of <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> II. and those of the great <hi rend=italics>John Talbot</hi> and his wife, preserved at <hi rend=italics>Castle Ashby.</hi><note>Journey to <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> ed. <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>. <num value="419">419</num>.</NOTE> In the year <datestruct value="1575"><year reg="1575">1575</year></datestruct>, they found that plaisterers, and all sorts of unskilful persons, intermeddled in their business, and brought their art into disrepute by the <pb id="p.476" n="476"> badness and slightness of their work. They determined (like the surgeons in later days) to keep their mystery pure from all pretenders. They were incorporated in <datestruct value="1576--"><year reg="1576">1576</year></datestruct>, had their master, warden, and common seal: <hi rend=italics>George Gower</hi> was queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth's</hi> serjeant painter;<note><hi rend=italics>Strype's Stow,</hi> ii. book v. p. <num value="214">214</num>.</NOTE> but, as I do not find his name in Mr. <hi rend=italics>Walpole's</hi> Anecdotes, I suspect his art was confined to the humbler part. This corporation extended only to such artists as practised within the city. As art is unconfined, numbers arose in different parts, and settled in <hi rend=italics>Westminster,</hi> the seat of the court. They for a long time remained totally unconnected even with each other. About the year <datestruct value="1576"><year reg="1576">1576</year></datestruct>, they solicited and received the royal patronage, and were incorporated under the title of master, wardens, and commonalty of <hi rend=italics>Painter-stainers.</hi> The majority are independent of any other body corporate; but several among them are regular freemen of the city under the antient company.
<p>NUMBERS of paintings are preserved here: many of them probably by the members of the society.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Baynard Castle: Burnt and Rebuilt.</NOTE> IN <datestruct value="1428--"><year reg="1428">1428</year></datestruct>, the old castle was burnt: it probably at that time had changed masters, for it was rebuilt by <hi rend=italics>Humphrey</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>Gloucester.</hi> On his death it was granted, by <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VI. to <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>York.</hi> In the important convention of the great men of the kingdom, in <datestruct value="1458--"><year reg="1458">1458</year></datestruct>, the prelude to the bloody civil broils, <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> lodged here with his train of <num value="400">four hundred</num> men; and all his noble partizans had their warlike suite.
<p>BUT <hi rend=italics>Baynard Castle</hi> was the scene of a still more important action; in <datestruct value="1460--"><year reg="1460">1460</year></datestruct>, the youthful <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> assumed the name and dignity of king, confirmed by a number of persons of rank assembled <pb id="p.483" n="483"> in this place, after it had been conferred on him by a mixed and tumultuary multitude.
<p>THE usurper <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> in the very same castle took on him the title of king. Here he was waited on by his creature <hi rend=italics>Buckingham,</hi> the mayor, and such of the citizens as had been prepared for the purpose of forcing the crown on the seemingly reluctant hypocrite. SHAKESPEARE has made an admirable scene out of this part of our history.<note><hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> III. act iii. sc. vii.</NOTE> His successor repaired, or perhaps rebuilt, <hi rend=italics>Baynard Castle;</hi> and, as if foreseeing a long series of peaceful years, changed its form into that of a palace for quiet times.<note>From an old survey of <hi rend=italics>London.</hi></NOTE> According to the view of it which I have seen, it included a square court, with an octagonal tower in the center, and <num value="2">two</num> in the front; between which were several square projections from top to bottom, with the windows in pairs <num value="1">one</num> above the other; beneath was a bridge and stairs to the river.
<p>HENRY VII. often resided here, and from hence made several of his solemn processions. Here, in <datestruct value="1505--"><year reg="1505">1505</year></datestruct>, he lodged <hi rend=italics>Philip</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Austria,</hi> the matrimonial king of <hi rend=italics>Castile,</hi> tempest-driven into his dominions, and shewed him the pomp and glory of his capital.<note><hi rend=italics>Holinshed,</hi>

<p>THIS castle was the residence of Sir <hi rend=italics>William Sydney,</hi> who died chamberlain and steward to <pb id="p.484" n="484"> <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> VI. In this place <hi rend=italics>Mary,</hi> the gloomy queen of <hi rend=italics>Philip</hi> II. of <hi rend=italics>Spain,</hi> had her right to the throne resolved on; and from hence her partizans sallied forth to proclame her lawful title. It was then the property and residence of <hi rend=italics>William Herbert,</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Pembroke,</hi> a particular favorer of the rightful heir. Her successor, <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth,</hi> did his lordship the honor of supping with him: after supper, her majesty went on the water to shew herself to her subjects; her barge was instantly surrounded by hundreds of boats; loud acclamations delivered from the heart, music, and fireworks testified the happiness they felt at the sight of this mother of her people. Early hours were then the fashion, for, notwithstanding this scene was exhibited on the <num value="25">25th</num> of <hi rend=italics>April,</hi> she retired to her palace at <num value="10">10</num> o'clock.<note><hi rend=italics>Strype's Annals.</hi></NOTE> The family of the earls of <hi rend=italics>Shrewsbury</hi> resided in the castle till it was burnt in the great fire.

In early times, the southern side was guarded by a wall, close to the river, strengthened with towers. These are mentioned by <hi rend=italics>Fitzstephens</hi> as having been ruined and undermined by the river. Lord <hi rend=italics>Lyttelton</hi> justly observes, that after the building of the <hi rend=italics>Tower</hi> and the bridge, there was no necessity of restoring these fortifications; as it was impossible (at lest after the bridge was flung across the <hi rend=italics>Thames</hi>) for any fleet to annoy the city. The wall originally stood farther from the river than the present buildings and wharfs, a considerable space between the street and the water having been gained in a long series of ages.
<p>NOT far from <hi rend=italics>Puddle Dock,</hi> in old times, stood an antient house of stone and timber, built by the lords of <hi rend=italics>Berkeley,</hi> a potent race of barons.

<p>In prose, the <hi rend=italics>College of Physicians;</hi> a society founded originally by Doctor <hi rend=italics>Linacre,</hi> the <num value="1">first</num> who rescued the medical art from the hands of illiterate monks and empirics. The college was <num value="1">first</num> in <hi rend=italics>Knight-rider-street;</hi> afterward it was removed to <hi rend=italics>Amen Corner;</hi> and finally fixed here. The present building was the work of Sir <hi rend=italics>Christopher Wren.</hi> On the top of the dome is a gilt ball, which the witty <hi rend=italics>Garth</hi> calls the gilded pill.

<p>ON <num value="1">one</num> side of the court is a statue of <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> II. on the opposite, that of the notorious Sir <hi rend=italics>John Cutler.</hi> I was greatly at a loss to learn how so much respect was shewn to a character so stigmatized for avarice. I think myself much indebted to Doctor WARREN for the extraordinary history. It appears, by the annals of the college, that in the year <datestruct value="1674"><year reg="1674">1674</year></datestruct>, a considerable sum of money had been subscribed by the fellows, for the erection of a new college, the old <num value="1">one</num> having been consumed in the great fire, <num value="8">eight</num> years before. It also appears, that Sir <hi rend=italics>John Cutler,</hi> a near relation of Doctor <hi rend=italics>Whistler,</hi> the president, was desirous of becoming a benefactor. A committee was appointed to wait upon Sir <hi rend=italics>John,</hi> to thank him for his kind intentions. He accepted their thanks, renewed his promise, and specified the part of the building of which he intended to bear the expence. In the year <datestruct value="1680"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>, statues in honor of the king, and Sir <hi rend=italics>John,</hi> were voted by the members: and <num value="9">nine</num> years afterward, the college being then completed, it was resolved to borrow money of Sir <hi rend=italics>John Cutler,</hi> to discharge the college debt, but the sum is not specified. It appears, however, that in <datestruct value="1699--"><year reg="1699">1699</year></datestruct>, Sir <hi rend=italics>John's</hi> executors made a demand on the college of <num value="7000">7000</num><hi rend=italics>l.;</hi> which sum was supposed to include the money actually lent, the money pretended to be given, but set down as a debt in Sir <hi rend=italics>John's</hi> books, and <pb id="p.488" n="488"> the interest on both. Lord <hi rend=italics>Radnor,</hi> however and Mr. <hi rend=italics>Boulter,</hi> Sir <hi rend=italics>John Cutler's</hi> executors, were prevaled upon to accept <num value="2000">2000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> from the college, and actually remitted the other <num value="5">five</num>. So that Sir <hi rend=italics>John's</hi> promise, which he never performed, obtained him the statue, and the liberality of his executors has kept it in its place ever since. But the college wisely have obliterated the inscription, which, in the warmth of its gratitude, it had placed beneath the figure:

His opinion, that there had been a church on this spot, built by the Christians in the time of the <hi rend=italics>Romans,</hi> was confirmed: when he searched for the foundations for his own design, he met with those of the original <hi rend=italics>presbyterium,</hi> or semicircular chancel of the old church.

<p>THE <num value="1">first</num> church is supposed to have been destroyed in the <hi rend=italics>Dioclesian</hi> persecution, and to have been rebuilt in the reign of <hi rend=italics>Constantine.</hi> This was again demolished by the pagan <hi rend=italics>Saxons;</hi> and <pb id="p.495" n="495"> restored, in <num value="603">603</num>, by <hi rend=italics>Sebert,</hi> a petty prince, ruling in these parts under <hi rend=italics>Ethelbert</hi> king of <hi rend=italics>Kent,</hi> the <num value="1">first</num> Christian monarch of the <hi rend=italics>Saxon</hi> race; who, at the instance of <hi rend=italics>St. Augustin,</hi> appointed <hi rend=italics>Melitus</hi> the <num value="1">first</num> bishop of <hi rend=italics>London. Erkenwald,</hi> the son of king <hi rend=italics>Offa,</hi> <num value="4">fourth</num> in succession from <hi rend=italics>Melitus,</hi> ornamented his cathedral very highly, and improved the revenues with his own patrimony. He was most deservedly canonized; for the very litter in which he was carried in his last illness, continued many centuries to cure fevers by the touch; and the very chips, carried to the sick, restored them to health.
<p>WHEN the city of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> was destroyed by fire, in <datestruct value="1086--"><year reg="1086">1086</year></datestruct>, this church was burnt; the bishop <hi rend=italics>Mauritius</hi> began to rebuild it, and laid the foundation, which remained till its <num value="2">second</num> destruction, from the same cause, in the last century. Notwithstanding <hi rend=italics>Mauritius</hi> lived <num value="20">twenty</num> years after he had begun this pious work, and bishop <hi rend=italics>Beauines,</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Belmeis,</hi> enjoyed the see <num value="20">twenty</num> more, yet, such was the grandeur of the design, that it remained unfinished. The <num value="1">first</num> had the ruins of the <hi rend=italics>Palatine</hi> tower bestowed on him, as materials for the building: and <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> I. bestowed on the same prelate part of the ditch belonging to the <hi rend=italics>Tower,</hi> which, with purchases made by himself, enabled him to inclose the whole with a wall. The same <pb id="p.496" n="496"> monarch granted besides, that every ship, which brought stone for the church, should be exempted from toll; he gave him also all the great fishes taken in his precincts, except the tongues; and lastly, he secured to him and his successor, the delicious tythes of all his venison in the county of <hi rend=italics>Essex.</hi>

<p>It is to be lamented that this beautiful thought should be flung away in the most darksome nook of the whole fabrick.

<p>THIS cloister, the dance, and innumerable fine monuments (for here were crowded by far the most superb) fell victims to the sacrilege of the protector <hi rend=italics>Somerset,</hi> who demolished the whole, and carried the materials to his palace then erecting in the <hi rend=italics>Strand.</hi>

<p>WE may be astonished at this amazing building, and naturally enquire what fund could supply money to support so vast an expence. But monarchs resigned their revenues resulting from the customs due for the materials, which were brought to the adjacent wharfs; they furnished wood from the royal forests: prelates gave up much of their revenues: and, what was more than all, the pious bait of indulgences, and remissions of penance, brought in, from the good people of this realm, most amazing sums. Pope <hi rend=italics>Innocent</hi> III. in <datestruct value="1252--"><year reg="1252">1252</year></datestruct>, gave a release of <num value="60">sixty</num> days <pb id="p.501" n="501"> penance: the archbishop of <hi rend=italics>Cologne</hi> gave, a few years before, a relaxation of <num value="50">fifty</num> days: <hi rend=italics>Boniface,</hi> archbishop of <hi rend=italics>Canterbury,</hi> <num value="40">forty</num> days.

<p>IT will be endless to enumerate the altars of this <NOTE PLACE=MARG>The High altar.</NOTE> vast temple, numerous as those of the <hi rend=italics>Pantheon.</hi> I content myself with the mention of the <hi rend=italics>High Altar,</hi> which dazzled with gems and gold, the gifts of its numerous votaries. <hi rend=italics>John,</hi> king of <hi rend=italics>France,</hi> when prisoner in <hi rend=italics>England,</hi> <num value="1">first</num> paying his respects to <hi rend=italics>St. Erkenwald's</hi> shrine, offered <num value="4">four</num> basons of gold: and the gifts at the obsequies of princes, foreign and <hi rend=italics>British,</hi> were of immense value. On the day of the conversion of the tutelar saint, the <pb id="p.508" n="508"> charities were prodigious, <num value="1">first</num> to the souls, when an indulgence of <num value="40">forty</num> days pardon was given, <hi rend=italics>ver&egrave; p&oelig;nitentibus, contritis et confessis;</hi> and, by order of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> III. <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> tapers were placed in the church, and <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> poor people fed in the church-yard.
<p>BUT the most singular offering was that of a fat <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Singular offering.</NOTE> doe in winter, and a buck in summer, made at the high altar, on the day of the commemoration of the saint, by Sir <hi rend=italics>William de Baude</hi> and his family, and then to be distributed among the canons resident.

Till queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth's</hi> days, the doe or buck was received solemnly, at the steps of the high altar, by the dean and chapter, attired in their sacred vestments, and crowned with garlands of roses. &ldquo;They sent the body of the bucke to baking, and had the head, fixed on a pole, borne before the crosse in the procession, untill they issued out of the west doore, where the keeper that brought it blowed the deathe of the bucke, and then the horners, that were about the citie, presently answered him in like manner; for which paines they had each man, of the deane and chapter, <measure value="4d." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> pence</measure> in money, and their dinner; and the keeper that brought it was allowed, during his abode there, for his service, meate, drinke, and lodging, and <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure> in <pb id="p.509" n="509"> money at his going away, together with a loafe of breade having the picture of <hi rend=italics>St. Paul</hi> upon it.&rdquo;<note><hi rend=italics>Warton's</hi> Hist. of Poetry, ii. <num value="390">390</num>.</NOTE>
<p>THE boys of <hi rend=italics>St. Paul's</hi> were famous for acting <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Mysteries.</NOTE> the mysteries or holy plays, and even regular dramas.

<p>THE holiness of this place did not prevent thieves and profligates of all denominations lurking within the precincts, and committing, under favor of the night, murders and every sort of crime. <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> I. gave the dean and canons permission to <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Church, and Buildings Belonging to it, inclosed With A Wall.</NOTE> inclose the whole within a wall; and to have gates to be shut every night, to exclude all disorderly people.

<p>IN the reign of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> VI. the queen dowager of <hi rend=italics>Scotland</hi> was here entertained. The dean's house, and the houses of the prebendaries and residentiaries, were on the opposite side; and, in those days of plain living, kept great housholds and liberal hospitality.<note>The same.</NOTE>
<p>BEFORE this cathedral was the famous <hi rend=italics>Paul's</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Paul's Cross.</placename></NOTE> <hi rend=italics>Cross,</hi> a pulpit formed of wood, mounted upon steps of stone, and covered with lead, in which the <pb id="p.512" n="512"> most eminent divines were appointed to preach every <hi rend=italics>Sunday</hi> in the forenoon. To this place, the court, the mayor and aldermen, and principal citizens, used to resort. The greatest part of the congregation sat in the open air; the king and his train had covered galleries; and the better sort of people, if I may judge from the old prints, were also protected from the injury of the weather; but the far greater part stood exposed in the open air: for which reason the preacher went, in very bad weather, <NOTE PLACE=MARG>The Shrowds.</NOTE> to a place called the <hi rend=italics>Shrowds;</hi> a covered space on the side of the church, to protect the congregation in inclement seasons. Considerable contributions were raised, among the nobility and citizens, to support such preachers as were (as was often the case) called to town from either of the universities. In particular, the lord mayor and aldermen ordered that every preacher, who came from a distance, should be freely accommodated, during <num value="5">five</num> days, with sweet and convenient lodgings, fire, candle, and all necessaries. And notice was given by the bishop of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> to the preacher appointed by him, of the place he was to repair to.
<p>THE origin of the custom of preaching at crosses, was probably accidental. The sanctity of this species of pillar often caused a great resort of people, to pay their devotion to the object of their erection. A preacher, seeing a large concourse, <pb id="p.513" n="513"> might be seized by a sudden impulse, ascend the steps, and deliver his pious advice from a station so fit to inspire attention, and so conveniently formed for the purpose. The example might be followed, till the practice became established by custom.
<p>IT certainly at <num value="1">first</num> was a common cross, and coeval with the church. When it was <num value="1">first</num> covered, and converted into a pulpit-cross, we are not informed. We are given to understand that it was overthrown by an earthquake in <datestruct value="1382--"><year reg="1382">1382</year></datestruct>, and that <hi rend=italics>William Courtney,</hi> then archbishop of <hi rend=italics>Canterbury,</hi> collected great sums for rebuilding it; which, says dean <hi rend=italics>Nowel,</hi> in a sermon he preached at this cross, he applied to his own use. <hi rend=italics>Courtney</hi> was a most munificent prelate, and not likely to abuse the charity of his flock; yet it was not rebuilt till the time of <hi rend=italics>Thomas Kemp,</hi> elected bishop of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> in <datestruct value="1449--"><year reg="1449">1449</year></datestruct>, who finished it in the form, says <hi rend=italics>Godwin,</hi> in which we see it at present;<note><hi rend=italics>Pr&aelig;sul. Angl.</hi> <num value="248">248</num>.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Godwin</hi> published his book in <datestruct value="1616--"><year reg="1616">1616</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> and so it stood till it was demolished, in <datestruct value="1643--"><year reg="1643">1643</year></datestruct>, by an order of parlement, executed by the willing hands of <hi rend=italics>Isaac Pennington,</hi> the fanatical lord mayor of that year, who died in the <hi rend=italics>Tower,</hi> a convicted regicide.
<p>WE hear of this cross being in use as early as the year <datestruct value="1259"><year reg="1259">1259</year></datestruct>. It was used not only for the instruction of mankind, by the doctrine of the preacher, <pb id="p.514" n="514"> but for every purpose political or ecclesiastical: for giving force to oaths, for promulging laws, or rather the royal pleasure: for the emission of papal bulls, for anathematizing sinners, for benedictions, for exposing penitents under censure of the church, for recantations, for the private ends of the ambitious, and for the defaming of those who had incurred the displeasure of crowned heads.
<p>IN <datestruct value="1259--"><year reg="1259">1259</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> III. commanded the lord mayor to swear, before the aldermen, every person of <num value="12">twelve</num> years and upwards, to be true to him and his heirs.
<p>In <datestruct value="1262--"><year reg="1262">1262</year></datestruct>, the same monarch caused the bull of <hi rend=italics>Urban</hi> IV. to be here made public, as an absolution of him and his adherents, who had sworn to observe the <hi rend=italics>Oxford</hi> provisions, made in the violent meeting at that city in <datestruct value="1258--"><year reg="1258">1258</year></datestruct>, called the <hi rend=italics>mad</hi> parlement.
<p>HERE, in <datestruct value="1299--"><year reg="1299">1299</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>Ralph de Baldoc,</hi> dean of <hi rend=italics>St. Paul's,</hi> cursed all those who had searched, in the church of <hi rend=italics>St. Martin in the Fields,</hi> for a hoard of gold, &amp;c.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>The Penance of Jane Shore.</NOTE> BEFORE this cross, in <datestruct value="1483--"><year reg="1483">1483</year></datestruct>, was brought, divested of all her splendor, <hi rend=italics>Jane Shore,</hi> the charitable, the merry concubine of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> IV. and, after his death, of his favorite, the unfortunate lord <hi rend=italics>Hastings.</hi> After the loss of her protectors, she fell a victim to the malice of crook-backed <hi rend=italics>Richard.</hi> He was disappointed (by her excellent <pb id="p.515" n="515"> defence) of convicting her of witchcraft, and confederating with her lover to destroy him. He then attacked her on the weak side of frailty. This was undeniable. He consigned her to the severity of the church: she was carried to the bishop's palace, cloathed in a white sheet, with a taper in her hand, and from thence conducted to the cathedral, and the cross, before which she made a confession of her only fault. Every other virtue bloomed in this ill-fated fair with the fullest vigour. She could not resist the solicitations of a youthful monarch, the handsomest man of his time. On his death she was reduced to necessity, scorned by the world, and cast off by her husband, with whom she was paired in her childish years, and forced to fling herself into the arms of <hi rend=italics>Hastings.</hi>
&ldquo;In her penance she went,&rdquo; says <hi rend=italics>Holinshed,</hi> &ldquo;in countenance and pase demure, so womanlie, that, albeit she were out of all araie, save her kirtle onlie, yet went she so faire and lovelie, namelie, while the woondering of the people cast a comelie rud in hir cheeks, (of whiche she before had most misse) that hir great shame wan hir much praise among those that were more amorous of hir bodie than curious of hir soule. And manie good folkes that hated hir living, (and glad were to see sin corrected) yet pitied they more hir penance, than rejoised therin, when they considered that the Protector <pb id="p.516" n="516"> procured it more of a corrupt intent, than anie virtuous affection.&rdquo;<note><hi rend=italics>Holinshed,</hi>

<p>ROWE has clothed this part of her sad story in the following poetical dress; but it is far from depreciating the moving simplicity of the old historian.
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Submissive, sad, and lowly was her look;
<L>A burning taper in her hand she bore,
<L>And on her shoulders carelessly confus'd,
<L>With loose neglect, her lovely tresses hung;
<L>Upon her cheek a faintish flush was spread;
<L>Feeble she seem'd, and sorely smit with pain,
<L>While, barefoot as she trod the flinty pavement,
<L>Her footsteps all along were mark'd with blood.
<L>Yet silent still she pass'd, and unrepining;
<L>Her streaming eyes bent ever on the earth,
<L>Except when, in some bitter pang of sorrow,
<L>To Heav'n she seem'd in fervent zeal to raise,
<L>And beg that mercy man deny'd her here.</QUOTE>

<p>THE poet has adopted the fable of her being denied all sustenance, and of her perishing with hunger; but that was not fact. She lived to an advanced age, but in great distress and miserable poverty; deserted even by those to whom she had, during prosperity, done the most essential services. She dragged a wretched life, to the time of Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas More,</hi> who introduces her story into his life of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> V. The beauty of her person is spoken of in high terms: &ldquo;Proper she was, and faire: nothing in hir bodie that you would have <pb id="p.517" n="517"> changed; but you would have wished hir somewhat higher. Thus saie they that knew hir in hir youth.&mdash;Now is she old, leane, withered, and dried up; nothing left but rivelled skin and hard bone; and yet, being even such, who so well advise her visage, might gesse and devise, which parts how filled would make it a faire face.&rdquo;<note><hi rend=italics>Holinshed,</hi>

<p>THE late ingenious the Reverend <hi rend=italics>Michael Tyson</hi> made me a present of an etching of this unfortunate fair, done from the supposed original in the provost's lodgings, in <hi rend=italics>King's College, Cambridge.</hi> Her hair is curled in short curls high above her neck, and mixed with chains of jewels set in a lozenge form: her neck and body, as far beneath her arms, are naked; the <num value="1">first</num> has <num value="2">two</num> strings of pearls hanging loose round it: over her shoulders is a rich chain of jewels set in circles, and pendant from the middle, which hangs down her breast, is a rich lozenge of jewels, and to each link is affixed <num value="1">one</num> or more pearls. In her countenance is no appearance of charms; she must have attracted the hearts of her lovers by her intellectual beauties.
<p>FOR my part, I entertain doubts as to the authenticity of this portrait: but am clear that the elegant engraving given in Mr. <hi rend=italics>Harding's</hi> Illustrations <pb id="p.518" n="518"> of <hi rend=italics>Shakespeare</hi> by Prints, N&deg; IV. is taken from a picture of some beauty of the succeeding century.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Prostitute Preachers.</NOTE> UNDER her cruel prosecutor, this pulpit-cross became the seat of prostituted eloquence.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>The Reformation Preached From Hence.</NOTE> THE reign of queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth</hi> was wisely ushered in by the appointment of good and able men to preach from this Cross the doctrine of the Reformation, and rejection of the Papal power;<note><hi rend=italics>Strype's Annals,</hi> i. <num value="133">133</num>.</NOTE> in which politics were naturally intermixed.

From the usual policy of <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth,</hi> it is possible the sermon and order were both preconcerted; the moment of devotion being the aptest to inspire zeal, and promote an enthusiastic ardor in the people to fly to a standard raised against a nation so detested, and so inimical to our religion and liberties, as the <hi rend=italics>Spaniards.</hi>

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>James I. Hears a Sermon at the Cross.</NOTE> THE last sermon which was preached at this place, was before <hi rend=italics>James</hi> I. who came in great state on horseback from <hi rend=italics>Whitehall,</hi> on <hi rend=italics>Midlent Sunday,</hi>

<p>I WILL pass unnoticed the preceding misfortunes <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Spire of the Church Burnt.</NOTE> which this cathedral has experienced, and only mention the last, previous to its final destruction by the great fire. In <datestruct value="1561--"><year reg="1561">1561</year></datestruct>, the noble spire was totally burnt by lightning; or, as others say, by the carelessness of a workman, who made a confession of it on his death-bed. After this it never was restored. This circumstance shews the date of <datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>, to <hi rend=italics>Aggas's</hi> famous survey of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> to have been erroneous: he having represented the church without the spire; which he never could have omitted, had it existed at that time.
<p>IN consequence of the resolutions taken in <datestruct value="1620--"><year reg="1620">1620</year></datestruct>, by <hi rend=italics>James</hi> I. to repair the cathedral, the celebrated <hi rend=italics>Inigo Jones</hi> was appointed to the work. But it was not attempted till the year <datestruct value="1633"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>, when <hi rend=italics>Laud</hi> laid the <num value="1">first</num> stone, and <hi rend=italics>Inigo</hi> the <num value="4">fourth</num>. That great architect began with the most notorious impropriety, that of adding a portico of the <hi rend=italics>Corinthian</hi> order (beautiful indeed in itself) to the west end of this antient gothic pile;<note><hi rend=italics>Parentalia,</hi>

The great fire made way for the restoration of this magnificent pile by Sir CHRISTOPHER <pb id="p.524" n="524"> WREN, surveyor general of his majesty's works, an architect worthy of so great an undertaking.

He had in it an eye to the loss of the <hi rend=italics>Pulpit-cross,</hi> and had supplied its place by a magnificent auditory within, for the reception of a large congregation. This was approved by men of excellent judgment, but laid aside under the notion that it had not sufficiently a temple-like form. A <num value="2">second</num> was made, selected out of various sketches he had drawn; on this design Sir <hi rend=italics>Christopher</hi> set a high value: but this also was rejected.<note><hi rend=italics>Parentalia,</hi>
<num value="282">282</num>.</NOTE> The <num value="3">third</num>, which produced the present noble pile, was approved and executed. A singular accident happened at the beginning: while the great architect was setting out the dimensions of the dome, he ordered a common laborer to bring him a flat stone, to be laid as a direction to the masons; he brought a fragment of a gravestone, on which was the word RESURGAM. This was not lost on Sir <pb id="p.525" n="525"> <hi rend=italics>Christopher;</hi> he caught the idea of the <hi rend=italics>Ph&oelig;nix,</hi> which he placed on the south <hi rend=italics>portico,</hi> with that word cut beneath.

The church of <hi rend=italics>St. Peter</hi> was a <num value="135">hundred and thirty-five</num> years in building, in the reigns of <num value="19">nineteen</num> popes, and went through the hands of <num value="12">twelve</num> architects. <hi rend=italics>St. Paul's</hi> is not, as is often supposed, built after the model of that famous temple: it is the entire conception of our great countryman; and has been preferred in some respects, by a judicious writer, to even the <hi rend=italics>Roman Basilica.</hi> Its dimensions are smaller. A comparative view of them is given in the <hi rend=italics>Parentalia,</hi> and copied in <hi rend=italics>London and its Environs.</hi>&mdash;I will only mention the great outlines:&mdash;The height of <hi rend=italics>St. Peter's,</hi> to the top of the cross, is <num value="437">four hundred and thirty-seven</num> feet and a half; that of <hi rend=italics>St. Paul's,</hi>
<pb id="p.526" n="526"> <num value="340">three hundred and forty</num> feet: so that, from its situation, it is lofty enough to be seen from the sea.

<p>I AM sorry to relate that our great architect, to whom our capital was so highly indebted, was, in <datestruct value="1718--"><year reg="1718">1718</year></datestruct>, dismissed from his employ (which he had for the space of <num value="50">fifty</num> years most honorably discharged) in favor of Mr. <hi rend=italics>Benson,</hi> whose demerits became soon so apparent, as to occasion his almost immediate removal.

<p>IN the reigns of <hi rend=italics>James</hi> I. and <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> I. the body of this cathedral was the common resort of the politicians, the news-mongers, and idle in general.

The visitants are all men, without exceptions; but the principall inhabitants and possessors are stale knights, and captaines out of service; men of long rapiers and breeches, which after all turne merchants here, and trafficke for newes.

<p>IN digging the foundation for the rebuilding of this cathedral, it was discovered, beneath the graves mentioned at p. <num value="13">13</num>, that the foundation of the old church rested on a layer of hard and close pot earth. Curiosity led Sir <hi rend=italics>Christopher Wren</hi> to search farther. He found that on the north side it was <num value="6">six</num> feet thick, that it grew thinner towards the south, and on the decline of the hill was scarcely <num value="4">four</num>. On advancing farther, he met with <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Marine Strata.</NOTE> nothing but loose sand; at length he came to <pb id="p.530" n="530"> water and sand mixed with periwinkles, and other sea-shells; and, by boring, came at last to the beach, and under that the natural hard clay: which evinced that the sea had once occupied the space on which St. <hi rend=italics>Paul's</hi> now stands. This sand had been <num value="1">one</num> of those sand-hills frequent on many coasts, not only on those of <hi rend=italics>Holland</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Flanders,</hi> but on our own. It was the opinion of our great architect, that all the space between <hi rend=italics>Camberwell</hi> hill and the hills of <hi rend=italics>Essex</hi> had been a vast bay, at low-water a sandy plain.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Doctors Commons.</placename></NOTE> To the south of this cathedral are the college of civilians, or Doctors Commons, the court of arches, the court of delegates, and several others, the great satellites of the church.

Sometimes it has cost them their nose and ears, and sometimes their heads.

<p>ST. <hi rend=italics>Dunstan</hi> appears here in canvas, in a rich robe, and with his crosier. The unfortunate devil is not forgotten, roaring between the pincers of the saint; with the heavenly host above, applauding the deed.

<p>QUEEN <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth</hi> presented this company with a silver cup, out of which annual libations are made to her memory. She was particularly kind to the citizens, and borrowed money of them on all occasions. The Goldsmiths must of course have enjoyed a distinguished place in her esteem.
<p>THIS company appeared as a fraternity as early as <datestruct value="1180"><year reg="1180">1180</year></datestruct>, being then amerced for being <hi rend=italics>adulterine,</hi> or for setting up without the king's licence. In the reign of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> III. they obtained a patent, and were incorporated for the sum of <measure value="10bmark" type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> marks</measure>. <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> II. confirmed the same, in consideration of the sum of <measure value="20bmark" type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> marks</measure>. They increased in wealth, and have left evident marks of charity, by having above a <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">thousand</num> pounds</measure> a year to dispose of for benevolent purposes. They became in time the bankers of the capital. The <hi rend=italics>Lombards</hi> were the <num value="1">first</num> and the greatest, and most of the money contracts in old times passed through their hands. Many of our monarchs were obliged to them for money. They did not seem to like trusting <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> IV. on his bond, so took the customs in pawn for their loan.
<p>THE business of goldsmiths was confined to the buying and selling of plate, and foreign coins of gold and silver, melting them, and coining others at the mint. The banking was accidental, and foreign to their institution.
<p>REGULAR banking by private people resulted, <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Bankers.</NOTE> <pb id="p.538" n="538"> in <datestruct value="1643--"><year reg="1643">1643</year></datestruct>, from the calamity of the time, when the seditious spirit was incited by the arts of the parliamentary leaders. The merchants and tradesmen, who before trusted their cash to their servants and apprentices, found that no longer safe; neither did they dare to leave it in the mint at the <hi rend=italics>Tower,</hi> by reason of the distresses of majesty itself, which before was a place of public deposit. In the year <datestruct value="1645"><year reg="1645">1645</year></datestruct>, they <num value="1">first</num> placed their cash in the hands of goldsmiths, who then began publicly to exercise both professions. Even in my days were several very eminent bankers, who kept the goldsmiths shop: but they were more frequently separated. The <num value="1">first</num> regular banker was Mr. <hi rend=italics>Francis Child,</hi> goldsmith, who began business soon after the Restoration. He was the father of the profession, a person of large fortune and most respectable character. He married, between the years <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg=1665>1665</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg=1675>1675</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>Martha,</hi> only daughter of <hi rend=italics>Robert Blanchard,</hi> citizen and goldsmith, by whom he had <num value="12">twelve</num> children. Mr. <hi rend=italics>Child</hi> was afterward knighted. He lived in <hi rend=italics>Fleet-street,</hi> where the shop still continues,<note>For these particulars I am obliged to the civility of Mr. <hi rend=italics>Dent,</hi> partner in this great shop.</NOTE> in a state of the highest respectability. Mr. <hi rend=italics>Granger</hi><note>Vol. iii. <num value="410">410</num>.</NOTE> mentions Mr. <hi rend=italics>Child</hi> as successor to the shop of alderman <hi rend=italics>Backwel,</hi> a banker in the time of <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> II. noted <pb id="p.539" n="539"> for his integrity, abilities, and industry; who was ruined by the shutting up of the exchequer in <datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>. His books were placed in the hands of Mr. <hi rend=italics>Child,</hi> and still remain in the family.
<p>THE next antient shop was that possessed at present by Messrs. <hi rend=italics>Snow</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Denne,</hi> a few doors to the west of Mr. <hi rend=italics>Child's:</hi> who were goldsmiths of consequence in the latter part of the same reign.

<p>THE old church of <hi rend=italics>Bow</hi> was founded in the time of <hi rend=italics>William</hi> the Conqueror; we have before given the origin of the name, which was from the arches of the foundation, not of the steeple, which was rebuilt with arches, or in a crown fashion, but not till long after the year <datestruct value="1512"><year reg="1512">1512</year></datestruct>.<note><hi rend=italics>Newcourt's Repertorium,</hi> i. <num value="437">437</num>.</NOTE> The church <pb id="p.548" n="548"> was long a noted sanctuary, and <num value="1">one</num> of those which <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. in his <num value="32">thirty-second</num> year, exempted from suppression. In this place, in <datestruct value="1196--"><year reg="1196">1196</year></datestruct>, <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Story of Fitz-Osbert.</NOTE> <num value="1">one</num> <hi rend=italics>William Fitz-Osbert,</hi> alias <hi rend=italics>Long Beard,</hi> a seditious fellow of uncommon eloquence, but of the lowest rank, set up as advocate for the poor citizens against the oppressions of the rich. He took an opportunity of beginning a tumult by inflaming their minds against a certain tax, raised entirely for the necessities of the state. Many lives were lost on the occasion, at <hi rend=italics>St. Paul's. Hubert,</hi> the great justiciary, summoned <hi rend=italics>Long Beard</hi> to appear before him; but found him so well supported, that he thought it prudent to forbear punishment. This served but to increase his insolence. He grew so outrageous, that the citizens were resolved to bring him to justice: a resolute band made the attempt, when he and a few desperate fellows fled to the tower of <hi rend=italics>Bow</hi> steeple, which they fortified. The besiegers, seeing the mob assemble from all parts for his rescue, made a fire at the bottom, which forced him and his companions to sally out; but they were taken, and the next day he and <num value="8">eight</num> more were dragged by their heels to the <hi rend=italics>Elms</hi> at <hi rend=italics>Smithfield,</hi> and there hanged. Long after those days the hurdle, or the sledge, was permitted, as a sort of indulgence to the wretched sufferers.<note><hi rend=italics>Blackstone's Comm.</hi> ed. <num value="4">4</num>. <num value="4">4</num>to. vol. iv. pp. <num value="92">92</num>. <num value="370">370</num>.</NOTE> It was said, that finding <pb id="p.549" n="549"> himself deserted by Heaven, he at the gallows &ldquo;forsook <hi rend=italics>Mary's</hi> Son (as he called our SAVIOUR), and called upon the <hi rend=italics>Devil</hi> to helpe and deliver him.&rdquo; Yet, notwithstanding this, a cunning priest, a relation of his, stole his body, and pretended many miracles were wrought at the place of execution; and many persons passed the night on the spot which deprived them of a <hi rend=italics>martyr,</hi> who died supporting the majesty of the people, as <hi rend=italics>Thomas Becket</hi> did that of the pope.
<p>IN the middle of <hi rend=italics>Cheapside,</hi> a little to the west <NOTE PLACE=MARG>The Cross.</NOTE> of <hi rend=italics>Bow church,</hi> stood the cross and the conduit. The <num value="1">first</num> was <num value="1">one</num> of the affectionate tokens of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> I. towards his queen <hi rend=italics>Eleanor,</hi> built where her body rested in its way to interment, in <datestruct value="1290--"><year reg="1290">1290</year></datestruct>. It had originally the statue of the queen, and in all respects resembled that at <hi rend=italics>Northampton;</hi> at length, falling to decay, it was rebuilt, in <datestruct value="1441--"><year reg="1441">1441</year></datestruct>, by <hi rend=italics>John Hutherby,</hi> mayor of the city, at the expence of several of the citizens. It was ornamented with various images, such as that of the Resurrection, of the <hi rend=italics>Virgin,</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> the Confessor, and the like. At every public entry it was new gilt; for the magnificent processions took this road. After the Reformation, the images gave much offence; the goddess <hi rend=italics>Diana</hi> was substituted instead of the <hi rend=italics>Virgin,</hi> when the symbols of superstition had been frequently mutilated. Queen <pb id="p.550" n="550"> <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth</hi> disapproved of those attacks on the remnants of the old religion, and offered a large reward for the discovery of the offenders. She thought that a plain cross, the mark of the religion of the country, ought not to be the occasion of any scandal; so directed that <num value="1">one</num> should be placed on the summit, and gilt.<note><hi rend=italics>Stow's Survaie,</hi> <num value="485">485</num>.</NOTE> Superstition is certain, in course of time, to take the other extreme.

<p>THE <hi rend=italics>Nag's-head</hi> tavern, almost opposite to the <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Nag's Head Tavern.</placename></NOTE> cross, was the fictitious scene of consecration of the Protestant bishops, at the accession of queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth,</hi> in <datestruct value="1559--"><year reg="1559">1559</year></datestruct>. It was pretended by the adversaries of our religion, that a certain number of ecclesiastics, in their hurry to take possession of the vacant sees, assembled here, where they were to undergo the ceremony from <hi rend=italics>Anthony Kitchen,</hi> alias <hi rend=italics>Dustan,</hi> bishop of <hi rend=italics>Landaff,</hi> a sort of occasional conformist, who had taken the oaths of supremacy to <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth. Bonner,</hi> bishop of <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> (then confined in the Tower) hearing of it, sent his chaplain to <hi rend=italics>Kitchen,</hi> threatening him with excommunication, in case he proceeded. The prelate therefore refused to perform the ceremony: on which, say the Catholics, <hi rend=italics>Parker</hi> and the other candidates, rather than defer possession of their dioceses, determined to consecrate <num value="1">one</num> another; which, says the story, they did without any sort of scruple, and <hi rend=italics>Scorey</hi> began with <hi rend=italics>Parker,</hi> who instantly rose archbishop of <hi rend=italics>Canterbury.</hi> The refutation of this tale may be read in <hi rend=italics>Strype's</hi> Life of archbishop <hi rend=italics>Parker,</hi> at p. <num value="57">57</num>, which makes it needless for me to enter on the attempt. A view of the tavern, and its sign, is preserved in a print in the <hi rend=italics>Entr&eacute;e de la Reyne Mere du Roy,</hi> or of <hi rend=italics>Mary</hi>

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Blossom's Inn.</placename></NOTE> IN <hi rend=italics>Laurence-lane,</hi> not far from hence, was another public-house of much antiquity, and which is still in great business as a carriers inn; the <hi rend=italics>Blossoms Inn,</hi> so named from the rich border of flowers which adorned the original sign, that of <hi rend=italics>St. Laurence.</hi> These were the effects of his martyrdom, &ldquo;for (says the legend) flowers sprung up on the spot of his cruel martyrdom.&rdquo;
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Splendid Tournaments.</NOTE> IN this street, between the cross and <hi rend=italics>Soperslane,</hi> were held most splendid tournaments in the year <datestruct value="1331"><year reg="1331">1331</year></datestruct>; they began <hi rend=italics>Sept.</hi> <num value="21">21</num>, and lasted <num value="3">three</num> days. A scaffold was erected for queen <hi rend=italics>Philippa</hi> and her gay troop of ladies, all most richly attired, to behold the knights collected from all quarters to shew their skill in deeds of arms. The upper part of the scaffold, on which the ladies were seated, &ldquo;brake in sunder, and,&rdquo; as <hi rend=italics>Stow</hi> says, &ldquo;whereby they were (with some shame) forced to fall downe;&rdquo; and many knights and others, which stood beneath, much hurt. The carpenters were saved from punishment, by the intercession of the queen; but, to prevent such accidents in future, the king ordered a building of stone to be erected, near the church of <hi rend=italics>St. Mary le Bow,</hi> for himself, the queen, and &ldquo;other states,&rdquo; to see the <pb id="p.553" n="553"> gallant spectacles in safety.<note><hi rend=italics>Stow's Survaie,</hi> <num value="485">485</num>.</NOTE> This was used long after for the same purpose, even till the year <datestruct value="1410"><year reg="1410">1410</year></datestruct>, when <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> IV. granted it to certain mercers, who converted it into shops, warehouses, and other requisites of their trade.<note>The same, <num value="467">467</num>.</NOTE>
<p>A LITTLE to the east of the cross stood the <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Conduit.</NOTE> conduit, which served as the mother or chief aqueduct, which was to supply the lesser conduits with water, brought by pipes from <hi rend=italics>Paddington.</hi> This stood on the site of the old conduit, founded in <datestruct value="1285--"><year reg="1285">1285</year></datestruct>, castellated with stone, and cisterned in lead, as <hi rend=italics>old Stow</hi> tells us: and again rebuilt in <datestruct value="1479--"><year reg="1479">1479</year></datestruct>, by <hi rend=italics>Thomas Ilan,</hi> <num value="1">one</num> of the sheriffs. On some very festive occasions these conduits have been made to run with claret. Such was the case at the coronation of <hi rend=italics>Anna Bullen;</hi> who was received at the lesser conduit by <hi rend=italics>Pallas, Juno, and Venus. Mercury,</hi> in the name of the goddesses, presented to her a ball of gold divided into <num value="3">three</num> parts, signifying <num value="3">three</num> gifts bestowed on her by the deities, WISDOM, RICHES, and FELICITY. But, alas! beneath them lurked speedy disgrace, imprisonment, the block, and axe.
<p>I CANNOT well fix the place where the old <NOTE PLACE=MARG>The Standard.</NOTE> Standard in <hi rend=italics>Cheap</hi> stood. The time of its foundation is unknown. It appears to have been very ruinous in <datestruct value="1442--"><year reg="1442">1442</year></datestruct>, at which time <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VI. granted <pb id="p.554" n="554"> a licence for repairing it, together with a conduit in the same. This was a place at which executions, and other acts of justice, were in old times <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Executions at the Standard.</NOTE> frequently performed. Here, in <datestruct value="1293--"><year reg="1293">1293</year></datestruct>, <num value="3">three</num> men had their heads cut off, for rescuing a prisoner arrested by a city officer. In <datestruct value="1351--"><year reg="1351">1351</year></datestruct>, <num value="2">two</num> fishmongers were beheaded at the standard, but their crime has not reached us. In <datestruct value="1461--"><year reg="1461">1461</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>John Davy</hi> had his hand cut off, for striking a man before the judges at <hi rend=italics>Westminster;</hi> and in <datestruct value="1399--"><year reg="1399">1399</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> IV. caused the blank charters, made by <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> II. to be burned here, as we do libels in our times.
<p>BUT these were legal acts. Many sad instances of barbarous executions occurred in the fury of popular commotions. <hi rend=italics>Richard Lions,</hi> an eminent goldsmith, and late sheriff of the city, was in <datestruct value="1381--"><year reg="1381">1381</year></datestruct> (with several others) cruelly beheaded here by order of <hi rend=italics>Wat Tyler. Lions</hi> was interred in the church of <hi rend=italics>St. James, Garlic-hithe,</hi> and on his tomb (now lost) was a figure in a long flowered gown, a large purse hanging in a belt from his shoulders, his hair short, his beard forked, a plain hood falling back and covering his shoulders. At the same time numbers of foreign merchants, especially <hi rend=italics>Flemings,</hi> were dragged from the churches, and, the <hi rend=italics>Shibboleth</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Stow's Hist.</hi> <num value="288">288</num>. <hi rend=italics>Kennet,</hi> i. <num value="246">246</num>.</NOTE> of <hi rend=italics>Bread</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Cheese</hi> being put to them (which they pronouncing <hi rend=italics>Brot</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Cawse</hi>) <pb id="p.555" n="555"> they were instantly put to death.

<p>WHETHER <hi rend=italics>Walter Stapleton,</hi> bishop of <hi rend=italics>Exeter,</hi> suffered by the popular fury on this spot, is rather uncertain; some imagine that he was beheaded at a cross before the north door of <hi rend=italics>St. Paul's;</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Stow's Survaie,</hi> <num value="483">483</num>.</NOTE> to which church he was flying for refuge, and unfortunately seized by the mob before he had taken sanctuary.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Portraits.</NOTE> WITHIN are portraits of numbers of our judges, who frequently try causes under this roof. I must direct the reader's attention to <num value="12">twelve</num> of that order of peculiar merit: these are the portraits of the able and virtuous Sir MATTHEW HALE, and his <num value="11">eleven</num> cotemporary judges; who, after the dreadful calamity of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, regulated the rebuilding of the city of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> by such wise rules, as to prevent the endless train of vexatious law-suits which might ensue; and have been little less chargeable than the fire itself.

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Great Feasts.</NOTE> THE <num value="1">first</num> time this hall was used on festive occasions, was by Sir <hi rend=italics>John Shaw,</hi> goldsmith, knighted in the field of <hi rend=italics>Bosworth.</hi> After building the essentials of good kitchens and other offices, in the year <datestruct value="1500"><year reg="1500">1500</year></datestruct> he gave here the mayor's feast, which before had usually been held in <hi rend=italics>Grocershall.</hi> None of their bills of fare have reached me, <pb id="p.559" n="559"> but doubtlessly they were very magnificent. They at length grew to such excess, that, in the time of <hi rend=italics>Philip</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Mary,</hi> a sumptuary law was made to restrain the expence both of provisions and liveries: but I suspect, as it lessened the honor of the city, it was not long observed; for in <datestruct value="1554--"><year reg="1554">1554</year></datestruct>, the city thought proper to renew the order of council, by way of reminding their fellow-citizens of their relapse into luxury. Among the great feasts given here on public occasions, may be reckoned that given in <datestruct value="1612--"><year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct>, on occasion of the unhappy marriage of the prince <hi rend=italics>Palatine</hi> with <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth,</hi> daughter of <hi rend=italics>James</hi> I; who, in defiance of the remonstrances of his better-judging father-in-law, rushed on the usurpation of the dominion of another monarch, and brought great misery on himself and his amiable spouse. The next was in <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>, when <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> I. returned from his imprudent, inefficacious journey into <hi rend=italics>Scotland.</hi> In the midst of the most factious and turbulent times, when every engine was set to work to annihilate the regal power, the city, under its lord mayor, Sir <hi rend=italics>William Acton,</hi> made a feast unparalleled in history for its magnificence.

<p>ADJACENT to <hi rend=italics>Guildhall,</hi> is <hi rend=italics>Guildhall</hi> chapel, or <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Guildhall Chapel.</placename></NOTE> college, a <hi rend=italics>gothic</hi> building, founded by <hi rend=italics>Peter Fanlore, Adam Francis,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Henry Frowick,</hi> citizens, about the year <datestruct value="1299"><year reg="1299">1299</year></datestruct>. The establishment was a warden, <num value="7">seven</num> priests, <num value="3">three</num> clerks, and <num value="4">four</num> choristers. <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> VI. granted it to the mayor and <pb id="p.568" n="568"> commonalty of the city of <hi rend=italics>London.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Tanner.</hi> And <hi rend=italics>Newcourt,</hi> i. <num value="361">361</num>.</NOTE> Here used to be service once a week, and also at the election of the mayor, and before the mayor's feast, to deprecate indigestions, and all plethoric evils. At present divine service is discontinued, the chapel being used as a justice room.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Library.</NOTE> ADJOINING to it once stood a fair library, furnished with books belonging to <hi rend=italics>Guildhall,</hi> built by the executors of the famous <hi rend=italics>Whittington. Stow</hi> says that the protector <hi rend=italics>Somerset</hi> sent to borrow some of the books, with a promise of restoring them; <num value="3">three</num> <hi rend=italics>Carries</hi> were laden with them, but they never more were returned.<note><hi rend=italics>Stow's Survaie,</hi> <num value="493">493</num>.</NOTE>
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Blackwall's Hall.</placename></NOTE> IMMEDIATELY beyond the chapel stands <hi rend=italics>Blackwall's hall,</hi> or, more properly, <hi rend=italics>Bakewell,</hi> from its having in later years been inhabited by a person of that name. It was originally called <hi rend=italics>Basing's haugh,</hi> or hall, from a family of that name; the coats of arms of which were to be seen cut in stone, or painted, in the antient building. It was on vaults of stone, brought from <hi rend=italics>Caen</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Normandy;</hi> the time is uncertain, but certainly after the Conquest. The family were of great antiquity. <hi rend=italics>Solomon Basing</hi> was mayor in <datestruct value="1216--"><year reg="1216">1216</year></datestruct>; and another of the name sheriff in <datestruct value="1308--"><year reg="1308">1308</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1397--"><year reg="1397">1397</year></datestruct> the house was purchased by the mayor and commonalty for <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> pounds</measure>, and from that time has been used as <pb id="p.569" n="569"> the market of woollen cloth. It became so ruinous in the time of queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth,</hi> that it was pulled down, and rebuilt for <measure value="2500l." type=currency><num value="2500">twenty-five hundred</num> pounds</measure>; much of it at the expence of <hi rend=italics>Richard May,</hi> merchant-taylor. It consists at present of <num value="2">two</num> large courts, with warehouses in all parts for the lodging of the cloth; but is very little used. Formerly there were proclamations issued to compel people to bring their goods into this hall, to prevent deceit in the manufactures, which might occasion us discredit in foreign markets, and also be the means of defrauding the poor children of <hi rend=italics>Christ hospital</hi> of part of the revenue which arose from the <hi rend=italics>hallage</hi> of this great magazine.
<p>ON the north side of <hi rend=italics>Cheapside</hi> stood the hospital <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Hospital of st. Thomas of Acon;</placename></NOTE> of <hi rend=italics>St. Thomas</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Acon,</hi> founded by <hi rend=italics>Thomas Fitz-Theobald de Helles</hi> and his wife <hi rend=italics>Agnes,</hi> sister to the turbulent <hi rend=italics>Thomas Becket,</hi> who was born in the house of his father <hi rend=italics>Gilbert,</hi> which was situated on this spot. The mother of our meek saint was a fair <hi rend=italics>Saracen,</hi> whom his father had married in the <hi rend=italics>Holy Land.</hi> On the site of his house rose the hospital, built within <num value="20">twenty</num> years after the murder of <hi rend=italics>Thomas;</hi> yet such was the repute of his sanctity, that it was dedicated to him, in conjunction with the blessed Virgin, without waiting for his canonization. The hospital consisted of a master and several brethren, professing the rule of <hi rend=italics>St. Austin.</hi> The church, cloisters, &amp;c. were <pb id="p.570" n="570"> granted by <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. to the Mercers company, who had the gift of the mastership.<note><hi rend=italics>Tanner.</hi></NOTE>
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Now <placename>Mercers Hall.</placename></NOTE> IN the old church were numbers of monuments; among others, <num value="1">one</num> to <hi rend=italics>James Butler</hi> earl of <hi rend=italics>Ormond,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Joan</hi> his wife, living in the beginning of the reign of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VI. This whole pile was destroyed in the great fire, but was very handsomely rebuilt by the Mercers company, who have their hall here. In the portico to the chapel is a fulllength figure recumbent of <hi rend=italics>Richard Fishbourn,</hi> dressed in a furred gown, and a ruff; he died in <datestruct value="1623--"><year reg="1623">1623</year></datestruct>, and, being a great benefactor to the place, received the honor of this monument.
<p>IN this chapel the celebrated, but unsteady, archbishop of <hi rend=italics>Spalatro,</hi> preached his <num value="1">first</num> sermon, in <datestruct value="1617--"><year reg="1617">1617</year></datestruct>, in <hi rend=italics>Italian,</hi> before the archbishop of <hi rend=italics>Canterbury,</hi> and a splendid audience; and continued his discourses in the same place several times, after he had embraced our religion; but, having the folly to return to his antient faith, and trust himself among his old friends at <hi rend=italics>Rome,</hi> he was shut up in the castle of St. <hi rend=italics>Angelo,</hi> where he died in <datestruct value="1625--"><year reg="1625">1625</year></datestruct>.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Mercers Company.</placename></NOTE> THIS company is the <num value="1">first</num> of the <num value="12">twelve</num>, or such who are honored with the privilege of the lord mayor's being elected out of <num value="1">one</num> of them. The name by no means implied originally a dealer in <pb id="p.571" n="571"> silks: for <hi rend=italics>mercery</hi> included all sorts of small wares, toys, and haberdashery.<note><hi rend=italics>Anderson's Dict.</hi> i. <num value="145">145</num>.</NOTE> But, as numbers of this opulent company were merchants, and imported great quantities of rich silks from <hi rend=italics>Italy,</hi> the name became applied to the company, and all dealers in silk. Not fewer than <num value="62">sixty-two</num> mayors were of this company, between the years <datestruct value="1214--"><year reg=1214>1214</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1762--"><year reg=1762>1762</year></datestruct>; among which it reckons Sir <hi rend=italics>John Coventry,</hi> Sir <hi rend=italics>Richard Whittington,</hi> and Sir <hi rend=italics>Richard</hi> and Sir <hi rend=italics>John Gresham.</hi> We are obliged to the exact <hi rend=italics>Strype</hi> for the list. In that by <hi rend=italics>Maitland,</hi> the company each mayor belonged to is omitted.
<p>IMMEDIATELY to the east is the narrow street, <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>The Old Jewry.</placename></NOTE> the <hi rend=italics>Old Jewry,</hi> which took its name from the great synagogue which stood there, till the unhappy race was expelled the kingdom, in <datestruct value="1291--"><year reg="1291">1291</year></datestruct>. Their persecutions, under some of the preceding monarchs, nearly equalled those of the Christians under the <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> emperors: yet the love of gain retained them in our country in defiance of all their sufferings. A new order of friars, called <hi rend=italics>Fratres de Sacca,</hi> or <hi rend=italics>de penitentia,</hi> got possession of the <hi rend=italics>Jewish</hi> temple: but did not hold it long. <hi rend=italics>Robert Fitzwalter,</hi> the great banner-bearer of the city, requested, in <datestruct value="1305--"><year reg="1305">1305</year></datestruct>, that the friars might assign it to him. It seems it joined to his own house, which stood near the site of the present <hi rend=italics>Grocers</hi>
<pb id="p.572" n="572"> <hi rend=italics>hall.</hi> In <datestruct value="1439--"><year reg="1439">1439</year></datestruct>, it was occupied by <hi rend=italics>Robert Lorge,</hi> mayor, who kept his mayoralty in this house; Sir <hi rend=italics>Hugh Clapton</hi> did the same in <datestruct value="1492--"><year reg="1492">1492</year></datestruct>; and after these tenants it was degraded into a tavern, distinguished by the sign of the Windmill.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Grocers Hall.</placename></NOTE> THE chapel, or church, was bought by the Grocers company, in <datestruct value="1411--"><year reg="1411">1411</year></datestruct>, from <hi rend=italics>Fitzwalter,</hi> for <measure value="320bmark" type=currency><num value="320">three hundred and twenty</num> marks</measure>;<note><hi rend=italics>Survaie,</hi>
<num value="476">476</num>, <num value="499">499</num>.</NOTE> who here layed the foundation of the present hall, a noble room, with a <hi rend=italics>gothic</hi> front, and bow window. Here, to my <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Of Sir John Cutler.</NOTE> great surprize, I met again with Sir <hi rend=italics>John Cutler,</hi> grocer, in marble and on canvas. In the <num value="1">first</num> he is represented standing, in a flowing wig waved rather than curled, a laced cravat, and a furred gown with the folds not ungraceful: except where the dress is inimical to the sculptor's art, it may be called a good performance. By his portrait we may learn that this worthy wore a black wig, and was a good-looking man. He was created a baronet <hi rend=italics>November</hi> <num value="12">12th</num>, <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>; so that he certainly had some claim of gratitude on the restored monarch. He died in <datestruct value="1693--"><year reg="1693">1693</year></datestruct>. His kinsman and executor, <hi rend=italics>Edmund Boulter,</hi> Esq; expended <num value="7666">7,666</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> on his funeral expences.<note><hi rend=italics>Strype's Stow,</hi> i. book i. p. <num value="289">289</num>.</NOTE> He is spoken of as a benefactor, and as having rebuilt the great parlour, and over it the court room, which were consumed in the fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>. He served as master of the <pb id="p.573" n="573"> company in <datestruct value="1652--"><year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1653--"><year reg="1653">1653</year></datestruct>, in <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>, and again a <num value="4">fourth</num> time. The anecdote of his bounty to the College of Physicians, might have led <num value="1">one</num> to suppose that the Grocers had not met with more liberal treatment. But by the honors of the statue, and the portrait, he seems to have gained here a degree of popularity. How far the character given of him by Mr. <hi rend=italics>Pope</hi> may rest unimpeached, must remain a subject of further inquiry:

<p>THIS company follows the Mercers; they were <pb id="p.574" n="574"> originally called <hi rend=italics>Pepperers,</hi> from their dealing so greatly in pepper: but in <datestruct value="1345--"><year reg="1345">1345</year></datestruct> they were incorporated by the name of <hi rend=italics>Grocers,</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Survaie,</hi>

<p>IN this hall sate the famous committee of the parlement of <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>, which was to settle the reform of the nation, and conduct the inflammatory business of the times. Lord <hi rend=italics>Clarendon</hi> gives the motives of fixing on this place: such as pretended fears for the safety of the friends of liberty; and the real and reasonable dread of the moderate men, who had been pointed out to the mob as enemies to their country&mdash;as the <hi rend=italics>De Witts</hi> were by the patriots of <hi rend=italics>Holland,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>de Foulon</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Berthier</hi> by those of <hi rend=italics>France.</hi> The <num value="1">one</num> gave security to the popular leaders, and the other lessened the minority, by frightening from attendance numbers who might have been of use to the royal cause.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Ringed-hall.</placename></NOTE> In <hi rend=italics>Queen-street,</hi> on the south side of <hi rend=italics>Cheapside,</hi> stood <hi rend=italics>Ringed-hall,</hi> the house of the earls of <hi rend=italics>Cornwall,</hi> given by them, in <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> III&lsquo;s time, to the abbot of <hi rend=italics>Beaulieu,</hi> near <hi rend=italics>Oxford.

<p>I FORGOT <hi rend=italics>Bucklesbury,</hi> a street which opens on <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Bucklesbury.</placename></NOTE> the south side of <hi rend=italics>Cheapside,</hi> a little to the west of the Grocers hall. It took its name from <num value="1">one</num> <hi rend=italics>Buckle,</hi> who had in it a large manor-house of stone. This man lost his life in a strange way. Near his house stood an old tower built by <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> I. called the <hi rend=italics>Cornets</hi> tower, possibly a watchtower, from the summit of which signals might have been given by blowing a horn. Here that monarch kept his exchange. About the year <datestruct value="1358"><year reg="1358">1358</year></datestruct> he gave it to St. <hi rend=italics>Stephen's</hi> chapel, <hi rend=italics>Westminster.</hi> This <hi rend=italics>Buckle</hi> intended to pull it down, and to have built a handsome house of wood; or, according to the expression of the times, a <hi rend=italics>goodly frame of timber:</hi> but in greedily demolishing this tower, a stone fell on him, and crushed him to death; and another person, who married his widow, set up the new-prepared frame of timber, and finished the work.
<p>I HAVE heard that <hi rend=italics>Bucklesbury</hi> was, in the reign of king <hi rend=italics>William,</hi> noted for the great resort of ladies of fashion, to purchase tea, fans, and other <hi rend=italics>Indian</hi> goods. King <hi rend=italics>William,</hi> in some of his letters, appears to be angry with his queen for visiting these shops; which, it should seem, by the following lines of <hi rend=italics>Prior,</hi> were sometimes perverted to places of intrigue; for, speaking of <hi rend=italics>Hans Carvel's</hi> wife, says the poet, <pb id="p.576" n="576">

<p>IN the time of queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth,</hi> this street was inhabited by chemists, druggists, and apothecaries. <hi rend=italics>Mouffett,</hi> in his treatise on foods, calls on them to decide, whether sweet smells correct pestilent air: and adds, that <hi rend=italics>Bucklesbury</hi> being replete with physic, drugs, and spicery, and being perfumed, in the time of the plague, with the pounding of spices, melting of gum, and making perfumes for others, escaped that great plague whereof such multitudes died, that scarcely any house was left unvisited.

<p>OVER the altar is a beautiful picture of the martyrdom of St. <hi rend=italics>Stephen,</hi> by Mr. <hi rend=italics>West.</hi> The character of the saint is finely expressed in his angelic countenance, resigned to his fate, and full of sure and certain hope. I looked to no purpose for the statue erected, DIV&AElig; MAC-AUL&AElig;, by her doating admirer, a former rector; which a successor of his has most profanely pulled down.
<p>THE Mansion-house, and many adjacent buildings, stand on the site of <hi rend=italics>Stocks-market;</hi> which <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Stocks-market.</placename></NOTE> took its name from a pair of stocks for the punishment of offenders, erected in an open place near this spot, as early as the year <datestruct value="1281"><year reg="1281">1281</year></datestruct>. This was the great market of the city during many centuries. In it stood the famous equestrian statue, erected in honor of <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> II. by his most loyal subject Sir <hi rend=italics>Robert Viner,</hi> lord mayor. Fortunately his lordship discovered <num value="1">one</num> (made at <hi rend=italics>Leghorn</hi>) of <hi rend=italics>John Sobieski,</hi> king of <hi rend=italics>Poland,</hi> trampling on a Turk. The good knight caused some alterations to be made, and christened the <hi rend=italics>Polish</hi> monarch by the name of <hi rend=italics>Charles,</hi> and bestowed on the turbaned <hi rend=italics>Turk</hi> that of <hi rend=italics>Oliver Cromwell;</hi> and thus, new <pb id="p.578" n="578"> named, it arose on this spot in honor of his convivial monarch. The statue was removed, in <datestruct value="1738--"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct>, to make room for the Mansion-house. It remained many years afterward in an inn-yard: and in <datestruct value="1779--"><year reg="1779">1779</year></datestruct> it was bestowed, by the common-council, on <hi rend=italics>Robert Vyner, Esq;</hi> who removed it to grace his country seat.
<p>THE opening before the Mansion-house divides into <num value="3">three</num> important streets: <hi rend=italics>Cornhill</hi> in the center; the Bank of <hi rend=italics>England,</hi> the old <hi rend=italics>Threadneedlestreet,</hi> on the north; and <hi rend=italics>Lombard-street</hi> on the south. I shall pursue these as far as the spots which I have already described, and give what remains worthy of notice. I shall take the middle way.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>The Royal Exchange.</placename></NOTE> THE <hi rend=italics>Royal Exchange,</hi> that concourse of all nations of the world, rises before us with the full majesty of commerce. Whether we consider the grandeur of the edifice, or the vast concerns carried on within its walls, we are equally struck with its importance. But we are more astonished when we find that this expensive princely pile was the result of the munificence of a private citizen, SIR THOMAS GRESHAM. Let the pride of my country not be suppressed, when I have an opportunity of saying, that the original hint was given to him by a <hi rend=italics>Welshman;</hi> by <hi rend=italics>Richard Clough,</hi> afterward knighted, originally his servant, and in the year <datestruct value="1561"><year reg="1561">1561</year></datestruct>, by his merit and industry, advanced by Sir <pb id="p.579" n="579"> <hi rend=italics>Thomas</hi> to be his correspondent and agent in the then <hi rend=italics>emporium</hi> of the world, <hi rend=italics>Antwerp. Clough</hi> wrote to his master, to blame the citizens of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> for neglecting so necessary a thing; bluntly saying, that they studied nothing else but their own private profit; that they were content to walk about in the rain, more like pedlars than merchants; and that there was no kind of people but had their place to transact business in, in other countries. Thus stimulated, Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas</hi> purchased some tenements on the site of the Royal Exchange; on <hi rend=italics>June</hi> <num value="7">7</num>, <datestruct value="1566--"><year reg="1566">1566</year></datestruct>, laid the foundation, and, in <hi rend=italics>November,</hi> <datestruct value="1567--"><year reg="1567">1567</year></datestruct>, completed what was then called the <hi rend=italics>Bourse.</hi> In <datestruct value="1570--"><year reg="1570">1570</year></datestruct>, queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth</hi> went in great state from her palace at <hi rend=italics>Somerset-house,</hi> to make Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas</hi> a visit at his own house. After dinner she went to the <hi rend=italics>Bourse,</hi> visited every part, and then, by sound of trumpet, dignified it with the title of the <hi rend=italics>Royal Exchange.</hi> All the upper part was filled then, and even to this century, with shops; on the above occasion they were filled with the richest productions of the universe, to shew her majesty the prosperity of the commercial parts of her dominions.

<p>AMONG the pictures in this hall, or its different apartments, is <num value="1">one</num> of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VII. presenting the charter of incorporation to the company.

In his old age, when struck with blindness, the <pb id="p.594" n="594"> cardinal meanly hoped to prevale on him to resign his bishoprick, to which the good prelate returned a spirited reply. He lived to a great age, and died in <datestruct value="1528--"><year reg="1528">1528</year></datestruct>, after worthily governing the see <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> years.

Essex,</hi> i. <num value="287">287</num>.</NOTE> the son of a tanner, and in due time was bound apprentice to a taylor in this city; was pressed for a soldier, and by his spirit rose to the highest commands in foreign parts.

By the extraordinary proofs of valor he shewed at the battle of <hi rend=italics>Poictiers,</hi> he gained the esteem of his heroic general the Black Prince. On the peace between <hi rend=italics>England</hi> and <hi rend=italics>France,</hi> he, with several other <hi rend=italics>English</hi> soldiers of fortune, associated himself with those brave <hi rend=italics>banditti,</hi> known by the name of <hi rend=italics>les grandes compagnies, Tard-Venus,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Malendrins.</hi> After carrying terror through certain parts of <hi rend=italics>France</hi> by their dreadful ravages, he persuaded <num value="5000">five thousand</num> horsemen, and about <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> foot, mostly <hi rend=italics>English,</hi> to follow him to assist the marquis of <pb id="p.598" n="598"> <hi rend=italics>Montserrat,</hi> against <hi rend=italics>Galeazzo,</hi> duke of <hi rend=italics>Milan.</hi> After performing the most signal services for the marquis, he deserted him for the duke of <hi rend=italics>Milan;</hi> was equally successful under his new master: and was rewarded by being married to <hi rend=italics>Domitia,</hi> natural daughter to <hi rend=italics>Barnabas,</hi> brother to the duke, with whom he received a great fortune.

<p>JOHN SPEED was a <hi rend=italics>Cheshire</hi> taylor, and free of <NOTE PLACE=MARG>John Speed.</NOTE> this company.

<p>IT was <num value="1">one</num> of this meek profession, actuated by the religion of meekness, who <num value="1">first</num> suggested the pious project of abolishing the slave trade. <hi rend=italics>Thomas <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Thomas Woolman.</NOTE> Woolman,</hi> a quaker, and taylor, of <hi rend=italics>New Jersey,</hi> was <num value="1">first</num> struck with the thought, that engaging in the traffic of the human species was incompatible with the spirit of the Christian religion. He published many tracts against this inhuman species of commerce; he argued against it in public and private: he made long journies for the sake of talking to individuals on the subject; and was careful, himself, not to countenance slavery, by the use of those conveniences which were provided by the labor of slaves. In the course of a visit to <hi rend=italics>England,</hi> he went to <hi rend=italics>York,</hi> in <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, sickened of the small-pox, and died <hi rend=italics>October</hi> <num value="7">7th</num>, in sure and certain hopes of that reward which Heaven will bestow on the sincere philanthropist. <pb id="p.602" n="602">

<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Winchester-House.</placename></NOTE> AT the Dissolution, great part of the house, cloisters, and gardens were granted to <hi rend=italics>William</hi> lord <hi rend=italics>St. John,</hi> afterward marquis of <hi rend=italics>Winchester,</hi> and lord treasurer. On the site he built <hi rend=italics>Winchester-place,</hi> a magnificent house, where <hi rend=italics>Winchester-street</hi> now stands.

They were patronized by the duke of <hi rend=italics>Buckingham. Howel,</hi> the celebrated author of the Letters, was steward to the manufacture, but was obliged to quit his office, not being able to endure the heat.

<p>BEHIND this church, close to <hi rend=italics>London-wall,</hi> <NOTE PLACE=MARG>The Papey.</NOTE> stood the <hi rend=italics>Papey,</hi> a fraternity of <hi rend=italics>St. Charity</hi> and <hi rend=italics>St. John</hi> the <hi rend=italics>Evangelist,</hi> for <hi rend=italics>Papeys,</hi> or poor infirm priests, founded in <datestruct value="1430--"><year reg="1430">1430</year></datestruct> by certain chauntry priests. It was a numerous society, designed to relieve any of its members, who by lameness or illness were reduced to distress or poverty, whether they were brothers or sisters. The church of <hi rend=italics>St. Augustine Papey</hi> belonged to this fraternity. These priests, the brotherhood of threescore priests of <hi rend=italics>Leaden-hall,</hi> and the company of parish clerks, who were skilled in singing <hi rend=italics>diriges</hi> and funeral offices, were accustomed to attend the solemn <pb id="p.608" n="608"> burials of the rich or great. An instance is given, in <datestruct value="1543--"><year reg="1543">1543</year></datestruct>, of their attending the funeral of Dame <hi rend=italics>Jane Milbourn,</hi> widow of Sir <hi rend=italics>John Milbourn,</hi> for which the sum of <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure> was betowed on them by the will of the deceased.<note><hi rend=italics>Maitland's Hist.

He was buried by <num value="1">one</num> of the poorer orders, who had the perquisite of furnishing funerals like our undertakers. This funeral was rather grand, but remarkably cheap.</NOTE> This house became, after the Suppression, the habitation of Sir <hi rend=italics>Francis Walsingham.</hi>

<p>IN <hi rend=italics>Winchester-street</hi> stood also a great house, called the <hi rend=italics>Spanish</hi> ambassador's, which was occupied by Sir <hi rend=italics>James Houblon,</hi> knight and alderman: and at the same period it was the residence of several of our most eminent merchants.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Sir Thomas Gresham's House.</placename></NOTE> TO the east side of the same street, stood the house of our <num value="1">first</num> of merchants, Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Gresham;</hi> originally built with brick and timber, and fronting to <hi rend=italics>Bishopsgate-street.</hi> By his will he appointed <num value="4">four</num> lecturers in divinity, astronomy, music, and geometry, and <num value="3">three</num> readers in civil law, physic, and rhetoric, each with a salary of <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> pounds</measure> a year, payable out of the rent issuing out of the Royal Exchange. This house was the place where the professors had their apartments, and where the lectures were to be read; which were begun in <datestruct value="1597--"><year reg="1597">1597</year></datestruct>, but they are now quite deserted. <pb id="p.609" n="609"> This arose in a great degree from the institution of the ROYAL SOCIETY: the meetings of which were for a considerable time held here.
<p>THE origin of that respectable body was from <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Origin of the Royal Society.</NOTE> the meeting of a few illustrious persons at the lodgings of doctor <hi rend=italics>Wilkins,</hi> afterward bishop of <hi rend=italics>Chester,</hi> and others worthy of record, doctor <hi rend=italics>Seth Ward,</hi> afterward bishop of <hi rend=italics>Salisbury,</hi> Mr. BOYLE, Sir <hi rend=italics>William Petty,</hi> and the doctors <hi rend=italics>Wallis, Goddard, Willis,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Bathurst,</hi> Sir <hi rend=italics>Christopher Wren,</hi> and a few more. In <datestruct value="1658--"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>, they assembled in <hi rend=italics>Gresham</hi> college, by permission of the professors of the foundation of Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Gresham;</hi> and on the Restoration were incorporated by royal charter. A most instructive and well-founded Museum was <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Its Museum.</NOTE> established here in <datestruct value="1677--"><year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>, by <hi rend=italics>Henry Colwall,</hi> consisting of natural and artificial curiosities, collected with great expence and judgment. The society had then an advantage never possessed at any other time, the assistance of the great Mr. BOYLE, the most accomplished, the most learned, and most religious <hi rend=italics>virtuoso,</hi> who pointed out the proper objects of their collection, and gave them the most finished instructions<note>These were collected and published in <datestruct value="1692--"><year reg="1692">1692</year></datestruct>. This little book is a most necessary companion for all travellers and voyagers.</NOTE> for procuring them from every quarter of the globe. At that period there were, in both the <hi rend=italics>Indies,</hi> persons capable of understanding, <pb id="p.610" n="610"> and pursuing with success, the plan laid down for them at home. It was the good fortune of the <hi rend=italics>Museum</hi> to have, co-existent with its formation, a philosopher for its <hi rend=italics>Curator,</hi> fully qualified to describe its various articles. Doctor <hi rend=italics>Nehemiah Grew</hi> not only described, but illustrated every subject which required them, with the most learned and pertinent remarks. He published his <hi rend=italics>Museum Regalis Societatis</hi> in <datestruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></datestruct>, and dedicated it to the founder, Mr. <hi rend=italics>Colwall,</hi> at the expence of whom the plates were engraven. It is a work equal to the <hi rend=italics>Museum Wormianum,</hi> or any other admired foreign performance of that age. Its defects arise only from the want of system, the misfortune of the time; for our RAY had not then cleared the rich ore of Natural History from the surrounding rubbish. About the year <datestruct value="1711"><year reg="1711">1711</year></datestruct>, the Society removed from hence to <hi rend=italics>Crane-court</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Fleet-street.</hi> For many years the <hi rend=italics>Museum</hi> was neglected. My respected friend, the honorable <hi rend=italics>Daines Barrington,</hi> with the most disinterested zeal, undertook the restoration of it, as far as the ravages of time would permit. This he did in the most effectual manner; and enriched it with a number of new specimens, especially from our late colonies: it being his design to make it a repository of every thing relative to the natural history of <hi rend=italics>Great Britain</hi> and its dependencies: a most noble plan, and worthy of being carried into <pb id="p.611" n="611"> full execution. By singular chance, <hi rend=italics>Gresham</hi> college escaped the flames in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>; but I believe very little of the original house remained: it having been mostly rebuilt in <datestruct value="1601--"><year reg="1601">1601</year></datestruct>, possibly after the original design: the arcades being adapted for the reception of the numbers of commercial and other followers of so universal a merchant as Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Gresham.</hi>

<p>THIS college has been pulled down within my <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Excise-office.</placename></NOTE> memory; and the <hi rend=italics>Excise-office,</hi> a building of most magnificent simplicity, has risen in its place.

They seem quickly to have repaired their loss; for complaint was soon after made against them, for persisting in their practices. They were so opulent in the days of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VI. <pb id="p.618" n="618"> as to be able to furnish him with money, but they took care to get the customs mortgaged to them by way of security.<note><hi rend=italics>Anderson,</hi> i. <num value="231">231</num>.</NOTE> In this street they continued till the reign of queen <hi rend=italics>Elizabeth;</hi> and to this day it is filled with the shops of numbers of eminent bankers.
<p>THE shop of the great Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Gresham</hi> stood in this street; it is now occupied by Messrs. <hi rend=italics>Martin,</hi> bankers, who are still in possession of the original sign of that illustrious person, the <hi rend=italics>Grasshopper.</hi> Were it mine, that honorable memorial of so great a predecessor should certainly be placed in the most ostentatious situation I could find.

<p>BEFORE the great fire, on the site of the present office stood a much-frequented tavern.

<p>IN digging a new sewer in <hi rend=italics>Lombard-street,</hi> a <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Antiquities Discovered.</NOTE> few years ago, were discovered the remains of a <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> street, with numbers of coins, and several antique curiosities, some of great elegance. The beds through which the workmen sunk were <num value="4">four</num>. The <num value="1">first</num> consisted of factitious earth, about <num value="13">thirteen</num> feet <num value="6">six</num> inches thick, all accumulated since the desertion of the antient street: the <num value="2">second</num> of brick, <num value="2">two</num> feet thick, the ruins of the buildings: the <num value="3">third</num> of ashes only, <num value="3">three</num> inches: the <num value="4">fourth</num> of <hi rend=italics>Roman</hi> pavement, both common and tessellated, over which the coins and other antiquities were discovered. Beneath that was the original earth. This account was communicated to the Society of Antiquaries by Doctor <hi rend=italics>Combe,</hi> Sir <hi rend=italics>John Henneker,</hi> and Mr. <hi rend=italics>John Jackson,</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Clement's-lane.</hi> The predominant articles were earthen-ware: and several were ornamented in the most elegant manner. A vase of red earth has on its surface a representation of a fight of men; some on horseback, others on foot: or perhaps a shew of gladiators, as they all fought in pairs, and many of them naked: the combatants <pb id="p.622" n="622"> were armed with falchions; and small round shields, in the manner of the <hi rend=italics>Thracians,</hi> the most esteemed of the gladiators. Others had spears, and others a kind of mace. A beautiful running foliage encompassed the bottom of this vessel. On the fragment of another were several figures. Among them appears <hi rend=italics>Pan</hi> with his <hi rend=italics>Pedum</hi> or crook; and near to him <num value="1">one</num> of the <hi rend=italics>lascivi satyri,</hi> both in beautiful skipping attitudes. On the same piece are <num value="2">two</num> tripods; round each is a serpent regularly twisted, and bringing its head over a bowl which fills the top. These seem (by the serpent) to have been dedicated to <hi rend=italics>Apollo,</hi><note>See similar in <hi rend=italics>Monfaucon,</hi> tom. i. part ii. tab. lii.</NOTE> who, as well as his son <hi rend=italics>&AElig;sculapius,</hi> presided over medicine. On the top of <num value="1">one</num> of the tripods stands a man in full armour. Might not this vessel have been votive, made by order of a soldier restored to health by favor of the god; and to his active powers and enjoyment of rural pleasures, typified under the form of <hi rend=italics>Pan</hi> and his nimble attendants? A plant extends along part of another compartment, possibly allusive to their medical virtues: and, to shew that <hi rend=italics>Bacchus</hi> was not forgotten, beneath lies a <hi rend=italics>Thyrsus</hi> with a double head. The remains of the <num value="2">two</num> bowls which I describe, exhibit beauties which make it evident that <hi rend=italics>Rome</hi> did not want its WEDGWOOD. <pb id="p.623" n="623">
<p>ON another bowl was a free pattern of foliage. On others, or fragments, were objects of the chace, such as hares, part of a deer, and a boar, with human figures, dogs, and horses: all these pieces prettily ornamented. There were, besides, some beads, made of earthen-ware, of the same form as those called the <hi rend=italics>ovum anguinum,</hi> and by the <hi rend=italics>Welsh, glain naidr;</hi> and numbers of coins in gold, silver, and brass, of <hi rend=italics>Claudius, Nero, Galba,</hi> and other emperors, down to <hi rend=italics>Constantine.</hi> The more curious parts of this interesting discovery are engraven in the <hi rend=italics>Arch&aelig;ologia,</hi> vol. viii. and merit the attention of the curious.
<p>IN the same street, towards <hi rend=italics>Birchin-lane,</hi> stood the house of <hi rend=italics>William de la Pole,</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Stow's Survaie,</hi> <num value="384">384</num>.</NOTE> created in <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>House of William de la Pole.</placename></NOTE> <hi rend=italics>France,</hi> by <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> III. knight-banneret, with an allowance out of the customs of <hi rend=italics>Hull</hi> for the support of his dignity.<note><hi rend=italics>Vincent's Discoverie,</hi> &amp;c. <num value="500">500</num>.</NOTE> He was a great merchant, and, being very opulent, used to supply the king's pecuniary wants. He was at the same time the <hi rend=italics>King's merchant;</hi> an office that gave him the lucrative privilege of supplying his master with different sorts of merchandize, and also with money. The office seems to have been continued to later days, under another name: <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VIII. had his <hi rend=italics>King's factor,</hi> and Sir <hi rend=italics>Thomas Gresham</hi> bore the title of the <hi rend=italics>Queen's. Richard (William's</hi> elder <pb id="p.624" n="624"> brother, a merchant at <hi rend=italics>Hull</hi>) had the same employ under <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> III. who calls him <hi rend=italics>dilectus mercator Ricardus de la Pole Pincerna noster.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Vincent's Discoverie,</hi> &amp;c. <num value="500">500</num>.</NOTE>
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>De la Pole Family.</NOTE> FROM <hi rend=italics>William</hi> sprung a numerous race of nobility, distinguished by their ambition and unfortunate ends. His son <hi rend=italics>Michael</hi> was created earl of <hi rend=italics>Suffolk,</hi> yet continued in his office of <hi rend=italics>King's merchant,</hi> and lived in his father's house.<note><hi rend=italics>Stow's Survaie,</hi> <num value="384">384</num>.</NOTE> He at length became lord high chancellor; but, being accused of embezzling the public money, and divers other crimes, was banished the kingdom, and died at <hi rend=italics>Paris</hi> in <datestruct value="1389--"><year reg="1389">1389</year></datestruct>, of a broken heart. His son <hi rend=italics>Michael</hi> was restored, and died of a flux at the siege of <hi rend=italics>Harfleur,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Sept.</hi> <datestruct value="1415--"><year reg="1415">1415</year></datestruct>; and in the very following month, his son and successor, another <hi rend=italics>Michael,</hi> fell in the battle of <hi rend=italics>Agincourt.</hi> His brother <hi rend=italics>William</hi> succeeded, and was afterward created marquis, and then duke of <hi rend=italics>Suffolk.</hi> He was the favorite of the spirited <hi rend=italics>Margaret</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Anjou.</hi> He had distinguished abilities, but by his insolence enraged the nobility so greatly, that, on an accusation of his being the cause of the loss of <hi rend=italics>France,</hi> they banished him the kingdom. On his passage to <hi rend=italics>Calais,</hi> he was seized by a vessel sent expressly to intercept him, and was brought into <hi rend=italics>Dover,</hi> beheaded by the captain of the ship in the cock-boat, without ceremony, and his body flung <pb id="p.625" n="625"> upon the sands, where it was found by his chaplain, and buried at <hi rend=italics>Wingfield</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Suffolk.</hi> The nobility dreaded his return, therefore took this method to free themselves from so formidable an enemy.<note>See the curious particulars in Sir <hi rend=italics>John Fenn's</hi> Letters, i. <num value="39">39</num>, <num value="48">48</num>, truly stated. See also <hi rend=italics>Shakspeare's Henry</hi> VI, part ii. act iv. scene <num value="1">1</num>. and the account of the prophecy in act i. scene <num value="4">4</num>.</NOTE> <hi rend=italics>John,</hi> his son, succeeded him. Finally, his son <hi rend=italics>Edmund,</hi> who was condemned for a murder in the time of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VII, received his pardon; but in the following reign was, in <datestruct value="1513--"><year reg="1513">1513</year></datestruct>, executed for treason; his chief crime with that tyrant seems to have been his relationship to the house of <hi rend=italics>York,</hi> his mother being sister to <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> IV. The venerable <hi rend=italics>Margaret,</hi> countess of <hi rend=italics>Salisbury,</hi> was barbarously brought to the block for the same reason; her son, cardinal <hi rend=italics>Pole,</hi> would not have been spared, could <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> have gotten him into his power. <hi rend=italics>Henry Pole,</hi> lord <hi rend=italics>Montacute,</hi> suffered for corresponding with him: and thus ended this ill-fated race.
<p>ABCHURCH-LANE, which falls into the south <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Abchurch-lane.</placename></NOTE> side of this street, is mentioned by Mr. <hi rend=italics>Pope,</hi> as the residence of Mr. <hi rend=italics>John Moore,</hi> author of the celebrated worm-powder, to whom the poet addresses himself in the following lines:

<p>ADJACENT to the garden stood what <hi rend=italics>Stow</hi> calls <num value="2">two</num> other faire houses.

<p>IRONMONGERS-HALL is a great ornament to <NOTE PLACE=MARG><placename>Ironmongers-Hall.</placename></NOTE> this street; as it is an honor to its architect.

It here leaves <hi rend=italics>Glocestershire,</hi> and becomes the whole southern boundary of <hi rend=italics>Oxfordshire,</hi> or the northern of <hi rend=italics>Berkshire,</hi> and from thence is the southern limit of <hi rend=italics>Buckinghamshire. Boulter's lock,</hi> above <hi rend=italics>Maidenhead,</hi> in the same county, is the last lock; from thence to the sea it requires no farther art to aid its navigation. At a small distance from <hi rend=italics>Windsor-bridge</hi> it divides <hi rend=italics>Berkshire</hi> from <hi rend=italics>Buckinghamshire;</hi> and at a small distance above <hi rend=italics>Staines-bridge</hi> it divides <hi rend=italics>Middlesex</hi> from <hi rend=italics>Surry.</hi> Just above <hi rend=italics>Kingston</hi> it feels the last feeble efforts of a tide; from thence is a most important <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Tide.</NOTE> increase: just below <hi rend=italics>London-bridge,</hi> eighteen feet; and at <hi rend=italics>Deptford,</hi> <num value="20">twenty</num>. The former, brings ships of <num value="350">three hundred and fifty</num> tons, drawing <num value="16">sixteen</num> feet water, to the Custom-house; the latter, those of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> tons, even the largest, drawing <num value="23">twenty-three</num> feet, which import the treasures of <hi rend=italics>India.</hi> This noble river continues fresh as low as <hi rend=italics>Woolwich,</hi> and even there is brackish <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Where Brackish.</NOTE> only at spring-tides. Thus at our capital it is perfectly pure, salubrious, and subservient to the accumulation of those vast articles of commerce, with which this stupendous city abounds.
<p>THE whole course of the <hi rend=italics>Thames,</hi> to its mouth, <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Its Length.</NOTE> is considerably above <num value="200">two hundred</num> miles. I contract <pb id="p.630" n="630"> its length very considerably, in comparison <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Its Proper Mouth.</NOTE> of the usual estimation, for I limit its mouth to the spot between the west end of the isle of <hi rend=italics>Grain,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Kent,</hi> and the eastern part of that of <hi rend=italics>Canvey,</hi> in <hi rend=italics>Essex.</hi> From those places to the <hi rend=italics>Naze</hi> in the latter county, and the <hi rend=italics>North Foreland</hi> in that of <hi rend=italics>Kent</hi> (which have hitherto been considered as its entrance) it ceases to flow in a single channel; it becomes a vast estuary filled with sandbanks, many of which appear above water at the recess of the tides.
<p>THE whole course of the river is through a country abounding with every idea of opulence, fertility, and rural elegance: meadows rich in hay, or covered with numerous herds; gentle risings, and hanging woods; embellished with palaces, magnificent seats, or beautiful villas, a few the hereditary mansions of our antient gentry, but the greater part property transferred, by the effects of vice and dissipation, to the owners of honest wealth, acquired by commerce, or industrious professions, or the dear purchase of cankering rapine. Its course furnishes few sublime scenes, excepting the high chalky cliffs near <hi rend=italics>Henley;</hi> all its banks are replete with native softness, improved by art and the fullest cultivation.
<p>I DO not recollect that it flows in any part over a rocky channel; its bottom is either gravelly or clayey, according to the nature of the soil through <pb id="p.631" n="631"> which it meanders. This gives growth to the abundance of weeds with which it is in many parts filled; and these prove the safety of multitudes of fishes, and preserve them from being extirpated <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Fish.</NOTE> by the unbridled ravages of the poachers. The <hi rend=italics>Thames</hi> has, between its source and <hi rend=italics>Woolwich,</hi> every species found in the <hi rend=italics>British</hi> rivers, except the BURBOT, the LOCHE, the COBITIS T&AElig;NIA, or SPINY LOCHE, of late years discovered in the river <hi rend=italics>Trent,</hi> and the small species of SALMON, the SAMLET. The SALMON, and the SHAD, are fishes of passage; the <num value="1">first</num> appears in the river about the middle of <hi rend=italics>February,</hi> is in great estimation, and sells at a vast price; their capture is prohibited from the <num value="24">24th</num> of <hi rend=italics>August</hi> to the <num value="11">11th</num> of <hi rend=italics>November.</hi> The SHAD arrives the latter end of <hi rend=italics>May,</hi> or beginning of <hi rend=italics>June,</hi> and is a very coarse fish: it sometimes grows to the weight of <measure value="8l." type=currency><num value="8">eight</num> pounds</measure>, but the usual size is from <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="5">five</num>. This is the fish which <hi rend=italics>Du Hamel</hi> describes as the true <hi rend=italics>Alose</hi> of the <hi rend=italics>French;</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Du Hamel,</hi> ii. <num value="316">316</num>. tab. i. fig. <num value="1">1</num>.</NOTE> but the fishermen of the <hi rend=italics>Thames</hi> have another they call <hi rend=italics>Allis,</hi> much smaller than the former, with a row of spots from the gills along the sides, just beneath the back, more or less in number: this the <hi rend=italics>French</hi> call <hi rend=italics>Le Feinte.</hi><note><hi rend=italics>Du Hamel,</hi> ii. <num value="321">321</num>. tab. i. fig. <num value="5">5</num>.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Bloch,</hi> ii. tab. xxx. gives the figure of the <hi rend=italics>Feinte;</hi> but is of opinion that the spots vanish with age. For my part, I have not had opportunities of frequent examination of these fishes, but I incline to think they are different, as the <hi rend=italics>Feintes</hi> appear in spawn at the length of <num value="16">sixteen</num> inches, which is their largest size.&mdash;&mdash;The <hi rend=italics>Feinte</hi> is probably the <hi rend=italics>Twaite</hi> of the <hi rend=italics>Severn. Vide Brit. Zool.</hi> iii. <num value="463">463</num>. edit. <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>. ED.</NOTE> I suspect <pb id="p.632" n="632"> that the name <hi rend=italics>Allis</hi> is misapplied to this species, and that it ought to be applied to the great or common <hi rend=italics>Shad,</hi> being an evident corruption from the <hi rend=italics>French</hi> name <hi rend=italics>Alose;</hi> is the same with that of the <hi rend=italics>Severn,</hi> but is rarely taken here: but neither of them are admitted to good tables.
<p><NOTE PLACE=MARG>Lesser Lamprey, Its Great Use.</NOTE> THE lesser <hi rend=italics>Lamprey,</hi> the <hi rend=italics>Petromyzon fluviatilis</hi> of LINN&AElig;US, is a small fish of great and national importance, and is taken in amazing quantities between <hi rend=italics>Battersea Reach</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Taplow Mills</hi> (a space of about <num value="50">fifty</num> miles) and sold to the <hi rend=italics>Dutch</hi> for the <hi rend=italics>Cod</hi> and other fisheries; <num value="450000">450,000</num> have been sold in <num value="1">one</num> season for that purpose; the price has been <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num> shillings</measure> the <num value="1000">thousand</num>: this year the <hi rend=italics>Dutch</hi> have given <measure value="3l." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> pounds</measure>, and the <hi rend=italics>English</hi> from <num value="5">five</num> to <measure value="8l." type=currency><num value="8">eight</num> pounds</measure>; the former having prudently contracted for <num value="3">three</num> years at a certain price. Formerly the <hi rend=italics>Thames</hi> has furnished from a million to <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> <num value="1000">thousand</num> annually.&mdash;An attempt <NOTE PLACE=MARG>Of the Turbot Fishery.</NOTE> was lately made in parlement to fling the <hi rend=italics>Turbot</hi> fishery entirely into <hi rend=italics>British</hi> hands, by laying <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure> a ton duty on every foreign vessel importing <hi rend=italics>Turbots</hi> into <hi rend=italics>Great Britain:</hi> but the plan was found to be derived from selfish motives, and even on national injustice: the far greater quantity of <pb id="p.633" n="633"> <hi rend=italics>Turbots</hi> being discovered to be taken on the coasts of <hi rend=italics>Holland</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Flanders.</hi><note>See Introduction to the <hi rend=italics>Arctic Zoology,</hi> Ed. <measure value="2d." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>d.</measure> p. lxxix.</NOTE>
<p>THE fish of the <hi rend=italics>Thames</hi> which come as low as <hi rend=italics>London,</hi> and beyond it as far as the water is fresh, are a few <hi rend=italics>Roach,</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Dace, Bleak</hi> in great plenty, and <hi rend=italics>Eels</hi> extend far down the river; small <hi rend=italics>Flounders</hi> are found as far as <hi rend=italics>Fulham,</hi> brought up by the tides, and continue stationary. The <hi rend=italics>Barbel</hi> is never seen below <hi rend=italics>London-bridge.</hi>

<p>SEVERAL of the smaller species of whales have been known to stray up the <hi rend=italics>Thames;</hi> a kind of <hi rend=italics>Grampus,</hi> with a high dorsal fin, has been taken within the mouth of the river. It proved the <hi rend=italics>Spekhugger</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Strom. Hist. Sondmoer,</hi> i. <num value="309">309</num>; the <hi rend=italics>Delphinus orca</hi> of <hi rend=italics>Fabricius. Faun. Groenl.</hi> p. <num value="46">46</num>. Its length was <num value="24">twenty-four</num> feet. Mr. <hi rend=italics>J. Hunter</hi> has given a good figure of it in <hi rend=italics>Phil. Trans.</hi> vol. lxxvii. tab. xvi.
<p>ANOTHER, which is engraven by the same gentleman, in plate xvii. was of the length of eighteen feet, thick in proportion to its length, and very deep bellied. I think it a new species.
<p>A SPECIES allied to the <hi rend=italics>Delphinus, Delphis,</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Dolphin,</hi> <num value="21">twenty-one</num> feet long, was taken in <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>, above <hi rend=italics>London-bridge.</hi> The nose is protracted and slender, like that of the Dolphin, but much shorter. It differs from the Bottle-nosed Whale of Mr. <hi rend=italics>Dale,</hi>
<pb id="p.634" n="634"> in several particulars. The nose does not turn up at the end; the body is slender, the dorsal fin placed near the tail; and, as Mr. <hi rend=italics>Hunter</hi> observes, has a very specific mark, <num value="2">two</num> very small pointed teeth in the fore part of the upper jaw. This is engraven in plate xx. of the same volume of the Transactions; and has furnished a <num value="2">second</num> new species discovered by our great anatomist.<note><hi rend=italics><num value="2">Two</num>-toothed Cachalot.

<p>THE common porpesses frequently run up the <hi rend=italics>Thames</hi> in numbers, and afford an eager diversion to the watermen.
<p>I WILL conclude this account with the fine lines written by Sir <hi rend=italics>John Denham</hi> on this our celebrated river: and in a manner worthy of the greatness of the subject:

<L>And hatches plenty for th&lsquo; ensuing spring;
<L>Nor then destroys it with too fond a stay,
<L>Like mothers which their infants overlay;

<L>So that to us no thing, no place is strange,
<L>While his fair bosom is the world's exchange.
<L>O could I flow like thee, and make thy stream
