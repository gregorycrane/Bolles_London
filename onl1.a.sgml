<p>Writing the history of a vast city like London is like writing a history of the ocean--the area is so vast, its inhabitants are so multifarious, the treasures that lie in its depths so countless. What aspect of the great chameleon city shall <num value="1">one</num> select? for, as Boswell, with more than his usual sense, once remarked, <QUOTE>London is to the politician merely a seat of government, to the grazier a cattle market, to the merchant a huge exchange, to the dramatic enthusiast a congeries of theatres, to the man of pleasure an assemblage of taverns.</QUOTE> If we follow <num value="1">one</num> path alone, we must neglect other roads equally important; let us, then, consider the metropolis as a whole, for, as Johnson's friend well says, <QUOTE>the intellectual man is struck with London as comprehending the whole of human life in all its variety, the contemplation of which is inexhaustible.</QUOTE> In histories, in biographies, in scientific records, and in chronicles of the past, however humble, let us gather materials for a record of the great and the wise, the base and the noble, the odd and the witty, who have inhabited London and left their names upon its walls. Wherever the glimmer of the cross of St. Paul's can be seen, we shall wander from street to alley, from alley to street, noting almost every event of interest that has taken place there since London became a city. <pb id="p.2" n="2">
<P>Had it been our lot to write of London before the Great Fire, we should have only had to visit <num value="65000">65,000</num> houses. If in Dr. Johnson's time, we might have done like energetic Dr. Birch, and have perambulated the <num value="20">twenty</num>-mile circuit of London in <num value="6">six</num> hours' hard walking; but who now could put a girdle round the metropolis in less than double that time? The houses now grow by streets at a time, and the nearly <num value="4">four</num> million inhabitants would take a lifetime to study. Addison probably knew something of London when he called it <QUOTE>an aggregate of various nations, distinguished from each other by their respective customs, manners, and interests--the St. James's courtiers from the Cheapside citizens, the Temple lawyers from the Smithfield drovers ;</QUOTE> but what would the <title>Spectator</title>
say now to the <num value="157600">157,600</num> domestic servants, the <num value="33600">33,600</num> commercial clerks, the <num value="3600">3,600</num> carpenters, the <num value="81900">81,900</num> dressmakers, the <num value="3000">3,000</num> shoemakers, the <num value="23500">23,500</num> tailors, the <num value="12000">12,000</num> butchers, the <num value="7000">7,000</num> publicans, &amp;c., to which the population returns of <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct> depose, all of whom he would have to observe and visit before he could say he knew all the ways, oddities, humours--the joys and sorrows, in fact-of this great centre of civilisation?
<p>The houses of old London are incrusted as thick with anecdotes, legends, and traditions as an old ship is with barnacles. Strange stories about strange men grow like moss in every crevice of its bricks. Let us, then, roll together like a great snowball the mass of information that time and our predecessors have accumulated, and reduce it to some shape and form. Old London is passing away even as we dip our pen in the ink, and we would fain erect quickly our itinerant photographic machine, and secure some views of it before it is gone. Roman London, Saxon London, Norman London, Elizabethan London, Stuart London, Queen Anne's London, we shall in turn rifle to fill our museum, on whose shelves the Roman lamp and the vessel full of tears will stand side by side with Vanessa's fan; the sword-knot of Rochester by, the note-book of Goldsmith. The history of London is an epitome of the history of England. Few great men indeed that England has produced but have some associations that connect them with London. To be able to recall these associations in a London walk is a pleasure perpetually renewing, and to all intents inexhaustible.
<p>Let us, then, at once, without longer halting at the gate, seize the pilgrim staff and start upon our voyage of discovery, through a dreamland that will be now Goldsmith's, now Gower's, now Shakespeare's, now Pope's London. In Cannon Street, by the old central milestone of London, grave Romans will meet us and talk of Caesar and his legions. In Fleet Street we shall come upon Chaucer beating the malapert Franciscan friar; at Temple Bar, stare upwards at the ghastly Jacobite heads. In Smithfield we shall meet Froissart's knights riding to the tournament; in the Strand see the misguided Earl of Essex defending his house against Queen Elizabeth's troops, who are turning towards him the cannon on the roof of St. Clement's church.
<p>But let us <num value="1">first</num>, rather than glance at scattered pictures in a gallery which is so full of them, measure out, as it were, our future walks, briefly glancing at the special doors where we shall billet our readers. This brief summary will serve to broadly epitomise the subject, and will prove the ceaseless variety of interest which it involves.
<p>We have selected Temple Bar, that old gateway, as a point of departure, because it is the centre, as near as can be, of historical London. It is in itself full of interest. We begin with it as a rude wooden building, which, after the Great Fire, Wren turned into an arch of stone, with a room above, where Messrs. Childs, the bankers, used to store their books and archives. The heads of some of the Rye House conspirators, in Charles II.'s time, <num value="1">first</num> adorned the Bar; and after that, <num value="1">one</num> after the other, many rash Jacobite heads, in <datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct>, arrived at the same bad eminence. In many a royal procession and many a City riot, this gate has figured as a halting-place and a point of defence. The last rebel's head was blown down in <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>; and the last spike was not removed till the beginning of the present century. In the Popish Plot days of Charles II. vast processions used to come to Temple Bar to illuminate the supposed statue of Queen Elizabeth, in the south-east niche (though it probably really represented Anne of Denmark); and at great bonfires at the Temple gate the frenzied people burned effigies of the Pope, while thousands of squibs were discharged, with shouts that frightened the Popish Portuguese Queen, at that time living at Somerset House, forsaken by her dissolute scapegrace of a husband.
<p>Turning our faces now towards the black dome that rises like a half-eclipsed planet over Ludgate Hill, we <num value="1">first</num> pass along Fleet Street, a locality full to overflowing with ancient memorials, and in its modern aspect not less interesting. This street has been from time immemorial the high road for royal r processions. Richard II. has passed along here to
<p>St. Paul's, his parti-coloured robes jingling with golden bells; and Queen Elizabeth, be-ruffled and be-fardingaled, has glanced at those gable-ends east <pb id="p.3" n="3"> of St. Dunstan's, as she rode in her cumbrous plumed coach to thank God at St. Paul's for the scattering and shattering of the Armada. Here Cromwell, a king in all but name and twice a king by nature, received the keys of the City, as he rode to Guildhall to preside at the banquet of the obsequious Mayor. William of Orange and Queen Anne both clattered over these stones to return thanks for victories over the French; so did George III., when he came to thank God for his partial restoration from insanity; and so did Queen Victoria in <datestruct value="1872--"><year reg="1872">1872</year></datestruct>, to give thanks for the recovery of the Prince of Wales from grievous sickness.
<p>We recall many odd figures in this street: the old printers who succeeded Caxton, who published for Shakespeare or who timidly speculated in Milton's epic, that great product of a sorry age; next, the old bankers, who, at Child's and Hoare's, laid the foundations of permanent wealth, and from simple City goldsmiths were gradually transformed to great capitalists. Izaak Walton, honest shopkeeper and patient angler, eyes us from his latticed window near Chancery Lane; and close by we see the child Cowley reading the <title>Fairy Queen</title> in a window-seat, and already feeling in himself the inspiration of his later years. The lesser celebrities of later times call to us as we pass. Garrick's friend Hardham, of the snuff-shop; and that busy, vain demagogue, Alderman Waithman, whom Cobbett abused because he was not zealous enough for poor hunted Queen Caroline. Then there are the shop where barometers were <num value="1">first</num> sold, the great watchmakers, Tompion and Pinchbeck, to chronicle, and the <num value="2">two</num> churches to notice. St. Dunstan's is interesting for its early preachers, the good Romaine and the pious Baxter; and St. Bride's has anecdotes and legends of its own, and a peal of bells which have in their time excited as much admiration as those giant hammermen at the old St. Dunstan's clock, which are now in Regent's Park. The newspaper offices, too, furnish many curious illustrations of the progress of that great organ of modern civilisation, the press. At the <QUOTE>Devil</QUOTE> we meet Ben Jonson and his club; and at John Murray's old shop we stop to see Byron lunging with his stick at favourite volumes on the shelves, to the bookseller's great but concealed annoyance. Nor do we forget, to sketch Dr. Johnson at Temple Bar, bantering his fellow Jacobite, Goldsmith, about the warning heads upon the gate; at Child's bank pausing to observe the dinnerless authors returning downcast at the rejection of brilliant but fruitless proposals; or stopping with Boswell, <num value="1">one</num> hand upon a street post, to shake the night air with his Cyclopean laughter. Varied as the colours in a kaleidoscope are the figures that will meet us in these perambulations; mutable as an opal are the feelings they arouse. To the man of facts they furnish facts; to the man of imagination, quick-changing fancies; to the man of science, curious memoranda; to the historian, bright-worded details, that vivify old pictures now often dim in tone; to the man of the world, traits of manners; to the general thinker, aspects of feelings and of passions which expand the knowledge of human nature; for all these many-coloured stones are joined by the <num value="1">one</num> golden string of London's history.
<p>But if Fleet Street itself is rich in associations, its side streets, north and south, are yet richer. Here anecdote and story are clustered in even closer compass. In these side binns lies hid the choicest wine; for when Fleet Street had long since become <num value="2">two</num> vast rows of shops, authors, wits, poets, and memorable persons of all kinds, still inhabited the <QUOTE>closes</QUOTE> and alleys that branch from the main thoroughfare. Nobles and lawyers long dwelt round St. Dunstan's and St. Bride's. Scholars, poets, and literati of all kind, long sought refuge from the grind and busy roar of commerce in the quiet inns and <QUOTE>closes,</QUOTE> north and south. In what was Shire Lane we come upon the great Kit-Kat Club, where Addison, Garth, Steele, and Congreve disported; and we look in on that very evening when the Duke of Kingston, with fatherly pride, brought his little daughter, afterwards Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and, setting her on the table, proposed her as a toast. Following the lane down till it becomes a nest of coiners, thieves, and bullies, we pass on to Bell Yard, to call on Pope's lawyer friend, Fortescue; and in Chancery Lane we are deep among the lawyers again. Ghosts of Jarndyces v. Jarndyces, from the Middle Ages downwards, haunt this thoroughfare, where Wolsey once lived in his pride and state. Izaak Walton dwelt in this lane once upon a time; and that mischievous adviser of Charles I., the Earl of Strafford, was born here. Hazlitt resided in Southampton Buildings when he fell in love with the tailor's daughter and wrote that most stultifying confession of his vanity and weakness, <title>The New Pygmalion.</title> Fetter Lane brings us fresh stores of subjects, all essentially connected with the place, deriving an interest from and imparting a new interest to it. Praise-God-Barebones, Dryden, Otway, Baxter, and Mrs. Brownrigg form truly a strange bouquet. By mutual contrast the incongruous group serves, however, to illustrate various epochs of London life, and the background serves to explain the actions and the social position of each and all these motley beings. <pb id="p.4" n="4">
<p>In Crane Court, the early home of the Royal Society, Newton is the central personage; and we tarry to sketch the progress of science and to smile at the crudity of its early experiments and theories. In Bolt Court we pause to see a great man die. Here especially Dr. Johnson's figure ever stands like a statue, and we shall find his black servant at the door and his dependents wrangling in the front parlour. Burke and Boswell are on their way to call, and Reynolds is taking coach in the adjoining street. Nor is even Shoe Lane without its associations, for at the north-east end the corpse of poor, dishonoured Chatterton lies still under some neglected rubbish heap; and close by the brilliant Cavalier poet, Lovelace, pined and perished, almost in beggary.
<p>The southern side of Fleet Street is somewhat less noticeable. Still, in Salisbury Square the worthy old printer Richardson, amid the din of a noisy office, wrote his great and pathetic novels; while in Mitre Buildings Charles Lamb held those delightful conversations, so full of quaint and kindly thoughts, which were shared in by Hazlitt and all the people whom Lamb has immortalised in
<title>Elia </title>--bibulous Burney, George Dyer, Holcroft, Coleridge, Hone, Godwin, and Leigh Hunt.
<p>Whitefriars and Blackfriars are our next places of pilgrimage, and they open up quite new lines of reading and of thought. Though the Great Fire swept them bare, no district of London has preserved its old lines so closely; and, walking in Whitefriars, we can still stare through the gate that once barred off the brawling Copper Captains of Charles II.'s Alsatia from the contemptuous Templars of King's Bench Walk. Whitefriars was at <num value="1">first</num> a Carmelite convent, founded, before Blackfriars, on land given by Edward I.; the chapter-house was given by Henry II. to his physician, Dr. Butts (a man mentioned by Shakespeare), and in the reign of Edward VI. the church was demolished. Whitefriars then, though still partially inhabited by great people, soon sank into a sanctuary for runaway bankrupts, cheats, and gamblers. The hall of the monastery was turned into a theatre, where many of Dryden's plays <num value="1">first</num> appeared. The players favoured this quarter, where, in the reign of James I., <num value="2">two</num> henchmen of Lord Sanquhar, a revengeful young Scottish nobleman, shot at his own door a poor fencing-master, who had accidentally put out their master's eye several years before in a contest of skill. The <num value="2">two</num> men were hung opposite the Whitefriars gate in Fleet Street. This disreputable and lawless nest of river-side alleys was called Alsatia, from its resemblance to the seat of the war then raging on the frontiers of France, in the dominions of King James's son-in-law, the Prince Palatine. Its roystering bullies and shifty money-lenders are admirably sketched by Shadwell in his <title>Squire of Alsatia</title>, an excellent comedy freely used by Sir Walter Scott in his <title>Fortunes of Nigel,</title> who has laid several of his strongest scenes in this once scampish region. That great scholar Selden lived in Whitefriars with the Countess Dowager of Kent, whom he was supposed to have married; and, singularly enough, the best edition of his works was printed in Dogwell Court, Whitefriars, by those eminent printers, Bowyer & Son. At the back of Whitefriars we come upon Bridewell, the site of a palace of the Norman kings. Cardinal Wolsey afterwards owned the house, which Henry VIII. reclaimed in his rough and not very scrupulous manner. It was the old palace to which Henry summoned all the priors and abbots of England, and where he <num value="1">first</num> announced his intention of divorcing Katherine of Arragon. After this it fell into decay. The good Ridley, the martyr, begged it of Edward VI. for a workhouse and a school. Hogarth painted the female prisoners here beating hemp under the lash of a cruel turnkey; and Pennant has left a curious sketch of the herd of girls whom he saw run like hounds to be fed when a gaoler entered.
<p>If Whitefriars was inhabited by actors, Blackfriars was equally favoured by players and by painters. The old convent, removed from Holborn, was often used for Parliaments. Charles V. lodged here when he came over to win Henry against Francis; and Burbage, the great player of
<title>Richard the <num value="3">Third</num>,</title> built a theatre in Blackfriars, because the Precinct was out of the jurisdiction of the City, then ill-disposed to the players. Shakespeare had a house here, which he left to his favourite daughter, the deed of conveyance of which sold, in <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, for <measure value="165l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="165">165</num></measure> <measure value="15s." type=currency><num value="15">15</num>s.</measure> He must have thought of his well-known neighbourhood when he wrote the scenes of Henry VIII., where Katherine was divorced and Wolsey fell, for both events were decided in Blackfriars Parliaments. Oliver, the great miniature painter, and Jansen, a favourite portrait painter of James I., lived in Blackfriars, where we shall call upon them; and Vandyke spent <num value="9">nine</num> happy years here by the river side. The most remarkable event connected with Blackfriars is the falling in of the floor of a Roman Catholic private chapel in <datestruct value="1623--"><year reg="1623">1623</year></datestruct>, by which <num value="59">fifty-nine</num> persons perished, including the priest, to the exultation of the Puritans, who pronounced the event a visitation of Heaven on Popish superstition. Pamphlets of the time, well rummaged by us, describe the scene with curious exactness, and mention the singular <pb id="p.5" n="5"> escapes of several persons on the <title>Fatal Vespers,</title>
as they were afterwards called.
<p>Leaving the racket of Alsatia and its wild doings behind us, we come next to that great monastery of lawyers, the Temple--like Whitefriars and Blackfriars, also the site of a bygone convent. The warlike Templars came here in their white cloaks and red crosses from their <num value="1">first</num> establishment in Southampton Buildings, and they held it during all the Crusades, in which they fought so valorously against the Paynim, till they grew proud and corrupt, and were suspected of worshipping idols and ridiculing Christianity. Their work done, they perished, and the Knights of St. John took possession of their halls, church, and cloisters. The incoming lawyers became tenants of the Crown, and the parade-ground of the Templars and the river-side terrace and gardens were tenanted by more peaceful occupants. The manners and customs of the lawyers of various ages, their quaint revels, fox-huntings in hall, and dances round the coal fire, deserve special notice; and swarms of anecdotes and odd sayings and doings buzz round us as we write of the various denizens of the Temple--Dr. Johnson, Goldsmith, Lamb, Coke, Plowden, Jefferies, Cowper, Butler, Parsons, Sheridan, and Tom Moore; and we linger at the pretty little fountain and think of those who have celebrated its praise. Every binn of this cellar of lawyers has its story, and a volume might well be written in recording the toils and struggles, successes and failures, of the illustrious owners of Temple chambers.
<p>Thence we pass to Ludgate, where that old London inn, the <QUOTE>Belle Sauvage,</QUOTE> calls up associations of the early days of theatres, especially of Banks and his wonderful performing horse, that walked up <num value="1">one</num> of the towers of Old St. Paul's. Hone's shop will remind us of the delightful books he published, aided by Lamb and Leigh Hunt. The ancient entrance of the city, Ludgate, has quite a history of its own. It was a debtors' prison, rebuilt in the time of King John from the remains of demolished Jewish houses, and was enlarged by the widow of Stephen Forster, Lord Mayor in the reign of Henry VI., who, tradition says, had been himself a prisoner in Ludgate, till released by a rich widow, who saw his handsome face through the grate, and married him. St. Martin's Church, Ludgate, is <num value="1">one</num> of Wren's churches, and is chiefly remarkable for its stolid conceit in always getting in the way of the west front of St. Paul's.
<p>The great Cathedral has been the scene of events that illustrate almost every age of English history. This is the <num value="3">third</num> St. Paul's. The <num value="1">first</num>, often supposed to have been built on the site of a Roman temple of Diana, was burnt down in the last year of William the Conqueror. Innumerable events connected with the history of the City happened here, from the killing a bishop at the north door, in the reign of Edward II., to the public exposure of Richard II.'s body after his murder; while at the Cross in the churchyard the authorities of the City, and even our kings, often attended the public sermons, and in the same place the citizens once held their Folkmotes, riotous enough on many an occasion. Great men's tombs abounded in Old St. Paul's-John of Gaunt, Lord Bacon's father, Sir Philip Sydney, Donne, the poet, and Vandyke being very prominent among them. Fired by lightning in Elizabeth's reign, when the Cathedral had become a resort of newsmongers and a thoroughfare for porters and carriers, it was partly rebuilt in Charles I.'s reign by Inigo Jones. The repairs were stopped by the civil wars, when the Puritans seized the funds, pulled down the scaffolding, and turned the church into a cavalry barrack. The Great Fire swept all clear for Wren, who now found a fine field for his genius; but vexatious difficulties embarrassed him at the very outset. His <num value="1">first</num> great plan was rejected, and. the Duke of York (afterwards James II.) is said to have insisted on side recesses, that might serve as chantry chapels when the church became Roman Catholic. Wren was accused of delays and chidden for the faults of petty workmen, and, as the Duchess of Marlborough laughingly remarked, was dragged up and down in a basket <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> times a week for a paltry <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="200">200</num></measure> year. The narrow escape of Sir James Thornhill from falling from a scaffold while painting the dome is a tradition of St. Paul's, matched by the terrible adventure of Mr. Gwyn, who when measuring the dome slid down the convex surface till his foot was stayed by a small projecting lump of lead. This, leads us naturally on to the curious monomaniac who believed himself the slave of a demon who lived in the bell of the Cathedral, and whose case is singularly deserving of analysis. We shall give a short sketch of the heroes whose tombs have been admitted into St. Paul's, and having come to those of the great demi-gods of the old wars, Nelson and Wellington, pass to anecdotes about the clock and bells, and arrive at the singular story of the soldier whose life was saved by his proving that he had heard St. Paul's clock strike <num value="13">thirteen</num>. Queen Anne's statue in the churchyard, too, has given rise to epigrams worthy of preservation, and the progress of the restoration of the Cathedral will be carefully detailed.
<p>Cheapside, famous from the Saxon days, next invites our wandering feet. The north side remained a field as late as the reign of Edward III., <pb id="p.6" n="6"> and tournaments were held there. The knights, whose deeds Froissart has immortalised, broke spears there, in the presence of the Queen and her ladies, who smiled on their champions from a wooden tower erected across the street. Afterwards a stone shed was raised for the same sights, and there Henry VIII., disguised as a yeoman, with a halbert on his shoulder, came on <num value="1">one</num> occasion to see the great City procession of the night watch by torchlight on St. John's Eve. Wren afterwards, when he rebuilt Bow Church, provided a balcony in the tower for the Royal Family to witness similar pageants. Old Bow Church, we must not forget to record, was seized in the reign of Richard I. by Longbeard, the desperate ringleader of a Saxon
<FIGURE id="Fig.006" n="2000.06.0004"><HEAD>The Old Wooden Temple Bar (see page <num value="2">2</num>).  As Erected in the Reign of James I.</HEAD></figure>
 rising, who was besieged there, and eventually burned out and put to death. The great Cross of Cheapside recalls many interesting associations, for it was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="9">nine</num> Eleanor crosses. Regilt for many coronations, it was eventually pulled down by the Puritans during the civil wars. Then there was the Standard, near Bow Church, where Wat Tyler and Jack Cade beheaded several objectionable nobles and citizens; and the great Conduit at the east end--each with its memorable history. But the great feature of Cheapside is, after all, Guildhall. This is the hall which Whittington paved and where Walworth once ruled. In Guildhall Lady Jane Grey and her husband were tried; here the Jesuit Garnet was arraigned <pb id="p.7" n="7">
<FIGURE id="Fig.007" n="2000.06.0005"><HEAD>South-East View of London in <datestruct value="1550--"><year reg="1550">1550</year></datestruct>
<LB>From an Engraving by Wood, in Mr. Crace's Collection.</HEAD></figure>
 <pb id="p.8" n="8"> for his share in the Gunpowder Plot; here also Charles I. appealed to the Common Council to arrest Hampden and the other patriots who had fled from his eager claws into the friendly City; and here, in the spot still sacred to liberty, the Lords and Parliament declared for the Prince of Orange. To pass this spot without some salient anecdotes of the various Lord Mayors would be a disgrace; and the banquets themselves, from that of Whittington, when he threw Henry V.'s bonds for <num value="60000">60,000</num> into a spice bonfire, to those in the present reign, deserve some notice and comment. The curiosities of Guildhall in themselves are not to be lightly passed over, for they record many vicissitudes of the great City; and Gog and Magog are personages of importance secondary only to that of Lord Mayor.
<p>Then the Mansion House, built in <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>, leads us to much chat about <QUOTE>gold chains, warm furs, broad banners and broad faces;</QUOTE> for a folio might be well filled with curious anecdotes of the Lord Mayors of various ages--from Sir John Norman, who <num value="1">first</num> went in procession to Westminster by water, to Sir John Shorter (James II.), who was killed by a fall from his horse as he stopped at Newgate, according to custom, to take a tankard of wine, nutmeg, and sugar. There is a word to say of many a celebrity in the long roll of Mayors--more especially of Beckford, who is said to have startled George III. by a violent patriotic remonstrance, and of the notorious John Wilkes, that ugly demagogue, who led the City in many an attack on the King and his unwise Ministers.
<p>The tributaries of Cheapside also abound in interest, and mark various stages in the history of the great City. Bread Street was the bread market of the time of Edward I., and is especially honoured for being the birthplace of Milton; and in Milk Street (the old milk market) Sir Thomas More was born. Gutter Lane reminds us of its <num value="1">first</num> Danish owner; and many other turnings have their memorable legends and traditions.
<p>The Halls of the City Companies, the great hospitals, and Gothic schools, will each by turn detain us; and we shall not forget to call at the Bank, the South-Sea House, and other great proofs of past commercial folly and present wealth. The Bank, projected by a Scotch theorist in <datestruct value="1691--"><year reg="1691">1691</year></datestruct> (William III.), after many migrations, settled down in Threadneedle Street in <datestruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></datestruct>. It has a, history of its own, and we shall see during the Gordon Riots the old pewter inkstands melted down for bullets, and, prodigy of prodigies! Wilkes himself rushing out to seize the cowardly ringleaders!
<p>By many old houses of good pedigree and by several City churches worthy a visit, we come at last to the Monument, which Wren erected and which Cibber decorated. This pillar, which Pope compared to <QUOTE>a tall bully,</QUOTE> once bore an inscription that greatly offended the Court. It attributed the Great Fire of London, which began close by there, to the Popish faction; but the words were erased in <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>. Littleton, who compiled the Dictionary, once wrote a Latin inscription for the Monument, which contained the names of <num value="7">seven</num> Lord Mayors in <num value="1">one</num> word:--
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Fordo-Watermanno-Harrisono-Hookero-Vinero-Sheldono-Davisonam.</QUOTE>
 But the learned production was, singularly enough, never used. The word, which Littleton called <QUOTE>an heptastic vocable,</QUOTE> comprehended the names of the <num value="7">seven</num> Lord Mayors in whose mayoralties the Monument was begun, continued, and completed.
<p>On London Bridge we might linger for many chapters. The <num value="1">first</num> bridge thrown over the Thames was a wooden <num value="1">one</num>, erected by the nuns of St. Mary's Monastery, a convent of sisters endowed by the daughter of a rich Thames ferryman. The bridge figures as a fortified place in the early Danish invasions, and the Norwegian Prince Olaf nearly dragged it to pieces in trying to dispossess the Danes, who held it in <datestruct value="1008--"><year reg="1008">1008</year></datestruct>. It was swept away in a flood, and its successor was burnt. In the reign of Henry II., Pious Peter, a chaplain of St. Mary Colechurch, in the Poultry, built a stone bridge a little further west, and the king helped him with the proceeds of a tax on wool, which gave rise to the old saying that <QUOTE>London Bridge was built upon woolpacks.</QUOTE> Peter's bridge was a curious structure, with <num value="19">nineteen</num> pointed arches and a drawbridge. There was a fortified gatehouse at each end, and a gothic chapel towards the centre, dedicated to St. Thomas &agrave; Becket, the murdered Archbishop of Canterbury. In Queen Elizabeth's reign there were shops on either side, with flat roofs, arbours, and gardens, and at the south end rose a great <num value="4">four</num>-storey wooden house, brought from Holland, which was covered with carving and gilding. In the Middle Ages, London Bridge was the scene of affrays of all kinds. Soon after it was built, the houses upon it caught fire at both ends, and <num value="3000">3,000</num> persons perished, wedged in among the flames. Henry III. was driven back here by the rebellious De Montfort, Earl of Leicester. Wat Tyler entered the City by London Bridge; and, later, Richard II. was received here with gorgeous ceremonies. It was the scene of <num value="1">one</num> of Henry V.'s greatest triumphs, and also <pb id="p.9" n="9"> of his stately funeral procession. Jack Cade seized London Bridge, and as he passed slashed in <num value="2">two</num> the ropes of the drawbridge, though soon after his head was stuck on the gate-house. From this bridge the rebel Wyatt was driven by the guns of the Tower; and in Elizabeth's reign waterworks were erected on the bridge. There was a great conflagration on the bridge in <datestruct value="1632--"><year reg="1632">1632</year></datestruct>, and eventually the Great Fire almost destroyed it. In the Middle Ages countless rebels' heads were stuck on the gate-houses of London Bridge. Brave Wallace's was placed there; and so were the heads of Henry VIII.'s victims--Fisher, Bishop of Rochester and Sir Thomas More, the latter trophy being carried off by the stratagem of his brave daughter. Garnet, the Gunpowder-Plot Jesuit, also contributed to the ghastly triumphs of justice. Several celebrated painters, including Hogarth, lived at <num value="1">one</num> time or another on the bridge; and Swift and Pope used to frequent the shop of a witty bookseller, who lived Under the northern gate. <num value="1">One</num> or <num value="2">two</num> celebrated suicides have taken place at London Bridge, and among these we may mention that of Sir William Temple's son; who was Secretary of War, and Eustace Budgell, a brokendown author, who left behind him as an apology the following sophism :--
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>What Cato did and Addison approved, cannot be wrong.</QUOTE>
Pleasanter is it to remember the anecdote of the brave apprentice, who leaped into the Thames from the window of a house on the bridge to save his master's infant daughter, whom a careless nurse had dropped into the river. When the girl grew up, many noble suitors came, but the generous father was obdurate. <QUOTE>No,</QUOTE> said the honest citizen; <QUOTE>Osborne saved her, and Osborne shall have her.</QUOTE> , And so he had; and Osborne's great grandson throve and became the <num value="1">first</num> Duke of Leeds, The frequent loss of lives in shooting the arches of the old bridge, where the fall was at times <num value="5">five</num> feet, led at last to a cry for a new bridge, and <num value="1">one</num> was commenced in <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>. Jennie designed it, and in <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct> William IV. and Queen Adelaide opened it. <num value="120000">One hundred and twenty thousand</num> tons of stone went to its formation. The old bridge was not entirely removed till <datestruct value="1832"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>, when the bones of the builder, Pious Peter of Colechurch, were found in the crypt of the central chapel, where tradition had declared they lay. The iron of the piles of the old bridge was bought by a cutler in the Strand, and produced steel of the highest quality. Part of the old stone was purchased by Alderman Harmer, to build his house, Ingress Abbey, near Greenhithe.
<p>Southwark, a Roman station and cemetery, is by no means without a history. It was burned by William the Conqueror, and had been the scene of battles against the Danes. It possessed palaces, monasteries, a mint, and fortifications. The Bishops of Winchester and Rochester once lived here in splendour; and the locality boasted its <num value="4">four</num> Elizabethan theatres. The Globe was Shakespeare's summer theatre, and here it was that his greatest triumphs were attained. What was acted there is best told by making Shakespeare's share in the management distinctly understood; nor can we leave Southwark without visiting the Tabard Inn, from whence Chaucer's <num value="9">nine</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num> jovial pilgrims set out for Canterbury.
<p>The Tower rises next before our eyes; and as we pass under its battlements the grimmest and most tragic scenes of English history seem again rising before us. Whether Caesar <num value="1">first</num> built a tower here or William the Conqueror, may never be decided; but <num value="1">one</num> thing is certain, that more tears have been shed within these walls than anywhere else in London. Every stone has its story. Here, Wallace, in chains, thought of Scotland; here Queen Anne Boleyn placed her white hands round her slender neck, and said the headsman would have little trouble. Here Catharine Howard, Sir Thomas More, Cranmer, Northumberland, Lady Jane Grey, Wyatt, and the Earl of Essex all perished. Here, Clarence was drowned in a butt of wine and the <num value="2">two</num> boy princes were murdered. Many victims of kings, many kingly victims, have here perished. Many patriots have here sighed for liberty. The poisoning of Overbury is a mystery of the Tower, the perusal of which never wearies though the dark secret be unsolvable; and we can never cease to sympathise with that brave woman, the Countess of Nithsdale, who risked her life to save her husband's. From Laud and Strafford we turn to Eliot and Hutchinson--for Cavaliers and Puritans were both by turns prisoners in the Tower. From Lord William Russell and Algernon Sydney we come down in the chronicle of suffering to the Jacobites of <datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct>; from them to Wilkes, Lord George Gordon, Burdett, and, last of all the Tower prisoners, to the infamous Thistlewood.
<p>Leaving the crimson scaffold on Tower Hill, we return as sightseers to glance over the armoury and to catch the sparkle of the Royal jewels. Here is the identical crown which the daring villain, Blood, stole, and the heart-shaped ruby that the Black Prince once wore; here we see the swords, sceptres, and diadems of many of our monarchs. In the <pb id="p.10" n="10"> armoury are suits on which many lances have splintered and swords struck; the imperishable steel clothes of many a dead king are here, unchanged since the owners doffed them. This suit was the Earl of Leicester's--the <QUOTE>Kenilworth</QUOTE> earl, for see his cognizance of the bear and ragged staff on the horse's chanfron. This richly-gilt suit was worn by the ill-starred son of James II., Prince Henry, who, as many thought, was poisoned by Buckingham; and this quaint mask, with ram's horns and spectacles, belonged to Will Somers, Henry VIII.'s jester.
<p>From the Tower we break away into the far east, among the old clothes shops, the bird markets, the costermongers, and the weavers of Whitechapel and Spitalfields. We are far from jewels here and Court splendour, and we come to plain working people and their homely ways. Spitalfields was the site of a priory of Augustine canons, however, and has ancient traditions of its own. The weavers, of French origin, are an interesting race--we shall have to sketch their sayings and doings; and we shall search Whitechapel diligently for old houses and odd people. The district may not furnish so many interesting scenes and anecdotes as the West End, but it is well worthy of study from many modern points of view.
<p>Smithfield and Holborn are regions fertile in associations. Smithfield, that broad plain, the scene of so many martyrdoms, tournaments, and executions, forms an interesting subject for a diversified chapter. In this market-place the ruffians of Henry VIII.'s time met to fight out their quarrels with sword and buckler. Here the brave Wallace was executed like a common robber; and here <QUOTE>the gentle Mortimer</QUOTE> was led to a shameful death. The spot was the scene of great jousts in Edward III.'s chivalrous reign, when, after the battle of Poictiers, the Kings of France and Scotland came <num value="7">seven</num> days running to see spears shivered and <QUOTE>the Lady of the Sun</QUOTE> bestow the prizes of valour. In this same field Walworth slew the rebel Wat Tyler, who had treated Richard II. with insolence, and by this prompt blow dispersed the insurgents, who had grown so dangerously strong. In Henry VIII.'s reign poisoners were boiled to death in Smithfield; and in cruel Mary's reign the Protestant martyrs were burned in the same place. <QUOTE>Of the <num value="277">two hundred and seventy-seven</num> persons burnt for heresy in Mary's reign,</QUOTE> says a modern antiquary, <QUOTE>the greater number perished in Smithfield; and ashes and charred bodies have been dug up opposite to the gateway of Bartholomew's Church and at the west end of Long Lane.</QUOTE> After the Great Fire the houseless citizens were sheltered here in tents. Over against the corner where the Great Fire abated is Cock Lane, the scene of the rapping ghost, in which Dr. Johnson believed and concerning which Goldsmith wrote a catchpenny pamphlet.
<p>Holborn and its tributaries come next, and are by no means deficient in legends and matter of general interest. <QUOTE>The original name of the street was the Hollow Bourne,</QUOTE> says a modern etymologist, <QUOTE>not the Old Bourne;</QUOTE> it was not paved till the reign of Henry V. The ride up <QUOTE>the Heavy Hill</QUOTE> from Newgate to Tyburn has been sketched by Hogarth and sung by Swift. In Ely Place once lived the Bishop of Ely; and in Hatton Garden resided Queen Elizabeth's favourite, the dancing chancellor, Sir Christopher Hatton. In Furnival's Inn Dickens wrote <title>Pickwick.</title> In Barnard's Inn died the last of the alchemists. In Staple's Inn Dr. Johnson wrote <title>Rasselas,</title> to pay the expenses of his mother's funeral. In Brooke Street, where Chatterton poisoned himself, lived Lord Brooke, a poet and statesman, who was a patron of Ben Jonson and Shakespeare, and who was assassinated by a servant whose name he had omitted in his will. Milton lived for some time in a house in Holborn that opened at the back on Lincoln's Inn Fields. Fox Court leads us to the curious inquiry whether Savage, the poet. was a conscious or an unconscious impostor; and at the Blue Boar Inn Cromwell and Ireton discovered by stratagem the treacherous letter of King Charles to his queen, that rendered Cromwell for ever the King's enemy. These are only a few of the countless associations of Holborn.
<p>Newgate is a gloomy but an interesting subject for us. Many wild faces have stared through its bars since; in King John's time, it became a City prison. We shall look in on Sarah Malcolm, Mrs. Brownrigg, Jack Sheppard, Governor Wall, and other interesting criminals; we shall stand at Wren's elbow when he designs the new prison, and follow the Gordon Rioters when they storm in over the burning walls.
<p>The Strand stands next to Fleet Street as a central point of old memories. It is not merely full, it positively teems. For centuries it was a fashionable street, and noblemen inhabited the south side especially, for the sake of the river. In Essex Street, on a part of the Temple, Queen Elizabeth's rash favourite (the Earl of Essex) was besieged, after his hopeless foray into the City. In Arundel Street lived the Earls of Arundel; in Buckingham Street Charles I.'s greedy favourite began a palace. There were royal palaces, too, in the Strand, for at the Savoy lived John of Gaunt; old Somerset House was built by the Protector Somerset with <pb id="p.11" n="11"> the stones of the churches he had pulled down. Henrietta Maria (Charles I.'s Queen) and poor neglected Catherine of Braganza dwelt at Somerset House; and it was here that Sir Edmondbury Godfrey, the zealous Protestant magistrate, was supposed to have been murdered. There is, too, the history of Lord Burleigh's house (in Cecil Street) to record; and of Northumberland House, with the recollections of its many noble inmates. On the other side of the Strand we have to note Butcher Row (now pulled down), where the Gunpowder Plot conspirators met; Exeter House, where Lord Burleigh's wily son lived; and, finally, Exeter &lsquo;Change, where the poet Gay lay in state. Nor shall we forget Cross's menagerie and the elephant Chunee; nor omit mention of many of the eccentric old shopkeepers who once inhabited the &lsquo;Change. At Charing Cross we shall stop to see the old Cromwellians die bravely, and to stare at the pillory, where in their time many incomparable scoundrels ignominiously stood. The Nelson Column and the surrounding statues have stories of their own; and St. Martin's Lane is specially interesting as the haunt of half the painters of the early Georgian era. There are anecdotes of Hogarth and his friends to be picked up here in abundance, and the locality generally deserves exploration, from the quaintness and cleverness of its former inhabitants.
<p>In Covent Garden we break fresh ground. We found St. Martin's Lane full of artists, Guildhall full of aldermen, the Strand full of noblemen--the old monastic garden will prove to be crowded with actors. We shall trace the market from the <num value="1">first</num> few sheds under the wall of Bedford House to the present grand temple of Flora and Pomona. We shall see Evans's a new mansion, inhabited by Ben Jonson's friend and patron, Sir Kenelm Digby, alternately tenanted by Sir Harry Vane, Denzil Holles (<num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="5">five</num> refractory members whom Charles I. went to the House of Commons so imprudently to seize), and Admiral Russell, who defeated the French at La Hogue. The ghost of Parson Ford, in which Johnson believed, awaits us at the doorway of the Hummums. There are several duels to witness in the Piazza; Dryden to call upon as he sits, the arbiter of wits, by the fireside at Will's Coffee House; Addison is to be found at Button's; at the <QUOTE>Bedford</QUOTE> we shall meet Garrick and Quin, and stop a moment at Tom King's, close to St. Paul's portico, to watch Hogarth's revellers' fight with swords and shovels, that frosty morning when the painter sketched the prim old maid going to early service. We shall look in at the Tavistock, to see Sir Peter Lely and Sir Godfrey Kneller at work on portraits of beauties of the Carolean and Jacobean Courts; remembering that in the same rooms Sir James Thornhill afterwards painted, and poor Richard Wilson produced those fine landscapes which so few had the taste to buy. The old hustings deserve a word; and we shall have to record the lamentable murder of Miss Ray by her lover, at the north-east angle of the square. The neighbourhood of Covent Garden, too, is rife with stories of great actors and painters, and nearly every house furnishes its quota of anecdote.
<p>The history of Drury Lane--and Covent Garden theatres supplies us with endless anecdotes of actors, and with humorous and pathetic narratives that embrace the whole region both of tragedy and comedy. Quin's jokes, Garrick's weaknesses, the celebrated O. P. riots, contrast with the miserable end of some popular favourites and the caprices of genius. The oddities of Munden, the humour of Liston, only serve to render the gloom of Kean's downfall more terrible, and to show the wreck and ruin of many unhappy men, equally wilful though less gifted. There is a perennial charm about theatrical stories, and the history of these theatres must be illustrated by many a sketch of the loves and rivalries of actors, their fantastic tricks, their practical jokes, their gay progress to success or ruin. Changes of popular taste are marked by the changes of character in the pieces that have been performed in various ages; and the history of the <num value="2">two</num> theatres will include various illustrative sketches of dramatic writers, as well as actors. There was a vast interval in literature between the tragedies of Addison and Murphy and the comedies of Holcroft, O&lsquo;Keefe, and Morton; the descent to modern melodrama and burlesque must be traced through various gradations, and the reasons shown for the many modifications both classes of entertainments have undergone.
<p>Westminster, from the night St. Peter came over from Lambeth in the fisherman's boat, and chose a site for the Abbey in the midst of Thorney Island, to the present day, has been a spot where the pilgrim to historic shrines loves to linger. Need we remind our readers that Edward the Confessor built the Abbey, or that William the Conqueror was crowned here, the ceremony ending in tumult and blood? How vast the store of facts from which we have to cull! We see the Jews being beaten nearly to death for daring to attend the coronation of Richard I.; we observe Edward I. watching the sacred stone of Scotland being placed beneath his coronation chair; we behold for the <num value="1">first</num> time, at Richard II.'s coronation, the champion riding into the Hall, to challenge all who refuse <pb id="p.12" n="12"> allegiance; we see, at the funeral of Anne of Bohemia, Richard beating the Earl of Arundel for wishing to leave before the service is over. We hear the <title lang=la>Te Deum</title> that is sung for the victory of Agincourt, and watch Henry VI. selecting a site for a resting-place; we hear for the last time, at the coronation of Henry VIII., the sanction of the Pope bestowed upon an English monarch; we pity poor Queen Caroline attempting to enter the Abbey to see her worthless husband crowned; and we view the last coronation, and draw auguries of a purer if not a happier age. The old Hall, too; could we neglect that ancient chamber, where Charles I. was sentenced to death, and where Cromwell was throned in almost regal splendour? We must see it in all its special moments; when the <num value="7">seven</num> bishops were acquitted, and the shout of joy shook London as with an earthquake; and when the rebel lords were tried. We must hear Lord Byron tried for his duel with Mr. Chaworth, and mad Lord Ferrers condemned for shooting his steward. We shall get a side-view of the shameless Duchess of Kingston, and hear Burke and Sheridan grow eloquent over the misdeeds of Warren Hastings.
<p>The parks now draw us westward, and we wander
<FIGURE id="Fig.012" n="2000.06.0006"><HEAD>Bridewell In <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct> (see page <num value="4">4</num>.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 through them: in St. James's seeing Charles II. feeding his ducks or playing <QUOTE>pall-mall;</QUOTE> in Hyde Park observing the fashions and extravagancies of many generations. <QUOTE>Romeo</QUOTE> Coates will whisk past us in his fantastic chariot, and the beaus and oddities of many generations will pace past us in review, There will be celebrated duels to describe, and various strange follies to deride. We shall see Cromwell thrown from his coach, and shall witness the foot-races that Pepys describes. Dryden's gallants and masked ladies will receive some mention; and we shall tell of bygone encampments and of many events now almost forgotten.
<p>Kensington will recall many anecdotes of William of Orange, his beloved Queen, stupid Prince George of Denmark, and George II., who all died at the palace, the old seat of the Finches. We are sure to find good company in the gardens. Still as when Tickell sang, every walk
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Seems from afar a moving tulip bed,
<L>Where rich brocades and glossy damasks glow,
<L>And chintz, the rival of the showery bow.</QUOTE>

<p>There is Newton's house at South Kensington to visit, and Wilkie's and Mrs. Inchbald's; and, <pb id="p.13" n="13"> above all, there is Holland House, the scene of the delightful Whig coteries of Tom Moore's time. Here Addison lived to regret his marriage with a lady of rank, and here he died. At Kensington Charles James Fox spent his youth.
<p>And now Chelsea brings us pleasant recollections of Sir Thomas More, Swift, Sir Robert Walpole, and Atterbury. <QUOTE>Chelsith,</QUOTE> Sir Thomas More used to call it when Holbein was lodging in his house and King Henry, who afterwards beheaded his old friend, used to come to dinner, and after dinner walk round the fair garden with his arm round his host's neck. More was fond of walking on the flat roof of his gate-house, which commanded a pleasant prospect of the Thames and the fields beyond. Let us hope the tradition is not true that he used to bind heretics to a tree in his garden. In <datestruct value="1717--"><year reg="1717">1717</year></datestruct> Chelsea contained only <num value="350">350</num> houses, and these in <datestruct value="1725--"><year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct> had grown to <num value="1350">1,350</num>. There is Cheyne Walk, so called from the Lords Cheyne, owners of the manor; and we must not forget Don Saltero and his famous coffee-house, the oddities of which Steele pleasantly sketched in the <title>Tatler</title>. The Don was famous for his skill in brewing punch and for his excellent playing on the
<FIGURE id="Fig.013" n="2000.06.0007"><HEAD>Part Of Modern London, Showing The Ancient Wall (See Page <num value="20">20</num>).</HEAD></figure>
 fiddle. Saltero was a barber, who drew teeth, drew customers, wrote verses, and collected curiosities.
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Some relics of the Sheban queen And fragments of the famed Bob Crusoe.</QUOTE>

<p>Swift lodged at Chelsea, over against the Jacobite Bishop Atterbury, who so nearly lost his head. In <num value="1">one</num> of his delightful letters to Stella Swift describes <QUOTE>the Old Original Chelsea Bun House,</QUOTE> and the r-r-r-r-rare Chelsea buns. He used to leave his best gown and perriwig at Mrs. Vanhomrig's, in Suffolk Street, then walk up Pall Mall, through the park, out at Buckingham House, and on to Chelsea, a little beyond the church (<num value="5748">5,748</num> steps), he says, in less than an hour, which was leisurely walking even for the contemplative and observant dean. Smollet laid a scene of his <title>Humphrey Clinker </title> in Chelsea, where he lived for some time.
<p>The Princess Elizabeth, when a girl, lived at Chelsea, with that dangerous man, with whom she is said to have fallen in love, the Lord Admiral, Seymour, afterwards beheaded. He was the <num value="2">second</num> husband of Katherine Parr, <num value="1">one</num> of the many wives of Elizabeth's father. Cremorne was, in Walpole's days, the villa of Lord Cremorne, an Irish nobleman; and near here, at a river-side <pb id="p.14" n="14"> cottage died, in miserly and cynical obscurity, the greatest of our modern landscape painters, Turner. Then there is Chelsea Hospital to visit. This hospital was built by Wren; Charles II., it is said at Nell Gwynn's suggestion, originated the good work, which was finished by William and Mary. Dr. Arbuthnot, that good man so beloved by the Pope set, was physician here, and the Rev. Philip Francis, who translated Horace, was chaplain. Nor can we leave Chelsea without remembering Sir Hans Sloane, whose collection of antiquities, sold for <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure>, formed the <num value="1">first</num> nucleus of the British Museum, and who resided at Chelsea; nor shall we forget the Chelsea china manufactory, <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest porcelain manufactories in England, patronized by George II., who brought over German artificers from Brunswick and Saxony. In the reign of Louis XV. the French manufacturers began to regard it with jealousy and petitioned their king for special privileges. Ranelagh, too, that old pleasure-garden which Dr. Johnson declared was <QUOTE>the finest thing he had ever seen,</QUOTE> deserves a word; Horace Walpole was constantly there, though at <num value="1">first</num>, he owns, he preferred Vauxhall; and Lord Chesterfield was so fond of it that he used to say he should order all his letters to be directed there.
<p>The West End squares are pleasant spots for our purpose, and at many doors we shall have to make a call. In Landsdowne House (in Berkeley Square) it is supposed by many that Lord Shelbume, Colonel Barre, and Dunning wrote <title>Junius</title>; certain it is that the Marquis of Landsdowne, in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, acknowledged the possession of the secret, but died the following week, before he could disclose it. Here, in <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>, that persecuted philosopher, Dr. Priestley, the librarian to Lord Shelburne, discovered oxygen. In this square Horace Walpole (that delightful letter-writer) died, and Lord Clive destroyed himself. Then there is Grosvenor Square, where that fat, easy-going Minister, Lord North, lived, where Wilkes the notorious resided, and where the Cato-Street conspirators planned to kill all the Cabinet Ministers, who had been invited to dinner by the Earl of Harrowby. In Hanover Square we visit Lord Rodney, &amp;c. In St. James's Square we recall William III. coming to the Earl of Romney's to see fireworks let off and, later, the Prince Regent, from a balcony, displaying to the people the Eagles captured at Waterloo. Queen Caroline resided here during her trial, and many of Charles II.'s frail beauties also resided in the same spot. In Cavendish Square we stop to describe the splendid projects of that great Duke of Chandos whom Pope ridiculed. Nor are the lesser squares by any means devoid of interest.
<p>In Pall Mall the laziest gleaner of London traditions might find a harvest. On the site of Carlton House--the Prince Regent's palace--were, in the reign of Henry VI., monastic buildings, in which (under Henry VIII.) Erasmus afterwards resided. They were pulled down at the Reformation. Nell Gwynn lived here, and so did Sir William Temple, Swift's early patron, the pious Boyle, and that poor puff-ball of vanity and pretence--Bubb Doddington. Here we have to record the unhappy duel at the <QUOTE>Star and Garter</QUOTE> tavern between Lord Byron and Mr. Chaworth, and the murder of Mr. Thynne by his rival, Count K&ouml;ningsmark. There is Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery to notice, and Dodsley's shop, which Burke, Johnson, and Garrick so often visited. There is also the origin of the Royal Academy, at a house opposite Market Lane, to chronicle, many club-houses to visit, and curious memorabilia of all kinds to be sifted, selected, contrasted, mounted, and placed in sequence for view.
<p>Then comes Marylebone, formerly a suburb, famous only for its hunting park (now Regent's Park), its gardens, and its bowling-greens. In Queen. Elizabeth's time the Russian ambassadors were sent to hunt in Marylebone Park; Cromwell sold it--deer, timber, and all for <measure value="13000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="13000">13,000</num></measure>. The Marylebone Bowling Greens, which preceded the gardens, were at <num value="1">first</num> the resort of noblemen and gentlemen, but eventually highwaymen began to frequent them. The Duke of Buckingham (whom Lady Mary Wortley Montagu glances at in the line,
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Some dukes at Marlybone bowl time away)</QUOTE>
 used, at an annual dinner to the frequenters of the gardens, to give the agreeable toast,-- <QUOTE>May as many of us as remain unhanged next spring meet here again.</QUOTE> Eventually burlettas were produced--<num value="1">one</num> written by Chatterton; and Dr. Arne conducted Handel's music. Marylebone, in the time of Hogarth, was a favourite place for prize fights and back-sword combats, the great champion being Figg, that bullet-headed man with the bald, plaistered head, whom Hogarth has represented mounting grim sentry in his <title>Southwark Fair.</title>
The great building at Marylebone began between <datestruct value="1718--"><year reg="1718">1718</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1729--"><year reg="1729">1729</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct> there were only <num value="577">577</num> houses in the parish; in <datestruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct> there were <num value="16669">16,669</num>. In many of the nooks and corners of Marylebone we shall find curious facts and stories worth the unravelling:
<p>The eastern squares, in Bloomsbury and St. Pancras, are regions not by any means to be lightly <pb id="p.15" n="15"> passed by. Bloomsbury Square was built by the Earl of Southampton, about the time of the Restoration, and was thought <num value="1">one</num> of the wonders of England. Baxter lived here when he was tormented by Judge Jefferies; Sir Hans Sloane was <num value="1">one</num> of its inhabitants; so was that great physician, Dr. Radcliffe, The burning of Mansfield House by Lord George Gordon's rioters has to be minutely described. In Russell Square we visit the houses of Sir Thomas Lawrence and of Judge Talfourd, and search for that celebrated spot in London legend, <title>The Field of the <num value="40">Forty</num> Footsteps,</title>? where <num value="2">two</num> brothers, it is said, killed each other in a duel for a lady, who sat by watching the fight. Then there is Red Lion Square, where tradition says some faithful adherents, at the Restoration, buried the body of Cromwell, to prevent its desecration at Tyburn; and we have to cull some stories of a good old inhabitant, Jonas Hanway, the great promoter of many of the London charities, the <num value="1">first</num> man who habitually used an umbrella and Dr. Johnson's spirited opponent on the important question of tea. Soho Square, too, has many a tradition, for the Duke of Monmouth lived there in great splendour; and in Hogarth's time Mrs. Cornelys made the square celebrated by her masquerades, which in time became disreputable.
<FIGURE id="Fig.015" n="2000.06.0008"><HEAD>Plan Of Roman London (See Page <num value="20">20</num>).</HEAD></FIGURE>
 Sir Cloudesley Shovel, Sir Joseph Banks, and Burnet, the historian, were all inhabitants of this locality.
<p>Islington brings us back to days when Henry VIII. came there to hawk the partridge and the heron, and when the London citizens wandered out across the northern fields to drink milk and eat cheesecakes. The old houses abound in legends of Sir Walter Raleigh, Topham, the strong man, George Morland, the artist, and Henderson, the actor. At Canonbury, the old tower of the country house of the Prior of St. Bartholomew recalls to us Goldsmith, who used to come there to hide from his creditors, go to bed early, and write steadily.
<p>At Highgate and Hampstead we shall scour the northern uplands of London by no means in vain, as we shall find Belsize House, in Charles II.'s time, openly besieged by robbers and, long afterwards, highwaymen swarming in the same locality. The chalybeate wells of Hampstead lead us on to the Heath, where wolves were to be found in the <num value="12">twelfth</num> century and highwaymen as late as <datestruct value="1803"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>. Good company awaits us at pleasant Hampstead--Lord Erskine, Lord Chatham, Keats, Akenside, Leigh Hunt, and Sir T. Fowell Buxton; Booth, Wilkes, and Colley Cibber; Mrs. Barbauld, honest Dick Steele, and Joanna Baillie. As for Highgate, <pb id="p.16" n="16"> for ages a mere hamlet, a forest, it once boasted a bishop's palace, and there we gather, with free hand, memories of Sacheverell, Rowe, Dr. Watts, Hogarth, Coleridge, and Lord Mansfield; Ireton, Marvell, and Dick Whittington, the worthy demi-god of London apprentices to the end of time.
<p>Lambeth, where Harold was crowned, can hold its own in interest with any part of London--for it once possessed <num value="2">two</num> ecclesiastical palaces and many places of amusement. Lambeth Palace itself is a spot of extreme interest. Here Wat Tyler's men dragged off Archbishop Sudbury to execution; here, when Laud was seized, the Parliamentary soldiers turned the palace into a prison for Royalists and demolished the great hall. Outside the walls of the church James II.'s Queen cowered in the December rain with her child, till a coach could be brought from the neighbouring inn to convey her to Gravesend to take ship for France. The Gordon rioters attacked the palace in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, but were driven off by a detachment of Guards. The Lollards' Tower has to be visited, and the sayings and doings of a long line of prelates to be reviewed. Vauxhall brings us back to the days when Walpole went there with Lady Caroline Petersham and helped to stew chickens in a china dish over a lamp; or we go further back and accompany Addison and the worthy Sir Roger de Coverley, and join them over a glass of good ale and a slice of hung beef.
<p>Astley's Amphitheatre recalls to us many amusing stories of that old soldier, Ducrow, and of his friends and rivals, which join on very naturally to those other theatrical traditions to which Drury Lane and Covent Garden have already led us.
<p>So we mean to roam from flower to flower, over as varied a garden as the imagination can well conceive. There have been brave workers before us in the field, and we shall build upon good foundations. We hope to be catholic in our selections; we shall prune away only the superfluous; we shall condense anecdotes only where we think we can make them pithier and racier. We will neglect no fact that is interesting, and blend together all that old Time can give us bearing upon London. Street by street we shall delve and rake for illustrative story, despising no book, however humble, no pamphlet, however obscure, if it only throws some light on the celebrities of London, its topographical history, its manners and customs. Such is a brief summary of our plan.
<p>St. Paul's rises before us with its great black dome and stately row of sable columns; the Tower, with its central citadel, flanked by the spear-like masts of the river shipping; the great world of roofs spreads below us as we launch upon our venturous voyage of discovery. From Boadicea leading on her scythed chariots at Battle Bridge to Queen Victoria in the Thanksgiving procession of yesterday is along period over which to range. We have whole generations of Londoners to defile before us-painted Britons, hooded Saxons, mailed Crusaders, Chaucer's men in hoods, friars, citizens, warriors, Shakespeare's friends, Johnson's companions, Goldsmith's jovial <title>Bohemians,</title> Hogarth's fellow-painters, soldiers, lawyers, statesmen, merchants. Nevertheless, at our spells they will gather from the <num value="4">four</num> winds, and at our command march off to their old billets in their old houses, where we may best cross-examine them and collect their impressions of the life of their times.
<p>The subject is as entertaining as any dream Imagination ever evoked and as varied as human nature. Its classification is a certain bond of union, and will act as an excellent cement for the multiform stones with which we shall rear our building. Lists of names, dry pedigrees, rows of dates, we leave to the herald and the topographer; but we shall pass by little that can throw light on the history of London in any generation, and we shall. dwell more especially on the events of the later centuries, because they are more akin to us and are bound to us by closer sympathies.

<p>
Eighteen feet below the level of Cheapside lies hidden Roman London, and deeper even than that is buried the earlier London of those savage charioteers who, long ages ago, bravely confronted the legions of Rome. In nearly all parts of the City there have been discovered tesselated pavements, Roman tombs, lamps, vases, sandals, keys, ornaments, weapons, coins, and statues of the ancient Roman gods. So the present has grown up upon the ashes of the past. <pb id="p.17" n="17">
<p>Trees that are to live long grow slowly. Slow and stately as an oak London grew and grew, till now nearly <num value="4">four</num> million souls represent its leaves. Our London is very old. Centuries before Christ there probably came the <num value="1">first</num> few half-naked fishermen and hunters, who reared, with flint axes and such rude tools, some miserable huts on the rising ground that, forming the north bank of the Thames, slopes to the river some <num value="60">sixty</num> miles from where it joins the sea. According to some, the river spread out like a vast lake between the Surrey and the Essex hills in those times when the <num value="1">first</num> half-savage settlers found the low slopes of the future London places of health and defence amid a vast and dismal region of fen, swamp, and forest. The heroism and the cruelties, the hopes and fears of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.17.2">those poor barbarians</lemma>, darkness never to be removed has hidden from us for ever. In later days monkish historians, whom Milton afterwards followed, ignored these poor early relations of ours, and invented, as a more fitting ancestor of Englishmen, Brute, a fugitive nephew of Aeneas of Troy. But, stroll on where we will, the pertinacious savage, with his limbs stained blue and his flint axe red with blood, is a ghost not easily to be exorcised from the banks of the Thames, and in some Welsh veins his blood no doubt flows at this very day. The founder of London had no historian to record his hopes: a place where big salmon were to be found, and plenty of wild boars were to be met with, was probably his highest ambition. How he bartered with Phoenicians or Gauls for amber or iron no Druid has recorded. How he slew the foraging Belgae, or was slain by them and dispossessed, no bard has sung. Whether he was generous and heroic as the New Zealander, or apelike and thievish as the Bushman, no ethnologist has yet proved. The very ashes of the founder of London have long since turned to earth, air, and water.
<NOTE resp=B>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.17.1">Roman Road</lemma></NOTE>

<P>No doubt the few huts that formed early London were fought for over and over again, as wolves wrangle round a carcass. On Cornhill there probably dwelt petty kings who warred with the kings of Ludgate; and in Southwark there lurked or burrowed other chiefs who, perhaps by intrigue or force, struggled for centuries to get a foothold on Thames Street. But to such infusoria History (glorying only in offenders, criminals, and robbers on the largest scale) justly pays no heed. This alone we know, that the early rulers of London before the Christian era passed away like the wild beasts they fought and slew, and their very names have perished. <num value="1">One</num> line of an old blind Greek poet might have immortalised them among the motley nations that crowded into Troy or swarmed under its walls; but, alas for them, that line was never written! No, Founder of London! they name was written on fluid ooze of the marsh, and the <num value="1">first</num> tide that washed over it from the Nore obliterated it for ever. Yet, perhaps even now thou sleepest as quietly fathoms deep in soft mud, in some still nook of Barking Creek, as if all the world were ringing with they glory.
<P>But descending quick to the lower but safer and firmer ground of fact, let us cautiously drive our <num value="1">first</num> pile into the shaky morass of early London history.
<P>A learned modern antiquary, Thomas Lewin, has proved, that
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.17.3">Julius Caesar</lemma> and <num value="8000">8,000</num> men, who had sailed from Boulogne,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.17.4">landed near Romney Marsh</lemma> about half-past <num value="5">five</num> o'clock on Sunday the <datestruct value="08-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, <num value="55">55</num> years before the birth of our Saviour. Centuries before that very remarkable August day on which the brave standard-bearer of Caesar's Tenth Legion sprang from his
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.17.5">gilt galley</lemma> into the sea, and eagle in hand, advanced against javelins of the painted Britons who lined the shore, there is now no doubt London was already existing as a British town of some import- Dance, and known to the fishermen and merchants of the Gauls and Belgians. Strabo, a Greek geographer who flourished in the reign of Augustus, speaks of British merchants as bringing to the Seine and Rhine shiploads of corn, cattle, iron, hides, slaves, and dogs, and taking back brass ivory, amber ornaments, and vessels of glass. By these merchants the desirability of such a dep&ocirc;t as London, with its great and always navigable river, could not have been long overlooked.
<P>In Caesar's <num value="2">second</num> and longer invasion in the next year (<datestruct value="-54"><year reg="-54">54</year></datestruct> B.C.), when his <num value="28">28</num> many-oared triremes and <num value="560">560</num> transports, &amp;c., in all <num value="800">800</num>, poured on the same Kentish coast <num value="21000">21,000</num> legionaries and <num value="2000">2,000</num> cavalry, there is little doubt that his strong foot left its imprint near that cluster of stockaded huts (more resembling a New Zealand pah than a modern English town) perhaps already called London--Llyn-don, the <QUOTE>town on the lake.</QUOTE> after a battle at Challock Wood, Caesar and his men crossed the Thames, as is supposed, at
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.17.6">Coway Stakes</lemma>, an ancient ford a little above Walton and below Weybridge. Cassivellaunus, King of Hertfordshire and Middlesex, had just slain in war Immanuent, King of Essex, and had driven out his son Mandubert. The Trinobantes, Mandubert's subjects, joined the Roman spearmen against the <num value="4000">4,000</num> scythed chariots of Cassivellaunus and the Catyeuchlani. Straight as the flight of an <pb id="p.18" n="18"> arrow was Caesar's march upon the capital of Cassivellaunus, a city the barbaric name of which he either forgot or disregarded, but which he merely says was <QUOTE>protected by woods and marshes.</QUOTE> This place north of the Thames has usually been thought to be Verulamium (St. Alban's); but it was far more likely London, as the Cassii, whose capital was Verulamium, were among the traitorous tribes who joined Caesar against their oppressor Cassivellaunus. Moreover, Caesar's brief description of the spot perfectly applies to Roman London, for ages protected on the north by a vast forest, full of deer and wild boars, and which, even as late as the reign of Henry II., covered a great region, but has now shrunk into the not very wild districts of St. John's Wood and Caen Wood. On the north the town found a natural moat in the broad fens of Moorfields, Finsbury, and Houndsditch, while on the south ran the Fleet and the Old Bourne. Indeed, according to that credulous enthusiast, Stukeley, Caesar, marching from Staines to London, encamped on the site of Old St. Pancras Church, round which edifice Stukeley found evident traces of a great Praetorian camp. However, whether Cassivellaunus, the King of Middlesex and Hertfordshire, had his capital at London or St. Alban's, this much at
<FIGURE id="Fig.018" n="2000.06.0009"><HEAD>Ancient Roman Pavement Found In Threadneedle Street, <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct> (see page <num value="21">21</num>).
</HEAD></FIGURE>
 least is certain, that the legionaries carried their eagles swiftly over his stockades of earth and fallen trees, drove away the blue-stained warriors, and swept off the half-wild cattle stored up by the Britons. Shortly after, Caesar returned to Gaul, having heard while in Britain of the death of his favourite daughter Julia, the wife of Pompey, his great rival. His camp at Richborough or Rutupiae was far distant; the dreaded equinoctial gales were at hand; and Gaul, he knew, might at any moment of his absence start into a flame. His inglorious campaign had lasted just <num value="4">four</num> months and a half-his <num value="1">first</num> had been far shorter. As Caesar himself wrote to Cicero, our rude island was defended by stupendous rocks, there was not a scrap of the gold that had been reported, and the only prospect of booty was in slaves, from whom there could be expected neither <QUOTE>skill in letters nor in music.</QUOTE> In sober truth, all Caesar had won from the people of Kent and Hertfordshire had been blows and buffets, for there were <hi>men</hi> in Britain even then. The prowess of the British charioteers became a standing joke in Rome against the soldiers of Caesar. Horace and Tibullus both speak of the Briton as unconquered. The bow which the strong Roman hand had for a moment bent quickly <pb id="p.19" n="19"> relapsed to its old shape the moment Caesar, mounting his tall galley, turned his eyes towards Gaul.
<p>The Mandubert who sought Caesar's help is by some thought to be the son of the semi-fabulous King Lud (King <hi>Brown</hi>), the mythical founder of London, and, according to Milton, who, as we have said, follows the old historians, a descendant of Brute of Troy. The successor of the warlike Cassivellaunus had his capital at St. Alban's; his son Cunobelin (Shakespeare's Cymbeline)--a name which seems to glow with perpetual sunshine as we write it-had a palace at Colchester; and the son of Cunobelin. was the famed Caradoc, or Caractacus, that hero of the Silures, who struggled bravely for <num value="9">nine</num> long years against the generals of Rome.
<p>Celtic etymologists differ, as etymologists usually do, about the derivation of the name of London. Lon, or Long, meant, they say, either a lake, a wood, a populous place, a plain, or a ship-town. This last
<FIGURE id="Fig.019" n="2000.06.0010"><HEAD>

<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.19.1">Part Of Old London Wall, Near Falcon Square (see page <num value="21">21</num>).</LEMMA></HEAD></FIGURE>
 conjecture is, however, now the most generally received, as it at once gives the modem pronunciation; to which Llyn-don would never have assimilated. The <num value="1">first</num> British town was indeed a simple Celtic hill fortress, formed <num value="1">first</num> on Tower Hill, and afterwards continued to Cornhill and Ludgate. It was moated on the south by the river, which it controlled; by fens on the north; and on the east by the marshy low ground of Wapping. It was a high, dry, and fortified point of communication between the river and the inland country of Essex and Hertfordshire, a safe <num value="60">sixty</num> miles from the sea, and central as a dep&ocirc;t and meeting-place for the tribes of Kent and Middlesex.
<p>Hitherto the London about which we have been conjecturing has been a mere cloud city. The <num value="1">first</num> mention of real London is by Tacitus, who, writing in the reign of Nero (A.D. <datestruct value="62"><year reg="62">62</year></datestruct>, more than a century after the landing of Caesar), in that style of his so full of vigour and so sharp in outline, <pb id="p.20" n="20"> that it seems fit rather to be engraved on steel than written on perishable paper, says that Londinium, though not, indeed, dignified with the name of colony, was a place highly celebrated for the number of its merchants and the confluence of traffic. In the year <datestruct value="62"><year reg="62">62</year></datestruct> London was probably still without walls, and its inhabitants were not Roman citizens, like those of Verulamium (St. Alban's). When the Britons, roused by the wrongs of the fierce
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.20.2">Boadicea (Queen of the Iceni</lemma>, the people of Norfolk and Suffolk), bore down on London, her back still <QUOTE>bleeding from the Roman rods,</QUOTE> she slew in London and Verulamium alone <num value="70000">70,000</num> citizens and allies of Rome; impaling many beautiful and well-born women, amid revelling sacrifices, in the grove of Andate, the British Goddess of Victory. It is supposed that after this reckless slaughter the tigress and her savage followers
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.20.3">burned the cluster of wooden houses that then formed London</lemma> to the ground. Certain it is, that when deep sections were made for a sewer in Lombard Street in <datestruct value="1786--"><year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct>, the lowest stratum consisted of tesselated Roman pavements, their coloured dice laying scattered like flower leaves, and above that of a thick layer of wood ashes, as of the <hi>debris</hi> of charred wooden buildings. This ruin the Romans avenged by the slaughter of <num value="80000">80,000</num> Britons in a butchering fight, generally believed to have taken place at King's Cross (otherwise Battle Bridge), after which the fugitive Boadicea, in rage and despair, took poison and perished.
<p>London probably soon sprang, phoenix-like, from the fire, though history leaves it in darkness to enjoy a lull of <num value="200">200</num> years. In the early part of the <num value="2">second</num> century Ptolemy, the geographer, speaks of it as a city of the Kentish people; but Mr. Craik very ingeniously conjectures that the Greek writer took his information from Phoenician works descriptive of Britain, written before even the invasion of Caesar. Theodosius, a general of the Emperor Valentinian, who saved London from gathered hordes of Scots, Picts, Franks, and Saxons, is supposed to have repaired the walls of London, which had been <num value="1">first</num> built by the Emperor Constantine early in the <num value="4">fourth</num> century. In the reign of Theodosius, London, now called Augusta, became <num value="1">one</num> of the chief, if not the chief, of the <num value="70">seventy</num> Roman cities in Britain. In the famous <title>Itinerary </title>
of Antoninus (about the end of the <num value="3">third</num> century) London stands as the goal or starting-point of <num value="7">seven</num> out of the <num value="15">fifteen</num> great central Roman roads in England. Camden considers the
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.20.4">London Stone</lemma>,

now enshrined in the south wall to.
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.20.5">St. Swithin's Church, Cannon Street</lemma>, to have been the central milestone of Roman England, from which all the chief roads radiated, and by which the distances were reckoned. Wren supposed that Watling Street, of which Cannon Street is a part, was the High Street of Roman London. Another street ran west along Holborn from Cheapside, and from Cheapside probably north. A northern road ran by Aldgate, and probably Bishopsgate. The road from Dover came either over a ferry near the site, of the present London Bridge or higher up at Dowgate, from Stoney Street on the Surrey side.
<p>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.20.6">Early Roman London</lemma> was scarcely larger than Hyde Park. Mr. Roach Smith, the best of all authorities on the subject, gives its length from the Tower to Ludgate, east and west, at about a mile; and north and south, that is from London Wall to the Thames, at about half a mile. The earliest Roman city was even smaller, for Roman sepulchres have been found in Bow Lane, Moorgate Street, Bishopsgate Within, which must at that time have been beyond the walls. The Roman cemeteries of Smithfield, St. Paul's, Whitechapel, the Minories, and Spitalfields, are of later dates, and are in all cases beyond the old line of circumvallation, according to the sound Roman custom fixed by law.
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.20.8">The earlier London</LEMMA> Mr. Roach Smith describes as an irregular space, the <num value="5">five</num> main gates corresponding with Bridgegate, Ludgate, Bishopsgate, Aldersgate, and Aldgate. The north wall followed for some part the course of Cornhill and Leadenhall Street; the eastern Billiter Street and Mark Lane; the southern Thames Street; and the western the east side of Walbrook .
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.20.9">Of the larger Roman wall</LEMMA>, there were within the memory of man huge, shapeless masses, with trees growing upon them, opposite what is now Finsbury Circus. In <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct> a piece of Roman wall on Tower Hill was rescued from the improvers, and built into some stables and outhouses; but not before a careful sketch had been effected by the late Mr. Fairholt, <num value="1">one</num> of the best of our antiquarian draughtsmen. The later Roman London was in general outline the same in shape and size as the London of the Saxons and Normans. The
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.20.7">newer walls</lemma> Pennant calculates at <num value="3">3</num> miles <num value="165">165</num> feet in circumference, they were <num value="22">22</num> feet high, and guarded with <num value="40">forty</num> lofty towers. At the end of the last century large portions of the old Roman wall were traceable in many places, but time has devoured almost the last morsels of that great <foreign lang=fr>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</foreign>. In <datestruct value="1763--"><year reg="1763">1763</year></datestruct> Mr. Gough made a drawing of a square Roman tower (<num value="1">one</num> of <num value="3">three</num>) then standing in Houndsditch. It was built in alternate layers of massive square stones and red tiles. The old loophole for the sentinel had been enlarged into a square latticed window. In <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>, while digging foundations for houses on the northeast side of Aldermanbury Postern, the workmen <pb id="p.21" n="21"> came on a portion of the Roman wall strengthened by blind arches.

<p>The line of the Roman walls ran from the Tower straight to Aldgate; there making an angle, it continued to Bishopsgate. From there it turned westward to St. Giles's Churchyard, where it veered south to Falcon Square. At this point it continued west to Aldersgate, running under Christ's Hospital, and onward to Giltspur Street. There forming an angle, it proceeded directly to Ludgate towards the Thames, passing to the south of St. Andrew's Church. The wall then crossed Addle Street, and took a course along Upper and Lower Thames Street towards the Tower. In Thames Street the wall has been found built on oaken piles; on these was laid a stratum of chalk and stones, and over this a course of large, hewn sandstones, cemented with quicklime, sand, and pounded tile. The body of the wall was constructed of ragstone, flint, and lime, bonded at intervals with courses of plain and curve-edged tiles.
<p>That Roman London grew slowly there is abundant proof. In building the new Exchange, the workmen came on a gravel-pit full of oystershells, cattle bones,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.21.3">old sandals</lemma>, and shattered pottery. No coin found there being later than Severus indicates that this ground was bare waste outside the original city until at least the latter part of the <num value="3">third</num> century. How far Roman London eventually spread its advancing waves of houses may be seen from the fact that Roman wall-paintings, indicating villas of men of wealth and position, have been found on both sides of High Street, Southwark, almost up to St. George's Church; while <num value="1">one</num> of the outlying Roman cemeteries bordered the Kent Road.
<p>From the horns of cattle having been dug up in St. Paul's Churchyard, the monks, ever eager to discover traces of that Paganism on which they engrafted Christianity, conjectured that a temple of Diana once stood on the site of St. Paul's.
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.21.4">A stone altar, with a rude figure of the amazon goddess sculptured upon it</lemma> was indeed discovered in making the foundations for Goldsmiths Hall, Cheapside; but this was a mere votive or private altar, and proves nothing; and the ox bones, it any, found at St. Paul's, were perhaps refuse thrown into a rubbish-heap outside the old walls. As to the Temple of Apollo, supposed to have been replaced by Westminster Abbey, that is merely an invention of rival monks to glorify Thorney Island, and to render its antiquity equal to the fabulous claims of St. Paul's. Nor is there any positive proof that shrines to British gods ever stood on either place, though that they may have done so is not at all improbable.
<P>The existing relics of Roman London are far more valuable and more numerous than is generally supposed. Innumerable tesselated pavements, masterpieces of artistic industry and taste, have been found in the City. A few of these should be noted. In <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct> part of the pavement of a room, <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> feet square, was discovered, when the Excise Office was pulled down, between Bishopsgate Street and Broad Street. The central subject was supposed to be the Rape of Europa. A few years before another pavement was met with near the same spot. In <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct> <num value="2">two</num> pavements were dug up under the French Protestant Church in Threadneedle Street.
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.21.13">The best of these we have engraved.</LEMMA> In <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct> a circular pavement was found in the same locality; and there has also been dug up in the same street a curious female head, the size of life, formed of coloured stones and glass. In <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct> a beautiful Roman pavement was disinterred on the north-east angle of the Bank of England, near the gate opening into Lothbury, and is now in the British Museum. In <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct> a fine specimen of pavement was found in front of the East-India House, Leadenhall Street, the central design being Bacchus reclining on a panther. In this pavement <num value="20">twenty</num> distinct tints had been successfully used. Other pavements have been cut through in Crosby Square, Bartholomew Lane, Fenchurch Street, and College Street. The soil, according to Mr. Roach Smith, seems to have risen over them at the rate of nearly a foot in a century.

In <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct> a <foreign lang=fr>chef d&lsquo;oeuvre</foreign> was dug out near the old Roman wall in Queen Street, Cheapside.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.22.1">Roman Silver Ingot</lemma></NOTE>

<p>In <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct> a graceful little silver figure of the child Harpocrates, the God of Silence, looped with a gold chain, was found in the Thames, and is now in the British Museum. In <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct> a pair of gold armlets were dug up in Queen Street, Cheapside. In a kiln in St. Paul's Churchyard, in <datestruct value="1677--"><year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>, there were found lamps, bottles, urns, and

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.22.3">coins</lemma>, which the Romans seem to have hid in every conceivable nook, Mr. Roach Smith says that within <num value="20">twenty</num> years upwards of <num value="2000">2,000</num> were, to his own knowledge, found in London, chiefly in the bed of the Thames. Only <num value="1">one</num> Greek coin, as far as we know, has ever been met with in London excavations.
<p>The Romans left deep footprints wherever they trod. Many of our London streets still follow the lines they <num value="1">first</num> laid down. The river bank still heaves beneath the ruins of their palaces. London Stone, as we have already shown, still stands to mark the starting-point of the great roads that they designed. In a lane out of the Strand there still exists a bath where their sinewy youth laved their limbs, dusty from the chariot races at the Campus Martius at Finsbury. The pavements trodden by the feet of Hadrian and Constantine still lie buried under the restless wheels that roll over our City streets. The ramparts which the legionaries guarded have not yet crumbled to dust, though the rude people they conquered have themselves long since grown into conquerors. Roman London now exists only in fragments, invisible save to the prying antiquary. As the seed is to be found hanging to the root of the ripe wheat, so some filaments of the <num value="1">first</num> germ of London, of the British hut and the Roman villa, still exist hidden under the foundations of the busy city that now teems with thousands of inhabitants. . We tread under foot daily the pride of our old oppressors.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.22.4">Temple Bar</lemma> was rebuilt by
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.22.5">Sir Christopher Wren</lemma>, in <datestruct value="1667--"><year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>-<num value="72">72</num>, soon after the Great Fire had swept away <num value="89">eighty-nine</num> London churches, <num value="4">four</num> out of the <num value="7">seven</num> City gates, <num value="460">460</num> streets, and <num value="13200">13,200</num> houses, and had destroyed <num value="15">fifteen</num> of the <num value="26">twenty-six</num> wards, and laid waste <num value="436">436</num> acres of buildings, from the Tower eastward to the Inner Temple westward.
<p>The old black gateway, once the dreaded Golgotha of English traitors, separated, it should be remembered, the Strand from Fleet Street, the city from the shire, and the Freedom of the City of London from the Liberty of the City of Westminster, As Hatton (<datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>-Queen Anne) says,-- <QUOTE>This gate opens not immediately into the City itself, but into the Liberty or Freedom thereof.</QUOTE> We need hardly say that nothing can be more erroneous than the ordinary London supposition that Temple Bar ever formed part of the City fortifications. Mr. Gilbert &agrave; Beckett, laughing at this tradition, once said in
<title>Punch</title>: <QUOTE>Temple Bar has always seemed to me a weak point in the fortifications of London. Bless you, the besieging army would never stay to bombard it--they would dash through the barber's.</QUOTE>
<p>The Bar, after having been for many years a great obstruction to the traffic, was removed in the winter of <datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>-<num value="8">8</num>, whilst the New Law Courts were in process of erection. The Bar was of Portland stone, which London smoke alternately blackens and calcines; and each facade had <num value="4">four</num> Corinthian pilasters, an entablature, and an arched pediment. On the west (Strand) side, in <num value="2">two</num> niches, stood, as eternal sentries, Charles I. and Charles II., in Roman costume. Charles I. long ago lost his baton, as he once deliberately lost his head. Over the keystone of the central arch there used to be the royal arms. On the east side were James I. and Elizabeth (by many able writers supposed to be Anne of Denmark, the queen of James I.). She was pointing her white finger at Child's; while he, looking down on the passing cabs, seemed to say, <QUOTE>I am nearly tired of standing; suppose we go to Whitehall, and sit down a bit?</QUOTE>
<p>These affected, mean statues, with their crinkly drapery, were the work of a vain, half-crazed sculptor, named John Bushnell, who died mad in <datestruct value="1701--"><year reg="1701">1701</year></datestruct>. Bushnell, who had visited Rome and <pb id="p.23" n="23"> Venice,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.23.1">executed Cowley's monument in Westminster Abbey</lemma>, and the statues of Charles I., Charles II., and Gresham, in the old Exchange.
<p>The slab over the eastern side of the arch bore the following inscription, which was all but obliterated by time:--
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Erected in the year <datestruct value="1670"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>, Sir Samuel Starling, Mayor; continued in the year <datestruct value="1671"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>, Sir Richard Ford, Lord Mayor; and finished in the year <datestruct value="1672"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>, Sir George Waterman, Lord Mayor.</QUOTE>

<p>All these persons were friends of Pepys.
<p>The upper part of the Bar was flanked by scrolls, but the fruit and flowers once sculptured on the pediment, and the supporters of the royal arms over the posterns, had crumbled away. In the centre of each facade was a semi-circular-headed, ecclesiastical-looking window, that cast a dim horny light into
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.23.2">a room above the gate</LEMMA>, held of the City, at an annual rent of some <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="50">50</num></measure>, by Messrs. Childs, the bankers, as a sort of muniment-room for their old account-books. There was here preserved, among other costlier treasures of Mammon, the private account-book of Charles II. The original Child was a friend of Pepys, and is mentioned by him as quarrelling with the Duke of York on Admiralty matters. The Child who succeeded him was a friend of Pope, and all but led him into the South-Sea-Bubble speculation.
<p>There is no extant historical account of Temple Bar in which the following passage from Strype  (George I.) is not to be found embedded like a fossil; it is, in fact, nearly all we London topographers know of the early history of the Bar:-- <QUOTE>Anciently,</QUOTE> says Strype, <QUOTE>there were only posts, rails, and a chain, such as are now in Holborn, Smithfield, and Whitechapel bars. Afterwards there was a
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.23.3">house of timber</LEMMA> erected across the street, with a narrow gateway and an entry on the south side of it under the house.</QUOTE>
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.23.4">This structure</LEMMA> is to be seen in the view of London in the British Museum, <datestruct value="1620--"><year reg="1620">1620</year></datestruct> (James I.), and in Hollar's sevensheet map of London (Charles II.).
<p>The date of the erection of the <QUOTE>wooden house</QUOTE> is not to be ascertained; but there is the house plain enough in a view of London to which Maitland affixes the date about <datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct> (the <num value="2">second</num> year of Elizabeth); so we may perhaps safely put it down as early as Edward VI. or Henry VIII. Indeed, if a certain scrap of history is correct-i.e., that bluff King Hal once threatened, if a certain Bill did not pass the Commons a little quicker, to fix the heads of several refractory M.P.s on the top of Temple Bar-we must suppose the old City toll-gate to be as old as the early Tudors.
<p>After Simon de Montfort's death, at the battle of Evesham, <datestruct value="1265--"><year reg="1265">1265</year></datestruct>, Prince Edward, afterwards Edward I., punished the rebellious Londoners, who had befriended Montfort, by taking away all their street chains and bars, and locking them up in the Tower.
<p>The earliest known documentary and historical notice of Temple Bar is in <datestruct value="1327--"><year reg="1327">1327</year></datestruct>, the <num value="1">first</num> year of Edward III. ; and in the <num value="34">thirty-fourth</num> year of the same reign we find, at an inquisition before the mayor, <num value="12">twelve</num> witnesses deposing that the commonalty of the City had, time out of mind, had free ingress and egress from the City to Thames and from Thames to the City, through the great gate of the Templars situate within Temple Bar. his referred to some dispute about the right of. way through the Temple, built in the reign of Henry I. In <datestruct value="1384--"><year reg="1384">1384</year></datestruct> Richard II. granted a licence for paving Strand Street from Temple Bar to the Savoy, and collecting tolls to cover such charges.
<p>The historical pageants that have taken place at Temple Bar deserve a notice, however short. On the <datestruct VALUE="1422-11-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1422">1422</year></datestruct>, the corpse of that brave and chivalrous king, the hero of Agincourt, Henry V., was borne to its rest at Westminster Abbey by the chief citizens and nobles, and every doorway from Southwark to Temple Bar had its mournful torch-bearer. In <datestruct value="1502--"><year reg="1502">1502</year></datestruct>-<num value="3">3</num> the hearse of Elizabeth of York, queen of Henry VII., halted at Temple Bar, on its way from the Tower to Westminster, and at the Bar the Abbots of Westminster and Bermondsey blessed the corpse, and the Earl of Derby and a large company of nobles joined the sable funeral throng. After sorrow came joy, and after joy sorrow--<foreign lang=la>Ita vita</foreign>. In the next reign poor Anne Boleyn, radiant with happiness and triumph, came through the Bar (<datestruct VALUE="1534-05-31"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=31>31</day>, <year reg=1534>1534</year></datestruct>), on her way to the Tower, to be welcomed by the clamorous citizens, the day before her ill-starred coronation. Temple Bar on that occasion was new painted and repaired, and near it stood singing men and children--the Fleet Street conduit all the time running claret. The old gate figured more conspicuously the day before the coronation of that wondrous child, Edward VI. <num value="2">Two</num> hogsheads of wine were then ladled out to the thirsty mob, and the gate at Temple Bar was painted with battlements and buttresses, richly hung with cloth of Arras, and all in a flutter with <QUOTE><num value="14">fourteen</num> standard flags.</QUOTE> There were <num value="8">eight</num> French trumpeters blowing their best, besides <QUOTE>a pair of regals,</QUOTE> with children singing to the same. In <datestruct VALUE="1553-09--"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>, when Edward's cold-hearted half-sister; Mary Tudor, came through the City, according to ancient English custom, the day <pb id="p.24" n="24">

<p>Old Temple Bar, the background to many historical scenes, figures in the rash rebellion of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.25.1">Sir Thomas Wyatt</lemma>. When he had fought his way down Piccadilly to the Strand, Temple Bar was thrown open to him, or forced open by him; but when he had been repulsed at Ludgate he was hemmed in by cavalry at Temple Bar, where he surrendered. This foolish revolt led to the death of innocent Lady Jane Grey, and brought <num value="60">sixty</num> brave gentlemen to the scaffold and the gallows.

The City waits stood in triumph on the roof of the gate. The Lord Mayor and Aldermen, in scarlet gowns, welcomed the queen and delivered up the City sword, then on her return they took horse and rode before her. The City Companies lined the north side of the street, the lawyers and gentlemen of the Inns of Court the south. Among the latter stood a person afterwards not altogether unknown, <num value="1">one</num> Francis Bacon, who displayed his wit by saying to a friend, <QUOTE>Mark the courtiers! Those who bow <num value="1">first</num> to the citizens are in debt; those who bow <num value="1">first</num> to us are at law!</QUOTE>
<p>In <datestruct value="1601--"><year reg="1601">1601</year></datestruct>, when the Earl of Essex made his insane attempt to rouse the City to rebellion, Temple Bar, we are told, was thrown open to him; but Ludgate being closed against him on his retreat from Cheapside, he came back by boat to Essex House, where he surrendered after a short and useless resistance.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.25.4">King James</lemma><NOTE resp=B>

<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.26.3">Autograph of James I</LEMMA></NOTE> made his <num value="1">first</num> public entry into his royal City of London, with his consort and son Henry, upon the <datestruct VALUE="1603-03-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1603">1603</year></datestruct>-<num value="4">4</num>. The king was mounted upon a white genet, ambling through the crowded streets under a canopy held by <num value="8">eight</num> gentlemen of the Privy Chamber, as representatives of the Barons of the Cinque Ports, <pb id="p.26" n="26"> and passed under <num value="6">six</num> arches of triumph, to take his leave at the Temple of Janus, erected for the occasion at Temple Bar. This edifice was fiftyseven feet high, proportioned in every respect like a temple.
<p>In <datestruct VALUE="1649-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct> (the year of the execution of Charles), Cromwell and the Parliament dined at Guildhall in state, and the mayor, says Whitelocke, delivered up the sword to the Speaker, at Temple Bar, as he had before done to King Charles.
<p>Philips, Milton's nephew, who wrote the continuation of Baker's Chronicle, describes the
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.26.1">ceremony at Temple Bar</lemma> on the proclamation of Charles II. The old oak gates being shut, the king-at-arms, with tabard on and trumpet before him, knocked and gravely demanded entrance. The Lord Mayor appointed some <num value="1">one</num> to ask who knocked. The king-at-arms replied, that if they would open the wicket, and let the Lord Mayor come thither, he would to him deliver his message. The Lord Mayor then appeared, tremendous in crimson velvet gown, and on horseback, of all things in the world, the trumpets sounding as the gallant knight pricked forth to demand of the herald, who he was and what was his message. The bold herald, with his hat on, answered, regardless of Lindley Murray, who was yet unknown, <QUOTE>We are the herald-at-arms appointed and commanded by the Lords and Commons assembled in Parliament, and demand an entrance into the famous City of London, to proclaim Charles II. King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, and we expect your speedy answer to our demand.</QUOTE> An alderman then replied, <QUOTE>The message is accepted,</QUOTE> and the gates were thrown open.
<p>When William III. came to see the City and the Lord Mayor's Show in <datestruct value="1689--"><year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct>, the City militia, holding lighted flambeaux, lined Fleet Street as far as Temple Bar.
<p>The shadow of every monarch and popular hero since Charles II.'s time has rested for at least a passing moment at the old gateway. Queen Anne passed here to return thanks at St. Paul's for the victory of Blenheim. Here Marlborough's coach ominously broke down in <datestruct value="1714--"><year reg="1714">1714</year></datestruct>, when he returned in triumph from his voluntary exile.
<p>George III. passed through Temple Bar, young and happy, the year after his coronation, and again when, old and almost broken-hearted, he returned thanks for his partial recovery from insanity; and in our time that graceless son of his, the Prince Regent, came through the Bar in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, to thank God at St. Paul's for the downfall of Bonaparte.

<p>At the funeral of Lord Nelson, the honoured corpse, followed by downcast old sailors, was met at the Bar by the Lord Mayor and the Corporation; and the Great Duke's funeral car, and the long train of representative soldiers, rested at the Bar, which was hung with black velvet.
<p>A few earlier associations connected with the present Bar deserve a moment or <num value="2">two</num>'s recollection. On <datestruct value="02-12"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=12>12th</day></datestruct>, when General Monk- <QUOTE>Honest George,</QUOTE> as his old Cromwellian soldiers used to call him--entered London, dislodged the <QUOTE>Rump</QUOTE> Parliament, and prepared for the Restoration of Charles II., bonfires were lit, the City bells rung, and London broke into a sudden flame of joy.

<P>On <datestruct VALUE="1679-11-17"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=17>17</day>, <year reg=1679>1679</year></datestruct>, the year after the sham Popish Plot concocted by those matchless scoundrels,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.26.2">Titus Oates</lemma>, an expelled naval chaplain, and Bedloe, a swindler and thief, Temple Bar was made the spot for a great mob pilgrimage, on the anniversary of the accession of Queen, Elizabeth, The ceremonial is supposed to have been organised by that restless plotter against a Popish succession, Lord Shaftesbury, and the gentlemen of the Green Ribbon Club, whose tavern, the <QUOTE>King's Head,</QUOTE> was at the corner of Chancery Lane, opposite the Inner Temple gate. To scare and vex the Papists, the church bells began to ring out as early as <num value="3">three</num> o'clock on the morning of that dangerous day. At dusk the procession of several <num value="1000">thousand</num> half-crazed torch-bearers started from Moorgate, along Bishopsgate Street, and down Houndsditch and Aldgate (passing Shaftesbury's house imagine the roar of the monster mob, the wave of torches, and the fiery fountains of squibs at that point!), then through Leadenhall Street and Cornhill, by the Royal Exchange, along Cheapside and on to Temple Bar, where the bonfire awaited the puppets. In a torrent of fire the noisy Protestants passed through the exulting City, making the Papists cower and shudder in their garrets and cellars, and before the flaming deluge opened a storm of shouting people. <pb id="p.27" n="27">
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.27.1">This procession</lemma> consisted of <num value="15">fifteen</num> groups of priests, Jesuits, and friars, <num value="2">two</num> following a man on a horse, holding up before him a dummy, dressed to represent Sir Edmondbury Godfrey, a Protestant justice and wood merchant, supposed to have been murdered by Roman Catholics at Somerset House. It was attended by a body-guard of <num value="150">150</num> swordbearers and a man roaring a political cry of the time through a brazen speaking-trumpet. The great bonfire was built up mountain high opposite the Inner Temple gate. Some zealous Protestants, by pre-arrangement, had crowned the prim and meagre statue of Elizabeth, upon the east side of the Bar, with a wreath of gilt laurel, and placed under her hand, which pointed to Child's Bank, a golden glistening shield, with the motto, <QUOTE>The Protestant Religion and Magna Charta,</QUOTE> inscribed upon it. Several lighted torches were stuck before her niche. Lastly, amidst a fiery shower of squibs from every door and window,
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.27.3">the Pope and his companions were toppled into the huge bonfire</LEMMA>, with shouts that reached almost to Charing Cross.
<p>These mischievous processions were continued till the reign of George I. There was to have been a magnificent display in <datestruct VALUE="1711-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1711">1711</year></datestruct>, when the Whigs were dreading the contemplated peace with the French and the return of Marlborough. But the Tories, declaring that the Kit-Cat Club was urging the mob to destroy the house of Harley, the Minister, and to tear him to pieces, seized on the wax figures in Drury Lane, and forbade the ceremony.
<p>As early as <num value="2">two</num> years after the Restoration, Sir Balthazar Gerbier, a restless architectural quack and adventurer of those days, wrote a pamphlet proposing a sumptuous gate at Temple Bar, and the levelling of the Fleet Valley. After the Great Fire Charles II. himself hurried the erection of the Bar, and promised money to carry out the work. During the Great Fire, Temple Bar was <num value="1">one</num> of the stations for constables, <num value="100">100</num> firemen, and <num value="30">30</num> soldiers.
<p>The Rye-House Plot brought the <num value="1">first</num> trophy to the Golgotha of the Bar, in <datestruct value="1684--"><year reg="1684">1684</year></datestruct>, <num value="12">twelve</num> years after its erection. Sir Thomas Armstrong was deep in the scheme. If the discreditable witnesses examined against Lord William Russell are to be believed, a plot had been concocted by a few desperate men to assassinate <QUOTE>the Blackbird and the Goldfinch</QUOTE> --as the conspirators called the King and the Duke of York--as they were in their coach on their way from Newmarket to London. This plan seems to have been the suggestion of Rumbold, a maltster, who lived in a lonely moated farmhouse, called
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.27.2">Rye House</lemma>, about eighteen miles from London, near the river Ware, close to a by-road that leads from Bishop Stortford to Hoddesdon. Charles II. had a violent hatred to Armstrong, who had been his Gentleman of the Horse, and was supposed to have incited his illegitimate son, the Duke of Monmouth, to rebellion. Sir Thomas was hanged at Tyburn. After the body had hung half an hour, the hangman cut it down, stripped it, lopped off the head, threw the heart into a fire, and divided the body into <num value="4">four</num> parts. The fore-quarter (after being boiled in pitch at Newgate) was set on Temple Bar, the head was placed on Westminster all, and the rest of the body was sent to Stafford, which town Sir Thomas represented in Parliament.
<P><num value="11">Eleven</num> years after, the heads of <num value="2">two</num> more traitors --this time conspirators against William III.- joined the relic of Armstrong. Sir John Friend was a rich brewer at Aldgate. Parkyns was an old Warwickshire county gentleman. The plotters had several plans. <num value="1">One</num> was to attack Kensington Palace at night, scale the outer wall, and storm or fire the building; another was to kill William on a Sunday, as he drove from Kensington to the chapel at St. James's Palace. The murderers agreed to assemble near where Apsley House now stands. Just as the royal coach passed from Hyde Park across to the Green Park, <num value="30">thirty</num> conspirators agreed to fall on the <num value="25">twenty-five</num> guards, and butcher the king before he could leap out of his carriage. These <num value="2">two</num> Jacobite gentlemen died bravely, proclaiming their entire loyalty to King James and the <QUOTE>Prince of Wales.</QUOTE>
<p>The unfortunate gentlemen who took a moody pleasure in drinking <QUOTE>the squeezing of the rotten range</QUOTE> had long passed on their doleful journey from Newgate to Tyburn before the ghastly procession of the brave and unlucky men of the rising in <datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct> began its mournful march.<NOTE>Amongst these we must not forget Joseph Sullivan, who was executed at Tyburn for high treason, for enlisting men in the service of the Pretender. In the collection of broadsides belonging to the Society of Antiquaries there is <num value="1">one</num> of great interest, entitled <QUOTE>Perkins against Perkin, a dialogue between Sir William Perkins and Major Sulliviane, the <num value="2">two</num> loggerheads upon Temple Bar, concerning the present juncture of affaires.</QUOTE> Date uncertain.</NOTE>

<p>Sir Bernard Burke mentions a tradition that the head of the young Earl of Derwentwater was exposed on Temple Bar in <datestruct value="1716--"><year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct>, and that his wife drove in a cart under the arch while a man hired for the purpose threw down to her the beloved head from the parapet above. But the story is entirely untrue, and is only a version of the way in which the head of Sir Thomas More was removed by his son-in-law and daughter from London ridge, where that cruel tyrant Henry VIII. had placed it. Some years ago, when the Earl of <pb id="p.28" n="28"> Derwentwater's coffin was found in the family vault, the head was lying safe with the body. In <datestruct value="1716--"><year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct> there was, however, a traitor's head spiked on the Bar--that of Colonel John Oxburgh, the victim of mistaken fidelity to a bad cause. He was a brave Lancashire gentleman, who had surrendered with his forces at Preston. He displayed signal courage and resignation in prison, forgetting himself to comfort others.
<p>The next victim was Mr. Christopher Layer, a young Norfolk man and a Jacobite barrister, living in Southampton Buildings, Chancery Lane. He plunged deeply into the Atterbury Plot of <datestruct value="1722--"><year reg="1722">1722</year></datestruct>, and, with Lords North and Grey, enlisted men, hired officers, and, taking advantage of the universal misery caused by the bursting of the South Sea Bubble, planned a general rising against George I. The scheme was, with <num value="4">four</num> distinct bodies of Jacobites, to seize the Tower and the Bank, to arrest the king and the prince, and capture or kill Lord Cadogan, <num value="1">one</num> of the Ministers. At the trial it was proved that Layer had been over to Rome, and had seen the Pretender, who, by proxy, had stood godfather to his child. Troops were to be sent from France; barricades were to be thrown up all over London. The Jacobites had calculated that the Government had only <num value="14000">14,000</num> men to meet them- <num value="3000">3,000</num> of these would be wanted to guard London, <num value="3000">3,000</num> for Scotland, and <num value="2000">2,000</num> for the garrisons. The original design had been to take advantage of the king's departure for Hanover, and, in the words of <num value="1">one</num> of the conspirators, the Jacobites were fully convinced that <QUOTE>they should walk King George out before Lady-day.</QUOTE> Layer was hanged at Tyburn, and his head fixed upon Temple Bar.
<p>Years after, <num value="1">one</num> stormy night in <datestruct value="1753--"><year reg="1753">1753</year></datestruct>, the rebel's skull blew down, and was picked up by a nonjuring attorney, named Pierce, who preserved it as a relic of the Jacobite martyr. It is said that Dr. Richard Rawlinson, an eminent antiquary, obtained what he thought was Layer's head, and desired in his will that it should be placed in his right hand when he was buried. Another version of the story is, that a spurious skull was foisted upon Rawlinson, who died happy in the possession of the doubtful treasure. Rawlinson was bantered by Addison for his pedantry, in <num value="1">one</num> of the <title>Tatlers</title>, and was praised by Dr. Johnson for his learning.
<p>The <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct> rebellion brought the heads of fresh victims to the Bar, and this was the last triumph of barbarous justice. Colonel Francis Towneley's was the <num value="6">sixth</num>; that of Fletcher (his fellow-officer), the <num value="7">seventh</num> and last. The Earls of Kilmarnock and Cromarty, Lord Balmerino, and <num value="37">thirty-seven</num> other rebels (<num value="36">thirty-six</num> of them having been captured in Carlisle) were tried the same session. Towneley was a man of about <num value="54">fifty-four</num> years of age, nephew of Mr. Towneley of Towneley Hall, Lancashire (of the <QUOTE>Towneley Marbles</QUOTE> family), who had been, tried and acquitted in <datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct>, though many of his men were found guilty and executed. The nephew had gone over to France in <datestruct value="1727--"><year reg="1727">1727</year></datestruct>, and obtained a commission from the French king, whom he served for <num value="15">fifteen</num> years, being at the siege of Philipsburg, and close to the Duke of Berwick when that general's head was shot off. About <datestruct value="1740--"><year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct>, Towneley stole over to England to see his friends and to plot against the Hanover family; and as soon as the rebels came into England, he met them between Lancaster and Preston, and came with them to Manchester. At the trial Roger M&lsquo;Donald, an officer's servant, deposed to seeing Towneley on the retreat from Derby, and between Lancaster and Preston riding at the head of the Manchester regiment on a bay horse. He had a white cockade in his hat and wore a plaid sash.
<p>George Fletcher, who was tried at the same time as Towneley, was a rash young chapman, who managed his widowed mother's provision shop <QUOTE>at Salford, just over the bridge in Manchester.</QUOTE> is mother had begged him on her knees to keep out of the rebellion, even offering him a <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">thousand</num> pounds</measure> for his own pocket, if he would stay at home. He bought a captain's commission of Murray, the Pretender's secretary, for <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> pounds</measure>; wore the smart white cockade and a Highland plaid sash lined with white silk; and headed the very <num value="1">first</num> captain's guard mounted for the Pretender at Carlisle. A Manchester man deposed to seeing at the Exchange a sergeant, with a drum, beating up for volunteers for the Manchester regiment.
<p>Fletcher, Towneley, and <num value="7">seven</num> other unfortunate Jacobites were hanged on Kennington Common. Before the carts drove away, the men flung their prayer-books, written speeches, and gold-laced hats gaily to the crowd. Mr. James (Jemmy) Dawson, the hero of Shenstone's touching ballad, was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="9">nine</num>. As soon as they were dead the hangman cut down the bodies, disembowelled, beheaded, and quartered them, throwing the hearts into the fire. A monster--
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.28.1">a fighting-man of the day, named Buckhorse</lemma>--is said to have actually eaten a piece of Townley's flesh, to show his loyalty. Before the ghastly scene was over, the heart of <num value="1">one</num> unhappy spectator had already broken. The lady to whom James Dawson was engaged to be married followed the rebels to the common, and even came near enough to see, with pallid face, the fire kindling, the axe, the coffins, and all the other dreadful <pb id="p.29" n="29"> preparations. She bore up bravely, until she heard her lover was no more. Then she drew her head back into the coach, and crying out, <QUOTE>My dear, I follow thee--I follow thee! Lord God, receive our souls, I pray Thee!</QUOTE> fell on the neck of a companion and expired. Mr. Dawson had behaved gallantly in prison, saying, <QUOTE>He did not care if they put a ton weight of iron upon him, it would not daunt him.</QUOTE>

On being questioned by the puzzled magistrate, he affected a disorder in his senses, and craftily declared that the patriotic reason for his eccentric conduct was his strong attachment to the present Government, and that he thought it not sufficient that a traitor should merely suffer death; that this provoked his indignation, and it had been his constant practice for <num value="3">three</num> nights past to amuse himself in the same manner. <QUOTE>And it is much to be feared,</QUOTE> says the past record of the event, <QUOTE>that the man is a near relation to <num value="1">one</num> of the unhappy sufferers.</QUOTE> Upon searching this very suspicious marksman, about <num value="50">fifty</num> musket bullets were found on him, wrapped up in a paper on which was written the motto, <QUOTE lang=la>Eripuit ille vitam.</QUOTE>

<p>After this, history leaves the heads of the unhappy Jacobites-those lips that love had kissed, those cheeks children had patted--to moulder on in the sun and in the rain, till the last day of <datestruct VALUE="1772-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, when <num value="1">one</num> of them (Towneley or Fletcher) fell.

<p>The cruel-looking spikes were removed early in the present century. The panelled oak gates were often renewed, though certainly shutting them too often never wore them out.
<p>As early as <datestruct value="1790"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct> Alderman Pickett (who built the St. Clement's arch), with other subversive reformers, tried to pull down Temple Bar.

<p>A writer in the <title>Gentleman's Magazine</title>, in <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct> chronicling the clearance away of some hovels encroaching upon the building, says: <QUOTE>It will not <pb id="p.30" n="30"> be surprising if certain amateurs, busy in improving the architectural concerns of the City, should at length request of their brethren to allow the Bar or grand gate of entrance into the City of London to stand, after they have so repeatedly sought to obtain its destruction.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct> a proposal for its repair and restoration was defeated in the Common Council; and <num value="12">twelve</num> months later, a number of bankers, merchants, and traders set their hands to a petition for its removal altogether, as serving no practical purpose, as it impeded ventilation and retarded improvements. Since then Mr. Heywood has proposed to make a circus at Temple Bar, leaving the archway in the centre; and Mr. W. Burges, the architect, suggested a new arch in keeping with the new Law Courts opposite.

<p>Alas, for the changes of time! The Fleet, that little, quick-flowing stream, once so bright and. clear, is now a sewer! but its name remains immortalised by the street called after it.
<p>Although, according to a modern antiquary, a Roman amphitheatre once stood on the site of the Fleet Prison, and Roman citizens were probably interred outside Ludgate, we know but little whether Roman buildings ever stood on the west side of the City gates. Stow, however, describes a stone pavement supported on piles being found, in <datestruct value="1595--"><year reg="1595">1595</year></datestruct>, near the Fleet Street end of Chancery Lane; so that we may presume the soil of the neighbourhood was originally marshy. The <num value="1">first</num> British settlers there must probably have been restless spirits, impatient of the high rents and insufficient room inside the City Walls, and willing, for economy, to risk the forays of any Saxon pirates who chose to steal up the river on a dusky night and sack the outlying cabins of London.
<p>There were certainly rough doings in Fleet Street in the Middle Ages, for the City chronicles tell us of much blood spilt there and of many deeds of violence. In <datestruct value="1228--"><year reg="1228">1228</year></datestruct> (Henry III.) we find, for instance, <num value="1">one</num> Henry de Buke slaying a man named Le Ireis, or Le Tylor, of Fleet Bridge, then fleeing to the church of St. Mary, Southwark, and there claiming sanctuary. In <datestruct value="1311--"><year reg="1311">1311</year></datestruct> (Edward II.) <num value="5">five</num> of the king's not very respectable or law-fearing household were arrested in Fleet Street for a burglary; and though the weak king demanded them (they were perhaps servants of his Gascon favourite, Piers Gaveston, whom the barons afterwards killed), the City refused to give them up, and they probably had short shrive. In the same reign, when the Strand was full of bushes and thickets, Fleet Street could hardly have been continuous. Still, some shops in Fleet Street were, no doubt, even in Edward II.'s reign, of importance, for we find, in <datestruct value="1321--"><year reg="1321">1321</year></datestruct>, a Fleet Street bootmaker supplying the luxurious king with <QUOTE><num value="6">six</num> pairs of boots, with tassels of silk and drops of silver-gilt, the price of each pair being <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>s.</measure></QUOTE> In Richard II.'s reign it is especially mentioned that Wat Tyler's fierce Kentish men sacked the Savoy church, and part of the Temple, and destroyed <num value="2">two</num> forges which had been originally erected on each side of St. Dunstan's Church by the Knight Templars. The Priory of St. John of Jerusalem had paid a rent of <measure value="15s." type=currency><num value="15">15</num>s.</measure> for these forges, which same rent was given for more than a century after their destruction.
<p>The poet Chaucer is said to have beaten a saucy Franciscan friar in Fleet Street, and to have been fined <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>s.</measure> for the offence by the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple; so Speight had heard from <num value="1">one</num> who had seen the entry in the records of the Inner Temple.
<p>In King Henry IV.'s reign another crime disturbed Fleet Street. A Fleet Street goldsmith was murdered by ruffians in the Strand, and his body thrown under the Temple Stairs.
<p>In <datestruct value="1440--"><year reg="1440">1440</year></datestruct> (Henry VI.) a strange procession startled London citizens. Eleanor Cobham, Duchess of Gloucester, did penance through Fleet Street for witchcraft practised against the king. She and certain priests and necromancers had, it was said, melted a wax figure of young King Henry before a slow fire, praying that as that figure melted his life might melt also. Of the duchess's confederates, the Witch of Ely was burned at Smithfield, a canon of Westminster died in the Tower, and a <num value="3">third</num> culprit was hung, drawn, and quartered at Tyburn. The duchess was brought from Westminster, and
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.32.2">landed at the Temple Stairs</LEMMA>, from whence, with a tall wax taper in her hand, she walked bareheaded to St. Paul's, where she offered at the high altar. Another day she did penance at Christ Church, Aldgate; a <num value="3">third</num> day at St. Michael's, Cornhill, the Lord Mayor, sheriffs, and most of the Corporation following. She was then banished to the Isle of Man, and her ghost, they say, still haunts Peel Castle.
<p>And now, in the long panorama of years, there rises in Fleet Street a clash of swords and a clatter of bucklers. In <datestruct value="1441--"><year reg="1441">1441</year></datestruct> (Henry VI.) the general effervescence of the times spread beyond Ludgate, and there was a great affray in Fleet Street between the hot-blooded youths of the Inns of Court and the citizens, which lasted <num value="2">two</num> days; the chief man in the riot was <num value="1">one</num> of Clifford's Inn, named Harbottle; and this irrepressible Harbottle and his fellows only the appearance of the mayor and sheriffs could quiet. In <datestruct value="1458--"><year reg="1458">1458</year></datestruct> (in the same reign) there was a more serious riot of the same kind; the students were then driven back by archers from the Conduit near Shoe Lane to their several inns, and some slain, including <QUOTE>the Queen's attornie,</QUOTE> who certainly ought to have known better and kept closer to his parchments. Even the king's meek <pb id="p.33" n="33"> nature was roused at this; he committed the principal governors of Furnival's, Clifford's, and Barnard's inns to the castle of Hertford, and sent for several aldermen to Windsor Castle, where he either rated or imprisoned them, or both.

<p>Fleet Street often figures in the chronicles of Elizabeth's reign. On <num value="1">one</num> visit it is particularly said that she often graciously stopped her coach to speak to the poor; and a green branch of rosemary given to her by a poor woman near Fleet ridge was seen, not without marvellous wonder of such as knew the presenter, when her Majesty reached Westminster. In the same reign we are told that the young Earl of Oxford, after attending his father's funeral in Essex, rode through Fleet Street to Westminster, attended by <num value="7">seven</num> score horsemen, all in black. Such was the splendid and proud profusion of Elizabeth's nobles.
<p>James's reign was a stormy <num value="1">one</num> for Fleet Street. any a time the
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.33.2">ready &lsquo;prentices</lemma> snatched their clubs (as we read in <title>The Fortunes of Nigel</title>), and, vaulting over their counters, joined in the fray that surged past their shops. In <datestruct value="1621--"><year reg="1621">1621</year></datestruct> particularly, <num value="3">three</num> prentices having abused
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.33.3">Gondomar</lemma>, the Spanish ambassador, as he passed their master's door in Fenchurch Street, the king ordered the riotous youths to be whipped from Aldgate to Temple Bar. In Fleet Street, however, the apprentices rose in force, and shouting <QUOTE>Rescue!</QUOTE> quickly released the lads and beat the marshalmen. If there had been any resistance, another <num value="1000">thousand</num> sturdy &lsquo;prentices would soon have carried on the war.
<p>Nor did Charles's reign bring any quiet to Fleet Street, for then the Templars began to draw out their swords. On the <datestruct VALUE="1627-01-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1627">1627</year></datestruct>, the Templars, having chosen a Mr. Palmer as their Lord of Misrule, went out late at night into Fleet Street to collect his rents. At every door the jovial collectors winded the Temple horn, and if at the <num value="2">second</num> blast the door was not courteously opened, my lord cried majestically, <QUOTE>Give fire, gunner!</QUOTE> and a sturdy smith burst the panels open with a huge sledge-hammer. The horrified Lord Mayor being appealed to soon arrived, attended by the watch of the ward and men armed with halberts. At <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock on the Sunday night the <num value="2">two</num> monarchs came into collision in Hare Alley (now Hare Court). The Lord of Misrule bade my Lord Mayor come to him; but Palmer omitting to take off his hat, the halberts flew sharply round him, his subjects were soundly beaten, and he was dragged off to the Compter. There, with soiled finery, the new year's king was kept <num value="2">two</num> days in durance, the attorney-general at last fetching the fallen monarch away in his own coach. At a court masque soon afterwards the king made the <num value="2">two</num> rival potentates join hands; but the King of Misrule had, nevertheless, to refund all the <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure> he had exacted, and repair all the Fleet Street doors his too handy gunner had destroyed. The very next year the quarrelsome street broke again into a rage, and <num value="4">four</num> persons lost their lives. Of the rioters, <num value="2">two</num> were executed within the week. <num value="1">One</num> of these was John Stanford, of the duke's chamber, and the other Captain Nicholas Ashurst. The quarrel was about politics, and the courtiers seem to have been the offenders.

<p>From Elizabethan times downwards, Fleet Street was a favourite haunt of showmen. Concerning these popular exhibitions Mr. Noble has, with great industry, collected the following curious enumeration :

<p>In old times Fleet Street was rendered picturesque, not only by its many gable-ended houses adorned with quaint carvings and plaster stamped in patterns, but also by the countless signs, gay with gilding and painted with strange devices, which hung above the shop-fronts. Heraldry exhausted all its stores to furnish emblems for different trades. Lions blue and red, falcons, and dragons of all colours, alternated with heads of John the Baptist, flying pigs, and hogs in armour. On a windy day these huge masses of painted timber creaked and waved overhead, to the terror of nervous pedestrians, nor were accidents by any means rare. On the <datestruct VALUE="1718-12-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1718">1718</year></datestruct> (Queen Anne), a signboard opposite Bride Lane, Fleet Street, having loosened the brickwork by its weight and movement, suddenly gave way, fell, and brought the house down with it, killing <num value="4">four</num> persons, <num value="1">one</num> of whom was the queen's jeweller. It was not, however, till <datestruct value="1761"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct> (George II.) that these dangerous signboards were ordered to be placed flat against the walls of the houses.
<p>When Dr. Johnson said, <QUOTE>Come and let us take a walk down Fleet Street,</QUOTE> he proposed no very easy task. The streets in his early days, in London, had no side-pavements, and were roughly paved, with detestable gutters running down the centre. From these gutters the jumbling coaches of those days liberally scattered the mud on the unoffending pedestrians who happened to be crossing at the time. The sedan-chairs, too, were awkward impediments, and choleric people were disposed to fight for the wall. In <datestruct value="1766--"><year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct>, when Lord Eldon came to London as a schoolboy, and <pb id="p.35" n="35"> put up at that humble hostelry the <QUOTE>White Horse,</QUOTE> in Fetter Lane, he describes coming home from Drury Lane with his brother in a sedan. Turning out of Fleet Street into Fetter Lane, some rough fellows pushed against the chair at the corner and upset it, in their eagerness to pass <num value="1">first</num>. Dr. Johnson's curious nervous habit of touching every street-post he passed was cured in <datestruct value="1766--"><year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct>, by the laying down of side-pavements. On that occasion it is said <num value="2">two</num> English paviours in Fleet Street bet that they would pave more in a day than <num value="4">four</num> Scotchmen could. By <num value="3">three</num> o'clock the Englishmen had got so much ahead that they went into a public-house for refreshment, and, afterwards returning to their work, won the wager.

<P>There is, in an almost unknown essay by Dr. Johnson, a delightful passage that connects him indissolubly with the neighbourhood of Temple Bar. The essay, written in <datestruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct> for the <title>Universal Visitor</title>, is entitled <QUOTE>A Project for the Employment of Authors,</QUOTE> and is full of humour, which, indeed, those who knew him best considered the chief feature of Johnson's genius. We rather pride ourselves on the discovery of this pleasant bit of autobiography ;-- <QUOTE>It is my practice,</QUOTE> says Johnson, <QUOTE>when I am in want of amusement, to place myself for an hour at Temple Bar, or any other narrow pass much frequented, and examine <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> the looks of the passengers, and I have commonly found that between the hours of <num value="11">eleven</num> and <num value="4">four</num> every <num value="6">sixth</num> man is an author. They are seldom to be seen very early in the morning or late in the evening, but about dinner-time they are all in motion, and have <num value="1">one</num> uniform eagerness in their faces, which gives little opportunity of discerning <pb id="p.36" n="36"> their hopes or fears, their pleasures or their pains. But in the afternoon, when they have all dined, or composed themselves to pass the day without a dinner, their passions have full play, and I can perceive <num value="1">one</num> man wondering at the stupidity of the public, by which his new book has been totally neglected; another cursing the French, who fright away literary curiosity by their threat of an invasion; another swearing at his bookseller, who will advance no money without copy; another perusing as he walks his publisher's bill; another murmuring at an unanswerable criticism; another determining to write no more to a generation of barbarians; and another wishing to try once again whether he cannot awaken the drowsy world to a sense of his merit.</QUOTE> This extract seems to us to form an admirable companion picture to that in which we have already shown Goldsmith bantering his brother Jacobite, Johnson, as they looked up together at the grim heads on Temple Bar.

 Bar the firm still preserve the dusty books of the unfortunate alderman, who fled to Holland. There, on the sallow leaves over which the poor alderman once groaned, you can read the items of our sale of Dunkirk to the French, the dishonourable surrender of which drove the nation almost to madness, and hastened the downfall of Lord Clarendon, who was supposed to have built a magnificent house (on the site of Albemarle Street, Piccadilly) with some of the very money. Charles II. himself banked here, and drew his thousands with all the careless nonchalance of his nature. Nell Gwynne, Pepys, of the <QUOTE>Diary,</QUOTE> and
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.37.2">Prince Rupert</lemma> also had accounts at Child's, and some of these ledgers are still hoarded over Temple Bar in that Venetian-looking room, approached by strange prison-like passages, for which chamber Messrs. Child pay something less than <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure> a-year.
<p>When Prince Rupert died at his house in the Barbican, the valuable jewels of the old cavalry soldier, valued at <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure>, were disposed of in a lottery, managed by Mr. Francis Child, the gold smith; the king himself, who took a halfbusiness- like, half-boyish interest in the matter, counting the tickets among all the lords and ladies at Whitehall. <pb id="p.38" n="38">
<p>In North's <title>Life of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.38.1">Lord Keeper Guildford</lemma></title>, the courtier and lawyer of the reign of Charles II., there is an anecdote that pleasantly connects Child's bank with the fees of the great lawyers who in that evil reign ruled in Chancery Lane:
<p> <QUOTE>The Lord Keeper Guildford's business increased,</QUOTE> says his biographer, <QUOTE>even while he was solicitor, to be so much as to have overwhelmed <num value="1">one</num> less dexterous; but when he was made Attorney- General, though his gains by his office were great, they were much greater by his practice, for that flowed in upon him like an orage, enough to overset <num value="1">one</num> that had not an extraordinary readiness in business. His skull-caps, which he wore when he had leisure to observe his constitution, as I touched before, were now destined to lie in a drawer, to receive the money that came in by fees. <num value="1">One</num> had the gold, another the crowns and half-crowns, and another the smaller money. When these vessels were full, they were committed to his friend (the Hon. Roger North), who was constantly near him, to tell out the cash and put it into the bags according to the contents and so they went to his treasurers, Blanchard & Child, goldsmiths, Temple Bar.</QUOTE>
<p>Year by year the <num value="2">second</num> Sir Francis Child grew in honour. He was alderman, sheriff, Lord Mayor, President of Christ's Hospital, and M.P. for the City, and finally, dying in <datestruct value="1713--"><year reg="1713">1713</year></datestruct>, full of years, was buried under a grand black marble tomb in Fulham churchyard, and his account closed for ever. The family went on living in the sunshine. Sir Robert, the son of the Sir Francis, was also alderman of his ward; and on his death, his brother, Sir Francis, succeeded to all his father's dignities, became an East Indian director, and in <datestruct value="1725--"><year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct> received the special thanks of the citizens for promoting a special act for regulating City elections. Another member of this family (Sir Josiah Child) deserves special mention as <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest writers on political economy and a man much in advance of his time. He saw through the old fallacy about the balance of trade, and explained clearly the true causes of the commercial prosperity of the Dutch. He also condemned the practice of each parish paying for its own poor, an evil which all Poor-law reformers have endeavoured to alter. Sir Josiah was at the head of the East India Company, already feeling its way towards the gold and diamonds of India. His brother was Governor of Bombay, and by the marriage of his numerous daughters--the rich merchant became allied to half the peers and peeresses of England. The grandson of Alderman Backwell married a daughter of the <num value="2">second</num> Sir Francis Child, and his daughter married William Praed, the Truro banker, who early in the present century opened a bank at <num value="189">189</num>, Fleet Street. So, like <num value="3">three</num> strands of a gold chain, the <num value="3">three</num> banking families were welded together. In <datestruct value="1689--"><year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct> Child's bank seems to have for a moment tottered, but was saved by the timely loan of <num value="1400">1,400</num> proffered by that overbearing woman the

<p>In Pennant's time (<datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>) the original goldsmith's shop seems to have still existed in Fleet Street, in connection with this bank. The principal of the firm was the celebrated Countess of Jersey, a former earl having assumed the name of Child on the countess inheriting the estates of her maternal grandfather, Robert Child, Esq., of Osterly Park, Middlesex. A small full-length portrait of this great beauty of George IV.'s court, painted by Lawrence in his elegant but meretricious manner, hangs in the <num value="1">first</num>-floor room of the old bank. The last Child died early in this century. A descendant of Addison is a member of the present firm. In Chapter I., Book I., of his <title>Tale of <num value="2">Two</num> Cities,</title>
Dickens has sketched Child's bank with quite an Hogarthian force and colour. He has playfully exaggerated the smallness, darkness, and ugliness of the building, of which he describes the partners as so proud; but there is all his usual delightful humour, occasionally passing into caricature:--

<p>The noisy <QUOTE>Devil Tavern</QUOTE> (No. <num value="2">2</num>, Fleet Street) had stood next the quiet goldsmith's shop ever <pb id="p.39" n="39"> since the time of James I. Shakespeare himself must, day after day, have looked up at the old sign of St. Dunstan tweaking the Devil by the nose, that flaunted in the wind near the Bar. Perhaps the sign was originally a compliment to the goldsmith's men who frequented it, for St. Dunstan was, like St. Eloy, a patron saint of goldsmiths, and himself worked at the forge as an amateur artificer of church plate. It may, however, have only been a mark of respect to the saint, whose church stood hard by, to the east of Chancery Lane. At the <QUOTE>Devil</QUOTE> the Apollo Club, almost the <num value="1">first</num> institution of the kind in London, held its merry meetings, presided over by that grim yet jovial despot,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.39.1">Ben Jonson</lemma>.
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.39.2">The bust of Apollo</lemma>, skilfully modelled from the head of the Apollo Belvidere, that once kept watch over the door, and heard in its time millions of witty things and scores of fond recollections of Shakespeare by those who personally knew and loved him, is still preserved at Child's bank. They also show there among their heirlooms <title>The Welcome,</title> probably written by immortal Ben himself, which is full of a jovial inspiration that speaks well for the canary at the <QUOTE>Devil.</QUOTE> It used to stand over the chimney-piece, written in gilt letters on a black board, and some of the wittiest and wisest men of the reigns of James and Charles must have read it over their cups. The verses run,--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Welcome all who lead or follow
<L>To the oracle of Apollo, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 Beneath these verses some enthusiastic disciple of the author has added the brief epitaph inscribed by an admirer on the crabbed old poet's tombstone in Westminster Abbey,--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote>O, rare Ben Jonson.</QUOTE>
The rules of the club (said to have been originally cut on a slab of black marble) were placed above the fireplace. They were devised by Ben Jonson, in imitation of the rules of the Roman entertainments, collected by the learned Lipsius; and, as Leigh Hunt says, they display the author's usual style of elaborate and compiled learning, not without a taste of that dictatorial self-sufficiency that made him so many enemies. They were translated by Alexander Brome, a poetical attorney of the day, who was <num value="1">one</num> of Ben Jonson's <num value="12">twelve</num> adopted poetical sons. We have room only for the <num value="1">first</num> few, to show the poetical character of the club:--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Let none but guests or clubbers hither come;
<L>Let dunces, fools, and sordid men keep home;
<L>Let learned, civil, merry men b&lsquo; invited,
<L>And modest, too; nor be choice liquor slighted.
<L>Let nothing in the treat offend the guest:
<L>More for delight than cost prepare the feast.</QUOTE>
 The later rules forbid the discussion of serious and sacred subjects. No itinerant fiddlers (who then, as now, frequented taverns) were to be allowed to obtrude themselves. The feasts were to be celebrated with laughing, leaping, dancing, jests, and songs, and the jests were to be <QUOTE>without reflection.</QUOTE> No man (and this smacks of Ben's arrogance) was to recite <QUOTE>insipid</QUOTE> poems, and no person was to be pressed to write verse. There were to be in this little Elysium of an evening no vain disputes, and no lovers were to mope about unsocially in corners, No fighting or brawling was to be tolerated, and no glasses or windows broken, or was tapestry to be torn down in wantonness. The rooms were to be kept warm; and, above all, any <num value="1">one</num> who betrayed what the club chose to do or say was to be, <hi rend=italics>nolens volens</hi>, banished. Over the clock in the kitchen some wit had inscribed in neat Latin the merry motto, <QUOTE>If the wine of last night hurts you, drink more to-day, and it will cure you</QUOTE> --a happy version of the dangerous axiom of <QUOTE>Take a hair of the dog that bit you.</QUOTE>
<p>At these club feasts the old poet with <QUOTE>the mountain belly and the rocky face,</QUOTE> as he has painted himself, presided, ready to enter the ring against all comers. By degrees the stern man with the worn features, darkened by prison cell and hardened by battle-fields, had mellowed into a Falstaff. Long struggles with poverty had made Ben arrogant, for he had worked as a bricklayer in early life and had served in Flanders as a common soldier; he had killed a rival actor in a duel, and had been in danger of having his nose slit in the pillory for a libel against King James's Scotch courtiers. Intellectually, too, Ben had reason to claim a sort of sovereignty over the minor poets. His <title>Every Man in his Humour</title> had been a great success; Shakespeare had helped him forward, and been his bosom friend. Parts of his <title>Sejanus</title>, such as the speech of Envy, beginning,--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Light, I salute thee, but with wounded nerves,
<L>Wishing thy golden splendour pitchy darkness,</QUOTE>
 are as sublime as his songs, such as
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Drink to me only with thine eyes,</QUOTE>
 are graceful, serious, and lyrical. The great compass of his power and the command he had of the lyre no <num value="1">one</num> could deny; his learning Donne and Camden could vouch for. He had written the most beautiful of court masques; his Bobadil some men preferred to Falstaff. Alas! no Pepys or Boswell has noted the talk of those evenings.
<p>A few glimpses of the meetings we have, and but a few. <num value="1">One</num> night at the. <QUOTE>Devil</QUOTE> a country <pb id="p.40" n="40"> gentleman was boastful of his property. It was all he had to boast about among the poets en, chafed out of all decency and patience, at last roared, <QUOTE>What signify to us your dirt and your clods? Where you have an acre of land I have <num value="10">ten</num> acres of wit!</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Have you so, good Mr. Wise-acre,</QUOTE> retorted Master Shallow. <QUOTE>Why, now, en,</QUOTE> cried out a laughing friend, <QUOTE>you seem to be quite stung.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>I&lsquo; faith, I never was so pricked by a hobnail before,</QUOTE> growled Ben, with a surly smile.
<p>Another story records the
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.40.1"><num value="1">first</num> visit to the <QUOTE>Devil</QUOTE> of Randolph</lemma>, a clever poet and dramatist, who became a clergyman, and died young. The young poet, who had squandered all his money away in London pleasures, on a certain night, before he returned to Cambridge, resolved to go and see Ben and his associates at the <QUOTE>Devil,</QUOTE> cost what it might. But there were <num value="2">two</num> great obstacles-he was poor, and he was not invited. Nevertheless, drawn magnetically by the voices of the illustrious men in the Apollo, Randolph at last peeped in at the door among the waiters. Ben's quick eye soon detected the eager, pale face and the scholar's threadbare habit. <QUOTE>John Bo-peep,</QUOTE> he shouted, <QUOTE>come in!</QUOTE> a summons Randolph gladly obeyed. The club-men instantly began rhyming on the meanness of the intruder's dress, and told him if he could not at once make a verse he must call for a quart of sack. There being <num value="4">four</num> of his tormentors,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.40.2">Randolph, ready enough at such work</lemma><NOTE resp=B>opposite</NOTE>, replied as quick as lightning:--

 <QUOTE>By the Lord!</QUOTE> roared the giant president, <QUOTE>I believe this is my son Randolph!</QUOTE> and on his owning himself, the young poet was kindly entertained, spent a glorious evening, was soaked in sack, <QUOTE>sealed of the tribe of Ben,</QUOTE> and became <num value="1">one</num> of the old poet's <num value="12">twelve</num> adopted sons.

<p>Simon Wadloe, the host of the <QUOTE>Devil,</QUOTE> who died in <datestruct value="1627--"><year reg="1627">1627</year></datestruct>, seems to have been a witty butt of a man, much such another as honest Jack Falstaff; a merry boon companion, not only witty himself, but the occasion of wit in others, quick at repartee, fond of proverbial sayings, curious in his wines.

<p>In Charles II.'s time the <QUOTE>Devil</QUOTE> became frequented by lawyers and physicians. The talk now was about drugs and latitats, jalap and the law of escheats.

<p>In <datestruct value="1746--"><year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct> the Royal Society held its annual dinner in the old consecrated room, and in the year <datestruct value="1752"><year reg="1752">1752</year></datestruct> concerts of vocal and instrumental music were given in the same place.

<p>The last ray of light that fell on the <QUOTE>Devil</QUOTE> was on a memorable spring evening in <datestruct value="1751--"><year reg="1751">1751</year></datestruct>. Dr. Johnson (aged <num value="42">forty-two</num>), then busy all day with his <num value="6">six</num> amanuenses in a garret in Gough Square compiling his Dictionary, at night enjoyed his elephantine mirth at a club in Ivy Lane, Paternoster Row. <num value="1">One</num> night at the club, Johnson proposed to celebrate the appearance of Mrs. Lennox's <num value="1">first</num> novel, <title>The Life of Harriet Stuart,</title> by a supper at the <QUOTE>Devil Tavern.</QUOTE> Mrs. Lennox was a lady for whom Johnson-ranking her afterwards above Mrs. Carter, Mrs. Hannah More, or even his favourite, Miss Burney-had the greatest esteem. Sir John Hawkins, that somewhat malign rival of Boswell, describes the night in a manner, for him, unusually genial. <QUOTE>Johnson,</QUOTE> says Hawkins (and his words are too pleasant to condense), <QUOTE>proposed to us the celebrating the birth of Mrs. Lennox's <num value="1">first</num> literary child, as he called her book, by a whole night spent in festivity. Upon his mentioning it to me, I told him I had never sat up a night in my life; but he continuing to press me, and saying that I should find great delight in it, I, as did all the rest of the company, consented.</QUOTE> (The club consisted of Hawkins, an attorney; Dr. Salter, father of a master of the Charter House; Dr. Hawkesworth, a popular author of the day; Mr. Ryland, a merchant; Mr.John Payne, a bookseller; Dr. Samuel Dyer, a young man training for a Dissenting minister; Dr. William M&lsquo;Ghie, a Scotch physician; Dr. Barker and Dr. Bathurst, young physicians.) <QUOTE>The place appointed was the  <Q>Devil Tavern;</Q>  and there, about the hour of <num value="8">eight</num>, Mrs. Lennox and her husband (a tide-waiter in the Customs), a lady of her acquaintance, with the club and friends, to the number of <num value="20">twenty</num>, assembled. The supper was elegant; Johnson had directed that a magnificent hot apple-pie should make a part of it, and this he would have stuck with bay leaves, because, forsooth, Mrs. Lennox was an authoress and had written verses; and, further, he had prepared for her a crown of laurel, with which, but not till he had invoked the Muses by some ceremonies of his own invention, he encircled her brows. The night passed, as must be imagined, in pleasant conversation and harmless mirth, intermingled at different periods with the refreshment of coffee and tea. About <num value="5">five</num> a.m., Johnson's face <pb id="p.42" n="42"> shone with meridian splendour, though his drink had been only lemonade; but the far greater part of the company had deserted the colours of Bacchus, and were with difficulty rallied to partake of a <num value="2">second</num> refreshment of coffee, which was scarcely ended when the day began to dawn.

<p>The <num value="3">third</num> door from Chancery Lane (No. <num value="197">197</num>, north side), Mr. Timbs points out, was in Charles II.'s time a tombstone-cutter's; and here, in <datestruct value="1684--"><year reg="1684">1684</year></datestruct>, Howel, whose <title>Letters</title> give us many curious pictures of his time, saw a huge monument to <num value="4">four</num> of the Oxenham family, at the death of each of whom a white bird appeared fluttering about their bed. These miraculous occurrences had taken place at a town near Exeter, and the witnesses names duly appeared below the epitaph. No. <num value="197">197</num> was afterwards Rackstrow's museum of natural curiosities and anatomical figures; and the proprietor put Sir Isaac Newton's head over the door for a sign. Among other prodigies was the skeleton of a whale more than <num value="70">seventy</num> feet long. Donovan, a naturalist, succceded Rackstrow (who died in <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>) with his London museum. Then, by a harlequin change, No. <num value="197">197</num> became the office of the <title>Albion</title> newspaper.
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.45.4">Charles Lamb</lemma> was turned over to this journal from
 <hi rend=italics>the Morning Post</hi>. The editor, John Fenwick, the <QUOTE>Bigot</QUOTE> of Lamb's <title>Essay,</title> was a needy, sanguine man, who had purchased the paper of a person named Lovell, who had stood in the pillory for a libel against the Prince of Wales. For a long time Fenwick contrived to pay the Stamp Office dues by money borrowed from compliant friends. <QUOTE>We,</QUOTE> says Lamb, in his delightful way, <QUOTE>attached our small talents to the forlorn fortunes of our friend.  Our occupation was now to write treason.</QUOTE> Lamb hinted at possible abdications. Blocks, axes, and Whitehall tribunals were covered with flowers of so cunning a periphrasis--as, Mr. Bayes says, never naming the <hi>thing</hi> directly--that the keen eye of an Attorney-General was insufficient to detect the lurking snake among them.
<p>At the south-west corner of Chancery Lane  (No. <num value="193">193</num>) once stood an old house said to have been the residence of that unfortunate reformer, Sir John Oldcastle,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.45.5">Baron Cobham</lemma>, who was burnt in St. Giles's Fields in <datestruct value="1417--"><year reg="1417">1417</year></datestruct> (Henry V.) In Charles II.'s reign the celebrated Whig Green Ribbon Club used to meet here, and from the balcony flourish their periwigs, discharge squibs, and wave torches, when a great Protestant procession passed by, to burn the effigy of the Pope at the Temple Gate. The house, <num value="5">five</num> stories high and covered with carvings, was pulled down for City improvements in <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>.
<p>Upon the site of No. <num value="192">192</num> (east corner of Chancery Lane) the father of Cowley, that fantastic poet of Charles II.'s time, it is said carried on the trade of a grocer. In <datestruct value="1740--"><year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct> a later grocer there sold the finest caper tea for <measure value="24s." type=currency><num value="24">24</num>s.</measure> per lb., his fine green for <measure value="18s." type=currency><num value="18">18</num>s.</measure> per lb., hyson at <measure value="16s." type=currency><num value="16">16</num>s.</measure> per lb., and bohea at <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">7</num>s.</measure> per lb.

It is just possible that it was the house originally built by Sir Amyas Paulet, at Wolsey's command, in resentment for Sir Amyas having set Wolsey, when a mere parish priest, in the stocks for a brawl. Wolsey, at the time of the ignominious punishment, was schoolmaster to the children of the Marquis of Dorset. Paulet was confined to this house for <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> years, to appease the proud cardinal, who lived in Chancery Lane.

<p>Praed's Bank (No. <num value="189">189</num>, north side) was founded early in the century by Mr. William Praed, a banker of Truro. The house had been originally the shop of Mrs. Salmon, till she moved to opposite Chancery Lane, and her wax kings and frail queens were replaced by piles of strong boxes and chests of gold. The house was rebuilt in <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, from the designs of Sir John Soane, whose curious museum still exists in Lincoln's Inn Fields. Praed, that delightful poet of society, was of the banker's family, and in him the poetry of refined wealth found a fitting exponent. Fleet Street, indeed, is rich in associations connected with bankers and booksellers; for at No. <num value="19">19</num> (south side) we come to Messrs. Gosling's. This bank was founded in <datestruct value="1650--"><year reg="1650">1650</year></datestruct> by Henry Pinckney, a goldsmith, at the sign of the

The original sign of solid silver, about <num value="2">two</num> feet in height, made to lock and unlock, was discovered in the house in <datestruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct>. It had probably been taken down on the general removal of out-door signs and forgotten. In a secret service-money account of the time of Charles II., there is an entry of a sum of  <measure value="646l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="646">646</num></measure> <measure value="8s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="8">8</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> for several parcels of gold and silver lace bought of William Gosling and partners by the fair Duchess of Cleveland, for the wedding clothes of the Lady Sussex and Lichfield.
<p>No. <num value="32">32</num> (south side), still a bookseller's, was originally kept for <num value="40">forty</num> years by William Sandby, <num value="1">one</num> of the partners of Snow's bank in the Strand.

Murray tried in vain to induce Falconer, the author of <QUOTE>The Shipwreck,</QUOTE> to join him as a partner. The <num value="1">first</num> Murray died in <num value="793">793</num>. In <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct> John Murray, the son of the founder, removed to <num value="50">50</num>, Albemarle Street.

<p>The original Columbarian Society, long since extinct, was born at offices in Fleet Street, near St. Dunstan's. This society was replaced by the Pholoperisteron, dear to all pigeon-fanciers, which held its meetings at <QUOTE>Freemasons' Tavern,</QUOTE> and eventually amalgamated with its rival, the National Columbarian, the fruitful union producing the National Peristeronic Society, now a flourishing institution, meeting periodically at <QUOTE>Evans's,</QUOTE> and holding a great fluttering and most pleasant annual show at the Crystal Palace. It is on these occasions that clouds of carrier-pigeons are let off, to decide the speed with which the swiftest and best <pb id="p.47" n="47"> trained bird can reach a certain spot (aflight, of course, previously known to the bird), generally in Belgium.

<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.47.5">The present building was erected in <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct></LEMMA>. The older church stood <num value="30">thirty</num> feet forward, blocking the carriage-way, and shops with projecting signs were built against the east and west walls. The churchyard was a favourite locality for booksellers. <num value="1">One</num> of the most interesting stories connected with the old building relates to
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.47.3">Felton, the fanatical assassin of the Duke of Buckingham, the favourite of Charles I</lemma>. The murderer's mother and sisters lodged at a haberdasher's in Fleet Street and were attending service in St. Dunstan's Church when the news arrived from Portsmouth; they swooned away when they heard the name of the assassin. Many of the clergy of St. Dunstan's have been eminent men. Tyndale, the translator of the New Testament, did duty here. The poet Donne was another of the St. Dunstan's worthies; and Sherlock and
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.47.4">Romaine</lemma>
both lectured at this church. The rectory house, sold in <datestruct value="1693--"><year reg="1693">1693</year></datestruct>, was No. <num value="183">183</num>.
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.47.6">The clock of old St Dunstan's</LEMMA>
was <num value="1">one</num> of the great London sights in the last century. The giants that struck the hours had been set up in <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>, and were made by Thomas Harrys, of Water Lane, for <measure value="35l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="35">35</num></measure> and the old clock. Lord Hertford purchased them, in <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, for <num value="210">210</num>, and set them up at his villa in Regent's Park.

cleverly compares dull poets to the St. Dunstan's giants:--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>When labour and when dulness, club in hand,

 The most interesting relic of modern St. Dunstan's is that unobtrusive figure of Queen Elizabeth at the east end. This figure from the old church came from Ludgate when the City gates were destroyed in <datestruct value="1786--"><year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct>. It was bought for <measure value="16l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="16">16</num></measure> <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> when the old church came to the ground, and was re-erected over the vestry entrance. The companion statues of King Lud and his <num value="2">two</num> sons were deposited in the parish bone-house. On <num value="1">one</num> occasion when Baxter was preaching in the old church of St. Dunstan's, there arose a panic among the audience from <num value="2">two</num> alarms of the building falling. Every face turned pale; but the preacher, full of faith, sat calmly down in the pulpit till the panic subsided, then, resuming his sermon, said reprovingly, <QUOTE>We are in the service of God, to prepare ourselves that we may be fearless at the great noise of the dissolving world when the heavens shall pass away and the elements melt with fervent heat.</QUOTE>
<p>Mr. Noble, in his record of this parish, has remarked on the extraordinary longevity attained by the incumbents of St. Dunstan's. Dr. White held the living for <num value="49">forty-nine</num> years; Dr. Grant, for <num value="59">fifty-nine</num>; the Rev. Joseph Williamson (Wilkes's chaplain) for <num value="41">forty-one</num> years; while the Rev.
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.47.7">William Romaine</LEMMA> continued lecturer for <num value="46">forty-six</num> years. The solution of the problem probably is that a good and secure income is the best promoter of longevity. Several members of the great banking family of Hoare are buried in St. Dunstan's; but by far the most remarkable monument in the church bears the following inscription:--

<p>Among the burials at St. Dunstan's noted in the registers, the following are the most remarkable:--<datestruct value="1559--"><year reg="1559">1559</year></datestruct>-<num value="60">60</num>, Doctor Oglethorpe, the Bishop of Carlisle, who crowned Queen Elizabeth; <datestruct value="1664--"><year reg="1664">1664</year></datestruct>, Dame Bridgett Browne, wife of Sir Richard Browne, major-general of the City forces, who offered <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> reward for the capture of Oliver Cromwell; <datestruct value="1732--"><year reg="1732">1732</year></datestruct> Christopher Pinchbeck, the inventor of the metal named after him and a maker of musical clocks.

The church is of a flimsy Gothic, the true revival having hardly then commenced. The <num value="8">eight</num> bells are from the old church. The <num value="2">two</num> heads over the chief entrance are portraits of Tyndale and Dr. Donne; and the painted window is the gift of the Hoare family.
<p>According to Aubrey, Drayton, the great topographical poet, lived at <QUOTE>the bay-window house next the east end of St. Dunstan's Church.</QUOTE> Now it is a clearly proved fact that the Great Fire stopped just <num value="3">three</num> doors east of St. Dunstan's, as did also, Mr. Timbs says, another remarkable <pb id="p.48" n="48"> fire in <datestruct value="1730--"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>; so it is not impossible that the author of <title>The Polyolbion,</title> that good epic poem, once lived at the present No. <num value="180">180</num>, though the next house eastward is certainly older than its neighbour. We have given a drawing of the house.
<p>That shameless rogue, Edmund Curll, lived at the <QUOTE>Dial and Bible,</QUOTE> against St. Dunstan's Church. When this clever rascal was put in the pillory at Charing Cross, he persuaded the mob he was in for a political offence, and so secured the pity of the crowd.

<NOTE resp=B>

<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.50.3">Pynson's Printer's Mark </LEMMA></NOTE>, who had worked at Caxton's press, and was a contemporary of De Worde. According to Mr. T. C.

<p>To this brief chronicle of early Fleet Street printers let us add Richard Bancks, who, in <datestruct value="1600--"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct>, at his office, <QUOTE>the sign of the White Hart,</QUOTE> printed that exquisite fairy poem, Shakespeare's <title>Midsummer Night's Dream.</title> How <num value="1">one</num> envies the <QUOTE>reader</QUOTE> of that office, the compositors--nay, even the sable imp who pulled the proof, and snatched a passage or <num value="2">two</num> about Mustard and Pease Blossom in a surreptitious glance! Another great Fleet Street printer was Richard Grafton, the printer, as Mr. Noble says, of the <num value="1">first</num> correct folio English translation of the Bible, by permission of Henry VIII. When in Paris, Grafton had to fly with his books from the Inquisition. After his patron Cromwell's execution, in <datestruct value="1540--"><year reg="1540">1540</year></datestruct>, Grafton was sent to the Fleet for printing Bibles; but in the happier times of Edward VI. he became king's printer at the Grey Friars, now Christ's Hospital. His former fellowworker in Paris, Edward Whitchurch, set up his press at De Worde's old house, the <QUOTE>Sun,</QUOTE> near the Fleet Street conduit. He published the <title>Paraphrase of Erasmus,</title> a copy of which, Mr, Noble says, existed, with its desk-chains, in the vestry of St. Benet's, Gracechurch Street.

<p>The <QUOTE>Hercules Pillars</QUOTE> (now No. <num value="27">27</num>, Fleet Street, south) was a celebrated tavern as early as the reign of James I., and in the now nameless alley by its side several houses of entertainment nestled themselves. The tavern is interesting to us chiefly because it was a favourite resort of Pepys, who frequently mentions it in his quaint and graphic way.

<p>It was at No. <num value="56">56</num> (south side) that Lamb's friend, William Hone, the publisher of the delightful
<title>Table Book</title> and <title>Every-day Book,</title> commenced business about <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct> he was brought before the Wardmote Inquest of St. Dunstan's for placarding his shop on Sundays, and for carrying on a retail trade as bookseller and stationer, not being a freeman. The Government had no doubt suggested the persecution of so troublesome an opponent, whose defence of himself is said to have all but killed Lord Ellenborough, the judge who tried him for publishing blasphemous parodies. In <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct> Hone took great interest in the case of Eliza Fenning, a poor innocent servant girl, who was hung for a supposed attempt to poison her master, a law stationer in Chancery Lane. It was afterwards believed that a nephew of Mr. Turner really put the poison in the dough of some dumplings, in revenge at being kept short of money.
<p>Mr. Cyrus Jay, a shrewd observer, was present at Hone's trial, and has described it with vividness:-- <pb id="p.52" n="52">
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Hone defended himself firmly and well, but he had no spark of eloquence about him. For years afterwards I was often with him, and he was made a great deal of in society. He became very religious, and died a member of Mr. Clayton's Independent chapel, worshipping at the Weigh House. The last important incident of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.52.1">Lord Ellenborourh's</lemma>
political life was the part he took as presiding judge in Hone's trials for the publication of certain blasphemous parodies. At this time he was suffering from the most intense exhaustion, and his constitution was sinking under the fatigues of a long and sedulous discharge of his important duties. This did not deter him from taking his seat upon the bench on this occasion. When he entered the court, previous to the trial, Hone shouted out,  <Q> I am glad to see you, Lord Ellenborough. I know what you are come here for; know what you want.</Q>   <Q>I am come to do justice,</Q>  replied his lordship.  <Q>My wish is to see justice done. </Q>   <Q>Is it not rather, my lord,</Q>  retorted Hone,  <Q>to send a poor devil of a bookseller to rot in a dungeon?</Q>  In the course of the proceedings Lord Ellenborough more than once interfered. Hone, it must be acknowledged, with less vehemence than might have been expected, requested him to forbear. The next time his lordship made an observation, in answer to something the defendant urged in the course of his speech, Hone exclaimed, in a voice of thunder,  <Q> I do not speak to you, my lord; you are not my judge; these,</Q>  pointing to the jury,  <Q>these are my judges, and it is to them that I address myself.</Q>  Hone avenged himself on what he called the Chief Justice's partiality; he wounded him where he could not defend himself. Arguing that Athanasius was not the author of the creed that bears his name, he cited, by way of authority, passages from the writings of Gibbon and Warburton to establish his position. Fixing his eyes on Lord Ellenborough, he then said,  <Q> And, further, your lordship's father, the late worthy Bishop of Carlisle, has taken a similar view of the same creed.</Q>  Lord Ellenborough could not endure this allusion to his father's heterodoxy. In a broken voice he exclaimed,  <Q>For the sake of decency, forbear.</Q>  The <hi>request</hi> was immediately complied with. The jury acquitted Hone, a result which is said to have killed the Chief Justice; but this is probably not true. That he suffered in consequence of the trial is certain. After he entered his private room, when the trial was over, his strength had so far deserted him that his son was obliged to put his hat on for him. But he quickly recovered his spirits; and on his way home, in passing through Charing Cross, he pulled the check-string, and said,  <Q>It just occurs to me that they sell here the best herrings in London; buy <num value="6">six</num>.</Q>  Indeed Dr. Turner, afterwards Bishop of Calcutta, who accompanied him in his carriage, said that so far from his nerves, being shaken by the hootings of the mob, Lord Ellenborough only observed that their saliva was worse than their bite <gap>

<p>When Hone was tried before him for blasphemy,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.52.2">Lord Tenterden</lemma> treated him with great forbearance; but Hone, not content with the indulgence, took to vilifying the judge.  <Q>Even in a Turkish court I should not have met with the treatment I have experienced here,</Q>  he exclaimed.  <Q>Certainly,</Q>  replied Lord Tenterden;  <Q>the bowstring would have been round your neck an hour ago.</Q> </QUOTE>

<P>Mr. Noble also records pleasantly sundry musical feats accomplished on the bells of St. Bride's. In <datestruct value="1710--"><year reg="1710">1710</year></datestruct> <num value="10">ten</num> bells were cast for this church by Abraham Rudhall, of Gloucester, and on the <datestruct VALUE="1717-01-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1717">1717</year></datestruct>, it is recorded that the <num value="1">first</num> complete peal of <num value="5040">5,040</num> grandsire caters ever rung was effected by the <QUOTE>London scholars.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1718--"><year reg="1718">1718</year></datestruct> <num value="2">two</num> treble bells were added; and on the <datestruct VALUE="1724-01-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1724">1724</year></datestruct>, the <num value="1">first</num> peal ever completed in this kingdom upon <num value="12">twelve</num> bells was rung by the college youths; and in <datestruct value="1726--"><year reg="1726">1726</year></datestruct> the <num value="1">first</num> peal of Bob Maximus, <num value="1">one</num> of the ringers being Mr. Francis (afterwards Admiral) Geary.

Such was the dignity of the <QUOTE>campanularian</QUOTE> art in those days. When St. Bride's bells were <num value="1">first</num> put up, Fleet Street used to be thronged with carriages full of gentry, who had come far and near to hear the pleasant music float aloft. During the terrible

<p>Many great people lie in and around St. Bride's; and Mr. Noble gives several curious extracts from the registers. Among the names we find Wynkyn de Worde, the <num value="2">second</num> printer in London; Baker, the chronicler; Lovelace, the Cavalier poet, who died of want in Gunpowder Alley, Shoe Lane; Ogilby, the translator of Homer; the Countess of Orrery (<datestruct value="1710--"><year reg="1710">1710</year></datestruct>) Elizabeth Thomas, a lady immortalised by Pope; and John Hardham, the Fleet Street tobacconist. The entrance to the vault of Mr. olden (a friend of Pepys), on the north side of the church, is a relic of the older building. Inside St. Bride's are monuments to Richardson, the novelist; Nichols, the historian of Leicestershire; and Alderman Waithman. Among the clergy of St. Bride's Mr, Noble notes John Cardmaker, who was burnt at Smithfield for heresy, in <datestruct value="1555--"><year reg="1555">1555</year></datestruct>; Fuller, the Church historian and author of the <title>Worthies,</title>
who was lecturer here; Dr. Isaac Madox, originally an apprentice to a pastrycook, and who died Bishop of Winchester in <datestruct value="1759--"><year reg="1759">1759</year></datestruct>; and Dr. John Thomas, vicar, who died in <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>.

<p>A pamphlet attributed to Mr. Blanchard conveys, after all, the most minute account of the origin, of

<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.58.4">Title page. Mayhew's Great World of London</LEMMA></NOTE>

<p>The circumstance which led to <title>Punch</title>&lsquo;s birth was simple enough. In <datestruct VALUE="1841-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>, Mr. Last called upon Mr. Alfred Mayhew, then in the office of his father, Mr. Joshua Mayhew, the well-known solicitor, of Carey Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields. Mr. Mayhew was Mr. Last's legal adviser, and Mr. Last was well acquainted with several of his sons. Upon the occasion in question Mr. Last made some inquiries of Mr. Alfred Mayhew concerning his brother Henry, and his occupation at the time. Mr. Henry Mayhew had, even at his then early age, a reputation for the high abilities which, he afterwards developed, had already experience in various departments of literature, and had exercised his projective and inventive faculties in various ways. If his friends had heard nothing of him for a few months, they usually found that he had a new design in hand, which was, however, in many cases, of a more original than practical character. Mr. Henry Mayhew, as it appeared from his brother Alfred's reply, was not at that time engaged in any new effort of his creative genius, and would be open to a proposal for active service.
<p>Having obtained Mr. Henry Mayhew's address, which was in Clement's Inn, Mr. Last called upon that gentleman on the following morning, and opened to him a proposal for a comic and satirical journal. Henry Mayhew readily entertained the idea; and the next question was, <QUOTE>Can you get up a staff?</QUOTE> Henry Mayhew mentioned his friend ark Lemon as a good commencement; and the pair proceeded to call upon that gentleman, who was living, not far off, in Newcastle Street, Strand. The almost immediate result was the starting of <title>Punch.</title>

<p>At a meeting at the <QUOTE>Edinburgh Castle</QUOTE> Mr. ark Lemon drew up the original prospectus. It was at <num value="1">first</num> intended to call the new publication The <title>Funny Dog,</title> or <title>Funny Dog, with Comic Tales,</title> and from the <num value="1">first</num> the subsidiary title of the
<title>London Charivari </title> was agreed upon. At a subsequent meeting at the printing-office, some <num value="1">one</num> made some allusion to the <QUOTE>Punch,</QUOTE> and some joke about the <QUOTE>Lemon</QUOTE> in it. Henry Mayhew, with his usual electric quickness, at once flew at the idea, and cried out, <QUOTE>A good thought; we'll call it <title>Punch</title>.</QUOTE> It was then remembered that, years before, Douglas Jerrold had edited a <title>Penny Punch</title>
for Mr. Duncombe, of Middle Row, Holborn, but this was thought no objection, and the new name was carried by acclamation. It was agreed that there should be <num value="4">four</num> proprietors-Messrs. Last, Landells, Lemon, and Mayhew. Last was to supply the printing, Landells the engraving, and Lemon and Mayhew were to be co-editors. George Hodder, with his usual good-nature, at once secured. Mr. Percival Leigh as a contributor, and Leigh brought in his friend Mr. John Leech, and Leech brought in Albert Smith. Mr. Henning designed the cover. When Last had sunk <measure value="600l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="600">600</num></measure>, he sold his share to Messrs. Bradbury and Evans, on receiving the amount of his then outstanding liabilities. At the transfer, Henning and Newman both retired, Mr. Coyne and Mr. Grattan seldom contributed, and Messrs. Mayhew and Landells also seceded.
<p>Mr.Hine, the artist, remained with <title>Punch</title> for many years; and among other artistic contributors who <QUOTE>came and went,</QUOTE> to use Mr. Blanchard's own words, we must mention Birket Foster, Alfred Crowquill, Lee, Hamerton, John Gilbert, William Harvey, and Kenny Meadows, the last of whom illustrated <num value="1">one</num> of Jerrold's earliest series, <title>Punch's Letters to His Son.</title> <title>Punch's Almanac</title> for <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct> was concocted for the greater part by Dr. Maginn, who was then in the Fleet Prison, where Thackeray has drawn him, in the character of Captain Shandon, writing the famous prospectus for the <title>Pall Mall Gazette</title>.

Mr. Bell was an energetic man, and the paper succeeded in obtaining a good position; but he was not a man of large capital, and other persons had shares in the property. In consequence of difficulties between the proprietors there were at <num value="1">one</num> time <num value="3">three</num> <title>Dispatches</title> in the field- Bell's, Kent's, and Duckett's; but the <num value="2">two</num> lastmentioned were short-lived, and Mr. Bell maintained his position, Bell's was a sporting paper, with many columns devoted to pugilism, and a woodcut exhibiting <num value="2">two</num> boxers ready for an encounter. But the editor (says a story more or less authentic), Mr. Samuel Smith, who had obtained his post by cleverly reporting a fight near Canterbury, <num value="1">one</num> day received a severe thrashing from a famous member of the ring. This changed the editor's opinions as to the propriety of boxing-at anyrate pugilism was repudiated by the <title>Dispatch</title>

published at fourpence, and for a penny, it created a sensation. Here was a penny paper, containing <pb id="p.61" n="61"> not only the same amount of telegraphic and general information as the other high-priced papers--their price being then fourpence--but also evidently written, in its leading article department, with an ability which could only be surpassed by that of the leading articles of the

<P>The <QUOTE>Globe Tavern</QUOTE> (No. <num value="134">134</num>, north), though now only a memory, abounds with traditions of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.61.1">Goldsmith</lemma>
and his motley friends. The house, in <datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct>, was leased to <num value="1">one</num> Henry Hottersall for <num value="41">forty-one</num> years, at the yearly rent of <measure value="75l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="75">75</num></measure>, <num value="10">ten</num> gallons of Canary sack, and <measure value="400l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="400">400</num></measure> fine. Mr. John Forster gives a delightful sketch of Goldsmith's Wednesday evening club at the <QUOTE>Globe,</QUOTE> in <datestruct value="1767--"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>. When not at Johnson's great club, Oliver beguiled his cares at a shilling rubber club at the <QUOTE>Devil Tavern</QUOTE> or at a humble gathering in the parlour of the <QUOTE>Bedford,</QUOTE> Covent Garden. A hanger--on of the theatres, who frequented the <QUOTE>Globe,</QUOTE> has left notes which Mr. Forster has admirably used, and which we now abridge without further apology. Grim old Macklin belonged to the club it is certain; and among the less obscure members was King, the comedian, the celebrated impersonator of Lord Ogleby. Hugh Kelly, another member, was a clever young Irishman, who had chambers near Goldsmith in the Temple. He had been a staymaker's apprentice, who, turning law writer, and soon landing as a hack for the magazines, set up as a satirist for the stage and eventually, <pb id="p.62" n="62"> through Garrick's patronage, succeeded in sentimental comedy. It was of him Johnson said, <QUOTE>Sir, I never desire to converse with a man who has written more than he has read.</QUOTE> Poor Kelly afterwards went to the Bar, and died of disappointment and over-work. A <num value="3">third</num> member was Captain Thompson, a friend of Garrick, who wrote some good sea songs and edited <QUOTE>Andrew Marvell;</QUOTE> but foremost among all the boon companions was a needy Irish doctor named Glover, who had appeared on the stage, and who was said to have restored to life a man who had been hung; this Glover, who was famous for his songs and imitations, once had the impudence, like Theodore Hook, to introduce Goldsmith, during a summer ramble in Hampstead, to a party where he was an entire stranger, and to pass himself off as a friend of the host. <QUOTE>Our Dr. Glover,</QUOTE> says Goldsmith, <QUOTE>had a constant levee of his distressed countrymen, whose wants, as far as he was able, he always relieved.</QUOTE> Gordon, the fattest man in the club, was renowned for his jovial song of <title>Nottingham Ale;</title> and on special occasions Goldsmith himself would sing his favourite nonsense about the little old woman who was tossed <num value="17">seventeen</num> times higher than the moon. A fat pork-butcher at the <QUOTE>Globe</QUOTE> used to offend Goldsmith by constantly shouting out, <QUOTE>Come, Noll, here's my service to you, old boy.</QUOTE> After the success of <title>The Goodnatured Man</title>, this coarse familiarity was more than Goldsmith's vanity could bear, so <num value="1">one</num> special night he addressed the butcher with grave reproof. The stolid man, taking no notice, replied briskly, <QUOTE>Thankee, Mister Noll.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Well, where is the advantage of your reproof?</QUOTE> asked Glover, <QUOTE>In truth,</QUOTE> said Goldsmith, good-naturedly, <QUOTE>I give it up; I ought to have known before that there is no putting a pig in the right way.</QUOTE> Sometimes rather cruel tricks were played on the credulous poet. <num value="1">One</num> evening Goldsmith came in clamorous for his supper, and ordered chops. Directly the supper came in, the wags, by pre-agreement, began to sniff and swear. Some pushed the plate away; others declared the rascal who had dared set such chops before a gentleman should be made to swallow them himself. The waiter was savagely rung up, and forced to eat the supper, to which he consented with well-feigned reluctance, the poet calmly ordering a fresh supper and a dram for the poor waiter, <QUOTE>who otherwise might get sick from so nauseating a meal.</QUOTE> Poor Goldy! kindly even at his most foolish moments. A sadder story still connects Goldsmith with the <QUOTE>Globe.</QUOTE> Ned Purdon, a worn-out booksellers' hack and a <hi rend=italics>protege</hi> of Goldsmith, dropped down dead in Smithfield. Goldsmith wrote his epitaph as he came from his chambers in the Temple to the <QUOTE>Globe.</QUOTE> The lines are:--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Here lies poor Ned Purdon, from misery freed,
<L>Who long was a booksellers' hack;
<L>He led such a miserable life in this world,
<L>I don't think he'll wish to come back.</QUOTE>
 Goldsmith sat next Glover that night at the club, and Glover heard the poet repeat, <hi rend=italics>sotto voce</hi>, with a mournful intonation, the words,--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>I don't think he'll wish to come back.</QUOTE>
 Oliver was musing over his own life, and Mr. Forster says touchingly, <QUOTE>It is not without a certain pathos to me, indeed, that he should have so repeated it.</QUOTE>
<p>Among other frequenters of the <QUOTE>Globe</QUOTE> were Boswell's friend Akerman, the keeper of Newgate, who thought it prudent never to return home till daybreak; and William Woodfall, the celebrated Parliamentary reporter. In later times Brasbridge, the sporting silversmith of Fleet Street, was a frequenter of the club. He tells us that among his associates was a surgeon, who, living on the Surrey side of the Thames, had to take a boat every night, Blackfriars Bridge not being then built. This nightly navigation cost him <num value="3">three</num> or <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> shillings</measure> a time, yet, when the bridge came, he grumbled at having to pay a penny toll. Among other frequenters of the <QUOTE>Globe,</QUOTE> Mr. Timbs enumerates <QUOTE>Archibald Hamilton, whose mind was  <Q>fit for a lord chancellor;</Q>  Dunstall, the comedian; Carnan, the bookseller, who defeated the Stationers' Company in the almanack trial; and, later still, the eccentric Hugh Evelyn, who set up a claim upon the great Surrey estate of Sir Frederic Evelyn.</QUOTE>
<p>The <title>Standard</title> (in Shoe Lane), <QUOTE>the largest daily paper,</QUOTE> was originally an evening paper alone. In <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct> a deputation of the leading men opposed to Catholic Emancipation waited on Mr. Charles Baldwin, proprietor of the <title>St. James's Chronicle</title>, and begged him to start an anti-Catholic evening paper, but Mr. Baldwin refused unless a preliminary sum of <measure value="15000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="15000">15,000</num></measure> was lodged at the banker's. A year later this sum was deposited, and in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct> the <title>Evening Standard</title>, edited by Dr. Giffard, ex-editor of the
 <title>St. James's Chronicle</title>, appeared. Mr. Alaric Watts, the poet, was the <num value="1">first</num> sub-editor; he was soon succeeded by the celebrated Dr. Maginn. The daily circulation soon rose from <num value="700">700</num> or <num value="800">800</num> copies to <num value="3000">3,000</num> and over. The profits Mr. Grant calculates at <num value="7000">7,000</num> to <num value="8000">8,000</num> a year. On the bankruptcy of Mr. Charles Baldwin, Mr. James Johnson bought the <title>Morning Herald</title> and
<title>Standard</title>, plant and all, for <measure value="16500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="16500">16,500</num></measure>. The new <pb id="p.63" n="63"> proprietor reduced the <title>Standard</title> from fourpence to twopence, and made it a morning as well as an evening paper. In <datestruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct> he reduced it to a penny only. The result was a great success. The annual income of the <title>Standard</title> is now, Mr. Grant says, <QUOTE>much exceeding yearly the annual incomes of most of the ducal dignities of the land.</QUOTE> The legend of the Duke of Newcastle presenting Dr. Giffard, in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, with <measure value="1200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1200">1,200</num></measure> for a violent article against Roman Catholic claims, has been denied by Dr. Giffard's son in the <title>Times</title>. The Duke of Wellington once wrote to Dr. Giffard to dictate the line which the <title>Standard</title> and <title>Morning Herald</title> were to adopt on a certain question during the agitation on the Maynooth Bill; and Dr. Giffard withdrew his opposition to please Sir Robert Peel--a concession which injured the <title>Standard</title>. Yet in the following year, when Sir Robert Peel brought in his Bill for the abolition of the corn laws, he did not even pay Dr. Giffard the compliment of apprising him of his intention. Such is official gratitude when a tool is done with.
<p>Near Shoe Lane lived <num value="1">one</num> of Caxton's disciples.
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.63.1">Wnkyn de Worde</lemma> who is supposed to have been <num value="1">one</num> of Caxton's assistants or workmen, was a native of Lorraine. He carried on a prosperous career, says Dibdin, from <datestruct value="1502--"><year reg="1502">1502</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1534--"><year reg="1534">1534</year></datestruct>, at the sign of the <QUOTE>Sun,</QUOTE> in the parish of St. Bride's, Fleet Street. In upwards of <num value="400">four hundred</num> works published by this industrious man he displayed unprecedented skill, elegance, and care, and his Gothic type was considered a pattern for his successors. The books that came from his press were chiefly grammars, romances, legends of the saints, and fugitive poems; he never ventured on an English New Testament, nor was any drama published bearing his name. is great patroness, Margaret, the mother of Henry VII., seems to have had little taste to guide De Worde in his selection, for he never reprinted the works of Chaucer or of Gower; nor did his humble patron, Robert Thomey, the mercer, lead him in a better direction. De Worde filled his blackletter books with rude engravings, which he used so indiscriminately that the same cut often served for books of a totally opposite character. By some writers De Worde is considered to be the <num value="1">first</num> introducer of Roman letters into this country; but the honour of that mode of printing is now generally claimed by Pynson, a contemporary. Among other works published by De Worde were
<title>The Ship of Fools,</title> that great satire that was so long popular in England; Mandeville's lying
<title>Travels ;</title> <title>La Morte d&lsquo;Arthur</title> (from which Tennyson has derived so much inspiration); <title>The Golden Legend;</title> and <num value="3">three</num> curious treatises on
<title>Hunting, Hawking, and Fishing,</title> partly written by Johanna Berners, a prioress of St. Alban's. In De Worde's <title>Collection of Christmas Carols</title> we find the words of that fine old song, still sung annually at Queen's College, Oxford,--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>The boar's head in hand bring I,
<L>With garlands gay and rosemary.</QUOTE>
 De Worde also published some writings of Erasmus. The old printer was buried in the parish church of St. Bride's, before the high altar of St. Katharine; and he left land to the parish so that masses should be said for his soul. To his servants, not forgetting his bookbinder, Nowel, in Shoe Lane, he bequeathed books. De Worde lived near the Conduit, a little west of Shoe Lane. This conduit, which was begun in the year <datestruct value="1439"><year reg="1439">1439</year></datestruct> by Sir William Estfielde, a former Lord Mayor, and finished in <datestruct value="1471--"><year reg="1471">1471</year></datestruct>, was, according to Stow's account, a stone tower; on the top were images of St. Christopher and angels, who, on sweet-sounding bells, hourly chimed a hymn with hammers, thus anticipating the wonders of St. Dunstan's. These London conduits were great resorts for the apprentices, whom their masters sent with big leather and metal jugs to bring home the daily supply of water. Here these noisy, quarrelsome young rascals stayed to gossip, idle, and fight. At the coronation of Anne Boleyn this conduit was newly painted, all the arms and angels refreshed, and <QUOTE>the music melodiously sounding.</QUOTE> Upon the conduit was raised a tower with <num value="4">four</num> turrets, and in every turret stood <num value="1">one</num> of the cardinal virtues, promising never to leave the queen, while, to the delight and wonder of thirsty citizens, the taps ran with claret and red wine. Fleet Street, according to Mr. Noble, was supplied in the Middle Ages with water from the conduit at Marylebone and the holp wells of St. Clement's and St. Bridget's. The tradition is that the latter well was drained dry for the supply of the coronation banquet of George IV. As early as <datestruct value="1358"><year reg="1358">1358</year></datestruct> the inhabitants of Fleet Street complained of aqueduct pipes bursting and flooding their cellars, upon which they were allowed the privilege of erecting a pent-house over an aqueduct opposite the tavern of John Walworth, and near the house of the Bishop of Salisbury. In <datestruct value="1478--"><year reg="1478">1478</year></datestruct> a Fleet Street wax-chandler, having been detected tapping the conduit pipes for his own use, was sentenced to ride through the City with a vessel shaped like a conduit on his felonious head, and the City crier walking before him to proclaim his offence.
<p>The <QUOTE>Castle Tavern,</QUOTE> mentioned as early as <datestruct value="1432"><year reg="1432">1432</year></datestruct>, stood at the south-west corner of Shoe Lane. Here the Clockmakers' Company held their <pb id="p.64" n="64"> meetings before the Great Fire, and in <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct> the <QUOTE>Castle</QUOTE> possessed the largest sign-board in London. Early in the last century, says Mr. Noble; its proprietor was Alderman Sir John Task, a wine merchant, who died in <datestruct value="1735--"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct> (George II.), worth, it was understood, a quarter of a million of money.
<p>The <title>Morning Advertiser</title> (No. <num value="127">127</num>, north) was established in <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>, by the Society of Licensed Victuallers, on the mutual benefit society principle. very member is bound to take in the paper and is entitled to a share in its profits. Members unsuccessful in business become pensioners on the funds of the institution. The paper, which took the place of the <title>Daily Advertiser</title>, and was the suggestion of Mr. Grant, a master printer, was an immediate success. Down to <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct> the <title>Morning Advertiser</title> circulated chiefly in public-houses and coffee-houses at the rate of nearly <num value="5000">5,000</num> copies a day. But in <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct>, the circulation beginning to decline, the committee resolved to enlarge the paper to the size of the <title>Times</title>, and Mr. James Grant was appointed editor. The profits now increased, and the paper found its way to the clubs. The late Lord Brougham and Sir David Brewster contributed to the <title>Advertiser</title>; and the letters signed <QUOTE>An Englishman</QUOTE> excited much interest. This paper has generally been Liberal. Mr. Grant remained the editor for <num value="20">twenty</num> years : he died in <datestruct value="1879--"><year reg="1879">1879</year></datestruct>.
<p>No. <num value="91">91</num> (south side) was till lately the office of that old-established paper, <title>Bell's Weekly Messenger.</title>
Mr. Bell, the spirited publisher who founded this paper, is delightfully sketched by Leigh Hunt in his autobiography.
<p> <QUOTE>About the period of my writing the above essays,</QUOTE> he says, in his easy manner, <QUOTE>circumstances introduced me to the acquaintance of Mr. Bell, the proprietor of the <title>Weekly Messenger</title>. In his house, in the, Strand, I used to hear of politics and dramatic criticisms, and of the persons who wrote them. Mr. Bell had been well known as a bookseller and a speculator in elegant typography. It is to him the public are indebted for the small editions of the poets that preceded Cooke's. Bell was, upon the whole, a remarkable person. He was a plain man, with a red face and a nose exaggerated by intemperance; and yet there was something not unpleasing in his countenance, especially when he spoke. He had sparkling black eyes, a good-natured smile, gentlemanly manners, and <num value="1">one</num> of the most agreeable voices I ever heard. He had no acquirements-perhaps not even grammar; but his taste in putting forth a publication and getting the best artists to adorn it was new in those times, and may be admired in any. Unfortunately for Mr. Bell, the Prince of Wales, to whom he was bookseller, once did him the honour to partake of an entertainment or refreshment (I forget which-most probably the latter) at his house. He afterwards became a bankrupt. After his bankruptcy he set up a newspaper, which became profitable to everybody but himself.</QUOTE> <NOTE>An intelligent compositor (Mr. J. P. S. Bicknell), who has been a noter of curious passages in his time, informs me that Bell was the <num value="1">first</num> printer who confined the small letter <QUOTE>s</QUOTE> to its present shape,and rejected altogether the older form <QUOTE>f.</QUOTE> --W.

<p>No. <num value="93">93</num>, Fleet Street (south side) is endeared to us by its connection with Charles Lamb. At that number, in <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, that great humorist, the king of all London clerks that ever were or will be, published his <QUOTE>Elia,</QUOTE> a collection of essays immortal as the language, full of quaint and tender thoughts and gleaming with cross-lights of humour as shot silk does with interchanging colours.

 <hi rend=italics>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.64.1">London Magazine</lemma></hi> fell into the hands of Messrs. Taylor & Hessey, of No. <num value="93">93</num>; but they published the excellent periodical and gave their <QUOTE>magazine dinners</QUOTE> at their publishing house in Waterloo Place.
<p>Mr. John Scott, a man of great promise, the editor of the <title>London</title> for its <num value="1">first</num> publishers-Messrs. Baldwin, Cradock, & Joy-met with a very tragic death in <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>. The duel in which he fell arose from a quarrel between the men on the <title>London</title>
and some clever but bitter and unscrupulous writers
<hi rend=italics>in Blackwood</hi>, started in <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>. Lockhart, who had cruelly, maligned Leigh Hunt and his set (the <QUOTE>Cockney School,</QUOTE> as the Scotch Tories chose to call them), was sharply attacked in the <title>London.</title>
Fiery and vindictive, Lockhart at once rushed up to town, and angrily demanded from Mr. Scott, the editor, an explanation, an apology, or a meeting. Mr. Scott declined giving an apology unless Mr. Lockhart would <num value="1">first</num> deny that he was editor of
<title>Blackwood</title>. Lockhart refused to give this denial, and retorted by expressing a mean opinion of Mr. Scott's courage. Lockhart and Scott both printed contradictory versions of the quarrel, which continued till at last Mr. Christie, a friend of Lockhart, challenged Scott; and they met at Chalk Farm. by moonlight on <datestruct value="02-16"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=16>16th</day></datestruct>, at <num value="9">nine</num> o'clock at night, attended by their seconds and surgeons, in the old business-like, bloodthirsty way. The <num value="1">first</num> time Mr. Christie did not fire at Mr. Scott, a fact of which Mr. Patmore, the author, Scott's <num value="2">second</num>, with most blamable indiscretion, did not inform his principal. At the <num value="2">second</num> fire Christie's ball struck Scott just above the right hip, and he <pb id="p.65" n="65"> fell. He lingered till the <num value="27">27th</num>. It was said at the time that Hazlitt, perhaps unintentionally, had driven Scott to fight by indirect taunts. <QUOTE>I don't pretend,</QUOTE> Hazlitt is reported to have said, <QUOTE>to hold the principles of honour which you hold. I would neither give nor accept a challenge. You hold the opinions of the world; with you it is different. As for me, it would be nothing. I do not think as you and the world think,</QUOTE> and so on. Poor Scott, not yet <num value="40">forty</num>, had married the pretty daughter of Colnaghi, the print-seller in Pall Mall, and left <num value="2">two</num> children.
<p>For the <num value="5">five</num> years it lasted, perhaps no magazine --not even the mighty <hi rend=italics>Maga</hi> itself--ever drew talent towards it with such magnetic attraction. In Mr. Barry Cornwall's delightful memoir of his old friend Lamb, composed when the writer was in his <num value="73">seventy-third</num> year, he has summarised the writers in the <title>London</title>, and shown how deep and varied was the intellect brought to bear on its production. <num value="1">First</num> of all he mentions poor Scott, a shrewd, critical, rather hasty man, who wrote essays on Sir Walter Scott, Wordsworth, Godwin, Byron,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.65.1">Keats</lemma>, Shelley, Leigh Hunt, and Hazlitt, his wonderful contemporaries, in a fruitful age. Hazlitt, glowing and capricious, produced the <num value="12">twelve</num> essays of his <title>Table Talk,</title> many dramatic articles, and papers on Beckford's Fonthill, the Angerstein pictures, and the Elgin marbles-pages wealthy with thought. Lamb contributed in <num value="3">three</num> years all the matchless essays of <title>Elia.</title> Mr. Thomas Carlyle, then only a promising <hi rend=italics>young</hi>
Scotch philosopher, wrote several articles on the

That learned and amiable man, the Rev. H. F. Cary, the translator of Dante, wrote several interesting notices of early French poets. Allan Cunningham, the vigorous Scottish bard, sent the romantic <title>Tales of Lyddal Cross</title> and a series of papers styled <title>Traditional Literature.</title> Mr. John Poole--who died in <datestruct value="1872--"><year reg="1872">1872</year></datestruct>--(the author of
 <title>Paul Pry</title> and that humorous novel, <title>Little Pedlington,</title> which is supposed to have furnished Mr. Charles Dickens with some suggestions for
<title>Pickwick</title>) wrote burlesque imitations of contemporaneous dramatic writers-Morton, Dibdin, Reynolds, Moncrieff, &amp;c. Mr. J. H. Reynolds wrote, under the name of Henry Herbert, notices of contemporaneous events, such as a scene at the Cockpit, the trial of Thurtell, &amp;c.

<p>A fine old citizen of the last century, Joseph Brasbridge, who published his memoirs, kept a silversmith's shop at No. <num value="98">98</num>, several doors from Alderman Waithman's. At <num value="1">one</num> time Brasbridge confesses he divided his time between the tavern club, the card party, the hunt, and the fight, and left his shop to be looked after by others, whilst he decided on the respective merits of Humphries and Mendoza, Cribb and Big Ben. Among Brasbridge's early customers were the Duke of Marlborough, the Duke of Argyle, and other men of rank, and he glories in having once paid an elaborate compliment to Lady Hamilton. The most curious story in Brasbridge's <title>Fruits of Experience</title> is the following, various versions of which have been paraphrased by modern writers. A surgeon in Gough Square had purchased for dissection the body of a man who had been hanged at Tyburn. The servant girl, wishing to look at the corpse, stole upstairs in the doctor's absence, and, to her horror, found the body sitting up on the board, wondering where it was. The girl almost <pb id="p.66" n="66"> threw herself down the stairs in her fright. The surgeon, on learning of the resuscitation of his subject, humanely concealed the man in the house till he could fit him out for America. The fellow proved as clever and industrious as he was grateful, and having amassed a fortune, he eventually left it all to his benefactor. The sequel is still more curious. The surgeon dying some years after, his heirs were advertised for. A shoemaker at Islington eventually established a claim and inherited the money. Mean in prosperity, the <foreign lang=fr>ci-devant</foreign>
shoemaker then refused to pay the lawyer's bill, and, moreover, called him a rogue. The enraged lawyer replied, <QUOTE>I have put you into possession of this property by my exertions, now I will spend &pound;ioo out of my own pocket to take it away again, for you are not deserving of it.</QUOTE> The lawyer accordingly advertised again for the surgeon's nearest of kin; Mr. Willcocks, a bookseller in

 the Strand, then came forward, and deposed that his wife and her mother, he remembered, used to visit the surgeon in Gough Square. On inquiry Mrs. Willcocks was proved the next of kin, and the base shoemaker returned to his last. The lucky Mr. Willcocks was the good-natured bookseller who lent Johnson and Garrick, when they <num value="1">first</num> came up to London to seek their fortunes, <measure value="5l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5">5</num></measure> on their joint note.

Waithman, according to Mr. Timbs, had a genius for the stage, and especially shone as Macbeth. He was uncle to John Reeve, the comic actor. Cobbett, who hated Waithman, has left a portrait of the alderman, written in his usual racy English, <QUOTE>Among these <pb id="p.67" n="67"> persons,</QUOTE> he says, talking of the Princess Caroline agitation, in <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>there was a common councilman named Robert Waithman, a man who for many years had taken a conspicuous part in the politics of the City; a man not destitute of the powers of utterance, and a man of sound principles also; but a man so enveloped, so completely swallowed up by self-conceit, who, though perfectly illiterate, though unable to give to <num value="3">three</num> consecutive sentences a grammatical construction, seemed to look upon himself as the <num value="1">first</num> orator, the <num value="1">first</num> writer, and the <num value="1">first</num> statesman of the whole world.</QUOTE> According to Cobbett, Waithman, vexed that Alderman Wood had been the <num value="1">first</num> to propose an address of condolence to the Princess at the

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.68.2">Robert Waithman</lemma>

<NOTE resp=B>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.68.1">Waithman's Obelisk</lemma></NOTE> was born of humble parentage, at Wrexham, in North Wales. Becoming an orphan when only <num value="4">four</num> months old, he was placed at the school of a Mr. Moore by his uncle, on whose death, about <datestruct value="1778--"><year reg="1778">1778</year></datestruct>, he obtained a situation at Reading, whence he proceeded to London, and entered into the service of a respectable linen-draper, with whom he continued till he became of age. He then entered into business at the south end of Fleet Market, whence, some years afterwards, he removed to the corner of New Bridge Street. He appears to have commenced his political career about <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>, at the oratorical displays made in admiration and imitation of the proceedings of the French Revolutionists, at Founder's all, in Lothbury. In <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct> he brought forward a series of resolutions, at a common hall, animadverting upon the war with revolutionised France, and enforcing the necessity of a reform in Parliament. In <datestruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct> he was <num value="1">first</num> elected a member of the Common Council for the Ward of Farringdon Without, and became a very frequent speaker in that public body. It was supposed that Mr. Fox intended to have rewarded his political exertions by the place of Receiver-General of the Land Tax.

defeating the old member, Sir William Curtis.
<p>Very shortly after, on the <datestruct value="08-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, he was elected Alderman of his ward, on the death of Sir Charles Price, Bart. On the <datestruct VALUE="1819-01-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1819">1819</year></datestruct>, he made his maiden speech in Parliament, on the presentation of a petition praying for a revision of the criminal code, the existing state of which he severely censured. At the ensuing election of <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct> the friends of Sir William Curtis turned the tables upon him, Waithman being defeated. In this year, however, he attained the honour of the shrievalty; and in <datestruct VALUE="1823-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, he was chosen Lord Mayor. In <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct> he stood another contest for the City, with better success. In <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>, and <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct> he obtained his re-election with difficulty; but in <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct> he suffered a severe disappointment in losing the chamberlainship, in the competition for which Sir James Shaw obtained a large majority of votes.
<P>We subjoin the remarks made on his death by the editor of the <title>Times</title> newspaper:-- <QUOTE>The magistracy of London has been deprived of <num value="1">one</num> of its most respectable members, and the City of <num value="1">one</num> of its most upright representatives. Everybody knows that Mr. Alderman Waithman has filled a large space in City politics; and most people who were acquainted with him will be ready to admit that, had his early education been better directed, or his early circumstances more favourable to his ambition, he might have become an important man in a wider and higher sphere. His natural parts, his political integrity, his consistency of conduct, and the energy and perseverance with which he performed his duties, placed him far above the common run of persons whose reputation is gained by their oratorical displays at meetings of the Common Council. In looking back at City proceedings for the last <num value="35">thirty-five</num> or <num value="40">forty</num> years, we find him always rising above his rivals as the steady and consistent advocate of the rights of his countrymen and the liberties and privileges of his fellow-citizens.</QUOTE>
<P>There is a curious story told of the Fleet Street crossing, opposite Waithman's corner. It was swept for years by an old black man named Charles M&lsquo;Ghee, whose father had died in Jamaica at the age of <num value="108">108</num>. According to Mr. Noble, when he laid down his broom he sold his professional right for a very large sum. Retiring into private life much respected, he was always to be seen on Sundays at Rowland Hill's chapel. When in his seventythird year his portrait was taken and hung in the parlour of the <QUOTE><num value="12">Twelve</num> Bells,</QUOTE> Bride Lane. To Miss Waithman, who used to send him out soup and bread, he is, untruly, said to have left <measure value="7000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="7000">7,000</num></measure>.
<P>Mr. Diprose, in his <title>History of St. Clement,</title> tells us more of this black sweeper. <QUOTE>Brutus Billy,</QUOTE> or <QUOTE>Tim-buc-too,</QUOTE> as he was generally called, lived in a passage leading from Stanhope Street into Drury Lane. He was a short, thick-set man, with his white-grey hair carefully brushed up into a toupee, the fashion of his youth. He was found in his shop, as he called his crossing, in all weathers, and was invariably civil. At night, after he had shut up shop (swept mud over his crossing), he carried round a basket of nuts and fruit to places of public entertainment, so that in time he laid by a considerable amount of money. Brutus Billy was <pb id="p.69" n="69"> brimful of story and anecdote. He died in Chapel Court in <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>, in his <num value="87">eighty-seventh</num> year. This worthy man was perhaps the model for Billy Waters, the negro beggar in <title>Tom and Jerry</title>, who is so indignant at the beggars' supper on seeing <QUOTE>a turkey without sassenges.</QUOTE>
<p>In
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.69.1">Garrick's</lemma> time John Hardham, the wellknown tobacconist, opened a shop at No. <num value="106">106</num>. here, at the sign of the <QUOTE>Red Lion,</QUOTE> Hardham's Highlander kept steady guard at a doorway through which half the celebrities of the day made their exits and entrances. His celebrated <QUOTE>No. <num value="37">37</num></QUOTE> snuff was said, like the French millefleur, to be composed of a great number of ingredients, and Garrick in his kind way helped it into fashion by mentioning it favourably on the stage. Hardham, a native of Chichester, began life, as a servant, wrote a comedy, acted,. and at last became Garrick's <QUOTE>numberer,</QUOTE> having a general's quick
 <foreign>coup d&lsquo;oeil</foreign> at gauging an audience, and so checking the money-takers. Garrick once became his security for a <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> pounds</measure>; but eventually Hardham grew rich, and died in <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, bequeathing <measure value="22289l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="22289">22,289</num></measure> to Chichester, <num value="10">10</num> guineas to Garrick, and merely setting apart, <num value="10">10</num> for his funeral, only vain fools, as he said, spending more on such pageants. We can fancy the great actors of that day seated on Hardham's tobacco-chests discussing the drollery of Foote or the vivacity of Clive.
<p> <QUOTE>It has long been a source of inquiry,</QUOTE> says a writer in the <title>City Press</title>, <QUOTE>whence the origin of the cognomen, <Q> No. <num value="37">37</num>,</Q>  to the celebrated snuff compounded still under the name of John Hardham, in Fleet Street. There is a tradition that Lord Townshend, on being applied to by Hardham, whom he patronised, to name the snuff, suggested the cabalistic number of <num value="37">37</num>, it being the exact number of a majority obtained in some proceedings in the Irish Parliament whilst he was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and which was considered a triumph for his Government. The dates, however, do not serve this theory, as Lord Townshend was not viceroy till the years <datestruct value="1767--"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>-<num value="72">72</num>, when the snuff must have been well established in public fame, and Hardham in the last years of his life. It has already been stated elsewhere that, on the famed snuff coming out in the <num value="1">first</num> instance, David Garrick, hearing of it, called in Fleet Street, as he was wont frequently to do, and offered to bring it under the public notice in the most effectual manner, by introducing an incident in a new comedy then about to be produced by him, where he would, in his part in the play, offer another character a pinch of snuff, who would extol its excellence, whereupon Garrick arranged to continue the conversation by naming the snuff as the renowned  <Q><num value="37">37</num> of John Hardham.</Q>  But the enigma, even now, is not solved; so we will, for what it may be worth, venture our own explanation. It is well known that in most of the celebrated snuffs before the public a great variety of qualities and descriptions of tobacco, and of various ages, are introduced. Hardham, like the rest, never told his secret how the snuff was made, but left it as a heritage to his successors. It is very probable, therefore, that the mystic figures, <num value="37">37</num>, we have quoted represented the number of qualities, growths, and description of the  <Q>fragrant weed</Q>  introduced by him into his snuff, and may be regarded as a sort of appellative rebus, or conceit, founded thereon.</QUOTE> <NOTE>The real fact is, the famous snuff was merely called from the number of the drawer that held it.</NOTE>

<p>But Hardham occupied himself in other ways than in the making of snuff and of money--for the Chichester youth had now grown wealthy-and in extendinig his circle of acquaintances amongst dramatists and players he was abundantly distinguished for Christian charity; for, in the language of a contemporary writer, we find that <QUOTE>his deeds in that respect were extensive,</QUOTE> and his bounty <QUOTE>was conveyed to many of the objects of it in the most delicate manner.</QUOTE> From the same authority we find that Hardham once failed in business (we presume, as a lapidary) more creditably than he could have made a fortune by it. This spirit ofintegrity, which remained a remarkable feature in his character throughout life, induced him to be often resorted to by his wealthy patrons as trustee for the payment of their bounties to deserving objects; in many cases the patrons died before the recipients of their relief. With Hardham, however, this made no difference; the annuities once granted, although stopped by the decease of the donors, were paid ever after by Hardham so long as he lived; and his delicacy of feeling induced him even to persuade the recipients into the belief that they were still derived from the same source.
<p>No. <num value="102">102</num> (south) was opened as a shop, in <datestruct value="1719--"><year reg="1719">1719</year></datestruct>, by <num value="1">one</num> Lockyer, who called it <QUOTE>Mount Pleasant.</QUOTE> It then became a <QUOTE>saloop-house,</QUOTE> where the poor purchased a beverage made out of sassafras chips. The proprietor, who began life, as Mr. Noble says, with half-a-crown, died in <datestruct VALUE="1739-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>, worth <num value="1000">1,000</num>. Thomas Read was a later tenant.

<p>Opposite Child's Bank, and almost within sound of the jingle of its gold, once stood Shire Lane, afterwards known as Lower Serle's Place. It latterly became a dingy, disreputable defile, where lawyers' clerks and the hangers--on of the law-courts were often allured and sometimes robbed; yet it had been in its day a place of great repute. In this lane the Kit-Kat, the great club of Queen Anne's reign, held its sittings, at the <QUOTE>Cat and Fiddle,</QUOTE> the shop of a pastrycook named Christopher Kat. The house, according to local antiquaries, afterwards became the <QUOTE>Trumpet,</QUOTE> a tavern mentioned by Steele in the
 <title>Tatler</title>, and latterly known as the <QUOTE>Duke of York.</QUOTE> The Kit-Kats were originally Whig patriots, who, at the end of King William's reign, met in this outof- the-way place to devise measures to secure the Protestant succession and keep out the pestilent Stuarts. Latterly they assembled for simple enjoyment; and there have been grave disputes as to whether the club took its name from the punning sign, the <QUOTE>Cat and Kit,</QUOTE> or from the favourite pies which Christopher Kat had christened; and as this question will probably last the antiquaries another <num value="2">two</num> centuries, we leave it alone. According to some verses by Arbuthnot, the chosen friend of Pope and Swift, the question was mooted even in his time, as if the very founders of the club had forgotten. Some think that the club really began with a weekly dinner given by Jacob Tonson, the great bookseller of Gray's Inn Lane, to his chief authors and patrons. This Tonson, <num value="1">one</num> of the patriarchs of English booksellers, who published Dryden's
<title>Virgil,</title> purchased a share of Milton's works, and <num value="1">first</num> made Shakespeare's works cheap enough to be accessible to the many, was secretary to the club from the commencement. An average of thirtynine poets, wits, noblemen, and gentlemen formed the staple of the association. The noblemen were perhaps rather too numerous for that republican equality which often prevails in the best intellectual society; yet above all the dukes shine out Steele and Addison, the <num value="2">two</num> great luminaries of the club. Among the Kit-Kat dukes was the great Marlborough; among the earls the poetic Dorset, the patron of Dryden and Prior; among the lords the wise Halifax; among the baronets bluff Sir Robert Walpole. Among the poets and wits there were Congreve, the most courtly of dramatists; Garth, the poetical physician-- <QUOTE>well-natured Garth,</QUOTE> as Pope somewhat awkwardly calls him; and Vanbrugh, the writer of admirable comedies. Dryden could hardly have seriously belonged to a Whig club; Pope was inadmissible as a Catholic, and Prior as a renegade. Latterly objectionable men pushed in, worst of all, Lord Mohun, a disreputable debauchee and duellist, afterwards run through by the Duke of Hamilton in Hyde Park, the duke himself perishing in the encounter. When Mohun, in a drunken pet, broke a gilded emblem off a club chair, respectable old Tonson predicted the downfall of the society, and said with a sigh, <QUOTE>The man who would do that would cut a man's throat.</QUOTE> Sir Godfrey Kneller, the great Court painter of the reigns of William and Anne, was a member; and he painted for his friend Tonson the portraits of <num value="42">forty-two</num> gentlemen of the Kit-Kat, including Dryden, who died a year after it was started. The <num value="42">forty-two</num> portraits, painted <num value="3">three</num>-quarter size (hence called Kit-Kat), to suit the walls of Tonson's villa at Barn Elms, still exist, and are treasured by Mr. W. R. Baker, a connection of the Tonson family, at Hertingfordbury, in Hertfordshire. Among the lesser men of this distinguished club we must include Pope's friends, the <QUOTE>knowing Walsh</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>Granville the polite.</QUOTE>
<p>As at the <QUOTE>Devil,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>the tribe of Ben</QUOTE> must have often discussed the downfall of Lord Bacon, the poisoning of Overbury, the war in the Palatinate, and the murder of Buckingham; so in Shire Lane, opposite, the talk must have run on Marlborough's victories, Jacobite plots, and the South-Sea Bubble; Addison must have discussed Swift, and Steele condemned the littleness of Pope. It was the custom of this aristocratic club every year to elect some reigning beauty as a toast. To the queen of the year the gallant members wrote epigrammatic verses, which were etched with a diamond on the club glasses. The most celebrated of these toasts were the <num value="4">four</num> daughters of the Duke of Mailborough-Lady Godolphin, Lady Sunderland (generally known as <QUOTE>the Little Whig</QUOTE> ), Lady Bridgewater, and Lady Monthermer. Swift's friend, Mrs. Long, was another; and so was a niece of Sir Isaac Newton. The verses <pb id="p.71" n="71"> seem flat and dead now, like flowers found between the leaves of an old book; but in their time no doubt they had their special bloom and fragrance. The most tolerable are those written by Lord Halifax on <QUOTE>the Little Whig</QUOTE> :--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote>All nature's charms in Sunderland appear, Bright as her eyes and as her reason clear; Yet still their force, to man not safely known, Seems undiscovered to herself alone.</QUOTE>
 Yet how poor after all is this laboured compliment in comparison to a sentence of Steele's on some lady of rank whose virtues he honoured,-- <QUOTE>that even to have known hers was in itself a liberal education.</QUOTE>
<p>But few stories connected with the Kit-Kat meetings are to be dug out of books, though no doubt many snatches of the best conversation are embalmed in the <title>Spectator</title> and the <title>Tatler.</title>
Yet Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, whom Pope <num value="1">first</num> admired and then reviled, tells <num value="1">one</num> pleasant incident of her childhood that connects her with the great club.
<p><num value="1">One</num> evening when toasts were being chosen, her father, Evelyn Pierpoint, Duke of Kingston, took it into his head to nominate Lady Mary, then a child only <num value="8">eight</num> years of age. She was prettier, he vowed, than any beauty on the list. <QUOTE>You shall see her,</QUOTE> cried the duke, and instantly sent a chaise for her. Presently she came ushered in, dressed in her best, and was elected by acclamation.
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.71.1">The Whig gentlemen drank the little lady's health up-standing</lemma>, and, feasting her with sweetmeats and passing her round with kisses, at once inscribed her name with a diamond on a drinkingglass. <QUOTE>Pleasure,</QUOTE> she says, <QUOTE>was too poor a word to express my sensations. They amounted to ecstasy. Never again throughout my whole life did I pass so happy an evening.</QUOTE>
<p>It used to be said that it took so much wine to raise Addison to his best mood, that
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.71.2">Steele</lemma> generally got drunk before that golden hour arrived. Steele, that warm-hearted careless fellow in whom Thackeray so delighted, certainly shone at the Kit- Kat; and an anecdote still extant shows him to us with all his amiable weaknesses. On the night of that great Whig festival--the celebration--of King William's anniversary-Steele and Addison brought with them Dr. Hoadley, the Bishop of Bangor, and solemnly drank <QUOTE>the immortal memory.</QUOTE> Presently John Sly, an eccentric hatter and enthusiastic politician, crawled into the room on his knees, in the old Cavalier fashion, and drank the Orange toast in a tankard of foaming October.-No <num value="1">one</num> laughed at the tipsy hatter; but Steele, kindly even when in liquor, kept whispering to the rather shocked prelate, <QUOTE>Do laugh; it is humanity to laugh.</QUOTE> The bishop soon put on his hat and withdrew, and Steele by and by subsided under the table. Picked up and crammed into a sedan-chair, he insisted, late as it was, in going to the Bishop of Bangor's to apologise. Eventually he was coaxed home and went up-stairs, but then, in a gush of politeness, he insisted on seeing the chairmen out; after which he retired with self-complacency to bed. The next morning, in spite of headache the most racking, Steele sent the tolerant bishop the following exquisite couplet, which covered a multitude of such sins:--

 humour Steele sketches Sir Geoffrey Notch, the president, who had spent all his money on horses, dogs, and gamecocks, and who looked on all thriving persons as pitiful upstarts. Then comes Major Matchlock, who thought nothing of any battle since Marston Moor, and who usually began his story of Naseby at <num value="3">three</num>-quarters past <num value="6">six</num>. Dick Reptile was a silent man, with a nephew whom he often reproved. The wit of the club, an old Temple bencher, never left the room till he had quoted <num value="10">ten</num> distiches from <title>Hudibras </title> and told long stories of a certain extinct man about town named Jack Ogle. Old Reptile was extremely attentive to all that was said, though he had heard the same stories every night for <num value="20">twenty</num> years, and upon all occasions winked oracularly to his nephew particularly to mind what passed. About <num value="10">ten</num> the innocent twaddle closed by a man coming in with a lantern to light home old Bickerstaff. They were simple and happy times that Steele <pb id="p.74" n="74"> describes with such kindly humour; and the London of his days must have been full of such quiet, homely haunts.
<p>Mr. R. Hills, of Colne Park, Essex, kindly in forms us that as late as the year <datestruct value="1765"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct> there was a club that still kept up the name of Kit-Kat. The members in <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct> included, among others, Lord Sandwich (Jemmy Twitcher, as he was generally called), Mr. Beard, Lord Weymouth, Lord Bolingbroke, the Duke of Queensberry, Lord Carysfort, Mr. Cadogan, the Marquis of Caracciollo, Mr. Seymour, and Sir George Armytage. <num value="1">One</num> of the most active managers of the club was Richard Phelps (who, we believe, afterwards was secretary to Pitt). Among the letters and receipts preserved by Mr. Hills is <num value="1">one</num> from Thomas Pingo, jeweller, of the <QUOTE>Golden Head,</QUOTE> on the <QUOTE>Paved stones,</QUOTE> Gray's Inn Lane, for gold medals, probably to be worn by the members.
<p>Even in the reign of James I. Shire Lane was christened Rogues' Lane, and, in spite of all the dukes and lords of the Kit-Kat, it never grew very respectable. In <datestruct value="1724--"><year reg="1724">1724</year></datestruct> that incomparable young rascal, Jack Sheppard, used to frequent the <QUOTE>Bible</QUOTE> public-house--a printers' house of call-at No. <num value="13">13</num>. n <num value="1">one</num> of the rooms there was a trap by which Jack could drop into a subterraneous passage leading to Bell Yard. The Tyburn gibbet cured Jack of this trick. In <datestruct value="1738--"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct> the lane went from bad to worse, for there Thomas Carr (a low attorney, of Elm Court) and Elizabeth Adams robbed and murdered a gentleman named Quarrington at the <QUOTE>Angel and Crown</QUOTE> Tavern, and the miscreants were hung at Tyburn. Hogarth painted a portrait of the woman. <num value="1">One</num> night, many years ago, a man was robbed, thrown downstairs, and killed, in <num value="1">one</num> of the dens in Shire Lane. There was snow on the ground, and about <num value="2">two</num> o'clock, when the watchmen grew drowsy and were a long while between their rounds, the frightened murderers carried the stiffened body up the lane and placed it bolt upright, near a dim oil lamp, at a neighbour's door. There the watchmen found it; but there was no clue to guide them, for nearly every house in the lane was infamous. Years after, <num value="2">two</num> ruffianly fellows who were confined in the King's Bench were heard accusing each other of the murder in Shire Lane, and justice pounced upon her prey.
<p><num value="1">One</num> thieves' house, the <QUOTE>Retreat,</QUOTE> says Mr. Diprose, in his <title>St. Clement Danes,</title> led by a back way into Crown Court; other dens had a passage into the Strand. Nos. <num value="9">9</num>, <num value="10">10</num>, and <num value="11">11</num> were known as Cadgers' Hall, and were much frequented by beggars; and bushels of bread, thrown aside by the professional mendicants, were found there by the police.
<p>The <QUOTE>Sun</QUOTE> Tavern, afterwards the <QUOTE>Temple Bar Stores,</QUOTE> had been a great resort for the Tom and Jerry frolics of the Regency; and the <QUOTE>AntiGalli- can</QUOTE> Tavern was a haunt of low sporting men, being kept by Harry Lee, father of the <num value="1">first</num> and original <QUOTE>tiger,</QUOTE> invented and made fashionable by the notorious Lord Barrymore. During the Chartist times violent meetings were held at a club in hire Lane. A good story is told of <num value="1">one</num> of these. detective in disguise attended an illegal meeting, leaving his comrades ready below. All at once a frantic hatter rose, denounced the detective as a spy, and proposed off-hand to pitch him out of window. Permitted by the more peaceable to depart, the policeman scuttled downstairs as fast as he could, and, not being recognised in his disguise, was instantly knocked down by his friends' prompt truncheons.
<p>In Ship Yard, close to Shire Lane, once stood a block of disreputable, tumble-down houses, used by coiners, and known as the <QUOTE>Smashing Lumber.</QUOTE> very room had a secret trap, and from the workshop above a shaft reached the cellars to hurry away by means of a basket and pulley all the apparatus at the <num value="1">first</num> alarm. The <num value="1">first</num> man made his fortune, but the new police soon ransacked the den and broke up the business.
<P>In <datestruct VALUE="1823-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, Theodore Hook, the witty and the heartless, was brought to a sponging-house kept by a sheriff's officer named Hemp, at the upper end of Shire Lane, being under arrest for a Crown debt of <measure value="12000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="12000">12,000</num></measure> due to the Crown for defalcations during his careless treasurership at the Mauritius. He was editor of <title>John Bull</title> at the time, and continued while in this horrid den to write his <title>Sayings and Doings,</title> and to pour forth for royal pay his usual scurrilous lampoons at all who supported poor, persecuted Queen Caroline. Mr. Maginn, who had just come over from Cork to practise Toryism, was his constant visitor, and Hemp's barred door no doubt often shook at their reckless laughter. Hook at length left Shire Lane for the Rules of the Bench, Temple Place, in <datestruct VALUE="1824-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>. Previously to his arrest he had been living in retirement at lodgings in Somers' Town, with a poor girl whom he had led astray. Here he renewed the mad scenes of his thoughtless youth with Terry, Matthews, and wonderful old Tom Hill; and, here he resumed (but not at these revels) his former acquaintanceship with that mischievous obstructive, Wilson Croker. After he left Shire Lane and the Rules of the Bench he went to Putney. <pb id="p.75" n="75">
<p>In spite of all bad proclivities, Shire Lane had its fits of respectability. In <datestruct value="1603--"><year reg="1603">1603</year></datestruct> there was living there Sir Arthur Atie, Knt., in early life secretary to the great Earl of Leicester, and afterwards attendant on his step-son, the luckless Earl of Essex. Elias Ashmole, the great antiquary and student in alchemy and astrology, also honoured this lane, but he gathered in the Temple those great collections of books and coins, some of which perished by fire, and some of which he afterwards gave to the University of Oxford, where they were placed in a building called, in memory of the illustrious collector, the Ashmolean Museum.
<p>To Mr. Noble's research we are indebted for the knowledge that in <datestruct value="1767--"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct> Mr. Hoole, the translator of Tasso, was living in Shire Lane, and from thence wrote to Dr. Percy, who was collecting his <title>Ancient Ballads,</title> to ask, him Dr. Wharton's address. Hoole was at that time writing a dramatic piece called
<title>Cyrus</title>, for Covent Garden Theatre. He seems to have been an amiable man but a feeble poet, was an esteemed friend of Dr. Johnson, and had a situation in the East India House.
<p>Another illustrious tenant of Shire Lane was
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.75.1">James Perry</lemma>, the proprietor of the <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, who died, as it was reported, worth <num value="130000">130,000</num>. That lively memoir-writer, Taylor, of the <title>Sun</title>, who wrote <QUOTE>Monsieur Tonson,</QUOTE> describes Perry as living in the narrow part of Shire Lane, opposite a passage which led to the stairs from Boswell Court. He lodged with Mr. Lunan, a bookbinder, who had married his sister, who subsequently became the wife of that great Greek scholar, thirsty Dr. Porson. Perry had begun life as the editor of the <title>Gazeteer</title>, but being dismissed by a Tory proprietor, and on the
 <title>Morning Chronicle</title> being abandoned by Woodfall, some of Perry's friends bought the derelict for <measure value="22110l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="22110">22,110</num></measure>, and he and Gray, a friend of Barett, became the joint proprietors of the concern. Their printer, Mr. Lambert, lived in Shire Lane; and here the partners, too, lived for <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> years, when they removed to the corner-house of Lancaster Court, Strand.
<p>Bell Yard can boast of but few associations; yet Pope often visited the dingy passage, because there for some years resided his old friend Fortescue, then a barrister, but afterwards a judge and Master of the Rolls. To Fortescue Pope dedicated his Imitation of the <title><num value="1">First</num> Satire of Horace,</title> published in <datestruct value="1733--"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>. It contains what the late Mr. Rogers, the banker and poet, used to consider the best line Pope ever wrote, and it is certainly almost perfect,--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Bare the mean heart that lurks behind a star.</QUOTE>

<p>In that delightful collection of Pope's <title>Table Talk,</title> called <title>Spence's Anecdotes,</title> we find that a chance remark of Lord Bolingbroke, on taking up a <title>Horace</title> in Pope's sick-room, led to those fine <title>Imitations of Horace</title> which we now possess. The <title><num value="1">First</num> Satire</title> consists of an imaginary conversation between Pope and Fortescue, who advises him to write no more dangerous invectives against vice or folly. It was Fortescue who assisted Pope in writing the humorous law-report of <title>Stradling
<hi rend=italics>versus</hi> Stiles,</title> in <title>Scriblerus.</title> The intricate case is this, and is worthy of Anstey himself: Sir John Swale, of Swale's Hall, in Swale Dale, by the river Swale, knight, made his last will and testament, in which, among other bequests, was this: <QUOTE>Out of the kind love and respect that I bear my muchhonoured and good friend, Mr. Matthew Stradling, gent., I do bequeath unto the said Matthew Stradling, gent., all my black and white horses.</QUOTE> Now the testator had <num value="6">six</num> black horses, <num value="6">six</num> white, and <num value="6">six</num> pied horses. The debate, therefore, was whether the said Matthew Stradling should have the said pied horses, by virtue of the said bequest. The case, after much debate, is suddenly terminated by a motion in arrest of judgment that the pied horses were mares, and thereupon an inspection was prayed. This, it must be confessed, is admirable fooling. If the Scriblerus Club had carried out their plan of bantering the follies of the followers of every branch of knowledge, Fortescue would no doubt have selected the law as his special butt. <QUOTE>This friend of Pope,</QUOTE> says Mr. Carruthers, <QUOTE>was consulted by the poet about all his affairs, as well as those of Martha Blount, and, as may be gathered, he gave him advice without a fee. The intercourse between the poet and his learned counsel was cordial and sincere; and of the letters that passed between them <num value="68">sixty-eight</num> have been published, ranging from <datestruct value="1714--"><year reg="1714">1714</year></datestruct> to the last year of Pope's life. They are short, unaffected lettersmore truly <hi rend=italics>betters</hi> than any others in the series.</QUOTE> Fortescue was promoted to the bench of the Exchequer in <datestruct value="1735--"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>, from thence to the Common Pleas in <datestruct value="1738--"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct>, and in <datestruct value="1741--"><year reg="1741">1741</year></datestruct> was made Master of the Rolls. Pope's letters are often addressed to <QUOTE>his counsel learned in the law, at his house at the upper end of Bell Yard, near unto Lincoln's Inn.</QUOTE> In <datestruct VALUE="1736-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1736">1736</year></datestruct>, he writes of <QUOTE>that filthy old place, Bell Yard, which I want them and you to quit.</QUOTE>
<p>Apollo Court, next Bell Yard, has little about it worthy of notice beyond the fact that it derived its name from the great club-room at the <QUOTE>Devil</QUOTE> Tavern, that once stood on the opposite side of Fleet Street, and the jovialities of which we have already chronicled. <pb id="p.76" n="76">

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.76.5">Chancery</lemma>, or Chancellor's, Lane, as it was <num value="1">first</num> called, must have been a mere quagmire, or carttrack, in the reign of Edward I., for Strype tells us that at that period it had become so impassable to knight, monk, and citizen, that John Breton, Custos of London, had it barred up, to <QUOTE>hinder any harm;</QUOTE> and the Bishop of Chichester, whose house was there (now Chichester Rents), kept up the bar for <num value="10">ten</num> years; at the end of that time, on an inquisition of the annoyances of London, the bishop was proscribed at an inquest for setting up <num value="2">two</num> staples and a bar, <QUOTE>whereby men with carts and other carriages could not pass.</QUOTE> The bishop pleaded John Breton's order, and the sheriff was then commanded to remove the annoyance, and the hooded men with their carts once more cracked their whips and whistled to their horses up and down the long disused lane.
<p>Half-way up on the east side of Chancery Lane a dull archway, through which can be caught glimpses of the door of an old chapel, leads to the Rolls Court. On the site of that chapel, in the year <datestruct value="1233"><year reg="1233">1233</year></datestruct>, history tells us that Henry III. erected a Carthusian house for the maintenance of converted Jews, who there lived under a Christian governor. At a time when Norman barons were not unaccustomed to pull out a Jew's teeth, or to fry him on gridirons till he paid handsomely for his release, conversion, which secured safety from such rough practices, may not have been unfrequent. However, the converts decreasing when Edward I., after hanging <num value="280">280</num> Jews for clipping coin, banished the rest from the realm, half the property of the Jews who were hung stern Edward gave to the preachers who tried to convert the obstinate and stiff-necked generation, and half to the <QUOTE lang=la>Domus Conversorum,</QUOTE> in Chancellor's Lane. In <datestruct value="1278--"><year reg="1278">1278</year></datestruct> we find the converts calling themselves, in a letter sent to the king by John the Convert, <QUOTE lang=la>Pauperes Coelicolae Christi.</QUOTE> In the reign of Richard II. a certain converted Jew received twopence a day for life; and in the reign of Henry IV. we find the daughter of a rabbi paid by the keepers of the house of converts a penny a day for life, by special patent.
<p>Edward III., in <datestruct value="1377--"><year reg="1377">1377</year></datestruct>, broke up the Jewish almshouse in Chancellor's Lane, and annexed the house and chapel to the newly-created office of
<foreign lang=la>Custos Rotulorum</foreign>, or Keeper of the Rolls. Some of the stones which the old gaberdines have rubbed against are no doubt incorporated in the present chapel, which, however, has been so often altered, that, like the Highlandman's gun, it is <QUOTE>new stock and new barrel.</QUOTE> The <num value="1">first</num> Master of the Rolls, in <datestruct value="1377--"><year reg="1377">1377</year></datestruct>, was William Burstal; but till Thomas Cromwell, in <datestruct value="1534--"><year reg="1534">1534</year></datestruct>, the Masters of the Rolls were generally priests, and often king's chaplains.
<p>The
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.76.6">Rolls Chapel</lemma> was built, says Pennant, by
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.76.7">Inigo Jones</lemma>, in <datestruct value="1617--"><year reg="1617">1617</year></datestruct>, at a cost of <num value="2000">2,000</num>. Dr. Donne, the poet, preached the consecration sermon. <num value="1">One</num> of the monuments belonging to the earlier chapel is that of
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.76.8">Dr. John Yonge</LEMMA>, Master of the Rolls in the reign of Henry VIII. Vertue and Walpole attribute the tomb to Torregiano, Michael Angelo's contemporary and the sculptor of the tomb of Henry VII. at Westminster. The master is represented by the artist (who starved himself to death at Seville) in effigy on an altar-tomb, in a red gown and deep square cap; his hands are crossed, his face wears an expression of calm resignation and profound devotion. In a recess at the back is a head of Christ, and an angel's head appears on either side in high relief. Another monument of interest in this quiet, legal chapel is that of Sir Edward Bruce, created by James I. Baron of Kinloss. He was <num value="1">one</num> of the crafty ambassadors sent by wily James to. openly congratulate Elizabeth on the failure of the revolt of Essex, but secretly to commence a correspondence with Cecil. The place of Master of the Rolls was Bruce's reward for this useful service. The ex-master lies with his head resting on his hand, in the <QUOTE>toothache</QUOTE> attitude ridiculed by the old dramatists. His hair is short, his beard long, and he wears a long furred robe. Before him kneels a man in armour, possibly his son, Lord Kinloss, who, <num value="3">three</num> years after his father's death, perished in a most savage duel with Sir Edward Sackville.
<p>Another fine monument is that of Sir Richard Allington, of Horseheath, in Cambridgeshire, the <pb id="p.77" n="77"> brother-inlaw of Sir William Cordall, a former Master of the Rolls, who died in <datestruct value="1561--"><year reg="1561">1561</year></datestruct>.

 His wife faces him, and beneath on a tablet kneel their <num value="3">three</num> daughters. Sir Richard's charitable widow lived after his death in Holborn, in a house long known as Allington Place. Many of the past masters sleep within these walls, and amongst them Sir John Trevor, who died in <datestruct value="1717--"><year reg="1717">1717</year></datestruct> (George I.), and Sir John Strange; but the latter has not had inscribed over his bones, as Pennant remarks, the old punning epitaph,--

<p>The above-mentioned Sir John Trevor, while Speaker of the House of Commons, being denounced for bribery, was compelled himself to preside over the subsequent debate--an unparalleled disgrace. The indictment ran:--

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.77.5">Sir Richard Weston</lemma>, promised his place to a dependant, who gave him for it <measure value="6000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="6000">6,000</num></measure> down. The vexation of old Sir Julius at this arbitrary step so moved his friends, that King Charles was induced to promise Robert Caesar the next post the clerks' office that should fall vacant, and the Lord Treasurer was bound by this promise. <num value="1">One</num> day the Earl of Tullibardine, passionately pressing the treasurer about his business, was told by Sir Richard that he had quite forgotten the matter, but begged for a memorandum, that he might remind the king that very afternoon. The earl then wrote on a small bit of paper the words, <QUOTE>Remember Caesar!</QUOTE> and Sir Richard, without reading it, placed, it carefully in a little pocket, where he said he kept all the memorials <num value="1">first</num> to be transacted. Many days passed, and the ambitious treasurer forgot all about Caesar. At length <num value="1">one</num> night, changing his clothes, his servant brought him the notes and papers from his pocket, which he looked over according to his custom. Among these he found the little billet with merely the words <QUOTE>Remember Caesar!</QUOTE> and On the sight of this the arrogant yet timid courtier was utterly confounded. Turning pale, he sent <pb id="p.78" n="78">

It was decided that it must have been dropped into his hand by some secret friend, as he was on his way to the priory lodgings. Every <num value="1">one</num> agreed that some con spiracy was planned against his life by his many and mighty enemies, and that Caesar's fate might soon be his unless great precautions were taken. His friends there fore persuaded him to be at once indisposed, and not venture forth in that neighbourhood, nor to admit to an audience any but persons of undoubted affection. At night the gates were shut and barred early, and the porter solemnly enjoined not to open them to any <num value="1">one</num>, or to venture on even a moment's sleep. Some servants were sent to watch with him, and the friends sat up all night to await the event. <QUOTE>Such houses,</QUOTE> says Clarendon, who did not like the treasurer, <QUOTE>are always in the morning haunted by early suitors ;</QUOTE> but it was very late before any <num value="1">one</num> could now get admittance into the house, the porter having tasted some of the arrears of sleep which he owed to him self for his night watching, which he accounted for to his acquaintance by whispering to them <QUOTE>that his lord should have been killed that night, which had kept all the house from going to bed.</QUOTE> Shortly afterwards, however, the Earl of Tulli bardine asking the treasurer whether he had re membered Caesar, the treasurer quickly recollecting the ground of his perturbation, could not forbear imparting it to his friends, and so the whole jest came to be discovered.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.79.1">Sir Joseph Jekyll</lemma>, the Master of the Rolls in the reign of George I., was an ancestor of that witty Jekyll, the friend and adviser of George IV. Sir Joseph was very active in introducing a Bill for increasing the duty on gin, in consequence of which he became so odious to the mob that they <num value="1">one</num> day hustled and trampled on him in a riot in Lincoln's Inn Fields. Hogarth, who painted his <title>Gin Lane</title> to express his alarm and disgust at the growing intempe- France of the London poor, has in <num value="1">one</num> of his extraordinary pictures represented a low fellow writing J. J. under a gibbet.
<P>Sir William Grant, who succeeded Lord Alvanley, was the last Master but <num value="1">one</num> that resided in the Rolls. He had practised at the Canadian bar, and on returning to England attracted the attention of Lord Thurlow, then Chancellor. He was an admirable speaker in the House, and even Fox is said to have girded himself tighter for an encounter with such an adversary. <QUOTE>He used,</QUOTE> says Mr. Cyrus Jay, in his amusing book,
<title>The Law,</title> <QUOTE>to sit from <num value="5">five</num> o'clock till <num value="1">one</num>, and seldom spoke during that time. He dined before going into court, his allowance being a bottle of Madeira at dinner and a bottle of port after. He dined alone, and the unfortunate servant was expected to anticipate his master's wishes by intuition. Sir William never spoke if he could help it. On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, when the favourite dish of a leg of pork was on the table, the servant saw by Sir William's face that something was wrong, but he could not tell what. Suddenly a thought <pb id="p.80" n="80"> flashed upon him--the Madeira was not on the table. He at once placed the decanter before Sir William, who immediately flung it into the grate, exclaiming,  <Q>Mustard, you fool!</Q> </QUOTE>
<p>Sir John Leach, another Master of the Rolls, was the son of a tradesman at Bedford, afterwards a merchant's clerk and an embryo architect. Mr. Canning appointed him Master of the Rolls, an office previously, it has been said, offered to Mr. Brougham. Leach was fond, says Mr. Jay, of saying sharp, bitter things in a bland and courtly voice. <QUOTE>No submission could ameliorate his temper, no opposition lend asperity to his voice.</QUOTE> In court <num value="2">two</num> large fan shades were always placed in a way to shade him from the light, and to render Sir John entirely invisible. <QUOTE>After the counsel who was addressing the court had finished, and resumed his seat, there would be an awful pause for a minute or <num value="2">two</num>, when at length out of the darkness which surrounded the chair of justice would come a voice, distinct, awful, solemn, but with the solemnity of suppressed anger-- <Q>the bill is dismissed with costs.</Q> </QUOTE> No explanations, no long series of arguments were advanced by him to support the conclusion. The decision was given with the air of a man who knew he was right, and that only folly or villainy could doubt the propriety of his judgments. Sir John was the Prince Regent's great adviser during Queen Caroline's trial, and assisted in getting up the evidence. <QUOTE>How often,</QUOTE> says Mr. Jay, <QUOTE>have I seen him, when walking through the Green Park between <num value="4">four</num> and <num value="5">five</num> o'clock in the afternoon, knock at the private door of Carlton Palace.

<p>Gifford was another eminent Master of the Rolls, though he did not hold the office long. He <num value="1">first</num> attracted attention when a lawyer's clerk by his clever observations on a case in which he was consulted by his employers, in the presence of an important client. The high opinion which Lord Ellenborough formed of his talents induced Lord Liverpool to appoint him Solicitor-General. While in the House he had frequently to encounter Sir Samuel Romilly. Mr. Cyrus Jay has an interesting anecdote about the funeral of Lord Gifford, who is buried in the Rolls Chapel. <QUOTE>I was,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>in the little gallery when the procession came into the chapel, and Lord Eldon and Lord Chief Justice Abbott were placed in a pew by themselves. I could observe everything that took place in the pew, it being a small chapel, and noted that Lord Eldon was very shaky, and during the most solemn part of the service saw him touch the Chief Justice. I have no doubt he asked for his snuff box, for the snuff-box was produced, and he took a large pinch of snuff. The Chief Justice was a very great snuff-taker, but he only took it up <num value="1">one</num> nostril. I kept my eye on the pinch of snuff, and saw that Lord Eldon, the moment he had taken it from the box, threw it away. I was sorry at the time, and was astonished at the deception practised by so great a man, with the grave yawning before him.</QUOTE>
<p>When Sir Thomas Plumer was Master of the Rolls, and gave a succession of dinners to the Bar, Romilly, alluding to Lord Eldon's stinginess, said, <QUOTE>Verily he is working off the arrears of the Lord Chancellor.</QUOTE>
<p>At the back of the Rolls Chapel, in Bowling- Pin Alley, Bream's Buildings (No. <num value="28">28</num>, Chancery Lane), there once lived, according to party calumny, a journeyman labourer, named Thompson, whose clever and pretty daughter, the wife of <num value="1">one</num> Clark, a bricklayer, became the mischievous mistress of the good-natured but weak Duke of York. After making great scandal about the sale of commissions obtained by her influence, the shrewd woman wrote some memoirs; <num value="10000">10,000</num> copies of which were, in the next year, burnt at a printer's in Salisbury Square, upon condition of her debts being paid, and an annuity of <measure value="400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="400">400</num></measure> granted her.
<p>Wilberforce's unscrupulous party statement, that Mrs. Clark was a low, vulgar, and extravagant woman, was entirely untrue. Mrs. Clark, however imprudent and devoid of virtue, was no more the daughter of a journeyman bricklayer than she was the daughter of a king. She was really, as Mr. Cyrus Redding, who knew most of the political secrets of his day, has proved, the unfortunate granddaughter of that unfortunate man, Theodore, King of Corsica, and daughter of even a more unhappy man, Colonel Frederick, a brave, well-read gentleman, who, under the pressure of a temporary monetary difficulty, occasioned by the dishonourable conduct of a friend, blew out his brains in the churchyard of St. Margaret's, Westminster. In <datestruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct> a poem, written, we believe, by Mrs., then Miss Clark, called <title>Ianthe,</title> was published by subscription at Hookham's, in New Bond Street, for the benefit of Colonel Frederick's daughter and children, and dedicated to the Prince of Wales. The girl married an Excise officer, much older than herself, and became the mistress of the Duke of York, to whom probably she had applied for assistance, or subscriptions to her poem. The fact is, the duke's vices were turned, as vices frequently are, into scourges for his own back. He was a jovial, good-natured, affable, selfish man, an incessant and reckless gambler, quite devoid of all conscience about debts, and, indeed, of moral <pb id="p.81" n="81"> principle in general. When he got tired of Mrs. Clark, he meanly and heartlessly left her, with a promised annuity which he never paid, and with debts mutually incurred at their house in Gloucester Place, which he shamefully allowed to fall upon her. In despair and revengeful rage the discarded mistress sought the eager enemies whom the duke's careless neglect had sown round him, and the scandal broke forth. The Prince of Wales, who was as fond of his brother as he could be of any <num value="1">one</num>, was greatly vexed at the exposure, and sent Lord Moira to buy up the correspondence from the Radical bookseller, Sir Richard Phillips, who had advanced money upon it, and was glorying in the escapade.
<p>Sir Richard Phillips himself used to narrate to his friends the strange and mysterious story of the real secret cause of the Duke of York scandal. The exposure originated in the resentment of <num value="1">one</num> M&lsquo;Callum against Sir Thomas Picton, who, as Governor of Trinidad, had, among other arbitrary acts, imprisoned M&lsquo;Callum in an underground dungeon. On getting to England he sought justice; but, finding himself baffled, he <num value="1">first</num> published his travels in Trinidad, to expose Picton; then ferreted out charges against the War Office, and at last, through Colonel Wardle, brought forward the notorious great-coat contract. This being negatived by a Ministerial majority, he then traced Mrs. Clark, and arranged the whole of the exposure for Wardle and others. To effect this in the teeth of power, though destitute of resources, he wrought night and day for months. He lodged in a garret in Hungerford Market, and often did not taste food for <num value="24">twenty-four</num> hours. He lived to see the Duke of York dismissed from office, had time to publish a short narrative, then died of exhaustion and want.
<p>An eye-witness of Mrs. Clark's behaviour at the bar of the House of Commons pronounced her replies as full of sharpness against the more insolent of her adversaries, but her bearing is described as being <QUOTE>full of grace.</QUOTE> Mr. Redding, who had read <num value="20">twenty</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num> of this lady's letters, tells us that they showed a good education in the writer.
<p>A writer who was present during her examination before the House of Commons, has pleasantly described the singular scene. <QUOTE>I was,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE><p>in the House of Commons when Mary Anne Clark <num value="1">first</num> made her appearance at the bar, dressed in her light-blue pelisse, light muff and tippet. She was a pretty woman, rather of a slender make. It was debated whether she should have a chair; this occasioned a hubbub, and she was asked who the person with her deeply veiled was. She replied that she was her friend. The lady was instantly ordered to withdraw, then a chair was ordered for Mrs. Clark, and she seemed to pluck up courage, for when she was asked about the particulars of an annuity promised to be settled on her by the Duke of York, she said, pointing with her hand,  <Q>You may ask Mr. William Adam there, as he knows all about it.</Q>  She was asked if she was quite certain that General Clavering ever was at any of her parties; she replied,  <Q> So certain, that I always told him he need not use any ceremony, but come in his boots.</Q>  It will be remembered that General C. was sent to Newgate for prevarication on that account, <hi rend=italics>not having recollected in time</hi>
this circumstance.
<p>Perceval fought the battle manfully. The Duke of York could not be justified for some of his acts--for instance, giving a footboy of Mrs. Clark's a commission in the army, and allowing an improper influence to be exerted over him in his thoughtless moments; but that the trial originated in pique and party spirit, there can be no doubt; and, as he justly merited, Colonel Wardle, the prosecutor in the case, sunk into utter oblivion, whilst the Duke of York, the soldier's friend and the beloved of the army, was, after a short period  (having been superseded by Sir David Dundas), replaced as commander-in-chief, and died deeply regretted and fully meriting the colossal statue erected to him, with his hand pointing to the Horse Guards.</QUOTE>

<p>Cardinal Wolsey lived, at some period of his extraordinary career, in a house in Chancery Lane, at the Holborn end, and on the east side, near the <num value="6">Six</num> Clerks' Office. We do not know what rank the proud favourite held at this time, whether he was almoner to the king, privy councillor, Canon of Windsor, Bishop of Lincoln, Archbishop of York, or Cardinal of the Cecilia. We like to think that down that dingy legal lane
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.82.7">he rode on his way to Westminster Hall</LEMMA>, with all that magnificence described by his faithful gentleman usher, Cavendish. He would come out of his chamber, we read, about <num value="8">eight</num> o'clock in his cardinal's robes of scarlet taffeta and crimson satin, with a black velvet tippet edged with sable round his neck, holding in his hand an orange filled with a sponge containing aromatic vinegar, in case the crowd of suitors should incommode him. Before him were borne the broad seal of England, and the scarlet cardinal's hat. A sergeant-at-arms preceded him bearing a great mace of silver, and <num value="2">two</num> gentlemen carrying silver plates. At the hall-door he mounted his mule, trapped with crimson and having a saddle covered with <pb id="p.82" n="82"> crimson velvet, while the gentlemen ushers, bareheaded, cried,-- <QUOTE>On, masters, before, and make room for my lord cardinal.</QUOTE> When
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.82.1">Wolsey</lemma> was mounted he was preceded by his <num value="2">two</num> cross-bearers and his <num value="2">two</num> pillow-bearers, all upon horses trapped in scarlet ; and <num value="4">four</num> footmen with pole-axes guarded the cardinal till he came to Westminster. And every Sunday, when he repaired to the king's court at Greenwich, he landed at the <num value="3">Three</num> Cranes, in the Vintry, and took water again at Billingsgate. <QUOTE>He had,</QUOTE> says Cavendish, <QUOTE>a long season, ruling all things in the realm appertaining to the king, by his wisdom, and all other matters of foreign regions with whom the king had any occasion to meddle, and then he fell like Lucifer, never to rise again.

At <num value="1">first</num> an enemy of Buckingham, the king's favourite, and opposed to the Court, he was won over by a peerage and the counsels of his friend Lord Treasurer Weston.

Of all his passions his pride was most predominant, which a moderate exercise of ill fortune might have corrected and reformed; and which was by the hand of Heaven strangely punished by bringing his destruction on him by <num value="2">two</num> things that he most despised--the people and Sir Harry Vane.

Yet we imagine that at this time the honest citizen often sallied forth to the Lea banks with his friends, the Roes, on those fine cool May mornings upon which he expatiates so pleasantly. A quiet man and a lover of peace was old Izaak; and we may be sure no jingle of money ever hurried him back from the green fields where the lark, singing as she ascended higher and higher into the air, and nearer to the heavens, excelled, as he says, in her simple piety <QUOTE>all those little nimble musicians of the air (her fellows) who warble forth their various ditties with which Nature has furnished them, to the shame of art.</QUOTE> Refreshed and exhilarated by the pure country air, we can fancy Walton returning homeward to his Chancery Lane shop, humming to himself that fine old song of Marlowe's which the

<p>North, in his life of that faithful courtier of Charles II., Lord Keeper Guildford, mentions that his lordship <QUOTE>settled himself in the great brick house in Serjeants' Inn, near Chancery Lane, which <pb id="p.83" n="83"> was formerly the Lord Chief Justice Hyde's, and that he held it till he had the Great Seal, and some time after.

His friends he enjoyed at home, and politic ones often found him out at his chambers.</QUOTE> He rebuilt Serjeants' Inn Hall, which had become poor and ruinous, and improved all the dwellings in Chancery Lane from Jackanapes Alley down to Fleet Street. He also drained the street for the <num value="1">first</num> time, and had a rate levied on the unwilling inhabitants, after which his at <num value="1">first</num> reluctant neighbours thanked him warmly. This same Lord Keeper, a time-server and friend of arbitrary power, according to Burnet, seems to have been a learned and studious man, for he encouraged the sale of barometers and wrote a philosophical essay on music. It was this timid courtier that unscrupulous Jeffreys vexed by spreading a <hi rend=italics>report</hi> that he had been seen riding on a rhinoceros, then <num value="1">one</num> of the great sights of London.

This untoward but remarkably gifted man, whom <pb id="p.85" n="85"> Lamb admired, if he did not love, and whom Leigh Hunt regarded as a spirit highly endowed, usually spent his evenings at the  <Q>Southampton,</Q>  an hotel or coffee-house on the left hand, near the Patent Office.

<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.85.1">Hazlitt</LEMMA>, his hand still warm with the grip of Lamb, has often entered it. In an essay on  <Q>Coffee-House Politicians,</Q>  in the <num value="2">second</num> volume of his  <Q>Table Talk,</Q>  Hazlitt has sketched the coterie at the  <Q>Southampton</Q>  in a manner not unworthy of Steele. The picture wants Sir Richard's mellow, Jan Steen colour, but it possesses much of Wilkie's dainty touch and keen appreciation of character. Let us call up, he says, the old customers at the  <Q>Southampton</Q>  from the dead, and take a glass with them. <num value="1">First</num> of all comes Mr. George Kirkpatrick, so much

 admired by William, the sleek, neat waiter (who had a music-master to teach him the flageolet <num value="2">two</num> hours every morning before the maids were up), for his temper in managing an argument. Mr. Kirkpatrick was <num value="1">one</num> or those bland, simpering, self-complacent men, who, unshakable from the high tower of their own self-satisfaction, look down upon your arguments from their magnificent elevation.  <Q> I will explain,</Q>  was his condescending phrase. If you corrected the intolerable magnifico, he corrected your correction; if you hinted at an obvious blunder, he was always aware what your mistaken objection would be. He and his clique would spend a whole evening on a wager as to whether the <num value="1">first</num> edition of Dr. Johnson's  <Q>Dictionary</Q>  was quarto or folio. The confident assertions, the cautious ventures, the length of time demanded to ascertain the fact, the precise terms of the forfeit, the provisoes for getting out of paying it at last, led to a long and inextricable <pb id="p.86" n="86"> discussion. Kirkpatrick's vanity, however, <num value="1">one</num> night led him into a terrible pitfall. He recklessly ventured money on the fact that <title>The Mourning Bride</title> was written by Shakespeare; headlong he fell, and ruefully he partook of the bowl of punch for which he had to pay. As a rule his nightly outlay seldom exceeded sevenpence. <num value="4">Four</num> hours' good conversation for sevenpence made the  <Q>Southampton</Q>  the cheapest of London clubs.
<p>Kirkpatrick's brother Roger was the Mercutio to his Shallow. Roger was a rare fellow,  <Q>of the driest humour and the nicest tact, of infinite sleights and evasions, of a picked phraseology, and the very soul of mimicry.</Q>  He had the mind of a harlequin; his wit was acrobatic, and threw somersaults. He took in a character at a glance, and threw a pun at you as dexterously as a fly-fisher casts his fly over a trout's nose. <Q>How finely,</Q>
says Hazlitt, in his best and heartiest mood; <Q>how finely, how truly, how gaily he took off the company at the <QUOTE>Southampton</QUOTE>! Poor and faint are my sketches compared to his! It was like looking into a camera-obscura-you saw faces shining and speaking. The smoke curled, the lights dazzled, the oak wainscoting took a higher polish. There was old S., tall and gaunt, with his couplet from Pope and case at <foreign lang=la>Nisi Prius</foreign>; Mudford, eyeing the ventilator and lying perdu for a moral; and H. and A. taking another friendly finishing glass. These and many more windfalls of character he gave us in thought, word, and action. I remember his once describing <num value="3">three</num> different persons together to myself and Martin Burney [a bibulous nephew of Madame d&lsquo;Arblay and a great friend of Charles Lamb], namely, the manager of a country theatre, a tragic and a comic performer, till we were ready to tumble on the floor with laughing at the oddity of their humours, and at Roger's extraordinary powers of ventriloquism, bodily and mental; and Burney said (such was the vividness of the scene) that when he awoke the next morning he wondered what <num value="3">three</num> amusing characters he had been in company with the evening before.</Q> He was fond also of imitating old Mudford, of the <title>Courier</title>, a man of letters, who had left the <title>Morning Chronicle</title>
in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, just as Hazlitt joined it, and was renowned for having written a reply to  <QUOTE> Coelebs.</QUOTE>  He would enter a room, fold up his great-coat, take out a little pocket volume, lay it down to think, rubbing all the time the fleshy calf of his leg with dull gravity and intense and stolid self-complacency, and start out of his reveries when addressed with the same inimitable vapid exclamation of  <QUOTE>Eh!</QUOTE>  Dr. Whittle, a large, plain-faced Moravian preacher, who had turned physician, was another of his chosen impersonations. Roger represented the honest, vain, empty man purchasing an ounce of tea by stratagem to astonish a favoured guest; he portrayed him on the summit of a narrow, winding, and very steep staircase, contemplating in airy security the imaginary approach of duns. This worthy doctor on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, when watching Sarratt, the great chess-player, turned suddenly to Hazlitt, and said,  <QUOTE>I think I could dance. I'm sure I could; aye, I could dance like Vestris.</QUOTE>  Such were the odd people Roger caricatured on the memorable night he pulled off his coat to eat beef-steaks on equal terms with Martin Burney.
<p>Then there was C., who, from his slender neck, shrillness of voice, and his ever-ready quibble and laugh at himself, was for some time taken for a lawyer, with which folk the Buildings were then, as now, much infested. But on careful inquiry he turned out to be a patent-medicine seller, who at leisure moments had studied Blackstone and the statutes at large from mere sympathy with the neighbourhood. E. came next, a rich tradesman, Tory in grain, and an everlasting babbler on the strong side of politics; querulous, dictatorial, and with a peevish whine in his voice like a beaten schoolboy. He was a stout advocate for the Bourbons and the National Debt, and was duly disliked by Hazlitt, we may feel assured. The Bourbons he affirmed to be the choice of the French people, the Debt necessary to the salvation of these kingdoms. To a little inoffensive man,  <QUOTE>of a saturnine aspect but simple conceptions,</QUOTE>  Hazlitt once heard him say grandly,  <QUOTE> I will tell you, sir. I will make my proposition so clear that you will be convinced of the truth of my observation in a moment. Consider, sir, the number of trades that would be thrown out of employ if the Debt were done away with. What would become of the porcelain manufacture without it?</QUOTE>  He would then show the company a flower, the production of his own garden, calling it a unique and curious exotic, and hold forth on his carnations, his country-house, and his old English hospitality, though he never invited a friend to come down to a Sunday's dinner. Mean and ostentatious, insolent and servile, he did not know whether to treat those he conversed with as if they were his porters or his customers. The &lsquo;prentice boy was not yet ground out of him, and his imagination hovered between his grand new country mansion and the workhouse. Opposed to him and every <num value="1">one</num> else was K., a Radical reformer and tedious logician, who wanted to make short work of the taxes and National Debt, reconstruct the Government from <num value="1">first</num> principles, and shatter the Holy Alliance at a blow. He was for <pb id="p.87" n="87"> crushing out the future prospects of society as with a machine, and for starting where the French Revolution had begun <num value="5">five</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num> years before. He was a born disturber, and never agreed to more than half a proposition at a time. Being very stingy, he generally brought a bunch of radishes with him for economy, and would give a penny to a band of musicians at the door, observing that he liked their performance better than all the opera-squalling. His objections to the National Debt arose from motives of personal economy; and he objected to Mr. Canning's pension because it took a farthing a year out of his own pocket.

<p>Another great sachem at the  <QUOTE>Southampton</QUOTE>  was Mr. George Mouncey, of the firm of Mouncey & Gray, solicitors, Staple's Inn.  <QUOTE>He was,</QUOTE>  says Hazlitt,  <QUOTE>the oldest frequenter of the place and the latest sitter-up; well-informed, unobtrusive, and that sturdy old English character, a lover of truth and justice. Mouncey never approved of anything unfair or illiberal, and, though good-natured and gentleman-like, never let an absurd or unjust proposition pass him without expressing dissent.</QUOTE>  He was much liked by Hazlitt, for they had mutual friends, and Mouncey had been intimate with most of the wits and men about town for <num value="20">twenty</num> years before.  <QUOTE>He had in his time known Tobin, Wordsworth, Porson, Wilson, Paley, and Erskine. He would speak of Paley's pleasantry and unassuming manners, and describe Porson's deep potations and long quotations at the Cider Cellars.</QUOTE>  Warming with his theme, Hazlitt goes on in his essay to etch <num value="1">one</num> memorable evening at the  <QUOTE>Southampton.</QUOTE>  A few only were left, like stars at break of day, <QUOTE> the discourse and the ale were growing sweeter; but Mouncey, Hazlitt, and a man named Wells, alone remained. The conversation turned on the frail beauties of Charles II.'s Court, and from thence passed to Count Grammont, their gallant, gay, and not over-scrupulous historian. Each <num value="1">one</num> cited his favourite passage in turn; from Jacob Hall, the rope-dancer, they progressed by pleasant stages of talk to pale Miss Churchill and her fortunate fall from her horse. Wells then spoke of <title>Apuleius and his Golden Ass</title>, <title>Cupid and Psyche</title>, and the romance of
<title>Heliodorus, Theogenes, and Chariclea</title>, which, as he affirmed, opened with a pastoral landscape equal to <num value="1">one</num> of Claude's. </QUOTE>  The night waned, <QUOTE> says the delightful essayist, </QUOTE> but our glasses brightened, enriched with the pearls of Grecian story. Our cup-bearer slept in a corner of the room, like another Endymion, in the pale rays of a halfextinguished lamp, and, starting up at a fresh summons for a further supply, he swore it was too late, and was inexorable to entreaty. Mouncey sat with his hat on and a hectic flush in his face while any hope remained, but as soon as we rose to go, he dashed out of the room as quick as lightning, determined not to be the last. I said some time after to the waiter that  <QUOTE>Mr. Mouncey was no flincher.</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>Oh, sir!</QUOTE>  says he,  <QUOTE>you should have known him formerly. Now he is quite another man: he seldom stays later than <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num>; then he used to help sing catches, and all sorts.</QUOTE>
<p>It was at the  <QUOTE>Southampton</QUOTE>  that George Cruikshank, Hazlitt, and Hone used to often meet, to discuss subjects for Hone's squibs on the Queen's trial (<datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>). Cruikshank would sometimes dip his finger in ale and sketch a suggestion on the table.
<p>While living in a state of half-assumed lovefrenzy at No. <num value="9">9</num>, Southampton buildings, Hazlitt produced some of his best work. His noble lectures on the age of Elizabeth had just been delivered, and he was writing for the <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, the <title>New Monthly</title>, and the <title>London Magazine</title>, in conjunction with Charles Lamb, Reynolds, Barry Cornwall, De Quincey, and Wainwright ( <QUOTE>Janus Weathercock</QUOTE> ) the poisoner. In <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct> he published his volume of  <QUOTE> Dramatic Criticisms,</QUOTE>  and his subtle  <QUOTE>Table Talk;</QUOTE>  in <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, his foolish

<p>Hazlitt, who was born in <datestruct value="1778--"><year reg="1778">1778</year></datestruct> and died in <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, was the son of a Unitarian minister of Irish descent. Hazlitt was at <num value="1">first</num> intended for an artist, but, coming to London, soon drifted into literature. He became a parliamentary reporter to the <title>Morning Chronicle</title> in <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, and in that wearing occupation injured his naturally weak digestion. In <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct> he succeeded Mudford as theatrical critic on Perry's paper. In <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct> he joined the <title>Champion</title>, and in <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct> wrote for the <title>Yellow Dwarf</title> Hazlitt's habits at No. <num value="9">9</num> were enough to have killed a rhinoceros. He sat up half the night, and rose about <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num>. He then remained drinking the strongest black tea, nibbling a roll, and reading (no appetite, of course) till about <measure value="5d." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> p.</measure>m. At supper at the  <QUOTE>Southampton,</QUOTE>  his jaded stomach then rousing, he ate a heavy meal of steak or game, frequently drinking during his long and suicidal vigils <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> quarts of water. Wine and spirits he latterly never touched. Morbidly self-conscious, touchy, morose, he believed that his aspect and manner were strange and disagreeable to his friends, and that every <num value="1">one</num> was perpetually insulting him. He had a magnificent forehead, regular features, pale as marble, and a profusion of curly black hair, but his eyes were shy and suspicious. His manner when not at his ease Mr. P. G. Patmore describes <pb id="p.88" n="88"> as worthy of Apemantus himself. He would enter a room as if he had been brought in in custody. He shuffled sidelong to the nearest chair, sat down on the extreme corner of it, dropped his hat on the floor, buried his chin in his stock, vented his usual pet phrase on such occasions,  <QUOTE> It's a fine day,</QUOTE>  and resigned himself moodily to social misery. If the talk did not suit him, he bore it a certain time, silent, self-absorbed, as a man condemned to death, then suddenly, with a brusque  <QUOTE>Well, good morning,</QUOTE>  shuffled to the door and blundered his way out, audibly cursing himself for his folly in voluntarily making himself the laughing-stock of an idiot's critical servants.

<p>That delightful humorist, Lamb, lived in Southampton Buildings, in <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>, coming from Pentonville, and moving to Mitre Court Buildings, Fleet Street. Here, then, must have taken place some of those enjoyable evenings which have been so pleasantly sketched by Hazlitt, <num value="1">one</num> of the most favoured of Lamb's guests:--
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>At Lamb's we used to have lively skirmishes, at the Thursday evening parties. I doubt whether the small-coal man's musical parties could exceed them. Oh, for the pen of John Buncle to consecrate a <hi rend=italics>petit souvenir</hi> to their memory! There was Lamb himself, the most delightful, the most provoking, the most witty, and the most sensible of men. He always made the best pun and the best remark in the course of the evening. His serious conversation, like his serious writing, is the best. No <num value="1">one</num> ever stammered out such fine, piquant, deep, eloquent things, in half-a-dozen sentences, as he does. His jests scald like tears, and he probes a question with a play upon words. What a keenlaughing, hair-brained vein of home-felt truth! What choice venom! How often did we cut into the haunch of letters! how we skimmed the cream of criticism! How we picked out the marrow of authors! Need I go over the names? They were but the old, everlasting set-Milton and Shakespeare, Pope and Dryden, Steele and Addison, Swift and Gay, Fielding, Smollet, Sterne, Richardson, Hogarth's prints, Claude's landscapes, the Cartoons at Hampton Court, and all those things that, having once been, must ever be. The Scotch novels had not then been heard of, so we said nothing about them. In general we were hard upon the moderns. The author of the <title>Rambler</title>
was only tolerated in Boswell's life of him; and it was as much as anyone could do to edge in a word for Junius. Lamb could not bear  <Q>Gil Blas;</Q>  this was a fault. I remember the greatest triumph I ever had was in persuading him, after some years' difficulty, that Fielding was better than Smollett. On <num value="1">one</num> occasion he was for making out a list of persons famous in history that <num value="1">one</num> would wish to see again, at the head of whom were Pontius Pilate, Sir Thomas Browne, and Dr. Faustus; but we black-balled most of his list. But with what a gusto he would describe his favourite authors, Donne or Sir Philip Sidney, and call their most crabbed passages <hi rend=italics>delicious</hi>. He tried them on his palate, as epicures taste olives, and his observations had a smack in them like a roughness on the tongue. With what discrimination he hinted a defect in what he admired most, as in saying the display of the sumptuous banquet in  <Q> Paradise Regained</Q>  was not in true keeping, as the simplest fare was all that was necessary to tempt the extremity of hunger, and stating that Adam and Eve, in  <Q>Paradise Lost,</Q>  were too much like married people. He has furnished many a text for Coleridge to preach upon. There was no fuss or cant about him; nor were his sweets or sours ever diluted with <num value="1">one</num> particle of affectation.</QUOTE>

<p>Towards the unhappy close of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.88.1">Sheridan's</lemma> life, when weighed down by illness and debt, having just lost the election at Stafford, and the clouds and darkness gathering closer round him, he was thrown for several days (about <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>) into a sponginghouse in Tooke's Court, Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane. Tom Moore describes meeting him shortly before with Lord Byron, at the table of Rogers; and some days after Sheridan burst into tears on hearing that Byron had said that he (Sheridan) had written the best comedy, the best operetta, the best farce, the best address, and delivered the best oration ever produced in England. Sheridan's books and pictures had been sold; and from his sordid prison he wrote a piteous letter to his kind but severely business-like friend, Whitbread, the brewer. <QUOTE>I have done everything,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>to obtain my release, but in vain; and, Whitbread, putting all false professions of friendship and feeling out of the question, you have no right to keep me here, for it is in truth your act; if you had not forcibly withheld from me the <measure value="12000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="12000">12,000</num></measure>, in consequence of a letter from a miserable swindler, whose claim you in particular know to be a lie, I should at least have been out of the reach of this miserable insult; for that, and that only, lost me my seat in Parliament.</QUOTE>
<p>Even in the depths of this den, however, Sheridan still remained sanguine; and when Whitbread came to release him, he found him confidently calculating on the representation of Westminster, then about to become vacant by the unjust disgrace of Lord Cochrane. On his return home to his wife, <pb id="p.89" n="89"> fortified perhaps by wine, Sheridan burst into along and passionate fit of weeping, at the profanation, as he termed it, which his person had suffered.
<p>In
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.89.1">Lord Eldon's</lemma> youth, when he was simply plain
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.89.3">John Scott</LEMMA>, the Northern Circuit, he lived with the pretty little wife with whom he had run away, in very frugal and humble lodgings in Cursitor Street, just opposite No. <num value="2">2</num>, the chained and barred door of Sloman's sponging-house, on the northern side. Here, in after life he used to boast, although his struggles had really been very few, that he used to run out into Clare Market for sixpennyworth of sprats.
<p>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.89.2">Mr. Disraeli</lemma>, in <title>Henrietta Temple,</title> an early novel written in the Theodore Hook manner, has sketched Sloman's with a remarkable <hi rend=italics>verve</hi> and intimate knowledge of the place:--
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>In pursuance of this suggestion, Captain Armine was ushered into the best drawing-room with barred windows and treated in the most aristocratic manner. It was evidently the chamber reserved only for unfortunate gentlemen of the utmost distinction; it was simply furnished with a mirror, a loo-table, and a very hard sofa. The walls were hung with old-fashioned caricatures by Bunbury; the fire-irons were of polished brass; over the mantelpiece was the portrait of the master of the house, which was evidently a speaking likeness, and in which Captain Armine fancied he traced no slight resemblance to his friend Mr. Levison; and there were also some sources of literary amusement in the room, in the shape of a Hebrew Bible and the Racing Calendar.
<p>After walking up and down the room for an hour, meditating over the past--for it seemed hopeless to trouble himself any further with the future --Ferdinand began to feel very faint, for it may be recollected that he had not even breakfasted o, pulling the bell-rope with such force that it fell to the ground, a funny little waiter immediately appeared, awed by the sovereign ring, and having indeed received private intelligence from the bailiff that the gentleman in the drawing-room was a regular nob.
<p>And here, perhaps, I should remind the reader that of all the great distinctions in life none, perhaps, is more important than that which divides mankind into the <num value="2">two</num> great sections of <hi rend=italics>nobs</hi> and
 <hi rend=italics>snobs</hi>. It might seem at the <num value="1">first</num> glance that if there were a place in the world which should level all distinctions, it would be a debtors' prison; but this would be quite an error. Almost at the very moment that Captain Armine arrived at his sorrowful hotel, a poor devil of a tradesman, who had been arrested for <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> pounds</measure> and torn from his wife and family, had been forced to retire to the same asylum. He was introduced into what is styled the coffee-room, being a long, low, unfurnished, sanded chamber, with a table and benches; and being very anxious to communicate with some friend, in order, if possible, to effect his release, and prevent himself from being a bankrupt, he had continued meekly to ring at intervals for the last half-hour, in order that he might write and forward his letter. The waiter heard the coffee-room bell ring, but never dreamed of noticing it; though the moment the signal of the private room sounded, and sounded with so much emphasis, he rushed upstairs <num value="3">three</num> steps at a time, and instantly appeared before our hero; and all this difference was occasioned by the simple circumstance that Captain Armine was a <hi rend=italics>nob</hi>, and the poor tradesman a <hi rend=italics>snob.</hi>

<p> <Q>I am hungry,</Q>  said Ferdinand.  <Q>Can I get anything to eat at this place? </Q>
<p> <Q>What would you like, sir? Anything you choose, sir-mutton chop, rump steak, weal cutlet? Do you a fowl in a quarter of an hour-roast or boiled, sir?</Q>
<p> <Q>I have not breakfasted yet; bring me some breakfast</Q>
<p> <Q>Yes, sir,</Q>  said the waiter.  <Q>Tea, sir? coffee, eggs, toast, buttered toast, sir? Like any meat, sir? ham, sir? tongue, sir? Like a devil, sir?</Q>
<p> <Q>Anything-everything; only be quick.</Q>
<p> <Q>Yes, sir,</Q>  responded the waiter.  <Q>Beg pardon, sir. No offence, I hope; but custom to pay here, sir. Shall be happy tp accommodate you, sir. Know what a gentleman is.</Q>
<p> <Q>Thank you, I will not trouble you,</Q>  said Ferdinand.  <Q>Get me that note changed.</Q>
<P> <Q>Yes, sir,</Q>  replied the little waiter, bowing very low, as he disappeared.
<p> <Q>Gentleman in best drawing-room wants breakfast. Gentleman in best drawing-room wants change for a <num value="10">ten</num>-pound note. Breakfast immediately for gentleman in best drawing-room. Tea, coffee, toast, ham, tongue, and a devil. A regular nob!</Q> </QUOTE>

<p>Sloman's has been sketched both by Mr. Disraeli and by Thackeray. In <title>Vanity Fair</title>
we find it described as the temporary abode of the impecunious Colonel Crawley, and Moss describes his uncomfortable past and present guests in a manner worthy of Fielding himself.

<p>The Law Institute, that Grecian temple which has wedged itself into the south-west end of Chancery Lane, was built in the stormy year of <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>. On the Lord Mayor's day that year there was a riot; the Reform Bill was still pending, and it was feared might not pass, for the Lords were foaming at the mouth. The Iron Duke was detested as an opposer of all change, good or bad; the new police were distasteful to the people; above all, there was no Lord Mayor's show, and no men in brass armour to look at. The rioters assembled outside No. <num value="62">62</num>, Fleet Street, were there harangued by some dirty-faced demagogue, and <pb id="p.91" n="91">

At Temple Bar the zealous new Police slammed the old muddy gates, to stop the threatening mob; but the City Marshal, red in the face at this breach of City privilege, re-opened them, and the mob roared approval from a <num value="1000">thousand</num> distorted mouths. The more pugnacious reformers now broke the scaffolding at the Law Institute into dangerous cudgels, and some <num value="300">300</num> of the unwashed patriots dashed through the Bar towards Somerset House, full of vague notions of riot, and perhaps (delicious thought!) of plunder. But at St. Mary's, Commissioner Mayne and his men in the blue tailcoats received the roughs in battle array, and at the <num value="1">first</num> charge the coward mob broke and fled.
<p>In <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>, No. <num value="68">68</num>, Chancery Lane, not far from the north-east corner, was the scene of an event which terminated in the legal murder of a young and innocent girl. It was here, at Olibar Turner's, a law stationer's, that Eliza Fenning lived, whom we have already mentioned when we entered Hone's shop, in Fleet Street.

The trial took place at the Old Bailey on <datestruct value="04-11"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=11>11th</day></datestruct> of the same year and Mr. Gurney conducted the prosecution before that rough, violent, unfeeling man, Sir John Sylvester (<hi rend=italics>alias</hi> Black Jack), Recorder of London, who, it is said, used to call the calendar <QUOTE>a bill of fare.</QUOTE> The arsenic for rats, kept in a drawer by Mr. Turner, had been mixed with the dough of some yeast dumplings, of which all the family, including the poor servant, freely partook. There was no evidence of malice, no suspicion of any ill-will, except that Mrs. Turner had once scolded the girl for being free with <num value="1">one</num> of the clerks. It was, moreover, remembered that the girl had particularly pressed her mistress to let her make some yeast dumplings on the day in question. The defence was shamefully conducted. No <num value="1">one</num> pressed the fact of the girl having left the dough in the kitchen for some time untended; nor was weight laid on the fact of Eliza Fenning's own danger and sufferings. All the poor, half-paralysed, Irish girl could say was, <QUOTE>I am truly innocent of the whole charge-indeed I am. I liked my place. I was very comfortable</QUOTE> And there was pathos in those simple, stammering words, more than in half the self-conscious diffuseness of tragic poetry. In her white bridal dress (the cap she had joyfully worked for herself) she went to her cruel death, still repeating the words, <QUOTE>I am innocent.</QUOTE> The funeral, at St. George the Martyr, was attended by <num value="10000">10,000</num> people. Curran used to declaim eloquently on her unhappy fate, and Mr. Charles Phillips wrote a glowing rhapsody on this victim of legal dulness. But such mistakes not even Justice herself can correct. A city mourned over her early grave; but the life was taken, and there was no redress. Gadsden, the clerk, whom she had warned not to eat any dumpling, as it was heavy (this was thought, suspicious), afterwards became a wealthy solicitor in Bedford Row.

<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.92.1">Clifford's Inn</LEMMA>, originally a town house of the Lords Clifford, ancestors of the Earls of Cumberland, given to them by Edward II., was <num value="1">first</num> let to the students of law in the eighteenth year of King Edward III., at a time when might was too often right, and hard knocks decided legal questions oftener than deed or statute. Harrison the regicide was in youth clerk to an attorney in Clifford's Inn, but when the Civil War broke out he rode off and joined the Puritan troopers.
<p>Clifford's Inn is the oldest Inn in Chancery. There was formerly, we learn from Mr. Jay, an office there, out of which were issued writs, called
<title>Bills of Middlesex,</title> the appointment of which office was in the gift of the senior judge of the Queen's Bench. <QUOTE>But what made this Inn once noted was that all the <num value="6">six</num> attorneys of the Marshalsea Court (better known as the Palace Court) had their chambers there, as also had the satellites, who paid so much per year for using their names and looking at the nature of their practice. I should say that more misery emanated from this small spot than from any <num value="1">one</num> of the most populous counties in England. The causes in this court <pb id="p.93" n="93"> were obliged to be tried in the city of Westminster, near the Palace, and it was a melancholy sight (except to lawyers) to observe in the court the crowd of every description of persons suing <num value="1">one</num> another. The most remarkable man in the court was the extremely fat prothonotary, Mr. Hewlett, who sat under the judge or the judge's deputy, with a wig on his head like a thrush's nest, and with only <num value="1">one</num> book before him, which was <num value="1">one</num> of the volumes of  <Q>Burns' Justice.</Q>  I knew a respectable gentleman (Mr. G. Dyer) who resided here in chambers (where he died) over a firm of Marshalsea attorneys. This gentleman, who wrote a history of Cambridge University and a biography of Robinson of Cambridge, had been a Bluecoat boy, went as a Grecian to Cambridge, and, after the University, visited almost every celebrated library in Europe. It often struck me what a mighty difference there was between what was going on in the <num value="1">one</num> set of chambers and the other underneath. At Mr. Dyer's I have seen Sir Walter Scott, Southey,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.93.2">Coleridge</lemma>, Lamb, Talfourd, and many other celebrated literati,  <Q>all benefiting by hearing, which was but of little advantage to the owner.</Q>  In the lawyers' chambers below were people wrangling, swearing, and shouting, and some, too, even fighting, the only relief to which was the eternal stamping of cognovits, bound in a book as large as a family Bible.</QUOTE> The Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Lord Chelmsford both at <num value="1">one</num> time practised in the County Court, purchased their situations for large sums, and afterwards sold them. <QUOTE>It was not a bad nursery for a young barrister, as he had an opportunity of addressing a jury. There were only <num value="4">four</num> counsel who had a right to practise in this court, and if you took a <num value="1">first</num>-rate advocate in there specially, you were obliged to give briefs to <num value="2">two</num> of the privileged <num value="4">four</num>. On the tombstone of <num value="1">one</num> of the compensated Marshalsea attorneys is cut the bitterly ironical epitaph,  <Q>Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.</Q> </QUOTE>
<p>The George Dyer mentioned by Mr. Jay was not the author of <title>The Fleece,</title> but that eccentric and amiable old scholar sketched by Charles Lamb in <title>The Essays of Elia.</title> Dyer was a poet and an antiquary, and edited for Valpy nearly all the <num value="140">140</num> volumes of the Delphin Classics. Alternately writer, Baptist minister, and reporter, he eventually settled down in the monastic solitude of Clifford's Inn to compose verses, annotate Greek plays, and write for the magazines. How the worthy, simple-hearted bookworm once walked straight from Lamb's parlour in Colebrooke Row into the New River, and was then fished out and restored <hi rend=italics>with</hi> <hi rend=italics>brandy-and-water</hi>, Lamb was never tired of telling. In the latter part of his life poor old Dyer became totally blind. He died in <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>.
<p>Coke, that great luminary of English jurisprudence, resided at Clifford's Inn for a year, and then entered himself at the Inner Temple. Coke, it will be remembered, conducted the prosecutions of both Essex and Raleigh; in both cases he was grossly unfeeling to fallen great men.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.93.4">The hall of Clifford's Inn</lemma><NOTE resp=B>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.93.1">Gateway, Clifford's Inn</lemma></NOTE> is memorable as being the place where
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.93.5">Sir Matthew Hale</lemma> and <num value="17">seventeen</num> other wise and patient judges sat, after the Great Fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, to adjudicate upon the claims of the landlords and tenants of burned houses, and prevent future lawsuits. The difficulty of discovering the old boundaries, under the mountains of ashes, must have been great; and <num value="40">forty</num> thick folio volumes of decisions, now preserved in the British Museum, tell of many a legal headache in
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.93.3">Clifford's Inn</lemma>.
<p>A very singular custom, and probably of great antiquity, prevails after the dinners at Clifford's Inn. The society is divided into <num value="2">two</num> sections--the Principal and Aules, and the Juniors or <QUOTE>Kentish Men.</QUOTE> When the meal is over, the chairman of the Kentish Men, standing up at the Junior table, bows gravely to the Principal, takes from. the hand of a servitor standing by <num value="4">four</num> small rolls of bread, silently dashes them <num value="3">three</num> times on the table, and then pushes them down to the further end of the board, from whence they are removed. Perfect silence is preserved during this mystic ceremony, which some antiquary who sees deeper into millstones than his brethren thinks typical of offerings to Ceres, who <num value="1">first</num> taught mankind the use of laws and originated those peculiar ornaments of civilisation, their expounders, the lawyers.
<p>In the hall is preserved an old oak folding case, containing the <num value="47">forty-seven</num> rules of the institution, now almost defaced, and probably of the reign of Henry VIII. The hall casement contains armorial glass with the bearings of Baptist Hicks, Viscount Campden, &amp;c.
<p>Robert Pultock, the almost unknown author of that graceful story, <title>Peter Wilkins,</title> from whose flying women Southey drew his poetical notion of the Glendoveer, or flying spirit, in his wild poem of <title>The Curse of Kehama,</title> lived in this Inn, paced on its terrace, and mused in its garden. <QUOTE><Q>Peter Wilkins</Q> is to my mind,</QUOTE> says Coleridge (in his <title>Table Talk</title>), <QUOTE>a work of uncommon beauty, and yet Stothard's illustrations have <hi rend=italics>added</hi>
beauties to it. If it were not for a certain tendency to affectation, scarcely any praise could be too high for Stothard's designs. They give me great pleasure. I believe that <title>Robinson Crusoe</title>
 <pb id="p.94" n="94"> and <title>Peter Wilkins</title> could only have been written by islanders. No continentalist could have conceived either tale. Davis's story is an imitation of <title>Peter Wilkins</title>; but there are many beautiful things in it, especially his finding his wife crouching by the fireside, she having, in his absence, plucked out all her feathers, to be like him! It would require a very peculiar genius to add another tale, <foreign lang=la>ejusdem generis</foreign>, to <title>Peter Wilkins</title> and
<title>Robinson Crusoe.</title> I once projected such a thing, but the difficulty of a pre-occupied ground stopped me. Perhaps La Motte Fouque might effect something; but I should fear that neither he nor any other German could entirely understand what may be called the  <Q> <hi rend=italics>desert island</hi></Q>  feeling. I would try the marvellous line of  <Q>Peter Wilkins,</Q>  if I attempted it, rather than the <hi rend=italics>real</hi> fiction of
<title>Robinson Crusoe</title>.</QUOTE>
<p>The name of the author of <title>Peter Wilkins</title> was discovered only a few years ago. In the year <datestruct value="1835"><year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct> Mr. Nicol, the printer, sold by auction a number of books and manuscripts in his possession, which had formerly belonged to the well-known publisher, Dodsley; and in arranging them for sale, the original agreement for the sale of the manuscript of
<title>Peter Wilkins,</title> by the author, <QUOTE>Robert Pultock, of Clifford's Inn,</QUOTE> to Dodsley, was discovered. From this document it appears that Mr. Pultock received <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> pounds</measure>, <num value="12">twelve</num> copies of the work, and <QUOTE>the cuts of the <num value="1">first</num> impression</QUOTE> --i.e., a set of proof impressions of the fanciful engravings that professed to illustrate the <num value="1">first</num> edition of the work--as the price of the entire copyright. This curious document had, been sold afterwards to John Wilkes, Esq., M.P.
<p>Inns of Chancery, like Clifford's Inn, were originally law schools, to prepare students for the larger Inns of Court.
<P>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.94.1">Fetter Lane</lemma> did not derive its name from the manufacture of Newgate fetters. Stow, who died early in the reign of James I., calls it <QUOTE>Fewtor Lane,</QUOTE> from the Norman-French word <QUOTE>fewtor</QUOTE> (idle person, loafer), perhaps analogous to the even less complimentary modern French word <QUOTE lang=fr>foutre,</QUOTE>
blackguard. Mr. Jesse, however, derives the word <QUOTE>fetter</QUOTE> from the Norman <QUOTE>defaytor</QUOTE> (defaulter), asif the lane had once been a sanctuary for skulking debtors. In either case the derivation is somewhat ignoble, but the inhabitants have long since lived it down. Stow says it was once a mere byway leading to gardens (<hi rend=italics>quantum mutatus )</hi>
If men of the Bobadil and Pistol character ever did look over the garden-gates and puff their Trinidado in the faces of respectable passers-by, the lane at least regained its character later, when poets and philosophers condescended to live in it, and persons of considerable consequence rustled their silks and trailed their velvet along its narrow roadway.
<p>During the Middle Ages Fetter Lane slumbered, but it woke up on the breaking out of the Civil War, and in <datestruct value="1643--"><year reg="1643">1643</year></datestruct> became unpleasantly celebrated as the spot where Waller's plot disastrously terminated.
<p>In the <num value="2">second</num> year of the war between King and Parliament, the Royal successes at Bath, Bristol, and Cornwall, as well as the partial victory at Edgehill, had roused the moderate party and chilled many lukewarm adherents of the Puritans. The distrust of Pym and his friends soon broke out into a reactionary plot, or, more probably, <num value="2">two</num> plots, in <num value="1">one</num> or both of which
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.94.2">Waller, the poet</lemma>, was dangerously mixed up. The chief conspirators were
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.94.3">Tomkins and Challoner</lemma>, the former Waller's brother-in-law, a gentleman living in Holborn, near the end of Fetter Lane, and a secretary to the Commissioners of the Queen's Revenues; the latter an eminent citizen, well known on Change. Many noblemen and Cavalier officers and gentlemen had also a whispering knowledge of the ticklish affair. The projects of these men, or of some of the more desperate, at least, were--(<num value="1">1</num>) to secure the king's children; (<num value="2">2</num>) to seize
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.94.4">Mr. Pym, Colonel Hampden</lemma>
and other members of Parliament specially hostile to the king; (<num value="3">3</num>) to arrest the Puritan Lord Mayor, and all the sour-faced committee of the City Militia; (<num value="4">4</num>) to capture the outworks, forts, magazines, and gates of the Tower and City, and to admit <num value="3000">3,000</num> Cavaliers sent from Oxford by a pre-arranged plan; (<num value="5">5</num>) to resist all payments imposed by Parliament for support of the armies of the Earl of Essex. Unfortunately, just as the white ribbons were preparing to tie round the arms of the conspirators, to mark them on the night of action, a treacherous servant of Mr. Tomkins, of Holborn, overheard Waller's plans from behind a convenient arras, and disclosed them to the angry Parliament. In a cellar at Tomkins's the soldiers who rummaged it found a commission sent from the king by Lady Aubigny, whose husband had been recently killed at Edgehill.
<p>Tomkins and Challoner were hung at the Holborn end of Fetter Lane. On the ladder, Tomkins said :-- <QUOTE>Gentlemen, I humbly acknowledge, in the sight of Almighty God (to whom, and to angels, and to this great assembly of people, I am now a spectacle), that my sins have deserved of Him this untimely and shameful death; and, touching the business for which I suffer, I acknowledge that affection to a brother-in-law, and affection and gratitude to the king, whose bread I have eaten <pb id="p.95" n="95"> now, about <num value="22">twenty-two</num> years (I have been servant to him when he was prince, and ever since: it will be <num value="23">twenty-three</num> years in August next)-I confess these <num value="2">two</num> motives drew me into this foolish business. I have often since declared to good friends that I was glad it was discovered, because it might have occasioned very ill consequences; and truly I have repented having any hand in it.</QUOTE>
<p>Challoner was equally fatal against Waller, and said, when at the same giddy altitude as Tomkins, <QUOTE>Gentlemen, this is the happiest day that ever I had. I shall now, gentlemen, declare a little more of the occasion of this, as I am desired by r. Peters [the famous Puritan divine, Hugh Peters] to give him and the world satisfaction in it. t came from Mr. Waller, under this notion, that if we could make a moderate party here in London, and stand betwixt and in the gap to unite the king and the Parliament, it would be a very acceptable work, for now the <num value="3">three</num> kingdoms lay a-bleeding; and unless that were done, there was no hopes to unite them,</QUOTE> &amp;c.
<p>Waller had a very narrow escape, but he extricated himself with the most subtle skill, perhaps secretly aided by his kinsman, Cromwell. He talked of his <QUOTE>carnal eye,</QUOTE> of his repentance, of the danger of letting the army try a member of the House. As Lord Clarendon says: <QUOTE>With incredible dissimulation he acted such a remorse of conscience, that his trial was put off, out of Christian compassion, till he could recover his understanding.</QUOTE> In the meantime he bribed the Puritan preachers, and listened with humble deference to their prayers for his repentance. He bent abjectly before the house; and eventually, with a year's imprisonment and a fine of <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>, obtained leave to retire to France. Having spent all his money in Paris, Waller at last gained permission from Cromwell to return to England. <QUOTE>There cannot,</QUOTE> says Clarendon, <QUOTE>be a greater evidence of the inestimable value of his (Waller's) parts, than that he lived after this in the good esteem and affection of many, the pity of most, and the reproach and scorn of few or none.</QUOTE> The body of the unlucky Tomkins was buried in the churchyard of St. Andrew's, Holborn.
<p>According to Peter Cunningham, that shining light of the Puritan party in the early days of Cromwell, <QUOTE>Praise-God Barebone,</QUOTE> was a leather-seller in Fetter Lane, having a house, either at the same time or later, called the <QUOTE>Lock and Key,</QUOTE> near Crane Court, at which place his son, a great speculator and builder, afterwards resided. Barebone (probably Barbon, of a French Huguenot family) was <num value="1">one</num> of those gloomy religionists who looked on surplices, plum-porridge, theatres, dances, Christmas pudding, and homicide as equally detestable, and did his best to shut out all sunshine from that long, rainy, stormy day that is called life. He was at the head of that fanatical, tenderconscienced Parliament of <datestruct value="1653--"><year reg="1653">1653</year></datestruct> which Cromwell convened from among the elect in London, after untoward Sir Harry Vane had been expelled from Westminster at the muzzles of Pride's muskets. Of Barebone, also, and his crochety, impracticable fellows, Cromwell had soon enough; and, in despair of all aid but from his own brain and hand, he then took the title of Lord Protector, and became the most inflexible and ablest monarch we have ever had, or indeed ever hope to have. Barebone is <num value="1">first</num> heard of in local history as preaching in <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>, together with Mr. Greene, a felt-maker, at a conventicle in Fetter Lane, a place always renowned for its heterodoxy. The thoughtless Cavaliers, who did not like long sermons, and thought all religion but their own hypocrisy, delighted in gaunt Barebone's appropriate name, and made fun of him in those ribald ballads in which they consigned rednosed Noll, the brewer, to the reddest and hottest portion of the unknown world. At the Restoration, when all Fleet Street was
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.95.1">ablaze with bonfires to roast the Rumps</LEMMA>, the street boys, always on the strongest side, broke poor Barebone's windows, though he had been constable and commoncotincilman, and was a wealthy leather-seller to boot. But he was not looked upon as of the regicide or extreme dangerous party, and a year afterwards attended a vestry-meeting unmolested. After the Great Fire he came to the Clifford's Inn Appeal Court about his Fleet Street house, which had been burnt over the heads of his tenants, and eventually he rebuilt it.
<p>In Irving's <title>History of Dissenters</title> there is a curious account, taken from an old pamphlet entitled <title>New Preachers,</title> <QUOTE>of Barebone, Greene the felt-maker, Spencer the horse-rubber, Quartermaine the brewer's clerk, and some few others, who are mighty sticklers in this new kind of talking trade, which many ignorant coxcombs call preaching; whereunto is added the last tumult in Fleet Street, raised by the disorderly preachment, pratings, and prattlings of Mr. Barebone the leather-seller, and Mr. Greene the felt-maker, on Sunday last, the <datestruct value="12-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>.</QUOTE>
<p>The tumult alluded to is thus described: <QUOTE>A brief touch in memory of the fiery zeal of Mr. Barebone, a reverend unlearned leather-seller, who with Mr. Greene the felt-maker were both taken preaching or prating in a conventicle <pb id="p.96" n="96"> amongst a <num value="100">hundred</num> persons, on Sunday, the <datestruct value="12-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct> last, <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE>
<p><num value="1">One</num> of the pleasantest memories of Fetter Lane is that which connects it with the schooldays of that delightful essay-writer, Charles Lamb. He himself, in <num value="1">one</num> of Hone's chatty books, has described the school, and Bird, its master, in his own charming way.
<p>Both Lamb and his sister, says Mr. Fitzgerald, in his Memoir of Lamb, went to a school where Starkey had been usher about a year before they came to it--a room that looked into <QUOTE>a discoloured, dingy garden, in the passage leading from Fetter Lane into Bartlett's Buildings. This was close to Holborn. Queen Street, where Lamb lived when a boy, was in Holborn.</QUOTE> Bird is described as an <QUOTE>eminent writer</QUOTE> who taught mathematics, which was no more than <QUOTE>cyphering.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Heaven knows what languages were taught there. I am sure that neither my sister nor myself brought any out of it but a little of our native English. It was, in fact, a humble day-school.</QUOTE> Bird and Cook, he says, were the masters. Bird had <QUOTE>that peculiar mild tone--especially when he was inflicting punishment--which is so much more terrible to children than the angriest looks and gestures. Whippings
<FIGURE id="Fig.096" n="2000.06.0036"><HEAD>Roasting The Rumps In Fleet Street (From An Old Print) (see page <num value="95">95</num>).</HEAD></FIGURE>
 were not frequent; but when they took place, the correction was performed in a private room adjoining, whence we could only hear the plaints, but saw nothing. This heightened the decorum and solemnity.</QUOTE> He then describes the ferule-- <QUOTE>that almost obsolete weapon now.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>To make him look more formidable--if a pedagogue had need of these heightenings--Bird wore <num value="1">one</num> of those flowered Indian gowns formerly in use with schoolmasters, the strange figures upon which we used to interpret into hieroglyphics of pain and suffering.</QUOTE> This is in Lamb's most delightful vein. So, too, with other incidents of the school, especially <QUOTE>our little leaden ink-stands, not separately subsisting, but Sunk into the desks; and the agonising benches on which we were all cramped together, and yet encouraged to attain a free hand, unattainable in this position.</QUOTE> Lamb recollected even his <num value="1">first</num> copy- <QUOTE>Art improves nature,</QUOTE> and could look back with <QUOTE>pardonable pride to his carrying off the <num value="1">first</num> premium for spelling. Long after, certainly <num value="30">thirty</num> years, the school was still going on, only there was a Latin inscription over the entrance in the lane, unknown in our humbler days.</QUOTE> In the evening was a short attendance of girls, to which Miss Lamb went, and she recollected the theatricals, <pb id="p.97" n="97"> and even <title>Cato</title> being performed by the young gentlemen. <QUOTE>She describes the cast of the characters with relish.  <Q>Martha,</Q>  by the handsome Edgar Hickman, who afterwards went to Africa.</QUOTE>
<p>The Starkey mentioned by Lamb was a poor, crippled dwarf, generally known at Newcastle in his old age as <QUOTE>Captain Starkey,</QUOTE> the butt of the street-boys and the pensioner of benevolent citizens. In <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>, when he had been an inmate of the Freemen's Hospital, Newcastle, for <num value="26">twenty-six</num> years, the poor old ex-usher of the Fetter Lane school wrote <title>The Memoirs of his Life,</title> a humble little pamphlet of only <num value="14">fourteen</num> pages, upon which Hone good-naturedly wrote an article which educed Lamb's pleasant postscript. Starkey, it appears, had been usher, not in Lamb's own time, but in that of Mary Lamb's, who came after her brother had left. She describes Starkey running away on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, being brought back by his father, and sitting the remainder of the day with his head buried in his hands, even the most mischievous boys respecting his utter desolation.
<p>That clever but mischievous advocate of divine right and absolute power,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.97.1">Hobbes of Malmesburby</lemma>

<FIGURE id="Fig.097" n="2000.06.0037"><HEAD>Interior of The Moravian Chapel In Fetter Lane (see page <num value="100">100</num>).</HEAD></FIGURE>
 was lodging in Fetter Lane when he published his
<title>Leviathan.</title> He was not there, however, in <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, at the Restoration, since we are told that on that <hi rend=italics>glorious</hi> occasion he was standing at the door of Salisbury House, the mansion of his kind and generous patron, the Earl of Devonshire; and that the king, formerly Hobbes's pupil in mathematics, nodded to his old tutor. A short duodecimo sketch of Hobbes may not be uninteresting. This sceptical philosopher, hardened into dogmatic selfishness by exile, was the son of a Wiltshire clergyman, and he <num value="1">first</num> saw the light the year of the Armada, his mother being prematurely confined during the <num value="1">first</num> panic of the Spanish invasion. Hobbes, with that same want of self-respect and love of independence that actuated Gay and Thomson, remained his whole life a tolerated pensioner of his former pupil, the Earl of Devonshire; bearing, no doubt, in his time many rebuffs; for pride will be proud, and rich men require wisdom, when in their pay, to remember its place. Hobbes in his time was a friend of, and, it is said, a translator for, Lord Bacon; and Ben Jonson, that ripe scholar, revised his sound translation of <title>Thucydides.</title> He sat at <pb id="p.98" n="98"> the feet of Galileo and by the side of Gassendi and Descartes. While in Fetter Lane he associated with Harvey, Selden, and Cowley. He talked and wrangled with the wise men of half Europe. He had sat at Richelieu's table and been loaded with honoursby Cosmo de Medici. The laurels Hobbes won in the schools he lost on Parnassus. His translation of Homer is tasteless and contemptible. In mathematics, too, he was dismounted by Wallis:and others. Personally he had weaknesses. He was afraid of apparitions, he dreaded assassination, and had a fear that Burnet and the bishops would burn him as a heretic. His philosophy, though useful, as Mr. Mill says, in expanding free thought and exciting inquiry, was based on selfishness. Nothing can be falser and more detestable than the maxims of this sage of the Restoration and of reaction. He holds the natural condition of man to be a state of war--a war of all men against all men; might making right, and the conqueror trampling down all the rest. The civil laws, he declares, are the only standards of good or evil. The sovereign, he asserts, possesses absolute power, and is not bound by any compact with the people (who pay him as their head servant). Nothing he does can be wrong. The sovereign has the right of interpreting Scripture; and he thinks that Christians are bound to obey the laws of an infidel king, even in matters of religion. He sneers at the belief in a future state, and hints at materialism. These monstrous doctrines, which even Charles II. would not fully sanction, were naturally battered and bombarded by Harrington, Dr. Henry More, and others. Hobbes was also vehemently attacked by that disagreeable Dr. Fell, the subject of the well-known epigram,--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>I do not like thee, Dr, Fell ;
<L>The reason why I cannot tell;
<L>But this I know, and know full well,

 who rudely called Hobbes <QUOTE lang=la>irritabile illud et vanissimum Malmsburiense animal.</QUOTE> The philosopher of Fetter Lane, who was short-sighted enough to deride the early efforts of the Royal Society, though they were founded on the Strict inductive Baconian theory, seems to have been a vain man, loving paradox rather than truth, and desirous of founding, at all risks, a new school of philosophy. The Civil War had warped him; solitary thinking had turned him into a cynical dogmatiser. He was timid as Erasmus; and once confessed that if he was cast into a deep pit, and the devil should put down his hot cloven foot, he would take hold of it to draw himself out. This was not the metal that such men as Luther and Latimer were made of; but it served for the Aristotle of Rochester and Buckingham. A wit of the day proposed as Hobbes's epitaph the simple words, <QUOTE>The philosopher's stone.</QUOTE>
<p>Hobbes's professed rule of health was to dedicate the morning to his exercise and the afternoon to his studies., At his <num value="1">first</num> rising, therefore, he walked out and climbed any hill within his reach; or, if the weather was not dry, he fatigued himself within doors by some exercise or other, in order to perspire, recommending that practice upon this opinion, that an old man had more moisture than heat, and therefore by such motion heat was to be acquired and moisture expelled. After this he took a comfortable breakfast, then went round the lodgings to wait upon the earl, the countess, the children, and any considerable strangers, paying some short addresses to all of them. He kept these rounds till about <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock, when he had a little dinner provided for him, which he ate always by himself, without ceremony. Soon after dinner he retired to his study, and had his candle, with <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> pipes of tobacco, laid by him; then, shutting his door, he fell to smoking, thinking, and writing for several hours.
<p>At a small coal-shed (just <num value="1">one</num> of those black bins still to be seen at the south-west end) in Fetter Lane, Dr. Johnson's friend, Levett, the poor apothecary, met a woman of bad character, who duped him into marriage. The whole story, Dr. Johnson used to say, was as marvellous as any page of <title>The Arabian Nights.</title> Lord Macaulay, in his highlycoloured and somewhat exaggerated way, calls Levett <QUOTE>an old quack doctor, who bled and dosed coal-heavers and hackney-coachmen, and received for fees crusts of bread, bits of bacon, glasses of gin, and a little copper.</QUOTE> Levett, however, was neither a quack nor a doctor, but an honest man and an apothecary, and the list of his patients is entirely hypothetical. This simple-hearted, benevolent man was persuaded by the proprietress of the coal-shed that she had been defrauded  <QUOTE>of her birthright by her kinsman, a man of fortune. Levett, then nearly <num value="60">sixty</num>, married her; and <num value="4">four</num> months after, a writ was issued against him for debts contracted by his wife, and he </QUOTE> had to lie close to avoid the gaol. Not long afterwards his amiable wife ran away from him, and, being taken up for picking pockets, was tried at the Old Bailey, where she defended herself, and was acquitted. Dr. Johnson then, touched by Levett's misfortunes and goodness, took him to his own home at Bolt Court.
<p>It was in a house on the east side of this lane, looking into Fleur-de-Lys Court, that (in <datestruct value="1767--"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>) <pb id="p.99" n="99"> Elizabeth Brownrigge, midwife to the St. Dunstan's workhouse and wife of a house-painter, cruelly illused her <num value="2">two</num> female apprentices. Mary Jones, <num value="1">one</num> of these unfortunate children, after being often beaten, ran back to the Foundling, from whence she had been taken. On the remaining <num value="1">one</num>, Mary Mitchell, the wrath of the avaricious hag now fell with redoubled severity. The poor creature was perpetually being stripped and beaten, was frequently chained up at night nearly naked, was scratched, and her tongue cut with scissors. It was the constant practice of Mrs. Brownrigge to fasten the girl's hands to a rope slung from a beam in the kitchen, after which this old wretch beat her <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> times in the same day with a broom or a whip. The moanings and groans of the dying child, whose wounds were mortifying from neglect; aroused the pity of a baker opposite, who sent the overseers of the parish to see the child, who was found hid in a buffet cupboard. She was taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and soon died. Brownrigge was at once arrested; but Mrs. Brownrigge and her son, disguising themselves in Rag Fair, fled to Wandsworth, and there took lodgings in a chandler's shop, where they were arrested. The woman was tried at the Old Bailey sessions, and found guilty of murder. Mr. Silas Told, an excellent Methodist preacher, who attended her in the condemned cell, has left a curious, simplehearted account of her behaviour and of what he considered her repentance. She <hi rend=italics>talked</hi> a great deal of religion, and stood much on the goodness of her past life. The mob raged terribly as she passed through the streets on her way to Tyburn. The women especially screamed, <QUOTE>Tear off her hat; let us see her face! The devil will fetch her</QUOTE> and threw stones and mud, pitiless in their hatred. After execution her corpse was thrust into a hackney-coach and driven to Surgeons' Hall for dissection; the skeleton is still preserved in a London collection. The cruel hag's husband and son were sentenced to <num value="6">six</num> months' imprisonment. A curious old drawing is still extant, representing
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.99.1">Mrs. Brownrigge in the condemned cell</lemma>. She wears a large, broad-rimmed gypsy hat, tied under her chin, and a cape; and her long, hard face wears a horrible smirk of resigned hypocrisy.

<p>In Castle Street (an offshoot of Fetter Lane), in <datestruct value="1709--"><year reg="1709">1709</year></datestruct>-<num value="10">10</num> (Queen Anne), at the house of his father, a master tailor, was born a very small poet, Paul Whitehead. This poor satirist and worthless man became a Jacobite barrister and prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Bubb Doddington and the Prince of Wales and his Leicester Fields Court. For libelling Whig noblemen, in his poem called <title>Manners,</title> Dodsley, Whitehead's publisher, was summoned by the Ministers, who wished to intimidate Pope, before the House of Lords. He appears to have been an atheist, and was a member of the infamous Hell-Fire Club, thatheld its obscene and blasphemous orgies at Medmenham Abbey, in Buckinghamshire, the seat of Sir Francis Dashwood, where every member assumed the name of an Apostle. Later in life Whitehead was bought off by the Ministry, and then settled down at a villa on Twickenham Common, where Hogarth used to visit him. Ii Whitehead is ever remembered, it will be only for that splash of vitriol that Churchill threw in his face, when he wrote of the turncoat,--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>May I--can worse disgrace on manhood fall?--
<L>Be born a Whitehead and baptised a Paul.</QUOTE>
 It was this Whitehead, with Carey, the surgeon of the Prince of Wales, who got up a mock procession, in ridicule of the Freemasons' annual cavalcade from Brooke Street to Haberdashers' Hall. The ribald procession consisted of shoe-blacks and chimney-sweeps, in carts drawn by asses, followed by a mourning-coach with <num value="6">six</num> horses, each of a different colour. The City authorities very properly refused to let them pass through Temple Bar, but they waited there and saluted the Masons. Hogarth published a print of <title>The Scald Miserables,</title> which is coarse, and even dull. The Prince of Wales, with more good sense than usual, dismissed Carey for this offensive buffoonery. Whitehead bequeathed his heart to Earl Despenser, who buried it in his mausoleum with absurd ceremonial.
<p>At Pemberton Row, formerly <num value="3">Three</num>-Leg Alley, Fetter Lane, lived that very indifferent poet but admirable miniature-painter of Charles II.'s time, Flatman. He was a briefless barrister of the Inner Temple, and resided with his father till the period of his death. Anthony Wood tells us that having written a scurrilous ballad against marriage, beginning,--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Like a dog with a bottle tied close to his tail,
<L>Like a Tory in a bog, or a thief in a jail,</QUOTE>
 his comrades serenaded him with the song on his wedding-night. Rochester wrote some vigorous lines on Flatman, which are not unworthy even of Dryden himself,--

It appears to have existed, though perhaps in a different form, before the Great Fire of London. Turner, who was the <num value="1">first</num> minister, was a very active man during the plague. He was ejected from Sunbury, in Middlesex, and continued to preach in Fetter Lane till towards the end of the reign of Charles II., when he removed to Leather Lane.

Goodwin had been a pastor in Holland and a favourite of Cromwell. The Protector made him <num value="1">one</num> of his commissioners for selecting preachers, and he was also resident of Magdalen College, Oxford. When Cromwell became sick unto death, Goodwin boldly prophesied his recovery, and when the great man died, inspite of him, he is said to have exclaimed, <QUOTE>Thou hast deceived us, and we are deceived;</QUOTE> which is no doubt a Cavalier calumny. On the Restoration, the Oxford men showed Goodwin the door, and he retired to the seclusion of Fetter Lane.

<p>The disgraceful disorder of the national records had long been a subject of regret among English antiquaries. There was no certainty of finding any required document among such a mass of ill-stored, dusty, unclassified bundles and rollsmany of them never opened since the day King John sullenly signed Magna Charta. We are a great conservative people, and abuses take a long time ripening before they seem to us fit for removal, so it happened that this evil went on several centuries before it roused the attention of Parliament, and then it was talked over and over, till in <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct> something was at last done. It was resolved to build a special storehouse for national records, where the various collections might be united under <num value="1">one</num> roof, and there be arranged and classified by learned men. The <num value="1">first</num> stone of a
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.101.5">magnificent Gothic building</LEMMA> was therefore laid by Lord Romilly on <datestruct VALUE="1851-05-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>, and slowly and surely, in the Anglo-Saxon manner, the walls grew till, in the summer of <datestruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct>, all the new Search Offices were formally opened, to the great convenience of all students of records. The architect, Sir James Pennethorne, has produced a stately building, useful for its purpose, but not very remarkable for picturesque light and shade, and tame, as all imitations of bygone ages, adapted for bygone uses, must ever be. The number of records stored within this building can only be reckoned by <QUOTE><hi rend=italics>hundreds of millions</hi>.</QUOTE> These are Sir Thomas Duffus Hardy's own words. There, in cramped bundles and rolls, dusty as papyri, lie charters and official notices that once made mailed knights tremble and proud priests shake in their sandals. Now--the magic gone, the words powerless--they lie in their several binns in strange companionship. Many years will elapse before all these records of State and Government documents can be classified; but the small staff is industrious, Sir Thomas Hardy is working, and in time the Augean stable of crabbed writings will be cleansed and ranged in order. The useful and accurate calendars of Everett Green, John Bruce, &amp;c., are books of reference invaluable to historical students; and the old chronicles published by order of Lord Romilly, so long Master of the Rolls and Keeper of the Records, are most useful mines for the Froudes and Freemans of the future. In time it is hoped that all the episcopal records of England will be gathered together in this great treasurehouse, and that many of our English noblemen will imitate the patriotic generosity of Lord Shaftesbury, in contributing their family papers to the same Gaza in Fetter Lane. Under the concentrated gaze of learned eyes, family papers (valueless and almost unintelligible to their original possessors), often reveal very curious and important facts. Mere lumber in the manor-house, fit only for the butterman, sometimes turns to leaves of gold when submitted to such microscopic analysis. It was such a gift that led to the discovery of the Locke papers among the records of the nobleman above mentioned. The pleasant rooms of the Record Office are open to all applicants; nor is any reference or troublesome preliminary form required from those wishing to consult Court rolls or State papers over <num value="20">twenty</num> years old.

It is in <num value="2">two</num> volumes, the covers of which are cut with due economy from the same skin of parchment.

It is curious to remark that London only occupies some <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> pages. There is also preserved the original Papal Bull sent to Henry VIII., with a golden seal attached to it, the work of Benvenuto Cellini. The same collection contains the celebrated Treaty of the Field of the Cloth of Gold, the initial portrait of Francis I. being beautifully illuminated and the vellum volume adorned by an exquisite gold seal, in the finest relievo, also by Benvenuto Cellini. The figures in this seal are so perfect in their finish, that even the knee-cap of <num value="1">one</num> of the nymphs is shaped with the strictest anatomical accuracy. The visitor should also see the interesting Inventory Books relating to the foundation of Henry VII.'s chapel.
<p>The national records were formerly bundled up any how in the Rolls Chapel, the White Tower, the Chapter House, Westminster Abbey, Carlton Hide in St. James's Park, the State Paper Office, and the Prerogative Will Office. No <num value="1">one</num> knew where anything was. They were unnoticed--mere dusty lumber, in fact--useless to men or printers' devils. Hot-headed Hugh Peters, during the Commonwealth, had, in his hatred of royalty, proposed to make <num value="1">one</num> great heap of them and burn them up in Smithfield. In that way he hoped to clear the ground of many mischievous traditions. his desperate act of Communism that toughheaded old lawyer,

The front of the house towards the garden is nearly half as long again as that towards Crane Court. Upon the ground floor there is a little hall, and a direct passage from the stairs into the garden, and on each side of it a little room. The stairs are easy, which carry you up to the next floor. Here there is a room fronting the court, directly over the hall; and towards the garden is the meeting-room, and at the end another, also fronting the garden. There are <num value="3">three</num> rooms upon the next floor.--These are all that are as yet provided for the reception of the society, except you will have the garrets, a platform of lead over them, and the usual cellars, &amp;c., below, of which they have more and better at Gresham College.</QUOTE>
<p>When the society got settled, by Newton's order the porter was clothed in a suitable gown and provided with a staff surmounted by the arms of the society in silver, and on the meeting nights a lamp was hung out over the entrance to the court from Fleet Street. The repository was built at the rear of the house, and thither the society's museum was removed.

<p>The author of <title>Hudibras,</title> who died in <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>, attacked the Royal Society for experiments that seemed to him futile and frivolous, in a severe and bitter poem, entitled, <title>The Elephant in the Moon,</title> the elephant proving to be a mouse inside a philosopher's telescope. The poem expresses the current opinion of the society, on which King Charles II. is once said to have played a joke.
<P>In <datestruct value="1726--"><year reg="1726">1726</year></datestruct>-<num value="27">27</num> Swift, too, had his bitter jeer at the society. In Laputa, he thus describes the experimental philosophers:--
<p> <QUOTE>The <num value="1">first</num> man I saw,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE><p>was of a meagre aspect, with sooty hands and face, his hair and beard long, ragged, and singed in several places. His clothes, shirt, and skin, were all of the same colour. He had been <num value="8">eight</num> years upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers, which were to be put in phials hermetically sealed, and let out to warm the air in raw, inclement summers. He told me he did not doubt that, in <num value="8">eight</num> years more, he should be able to supply the governor's gardens with sunshine at a reasonable rate; but he complained that his stock was low, and entreated me  <Q>to give him something as an encouragement to ingenuity, especially since this had been a very dear season for cucumbers.</Q>  I made him a small present, for my lord had furnished me with money on purpose, because he knew their practice of begging from all who go to see them. I saw another at work to calcine ice into gunpowder, who likewise showed me a treatise he had written concerning the  <Q>Malleability of Fire,</Q>  which he intended to publish.
<p>There was a most ingenious architect, who had contrived a new method of building houses, by beginning at the roof and working downward to <pb id="p.106" n="106"> the foundation; which he justified to me by the like practice of those <num value="2">two</num> prudent insects, the bee and the spider.

At my entrance, he called aloud to me  <Q>not to disturb his webs.</Q>  He lamented  <Q>the fatal mistake the world had been so long in, of using silk-worms, while we had such plenty of domestic insects who infinitely excelled the former, because they understood how to weave as well as spin.</Q>  And he proposed, farther,  <Q>that, by employing spiders, the charge of dying silks would be wholly saved;</Q>  whereof I was fully convinced when he showed me a vast number of flies, most beautifully coloured, wherewith he fed his spiders, assuring us,  <Q>that the webs would take a tincture from them;</Q>  and, as he had them of all hues, he hoped to fit everybody's fancy, as soon as he could find proper food for the flies, of certain gums, oils, and other glutinous matter, to give a strength and consistence to the threads.</QUOTE>

<p>Mr. Grosley, who, in <datestruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>, at Lausanne, published a book on London, has drawn a curious picture of the society at that date. <QUOTE>The Royal Society,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE><p>combines within itself the purposes of the Parisian Academy of Sciences and that of Inscriptions; it cultivates, in fact, not only the higher branches of science, but literature also. Every <num value="1">one</num>, whatever his position, and whether English or foreign, who has made observations which appear to the society worthy of its attention, is allowed to submit them to it either by word of mouth or in writing. I once saw a joiner, in his working clothes, announce to the society a means he had discovered of explaining the causes of tides. He spoke a long time, evidently not knowing what he was talking about; but he was listened to with the greatest attention, thanked for his confidence in the value of the society's opinion, requested to put his ideas into writing, and conducted to the door by <num value="1">one</num> of the principal members.

<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.106.4">The place in which the society holds its meetings</LEMMA> is neither large nor handsome. It is a long, low, narrow room, only furnished with a table (covered with green cloth), some morocco chairs, and some wooden benches, which rise above each other along the room. The table, placed in front of the fire-place at the bottom of the room, is occupied by the president (who sits with his back to the fire) and the secretaries. On this table is placed a large silver-gilt mace, similar to the <num value="1">one</num> in use in the House of Commons, and which, as is the case with the latter, is laid at the foot of the table when the society is in committee. The president is preceded on his entrance and departure by the beadle of the society, bearing this mace. He has beside him, on his table, a little wooden mallet for the purpose of imposing silence when occasion arises, but this is very seldom the case. With the exception of the secretaries and the president, everyone takes his place hap-hazard, at the same time taking great pains to avoid causing any confusion or noise. The society may be said to consist, as a body corporate, of a committee of about <num value="20">twenty</num> persons, chosen from those of its associates who have the fuller opportunities of devoting themselves to their favourite studies. The president and the secretaries are <foreign lang=la>ex officio</foreign> members of the committee, which is renewed every year--an arrangement which is so much the more necessary that, in <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, the society numbered <num value="400">400</num> British members, of whom more than <num value="40">forty</num> were peers of the realm, <num value="5">five</num> of the latter being most assiduous members of the committee.
<p>The foreign honorary members, who number about <num value="150">150</num>, comprise within their number all the most famous learned men of Europe, and amongst them we find the names of D&lsquo;Alembert, Bernouilli, Bonnet, Buffon, Euler, Jussieu, Linn&eacute;, Voltaire, &amp;c.; together with those, in simple alphabetical order, of the Dukes of Braganza, &amp;c., and the chief Ministers of many European sovereigns.</QUOTE>

The king, it is declared, had an interview with
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.106.3">Sir John Pringle</lemma>, during which his Majesty earnestly entreated him to use his influence in supporting Mr. Wilson.--The reply of the president was highly honourable to himself and the society whom he represented.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.107.1">Ruins of Scottish Society Building, Crane Court, <datestruct value="1885--"><year reg="1885">1885</year></datestruct></lemma></NOTE> <QUOTE>Elizabeth,</QUOTE> says Mr. Timbs, <QUOTE><p>kept down the number of Scotsmen in London to the astonishingly small <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="58">fifty-eight</num>; but with James I. came such a host of traders and craftsmen, many of whom failing to obtain employment, gave rise, as early as <datestruct value="1613"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct>, to the institution of the  <Q>Scottish Box,</Q>  a sort of friendly society's treasury, when there were no banks to take charge of money. In <datestruct value="1638--"><year reg="1638">1638</year></datestruct> the company, then only <num value="20">twenty</num>, met in Lamb's Conduit Street. In this year upwards of <num value="300">300</num> poor Scotsmen, swept off by the great plague of <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>-<num value="66">66</num>, were buried at the expense of the  <Q>box,</Q>  while numbers more were nourished during their sickness, without subjecting the parishes in which they resided to the smallest expense.
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1665"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct> the  <Q>box</Q>  was exalted into the character of a corporation by a royal charter, the expenses attendant on which were disbursed by gentlemen who, when they met at the  <Q>Cross Keys,</Q>  in Covent Garden, found their receipts to be <measure value="116l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="116">116</num></measure> <measure value="8s. 5d." type=Currency><num value="8">8</num>s. <num value="5">5</num>d.</measure> The character of the times is seen in <num value="1">one</num> of their regulations, which imposed a fine of <measure value="2s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> for every oath used in the course of their quarterly business.
<p>Presents now flocked in. <num value="1">One</num> of the corporation gave a silver cup; another, an ivory mallet or hammer for the chairman; and among the contributors we find Gilbert Burnet, afterwards bishop, giving <num value="1">1</num> half-yearly. In no very Scotsman-like spirit the governors distributed each quarter-day all that had been collected during the preceding interval. But in <datestruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct> a permanent fund was established. The hospital now distributes about  <measure value="2200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2200">2,200</num></measure> a year, chiefly in <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> pensions to old people; and the princely bequest of <measure value="76495l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="76495">76,495</num></measure> by Mr. W.

<p>All this is highly honourable to those connected, by birth or otherwise, with Scotland. The monthly meetings of the society are preceded by divine service in the chapel, which is in the rear of the house in Crane Court. Twice a year is held a festival, at which large sums are collected. On St. Andrew's Day, <datestruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></datestruct>, Viscount Palmerston presided, with the brilliant result of the addition of <measure value="1200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1200">1,200</num></measure> to the hospital fund.</QUOTE>

<p>Appended to the account of the society already quoted we find the following remarkable <QUOTE>note by an Englishman</QUOTE> :--
<p> <QUOTE>It is not <num value="1">one</num> of the least curious particulars in the history of the Scottish Hospital that it substantiates by documentary evidence the fact that Scotsmen who have gone to England occasionally find their way back to their own country.

<P>In Crane Court, says Mr. Timbs, lived Dryden Leach, the printer, who, in <datestruct value="1763--"><year reg="1763">1763</year></datestruct>, was arrested on a general warrant upon suspicion of having printed Wilkes's <title>North Briton</title>, No <num value="45">45</num>. Leach was taken out of his bed in the night, his papers were seized, and even his journeymen and servants were apprehended, the only foundation for the arrest being a hearsay that Wilkes had been seen going into Leach's house. Wilkes had been sent to the Tower for the No. <num value="45">45</num>. After much litigation, he obtained a verdict of <measure value="4000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4000">4,000</num></measure>, and Leach <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure>, damages from <num value="3">three</num> of the king's messengers, who had executed the illegal warrant. Kearsley, the bookseller, of Fleet Street (whom we recollect by his tax-tables), had been taken up for publishing No. <num value="45">45</num>, when also at Kearsley's were seized the letters of Wilkes, which seemed to fix upon him the writing of the <pb id="p.108" n="108"> obscene and blasphemous <title>Essay on Woman,</title> and of which he was convicted in the Court of King's Bench and expelled the House of Commons. The author of this <QUOTE>indecent patchwork</QUOTE> was not Wilkes (says Walpole), but Thomas Potter, the wild son of the learned Archbishop of Canterbury, who had tried to fix the authorship on the learned and arrogant Warburton--a piece of matchless impudence worthy of Wilkes himself.
<p>Red Lion Court (No. <num value="169">169</num>), though an unlikely spot, has been, of all the side binns of Fleet Street, <num value="1">one</num> of the most specially favoured by Minerva. Here Valpy published that interminable series of Latin and Greek authors, which he called the

<p>Johnson's Court, Fleet Street (a narrow court on the north side of Fleet Street, the <num value="4">fourth</num> from Fetter Lane, eastward), was not named from Dr. Johnson, although inhabited by him.

At Johnson's <pb id="p.109" n="109"> Court he made the acquaintance of Murphey, and he worked at his edition of <title>Shakespeare.</title> He saw much of Reynolds and Burke. On the accession of George III. a pension of <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure> a year had been bestowed on him, and from that time he became comparatively an affluent man. In <datestruct value="1763--"><year reg="1763">1763</year></datestruct>, Boswell had become acquainted with Dr. Johnson, and from that period his wonderful conversations are recorded. The indefatigable biographer describes, in <datestruct value="1763--"><year reg="1763">1763</year></datestruct>, being taken by Mr. Levett to see r. Johnson's library, which was contained in his garret over his Temple chambers, where the son of the well-known Lintot used to have his warehouse he floor was strewn with manuscript leaves; and there was an apparatus for chemical experiments, of which Johnson was all his life very fond. Johnson often hid himself in this garret for study, but never told his servant, as the Doctor would never allow him to say he was not at home when he was.

<P> <QUOTE>He</QUOTE> (Johnson), says Hawkins, <QUOTE>removed from the Temple into a house in Johnson's Court, Fleet Street, and invited thither his friend Mrs. Williams. An upper room, which had the advantage of a good light and free air, he fitted up for a study and furnished with books, chosen with so little regard to editions or their external appearances as showed they were intended for use, and that he disdained the ostentation of learning.</QUOTE>
<P> <QUOTE>I returned to London,</QUOTE> says Boswell, <QUOTE>in <datestruct VALUE="1766-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct>, and found Dr. Johnson in a good house in Johnson's Court, Fleet Street, in which he had accommodated Mrs. Williams with an apartment on the ground-floor, while Mr. Levett occupied his post in the garret. His faithful Francis was still attending upon him. He received me with much kindness. The fragments of our <num value="1">first</num> conversation, which I have preserved, are these:-- I told him that Voltaire, in a conversation with <pb id="p.110" n="110"> me, had distinguished Pope and Dryden, thus:  <Q> Pope drives a handsome chariot, with a couple of neat, trim nags; Dryden, a coach and <num value="6">six</num> stately horses.</Q>  Johnson:  <Q>Why, sir, the truth is, they both drive coaches and <num value="6">six</num>, but Dryden's horses are either galloping or stumbling; Pope's go at a steady, even trot.</Q>  He said of Goldsmith's  <Q>Traveller,</Q>  which had been published in my absence,  <Q>There's not been so fine a poem since Pope's time.</Q>  Dr. Johnson at the same time favoured me by marking the lines which he furnished to Goldsmith's  <Q>Deserted Village,</Q>  which are only the last <num value="4">four</num>:--
<Q REND=blockquote><L>That trade's proud empire hastes to swift decay,
<L>As ocean sweeps the labour'd mole away;

 At night I supped with him at the  <Q> Mitre</Q>  tavern, that we might renew our social intimacy at the original place of meeting. But there was now considerable difference in his way of living. Having had an illness, in which he was advised to leave off wine, he had, from that period, continued to abstain from it, and drank only water or lemonade.</QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>Mr. Beauclerk and I,</QUOTE> says Boswell, in another place, <QUOTE>called on him in the morning. As we walked up Johnson's Court, I said,  <Q> I have a veneration for this court,</Q>  and was glad to find that Beauclerk had the same reverential enthusiasm.</QUOTE> The Doctor's removal Boswell thus duly chronicles:-- <QUOTE>Having arrived,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>in London late on Friday, the <datestruct VALUE="1776-03-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1776">1776</year></datestruct>, I hastened next morning to wait on D.

My reflection at the time, upon this change, as marked in my journal, is as follows:  <Q>I felt a foolish regret that he had left a court which bore his name; but it was not foolish to be affected with some tenderness of regard for a place in which I had seen him a great deal, from whence I had often issued a better and a happier man than when I went in; and which had often appeared to my imagination, while I trod its pavement in the solemn darkness of the night, to be sacred to wisdom and piety.</Q> </QUOTE>
<p>Johnson was living at Johnson's Court when he was introduced to George III., an interview in which he conducted himself, considering he was an ingrained Jacobite, with great dignity, selfrespect, and good sense.
<p>That clever, but most shameless and scurrilous, paper, <title>John Bull</title>, was started in Johnson's Court, at the close of <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.110.1">Theodore Hook</lemma> was chosen editor, because he knew society, was quick, witty, satirical, and thoroughly unscrupulous. For his <QUOTE>splendid abuse</QUOTE> --as his biographer, the unreverend Mr. Barham, calls it-he received the full pay of a greedy hireling. Tom Moore and the Whigs now met with a terrible adversary. Hook did not hew or stab, like Churchill and the old rough lampooners of earlier days, but he filled crackers with wild fire, or laughingly stuck the enemies of George IV. over with pins. Hook had only a year before returned from the Treasuryship of the Mauritius, charged with a defalcation of <measure value="15000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="15000">15,000</num></measure>-the result of the grossest and most culpable neglect. Hungry for money, as he had ever been, he was eager to show his zeal for the master who had hired his pen. Hook and Daniel Terry, the comedian, joined to start the new satirical paper; but Miller, a publisher in the Burlington Arcade, was naturally afraid of libel, and refused to have anything to do with the new venture. With Miller, as Hook said in his clever, punning way, all argument in favour of it proved Newgate-ory. Hook at <num value="1">first</num> wanted to start a magazine upon the model of <title>Blackwood,</title>
but the final decision was for a weekly newspaper, to be called <title>John Bull</title>, a title already discussed for a previous scheme by Hook and Elliston. The <num value="1">first</num> number appeared on Saturday, <datestruct VALUE="1820-12-16"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=16>16</day>, <year reg=1820>1820</year></datestruct>, in the publishing office, No. ii, Johnson's Court., The modest-projectors only printed <num value="750">seven hundred and fifty</num> copies of the <num value="1">first</num> number, but the sale proved considerable. By the <num value="6">sixth</num> week the sale had reached <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> weekly. The <num value="1">first</num> <num value="5">five</num> numbers were reprinted, and the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="2">two</num> actually stereotyped.
<p>Hook's favourite axiom-worthy of such a satirist--was <QUOTE>that there was always a concealed wound in every family, and the point was to strike exactly at the source of pain.</QUOTE> Hook's clerical elder brother, Dr. James Hook, the author of <QUOTE>Pen Owen</QUOTE> and other novels, and afterwards Dean of Worcester, assisted him; but Terry was too busy in what Sir Walter Scott, his great friend and sleeping partner, used to call <QUOTE><hi>Terry</hi>fying the novelists by not very brilliant adaptations of their works.</QUOTE> Dr. Maginn, summoned from Cork to edit a newspaper for Hook (who had bought up <num value="2">two</num> dying newspapers for the small expenditure of <num value="300">three hundred</num> guineas), wrote only <num value="1">one</num> article for the <title>Bull</title>. Mr. Haynes Bayley contributed some of <pb id="p.111" n="111"> his graceful verses, and Ingoldsby (Barham) some of his rather ribald fun. The anonymous editor of
<title>John Bull</title> became for a time as much talked about as Junius in earlier times. By many witty James Smith was suspected, but his fun had not malignity enough for the Tory purposes of those bitter days. Latterly Hook let Alderman Wood alone, and set all his staff on Hume, the great economist, and the Hon. Henry Grey Bennett.
<p>Several prosecutions followed, says Mr. Barham, that for libel on the Queen among the rest; but the grand attempt on the part of the Whigs to crush the paper was not made till the <datestruct VALUE="1821-05-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>. A shortand insignificant paragraph, containing some observations upon the Hon. Henry Grey Bennett, a brother of Lord Tankerville's, was selected for attack, as involving a breach of privilege; in consequence of which the printer, Mr. H. F. Cooper, the editor, and Mr. Shackell were ordered to attend at the bar of the House of Commons. A long debate ensued, during which Ministers made as fair a stand as the nature of the case would admit in behalf of their guerrilla allies, but which terminated at length in the committal of Cooper to Newgate, where he was detained from the <datestruct value="05-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct> till the <datestruct value="07-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, when Parliament was prorogued.
<p>Meanwhile the most strenuous exertions were made to detect the real delinquents-for, of course, honourable gentlemen were not to be imposed upon by the unfortunate <QUOTE>men of straw</QUOTE> who had fallen into their clutches, and who, by the way, suffered for an offence of which their judges and accusers openly proclaimed them to be not only innocent, but incapable. The terror of imprisonment and the various arts of crossexamina- tion proving insufficient to elicit the truth, recourse was had to a simpler and more conciliatory mode of treatment-bribery. The storm had failed to force off the editorial cloak--the golden beams were brought to bear upon it. We have it for certain that an offer was made to a member of the establishment to stay all impending proceedings, and, further, to pay down a sum of <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> on the names of the actual writers being given up. It was rejected with disdain, while such were the precautions taken that it was impossible to fix Hook, though suspicion began to be awakened, with any share in the concern. In order, also, to cross the scent already hit off, and announced by sundry deep-mouthed pursuers, the following <QUOTE>Reply</QUOTE> --framed upon the principle, we presume, that in literature, as in love, everything is fair--was thrown out in an early number:--
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Mr. Theodore Hook.

<p>The conceit of some people is amazing, and it has not been unfrequently remarked that conceit is in abundance where talent is most scarce. Our readers will see that we have received a letter from Mr. Hook, disowning and disavowing all connection with this paper. Partly out of good nature, and partly from an anxiety to show the gentleman how little desirous we are to be associated with him, we have made a declaration which will doubtless be quite satisfactory to his morbid sensibility and affected squeamishness. We are free to confess that <num value="2">two</num> things surprise us in this business; the <num value="1">first</num>, that anything which we have thought worth giving to the public should have been mistaken for Mr. Hook's; and, secondly that <hi rend=italics>such a person</hi> as Mr. Hook should think himself disgraced by a connection with <title>John Bull.</title></quote>

<p>For sheer impudence this, perhaps, may be admitted to <QUOTE>defy competition</QUOTE> ; but in point of tact and delicacy of finish it falls infinitely short of a subsequent notice, a perfect gem of its class, added by way of clenching the denial :--
<p><QUOTE rend=blockquote>We have received Mr. Theodore Hook's <num value="2">second</num> letter. We are ready to confess that we may have appeared to treat him too unceremoniously, but we will put it to his own feelings whether the terms of his denial were not, in some degree, calculated to produce a little asperity on our part. We shall never be ashamed, however, to do justice, and we readily declare that we meant no kind of imputation on Mr. Hook's personal character.</QUOTE>

<p>The ruse answered for awhile, and the paper went on with unabated audacity.
<p>The death of the Queen, in the summer of <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>, produced a decided alteration in the tone and temper of the paper. In point of fact its occupation was now gone. The main, if not the sole, object of its establishment had been brought about by other and unforeseen events. The combination it had laboured so energetically to thwart was now dissolved by a higher and resistless agency. Still, it is not to be supposed that a machine which brought in a proft of something above <measure value="4000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4000">4,000</num></measure> per annum, half of which fell to the share of Hook, was to be lightly thrown up, simply because its original purpose was attained. The dissolution of the <QUOTE>League</QUOTE> did not exist then as a precedent. The Queen was no longer to be feared; but there were Whigs and Radicals enough to be held in check, and, above all, there was a handsome income to be realised.
<P> <QUOTE>Latterly Hook's desultory nature made him <pb id="p.112" n="112"> wander from the <title>Bull</title>, which might have furnished the thoughtless and heartless man of pleasure with an income for life. The paper naturally lost sap and vigour, at once declined in sale, and sank into a mere respectable club-house and party organ.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Mr. Hook,</QUOTE> says Barham, <QUOTE>received to the day of his death a fixed salary, but the proprietorship had long since passed into other hands.</QUOTE>

</list></argument>

<p>Of all the nooks of London associated with the memory of that good giant of literature, Dr. Johnson, not <num value="1">one</num> is more sacred to those who love that great and wise man than Bolt Court. To this monastic court Johnson came in <datestruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></datestruct>, and remained till that December day in <datestruct value="1784--"><year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct>, when a procession of all the learned and worthy men who honoured him followed his body to its grave in the Abbey, near the feet of Shakespeare and by the side of Garrick. The great scholar, whose ways and sayings, whose rough hide and tender heart, are so familiar to us-thanks to that faithful parasite who secured an immortality by getting up behind his triumphal chariot--came to Bolt Court from Johnson's Court, whither he had flitted from Inner Temple Lane, where he was living when the young Scotch barrister who was afterwards his biographer <num value="1">first</num> knew him. His strange household of fretful and disappointed almspeople seems as well known as our own. At the head of these pensioners was the daughter of a Welsh doctor, (a blind old lady named Williams), who had written some trivial poems; Mrs. Desmoulins, an old Staffordshire lady, her daughter, and a Miss Carmichael. The relationships of these fretful and quarrelsome old maids Dr. Johnson has himself sketched, in a letter to Mr. and Mrs. Thrale:-- <QUOTE>Williams hates everybody; Levett hates Desmoulins, and does not love Williams; Desmoulins hates them both; Poll (Miss Carmichael) loves none of them.</QUOTE> his Levett was a poor eccentric apothecary, whom Johnson supported, and who seems to have been a charitable man.
<NOTE resp=B>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.112.1">Johnson Club</lemma></NOTE>

<p>The annoyance of such a menagerie of angular oddities must have driven Johnson more than ever to his clubs, where he could wrestle with the best intellects of the day, and generally retire victorious. He had done nearly all his best work by this time, and was sinking into the sere and yellow leaf, not, like Macbeth, with the loss of honour, but with love, obedience, troops of friends, and golden opinions from all sorts of people. His Titanic labour, the Dictionary, he had achieved chiefly in Gough Square; his <title>Rasselas</title>-that grave and wise Oriental story-he had written in a few days, in Staple's Inn, to defray the expenses of his mother's funeral. In Bolt Court he, however, produced his <title>Lives of the Poets,</title> a noble compendium of criticism, defaced only by the bitter Tory depreciation of Milton, and injured by the insertion of many worthless and the omission of several good poets.
<p>It is pleasant to think of some of the events that happened
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.112.2">while Johnson lived in Bolt Court.</lemma>
Here he exerted himself with all the ardour of his nature to soothe the last moments of that wretched man,Dr. Dodd, who was hanged for forgery. From Bolt Court he made those frequent excursions to the Thrales, at Streatham, where the rich brewer and his brilliant wife gloried in the great London lion they had captured. To Bolt Court came Johnson's friends Reynolds and Gibbon, and Garrick, and Percy, and Langton; but poor Goldsmith had died before Johnson left Johnson's Court. To Bolt Court he stalked home the night of his memorable quarrel with Dr. Percy, no doubt regretting the violence and boisterous rudeness with which he had attacked an amiable and gifted man. From Bolt Court he walked to service at St. Clement's Church on the day he rejoiced in comparing the animation of Fleet Street with the desolation of the Hebrides. It was from Bolt Court Boswell drove Johnson to dine with General Paoli, a drive memorable for the fact that on that occasion Johnson uttered his <num value="1">first</num> and only recorded pun.
<p>Johnson was at Bolt Court when the Gordon Riots broke out, and he describes them to Mrs. Thrale. <pb id="p.113" n="113"> Boswell gives a pleasant sketch of
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.113.3">a party at Bolt Court</LEMMA>, when Mrs. Hall (a sister of Wesley) was there, and Mr. Allen, a printer; Johnson produced his silver salvers, and it was <QUOTE>a great day.</QUOTE> It was on this occasion that the conversation fell on apparitions, and Johnson, always superstitious to the last degree, told the story of hearing his mother's voice call him <num value="1">one</num> day at Oxford (probably at a time when his brain was overworked). On this great occasion also, Johnson, talked at by Mrs. Hall and Mrs. Williams at the same moment, gaily quoted the line from the
<title>Beggars' Opera</title>,--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>But <num value="2">two</num> at a time there's no mortal can bear,</QUOTE>
and Boswell playfully compared the great man to Captain Macheath. Imagine Mrs. Williams, old and peevish; Mrs. Hall, lean, lank, and preachy; Johnson, rolling in his chair like Polyphemus at a debate; Boswell, stooping forward on the perpetual listen; Mr. Levett, sour and silent; Frank, the black servant, proud of the silver salvers--and you have the group as in a picture.
<p>In Bolt Court we find Johnson now returning from pleasant, dinners with Wilkes and Garrick, Malone and Dr. Burney; now sitting alone over his Greek Testament, or praying with his black servant, Frank. We like to picture him on that Good Friday morning (<datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>), when he and Boswell, returning from service at St. Clement's, rested on the stone seat at the garden-door in Bolt Court, talking about gardens and country hospitality.
<p>Then, finally, we come to almost the last scene of all, when the sick man addressed to his kind physician, Brocklesby, that pathetic passage of Shakespeare's,--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased;
<L>Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow;
<L>Raze out the written troubles of the brain;
<L>And with some sweet oblivious antidote
<L>Cleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous stuff
<L>Which weighs upon the heart?</QUOTE>
 Round Johnson's dying bed gathered many wise and good men. To Burke he said, <QUOTE>I must be in a wretched state indeed, when your company would not be a delight to me.</QUOTE> To another friend he remarked solemnly, but in his old grandmanner, <QUOTE>Sir, you cannot conceive with what acceleration I advance towards death.</QUOTE> Nor did his old vehemence and humour by any means forsake him, for he described a man who sat up to watch him <QUOTE>as an idiot, sir; awkward as a turnspit when <num value="1">first</num> put into the wheel, and sleepy as a dormouse.</QUOTE> His remaining hours were spent in fervent prayer. The last words he uttered were those of bencdiction upon the daughter of a friend whojcame to ask his blessing.
<p>Some years before Dr. Johnson's death, when the poet
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.113.2">Rogers</lemma><NOTE resp=B>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.113.1">Rogers' House</lemma></NOTE> was a young clerk of literry proclivities a his father's bank, he <num value="1">one</num> day stole surreptitiously to Bolt Court, to daringly show some of his fledgeling poems to the great Polyphemus of literature. He and young Maltby, an ancestor of the late Bishop of Durham, crept blushingly through the quiet court, and on arriving at the sacred door on the west side, ascended the steps and knocked at the door; but the awful echo of that knocker struck terror to the young <foreign lang=fr>d&eacute;butants</foreign>&lsquo; hearts, and before Frank Barber, the Doctor's old negro footman, could appear, the <num value="2">two</num> lads, like street-boys who had perpetrated a mischievous runaway knock, took to their heels and darted back into noisy Fleet Street. Mr. Jesse, who has collected so many excellent anecdotes, some even original, in his <num value="3">three</num> large volumes on <title>London's Celebrated Characters and Places,</title> says that the elder Mr. Disraeli, singularly enough, used in society to relate an almost similar adventure as a youth. Eager for literary glory, but urged towards the counter by his sober-minded relations, he enclosed some of his best verses to the celebrated Dr. Johnson, and modestly solicited from the terrible critic an opinion of their value. Having waited some time in vain for a reply, the ambitious Jewish youth at last (<datestruct VALUE="1784-12-13"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=13>13</day>, <year reg=1784>1784</year></datestruct>) resolved to face the lion in his den, and rapping tremblingly (as his predecessor, Rogers), heard with dismay the knocker echo on the metal. We may imagine the feelings of the young votary at the shrine of learning, when the servant (probably Frank Barber), who slowly opened the door, informed him that Dr. Johnson had breathed his last only a few short hours before.
<p>Mr. Timbs reminds us of another story of Dr. Johnson, which will not be out of place here. It is an excellent illustration of the keen sagacity and forethought of that great man's mind. <num value="1">One</num> evening Mr. Johnson, looking from his dim Bolt Court window, saw the slovenly lamp-lighter of those days ascending a ladder (just as Hogarth has drawn him in the <title>Rake's Progress</title>), and fill the little receptacle in the globular lamp with detestable whale-oil. Just as he got down the ladder the dull light wavered out. Skipping up the ladder again, the son of Prometheus lifted the cover, thrust the torch he carried into the heated vapour rising from the wick, and instantly the ready flame sprang restored to life. <QUOTE>Ah,</QUOTE> said the old seer, <QUOTE><num value="1">one</num> of these days the streets of London will be lighted by smoke,</QUOTE> <pb id="p.114" n="114">
<p>Johnson's house (No. <num value="8">8</num>), according to Mr. Noble, was not destroyed by fire in <datestruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></datestruct>, as Mr. Timbs and other writers assert. The house destroyed was Bensley the printer's (next door to No. <num value="8">8</num>), the successor of Johnson's friend, Allen, who in <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct> published Manning's Saxon, Gothic, and Latin Dictionary, and died in <num value="780">780</num>. In Bensley's destructive fire all the plates and stock of Dallaway's
<title>History of Sussex</title> were consumed. Johnson's house, says Mr. Noble, was in <datestruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct> purchased by the Stationers' Company, and fitted up as a cheap school (<measure value="6s." type=currency><num value="6">six</num> shillings</measure> a quarter). In <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct> Mr. Foss, Master of the Company, initiated a fund, and since then a university scholarship has been founded--

<foreign lang=la>sic itur ad astra</foreign>. The back room, <num value="1">first</num> floor, in which the great man died, had been pulled down by Mr. Bensley, to make way for a staircase.

<p>At <QUOTE>Dr. Johnson's</QUOTE> tavern, established <num value="40">forty</num> years ago (now the Albert Club), the well-known society of the <QUOTE>Lumber Troop</QUOTE> once drained their porter and held their solemn smokings. This gallant force of supposititious fighting men <QUOTE>came out</QUOTE> with great force during the Reform Riots of <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>. These useless disturbances originated in a fussy, foolish warning letter, written by John Key, the Lord Mayor elect (he was generally known in the City as Don <pb id="p.115" n="115">

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.116.4">Duchess of Wellington</lemma></NOTE> then as terribly unpopular with the English Reformers as he had been with the French after the battle of Waterloo, urging him (the duke) if he came with
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.116.2">King William</lemma> and Queen Adelaide to dine with the new Lord Mayor, (his worshipful self), to come <QUOTE>strongly and sufficiently guarded.</QUOTE> This imprudent step greatly offended the people, who were also just then much vexed with the severities of Peel's obnoxious new police. The result was that the new king and queen (for the not overbeloved George IV. had only died in June of that year) thought it better to decline coming to the City festivities altogether. Great, then, was even the Tory indignation, and the fattest alderman trotted about, eager to discuss the grievance, the waste of half-cooked turtle, and the general folly and enormity of the Lord Mayor elect's conduct.
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.116.3">Sir Claudius Hunter</lemma> who had shared in the Lord Mayor's fears, generously marched to his aid. In a published statement that he made, he enumerated the force available for the defence of the (in his mind) endangered City in the following way:--

<p>In the same statement Sir Claudius says:-- <QUOTE>The Lumber Troop are a respectable smoking club, well known to every candidate for a seat in Parliament for London, and most famed for the quantity of tobacco they consume and the porter they drink, which, I believe (from my own observation, made <num value="19">nineteen</num> years ago, when I was a candidate for that office), is the only liquor allowed. They were to have had no pay, and I am sure they would have done their best.</QUOTE>
<p>Along the line of procession, to oppose this civic force, the right worshipful but foolish man reckoned there would be some <num value="150000">150,000</num> persons. With all these aldermanic fears, and all these irritating precautions, a riot naturally took place. On Monday, <datestruct value="11-8"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=8>8th</day></datestruct>, that glib, unsatisfactory man, Orator Hunt, the great demagogue of the day, addressed a Reform meeting at the Rotunda, in Blackfriars Road. At half-past <num value="11">eleven</num>, when the Radical gentleman, famous for his white hat (the lode-star of faction), retired, a man suddenly waved a tricolour flag (it was the year, remember, of the Revolution in Paris), with the word <QUOTE>Reform</QUOTE> painted upon it, and a preconcerted cry was raised by the more violent of, <QUOTE>Now for the West End!</QUOTE> About <num value="1000">one thousand</num> men then rushed over Blackfriars bridge, shouting, <QUOTE>Reform!</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Down with the police!</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>No Peel!</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>No Wellington!</QUOTE> Hurrying along the Strand, the mob <num value="1">first</num> proceeded to Earl Bathurst's, in Downing Street. A foolish gentleman of the house, hearing the cries, came out on the balcony, armed with a brace of pistols, and declared he would fire on the <num value="1">first</num> man who attempted to enter the place. Another gentleman at this moment came out, and very sensibly took the pistols from his friend, on which the mob retired. The rioters were then making for the House of Commons, but were stopped by a strong line of police, just arrived in time from Scotland Yard. <num value="140">One hundred and forty</num> more men soon joined the constables, and a general fight ensued, in which many heads were quickly broken, and the Reform flag was captured. <num value="3">Three</num> of the rioters were arrested, and taken to the watch-house in the Almonry in Westminster. A troop of Royal Horse Guards (blue) remained during the night ready in the court of the Horse Guards, and bands of policemen paraded the streets.
<p>On Tuesday the riots continued. About halfpast <measure value="5d." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> p.</measure>m., <num value="300">300</num> or <num value="400">400</num> persons, chiefly boys, came along the Strand, shouting, <QUOTE>No Peel!</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Down with the raw lobsters!</QUOTE> (the new police); <QUOTE>This way, my lads; we'll give it them!</QUOTE> At the back of the menageries at Charing Cross the police rushed upon them, and after a skirmish put them to flight. At <num value="7">seven</num> o'clock the vast crowd by Temple Bar compelled every coachman and passenger in a coach, as a passport, to pull off his hat and shout <QUOTE>Huzza!</QUOTE> Stones were thrown, and attempts were made to close the gates of the Bar. The City marshals, however, compelled them to be reopened, and opposed the passage of the mob to the Strand, but the pass was soon forced. The rioters in Pickett Place pelted the police with stones and pieces of wood, broken from the scaffolding of the Law Institute, then building in Chancery Lane. Another mob of about <num value="500">500</num> persons ran up Piccadilly to Apsley House and hissed and hooted the stubborn, unprogressive old Duke, Mr. Peel, and the police; the constables, however, soon dispersed them. The same evening dangerous mobs collected in Bethnal Green, Spitalfields, and Whitechapel, <num value="1">one</num> party of them displaying tricoloured flags. They broke <pb id="p.117" n="117"> a lamp and a window or <num value="2">two</num>, but did little else. Alas for poor Sir Claudius and his profound computations! His <num value="2284">2,284</num> fighting loyal men dwindled down to <num value="600">600</num>, including even those strange hybrids, the firemen-watermen; and as for the gallant Lumber Troop, they were nowhere visible to the naked eye.
<p>To Bolt Court that scourge of King George III.,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.117.1">William Cobbett</lemma>, came from Fleet Street to sell his Indian corn, for which no <num value="1">one</num> cared, and to print and publish his twopenny <title>Political Register</title>, for which the London Radicals of that day hungered. Nearly opposite the office of <QUOTE>this good hater,</QUOTE> says Mr. Timbs, Wright (late Kearsley) kept shop, and published a searching criticism on Cobbett's excellent English Grammar as soon as it appeared. We only wonder that Cobbett did not reply to him as Johnson did to a friend after he knocked Osborne (the grubbing bookseller of Gray's Inn Gate) down with a blow- <QUOTE>Sir, he was impertinent, and I beat him.</QUOTE>
<p>A short biographical sketch of Cobbett will not be inappropriate here. This sturdy Englishman, born in the year <datestruct value="1762"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>, was the son of an honest and industrious yeoman, who kept an inn called the <QUOTE>Jolly Farmer,</QUOTE> at Farnham, in Surrey. <QUOTE>My <num value="1">first</num> occupation,</QUOTE> says Cobbett, <QUOTE>was driving the small birds from the turnip seed and the rooks from the peas. When I <num value="1">first</num> trudged a-field with my wooden bottle and my satchel over my shoulder, I was hardly able to climb the gates and stiles.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct> the restless lad (a plant grown too high for the pot) ran away to London, and turned lawyer's clerk. At the end of <num value="9">nine</num> months he enlisted, and sailed for Nova Scotia. Before long he became sergeant-major, over the heads of <num value="30">thirty</num> other non-commissioned officers. Frugal and diligent, the young soldier soon educated himself. Discharged at his own request in <datestruct value="1791--"><year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>, he married a respectable girl, to whom he had before entrusted <measure value="150l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="150">150</num></measure> hard-earned savings. Obtaining a trial against <num value="4">four</num> officers of his late regiment for embezzlement of stores, for some strange reason Cobbett fled to France on the eve of the trial, but finding the king of that country dethroned, he started at once for America. At Philadelphia he boldly began as a high Tory bookseller, and denounced Democracy in his virulent <QUOTE>Porcupine Papers.</QUOTE> Finally, overwhelmed with actions for libel, Cobbett in <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct> returned to England. Failing with a daily paper and a bookseller's shop, Cobbett then started his <title>Weekly Register</title>, which for <num value="30">thirty</num> years continued to express the changes of his honest but impulsive and vindictive mind. Gradually--it is said, owing to some slight shown him by Pitt (more probably from real conviction)- Cobbett grew Radical and progressive, and in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct> was fined <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> for libels on the Irish Government. In <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct> he was fined <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> and imprisoned <num value="2">two</num> years for violent remarks about some Ely militiamen who had been flogged under a guard of fixed bayonets. This punishment he never forgave. He followed up his <title>Register</title> by his <title>Twopenny Trash,</title>
of which he eventually sold <num value="100000">100,000</num> a number. The <num value="6">Six</num> Acts being passed--as he boasted, to gag him-he fled, in <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>, again to America. The persecuted man returned to England in <datestruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></datestruct>, bringing with him, much to the amusement of the Tory lampooners, the bones of that foul man,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.117.2">Tom Paine</lemma>, the infidel, whom (in <datestruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>) this changeful politician had branded as <QUOTE>base, malignant, treacherous, unnatural, and blasphemous.</QUOTE> During the Queen Caroline trial Cobbett worked heart and soul for that questionable martyr. He went out to Shooter's Hill to welcome her to London, and boasted of having waved a laurel bough above her head.
<p>In <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct> he wrote a scurrilous <title>History of the Reformation</title> (by many still attributed to a priest), in which he declared Luther, Calvin, and Beza to be the greatest ruffians that ever disgraced the world. In his old age, too late to be either brilliant or useful, Cobbett got into Parliament, being returned in <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct> (thanks to the Reform Bill) member for Oldham. He died at his house near Farnham, in <datestruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct>. Cobbett was an egotist, it must be allowed, and a violent-tempered, vindictive man; but his honesty, his love of truth and liberty, few who are not blinded by party opinion can doubt. His writings are remarkable for vigorous and racy Saxon, as full of vituperation as Rabelais's, and as terse and simple as Swift's.
<p>Mr. Grant, in his pleasant book, <title>Random Recollections of the House of Commons,</title> written
 <hi rend=italics>circa</hi> <datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>, gives us an elaborate full-length portrait of old Cobbett. He was, he says, not less than <num value="6">six</num> feet high, and broad and athletic in proportion. His hair was silver-white, his complexion ruddy as a farmer's. Till his small eyes sparkled with laughter, he looked a mere dullpated clodpole. His dress was a light, loose, grey tail-coat, a white waistcoat, and sandy kerseymere breeches, and he usually walked about the House with both his hands plunged into his breeches pockets. He had an eccentric, half-malicious way of sometimes suddenly shifting his seat, and on <num value="1">one</num> important night, big with the fate of Peel's Administration, deliberately anchored down in the very centre of the disgusted Tories and at the very back of Sir Robert's bench, to the infinite annoy Dance of the somewhat supercilious party. <pb id="p.118" n="118">
<p>We next penetrate into Gough Square, in search of the great lexicographer.
<p>As far as can be ascertained from Boswell, Mr. Johnson resided at Gough Square from <datestruct value="1748--"><year reg="1748">1748</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1758--"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct>, an eventful period of his life, and <num value="1">one</num> of struggle, pain, and difficulty. In this gloomy side square near Fleet Street, he achieved many results and abandoned many hopes. Here he nursed his hypochondria--the nightmare of his life --and sought the only true relief in hard work. Here he toiled over books, drudging for Cave and Dodsley. Here he commenced both the
 <title>Rambler</title> and the <title>Idler</title>, and formed his acquaintance with Bennet Langton. Here his wife died, and left him more than ever a prey to his natural melancholy; and here he toiled on his great work, the Dictionary, in which he and <num value="6">six</num> amanuenses effected what it took all the French Academicians to perform for their language.
<p>A short epitome of what this great man accomplished while in
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.118.1">Gough Square</LEMMA> will clearly recall to our readers his way of life while in that locality. n <datestruct value="1749--"><year reg="1749">1749</year></datestruct>, Johnson formed a quiet club in Ivy Lane, wrote that fine paraphrase of Juvenal,
<title>The Vanity of Human Wishes,</title> and brought out, with dubious success, under Garrick's auspices, his tragedy of <title>Irene</title>. In <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>, he commenced the <title>Rambler</title>. In <datestruct value="1752--"><year reg="1752">1752</year></datestruct>, the year his wife died, he laboured on at the Dictionary. In <datestruct value="1753--"><year reg="1753">1753</year></datestruct>, he became acquainted with Bennet Langton. In <datestruct value="1754--"><year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct> he wrote the life of his early patron, Cave, who died that year. In <datestruct value="1755--"><year reg="1755">1755</year></datestruct>, the great Dictionary, begun in <datestruct value="1747--"><year reg="1747">1747</year></datestruct>, was at last published, and Johnson wrote that scathing letter to the Earl of Chesterfield, who, too late, thrust upon him the patronage the poor scholar had once sought in vain. In <datestruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>, the still struggling man was arrested for a paltry debt of &pound;.<num value="5">5</num> <measure value="8s." type=currency><num value="8">8</num>s.</measure>, from which Richardson the worthy relieved him. In <datestruct value="1758--"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct>, when he began the <title>Idler</title>, Johnson is described as <QUOTE>being in as easy and pleasant a state of existence as constitutional unhappiness ever permitted him to enjoy.</QUOTE>
<p>While the Dictionary was going forward, <QUOTE>Johnson,</QUOTE> says Boswell, <QUOTE>lived part of the time in Holborn, part in Gough Square (Fleet Street); and he had an upper room fitted up like a countinghouse for the purpose, in which he gave to the copyists their several tasks. The words, partly taken from other dictionaries and partly supplied by himself, having been <num value="1">first</num> written down with space left between them, he delivered in writing their etymologies, definitions, and various significations. The authorities were copied from the books themselves, in which he had marked the, passages with a black-lead pencil, the traces of which could be easily effaced. I have seen several of them in which that trouble had not been taken, so that they were just as when used by the copyists. It is remarkable that he was so attentive to the choice of the passages in which words were authorised, that <num value="1">one</num> may read page after page of his Dictionary with improvement and pleasure; and it should not pass unobserved, that he has quoted no author whose writings had a tendency to hurt sound religion and morality.</QUOTE>
<p>To this account Bishop Percy adds a note of great value for its lucid exactitude. <QUOTE>Boswell's account of the manner in which Johnson compiled his. Dictionary,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>is confused and erroneous. He began his task (as he himself expressly described to me) by devoting his <num value="1">first</num> care to a diligent perusal of all such English writers as were most correct in their language, and under every sentence which he meant to quote he drew a line, and noted in the margin the <num value="1">first</num> letter of the word under which'it was to occur. He then delivered these books to his clerks, who transcribed each sentence on a separate slip of paper and arranged the same under the word referred to. By these means he collected the several words, and their different significations, and when the whole arrangement was alphabetically formed, he gave the definitions of their meanings, and collected their etymologies from Skinner, and other writers on the subject.</QUOTE> To these accounts, Hawkins adds his usual carping, pompous testimony. <QUOTE>Dr. Johnson,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>who, before this time, together with his wife, had lived in obscurity, lodging at different houses in the courts and alleys in and about the Strand and Fleet Street, had, for the purpose of carrying on this arduous work, and being near the printers employed in it, taken a handsome house in Gough Square, and fitted up a room in it with books and other accommodations for amanuenses, who, to the number of <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num>, he kept constantly under his eye. An interleaved copy of <title>Bailey's Dictionary</title>, in folio, he made the repository of the several articles, and these he collected by incessantly reading the best authors in our language, in the practice whereof his method was to score with a black-lead pencil the words by him selected. The books he used for this purpose were what he had in his own collection, a copious but a miserably ragged <num value="1">one</num>, and all such as he could borrow; which latter, if ever they came back to those that lent them, were so defaced as to be scarce worth owning, and yet some of his friends were glad to receive and entertain them as curiosities.</QUOTE> <pb id="p.119" n="119">
<p> <QUOTE>Mr. Burney,</QUOTE> says Boswell, <QUOTE>during a visit to the capital, had an interview with Johnson in Gough Square, where he dined and drank tea with him, and was introduced to the acquaintance of Mrs. Williams. After dinner Mr. Johnson proposed to Mr. Burney to go up with him into his garret, which being accepted, he found there about <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> Greek folios, a poor writing-desk, and a chair and a half. Johnson, giving to his guest the entire seat, balanced himself on <num value="1">one</num> with only <num value="3">three</num> legs and <num value="1">one</num> arm. Here he gave Mr. Burney Mrs. Williams's history, and showed him some notes on Shakespeare already printed, to prove that he was in earnest. Upon Mr. Burney's opening the <num value="1">first</num> volume at the <title>Merchant of Venice</title> he observed to him that he seemed to be more severe on Warburton than on Theobald.  <Q>Oh, poor Tib!</Q>  said Johnson,  <Q>he. was nearly knocked down to my hands; Warburton stands between me and him.</Q>   <Q> But, sir,</Q>  said Mr. Burney,  <Q>You'll have Warburton on your bones, won't you?</Q>   <Q>No, sir; he'll not come out; he'll only growl in his den.</Q>   <Q>But do you think, sir, Warburton is a superior critic to Theobald?</Q>   <Q>Oh, sir, he'll make <num value="2">two</num>-and-<num value="50">fifty</num> Theobalds cut into slices! The worst of Warburton is that he has a rage for saying something when there's nothing to be said.</Q>  Mr. Burney then asked him whether he had seen the letter Warburton had, written in answer to a pamphlet addressed  <Q>to the most impudent man alive.</Q>  He answered in the negative. Mr. Burney told him it was supposed to be written by Mallet. A controversy now raged between the friends of Pope and Bolingbroke, and Warburton and Mallet were the leaders of the several parties. Mr. Burney asked him then if he had seen Warburton's book against Bolingbroke's philosophy!  <Q>No, sir; I have never read Bolingbroke's impiety, and therefore am not. interested about its refutation.</Q> </QUOTE>
<p>Goldsmith appears to have resided at No. <num value="6">6</num>, Wine Office Court from <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>, during which period he earned a precarious livelihood by writing for the booksellers.

<p>It was while living in Wine Office Court that Goldsmith is supposed to have partly written that delightful novel <title>The Vicar of Wakefield,</title> which he had begun at Canonbury Tower. We like to think that, seated at the <QUOTE>Cheese,</QUOTE> he perhaps espied and listened to the worthy but credulous vicar and his gosling son attending to the profound theories of the learned and philosophic but shifty Mr. Jenkinson. We think now by the window, with a cross light upon his coarse Irish features, and his round prominent brow, we see the watchful poet sit eyeing his prey, secretly enjoying the grandiloquence of the swindler and the admiration of the honest country parson.
<p> <QUOTE><num value="1">One</num> day,</QUOTE> says Mrs. Piozzi, <QUOTE>Johnson was called abruptly from our house at Southwark, after dinner, and, returning in about <num value="3">three</num> hours, said he had been with an enraged author, whose landlady pressed him within doors while the bailiffs beset him without; that he was drinking himself drunk with Madeira to drown care, and fretting over a novel which, when finished, was to be his whole fortune; but he could not get it done for distraction, nor dared he stir out of doors to offer it for sale. Mr. Johnson, therefore,</QUOTE> she continues, <QUOTE>sent away the bottle and went to the bookseller, recommending the performance, and devising some immediate relief; which; when he brought back to the writer, the latter called the woman of the house directly to partake of punch and pass their time in merriment. It was not,</QUOTE> she concludes, <QUOTE>till <datestruct value="10"><year reg="10">ten</year></datestruct> years after, I dare say, that something in Dr. Goldsmith's behaviour struck me with an idea that he was the very man; and then Johnson confessed that he was so.</QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>A more scrupulous and patient writer,</QUOTE> says the admirable biographer of the poet, Mr. John Forster, <QUOTE>corrects some inaccuracies of the lively little lady, and professes to give the anecdote authentically from Johnson's own exact narration.  <Q>I received <num value="1">one</num> morning,</Q>  Boswell represents Johnson to have said,  <Q>a message from poor Goldsmith, that he was in great distress, and, as it was not in his power to come to me, begging that I would come to him as soon as possible. I sent him a guinea, and promised to come to him directly. I accordingly went as soon as I was dressed, and found that his landlady had arrested him for his rent, at which he was in a violent passion. I perceived that he had already changed my guinea, and had got a bottle of Madeira and a glass before him. I put the cork into the bottle, desired he would be calm, and began to talk to him of the means by which he might be extricated. He then told me that he had a novel ready for the press, which he produced to me. I looked into it and saw its merits, told the landlady I should soon return, and, having gone to a bookseller, sold it for <measure value="60l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="60">60</num></measure>. I brought Goldsmith the money, and he discharged his rent, not without rating his landlady in a high tone for having used him so ill.</Q> </QUOTE>
<p>The arrest is plainly connected with Newbery's reluctance to make further advances, and of all <pb id="p.120" n="120"> Mrs. Fleming's accounts found among Goldsmith's papers, the only <num value="1">one</num> unsettled is that for the summer months preceding the arrest. The manuscript of the novel seems by both statements (in which the discrepancies are not so great but that Johnson himself may be held accountable for them) to have been produced reluctantly, as a last resource; and it is possible, as Mrs. Piozzi intimates, that it was still regarded as unfinished. But if strong adverse reasons had not existed, Johnson
<FIGURE id="Fig.120" n="2000.06.0044"><HEAD>Gough Square (see page <num value="118">118</num>).</HEAD></FIGURE>
 would surely have carried it to the elder Newbery. He did not do this. He went with it to Francis Newbery, the nephew; does not seem to have given a very brilliant account of the <QUOTE>merit</QUOTE> he had perceived in it-<num value="4">four</num> years after its author's death he told Reynolds that he did not think it would have had much success-and rather witn regard to Goldsmith's immediate want than to any confident sense of the value of the copy, asked and obtained the <measure value="60l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="60">60</num></measure>. <QUOTE>And, sir,</QUOTE> he said afterwards, <pb id="p.121" n="121"> <QUOTE>a sufficient price, too, when it was sold, for then the fame of Goldsmith had not been elevated, as it afterwards was, by his  <Q>Traveller,</Q>  and the bookseller had faint hopes of profit by his bargain.

<p>On the poem, meanwhile, the elder Newbery had consented to speculate, and this circumstance may have made it hopeless to appeal to him with a <num value="2">second</num> work of fancy. For, on that very day of the arrest, <title>The Traveller</title> lay completed in the poet's desk. The dream of <num value="8">eight</num> years, the solace and sustainment'of his exile and poverty, verged at last to fulfilment or extinction, and the hopes and

 fears which centred in it doubtless mingled on that miserable day with the fumes of the Madeira. In the excitement of putting it to press, which followed immediately after, the nameless novel recedes altogether from the view, but will reappear in due time. Johnson approved the verses more than the novel; read the proof-sheets for his friend; substituted here and there, in more emphatic testimony of general approval, a line of his own; prepared a brief but hearty notice for <hi rend=italics>the Critical Review</hi>, which was to appear simultaneously with the poem, and, as the day of publication drew near, bade Goldsmith be of good heart.
<p>Oliver Goldsmith came <num value="1">first</num> to London in <datestruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>, <pb id="p.122" n="122"> a raw Irish student, aged <num value="28">twenty-eight</num>. He was just fresh from Italy and Switzerland. He had heard Voltaire talk, had won a degree at Louvain or Padua, had been <QUOTE>bear leader</QUOTE> to the stingy nephew of a rich pawnbroker, and had played the flute at the door of Flemish peasants for a draught of beer and a crust of bread. No city of golden pavement did London prove to those worn and dusty feet. Almost a beggar had Oliver been, then an apothecary's journeyman and quack doctor; next a reader of proofs for Richardson, the novelist and printer; after that a tormented and jaded usher at a Peckham school; last, and worst of all, a hack writer of articles for Griffith's <title>Monthly Review,</title>
then being opposed by Smollett in arrival publication. In Green Arbour Court Goldsmith spent the roughest part of the toilsome years before he became known to the world. There he formed an acquaintance with Johnson and his set, and wrote essays for Smollett's <title>British Magazine.</title>

<p>Wine Office Court is supposed to have, derived its name from an office where licences to sell wine were formerly issued. <QUOTE>In this court,</QUOTE> says Mr. Noble, <QUOTE>once flourished a fig-tree, planted a century ago by the Vicar of St. Bride's, who resided, with an absence of pride suitable, if not common, to Christianity, at No. <num value="12">12</num>. It was a slip from another exile of a tree, formerly flourishing, in a sooty kind of grandeur, at the sign of the  <Q>Fig Tree,</Q>  in Fleet Street. This tree was struck by lightning in <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>, but slips from the growing stump were planted in <datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>, in various parts of England.</QUOTE>
<p>The old-fashioned and changeless character of the <QUOTE>Cheese,</QUOTE> in whose low-roofed and sanded rooms Goldsmith and Johnson have so often hung up their cocked hats and sat down facing each other to a snug dinner, not unattended with punch, has been capitally sketched by a modern essayist, who possesses a thorough knowledge of the physiology of London. In an admirable paper entitled <QUOTE>Brain Street,</QUOTE> Mr. George Augustus Sala thus describes Wine Office Court and the <QUOTE>
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.122.1">Cheshire Cheese</LEMMA></QUOTE> :--
<p> <QUOTE>The vast establishments,</QUOTE> says Mr. Sala, <QUOTE><p>of Messrs. Pewter & Antimony, typefounders (Alderman Antimony was Lord Mayor in the year &lsquo;<num value="46">46</num>); of Messrs. Quoin, Case, & Chappell, printers to the Board of Blue Cloth; of Messrs. Cutedge  & Treecalf, bookbinders; with the smaller industries of Scawper & Tinttool, wood-engravers; and Treacle, Gluepot, & Lampblack, printing-roller makers, are packed together in the upper part of the court as closely as herrings in a cask. The  <Q> Cheese</Q>  is at the Brain Street end. It is a little lop-sided, wedged--up house, that always reminds you, structurally, of a highshouldered. man with his hands in his pockets. It is full of holes and corners and cupboards and sharp turnings; and in ascending the stairs to the tiny smoking-room you must tread cautiously, if you would not wish to be tripped up by plates and dishes, momentarily deposited there by furious waiters.. The waiters at the  <Q>Cheese</Q>  are always furious. Old customers abound in the comfortable old tavern, in whose sanded-floored eating-rooms a new face is a rarity; and the guests and the waiters are the oldest of familiars. Yet the waiter seldom fails to bite your nose off as a preliminary measure when you proceed to pay him. How should it be otherwise when on that waiter's soul there lies heavy a perpetual sense of injury caused by the savoury odour of steaks, and <Q>muts</Q> to follow; of cheese-bubbling in tiny tins--the  <Q>specialty</Q>  of the house; of floury potatoes and fragrant green peas; of cool salads, and cooler tankards of bitter beer; of extra-creaming stout and <Q>goes</Q> of Cork and  <Q>rack,</Q>  by which is meant gin; and, in the winter-time, of Irish stew and rump-steak pudding, glorious and grateful to every sense? To be compelled to run to and fro with these succulent viands from noon to late at night, without being able to spare time to consume them in comfort--where do waiters dine, and when, and how?--to be continually taking other people's money only for the purpose of handing it to other people--are not these grievances sufficient to crossgrain the temper of the mildest-mannered waiter? Somebody is always in a passion at the  <Q> Cheese :</Q>  either a customer, because there is not fat enough on his  <Q>point </Q> --steak, or because there is too much bone in his mutton-chop; or else the waiter is wroth with the cook; or the landlord with the waiter, or the barmaid with all. Yes, there is a barmaid at the  <Q>Cheese,</Q>  mewed up in a box not much bigger than a birdcage, surrounded by groves of lemons, <Q>ones</Q> of cheese, punch-bowls, and cruets of mushroom-catsup. I should not care to dispute with her, lest she should quoit me over the head with a punch-ladle, having a William-the-<num value="3">Third</num> guinea soldered in the bowl.
<p>Let it be noted in candour that Law finds its way to the  <Q>Cheese</Q>  as well as Literature; but the Law is, as a rule, of the non-combatant and, consequently, harmless order. Literary men who have been called to the bar, but do not practise; briefless young barristers, who do not object to mingling with newspaper men; with a sprinkling of retired solicitors (amazing dogs these for old port-wine; the landlord has some of the same bin which <pb id="p.123" n="123"> served as Hippocrene to Judge Blackstone when he wrote his <title>Commentaries</title>)-these make up the legal element of the  <Q>Cheese.</Q>  Sharp attorneys in practice are not popular there. There is a legend that a process-server once came in at a back door to serve a writ; but being detected by a waiter, was skilfully edged by that wary retainer into Wine Bottle Court, right past the person on whom he was desirous to inflict the  <Q>Victoria, by the grace, &amp;c.</Q>  Once in the court, he was set upon by a mob of inky-faced boys just released from the works of Messrs. Ball, Roller, & Scraper, machine printers, and by the skin of his teeth only escaped being converted into  <Q>pie.</Q> </QUOTE>

<p>Mr. William Sawyer has also written a very admirable sketch of the <QUOTE>Cheese</QUOTE> and its oldfashioned, conservative ways, which we cannot resist quoting:--
<p> <QUOTE>We are a close, conservative, inflexible body --we, the regular frequenters of the  <Q>Cheddar,</Q> </QUOTE> says Mr. Sawyer. <QUOTE><p>No new-fangled notions, new usages, new customs, or new customers for us. We have our history, our traditions, and our observances, all sacred and inviolable. Look around! There is nothing new, gaudy, flippant, or effeminately luxurious here. A small room with heavily-timbered windows. A low planked ceiling. A huge, projecting fire-place, with a great copper boiler always on the simmer, the sight of which might have roused even old John Willett, of the  <Q>Maypole,</Q>  to admiration. High, stiff-backed, inflexible  <Q>settles,</Q>  hard and grainy in texture, box off the guests, half-a-dozen each to a table. Sawdust covers the floor, giving forth that peculiar faint odour which the French avoid by. the use of the vine sawdust with its pleasant aroma. The only ornament in which we indulge is a solitary picture over the mantelpiece, a full-length of a now departed waiter, whom in the long past we caused to be painted, by subscription of the whole room, to commemorate his virtues and our esteem. He is depicted in the scene of his triumphs--in the act of giving change to a customer. We sit bolt upright round our tables, waiting, but not impatient. A time-honoured solemnity is about to be observed, and we, the old stagers, is it for us to precipitate it? There are men in this room who have dined here every day for a quarter of a century --aye, the whisper goes that <num value="1">one</num> man did it even on his wedding-day! In all that time the more staid and well-regulated among us have observed a steady regularity of feeding. <num value="5">Five</num> days in the week we have our <Q> Rotherham steak </Q> --that mystery of mysteries-or our  <Q>chop and chop to follow,</Q>  with the indispensable wedge of Cheddar-unless it is preferred stewed or toasted-and on Saturday decorous variety is afforded in a plate of the worldrenowned  <Q>Cheddar</Q>  pudding. It is of this latter luxury that we are now assembled to partake, and that with all fitting ceremony and observance. As we sit, like pensioners in hall, the silence is broken only by a strange sound, as of a hardly human voice, muttering cabalistic words,  <Q> Ullo mul lum de loodle wumble jum!</Q>  it cries, and we know that chops and potatoes are being ordered for some benighted outsider, ignorant of the fact that it is pudding-day.</QUOTE>

<p><num value="1">One</num> golden thread of association links Shakespeare to Shoe Lane. Slight and frail is the thread, yet it has a double strand. In this narrow sideaisle of Fleet Street, in <datestruct value="1624--"><year reg="1624">1624</year></datestruct>, lived John Florio, the compiler of our <num value="1">first</num> Italian Dictionary. Now <pb id="p.124" n="124"> it is more than probable that our great poet knew this industrious Italian, as we shall presently show. Florio was a Waldensian teacher, no doubt driven to England by religious persecution. He taught French and Italian with success at Oxford, and finally was appointed tutor to that generous-minded, hopeful, and unfortunate Prince Henry, son of James I. Florio's <title>Worlde of Wordes,</title> (a most copious and exact dictionary in Italian and English) was printed in <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>, and published by Arnold Hatfield for Edward Church, and <QUOTE>sold at his shop over against the north door of Paul's Church.</QUOTE> It is dedicated to <QUOTE>The Right Honourable Patrons of Virtue, Patterns of Honour, Roger Earle of Rutland, Henrie Earle of Southampton, and Lucie Countess of Bedford.</QUOTE> In the dedication, worthy of the fantastic author of <QUOTE>Euphues</QUOTE> himself, the author says:-- <QUOTE>My hope springs out of <num value="3">three</num> stems-your Honours' naturall benignitie; your able emploiment of such servitours; and the towardly likeliehood of this spring--all to do you honest service.

<p>And now to connect Florio with Shakespeare. The industrious Savoyard, besides his Dictionaryof great use at a time when the tour to Italy was a necessary completion of a rich gallant's education-translated the Essays of that delightful old Gascon egotist, Montaigne. Now in a copy of Florio's <title>Montaigne</title> there was found some years ago <num value="1">one</num> of the very few genuine Shakespeare signatures. Moreover, as Florio speaks of the Earl of Southampton as his steady patron, we may fairly presume that the great poet, who must have been constantly at Southampton's house, often met there the old Italian master. May not the bard in those conversations have perhaps gathered some hints for the details of <title>Cymbeline</title>, <title>Romeo and Juliet</title>, <title>Othello</title>, or <title>The <num value="2">Two</num> Gentlemen of Verona</title>, and had his attention turned by the old scholar to fresh chapters of Italian story?

This useful debating society--a great resort for local politicians--was founded by Mr. Daniel Mason as long ago as <datestruct value="1755--"><year reg="1755">1755</year></datestruct>, and among its most eminent members it glories in the names of John Wilkes, Judge Keogh, Daniel O&lsquo;Connell, and the eloquent Curran. The word <QUOTE>Coger</QUOTE> does not imply <QUOTE>codger,</QUOTE> or a drinker of cogs, but comes from <foreign lang=la>cogito</foreign>, to cogitate. The Grand, Vice-Grand, and secretary were elected on the night of every <datestruct value="06-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct> by show of hands. The room was open to strangers, but the members had the right to speak <num value="1">first</num>. The society was Republican in the best sense, for side by side with master tradesmen, shopmen, and mechanics, reporters and young barristers gravely sipped their grog, and abstractedly emitted wreathing columns of tobacco-smoke from their pipes. Mr. J. Parkinson has sketched the little parliament very pleasantly in the columns of a contemporary.
<p> <QUOTE>A long low room,</QUOTE> says the writer, <QUOTE><p>like the saloon of a large steamer. Wainscoat dimmed and ornaments tarnished by tobacco-smoke and the lingering dews of steaming compounds. A room with large niches at each end, like shrines for fullgrown saints, <num value="1">one</num> niche containing  <Q>My Grand</Q>  in a framework of shabby gold, the other  <Q> My Grand's Deputy</Q>  in a bordering more substantial. More than <num value="100">one hundred</num> listeners are waiting patiently for My Grand's utterances this Saturday night, and are whiling away the time philosophically with bibulous and nicotian refreshment. The narrow tables of <pb id="p.125" n="125"> the long room are filled with students and performers, and quite a little crowd is congregated at the door and in a room adjacent until places can be found for them in the presence-chamber.  <Q>Established <datestruct value="1755--"><year reg="1755">1755</year></datestruct></Q>  is inscribed on the ornamental signboard above us, and  <Q>Instituted <datestruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct></Q>  on another signboard near. Dingy portraits of departed Grands and Deputies decorate the walls. Punctually at <num value="9">nine</num> My Grand opens the proceedings amid profound silence. The deputy buries himself in his newspaper, and maintains as profound a calm as the Speaker  <Q>in another place.</Q>  The most perfect order is preserved. The Speaker or deputy, who seems t know all about it, rolls silently in his chair: he is a fat dark man, with a small and rather sleepy eye, such as I have seen come to the surface and wink lazily at the fashionable people clustered round a certain tank in the Zoological Gardens. He re-folds his newspaper from time to time until deep in the advertisements. The waiters silently remove empty tumblers and tankards, and replace them full. But My Grand commands profound attention from the room, and a neighbour, who afterwards proved a perfect Boanerges in debate, whispered to us concerning his vast attainments and high literary position.
<p>This chieftain of the Thoughtful Men is, we learn, the leading contributor to a newspaper of large circulation, and under his signature of  <Q>Locksley Hall,</Q>  rouses the sons of toil to a sense of the dignity and rights of labour, and exposes the profligacy and corruption of the rich to the extent of a column and a quarter every week. A shrewd, hard-headed man of business, with a perfect knowledge of what he had to do with a humorous twinkle of the eye, My Grand went steadily through his work, and gave the Thoughtful Men his epitome of the week's intelligence. It seemed clear that the Cogers had either not read the newspapers, or liked to be told what they already knew. They listened with every token of interest to facts which had been published for days, and it seemed difficult to understand how a debate could be carried on when the text admitted so little dispute. But we sadly underrated the capacity of the orators near us. The sound of My Grand's last sentence had not died out when a fresh-coloured, rather aristocratic-looking elderly man, whose white hair was carefully combed and smoothed, and whose appearance and manner suggested a very different arena to the <num value="1">one</num> he waged battle in now, claimed the attention of the Thoughtful ones. Addressing  <Q>Mee Grand</Q>  in the rich and unctuous tones which a Scotchman and Englishman might try for in vain, this orator proceeded, with every profession of respect, to contradict most of the chief's statements, to ridicule his logic, and to compliment him with much irony on his overwhelming goodness to the society  <Q>to which I have the honour to belong. Full of that hard <hi>northern</hi> logic</Q>  (much emphasis on  <Q>northern,</Q>  which was warmly accepted as a hit by the room)- <Q>that hard northern logic which demonstrates everything to its own satisfaction; abounding in that talent which makes you, sir, a leader in politics, a guide in theology, and generally an instructor of the people; yet even you, sir, are perhaps, if I may say so, somewhat deficient in the lighter graces of pathos and humour. Your speech, sir, has commanded the attention of the room. Its close accuracy of style, its exactitude of expression, its consistent argument, and its generally transcendant ability will exercise, I doubt not, an influence which will extend far beyond this chamber, filled as this chamber is by gentlemen of intellect and education, men of the time, who both think and feel, and who make their feelings and their thoughts felt by others. Still, sir,</Q>  and the orator smiles the smile of ineffable superiority,  <Q>grateful as the members of the society you have so kindly alluded to ought to be for your countenance and patronage, it needed not</Q>  (turning to the Thoughtful Men generally, with a sarcastic smile)-- <Q>it needed not even Mee Grand's encomiums to endear this society to its people, and to strengthen their belief in its efficacy in time of trouble, its power to help, to relieve, and to assuage. No, Mee Grand, an authoritee whose dictum even you will accept without dispute--mee Lord Macaulee--that great historian whose undying pages record those struggles and trials of constitutionalism in which the Cogers have borne no mean part--me Lord Macaulee mentions, with a respect and reverence not exceeded by Mee Grand's, utterances of to-night</Q>  (more smiles of mock humility to the room)  <Q> that great association which claims me as an unworthy son. We could, therefore, have dispensed with the recognition given us by Mee Grand; we could afford to wait our time until the nations of the earth are fused by <num value="1">one</num> common wish for each other's benefit, when the principles of Cogerism are spread over the civilised world, when justice reigns supreme, and loving-kindness takes the place of jealousy and hate.</Q>  We looked round the room while these fervid words were being triumphantly rolled forth, and were struck with the calm impassiveness of the listeners. There seemed to be no partisanship either for the speaker or the Grand. Once, when the former was more than usually emphatic in his <pb id="p.126" n="126"> denunciations, a tall pale man, with a Shakespeare forehead, rose suddenly, with a determined air, as if about to fiercely interrupt; but it turned out he only wanted to catch the waiter's eye, and this done, he pointed silently to his empty glass, and remarked, in a hoarse whisper,  <Q> Without sugar, as before.</Q> </QUOTE>

 only to waste his fortune in Royalist plots. He served in the French army, raised a regiment for Louis XIII., and was left for dead at Dunkirk. On his return to England, he found Lucy Sacheverell-his <title>Lucretia,</title> the lady of his love--married, his death having been reported. All went ill. He was again imprisoned, grew penniless, had to borrow, and fell into a consumption from despair for love and loyalty. <QUOTE>Having consumed all his estate,</QUOTE> says Anthony Wood, <QUOTE>he grew very melancholy, which at length brought him into a consumption; became very poor in body and purse, was the object of charity, went in ragged clothes (whereas when he was in his glory he wore cloth of gold and silver), and mostly lodged in obscure and dirty places, more befitting the worst of beggars than poorest of servants.</QUOTE> There is a doubt, however, as to whether Lovelace died in such abject poverty, poor, dependent, and unhappy as he might have been.

<p>In the Cromwell times there resided in Gunpowder Alley, probably to the scorn of poor dying Lovelace, that remarkable cheat and early medium, Lilly the astrologer, the <QUOTE>Sidrophel</QUOTE> of <title>Hudibras.</title>
This rascal, who supplied the King and Parliament alternately with equally veracious predictions, was in youth apprenticed to a mantua-maker in the Strand, and on his master's death married his widow. Lilly studied astrology under <num value="1">one</num> Evans, an ex-clergyman, who told fortunes in Gunpowder Alley. Besotted by the perusal of Cornelius Agrippa and other such trash, Lilly found fools plenty, and the stars, though potent in their spheres, unable to contradict his lies. This artful cheat was consulted as to the most propitious day and hour for Charles's escape from Carisbrook, and was even sent for by the Puritan generals to encourage their men before Colchester. Lilly was a spy of the Parliament, yet at the Restoration professed to disclose the fact that Cornet Joyce had betrayed Charles. Whenever his predictions or his divining-rod failed, he always attributed his failures, as the modern spiritualists, the successors of the old wizards, still conveniently do, to want of faith in the spectators. By means of his own shrewdness, rather than by stellar influence, Lilly obtained many useful friends, among whom we may specially particularise the King of Sweden, Lenthal the Puritan Speaker, Bulstrode, Whitelocke (Cromwell's Minister), and the learned but credulous Elias Ashmole. Lilly's Almanac, the predecessor of Moore's and Zadkiel's, was carried on by him for <num value="6">six</num>-and-<num value="30">thirty</num> years. He claimed to be a special <foreign lang=fr>proteg&eacute;</foreign> of an angel called Salmonaeus, and to have a more than bowing acquaintance with Salmael and Malchidael, the guardian angels of England. Among his works are his autobiography, and his <title>Observations on the Life and Death of Charles, late King of England.</title> The remainder of his effusions are pretentious, mystical, muddle-headed rubbish, half nonsense, half knavery; as <title>The White King's Prophecy,</title>

<title>Supernatural Light,</title> <title>The Starry Messenger,</title>
and <title>Annus Tenebrosus, or the Black Year.</title>
The rogue's starry mantle descended on his adopted son, a tailor, whom he named Merlin Junior. The credulity of the atheistical times of Charles II. is equalled only by that of our own day.
<p>Lilly himself, in his amusing, half-knavish autobiography, has described his <num value="1">first</num> introduction to the Welsh astrologer of Gunpowder Alley:--
<p> <QUOTE>It happened,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>on <num value="1">one</num> Sunday, <datestruct value="1632--"><year reg="1632">1632</year></datestruct>, as myself and a justice of peace's clerk were, before service, discoursing of many things, he chanced to say that such a person was a great scholar--nay, so learned that he could make an almanac, which to me then was strange; <num value="1">one</num> speech begot another, till, at last, he said he could bring me acquainted with <num value="1">one</num> Evans, in Gunpowder Alley, who had formerly lived in Staffordshire, that was an excellent wise man, and studied the black art. The same week after we went to see Mr. Evans. When we came to his house, he, having been drunk the night before, was upon his bed, if it be lawful to call that a bed whereon he then lay. He roused up himself, and after some compliments he was content to instruct me in astrology. I attended his best opportunities for <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> weeks, in which time I could set a figure perfectly. Books he had not any, except Haly,  <Q>De Judiciis Astrorum,</Q>  and Orriganus's  <Q>Ephemerides;</Q>  so that as often as I entered his house I thought I was in <pb id="p.129" n="129"> the wilderness. Now, something of the man. He was by birth a Welshman, a master of arts, and in sacred orders. He had formerly had a cure of souls in Staffordshire, but now was come to try his fortunes at London, being in a manner enforced to fly, for some offences very scandalous committed by him in those parts where he had lately lived; for he gave judgment upon things lost, the only shame of astrology. He was the most saturnine person my eye ever beheld, either before I practised or since; of a middle stature, broad forehead, beetle-browed, thick shoulders, flat-nosed, full lips, down-looked, black, curling, stiff hair, splay-footed. To give him his right, he had the most piercing judgment naturally upon a figure of theft, and many other questions, that I ever met withal; yet for money he would willingly give contrary judgments; was much addicted to debauchery, and then very abusive and quarrelsome; seldom without a black eye or <num value="1">one</num> mischief or other. This is the same
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.129.1">Evans</lemma> who made so many antimonial cups, upon the sale whereof he chiefly subsisted. He understood Latin very well, the Greek tongue not all; he had some arts above and beyond astrology, for he was well versed in the nature of spirits, and had many times used the circular way of invocating, as in the time of our familiarity he told me.</QUOTE>
<p><num value="1">One</num> of Lilly's most impudent attempts to avail himself of demoniacal assistance was when he dug for treasure (like Scott's Dousterswivel) with avid Ramsay, <num value="1">one</num> dark and stormy night, in the cloisters at Westminster.
<p> <QUOTE>Davy Ramsay,</QUOTE> says the arch-rogue, <QUOTE><p>his majesty's clockmaker, had been informed that there was a great quantity of treasure buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey;. he acquaints Dean Williams therewith, who was also then Bishop of Lincoln; the dean gave him liberty to search after it, with this proviso, that if any was discovered his church should have a share of it. Davy Ramsay finds out <num value="1">one</num> John Scott,<NOTE><QUOTE>This Scott lived in Pudding Lane, and had some time been a page (or such-like) to the Lord Norris</QUOTE></NOTE> who pretended the use of the Mosaical rods, to assist him therein. I was desired to join with him, unto which I consented. <num value="1">One</num> winter's night Davy Ramsay,<NOTE><QUOTE>Davy Ramsay brought a half-quartern sack to put the treasure in.</QUOTE></NOTE> with several gentlemen, myself, and Scott, entered the cloisters; upon the west side of the cloisters the rods turned <num value="1">one</num> over another, an argument that the treasure was there. The labourers digged at least <num value="6">six</num> feet deep, and then we met with a coffin, but in regard it was not heavy, we did not open, which we afterwards much repented. From the cloisters we went into the abbey church, where upon a sudden (there being no wind when we began) so fierce, so high, so blustering and loud a wind did rise, that we verily believed the west-end of the church would have fallen upon us; our rods would not move at all; the candles and torches, all but <num value="1">one</num>, were extinguished, or burned very dimly. John Scott, my partner, was amazed, looked pale, knew not what to think or do, until I gave directions and command to dismiss the demons, which when done all was quiet again, and each man returned unto his lodging late, about <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock at night. I could never since be induced to join with any in such-like actions.
<p>The true miscarriage of the business was by reason of so many people being present at the operation, for there was about <num value="30">thirty</num>--some laughing, others deriding us; so that if we had not dismissed the demons, I believe most part of the abbey church had been blown down. Secrecy and intelligent operators, with a strong confidence and knowledge of what they are doing, are best for this work.</QUOTE>

<p>In the last century, when every shop had its sign and London streets were so many outof- door picture-galleries, a Dutchman named Vandertrout opened a manufactory of these pictorial advertisements in Harp Alley, Shoe Lane, a dirty passage now laid open to the sun and air on the east of the new St. Bride's Street, running from Ludgate Circus to Holborn. In ridicule of the spurious black, treacly old masters then profusely offered for sale by the picture-dealers of the day, Hogarth and Bonnell Thornton opened an exhibition of shop-signs. In Nicholls and Stevens'
<title>Life of Hogarth</title> there is a full and racy account of this sarcastic exhibition:--<QUOTE><p>At the entrance of the large passage-room was written,  <Q>N.B. That the merit of the <hi rend=italics>modern masters</hi> may be fairly examined into, it has been thought proper to place some admired works of the most eminent <hi rend=italics>old masters</hi> in this room, and along the passage through the yard.</Q>  Among these are  <Q> A Barge</Q>  in still life, by Vandertrout. He cannot be properly called an English artist; but not being sufficiently encouraged, in his own country, he left Holland with William the <num value="3">Third</num>, and was the <num value="1">first</num> artist who settled in Harp Alley. An original half-length of Camden, the great historian and antiquary, in his herald's coat; by Vandertrout. As this artist was originally colour-grinder to Hans Holbein, it is conjectured there are some of that great master's touches in this piece.  <Q>Nobody, <hi rend=italics>alias</hi> Somebody;</Q>  a character. (The figure of an officer, all head, arms, <pb id="p.130" n="130"> legs, and thighs. This piece has a very odd effect, being so drolly executed that you do not miss the body.)  <Q> Somebody, <hi rend=italics>alias</hi> Nobody,</Q>  a caricature, its companion; both these by Hagarty. (A rosy figure, with a little head and a huge body, whose belly sways over almost quite down to his shoe-buckles. By the staff in his hand, it appears, to be intended to represent a constable. It might else have been intended for an eminent justice of peace.)  <Q>A Perspective View of Billingsgate, or Lectures on Elocution;</Q>  and  <Q> The True Robin Hood Society, a Conversation or Lectures on elocution,</Q>  its companion; these <num value="2">two</num> by Barnsley. (These <num value="2">two</num> strike at a famous lecturer on elocution and the reverend projector of a rhetorical academy, are admirably conceived and executed, and--the latter more especially-almost worthy the hand of Hogarth. They are full of a variety of droll figures, and seem, indeed, to be the work of a great master struggling to suppress his superiority of genius, and endeavouring to paint <hi rend=italics>down</hi> to the common style and manner of sign-painting.)
<p>At the entrance to the <hi rend=italics>grand room</hi> :-- <Q> The Society of Sign Painters take this opportunity of refuting a most malicious suggestion that their exhibition is designed as a ridicule on the exhibitions of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, &amp;c., and of the artists. They intend theirs only as an appendix or (in the style of painters) a companion to the other. There is nothing in their collection which will be understood by any candid person as a reflection on anybody, or any body of men. They are not in the least prompted by any mean jealousy to depreciate the merit of their brother artists. Animated by the same public spirit, their sole view is to convince foreigners, as well as their own blinded countrymen, that however inferior this nation may be unjustly deemed in other branches of the polite arts, the palm for sign-painting must be ceded to us, the Dutch themselves not excepted.</Q>  Projected in <datestruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct> by Mr. Bonnel Thornton, of festive memory; but I am informed that he contributed no otherwise towards this display than by a few touches of chalk. Among the heads of distinguished personages, finding those of the King of Prussia and the Empress of Hungary, he changed the cast of their eyes, so as to make them leer significantly at each other. Note.-These (which in the catalogue are called an original portrait of the present Emperor of Prussia and ditto of the Empress Queen of Hungary, its antagonist) were <num value="2">two</num> old signs of the  <Q>Saracen's Head</Q>  and Queen Anne. Under the <num value="1">first</num> was written  <Q>The Zarr,</Q>  and under the other  <Q>The Empress Quean.</Q>  They were lolling their tongues out at each other; and over their heads ran a wooden label, inscribed,  <Q> The present state of Europe.</Q>

<p>At <num value="98">98</num>, Shoe Lane lived, now some <num value="60">sixty</num> years ago, a tobacconist named Hudson, a great humorist, a fellow of infinite fancy, and the writer of half the comic songs that once amused festive London. Hudson afterwards, we believe, kept the <QUOTE>Kean's Head</QUOTE> tavern, in Russell Court, Drury Lane, and about <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct> had a shop of some kind or other in Museum Street, Bloomsbury. Hudson was <num value="1">one</num> of those professional song-writers and vocalists who used to be engaged to sing at such supper-rooms and theatrical houses as Offley's, in Henrietta Street (north-west end), Covent Garden; the <QUOTE>Coal Hole,</QUOTE> in the Strand; and the <QUOTE>Cider Cellars,</QUOTE> Maiden Lane. Sitting among the company, Hudson used to get up at the call of the chairman and <QUOTE>chant</QUOTE> <num value="1">one</num> of his lively and really witty songs. The platform belongs to <QUOTE>Evans's</QUOTE> and a later period. Hudson was at his best long after Captain Morris's day, and at the time when Moore's melodies were popular. Many of the melodies Hudson parodied very happily, and with considerable tact and taste. Many of Hudson's songs, such as <title>Jack Robinson</title>
(infinitely funnier than most of Dibdin's), became coined into catch-words and street sayings of the day. <QUOTE>Before you could say Jack Robinson</QUOTE> is a phrase, still current, derived from this highly droll song.

<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Says the lady, says she, &lsquo;I've changed my state.&rsquo;
<L>&lsquo;Why, you don't mean,&rsquo; says Jack, &lsquo;that you've got a mate?
<L>You know you promised me.&rsquo; Says she, &lsquo;I couldn't wait,
<L>For no tidings could I gain of you, Jack Robinson.
<L>And somebody <num value="1">one</num> day came to me and said
<L>That somebody else had somewhere read,
<L>In some newspaper, that you was somewhere dead.--
<L>&lsquo;I've not been dead at all,&rsquo; says Jack Robinson.</QUOTE>
 Another song, <title>The Spider and the Fly,</title> is still often sung; and <title>Going to Coronation</title> is by no means forgotten in Yorkshire. <title>There was a Man in the West Countrie</title> figures in most current collections of songs. Hudson particularly excelled in stage-Irishman songs, which were then popular; and some of these, particularly <num value="1">one</num> that ends with <pb id="p.131" n="131"> the refrain, <QUOTE>My brogue and my blarney and bothering ways,</QUOTE> have real humour in them. Many of these Irish songs were written for and sung by the late Mr. Fitzwilliam, the comedian, as others of Hudson's songs were by Mr. Rayner. Collectors of comic ditties will not readily forget <title>Walker, the Twopenny Postman,</title> or <title>The Dogs'-meat Man</title>
--rough caricatures of low life, unstained by the vulgarity of many of the modern music-hall ditties. In the motto to <num value="1">one</num> of his collections of poems, Hudson borrows from Churchill an excuse for the rough, humorous effusions that he scattered broadcast over the town,--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>When the mad fit comes on, I seize the pen,
<L>Rough as they run, the rapid thoughts set down;
<L>Rough as they run, discharge them on the town.
<L>Hence rude, unfinished brats, before their time,
<L>Are born into this idle world of rhyme;
<L>And the poor slattern muse is brought to bed,
<L>With all her imperfections on her head.</QUOTE>
 We subjoin a very good specimen of Hudson's songs, from his once very popular <title>Coronation of William and Adelaide</title> (<datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>), which, we think, will be allowed to fully justify our praise of the author:

<p>Our English bishops, who had not the same taste as the Cistercians in selecting pleasant places for their habitations, seem during the Middle Ages to have much affected the neighbourhood of Fleet Street. Ely Place still marks the residence of <num value="1">one</num> rich prelate. In Chichester Rents we have already met with the humble successors of the netmaker of Galilee. In a siding on the north-west side of hoe Lane the Bishops of Bangor lived, with their spluttering and choleric Welsh retinue, as early as <datestruct value="1378"><year reg="1378">1378</year></datestruct>. Recent improvements have laid open the miserable <QUOTE>close</QUOTE> called Bangor Court that once glowed with the reflections of scarlet hoods and jewelled copes; and a schoolhouse of bastard Tudor architecture, with sham turrets and flimsy mullioned windows, now occupies the site of the Christian prelate's old palace. Bishop Dolben, who died in <datestruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct> (Charles I.), was the last Welsh bishop who deigned to reside in a neighbourhood from which wealth and fashion was fast ebbing. Brayley says that a part of the old episcopal garden, where the ecclesiastical subjects of centuries had been discussed by shaven men and frocked scholars, still existed in <datestruct value="1759--"><year reg="1759">1759</year></datestruct> (George II.); and, indeed, as Mr. Jesse records, even as late as <datestruct value="1828"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct> (George IV.) a portion of the old mansion, once redolent with the stupefying incense of the unreformed Church, still lingered.
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.131.1">Old Bangor House</lemma>, according to Mr. J. T. Smith, is mentioned in the Patent Rolls as early as Edward III.

In <datestruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></datestruct> (Charles I.) Sir John Birkstead purchased of the Parliamentary trustees the bishop's lands, that had probably been confiscated, to build streets upon the site. But Sir John went on paving the old place, and never built at all. Cromwell's Act of <datestruct value="1657--"><year reg="1657">1657</year></datestruct>, to check the increase of London, entailed a special exemption in his favour. At the Restoration the land returned to its Welsh bishop; but it had degenerated: the palace was divided into several residences, and mean buildings sprang up like fungi around it.

<p>Mr. Grant, that veteran of the press, tells a capital story, in his <title>History of the Newspaper Press,</title> about <num value="1">one</num> of the early vendors of unstamped newspapers in Shoe Lane:--
<p> <QUOTE><title>Cleave's Police Gazette</title>,</QUOTE> says Mr. Grant, <QUOTE><p>consisted chiefly of reports of police cases. It certainly was a newspaper to all intents and purposes, and was ultimately so declared to be in a. court of law by a jury. But in the meantime, while the action was pending, the police had instructions to arrest Mr. John Cleave, the proprietor, and-seize all the copies of the paper as they came out of his office in Shoe Lane. He contrived for
<FIGURE id="Fig.132" n="2000.06.0048"><HEAD>Bangor House, <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct> (see page <num value="131">131</num>).</HEAD></FIGURE>
 a time to elude their vigilance; and in order. to prevent the seizure of his paper, he resorted to an expedient which was equally ingenious and laughable. Close by his little shop in Shoe Lane there was an undertaker, whose business, as might be inferred from the neighbourhood, as well as from his personal appearance and the homeliness of his shop, was exclusively among the lower and poorer classes of the community. With him Mr. Cleave made an arrangement to construct several coffins of the plainest and cheapest kind, for purposes which were fully explained. The  <Q>undertaker,</Q>  whose ultra-republican principles were in perfect unison with those of Mr. Cleave, not only heartily undertook the work, but did so on terms so <pb id="p.133" n="133"> moderate that he would not ask for nor accept any profit. He, indeed, could imagine no higher nor holier duty than that of assisting in the dissemination of a paper which boldly and energetically preached the extinction of the aristocracy and the perfect equality in social position, and in property too, of all classes of the community. Accordingly the coffins, with a rudeness in make and material which were in perfect keeping with the purpose to which they were to be applied, were got ready; and Mr. Cleave, in the dead of night, got them filled with thousands of his <title>Gazettes</title>. It had been arranged beforehand that particular houses in various parts of the town should be in readiness to receive them with blinds down, as if some relative had been dead, and was about to be borne away to the house appointed for all living. The deal coffin was opened, and the contents were taken out, tied up in a parcel so as to conceal from the prying curiosity of any chance person that they were <title>Cleave's Police Gazettes</title>, and then sent off to the railway stations most convenient for their transmission to the provinces. The coffins after this were returned in the middle of next night to the <Q>undertakers</Q> in Shoe Lane, there to be in

 readiness to render a similar service to Mr. Cleave and the cause of red Republicanism when the next
<title>Gazette</title> appeared.
<p>In this way Mr. Cleave contrived for some time to elude the vigilance of the police and to sell about <num value="50000">50,000</num> copies weekly of each impression of his paper. But the expedient, ingenious and eminently successful as it was for a time, failed at last. The people in Shoe Lane and the neighbourhood began to be surprised and alarmed at the number of funerals, as they believed them to be, which the departure of so many coffins from the  <Q>undertaker's</Q>  necessarily implied. The very natural conclusion to which they came was, that this supposed sudden and extensive number of deaths could only be accounted for on the assumption that some fatal epidemic had visited the neighbourhood, and there made itself a local habitation. The parochial authorities, responding to the prevailing alarm, questioned the  <Q> undertaker</Q>  friend and fellowlabourer of Mr. Cleave as to the causes of his sudden and extensive accession of business in the coffinmaking way; and the result of the close questions put to him was the discovery of the whole affair. It need hardly be added that an immediate and <pb id="p.134" n="134"> complete collapse took place in Mr. Cleave's business, so far as his <title>Police Gazette</title> was concerned. Not another number of the publication ever made its appearance, while the coffin-trade of the  <Q>undertaker</Q>  all at once returned to its normal proportions.</QUOTE>

<p>This stratagem of Cleave's was rivalled a few years ago by M. Herzen's clever plan of sending great numbers of his treasonable and forbidden paper, the Kolokol, to Russia, soldered up in sardine-boxes. No Government, in fact, can ever baffle determined and ingenious smugglers.
<p><num value="1">One</num> especially sad association attaches to Shoe Lane, and that is the burial in the workhouse graveyard (the site of the late Farringdon Market) of that unhappy child of genius, Chatterton the poet. n <datestruct VALUE="1770-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>, the poor lad, who had come from Bristol full of hope and ambition to make his fortune in London by his pen, broken-hearted and maddened by disappointment, destroyed himself in his mean garret-lodging in Brooke Street, Holborn, by swallowing arsenic. Mr. John Dix, his very unscrupulous biographer, has noted down a curious legend about the possible removal of the poet's corpse from London to Bristol, which, doubtful as it is, is at least interesting as a possibility:--
<p> <QUOTE>I found,</QUOTE> says Mr. Dix, <QUOTE><p>that Mrs. Stockwell, of Peter Street, wife of Mr. Stockwell, a basketmaker, was the person who had communicated to Sir R.Wilmot her grounds for believing Chatterton to have been so interred; and on my requesting her to repeat to me what she knew of that affair, Ash commenced by informing me that at <num value="10">ten</num> years of age she was a scholar of Mrs. Chatterton, his mother, where she was taught plain work, and remained with her until she was near <num value="20">twenty</num> years of age; that she slept with her, and found her kind and motherly, insomuch that there were many things which in moments of affliction Mrs. C. communicated to her, that she would not have wished to have been generally known; and among others, she often repeated how happy she was that her unfortunate son lay buriedin Redcliff, through the kind attention of a friend or relation in London, who, after the body had been cased in a parish shell, had it properly secured and sent to her by the waggon; that when it arrived it was opened, and the corpse found to be black and half putrid (having been burst with the motion of the carriage, or from some other cause), so that it became necessary to inter it speedily; and that it was early interred by Phillips, the sexton, who was of her family. That the effect of the loss of her son was a nervous disorder, which never quitted her, and she was often seen weeping at the bitter remembrance of her misfortune. She described the poet as having been sharp-tempered, but that it was soon over; and she often said he had cost her many uneasy hours, from the apprehension she entertained of his going mad, as he was accustomed to remain fixed for above an hour at a time quite motionless, and then he would snatch up a pen and write incessantly; but he was always, she added, affectionate.<gap>

<p>In addition to this, Mrs. Stockwell told the writer that the grave was on the right-hand side of the lime-tree, middle paved walk, in Redcliff Churchyard, about <num value="20">twenty</num> feet from the father's grave , which is, she says, in the paved walk, and where now Mrs. Chatterton and Mrs. Newton, her daughter, also lie. Also, that Mrs. Chatterton gave a person leave to bury his child over her son's coffin, and was much vexed to find that he afterwards put the stone over it, which, when Chatterton was buried, had been taken up for the purpose of digging the grave, and set against the church-wall; that afterwards, when Mr. Hutchinson's or Mr. Taylor's wife died, they buried her also in the same grave, and put this stone over with a new inscription. (Query, did he erase the <num value="1">first</num>, or turn the stone?--as this might lead to a discovery of the spot.) <gap>

<p>Being referred to Mrs. Jane Phillips, of Rolls Alley, Rolls Lane, Great Gardens, Temple Parish  (who is sister to that Richard Phillips whowas sexton at Redcliff Church in the year <datestruct value="1772"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>), she informed me that his widow and a daughter were living in Cathay; the widow is sexton, a Mr. Perrin, of Colston's Parade, acting for her. She remembers Chatterton having been at his father's school, and that he always called Richard Phillips, her brother, uncle, and was much liked by him. He liked him for his spirit, and there can be no doubt he would have risked the privately burying him on that account. When she heard he was gone to London she was sorry to hear it, for all loved him, and thought he could get no good there.
<p>Soon after his death her brother, R. Phillips, told. her that poor Chatterton had killed himself; on which she said she would go to Madame Chatterton's, to know the rights of it; but that he forbade her, and said, if she did so he should be sorry he had told her. She, however, did go, and asking if it was true that he was dead, Mrs. Chatterton began to weep bitterly, saying,  <Q>My son indeed is dead!</Q>  and when she asked her where he was buried, she replied,  <Q>Ask me nothing; he is dead and buried.</Q> </QUOTE>

The street boys began firing a volley of squibs at the young curate, who found all hope of escape barred, and dreaded the pickpockets, who take rapid advantage of such temporary embarrassments; but his good-natured exclamation, <QUOTE>Ah! here you are, popping away in <Q>Poppin's Court!</Q> </QUOTE> so pleased the crowd that they at once laughingly opened a passage for him. <QUOTE lang=la>Sic me servavit, Apollo,</QUOTE> he used afterwards to add when telling the story.

<p>Falcon Court, Fleet Street, took its name from an inn which bore the sign of the <QUOTE>Falcon.</QUOTE> This passage formerly belonged to a gentleman named Fisher, who, out of gratitude to the. Cordwainers' Company, bequeathed it to them by will. His gratitude is commonly said to have arisen from the number of good dinners that the Company had given him. However this may be, the Cordwainers are the present owners of the estate, and are under the obligation of having a sermon preached annually at the neighbouring church of St. Dunstan, on the <datestruct value="07-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, when certain sums are given to the poor. Formerly it was the custom to drink sack in the church to the pious memory of Mr. Fisher, but this appears to have been discontinued for a considerable period. This Fisherwas a jolly fellow, if all the tales are true which are related of him, as, besides the sack drinking, he stipulated that the Cordwainers should give a grand feast on the same day yearly to all their tenants. What a quaint picture might be made of the churchwardens in the old church drinking to the memory of Mr. Fisher! Wynkyn de Worde, the father of printing in England, lived in Fleet Street, at his messuage or inn known by the sign of the Falcon. Whether it was the inn that stood on the site of Falcon Court is not known with certainty, but most probably it was.
<p>Charles Lamb came to <num value="16">16</num>, Mitre Court Buildings in <num value="800">800</num>, after leaving Southampton Buildings, and remained in that quiet harbour out of Fleet Street till <datestruct value="1809"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, when he removed to Inner Temple Lane.
<p>It was whilst Lamb was residing in Mitre Court Buildings that those Wednesday evenings of his were in their glory. In <num value="2">two</num> of Mr. Hazlitt's papers are graphic pictures of these delightful Wednesdays and the Wednesday men, and admirable notes of several choice conversations. There is a curious sketch in <num value="1">one</num> of a little tilt between Coleridge and Holcroft, which must not be omitted. <QUOTE>Coleridge was riding the high German horse, and demonstrating the  <Q>Categories of the Transcendental Philosophy</Q>  to the author of <title>The Road to Ruin,</title>
who insisted on his knowledge of German and German metaphysics, having read the  <Q> Critique of Pure Reason</Q>  in the original.  <Q> My dear Mr. Holcroft,</Q>  said Coleridge, in a tone of infinitely provoking conciliation,  <Q>you really put me in mind of a sweet pretty German girl of about <num value="15">fifteen</num>, in the Hartz Forest, in Germany, and who <num value="1">one</num> day, as I was reading <title>The Limits of the Knowable and the Unknowable</title>, the profoundest of all his works, with great attention, came behind my chair, and leaning ove, said, &lsquo;What! you read Kant,? Why, I, that am a German born, don't understand him!&rsquo;</Q>  This was too much to bear, and Holcroft, starting up, called out, in no measured tone,  <Q> Mr. Coleridge, you are the most eloquent man I ever met with, and the most troublesome with your eloquence.</Q>  Phillips held the cribbagepeg, that was to mark him game, suspended in his <pb id="p.136" n="136"> hand, and the whist-table was silent for a moment. I saw Holcroft downstairs, and on coming to the landing-place in Mitre Court he stopped me to observe that he thought Mr. Coleridge a very clever man, with a great command of language, but that he feared he did--not always affix very proper ideas to the words he used. After he was gone we had our laugh out, and went on with the argument on  <Q>The Nature of Reason, the Imagination, and the Will.</Q>  <gap> It would make a supplement to the  <Q>Biographia Literaria,</Q>  in a volume and a half, octavo.</QUOTE>
<p>It was at <num value="1">one</num> of these Wednesdays that Lamb started his famous question as to persons <QUOTE><num value="1">one</num> would wish to have seen.</QUOTE> It was a suggestive topic, and proved a fruitful <num value="1">one</num>. Mr. Hazlitt, who was there, has left an account behind him of the kind of talk which arose out of this hint, so lightly thrown out by the author of <title>Elia,</title> and it is worth giving in his own words:--
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>On the question being started, Ayrton said,  <Q>I suppose the <num value="2">two</num> <num value="1">first</num> persons you would choose to see would be the <num value="2">two</num> greatest names in English literature, Sir Isaac Newton and Locke?</Q>  In this Ayrton, as usual, reckoned without his host. Everyone burst out a laughing at the expression of Lamb's face, in which impatience was restrained by courtesy.  <Q>Y-yes, the greatest names,</Q>  he stammered out hastily;  <Q> but they were not persons --not persons.</Q>   <Q>Not persons?</Q>  said Ayrton, looking wise and foolish at the same time, afraid his triumph might be premature.  <Q>That is,</Q>  rejoined Lamb,  <Q>not characters, you know. By Mr. Locke and Sir Isaac Newton you mean the <title>Essay on the Human Understanding</title> and <title>Principia,</title>
which we have to this day. Beyond their contents, there is nothing personally interesting in the men. But what we want to see anyone <hi rend=italics>bodily</hi> for is when there is something peculiar, striking in the individuals, more than we can learn from their writings and yet are curious to know. I dare say Locke and Newton were very like Kneller's portraits of them; but who could paint Shakespeare?</Q>   <Q>Ay,</Q>  retorted Ayrton,  <Q>there it is. Then I suppose you would prefer seeing him and Milton instead?</Q>   <Q>No,</Q>  said Lamb,  <Q> neither; I have seen so much of Shakespeare on the stage.</Q>  <gap>  <Q>I shall guess nomore;</Q>  said Ayrton.  <Q> Who is it, then, you would like to see &lsquo;in his habit as he lived,&rsquo; if you had your choice of the whole range of English literature?</Q>  Lamb then named Sir Thomas Brown and Fulke Greville, the friend of Sir Philip Sydney, as the <num value="2">two</num> worthies whom he should feel the greatest pleasure to encounter on the floor of his apartment in their night-gowns and slippers, and to exchange friendly greeting with them. At this Ayrton laughed outright, and conceived Lamb was jesting with him; but as no <num value="1">one</num> followed his example he thought there might be something in it, and waited for an explanation in a state of whimsical suspense.<gap>

<p>When Lamb had given his explanation, some <num value="1">one</num> inquired of him if he could not see from the window the Temple walk in which Chaucer used to take his exercise, and on his name being put to the vote I was pleased to find there was a general sensation in his favour in all but Ayrton, who said something about the ruggedness of the metre, and even objected to the quaintness of the orthography.
<p>Captain Burney muttered something about Columbus, and Martin Burney hinted at the Wandering Jew; but the last was set aside as spurious, and the <num value="1">first</num> made over to the New World.
<p> <Q> I should like,</Q>  said Mr. Reynolds,  <Q> to have seen Pope talking with Patty Blount, and I <hi rend=italics>have</hi>
seen Goldsmith.</Q>  Everyone turned round to look at Mr. Reynolds, as if by so doing they too could get a sight of Goldsmith ...
<p>Erasmus Phillips, who was deep in a game of piquet at the other end of the room, whispered to Martin Burney to ask if Junius would not be a fit person to. invoke from the dead.  <Q>Yes,</Q>  said Lamb,  <Q>provided he would agree to lay aside his mask.</Q>
<p>We were now at a stand for a short time, when Fielding was mentioned as a candidate.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.137.1">Serjeants' Inn, Fleet Street</lemma>, now deserted by the faithless serjeants, is supposed to have been given to the Dean and Chapter of York in <datestruct value="1409--"><year reg="1409">1409</year></datestruct> (Henry IV.)

In <datestruct value="1627--"><year reg="1627">1627</year></datestruct> (Charles I.) the inn began its legal career by being leased for <num value="40">forty</num> years to <num value="9">nine</num> judges and <num value="15">fifteen</num> serjeants. In this hall, in <datestruct value="1629--"><year reg="1629">1629</year></datestruct>, the judges in full bench struck a sturdy blow at feudal privileges by agreeing that peers might be attached upon process for contempt out of Chancery. In <datestruct value="1723--"><year reg="1723">1723</year></datestruct> (George I.) the inn was highly aristocratic, its inmates being the Lord Chief Justice, the Lord Chief Baron, justices, and serjeants. In <datestruct value="1730--"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>, however, the fickle serjeants removed to Chancery Lane, and Adam, the architect of the Adelphi, designed the present <num value="19">nineteen</num> houses and the present street frontage.

Its pavement, which had been part of the stonework of Old St. Paul's, was not replaced till <datestruct value="1860"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct>. The conservative old inn retained its old oil lamps long after the introduction of gas.
<P>The arms of Serjeants' Inn, worked into the iron gate opening on Fleet Street, are a dove and a serpent, the serpent twisted into a kind of true lover's knot. The lawyers of Serjeants' Inn, no doubt, unite the wisdom of the serpent with the guilelessness of the dove. Singularly enough Dr. Dodd, the popular preacher, who was hanged, bore arms nearly similar.

Miss Martineau wrote leading articles in the new paper for several years, and Mr. M&lsquo;Cullagh Torrens was also a recognised contributor.

<p> <QUOTE>The speculative proprietorship,</QUOTE> says Mr. Grant, in his <title>History of the Newspaper Press,</title>
 <QUOTE>was divided into <num value="100">one hundred</num> shares, some of which were held by Sir William Jackson, M.P., Sir Joshua Watkins, and the late Sir Joseph Paxton.

<p>The early numbers of the paper contained <pb id="p.138" n="138"> instalments of Dickens's <title>Pictures from Italy;</title>
yet the new venture did not succeed. Charles Dickens and Douglas Jerrold took the night-work on alternate days; but Dickens, who never made politics a special study, very soon retired from the editorship altogether, and Jerrold was chief editor for a little while till he left to set up his
<title>Weekly Newspaper</title>. Mr. Forster also had the editorship for a short period, and the paper then fell into the hands of the late Mr. Dilke, of the

<p>The <title>Daily News</title>, at the beginning, inspired the <title>Times</title> with some dread of rivalry; and it is noteworthy that, for several years afterwards, the great journal was very unfriendly in its criticisms on Dickens's books.
<p>There is no doubt that, over sanguine of success, the <title>Daily News</title> proprietors began by sinking too much money in the foundations. In <datestruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></datestruct>, the
<title>Times</title>&lsquo; reporters received on an average only <num value="5">five</num> guineas a week, while the <title>Daily News</title> gave <num value="7">seven</num>; but the pay was soon of necessity reduced. Mr. Grant computes the losses of the <title>Daily News</title> for the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="10">ten</num> years at not much less than <measure value="200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200000">200,000</num></measure>. The talent and enterprise of this paper, during the recent (<datestruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct>) German invasion of France, and the excellence of their correspondents in either camp, is said to have trebled its circulation, which Mr. Grant computes at a daily issue of <num value="90000">90,000</num>. As an organ of the highest and most enlightened form of Liberalism and progress, the <title>Daily News</title>
now stands pre-eminent.
<p>Many actors, poets, and authors dwelt in Salisbury Court in Charles II.'s time, and the great Betterton, Underhill, and Sandford affected this neighbourhood, to be near the theatres. Lady Davenant here presided over the Dorset Gardens Company; Shadwell, <QUOTE>round as a butt and liquored every chink,</QUOTE> nightly reeled home to the same precinct, unsteadily following the guidance of a will-o&lsquo;the- wisp link-boy; and in the-square lived and died Sir John King, the Duke of York's solicitor-general.
<p>If Salisbury Square boasts of Richardson, the respectable citizen and admirable novelist, it must also plead guilty to having been the residence of that not very reputable personage, Mr. John Eyre, who, although worth, as it was said, some <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure>, was transported on <datestruct VALUE="1771-11-1"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=1>1</day>, <year reg=1771>1771</year></datestruct> (George III.) for systematic pilfering of paper from the alderman's chamber, in the justice room, Guildhall. This man, led away by the thirst for money, had an uncle who made <num value="2">two</num> wills, <num value="1">one</num> leaving Eyre all his money, except a legacy of <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> to a clergyman; another leaving the bulk to the clergyman, and <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> only to his nephew. Eyre, not knowing of the <num value="2">second</num> will, destroyed the <num value="1">first</num>, in order to cancel the vexatious bequest.. When the real will was produced his disappointment and selfish remorse must have produced an expression of repressed rage worthy of Hogarth's pencil.
<p>In Salisbury Square Mr. Clarke's disagreeable confessions about the Duke of York were publicly burned, on the very spot (says Mr. Noble) where the zealous radical demagogue, Waithman, subsequently addressed the people from a temporary platform, not being able to obtain the use of St. Bride's Vestry. Nor must we forget to chronicle No. <num value="53">53</num> as the house of Tatum, a silversmith, to whom, in <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, that eminent man John Faraday acted as humble friend and assistant. How often does young genius act the herdsman, as Apollo did when he tended the kine of Admetus!
<p>The Woodfalls, too, in their time, lent celebrity to Salisbury Square. The <num value="1">first</num> Woodfall who became eminent was
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.140.1">Henry Woodfall</lemma><NOTE resp=B>Title Page</NOTE>, at the <QUOTE>Elzevir's Head</QUOTE> at Temple Bar. He commenced business under the auspices of Pope. His son Henry, who rose to be a Common Councilman and Master of the Stationers' Company, bought of Theophilus Cibber, in <datestruct value="1736--"><year reg="1736">1736</year></datestruct>-<num value="37">37</num>, onethird of a <num value="10">tenth</num> share of the London <title>Daily Post</title>, an organ which gradually grew into the
<title>Public Advertiser</title>, that daring paper in which the celebrated letters of Junius <num value="1">first</num> appeared. Those letters, scathing and full of Greek fire, brought down Lords and Commons, King's Bench and Old Bailey, on Woodfall, and he was fined and imprisoned. Whether Burke, Barre, Chatham, Horne Tooke, or Sir Philip Francis wrote them, will now probably never be known. The stern writer in the iron mask went down into the grave shrouded in his own mystery, and that grave no inquisitive eyes will ever find. <QUOTE>I am the sole depository of my secret,</QUOTE> he wrote, <QUOTE>and it shall perish with me.</QUOTE> The Junius Woodfall died in <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>.
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.141.1">William Woodfall, the younger brother</LEMMA>, was born in <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct>, and educated at St Paul's School. He was editor and printer of the <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, and in <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>, had his office in Dorset Street, Salisbury Square (Noble). <QUOTE>Memory</QUOTE> Woodfall, as William was generally called, acquired fame by his extraordinary power of reporting from memory the speeches he heard in the House of Commons. His practice during a debate (says his friend Mr. Taylor, of the <title>Sun</title>) was to close his eyes and lean with both hands upon his stick. He was so well acquainted with the tone and manner of the several speakers that he seldom changed his attitude but to catch the name of a new member. His memory was as accurate as it was capacious, and, what was almost miraculous, he could retain full recollection of any particular debate for a full fortnight, and after many long nights of speaking. Woodfall used to say he could put a speech away on a corner shelf of his mind for future reference. This is an instance of power of memory scarcely equalled by Fuller, who, it is said, could repeat the names of all the shops down the Strand (at a time every shop had a sign) in-regular and correct sequence; and it even surpasses <QUOTE>Memory</QUOTE> Thompson, who used to boast he could remember every shop from Ludgate Hill <pb id="p.141" n="141"> to the end of Piccadilly. Yet, with all his sensitively retentive memory, Woodfall did not care for slight interruptions during his writing. Dr. Johnson used to write abridged reports of debates for the
<title>Gentleman's Magazine</title> from memory, but, then, reports at that time were short and trivial. Woodfall was also a most excellent dramatic criticslow to censure, yet never sparing just rebuke. At the theatre his extreme attention gave his countenance a look of gloom and severity. Mr. J. Taylor, of the <title>Sun</title>, describes Kemble as watching Woodfall in <num value="1">one</num> of those serious moods, and saying to a friend, <QUOTE>How applicable to that man is the passage in <title>Hamlet</title>,-- <Q> thoughts black, hands apt.</Q> </QUOTE>
<p>Finding himself hampered on the <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, Woodfall started a new daily paper, with the title of the <title>Diary</title>, but eventually he was overpowered by his competitors and their large staff of reporters. His eldest son, who displayed great abilities, went mad. Mr. Woodfall's hospitable parties at his house at Kentish Town are sketched for us by Mr. J. Taylor. On <num value="1">one</num> particular occasion he mentions meeting Mr. Tickel, Richardson (a partner in <title>The Rolliad </title>), John Kemble, Perry (of the <title>Chronicle</title>), Dr. Glover (a humorist of the day), and John Coust. Kemble and Perry fell out over their wine, and Pefry was rude to the stately tragedian. Kemble, eyeing him with the scorn of Coriolanus, exclaimed, in the words of Zanga,--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>A lion preys not upon carcases.</QUOTE>
Perry very naturally effervesced at this, and war would have been instantly proclaimed between the belligerents had not Court and Richardson promptly interposed. The warlike powers were carefully sent home in separate vehicles.
<p>Mr. Woodfall had a high sense of the importance of a Parliamentary reporter's duties, and once, during a heavy week, when his eldest son came to town to assist him, he said, <QUOTE>And Charles Fox to have a debate on a Saturday! What! does he think that reporters are made of iron?</QUOTE> Woodfall used to tell a characteristic story of Dr. Dodd. hen that miserable man was in Newgate waiting sentence of death he sent earnestly for the editor of the <title>Morning Chronicle</title>. Woodfall, a kind and unselfish man, instantly hurried off, expecting that Dodd wished his serious advice. In the midst of Woodfall's condolement he was stopped by the Doctor, who said he had wished to see him on quite a different subject. Knowing Woodfall's judgment in dramatic matters, he was anxious to have his opinion on a comedy which he had written, and to request his interest with a manager to bring it on the stage. Woodfall was the more surprised and shocked as on entefing Newgate he had been informed by Ackerman, the keeper of Newgate, that the order for Dr. Dodd's execution had just arrived.
<p>Before parting with the Woodfall family, we may mention that it is quite certain that Henry Sampson Woodfall did not know who the author of
<title>Junius</title> was. Long after the letters appeared he used to say,-- <QUOTE>I hope and trust Junius is not dead; as I think he would have left me a legacy; for though I derived mich honour from his preference, I suffered much by the freedom of his pen.</QUOTE>
<p>The grandson of William, Henry Dick Woodfall, died in Nice, <datestruct VALUE="1869-04-13"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=13>13</day>, <year reg=1869>1869</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="69">sixty-nine</num>, carrying to the grave (says Mr. Noble) the last chance of discovering <num value="1">one</num> of the best kept secrets ever known.
<p>The Whig <QUOTE>mug-house</QUOTE> of Salisbury Court deserves-notice. The death of Queen Anne (<num value="7114">7114</num>) roused the hopes of the Jacobites. The rebellion. of <datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct> proved how bitterly they felt the peaceful accession of the Elector of Hanover. The northern revolt convinced them of their strength, but its failure taught them no lesson. They attributed its want of success to the rashness of the leaders and the absence of unanimity in their followers, to the outbreak not being simultaneous; to every cause, indeed, but the right <num value="1">one</num>. It was about this time that the Whig gentlemen of London, to unite their party and to organise places of gathering, established <QUOTE>mug-houses</QUOTE> in various parts of the City. At these places, <QUOTE>free-and-easy</QUOTE> clubs were held, where Whig citizens could take their mug of ale, drink loyal toasts, sing loyal songs, and arrange party processions. These assemblies, not always very just or forbearing, soon led to violent retaliations on the part of the Tories, attacks were made on several of the mug-houses, and dangerous riots naturally ensued. From the papers of the time we learn that the Tories wore white roses, or rue, thyme, and rosemary in their hats, flourished oak branches and green ribbons, and shouted <QUOTE>High Church;</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Ormond for ever ;</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>No King George;</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Down with the Presbyterians;</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Down with the mug-houses.</QUOTE> The Whigs, on the other side, roared <QUOTE>King George for ever,</QUOTE> displayed orange cockades, with the motto,--

 and; did their best on royal birthdays and other thanksgivings, by illuminations and blazing bonfires <pb id="p.142" n="142"> outside the mug-house doors, to irritate their adversaries and drive them to acts of illegal violence. The chief Whig mug-houses were in Long Acre, Cheapside, St. John's Lane (Clerkenwell), Tower Street, and Salisbury Court.
<p>Mackey, a traveller, who wrote <title>A Journey through England</title> about this time, describes the mug-houses very lucidly:--
<p> <QUOTE>The most amusing and diverting of all,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>is the  <Q>Mug-House Club,</Q>  in Long Acre, where every Wednesday and Saturday a mixture of gentlemen, lawyers, and tradesmen meet in a great room, and are seldom under a <num value="100">hundred</num>. They have a grave old gentleman in his own grey hairs, now within a few months of <num value="90">ninety</num> years old, who is their president, and sits in an armed-chair some steps higher than the rest of the company, to keep the whole room in order. A harp always plays all the time at the lower end of the room, and every now and then <num value="1">one</num> or other of the company rises and entertains the rest with a song; and, by-the-by, some are good masters. Here is nothing drank but ale; and every gentleman hath his separate mug, which he chalks on the table where he sits as it is brought in, and everyone retires when he pleases, as in a coffee-house. The room is always so diverted with songs, and drinking from <num value="1">one</num> table to another to <num value="1">one</num> another's healths, that there is no room for politics, or anything that can sour conversation. <num value="1">One</num> must be up by <num value="7">seven</num> to get room, and after <num value="10">ten</num> the company are, for the most part, gone. This is a winter's amusement that is agreeable enough to a stranger for once or twice, and he is well diverted with the different humours when the mugs overflow.</QUOTE>

<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.142.1">An attack on a Whig mug-house</LEMMA>, the <QUOTE>Roebuck,</QUOTE> in Cheapside, <datestruct VALUE="1716-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct>, was followed by a still more stormy assault on the Salisbury Court mughouse in July of the same year. The riot began on a Friday, but the Whigs kept a resolute face, and the mob dwindled away. On the Monday they renewed the attack, declaring that the Whigs were drinking <QUOTE>Down with the Church,</QUOTE> and reviling the memory of Queen Anne; and they swore they would level the house and make a bonfire of the timber in the middle of Fleet Street. But the wily Whigs, barricading the door, slipped out a messenger at a back door, and sent to a mug-house in Tavistock Street, Covent Garden, for reinforcements. Presently a band of Whig bludgeon-men arrived, and the Whigs of Salisbury Court then snatched up pokers, tongs, pitchforks, and legs of stools, and sallied out on the Tory mob, who soon fled before them. For <num value="2">two</num> days the Tory mob seethed, fretted, and swore revenge. But the report of a squadron of horse being drawn up at Whitehall ready to ride down on the City kept them gloomily quiet. On the <num value="3">third</num> day a Jacobite, named Vaughan, formerly a Bridewell boy, led them on to revenge; and on Tuesday they stormed the place in earnest. <QUOTE>The best of the Tory mob,</QUOTE> says a Whig paper of the day, <QUOTE>were High Church scaramouches, chimneysweeps, hackney coachmen, foot-boys, tinkers, shoeblacks, street idlers, ballad singers, and strumpets.</QUOTE> The contemporaneous account will most vividly describe the scene.
<p>The <title>Weekly Journal</title> (a Whig paper) of <datestruct VALUE="1716-07-28"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=28>28</day>, <year reg=1716>1716</year></datestruct>, says: <QUOTE><p>The Papists and Jacobites, in pursuance of their rebellious designs, assembled a mob on Friday night last, and threatened to attack Mr. Read's mug-house in Salisbury Court, in Fleet Street; but, seeing the loyal gentlemen that were there were resolved to defend themselves, the cowardly Papists and Jacobites desisted for that time. But on Monday night the villains meeting together again in a most rebellious manner, they began <num value="1">first</num> to attack Mr. Goslin's house, at the sign of the  <Q>Blew Boar's Head,</Q>  near Water Lane, in Fleet Street, breaking the windows thereof, for no other reason but because he is well-affected to his Majesty King George and the present Government. Afterwards they went to the above-said mug-house in Salisbury Court; but the cowardly Jacks not being able to accomplish their hellish designs that night, they assembled next day in great numbers from all parts of the town, breaking the windows with brick-bats, broke open the cellar, got into the lower rooms, which they robb'd, and pull'd down the sign, which was carried in triumph before the mob by <num value="1">one</num> Thomas Bean, servant to Mr. Carnegie and Mr. Cassey, <num value="2">two</num> rebels under sentence of death, and for which he is committed to Newgate, as well as several others, particularly <num value="1">one</num> Hook, a joyner, in Blackfriars, who is charged with acting a part in gutting the mug-house. Some of the rioters were desperately wounded, and <num value="1">one</num> Vaughan, a seditious weaver, formerly an apprentice in Bridewell, and since employed there, who was a notorious ringleader of mobs, was kill'd at the aforesaid mug-house. Many notorious Papists were seen to abet and assist in this villanous rabble, as were others, who call themselves Churchmen, and are like to meet with a suitable reward in due time for their assaulting gentlemen who meet at these mug-houses only to drink prosperity to the Church of England as by law established, the King's health, the Prince of Wales's, and the rest of the Royal Family, and those of his faithful and loyal Ministers. But it is farther to be observed that women of mean, scandalous lives, do frequently <pb id="p.143" n="143"> point, hiss, and cry out <Q>Whigs</Q> upon his Majesty's good and loyal subjects, by which, raising a mob, they are often insulted by them. But &lsquo;tis hoped the magistrates will take such methods which may prevent the like insults for the future.
<p>Thursday last the coroner's inquest sat on the body of the person killed in Salisbury Court, who were for bringing in their verdict, wilful murder against Mr. Read, the man of the mughouse; but some of the jury stick out, and will not agree with that verdict; so that the matter is deferr'd till Monday next.</QUOTE>

<p> <QUOTE>On Tuesday last,</QUOTE> says the same paper  (<datestruct VALUE="1716-08-4"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=4>4</day>, <year reg=1716>1716</year></datestruct>), <QUOTE>a petition, signed by some of the inhabitants of Salisbury Court, was deliver'd to the Court of Aldermen, setting forth some late riots occasioned by the meeting of some persons at the mug-house there. The petition was referr'd to, and a hearing appointed the same day before the Lord Mayor. The witnesses on the side of the petition were a butcher woman, a barber's prentice, and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> other inferior people. These swore, in substance--that the day the man waskilled there, they saw a great many people gathered together about the mug-house, throwing stones and dirt, &amp;c.; that about <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock they saw Mr. Read come out with a gun, and shoot a man who was before the mob at some distance, and had no stick in his hand. Those who were call'd in Mr. Read's behalf depos'd that a very great mob attacked the house, crying,  <Q>High Church and Ormond; No Hanover; No, King, George;</Q>  that then the constable read the Proclamation, charging them to disperse, but they still continued to cry,  <Q>Down with the mug-house;</Q>  that <num value="2">two</num> soldiers then issued out of the house, and drove the mob into Fleet Street; but by throwing sticks and stones, they drove these <num value="2">two</num> back to the house, and the person shot returned at the head of the mob with a stick in his hand flourishing, and crying,  <Q>No Hanover; No King George;</Q>  and  <Q>Down with the mug-house.</Q>  That then Mr. Read desired them to disperse, or he would shoot amongst them, and the deceased making at him, he shot him and retired indoors; that then the mob forced into the house, rifled all below stairs, took the money out of the till, let the beer about the cellar, and what goods they could not carry away, they brought into the streets and broke to pieces; that they would have forced their way up stairs and murdered all in the house, but that a person who lodged in the house made a barricade at the stair-head, where he defended himself above half an hour against all the mob, wounded soAme of them, and compelled them to give over the assault. There were several very credible witnesses to these circumstances, and many more were ready to have confirmed it, but the Lord Mayor thought sufficient had been said, and the following gentlemen, who are men of undoubted reputation and worth, offering to be bail for Mr. Read, namely, Mr. Johnson, a justice of the peace, and Colonels Coote and Westall, they were accepted, and accordingly entered into a recognisance.</QUOTE>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.143.1">Richardson's</lemma> printing office was at the north: west corner of Salisbury Square, communicating with the court, No. <num value="76">76</num>, Fleet Street. Here the thoughtful old citizen wrote <title>Pamela,</title> and here, in <datestruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>, Oliver Goldsmith acted as his <QUOTE>reader.</QUOTE> Richardson seems to have been an amiable and benevolent man, kind to his compositors and servants and beloved by children. All the anecdotes relating to his private life are pleasant. He used to encourage early rising among his workmen by hiding half crowns among the disordered type, so&gt; that the earliest comer might find his virtue rewarded; and he would frequently bring up fruit from the country to give to those of his servants. who had been zealous and good-tempered.
<p>Samuel Richardson, the author of <title>Pamela</title> and
<title>Clarissa,</title> was the son of a Derbyshire joiner. He was born in <datestruct value="1689--"><year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct>, and diedi n <datestruct value="1761--"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>. Apprenticed <pb id="p.144" n="144"> to a London printer, he rose by steady industry and prudence to be the manager of a large business, printer of the Journals of the House of Commons, Master of the Stationers' Company, and part-printer to the king. In <datestruct value="1741--"><year reg="1741">1741</year></datestruct>, at the age of <num value="52">fifty-two</num>, publishers urging the thriving citizen to write them a book of moral letters, Richardson produced <title>Pamela,</title> a novel which ran through <num value="5">five</num> editions the <num value="1">first</num> year, and became the rage of the town. Ladies carried the precious volumes to Ranelagh, and held them up in smiling triumph to each other. Pope praised the novel as more useful than <num value="20">twenty</num> volumes of sermons, and Dr. Sherlock gravely recommended it from the pulpit. In <datestruct value="1749--"><year reg="1749">1749</year></datestruct> Richardson wrote <title>Clarissa Harlowe,</title> his most perfect work, and in <datestruct value="1753--"><year reg="1753">1753</year></datestruct> his somewhat tedious
<title>Sir Charles Grandison </title> (<num value="7">7</num> vols.) In <title>Pamela</title>
he drew a servant, whom her master attempts to seduce and. eventually marries, but in <title>Clarissa</title>
the heroine, after harrowing misfortunes, dies unrewarded. Richardson had always a moral end in view. He hated vice and honoured virtue, but he is too often prolix and wearisome. He wished to write novels that should wean the young

 from the foolish romances of his day. In <title>Pamela</title>
he rewarded struggling virtue; in <title>Clarissa</title> he painted the cruel selfishness of vice; in <title>Sir Charles</title> he tried to represent the perfect Christian gentleman. Coleridge said that to read Fielding after Richardson was like emerging from a sick room, heated by stoves. into an open lawn on a breezy May morning. Richardson, indeed, wrote more for women than men. Fielding was coarser, but more manly; he had humour, but no moral purpose at all. The natural result was that Fielding and his set looked on Richardson as a grave, dull, respectable old prig; Richardson on Fielding as a low rake, who wrote like a man who had been an ostler born in a stable, or a runner in a sponginghouse. <QUOTE>The virtues of Fielding's heroes,</QUOTE> the vain old printer used to say to his feminine clique, <QUOTE>are the vices of a truly good man.</QUOTE>
<p>Dr. Johnson, who had been befriended by Richardson, was never tired of depreciating Fielding and crying up the author of <title>Pamela.</title> <QUOTE>Sir,</QUOTE> he used to thunder out, <QUOTE>there is as much difference between the <num value="2">two</num> as between a man who knows how a watch is made and a man who can merely <pb id="p.145" n="145"> tell the hour on the dial-plate.</QUOTE> He called Fielding a <QUOTE>barren rascal.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Sir, there is more knowledge of the heart in <num value="1">one</num> letter of Richardson's than in all  <Q>Tom Jones.</Q> </QUOTE> Some <num value="1">one</num> present here mildly suggested that Richardson was very tedious. <QUOTE>Why, sir,</QUOTE> replied Johnson, <QUOTE>if you were to read Richardson for the story, your impatience would be so great that you would hang yourself. But you must read him for the sentiment, and consider the story as only giving occasion to the sentiment.</QUOTE> After all, it must be considered that, old-fashioned as Richardson's novels have now become, the old printer dissected the human heart with profound knowledge and exquisite care, and that in the back shop in Salisbury Court, amid the jar of printing-presses, the quiet old citizen drew his ideal beings with far subtler lines and touches than any previous novelist had done.
<p>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion at least Hogarth and Johnson met at Richardson's house.
<p> <QUOTE>Mr. Hogarth,</QUOTE> says Nichols, <QUOTE>came <num value="1">one</num> day to see Richardson, soon after the execution of Dr. Cameron, for having taken arms for the house of Stuart in <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct>-<num value="46">46</num>; and, being a warm

 partisan of George II., he observed to Richardson that certainly there must have been some very unfavourable circumstances lately discovered in this particular case which had induced the king to approve of an execution for rebellion so long after the time it was committed, as this had the appearance of putting a man to death in cold blood, and was very unlike his majesty's usual clemency. While he was talking he perceived a person standing at a window in the room shaking his head and rolling himself about in a ridiculous manner. He concluded he was an idiot, whom his relations had put under the care of Mr. Richardson as a very good man. To his great surprise, however, this figure stalked forward to where he and Mr. Richardson were sitting, and all at once took up the argument, and burst out into an invective against George II., as <num value="1">one</num> who, upon all occasions, was unrelenting and barbarous; mentioning many instances, particularly that, where an officer of high rank had been acquitted by a court martial, George II. had, with his own hand, struck his name off the list. In short, he displayed such a power of eloquence that <pb id="p.146" n="146"> Hogarth looked at him in astonishment, and actually imagined that this idiot had been at the moment inspired. Neither Johnson nor Hogarth were made known to each other at this interview.</QUOTE>
<p>Boswell tells a good story of a rebuke that Richardson's amiable but inordinate egotism on <num value="1">one</num> occasion received, much to Johnson's secret delight, which is certainly worth quoting before we dismiss the old printer altogether. <QUOTE><num value="1">One</num> day,</QUOTE> says, Boswell <QUOTE>at his country house at Northend, where a large company was assembled at dinner, a gentleman who was just returned from Paris, wishing to please Richardson, mentioned to him a flattering circumstance, that he had seen his  <Q> Clarissa</Q>  lying on the king's brother's table. Richardson observing that part of the company were engaged in talking to each other, affected then not to attend to it; but by and bye, when there was a general silence, and he thought that the flattery might be fully heard, he addressed himself to the gentleman:  <Q>I think, sir, you were saying somewhat about </Q> --pausing in a high flutter of expectation. The gentleman provoked at his inordinate vanity resolved not to indulge it, and with an exquisitely sly air of indifference answered,  <Q>A mere trifle, sir; not worth repeating.</Q>  The mortification of Richardson was visible, and he did not speak <num value="10">ten</num> words more the whole day. Mr. Johnson was present, and appeared to enjoy it much.</QUOTE>
<p>At <num value="1">one</num> corner of Salisbury Square (says Mr. Timbs) are the premises of Peacock, Bampton,  & Mansfield, the famous pocket-book makers, whose <QUOTE>Polite Repository</QUOTE> for <datestruct value="1778--"><year reg="1778">1778</year></datestruct> is <QUOTE>the patriarch of all pocket-books.</QUOTE> Its picturesque engravings have never been surpassed, and their morocco and russia bindings scarcely equalled.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.146.2">St. Bride's Passage</lemma>, westward (says Mr. Timbs), was a large dining-house, where, some <num value="40">forty</num> years ago, Colton, the author, used to dine, and publicly boast that he wrote the whole of his Lacon; or, <QUOTE>Many Things in Few Words,</QUOTE> upon a small rickety deal table, with <num value="1">one</num> pen. Another frequenter of this place was <num value="1">one</num> Webb, who seems to have been so well up in the topics of the day, that he was a sort of walking newspaper, who was much with the King and Queen of the Sandwich Islands when they visited England in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>.
<p>This Caleb Colton, mentioned by Mr. Timbs, was that most degraded being, a disreputable clergyman, with all the vices but little of the genius of Churchill, and had been, in his flourishing time, vicar of Kew and Petersham. He was educated at Eton, and eventually became Fellow of King's College, Cambridge. He wrote <title>A Plain and Authentic Narrative of the Stamford Ghost,</title>
Remarks on the Tendencies of <title>Don Juan,</title> a poem on Napoleon, and a satire entitled <title>Hypocrisy.</title> His best known work, however, was
<title>Lacon; or, Many Things in Few Words,</title> published in <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>. These aphorisms want the terse brevity of Rochefoucauld, and are in many instances vapid and trivial. A passion for gaming at last swallowed up Colton's other vices, and becoming involved, he cut the Gordian knot of debt in <datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct> by absconding; his living was then seized and given to another. He fled to America, and from there returned to that syren city, Paris, where he is said in <num value="2">two</num> years to have won no less than <measure value="25000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="25000">25,000</num></measure>. The miserable man died by his own hand at Fontainebleau, in <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>. In the
<title>Lacon</title> is the subjoined passage, that seems almost prophetic of the miserable author's miserable fate :
<p><QUOTE rend=blockquote>The gamester, if he die a martyr to his profession, is doubly ruined. He adds his soul to every loss, and by the act of suicide renounces earth to forfeit heaven.</QUOTE> <gap> <QUOTE>Anguish of mind has driven thousands to suicide, anguish of body none. This proves that the health of the mind is of far more consequence to our happiness than the health of the body, although both are deserving of much more attention than either of them receive.</QUOTE>

<p>And here is a fine sentiment, worthy of Dr. odd himself:--

Sincerely to aspire after virtue is to gain her, and zealously to labour after her wages is to receive them. Those that seek her early will find her before it is late; her reward also is with her, and she will come quickly. For the breast of a good man is a little heaven commencing on earth, where the Deity sits enthroned with unrivalled influence, every subjugated passion,  <Q>like the wind and storm, fulfilling his word.</Q> </QUOTE>

<p>The Order of
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.147.1">Knights Templars</LEMMA>, established by Baldwin, King of Jerusalem, in <datestruct value="1118--"><year reg="1118">1118</year></datestruct>, to protect Christian pilgrims on their road to Jerusalem, <num value="1">first</num> found a home in England in <datestruct value="1128--"><year reg="1128">1128</year></datestruct> (Henry I.), when Hugh de Payens, the <num value="1">first</num> Master of the Order, visited our shores to obtain succours and subsidies against the Infidel.
<p>The proud, and at <num value="1">first</num> zealous, brotherhood originally settled on the south side of Holborn, without the Bars. Indeed, about a century and a half ago, part of a round chapel, built of Caen stone, was found under the foundation of some old houses at the Holborn end of Southampton Buildings. In time, however, the Order amassed riches, and, growing ambitious, purchased a large space of ground extending from Fleet Street to the river, and, from Whitefriars to Essex House in the Strand. The new Temple was a vast monastery, fitted for the residence of the prior, his chaplain, serving brethren and knights; and it boasted a council-chamber, a refectory, a barrack, a church, a range of cloisters, and a river terrace for religious meditation, military exercise, and the training of chargers. In <datestruct value="1185--"><year reg="1185">1185</year></datestruct> Heraclius, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, who had come to England with the Masters of the Temple and the Hospital to procure help from Henry II. against the victorious Saladin, consecrated the beautiful river-side church, which the proud Order had dedicated to the Virgin Lady Mary. The late Master of the Temple had only recently died in a dungeon at Damascus, and the new Master of the Hospital, after the great defeat of the Christians at Jacob's Ford, on the Jordan, had swam the river covered with wounds, and escaped to the Castle of Beaufort.
<p>The singular rules of the <QUOTE>Order of the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Jesus Christ and of the Temple of Solomon,</QUOTE> were revised by the <num value="1">first</num> Abbot of Clairvaux, St. Bernard himself. Extremely austere and earnest, they were divided into <num value="72">seventy-two</num> heads, and enjoined severe and constant devotional exercises, self-mortification, fasting, prayer, and regular attendance at matins, vespers, and all the services of the Church. Dining in <num value="1">one</num> common refectory, the Templars were to make known wants that could not be expressed by signs, in a gentle, soft, and private way. <num value="2">Two</num> and <num value="2">two</num> were in general to live together, so that <num value="1">one</num> might watch the other. After departing from the supper hall to bed it was not permitted ithem to speak again in public, except upon urgent necessity, and then only in an undertone. All scurrility, jests, and idle words were to be avoided; and after any foolish saying, the repetition of the Lord's Prayer was enjoined. All professed knights were to wear white garments, both in summer and winter, as emblems of chastity. The esquires and retainers were required to wear black or, in provinces where that coloured cloth could not be procured, brown. No gold or silver was to be used in bridles, breastplates, or spears, and if ever that furniture was given them in charity, it was to be discoloured to prevent an appearance of superiority or arrogance. No brother was to receive or despatch letters without the leave of the master or procurator, who might read them if he chose. No gift was to be accepted by a Templar till permission was <num value="1">first</num> obtained from the Master. No knight should talk to any brother of his previous frolics and irregularities in the world. No brother, in pursuit of worldly delight, was to hawk, to shoot in the woods with long or cross-bow, to halloo to dogs, or to spur a horse after game. There might be married brothers, but they were to leave part of their goods to the chapter, and not to wear the white habit. Widows were not to dwell in the preceptories. When travelling, Templars were to lodge only with men of the best repute, and to keep a light burning all night <QUOTE>lest the dark enemy, from whom God preserve us, should find some opportunity.</QUOTE> Unrepentant brothers were to be cast out. Last of all, every Templar was to shun <QUOTE>feminine kisses,</QUOTE> whether from widow, virgin, mother, sister, aunt, or any other woman.
<p>During <num value="6">six</num> of the <num value="7">seven</num> Crusades (<datestruct value="1096--"><year reg="1096">1096</year></datestruct>-<datestruct value="1272--"><year reg="1272">1272</year></datestruct>), during which the Christians of Europe endeavoured, with tremendous yet fitful energy, t wrest the birthplace of Christianity from the equally fanatic Moslems, the Knights Templars fought bravely among the foremost. Whether by the side of Godfrey of Bouillon, Louis VII., Philip V., Richard Coeur de Lion, Louis IX., or Prince Edward, the stem, sunburnt men in the white mantles were ever foremost in the shock of spears. Under many a clump of palm trees, in many a scorched desert track, by many a hill fortress, smitten with sabre or pierced with arrow, the holy brotherhood dug the graves of their slain companions. <pb id="p.148" n="148">
<p>A few of the deeds, which must have been so often talked of upon the Temple terrace and in the Temple cloister, must be narrated, to show that, however mistaken was the ideal of the Crusaders, these monkish warriors fought their best to turn it into a reality. In <datestruct value="1146--"><year reg="1146">1146</year></datestruct> the whole brotherhood joined the <num value="2">second</num> Crusade, and protected the rear of the Christian army in its toilsome march through Asia Minor. In <datestruct value="1151--"><year reg="1151">1151</year></datestruct>, the Order saved Jerusalem, and drove back the Infidels with terrible slaughter. <num value="2">Two</num> years later the Master of the Temple was slain, with many of the white mantles, in fiercely essaying to storm the walls of Ascalon. <num value="3">Three</num> years after this <num value="300">300</num> Templars were slain in a Moslem ambuscade, near Tiberias, and <num value="87">87</num> were taken prisoners. e next find the Templars repelling the redoubtable Saladin from Gaza; and in a great battle near Ascalon, in <datestruct value="1177--"><year reg="1177">1177</year></datestruct>, the Master of the Temple and <num value="10">ten</num> knights broke through the Mameluke Guards, and all but captured Saladin in his tent. The Templars certainly had their share of Infidel blows, for, in <datestruct value="1178--"><year reg="1178">1178</year></datestruct>, the whole Order was nearly slain in a battle with Saladin; and in another fierce conflict, only the Grand Master and <num value="2">two</num> knights escaped; while again at Tiberias, in <datestruct value="1187--"><year reg="1187">1187</year></datestruct>, they received a cruel repulse, and were all but totally destroyed.
<p>In <datestruct value="1187--"><year reg="1187">1187</year></datestruct>, when Saladin took Jerusalem, he next besieged the great Templar stronghold of Tyre; and soon after a body of the knights, sent from London, attacked Saladin's camp in vain, and the Grand Master and nearly half of the Order perished. In the subsequent siege of Acre the Crusaders lost nearly <num value="100000">100,000</num> men in <num value="9">nine</num> pitched battles. In <datestruct value="1191--"><year reg="1191">1191</year></datestruct>, however, Acre was taken, and the Kings of France and England, and the Masters of the Temple and the Hospital, gave the, throne of the Latin kingdom to Guy de Lusignan. When Richard Coeur de Lion had cruelly put to death <num value="2000">2,000</num> Moslem prisoners, we find the Templars interposing to prevent Richard and the English fighting against the Austrian allies; and soon after the Templars bought Cyprus of Richard for <num value="300000">300,000</num> livres of gold. In the advance to Jerusalem the Templars led the van of Richard's army. When the attack on Jerusalem was suspended, the Templars followed Richard to Ascalon, and soon afterwards gave Cyprus to Guy de Lusignan, on condition of his surrendering the Latin crown. When Richard abandoned the Crusade, after his treaty with Saladin, it was the Templars who gave him a galley and the disguise of a Templar's white robe to secure his safe passage to an Adriatic port. Upon Richard's departure they erected many fortresses ih Palestine, especially <num value="1">one</num> on Mount Carmel, which they named Pilgrim's Castle.
<p>The <num value="4">fourth</num> Crusade was looked on unfavourably by the brotherhood, who now wished to remain at peace with the Infidel, but they nevertheless soon warmed to the fighting, and we find a band of the white mantles defeated and slain at Jaffa. With a <num value="2">second</num> division of Crusaders the Templars quarrelled, and were then deserted by them. Soon after the Templars and Hospitallers, now grown corrupt and rich, quarrelled about lands and fortresses; but they were still favoured by the Pope, and helped to maintain the Latin throne. In <datestruct value="1209--"><year reg="1209">1209</year></datestruct> they were strong enough to resist the interdict of Pope Innocent; and in. the Crusade of <datestruct value="1217--"><year reg="1217">1217</year></datestruct> they invaded Egypt, and took Damietta by assault, but, at the same time, to the indignation of England, wrote home urgently for more money. An attack on Cairo proving disastrous, they concluded a truce with the Sultan in <datestruct value="1221--"><year reg="1221">1221</year></datestruct>. In the Crusade of the Emperor Frederick the Templars refused to join an excommunicated man. In <datestruct value="1240--"><year reg="1240">1240</year></datestruct>, the Templars wrested Jerusalem from the Sultan of Damascus, but, in <datestruct value="1243--"><year reg="1243">1243</year></datestruct>, were ousted by the Sultan of Egypt and the Sultan of Damascus, and were almost exterminated, in a <num value="2">two</num> days' battle; and, in <datestruct value="1250--"><year reg="1250">1250</year></datestruct>, they were again defeated at Mansourah. When King Louis was taken prisoner, the Infidels demanded the surrender of all the Templar fortresses in Palestine, but eventually accepted Damietta alone and a ransom, which Louis exacted from the Templars. In <datestruct value="1257--"><year reg="1257">1257</year></datestruct> the Moguls and Tartars took Jerusalem, and almost annihilated the Order, whose instant submission they required. In <datestruct value="1268--"><year reg="1268">1268</year></datestruct> Pope Urban excommunicated the Marshal of the Order, but the Templars nevertheless held by their comrade, and Bendocdar, the Mameluke, took all the castles belonging to the Templars in Armenia, and also stormed Antioch, which had been a Christian city <num value="170">170</num> years.
<p>After Prince Edward's Crusade the Templars were close pressed. In <datestruct value="1291--"><year reg="1291">1291</year></datestruct>, Aschraf Khalil besieged the <num value="2">two</num> Orders and <num value="12000">12,000</num> Christians in Acre for <num value="6">six</num> terrible weeks. The town was stormed, and all the Christian prisoners, who flew to the Infidel camp, were ruthlessly beheaded. A few of the Templars flew to the. Convent of the Temple, and there perished; the Grand Master had already fallen; a handful of the knights only escaping to Cyprus.
<p>The persecution of the now corrupt and useless Order commenced <num value="16">sixteen</num> years afterwards. In <datestruct value="1306--"><year reg="1306">1306</year></datestruct>, both in London and Paris, terrible murmurs arose. at their infidelity and their vices. At the Church of St. Martin's, Ludgate, where the English Templars were accused, the following charges were brought against them:-- <pb id="p.149" n="149">

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.149.3">The round church of the Temple</lemma> is the finest of the <num value="4">four</num> round churches still existing in England. The Templars did not, however, always build round towers, resembling the Temple at Jerusalem, though such was generally their practice. The restoration of this beautiful relic was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> symptoms of the modem Gothic revival.
<p>In the reign of Charles II. the body of the church was filled with formal pews, which concealed the bases of the columns, while the walls were encumbered, to the height of <num value="8">eight</num> feet from the ground, with oak wainscoting, which was carried entirely round the church, so as to hide the elegant marble piscina, the interesting alneries over the high altar, and the <hi rend=italics>sacrarium</hi> on the eastern side of the edifice. The elegant Gothic arches connecting the round with the square church were choked up with an oak screen and glass windows and doors, and with an organ gallery adorned with Corinthian columns, pilasters, and Grecian <pb id="p.150" n="150"> ornaments, which divided the building into <num value="2">two</num> parts, altogether altered its original character and appear Dance, and sadly marring its architectural beauty. The eastern end of the church was at the same time disfigured by an enormous altar-piece in the
<hi rend=italics>classic style</hi>, decorated with Corinthian columns and Grecian cornices and entablatures, and with enrich ments of cherubims and wreaths of fruit, flowers, and leaves, heavy and cumbrous, and quite at variance with the Gothic character of the building. A large pulpit and carved sounding-board were erected in the middle of the dome, and the walls and whinns were encrusted and disfigured with hideous mural monuments and pagan trophies of forgotten wealth and vanity.
<p>The following account of the earliest repairs of the
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.150.2">Temple Church</LEMMA> is given in <title>The New View of London</title>: <QUOTE>Having narrowly escaped the flames in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, it was in <datestruct value="1682--"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct> beautified, and the curious wainscot screen set up. The south-west part was, in the year <datestruct value="1695"><year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>, new built with stone. In the year <datestruct value="1706"><year reg="1706">1706</year></datestruct> the church was wholly new whitewashed, gilt, and painted within, and the pillars of the round tower wainscoted with a new battlement and buttresses on the south side, and other parts of the outside were well repaired. Also the figures of the Knights Templars were cleaned and painted, and the iron-work enclosing them new painted and gilt with gold. The east end of the church was repaired and beautified in <datestruct value="1707--"><year reg="1707">1707</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1737--"><year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct> the exterior of the north side and east end were again repaired.
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> step towards the
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.150.1">real restoration of the Temple Church</lemma> was made in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>. It had been generally repaired in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, but in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct> Sir Robert Smirke restored the whole south side externally and the lower part of the circular portion of the round church. The stone seat was renewed, the arcade was restored, the heads which had been defaced or removed were supplied. The wain
<FIGURE id="Fig.150" n="2000.06.0054"><HEAD>A Knight Templar.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 scoting of the columns was taken away, the monuments affixed to some of the columns were removed, and the position of others altered. There still remained, however, monuments in the round church materially affecting the relative proportions of the <num value="2">two</num> circles; the clustered columns still retained their incrustations of paint, plaster, and whitewash; the <num value="3">three</num> archway entrances into the oblong church remained in their former state, detaching the <num value="2">two</num> portions from each other, and entirely destroying the perspective which those arches afforded.
<P>When the genuine restoration was commenced in <datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct>, the removal of the <hi rend=italics>beautfications and adornments</hi> which had so long disfigured the Temple Church, was regarded as an act of vandalism. Seats were substituted for pews, and a smaller pulpit and reading-desk supplied more appropriate to the character of the building. The pavement was lowered to its original level; and thus the bases of the columns became once more visible. The altar screen and railing were taken down. The organ was removed, and thus all the arches from the round church to the body of the oblong church were thrown open. By this alteration the character of the church was shown in its original beauty.
<P>In the summer of <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>, the <num value="2">two</num> Societies of the Inner and Middle Temple had the paint and whitewash scraped off the marble columns and ceiling. The removal of the modern oak wainscoting led to the discovery of a very beautiful double marble piscina near the east end of the south side of the building, together with an adjoining elegantly-shaped recess, and also a picturesque Gothic niche on the north side of the church.
<P>On taking up the modern floor, remains of the original tesselated pavement were discovered. When the whitewash and plaster were removed from the ceiling it was found in a dangerous condition. There were also found there remains of ancient <pb id="p.151" n="151">
<FIGURE id="Fig.151" n="2000.06.0055"><HEAD>Interior of the Temple Church (see page <num value="150">150</num>).</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <pb id="p.152" n="152"> decorative paintings and rich ornaments worked in gold and silver; but they were too fragmentary to give an idea of the general pattern. Under these circumstances it was resolved to redecorate the ceiling in a style corresponding with the ancient decorative paintings observable in many Gothic churches in Italy and France.
<p>As the plaster and whitewash were removed it was found that the columns were of the most beautiful Purbeck marble. The <num value="6">six</num> elegant clustered columns in the round tower had been concealed with a thick coating of Roman cement, which had altogether concealed the graceful form of the mouldings and carved foliage of their capitals. Barbarous slabs of Portland stone had been cased round theirbases and entirely altered their character. All this modern patchwork was thrown away; but the venerable marble proved so mutilated that new columns were found necessary to support the fabric. These are exact imitations of the old ones. The <num value="6">six</num> elegant clustered columns already alluded to, however, needed but slight repair. Almost all the other marble-work required renewal, and a special messenger was despatched to Purbeck to open the ancient quarries.
<p>Above the western doorway was discovered a beautiful Norman window, composed of Caen stone. The porch before the western door of the Temple Church, which formerly communicated with an
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.152.1">ancient cloister</lemma> leading to the hall of the nights Templars, had been filled up with rubbish to a height of nearly <num value="2">two</num> feet above the level of the ancient pavement, so that all the bases of the
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.152.2">magnificent Norman doorway</lemma> w ere entirely hidden from view.
<p>Previous to the recent restoration the round tower was surmounted by a wooden, flat, whitewashed ceiling, altogether different from the ancient roof. This ceiling and the timber roof above it have been entirely removed, and replaced by the present-elegant and substantial roof, which is composed of oak, protected externally by sheet copper, and has been painted by Mr. Willement in accord- Dance with an existing example of decorative painting in an ancient church in Sicily. Many buildings were also removed to give a clearer view of the fine old church.
<p> <QUOTE>Among the many interesting objects,</QUOTE> says Mr. Addison, <QUOTE>to be seen in the ancient church of the Knights Templars is a <hi rend=italics>penitential cell</hi>, a dreary place of solitary confinement formed within the thick wall of the building, only <num value="4">four</num> feet <num value="6">six</num> inches long and <num value="2">two</num> feet <num value="6">six</num> inches wide, so narrow and small that a grown person cannot lie down within it. In this narrow prison the disobedient brethren of the ancient Templars were temporarily confined in chains and fetters,  <Q>in order that their souls might be saved from the eternal prison of hell.</Q>  The hinges and catch of a door, firmly attached to the doorway of this dreary chamber, still remain, and at the bottom of the staircase is a stone recess or cupboard, where bread and water were placed for the prisoner. In this cell Brother Walter le Bacheler, Knight, and Grand Preceptor of Ireland, is said to have been starved to death for disobedience to his superior, the Master of the Temple. His body was removed at daybreak and buried by, Brother John de Stoke and Brother Radulph de Barton in the middle of the court between the church and the hall.</QUOTE>
<p>The Temple discipline in the early times was very severe: disobedient brethren were scourged by the Master himself in the Temple Church, and frequently whipped publicly on Fridays in the church. Adam de Valaincourt, a deserter, was sentenced to eat meat with the dogs for a whole year, to fast <num value="4">four</num> days in the week, and every Monday to present himself naked at the high altar to be publicly scourged by the officiating priest.
<p>At the time of the restoration of the church stained glass windows were added, and the panels of the circular vaulting were emblazoned with the lamb and horse--the devices of the Inner and Middle Temple--and the Beauseant, or black and white banner of the Templars.
<p>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.152.3">The mail-clad effigies</lemma> on the pavement of the <QUOTE>Round</QUOTE> of the Temple Church are not monuments of Knights Templars, but of <QUOTE>Associates of the Temple,</QUOTE> persons only partially admitted to the privileges of the powerful Order. During the last repairs there were found <num value="2">two</num> Norman stone coffins and <num value="4">four</num> ornamented leaden coffins in small vaults beneath these effigies, but not in their original positions. Stow, in <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>, speaks of <num value="8">eight</num> images of armed knights in the round walk. The effigies have been restored by Mr. Richardson, the sculptor. The most interesting of these represents Geoffrey de Magnaville, Earl of Essex, a bold baron, who fought against King Stephen, sacked Cambridge, and plundered Ramsey Abbey. He was excommunicated, and while besieging Burwell Castle was struck by an arrow from a crossbow just as he had taken off his helmet to get air. The Templars, not daring to bury him, soldered him up in lead, and hung him on a crooked tree in their riverside orchard. The corpse being at last absolved, the Templars buried it before the west door of their church. He is to be known by a long, pointed shield charged with rays on a diamonded field, The next figure, of Purbeck marble in low relief, <pb id="p.153" n="153"> is supposed to be the most ancient of all. The shield is kite-shaped, the armour composed of rude rings-name unknown. Vestiges of gilding were discovered upon this monument. The <num value="2">two</num> effigies on the north-east of the <QUOTE>Round</QUOTE> are also anonymous. They are the tallest of all the stone brethren: <num value="1">one</num> of them is straight-legged; the crossed legs of his comrade denote a Crusading vow. The feet of the <num value="1">first</num> rests on <num value="2">two</num> grotesque human heads, probably Infidels; the <num value="2">second</num> wears a mouth guard like a respirator. Between the <num value="2">two</num> figures is the copestone lid of an ancient sarcophagus, probably that of a Master or Visitor- General of the Templars, as it has the head of the cross which decorates it adorned with a lion's head, and the foot rests on the head of a lamb, the joint emblems of the Order of the Templars. During the excavations in the <QUOTE>Round,</QUOTE> a magnificent Purbeck marble sarcophagus, the lid decorated with a foliated cross, was dug up and re-interred.
<p>On the south side of the <QUOTE>Round,</QUOTE> between <num value="2">two</num> columns, his feet resting upon a lion, reposes a great historical personage, William Marshall, the Protector of England during the minority of King Henry III., a warrior and a statesman whose name is sullied by no crimes. The features are handsome, and the whole body is wrapped in chain mail. A Crusader in early life, the earl became <num value="1">one</num> of Richard Coeur de Lion's vicegerents during his absence in Palestine. He fought in Normandy for King John, helped in the capture of Prince Arthur and his sister, urged the usurper to sign Magna Charta, and secured the throne for Prince Henry. Finally, he defeated the French invaders, routed the French at sea, and died, in the fulness of years, a warrior whose deeds had been notable, a statesman whose motives could seldom be impugned. Shakespeare, with ever a keen eye for great men, makes the earl the interceder for Prince Arthur. He was a great benefactor of the brethren of the Chivalry of the Temple.
<p>By the side of the earl reposes his warlike son William Marshall the younger, cut in freestone. He was <num value="1">one</num> of the chief leaders of the Barons against John, and in Henry's reign he overthrew Prince Llewellyn, and slew <num value="8000">8,000</num> wild Welsh. He fought with credit in Brittany and Ireland, and eventually married Eleanor, the king's sister. He gave an estate to the Templars. The effigy is clad in a shirt of ring mail, above which is a loose garment, girded at the waist. The shield on the left arm bears a lion rampant.
<p>Near the western doorway reclines the mailed effigy of Gilbert Marshall, Earl of Pembroke, <num value="3">third</num> son of the Protector. He is in the act of drawing a sword, and his left foot rests on a winged dragon. This earl, at the murder of a brother in Ireland, succeeded to the title, and married Margaret, a daughter of the King of Scotland. He was just starting for the Crusades, when he was killed by a fall from his horse, in a tournament held at Ware, (<datestruct value="1241--"><year reg="1241">1241</year></datestruct>). Like the other Marshalls, he was a benefactor of the Temple, and, like all the <num value="4">four</num> sons of the Protector, died without issue, in the reign of Henry III., the family becoming extinct with him. Matthew Paris declared that the race had been cursed by the Bishop of Fernes, from whom the Protector had stolen lands. The bishop, says the chronicler, with great awe came with King Henry to the Temple Church, and, standing at the earl's tomb, promised the dead man absolution if the lands were returned. No restitution was made, so the curse fell on the doomed race. All these Pembrokes wear chain hoods and have animals recumbent at their feet.
<p>The name of a beautiful recumbent mailed figure next Gilbert Marshall is unknown, and near him, on the south side of the <QUOTE>Round,</QUOTE> rests the everpraying effigy of Robert, Lord de Ros. This lord was no Templar, for he has no beard, and wears flowing hair, contrary to the rules of the Order. His shield bears <num value="3">three</num> water buckets. The figure is cut out of yellow Roach Abbey stone. The armour is linked. This knight was fined <measure value="800l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="800">800</num></measure> by Richard Coeur de Lion for allowing a French prisoner of consequence to escape from his custody. He married a daughter of a King of Scotland, was Sheriff of Cumberland, helped to extort Magna Charta from King John, and gave much public property to the Templars.
<p>During the repairs of the round tower several sarcophagi of Purbeck marble were discovered. On the coffins being removed while the tower was being propped, the bodies all crumbled to dust. The sarcophagi were all reinterred in the centre of the <QUOTE>Round.</QUOTE>
<p>During the repairs of <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct> the workmen discovered and stole an ancient seal of the Order; it had the name of Berengarius, and on <num value="1">one</num> side was represented the Holy Sepulchre. <QUOTE>The churchyard abounds,</QUOTE> Mr. Addison says, <QUOTE>with ancient stone coffins.</QUOTE> According to Burton, an antiquary of, Elizabeth's time, there then existed in the Temple Church a monument to a Visitor-General of the Order.

I should not, however, have been tempted to blazon my coat of arms were it not connected with a whimsical anecdote. About the reign of James I., the <num value="3">three</num> harmless schollop shells were changed by Edmund Gibbon, Esq., into <num value="3">three</num> ogresses, or female cannibals, with a design of stigmatising <num value="3">three</num> ladies, his kinswomen, who had provoked him by an unjust lawsuit. But this singular mode of revenge, for which he obtained the sanction of Sir William Seager, King-at-Arms, soon expired with its author; and on his own monument in the Temple Church the monsters vanish, and the <num value="3">three</num> schollop shells resume their proper and hereditary place.</QUOTE>
<p>At the latter end of Charles II.'s reign the organ in the Temple Church became the subject of a singular contest, which was decided by a most remarkable judge. The benchers had determined to have the best organ in London; the competitors for the building were Smith and Harris. Father Smith, a German, was renowned for his care in choosing wood without knot or flaw, and for throwing aside every metal or wooden pipe that was not perfect and sound. His stops were also allowed by all to be singularly equal and sweet in tone. The <num value="2">two</num> competitors were each to erect an organ in the Temple Church, and the best <num value="1">one</num> was to be retained. The competition was carried on with such violence that some of the partisans almost ruined themselves by the money they expended. The night preceding the trial the too zealous friends of Harris cut the bellows of Smith's organ, and rendered it for the time useless. Drs. Blow and Purcell were employed to show the powers of Smith's instrument, and the French organist of Queen Catherine performed on Harris's. The contest continued, with varying success, for nearly a twelvemonth. At length Harris challenged his redoubtable rival to make certain additional reed stops, <hi rend=italics>vox humana, cremona,</hi>
double bassoon and other stops, within a given time. The controversy was at last terminated by Lord Chief Justice Jefferies--the cruel and debauched Jefferies, who was himself an accomplished musician-deciding in favour of Father Smith. Part of Harris's rejected organ was erected at St. Andrew's, Holborn, part at Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin. Father Smith, in consequence of his success at the Temple, was employed to build an organ for St. Paul's, but Sir Christopher Wren would never allow the case to be made large enough to receive all the stops. <QUOTE>The sound and general mechanism of modern instruments,</QUOTE> says Mr. Burge, <QUOTE>are certainly superior to those of Father Smith's, but for sweetness of tone I have never met in any part of Europe with pipes that have equalled his.</QUOTE>
<p>In the reign of James I. there was a great dispute between the Custos of the Temple and the <num value="2">two</num> Societies. This sinecure office, the gift of the Crown, was a rectory without tithes, and the Custos was dependent upoi voluntary contributions. The benchers, irritated at Dr. Micklethwaite's arrogant <pb id="p.155" n="155"> pretensions, shut the doctor out from their dinners. n the reign of Charles I., the doctor complained to the king that he received no tithes, was refused precedence as Master of the Temple, was allowed no share in the deliberations, was not paid for his supernumerary sermons, and was denied ecclesiastical jurisdiction. The doctor thereupon locked up the church and took away the keys; but Noy, the Attorney-General, snubbed him, and called him <QUOTE rend=latin>elatus et superbus</QUOTE>; and he got nothing, after all, but hard words, for his petition.

The chapel anciently opened upon the cloisters, and formed a private way from the convent to the church. Here the Papal legate and the highest bishops frequently held conferences; and on Sunday mornings the Master of the Temple held chapters, enjoined penances, made up quarrels, and pronounced absolution. The chapel of St. Anne was in the old time much resorted to by barren women, who there prayed for children.

<P>In James I.'s time the Round, as we find in Ben Jonson, was a place for appointments; and in <datestruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></datestruct> Otway describes bullies of Alsatia, with flapping hats pinned up on <num value="1">one</num> side, sandy, weather-beaten periwigs, and clumsy iron swords clattering at their heels, as conspicuous personages among the Knights of the Posts and the other peripatetic philosophers of the Temple walks.--
<P>We must now turn to the history of the whole precinct. When the proud Order was abolished by the Pope, Edward II. granted the Temple to Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, who, however, soon surrendered it to the king's cousin, the Earl of Lancaster, who let it, at their special request, to the student and professors of the common laws; the colony then gradually becoming an organised and collegiate body, Edward I. having authorised laymen for the <num value="1">first</num> time to read and plead causes.
<P>Hugh le Despenser for a time held the Temple, and on his execution Edward III. appointed the Mayor of London its guardian. The mayor closing the watergate caused much vexation to the lawyers rowing by boat to Westminster, and the king had to interfere.

<p>Many of the old retainers of the Templars became servants of the new lawyers, who had ousted their masters. The attendants at table were still called paniers, as they had formerly been. The dining in pairs, the expulsion from hall for misconduct, and the locking out of chambers were old customs also kept up. The judges of Common Pleas retained the title of knight, and the Fratres Servientes of the Templars arose again in the character of learned serjeants-at-law, the coif of the modern serjeant being the linen coif of the old Freres Serjens of the Temple. The coif was never, as some suppose, intended to hide the tonsure of priests practising law contrary to ecclesiastical prohibition. The old ceremony of creating serjeants-
<FIGURE id="Fig.156" n="2000.06.0056"><HEAD>Tombs Of Knights Templars (see page <num value="152">152</num>).</HEAD></FIGURE>
 at-law exactly resembles that once used for receiving Fratres Servientes into the fraternity of the Temple.
<p>In Wat Tyler's rebellion the wild men of Kent poured down on the dens of the Temple lawyers, pulled down their houses, carried off the books, deeds, and rolls of remembrance, and burnt them in Fleet Street, to spite the Knights Hospitallers. Walsingham, the chronicler, indeed, says that the rebels-who, by the by, claimed only their rights --had resolved to decapitate all the lawyers of London, to put an end to all the laws that had oppressed them, and to clear the ground for better times. In the reign of Henry VI. the overgrown society of the Temple divided into <num value="2">two</num> halls, or rather the original <num value="2">two</num> halls of the knights and Fratres Servientes separated into <num value="2">two</num> societies. Brooke, the Elizabethan antiquary, says: <QUOTE>To this day, in memory of the old custom, the benchers or ancients of the <num value="1">one</num> society dine once every year in the hall of the other society.</QUOTE>
<p>Sir John Fortescue, Chief Justice of the King's Bench in the reign of Henry VI., computed the annual expenses of each law student at more than <measure value="28l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="28">28</num></measure>--( <QUOTE><measure value="450l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="450">450</num></measure> of our present money</QUOTE> --Addison). The students were all gentlemen by birth, and at each Inn of Court there was an academy, where singing, music, and dancing were taught. On festival days, after the offices of the Church, the students employed themselves in the study of history and in reading the Scriptures. Any student expelled <num value="1">one</num> society was refused admission to any <pb id="p.157" n="157"> of the other societies. A manuscript (<hi rend=italics>temp.</hi>
Henry VIII.) in the Cotton Library dwells much on the readings, mootings, boltings, and other practices of the Temple students, and analyses the various classes of benchers, readers, cupboardmen, inner barristers, outer barristers, and students. The writer also mentions the fact that in term times the students met to talk law and confer on business in the church, which was, he says, as noisy as St. Paul's. When the plague broke out the students went home to the country.

<p>The Society of the Inner Temple was very active  (says Mr. Foss) during the reign of Henry VIII. in the erection of new buildings. Several houses for chambers were constructed near the library,
 <hi rend=italics>and</hi> were called Pakington's Rents, from the name of the treasurer who superintended them. Henry Bradshaw, treasurer in the <num value="26">twenty-sixth</num> year, gave his name to another set then built, which it kept until Chief Baron Tanfield resided there in the reign of James I., since which it has been called Tanfield Court. Other improvements were made about the same period, <num value="1">one</num> of these being the construction of a new ceiling to the hall and the erection of a wall between the garden and the Thames.

<p>The books of the Middle Temple do not commence till the reign of King Henry VII., the <num value="1">first</num> treasurer named in them being John Brooke, in the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> year of Henry VII. (<datestruct value="1500--"><year reg="1500">1500</year></datestruct>-<num value="1">1</num>). Readers were not appointed till the following year, the earliest being John Vavasour-probably son of the judge, and not, as Dugdale calls him, the judge himself, who had then been on the bench for <num value="12">twelve</num> years. Members of the house might be excused from living in commons on account of their wives being in town, or for other special reasons (Foss).
<p>In the last year of Philip and Mary (<datestruct value="1558--"><year reg="1558">1558</year></datestruct>) <num value="8">eight</num> gentlemen of the Temple were expelled the society and committed to the Fleet for wilful disobedience to the Bench, but on their humble submission they were readmitted. A year before this a severe Act of Parliament was passed, prohibiting Templars wearing beards of more than <num value="3">three</num> weeks' growth, upon pain of a <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num>-shilling</measure> fine, and double for every week after monition. The young lawyers were evidently getting too foppish. They were required to cease wearing Spanish cloaks, swords, bucklers, rapiers, gowns, hats, or daggers at their girdles. Only knights and benchers were to display doublets or hose of any light colour, except scarlet and crimson, or to affect velvet caps, scarf-wings to their gowns, white jerkins, buskins, velvet shoes, double shirtcuffs, or feathers or ribbons in their caps. Moreover, no attorney was to be admitted into either house. These monastic rules were intended to preserve the gravity of the profession, and must have pleased the Poloniuses and galled the Mercutios of those troublous days.
<p>In Elizabeth's days Master Gerard Leigh, a pedantic scholar of the College of Heralds, persuaded the misguided Inner Temple to abandon the old Templar arms--a plain red cross on a shield argent, with a lamb bearing the banner of the sinless profession, surmounted by a red,cross. The heraldic euphuist substituted for this a flying Pegasus striking out the fountain of Hippocrene with its hoofs, with the appended motto of <QUOTE lang=la>Volat ad astera virtus</QUOTE>, a recondite allusion to men, like Chaucer and Gower, who, it is said, had turned from lawyers to poets.

<p>The Temple revels in the olden time were indeed gorgeous outbursts of mirth and hospitality. <num value="1">One</num> of the most splendid of these took place in the <num value="4">fourth</num> year of Elizabeth's reign, when the queen's favourite, Lord Robert Dudley (afterwards the great Earl of Leicester) was elected Palaphilos, constable or marshal of the inn, to preside over the Christmas festivities. He had lord chancellor and judges, <num value="80">eighty</num> guards, officers of the household, and other distinguished persons to attend him; and another of the queen's subsequent favourites, Christopher Hatton--a handsome youth, remarkable for his skill in dancing--was appointed master of the games. The daily banquets of the Constable were announced by the discharge of a double cannon, and drums and fifes summoned the mock court to the common hall, while sackbuts, cornets, and recorders heralded the arrival of every course. At the <num value="1">first</num> remove a herald at the high table cried,-- <QUOTE>The mighty Palaphilos, Prince of Sophie, High Constable, Marshal of the Knights Templars, Patron of the Honourable Order of Pegasus!- a largesse! a largesse!</QUOTE> upon which the Prince of Sophie tossed the man a gold chain worth a <num value="1000">thousand</num> talents. The supper ended, the kingat-arms entered, and, doing homage, announced <num value="24">twenty-four</num> special gentlemen, whom Pallas had ordered him to present to Palaphilos as knightselect of the Order of Pegasus. The <num value="24">twenty-four</num> gentlemen at once appeared, in long white vestures, with scarves of Pallas's colours, and the kingat- arms, bowing to each, explained to them the laws of the new order.
<p>For every feast the steward provided <num value="5">five</num> fat hams, with spices and cakes, and the chief butler <num value="7">seven</num> dozen gilt and silver spoons, <num value="12">twelve</num> damask table-cloths, and <num value="20">twenty</num> candlesticks. The Constable wore gilt armour and a plumed helmet, and bore a pole-axe in his hands. On St. Thomas's Eve a parliament was held, when the <num value="2">two</num> youngest brothers, bearing torches, preceded the procession of benchers, the officers' names were called, and the whole society passed round the hearth singing a carol. On Christmas Eve the minstrels, sounding, preceded the dishes, and, dinner done, sang a song at the high table; after dinner the oldest master of the revels and other gentlemen singing songs.
<p>On Christmas Day the feast grew still more feudal and splendid. At the great meal at noon the minstrels and a long train of servitors bore in the blanched boar's head, with a golden lemon in its jaws, the trumpeters being preceded by <num value="2">two</num> gentlemen in gowns, bearing <num value="4">four</num> torches of white wax. On St. Stephen's Day the younger Templars waited at table upon the benchers. At the <num value="1">first</num> course the Constable entered, to the sound of horns, preceded by <num value="16">sixteen</num> swaggering trumpeters, while the halberdiers bore <QUOTE>the tower</QUOTE> on their shoulders and marched gravely <num value="3">three</num> times round the fire.
<p>On St. John's Day the Constable was up at <num value="7">seven</num>, and personally called and reprimanded any tardy officers, who were sometimes committed to the Tower for disorder. If any officer absented himself at meals, any <num value="1">one</num> sitting in his place was compelled to pay his fee and assume his office. Any offender, if he escaped into the oratory, could claim sanctuary, and was pardoned if he returned into the hall humbly and as a servitor, carrying a roll on the point of a knife. No <num value="1">one</num> was allowed to sing after the cheese was served.
<p>On Childermas Day, New Year's Day, and Twelfth Night the same costly feasts were continued, only that on Thursday there was roast beef and venison pasty for dinner, and mutton and roast hens were served for supper. The final banquet closing all was preceded by a dance, revel, play, or mask, the gentlemen of every Inn of Court and Chancery being invited, and the hall furnished with side scaffolds for the ladies, who were feasted in the library. The Lord Chancellor and the ancients feasted in the hall, the Templars serving. The feast over, the Constable, in his gilt armour, ambled into the hall on a caparisoned mule, and arranged the sequence of sports.
<p>The Constable then, with <num value="3">three</num> reverences, knelt before the King of the Revels, and, delivering up his naked sword, prayed to be taken into the royal service. Next entered Hatton, the Master of the Game, clad in green velvet, his rangers arrayed in green satin. Blowing <QUOTE>a blast of venery</QUOTE> <num value="3">three</num> times on their horns, and holding green-coloured bows and arrows in their hands, the rangers paced <num value="3">three</num> times round the central fire, then knelt to the King of the Revels, and desired admission into the royal service. Next ensued a strange and barbarous ceremony. A huntsman entered with a live fox and cat and <num value="9">nine</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> couple of hounds, and, to the blast of horns and wild shouting, the poor creatures were torn to shreds, for the amusement of the applauding Templars. At supper the Constable entered to the sound of drums, borne upon a scaffold by <num value="4">four</num> men, and as he was carried <num value="3">three</num> times round the hearth every <num value="1">one</num> shouted, <QUOTE>A lord! a lord!</QUOTE> <pb id="p.160" n="160">
<p>He then descended, called together his mock court, by such fantastic names as-
<P>Sir Francis Flatterer, of Fowlershurst, in the county of Buckingham;
<P>Sir Randal Rakabite, of Rascal Hall, in the county of Rakebell;
<P>Sir Morgan Mumchance, of Much Monkery, in the county of Mad Mopery; and the banquet then began, every man having a gilt pot full of wine, and each <num value="1">one</num> paying sixpence for his repast. That night, when the lights were put out, the noisy, laughing train passed out of the portal, and the long revels were ended.

<p>The Temple feasts continued to be as lavish and magnificent as in the days of Queen Mary, when no reader was allowed to contribute less than <num value="15">fifteen</num> bucks to the hall dinner, and many during their readings gave fourscore or a <num value="100">hundred</num>.
<p>On the marriage (<datestruct value="1613--"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct>) of the Lady Elizabeth, daughter, of King James I., with Prince Frederick, the unfortunate Elector-Palatine, the Temple and Gray's Inn men gave a masque, of which Sir Francis Bacon was the chief contriver. The masque came to Whitehall by water from Winchester Place, in Southwark; <num value="3">three</num> peals of ordnance greeting them as they embarked with torches and lamps, as they passed the Temple Garden, and as they landed. This short trip cost <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="300">300</num></measure>. The king, after all, was so tired, and the hall so crowded, that the masque was adjourned till the Saturday following, when all went well. The next night the king gave a supper to the <num value="40">forty</num> masquers; Prince Charles and his courtiers, who had lost a wager to the king at running at the ring, paying for the banquet <measure value="30l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="30">30</num></measure> a man. The masquers, who dined with <num value="40">forty</num> of the chief nobles, kissed his majesty's hand.

The <num value="4">four</num> chariots that bore the <num value="16">sixteen</num> masquers were preceded by <num value="20">twenty</num> footmen in silver-laced scarlet liveries, who carried torches and cleared the way.

An entrance was made from the river through the wall of the Temple Garden, the King being received on landing by the Reader and the Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas; the path from the garden to the wall was lined with the Reader's servants, clad in scarlet cloaks and white doublets; while above them stood the benchers, barristers, and students, music playing all the while, and <num value="20">twenty</num> violins welcoming Charles into the hall with unanimous scrape and quaver. inner was served by <num value="50">fifty</num> young students in their gowns, no meaner servants appearing.

<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.162.1">The great fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct></LEMMA>, says Mr. Jeaffreson, in his <title>Law and Lawyers,</title> was stayed in its westward course at the Temple; but it was not suppressed until the flames had consumed many sets of chambers, had devoured the title-deeds of a vast number of valuable estates, and had almost licked the windows of the Temple Church. Clarendon has recorded that on the occasion of this stupendous calamity, which occurred when a large proportion of the Templars were out of town, the lawyers in residence declined to break open the chambers and rescue the property of absent members of their society, through fear of prosecution for burglary. Another great fire, some years later (<datestruct VALUE="1678-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1678">1678</year></datestruct>-<num value="79">79</num>), destroyed the old cloisters and part of the old hall of the Inner Temple, and the greater part of the residential buildings of the <QUOTE>Old Temple.</QUOTE> Breaking out at midnight, and lasting till noon of next day, it devoured, in the Middle Temple, the whole of Pump Court (in which locality it originated), Elm-tree Court, Vine Court, and part of Brick Court; in the Inner Temple the cloisters, the greater part of Hare Court, and part of the hall. he night was bitterly cold, and the Templars, aroused from their beds to preserve life and property, could not get an adequate supply of water from the Thames, which the unusual severity of the season had frozen. In this difficulty they actually brought barrels of ale from the Temple butteries, and fed the engines with the malt liquor. Of course this supply of fluid was soon exhausted, so the fire spreading eastward, the lawyers fought it by blowing up the buildings that were in immediate danger. Gunpowder was more effectual than beer; but the explosions were sadly destructive to human life. Amongst the buildings thus demolished was the library of the Inner Temple. Naturally, but with no apparent good reason, the sufferers by the fire attributed it to treachery on the part of persons unknown, just as the citizens attributed the fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct> to the Papists. It is more probable that the calamity was caused by some such accident as that which occasioned the fire which, during John Campbell's attorney-generalship, destroyed a large amount of valuable property, and had its origin in the clumsiness of a barrister who upset upon his fire a vessel full of spirit. Of this fire Lord Campbell observes:-- <QUOTE>When I was Attorney-General, my chambers in Paper Buildings, Temple, were burnt to the ground in the night-time, and all my books and manuscripts, <pb id="p.162" n="162"> with some valuable official papers, were consumed. Above all, I had to lament a collection of letters written to me by my dear father, from the time of my going to college till his death in <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>. All lamented this calamity except the claimant of a peerage, some of whose documents (suspected to be forged) he hoped were destroyed; but fortunately they had been removed into safe custody a few days before, and the claim was dropped.</QUOTE> The fire here alluded to broke out in the chambers of <num value="1">one</num> Thombury, in Pump Court.
<p> <QUOTE>I remember,</QUOTE> says North in his <title>Life of Lord Keeper Guildford,</title> <QUOTE>that after the fire of the Temple it was considered whether the old cloister walks should be rebuilt or rather improved into

But Mr. Attorney would by no means give way to it, and reproved the Middle Templars very bitterly and eloquently upon the subject of students walking in evenings there, and putting  <Q>cases,</Q>  which, he said,  <Q>was done in his time, mean and low as the buildings were then.

<p>The last revel in any of the Inns of Court was held in the Inner Temple, <datestruct VALUE="1733-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>  (George II.), in honour of Mr. Talbot, a bencher of that house, accepting the Great Seal. The ceremony is described by an eye-witness in <title>Wynne's Eunomus.</title> The Lord Chancellor arrived at <num value="2">two</num> o'clock, preceded by Mr. Wollaston, Master of the Revels, and followed by Dr. Sherlock, Bishop of Bangor, Master of the Temple, and the judges and serjeants formerly of the Inner Temple. There was an elegant dinner provided for them and the chancellor's officers, but the barristers and students had only the usual meal of grand days, except that each man was furnished with a flask of claret besides the usual allowance of port and sack. <num value="14">Fourteen</num> students waited on the Bench table: among them was Mr. Talbot, the Lord Chancellor's eldest son, and by their means any special dish was easily obtainable from the upper table. A large gallery was built over the screen for the ladies; and music, placed in the little gallery at the upper end of the hall, played all dinner-time. As soon as dinner was over, the play of <title>Love for Love</title>
and the farce of <title>The Devil to Pay</title> were acted, the actors coming from the Haymarket in chaises, all ready-dressed. It was said they refused all gratuity, being satisfied with the honour of performing before such an audience. After the play, the Lord Chancellor, the Master of the Temple, the judges and benchers retired into their parliament chamber, and in about half an hour afterwards came into the hall again, and a large ring was formed round the fire-place (but no fire nor embers were in it). Then the Master of the Revels, who went <num value="1">first</num>, took the Lord Chancellor by the right hand, and he with his left took Mr. J [ustice] age, who, joined to the other judges, serjeants, and benchers present, danced, or rather walked, round about the coal fire, according to the old ceremony, <num value="3">three</num> times, during which they were aided in the figure of the dance by Mr. George Cooke, the prothonotary, then upwards of <num value="60">sixty</num>; and all the time of the dance the <hi rend=italics>ancient song</hi>, accompanied with music, was sung by <num value="1">one</num> Tony Aston (an actor), dressed in a bar gown, whose father had been formerly Master of the Plea Office in the King's Bench. hen this was over, the ladies came down from the gallery, went into the parliament chamber, and stayed about a quarter of an hour, while the hall was putting in order. Then they went into the hall and danced a few minutes. Country dances began about <num value="10">ten</num>, and at <num value="12">twelve</num> a very fine collation was provided for the whole company, from which they returned to dancing. The Prince of Wales honoured the performance with his company part of the time. He came into the music gallery wing about the middle of the play, and went away as soon as the farce of walking round the coal fire was over.
<p>Mr. Peter Cunningham, <hi rend=italics>apropos</hi> of these revels, mentions that when the floor of the Middle Temple all was taken up in <datestruct value="1764--"><year reg="1764">1764</year></datestruct> there were found nearly <num value="100">one hundred</num> pair of very small dice, yellowed by time, which had dropped through the chinks above. he same writer caps this fact by <num value="1">one</num> of his usually apposite quotations.

(the refectory of the ancient knights) was almost entirely rebuilt in <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>. The roof was overloaded with timber, the west wall was cracking, and the wooden cupola of the bell let in the rain. The pointed arches and rude sculpture at the entrance doors showed great antiquity, but the northern wall had been rebuilt in <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>. The incongruous Doric screen was surmounted by lions' heads, cones, and other anomalous devices, and in <datestruct value="1741--"><year reg="1741">1741</year></datestruct> low, classic windows had been inserted in the south front. Of the old hall, where the Templars frequently held their chapters, and at different times entertained King John, King Henry III., and several of the legates, several portions still remain. A very ancient groined Gothic arch forms the roof of the present buttery, and in the apartment beyond there is a fine groined and vaulted ceiling. In the cellars below are old walls of vast thickness, part of an ancient window, a curious fire-place, and some pointed arches, all now choked with modern brick partitions and dusty staircases. These vaults formerly communicated by

<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.165.1">New Buildings, Inner Temple, <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct></LEMMA></NOTE>

<p>Judge Burrough (says Mr. Jeaffreson, in his <QUOTE>Law and Lawyers</QUOTE> ) used to relate that when the Gordon Rioters besieged the Temple he and a strong body of barristers, headed by a sergeant of the Guards, were stationed in Inner Temple Lane, and that, having complete confidence in the strength of their massive gate, they spoke bravely of their desire to be fighting on the other side. At length the gate was forced. The lawyers fell into confusion and were about to beat a retreat, when the sergeant, a man of infinite humour, cried out in a magnificent voice, <QUOTE>Take care no gentleman fires from behind.</QUOTE> The words struck awe into the assailants and caused the barristers to laugh. The mob, who had expected neither laughter nor armed resistance, took to flight, telling all whom they met that the bloody-minded lawyers were armed to the teeth and enjoying themselves. The Temple was saved. When these Gordon Rioters filled London with alarm, no member of the junior bar was more prosperous and popular than handsome Jack Scott, and as he walked from his house in Carey Street to the Temple, with his wife on his arm, he returned the greetings of the barristers, who, besides liking him for a good fellow, thought it prudent to be on good terms with a man sure to achieve eminence. Dilatory in his early as well as his later years, Scott left his house that morning half an hour late. Already it was known to the mob that the Templars were assembling in their college, and a cry of <QUOTE>The Temple! kill the lawyers!</QUOTE> had been raised in Whitefriars and Essex Street. Before they reached the Middle Temple gate Mr. and Mrs. Scott were assaulted more than once. The man who won Bessie Surtees from a host of rivals and carried her away against the will of her parents and the wishes of his own father, was able to protect her from serious violence. But before the beautiful creature was safe within the Temple her dress was torn, and when at length she stood in the centre of a crowd of excited and admiring barristers, her head was bare and her ringlets fell loose upon her shoulders. <QUOTE>The scoundrels have got your hat, Bessie,</QUOTE> whispered John Scott; <QUOTE>but never mind--they have left you your hair.</QUOTE>
<p>In Lord Eldon's <title>Anecdote Book</title> there is another gate story amongst the notes on the Gordon Riots. <QUOTE>We youngsters,</QUOTE> says the aged lawyer, <QUOTE>at the Temple determined that we would not remain inactive during such times; so we introduced ourselves into a troop to assist the military. We armed ourselves as well as we could, and next morning we drew up in the court ready to follow out a troop of soldiers who were on guard. When, however, the soldiers had passed through the gate it was suddenly shut in our faces, and the officer in command shouted from the other side,  <Q>Gentlemen, I am much obliged to you for your intended assistance; but I do not choose to allow my soldiers to be shot, so I have ordered you to be locked in.</Q> </QUOTE> And away he galloped.
<p>The elder Colman decided on making the younger <num value="1">one</num> a barrister; and after visits to Scotland and Switzerland, the son returned to Soho Square, and found that his father had taken for him chambers in the Temple, and entered him as a student at Lincoln's Inn, where he afterwards kept a few terms by eating oysters. Upon this Mr. Peake notes:-- <QUOTE>The students of Lincoln's Inn keep term by dining, or pretending to dine, in the hall during the term time. Those who feed there are accommodated with wooden trenchers instead of plates, and previously to the dinner oysters are served up by way of prologue to the play. Eating the oysters, or going into the hall without eating them, if you please, and then departing to dine elsewhere, is quite sufficient for term-keeping.</QUOTE> The chambers in King's Bench Walk were furnished with a tent-bedstead, <num value="2">two</num> tables, half-a-dozen chairs, and a carpet as much too scanty for the boards as Sheridan's <QUOTE>rivulet of rhyme</QUOTE> for its <QUOTE>meadow of margin.</QUOTE> To these the elder Colman added <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> worth of law books which had been given to him in his own Lincoln's Inn days by Lord Bath; then enjoining the son to work hard, the father left town upon a party of pleasure.
<p>Colman had sent his son to Switzerland to get him away from a certain Miss Catherine Morris, an actress of the Haymarket company. This answered for a time, but no sooner had the father left the son in the Temple than he set off with Miss Morris <pb id="p.166" n="166"> to Gretna Green, and was there married, in <datestruct value="1784--"><year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct>; and <num value="4">four</num> years after, the father's sanction having been duly obtained, they were publicly married at Chelsea Church.
<p>In the same staircase with Colman, in the Temple, lived the witty Jekyll, who, seeing in Colman's chambers a round cage with a squirrel in it, looked for a minute or <num value="2">two</num> at the little animal, which was performing the same operation as a man in the treadmill, and then quietly said, <QUOTE>Ah, poor devil! he is going the Home Circuit ;</QUOTE> the locality where it was uttered--the Temple-favouring this technical joke.
<p>On the morning young Colman began his studies  (<datestruct VALUE="1784-12-20"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=20>20</day>, <year reg=1784>1784</year></datestruct>) he was interrupted by the intelligence that the funeral procession of the great r. Johnson was on its way from his late residence, Bolt Court, through Fleet Street, to Westminster Abbey. Colman at once threw down his pen, and ran forth to see the procession, but was disappointed to find it much less splendid and imposing than the sepulchral pomp of Garrick <num value="5">five</num> years before.
<p>Dr. Dibdin thus describes the Garden walks of the last century:-- <QUOTE>Towards evening it was the fashion for the leading counsel to promenade during the summer months in the Temple Gardens. Cocked hats and ruffles, with satin small-clothes and silk stockings, at this time constituted the usual evening dress. Lord Erskine, though a great deal shorter than his brethren, somehow always seemed to take the lead, both in place and in discourse, and shouts of laughter would frequently follow his dicta.</QUOTE>
<p>Ugly Dunning, afterwards the famous Lord Ashburton, entered the Middle Temple in <datestruct value="1752--"><year reg="1752">1752</year></datestruct>, and was called <num value="4">four</num> years later, in <datestruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>. Lord Chancellor Thurlow used to describe him wittily as <QUOTE>the knave of clubs.</QUOTE>
<p>Horne Tooke, Dunning, and Kenyon were accustomed to dine together, during the vacation, at a little eating-house in the neighbourhood of Chancery Lane for the sum of sevenpence-halfpenny each. <QUOTE>As to Dunning and myself,</QUOTE> said Tooke, <QUOTE>we were generous, for we gave the girl who waited upon us a penny a piece; but Kenyon, who always knew the value of money, sometimes rewarded her with a halfpenny, and sometimes with a promise.</QUOTE>

He generally had a levee of morning visitors, chiefly men of letters-Hawkesworth, Goldsmith, Murphy, Langton, Stevens, Beauclerk, &amp;c.-and sometimes learned ladies. <QUOTE>When Madame de Boufflers (the mistress of the Prince of Conti) was <num value="1">first</num> in England,</QUOTE> said Beauclerk, <QUOTE>she was desirous to see Johnson. I accordingly went with her to his chambers in the Temple, where she was entertained with his conversation for some time. When our visit was over, she and I left him, and were got into Inner Temple Lane, when all at once I heard a voice like thunder. This was occasioned by Johnson, who, it seems, upon a little reflection, had taken it into his head that he ought to have done the honours of his literary residence to a foreign lady of quality, and, eager to show himself a man of gallantry, was hurrying down the staircase in violent-agitation. He overtook us before we reached the Temple Gate, and, brushing in between me and Madame de Boufflers, seized her hand and conducted her to her coach. His dress was a rusty-brown morning suit, a pair of old shoes by way of slippers, &amp;c. A considerable crowd of people gathered round, and were not a little struck by his singular appearance.</QUOTE>

They talked of supper-parties with younger people, as well in the London chambers as in suburban lodgings; preceded by blind-man's buff, forfeits, or games of cards; and where Goldsmith, festively entertaining them all, would make frugal supper for himself off boiled milk. They related how he would sing all kinds of Irish songs; with what special enjoyment he gave the Scotch ballad of  <Q>Johnny Armstrong</Q>  (his old nurse's favourite); how cheerfully he would put the front of his wig behind, or contribute in any other way to the general amusement; and to what accompaniment of uncontrolled laughter he once  <Q>danced a minuet with Mrs. Seguin.</Q> </QUOTE>

In <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, Mr. Forster mentions a very characteristic story of Goldsmith's warmth of heart. He <num value="1">one</num> day found a poor Irish student (afterwards Dr. M&lsquo;Veagh M&lsquo;Donnell, a well-known physician) sitting and moping in despair on a bench in the Temple Gardens.

<p>In <datestruct VALUE="1774-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>, Goldsmith returned from Edgware to the Temple chambers, which he was trying to sell, suffering from a low nervous fever, partly the result of vexation at his pecuniary embarrassments. Mr. Hawes, an apothecary in the Strand (and <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> founders of the Humane Society), was called in; but Goldsmith insisted on taking James's fever-powders, a valuable medicine, but dangerous under the circumstances.

His debts amounted to over <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure>. <QUOTE>Was ever poet so trusted before?</QUOTE> writes Johnson to Boswell. The staircase of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.170.1">Brick Court was filled with poor outcasts</lemma> to whom Goldsmith had been kind and charitable. His coffin was opened by Miss Horneck, that a lock might be cut from his hair. Burke and Reynolds superintended the funeral, Reynolds' nephew (Palmer, afterwards Dean of Cashel) being chief mourner.

At <num value="5">five</num> o'clock on Saturday, the <datestruct value="04-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, Goldsmith was buried in the Temple churchyard.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.172.1">Ice Tree at Fountain</lemma></NOTE> for the smoky shrubs to have any consciousness of the brightest and purest-hearted little woman in the world, is a question for gardeners and those who are learned in the loves of plants. But that it was a good thing for that same paved yard to have such a delicate little figure flitting through it, that it passed like a smile from the grimy old houses and the worn flagstones, and left them duller, darker, sterner than before, there is no sort of doubt. The Temple fountain might have leaped up <num value="20">twenty</num> feet to greet the spring of hopeful maidenhood that in her person stole on, sparkling, through the dry and dusty channels of the law; the chirping sparrows, bred in Temple chinks and crannies, might have held their peace to listen to imaginary skylarks as so fresh a little creature passed; the dingy boughs, unused to droop, otherwise than in their puny growth, might have bent down in a kindred gracefulness to shed their benedictions on her graceful head; old love-letters, shut up in iron boxes in the neighbouring offices, and made of no account among the heaps of family papers into which they had strayed, and of which in their degeneracy they formed a part, might have stirred and fluttered with a moment's recollection of their ancient tenderness, as she went lightly by. Anything might have happened that did not happen, and never will, for the love of Ruth. <gap>

<p>Merrily the tiny fountain played, and merrily the dimples sparkled on its sunny face. John Westlock hurried after her. Softly the whispering water broke and fell, and roguishly the dimples twinkled as he stole upon her footsteps.

<P>Fig-tree Court derived its name from obvious sources. Next to the plane, that has the strange power of sloughing off its sooty bark, the fig seems the tree that best endures London's corrupted atmosphere. Thomas Fairchild, a Hoxton gardener, who wrote in <datestruct value="1722--"><year reg="1722">1722</year></datestruct> (quoted by Mr. Peter Cunningham), alludes to figs ripening well in the Rolls Gardens, Chancery Lane, and to the tree thriving in close places about Bridewell.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.172.5">The Inner Temple Library</lemma> stands on the terrace facing the river. The Parliament Chambers and Hall, in the Tudor style, were the work of Sidney Smirke, R.A., in <datestruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct>. The library, designed by Mr. Abrahams, is <num value="96">96</num> feet long, <num value="42">42</num> feet wide, and <num value="63">63</num> feet high; it has a hammer-beam roof. <num value="1">One</num> of the stained glass windows is blazoned with the arms of the Templars.

The north window is thought to too much resemble the great window at Westminster.
<P>Paper Buildings, a name more suitable for the offices of some City companies, were <num value="1">first</num> built in the reign of James I., by a Mr. Edward Hayward and others; and the learned Dugdale describes them as <num value="88">eighty-eight</num> feet long, <num value="20">twenty</num> feet broad, and <num value="4">four</num> storeys high. This Hayward was Selden's chamber-fellow, and to him Selden dedicated his <QUOTE>Titles of Honour.</QUOTE> Selden, according to Aubrey, had chambers in these pleasant riverside buildings, looking towards the gardens, and in the uppermost storey he had a little gallery, to pace in and meditate. The Great Fire swept away Selden's chambers, and their successors were de. stroyed by the fire which broke out in Mr. Maule's chambers. Coming home at. night from a dinnerparty, that gentleman, it is said, put the lighted candle under his bed by mistake. The stately new buildings were designed by Mr. Sidney Smirke, A.R.A., in <datestruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></datestruct>. The red brick and-stone harmonise pleasantly, and the overhanging oriels and angle turrets (Continental Tudor) are by no means ineffective.

He purchased laudanum, then threw, it away. He packed up his portmanteau to go to France and enter a monastery. He went down to the Custom House Quay, to throw himself into the river. He tried to stab himself. At last the poor fellows actually hung himself, and was only saved by an accident. The following is his own relation :
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Not <num value="1">one</num> hesitating thought now remained, but I fell greedily to the execution of my purpose. My garter was made of a broad piece of scarlet binding, with a sliding buckle, being sewn together at the ends. By. the help of the buckle I formed a noose, and fixed it about my-neck, straining it so tight that I hardly left a passage for my breath, or for the blood to circulate. The tongue of the buckle held it fast. At each corner of the bed was placed a wreath of carved work fastened by an iron pin, which passed up through the midst of it; the other part of the garter, which made a loop, I slipped over <num value="1">one</num> of them, and hung by it some seconds, drawing up my feet under me, that they might not touch the floor; but the iron bent, and the carved work slipped off, and the garter with it. I then fastened it to the frame of the tester, winding it round and tying it in a strong knot. The frame broke short, and let me down again.
<p>The <num value="3">third</num> effort was more likely to succeed. I set the door open, which reached to within a foot of the ceiling. By the help of a chair I could command the top of it, and the loop being large enough to admit a large angle of the door, was easily fixed, so as not to slip off again. I pushed away the chair with my feet, and hung at my whole length. While I hung there I distinctly heard a voice say <num value="3">three</num> times, <Q>Tis over!</Q> Though I am sure of the fact, and was so at the time, yet it did not at all alarm me or affect my resolution. I hung so long that I lost all sense, all consciousness of existence.
<p>When I came to myself again I thought I was in hell; the sound of my own dreadful groans was all that I heard, and a feeling like that produced by a flash of lightning just beginning to seize upon me,.passed over my whole body. In a few seconds I found myself fallen on my face to the floor. In about half a minute I recovered my feet, and reeling and struggling, stumbled into bed again.
<p>By the blessed providence of God, the garter which had held me till the bitterness of temporal death was past broke just before eternal death had taken place upon me. The stagnation of the blood under <num value="1">one</num> eye in a broad crimson spot, and a red circle round my neck, showed plainly that I had been on the brink of eternity. The latter, indeed, might have been occasioned by the pressure of the garter, but the former was certainly the effect of strangulation, for it was: not attended with the sensation of a bruise, as it must have been had I in m:my fall received &gt;<num value="1">one</num> in so tender a part; and I rather think the circle round my neck was owing to the same cause, for the, part was not excoriated, nor at all in pain.
<p>Soon after I got into bed I was surprised to hear a voice in the dining-room, where the laundress was lighting a fire. She had found the door unbolted, notwithstanding my design to fasten it, and must have passed the bed-chamber door while I was hanging on it, and yet never perceived me. She heard me fall, and presently came to ask me if was well, adding, she feared I had been in a fit.
<p>I sent her to a friend, to whom I related the whole affair, and dispatched him to my kinsman at the coffee-house. As soon as the latter arrived pointed to the broken garter which lay in the middle of the room, and apprised him also of the attempt I had been making. His words were, My dear Mr. Cowper, you terrify me! To be sure you cannot hold the office at this rate. <Q> Where is the deputation?</Q>  I gave him the key of the drawer where it was deposited, and his business requiring his immediate attendance, he took it <pb id="p.174" n="174"> away with him; and thus ended all my connection with the Parliament office.</QUOTE>

Sarah Malcolm, a laundress, aged <num value="22">twenty-two</num>, employed by a young barrister named Kerrol in the same court, gaining access to the rooms of an old lady named Duncomb, whom she knew to have money, strangled her and an old servant, and cut the throat of a young girl, whose bed she had probably shared.

She was, by special favour (for superiority even in wickedness has its admirers), buried in St. Sepulchre's Churchyard, from which criminals had been excluded for a century and a half. The corpse of the murderess was disinterred, and her skeleton, in a glass case, is still to be seen at the Botanic Garden, Cambridge.

Born in <datestruct value="1705--"><year reg="1705">1705</year></datestruct>, Murray was still a young man when, in <datestruct value="1738--"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct>, he made his brilliant speech on behalf of Colonel Sloper, against whom Colley Cibber's rascally son had brought an action for immorality with his wife, the lovely actress, who on the stage was the rival of Mrs. Clive, and in private life was remarkable for immorality and fascinating manners. Amongst the many clients who were drawn to Murray by that speech, Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, was neither the least powerful nor the least distinguished. Her grace began by sending the rising advocate a general retainer, with a fee of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> guineas, of which sum he accepted only the <num value="2">two</num>-hundredth part, explaining to the astonished duchess that  <Q>the professional fee, with a general retainer, could not be less nor more than <num value="5">five</num> guineas.</Q>  If Murray had accepted the whole sum he would not have been overpaid for his trouble, for her grace persecuted him with calls at most unseasonable hours. On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, returning to his chambers after  <Q>drinking champagne with the wits,</Q>  he found the duchess's carriage and attendants on King's Bench Walk.

But Murray, being at an unusually late supper-party, did not return till her grace had departed in an overpowering rage.  <Q>I could not make out, sir, who she was,</Q>  said Murray's clerk, describing her grace's appearance and manner,  <Q>for she would not tell me her name;

<p>Charles Lamb, who was born in Crown Office Row, in his exquisite way has sketched the benchers of the Temple whom he had seen pacing the terrace in his youth. Jekyll, with the roguish eye, and Thomas Coventry, of the elephantine step, the scarecrow of inferiors, the browbeater of equals, who made a solitude of children wherever he came, <pb id="p.177" n="177"> who took snuff by palmfuls, diving for it under the mighty flap of his old-fashioned red waistcoat. In the gentle Samuel Salt we discover a portrait of the employer of Lamb's father. Salt was a shy indolent, absent man, who never dressed for a dinner party but he forgot his sword. The day of Miss Blandy's execution he went to dine with a relative of the murderess, <num value="1">first</num> carefully schooled by his clerk to avoid the disagreeable subject. However, during the pause for dinner, Salt went to the window, looked out, pulled down his ruffles, and observed, <QUOTE>It's a gloomy day; Miss Blandy must be hanged by this time, I suppose.</QUOTE> Salt never laughed. He was a well-known toast with the ladies, having a fine figure and person. Coventry, on the other hand, was a man worth <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="500000">five hundred thousand</num>, and lived in a gloomy house, like a strongbox, opposite the pump in Serjeants' Inn, Fleet Street. Fond of money as he was, he gave away <num value="30000">30,000</num> at once to a charity for the blind, and kept a hospitable house. Salt was indolent and careless of money, and but for Lovel, his clerk; would have been universally robbed. This Lovel was a clever little fellow, with a face like Garrick, who could mould heads in clay, turn cribbage-boards, take a hand at a quadrille or bowls, and brew punch with any man of his degree in Europe. With Coventry and Salt, Peter Pierson often perambulated the terrace, with hands folded behind him Contemporary with these was Daines Barrington, a burly, square man. Lamb also mentions Burton, <QUOTE>a jolly negation,</QUOTE> who drew up the bills of fare for the parliament chamber, where the benchers dined; thin, fragile Wharry, who used to spitefully pinch his cat's ears when anything offended him; and Jackson, the musician, to whom the cook once applied for instructions how to write down <QUOTE>edge-bone of beef</QUOTE> in a bill of commons. Then there was Blustering Mingay, who had a grappling-hook in substitute for a hand he had lost, which Lamb, when a child, used to take for an emblem of power; and Baron Mascres, who retained the costume of the reign of George II.

<p>In his <title>Essays,</title> Lamb says : <QUOTE><p>I was born and passed the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="7">seven</num> years of my life in the Temple. Its church, its halls, its gardens, its fountain, its river I had almost said--for in those young years what was the king of rivers to me but a stream that watered our pleasant places?-these are of my oldest recollections. I repeat, to this day, no verses to myself more frequently or with kindlier emotion than those of Spenser where he speaks of this spot. Indeed, it is the most elegant spot in the metropolis. What a transition for a countryman visiting London for the <num value="1">first</num> time--the passing from tihe crowded Strand or Fleet Street, by unexpected avenues, into its magnificent, ample squares, its classic green recesses! What a cheerful, liberal look hath that portion of it which, from <num value="3">three</num> sides, overlooks the greater garden, that goodly pile
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Of buildings strong, albeit of paper hight,</QUOTE>
confronting with massy contrast, the lighter, older, more fantastically shrouded <num value="1">one</num> named of Harcourt, with the cheerful Crown Office Row (place of my kindly engendure), right opposite the stately stream, which washes the garden foot with her yet scarcely trade-polluted waters, and seems but just weaned from Twickenham Naiades! A man would give something to have been born in such places. What a collegiate aspect has that fine Elizabethan hall, where the fountain plays, which I have made to rise and fall, how many times! to the astonishment of the young urchins, my contemporaries, who, not being able to guess at its recondite machinery, were almost tempted to hail the wondrous work as magic. <gap>

<p>So may the winged horse, your ancient badge and cognisance, still flourish! So may future Hookers and Seldens illustrate your church and chambers! So may the sparrows, in default of more melodious quiristers, imprisoned hop about your walks! So may the fresh-coloured and cleanly nursery-maid, who by leave airs her playful charge in your stately gardens, drop her prettiest blushing curtsey as ye pass, reductive of juvenescent emotion! So may the younkers of this generation eye you, pacing your stately terrace, with the same superstitious veneration with which the child Elia gazed on the old worthies that solemnised the parade before ye!</QUOTE>

<p>There are many old Temple anecdotes relating to that learned disciple of Bacchus,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.178.1">Porson</lemma>. Many a time (says Mr. Timbs), at early morn, did Porson stagger from his old haunt, the <QUOTE>Cider Cellars</QUOTE> in, Maiden Lane, where he scarcely ever failed to pass some hours, after spending the evening elsewhere. It is related of him, upon better authority than most of the stories told to his discredit, that <num value="1">one</num> night, or rather morning, Gurney (the Baron), who had chambers in Essex Court under Porson's, was awakened by a tremendous thump in the chamber above. Porson had just come home dead drunk, and had fallen on the floor. Having extinguished the candle in the fall, he presently staggered downstairs to re-light it, and Gurney heard him dodging and poking with the candle at the staircase lamp for about <num value="5">five</num> minutes, and all the time very lustily cursing the nature of things.
<p>We read also of Porson's shutting himself up in these chambers for <num value="3">three</num> or, <num value="4">four</num> days together, admitting no visitor. <num value="1">One</num> morning his friend Rogers went to call, having ascertained from the barber's hard by that Porson was at home, but had not been seen by any <num value="1">one</num> for <num value="2">two</num> days. Rogers proceeded to his chambers, and knocked at the door more than once; he would not open it, and Rogers came downstairs, but as he was crossing the court Porson opened the window and stopped him. He was then busy about the Grenville
<title>Homer,</title> for which he collated the Harleian MS. of the <title>Odyssey</title>, and received for his labour but <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="50">50</num></measure> and a large-paper copy. His chambers must have presented a strange scene, for he used books most cruelly, whether they were his own or belonged to others. He said that he possessed more <hi rend=italics>bad</hi>
copies of <hi rend=italics>good</hi> books than any private gentleman in England.
<p>Rogers, when a Templar, occasionally had some visitors who absorbed more of his time than was always agreeable; an instance of which he thus relates: <QUOTE>When I lived in the Temple, Mackintosh and Richard Sharp used to come to my chambers and stay there for hours, talking metaphysics. <num value="1">One</num> day they were so intent on their  <Q> <num value="1">first</num> cause,</Q>   <Q> spirit,</Q>  and  <Q>matter,</Q>  that they were unconscious of my having left them, paid a visit, and returned. I was a little angry at this; and to show my indifference about them, I sat down and wrote letters, without taking any notice of them. I never met a man with a fuller mind than Mackintosh-such readiness on all subjects, such a talker.</QUOTE>
<p>Before any person can-be admitted a member of the Temple, he must furnish a statement in writing, describing his age, residence, and condition in life, and adding a certificate of his respectability and fitness, signed by himself and a bencher of the society, or <num value="2">two</num> barristers. The <title>Middle Temple</title> requires the signatures of <num value="2">two</num> barristers of that Inn and of a bencher, but in each of the <num value="3">three</num> other Inns the signatures of barristers of any of the <num value="4">four</num> Inns will suffice. No person is admitted without the approbation of a bencher, or of the benchers in council assembled.
<p>The <title>Middle Temple</title> includes the universities of Durham and London. At the <title>Inner Temple</title> the candidate for admission who has taken the degree of B.A., or passed an examination at the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, or London, is required to pass an examination by a barrister, appointed by the Bench for that purpose, in the Greek and Latin languages, and history or literature in general. No person in priest's or deacon's orders can be called to the bar. In the <title>Inner Temple</title>, an attorney must have ceased to be on the rolls, and an articled clerk to be in articles <hi rend=italics>for <num value="3">three</num> years</hi>, before he can be called to the bar.
<p>Legal students worked hard in the old times; Coke's career is an example. In. <datestruct value="1572--"><year reg="1572">1572</year></datestruct> he rose every morning at <num value="5">five</num> o'clock, lighting his own fire; and then read Bracton, Littleton, and the ponderous folio abridgments of the law till the court met, at <num value="8">eight</num> o'clock. He then took boat for Westminster, and heard cases argued till <datestruct value="12"><year reg="12">twelve</year></datestruct> o'clock, when the pleas ceased for dinner. After a meal in the Inner Temple Hall, he attended <QUOTE>readings</QUOTE> or lectures in the afternoon, and then resumed his private studies till supper-time at <num value="5">five</num>. Next came the moots, after which he slammed his chamber-door, and set to work with his commonplace book to index all the law he had amassed during tlie day. At <num value="9">nine</num>, the steady student went to bed, securing <num value="3">three</num> good hours of sleep before midnight. It is said Coke never saw a play or read a play in his life-and that was Shakespeare's time In the reign of James I. the Temple was often called <QUOTE>my Lord Coke's shop.</QUOTE> e had become a great lawyer then, and lived to become Lord Chief Justice. Pity &lsquo;tis that we have <pb id="p.179" n="179"> to remember that he reviled Essex and insulted Raleigh. King James once said of Coke in misfortune that he was like a cat, he always fell on his feet.
<p>History does not record many riots in the Temple, full of wild life as that quiet precinct has been. In different reigns, however, <num value="2">two</num> outbreaks occurred. In both cases the Templars, though rather hot and prompt, seem to have been right. At the dinner of John Prideaux, reader of the Inner Temple, in <datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>, the students took offence at Sir John Lyon, the Lord Mayor, coming in state, with his sword up, and the sword was dragged down as he passed through the cloisters. The same sort of affray took place again in <datestruct value="1669--"><year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct>, when Lord Mayor Peake came to Sir Christopher Goodfellow's feast, and the Lord Mayor had to be hidden in a bencher's chambers till, as Pepys relates, the fiery young sparks were decoyed away to dinner. The case was tried before Charles II., <hi rend=italics>and</hi>
Heneage Finch pleaded for the Temple, claiming immemorial exemption from City jurisdiction. The case was never decided. From that day to this (says Mr. Noble) a settlement appears never to have been made; hence itis that the Temples claim to be <QUOTE>extra parochial,</QUOTE> closing nightly all their gates as the clock strikes <num value="10">ten</num>, and keeping extra watch and ward when the parochial authorities <QUOTE>beat the bounds</QUOTE> upon Ascension Day. Many struggles have taken place to make the property rateable, and even of late the question has once more arisen; and it is hardly to be wondered at, for it would be a nice bit of business to assess the Templars upon the <measure value="32866l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="32866">32,866</num></measure> which they have returned as the annual rental of their estates.
<p>

<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.179.1">A <num value="3">third</num> riot</LEMMA> was with those ceaseless enemies of the Templars, the Alsatians, or lawless inhabitants of disreputable Whitefriars. . In <datestruct VALUE="1691-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1691">1691</year></datestruct>, weary of their riotous and thievish neighbours, the benchers of the Inner Temple bricked up the gate (still existing in King's Bench Walk) leading into the high street of Whitefriars; but the Alsatians, swarming out, pulled down as fast as the bricklayers built up. The Templars hurried together, swords flew out, the Alsatians plied pokers and shovels, and many heads were broken. Ultimately, <num value="2">two</num> men were killed, several wounded, and many hurried off to prison. Eventually, the ringleader of the Alsatians, Captain Francis White--a <QUOTE>copper captain,</QUOTE> no doubt--was convicted of murder, in <datestruct VALUE="1693-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1693">1693</year></datestruct>. This riot eventually did good, for it led to the abolition of London sanctuaries, those dens of bullies, low gamblers, thieves, and courtesans.
<p>As the Middle Temple has grown gradually poorer and more neglected, many curious customs of the old banquets have died out. The loving cup, once fragrant with sweetened sack, is now used to hold the almost superfluous toothpicks.

Yet the rich and epicurean Inner Temple still cherishes many worthy customs, affects <foreign lang=fr>recherch&eacute;</foreign>
French dishes, and is curious in <foreign lang=la>entremets</foreign>; while the Middle Temple growls over its geological salad, that some hungry wit has compared to <QUOTE>eating a gravel walk, and meeting an occasional weed.</QUOTE> A writer in <title>Blackwood</title>, quoting the old proverb, <QUOTE>The Inner Temple for the rich, the Middle for the poor,</QUOTE> says few great men have come from the Middle Temple. How can acumen be derived from the scrag-end of a neck of mutton, or inspiration from griskins? At a late dinner, says Mr. Timbs (<datestruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct>), there were present only <num value="3">three</num> benchers, <num value="7">seven</num> barristers, and <num value="6">six</num> students.

At <num value="5">five</num>, or half-past <num value="5">five</num>, the barristers and students in their gowns follow the benchers in procession to the dais; the steward strikes the table solemnly a mystic <num value="3">three</num> times, grace is said by the treasurer, or senior bencher present, and the men of law fall to. In former times it was the custom to blow a horn in every court to announce the meal, but how long this ancient Templar practice has been discontinued we do not know. The benchers observe somewhat more style at their table than the other members do at theirs. The general repast is a tureen of soup, a joint of meat, a tart, and cheese, to each mess, consisting of <num value="4">four</num> persons, and each mess is allowed a bottle of port wine. Dinner is served daily to the members of the Inn during term time; the masters of the Bench dining on the state, or dais, and the barristers and students at long tables extending down the hall. On grand days the judges are present, who dine in succession with each of the <num value="4">four</num> Inns of Court. To the parliament chamber, adjoining the hall, the benchers repair after dinner. The loving cups used on certain grand occasions are huge silver goblets, which are passed down the table, filled with a delicious composition, immemorially termed <QUOTE>sack,</QUOTE> consisting of sweetened and exquisitely-flavoured white wine. The butler attends the progress of the cup, to replenish it; and each student is by rule restricted to a <hi rend=italics>sip</hi>; yet it is recorded that once, though the number present fell short of <num value="70">seventy</num>, <num value="36">thirty-six</num> quarts of the liquid were sipped away. At the Inner Temple, on <datestruct value="05-29"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=29>29th</day></datestruct>, <pb id="p.180" n="180"> a gold cup of sack is handed to each member, who drinks to the happy restoration of Charles II.
<p>The writer in <title>Blackwood</title> before referred to alludes to the strict silence enjoined at the Inner Temple dinners, the, only intercourse between the several members of the mess being the usual social scowl vouchsafed by your true-born Englishman to persons who have not the honour of his acquaintance. You may, indeed, on an emergency, ask your neighbour for the salt; but then it is also perfectly understood that he is not obliged to notice your request.
<p>The old term of <QUOTE>calling to the bar</QUOTE> seems to have originated in the custom of summoning students, that had attained a certain standing, to the bar that separated the benchers' dais from the hall, to take part in certain probationary
<FIGURE id="Fig.180" n="2000.06.0064"><HEAD>Sun-Dial In The Temple (see page <num value="177">177</num>).</HEAD></FIGURE>
 mootings or discussions on points of law. The mere student sat farthest from the bar.
<p>When these mootings were discontinued deponent sayeth not. In Coke's time (<datestruct value="1543--"><year reg="1543">1543</year></datestruct>), that great lawyer, after supper at <num value="5">five</num> o'clock, used to join the moots, when questions of law were proposed. and discussed, when fine on the garden terrace, in rainy weather in the Temple cloisters. The dinner alone now remains; dining is now the only legal study of Temple students.
<p>In the <title>Middle Temple</title> a <num value="3">three</num> years' standing and <num value="12">twelve</num> commons kept suffices to entitle a gentleman to be called to the bar, provided he is above <num value="23">twenty-three</num> years of age. No person can be called to the bar at any of the Inns of Court before he is <num value="21">twenty-one</num> years of age; and a standing of <num value="5">five</num> years is understood to be required of every <pb id="p.181" n="181"> member before being called. The members of the several universities, &amp;c., may, however, be called after <num value="3">three</num> years' standing.

<p>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.181.2">The Inner Temple Garden</lemma> (<num value="3">three</num> acres in extent) has probably been a garden from the time the white-mantled Templars <num value="1">first</num> came from Holborn and settled by the river-side. This little paradise of nurserymaids and London children is entered from the terrace by an iron gate (date, <datestruct value="1730"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>); and the winged horse that surmounts the portal has looked down on many a distinguished visitor. In the centre of the grass is such a
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.181.3">sun-dial</lemma> as Charles Lamb loved, with the date, <datestruct value="1770"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>. A little to the east of this stands
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.181.4">an old sycamore</lemma>, which, <num value="15">fifteen</num> years since, was railed in as the august mummy of that umbrageous tree under whose shade, as tradition says, Johnson and Goldsmith used to sit and converse. According to an engraving of <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct> there were formerly <num value="3">three</num> trees; so that Shakespeare himself may have sat under them and meditated on the Wars of the Roses. The print shows a brick terrace faced with stone, with a flight of steps at the north. The old river wall of <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct> stood <num value="50">fifty</num> or <num value="60">sixty</num> yards farther north than the
<FIGURE id="Fig.181" n="2000.06.0065"><HEAD>The Temple Stairs.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 present; and when Paper Buildings were erected, part of this wall was dug up. The view given on this page, and taken from an old view in the Temple, shows a portion of the old wall, with the doorway opening upon the Temple Stairs.
<p>The Temple Garden, half a century since, was famous for its white and red roses (the Old Provence, Cabbage, and the Maiden's Blush-Timbs); and the lime trees were delightful in the time of bloom. There were only <num value="2">two</num> steamboats on the river then; but the steamers and factory smoke soon spoiled everything but the hardy chrysanthemums. How ever, since the Smoke Consuming Act has been enforced, the roses, stocks, and hawthorns have again taken heart, and blossom with grateful luxuriance. In <datestruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></datestruct> Mr. Broome, the zealous gardener of the Inner Temple, exhibited at the Central Horticultural Society <num value="24">twenty-four</num> trusses of roses grown under his care. In the flower-beds next the main walk he managed to secure <num value="4">four</num> successive crops of flowers--the pompones were especially gaudy and beautiful; but his chief triumph were the
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.181.5">chrsyanthemums</lemma> of the northern border. The trees, however, seem delicate, and suffering from the cold <pb id="p.182" n="182"> winds, dwindle as they approach the river. The planes, limes, and wych elms stand best. The Temple rooks--the wise birds Goldsmith delighted to watch--were originally brought by Sir William Northcote from Woodcote Green, Epsom, but they left in disgust, many years since. Mr. Timbs says that <num value="200">200</num> families enjoy these gardens throughout the year, and about <num value="10000">10,000</num> of the outer world, chiefly children, who are always in search of the lost Eden, come here annually. The flowers and trees are rarely injured, thanks to the much-abused London public.
<p>In the secluded Middle Temple Garden is
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.182.1">an old catalpa tree</LEMMA>, supposed to have been planted by that grave and just judge, Sir Matthew Hale. On the lawn is a large table sun-dial, elaborately gilt and embellished. From the library oriel the Thames and its bridges, Somerset House and the Houses of Parliament, form a grand <hi rend=italics>coup d&lsquo;oeil.</hi>

<p>The revenue of the Middle Temple alone is said to be <num value="13000">13,000</num> a year. With the savings we are, of course, entirely ignorant. The students' dinners are half paid for by themselves, the library is kept up on very little fodder, and altogether the system of auditing the Inns of Court accounts is as incomprehensible as the Sybilline oracles; but there can be no doubt it is all right, and very well managed.
<p>In the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century (says Mr. Noble) a benevolent member of the Middle Temple conveyed to the benchers in fee several houses in the City, out of the rents of which to pay a stated salary to each of <num value="2">two</num> referees, who were to meet on <num value="2">two</num> days weekly, in term, from <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="5">five</num>, in the hall or other convenient place, and without fee on either side, to settle as best they could all disputes submitted to them. From that time the referees have been appointed, but there is no record of a single case being tried by them. The <num value="2">two</num> gentlemen, finding their office a sinecure, have devoted their salaries to making periodical additions to the library. May we be allowed to ask, was this benevolent object ever made known to the public generally? We cannot but think, if it had been, that the <num value="2">two</num> respected arbitrators would not have had to complain of the office as a sinecure.
<p>He who can enumerate the wise and great men who have been educated in the Temple can count off the stars on his finger and measure the sands of the sea-shore by teacupsful. To cull a few, we may mention that the Inner Temple boasts among its eminent members Audley, Chancellor to Henry VIII.; Nicholas Hare, of Hare Court celebrity; the great lawyer, Littleton (<datestruct value="1481--"><year reg="1481">1481</year></datestruct>), and Coke, his commentator; Sir Christopher Hatton, the dancing Chancellor; Lord Buckhurst; Selden; Judge Jeffries; Beaumont, the poet; William Browne, the author of <title>Britannia's Pastorals</title> (so much praised by the Lamb and Hazlitt school); Cowper, the poet; and Sir William Follett.
<p>From the Middle Temple have also sprung swarms of great lawyers. We may mention specially Plowden, the jurist, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Thomas Overbury (who was poisoned in the Tower), John Ford (<num value="1">one</num> of the latest of the great dramatists), Sir Edward Bramston (chamber-fellow to Mr. Hyde, afterwards Lord Clarendon), Bulstrode Whitelocke (<num value="1">one</num> of Cromwell's Ministers), Lord- Keeper Guildford (Charles II.), Lord Chancellor omers, Wycherley and Congreve (the dramatists), Shadwell and Southern (comedy writers), Sir William Blackstone, Edmund Burke, Sheridan, Dunning  (Lord Ashburton), Lord Chancellor Eldon, Lord Stowell, as a few among a multitude.

<P>So rich is London in legend and tradition, that even some of the spots that now appear the blankest, baldest, and most uninteresting, are really vaults of entombed anecdote and treasurehouses of old story. Whitefriars that dull, narrow, uninviting lane sloping from Fleet Street to the river, with gas works at its foot and mean shops on either sidewas once the centre of a district full of noblemen's mansions; but Time's harlequin wand by-and-by <pb id="p.183" n="183"> turned it into a debtors' sanctuary and thieves' paradise, and for half a century its bullies and swindlers waged a ceaseless war with their proud and rackety neighbours of the Temple. The dingy lane, now only awakened by the quick wheel of the swift newspaper cart or the ponderous tires of the sullen coal-wagon, was in olden times for ever ringing with clash of swords, the cries of quarrelsome gamblers, and the drunken songs of noisy Bobadils.
<p>In the reign of Edward I., a certain Sir Robert Gray, moved by qualms of conscience or honest impulse, founded on the bank of the Thames, east of the well-guarded Temple, a Carmelite convent, with broad gardens, where the white friars might stroll, and with shady nooks where they might con their missals. Bouverie Street and Ram Alley were then part of their domain, and there they watched the river and prayed for their patrons' souls. In <datestruct value="1350--"><year reg="1350">1350</year></datestruct> Courtenay, Earl of Devon, rebuilt the Whitefriars Church, and in <datestruct value="1420--"><year reg="1420">1420</year></datestruct> a Bishop of Hereford added a steeple. In time, greedy hands were laid roughly on cope and chalice, and Henry VIII., seizing on the friars' domains, gave his physician--that Doctor Butts mentioned by Shakespeare--the chapter-house for a residence. Edward VI.--who, with all his promise, was as ready for such pillage as his tyrannical father-pulled down the church, and built noblemen's houses in its stead. The refectory of the convent, being preserved, afterwards became the Whitefriars Theatre. The mischievous right of sanctuary was preserved to the district, and confirmed by James I., in whose reign the slum became jocosely known as Alsatiafrom Alsace, that unhappy frontier then, and later, contended for by French and Germans-just as Chandos Street and that shy neighbourhood at the north-west side of the Strand used to be called the Caribbee Islands, from its countless straits and intricate thieves' passages. The outskirts of the Carmelite monastery had no doubt become disreputable at an early time, for even in Edward III.'s reign the holy friars had complained of the gross temptations of Lombard Street (an alley near Bouverie Street). Sirens and Dulcineas of all descriptions were ever apt to gather round monasteries. Whitefriars, however, even as late as Cromwell's reign, preserved a certain respectability; for here, with his supposed wife, the Dowager Countess of Kent, Selden lived and studied.
<p>In the reign of James I. a strange murder was committed in Whitefriars. The cause of the crime was highly singular. In <datestruct value="1607--"><year reg="1607">1607</year></datestruct> young Lord Sanquhar, a Scotch nobleman, who with others of his countrymen had followed his king to England, had an eye put out by a fencing-master of Whitefriars. The young lord--a man of a very ancient, proud, and noble Scotch family, as renowned for courage as for wit-had striven to put some affront on the fencing-master at Lord Norris's house, in Oxfordshire, wishing to render him contemptible before his patrons and assistants--a common bravado of the rash Tybalts and hot-headed Mercutios of those fiery days of the duello, when even to crack a nut too loud was enough to make your tavern neighbour draw his sword. John Turner, the master, jealous of his professional honour, challenged the tyro with dagger and rapier, and, determined to chastise his ungenerous assailant, parried all his most skilful passadoes and staccatoes, and in his turn pressed Sanquhar with his foil so hotly and boldly that he unfortunately thrust out <num value="1">one</num> of his eyes. The young baron, ashamed of his own rashness, and not convinced that Turner's thrust was only a slip and an accident, bore with patience several days of extreme danger. As for Turner, he displayed natural regret, and was exonerated by everybody. Some time after, Lord Sanquhar being in the court of Henry IV. of France, that chivalrous and gallant king, always courteous to strangers, seeing the patch of green taffeta, unfortunately, merely to make conversation, asked the young Scotchman how he lost his eye. Sanquhar, not willing to lose the credit of a wound, answered cannily, <QUOTE>It was done, your majesty, with a sword.</QUOTE> The king replied, thoughtlessly, <QUOTE>Doth the man live?</QUOTE> and no more was said. This remark, however, awoke the viper of revenge in the young man's soul. He brooded over those words, and never ceased to dwell on the hope of some requital on his old opponent. <num value="2">Two</num> years he remained in France, hoping that his wound might be cured, and at last, in despair of such a result, set sail for England, still brooding over revenge against the author of his cruel and, as it now appeared, irreparable misfortune. The King of Denmark, James's toss-pot father-in-law, was on a visit here at the time, and the court was very gay. The <num value="1">first</num> news that Lord Sanquhar heard was, that the accursed Turner was down at Greenwich Palace, fencing there in public matches before the <num value="2">two</num> kings. To these entertainments the young Scotchman went, and there, from some corner of a gallery, the man with a patch over his eye no doubt scowled and bit his lip at the fencing-master, as he strutted beneath, proud of his skill!and flushed with triumph. The moment the prizes were given, Sanquhar hurried below, and sought Turner up and down, through court and corridor, resolved to stab him on the spot, though even drawing a <pb id="p.184" n="184"> sword in the precincts of the palace was an offence punishable with the loss of a hand. Turner, however, at that time escaped, for Sanquhar never came across him in the throng, though he beat it as a dog beats a covert. The next day, therefore, still on his trail, Lord Sanquhar went after him. to London, seeking for him up and down the Strand, and in all the chief Fleet Street and Cheapside taverns. The Scot could not have come to a more dangerous place than London. Some, with malicious pity, would tell him that Turner had vaunted of his skilful thrust, and the way he had punished a man who tried to publicly shame him. Others would thoughtlessly lament the spoiling of a good swordsman and a brave soldier. The mere sight of the turnings to Whitefriars would rouse the evil spirit nestling in Sanquhar's heart. Eagerly he sought for Turner, till he found he was gone down to Norris's house, in Oxfordshire--the very place where the fatal wound had been inflicted. Being thus for the time foiled, Sanquhar returned to Scotland, and for the present delayed his revenge. On his next visit to London Sanquhar, cruel and steadfast as a bloodhound, again sought for Turner. Yet the difficulty was to surprise the man, for Sanquhar was well known in all the taverns and fencing-schools of Whitefriars, and yet did not remember Turner sufficiently well to be sure of him. He therefore hired <num value="2">two</num> Scotchmen, who undertook his assassination; but, in spite of this, Turner somehow or other was hard to get at, and escaped his <num value="2">two</num> pursuers and the relentless man whose money had bought them. Business then took Sanquhar again to France, but on his return the brooding revenge, now grown to a monomania, once more burst into a flame.
<p>At last he hired Carlisle and Gray, <num value="2">two</num> Scotchmen, who were to take a lodging in Whitefriars, to discover the best way for Sanquhar himself to strike a sure, blow at the unconscious fencingmaster. These men, after some reconnoitring, assured their employer that he could not himself get at Turner, but that they would undertake to do so, to which Sanquhar assented. But Gray's heart failed him after this, and he slipped away, and Turner went again out of town, to fence at some country mansion. Upon this Carlisle, a resolute villain, came to his employer and told him with grim set face that, as Gray had deceived him and there was <QUOTE>trust in no knave of them all,</QUOTE> he would e'en have nobody but himself, and would assuredly kill Turner on his return, though it were with the loss of his own life. Irving, a Border lad, and page to Lord Sanquhar, ultimately joined Carlisle in the assassination .
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1612-05-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct>, about <num value="7">seven</num> o'clock in the evening, the <num value="2">two</num> murderers came to a tavern in Whitefriars, which Turner usually frequented as he returned from his fencing-school. Turner, sitting at the door with <num value="1">one</num> of his friends, seeing the men, saluted them, and asked them to drink. Carlisle turned to cock the pistol he had prepared, then wheeled round, and drawing the pistol from under his coat, discharged it full at the unfortunate fencing-master, and
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.184.1">shot him near</LEMMA> the left breast. Turner had only time to cry, <QUOTE>Lord have mercy upon me--I am killed,</QUOTE> and fell from the ale-bench, dead. Carlisle and Irving at once fled-Carlisle to the, town, Irving towards the river; but the, latter, mistaking a court where wood was sold for the turning into an alley, was instantly run down and taken. Carlisle was caught in Scotland, Gray as he was shipping at a sea-port for Sweden; and Sanquhar himself, hearing <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">one hundred</num> pounds</measure> were offered for his head, threw himself on the king's mercy by surrendering himself as an object of pity to the Archbishop of Canterbury. But no intercession could avail. It was necessary for James to show that he would not spare Scottish more than English malefactors.
<p>Sanquhar was tried in Westminster Hall on the <datestruct value="06-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, before Mr. Justice Yelverton. Sir Francis Bacon, the Solicitor-General, did what he could to save the revengeful Scot, but it was impossible to keep him from the gallows. Robert Creighton, Lord Sanquhar, therefore, confessed himself guilty, but pleaded extenuating circumstances. He had, he said, always believed that Turner boasted he had put out his eye of set. purpose, though at the taking up the foils he (Sanquhar) had specially protested that he played as a scholar, and not as <num value="1">one</num> able to contend with a master in the profession. The mode of playing among scholars was always to spare the face.
<p> <QUOTE>After this loss of my eye,</QUOTE> continued the quasi-repentant murderer, <QUOTE>and with the great hazard of the loss of life, I must confess that I ever kept a grudge of my soul against Turner, but had no purpose to take so high a revenge; yet in the course of my revenge I considered not my wrongs upon terms of Christianity--for then I should have sought for other satisfaction--but, being trained. up in the courts of princes and in arms, I stood upon the terms of honour, and thence befell this act of dishonour, whereby I have offended--<num value="1">first</num>, God; <num value="2">second</num>, my prince; <num value="3">third</num>, my native country;, <num value="4">fourth</num>, this, country; <num value="5">fifth</num>, the party murdered; <num value="6">sixth</num>, his wife; <num value="7">seventh</num>, posterity; .<num value="8">eighth</num>, Carlisle, now to be executed; and lastly, <num value="9">ninth</num>, my own soul, and I am now to die for my offence. But, my <pb id="p.185" n="185"> lords,</QUOTE> he added, <QUOTE>besides my own offence, which in its nature needs no aggravation, divers scandalous reports are given out which blemish my reputation, which is more dear to me than my life: <num value="1">first</num>, that I made show of reconciliation with Turner, the which, I protest, is utterly untrue, for what I have formerly said I do again assure your good lordships, that ever after my hurt received I kept a grudge in my soul against him, and never made the least pretence of reconciliation with him. Yet this, my lords, I will say, that if he would have confessed and sworn he did it not of purpose, and withal would have foresworn arms, I would have pardoned him; for, my lords, I considered that it must be done either of set purpose or ignorantly. If the <num value="1">first</num>, I had no occasion to pardon him; if the last, that is no excuse in a master, and therefore for revenge of such a wrong I thought him unworthy to bear arms.</QUOTE>
<P>Lord Sanquhar then proceeded to deny the aspersion that he was an ill-natured fellow, ever revengeful, and delighting in blood. He confessed, however, that he was never willing to put up with a wrong, nor to pardon where he had a power to retaliate. He had never been guilty of blood till now, though he had occasion to draw his sword, both in the field and on sudden violences, where he had both given and received hurts. He allowed that, upon commission from the king to suppress wrongs done him in his own country, he had put divers of the Johnsons to death, but for that he hoped he had need neither to ask God nor man for forgiveness. He denied, on his salvation, that by the help of his countrymen he had attempted to break prison and escape. The condemned prisoner finally begged the lords to let the following circumstances move them to pity and the king to mercy:--<num value="1">First</num>, the indignity received from so mean a man; <num value="2">second</num>, that it was done willingly, for he had been informed that Turner had bragged of it after it was done; <num value="3">third</num>, the perpetual loss of his eye; <num value="4">fourth</num>, the want of law to give satisfaction in such a case; <num value="5">fifth</num>, the continued blemish he had received thereby.
<p>The Solicitor-General (Bacon), in his speech, took the opportunity of fulsomely be praising the king after his manner. He represented the sputtering, drunken, corrupt James as almost divine, in his energy and sagacity. He had stretched forth his long arms (for kings, he said, had long arms), and taken Gray as he shipped for Sweden, Carlisle ere he was yet warm in his house in Scotland. He had prosecuted the offenders <QUOTE>with the breath and blasts of his mouth;</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>so that,</QUOTE> said this gross time-server, <QUOTE>I may conclude that his majesty hath showed himself God's true lieutenant, and that he is no respecter of persons, but English, Scots, noblemen, fencers (which is but an ignoble trade), are all to him alike in respect of justice. Nay, I may say further, that his majesty hath had in this matter a kind of prophetical spirit, for at what time Carlisle and Gray, and you, my lord, yourself, were fled no man knew whither, to the <num value="4">four</num> winds, the king ever spoke in confident and undertaking manner, that wheresoever the offenders were in Europe, he would produce them to justice.</QUOTE>
<p>Mr. Justice Yelverton, though Bacon had altogether taken the wind out of his sails, summed up in the same vein, to prove that James was a Solomon and a prophet, and would show no favouritism to Scotchmen. He held out no hope of a reprieve. <QUOTE>The base and barbarous murder,</QUOTE> he said, with ample legal verbiage, <QUOTE>was exceeding strange;--done upon the sudden! done in an instant! done with a pistol! done with your own pistol! under the colour of kindness. As Cain talked with his brother Abel, he rose up and slew him. Your executioners of the murder left the poor miserable man no time to defend himself, scarce any time to breathe out those last words,  <Q>Lord, have mercy upon me!</Q>  The ground of the malice that you bore him grew not out of any offence that he ever willingly gave you, but out of the pride and haughtiness of your own self; for that in the false conceit of your own skill you would needs importune him to that action, the sequel whereof did most unhappily breed your blemish--the loss of your eye.</QUOTE> The manner of his death would be, no doubt, as he (the prisoner) would think, unbefitting to a man of his honour and blood (a baron of <num value="300">300</num> years' antiquity), but was fit enough for such an offender. Lord Sanquhar was then sentenced to be hung till he was dead. The populace, from whom he expected <QUOTE>scorn and disgrace,</QUOTE> were full of pity for a man to be cut off, like Shakespeare's Claudio, in his prime, and showed great compassion.
<p>On the <datestruct value="06-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct> (St. Peter's Day) Lord Sanquhar was hung before Westminster Hall. On the ladder he confessed the enormity of his sins, but said that till his trial, blinded by the devil, he could not see he had done anything unfitting a man of his rank and quality, who had been trained up in the wars, and had lived the life of a soldier, standing more on points of honour than religion. e then professed that he died a Roman Catholic, and begged all Roman Catholics present to pray for him. He had long, he said, for worldly reasons, neglected the public profession of his <pb id="p.186" n="186"> faith, and he thought God was angry with him. His religion was a good religion--a saving religion --and if he had been constant to it he was verily persuaded he should never have fallen into that misery. He then prayed for the king, queen, their issue, the State of England and Scotland, and the lords of the Council and Church, after which the wearied executioner threw him from the ladder, suffering him to hang a long time to display the king's justice. The compassion and sympathy of the people present had abated directly they found he was a Roman Catholic:The same morning, very early, Carlisle and Irving were hung on <num value="2">two</num> gibbets in Fleet Street, over against the great gate of the Whitefriars. The page's gibbet was <num value="6">six</num> feet higher than the serving-man's, it-being the custom at that time in Scotland that, when a gentleman was hung at the same time with <num value="1">one</num> of meaner quality, the gentleman had the honour of the higher gibbet, feeling much aggrieved.if he had not.
<P>The riotous little kingdom of Whitefriars, with all its frowzy and questionable population, has been admirably drawn by
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.186.1">Scott</lemma> in his fine novel of <title>The Fortunes of Nigel,</title> recently so pleasantly recalled

 to our remembrance by Mr. Andrew Halliday's dexterous dramatic adaptation. Sir Walter chooses a den of Alsatia as a sanctuary for young Nigel, after his duel with Dalgarno. At <num value="1">one</num> stroke of Scott's pen, the foggy, crowded streets eastward of the Temple rise before us, and are thronged with shaggy, uncombed ruffians, with greasy shoulderbelts, discoloured scarves, enormous moustaches, and torn hats. With what a Teniers' pencil the great novelist sketches the dingy precincts, with its blackguardly population:-- <QUOTE>The wailing of children,</QUOTE> says the author of <title>Nigel,</title> <QUOTE>the scolding of their mothers, the miserable exhibition of ragged linen hung from the windows to dry, spoke the wants and distresses of the wretched inhabitants; while the sounds of complaint were mocked and overwhelmed by the riotous shouts, oaths, profane songs, and boisterous laughter that issued from the alehouses and taverns, which, as the signs indicated, were equal in number to all the other houses; and that the full character of the place might be evident, several faded, tinselled, and painted females looked boldly at the strangers from their open lattices, or more modestly seemed busied with the cracked <pb id="p.187" n="187">

<p>The scoundrels and cheats of Whitefriars are admirably etched by Dryden's rival,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.188.1">Shadwell</lemma>. That unjustly-treated writer (for he was by no means a fool) has called <num value="1">one</num> of his comedies, in the Ben Jonson manner, <hi rend=italics>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.188.2">The Squire of Alsatia</lemma></hi> It paints the manners of the place at the latter end of Charles II.'s reign, when the dregs of an age that was indeed full of dregs were vatted in that disreputable sanctuary east of the Temple. The <QUOTE>copper captains,</QUOTE> the degraded clergymen who married anybody, without inquiry, for <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure>, the broken lawyers, skulking bankrupts, sullen homicides, thievish money-lenders, and gaudy courtesans, Dryden's burly rival has painted with a brush full of colour, and with a brightness, clearness, and sharpness. which are photographic in their force and truth. In his dedication, which is inscribed to that great patron of poets, the poetical Earl of Dorset, Shadwell dwells on the great success of the piece, the plot of which he had cleverly <QUOTE>adapted</QUOTE> from the <title>Adelphi</title> of Terence. In the prologue, which was spoken by Mountfort, the actor, whom the infamous Lord Mohun stabbed in Norfolk Street, the dramatist ridicules his tormenter Dryden, for his noise and bombast, and with some vigour writes-
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>With what prodigious scarcity of wit
<L>Did the new authors starve the hungry pit!
<L>Infected by the French, you must have rhyme,
<L>Which long to please the ladies' ears did chime.
<L>Soon after this came ranting fustian in,
<L>And none but plays upon the fret were seen,
<L>Such daring bombast stuff which fops would praise,
<L>Tore our best actors' lungs, cut short their days.
<L>Some in small time did this distemper kill;
<L>And had the savage authors gone on still,
<L>Fustian had been a new disease i&lsquo; the bill.</QUOTE>

<p>The moral of Shadwell's piece is the danger of severity in parents. An elder son, being bred up under restraint, turns a rakehell in Whitefriars, whilst the younger, who has had his own way, becomes <QUOTE>an ingenious, well-accomplished gentleman, a man of honour in King's Bench Walk, and of excellent disposition and temper,</QUOTE> in spite of a good deal more gallantry than our stricter age would pardon. The worst of it is that the worthy son is always being mistaken for the scamp, while the miserable Tony Lumpkin passes for a time as the pink of propriety. Eventually, he falls into the hands of some Alsatian tricksters. The <num value="1">first</num> of these, Cheatley, is a rascal who, <QUOTE>by reason of debts, does not stir out of Whitefriars, but there inveigles young men of fortune, and helps them to goods and money upon great disadvantage, is bound for them, and shares with them till he undoes them.</QUOTE> Shadwell tickets him, in his <foreign lang=la>dramatis personae</foreign>, as <QUOTE>a lewd, impudent, debauched fellow.</QUOTE> According to his own account, the cheat lies perdu, because his unnatural father is looking for him, to send him home into the country. Number <num value="2">two</num>, Shamwell, is a young man of fortune, who, ruined by Cheatley, has turned decoy-duck, and lives on a share of the spoil. His ostensible reason for concealment is that an alderman's young wife had run away with him. The <num value="3">third</num> rascal, Scrapeall, is a low, hypocritical moneylender, who is secretly in partnership with Cheatley. he <num value="4">fourth</num> rascal is Captain Hackman, a bullying coward, whose wife keeps lodgings, sells cherry brandy, and is of more than doubtful virtue. He had formerly been a sergeant in Flanders, but ran from his colours, dubbed himself captain, and sought refuge in the Friars from a paltry debt. his blustering scamp stands much upon his honour, and is alternately drawing his enormous sword and being tweaked by the nose. A lion in the estimation of fools, he boasts over his cups that he has whipped <num value="5">five</num> men through the lungs. He talks a detestable cant language, calling guineas <QUOTE>megs,</QUOTE> and half-guineas <QUOTE>smelts.</QUOTE> Money, with him is <QUOTE>the ready,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>the rhino,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>the darby;</QUOTE> a good hat is <QUOTE>a rum nab ;</QUOTE> to be well off is to be <QUOTE>rhinocerical.</QUOTE> This consummate scoundrel teaches young country Tony Lumpkins to break windows, scour the streets, to thrash the constables, to doctor the dice, and get into all depths of low mischief. Finally, when old Sir William Belfond, the severe old country gentleman, comes to confront his son, during his disgraceful revels at the <QUOTE>George</QUOTE> tavern, in Dogwell Court, Bouverie Street, the <num value="4">four</num> scamps raise a shout of <QUOTE>An arrest! an arrest! A bailiff! a bailiff!</QUOTE> The drawers join in the tumult; the Friars, in a moment, is in an uproar; and eventually the old gentleman is chased by all the scum of Alsatia, shouting at the top of their voices, <QUOTE>Stop! stop! A bailiff! a bailiff!</QUOTE> He has a narrow escape of being pulled to pieces, and emerges in Fleet Street, hot, bespattered, and bruised. It was no joke then to threaten the privileges of Whitefriars. <pb id="p.189" n="189">
<p>Presently a horn is blown, there is a cry from Water Lane to Hanging-sword Alley, from Ashen-tree Court to Temple Gardens, of <QUOTE>Tipstaff! An arrest! an arrest!</QUOTE> and in a moment they are <QUOTE>up in the Friars,</QUOTE> with a cry of <QUOTE>Fall on.</QUOTE> The skulking debtors scuttle into their burrows, the bullies fling down cup and can, lug out their rusty blades, and rush into the <hi rend=italics>melee.</hi>
From every den and crib red-faced, bloated women hurry with fire-forks, spits, cudgels, pokers, and shovels. They're <QUOTE>up in the Friars,</QUOTE> with a vengeance. Pouring into the Temple before the Templars can gather, they are about to drag old Sir William under the pump, when the worthy son comes to the rescue, and the Templars, with drawn swords, drive back the rabble, and make the porters shut the gates leading into Alsatia. Cheatley, Shamwell, and Hackman, taken prisoners, are then well drubbed and pumped on by the Templars, and the gallant captain loses half his whiskers. <QUOTE>The terror of his face,</QUOTE> he moans, <QUOTE>is gone?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Indeed,</QUOTE> says Cheatley, <QUOTE>your magnanimous phiz is somewhat disfigured by it, captain.</QUOTE> Cheatley threatened endless actions. Hackman swears his honour is very tender, and that this <num value="1">one</num> affront will cost him at least <num value="5">five</num> murders. As for Shamwell, he is inconsolable. <QUOTE>What reparation are actions?</QUOTE> he moans, as he shakes his wet hair and rubs his bruised back. <QUOTE>I am a gentleman, and can never show my face amongst my kindred more.</QUOTE> When at last they have got free, they all console themselves with cherry brandy from Hackman's shop, after which the <QUOTE>copper captain</QUOTE> observes, somewhat in Falstaff's manner, <QUOTE>A fish has a cursed life on't. I shall have that aversion to water after this, that I shall scarce ever be cleanly enough to wash my face again.</QUOTE>
<p>Later in the play there is still another rising in Alsatia, but this time the musketeers come in force, in spite of all privileges, and the scuffle is greater than ever. Some debtors run up and down without coats, others with still more conspicuous deficiencies. Some cry, <QUOTE>Oars! oars! sculler; <measure value="5l." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> pound</measure> for a boat; <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pound</measure> for a boat; <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> pound</measure> for a boat;</QUOTE> many leap from balconies, and make for the water, to escape to the Savoy or the Mint, also sanctuaries of that day. The play ends with a dignified protest, which doubtless proved thoroughly effective with the audience, against the privileges of places that harboured such knots of scoundrels. <QUOTE>Was ever,</QUOTE> Shadwell says, <QUOTE>such impudence suffered in a. Government? Ireland conquered; Wales subdued; Scotland united. But there are some few spots of ground in London, just in the face of the Government, unconquered yet, that hold in rebellion still. Methinks &lsquo;tis strange that places so near the king's palace should be no part of his dominions. &lsquo;Tis a shame in the society of law to countenance such practices. Should any place be shut against the king's writ or <foreign lang=la>posse comitatus</foreign>?</QUOTE>
<p>Be sure the pugnacious young Templars present all rose at that, and great was the thundering of red-heeled shoes. King William probably agreed with Shadwell, for at the latter end of his reign the privilege of sanctuary was taken from Whitefriars, and the dogs were at last let in on the rats for whom they had been so long waiting. <num value="2">Two</num> other places of refuge--the Mint:and the Savoyhow- ever, escaped a good deal longer; and there the Hackmans and Cheatleys of the day still hid their ugly faces after daylight had been let into Whitefriars and the wild days of Alsatia had ceased for ever.
<p>In earlier times there had been evidently special endeavours to preserve order in Whitefriars, for in the State Paper Office there exist the following rules for the inhabitants of the sanctuary in the reign of Elizabeth :
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><LIST>

<ITEM>Item. Theise gates shalbe orderly shutt and opened at convenient times, and porters appointed for the same. Also, a scavenger to keep the precincte clean.
<ITEM>Item. Tipling houses shalbe bound for good order.

<ITEM>Item. Lanterne and light to be mainteined duringe winter time.</list></QUOTE>

<p>All traces of its former condition have long since disappeared from Whitefriars, and it is difficult indeed to believe that the dull, uninteresting region that now lies between Fleet Street and the Thames was once the riotous Alsatia of Scott and Shadwell.
<p>And now we come to Bridewell, <num value="1">first</num> a palace, then <pb id="p.190" n="190"> a prison. The old palace of Bridewell (Bridget's Well) was rebuilt upon the site of the old Tower of Montfiquet (a soldier of the Conqueror's) by Henry VIII., for the reception of Charles V. of France in <datestruct value="1522--"><year reg="1522">1522</year></datestruct>. There had been a Roman fortification in the same place, and. a palace both of the Saxon and Norman kings. Henry I. partly rebuilt the palace; and in <datestruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></datestruct> a vault with Norman billet moulding was discovered in excavating the site of a public-house in Bride Lane. It remained neglected till Cardinal Wolsey (<hi rend=italics>circa</hi> <datestruct value="1512--"><year reg="1512">1512</year></datestruct>) came in pomp to live here. Here, in <datestruct value="1525--"><year reg="1525">1525</year></datestruct>, when Henry's affection for Anne Boleyn was growing, he made her father (Thomas Boleyn, Treasurer of the King's House) Viscount Rochforde. A letter of Wolsey's, <datestruct VALUE="1513-06-6"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=6>6</day>, <year reg=1513>1513</year></datestruct>, to the Lord Admiral, is dated from <QUOTE>my poor house at Bridewell;</QUOTE> and from <datestruct value="1515--"><year reg="1515">1515</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1521--"><year reg="1521">1521</year></datestruct> no less than <measure value="21924l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="21924">21,924</num></measure> was paid in repairs. Another letter from Wolsey, at Bridewell, mentions that the house of the Lord Prior of St. John's Hospital, at Bridewell, had been granted by the king for a record office. The palace must have been detestable enough to the monks, for it was to his palace of Bridewell that Henry VIII. summoned the abbots and other heads of religious societies, and succeeded in squeezing out of them <measure value="100000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure>, the contumacious Cistercians alone yielding up <measure value="33000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="33000">33,000</num></measure>.
<p>It was at the palace at Bridewell (in <datestruct value="1528--"><year reg="1528">1528</year></datestruct>) that
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.190.1">King Henry VIII</lemma> <num value="1">first</num> disclosed the scruples that, after his acquaintance with
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.190.2">Ann Boleyn</lemma>, troubled his sensitive conscience as to his marriage with
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.190.3">Katherine of Arragon</lemma>. <QUOTE>A few days later,</QUOTE> says Lingard, condensing the old chronicles, <QUOTE>the king undertook to silence the murmurs of the people, and summoned to his residence in the Bridewell the members of the Council, the lords of his Court, and the mayor, aldermen, and principal citizens. Before them he enumerated the several injuries which he had received from the emperor, and the motives which induced him to seek the alliance of France. Then, taking to himself credit for delicacy of conscience, he described the scruples which had long tormented his mind on account of his marriage with his deceased brother's widow. These he had at <num value="1">first</num> endeavoured to suppress, but they had been revived and confirmed by the alarming declaration of the Bishop of Tarbes in the presence of his Council. To tranquillise his mind he had recourse to the only legitimate remedy: he had consulted the Pontiff, who had appointed <num value="2">two</num> delegates to hear the case, and by their judgment he was determined to abide. He would therefore warn his subjects to be cautious how they ventured to arraign his conduct. The proudest among them should learn that he was their sovereign, and should answer with their heads for the presumption of their tongues.</QUOTE> Yet, notwithstanding he made all this parade of conscious superiority, Henry was prudent enough not by any means to refuse the aid of precaution. A rigorous search was made for arms, and all strangers, with the exception only of <num value="10">ten</num> merchants from each nation, were ordered to leave the capital.
<p>At the trial for divorce the poor queen behaved with much womanly dignity. <QUOTE>The judges,</QUOTE> says Hall, the chronicler, and after him Stow, <QUOTE>commanded the crier to proclaim silence while their commission was read, both to the court and the people assembled. That done, the scribes commanded the crier to call the king by the name of  <Q> King Henry of England, come into court,</Q>  &amp;c. With that the king answered, and said,  <Q>Here.</Q>  Then he called the queen, by the name of  <Q> Katherine, Queen of England, come into court,</Q>  &amp;c., who made no answer, but rose incontinent out of her chair, and because she could not come to the king directly, for the distance secured between them, she went about, and came to the king, kneeling down at his feet in the sight of all the court and people, to whom she said in effect these words, as followeth:  <Q>Sir,</Q>  quoth she,  <Q> I desire you to do me justice and right, and take some pity upon me, for I am a poor woman and a stranger, born out of your dominion, having here so indifferent counsel, and less assurance of friendship. Alas! sir, in what have I offended you? or what occasion of displeasure have I showed you, intending thus to put me from you after this sort? I take God to judge, I have been to you a true and humble wife, ever conformable to your will and pleasure; that never contrarised or gainsaid anything thereof; and being always contented with all things wherein you had any delight or dalliance, whether little or much, without grudge or countenance of discontent or displeasure. I loved for your sake all them you loved, whether I had cause or no cause, whether they were my friends or my enemies. I have been your wife these <num value="20">twenty</num> years or more, and you have had by me divers children; and when ye had me at the <num value="1">first</num>, I take God to be judge that I was a very maid; and whether it be true or not, I put it to your conscience. If there be any just cause that you can allege against me, either of dishonesty or matter lawful, to put me from you, I am content to depart, to my shame and rebuke; and if there be none, then I pray you to let me have justice at your hands. The king, your father, was, in his time, of such excellent wit, that he was accounted among all men for wisdom to be a <num value="2">second</num> Solomon; and the <pb id="p.191" n="191"> King of Spain, my father, Ferdinand, was reckoned <num value="1">one</num> of the wisest princes that reigned in Spain many years before. It is not, therefore, to be doubted but that they had gathered as wise counsellors unto them of every realm as to their wisdom they thought meet; and as to me seemeth, there were in those days as wise and well-learned in both realms as now at this day, who thought the marriage between you and me good and lawful. Therefore it is a wonder to me to hear what new inventions are now invented against me, that never intended but honesty, and now to cause me to stand to the order and judgment of this court. Ye should, as seemeth me, do me much wrong, for ye may condemn me for lack of answer, having no counsel but such as ye have assigned me; ye must consider that they cannot but be indifferent on my part, where they be your own subjects, and such as ye have taken and chosen out of your council, whereunto they be privy, and dare not disclose your will and intent. Therefore, I humbly desire you, in the way of charity, to spare me until I may know what counsel and advice my friends in Spain will advertise me to take; and if you will not, then your pleasure be fulfilled.</Q>  With that she rose up, making a low curtsey to the king, and departed from thence, people supposing that she would have resorted again to her former place, but she took her way straight out of the court, leaning upon the arm of <num value="1">one</num> of her servants, who was her receivergeneral, called Master Griffith. The king, being advertised that she was ready to go out of the house where the court was kept, commanded the crier to call her again by these words,  <Q> Katherine, Queen of England,</Q>  &amp;c. With that, quoth Master Griffith,  <Q>Madam, ye be called again.</Q>   <Q>Oh! oh!</Q>  quoth she,  <Q>it maketh no matter; it is no indifferent (impartial) court for me, therefore I will not tarry: go on your ways.</Q>  And thus she departed without any further answer at that time, or any other, and never would appear after in any court.</QUOTE>

There, in a long, dilapidated, tiled shed, a row of female prisoners are beating hemp on wooden blocks, while a truculent-looking warder, with an apron on, is raising his rattan to strike a poor girl not without some remains of her youthful beauty, who seems hardly able to lift the heavy mallet, while the wretches around leeringly deride her fine apron, laced hood, and figured gown. There are <num value="2">two</num> degraded men among the female hemp-beaters--<num value="1">one</num> an old card-sharper in laced coat and foppish wig; another who stands with his hands in a pillory, on which is inscribed the admonitory legend, <QUOTE>Better to work than stand thus.</QUOTE> A cocked hat and a dilapidated hoop hang on the wall. <pb id="p.193" n="193">

<title>Prisons.</title> He describes the rooms as offensive, and the prisoners only receiving a penny loaf a day each. The steward received eightpence a day for each prisoner, and a hemp-dresser, paid a salary of <num value="120">120</num>, had the profit of the culprits' labour. For bedding the prisoners had fresh straw given them once a month. It was the only London prison where either straw or bedding was allowed. No out-door exercise was permitted. In the year <datestruct value="1782"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct> there had been confined in Bridewell <num value="659">659</num> prisoners.
<p>In <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>, Pennant describes Bridewell as still having arches and octagonal towers of the old

 palace remaining, and a magnificent flight of ancient stairs leading to the court of justice. In the next room, where the whipping-stocks were, tradition says sentence of divorce was pronounced against Katherine of Arragon.
<p> <QUOTE>The <num value="1">first</num> time,</QUOTE> says Pennant, <QUOTE>I visited the place, there was not a single male prisoner, but about <num value="20">twenty</num> females. They were confined on a ground floor, and employed on the beating of hemp. When the door was opened by the keeper, they ran towards it like so many hounds in kennel, and presented a most moving sight. About <num value="20">twenty</num> young creatures, the eldest not exceeding <num value="16">sixteen</num>. many of them with angelic faces divested of every <pb id="p.194" n="194"> angelic expression, featured with impudence, impenitency, and profligacy, and clothed in the silken tatters of squalid finery. A magisterial--a national--opprobrium! What a disadvantageous contrast to the <title>Spinhaus</title>, in Amsterdam, where the confined sit under the eye of a matron, spinning or sewing, in plain and neat dresses provided by the public! No traces of their former lives appear in their countenances; a thorough reformation seems to have been effected, equally to the emolument and the honour of the republic. This is also the place of confinement for disobedient and idle apprentices. They are kept separate, in airy cells, and have an allotted task to be performed in a certain time. They, the men and wbmen, are employed in beating hemp, picking oakum, and packing of goods, and are said to earn their maintenance.</QUOTE>
<p>A writer in <title>Knight's London</title> (<datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>) gives a very bad account of Bridewell. <QUOTE>Bridewell, another place of confinement in the City of London, is under the jurisdiction of the governors, of Bridewell and Bethlehem Hospitals, but it is supported out of the funds of the hospital. The entrance is in Bridge Street, Blackfriars. The prisoners confined here are persons summarily convicted by the Lord Mayor and aldermen, and are, for the most part, petty pilferers, misdemeanants, vagrants, and refractory apprentices, sentenced to solitary confinement;which term need not terrify the said refractory offenders, for the persons condemned to solitude,</QUOTE> says the writer, <QUOTE><p>can with ease keep up a conversation with each other from morning to night. The total number of persons confined here in <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct> was <num value="1324">1,324</num>, of whom <num value="233">233</num> were under <num value="17">seventeen</num>, and <num value="466">466</num> were known or reputed thieves. In <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct> no employment was furnished to the prisoners. The men sauntered about from hour to hour in those chambers where the worn blocks still stood and exhibited the marks of the toil of those who are represented in Hogarth's prints.
<p>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.194.1">The treadmill</lemma> has been now introduced, and more than <num value="5">five</num>-sixths of the prisoners are sentenced to hard labour, the  <Q>mill</Q>  being employed in grinding corn for Bridewell, Bethlehem, and the House of Occupation. The  <Q><num value="7">Seventh</num> Report of the Inspectors of Prisons on the City Bridewell</Q>  is as follows:-- <Q> The establishment answers no <num value="1">one</num> object of imprisonment except that of safe custody. It does not correct, deter, nor reform; but we are convinced that the association to which all but the City apprentices are subjected proves highly injurious, counteracts any efforts that can be made for the moral and religious improvement of the prisoners, corrupts the less criminal, and confirms the degradation, of the more hardened offenders, The cells in the old part of the prison are greatly superior to those in the adjoining building, which is of comparatively recent erection, but the whole of the arrangements are exceedingly defective. It is quite lamentable to see such an injudicious and unprofitable expenditure as that which was incurred. in the erection of this part of the prison.</Q> </QUOTE>
<p>Latterly Bridewell was used as a receptacle for vagrants, and as a temporary lodging for paupers on their way to their respective parishes. The prisoners sentenced to hard labour were put on a treadmill which ground corn. The other prisoners picked junk. The women cleaned the prison, picked junk, and mended the linen. In <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>, there was built adjoining Bedlam a House of Occupation for young prisoners. It was decided that from the revenue of the Bridewell hospital (<measure value="12000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="12000">12,000</num></measure>) reformatory schools were to be built. The annual number of contumacious apprentices sent to Bridewell rarely exceeded <num value="25">twenty-five</num>, and when Mr. Timbs visited the prison in <datestruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></datestruct> he says he found only <num value="1">one</num> lad, out of the <num value="3000">three thousand</num> apprentices of the great City. In <datestruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct> (says Mr. Noble) the governors refused to receive a convicted apprentice, for the very excellent reason that there was no cell to receive him.
<p>The old court-room of Bridewell (<num value="84">84</num> by <num value="29">29</num>) was a handsome wainscoted room, adorned with a great picture, erroneously attributed to Holbein, and representing Edward VI. granting the Royal Charter of Endowment to the Mayor, which now hangs over the western gallery of the hall of Christ's Hospital. It was engraved by Vertue in <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>, and represents an event which happened <num value="10">ten</num> years after the death of the supposed artist. Beneath this was a cartoon of the Good Samaritan, by Dadd, the young artist of promise who went mad and murdered his father, and who is now confined for life.in Broadmoor. The picture is now at Bedlan, There was a fine full-length of swarthy Charles II., by Lely, and full-lengths of George III. and Queen Charlotte, after Reynolds. There were also murky portraits of past presidents, including an equestrian portrait of Sir William Withers (I <num value="708">708</num>). Tables of benefactions also adoried the walls. In this hall the governors of Bridewell dined annually, each steward contributing <measure value="15l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="15">15</num></measure> towards the expenses, the dinner being dressed in a large kitchen below, only used for that purpose. The hall and kitchen were taken down in <datestruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></datestruct>.
<p>In the entrance corridor from Bridge Street (says Mr. Timbs) are the old chapel gates, of fine ironwork, originally presented by the equestrian Sir William Withers, and on the staircase is a bust of <pb id="p.195" n="195">

<p>The Bridewell prison (whose inmates were sent to Holloway) was pulled down (except the hall, treasurer's house, and offices) in <datestruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></datestruct>.
<p>Bridewell Dock (now Tudor and William Streets and Chatham Place) was long noted for its taverns, and was a favourite landing-place for the Thames watermen. (Noble.)
<p>The gas-works of Whitefriars are of great size. n <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct> Mr. Winsor, a German, <num value="1">first</num> lit a part of London (Pall Mall) with gas, and in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct> he applied for a charter. Yet, even as late as <datestruct value="1813"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, says r.

Yet Knight went on boldly committing his harmless misdemeanour, and even so far, in the next year (<datestruct value="1814"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>), as to start a company and build gas-works on the river's bank at Whitefriars. Gas spoke for itself, and its brilliancy could not be gainsaid. Times have changed. There are now <num value="13">thirteen</num> London companies, producing a rental of a million and a half, using in their manufacture <num value="882770">882,770</num> tons of coal, and employing a capital of more than <num value="5">five</num> and a half millions. Luckily for the beauty of the Embankment, these gas-works at Whitefriars, with their vast black reservoirs and all their smoke and fire, are about to be removed to Barking, <num value="7">seven</num> miles from London.
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> theatre in Whitefriars seems to have been <num value="1">one</num> built in the hall of the old Whitefriars Monastery. Mr., Collier gives the duration of this theatre as from <datestruct value="1586--"><year reg="1586">1586</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1613--"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct>.

The theatre was destroyed by the Puritan soldiers in <datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct>, and not rebuilt till the Restoration.
<p>At the outbreak of pleasure and vice, after the Restoration, the actors, long starved and crestfallen, brushed up their plumes and burnished their tinsel. Killigrew, that clever buffoon of the Court, opened a new theatre in Drury Lane in <datestruct value="1663--"><year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct>, with a play of Beaumont and Fletcher's; and
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.195.3">Davenant</lemma> (supposed to be Shakespeare's illegitimate son) opened the little theatre, long disused, in Salisbury Court, the rebuilding of which was commenced in <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, on the site of the granary of Salisbury House. In time Davenant migrated to the old Tennis Court, in Portugal Street, on the south side of Lincoln's Inn Fields, and when the Great Fire came it erased the Granary Theatre. In <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>, on Davenant's death, the company (nominally managed by his widow) returned to the new theatre in Salisbury Court, designed by Wren, and decorated, it is said, by Grinling Gibbons. It opened with Dryden's <title>Sir Martin Marall</title>, which had already had a run, having been <num value="1">first</num> played in <datestruct value="1668--"><year reg="1668">1668</year></datestruct>. On Killigrew's death, the King's and Duke's Servants united, and removed to Drury Lane in <datestruct value="1682--"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct>; so that the Dorset Gardens Theatre only flourished for <num value="11">eleven</num> years in all. It was subsequently let to wrestlers, fencers, and other brawny and wiry performers. The engraving on page <num value="193">193</num>, taken from Settle's Empress of Morocco <QUOTE>(<datestruct value="1678--"><year reg="1678">1678</year></datestruct>), represents the stage of the theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields.
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.195.4">Wren's new theatre in Dorset Gardens</lemma>, an engraving of which is given on page <num value="138">138</num>, fronted the river, and had public stairs for the convenience of those who came by water. There was also an open place before the theatre for the coaches of the quality.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1698--"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct> it was used for the drawing of a penny lottery, but in <datestruct value="1703--"><year reg="1703">1703</year></datestruct>, when it threatened to re-open, Queen Anne finally closed it. It was standing in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct> (George I.), when Strype drew up the continuation of Stow, but it was shortly after turned into a timber-yard. The New River Company next had their offices there, and in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct> water was ousted by fire, and the City Gas Works were established in this quarter, with <pb id="p.196" n="196"> a dismal front to the bright and pleasant Embankment.
<p>Pepys, the indefatigable, was a frequent visitor to the Whitefriars Theatre. A few of his quaint remarks will not be. uninteresting:--
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p><datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>.-By water to Salsbury Court Playhouse, where, not liking to sit, we went out again, and by coach to the theatre; &amp;c.-To the playhouse, and there saw <title>The Changeling</title>, the <num value="1">first</num> time it hath been acted these <num value="20">twenty</num> years, and it takes exceedingly.

But above all it was strange to see so little a boy as that was to act Cupid, which is <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest parts in it.
<p>Creed and I to Salisbury Court, and there saw

<p>Dryden, in his prologues, makes frequent mention of the Dorset Gardens Theatre, more especially in the address on the opening of the new Drury Lane, <datestruct VALUE="1674-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1674">1674</year></datestruct>. The Whitefriars house, under Davenant, had been the <num value="1">first</num> to introduce regular scenery, and it prided itself on stage pomp and show. The year before, in Shadwell's opera of
<title>The Tempest, or the Enchanted sland</title>, the machinery was very costly, and <num value="1">one</num> scene, in which the spirits flew away with the wicked duke's table and viands just as the company was sitting down, had excited the town to enthusiasm. <title>Psyche</title>, another opera by Shadwell, perhaps adapted from Moliere's Court spectacle, had succeeded the <title>Tempest</title>. St. Andre and his French dancers were probably engaged in Shadwell's piece. The king, whose taste and good sense the poet praises, had recommended simplicity of dress and frugality of ornament. This Dryden took care to well remember. He says:--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>You who each day can theatres behold,
<L>Like Nero's palace, shining all in gold,
<L>Our mean, ungilded stage will scorn, we fear,
<L>And for the homely room disdain the cheer.</QUOTE>

<P>Then he brings in the dictum of the king:--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Yet if some pride with want may be allowed,
<L>We in our plainness may be justly proud:
<L>Our royal master willed it should be so;
<L>Whate'er he's pleased to own can need no show.
<L>That sacred name gives ornament and grace,
<L>And, like his stamp, makes basest metal pass.
<L>&lsquo;Twere folly now a stately pile to raise,
<L>To build a playhouse, while you throw down plays.
<L>While scenes, machines, and empty operas reign,
<L>And for the pencil you the pen disdain:
<L>While troops of famished Frenchmen hither drive,
<L>And laugh at those upon whose alms they live,
<L>Old English authors vanish, and give place
<L>To these new conquerors of the Norman race.</QUOTE>

<p>And when, in <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>, the burnt-out Drury Lane company had removed to the Portugal Street Theatre, Dryden had said, in the same strain,--
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.196.1"> <QUOTE>So we expect the lovers, braves, and wits; The gaudy house with scenes will serve for cits.</QUOTE> </LEMMA>

<p>In another epilogue Dryden alludes sarcastically to the death of Mr. Scroop, a young rake of fortune, who had just been run through by Sir Thomas Armstrong, a sworn friend of the Duke of Monmouth, in a quarrel at the Dorset Gardens Theatre, and died soon after. This fatal affray took place during the representation of Davenant's adaptation of <title>Macbeth.</title>

<p>From Dryden's various prologues and epilogues we cull many sharply-outlined and brightcoloured pictures of the wild and riotous audiences of those evil days. We see again the <QUOTE>hot Burgundians</QUOTE> in the upper boxes wooing the masked beauties, crying <QUOTE lang=fr>bon</QUOTE> to the French dancers and beating cadence to the music that had stirred even the stately Court of Versailles. Again we see the scornful critics, bunched with glistening ribbons, shaking back their cascades of blonde hair, lolling contemptuously on the foremost benches, and <QUOTE>looking big through their curls.</QUOTE> There from <QUOTE>Fop's Corner</QUOTE> rises the tipsy laugh, the prattle, and the chatter, as the dukes and lords, the wits and courtiers, practise what Dryden calls <QUOTE>the diving bow,</QUOTE> or <QUOTE>the toss and the new French wallow</QUOTE> --the diving bow being especially admired, because it-
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>With a shog casts all the hair before,
<L>Till he, with full decorum, brings it back,
<L>And rises with a water-spaniel's shake.</QUOTE>

<p>Nor does the poet fail to recall the affrays in the upper boxes, when some quarrelsome rake was often pinned to the wainscoat by the sword of his insulted rival. Below, at the door, the Flemish horses and <pb id="p.197" n="197"> the heavy gilded coach, lighted by flambeaux, are waiting for the noisy gallant, and will take back only his corpse.
<p>Of Dryden's coldly licentious comedies and ranting bombastic tragedies a few only seem to have been produced at the Dorset Gardens Theatre. Among these we may mention <title>Limberham</title>, <title>Oedipus</title>,
<title>Troilus and Cressida</title>, and <title>The Spanish Friar</title>.
<title>Limberham</title> was acted at the Duke's Theatre, in Dorset Gardens; because, being a satire upon a Court vice, it was deemed peculiarly calculated for that playhouse. The concourse of the citizens thither is alluded to in the prologue to <title lang=fr>Marriage &agrave; la Mode</title>. Ravenscroft, also, in his epilogue to the play of <title>Citizen Turned Gentleman</title>, which was acted at the same theatre, takes occasion to disown the patronage of the more dissolute courtiers, in all probability because they formed the minor part of his audience. The citizens were his great patrons.
<p>In the <title>Postman</title>, <datestruct VALUE="1679-12-8"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=8>8</day>, <year reg=1679>1679</year></datestruct>, there is the following notice, quoted by Smith:-- <QUOTE>At the request of several persons of quality, on Saturday next, being the <num value="9">9th</num> instant, at the theatre in Dorset Gardens, the famous Kentish men, Wm. and Rich.

<p>In <datestruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></datestruct> Dr. Davenant seems, by rather unfair tactics, to have bought off and pensioned both art and Kynaston from the King's Company, and so to have greatly weakened his rivals. Of these <num value="2">two</num> actors some short notice may not be uninteresting. Hart had been a Cavalier captain during the Civil Wars, and was a pupil of Robinson, the actor, who was shot down at the taking of Basing House. Hart was a tragedian who excelled in parts that required a certain heroic and chivalrous dignity. As a youth, before the Restoration, when boys played female parts, Hart was successful as the Duchess, in Shirley's <title>Cardinal</title>. In Charles's time he played Othello, by the king's command, and rivalled Betterton's Hamlet at the other house. He created the part of Alexander, was excellent as Brutus, and terribly and vigorously wicked as en Jonson's Cataline. Rymer, says Dr. Doran, styled Hart and Mohun the Aesopus and Roscius of their time. As Amintor and Melanthus, in <title>The Maid's Tragedy</title>, they were incomparable. Pepys is loud too in his praises of Hart. His salary, was, however, at the most, <measure value="3l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3">3</num></measure> a week, though he realised <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> yearly after he became a shareholder of the theatre. Hart died in <datestruct value="1683--"><year reg="1683">1683</year></datestruct>, within a year of his being bought off.
<p>Kynaston, in his way, was also a celebrity. As a handsome boy he had been renowned for playing heroines, and he afterwards acquired celebrity by his dignified impersonation of kings and tyrants. Betterton, the greatest of all the Charles II actors, also played occasionally at Dorset Gardens. Pope knew him; Dryden was his friend; Kneller painted him.

<p>Even when Whitefriars was at its grandest, and plumes moved about its narrow river-side streets, Dorset House was its central and most stately mansion. It was originally a mansion with gardens, belonging to a Bishop of Winchester; but about the year <datestruct value="1217"><year reg="1217">1217</year></datestruct> (Henry III.) a lease was granted by William, Abbot of Westminster, to Richard, Bishop of Sarum, at the yearly rent of <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure>, the Abbot retaining the advowson of St. Bride's Church, and promising to impart to the said bishop any needful ecclesiastical advice. It afterwards fell into the hands of the Sackvilles, held at <num value="1">first</num> by a long lease from the see, but was eventually alienated by the good Bishop Jewel. A grant in <datestruct value="1611--"><year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct> (James I.) confirmed the manor of Salisbury Court to Richard, Earl of Dorset.
<p>The Earl of Dorset, to whom Bishop Jewel alienated the Whitefriars House, was the father of the poet,

<P>On the river-side, between St. Paul's and Whitefriars, there stood, in the Middle Ages, <num value="3">three</num> Norman fortresses.
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.200.1">Castle Baynard</lemma> and the old tower of Mountfiquet were <num value="2">two</num> of them. Baynard Castle, granted to the Earls of Clare and afterwards rebuilt by Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, was the palace in which the Duke of Buckingham offered the crown to his wily confederate, Richard the Crookback. In Queen Elizabeth's time it was granted to the Earls of Pembroke, who lived there in splendour till the Great Fire melted their gold, calcined their jewels, and drove them into the fashionable flood that was already moving westward. Mountfiquet Castle was pulled down in <datestruct value="1276--"><year reg="1276">1276</year></datestruct>, when Hubert de Berg, Earl of Kent, transplanted a colony of
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.200.9">Black Dominican friars</LEMMA> from Holborn, near Lincoln's Inn, to the river-side, south of Ludgate Hill. Yet so conservative is even Time in England, that a recent correspondent of <title>Notes and Queries points</title> out a piece of mediaeval walling and the
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.200.2">fragment of a buttress, still standing, at the foot of the <title>Times</title> Office</lemma>, in Printing House Square, which seem to have formed part of the stronghold of the Mountfiquets. This interesting relic is on the left hand of Queen Victoria Street, going up from the bridge, just where there was formerly a picturesque but dangerous descent by a flight of break-neck stone steps. At the right-hand side of the same street stands an old rubble chalk. wall, even older. It is just past the new house of the Bible Society, and seems to have formed part of the old City wall, which at <num value="1">first</num> ended at Baynard Castle. The rampart advanced to Mountfiquet, and, lastly, to please and protect the Dominicans, was pushed forward outside Ludgate to the Fleet, which served as a moat, the Old Bailey being an advanced work.
<p>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.200.3">King Edward I.</lemma> and Queen Eleanor heaped many gifts on these sable friars. Charles V. of France was lodged at their
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.200.4">monastery</lemma> when he visited England, but his nobles resided in Henry's newly built palace of Bridewell, a gallery being thrown over the Fleet and driven through the City wall, to serve as a communication between the <num value="2">two</num> mansions. Henry held the <QUOTE>Black Parliament</QUOTE> in this monastery, and here Cardinal Campeggio presided at the trial which ended with the tyrant's divorce from the ill-used
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.200.5">Katherine of Arragon</lemma>. In the same house the Parliament also sat that condemned
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.200.6">Wolsey, and sent him to beg <QUOTE>a little earth for charity</QUOTE> of the monks of Leicester</lemma>. The rapacious king laid his rough hand on the treasures of the house in <datestruct value="1538--"><year reg="1538">1538</year></datestruct>, and Edward VI. sold the hall and prior's lodgings to Sir Francis Bryan, a courtier, afterwards granting Sir Francis Cawarden, Master of the Revels, the whole house and precincts of the Preacher Friars, the yearly value being then valued at <measure value="19l." type=currency><num value="19">nineteen</num> pounds</measure>. The holy brothers were dispersed to beg or thieve, and the church was pulled down, but the mischievous right of sanctuary continued.
<p>And now we come to the event which connects the old monastic ground with the name of the great genius of England.
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.201.4">James Burbage</LEMMA> (afterwards Shakespeare's friend and fellow actor), and other servants of the Earl of Leicester, tormented out of the City by the angry edicts of over-scrupulous Lord Mayors, took shelter in the Precinct, and there, in <datestruct value="1578--"><year reg="1578">1578</year></datestruct>, erected a playhouse (Playhouse Yard). Every attempt was in vain made to crush the intruders. bout the year <datestruct value="1586"><year reg="1586">1586</year></datestruct>, according to the best authorities, the young Shakespeare came to London and joined the company at the Blackfriars Theatre. Only <num value="3">three</num> years later find the new arrival and this is <num value="1">one</num> of the unsolvable mysteries of Shakespeare's life-<num value="1">one</num> of <num value="16">sixteen</num> sharers in the prosperous though persecuted theatre. It is true that Mr. Halliwell has lately discovered that he was not exactly a proprietor, but only an actor, receiving a share of the profits of the house, exclusive of the galleries (the boxes and dress circle of those days), but this is, after all, only a lessening of the difficulty; and it is almost as remarkable that a young, unknown Warwickshire poet should receive such profits as it is that he should have held a <num value="16">sixteenth</num> of the whole property. Without the generous patronage of such patrons as the Earl of Southampton or Lord Brooke, how could the young actor have thriven? He was only <num value="26">twenty-six</num>, and may have written <pb id="p.201" n="201">
<title>Venus and Adonis </title> or <title>Lucrece ;</title> yet the <num value="1">first</num> of these poems was not published till <datestruct value="1593"><year reg="1593">1593</year></datestruct>. He may already, it is true, have adapted <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> tolerably successful historical plays, and, as Mr. Collier thinks, might have written <title>The Comedy of Errors, Love's Labour's Lost</title>, or <title>The <num value="2">Two</num> Gentlemen of Verona</title>. <num value="1">One</num> thing is certain, that in <datestruct value="1587--"><year reg="1587">1587</year></datestruct> <num value="5">five</num> companies of players, including the Blackfriars Company, performed at Stratford, and in his native town Mr. Collier thinks Shakespeare <num value="1">first</num> proved himself useful to his new comrades.
<p>In <datestruct value="1589--"><year reg="1589">1589</year></datestruct> the Lord Mayor closed <num value="2">two</num> theatres for ridiculing the Puritans. Burbage and his friends, alarmed at this, petitioned the Privy Council, and pleaded that they had never introduced into their plays matters of state or religion. The Blackfriars company, in <datestruct value="1593--"><year reg="1593">1593</year></datestruct>, began to build a summer theatre, the Globe, in Southwark; and Mr. Collier, remembering, that this was the very year <title>Venus and Adonis </title>was published, attributes some great gift of the Earl of Southampton to Shakespeare to have immediately followed this poem, which was dedicated to him. By <datestruct value="1594--"><year reg="1594">1594</year></datestruct> the poet had written <title>King Richard II. and King Richard III.,</title>
and Burbage's son Richard had made himself famous as the <num value="1">first</num> representative of the crook-backed king. In <datestruct value="1596--"><year reg="1596">1596</year></datestruct> we find Shakespeare and his partners (only <num value="8">eight</num> now) petitioning the Privy Council to allow them to repair and enlarge their theatre, which the Puritans of Blackfriars wanted to close. The Council allowed the repairs, but forbade the enlargement. At this time
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.201.1">Shakespeare</lemma> was living near the
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.201.2">Bear Garden, Southwark</lemma> to be close to
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.201.3">the Globe</lemma>. He was now evidently a thriving, <QUOTE>warm</QUOTE> man, for in <datestruct value="1597--"><year reg="1597">1597</year></datestruct> he purchased for <measure value="60l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="60">60</num></measure> New Place, <num value="1">one</num> of the best houses in Stratford. In <datestruct value="1613--"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct> we find Shakespeare purchasing a plot of ground not far from Blackfriars Theatre, and abutting on a street leading down to Puddle Wharf, <QUOTE>right against the king's majesty's wardrobe ;</QUOTE> but he had retired to Stratford, and given up London and the stage before this. The deed of this sale was sold in <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct> for <measure value="162l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="162">162</num></measure> <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>s.</measure>
<p>In <datestruct value="1608--"><year reg="1608">1608</year></datestruct> the Lord Mayor and aldermen of London made a final attempt to crush the Blackfriars players, but failing to prove to the Lord Chancellor that the City had ever exercised any authority within the precinct and liberty of Blackfriars, their cause fell to the ground. The Corporation then opened a negotiation for purchase with Burbage, Shakespeare, and the other (now <num value="9">nine</num>) shareholders. he players asked about <measure value="7000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="7000">7,000</num></measure>, Shakespeare's <num value="4">four</num> shares being valued at <measure value="1433l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1433">1,433</num></measure> <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure>, including the wardrobe and properties, estimated at <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure>. he poet's income at this time Mr. Collier estimates at <measure value="400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="400">400</num></measure> a year. The Blackfriars Theatre was pulled down in Cromwell's time (<datestruct value="1655--"><year reg="1655">1655</year></datestruct>), and houses built in its room.
<p>Randolph, the dramatist, a pupil of Ben Jonson's, ridicules, in <title>The Muses' Looking-Glass</title>, that strange <QUOTE>morality</QUOTE> play of his, the Puritan feather-sellers; of Blackfriars, whom Ben Jonson also taunts; Randolph's pretty Puritan, Mrs. Flowerdew, says of the ungodly of Blackfriars :
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Indeed, it sometimes pricks my conscience,
<L>I come to sell &lsquo;em pins and looking-glasses.</QUOTE>
 To which her friend, Mr. Bird, replies, with the sly sanctity of Tartuffe :
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>I have this custom, too, for my feathers;
<L>&lsquo;Tis fit that we, which are sincere professors,
<L>Should gain by infidels.</QUOTE>
Ben Jonson, that smiter of all such hypocrites, wrote <title>Volpone</title> at his house in Blackfriars, where he laid the scene of <title>The Alchymist</title>. The Friars were fashionable, however, in spite of the players, for Vandyke lived in the precinct for <num value="9">nine</num> years (he died in <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>); and the wicked Earl and Countess of Somerset resided in the same locality when they poisoned their former favourite, Sir Thomas Overbury. As late as <datestruct value="1735"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>, Mr. Peter Cunningham says, there was an attempt to assert precinct privileges, but years before sheriffs had arrested, in the Friars.
<p>In <datestruct value="1623--"><year reg="1623">1623</year></datestruct> Blackfriars was the scene of a most fatal and extraordinary accident. It occurred in the chief house of the Friary, then a district declining fast in respectability. Hunsdon House derived its name from Queen Elizabeth's favourite cousin, the Lord Chamberlain, Henry Carey, Baron Hunsdon, and was at the time occupied by Count de Tillier, the French ambassador. About <num value="3">three</num> o'clock on Sunday, <datestruct value="10-26"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=26>26th</day></datestruct>, a large Roman Catholic congregation of about <num value="300">three hundred</num> persons, worshipping to a certain degree in stealth, not without fear from the Puritan feathermakers of the theatrical neighbourhood, had assembled in a long garret on the <num value="3">third</num> and uppermost storey. Master Drury, a Jesuit prelate of celebrity, had drawn together this crowd of timid people. The garret, looking over the gateway, was approached by a passage having a door opening into the street, and also by a corridor from the ambassador's withdrawing-room. The garret was about <num value="17">seventeen</num> feet wide and <num value="40">forty</num> feet long, with a vestry for a priest partitioned off at <num value="1">one</num> end. In the middle of the garret, and near the wall, stood a raised table and chair for the preacher. The gentry sat on chairs and stools facing the pulpit, the rest stood behind, crowding as far as the head of the stairs. At the appointed hour Master Drury, <pb id="p.202" n="202"> the priest, came from the inner room in white robe and scarlet stole, an attendant carrying a book and an hour-glass, by which to measure his sermon. He knelt down at the chair for about an Ave Maria, but uttered no audible prayer. He then took the Jesuits' Testament, and read for the text the Gospel for the day, which was, according to the Gregorian Calendar, the <num value="21">twenty-first</num> Sunday after Pentecost-- <QUOTE>Therefore is the kingdom of heaven like unto a man being a king that would make an account of his servants. And when he began to make account there was <num value="1">one</num> presented unto him that owed him <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> talents.</QUOTE> Having read the text, the Jesuit preacher sat down, and putting on his head a red quilt cap, with a white linen <num value="1">one</num> beneath it, commenced his sermon. He had spoken for about half an hour when the calamity happened.
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.202.1">The great weight of the crowd in the old room suddenly snapped the main summer beam of the floor, which instantly crashed</LEMMA>
in and fell into the room below. The main beams there also snapped and broke through to the ambassador's drawing-room over the gate-house, a distance of <num value="22">twenty-two</num> feet. Only a part, however, of the gallery floor, immediately over Father Rudgate's chamber, a small room used for secret mass, gave way. The rest of the floor, being less crowded, stood firm, and the people on it, having no other means of escape, drew their knives and cut a way through a plaster wall into a neighbouring room.
<p>A contemporary pamphleteer, who visited the ruins and wrote fresh from the <num value="1">first</num> outburst of sympathy, says: <QUOTE>What ear without tingling can bear the doleful and confused cries of such a troop of men, women, and children, all falling suddenly in the same pit, and apprehending with <num value="1">one</num> horror the same ruin? What eye can behold without inundation of tears such a spectacle of men overwhelmed with breaches of mighty timber, buried in rubbish and smothered with dust? What heart without evaporating in sighs can ponder the burden of deepest sorrows and lamentations of parents, children, husbands, wives, kinsmen, friends, for their dearest pledges and chiefest comforts? This world all bereft and swept away with <num value="1">one</num> blast of the same dismal tempest.</QUOTE>
<p>The news of the accident fast echoing through London, Serjeant Finch, the Recorder, and the Lord Mayor and aldermen at once provided for the safety of the ambassador's family, who were naturally shaking in their shoes, and shutting up the gates to keep off the curious and thievish crowd, set guards at all the Blackfriars passages. Workmen were employed to remove the <hi rend=italics>debris</hi> and rescue the sufferers who were still alive. The pamphleteer, again rousing himself to the occasion, and turning on his tears, says :-- <QUOTE>At the opening hereof what a chaos! what fearful objects! what lamentable representations! Here some buried, some dismembered, some only parts of men; here some wounded and weltering in their own and others' blood; others putting forth their fainting hands and crying out for help. Here some gasping and panting for breath; others stifled for want of air. So the most of them being thus covered with dust, their death was a kind of burial.</QUOTE> All that night and part of the next day the workmen spent in removing the bodies, and the inquest was then held. It was found that the main beams were only <num value="10">ten</num> inches square, and had <num value="2">two</num> mortise-holes, where the girders were inserted, facing each other, so that only <num value="3">three</num> inches of solid timber were left. The main beam of the lower room, about <num value="13">thirteen</num> inches square, without mortise-holes, broke obliquely near the end. No wall gave way, and the roof and ceiling of the garret remained entire. Father Drury perished, as did also Father Rudgate, who was in his own apartment, underneath. Lady Webb, of Southwark, Lady Blackstone's daughter, from Scroope's Court, Mr. Fowell, a Warwickshire gentleman, and many tradesmen, servants, and artisans-<num value="95">ninety-five</num> in all-perished. Some of the escapes seemed almost miraculous. Mistress Lucie Penruddock fell between Lady Webb and a servant, who were both killed, yet was saved by her chair falling over her head. Lady Webb's daughter was found alive near her dead mother, and a girl named Elizabeth Sanders was also saved by the dead who fell and covered her. A Protestant scholar, though <num value="1">one</num> of the very undermost, escaped by the timbers arching over him and some of them slanting against the wall. He tore a way out through the laths of the ceiling by main strength, then crept between <num value="2">two</num> joists to a hole where he saw light, and was drawn through a door by <num value="1">one</num> of the ambassador's family. He at once returned to rescue others. There was a girl of <num value="10">ten</num> who cried to him, <QUOTE>Oh, my mother!-oh, my sister!- they are down under the timber.</QUOTE> He told her to be patient, and by God's grace they would be quickly got forth. The child replied, <QUOTE>This will be a great scandal to our religion.</QUOTE> <num value="1">One</num> of the men that fell said to a fellow-sufferer, <QUOTE>Oh, what advantage our adversaries will take at this!</QUOTE> The other replied, <QUOTE>If it be God's will this should befall us, what can we say to it?</QUOTE> <num value="1">One</num> gentleman was saved by keeping near the stairs, while his friend, who had pushed near the pulpit, perished.
<p>Many of those who were saved died in a few hours after their extrication. The bodies of Lady <pb id="p.203" n="203"> Webb, Mistress Udall, and Lady Blackstone's daughter, were carried to Ely House, Holborn, and there buried in the back courtyard. In the fore courtyard, by the French ambassador's house, a huge grave, eighteen feet long and <num value="12">twelve</num> feet broad, was dug, and <num value="44">forty-four</num> corpses piled within it. In another pit, <num value="12">twelve</num> feet long and <num value="8">eight</num> feet broad, in the ambassador's garden, they buried <num value="15">fifteen</num> more. Others were interred in St. Andrew's, St. Bride's, and Blackfriars churches. The list of the killed and wounded is curious, from its topographical allusions. Amongst other entries, we find <QUOTE>John Halifax, a water-bearer</QUOTE> (in the old times of street conduits the water-bearer was an important person); <QUOTE>a son of Mr. Flood, the scrivener, in Holborn; a man of Sir Ives Pemberton; Thomas Brisket, his wife, son, and maid, in Montague Close; Richard Fitzgarret, of Gray's Inn, gentleman; Davie, an Irishman, in Angell Alley, Gray's Inn, gentleman; Sarah Watson, daughter of Master Watson, chirurgeon; Master Grimes, near the  <Q>Horse Shoe</Q>  tavern, in Drury Lane; John Bevan, at the <Q><num value="7">Seven</num> Stars</Q>, in Drury Lane; Francis Man, Thieving Lane, Westminster,</QUOTE> &amp;c. As might have been expected, the fanatics of both parties had much to say about this terrible accident. The Catholics declared that the Protestants, knowing this to be a chief place of meeting for men of their faith, had secretly drawn out the pins, or sawn the supporting timbers partly asunder. The Protestants, on the other hand, lustily declared that the planks would not bear such a weight of Romish sin, and that God was displeased with their pulpits and altars, their doctrine and sacrifice. <num value="1">One</num> zealot remembered that, at the return of Prince Charles from the madcap expedition to Spain, a Catholic had lamented, or was said to have lamented, the street bonfires, as there would be pever a fagot left to burn the heretics. <QUOTE>If it had been a Protestant chapel,</QUOTE> the Puritans cried, <QUOTE>the Jesuits would have called the calamity an omen of the speedy downfall of heresy.</QUOTE> A Catholic writer replied <QUOTE>with a word of comfort,</QUOTE> and pronounced the accident to be a presage of good fortune to Catholics and of the overthrow of error and heresy. This zealous, but not well-informed, writer compared Father Drury's death with that of Zuinglius, who fell in battle, and with that of Calvin, <QUOTE>who, being in despair, and calling upon the devil, gave up his wicked soul, swearing, cursing, and blaspheming.</QUOTE> So intolerance, we see, is neither specially Protestant nor Catholic, but of every party. <QUOTE>The Fatal Vespers,</QUOTE> as that terrible day at Blackfriars was afterwards called, were long remembered with a shudder by Catholic England.
<p>In a curious old pamphlet entitled <QUOTE>Something Written by Occasion of that Fatall and Memorable Accident in the Blacke-friers, on Sonday, being the <datestruct VALUE="1623-10-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1623">1623</year></datestruct>, <foreign lang=la>stilo antiquo</foreign>, and the <datestruct value="11-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, <foreign lang=la>stilo novo</foreign>, or <foreign lang=la>Romano</foreign>,</QUOTE> the author relates a singular escape of <num value="1">one</num> of the listeners. <QUOTE>When all things were ready,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE><p>and the prayer finished, the Jesuite tooke for his text the gospell of the day, being (as I take it) the <num value="22">22nd</num> Sunday after Trinity, and extracted out of the <num value="18">18th</num> of Matthew, beginning at the <num value="21">21st</num> verse, to the end. The story concerns forgiveness of sinnes, and describeth the wicked cruelty of the unjust steward, whom his maister remitted, though he owed him <num value="10000">10,000</num> talents, but he would not forgive his fellow a <measure value="100d." type=currency><num value="100">100</num> pence</measure>, whereupon he was called to a new reckoning, and cast into prison, and then the particular words are, which he insisted upon, the <num value="34">34th</num> verse:  <Q>So his master was wroth, and delivered him to the jaylor, till he should pay all that was due to him.</Q>  For the generall, he urged many good doctrines and cases; for the particular, he modelled out that fantasie of purgatory, which he followed with a full crie of pennance, satisfaction, paying of money, and such like.
<p>While this exercise was in hand, a gentleman brought up his friend to see the place, and bee partaker of the sermon, who all the time he was going up stairs cried out, <Q> Whither doe I goe? I protest my heart trembles;</Q>  and when he came into the roome, the priest being very loud, he whispered his friend in the eare that he was afraid, for, as he supposed, the room did shake under him; at which his friend, between smiling and anger, left him, and went close to the wall behind the preacher's chaire. The gentleman durst not stirre from the staires, and came not full <num value="2">two</num> yards in the roome, when on a sudden there was a kinde of murmuring amongst the people, and some were heard to say,  <Q>The roome shakes;</Q>  which words being taken up <num value="1">one</num> of another, the whole company rose up with a strong suddainnesse, and some of the women screeched. I cannot compare it better than to many passengers in a boat in a tempest, who are commanded to sit still and let the waterman alone with managing the oares, but some unruly people rising overthrowes them all. So was this company served; for the people thus affrighted started up with extraordinary quicknesse, and at an instant the maine summer beame broke in sunder, being mortised in the wall some <num value="5">five</num> foot from the same; and so the whole roofe or floore fell at once, with all the people that stood thronging on it, and with the violent impetuosity drove downe the nether roome quite to the ground, so that they fell <pb id="p.204" n="204"> <num value="24">twenty-four</num> foot high, and were most of them buried and bruised betweene the rubbish and the timber; and though some were questionlesse smothered, yet for the most part they were hurt and bled, and being taken forth the next day, and laid all along in the gallery, presented to the lookers--on a wofull spectacle of fourscore and <num value="17">seventeen</num> dead persons, besides <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="9">nine</num> which perished since, unable to recover themselves.
<p>They that kept themselves close to the walls, or remained by the windows, or held by the rafters, or settled themselves by the stayres, or were driven away by fear and suspition, sauved themselves without further hurt; but such as seemed more devoute, and thronged neere the preacher, perished in a moment with himselfe and other priests and Jesuites; and this was the summe of that unhappy disaster.</QUOTE>

<p>In earlier days Blackfriars had been a locality much inhabited by fashionable people, especially about the time of Queen Elizabeth. Pennant quotes from the <title>Sydney Papers</title> a curious account

<p> <QUOTE>Lord Herbert, son of William, <num value="4">fourth</num> Earl of Worcester,</QUOTE> says Pennant, <QUOTE>had a house in Blackfriars, which Queen Elizabeth, in <datestruct value="1600--"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct>, honoured with her presence, on occasion of his nuptials with the daughter and heiress of John, Lord Russell, son of Francis, Earl of Bedford.

It was built from the design of Robert Mylne, a clever young Scotch engineer, whose family had been master masons to the kings of Scotland for <num value="500">five hundred</num> years. Mylne had just returned from a professional tour in Italy, where he had followed in the footsteps of Vitruvius, and gained the <num value="1">first</num> prize at the Academy of St. Luke. He arrived in London friendless and unknown, and at once entered into competition with <num value="20">twenty</num> other architects for the new bridge. Among these rivals was Smeaton, the great engineer (<hi rend=italics>a protege</hi> of Lord Bute's), and Dr. Johnson's friend, Gwynn, well known for his admirable work on London <pb id="p.206" n="206"> improvements. The committee were, however, just enough to be unanimous in favouring the young unknown Scotchman, and he carried off the prize. Directly it was known that Mylne's arches were to be elliptical, every <num value="1">one</num> unacquainted with the subject began to write in favour of the semi-circular arch. Among the champions Dr. Johnson was, if not the most ignorant, the most rash. He wrote <num value="3">three</num> letters to the printer of the <title>Gazetteer</title>, praising Gwynn's plans and denouncing the Scotch conqueror. Gwynn had <QUOTE>coached</QUOTE> the learned Doctor in a very unsatisfactory way. In his early days the giant of Bolt Court had been accustomed to get up subjects rapidly, but the science of architecture was not so easily digested. The Doctor contended <QUOTE>that the <num value="1">first</num> excellence of a bridge built for commerce over a large river is strength.</QUOTE> So far so good; but he then went on to try and show that the pointed arch is necessarily weak, and here he himself broke down. He allowed that there was an elliptical bridge at Florence, but he said carts were not allowed to go over it, which proved its fragility. He also condemned a proposed castiron parapet, in imitation of <num value="1">one</num> at Rome, as too poor and trifling for a great design. He allowed that a certain arch of Perault's was elliptical, but then he contended that it had to be held together by iron clamps. He allowed that Mr. Mylne had gained the prize at Rome, but the competitors, the arrogant despot of London clubs asserted, were only boys; and, moreover, architecture had sunk so low at Rome, that even the Pantheon had been deformed by petty decorations. In his <num value="3">third</num> letter the D.)ctor grew more scientific, and even more confused. He was. very angry with Mr. Mylne's friends for asserting that though a semi-ellipse might be weaker than a semicircle, it had quite strength enough to support a bridge. <QUOTE>I again venture to declare,</QUOTE> he wrote- <QUOTE>I again venture to declare, in defiance of all this contemptuous superiority</QUOTE> (how arrogant men hate other people's arrogance!), <QUOTE>that a straight line will bear no weight. Not even the science of Vasari will make that form strong which the laws of nature have condemned to weakness. By the position that a straight line will bear nothing is meant that it receives no strength from straightness; for that many bodies laid in straight lines will support weight by the cohesion of their parts, every <num value="1">one</num> has found who has seen dishes on a shelf, or a thief upon the gallows. It is not denied that stones may be so crushed together by enormous pressure on each side, that a heavy mass may be safely laid upon them; but the strength must be derived merely from the lateral resistance, and the line so loaded will be itself part of the load. The semi. elliptical arch has <num value="1">one</num> recommendation yet unexamined. We are told that it is difficult of execution.</QUOTE>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.206.1">Building of New Blackfriar's Bridge</lemma></NOTE>

<p>In the face of this noisy newspaper thunder, Mylne went on, and produced <num value="1">one</num> of the most beautiful bridges in England for <measure value="152640l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="152640">152,640</num></measure> <measure value="3s. 10d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="10">10</num>d.</measure>, actually <measure value="163l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="163">163</num></measure> less than the original estimate-an admirable example for all architects, present and to come. The bridge, which had <num value="8">eight</num> arches, and was <num value="995">995</num> yards from wharf to wharf, was erected in <num value="10">ten</num> years and <num value="3">three</num> quarters. Mylne received <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="500">500</num></measure> a year and <num value="10">ten</num> per cent. on the expenditure. His claims, however, were disputed, and not allowed by the grateful City till <datestruct value="1776"><year reg="1776">1776</year></datestruct>. The bridge-tolls were bought by Government in <datestruct value="1785--"><year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct>, and the passage then became free. It was afterwards lowered, and the open parapet, condemned by Johnson, removed. It was supposed that Mylne's mode of centreing was a secret, but in contempt of all quackery he deposited exact models of his system in the British Museum. He was afterwards made surveyor of St. Paul's Cathedral, and in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct> was interred near the tomb of Wren. He was a despot amongst his workmen, and ruled them with a rod of iron. However, the foundations of this bridge were never safely built, and latterly the piers began visibly to subside. The semi-circular arches would have been far stronger.
<p>The foundation-stone of Blackfriars Bridge was. laid by Sir Thomas Chitty, Lord Mayor, on the <datestruct VALUE="1760-10-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>.
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.206.2">Horace Walpole</lemma>, always Whiggish, describing the event, says :-- <QUOTE>The Lord Mayor laid the <num value="1">first</num> stone of the new bridge yesterday.

(just dead) were placed under the stone, with a. silver medal presented to Mr. Mylne by the Academy of St. Luke's, and upon <num value="2">two</num> plates of tin --Bonnel Thornton said they should have been lead--was engraved a very shaky Latin inscription, thus rendered into English.:--

<P>On this pretentious and unlucky inscription, that reckless wit, Bonnel Thornton, instantly wrote a squib, under the obvious pseudonym of the <QUOTE>Rev.

The ordinary of Newgate, my lord's chaplain, or the masters of Merchant Taylors', Paul's, or Charterhouse schools, who produced the wonderful pontine inscription, must have winced under the blows of this jester's bladderful of peas. Thornton laughed most at the awkward phrase implying that Mr. Pitt had caught the happy contagion of his own probity and spirit.

<P>Party feeling, as usual at those times, was rife. Mylne was a friend of Paterson, the City solicitor, an apt scribbler and a friend of Lord Bute, who nc doubt favoured his young countryman. For, being a Scotchman, Johnson no doubt took pleasure in opposing him, and for the same reason Churchill, in his bitter poem on the Cock Lane ghost, after ridiculing Johnson's credulity, goes out of his way to sneer at Mylne :--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>What of that bridge which, void of sense,

<p>In <datestruct value="1766--"><year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct> it was opened for foot passengers, the completed portion being connected with the shore by a temporary wooden structure; <num value="2">two</num> years later it was made passable for horses, and in <datestruct value="1769--"><year reg="1769">1769</year></datestruct> it was fully opened. An unpopular toll of <num value="1">one</num> halfpenny on week-days for every person, and of <num value="1">one</num> penny on Sundays, was exacted. The result of this was that while the Gordon Riots were raging, in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, the too zealous Protestants, forgetting for a time the poor tormented Papists, attacked and burned down the toll-gates, stole the money, and destroyed all the account-books. Several rascals' lives were lost, and <num value="1">one</num> rioter, being struck with a bullet, ran howling for <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40">forty</num> yards, and then dropped down dead. Nevertheless, the iniquitous toll continued until <datestruct value="1785--"><year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct>, when it was redeemed by Government.
<p>The bridge, according to the order of Common Council, was <num value="1">first</num> named Pitt Bridge, and the adjacent streets (in honour of the great earl) Chatham Place, William Street, and Earl Street. But the <num value="1">first</num> name of the bridge soon dropped off, and the monastic locality asserted its prior right. This is the more remarkable (as Mr. Timbs judiciously observes), because with another Thames bridge the reverse change took place. Waterloo Bridge was <num value="1">first</num> called Strand Bridge, but it was soon dedicated by the people to the memory of the most famous of British victories.

The piers, of bad Portland stone, were decorated by some columns of unequal sizes, and the line of parapet was low and curved. The approaches to the bridge were also designed by Mylne, who built himself a house at the corner of Little Bridge Street. The walls of the rooms were adorned with classical medallions, and on the exterior was the date (<datestruct value="1780"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>), with Mylne's crest, and the initials <QUOTE>R. M.</QUOTE> Dr. Johnson became a friend of Mylne's, and dined with him at this residence at least on <num value="1">one</num> occasion. The house afterwards became the <QUOTE>York Hotel,</QUOTE> and, according to Mr. Timbs, was taken down in <datestruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></datestruct>.
<p>The Bridge repairs (between <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>), by <pb id="p.208" n="208"> Walker and Burgess, engineers, at an expense of <measure value="74000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="74000">74,000</num></measure>, produced a loss to the contractors; and the removal of the cornice and balustrade spoiled the bridge, from whence old Richard Wilson, the landscape-painter, used to come and admire the grand view of St. Paul's. The bridge seemed to be as unlucky as if it had incurred Dr. Johnson's curse. In <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct> the Chamberlain reported to the Common Council that the sum of <measure value="100960l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100960">100,960</num></measure> had been already expended in repairing Mylne's faulty work, besides the <measure value="800l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="800">800</num></measure> spent in procuring a local Act (<num value="4">4</num> William IV.). According to a subsequent report, <measure value="10200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10200">10,200</num></measure> had been spent in <num value="6">six</num> years in repairing <num value="1">one</num> arch alone. From <datestruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct> the expenditure had been at the rate of <measure value="600l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="600">600</num></measure> a year. Boswell, indeed, with all his zealous partiality for the Scotch architect, had allowed that the best Portland stone belonged to Government quarries, and from this Parliamentary interest had debarred Mylne.
<p>The tardy Common Council was at last forced, in common decency, to build a new bridge. The architect began by building a temporary structure of great strength. It consisted of <num value="2">two</num> storeysthe lower for carriages, the upper for pedestriansand stretching <num value="990">990</num> feet from wharf to wharf. The lower piles were driven <num value="10">ten</num> feet into the bed of the river, and braced with horizontal and diagonal bracings. The demolition began with vigour in <datestruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></datestruct>. In <num value="4">four</num> months only, the navigators' brawny arms had removed <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> tons of earth, stone, and rubble above the turning of the arches, and the pulling down those enemies of Dr. Johnson commenced by the removal of the key-stone of the <num value="2">second</num> arch on the Surrey side. The masonry of the arches proved to be rather thinner than it appeared to be, and was stuffed with river ballast, mixed with bones and small old-fashioned pipes. The bridge had taken nearly <num value="10">ten</num> years to build; it was entirely demolished in less than a year, and rebuilt in <num value="2">two</num>. In some cases the work of removal and re-construction went on harmoniously and simultaneously side by side. Ingenious steam cranes travelled upon rails laid on the upper scaffold beams, and lifted the blocks of stone with playful ease and speed. In <datestruct VALUE="1864-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></datestruct>, the men worked in the evenings, by the aid of naphtha lamps.
<p>According to a report printed in the <title>Times</title>, Blackfriars Bridge had suffered from the removal of London Bridge, which served as a mill-dam, to restrain the speed and scour of the river.
<p><num value="12">Twelve</num> designs had been sent in at the competition, and, singularly enough, among the competitors was a Mr. Mylne, grandson of Johnson's foe. The design of Mr. Page was <num value="1">first</num> selected, as the handsomest and cheapest. It consisted of only <num value="3">three</num> arches. Ultimately Mr. Joseph Cubitt won the prize. Cubitt's bridge has <num value="5">five</num> arches, the centre <num value="1">one</num> <num value="89">eighty-nine</num> feet span; the style, Venetian Gothic; the cost, <measure value="265000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="265000">265,000</num></measure>.

<p>Bridge Street is too new for many traditions. Its chief hero is that active-minded and somewhat shallow speculator, Sir Richard Phillips, the bookseller and projector. An interesting memoir by Mr. Timbs, his intimate friend, furnishes us with many curious facts, and shows how the publisher of Bridge Street impinged on many of the most illustrious of his contemporaries, and how in a way he pushed forward the good work which afterwards owed so much to Mr. Charles Knight. Phillips, born in London in <datestruct value="1767--"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>, was educated in Soho Square, and afterwards at Chiswick, where he remembered often seeing Hogarth's widow and Dr. Griffith, of the <title>Monthly Review</title> (Goldsmith's tyrant), attending church. He was brought up to be a brewer, but in <datestruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct> settled as a schoolmaster, <num value="1">first</num> at Chester and afterwards at Leicester. At Leicester he opened a bookseller's shop, started a newspaper (the
<title>Leicester Herald</title>), and established a philosophical society. Obnoxious as a Radical, he was at last entrapped for selling Tom Paine's <title>Rights of Man,</title> and was sent to gaol for eighteen months, where he was visited by Lord Moira, the Duke of Norfolk, and other advanced men of the day. His house being burned down, he removed to London, and projected a Sunday newspaper, but eventually Mr. Bell stole the idea and started the

<p>As a pushing publisher Phillips soon distinguished himself, for the Liberals came to him, and he had quite enough sense to discover if a book was good.

He also did his best to repress the cruelties of the mob to poor wretches in the pillory. He was a steady friend of Alderman Waithman, and was with him in the carriage at the funeral of Queen Caroline, in <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>, when a bullet from a soldier's carbine passed through the carriage window near Hyde Park.

<p>This active-minded man was the <num value="1">first</num> to assert that Dr. Wilmot wrote <title>Junius,</title> and to start thp celebrated scandal about George III. and the young Quakeress, Hannah Lightfoot, daughter of a linendraper, at the corner of Market Street, St. James's. She afterwards, it is said, married a grocer, named Axford, on Ludgate Hill, was then carried off by the prince, and bore him <num value="3">three</num> sons, who in time became generals. The story is perhaps traceable to Dr. Wilmot, whose daughter married the Duke of Cumberland. Phillips found time to attack the Newtonian theory of gravitation, to advocate a memorial to Shakespeare, to compile a book containing a million of facts, to write on Divine philosophy, and to suggest (as he asserted) to Mr. Brougham, in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, the <num value="1">first</num> idea of the Society for Useful Knowledge. Almost ruined by the failures during the panic in <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct>, he retired to Brighton, and there pushed forward his books and his interrogative system of education. Sir Richard's greatest mistakes, he used to say, had been the rejection of Byron's early poems, of <title>Waverley,</title>
of Bloomfield's <title>Farmer's Boy,</title> and O&lsquo;Meara's

Superficial as he was, and commercial as were his literary aims, we nevertheless cannot refuse him the praise awarded in his epitaph:-- <QUOTE>He advocated civil liberty, general benevolence, ascendancy of justice, and the improvement of the human race.</QUOTE>
<p>The old monastic ground of the Black Friars seems to have been beloved by painters, for, as we have seen,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.209.1">Vandyke</lemma> lived luxuriously here, and was frequently visited by Charles I. and his Court. Cornelius Jansen, the great portrait-painter of James's Court, arranged his black draperies and ground his fine carnations in the same locality; and at the same time Isaac Oliver, the exquisite Court miniature-painter, dwelt in the same place. It was to him Lady Ayres, to the rage of her jealous husband, came for a portrait of Lord Herbert of Cherbury, an imprudence that very nearly led to the assassination of the poet-lord, who believed himself so specially favoured of Heaven.

<p>This great paper was started in the year <datestruct value="1785"><year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct>, by Mr. John Walter, under the name of the <title>Daily Universal Register</title>. It was <num value="1">first</num> called the <title>Times,</title>
<datestruct VALUE="1788-01-1"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=1>1</day>, <year reg=1788>1788</year></datestruct>, when the following prospectus appeared :--
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>The <title>Universal Register</title> has been a name as injurious to the logographic newspaper as Tristram was to Mr. Shandy's son; but old Shandy forgot he might have rectified by confirmation the mistake of the parson at baptism, and with the touch of a bishop changed Tristram into Trismegistus. The <title>Universal Register</title>, from the day of its <num value="1">first</num> <pb id="p.210" n="210"> appearance to the day of its confirmation, had, like Tristram, suffered from innumerable casualties, both laughable and serious, arising from its name, which in its introduction was immediately curtailed of its fair proportions by all who called for it, the word  <Q>Universal</Q>  being universally omitted, and the word  <Q>Register</Q>  only retained.  <Q>Boy, bring me the <title>Register</title>.</Q>  The waiter answers, <Q>Sir, we have no library; but you may see it in the <QUOTE>New Exchange</QUOTE> coffee-house.</Q> <Q>Then I will see it there,</Q>
answers the disappointed politician; and he goes to the <QUOTE>New Exchange</QUOTE> coffee-house, and calls for the <title>Register</title>, upon which the waiter tells him he cannot have it, as he is not a subscriber, or presents

<p>For these and other reasons the printer of the
<title>Universal Register</title> has added to its original name that of the <title>Times</title>, which, being a monosyllable, bids defiance to the corruptions and mutilations ot the language.
<p>The <title>Times</title>! what a monstrous name! Granted --for the Times is a many-headed monster, that speaks with a <num value="100">hundred</num> tongues, and displays a <num value="1000">thousand</num> characters; and in the course of its <pb id="p.211" n="211">

<p>The critical reader will observe, we personify our new name; but as we give it no distinction of sex, and though it will be active in its vocation, yet we apply to it the neuter gender.
<p>The <title>Times</title>, being formed of and possessing qualities of opposite and heterogeneous natures, cannot be classed either in the animal or vegetable genus, but, like the polypus, is doubtful; and in the discussion, description, and illustration, will employ the pens of the most celebrated <hi rend=italics>literati.</hi>

<p>The heads of the <title>Times</title>, as has already been said, are many; these will, however, not always appear at the same time, but casually, as public or private affairs may call them forth.
<p>The principal or leading heads are--the literary, political, commercial, philosophical, critical, theatrical, fashionable, humorous, witty, &amp;c., each of which is supplied with a competent share of intellect for the pursuit of their several functions an endowment which is not in all cases to be found, even in the heads of the State, the heads of the Church, the heads of the law, the heads of the navy, the heads of the army, and, though last not least, the great heads of the universities.
<p>The political head of the <title>Times</title>--like that of Janus, the Roman deity--is double-faced. With <num value="1">one</num> countenance it will smile continually on the friends of Old England, and with the other will frown incessantly on her enemies.
<p>The alteration we have made in our paper is not without precedents. The <title>World</title> has parted with half its <foreign lang=la>caput mortuum</foreign> and a moiety of its brains; the <title>Herald</title> has cutoff <num value="1">one</num> half of its head and has lost its original humour; the <title>Post</title>, it is true, retains its whole head and its old features; and as to the other public prints, they appear as having neither heads nor tails.
<p>On the Parliamentary head, every communication that ability and industry can produce may be expected. To this great national object the <title>Times</title>
will be most sedulously attentive, most accurately correct, and strictly impartial in its reports.</QUOTE>

<p>Both the <title>Times</title> and its predecessor were printed <QUOTE>logographically,</QUOTE> Mr. Walter having obtained a patent for his peculiar system. The plan consisted in abridging the compositors' labour by casting all the more frequently recurring words in metal. It was, in fact, a system of partial stereotyping. The English language, said the sanguine inventor, contained above <num value="90000">90,000</num> words. This number Walter had reduced to about <num value="5000">5,000</num>. The projector was assailed by the wits, who declared that his orders to the type-founders ran,-- <QUOTE>Send me a hundredweight, in separate pounds, of <hi rend=italics>heat, cold, wet, dry, murder, fire, dreadful robbery, atrocious outrage, fearful calamity</hi>, and <hi rend=italics>alarming explosion.</hi></QUOTE> But nothing could daunt or stop Walter. <num value="1">One</num> eccentricity of the <title>Daily Register</title> was that on redletter days the title was printed in red ink, and the character of the day stated under the date-line. For instance, on Friday, <datestruct VALUE="1786-08-11"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=11>11</day>, <year reg=1786>1786</year></datestruct>, there is a red heading, and underneath the words-
<QUOTE REND=center>Princess of Brunswick born. Holiday at the Bank, Excise offices, and the Exchequer.</QUOTE>

<p>The <num value="1">first</num> number of the <title>Times</title> is not so large as the <title>Morning Herald</title> or <title>Morning Chronicle</title> of the same date, but larger than the <title>London Chronicle,</title>
and of the same size as the <title>Public Advertiser.</title>
 (Knight Hunt.)
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> Walter lived in rough times, and suffered from the political storms that then prevailed. He was several times imprisoned for articles against great people, and it has been asserted that he stood in the pillory in <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct> for a libel against the Duke of York. This is not, however, true; but it is a fact that he was sentenced to such a punishment, and remained <num value="16">sixteen</num> months in Newgate, till released at the intercession of the Prince of Wales. The <num value="1">first</num> Walter died in <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>. The <num value="2">second</num> Mr. Walter, who came to the helm in <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, was the real founder of the future greatness of the
 <title>Times</title>; and he, too, had his rubs. In <datestruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct> he offended the Government by denouncing the foolish Catamaran expedition. For this the Government meanly deprived his family of the printing for the Customs, and also withdrew their advertisements. During the war of <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct> the Government stopped all the foreign papers sent to the <title>Times</title>. Walter, stopped by no obstacle, at once contrived other means to secure early news, and had the triumph of announcing the capitulation of Flushing <num value="48">forty-eight</num> hours before the intelligence had arrived through any other channel.
<p>There were no reviews of books in the <title>Times</title>
till long after it was started, but it paid great attention to the drama from its commencement. There were no leading articles for several years, yet in the very <num value="1">first</num> year the <title>Times</title> displays threefold as many advertisements as its contemporaries. For many years Mr. Walter, with his usual sagacity and energy, endeavoured to mature some plan for printing the <title>Times</title> by steam. As early as <datestruct value="1804"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct> a compositor named Martyn had invented a machine for the purpose of superseding the hand-press, which took hours struggling over the <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4000">four thousand</num> copies of the <title>Times</title>. The pressmen threatened destruction to the new machine, and it <pb id="p.213" n="213"> had to be smuggled piecemeal into the premises, while Martyn sheltered himself under various disguises to escape the vengeance of the workmen. On the eve of success, however, Walter's father lost courage, stopped the supplies, and the project was for the time abandoned. In <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct> Walter, however, returned to the charge. Koenig and Barnes put their machinery in premises adjoining the <title>Times</title>
office, to avoid the violence of the pressmen. At <num value="1">one</num> time the <num value="2">two</num> inventors are said to have abandoned their machinery in despair, but a clerical friend of Walter examined the difficulty and removed it. The night came at last when the great experiment was to be made. The unconscious pressmen were kept waiting in the next office for news from the Continent. At <num value="6">six</num> o'clock in the morning Mr. Walter entered the press-room, with a wet paper in his hand, and astonished the men by telling them that the <title>Times</title> had just been printed by steam. If they attempted violence, he said, there was a force ready to suppress it; but if they were peaceable their wages should be continued until employment was found for them. He could now print <num value="1100">1,100</num> sheets an hour. By-and-by Koenig's machine proved too complicated, and Messrs. Applegarth and Cowper invented a cylindrical <num value="1">one</num>, that printed <num value="8000">8,000</num> an hour. Then came Hoe's process, which is now said to print at the rate of from <num value="18000">18,000</num> to <num value="22000">22,000</num> copies an hour (Grant). The various improvements in steam-printing have altogether cost the <title>Times,</title>
according to general report, not less than <measure value="80000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="80000">80,000</num></measure>.

Drugs in the Middle Ages were sold by grocers and pepperers, or by the doctors themselves, who, early in James's reign, formed <num value="1">one</num> company with the apothecaries; but the ill-assorted union lasted only <num value="11">eleven</num> years, for the apothecaries were then fast becoming doctors themselves.
<p>Garth, in his <title>Dispensary,</title> describes, in the Hogarthian manner, the topographical position of Apothecaries' Hall:.:--,

<p>Gradually the apothecaries, refusing to be merely <QUOTE>the doctors' tools,</QUOTE> began to encroach more and more on the doctors' province, and to prescribe for and even cure the poor. In <datestruct value="1687--"><year reg="1687">1687</year></datestruct> (James II.) open war broke out. <num value="1">First</num> Dryden, then Pope, fought on the side of the doctors against the humbler men, whom they were taught to consider as mere greedy mechanics and empirics.

<p>The origin of the memorable affray between the- College of Physicians and the Company of Apothecaries is admirably told by Mr. Jeaffreson, in his.
<title>Book of Doctors.</title> The younger physicians, impatient at beholding the increasing prosperity and influence of the apothecaries, and the older ones indignant at seeing a class of men they had despised creeping into their quarters, and craftily laying hold of a portion of their monopoly, concocted a scheme to reinstate themselves in public favour. Without a doubt, many of the physicians. who countenanced this scheme gave it their support: from purely charitable motives; but it cannot be questioned that, as a body, the dispensarians were only actuated in their humanitarian exertions by a desire to lower the apothecaries and raise themselves in the eyes of the world. In <datestruct value="1687--"><year reg="1687">1687</year></datestruct> the physicians, at a college meeting, voted <QUOTE>that all members of the college, whether fellows, candidates, or licentiates, should give their advice gratis to all their sick neighbouring poor, when desired, within the city of London, or <num value="7">seven</num> miles round.</QUOTE> he poor folk carried their prescriptions to the apothecaries, to learn that the trade charge for dispensing them was beyond their means. The: physicians asserted that the demands of the drugvendors were extortionate, and were not reduced. to meet the finances of the applicants, to the end that the undertakings of benevolence might prove. abortive. This was, of course, absurd. The apothecaries knew their own interests better than to oppose a system which at least rendered drugconsuming fashionable with the lower orders. Perhaps they regarded the poor as their peculiar property as a field of practice, and felt insulted at having the same humble people for whom they had pompously prescribed, and put up boluses at. twopence apiece, now entering their shops with. papers dictating what the twopenny bolus was to, be composed of. But the charge preferred against: them was groundless. Indeed, a numerous body of the apothecaries expressly offered to sell medicines <QUOTE>to the poor within their respective parishes <pb id="p.216" n="216"> at such rates as the committee of physicians should think reasonable.</QUOTE>
<p>But this would not suit the game of the physicians. <QUOTE>A proposal was started by a committee of the college that the college should furnish the medicines of the poor, and perfect alone that charity which the apothecaries refused to concur in; and, after divers methods ineffectually tried, and much time wasted in endeavouring to bring the apothecaries to terms of reason in relation to the poor, an instrument was subscribed by divers charitably-disposed members of the college, now in numbers about <num value="50">fifty</num>, wherein they obliged themselves to pay <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure> apiece towards the pre-

 paring and delivering medicines at their intrinsic value.</QUOTE>
<p>Such was the version of the affair given by the college apologists. The plan was acted upon, and a dispensary was eventually established (some <num value="9">nine</num> years after the vote of <datestruct value="1687--"><year reg="1687">1687</year></datestruct>) at the
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.216.1">College of Physicians, Warwick Lane</lemma>, where medicines were vended to the poor at cost price. This measure of the college was impolitic and unjuStifiable. It was unjust to that important division of the trade who were ready to vend the medicines at rates to be paid by the college authorities, for it took altogether out of their hands the small amount of profit which they, as <hi rend=italics>dealers</hi>, could have realised <pb id="p.217" n="217"> on those terms. It was also an eminently unwise course. The College sank to the level of the Apothecaries' Hall, becoming an emporium for the sale of medicines. It was all very well to say that no profit was made on such sale, the censorious world would not believe it. The apothecaries and their friends denied that such was the fact, and vowed that the benevolent dispensarians were bent only on underselling and ruining them.
<p>Again, the movement introduced dissensions within the walls of the college. Many of the <num value="1">first</num> physicians, with the conservatism of success, did not care to offend the apothecaries, who were continually calling them in and paying them
<FIGURE id="Fig.217" n="2000.06.0079"><HEAD>Outer Court Of La Belle Sauvage In <datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>, From An Original Drawing In Mr. Gardner's Collection (see page <num value="221">221</num>).</HEAD></FIGURE>
 fees. They therefore joined in the cry against the dispensary. The profession was split up into <num value="2">two</num> parties-Dispensarians and AntiDispen- sarians. The apothecaries combined, and agreed not to recommend the Dispensarians. The Anti- Dispensarians repaid this ill service by refusing to meet Dispensarians in consultation. Sir Thomas Millington, the President of the College, Hans Sloane, John Woodward, Sir Edmund King, and Sir Samuel Garth, were amongst the latter. Of these the last named was the man who rendered the most efficient service to his party. For a time Garth's great poem, <title>The Dispensary,</title> covered the apothecaries and Anti-Dispensarians with <pb id="p.218" n="218"> ridicule. It rapidly passed through numerous editions. To say that of all the books, pamphlets, and broadsheets thrown out by the combatants on both sides, it is by far the <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest merit, would be scant justice, when it might almost be said that it is the only <num value="1">one</num> of them that can now be read by a gentleman without a sense of annoy- Dance and disgust. There is no point of view from which the medical profession appears in a more humiliating and contemptible light than that which the literature of this memorable squabble presents to the student. Charges of ignorance, dishonesty, and extortion were preferred on both sides. And the Dispensarian physicians did not hesitate to taunt their brethren of the opposite camp with playing corruptly into the hands of the apothecaries --prescribing enormous and unnecessary quantities of medicine, so that the drug-vendors might make heavy bills, and, as a consequence, recommend in all directions such complacent superiors to be called in. Garth's, unfair and violent though it'is, nowhere offends against decency. As a work of art it cannot be ranked high, and is now deservedly forgotten, although it has many good lines and some felicitous satire. Garth lived to see the apothecaries gradually emancipate themselves from the ignominious regulations to which they consented when their vocation was <num value="1">first</num> separated from the grocery trade. <num value="4">Four</num> years after his death they obtained legal acknowledgment of their right to dispense and sell medicines without the prescription of a physician; and <num value="6">six</num> years later the law again decided in their favour with regard to the physicians' right of examining and condemning their drugs. In <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>, Mr. Rose, an apothecary, on being prosecuted by the college for prescribing as well as compounding medicines, carried the matter into the House of Lords, and obtained a favourable decision; and from <datestruct value="1727--"><year reg="1727">1727</year></datestruct>, in which year Mr. Goodwin, an apothecary, obtained in a court of law a considerable sum for an illegal seizure of his wares (by Drs. Arbuthnot, Bale, and Levit), the physicians may be said to have discontinued to exercise their privileges of inspection.
<p>In his elaborate poem Garth cruelly caricatures the apothecaries of his day:--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=stanza><L>Long has he been of that amphibious fry,
<L>Bold to prescribe, and busy to apply;
<L>His shop the gazing vulgar's eyes employs,

<L>And there the tortoise hung her coat of mail;
<L>Not far from some huge shark's devouring head
<L>The flying-fish their finny pinions spread.

<L>Nay, they discover, too, their spite is such,
<L>That health, than crowns more valued, cost not much;
<L>Whilst we must steer our conduct by these rules,
<L>To cheat as tradesmen, or to starve as fools.</QUOTE>

<p>Before finally leaving Blackfriars, let us gather up a few reminiscences of the King's and Queen's printers Who here <num value="1">first</num> worked their inky presses.
<p>Queen Anne, by patent in <datestruct value="1713--"><year reg="1713">1713</year></datestruct>, constituted Benjamin Tooke, of Fleet Street, and John Barber  (afterwards Alderman Barber), Queen's printers for <num value="30">thirty</num> years. This Barber, a high Tory and suspected Jacobite, was Swift's printer and warm friend. remarkable story is told of Barber's dexterity in his profession. Being threatened with a prosecution by the House of Lords, for an offensive paragraph in a pamphlet which he had printed, and being warned of his danger by Lord Bolingbroke, he called in all the copies from the publishers, cancelled the leaf which contained the obnoxious passage, and returned them to the booksellers with a new paragraph supplied by Lord Bolingbroke; so that when the pamphlet was produced before the House, and the passage referred to, it was found unexceptionable. He added greatly to his wealth by the South Sea Scheme, which he had prudence enough to secure in time, and purchased an estate at East Sheen with part of his gain. In principles he was a Jacobite; and in his travels to Italy, whither he went for the recovery of his health, he was introduced to the Pretender, which exposed him to some danger on his return to England; for, immediately on. his arrival, he was taken into custody by a King's messenger, but was released without punishment. After his success in the South Sea Scheme, he was elected Alderman of Castle Baynard Ward, <num value="1">1</num> <num value="722">722</num>; sheriff, <datestruct value="1730--"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>; and, in <datestruct value="1732--"><year reg="1732">1732</year></datestruct>-<num value="3">3</num>, Lord Mayor of London.
<p>John Baskett subsequently purchased both shares of the patent, but his printing-offices in Blackfriars (now Printing House Square) were soon afterwards destroyed by fire. In <datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct> George II. granted a fresh patent to Baskett for <num value="60">sixty</num> years, with the privilege of supplying Parliament with stationery. Half this lease Baskett sold to Charles Eyre, who eventually appointed William Strahan his printer. <pb id="p.219" n="219"> Strahan soon after brought in Mr. Eyre, and in <datestruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct> erected extensive premises in Printer Street, New Street Square, between Gough Square and Fetter Lane, near the present offices of Mr. Spottiswoode, <num value="1">one</num> of whose family married Mr. Strahan's daughter. Strahan died a year after his old friend, Dr. Johnson, at his house in New Street, leaving <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> to the Stationers' Company, which his son Andrew augmented with <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure> more. This son died in <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="83">eighty-three</num>.
<p>William Strahan, the son of a Scotch Customhouse officer, had come up to London a poor printers' boy, and worked his way to wealth and social distinction. He was associated with Cadell in the purchase of copyrights, on the death of Cadell's partner and former master, Andrew Millar, who died <hi rend=italics>circa</hi> <datestruct value="1768--"><year reg="1768">1768</year></datestruct>. The names of Strahan and Cadell appeared on the title-pages of the great works of Gibbon, Robertson, Adam Smith, and Blackstone. In <datestruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></datestruct> Hume wrote to Strahan, <QUOTE>There will be no books of reputation now to be printed in London, but through your hands and Mr. Cadell's.</QUOTE> Gibbon's history was a vast success. he <num value="1">first</num> edition of <num value="1000">1,000</num> went off in a few days. his produced <measure value="490l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="490">490</num></measure>, of which Gibbon received  <measure value="326l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="326">326</num></measure> <measure value="13s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="13">13</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> The great history was finished in <datestruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct>, by the publication of the <num value="4">fourth</num> quarto volume. It appeared on the author's <num value="51">fifty-first</num> birthday, and the double festival was celebrated by a dinner at Mr. Cadell's, when complimentary verses from that wretched poet, Hayley, made the great man with the button-hole mouth blush or feign to blush. That was a proud day for Gibbon, and a proud day for Messrs. Cadell and Strahan.
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> Strahan, Johnson's friend, was M.P. for Malmesbury and Wootton Bassett (<datestruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct>-<num value="84">84</num>), and his taking to a carriage was the subject of a recorded conversation between Boswell and Johnson, who gloried in his friend's success. It was Strahan who, with Johnston and Dodsley, purchased, in <datestruct value="1759--"><year reg="1759">1759</year></datestruct>, for <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>, the <num value="1">first</num> edition of Johnson's <title>Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia,</title> that sententious story, which Johnson wrote in a week, to defray the expenses of his mother's funeral.
<p>Boswell has recorded several conversations between Dr. Johnson and Strahan. Strahan, at the doctor's return from the Hebrides, asked him,--with a firm tone of voice, what he thought of his country. <QUOTE>That it is a very vile country, to be sure, sir,</QUOTE> returned for answer Dr. Johnson. <QUOTE>Well, sir,</QUOTE> replied the other, somewhat mortified, <QUOTE>God made it.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Certainly he did,</QUOTE> answered Dr. Johnson again; <QUOTE>but we must always remember that he made it for Scotchmen, and--comparisons are odious, Mr. Strahan--but God made hell.</QUOTE>
<p>Boswell has also a pretty anecdote relating to <num value="1">one</num> of the doctor's visits to Strahan's printingoffice, which shows the <QUOTE>Great Bear</QUOTE> in a very amiable light, and the scene altogether is not unworthy of the artist's pencil.
<p> <QUOTE>Mr. Strahan,</QUOTE> says Boswell, <QUOTE>had taken a poor boy from the country as an apprentice, upon Johnson's recommendation. Johnson having inquired after him, said,  <Q>Mr. Strahan, let me have <num value="5">five</num> guineas on account, and I'll give this boy <num value="1">one</num>. Nay, if a man recommends a boy, and does nothing for him, it is a sad work. Call him down.</Q>  I followed him into the court-yard, behind Mr. Strahan's house, and there I had a proof of what I heard him profess--that he talked alike to all.  <Q>Some people will tell you that they let themselves down to the capacity of their hearers. I never do that. I speak uniformly in as intelligible a manner as I can.</Q>   <Q>Well, my boy, how do you go on?</Q>   <Q>Pretty well, sir; but they are afraid I'm not strong enough for some parts of the business.</Q>  Johnson:  <Q>Why, I shall be sorry for it; for when you consider with how little mental power and corporal labour a printer can get a guinea a week, it is a very desirable occupation for you. Do you hear? Take all the pains you can; and if this does not do, we must think of some other way of life for you. here's a guinea.</Q>  Here was <num value="1">one</num> of the many instances of his active benevolence. At the same time the slow and sonorous solemnity with which, while he bent himself down, he addressed a little thick, short-legged boy, contrasted with the boy's awkwardness and awe, could not but excite some ludicrous emotions.</QUOTE>
<p>In Ireland Yard, on the west side of St. Andrew's Hill, and in the parish of St. Anne, Blackfriars, stood the house which Shakespeare bought, in the year <datestruct value="1612"><year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct>, and which he bequeathed by will to his daughter, Susanna Hall. In the deed of conveyance to the poet, the house is described as <QUOTE>abutting upon a street leading down to Puddle Wharf, and now or late in the tenure or occupation of <num value="1">one</num> William Ireland</QUOTE> (hence, we suppose, Ireland Yard), <QUOTE>part of which said tenement is erected over a great gate leading to a capital messuage, which some time was in the tenure of William Blackwell, Esq., deceased, and since that in the tenure or occupation of the Right Honourable Henry, now Earl of Northumberland.</QUOTE> The original deed of conveyance is shown in the City of London Library, at Guildhall, under a handsome glass case.
<p>The street leading down to Puddle Wharf is called St. Andrew's Hill, from the Church of St. Andrew's-in-the-Wardrobe. The proper name (says Cunningham) is Puddle Dock Hill. <pb id="p.220" n="220">

<p>Of all the eyesores of modern London, surely the most hideous is the
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.220.4">Ludgate Hill Viaduct</LEMMA>- that enormous flat iron that lies across the chest of Ludgate Hill like a bar of metal on the breast of a wretch in a torture-chamber. Let us hope that a time will come when all designs for City improvements will be compelled to endure the scrutiny and win the approval of a committee of taste. The useful and the beautiful must not for ever be divorced. The railway bridge lies flat across the street, only eighteen feet above the roadway, and is a miracle of clumsy and stubborn ugliness, entirely spoiling the approach to <num value="1">one</num> of the finest buildings in London. The <num value="5">five</num> girders of wrought iron cross the street, here only <num value="42">forty-two</num> feet wide, and the span is <num value="60">sixty</num> feet, in order to allow of future enlargement of the street. Absurd lattice-work, decorative brackets, bronze armorial medallions, and gas lanterns and standards, form a combination that only the unsettled and imitative art of the ruthless <num value="19">nineteenth</num> century could have put together. Think of what the Egyptians in the times of the Pharaohs did--with granite! and observe what we Englishmen of the present day do with iron. Observe this vulgar daubing of brown paint and barbaric gilding, and think of what the Moors did with colour in the courts of the Alhambra! A viaduct was necessary, we allow, but such a viaduct even the architect of the National Gallery would have shuddered at. The difficulties, we however allow, were great. The London, Chatham, and over, eager for dividends, was bent on wedding the Metropolitan Railway near Smithfield; but how could the hands of the affianced couple be joined? If there was no viaduct, there must be a tunnel. Now, the bank of the river being a very short distance from Smithfield, a very steep and dangerous gradient would have been required to effect the junction. Moreover, had the line been carried under Ludgate Hill, there must have been a slight detour to ease the ascent, the cost of which detour would have been enormous. The tunnel proposed would have involved the destruction of a few trifles --such, for instance, as Apothecaries' Hall, the churchyard adjoining, the <title>Times</title> printing officebesides doing injury to the foundations of St. Martin's Church, the Old Bailey Sessions House, and Newgate. Moreover, no station would have been possible between the Thames and Smithfield. The puzzled inhabitants, therefore, ended in despair by giving evidence in favour of the viaduct. The stolid hammermen went to work, and the iron nightmare was set up in all its Babylonian hideousness.
<p>The enormous sum of upwards of &pound;ioooo was awarded as the Metropolitan Board's quota for removing the hoarding, for widening the pavement a few feet under the railway bridge over Ludgate Hill, and for rounding off the corner.
<p>An incredible quantity of ink has been shed about the origin of the sign of the <QUOTE>Belle Sauvage</QUOTE> inn, and even now the controversy is scarcely settled. Mr. Riley records that in <datestruct value="1380--"><year reg="1380">1380</year></datestruct> (Richard II.) a certain William Lawton was sentenced to an uncomfortable hour in the pillory for trying to obtain, by means of a forged letter, <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure> from William Savage, Fleet Street, in the parish of St. Bridget. This at least shows that Savage was the name of a citizen of the locality. In <datestruct value="1453--"><year reg="1453">1453</year></datestruct> (Henry VI.) a clause roll quoted by Mr. Lysons notices the bequest of John French to his mother, Joan French, widow, of <QUOTE>Savage's Inn,</QUOTE> otherwise called the <QUOTE>Bell in the Hoop,</QUOTE> in the parish of St. Bride's. Stow (Elizabeth) mentions a Mrs. Savage as having given the inn to the Cutlers' Company, which, however, the books of that company disprove. This, anyhow, is certain, that in <datestruct value="1568--"><year reg="1568">1568</year></datestruct> (Elizabeth) a John Craythorne gave the reversion of the <QUOTE>Belle Sauvage</QUOTE> to the Cutlers' Company, on condition that <num value="2">two</num>-exhibitions to the university and certain sums to poor prisoners be paid by them out of the estate. A portrait of Craythorne's wife still hangs in Cutler's Hall. In <datestruct value="1584--"><year reg="1584">1584</year></datestruct> the inn was described as <QUOTE>Ye Belle Savage.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1648--"><year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct> the landlords' tokens exhibited (says Mr. Noble) an Indian woman holding a bow and arrow. The sign in Queen Anne's time was a savage man standing by a bell. The question, therefore, is, Whether the name of the inn was originally derived from Isabel (Bel) Savage, the <pb id="p.221" n="221"> landlady, or the sign of the bell and savage; or whether it was, as the <title>Spectator</title> cleverly suggests, from La Belle Sauvage, <QUOTE>the beautiful savage,</QUOTE> which is a derivation very generally received. There is an old French romance formerly popular in this country, the heroine of which was known as La Belle Sauvage; and it is possible that Mrs. Isabel Savage, the ancient landlady, might have become in time confused with the heroine of the old romance.
<p>In the ante-Shakespearean days our early actors performed in inn-yards, the court-yard representing the pit, the upper and lower galleies the boxes and gallery of the modern theatre. The <QUOTE>Belle Sauvage,</QUOTE> says Mr. Collier, was a favourite place for these performances. There was also a school of defence, or fencing school, here in Queen Elizabeth's time; so many a hot Tybalt and fiery Mercutio have here crossed rapiers, and many a silk button has been reft from gay doublets by the quick passadoes of the young swordsmen who ruffled it in the Strand. This quondam inn was also the place where Banks, the showman (so often mentioned by Nash and others in Elizabethan pamphlets and lampoons), exhibited his wonderful trained horse <QUOTE>Marocco,</QUOTE> the animal which once ascended the tower of St. Paul's, and who on another occasion, at his master's bidding, delighted the mob by selecting Tarleton, the low comedian, as the greatest fool present. Banks eventually took his horse, which was shod with silver, to Rome, and the priests, frightened at the circus tricks, burnt both <QUOTE>Marocco</QUOTE> and his master for witchcraft. At No. <num value="11">11</num> in this yard-now such a little world of industry, although it no longer rings with the stage-coach horn-lived in his obscurer days that great carver in wood,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.221.1">Grinling Gibbons</lemma>, whose genius Evelyn <num value="1">first</num> brought under the notice of Charles II. Horace Walpole says that, as a sort of advertisement, Gibbons carved an exquisite pot of flowers in wood, which stood on his window-sill, and shook surprisingly with the motion of the coaches that passed beneath. No man (says Walpole) before Gibbons had <QUOTE>ever given to wood the loose and airy lightness of flowers, or linked together the various productions of the elements with a free disorder natural to each species.</QUOTE> His <hi rend=italics>chef d&lsquo;oeuvre</hi> of skill was an imitation point-lace cravat, which he carved at Chatsworth for the Duke of Devonshire. Petworth is also garlanded with Gibbons' fruit, flowers, and dead game.
<p>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.221.2">Belle Sauvage Yard</lemma> no longer re-echoes with the guard's rejoicing horn, and the old coaching interest is now only represented by a railway parcel office huddled up in the left-hand corner. The old galleries are gone over which pretty chambermaids leant and waved their dusters in farewell greeting to the handsome guards or smart coachmen. Industries of a very different character have now turned the old yard into a busy hive. It is not for us to dilate upon the firm whose operations are carried on here, but it may interest the reader to know that the very sheet he is now perusing was printed on the site of the old coaching inn, and published very near the old tap-room of La Belle Sauvage; for where coach-wheels once rolled and clattered, only printing-press wheels now revolve.
<p>The old inn-yard is now very much altered in plan from what it was in former days. Originally it consisted of <num value="2">two</num> courts. Into the outer <num value="1">one</num> of these the present archway from Ludgate Hill led. It at <num value="1">one</num> period certainly had contained private houses, in <num value="1">one</num> of which Grinling Gibbons had lived. The inn stood round an inner court, entered by a <num value="2">second</num> archway which stood about half-way up the present yard. Over the archway facing the outer court was the sign of <QUOTE>The Bell,</QUOTE> and all round the interior ran those covered galleries, so prominent a feature in old London inns.
<p>Near the <QUOTE>Belle Sauvage</QUOTE> resided that proud cobbler mentioned by Steele, who has recorded his eccentricities. This man had bought a wooden figure of a beau of the period, who stood before him in a bending position, and humbly presented him with his awl, wax, bristles, or whatever else his tyrannical master chose to place in his hand.
<p>To No. <num value="45">45</num> (south side), Ludgate Hill, that strange, independent man, Lamb's friend, William <num value="1">one</num>, the Radical publisher, came from Ship Court, Old Bailey, where he had published those blasphemous <title>Parodies,</title> for which he was <num value="3">three</num> times tried and acquitted, to the vexation of Lord Ellonborough. Here, having sown his seditious wild oats and broken free from the lawyers, Hone continued his occasional clever political satires, sometimes suggested by bitter Hazlitt and illustrated by George Cruikshank's inexhaustible fancy. Here <num value="1">one</num> devised those delightful miscellanies, the
<title>Every-Day Book</title> and <title>Year Book,</title> into which Lamb and many young poets threw all their humour and power. The books were commercially not very successful, but they have delighted generations, and will delight generations to come. Mr. Timbs, who saw much of Hone, describes him as sitting in a <num value="2">second</num>-floor back room, surrounded by rare books and black-letter volumes. His conversion from materialism to Christianity was apparently sudden, though the process of change had no doubt long been maturing. The story of his conversion is thus related by Mr. Timbs: <QUOTE>Hone was once called to a house, in a certain street in a part of the world of London entirely unknown <pb id="p.222" n="222">
<FIGURE id="Fig.222" n="2000.06.0080"><HEAD>The Inner Court of the Belle Sauvage. From an Original Drawing in Mr. Crace's Collection.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <pb id="p.223" n="223"> to him. As he walked he reflected on the entirely unknown region. He arrived at the house, and was shown into a room to wait. All at once, on looking round, to his astonishment and almost horror, every object he saw seemed familiar to him. He said to himself,  <Q>What is this? I was never here before, and yet I have seen all this before, and as a proof I have I now remember a very peculiar knot behind the shutters.</Q>  He opened the shutters, and found the very knot.  <Q>Now, then,</Q>  he thought,  <Q>here is something I cannot explain on any principle--there must be some power beyond matter.</Q> </QUOTE> The argument that so happily convinced Hone does not seem to us in itself as very convincing. Hone's recognition of the room was but some confused memory of an analogous place. Knots are not uncommon in deal shutters, and the discovery of

 the knot in the particular place was a mere coincidence. But, considering that Hone was a selfeducated man, and, like many sceptics, was incredulous only with regard to Christianity, and even believed he once saw an apparition in Ludgate Hill, who can be surprised?

<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.224.1">Lud Gate</LEMMA>, which Stow in his <title>Survey </title> designates the <num value="6">sixth</num> and principal gate of London, taken down in <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct> at the solicitation of the chief inhabitants of Farringdon Without and Farringdon Within, stood between the present London Tavern and the church of St. Martin. According to old Geoffry of Monmouth's fabulous history of England, this entrance to London was <num value="1">first</num> built <pb id="p.224" n="224"> by King Lud, a British monarch, <num value="66">sixty-six</num> years before Christ. Our later antiquaries, ruthless as to legends, however romantic, consider its original name to have been the Flood or Fleet Gate, which is far more feasible. Lud Gate was either repaired or rebuilt in the year <datestruct value="1215"><year reg="1215">1215</year></datestruct>, when the armed barons, under Robert Fitzwalter, repulsed at Northampton, were welcomed to London, and there awaited King John's concession of the Magna Charta. While in the metropolis these greedy and fanatical barons spent their time in spoiling the houses of the rich Jews, and used the stones in strengthening the walls and gates of the City. That this tradition is true was proved in <datestruct value="1586--"><year reg="1586">1586</year></datestruct>, when (as Stow says) all the gate was rebuilt. Embedded among other stones was found <num value="1">one</num> on which was engraved, in Hebrew characters, the words <QUOTE>This is the ward of Rabbi Moses, the son of the honourable Rabbi Isaac.</QUOTE> This stone was probably the sign of <num value="1">one</num> of the Jewish houses pulled down by Fitzwalter, Magnaville, and the Earl of Gloucester, perhaps for the express purpose of obtaining ready materials for strengthening the bulwarks of London. In <datestruct value="1260--"><year reg="1260">1260</year></datestruct> (Henry III.) Lud Gate was repaired, and beautified with images of King Lud and other monarchs. In the reign of Edward VI. the citizens, zealous against everything that approached idolatry, smote off the heads of Lud and his family; but Queen Mary, partial to all images, afterwards replaced the heads on the old bodies.
<p>In <datestruct value="1554--"><year reg="1554">1554</year></datestruct> King Lud and his sons looked down on a street seething with angry men, and saw blood shed upon the hill leading to St. Paul's. Sir Thomas Wyat, a Kentish gentleman, urged by the Earl of Deyon, and led on by the almost universal dread of Queen Mary's marriage with the bigoted Philip of Spain, assembled <num value="1500">1,500</num> armed men at Rochester Castle, and, aided by <num value="500">500</num> Londoners, who deserted to him, raised the standard of insurrection. <num value="5">Five</num> vessels of the fleet joined him, and with <num value="7">seven</num> pieces of artillery, captured from the Duke of Norfolk, he marched upon London. Soon followed by <num value="15000">15,000</num> men, eager to save the Princess Elizabeth, Wyat marched through Dartford to Greenwich and Deptford. With a force now dwindled to <num value="7000">7,000</num> men, Wyat attacked London Bridge. Driven from there by the Tower guns, he marched to Kingston, crossed the river, resolving to beat back the Queen's troops at Brentford, and attempt to enter the City by Lud Gate, which some of the Protestant citizens had offered to throw open to him. The Queen, with true Tudor courage, refused to leave St. James's, and in a council of war it was agreed to throw a strong force into Lud Gate, and, permitting Wyat's advance up Fleet Street, to enclose him like a wild boar in the toils. At <num value="9">nine</num> on a February morning, <datestruct value="1554--"><year reg="1554">1554</year></datestruct>, Wyat reached Hyde Park Corner, was cannonaded at Hay Hil, and further on towards Charing Cross he and some <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="400">four hundred</num> men were cut off from his other followers. Rushing on with a standard through Piccadilly, Wyat reached Lud Gate. There (says Stow) he knocked, calling out, <QUOTE>I am Wyat; the Queen has granted all my petitions.</QUOTE>
<p>But the only reply from the strongly-guarded gate was the rough, stern voice of Lord William Howard-- <QUOTE>Avaunt, traitor; thou shalt have no entrance here.</QUOTE>
<p>No friends appearing, and the Royal troops closing upon him, Wyat said, <QUOTE>I have kept my promise,</QUOTE> and retiring, silent and desponding, sat down to rest on a stall opposite the gate of the <QUOTE>Belle Sauvage.</QUOTE> Roused by the shouts and sounds of fighting, he fought his way back, with <num value="40">forty</num> of his staunchest followers, to Temple Bar, which was held by a squadron of horse. There the Norroy King-of-Arms exhorted him to spare blood and yield himself a prisoner. Wyat then surrendered himself to Sir Maurice Berkeley, who just then happened to ride by, ignorant of the affray, and, seated behind Sir Maurice, he was taken to St. James's. On April IIth Wyat perished on the scaffold at Tower Hill. This rash rebellion also led to the immediate execution of the innocent and unhappy Lady Jane Grey and her husband, Guilford Dudley, endangered the life of the Princess Elizabeth, and hastened the Queen's marriage with Philip, which took place at Winchester, <datestruct value="07-25"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=25>25th</day></datestruct> of the same year.
<p>In the reign of Elizabeth (<datestruct value="1586--"><year reg="1586">1586</year></datestruct>), the old gate, being <QUOTE>sore decayed,</QUOTE> was pulled down, and was newly built, with images of Lud and others on the east side, and a <QUOTE>picture of the lion-hearted queen</QUOTE> on the west, the cost of the whole being over ,<num value="1500">1,500</num>.
<p>Lud Gate became a free debtors' prison the <num value="1">first</num> year of Richard II., and was enlarged in <datestruct value="1463--"><year reg="1463">1463</year></datestruct> (Edward IV.) by that <QUOTE>well-disposed, blessed, and devout woman,</QUOTE> the widow of Stephen Forster, fishmonger, Mayor of London in <datestruct value="1454--"><year reg="1454">1454</year></datestruct>. Of this benefactress of Lud Gate, Maitland (<datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>) has the following legend. Forster himself, according to this story, in his younger days had once been a pining prisoner in Lud Gate. Being <num value="1">one</num> day at the begging grate, a rich widow asked how much would release him. He said, <QUOTE><measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">Twenty</num> pounds</measure>.</QUOTE> She paid it, and took him into her service, where, by his indefatigable application to business, he so gained her affections that she married him, and he <pb id="p.225" n="225"> earned so great riches by commerce that she concurred with him to make his former prison more commodious, and to endow a new chapel, where, on a wall, there was this inscription on a brass plate:--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Devout souls that pass this way,
<L>For Stephen Forster, late Lord Mayor, heartily pray,
<L>And lame Agnes, his spouse, to God consecrate,
<L>That of pity this house made for Londoners in Lud Gate;
<L>So that for lodging and water prisoners here nought pay,
<L>As their keepers shall all answer at dreadful doomsday.</QUOTE>

<p>This legend of Lud Gate is also the foundation of Rowley's comedy of <title>A Woman Never Vext; or, The Widow of Cornhill</title>, which has in our times been revived, with alterations, by Mr. Planche. In the <num value="1">first</num> scene of the <num value="5">fifth</num> act occurs the following passage:--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><sp><SPEAKER>Mrs. S. Forster.</SPEAKER><L>But why remove the prisoners from Ludgate?
<sp><SPEAKER>Stephen Forster.</SPEAKER><L>To take the prison down and build it new,
<L>With leads to walk on, chambers large and fair;
<L>For when myself lay there the noxious air
<L>Choked up my spirits. None but captives, wife,
<L>Can know what captives feel.</QUOTE>

<P>Stow, however, seems to deny this story, and suggests that it arose from some mistake. The stone with the inscription was preserved by Stow when the gate was rebuilt, together. with Forster's arms, <QUOTE><num value="3">three</num> broad arrow-heads,</QUOTE> and was fixel over the entry to the prison. The enlargemenit of the prison on the south-east side formed a quiadrant <num value="38">thirty-eight</num> feet long and <num value="29">twenty-nine</num> feet wide. here were prisoners' rooms above it, with a leaden roof, where the debtors could walk, and both lodging and water were free of charge.
<p>Strype says the prisoners in Ludgate were chiefly merchants and tradesmen, Who had been driven to want by losses at sea. When King Philip came to London after his marriage with Mary in <datestruct value="1554--"><year reg="1554">1554</year></datestruct> <num value="30">thirty</num> prisoners in Lud Gate, who were in gaol for <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>, compounded for at <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure>, presented the king a well-penned Latin speech, written by <QUOTE>the curious pen</QUOTE> of Roger Ascham, praying the king to redress their miseries, and by his royal generosity to free them, inasmuch as the place was not <hi rend=italics>sceleratorum--carcer, sed miserorum custodia</hi> (not a dungeon for the wicked, but a place of detention for the wretched).
<p>Marmaduke Johnson, a poor debtor in Lud Gate the year before the Restoration, wrote a curious account of the prison, which Strype printed. The officials in <QUOTE>King Lud's House</QUOTE> seem to have been--<num value="1">1</num>, a reader of Divine service; <num value="2">2</num>, the upper steward, called the master of the box; <num value="3">3</num>, the understeward; <num value="4">4</num>, <num value="7">seven</num> assistants--that is <num value="1">one</num> for every day of the week; <num value="5">5</num>, a running assistant; <num value="6">6</num>, <num value="2">two</num> churchwardens; <num value="7">7</num>, a scavenger; <num value="8">8</num>, a chamberlain; <num value="9">9</num>, a runner; <num value="10">10</num>, the cryers at the grate, <num value="6">six</num> in number, who by turns kept up the ceaseless cry to the passers-by of <QUOTE>Remember the poor prisoners!</QUOTE> The officers' charge (says Johnson) for taking a debtor to Ludgate was sometimes <num value="3">three</num>, <num value="4">four</num>, or <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure>, though their just due is but twopence; for entering name and address, <measure value="14d." type=currency><num value="14">fourteen</num> pence</measure> to the turnkey; a lodging is <num value="1">one</num> penny, twopence, or threepence; for sheets to the chamberlain, eighteenpence; to chamber-fellows a garnish of <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> shillings</measure> (for non-payment of this his clothes were take naway, or <QUOTE>mobbed,</QUOTE> as it was called, till he did pay); and the next day a due of <measure value="16d." type=currency><num value="16">sixteen</num> pence</measure> to <num value="1">one</num> of the stewards, which was called table money. At his discharge the several fees were as follows:--<measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">Two</num> shillings</measure> the master's fee; <measure value="14d." type=currency><num value="14">fourteen</num> pence</measure> for the turning of the key; <measure value="12d." type=currency><num value="12">twelve</num> pence</measure> for every action that lay against him.

The exorbitant prison fees of <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> shillings</measure> a day swallowed up all the prison bequests, and the miserable debtors had to rely on better means from the Lord Mayor's table, the light bread seized by the clerk of the markets, and presents of under-sized and illegal fish from the water-bailiffs.
<P>A curious handbill of the year <datestruct value="1664"><year reg="1664">1664</year></datestruct>, preserved by Mr. Collier, and containing a petition of <num value="180">180</num> poor Ludgate prisoners, seems to have been a circular taken by the alms-seekers of the prison, who perambulated the streets with baskets at their backs and a sealed money-box in their hands. <QUOTE>We most humbly beseech you,</QUOTE> sys the handbill, <QUOTE>even for God's cause, to relieve us with your charitable benevolence, and to put into this bearer's box--the same being sealed with the house seal, as it is figured upon this petition.</QUOTE>
<P>A quarto tract, entitled <title>Prison Thoughts,</title> by Thomas Browning, citizen and cook of London, a prisoner in Lud Gate, <QUOTE>where poor citizens are confined and starve amidst copies of their freedom,</QUOTE> was published in that prison, by the author, in <datestruct value="1682--"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct>. It is written both in prose and verse, and probably gave origin to Dr. Dodd's more elaborate work on the same subject. The following is a specimen of the poetry:--

<P>The prison at Lud Gate was gutted by the Great Fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, and in <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>, the year of George III.'s accession, the gate, impeding traffic, was taken down, and the materials sold for <num value="148">148</num>. The prisoners were removed to the London Workhouse, in Bishopdgate Street, a part whereof was fitted for that purpose, and Lud Gate prisoners continued to be received there until the year <datestruct value="1794"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>, when they were removed to the prison of Lud Gate, adjoining the compter in Giltspur Street.
<P>When old Lud Gate was pulled down, Lud and his worthy sons were given by the City to Sir Francis Gosling, who intended to set them up at the east end of St. Dunstan's. Nevertheless the royal effigies, of very rude workmanship, were sent to end their days in the parish bone-house; a better fate, however, awaited them, for the late Marquis of Hertford eventually purchased them, and they are now, with St. Dunstan's clock, in Hertford Villa, Regent's Park. The statue of Elizabeth was placed in a niche in the outer wall of old St. Dunstan's Church, and it still adorns the new church, as we have before mentioned in our chapter on Fleet Street.
<p>In <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct> an interesting discovery was made in St. Martin's Court, Ludgate Hill. Workmen came upon the

 line with the Old Bailey they found another outwork. A fragment of it in a court is now built up. A fire which took place on the premises of Messrs. Kay, Ludgate Hill, <datestruct VALUE="1792-05-1"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=1>1</day>, <year reg=1792>1792</year></datestruct>, disclosed these interesting ruins, probably left by the soldiers after the fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct> as a foundation for new buildings. The tower projected <num value="4">four</num> feet from the wall into the City ditch, and measured <num value="22">twenty-two</num> feet from top to bottom. The stones were of different sizes, the largest and the corner rudely squared. They had been bound together with cement of hot lime, so that wedges had to be used to split the blocks asunder. Small square holes in the sides of the tower seemed to have been used either to receive floor timbers, or as peep-holes for the sentries. The adjacent part of the City wall was about <num value="8">eight</num> feet thick, and of rude workmanship, consisting of irregular-sized stones, chalk, and flint. The only bricks seen in this part of the wall were on the south side, bounding Stonecutters' Alley. On the east half of Chatham Place, Blackfriars Bridge, stood the tower built by order of Edward I., at the end of a continuation of the City wall, running from Lud Gate behind the houses in Fleet Ditch to the Thames. A rare plan of London, by Hollar (says Mr. J. T. Smith), marks this tower. Roman monuments have been so frequently dug up near St. Martin's Church, that there is no doubt that a Roman extra-mural cemetery once existed here; in the same locality, in <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>, a sepulchral monument was dug up, dedicated to Claudina Mertina, by her husband, a Roman soldier. A fragment of a statue of Hercules and a female head were also found, and were preserved at the <QUOTE>London</QUOTE> Coffee House.

<p>Strype says of St. Martin's- <QUOTE>It is very comely, and ascended up by stone steps, well finished within; and hath a most curious spire steeple, of excellent workmanship, pleasant to behold.</QUOTE> The new church stands farther back than the old. The little black spire that adorns the tower rises from a small bulb of a cupola, round which runs a light gallery.

 This inscription, according to Mr. G. Godwin (<title>Churches of London</title> ), is also found on the font in the basilica of St. Sophia, Constantinople.

<p><num value="1">One</num> great man, at least, has been connected with this church, where the Knights Templars were put to trial, and that was good old Purchas, the editor and enlarger of <title>Hakluyt's Voyages.</title> He was rector of this parish. Hakluyt was a prebendary of Westminster, who, with a passion for geographical research, though he himself never ventured farther than Paris, had devoted his life, encouraged by Drake and Raleigh, in collecting from old libraries and the lips of venturous merchants and sea-captains travels in various countries. The manuscript remains were bought by Purchas, who, with a veneration worthy of that heroic and chivalrous age, wove them into his
<title>Pilgrims</title> (<num value="5">five</num> vols., folio), which are a treasury of travel, exploit, and curious adventures. It has been said that Purchas ruined himself by this publication, and that he died in prison. This is not, however, true. He seems to have impoverished himself chiefly by taking upon himself the care and cost of his brother and brother-in-law's children. He appears to have been a single-minded man, with a thorough devotion to geographic study. Charles I. promised him a deanery, but Purchas did not live to enjoy it.
<p>There is an architectural tradition that Wren purposely designed the spire of St. Martin's, Ludgate, small and slender, to give a greater dignity to the dome of St. Paul's.
<p>The London Coffee House, <num value="24">24</num> to <num value="26">26</num>, Ludgate Hill, a place of celebrity in its day, was <num value="1">first</num> opened in <datestruct VALUE="1731-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1731">1731</year></datestruct>.

<p>The Stationers' Company, for <num value="2">two</num> important centuries in English history (says Mr. Cunningham), had pretty well the monopoly of learning. Printers were obliged to serve their time to a member of the Company; and almost every publication, from a Bible to a ballad, was required to be <QUOTE>entered at Stationers' Hall.</QUOTE> The service is now unnecessary, but Parliament still requires, under the recent Copyright Act, that the proprietor of every published work should register his claim in the books of the Stationers' Company, and pay a fee of <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure>. The number of the freemen of the Company is between <num value="1000">1,000</num> and <num value="1100">1,100</num>, and of the livery, or leading persons, about <num value="450">450</num>. The capital of the Company amounts to upwards of <measure value="40000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="40000">40,000</num></measure>, divided into shares, varying in value from <measure value="40l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40">40</num></measure> to  <measure value="400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="400">400</num></measure> each. The great treasure of the Stationers' Company is its series of registers of works entered for publication. This valuable collection of entries commences in <datestruct value="1557--"><year reg="1557">1557</year></datestruct>, and, though often consulted and quoted, was never properly understood till Mr. J. Payne Collier published <num value="2">two</num> carefully-edited volumes of extracts from its earlier pages.
<p>The celebrated Bible of the year <datestruct value="1632"><year reg="1632">1632</year></datestruct>, with the important word <QUOTE>not</QUOTE> omitted in the <num value="7">seventh</num> commandment-- <QUOTE>Thou shalt <hi rend=italics>not</hi> commit adultery</QUOTE> --was printed by the Stationers' Company. Archbishop Laud made a Star-Chamber matter of the omission, and a heavy fine was laid upon the Company for their neglect. And in another later edition, in Psalm xiv. the text ran, <QUOTE>The fool hath said in his hearty There is a God.</QUOTE> For the omission of the important word <QUOTE>no</QUOTE> the printer. was fined <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure>. Several other errors have occurred, but the wonder is that they have not been more frequent.
<p>The only publications which the Company continues to issue are a Latin gradus and almanacks, of which it had at <num value="1">one</num> time the entire monopoly. Almanack-day at Stationers' Hall (every <datestruct value="11-22"><day reg="22">22nd</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, at <num value="3">three</num> o'clock) is a sight worth seeing, from the bustle of the porters anxious to get off with early supplies. The Stationers' Company's almanacks are now by no means the best of the day. Mr. Charles Knight, who worked so strenuously and so, successfully for the spread of popular education, <num value="1">first</num> struck a blow at the absurd monopoly of almanack printing. So much behind the age is this privileged Company, that it actually still continues to publish
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.230.3">Moore's Quack Almanack</lemma>, with the nonsensical old astrological tables, describing the moon's influence on various parts ot the human body. <num value="1">One</num> year it is said they had the courage to leave out this farrago, with the hieroglyphics originally stolen by Lilly from monkish manuscripts, and from Lilly stolen by Moore. The result was that most of the copies were returned on their hands. They have not since dared to oppose the stolid force of vulgar ignorance. They still publish Wing's sheet almanack, though Wing was an impostor and fortune-teller, who died <num value="8">eight</num> years after the Restoration. All this is very unworthy of a privileged company, with an invested capital of <measure value="400000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="400000">400,000</num></measure>, and does not much help forward the enlightenment of the poorer classes. This Company is entitled, for the supposed security of the copyright, to <num value="2">two</num> copies of every work, however costly, published in the United Kingdom, a mischievous tax, which restrains the publication of many valuable but expensive works.
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> Stationers' Hall was in Milk Street. In <datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct> they removed to St. Peter's College, near St. Paul's Deanery, where the chantry priests of St. Paul's had previously resided.
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.230.4">The present hall</lemma> closely resembles the hall at Bridewell, having a row of oval windows above the lower range, which were fitted up by Mr. Mylne in <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>, when the chamber was cased with Portland stone and the lower windows lengthened.
<p>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.230.5">The great window at the upper end of the hall</lemma>
was erected in <datestruct value="1801--"><year reg="1801">1801</year></datestruct>, at the expense of Mr. Alderman Cadell. It includes some older glass blazoned with the arms and crest of the company, the <num value="2">two</num> emblematic figures of Religion and Learning being designed by Smirke. Like most ancient halls, it has a raised dais, or haut place, which is occupied by the Court table at the <num value="2">two</num> great dinners in August and November. On the wall, above the wainscoting, that has glowed red with the reflection of many a bumper of generous wine, are hung in decorous state the pavises or shields of arms of members of the court, which in civic processions are usually borne, by a body of pensioners, the number of whom, when the Lord Mayor is a member of the Company, corresponds with the years of that august dignitary's, age. In the old water-show these escutcheons decorated the sides of the Company's barge when they accompanied the Lord Mayor to Westminster, and called at the landing of Lambeth Palace to pay their respects to the representative of <pb id="p.231" n="231"> their former ecclesiastical censors. On this occasion the Archbishop usually sent out the thirsty Stationers a hamper of wine, while the rowers of the barge had bread and cheese and ale to their hearts' content. It is still the custom (says Mr. Nichols) to forward the Archbishop annually a set of the Company's almanacks, and some also to the Lord Chancellor and the Master of the Rolls. Formerly the <num value="12">twelve</num> judges and various other persons received the same compliment. Alas for the mutation of other things than almanacs, however; for in <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct> the Company's barge, being sold, was taken to Oxford, where it may still be seen on the Isis, the property of <num value="1">one</num> of the College boat clubs. At the upper end of the hall is a court cupboard or buffet for the display of the Company's plate, and at the lower end, on either side of the doorway, is a similar recess. The entrance-screen of the hall, guarded by allegorical. figures, and crowned by the royal arms (with the inescutcheon of Nassau-William III.), is richly adorned with carvings.

<p>Stationers' Hall was in <datestruct value="1677--"><year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct> used for Divine service by the parish of St. Martin's, Ludgate, and towards the end of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century an annual musical festival was instituted on the <datestruct value="11-22"><day reg="22">22nd</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, in commemoration of Saint Cecilia, and as an excuse for some good music. A splendid entertainment was provided in the hall, preceded by a grand concert of vocal and instrumental music, which was attended by people of the <num value="1">first</num> rank. The special attraction was always an ode to Saint Cecilia, set by Purcell, Blow, or some other eminent composer of the day. Dryden's and Pope's odes are almost too well known to need mention; but Addison, Yalden, Shadwell, and even D&lsquo;Urfey, tried their hands on praises of the same musical saint.
<P>After several odes by the mediocre satirist, Oldham, and that poor verse-maker, Nahum Tate, who scribbled upon King David's tomb, came Dryden. The music to the <num value="1">first</num> ode, says Scott, was <num value="1">first</num> written by Percival Clarke, who killed himself in a fit of lovers' melancholy in <datestruct value="1707--"><year reg="1707">1707</year></datestruct>. It was then reset by Draghi, the Italian composer, and in <datestruct value="1711--"><year reg="1711">1711</year></datestruct> was again set by Clayton for <num value="1">one</num> of Sir Richard Steele's public concerts. The <num value="1">first</num> ode (<datestruct value="1687--"><year reg="1687">1687</year></datestruct>) contains those fine lines :

<P>Of the composition of this ode, for which Dryden received <measure value="40l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40">40</num></measure>, and which was afterwards eclipsed by the glories of its successor, the following interesting anecdote is told:--
<p> <QUOTE>Mr. St. John, afterwards Lord Bolingbroke, happening to pay a morning visit to Dryden, whom he always respected, found him in an unusual agitation of spirits, even to a trembling. On inquiring the cause,  <Q>I have been up all night,</Q>  replied the old bard.  <Q>My musical friends made me promise to write them an ode for their feast of St. Cecilia. I have been so struck with the subject which occurred to me, that I could not leave it till I had completed it.

<p>To the west of the hall is the handsome courtroom, where the meetings of the Company are held.

<p>The <num value="9">nine</num> painted storeys which stood in the old hall, above the wainscot in the council parlour, probably crackled to dust in the Great Fire, which also rolled up and took away the portraits of John Cawood, printer to Philip and Mary, and his master, John Raynes.

<p>The Company's. curious collection of plate is carefully described by Mr. Nichols.

In the early Civil War, when the Company had to pledge their plate to meet the heavy loans exacted by Charles the Martyr from a good many of his unfortunate subjects, the cherished Owlett was specially excepted. Among other memorials in the possession of the Company was a silver college cup bought in memory of Mr. John Sweeting, who, dying in <datestruct value="1659--"><year reg="1659">1659</year></datestruct> (the year before the Restoration), founded by will the pleasant annual venison dinner of the Company in August.
<p>It is supposed that all the great cupboards of plate were lost in the fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, for there is no piece now existing (says Mr. Nichols) of an earlier date than <datestruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>. It has been the custom also from time to time to melt down obsolete plate, into newer forms and more useful vessels. Thus salvers and salt-cellars were in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>-<num value="21">21</num> turned into monteaths, or bowls, filled with water, to keep the wine-glasses cool; and in <datestruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct> a handsome rosewater dish was made out of a silver bowl, and an old tea-urn and coffee-urn. This custom is rather too much like Saturn devouring his own children, and has led to the destruction of many curious old relics. The massive old plate now remaining is chiefly of the reign of Charles II. High among these presents tower the quaint silver candlesticks bequeathed by Mr. Richard Royston, twice Master of the Stationers' Company, who died in <datestruct value="1686--"><year reg="1686">1686</year></datestruct>, and had been bookseller to <num value="3">three</num> kings-James I., Charles I., and Charles II. The ponderous snuffers and snuffer-box are gone. There were also <num value="3">three</num> other pairs, of candlesticks, given by Mr. Nathanael Cole, who had been clerk of the Company, at his death in <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>. A small <num value="2">two</num>-handled cup was bequeathed in <datestruct value="1771--"><year reg="1771">1771</year></datestruct> by that worthy old printer, William Bowyer, as a memorial of the Company's munificence to his father after his loss by fire in <datestruct value="1712--"><year reg="1712">1712</year></datestruct>-<num value="13">13</num>.
<p>The Stationers are very charitable. Their funds spring chiefly from <num value="1150">1,150</num> bequeathed to them by Mr. John Norton, the printer to the learned Queen Elizabeth in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, alderman of London in the reign of James I., and thrice Master of this Company. The money laid out by Norton's wish in the purchase of estates in fee-simple in Wood Street has grown and grown. <measure value="150l." type=currency><num value="150">One hundred and fifty</num> pounds</measure> out of this bequest the old printer left to the minister and churchwardens of St. Faith, in order to have distributed weekly to <num value="12">twelve</num> poor persons-<num value="6">six</num> appointed by the parish, and <num value="6">six</num> by the Stationers' Companytwopence each and a penny loaf, the vantage loaf  (the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> allowed by the baker) to be the clerk's; <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure> to be paid for an annual sermon on Ash Wednesday at St. Faith's; the residue to be laid out in cakes, wine, and ale for the Company of Stationers, either before or after the sermon. The liverymen still (according to Mr. Nichols) enjoy this annual dole of well-spiced and substantial buns. The sum of <num value="1000">1,000</num> was left for <pb id="p.233" n="233"> the generous purpose of advancing small loans to struggling young men in business. In <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>, however, the Company, under the direction of the, Court of Chancery, devoted the sum to the founding of a commercial school in Bolt Court for the sons of liverymen and freemen of the Company, and <measure value="8500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="8500">8,500</num></measure> were spent in purchasing Mr. Bensley's premises and Dr. Johnson's old house. The doctor's usual sitting-room is now occupied by the head master. The school itself is built on the site formerly occupied by Johnson's garden. The boys pay a quarterage not exceeding <measure value="2l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2">2</num></measure>. The school has <num value="4">four</num> exhibitions.
<p>The pictures at Stationers' Hall are worthy of mention. In the stock-room are portraits, after Kneller, of Prior and Steele, which formerly belonged to Harley, Earl of Oxford, Swift's great patron. The best picture in the room is a portrait by an unknown painter of Tycho Wing, the astronomer, holding a celestial globe. Tycho was the son of Vincent Wing, the <num value="1">first</num> author of the almanacks still published under his name, and who died in <datestruct value="1668--"><year reg="1668">1668</year></datestruct>. There are also portraits of that worthy old printer, Samuel Richardson and his wife; Archbishop Tillotson, by Kneller; Bishop Hoadley, prelate of the Order of the Garter; Robert Nelson, the author of the <title>Fasts and Festivals,</title> who died in <datestruct value="1714--"><year reg="1714">1714</year></datestruct>-<num value="15">15</num>, by Kneller; and <num value="1">one</num> of William Bowyer, the Whitefriars printer, with a posthumous bust beneath it of his son, the printer of the votes of the House of Commons. There was formerly a brass plate beneath this bust expressing the son's gratitude to the Company for their munificence to his father after the fire which destroyed his printing-office.
<p>In the court-room hangs a portrait of John Boydell, who was Lord Mayor of London in the year <datestruct value="1791"><year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>. This picture, by Graham, was formerly surrounded by allegorical figures of Justice, Prudence, Industry, and Commerce; but they have been cut out to reduce the canvas to Kit-cat size. There is a portrait, by Owen, of Lord Mayor Domville, Master of the Stationers' Company, in the actual robe he wore when he rode before the Prince Regent and the Allies in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct> to the Guildhall banquet and the Peace thanksgiving. In the card-room is an early picture, by West, of King Alfred dividing his loaf with the pilgrima representation, by the way, of a purely imaginary, occurrence--in fact, the old legend is that it was really St. Cuthbert who executed this generous partition. There are also portraits of the <num value="2">two</num> Strahans, Masters in <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>; <num value="1">one</num> of Alderman Cadell, Master in <datestruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>, by Sir William Beechey; and <num value="1">one</num> of John Nicholls, Master of the Company in <datestruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct>, after a portrait by Jackson. In the hall, over the gallery, is a picture, by Graham, of Mary Queen of Scots escaping from the Castle of Lochleven. It was engraved by Dawe, afterwards a Royal Academician, when he was only <num value="14">fourteen</num> years of age.
<p>The arms of the Company appear from a Herald visitation of <datestruct value="1634--"><year reg="1634">1634</year></datestruct> to have been azure on a chevron, an eagle volant, with a diadem between <num value="2">two</num> red roses, with leaves vert, between <num value="3">three</num> books clasped gold; in chief, issuing out of a cloud, the sunbeams gold, a holy spirit, the wings displayed silver, with a diadem gold. In later times the books have been blazoned as Bibles. In a <QUOTE>tricking</QUOTE> in the volume before mentioned, in the College of Arms, St. John the Evangelist stands behind the shield in the attitude of benediction, and bearing in his left hand a cross with a serpent rising from it (much more suitable for the scriveners or law writers, by the bye). On <num value="1">one</num> side of the shield stands the Evangelist's emblematic eagle, holding an inkhorn in his beak. The Company never received any grant of arms or supporters, but about the year <datestruct value="1790"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct> <num value="2">two</num> angels seem to have been used as supporters. About <datestruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct> the motto <QUOTE lang=la>Verbum Domini manet in eternum</QUOTE> (The word of the Lord endureth for ever) began to be adopted, and in the same year the crest of an eagle was used. On the silver badge of the Company's porter the supporters are naked winged boys, and the eagle on the chevron is turned into a dove holding an olivebranch. Some of the buildings of the present hall are still let to Paternoster Row booksellers as warehouses.
<p>The list of masters of this Company includes Sir John Key, Bart. ( <QUOTE>Don Key</QUOTE> ), Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>-<datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>.

<p>This is the <num value="1">first</num> of the many City companies of which we shall have by turns to make mention in the course of this work. Though no longer useful as a guild to protect a trade which now needs no fostering, we have seen that it still retains some of its mediaeval virtues. It is hospitable and charitable as ever, if not so given to grand funeral services and ecclesiastical ceremonials. Its privileges have grown out of date and obsolete, but they harm no <num value="1">one</num> but authors, and to the wrongs of authors both Governments and. Parliaments have been from time immemorialsystematically indifferent. <pb id="p.234" n="234">

 <lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.234.1">Old St. Paul's, From A View By Hollar.</lemma></HEAD></FIGURE>

<P>Stooping under the flat iron bar that lies like a bone in the mouth of Ludgate Hill, we pass up the gentle ascent between shops hung with gold chains, brimming with wealth, or crowded with all the luxuries that civilisation has turned into necessities; and once past the impertinent black spire of St. Martin's, we come full-butt upon the great grey dome. The finest building in London, with the worst approach; the shrine of heroes; the model of grace; the <foreign lang=fr>chef-d'oeuvre</foreign> of a great genius, rises before us, and between its sable Corinthian pillars we have now to thread our way in search of the old legends of St. Paul's.
<P>The old associations rise around us as we pass across the paved area that surrounds Queen Anne's mean and sooty statue. From the times of the Saxons to the present day, London's chief sanctuary of religion has stood here above the river, a landmark to the ships of all nations that have floated on the welcoming waters of the Thames. That <pb id="p.235" n="235"> great dome, circled with its coronet of gold, is the <num value="1">first</num> object the pilgrim traveller sees, whether he approach by river or by land; the sparkle of that golden cross is seen from many a distant hill and plain.
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.235.1">St. Paul's</lemma> is the central object--the very palladium--of modern London.
<p>Camden, the Elizabethan historian, revived an old tradition that a Roman temple to Diana once stood where St. Paul's was afterwards built; and he asserts that in the reign of Edward III. an in. credible quantity of ox-skulls, stag-horns, and boars tusks, together with some sacrificial vessels, were exhumed on this site. Selden, a better Orientalisl than Celtic scholar (Charles I.), derived the name
<FIGURE id="Fig.235" n="2000.06.0086"><HEAD>Old St. Paul's.-The Interior, Looking East.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 of London from <num value="2">two</num> Welsh words, <QUOTE>Llan-den</QUOTE> church of Diana. Dugdale, to confirm these traditions, drags a legend out of an obscure monkish chronicle, to the effect that during the Diocletian persecution, in which St. Alban, a centurion, was martyred, the Romans demolished a church standing on the site of St. Paul's, and raised a temple to Diana on its ruins, while in Thorny Island, Westminster, St. Peter, in the like manner, gave way to Apollo. These myths are, however, more than doubtful.
<p>Sir Christopher Wren's excavations for the foundation of modern St. Paul's entirely refuted these confused stories, to which the learned and <pb id="p.236" n="236"> the credulous had paid too much deference. He dug down to the river-level, and found neither oxbone nor stag-horn. What he did, find, however, was curious. It was this:--<num value="1">1</num>. Below the mediaeval graves Saxon.stone coffins and Saxon tombs, lined with slabs of chalk. <num value="2">2</num>. Lower still, British graves, and in the earth around the ivory and box-wood skewers that had fastened the Saxons' woollen shrouds. <num value="3">3</num>. At the same level with the Saxon graves, and also deeper, Roman funeral urns. These were discovered as deep as eighteen feet. Roman lamps, tear vessels, and fragments of sacrificial vessels of Samian ware were met with chiefly towards the Cheapside corner of the churchyard.
<p>There had evidently been a Roman cemetery outside this Praetorian camp, and beyond the ancient walls of London, the wise nation, by the laws of the <num value="12">Twelve</num> Tables, forbidding the interment of the dead within the walls of a city. There may have been a British or a Saxon temple here; for the Church tried hard to conquer and consecrate places where idolatry had once triumphed. But the Temple of Diana was moonshine from the beginning, and moonshine it will ever remain. The antiquaries were, however, angry with Wren for the logical refutation of their belief.--Dr. Woodward (the <QUOTE>Martinus Scriblerus</QUOTE> of Pope and his set) was especially vehement at the slaying of his hobby, and produced a small brass votive image of Diana, that had been found between the Deanery and Blackfriars. Wren, who could be contemptuous, disdained a reply, and so the matter remained till <datestruct value="1830"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, when the discovery of a rude stone altar, with an image of Diana, under the foundation of the new Goldsmith's Hall, Noster Lane, Cheapside, revived the old dispute, yet did not help a whit to prove the existence of the supposed temple to the goddess of moonshine.
<p>The earliest authenticated church of St. Paul's was built and endowed by Ethelbert, King of East Kent, with the sanction of Sebert, King of the East Angles; and the <num value="1">first</num> bishop who preached within its walls was Mellitus, the companion of St. Augustine, the <num value="1">first</num> Christian missionary who visited the heathen Saxons. The visit of St. Paul to England in the time of Boadicea's war, and that of Joseph of Arimathea, are mere monkish legends. he Londoners, again became pagan, and, for <num value="38">thirty-eight</num> years there was no bishop at St. Paul's,. till a brother of St. Chad of Lichfield came and set his foot on the. images of Thor and Wodin. With the <num value="4">fourth</num> successor of Mellitus, Saint Erkenwald, wealth and splendour returned to St. Paul's. This zealous man worked miracles both before and after his death. He used to be driven about in a cart, and <num value="1">one</num> legend says that he often preached to the woodmen in the wild forests that lay to the north of London. On a certain day <num value="1">one</num> of the cart-wheels came off in a slough. The worthy confessor was in a dilemma. The congregation under the oaks might have waited for ever, but the <num value="1">one</num> wheel left was equal to the occasion, for it suddenly grew invested with special powers of balancing, and went on as steadily as a velocipede with the smiling saint. This was pretty well, but still'nothing to what happened after the good man's death.
<p>St. Erkenwald departed at last in the odour of sanctity at his sister's convent at Barking. Eager to get hold of so valuable a body, the Chertsey monks instantly made a dash for it, pursued by the equally eager clergy of St. Paul's, who were fully alive to the value of their dead bishop, whose shrine would become a money-box for pilgrim's offerings. The London priests, by a forced march, got <num value="1">first</num> to Barking and bore off the body; but the monks of Chertsey and the nuns of Barking followed, wringing their hands and loudly protesting against the theft. The river Lea, sympathising with their prayers, rose in a flood. There was no boat, no bridge, and a fight for the body seemed imminent. A pious man present, however, exhorted the monks to peace, and begged them to leave the matter to heavenly decision. The clergy of Sit. Paul's then broke forth into a litany. The Lea at once subsided, the cavalcade crossed at Stratford, the sun cast down its benediction, and the clergy passed on to St. Paul's with their holy spoil. From that time the shrine of Erkenwald became a source of wealth and power tob the cathedral.
<p>The Saxon kings, according to Dean Milman, were munificent to St. Paul's. The clergy claimed Tillingham, in Essex, as a grant from King Ethelbert, and that place still contributes to the maintenance of the cathedral. The charters of Athelstane are questionable, but the places mentioned in them certainly belonged to St. Paul's till the Ecclesiastical Commissioners broke in upon that wealth; and the charter of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.236.1">Canute</lemma>, still preserved, and no doubt authentic, ratifies the donations of his Saxon predecessors.
<p>William the Conqueror's Norman Bishop, of London was a good, peace-loving man, who interceded with: the stern monarch, and recovered the forfeited privileges of the.refractory Londoncitizens. For centuries-indeed, even, up to the end of Queen Mary's reign-the, mayor, aldermen, and crafts used to make an annual procession to St. Paul's, to visit the tomb of good Bishop William in the nave. In <datestruct value="1622--"><year reg="1622">1622</year></datestruct> the Lord Mayor, Edward <pb id="p.237" n="237"> Barkham, caused these quaint lines to be carved on the bishop's tomb:--

<p>Bishop Maurice set to work to erect a more splendid building, with a vast crypt, in which the valuable remains of St. Erkenwald were enshrined. William of Malmesbury ranked it among the great buildings of his time. <num value="1">One</num> of the last acts of the Conqueror was to give the stone of a Palatine tower (on the subsequent site of Blackfriars) for the building. The next bishop, De Balmeis, is said to have devoted the whole of his revenues for <num value="20">twenty</num> years to this pious work. Fierce Rufusno friend of monks-did little; but the milder monarch,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.237.3">Henry I.</lemma>, granted exemption of toll to all vessels, laden with stone for St. Paul's, that entered the Fleet.
<p>To enlarge the area of the church, King Henry gave part of the Palatine. Tower estate, which was turned into a churchyard and encircled with a wall, which ran along Carter Lane to Creed Lane, and was freed of buildings. The bishop, on his part, contributed to the service of the altar the rents of Paul's Wharf, and for a school gave the house of Durandus, at the corner of Bell Court. On the bishop's death, the Crown seized his wealth, and the bishop's boots were carried to the Exchequer full of gold and silver. St. Bernard, however, praises him, and says : <QUOTE>I was not wonderful that Master Gilbert should be a bishop; but that the Bishop of London should live like a poor man, that was magnificent.</QUOTE>
<p>In the reign of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.237.4">Stephen</lemma> a dreadful fire broke out and raged from London Bridge to St. Clement Danes. In this fire St. Paul's was partially destroyed. The Bishop, in his appeals for contributions to the church, pleaded that this was the only London church specially dedicated to St. Paul. The citizens of London were staunch advocates of King Stephen against the Empress Maud, and at their folkmote, held at the Cheapside end of St. Paul's, claimed the privilege of naming a monarch.
<p>In the reign of Henry II. St. Paul's was the scene of a strange incident connected with the quarrel between the King and that ambitious Churchman, the Primate Becket. Gilbert Foliot, the learned and austere Bishop of London, had sided with the King and provoked the bitter hatred of Becket. . During the celebration of mass a daring emissary of Becket had the boldness to thrust a roll, bearing the dreaded sentence of excommunication against Foliot? into the hands of the officiating priest, and at the same time to cry aloud- <QUOTE>Know all men that Gilbert, Bishop of London, is excommunicated by Thomas, Archbishop of Canterbury!</QUOTE> Foliot for a time defied the interdict, but at last bowed to his enemy's authority, and refrained from entering the Church of St. Paul's.
<p>The reign of Richard I. was an eventful <num value="1">one</num> to St. Paul's. In <datestruct value="1191--"><year reg="1191">1191</year></datestruct>, when Cceur de Lion was in Palestine, Prince John and all the bishops met in the nave of St. Paul's to arraign William de Longchamp, <num value="1">one</num> of the King's regents, of many acts of tyranny. In the reign of their absentee monarch the Londoners grew mutinous, and their leader, William Fitzosbert, or Longbeard, denounced their oppressors from Paul's Cross. These disturbances ended in the siege of Bow Church, where Fitzosbert had fortified himself, and by the burning alive of him and other ringleaders. It was at this period that Dean Radulph de Diceto, a monkish chronicler of learning, built the Deanery, <QUOTE>inhabited,</QUOTE> says Milman, <QUOTE>after him, by many men of letters ;</QUOTE> before the Reformation, by the admirable Colet; after the Reformation by Alexander Nowell, Donne, Sancroft (who rebuilt the mansion after the Great Fire), Stillingfleet, Tillotson, W. Sherlock, Butler, Secker, Newton, Van Mildert, Copleston, and Milman.
<p>St. Paul's was also the scene of <num value="1">one</num> of those great meetings of prelates, abbots; deans, priors, and barons that finally led to King John's concession of Magna Charta. On this solemn occasion---so <pb id="p.238" n="238"> important for the progress of England--the Primate Langton displayed the old charter of Henry I. to the chief barons, and made them sacredly pledge themselves to stand up for Magna Charta and the liberties of England.
<p><num value="1">One</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> acts of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.238.1">King Henry III.</lemma> was to hold a council in St. Paul's, and there publish the Great Charter. <num value="12">Twelve</num> years after, when a Papal Legate enthroned himself in St. Paul's, he was there openly resisted by Cantelupe, Bishop of Worcester.
<p>Papal power in this reign attained its greatest height in England. On the death of Bishop Roger, an opponent of these inroads, the King gave orders that out of the episcopal revenue <measure value="1500l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="1500">1,500</num></measure> poor should be feasted on the day of the conversion of St. Paul, and <num value="1500">1,500</num> lights offered in the church. The country was filled with Italian prelates. An Italian Archbishop of Canterbury, coming to St. Paul's, with a cuirass under his robes, to demand <num value="1">first</num>-fruits from the Bishop, found the doors closed in his face; and <num value="2">two</num> canons of the Papal party, endeavouring to install themselves at St. Paul's, were in <datestruct value="1259--"><year reg="1259">1259</year></datestruct> killed by the angry populace.
<p>In the reign of this weak king several folkmotes of the London citizens were held at Paul's Cross, in the churchyard. On <num value="1">one</num> occasion the king himself, and his brother, the King of Almayne, were present. All citizens, even to the age of <num value="12">twelve</num>, were sworn to allegiance, for a great outbreak for liberty was then imminent. The inventory of the goods of Bishop Richard de Gravesend, Bishop of London for <num value="25">twenty-five</num> years of this reign, is still preserved in the archives of St. Paul's. It is a roll <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> feet long. The value of the whole property was nearly <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure>, and this sum (says Milman) must be multiplied by about <num value="15">fifteen</num> to bring it to its present value.
<p>When the citizens of London justly ranged themselves on the side of Simon de Montfort, who stood up for their liberties, the great bell of St. Paul's was the tocsin that summoned the burghers to arms, especially on that memorable occasion when Queen Eleanor tried to escape by water from the Tower to Windsor, where her husband was, and the people who detested her tried to sink her barge as it passed London Bridge.
<p>In the equally troublous reign of Edward II. St. Paul's was again splashed with blood. The citizens, detesting the king's foreign favourites, rose against the Bishop of Exeter, Edward's regent in London. A letter from the queen, appealing to them, was affixed to the cross in Cheapside. The bishop demanded the City keys of the Lord Mayor, and the people sprang to arms, with cries of <QUOTE>Death to the queen's enemies!</QUOTE> They cut off the head of a servant of the De Spensers, burst open the gates of the Bishop of Exeter's palace  (Essex Street, Strand), and plundered, sacked, and destroyed everything. The bishop, at the time riding in the Islington fields, hearing the danger, dashed home, and made straight for sanctuary in St. Paul's. At the north door, however, the mob thickening, tore him from his horse, and, hurrying him into Cheapside, proclaimed him a traitor, and beheaded him there, with <num value="2">two</num> of his servants. They then dragged his body back to his palace, and flung the corpse into the river.
<p>In the inglorious close of the glorious reign of Edward III., Courtenay, Bishop of London, an inflexible prelate, did his best to induce some of the London rabble to plunder the Florentines, at that time the great bankers and money-lenders of the metropolis, by reading at Paul's Cross the interdict Gregory XI. had launched against them; but on this occasion the Lord Mayor, leading the principal Florentine merchants into the presence of the aged king, obtained the royal protection for them.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.238.2">Wycliffe</lemma> and his adherents (amongst whom figured
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.238.3">John of Gaunt</lemma>- <QUOTE>old John of Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster</QUOTE> --Chaucer's patron) soon brewed more trouble in St. Paul's for the proud bishop. The great reformer being summoned to an ecclesiastical council at St. Paul's, was accompanied by his friends, John of Gaunt and the Earl Marshal, Lord Percy. When in the lady chapel Percy demanded a soft seat for Wycliffe. The bishop said it was law and reason that a cited man should stand before the ordinary. Angry words ensued, and the Duke of Lancaster taunted Courtenay with his. pride. The bishop answered, <QUOTE>I trust not in man, but in God alone, who will give me boldness to speak the truth.</QUOTE> rumour was spread that John of Gaunt had threatened to drag the bishop out of the church by the hair, and that he had vowed to abolish the title of Lord Mayor. A tumult began. All through the City the billmen and bowmen gathered. The Savoy, John of Gaunt's palace, would have been burned but for the intercession of the bishop. A priest mistaken for Percy was murdered. The duke fled to Kensington, and joined the Princess of Wales.
<p>Richard II., that dissolute, rash, and unfortunate monarch, once only (alive) came to St. Paul's in great pomp, his robes hung with bells, and afterwaxds feasted at the house of his favourite, Sir Nicholas Brember, who was eventually put to death. <pb id="p.239" n="239"> The Lollards were now making way, and Archbishop Courtenay had a great barefooted procession to St. Paul's to hear a famous Carmelite preacher inveigh against the Wycliffe doctrines. A Lollard, indeed, had the courage to nail to the doors of St. Paul's <num value="12">twelve</num> articles of the new creed denouncing the mischievous celibacy of the clergy, transubstantiation, prayers for the dead, pilgrimages, and other mistaken and idolatrous usages. When Henry Bolingbroke (not yet crowned Henry IV.) came to St. Paul's to offer prayer for the dethronement of his ill-fated cousin, Richard, he paused at the north side of the altar to shed tears over the grave of his father, John of Gaunt, interred early that very year in the Cathedral. Not long after the shrunken body of the dead king, on its way to the Abbey, was exposed in St. Paul's, to prove to the populace that Richard was not still alive. Hardynge, in his chronicles (quoted by Milman), says that the usurping king and his nobles spread--some <num value="7">seven</num>, some ninecloths of gold on the bier of the murdered king.
<p>Bishop Braybroke, in the reign of Edward IV., was strenuous in denouncing ecclesiastical abuses. Edward III. himself had denounced the resort of mechanics to the refectory, the personal vices of the priests, and the pilfering of sacred vessels. He restored the communion-table, and insisted on daily alms-giving. But Braybroke also condemned worse abuses. He issued a prohibition at Paul's Cross against barbers shaving on Sundays; he forbade the buying and selling in the Cathedral, the flinging stones and shooting arrows at the pigeons and jackdaws nestling in the walls of the church, and the playing at ball, both within and without the church, a practice which led to the breaking of many beautiful and costly painted windows.
<p>But here we stop awhile in our history of St. Paul's, on the eve of the sanguinary wars of the Roses, to describe mediaeval St. Paul's, its structure, and internal government. Foremost among the relics were <num value="2">two</num> arms of St. Mellitus (miraculously enough, of quite different sizes). Behind the high altar-what Dean Milman justly calls <QUOTE>the pride, glory, and fountain of wealth</QUOTE> to St. Paul's--was the body of St. Erkenwald, covered with a shrine which <num value="3">three</num> London goldsmiths had spent a whole year in chiselling; and this shrine was covered with a grate of tinned iron. The very dust of the chapel floor, mingled with water, was said to work instantaneous cures. On the anniversary of St. Erkenwald the whole clergy of the diocese attended in procession in their copes. When King John of France was made captive at Poictiers, and paid his orisons at St. Paul's, he presented <num value="4">four</num> golden basins to the high altar, and <num value="22">twenty-two</num> nobles at the shrine of St. Erkenwald. Milman calculates that in <datestruct value="1344--"><year reg="1344">1344</year></datestruct> the oblation-box alone at St. Paul's produced an annual sum to the dean and chapter of <measure value="9000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="9000">9,000</num></measure>. Among other relics that were milch cows to the monks were a knife of our Lord, some hair of Mary Magdalen, blood of St. Paul, milk of the Virgin, the hand of St. John, pieces of the mischievous skull of Thomas &agrave; Becket, and the head and jaw of King Ethelbert. These were all preserved in jewelled cases. <num value="111">One hundred and eleven</num> anniversary masses were celebrated. The chantry chapels in the Cathedral were very numerous, and they were served by an army of idle and often dissolute mass priests. There was <num value="1">one</num> chantry in Pardon Churchyard, on the north side of St. Paul's, east of the bishop's chapel, where St. Thomas Becket's ancestors were buried. The grandest was <num value="1">one</num> near the nave, built by Bishop Kemp, to pray for himself and his royal master, Edward IV. Another was founded by Henry IV. for the souls of his father, John of Gaunt, and his mother, Blanche of Castile. A <num value="3">third</num> was built by Lord <hi rend=italics>Mayor</hi> Pulteney, who was buried in St. Lawrence Pulteney, so called from him. The revenues of these chantries were vast.
<p>But to return to our historical sequence. During the ruthless Wars of the Roses St. Paul's became the scene of many curious ceremonials, on which Shakespeare himself has touched, in his early historical plays. It was on a platform at the cathedral door that Roger Bolingbroke, the spurious necromancer who was supposed to have aided the ambitious designs of the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, was exhibited. The Duchess's penance for the same offence, according to Milman's opinion, commenced or closed near the cathedral, in that shameful journey when she was led through the streets wrapped in a sheet, and carrying a lighted taper in her hand. The duke, her husband, was eventually buried at St. Paul's, where his tomb became the haunt of needy men about town, whence the well-known proverb of <QUOTE>dining with Duke Humphrey.</QUOTE>
<p>Henry VI.'s <num value="1">first</num> peaceful visit to St. Paul's is quaintly sketched by that dull old poet, Lydgate, who describes <QUOTE>the bishops <foreign lang=la>in pontificalibus</foreign>, the Dean of Paules and canons, every <num value="1">one</num> who conveyed the king</QUOTE>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.240.1">King Henry</lemma>. <num value="6">Six</num> years later, after the battle of St. Albans, the Yorkists and Lancastrians met again at the altar of St. Paul's in feigned unity. The poorweak monarch was crowned, and had sceptre in hand, and his proud brilliant queen followed him in smiling converse with the Duke of York. Again the city poet broke into. rejoicing at the final peace :

<p>Alas for such reconciliations! <num value="4">Four</num> years later more blood had been shed, more battle-fields strewn with dead. The king was a captive, had disinherited his own son, and granted the succession to the Duke of York, whose right a Parliament had acknowledged. His proud queen was in the North rallying the scattered Lancastrians. York and Warwick, Henry's deadly enemies,

<p>Within a few months Wakefield was fought; Richard was slain, and the duke's head, adorned with a mocking paper crown, was sent, by the shewolf of a queen, to adorn the walls of York.
<p>The next year, however, fortune forsook Henry for ever, and St. Paul's welcomed Edward IV. and the redoubtable <QUOTE>king-maker,</QUOTE> who had won the crown for him at the battle of Mortimer's Cross; and no Lancastrian dared show his face on that triumphant day. <num value="10">Ten</num> years later
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.240.3">Warwick</lemma>, veering to the downfallen king, was slain at Barnet, and the body of the old warrior, and that of his brother, were exposed, barefaced, for <num value="3">three</num> days in St. Paul's, to the delight of all true Yorkists. Those were terrible times, and the generosity of the old chivalry seemed nowdespised and forgotten. The next month there was even a sadder sight, for the body of King Henry himself was displayed in the Cathedral. Broken-hearted, said the Yorkists, but the Lancastrian belief (favoured by Shakespeare) was that Richard Duke of Gloucester, the wicked <pb id="p.241" n="241"> Crookback, stabbed him with his own hand in the Tower, and it was said that blood poured from the body when it lay in the Cathedral. Again St. Paul's was profaned at the death of Edward IV., when Richard came to pay his ostentatious orisons in the Cathedral, while he was already planning the removal of the princes to the Tower. Always anxious to please the London citizens, it was to St. Paul's Cross that Richard sent Dr. Shaw to accuse Clarence of illegitimacy. At St. Paul's, too, according to Shakespeare, who in his historic plays often follows traditions now forgotten, or chronicles that have perished, the charges against Hastings were publicly read.
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.241.5">Jane Shore</LEMMA>, the mistress, and supposed accomplice of Hastings in bewitching Richard, did penance in St. Paul's. She was the wife of a London goldsmith, and had been mistress of Edward IV. Her beauty, as she walked downcast with shame, is said to have moved every heart to pity. On his accession, King Richard, nervously fingering his dagger, as was his wont to do according to the chronicles, rode to St. Paul's, and was received by procession, amid great congratulation and acclamation from the fickle people. Kemp, who was the Yorkist bishop during all these dreadful times, rebuilt St. Paul's Cross, which then became <num value="1">one</num> of the chief ornaments of London.
<p>Richard's crown was presently beaten into a hawthorn bush on Bosworth Field, and his defaced.

<p>The last ceremonial of the reign of Henry VII. that took place at St. Paul's was the ill-fated marriage of Prince Arthur (a mere boy, who died <num value="6">six</num> months after) with Katherine of Arragon. The whole church was hung with tapestry, and there was a huge scaffold, with seats round it, reaching from the west door to the choir. On this platform the ceremony was performed. All day, at several places in the city, and at the west door of the Cathedral, the conduits ran for the delighted people with red and white wine. The wedded children were lodged in the bishop's palace, and <num value="3">three</num> days later returned by water to Westminster. When Henry VII. died, his body lay in state in St. Paul's, and from thence it was taken to Windsor, to remain there till the beautiful chapel he had endowed at Westminster was ready for his reception. The Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's were among the trustees for the endowment he left, and the Cathedral still possesses the royal testament.
<p>A Venetian ambassador who was present has <pb id="p.242" n="242"> left a graphic description of <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest ceremonies (<datestruct value="1514--"><year reg="1514">1514</year></datestruct>) which Henry VIII. witnessed at St. Paul's. The Pope (Leo X.) had sent the young , and chivalrous king a sword and cap of maintenance, as a special mark of honour. The cap was of purple satin, covered with embroidery and pearls, and decked with ermine. The king rode from the bishop's palace to the cathedral on a beautiful black palfrey, the nobility walking before him in pairs. At the high altar the king donned the l cap, and was girt with the sword. The procession then made the entire circuit of the church. The king wore a gown of purple satin and gold in chequer, and a jewelled collar; his cap of purple velvet had <num value="2">two</num> jewelled rosettes, and his doublet was of gold brocade. The nobles wore massive chains of gold, and their chequered silk gowns were lined with sables, lynx-fur, and swansdown.
<p>In the same reign Richard Fitz James, the fanatical Bishop of London, persecuted the Lollards, and burned <num value="2">two</num> of the most obstinate at Smithfield. It is indeed, doubtful, even now, if Fitz James, in his hatred of the reformers, stopped short of murder. In <datestruct value="1514--"><year reg="1514">1514</year></datestruct>, Richard Hunn, a citizen who had disputed the jurisdiction of the obnoxious Ecclesiastical Court, was thrown into the Lollard's Tower (the bishop's prison, at the south-west corner of the Cathedral). A Wycliffe Bible had been found in his house; he was adjudged a heretic, and <num value="1">one</num> night this obstinate man was found hung in his cell. The clergy called it suicide, but the coroner brought in a verdict of wilful murder against the Bishop's Chancellor, the sumner, and the bell-ringer of the Cathedral. The king, however, pardoned them all on their paying <num value="1500">1,500</num> to Hunn's family. The bishop, still furious, burned Hunn's body <num value="16">sixteen</num> days after, as that of a heretic, in Smithfield. This fanatical bishop was the ceaseless persecutor of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.242.1">Dean Colet</lemma> that excellent and enlightened man, who founded St. Paul's School, and was the untiring friend of Erasmus, whom he accompanied on his memorable visit to Becket's shrine at Canterbury.
<p>In <datestruct value="1518--"><year reg="1518">1518</year></datestruct> Wolsey, proud and portly, appears upon the scene, coming to St. Paul's to sing mass and celebrate eternal peace between France, England, and Spain, and the betrothal of the beautiful Princess Mary to the Dauphin of France. The large chapel and the choir were hung with gold brocade, blazoned with the king's arms. Near the altar was the king's pew, formed of cloth of gold, and in front of it a small altar covered with silver-gilt images, with a gold cross in the centre. <num value="2">Two</num> low masses were said at this before the king, while high mass was being sung to the rest. On the opposite side of the altar, on a raised and canopied chair, sat Wolsey, further off stood the legate Campeggio. The <num value="12">twelve</num> bishops and <num value="6">six</num> abbots present all wore their jewelled mitres, while the king himself shone out in a tunic of purple velvet, <QUOTE>powdered</QUOTE> with pearls and rubies, sapphires and diamonds. His collar was studded with carbuncles as large as walnuts. A year later Charles V. was proclaimed emperor by the heralds at: St. Paul's. Wolsey gave the benediction, no doubt with full hope of the Pope's tiara.
<p>In <datestruct value="1521--"><year reg="1521">1521</year></datestruct>, but a little later, Wolsey, <QUOTE>Cardinal of St. Cecilia and Archbishop of York,</QUOTE> was welcomed by Dean Pace to St. Paul's. He had come to sit near Paul's Cross, to hear Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, by the, Pope's command, denounce <QUOTE>Martinus Eleutherius</QUOTE> and his accursed works, many of which were burned in the churchyard during the sermon, no doubt to the infinite alarm of all heretical booksellers in the neighbouring street. Wolsey had always an eye to the emperor's helping him to the papacy; and when Charles V. came to England to visit Henry, in <datestruct value="1522--"><year reg="1522">1522</year></datestruct>, Wolsey said mass, censed by more than <num value="20">twenty</num> obsequious prelates. It was Wolsey who <num value="1">first</num>, as papal legate, removed the convocation entirely from St. Paul's to Westminster, to be near his house at Whitehall. is ribald enemy, Skelton, then hiding from the cardinal's wrath in the Sanctuary at Westminster, wrote the following rough distich on the arbitrary removal:--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Gentle Paul, lay down thy sword,

<p>On the startling news of the battle of Pavia, when Francis I. was taken prisoner by his great rival of Spain, a huge bonfire illumined the west front of St. Paul's, and hogsheads of claret were broached at the Cathedral door, to celebrate the welcome tidings. On the Sunday after, the bluff king, the queen, and both houses of Parliament, attended a solemn <QUOTE>Te Deum</QUOTE> at the cathedral; while on St. Matthew's Day there was a great procession of all the religious orders in London, and Wolsey, with his obsequious bishops, performed service at the high altar. <num value="2">Two</num> years later Wolsey came again, to lament or rejoice over the sack of Rome by the Constable Bourbon, and the captivity of the Pope.
<p>Singularly enough, the fire lighted by Wolsey in St. Paul's Churchyard had failed to totally burn up Luther and, all his works; and on Shrove Tuesday, <datestruct value="1527--"><year reg="1527">1527</year></datestruct>, Wolsey made another attempt to reduce the new-formed Bible to ashes. In the great procession that came on this day to St. Paul's there <pb id="p.243" n="243"> were <num value="6">six</num> Lutherans in penitential dresses, carrying terribly symbolical fagots and huge lighted tapers. On a platform in the nave sat the portly and proud cardinal, supported by <num value="36">thirty-six</num> zealous bishops, abbots, and priests. At the foot of the great rood over the northern door the heretical tracts and Testaments were thrown into a fire.

Nor would this chapter, be complete if we did not mention a great civic procession at the close of the reign of Henry VIII. On Whit Sunday, <datestruct value="1546--"><year reg="1546">1546</year></datestruct>, the children of Paul's School, with parsons and vicars of every London church, in their copes, went from St. Paul's to St. Peter's, Cornhill,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.243.2">Bishop Bonner</lemma> bearing the sacrament under a canopy; and at the Cross, before the mayor, aldermen, and all the crafts, heralds proclaimed perpetual peace between England, France, and the Emperor. <num value="2">Two</num> months after, the exbishop of Rochester preached a sermon at Paul's Cross recanting his heresy, <num value="4">four</num> of his late fellowprisoners in Newgate having obstinately perished at the stake.
<p>In the reign of Edward VI. St. Paul's witnessed far different scenes. The year of the accession of the child-king, funeral service was read to the memory of Francis I., Latin dirges were chanted, and <num value="8">eight</num> mitred bishops sang a requiem to the monarch lately deceased. At the coronation, while the guilds were marshalled along Cheapside, and tapestries hung from every window, an acrobat descended by a cable from St. Paul's steeple to the anchor of a ship near the Deanery door. In November of the next year, at night, the crucifixes and images in St. Paul's were pulled down and removed, to the horror of the faithful, and all obits and chantreys were confiscated, and the vestments and altar cloths were sold. The early reformers were backed by greedy partisans. The Protector Somerset, who was desirous of building rapidly a sumptuous palace in the Strand, pulled down the chapel and charnel-house in the Pardon churchyard, and carted off the stones of St. Paul's cloister. When the good
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.243.3">Ridley</lemma> was installed Bishop of London, he would not enter the choir until the lights on the altar were extinguished. Very soon a table was substituted for the altar, and there was an attempt made to remove the organ. The altar, and chapel, and tombs (all but John of Gaunt's) were then ruthlessly destroyed.
<p>During the Lady Jane Grey rebellion, Ridley denounced Mary and Elizabeth as bastards. The accession of gloomy Queen Mary soon turned the tables. As the Queen passed to her coronation, a daring Dutchman stood on the cross of St. Paul's waving a long streamer, and shifting from foot to foot as he shook <num value="2">two</num> torches which he held over his head.
<p>But the citizens were Protestants at heart. At the <num value="1">first</num> sermon preached at St. Paul's Cross, Dr. Bourne, a rash Essex clergyman, prayed for the dead, praised Bonner, and denounced Ridley. The mob, inflamed to madness, shouted, <QUOTE>He preaches damnation! Pull him down! pull him down!</QUOTE> A dagger, thrown at the preacher, stuck quivering in a side-post of the pulpit. With difficulty <num value="2">two</num> good men dragged the rash zealot safely into St. Paul's School. For this riot several persons were sent to the Tower, and a priest and a barber had their ears nailed to the pillory at St. Paul's Cross. The crosses were raised again in St. Paul's, and the old ceremonies and superstitions revived. On St. Katherine's Day (in honour of the queen's mother's patron saint) there was a procession with lights, and the image of St. Katherine, round St. Paul's steeple, and the bells rang. Yet not long after this, when a Dr. Pendleton preached old doctrines at St. Paul's Cross, a gun was fired at him. When Bonner was released from the Marshalsea and <pb id="p.244" n="244"> restored to his see, the people shouted, <QUOTE>Welcome home;</QUOTE> and a woman ran forward and kissed him. We are told that he knelt in prayer on the Cathedral steps.
<p>In <datestruct value="1554--"><year reg="1554">1554</year></datestruct>, at the reception in St. Paul's of Cardinal Pole, King Philip attended with English, Spanish, and German guards, and a great retinue of nobles. Bishop Gardiner preached on the widening heresy till the audience groaned and wept. Of the cruel persecutions of the Protestants in this reign St. Paul's was now and then a witness, and likewise of the preparations for the execution of Protestants, which Bonner's party called <QUOTE>trials.</QUOTE> Thus we find Master Cardmaker, vicar of St. Bride's, and Warne, an upholsterer in Walbrook, both arraigned at St. Paul's before the bishop for heresy, and carried back from there to Newgate, to be shortly after burned alive in Smithfield.
<p>In the midst of these horrors, a strange ceremony took place at St. Paul's, more worthy, indeed, of the supposititious temple of Diana than of a Christian cathedral, did it not remind us that Popery was always strangely intermingled with fragments of old paganism. In <datestruct VALUE="1557-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1557">1557</year></datestruct> (St. Paul's Day, says Machyn, an undertaker and chronicler of Mary's reign), a fat buck was presented to the dean and chapter, according to an annual grant made by Sir Walter le Baud, an Essex knight, in the reign of Edward I. A priest from each London parish attended in his cope, and the Bishop of London wore his mitre, while behind the burly, bullying, persecutor Bonner came a fat buck, his head with his horns borne upon a pole; <num value="40">forty</num> huntsmen's horns blowing a rejoicing chorus.
<p>The last event of this blood-stained reign was the celebration at St. Paul's of the victory over the French at the battle of St. Quintin by Philip and the Spaniards. A sermon was preached to the city at Paul's Cross, bells were rung, and bonfires blazed in every street.
<p>At Elizabeth's accession its new mistress soon purged St. Paul's of all its images: copes and shaven crowns disappeared. The <num value="1">first</num> ceremony of the new reign was the performance of the obsequies of Henry II. of France. The empty hearse was hung with cloth of gold, the choir draped in black, the clergy appearing in plain black gowns and caps. And now, what the Catholics called a great judgment fell on the old Cathedral. During a great storm in <datestruct value="1561--"><year reg="1561">1561</year></datestruct>, St. Martin's Church, Ludgate, was struck by lightning; immediately after, the wooden steeple of St. Paul's started into a flame. The fire burned downwards furiously for <num value="4">four</num> hours, the bells melted, the lead poured in torrents; the roof fell in, and the whole Cathedral became for--a time a ruin. Soon after, at the Cross, Dean Nowell rebuked the Papists for crying out <QUOTE>a judgment.</QUOTE> In papal times the church had also suffered. In Richard I.'s reign an earthquake shook down the spire, and in Stephen's time fire had also brought destruction. The Crown and City were roused by this misfortune. Thrifty Elizabeth gave <measure value="1000bmark" type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num> marks</measure> in gold, and <measure value="1000bmark" type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num> marks</measure>&lsquo; worth of timber; the City gave a great benevolence, and the clergy subscribed <measure value="11410l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="11410">11,410</num></measure>. In <num value="1">one</num> month a false roof was erected, and by the end of the year the aisles were leaded in. On the ist of November, the same year, the mayor, aldermen, and crafts, with <num value="80">eighty</num> torchbearers, went to attend service at St. Paul's. The steeple, however, was never re-erected, in spite of Queen Elizabeth's angry remonstrances.
<p>In the <num value="1">first</num> year of Philip and Mary, the Common Council of London passed an act which shows the degradation into which St. Paul's had sunk even before the fire. It forbade the carrying of beercasks, or baskets of bread, fish, flesh, or fruit, or leading mules or horses through the Cathedral, under pain of fines and imprisonment. Elizabeth also issued a proclamation to a similar effect, forbidding a fray, drawing of swords in the church, or shooting with hand-gun or dagg within the church or churchyard, under pain of <num value="2">two</num> months' imprisonment. Neither were agreements to be made for the payment of money within the church. Soon after the fire, a man that had provoked a fray in the church was set in the pillory in the churchyard, and had his ears nailed to a post, and then cut off. These proclamations, however, led to no reform. Cheats, gulls, assassins, and thieves thronged the middle aisle of St. Paul's; advertisements of all kinds covered the walls, the worst class of servants came there to be hired; worthless rascals and disreputable flaunting women met there by appointment. Parasites, hunting for a dinner, hung about a monument of the Beauchamps, foolishly believed to be the tomb of the good Duke Humphrey. Shakespeare makes Falstaff hire red-nosed Bardolph in St. Paul's, and Ben Jonson lays the <num value="3">third</num> act of his <title>Every Man in his Humour</title> in the middle aisle. Bishop Earle, in his <QUOTE>Microcosmography,</QUOTE> describes the noise of the crowd of idlers in Paul's <QUOTE>as that of bees, a strange hum mixed of walking tongues and feet, a kind of still roar or loud whisper.</QUOTE> He describes the crowd of young curates, copper captains, thieves, and dinnerless adventurers and gossip-mongers.

<p>On the eve of the election of Sandys as Bishop of London, <datestruct VALUE="1570-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1570">1570</year></datestruct>, all London was roused by a papal bull against Elizabeth being found nailed on the gates of the bishop's palace. It declared her crown forfeited and her people absolved from their oaths of allegiance. The fanatic maniac, Felton, was soon discovered, and hung on a gallows at the bishop's gates.

<P><num value="1">One</num> or <num value="2">two</num> anecdotes of interest specially connect Elizabeth with St. Paul's. On <num value="1">one</num> occasion Dean Nowell placed. in--the queen's closet  (pew) a splendid prayer-book, full of German scriptural engravings, richly illuminated. The zealous queen was furious; the book seemed to her of Catholic tendencies.
<p> <QUOTE>Who placed this book on my cushion You know I have an aversion to idolatry. The cuts resemble angels and saints-nay, even grosser absurdities.</QUOTE>
<p>The frightened dean pleaded innocence of all evil intentions. The queen prayed God to grant him more wisdom for the future, and asked him where they came from. When told Germany, she replied, <QUOTE>It is well it was a stranger. Had it been <num value="1">one</num> of my subjects, we should have questioned the matter.</QUOTE>
<p>Once again Dean Nowell vexed the queen-this time from being too Puritan. On Ash Wednesday, <datestruct value="1572--"><year reg="1572">1572</year></datestruct>, the dean preaching before her, he denounced certain popish superstitions in a book recently dedicated to her majesty. He specially denounced the use of the sign of the cross. Suddenly a harsh voice was heard in the royal closet. It was Elizabeth's. She chidingly bade Mr. Dean return from his ungodly digression and revert to his text. The next day the frightened dean wrote a most abject apology to the high-spirited queen.

When the thanksgiving sermon was preached at Paul's Cross, <num value="11">eleven</num> Spanish ensigns waved over the cathedral battlements, and <num value="1">one</num> idolatrous streamer with an image of the Virgin fluttered over the preacher.

<p>The <QUOTE>children of Paul's,</QUOTE> whom Shakespeare, in

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.245.3">lotteries</lemma> for Government purposes were held at the west door of St. Paul's, where a wooden shed was erected for drawing the prizes, which were <num value="1">first</num> plate and then suits of armour. n the <num value="1">first</num> lottery (<datestruct value="1569--"><year reg="1569">1569</year></datestruct>) there were <num value="40000">40,000</num> lots at <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> a lot, and the profits were applied to repairing the harbours of England.
<p>In the reign of James I. blood was again shed before St. Paul's. Years before a bishop had been murdered at the north door; now, before the west entrance (in <datestruct VALUE="1605-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1605">1605</year></datestruct>-<num value="6">6</num>), <num value="4">four</num> of the desperate Gunpowder Plot conspirators (Sir Everard Digby, Winter, Grant, and Bates) were there hung, drawn, and quartered. Their attempt to restore the old religion by <num value="1">one</num> blow ended in the hangman's strangling rope and the executioner's cruel knife. In the May following a man of less-proven guilt (Garnet, the Jesuit) suffered the same fate in St. Paul's Churchyard; and zealots of his faith affirmed that on straws saved from the scaffold miraculous portraits of their martyr were discovered.
<p>The ruinous state of the great cathedral, still without a tower, now aroused the theological king. He <num value="1">first</num> tried to saddle the bishop and chapter, but Lord Southampton, Shakespeare's friend, interposed to save them. Then the matter went to sleep for <num value="12">twelve</num> years. In <datestruct value="1620--"><year reg="1620">1620</year></datestruct> the king again awoke, and came in state with all his lords on horseback, to hear a sermon at the Cross and to view the church. A royal commission followed, Inigo Jones, the king's <hi rend=italics>protege</hi>, whom James had brought from Denmark, being <num value="1">one</num> of the commissioners. The sum required was estimated at <num value="22536">22,536</num>. The king's zeal ended here; and his favourite, Buckingham, borrowed the stone collected for St. Paul's for his Strand palace, and from parts of it was raised that fine water-gate still existing in the Thames Embankment gardens.
<p>When Charles I. made that narrow-minded churchman, Laud, Bishop of London, <num value="1">one</num> of Laud's <num value="1">first</num> endeavours was to restore St. Paul's. Charles I. was a man of taste, and patronised painting and architecture. Inigo Jones was already building the Banqueting House at Whitehall. The king was so pleased with
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.245.4">Inigo's design for the new portico of St. Paul's</lemma> that he proposed to pay for that himself. Laud gave &pound;,<num value="1200">1,200</num>. The fines of the obnoxious and illegal High Commission Court were set apart for the same object. The small sheds and houses round the west front were ruthlessly cleared away. All shops in Cheapside and Lombard Street, except goldsmiths, were to be shut up, that the eastern approach to St. Paul's <pb id="p.246" n="246"> might appear more splendid. The church of St. Gregory, at the south-west wing of the cathedral, was removed and rebuilt. Inigo Jones cut away all the decayed stone and crumbling Gothic work of the Cathedral, and on the west portico expended all the knowledge he had acquired in his visit to Rome. The result was a pagan composite, beautiful but incongruous. The front, <num value="161">161</num> feet long and <num value="162">162</num> feet high, was supported by <num value="14">fourteen</num> Corinthian columns. On the parapet above the pillars Inigo proposed that there should stand <num value="10">ten</num> statues of princely benefactors of St. Paul's. At each angle of the west front there was a tower. The portico was intended for a Paul's Walk, to drain off the profanation from within.
<p>Nor were the London citizens backward. <num value="1">One</num> most large-hearted man,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.246.1">Sir Paul Pindar</lemma>, a Turkey merchant who had been ambassador at Constantinople, and whose house is still to be seen in Bishopsgate Street, contributed <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> towards the screen and south transept. The statues of James and Charles were set up over the portico, and the steeple was begun, when the storm arose that soon whistled off the king's unlucky head. The coming troubles cast shadows around St. Paul's. In March,

<p>The Parliament made short work with St. Paul's, of Laud's projects, and Inigo Jones's classicalisms.

There was a story current that Cromwell intended to sell St. Paul's to the Jews for a synagogue.

<p>When the Restoration came, sunshine again fell upon the ruins. Wren, that great genius, was called in. His report was not very favourable. The pillars were giving way; the whole work had been from the beginning ill designed and ill built; the tower was leaning. He proposed to have a rotunda, with cupola and lantern, to give the church light, and incomparable more grace <QUOTE>than the lean shaft of a steeple could possibly afford.

On Sunday, <datestruct value="09-2"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=2>2</day></datestruct>, the Great Fire drew a red cancelling line over Wren's half-drawn plans. The
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.248.6">old cathedral</LEMMA>
passed away, like Elijah, in flames. The fire broke out about <num value="10">ten</num> o'clock on Saturday night at a bakehouse in Pudding Lane, near East Smithfield. Sunday afternoon Pepys found all the goods carried that morning to Cannon Street now removing to Lombard Street. At St. Paul's Wharf he takes water, follows the king's party, and lands at Bankside. <QUOTE>In corners and upon steeples, and between churches and houses, as far as we could see up the city, a most horrid, bloody, malicious flame, not like the flame of an ordinary fire.</QUOTE> On the <num value="7">7th</num>, he saw St. Paul's Church with all the roof off, and the body of the quire fallen into St. Faith's.
<p>On Monday, the <num value="3">3rd</num>, Mr. Evelyn describes the whole north of the City on fire, the sky light for <num value="10">ten</num> miles round, and the scaffolds round St. Paul's catching. On the <num value="4">4th</num> he saw the stones of St. Paul's flying like grenades, the melting lead running in streams down the streets, the very pavements too hot for the feet, and the approaches too blocked for any help to be applied. A Westminster boy named Taswell (quoted by Dean Milman from <title>Camden's Miscellany,</title> vol. ii., p. <num value="12">12</num>) has also sketched the scene. On Monday, the <num value="3">3rd</num>, from Westminster he saw, about <num value="8">eight</num> o'clock, the fire burst forth, and before <num value="9">nine</num> he could read by the blaze a <num value="16">16</num>mo <title>Terence</title> which he had with him. The boy at once set out for St. Paul's, resting by the way upon Fleet Bridge, being almost faint with the intense heat of the air. The bells were melting, and vast avalanches of stones were pouring from the walls. Near the east end he found the body of an old woman, who had cowered there, burned to a coal. Taswell also relates that the ashes of the books kept in St. Faith's, were blown as far as Eton.
<p>On the <num value="7">7th</num> (Friday) Evelyn again visited St. Paul's. The portico he found rent in pieces, the vast stones split asunder, and nothing remaining entire but the inscription on the architrave, not <num value="1">one</num> letter of which was injured. <num value="6">Six</num> acres of lead on the roof were all melted. The roof of St. Faith's had fallen in, and all the magazines and books from Paternoster Row were consumed, burning for a week together. Singularly enough, the lead over the altar at the east end was untouched, and among the monuments the body of <num value="1">one</num> bishop (Braybroke-Richard II.) remained entire. The old tombs nearly all perished; amongst them those of <num value="2">two</num> Saxon kings, John of Gaunt, his wife Constance of Castile, poor St. Erkenwald, and scores of bishops, good and bad; Sir Nicholas Bacon, Elizabeth's Lord Keeper, and father of the great philosopher; the last of the true knights, the gallant Sir Philip Sidney; and Walsingham, that astute counsellor of Elizabeth. Then there was Sir Christopher Hatton, the dancing chancellor, whose proud monument crowded back Walsingham and Sidney's. According to the old scoffing distich,
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Philip and Francis they have no tomb,
<L>For great Christopher takes all the room.</QUOTE>
Men of letters in old St. Paul's (says Dean Milman) there were few. The chief were Lily, the grammarian, <num value="2">second</num> master of St. Paul's; and Linacre, the physician, the friend of Colet and Erasmus. Of artists there was at least <num value="1">one</num> great man- Vandyck, who was buried near John of Gaunt. mong citizens, the chief was Sir William Hewet, whose daughter married Osborne, an apprentice, who saved her from drowning, and who was the ancestor of the Dukes of Leeds.
<p>After the fire, Bishop Sancroft preached in a patched--up part of the west end of the ruins. All hopes of restoration were soon abandoned, as Wren had, with his instinctive genius, at once predicted. Sancroft at once wrote to the great architect, <QUOTE>What you last whispered in my ear is now come to pass. A pillar has fallen, and the rest threatens to follow.</QUOTE> The letter concludes thus: <QUOTE>You are so absolutely necessary to us, that we can do nothing, resolve on nothing, without you.</QUOTE> There was plenty of zeal in London still; but, nevertheless, after all, nothing was done to the rebuilding till the year <datestruct value="1673"><year reg="1673">1673</year></datestruct>.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.249.12">Charles II.</lemma>, generous as usual in promises, offered an annual contribution of <num value="1000">1,000</num>; but this, however, never seems to have been paid. It, no doubt, went to pay Nell Gwynne's losses at the gambling-table, or to feed the Duchess of Portsmouth's lap-dogs. Some <measure value="1700l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1700">1,700</num></measure> in fines, however, were set apart for the new building. The Primate Sheldon gave <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure>. Many of the bishops contributed largely, and there were parochial collections all over England. But the bulk of the money was obtained from the City duty on coals, which (as Dean Milman remarks) in time had their revenge in destroying the stonework of the Cathedral. It was only by a fortunate accident that Wren became the builder; for
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.249.15">Charles II.</LEMMA>, whose tastes and vices were all French, had in vain invited over Perrault, the designer of <num value="1">one</num> of the fronts of the Louvre.
<P>The
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.249.13">great architect, Wren</lemma>, was the son of a Dean of Windsor, and nephew of a Bishop of Norwich whom Cromwell had imprisoned for his Romish tendencies. From a boy Wren had shown a genius for scientific discovery. He distinguished himself in almost every branch of knowledge, and to his fruitful brain we are indebted for some fiftytwo suggestive discoveries. He now hoped to rebuild London on a magnificent scale; but it was not to be. Even in the plans for the new cathedral Wren was from the beginning thwarted and impeded. Ignorance, envy, jealousy, and selfishness met him at every line he drew. He made <num value="2">two</num> designs--the <num value="1">first</num>
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.249.16">a Greek</LEMMA>, the <num value="2">second</num> a Latin cross. The Greek cross the clergy considered as unsuitable for a cathedral. The model for it was long preserved in the Trophy Room of St. Paul's, where, either from neglect or the zeal of relic-hunters, the western portico was lost. It is now at South Kensington, and is still imperfect. The interior of the <num value="1">first</num> design is by many considered superior to the present interior. The present recesses along the aisles of the nave, tradition says, were insisted on by James II., who thought they would be useful as side chapels when masses were once more introduced.
<P>The <num value="1">first</num> stone was laid by Wren on the <datestruct VALUE="1675-06-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, but there was no public ceremonial. Soon after the great geometrician had drawn the circle for the beautiful dome, he sent a workman for a stone to mark the exact centre. The man returned with a fragment of a tombstone, on which was the <num value="1">one</num> ominous word (as every <num value="1">one</num> observed)
<QUOTE lang=la>Resurgam!</QUOTE> The ruins of old St. Paul's were stubborn. In trying to blow up the tower, a passer-by was killed, and Wren, with his usual ingenuity, resorted successfully to the old Roman battering-ram, which soon cleared a way. <QUOTE>I build for eternity,</QUOTE> said Wren, with the true confidence of genius, as he searched for a firm foundation. Below the Norman, Saxon, and Roman graves he dug and probed till he could find the most reliable stratum. Below the loam was sand;. under the sand a layer of fresh-water shells; under these were sand, gravel, and London clay. At the north-east corner of the dome Wren was vexed by coming upon a pit dug by the Roman potters in search of clay. He, however, began from the solid earth a--strong pier of masonry, and above turned a short arch to the former foundation. He also slanted the new building more to the north-east than its predecessor, in order to widen the street south of St. Paul's.
<P>Well begun is half done. The Cathedral grew fast, and in <num value="2">two</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num> years from the laying of the <num value="1">first</num> stone the choir was opened for Divine service. The master mason who helped to lay the <num value="1">first</num> stone assisted in fixing the last in the lantern. A great day was chosen for the opening of St. Paul's. <datestruct VALUE="1697-12-2"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=2>2nd</day>, <year reg=1697>1697</year></datestruct>, was the thanksgiving day for the Peace of Ryswick--the treaty which humbled France, and seated William firmly and permanently on the English throne. The king, much against his will, was persuaded to stay at home by his courtiers, who dreaded armed Jacobites among the <num value="300000">300,000</num> people who would throng the streets. Worthy Bishop Compton, who, dressed as a trooper, had guarded the Princess Anne in her flight from her father, preached that inspiring day on the text, <QUOTE>I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord.</QUOTE> From then till now the daily voice of prayer and praise has never ceased in St. Paul's. <pb id="p.250" n="250">

The <num value="1">first</num> of these (<datestruct value="1702--"><year reg="1702">1702</year></datestruct>) was a jubilee for Marlborough's triumph in the Low Countries, and Rooke's destruction of the Spanish fleet at Vigo. The Queen sat on a raised and canopied throne; the Duke of Marlborough, as Groom of the Stole, on a stool behind her. The Lords and Commons, who had arrived in procession, were arranged in the choir. The brave old Whig Bishop of Exeter, Sir Jonathan Trelawney ( <QUOTE>and shall Trelawney die?</QUOTE> ), preached the sermon. Guns at the Tower, on the river, and in St. James's Park, fired off the Te Deum, and when the Queen started and returned. In <datestruct value="1704--"><year reg="1704">1704</year></datestruct>, the victory of Blenheim was celebrated; in <datestruct value="1705--"><year reg="1705">1705</year></datestruct>, the forcing of the French lines at Tirlemont; in <datestruct value="1706--"><year reg="1706">1706</year></datestruct>, the battle of Ramillies and Lord Peterborough's successes in Spain; in <datestruct value="1707--"><year reg="1707">1707</year></datestruct>, more triumphs; in <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, the battle of Oudenarde; and last of all, in <datestruct value="1713--"><year reg="1713">1713</year></datestruct>, the Peace of Utrecht, when the Queen was unable to attend. On this last day the charity children of London (<num value="4000">4,000</num> in number) <num value="1">first</num> attended outside the church.
<p>St. Paul's was already, to all intents and purposes, completed.
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.250.2">The dome</lemma> was ringed with its golden gallery, and crowned with its glittering cross. In <datestruct value="1710--"><year reg="1710">1710</year></datestruct>, Wren's son and the body of Freemasons had laid the highest stone of the lantern of the cupola, and now commenced the bitterest mortifications of Wren's life. The commissioners had dwindled down to Dean Godolphin and <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num>, civilians from Doctors' Commons. Wren's old friends were dead. His foes compelled him to pile the organ on the screen, though he had intended it to be under the north-east arch of the choir, where it now is. Wren wished to use mosaic for internal decoration; they pronounced it too costly, and they took the painting of the cupola out of Wren's hands and gave it to Hogarth's father-in-law,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.250.3">Sir James Thornhill</lemma>. They complained of wilful delay in the work, and accused Wren or his assistant of corruption; they also withheld part of his salary till the work was completed. Wren covered the cupola with lead, at a cost of <measure value="2500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2500">2,500</num></measure>; the committee were for copper, at <measure value="3050l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3050">3,050</num></measure>. About the iron railing for the churchyard there was also wrangling. Wren wished a low fence, to leave the vestibule and the steps free and open. The commissioners thought Wren's design mean and weak, and chose the present heavy and cumbrous iron-work, which breaks up the view of the west front.
<p>The new organ, by Father Bernard Smith, which cost <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure>, was shorn of its full size by Wren, perhaps in vexation at its misplacement. The paltry statue of Queen Anne, in the churchyard, was by Bird, and cost ,<num value="1300">130,0</num>, exclusive of the marble, which the Queen provided. The carvings in the choir, by Grinling Gibbons, cost <measure value="1337l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1337">1,337</num></measure> <measure value="7s. 5d." type=Currency><num value="7">7</num>s. <num value="5">5</num>d.</measure> On some of the exterior sculpture Cibber worked.
<p>In <datestruct value="1718--"><year reg="1718">1718</year></datestruct> a violent pamphlet appeared, written, it was supposed, by <num value="1">one</num> of the commissioners. It accused Wren's head workmen of pilfering timber and cracking the bells. Wren proved the charges to be malicious and untrue. The commissioners now insisted on adding a stone balustrade all round St. Paul's, in spite of Wren's protests. He condemned the addition as <QUOTE>contrary to the principles of architecture, and as breaking into the harmony of the whole design;</QUOTE> but, he said, <QUOTE>ladies think nothing well without an edging.</QUOTE>
<p>The next year, the commissioners went a step further. Wren, then <num value="86">eighty-six</num> years old, and in the <num value="49">forty-ninth</num> year of office, was dismissed without apology from his post of Surveyor of Public Works. The German Court, hostile to all who had served the Stuarts, appointed in his place a poor pretender, named Benson. This charlatannow only remembered by a line in the <title>Dunciad,</title>
which ridicules the singular vanity of a man who erected a monument to Milton, in Westminster Abbey, and crowded the marble with his own titles --was afterwards dismissed from his surveyorship with ignominy, but had yet influence enough at Court to escape prosecution and obtain several valuable sinecures. Wren retired to his house at Hampton Court, and there sought consolation in philosophical and religious studies. Once a year, says Horace Walpole, the good old man was carried to St. Paul's, to contemplate the glorious
<hi rend=italics>chef-d'aeuvre</hi> of his genius. Steele, in the <title>Tatler,</title>
refers to Wren s vexations, and attributes them to his modesty and bashfulness.
<p>The total sum expended on the building of St. Paul's Cathedral, according to Dean Milman, was <measure value="736752l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="736752">736,752</num></measure> <measure value="2s. 34d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="34">34</num>d.</measure>; a small residue from the coal duty was all that was left for future repairs. To this Dean Clark added about <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure>, part of the profits arising from an Essex estate (the gift of an old Saxon king), leased from the Dean and Chapter. The charge of the fabric was vested not in the Dean and Chapter, but in the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of London, and the Lord Mayor for the time being. These trustees elect the surveyor and audit the accounts.
<p>On the accession of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.250.4">George I.</lemma> (<datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct>), the new king, princes, and princesses went in state to St. Paul's. <num value="70">Seventy</num> years elapsed before an English king again entered Wren's cathedral. In April. <pb id="p.251" n="251"> <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>, George III. came to thank God for his temporary recovery from insanity. Queen Charlotte, the Prince of Wales, and the Duke of York were present, and both Houses of Parliament. Bishop Porteous preached the sermon, and <num value="6000">6,000</num> charity children joined in the service. In <datestruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>, King George came again to attend a thanksgiving for Lord Duncan's and
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.251.1">Lord Howe's</lemma> naval victories; French, Spanish, and Dutch flags waved above the procession, and
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.251.2">Sir Horatio Nelson</lemma> was there among other heroes.
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> grave sunk in St. Paul's was fittingly that of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.251.3">Wren</lemma> its builder. He lies in the place of honour, the extreme east of the crypt. The black marble slab is railed in, and the light from a small window-grating falls upon the venerated name.

<p>The clergy of St. Paul's were for a long time jealous of allowing any monument in the cathedral. Dean Newton wished for a tomb, but it was afterwards erected in St. Mary-le-Bow. A better man than the vain, place-hunting dean was the <num value="1">first</num> honoured. The earliest statue admitted was that of the benevolent Howard, who had mitigated suffering and sorrow in all the prisons of Europe; he stands at the corner of the dome facing that half-stripped athlete,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.251.4">Dr. Johnson</lemma> and the <num value="2">two</num> are generally taken by country visitors for St. Peter and St. Paul. He who with Goldsmith had wandered through the Abbey, wondering if <num value="1">one</num> day their names might not be recorded there, found a grave in Westminster, and, thanks to Reynolds, the <num value="1">first</num> place of honour. Sir Joshua himself, as <num value="1">one</num> of our greatest painters, took the <num value="3">third</num> place, that Hogarth should have occupied; and the <num value="4">fourth</num> was awarded to that great Oriental scholar, Sir William Jones. The clerical opposition was now broken through, for the world felt that the Abbey was full enough, and that St. Paul's required adorning.
<p>Henceforward St. Paul's was chiefly set apart for naval and military heroes whom the city could best appreciate, while the poets, great writers, and statesmen were honoured in the Abbey, and laid among the old historic dead. From the beginning our sculptors resorted to pagan emblems and pagan allegorical figures; the result is that St Paul's resembles a Pantheon of the Lower Empire and is a hospital of <num value="3">third</num>-rate art. The <num value="1">first</num> nava conqueror so honoured was
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.251.5">Rodney</lemma>; Rossi received <measure value="6000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6000">6,000</num></measure> for his cold and clumsy design: Lord Howe's statue followed; and next that of Lord Duncan, the hero of Camperdown. It is a simple statue by Westmacott, with a seaman and his wife and child on the pedestal. For Earl St. Vincent, Bailey produced a colossal statue and the usual scribbling, History and a trumpeting Victory.
<p>Then came Nelson's brothers in arms-men of lesser mark; but the nation was grateful, and the Government was anxious to justify its wars by its victories. St. Paul's was growing less particular, and now opened its arms to the best men it could get. Many of Nelson's captains preceded him on the red road to death-Westcott, who fell at Aboukir;
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.251.6">Mosse and Riou</lemma>, who fell before Copenhagen (a far from stainless victory). Riou was the brave man whom Campbell immortalised in his fiery <title>Battle of the Baltic.</title> Riou lies

<p>Then at last, in <datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, came a hero worthy, indeed, of such a cathedral--
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.251.8">Nelson himself</LEMMA>. At what a moment had Nelson expired!

The sarcophagus, singularly enough, had been designed by Michael Angelo's contemporary, Torreguiano, for Wolsey, in the days of his most insatiable pride, and had remained ever since in Wolsey's chapel at Windsor; Nelson's flag was to have been placed over the coffin, but as it was about to be lowered, the sailors who had borne it, as if by an irresistible impulse, stepped forward and tore it in pieces, for relics.

Nor has our proud and just nation disdained to honour even equally gallant men who were defeated. There are monuments in St. Paul's to the vanquished at Bergen-op-Zoom, New Orleans, and Baltimore.

The pall was borne by the general officers who had fought by the side of Wellington, and the cathedral was illuminated for the occasion. The service was read by Dean Milman, who had been, as we have before mentioned, a spectator of Nelson's funeral. So perfectly adapted for sound is St. Paul's, that though the walls were muffled with black cloth, the Dean's voice could be heard distinctly, even up in the western gallery.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.254.1">Service in St. Paul's</lemma></NOTE>

<p>Only <num value="1">one</num> robbery has occurred in modern times in St. Paul's. In <datestruct VALUE="1810-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, the plate repository of the cathedral was broken open by thieves, with the connivance of, as is supposed, some official, and <num value="1761">1,761</num> ounces of plate, valued at above <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure>, were stolen. The thieves broke open <num value="9">nine</num> doors to get at the treasure, which was never afterwards heard of. The spoil included the chased silver-gilt covers of the large (<datestruct value="1640--"><year reg="1640">1640</year></datestruct>) Bible, chalices, plates, tankards, and candlesticks.
<p>The cathedral, left colourless and blank by Wren, has never yet been finished. The Protestant choir remains in <num value="1">one</num> corner, like a dry, shrivelled nut in a large shell. Like the proud snail in the fable, that took possession ofthe lobster-shell and starved there, we remained for more than a century complacently content with our unfurnished house. t length our tardy zeal awoke. In <datestruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct> the Bishop of London wrote to the Dean and Chapter, urging a series of Sunday evening services, for the benefit of the floating masses of Londoners. Dean Milman replied, at once warming to the proposal, and suggested the decoration and completion of St. Paul's, The earnest appeal for <QUOTE>the noblest church, in its style, of Christian Europe, the masterpiece of Wren, the glory and pride of London,</QUOTE> was at once responded to. A committee of the leading merchants and bankers was formed, including those great authorities, Sir Charles Barry, Mr. Cockerell, Mr. Tite, and Mr. Penrose. They at once resolved to gladden the eye with colour, without disturbing the solemn and harmonious simplicity. Paintings, mosaics, marble and gilding were requisite; the dome was to be relieved of Thornhill's lifeless <hi rend=italics>grisailles</hi>; and above all, stainedglass windows were pronounced indispensable.
<p>The dome had originally been filled by Thornhill with <num value="8">eight</num> scenes from the life of St. Paul. He received for them the not very munificent but quite adequate sum of <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">40</num>s.</measure> per square yard. They soon began to show symptoms of decay, and Mr. Parris, the painter, invented an apparatus by which they could easily be repaired, but no funds could then be found; yet when the paintings fell off in flakes, much money and labour was expended on the restoration, which has now proved useless. Mr. Penrose has shown that so ignorant was Sir James of perspective, that his painted architecture has actually the effect of making Wren's <num value="32">thirty-two</num> pilasters seem to lean forward.
<p>Much has already been done in St. Paul's. <num value="2">Two</num> out of the <num value="8">eight</num> large spandrel pictures round the dome are already executed. There are eventually to be <num value="4">four</num> evangelists and <num value="4">four</num> major prophets. Above the gilt rails of the whispering gallery an inscription on a mosaic and gold ground has been placed. A marble memorial pulpit has been put up, The screen has been removed, and the organ, greatly enlarged and improved, has been divided into <num value="2">two</num> parts, which have been placed on either side of the choir, above the stalls; the dome is lighted with gas; the golden gallery, ball, and cross have been re-gilt. The great baldachino is still wanting, but <num value="9">nine</num> stained-glass windows have been erected, and among the. donors have been the Drapers' and Goldsmiths' Companies; there are also memorial windows to the late Bishop Blomfield and Cotton, Esq. The Grocers', Merchant Taylors', Goldsmiths', Mercers, and Fishmongers' Companies have generously gilt the vaults of the choir and the arches adjoining the dome. Some <num value="50">fifty</num> or more windows still require stained glass. The wall panels are to be in various places adorned with inlaid marbles. It is not intended that St. Paul's should try to rival St. Peter's at Rome in exube- France of ornament, but it still requires a good deal of clothing. The great army of sable martyrs in marble have been at last washed white, and the fire-engines might now advantageously be used upon the exterior.
<p>A few figures about the dimensions of St. Paul's will not be uninteresting. The cathedral is <num value="2292">2,292</num> feet in circumference, and the height from the nave pavement, to the top of the cross is <num value="365">365</num> feet. The height of St. Peter's at Rome being <num value="432">432</num> feet, St. Paul's could stand inside St. Peter's. The western towers are <num value="220">220</num> feet high. From east to west, St. Paul's is <num value="500">500</num> feet long, while St. Peter's is <num value="669">669</num> feet. The cupola is considered by many as more graceful than that of St. Peter's, <QUOTE>though in its connection with the church by an order higher than that below it there is a violation of the laws of the art.</QUOTE> The external appearance of St. Paul's rivals, if not excels, that of St. Peter's, but the inside is much inferior. The double portico of St. Paul's has been greatly censured. The commissioners insisted on <num value="12">twelve</num> columns, as emblematical of the <num value="12">twelve</num> apostles, and Wren could not obtain stones of sufficient size; but (as Mr. Gwilt observes) it would have been better to have had joined pillars rather than a Composite heaped on a Corinthian portico. In the tympanum is the Conversion of St. Paul, sculptured in high relief by Bird; on the apex is a colossal figure of St. Paul, and on the right and left are St. Peter and St. <pb id="p.255" n="255"> James. Over the southern portico is sculptured the Phoenix; over the north are the royal arms and regalia, while on each side stand on guard <num value="5">five</num> statues of the apostles.

The outer golden gallery is at the summit of the dome. The inner golden gallery is at the base of the lantern.

<num value="55">55</num> feet high, terminating in a dome whereon a ball and (Aveline) cross is raised. The last-named cone is provided with corbels, sufficient in number to receive the hammer-beams of the external dome, which is of oak, and its base <num value="220">220</num> feat from the pavement, its summit being level with the top of the cone. In form it is nearly hemispherical, and generated by radii <num value="57">57</num> feet in length, whose centres are in a horizontal diameter passing through its base.

In this peristyle every <num value="4">fourth</num> intercolumniation is filled up solid, with a niche, and connection is provided between it and the wall of the lower cone. Vertically over the base of that cone, above the peristyle, rises another cylindrical wall, appearing above the balustrade. It is ornamented with pilasters, between which are <num value="2">two</num> tiers of rectangular windows. From this wall the external dome springs. The lantern receives no support from it.

From these sheets was painted a panorama of London and the environs, <num value="1">first</num> exhibited at the Colosseum, in Regent's Park, in <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>. The view from St. Paul's extends for <num value="20">twenty</num> miles round. On the south the horizon is bounded by Leith Hill. In high winds the scaffold used to creak and whistle like a ship labouring in a storm, and once the observatory was torn from its lashings and turned partly over on the edge of the platform. The sight and sounds of awaking London are said to have much impressed the artist.
<p>On entering the cathedral, says Mr. Horner, at <num value="3">three</num> in the morning, the stillness which then prevailed in the streets of this populous city, contrasted with their midday bustle, was only surpassed by the more solemn and sepulchral stillness of the cathedral itself. But not less impressive was the development at that early hour of the immense scene from its lofty summit, whence was frequently beheld <QUOTE>the forest of London,</QUOTE> without any indication of animated existence. It was interesting to mark the gradual symptoms of returning life, until the rising sun vivified the whole into activity, bustle, and business. On <num value="1">one</num> occasion the night was passed in the observatory, for the purpose of meeting the <num value="1">first</num> glimpse of day; but the cold was so intense as to preclude any wish to repeat the experiment.
<p>Mr. Horner, in his narrative, mentions a narrow escape of Mr. Gwyn, while engaged in measuring the top of the dome for a sectional drawing he was making of the cathedral. While absorbed in his work Mr. Gwyn slipped down the globular surface of the dome till his foot stopped on a projecting lump of lead. In this awful situation, like a man hanging to the moon, he remained till <num value="1">one</num> of his assistants providentially saw and rescued him.
<p>The following was, if possible, an even narrower escape:--When Sir James Thornhill was painting <pb id="p.256" n="256"> the cupola of St. Paul's Cathedral, a gentleman of his acquaintance was <num value="1">one</num> day with him on the scaffolding, which, though wide, was not railed; he had just finished the head of <num value="1">one</num> of the apostles, and running back, as is usual with painters, to observe the effect, had almost reached the extremity; the gentleman, seeing his danger, and not having time for words, snatched up a large brush and smeared the face. Sir James ran hastily forward, crying out, <QUOTE>Bless my soul, what have you done?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>I have only saved your life!</QUOTE> responded his friend.

<p>Sir James Thornhill was the son of a reduced Dorsetshire gentleman. His uncle, the well-known physician, Dr. Sydenham, helped to educate him.

<p>The cathedral was artificially secured from lightning, according to the suggestion of the Royal Society, in <datestruct value="1769--"><year reg="1769">1769</year></datestruct>. The <num value="7">seven</num> iron scrolls supporting the ball and cross are connected with other rods (used merely as conductors), which unite them with several large bars descending obliquely to the stone-work of the lantern, and connected by an iron ring with <num value="4">four</num> other iron bars to the lead covering of the great cupola, a distance of fortyeight feet; thence the communication is continued by the rain-water pipes, which pass into the earth, thus completing the entire communication from the cross to the ground, partly through iron and partly through lead. On the clock-tower a bar of iron connects the pine-apple on the top with the iron staircase, and thence with the lead on the roof of the church. The bell-tower. is similarly protected. By these means the. metal used in the building is made available as conductors, the metal employed merely for that purpose being exceedingly small in quantity.
<p>In <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct> the exterior of the dome was repaired by workmen resting upon, a shifting iron frame. n <datestruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></datestruct> a scaffold and observatory, as shown on page <num value="258">258</num>, were raised round the cross, and in <num value="3">three</num> months some <num value="4000">four thousand</num> observations were made for a new trigonometrical survey of London.

<p>A few nooks and corners of the cathedral have still escaped us. The library in the gallery over the southern aisle was formed by Bishop Compton, and consists of some <num value="7000">7,000</num> volumes, including some manuscripts from old St. Paul's. The room contains some loosely hung flowers, exquisitely carved in wood by Grinling Gibbons, and the floor is composed of <num value="2300">2,300</num> pieces of oak, inlaid without nails or pegs. At the end of the gallery is a geometrical staircase of <num value="110">110</num> steps, which was constructed by Wren to furnish a private access to the library. In crossing thence to the northern gallery, there is a fine view of the entire vista of the cathedral. The model-room used to contain Wren's <num value="1">first</num> design, and some tattered flags once hung beneath the dome. Wren's noble model, we regret to learn, is <QUOTE>a ruin, after <num value="140">one hundred and forty</num> years of neglect,</QUOTE> the funds being insufficient for its repair. A staircase from the southern gallery leads to the south-western campanile tower, in which is the clock-room. The clock, which cost <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure>, was made by Langley Bradley in <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>.

The pendulum is <num value="16">16</num> feet long, and the bob weighs <measure value="180l." type=currency><num value="180">180</num> pounds</measure>, and yet is suspended by a spring no thicker than a shilling. The clock goes <num value="8">eight</num> days, and strikes the hours on the great bell, the clapper of which weighs <measure value="180l." type=currency><num value="180">180</num> pounds</measure>. Below the great bell are <num value="2">two</num> smaller bells, on which the clock strikes the quarters. In the northern tower is the bell that tolls for prayers. Mr. E. B. Denison pronounced the St. Paul's bell, although the smallest, as by far the best of the <num value="4">four</num> large bells of England- York, Lincoln, and Oxford being the other <num value="3">three</num>.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.257.1">New Bell</lemma></NOTE>

<p>It was not this bell, but the Westminster Great Tom, which the sentinel on duty during the reign of William III. declared he heard strike <num value="13">thirteen</num> instead of <num value="12">twelve</num> at midnight; and the truth of the fact was deposed to by several persons, and the life of the poor soldier, sentenced to death for having fallen asleep upon his post, was thus saved. The man's name was Hatfield. He died in <datestruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct> in Aldersgate, aged <num value="102">102</num> years.
<p>Before the time of the present St. Paul's, and as long ago as the reign of Henry VII., there is on record a well-attested story of a young girl who, going to confess, was importuned by the monk then on his turn there for the purpose of confession in the building; and quickly escaping from him up the stairs of the great clock tower, raised the clapper or hammer of the bell of the clock, just as it had finished striking <num value="12">twelve</num>, and, by means of the roof, eluded her assailant and got away. On accusing him, as soon as she reached her friends and home, she called attention to the fact of the clock having struck <num value="13">thirteen</num> that time; and on those in the immediate neighbourhood of the cathedral being asked if so unusual a thing had been heard, they said it was so. This proved the story, and the monk was degraded.
<p>And here we must insert a curious story of a monomaniac whose madness was associated with St. Paul's. Dr. Pritchard, in an essay on <QUOTE>Somnambulism and Animal Magnetism,</QUOTE> in the <title>Cyclopaedia of Medicine,</title> gives the following remarkable case of ecstasis :
<p>A gentleman about <num value="35">thirty-five</num> years of age, of active habits and good constitution, living in the neighbourhood of London, had complained for about <num value="5">five</num> weeks of a slight headache. He was feverish, inattentive to his occupation, and negligent of his family. He had been cupped, and taken some purgative medicine, when he was visited by Dr. Arnould, of Camberwell. By that gentleman's advice, he was sent to a private asylum, where he remained about <num value="2">two</num> years. His delusions very gradually subsided, and he was afterwards restored to his family. The account which he gave of himself was, almost <hi rend=italics>verbatim</hi>, as follows :--<num value="1">One</num> afternoon in the month of May, feeling himself a little unsettled, and not inclined to business, he thought he would take a walk into the City to amuse his mind; and having strolled into St. Paul's Churchyard, he stopped at the shop-window of Carrington and Bowles, and looked at the pictures, among which was <num value="1">one</num> of the cathedral. e had not been long there before a short, gravelooking, elderly gentleman, dressed in dark brown clothes, came up and began to examine the prints, and, occasionally casting a glance at him, very soon entered into conversation with him; and, praising the view of St. Paul's which was exhibited at the window, told him many anecdotes of Sir Christopher Wren, the architect, and asked him at the same time if he had ever ascended to the top of the dome. He replied in the negative. The stranger then inquired if he had dined, and proposed that they should go to an eating-house in the neighbourhood, and said that after dinner he would accompany him up St. Paul's. <QUOTE>It was a glorious afternoon for a view, and he was so familiar with the place that he could point out every object worthy of attention.</QUOTE> The kindness of the old gentleman's manner induced him to comply with the invitation, and they went to a tavern in some dark alley, the name of which he did not know. They dined, and very soon left the table and ascended to the ball, just below the cross, which they entered alone. They had not been there many minutes when, while he was gazing on the extensive prospect, and delighted with the splendid scene below him, the grave gentleman pulled out from an inside coat-pocket something resembling a compass, having round the edges some curious figures. Then, having muttered some unintelligible words, he placed it in the centre of the ball. He felt a great trembling and a sort of horror come over him, which was increased by his companion asking him if he should like to see any friend at a distance, and to know what he was at that moment doing, for if so the latter could show him any such person. It happened that his father had been for a long time in bad health, and for some weeks past he had not visited him. A sudden thought came into his mind, so powerful that it overcame his terror, that he should like to see his father. He had no sooner expressed the wish than the exact person of his father was immediately presented to his sight in the mirror, reclining in his armchair and taking his afternoon sleep. Not having fully believed in the power of the stranger to make good his offer, he became overwhelmed with terror at the clearness and truth of the vision presented to him, and he entreated his mysterious companion that they might immediately descend, <pb id="p.258" n="258"> as he felt very ill. The request was complied with, and on parting under the portico of the northern entrance the stranger said to him, <QUOTE>Remember, you are the slave of the Man of the Mirror!</QUOTE> He returned in the evening to his home, he does not know exactly at what hour; felt himself unquiet, depressed, gloomy, apprehensive, and haunted with thoughts of the stranger. For the last <num value="3">three</num> months he has been conscious of the power of the latter over him. Dr. Arould adds :-- <QUOTE>I inquired in what way his power was exercised. He cast on me a look of suspicion, mingled with confidence, took my arm, and after leading me through <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> rooms, and then into the garden, exclaimed,  <Q>It is of no use;

Since that fatal interview with the necromancer,</Q>  he continued,  <Q>for such I believe him to be, he is continually dragging me before him on his mirror, and he not only sees me every moment of the day, but he reads all my thoughts, and I have a dreadful consciousness that no action of my life is free from his inspection, and no place <pb id="p.259" n="259">

I have only told you of the mirror; but in some part of the building which we passed in coming away, he showed me what he called a great bell, and I heard sounds which came from it, and which went to it--sounds of laughter, and of anger, and of pain. There was a dreadful confusion of sounds, and as I listened, with wonder and affright, he said, <Q>This is my organ of hearing; this great bell is in communication with all other bells within the circle of hieroglyphics, by which every word spoken by those under my command is made audible to me.</Q></Q>  Seeing me look surprised at him, he said,  <Q>I have not yet told you all, for he practises his spells by hieroglyphics on walls and houses, and wields his power, like a detestable tyrant, as he is, over the minds of those whom he has enchanted, and who are the objects of his constant spite, within the circle of the hieroglyphics.</Q>  I asked him what these hieroglyphics were, and how he perceived them. He replied,  <Q>Signs and symbols which you, in your ignorance of their true meaning, have taken for letters and words, and read, as you have thought, <Q>Day and Martin's and Warren's blacking.</Q></Q>   <Q> Oh! that is all nonsense!</Q>   <Q>They are only the mysterious characters which he traces to mark the boundary of his dominion, and by which he prevents all escape from his tremendous power. How have I toiled and laboured to get beyond the limit of his influence! Once I walked for <num value="3">three</num> days and <num value="3">three</num> nights, till I fell down under a wall, exhausted by fatigue, and dropped asleep; but on awakening I saw the dreadful signs before mine eyes, and I felt myself as completely under his infernal spells at the end as at the beginning of my journey.</Q> </QUOTE>
<p>It is probable that this gentleman had actually ascended to the top of St. Paul's, and that impressions there received, being afterwards renewed in his mind when in a state of vivid excitement, in a dream of ecstatic reverie, became so blended with the creations of fancy as to form <num value="1">one</num> mysterious vision, in which the true and the imaginary were afterwards inseparable.

<p>The staff of the cathedral consists of the dean, the precentor, the chancellor, the treasurer, the <num value="5">five</num> archdeacons of London, Middlesex, Essex, Colchester, and St. Albans, <num value="30">thirty</num> major canons or prebendaries (<num value="4">four</num> of whom are resident), <num value="12">twelve</num> minor canons, and <num value="6">six</num> vicars-choral, besides the choristers. <num value="1">One</num> of the vicars-choral officiates as organist, and <num value="3">three</num> of the minor canons hold the appointments of sub-dean, librarian, and succentor, or under-precentor.
<p><num value="3">Three</num> of the most celebrated men connected with St. Paul's in the last century have been Milman, Sydney Smith, and Barham (the author of

<p>Of Sydney Smith's connection with St. Paul's we have many interesting records. <num value="1">One</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> things Lord Grey said on entering Downing Street, to a relation who was with him, was, <QUOTE>Now shall be able to do something for Sydney Smith,</QUOTE> and shortly after he was appointed by the Premier to a prebendal stall at St. Paul's, in exchange for the <num value="1">one</num> he held at Bristol.
<p>Mr. Cockerell, the architect, and superintendent of St. Paul's Cathedral, in a letter printed in Lady Holland's <title>Memoir,</title> describes the <hi rend=italics>gesta</hi> of the canon residentiary; how his early communications with himself (Mr. C.) and all the officers of the chapter were extremely unpleasant; but when the canon had investigated the matter, and there had been <QUOTE>a little collision,</QUOTE> nothing could be more candid and kind than his subsequent treatment. He examined the prices of all the materials used in the repairs of the cathedral--as Portland stone, putty, and white lead; every item was taxed, payments were examined, and nothing new could be undertaken without his survey and personal superintendence. He surveyed the pinnacles and heights of the sacred edifice; and once, when it was feared he might stick fast in a narrow opening of the western towers, he declared that <QUOTE>if there were <num value="6">six</num> inches of space there would be room enough for him.</QUOTE> The insurance of the magnificent cathedral, Mr. Cockerell tells us, engaged his early attention; St. Paul's was speedily and effectually insured in some of the most substantial offices in London. Not satisfied with this security, he advised the introduction of the mains of the New River into the lower parts of the fabric, and cisterns and movable engines in the roof; and quite justifiable was his joke, that <QUOTE>he would reproduce the Deluge in our cathedral.</QUOTE>
<p>He had also the library heated by a stove, so as to be more comfortable to the studious; and the bindings of the books were repaired. Lastly, Mr. <pb id="p.261" n="261"> Smith materially assisted the progress of a suit in Chancery, by the successful result of which a considerable addition was made to the fabric fund.

Such fresh, happy voices, singing with such innocent, heedful tenderness as would bring tears to the eyes of even stonyhearted old Malthus, bring to the most irreligious thoughts of Him who bade little children come to Him, and would not have them repulsed.
<p>Blake's poem begins-
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=stanza><L>&lsquo;Twas on a Holy Thursday, their innocent faces clean,
<L>Came children walking <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="2">two</num>, in red and blue and green;
<L>Grey-headed beadles walked before, with wands as white as snow,
<L>Till into the high dome of Paul's they like Thames' waters flow.</LG><LG>

<L>Oh, what a multitude they seemed, those flowers of London town;
<L>Seated in companies they were, with radiance all their own;
<L>The hum of multitudes was there, but multitudes of lambs,
<L>Thousands of little boys and girls, raising their innocent hands.</LG><LG>

<L>Now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song,
<L>Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among;
<L>Beneath them sit the aged men, wise guardians of the poor;
<L>Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door.</QUOTE>

<P>The anniversary Festival of the Sons of the Clergy, in the middle of May, when the choirs of Westminster and the Chapel Royal sing selections from Handel and other great masters, is also a day not easily to be forgotten, for St. Paul's is excellent for sound, and the fine music rises like incense to the dome, and lingers there as <QUOTE>loth to die,</QUOTE> arousing thoughts that, as Wordsworth beautifully says, are in themselves proofs of our immortality. It is on such occasions we feel how great a genius reared St. Paul's, and cry out with the poet-
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>He thought not of a perishable home
<L>Who thus could build.</QUOTE>

<p>The shape of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.262.1">St. Paul's Churchyard</lemma> has been compared to that of a bow and a string. The south side is the bow, the north the string. The booksellers overflowing from Fleet Street mustered strong here, till the Fire scared them off to Little Britain, from whence they regurgitated to the Row. At the sign of the <QUOTE>White Greyhound</QUOTE> the <num value="1">first</num> editions of Shakespeare's <title>Venus and Adonis</title>
and <title>The Rape of Lucrece,</title> the <num value="1">first</num>-fruits of a great harvest, were published by John Harrison. At the <QUOTE>Flower de Luce</QUOTE> and the <QUOTE>Crown</QUOTE> appeared the <title>Merry Wives of Windsor</title>; at the <QUOTE>Green Dragon,</QUOTE> in the same locality, the <title>Merchant of Venice</title>; at the <QUOTE>Fox,</QUOTE> <title>Richard II</title>; at the <QUOTE>Angel,</QUOTE> <title>Richard III</title>.; at the <QUOTE>Gun,</QUOTE> <title>Titus Andronicus</title>; and at the <QUOTE>Red Bull,</QUOTE> that masterpiece,
<title>King Lear</title>. So that in this area near the Row the great poet must have paced with his <num value="1">first</num> proofs in his doublet-pocket, wondering whether he should ever rival Spenser, or become immortal, like Chaucer. Here he must have come smiling over Falstaff's perils, and here have walked with the ripened certainty of greatness and of fame stirring at his heart.
<P>The ground-plot of the Cathedral is <num value="2">2</num> acres <num value="16">16</num> perches <num value="70">70</num> feet. The western area of the churchyard marks the site of St. Gregory's Church. On the mean statue of Queen Anne a scurrilous epigram was once written by some ribald Jacobite, who spoke of the queen--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>With her face to the brandy-shop and her back to the church.</QUOTE>

<P>The precinct wall of St. Paul's <num value="1">first</num> ran from Ave Maria Lane eastward along Paternoster Row to the old Exchange, Cheapside, and then southwards to Carter Lane, at the end of which it turned to Ludgate Archway. In the reign of Edward II. the Dean and Chapter, finding the precinct a resort of thieves and courtesans, rebuilt and purified it. Within, at the north-west corner, stood the bishop's palace, beyond which, eastward, was Pardon Churchyard and Becket Chapel, rebuilt with a stately <pb id="p.263" n="263"> cloister in the reign of Henry V. On the walls o this cloister, pulled down by the greedy Protector Somerset (Edward VI.), was painted <num value="1">one</num> of those grim Dances of Death which Holbein at last carried to perfection. The cloister was full of monuments, and above was a library. In an enclosure east of this stood the College of Minor Canons; and at Canon Alley, east, was a burial chapel called the Charnel, from whence Somerset sent cart-loads of bones to Finsbury Fields. East of Canon Alley stood
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.263.1">Paul's Cross</lemma> where open-air sermons were preached to the citizens, and often to the reigning monarch. East of it rose St. Paul's School and a belfrey tower, in which hung the famous Jesus bells, won at dice by Sir Giles Partridge from that Ahab of England, Henry VIII. On the south side stood the Dean and Chapter's garden, dormitory, refectory, kitchen, slaughterhouse, and brewery. These eventually yielded to a cloister, near which, abutting on the cathedral wall, stood the chapterhouse and the Church of St. Gregory. Westward were the houses of the residentiaries; and the deanery, according to Milman, an excellent authority, stood on its present site. The precinct had <num value="6">six</num> gates--the <num value="1">first</num> and chief in Ludgate Street; the <num value="2">second</num> in Paul's Alley, leading to Paternoster Row; the <num value="3">third</num> in Canon Alley, leading to the north door; the <num value="4">fourth</num>, a little gate leading to Cheapside; the <num value="5">fifth</num>, the Augustine: gate, leading to Watling Street; the <num value="6">sixth</num>, on the south side, by Paul's Chain. On the south tower of the west front was the Lollard's Tower, a bishop's prison for ecclesiastical offenders.
<p>The <num value="2500">2,500</num> railings of the churchyard and the <num value="7">seven</num> ornamental gates, weighing altogether <num value="200">two hundred</num> tons, were cast in Kent, and cost <measure value="6d." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> a pound. The whole cost <num value="11202">11,202</num> <measure value="0s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="0">0</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure>
<p>In <datestruct value="1606--"><year reg="1606">1606</year></datestruct> St. Paul's Churchyard was the scene of the execution of Father Garnet, <num value="1">one</num> of the Gunpowder Plot conspirators--the only execution, as far as we know, that ever desecrated that spot. t is very doubtful, after all, whether Garnet was cognizant that the plot was really to be carried out, though he may have strongly suspected some dangerous and deadly conspiracy, and the Roman Catholics were prepared to see miracles wrought at his death.
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1606-05-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> day of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1606">1606</year></datestruct> (to condense Dr. Abbott's account), Garnet was drawn upon a hurdle, according to the usual practice, to his place of execution. The Recorder of London, the Dean of St. Paul's, and the Dean of Winchester were present, by command of the King--the former in the King's name, and the <num value="2">two</num> latter in the name of God and Christ, to assist Garnet with such advice as suited the condition of a dying man. As soon as he had ascended the scaffold, which was much elevated in order that the people might behold the spectacle, Garnet saluted the Recorder somewhat familiarly, who told him that it was expected from him that he hould publicly deliver his real opinion respecting the conspiracy and treason; that it was now of no use to dissemble, as all was clearly and manifestly proved; but that if, in the true spirit of repent- Dance, he was willing to satisfy the Christian world by declaring his hearty compunction, he might freely state what he pleased. <QUOTE>The deans then told him that they were present on that occasion by authority, in order to suggest to him such matters as might be useful for his soul; that they desired to do this without offence, and exhorted him to prepare and settle himself for another world, and to commence his reconciliation with God by a sincere and saving repentance. To this exhortation Garnet replied</QUOTE> that he had already done so, and that he had before satisfied himself in this respect. <QUOTE>The clergymen then suggested that he would do well to declare his mind to the people.</QUOTE> Then Garnet said to those near him, <QUOTE>I always disapproved of tumults and seditions against the king, and if this crime of the powder treason had been completed I should have abhorred it with my whole soul and conscience.</QUOTE> They then advised him to declare as much to the people. <QUOTE>I am very weak,</QUOTE> said he, <QUOTE>and my voice fails me. If I should speak to the people, I cannot make them hear me; it is impossible that they should hear me.</QUOTE> Then said Mr. Recorder, <QUOTE>Mr. Garnet, if you will come with me, I will take care that they shall hear you,</QUOTE> and, going before him, led him to the western end of the scaffold. He still hesitated to address the people, but the Recorder urged him to speak his mind freely, promising to repeat his words aloud to the multitude. Garnet then addressed the crowd as follows :-- <QUOTE>My good fellow-citizens,--I am come hither, on the morrow of the invention of the Holy Cross, to see an end of all my pains and troubles in this world. I here declare before you all that I consider the late treason and conspiracy against the State to be cruel and detestable; and, for my part, all designs and endeavours against the king were ever misliked by me; and if this attempt had been perfected, as it was designed, I think it would have been altogether damnable; and I pray for all prosperity to the king, the queen, and the royal family.</QUOTE> Here he paused, and the Recorder reminded him to ask pardon of the King for that which he had attempted. <QUOTE>I do so,</QUOTE> said Garnet, <QUOTE>as far as I have sinned <pb id="p.264" n="264"> against him-namely, in that I did not reveal that whereof I had a general knowledge from Mr. Catesby, but not otherwise.</QUOTE> Then said the Dean of Winchester, <QUOTE>Mr. Garnet, I pray you deal clearly in the matter: you were certainly privy to the whole business.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>God forbid!</QUOTE> said Garnet; <QUOTE>I never understood anything of the design of blowing up the Parliament House.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Nay,</QUOTE> responded the Dean of Winchester, <QUOTE>it is manifest that all the particulars were known to you, and you have declared under your own hand that Greenaway told you all the circumstances in Essex.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>That,</QUOTE> said Garnet, <QUOTE>was in secret confession, which I could by no means reveal.</QUOTE> Then said the Dean, <QUOTE>You have yourself, Mr. Garnet, almost acknowledged that this was only a pretence, for you have openly confessed that Greenaway told you not in a confession, but by way of a confession, and that he came of purpose to you with the design of making a confession; but you answered that it was not necessary you should know the full extent of his knowledge.</QUOTE> The dean'further reminded him that he had affirmed under his own hand that this was not told him by way of con-
<FIGURE id="Fig.264" n="2000.06.0096"><HEAD>The Library Of St. Paul's (see page <num value="256">256</num>).</HEAD></FIGURE>
 fessing a sin, but by way of conference and consultation; and that Greenaway and Catesby both came to confer with him upon that business, and that as often as he saw Greenaway he would ask him about that business because it troubled him. <QUOTE>Most certainly,</QUOTE> said Garnet; <QUOTE>I did so in order to prevent it, for I always misliked it.</QUOTE> Then said the Dean, <QUOTE>You only withheld your approbation until the Pope had given his opinion.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>But I was well persuaded,</QUOTE> said Garnet, <QUOTE>that the Pope would never approve the design.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Your intention,</QUOTE> said the Dean of Winchester, <QUOTE>was clear from those <num value="2">two</num> breves which you received from Rome for the exclusion of the King.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>That,</QUOTE> said Garnet, <QUOTE>was before the King came in.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>But if you knew nothing of the particulars of the business,</QUOTE> said the Dean, <QUOTE>why did you send Baynham to inform the Pope? for this also you have confessed in your examinations.</QUOTE> Garnet replied, <QUOTE>I have already answered to all these matters on my trial, and I acknowledge everything that is contained in my written confessions.</QUOTE>
<p>Then, turning his discourse again to the people, at the instance of the Recorder, he proceeded to <pb id="p.265" n="265"> the same effect as before, declaring <QUOTE>that he wholly misliked that cruel and inhuman design, and that he had never sanctioned or approved of any such attempts against the King and State, and that this project, if it had succeeded, would have been in his mind most damnable.</QUOTE>
<p>Having thus spoken, he raised his hands, and made the sign of the cross upon his forehead and breast, saying, <QUOTE lang=la>In nomine Patris, Fillii, et Spiritus Sancti! Jesus Maria! Maria, mater gratiae! Mater misericordiae! Tu me ab hoste protege, et hora mortis suscipe!</QUOTE> Then he said, <QUOTE lang=la>In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum, quia tu redemisti me, Domine, Deus veritatis!</QUOTE> Then, again crossing himself, he said, <QUOTE lang=la>Per crucis hoc signum fugiat procul omne malignum! Infige crucem tuam, Domine, in corde meo;</QUOTE> and again, <QUOTE lang=la>Jesus Maria! Maria, mater gratiae!</QUOTE> In the midst of these prayers the ladder was drawn away, and, by the express command of the King, he remained hanging from the gallows until he was quite dead.
<FIGURE id="Fig.265" n="2000.06.0097"><HEAD> <QUOTE>The Face In The Straw.</QUOTE> --From Abbot's <QUOTE>Anthologia,</QUOTE> <datestruct value="1613--"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct> (see page <num value="266">266</num>).</HEAD></FIGURE>

<p>The <QUOTE>face in the straw</QUOTE> was a miracle said to be performed at Garnet's death.
<p>The original fabricator of the miracle of the straw was <num value="1">one</num> John Wilkinson, a young Roman Catholic, who at the time of Garnet's trial and execution was about to pass over into France, to commence his studies at the Jesuits' College at St. Omer's. Some time after his arrival there, Wilkinson was attacked by a dangerous disease, from which there was no hope of his recovery; and while in this state he gave utterance to the story, which Endaemon- Joannes relates in his own words, as follows:-- <QUOTE>The day before Father Garnet's execution my mind was suddenly impressed (as by some external impulse) with a strong desire to witness his death, and bring home with me some relic of him. I had at that time conceived so certain a persuasion that my design would be gratified, that I did not for a moment doubt that I should witness some immediate testimony from God in favour of the innocence of his saint; though as often as the idea occurred <pb id="p.266" n="266"> to my mind, I endeavoured to drive it away, that I might not vainly appear to tempt Providence by looking for a miracle where it was not necessarily to be expected. Early the next morning I betook myself to the place of execution, and, arriving there before any other person, stationed myself close to the scaffold, though I was afterwards somewhat forced from my position as the crowd increased.</QUOTE> Having then described the details of the execution, he proceeds thus :-- <QUOTE>Garnet's limbs having been divided into <num value="4">four</num> parts, and placed, together with the head, in a basket, in order that they might be exhibited, according to law, in some conspicuous place, the crowd began to disperse. I then again approached close to the scaffold, and stood between the cart and place of execution; and as I lingered in that situation, still burning with the desire of bearing away some relic, that miraculous ear of straw, since so highly celebrated,came, I know not how, into my hand. A considerable quantity of dry straw had been thrown with Garnet's head and quarters into the basket, but whether this ear came into my hand from the scaffold or from the basket I cannot venture to affirm; this only I can truly say, that a straw of this kind was thrown towards me before it had touched the ground. This straw I afterwards delivered to Mrs. N----, a matron of singular Catholic piety, who inclosed it in a bottle, which being rather shorter than the straw, it became slightly bent. A few days afterwards Mrs. N----showed the straw in a bottle to a certain noble person, her intimate acquaintance, who, looking at it attentively, at length said,  <Q>I can see nothing in it but a man's face.</Q>  Mrs. Nand myself being astonished at this unexpected exclamation, again and again examined the ear of the straw, and distinctly perceived in it a human countenance, which others also, coming in as casual spectators, or expressly called by us as witnesses, likewise beheld at that time. This is, as God knoweth, the true history of Father Garnet's straw.</QUOTE> The engraving upon the preceding page is taken from Abbot's <title>Anthologia,</title> published in <datestruct value="1613--"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct>, in which a full account of the <QUOTE>miracle</QUOTE> is given.
<p>At <num value="65">65</num>, St. Paul's Churchyard, north-west corner, lived the worthy predecessor of Messrs. Grant and Griffith, Goldsmith's friend and employer, Mr. John Newbery, that good-natured man with the red-pimpled face, who, as the philanthropic bookseller, figures pleasantly in the <title>Vicar of Wakefield;</title> always in haste to be gone, he was ever on business of the utmost importance, and was at that time actually compiling materials for the history of <num value="1">one</num> Thomas Trip. <QUOTE>The friend of tall mankind,</QUOTE> Dr. Primrose calls him. <QUOTE>The honestest man in the nation,</QUOTE> as--Goldsmiith said of him in a doggerel riddle which he wrote. Newbery's nephew printedthe <title>Vicar of Wakefield</title>
for Goldsmith, and the elder Newbury published the <title>Traveller,</title> the corner-stone of Goldsmith's fame. It was the elder Newbery who unearthed the poet at his miserable lodgings in Green Arbour Court, and employed him to write his <title>Citizens of the World,</title> at a guinea each, for his daily newspaper, the <title>Public Ledger</title> (<datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>). The Newberys seem to have been worthy, prudent tradesmen, constantly vexed and irritated at Goldsmith's extravagance, carelessness, and ceaseless cry for money; and so it went on till the hare-brained, delightful fellow died, when Francis Newbery wrote a violent defence of the fever medicine, an excess of which had killed Goldsmith.
<p>The office of the Registrar of the High Court of Admiralty occupied the site of the old cathedral bakehouse. Paul's Chain is so called from a chain that used to be drawn across the carriage-way of the churchyard, to preserve silence during divine service. The northern barrier of St. Paul's is of wood. Opposite the Chain, in <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct> (the Restoration), lived that king of writing and arithmetic masters, the man whose name has grown into a proverb-Edward Cocker--who wrote <title>The Pen's Transcendancy,</title> an extraordinary proof of true eye and clever hand.
<p>In the Chapter House of St. Paul's, which Mr. Peter Cunningham not too severely calls <QUOTE>a shabby, dingy-looking building,</QUOTE> on the north side of the churchyard, was performed the unjust ceremony of degrading Samuel Johnson, the chaplain to William Lord Russell, the martyr of the party of liberty. The divines present, in compassion, and with a prescient eye for the future, purposely omitted to strip off his cassock, which rendered the ceremony imperfect, and afterwards saved the worthy man his benefice.
<p>St. Paul's Coffee House stood at the corner of the archway of Doctors' Commons, on the site of <QUOTE>Paul's Brew House</QUOTE> and the <QUOTE>Paul's Head</QUOTE> tavern. Here, in <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>, the books of the great collector, Dr. Rawlinson, were sold, <QUOTE>after dinner;</QUOTE> and they sold well.
<p>Child's Coffee House, in St. Paul's Churchyard, was a quiet place, much frequented by the clergy of Queen Anne's reign, and by proctors from Doctors' Commons. Addison used to look in-there, to smoke a pipe and listen, behind his paper, to the conversation.--In the <title>Spectator</title>, No. <num value="609">609</num>, he smiles at a country gentleman who mistook all persons in scarves for doctors of divinity. This was at a. time when clergymen always wore their black gowns in <pb id="p.267" n="267"> public. <QUOTE>Only a scarf of the <num value="1">first</num> magnitude,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>entitles <num value="1">one</num> to the appellation of  <Q>doctor</Q>  from the landlady and the boy at  <Q>Child's.</Q> </QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>Child's</QUOTE> was the resort of Dr. Mead, and other professional men of eminence. The Fellows of the Royal Society came here. Whiston relates that Sir Hans Sloane, Dr. Halley, and he were once at <QUOTE>Child's,</QUOTE> when Dr. Halley asked him (Whiston) why he was not a member of the Royal Society? Whiston answered, <QUOTE>Because they durst not choose a heretic.</QUOTE> Upon which Dr. Halley said, if Sir Hans Sloane would propose him, he (Dr. Halley) would <num value="2">second</num> it, which was done accordingly.
<p>Garrick, who kept up his interest with different coteries, carefully cultivated the City men, by attending a club held at the <QUOTE>Queen's Arms</QUOTE> tavern, in St. Paul's Churchyard. Here he used to meet Mr. Sharpe, a surgeon; Mr. Paterson, the City Solicitor; Mr. Draper, a bookseller, and Mr. Clutterbuck, a mercer; and these quiet cool men were his standing council in theatrical affairs, and his gauge of the city taste. They were none of them drinkers, and in order to make a reckoning, called only for French wine. Here Dr. Johnson started a City club, and was particular the members should not be <QUOTE>patriotic.</QUOTE> Boswell, who went with him to the <QUOTE>Queen's Arms</QUOTE> club, found the members <QUOTE>very sensible, well-behaved men.</QUOTE> Brasbridge, the silversmith of Fleet Street, who wrote his memoirs, has described a sixpenny card club held here at a later date. Among the members was that generous and hospitable man, Henry Baldwin, who, under the auspices of Garrick, the elder Colman, and Bonnell Thornton, started the <title>St. James's Chronicle</title>, the most popular evening paper of the day.
<p> <QUOTE>I belonged,</QUOTE> says Brasbridge, <QUOTE>to a sixpenny card club, at the  <Q>Queen's Arms,</Q>  in St. Paul's Churchyard; it consisted of about <num value="20">twenty</num> members, of whom I am the sole survivor. Among them was Mr. Goodwin, of St. Paul's Churchyard, a woollen draper, whose constant salutation, when he <num value="1">first</num> came down-stairs in the morning, was to his shop, in these words,  <Q>Good morrow, Mr. Shop; you'll take care of me, Mr. Shop, and I'll take care of you.</Q>  Another was Mr. Curtis, a respectable stationer, who from very small beginnings left his son <measure value="90000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="90000">90,000</num></measure> in <num value="1">one</num> line, besides an estate of near <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="300">300</num></measure> a year.</QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>The  <Q>Free and Easy under the Rose</Q>  was another society which I frequented. It was founded <num value="60">sixty</num> years ago, at the  <Q> Queen's Arms,</Q>  in St. Paul's Churchyard, and was afterwards removed to the  <Q>Horn</Q>  tavern. It was originally kept by Bates, who was never so happy as when standing behind a chair with a napkin under his arm; but arriving at the dignity of alderman, tucking in his callipash and calipee himself, instead of handing it round to the company, soon did his business. My excellent friend Briskett, the Marshal of the High Court of Admiralty, was president of this society for many years, and I was constantly in attendance as his vice. It consisted of some <num value="1000">thousand</num> members, and I never heard of any <num value="1">one</num> of them that ever incurred any serious punishment. Our great fault was sitting too late; in this respect, according to the principle of Franklin, that  <Q>time is money,</Q>  we were most unwary spendthrifts; in other instances, our conduct was orderly and correct.</QUOTE>
<p><num value="1">One</num> of the members in Brasbridge's time was Mr. Hawkins, a worthy but ill-educated spatterdash maker, of Chancery Lane, who daily murdered the king's English. He called an invalid an <QUOTE>individual,</QUOTE> and said our troops in America had been <QUOTE><hi rend=italics>manured</hi></QUOTE> to hardship. Another oddity was a Mr. Darwin, a Radical, who <num value="1">one</num> night brought to the club-room a caricature of the head of George III. in a basket; and whom Brasbridge nearly frightened out of his wits by pretending to send <num value="1">one</num> of the waiters for the City Marshal. Darwin was the great chum of Mr. Figgins, a waxchandler in the Poultry; and as they always entered the room together, Brasbridge gave them the nickname of <QUOTE>Liver and Gizzard.</QUOTE> Miss Boydell, when her uncle was Lord Mayor, conferred sham knighthood on Figgins, with a tap of her fan, and he was henceforward known as <QUOTE>Sir Benjamin.</QUOTE>
<p>The Churchyard publisher of Cowper's <num value="1">first</num> volume of poems, <title>Table Talk,</title> and also of <title>The Task,</title> was a very worthy, liberal man Joseph Johnson, who also published the <title>Olney Hymns</title>
for Newton, the scientific writings of the persecuted Priestley, and the smooth, vapid verses of Darwin. Johnson encouraged Fuseli to paint a Milton Gallery, for an edition of the poet to be edited by Cowper. Johnson was imprisoned <num value="9">nine</num> months in the King's Bench, for selling the political writings of Gilbert Wakefield. He, however, bore the oppression of the majority philosophically, and rented the marshal's house, where he gave dinners to his distinguished literary friends.
<p> <QUOTE>Another set of my acquaintances,</QUOTE> says Leigh Hunt in his autobiography, <QUOTE><p>used to assemble on Fridays at the hospitable table of Mr. Hunter, the bookseller, in St. Paul's Churchyard. They were the survivors of the literary party that were accustomed to dine with his predecessor, Mr. Johnson. The most regular were Fuseli and Bonnycastle. Now and then Godwin was present; oftener Mr. Kinnaird, the magistrate, a great lover of Horace. <pb id="p.268" n="268">
<p>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.268.1">Fuseli</lemma> was a small man, with energetic features and a white head of hair. Our host's daughter, then a little girl, used to call him the white-headed lion. He combed his hair up from the forehead, and as his whiskers were large his face was set in a kind of hairy frame, which, in addition to the fierceness of his look, really gave him an aspect of that sort. Otherwise his features were rather sharp than round. He would have looked much like an old military officer if his face, besides its real energy, had not affected more. There was the same defect in it as in his pictures. Conscious of not having all the strength he wished, he endeavoured to make up for it by violence and pretension. He carried this so far as to look fiercer than usual when he sat for his picture. His friend and engraver, Mr. Houghton, drew an admirable likeness of him in this state of dignified extravagance. He is sitting back in his chair, leaning on his hand, but looking ready to pounce withal. His notion of repose was like that of Pistol.
<p>A student reading in a garden is all over intensity of muscle, and the quiet tea-table scene in Cowper he has turned into a preposterous conspiracy of huge men and women, all bent on showing their thews and postures, with dresses as fantastic as their minds. <num value="1">One</num> gentleman, of the existence of whose trousers you are not aware till you see the terminating line at the ankle, is sitting and looking grim on a sofa, with his hat on and no waistcoat.
<p>Fuseli was lively and interesting in conversation, but not without his usual faults of violence and pretension. Nor was he always as decorous as an old man ought to be, especially <num value="1">one</num> whose turn of mind is not of the lighter and more pleasurable cast. The licences he took were coarse, and had not sufficient regard to his company. Certainly they went a great deal beyond his friend Armstrong, to whose account, I believe, Fuseli's passion for swearing was laid. The poet condescended to be a great swearer, and Fuseli thought it energetic to swear like him. His friendship with Bonnycastle had something childlike and agreeable in it. They came and went away together for years, like a couple of old schoolboys. They also like boys rallied <num value="1">one</num> another, and sometimes made a singular display of it-Fuseli, at least, for it was he who was the aggressor.
<p>Bonnycastle was a good fellow. He was a tall, gaunt, long-headed man, with large features and spectacles, and a deep internal voice, with a twang of rusticity in it; and he goggled over his plate like a horse. I often thought that a bag of corn would have hung well on him. His laugh was equine, and showed his teeth upwards at the sides. Wordsworth, who notices similar mysterious manifestations on the part of donkeys, would have thought it ominous. Bonnycastle was extremely fond of quoting Shakespeare and telling stories, and if the <hi rend=italics>Edinburgh Revie</hi>w had just come out, would have given us all the jokes in it. He had once a hypochondriacal disorder of long duration, and he told us that he should never forget the comfortable sensation given him <num value="1">one</num> night during this disorder by his knocking a landlord that was insolent to him down the man's staircase. On the strength of this piece of energy (having <num value="1">first</num> ascertained that the offender was not killed) he went to bed, and had a sleep of unusual soundness.
<p>It was delightful <num value="1">one</num> day to hear him speak with complacency of a translation which had appeared in Arabic, and which began by saying, on the part of the translator, that it pleased God, for the advancement of human knowledge, to raise us up a Bonnycastle.
<p>Kinnaird, the magistrate, was a sanguine man, under the middle height, with a fine lamping black eye, lively to the last, and a body that  <Q>had increased, was increasing, and ought to have been diminished,</Q>  which is by no means what he thought of the prerogative. Next to his bottle, he was fond of his Horace, and, in the intervals of business at the police office, would enjoy both in his arm-chair. Between the vulgar calls of this kind of magistracy and the perusal of the urbane Horace there must have been a quota of contradiction, which the bottle, perhaps, was required to render quite palatable.</QUOTE>

<p>Mr. Charles Knight's pleasant book, <title>Shadows of the Old Booksellers,</title> also reminds us of another of the great Churchyard booksellers, John Rivington and Sons, at the <QUOTE>Bible and Crown.</QUOTE> They published, in <datestruct value="1737--"><year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct>, an early sermon of Whitefield's, before he left the Church, and were booksellers to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge; and to this shop country clergymen invariably went to buy their theology, or to publish their own sermons.
<p>In St. Paul's Churchyard (says Sir John Hawkins, in his <title>History of Music</title>) were formerly many shops where music and musical instruments were sold, for which, at this time, no better reason can be given than that the service at the Cathedral drew together, twice a day, all the lovers of music in London--not to mention that the choirmen were wont to assemble there, and were met by their friends and acquaintances. <pb id="p.269" n="269">
<p>Jeremiah Clark, a composer of sacred music, who shot himself in his house in St. Paul's Churchyard, was educated in the Royal Chapel, under Dr. Blow, who entertained so great a friendship for him as to resign in his favor his place of Master of the Children and Almoner of St. Paul's, Clark being appointed his successor, in <datestruct value="1693--"><year reg="1693">1693</year></datestruct>, and shortly afterwards he became organist of the cathedral. <QUOTE>In <datestruct VALUE="1700-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1700">1700</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE> says Sir John Hawkins, <QUOTE><p>he and his fellow pupils were appointed Gentlemen Extraordinary of the Royal Chapel; and in <datestruct value="1704--"><year reg="1704">1704</year></datestruct> they were jointly admitted to the place of organist thereof, in the room of Mr. Francis Piggot. Clark had the misfortune to entertain a hopeless passion for a very beautiful lady, in a station of life far above him; his despair of success threw him into a deep melancholy; in short, he grew weary of his life, and on the <datestruct VALUE="1701-12-1"><day reg="1">first</day> day of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1701">1701</year></datestruct>, shot himself. He was determined upon this method of putting an end to his life by an event which, strange as it may seem, is attested by the late Mr. Samuel Weeley, <num value="1">one</num> of the lay vicars of St. Paul's, who was very intimate with him, and had heard him relate it. Being at the house of a friend in the country, he took an abrupt resolution to return to London; this friend having observed in this bahviour marks of great dejection, furnished him with a horse and a servant. Riding along the road, a fit of melancholy seized him, upon which he alighted, and giving the servant his horse to hold, went into a field, in a corner whereof was a pond, and also trees, and began a debate with himself whether he should then end his days by hanging or drowning. Not being able to resolve on either, he thought of making what he looked upon as chance the umpire, and drew out of his pocket a piece of money, and tossing it into the air, it came down on its edge, and stuck in the clay. Though the determination answered not his wish, it was far from ambiguous, as it seemed to forbid both methods of destruction, and would have given unspeakable comfort to a mind less disordered than his was. Being thus interrupted in his purpose, he returned, and mounting his horse, rode on to London, and in a short time after shot himself. He dwelt in a house in St. Paul's Churchyard, situate on the place where the Chapter-house now stands. Old Mr. Reading was passing by at the instant the pistol went off, and entering the house, found his friend in the agonies of death.
<p>The compositions of Clark are few. His anthems are remarkably pathetic, at the same time that they preserve the dignity and majesty of the church style. The most celebrated of them are  <Q>I will love thee,</Q>  printed in the <num value="2">second</num> book of the  <Q>Harmonia Sacra;</Q>   <Q>Bow down thine ear,</Q>  and  <Q>Praise the Lord, <num value="0">0</num> Jerusalem.</Q>
<P>The only works of Clark published by himself are lessons for the harpsichord and sundry songs, which are to be found in the collections of that day, particularly in the  <Q>Pills to Purge Melancholy,</Q>  but they are there printed without the basses. He also composed for D&lsquo;Urfey's comedy of  <Q>The Fond Husband, or the Plotting Sisters,</Q>  that sweet ballad air,  <Q>The bonny grey-eyed Morn,</Q>  which Mr. Gay has introduced into  <Q>The Beggar's Opera,</Q>  and is sung to the words,  <Q>&lsquo;Tis woman that seduces all mankind.</Q> </QUOTE>

<P> <QUOTE>Mattheson, of Hamburg,</QUOTE> says Hawkins, <QUOTE>had sent over to England, in order to their being published here, <num value="2">two</num> collections of lessons for the harpsichord, and they were accordingly engraved on copper, and printed for Richard Meares, in St. Paul's Churchyard, and published in the year <datestruct value="1714"><year reg="1714">1714</year></datestruct>. Handel was at this time in London, and in the afternoon was used to frequent St. Paul's Church for the sake of hearing the service, and of playing on the organ after it was over; from whence he and some of the gentlemen of the choir would frequently adjourn to the <Q>Queen's Arms</Q> tavern, in St. Paul's Churchyard, where was a harpsichord. It happened <num value="1">one</num> afternoon, when they were thus met together, Mr. Weeley, a gentleman of the choir, came in and informed them that Mr. Mattheson's lessons were then to be had at Mr. Meares's shop; upon which Mr. Handel ordered them immediately to be sent for, and upon their being brought, played them all over without rising from the instrument.</QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>There dwelt,</QUOTE> says Sir John Hawkins, <QUOTE><p>at the west corner of London House Yard, in St. Paul's Churchyard, at the sign of the  <Q>Dolphin and Crown,</Q>  <num value="1">one</num> John Young, a maker of violins and other musical instruments.

The merits of the <num value="2">two</num> Youngs, father and son, are celebrated in the following quibbling verses, which were set to music in the form of a catch, printed in the pleasant  <Q>Musical Companion,</Q>  published in <datestruct value="1726--"><year reg="1726">1726</year></datestruct>:--

 <pb id="p.271" n="271"> Greene and several persons, had weekly meetings at his father's house, for practice of music. The fame of this performance spread far and wide; and in a few winters the resort of gentlemen performers was greater than the house would admit of; a small subscription was set on foot, and they removed to the  <Q>Queen's Head</Q>  tavern, in Paternoster Row. Here they were joined by Mr. Woolaston and his friends, and also by a Mr. Franckville, a fine performer on the viol de Gamba.

<p>The  <Q>Castle</Q>  concerts continuing to flourish for many years, auditors as well as performers were admitted subscribers, and tickets were delivered out to the members in rotation for the admission of ladies.

<p>Mr. Young continued to perform in this society till the declining state of his health obliged him to quit it; after which time Prospero Castrucci and other eminent performers in succession continued to lead the band.

The <num value="3">three</num> lodges that joined with the  <Q> Apple Tree</Q>  lodge used to meet respectively at the  <Q> Goose and Gridiron,</Q>  St. Paul's Churchyard; the  <Q>Crown,</Q>  Parker's Lane; and at the <Q>Rummer and Grapes</Q> Tavern, Westminster. The  <Q>Goose and Gridiron</Q>  occurs at Woodhall, Lincolnshire, and in a few other localities. It is said to owe its origin to the following circumstances :--The  <Q>Mitre</Q>  was a celebrated music-house in London House Yard, at the north-west end of St. Paul's. When it ceased to be a music-house, the succeeding landlord, to ridicule its former destiny, chose for his sign a goose striking the bars of a gridiron with his foot, in ridicule of the  <Q>Swan and Harp,</Q>  a common sign for the early music-houses. Such an origin does the <title>Tatler</title> give; but it may also be a vernacular reading of the coat of arms of the Company of Musicians, suspended probably at the door of the  <Q> Mitre</Q>  when it was a music-house. These arms are a swan with his wings expanded, within a double tressure, counter, flory, argent. This double tressure might have suggested a gridiron to unsophisticated passers-by.
<p>The celebrated  <Q>Mitre,</Q>  near the west end of St. Paul's, was the <num value="1">first</num> music-house in London. The name of the master was Robert Herbert, <hi rend=italics>alias</hi>
Farges. Like many brother publicans, he was, besides being a lover of music, also a collector of natural curiosities, as appears by his  <Q>Catalogue of many natural rarities, collected with great industrie, cost, and <num value="30">thirty</num> years' travel into foreign countries, collected by Robert Herbert, <hi rend=italics>alias</hi> Farges, gent., and sworn servant to his Majesty; to be seen at the place called the Music-house, <hi rend=italics>at the Mitre,</hi>
near the west end of S. Paul's Church, <datestruct value="1664--"><year reg="1664">1664</year></datestruct>.</Q>  This collection, or, at least, a great part of it, was bought by Sir Hans Sloane.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.272.1">St. Paul's School</lemma>, known to cathedral visitors chiefly by that murky, barred-in, purgatorial playground opposite the east end of Wren's great edifice, is of considerable antiquity, for it was
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.272.2">founded in <datestruct value="1512--"><year reg="1512">1512</year></datestruct></LEMMA> by that zealous patron of learning, and friend of

His father was a City mercer, who was twice Lord Mayor of London. Colet became Dean of St. Paul's in <datestruct value="1505--"><year reg="1505">1505</year></datestruct>, and soon afterwards (as Latimer tells us) narrowly escaped burning for his opposition to image--worship.

<p>On occasions of the sovereigns of England, or other royal or distinguished persons, going in state through the City, a balcony is erected in front of this building, whence addresses from the school are presented to the illustrious visitors by the head boys. The origin of this right or custom of the Paulines is not known, but it is of some antiquity. Addresses were so presented to Charles V. and Henry VIII., in <datestruct value="1522--"><year reg="1522">1522</year></datestruct> ; to Queen Elizabeth, <datestruct value="1558--"><year reg="1558">1558</year></datestruct>; and to Queen Victoria, when the Royal Exchange was opened, in <datestruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct>.

<p>The ancient school-room was on a level with the street,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.273.3">the modern <num value="1">one</num></lemma> is built over the cloister. It is a finely-proportioned apartment, and has several new class-rooms adjoining, erected upon a plan proposed by Dr. Kynaston, the present headmaster. At the south end of this noble room, above the master's chair, is a bust of the founder by Roubiliac. Over the seat is inscribed, <QUOTE lang=la>Intendas animum studiis et rebus honestis,</QUOTE> and over the entrance to the room is the quaint and appropriate injunction found at Winchester and other public schools--<QUOTE lang=la>Doce, disce, aut discede.</QUOTE>

<p>St. Paul's School has an excellent library immediately adjoining the school-room, to which the <num value="8">eighth</num> class have access out of school-hours, the <num value="6">six</num> seniors occupying places in it in school-time.
<p>In <datestruct value="1602--"><year reg="1602">1602</year></datestruct> the masters' stipends were enlarged, and the surplus money set apart for college exhibitions.

The education is entirely gratuitous. The presentations to the school are in the gift of the Master of the Mercers' Company, which company has undoubtedly much limited Dean Colet's generous intentions. The school is rich in prizes and exhibitions. The latest chronicler of the Paulines says :--

<P>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.274.3">Paternoster Row</lemma> that crowded defile north of the Cathedral, lying between the old GreyFriars and the Blackfriars, was once entirely ecclesiastical in its character, and, according to Stow, was so called from the stationers and text-writers who dwelt there and sold religious and educational books, alphabets, paternosters, aves, creeds, and graces. It then became famous for its spurriers, and afterwards for eminent mercers, silkmen, and lacemen; so that the coaches of the <QUOTE>quality</QUOTE> often blocked up the whole street. After the fire these trades mostly removed to Bedford Street, King Street, and Henrietta Street, Covent Garden. In <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct> (says Strype) there were stationers and booksellers who came here in Queen Anne's reign from Little Britain, and a good many tire-women, who sold commodes, top-knots, and other dressings for the female head. By degrees, however, learning ousted vanity, chattering died into studious silence, and the despots of literature ruled supreme. Many a groan has gone up from authors in this gloomy thoroughfare.
<P><num value="1">One</num> only, and that the most ancient, of the Paternoster Row book-firms, will our space permit us to chronicle. The house of Longman is part and parcel of the Row. The <num value="1">first</num> Longman, born in Bristol in <datestruct value="1699--"><year reg="1699">1699</year></datestruct>, was the son of a soap and sugar merchant. Apprenticed in London, he purchased (<hi rend=italics>circa</hi> <datestruct value="1724--"><year reg="1724">1724</year></datestruct>) the business of Mr. Taylor, the publisher of <title>Robinson Crusoe,</title> for <measure value="2282l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2282">2,282</num></measure> <measure value="9s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="9">9</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure>, and his <num value="1">first</num> venture was the works of Boyle. This patriarch died in <datestruct value="1755--"><year reg="1755">1755</year></datestruct>, and was succeeded by a nephew, Thomas Longman, who ventured much trade in America and <QUOTE>the plantations.</QUOTE> He was <pb id="p.275" n="275"> succeeded by his son, Mr. T. L. Longman, a plain man of the old citizen style, who took as partner Mr. Owen Rees, a Bristol bookseller, a man of industry and acumen.
<p>Before the close of the eighteenth century the house of Longman and Rees had become <num value="1">one</num> of the largest in the City, both as publishers and book-merchants. When there was talk of an additional paper-duty, the ministers consulted, according to West, the new firm, and on their protest desisted; a reverse course, according to the same authority, would have checked operations on the part of that <num value="1">one</num> firm alone of <num value="100000">100,000</num>. Before the opening of the <num value="19">nineteenth</num> century they had become possessed of some new and valuable copyrights-notably, the <title>Grammar</title> of Lindley Murray, of New York. This was in <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>.
<p>The <QUOTE>lake poets</QUOTE> proved a valuable acquisition. Wordsworth came <num value="1">first</num> to them, then Coleridge, and lastly Southey. In <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct> the Longmans commenced the issue of Rees' <title>Cyclopaedia,</title> reconstructed from the old Chambers', and about the same time the <title>Annual Review</title>, edited by Aikin, which for the <num value="9">nine</num> years of its existence Southey and Taylor of Norwich mainly supported. The catalogue of the firm for <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct> is divided into no less than <num value="22">twenty-two</num> classes. Among their books we note Paley's <title>Natural Theology,</title> Sharon Turner's <title>Anglo-Saxon History,</title> Adolphus's <title>History of King George III.,</title> Pinkerton's <title>Geography,</title>
Fosbrooke's <title>British Monachism,</title> Cowper's
<title>Homer,</title> Gifford's <title>Juvenal,</title> Sotheby's <title>Oberon,</title>
and novels and romances not a few. At this time Mr. Longman used to have Saturday evening receptions in Paternoster Row.
<p>Sir Walter Scott's <title>Guy Mannering,</title> <title>The Monastery,</title> and <title>The Abbot,</title> were published by Longmans. <title>Lalla Rookh,</title> by Tom Moore, was published by them, and they gave <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure> for it.
<p>In <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct> Mr. Brown, who had entered the house as an apprentice in <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>, and was the son of an old servant, became partner. Then came in Mr. Orme, a faithful clerk of the house--for the house required several heads, the old book trade alone being an important department. In <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct>, when Constable of Edinburgh came down in the commercial crash, and brought poor Sir Walter Scott to the ground with him, the Longman firm succeeded to the <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, which is still their property. Mr. Green became a partner in <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>, and in <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct> Mr. Roberts was admitted. In <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct> the firm ventured on Lardner's <title>Cyclopaedia,</title> contributed to by Scott,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.275.1">Tom Moore</lemma>, Mackintosh, &amp;c., and which ended in <datestruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></datestruct> with the <num value="133">133</num>rd volume. In <datestruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></datestruct> Mr. Thomas Longman became a partner.
<p>Thomas Norton Longman, says a writer in the
 <title>Critic</title>, resided for many years at Mount Grove, Hampstead, where he entertained many wits and scholars. He died there in <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>, leaving <measure value="200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200000">200,000</num></measure> personally. In <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct> Mr. William Longman entered the firm as a partner. <QUOTE>Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts</QUOTE> became the style of the great publishing house, the founder of which commenced business <num value="144">one hundred and forty-four</num> years ago, at the house which became afterwards No. <num value="39">39</num>, Paternoster Row.
<p>In <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct>, a year before Goldsmith's death, Dr. Kenrick, a vulgar satirist of the day, wrote an anonymous letter in an evening paper called <title>The London Packet</title>, sneering at the poet's vanity, and calling <title>The Traveller</title> a flimsy poem, denying the <title>Deserted Village</title> genius, fancy, or fire, and calling <title>She Stoops to Conquer</title> the merest pantomime. Goldsmith's Irish blood fired at an allusion to Miss Horneck and his supposed rejection by her. Supposing Evans, of Paternoster Row, to be the editor of the <title>Packet</title>, Goldsmith resolved to chastise him. Evans, a brutal fellow, who turned his son out in the streets and separated from his wife because she took her son's part, denied all knowledge of the matter. As he turned his back to look for the libel, Goldsmith struck him sharply across the shoulders. Evans, a sturdy, hot Welshman, returned the blow with interest, and in the scuffle a lamp overhead was broken and covered the combatants with fish-oil. Dr. Kenrick then stepped from an adjoining room, interposed between the combatants, and sent poor Goldsmith home, bruised and disfigured, in a coach. Evans subsequently indicted Goldsmith for the assault, but the affair was compromised by Goldsmith paying <num value="50">50</num> towards a Welsh charity. The friend who accompanied Goldsmith to this chivalrous but unsuccessful attack is said to have been Captain Horneck, but it seems more probable that it was Captain Higgins, an Irish friend mentioned in <title>The Haunch of Venison.</title>

<p>Near the site of the present Dolly's Chop House stood the <QUOTE>Castle,</QUOTE> an ordinary kept by Shakespeare's friend and fellow actor, Richard Tarleton, the low comedian of Queen Elizabeth's reign. It was this humorous, ugly actor who no doubt suggested to the great manager many of his jesters, fools, and simpletons, and we know that the tag songs--such as that at the end <hi rend=italics>of All's Well that Ends Well</hi>, <QUOTE>When that I was a little tiny boy</QUOTE> --were expressly written for Tarleton, and were danced by that comedian to the tune <pb id="p.276" n="276"> of a pipe and a tabor which he himself played. The part which Tarleton had to play as host and wit is well shown in his <title>Book of Jests :</title>

<p> <QUOTE>Tarleton keeping an ordinary in Paternoster Row, and sitting with gentlemen to make them merry, would approve mustard standing before them to have wit.  <Q>How so?</Q>  saies <num value="1">one</num>.  <Q> It is like a witty scold meeting another scold, knowing that scold will scold, begins to scold <num value="1">first</num>. So,</Q>  says he,  <Q>the mustard being lickt up, and knowing that you will bite it, begins to bite you <num value="1">first</num>.</Q>   <Q>I'll try that,</Q>  saies a gull by, and the mustard so tickled him that his eyes watered.  <Q>How now?</Q>  saies Tarleton;  <Q>does my jest savour?</Q>   <Q>I,</Q>  saies the gull,  <Q> and bite too.</Q>   <Q>If you had had better wit,</Q>  saies Tarleton,  <Q>you would have bit <num value="1">first</num>; so, then, conclude with me, that dumbe unfeeling mustard hath more wit than a talking, unfeeling foole, as you are.</Q>  Some were pleased, and some were not; but all Tarleton's care was taken, for his resolution was ever, before he talkt any jest, to measure his opponent.</QUOTE>
<p>A modern antiquary has with great care culled from the <title>Gull's Horn Book</title> and other sources a sketch of the sort of company that might be met with at such an ordinary. It was the custom for men of fashion in the reign of Elizabeth and James to pace in St. Paul's till dinner-time, and after the ordinary again till the hour when the theatres opened. The author of <title>Shakespeare's England</title> says :
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>There were ordinaries of all ranks, the <hi rend=italics>table d&lsquo;hote</hi> being the almost universal mode of dining among those who were visitors to London during the season, or term-time, as it was then called. There was the twelvepenny ordinary, where you might meet justices of the peace and young knights; and the threepenny ordinary, which was frequented by poor lieutenants and thrifty attorneys. At the
<FIGURE id="Fig.276" n="2000.06.0100"><HEAD>Richard Tarleton, The Actor (copied from an old wood engraving) [see page <num value="275">275</num>].</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <num value="1">one</num> the rules of high society were maintained, and the large silver salt-cellar indicated the rank of the guests. At the other the diners were silent and unsociable, or the conversation, if any, was so full of <Q>amercements and feoffments</Q> that a mere countryman would have thought the people were conjuring.
<P>If a gallant entered the ordinary at about halfpast <num value="11">eleven</num>, or even a little earlier, he would find the room full of fashion-mongers, waiting for the meat to be served. There are men of all classes: titled men, who live cheap that they may spend more at Court; stingy men, who want to save the charges of house-keeping ; courtiers, who come there for society and news; adventurers, who have no home; Templars, who dine there daily; and men about town, who dine at whatever place is nearest to their hunger. Lords, citizens, concealed Papists, spies, prodigal &lsquo;prentices, precisians, aldermen, foreigners, officers, and country gentlemen, all are here. Some have come on foot, some on horseback, and some in those new caroches the poets laugh at.
<P>The well-bred courtier, on entering the room, saluted those of his acquaintances who were in winter gathered round the fire, in summer round the window, <num value="1">first</num> throwing his cloak to his page and hanging up his hat and sword. The parvenu would single out a friend, and walk up and down uneasily with the scorn and carelessness of a gentleman usher, laughing rudely and nervously, or obtruding himself into groups of gentlemen gathered round a wit or poet. Quarrelsome men pace about fretfully, fingering their sword-hilts and maintaining as sour a face as that Puritan moping in a corner, pent up by a group of young swaggerers, who are disputing over a card at gleek. Vain men, not caring whether it was Paul's, the Tennis Court, or the play-house, <hi rend=italics>published</hi> their clothes, and talked <pb id="p.277" n="277"> as loud as they could, in order to appear at ease, and laughed over the Water Poet's last epigram or the last pamphlet of Marprelate. The soldiers bragged of nothing but of their employment in Ireland and the Low Countries-how they helped Drake to burn St. Domingo, or grave Maurice to hold out Breda. Tom Coryatt, or such weakpated travellers, would babble of the Rialto and Prester John, and exhibit specimens of unicorns' horns or palm-leaves from the river Nilus. The courtier talked of the fair lady who gave him the glove which he wore in his hat as a favour; the poet of the last satire of Marston or Ben Jonson, or volunteered to read a trifle thrown off of late by  <Q> Faith, a learned gentleman, a very worthy friend,</Q>  though if we were to enquire, this varlet poet might turn out, after all, to be the mere decoy duck of the hostess, paid to draw gulls and fools thither. The mere dullard sat silent, playing with his glove or discussing at what apothecary's the best tobacco was to be bought.
<p>The dishes seemed to have been served up at these hot luncheons or early dinners in much the same order'as at the present day-meat, poultry, game, and pastry. <Q>To be at your woodcocks</Q>

<FIGURE id="Fig.277" n="2000.06.0101"><HEAD>Dolly's Coffee-House (see page <num value="278">278</num>).</HEAD></FIGURE>
 implied that you had nearly finished dinner. The more unabashable, rapid adventurer, though but a beggarly captain, would often attack the capon while his neighbour, the knight, was still encumbered with his stewed beef; and when the justice of the peace opposite, who has just pledged him in sack, is knuckle-deep in the goose, he falls stoutly on the long-billed game; while at supper, if <num value="1">one</num> of the college of critics, our gallant praised the last play or put his approving stamp upon the new poem.
<p>Primero and a  <Q>pair</Q>  of cards followed the wine. Here the practised player learnt to lose with endurance, and neither to tear the cards nor crush the dice with his heel. Perhaps the jest may be true, and that men sometimes played till they sold even their boards to cram tennis-balls or stuff cushions. The patron often paid for the wine or disbursed for the whole dinner. Then the drawer came round with his wooden knife, and scraped off the crusts and crumbs, or cleared off the parings of fruit and cheese into his basket. The torn cards were thrown into the fire, the guests rose, rapiers were re-hung, and belts buckled on. The post news was heard, and the reckonings paid. The French lackey and Irish footboy led out the <pb id="p.278" n="278"> hobby horses, and some rode off to the play, others to the river-stairs to take a pair of oars to the Surrey side.</QUOTE>

<p>The <QUOTE>Castle,</QUOTE> where Tarleton has so often talked of Shakespeare and his wit, perished in the Great Fire; but was afterwards rebuilt, and, here <QUOTE>The Castle Society of Music</QUOTE> gave their performances, no doubt aided by many of the St. Paul's Choir. Part of the old premises were subsequently (says Mr. Timbs) the Oxford Bible Warehouse, destroyed by fire in <datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>, and since rebuilt. <QUOTE>Dolly's Tavern,</QUOTE> which stood near the <QUOTE>Castle,</QUOTE> derived its name from
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.278.1">Dolly</lemma>. an old cook of the establishment, whose portrait Gainsborough painted. Bonnell Thornton mentions the beefsteaks and gill ale at <QUOTE>Dolly's.</QUOTE> The coffee-room, with its projecting fire-places, is as old as Queen Anne. The head of that queen is painted on a window at <QUOTE>Dolly's,</QUOTE> and the entrance in Queen's Head Passage is christened from this painting.
<p>The old taverns of London are to be found in the strangest nooks and corners, hiding away behind shops, or secreting themselves up alleys. Unlike the Paris <hi rend=italics>cafe</hi>, which delights in the free sunshine of the boulevard, and displays its harmless revellers to the passers-by, the London tavern aims at cosiness, quiet, and privacy. It partitions and curtains-off its guests as if they were conspirators and the wine they drank was forbidden by the law. Of such taverns the <QUOTE>Chapter</QUOTE> is a good example. .
<p>The <QUOTE>Chapter Coffee House,</QUOTE> at the corner of Chapter House Court, was in the last century famous for its punch, its pamphlets, and its newspapers. As lawyers and authors frequented the Fleet Street taverns, so booksellers haunted the <QUOTE>Chapter.</QUOTE> Bonnell Thornton, in the <title>Connoisseur,</title>
an., <datestruct value="1754--"><year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct>, says:-- <QUOTE>The conversation here naturally turns upon the newest publications, but their criticisms are somewhat singular. When they say
 <hi rend=italics>a good</hi> book they do not mean to praise the style or sentiment, but the quick and extensive sale of it. That book is best which sells most.</QUOTE>
<p>In <datestruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct> Chatterton, in <num value="1">one</num> of those apparently hopeful letters he wrote home while in reality his proud heart was breaking, says :-- <QUOTE>I am quite familiar at the  <Q> Chapter Coffee House,</Q>  and know all the geniuses there.</QUOTE> He desires a friend to send him whatever he has published, to be left at the <QUOTE>Chapter.</QUOTE> So, again, writing from the King's Bench, he says a gentleman whom he met at the <QUOTE>Chapter</QUOTE> had promised to introduce him as a travelling tutor to the young Duke of Northumberland; <QUOTE>but, alas! I spoke no tongue but my own.</QUOTE>
<p>Perhaps that very day Chatterton came, half starved, and listened with eager ears to great authors talking. Oliver Goldsmith dined, lthere, with Lloyd, that reckless friend of still more reckless Churchill, and some Grub Street cronies, and had to pay. for the lot, Lloyd having quite forgotten the important fact that he was moneyless. Goldsmith's favourite seat at the <QUOTE>Chapter</QUOTE> became a seat of honour, and was pointed out to visitors. Leather tokens of the coffee-house are still in existence.
<p>Mrs. Gaskell has sketched the <QUOTE>Chapter</QUOTE> in <datestruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></datestruct>, with its low heavy-beamed ceilings, wainscoted rooms, and its broad, dark, shallow staircase. She describes it as formerly frequented by university men, country clergymen, and country booksellers, who, friendless in London, liked to hear the literary chat. Few persons slept there, and in a long, low, dingy room up-stairs the periodical meetings of the trade were held. <QUOTE>The high, narrow windows looked into the gloomy Row.</QUOTE> Nothing of motion or of change could be seen in the grim, dark houses opposite, so near and close, although the whole width of the Row was between. The mighty roar of London ran round like the sound of an unseen ocean, yet every footfall on the pavement below might be heard distinctly in that unfrequented street.
<p>The frequenters of the <QUOTE>Chapter Coffee House</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>-<datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>) have been carefully described by Sir Richard Phillips. Alexander Stevens, editor of the <title>Annual Biography and Obituary,</title> was <num value="1">one</num> of the choice spirits who met nightly in the <QUOTE>Wittinagemot,</QUOTE> as it was called, or the northeast corner box in the coffee-room. The neighbours, who dropped in directly the morning papers arrived, and before they were dried by the waiter, were called the Wet Paper Club, and another set intercepted the wet evening papers. Dr. Buchan, author of that murderous book, <title>Domestic Medicine,</title> which treaches a man how to kill himself and family cheaply, generally acted as moderator. He was a handsome, white-haired man, a Tory, a good-humoured companion, and a <foreign lang=fr>bon vivant</foreign>. If any <num value="1">one</num> began to complain, or appear hypochondriacal, he used to say--
<p><QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Now let me prescribe for you, without a fee. Here, John, bring a glass of punch for Mr. unless, he likes brandy and water better. Now, take that, sir, and I'll warrant you'll soon be well. You're a peg too low; you want stimulus; and if <num value="1">one</num> glass won't do, call for a <num value="2">second</num>.</QUOTE>

<p>Dr. Gower, the urbane and able physician of the Middlesex Hospital, was another frequent visitor, as also that great eater and worker, Dr. Fordyce, whose balance no potations could disturb. <pb id="p.279" n="279"> Fordyce had fashionable practice, and brought rare news and much sound information on general subjects. He came to the <QUOTE>Chapter</QUOTE> from his wine, stayed about an hour, and sipped a glass of brandy and water. He then took another glass at the <QUOTE>London Coffee House,</QUOTE> and a <num value="3">third</num> at the <QUOTE>Oxford,</QUOTE> then wound home to his house in Essex Street, Strand. The <num value="3">three</num> doctors seldom agreed on medical subjects, and laughed loudly at each other's theories. They all, however, agreed in regarding the <QUOTE>Chapter</QUOTE> punch as an infallible and safe remedy for all ills.
<p>The standing men in the box were Hammond and Murray. Hammond, a Coventry manufacturer, had scarcely missed an evening at the <QUOTE>Chapter</QUOTE> for <num value="45">forty-five</num> years. His strictures on the events of the day were thought severe but able, and as a friend of liberty he had argued all through the times of Wilkes and the French and American wars. His Socratic arguments were very amusing. Mr. Murray, the great referee of the Wittinagemot, was a Scotch minister, who generally sat at the <QUOTE>Chapter</QUOTE> reading papers from <num value="9">9</num> a.m. to <measure value="9d." type=currency><num value="9">9</num> p.</measure>m. He was known to have read straight through every morning and evening paper published in London for <num value="30">thirty</num> years. His memory was so good that he was always appealed to for dates and matters of fact, but his mind was not remarkable for general lucidity. Other friends of Stevens's were Dr. Birdmore, the Master of the Charterhouse, who abounded in anecdote; Walker, the rhetorician and dictionarymaker, a most intelligent man, with a fine enunciation, and Dr. Towers, a political writer, who over his half-pint of Lisbon grew sarcastic and lively. Also a grumbling man named Dobson, who between asthmatic paroxysms vented his spleen on all sides. Dobson was an author and paradox-monger, but so devoid of principle that he was deserted by all his friends, and would have died from want, if Dr. Garthshore had not placed him as a patient in an empty fever hospital. Robinson, <QUOTE>the king of booksellers,</QUOTE> and his sensible brother John were also frequenters of the <QUOTE>Chapter,</QUOTE> as well as Joseph Johnson, the friend of Priestley, Paine, Cowper, and Fuseli, from St. Paul's Churchyard. Phillips, the speculative bookseller, then commencing his <title>Monthly Magazine,</title>
came to the <QUOTE>Chapter</QUOTE> to look out for recruits, and with his pockets well lined with guineas to enlist them. He used to describe all the odd characters at this coffee-house, from the glutton in politics, who waited at daylight for the morning papers, to the moping and disconsolate bachelor, who sat till the fire was raked out by the sleepy waiter at half-past <num value="12">twelve</num> at night. These strange figures succeeded each other regularly, like the figures in a magic lantern.
<p>Alexander Chalmers, editor of many works, enlivened the Wittinagemot by many sallies of wit and humour. He took great pains not to be mistaken for a namesake of his, who, he used to say, carried <QUOTE>the leaden mace.</QUOTE> Other <foreign lang=fr>habitu&eacute;s</foreign>
were the <num value="2">two</num> Parrys, of the <title>Courier</title> and <title>Jacobite</title>
papers, and Captain Skinner, a man of elegant manners, who represented England in the absurd procession of all nations, devised by that German revolutionary fanatic, Anacharsis Clootz, in Paris in <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>. Baker, an ex-Spitalfields manufacturer, a great talker and eater, joined the coterie regularly, till he shot himself at his lodgings in Kirby Street. It was discovered that his only meal in the day had been the nightly supper at the <QUOTE>Chapter,</QUOTE> at the fixed price of a shilling, with a supplementary pint of porter. When the shilling could no longer be found for the supper, he killed himself.
<p>Among other members of these pleasant coteries were Lowndes, the electrician; Dr. Busby, the musician; Cooke, the well-bred writer of conversation; and Macfarlane, the author of <title>The History of George III.,</title> who was eventually killed by a blow from the pole of a coach during an election procession of Sir Francis Burdett at Brentford. Another celebrity was a young man named Wilson, called Langton, from his stories of the <hi rend=italics>haut ton.</hi>
He ran up a score of <measure value="40l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="40">40</num></measure>, and then disappeared, to the vexation of Mrs. Brown, the landlady, who would willingly have welcomed him, even though he never paid, as a means of amusing and detaining customers. Waithman, the Common Councilman, was always clear-headed and agreeable. There was also Mr. Paterson, a long-headed, speculative North Briton, who had taught Pitt mathematics. But such coteries are like empires; they have their rise and their fall. Dr. Buchan died; some pert young sparks offended the Nestor, Hammond, who gave up the place, after <num value="45">forty-five</num> years' attend- Dance, and before <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct> the <QUOTE>Chapter</QUOTE> grew silent and dull.
<p>The <num value="4">fourth</num> edition of Dr.----ell's <title>Antient and Modern Geography,</title> says Nicholls, was published by an association of respectable booksellers, who about the year I <num value="719">719</num> entered into an especial partnership, for the purpose of printing some expensive works, and styled themselves <QUOTE>the Printing Conger.</QUOTE> he term <QUOTE>Conger</QUOTE> was supposed to have been at <num value="1">first</num> applied to them invidiously, alluding to the conger eel, which is said to swallow the smaller fry; or it may possibly have been taken from <hi rend=italics>congeries</hi>. The <QUOTE>Conger</QUOTE> met at the <QUOTE>Chapter.</QUOTE> <pb id="p.280" n="280">
<p>The <QUOTE>Chapter</QUOTE> closed as a coffee-house in <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>, and was altered into a tavern.
<p><num value="1">One</num> tragic memory, and <num value="1">one</num> alone, as far as we know, attaches to Paternoster Row. It was here, in the reign of James I., that Mrs. Anne Turner lived, at whose house the poisoning of Sir Thomas Overbury was planned. It was here that Viscount Rochester met the infamous Countess of Essex; and it was Overbury's violent opposition to this shameful intrigue that led to his death from arsenic and diamond-dust, administered in the Tower by Weston, a servant of Mrs. Turner's, who received <num value="180">180</num> &pound; for his trouble. Rochester and the Countess were disgraced, but their lives were spared. The Earl of Northampton, an accomplice of the countess, died before Overbury succumbed to his <num value="3">three</num> months of torture.
<p> <QUOTE>Mrs. Turner,</QUOTE> says Sir Simonds d&lsquo;Ewes, <QUOTE>had <num value="1">first</num> brought up that vain and foolish use of yellow starch, coming herself to her trial in a yellow band and cuffs; and therefore, when she was afterwards executed at Tyburn, the hangman had his band and cuffs of the same colour, which made many after that day, of either sex, to forbear the use of that coloured starch, till at last it grew generally to be detested and disused.</QUOTE>
<p>In a curious old print of West Chepe, date <datestruct value="1585"><year reg="1585">1585</year></datestruct>, in the vestry room of St. Vedast's, Foster Lane, we see St. Michael's, on the north side of Paternoster Row. It is a plain dull building, with a low square tower and pointed-headed windows. It was chiefly remarkable as the burial-place of that indefatigable antiquary, John Leland. This laborious man, educated at St. Paul's School, was <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest Greek scholars in England, and <num value="1">one</num> of the deepest students of Welsh and Saxon. Henry III. made him <num value="1">one</num> of his chaplains, bestowed on him several benefices, and gave him a roving commission to visit the ruins of England and Wales and inspect the records of collegiate and cathedral libraries. He spent <num value="6">six</num> years in this search, and collected a vast mass of material, then retired to his house in the parish of St. Michael-le-Quern to note and arrange his treasures. His mind, however, broke down under the load: he became insane, and died in that dreadful darkness of the soul, <datestruct value="1552--"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct>. His great work, <title>The Itinerary of Great Britain,</title> was not published till after his death. His large collections relating to London antiquities were, unfortunately for us, lost. The old church of <QUOTE>St. Michael ad Bladum,</QUOTE> says Strype, <QUOTE>or  <Q>at the Corn</Q>  (corruptly called the  <Q> Quern</Q> ) was so called because in place thereof was some time a cornmarket, stretching up west to the shambles. It seemeth that this church was <num value="1">first</num> builded about the reign of Edward III. Thomas Newton, <num value="1">first</num> parson there, was buried in the quire, in the year <datestruct value="1361"><year reg="1361">1361</year></datestruct>, which was the <num value="35">35th</num> of Edward III. At the east end of this church stood an old cross called the Old Cross in West-cheap, which was taken down in the <num value="13">13th</num> Richard II.; since the which time the said parish church was also taken down, but new builded and enlarged in the year <datestruct value="1430"><year reg="1430">1430</year></datestruct>; the <num value="8">8th</num> Henry VI., William Eastfield, mayor, and the commonalty, granting of the common soil of the City <num value="3">three</num> foot and a half in breadth on the north part, and <num value="4">four</num> foot in breadth towards the east, for the inlarging thereof. This church was repaired, and with all things either for use or beauty, richly supplied and furnished, at the sole cost and charge of the parishioners, in <datestruct value="1617--"><year reg="1617">1617</year></datestruct>. This church was burnt down in the Great Fire, and remains unbuilt, and laid into the street, but the conduit which was formerly at the east end of the church still remains. The parish is united to St. Vedast, Foster Lane. At the east end of this church, in place of the old cross, is now a water-conduit placed. William Eastfield, maior, the <num value="9">9th</num> Henry VI., at the request of divers common councels, granted it so to be. Whereupon, in the igth of the said Henry, <measure value="1000bmark" type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num> marks</measure> was granted by a common councel towards the works of this conduit, and the reparation of others. This is called the Little. Conduit in West Cheap, by Paul's Gate. At the west end of this parish church is a small passage for. people on foot, thorow the same church; and west from the same church, some distance, is another passage out of Paternoster Row, and is called (of such a sign) Panyer Alley, which cometh out into the north, over against St. Martin's Lane.

</LIST></ARGUMENT>

<P>We have already made passing mention of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.281.1">Baynard's Castle</lemma>, the grim fortress near Blackfriars Bridge, immediately below St. Paul's, where for several centuries after the Conquest, Norman barons held their state, and behind its stone ramparts maintained their petty sovereignty.
<p>This castle took its name from Ralph Baynard, <num value="1">one</num> of those greedy and warlike Normans who came over with the Conqueror, who bestowed on him many marks of favour, among others the.substantial gift of the barony of Little Dunmow, in Essex. This chieftain built the castle, which deprived its name from him, and, dying in the reign of Rufus, the castle descended to his grandson, Henry Baynard, who in <datestruct value="1111--"><year reg="1111">1111</year></datestruct>, however, forfeited it to the Crown for taking part with Helias, Earl of Mayne, who endeavoured to wrest his Norman possessions from Henry I The angry king bestowed the barony and castle of Baynard, with all its honours, on Robert Fitzgerald, son of Gilbert, Earl of Clare,his steward and cup-bearer. Robert's son, Walter, adhered to William de Longchamp, Bishop of Ely, against John, Earl of Moreton, brother of Richard Cceur de Lion. He, however, kept tight hold of the river-side castle, which duly descended to Robert, his son, who in <datestruct value="1213--"><year reg="1213">1213</year></datestruct> became castellan and standard-bearer of the city. On this same banneret, in the midst of his pride and prosperity, there fell a great sorrow. The licentious tyrant, John, who spared none who crossed his passions, fell in love with Matilda, Fitz-Walter's fair daughter, and finding neither father nor daughter compliant to his will, John accused the castellan of abetting the discontented barons, and attempted his arrest. But the riverside fortress was convenient for escape, and Fitz- Walter flew to France. Tradition says that in <datestruct value="1214--"><year reg="1214">1214</year></datestruct>
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.281.2">King John</lemma><NOTE resp=B>

<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.281.3">Tomb of John</LEMMA></NOTE>
invaded France, but that after a time a truce was made between the <num value="2">two</num> nations for <num value="5">five</num> years. There was a river, or arm of the sea, flowing between the French and English tents, and across this flood an English knight, hungry for a fight, called out to the soldiers of the Fleur de Lis to come over and try a joust or <num value="2">two</num> with him. At once Robert Fitz-Walter, with his visor down, ferried over alone with his barbed horse, and mounted ready for the fray. At the <num value="1">first</num> course he struck John's knight so fiercely with his great spear, that both man and steed came rolling in a clashing heap to the ground. Never was spear better broken; and when the squires had gathered up their discomfited master, and the supposed French knight had recrossed the ferry, King John, who delighted in a well-ridden course, cried out, with his usual oath, <QUOTE>By God's sooth, he were a king indeed who had such a knight!</QUOTE> Then the friends of the banished man seized their opportunity, and came running to the usurper, and knelt down and said, <QUOTE><num value="0">0</num> king, he is your knight; it was Robert Fitz-Walter who ran that joust.</QUOTE> Whereupon John, who could be generous when he could gain anything by it, sent the next day for the good knight, and restored him to his favour, allowed him to rebuild Baynard's Castle, which had been demolished by royal order, and made him, moreover, governor of the Castle of Hertford.
<p>But .Fitz-Walter could not forget the grave of his daughter, still green at Dunmow (for Matilda, indomitable in her chastity, had been poisoned by a messenger of John's, who sprinkled a deadly <pb id="p.282" n="282"> powder over a poached egg-at least, so the legend runs), and soon placed himself at the head of those brave barons who the next year forced the tyrant afterwards chosen general of the barons' army, to keep John to his word, and styled <QUOTE>Marshal of the Army of God and of the Church.</QUOTE> He then  (not having had knocks enough in England) joined the Crusaders, and was present at the great siege of Damietta. In <datestruct value="1216--"><year reg="1216">1216</year></datestruct> (the <num value="1">first</num> year of Henry III.) Fitz-Walter again appears to the front, watchful of English liberty, for his Castle of Hertford having been delivered to Louis of France, the dangerous ally of the barons, he required of the French to leave the same, because the keeping thereof did by ancient right and title pertain to him. <QUOTE>On which Louis,</QUOTE> says Stow, prematurely showing his claws, replied scornfully <QUOTE>that Englishmen were not worthy to have such holds in keeping, because they did betray their own lord;</QUOTE> but Louis not long after left England rather suddenly, accelerated no doubt by certain movements of Fitz-Walter and his brother barons.
<p>Fitz-Walter dying, and being buried at Dunmow, the scene of his joys and sorrows, was succeeded by his son Walter, who was summoned to Chester in the <num value="43">forty-third</num> year of Henry III., to repel the fierce and half-savage Welsh from the English frontier. After Walter's death the barony of Bay nard was in the wardship of Henry III. during the minority of Robert Fitz-Walter, who in <datestruct value="1303--"><year reg="1303">1303</year></datestruct> claimed his right as castellan and banner-bearer of the City of London before John Blandon, or Blount, Mayor of London. The old formularies on which FitzWalter founded his claims are quoted by Stow from an old record which is singularly quaint and picturesque. The chief clauses run thus:
<FIGURE id="Fig.282" n="2000.06.0102"><HEAD>The Figure In Panier Alley (see page <num value="280">280</num>).</HEAD></FIGURE>

<P> <QUOTE>The said Robert and his heirs are and ought to be chief bannerets of London in fee, for the chastiliary which he and his ancestors had by to sign Magna Charta at Runnymede. He was Castle Baynard in the said city. In time of war the said Robert and his heirs ought to serve the city in manner as followeth--that is, the said Robert ought to come, he being the <num value="20">twentieth</num> man of arms, on horseback, covered with cloth or armour, unto the great west door of St. Paul's, with his banner displayed before him, and when he is so come, mounted and apparelled, the mayor, with his aldermen and sheriffs armed with their arms, shall come out of the said church with a banner in his hand, all on foot, which banner shall be gules, the image of St. Paul gold, the face, hands, feet, and sword of silver; and as soon as the earl seeth the mayor come on foot out of the church, bearing such a banner, he shall alight from his horse and salute the mayor, saying unto him,  <Q>Sir mayor, I am come to do my service which I owe to the city.</Q>  And the mayor and aldermen shall reply,  <Q>We give to you as our banneret of fee in this city the banner of this city, to bear and govern, to the honour of this city to your power;</Q>  and the earl, taking the banner in his hands, shall go on foot out of the gate; and the mayor and his company following to the door, shall bring a horse to the said Robert, value <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> pounds</measure>, which horse shall be saddled with a saddle of the arms of the said earl, and shall be covered with sindals of the said arms. Also, they shall present him a purse of <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> pounds</measure>, delivering it to his chamberlain, for his charges that day.</QUOTE>
<P>The record goes on to say that when Robert is mounted on his <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> horse, banner in hand, he shall require the mayor to appoint a City Marshal (we have all seen him with his cocked hat and subdued. <pb id="p.283" n="283"> commander-in-chief manner), <QUOTE>and the commons shall then assemble under the banner of St. Paul, Robert bearing the banner to Aldgate, and then delivering it up to some fit person. And if the army have to go out of the city, Robert shall choose <num value="2">two</num> sage persons out of every ward to keep the city in the absence of the army.</QUOTE> And these guardians were to be chosen in the priory of the Trinity, near Aldgate. And for every town or castle which the Lord of London besieged, if the siege continued a whole year, the said Robert was to receive for every siege, of the commonalty, <measure value="100s." type=currency><num value="100">one hundred</num> shillings</measure> and no more. These were Robert Fitz-Walter's rights in times of war; in times of peace his rights were also clearly defined. His sok or ward in the City began at a wall of St. Paul's canonry, which led down by the brewhouse of St. Paul's to the river Thames, and so to the side of a wall, which was in the water coming down from Fleet Bridge. The ward went on by London Wall, behind the house of the Black Friars, to Ludgate, and it included all the parish of St. Andrew. Any of his sokemen indicted at the Guildhall of any offence not touching the body
<FIGURE id="Fig.283" n="2000.06.0103"><HEAD>The Church Of St. Michael Ad Bladum (see page <num value="280">280</num>).</HEAD></FIGURE>
 of the mayor or sheriff, was to be tried in the court of the said Robert.
<p> <QUOTE>If any, therefore, be taken in his sokemanry, he must have his stocks and imprisonment in his soken, and he shall be brought before the mayor and judgment given him, but it must not be published till he come into the court of the said earl, and in his liberty; and if he have deserved death by treason, he is to be tied to a post in the Thames, at a good wharf, where boats are fastened, <num value="2">two</num> ebbings and <num value="2">two</num> flowings of the water (!) And if he be condemned for a common theft, he ought to be led to the elms, and there suffer his judgment as other thieves. And so the said earl hath honour, that he holdeth a great franchise within the city, that the mayor must do him right; and when he holdeth a great council, he ought to call the said Robert, who should be sworn thereof, against all people, saving the king and his heirs. And when he cometh to the hustings at Guildhall, the mayor ought to rise against him, and sit down near him, so long as he remaineth, all judgments being given by his mouth, according to the records of the said Guildhall; and the waifes that come while he <pb id="p.284" n="284"> stayeth, he ought to give them to the town bailiff, or to whom he will, by the counsel of the mayor.</QUOTE>
<p>This old record seems to us especially quaint and picturesque. The right of banner-bearer to the City of London was evidently a privilege not to be despised by even the proudest Norman baron, however numerous were his men-at-arms, however thick the forest of lances that followed at his back. t the gates of many a refractory Essex or Hertfordshire castle, no doubt, the Fitz-Walters flaunted that great banter, that was emblazoned with the image of St. Paul, with golden face and silver feet; and the horse valued at <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure>, and the pouch with <num value="20">twenty</num> golden pieces, must by no means have lessened the zeal and pride of the City castellan as he led on his trusty archers, or urged forward the half-stripped, sinewy men, who toiled at the catapult, or bent down the mighty springs of the terrible mangonel. Many a time through Aldgate must the castellan have passed with glittering armour and flaunting plume, eager to earn his <measure value="100s." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> shillings</measure> by the siege of a rebellious town.
<p>Then Robert was knighted by Edward I., and the family continued in high honour and reputation through many troubles and public calamities. In the reign of Henry VI., when the male branch died out, Anne, the heiress, married into the Ratcliffe family, who revived the title of Fitz-Walter.
<p>It is not known how this castle came to the Crown, but certain it is that on its being consumed by fire in <datestruct value="1428--"><year reg="1428">1428</year></datestruct> (Henry VI.), it was rebuilt by Humphrey, the good duke of Gloucester. On his death it was made a royal residence by Henry VI., and by him granted to the Duke of York, his luckless rival, who lodged here with his factious retainers during the lulls in the wars of York and Lancaster. In the year <datestruct value="1460"><year reg="1460">1460</year></datestruct>, the Earl of March, lodging in Castle Baynard, was informed that his army and the Earl of Warwick had declared that Henry VI. was no longer worthy to reign, and had chosen him for their king. The earl coquetted, as usurpers often do, with these offers of the crown, declaring his insufficiency for so great a charge, till yielding to the exhortations of the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Exeter, he at last consented. On the next day he went to St. Paul's in procession, to hear the <title>Te Deum</title>, and was then conveyed in state to Westminster, and there, in the Hall, invested with the sceptre by the confessor.
<p>At Baynard's Castle, too, that cruel usurper,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.284.1">Richard III</lemma>.practised the same arts as his predecessor. Shakespeare, who has darkened Richard almost to caricature, has left him the greatest wretch existing in fiction. At Baynard's Castle our great poet makes Richard receive his accomplice Buckingham, who had come from the Guildhall with the Lord Mayor and aldermen to press him to accept the crown; Richard is found by the credulous citizens with a book of prayer in his hand, standing between <num value="2">two</num> bishops. This man, who was already planning the murder of Hastings and the <num value="2">two</num> princes in the Tower, affected religious scruples, and with well-feigned reluctance accepted <QUOTE>the golden yoke of sovereignty.</QUOTE>
<p>Thus at Baynard's Castle begins that darker part of the Crookback's career, which led on by crime after crime to the desperate struggle at Bosworth, when, after slaying his rival's standard-bearer, Richard was beaten down by swords and axes, and his crown struck off into a hawthorn bush. The defaced corpse of the usurper, stripped and gory, was, as the old chroniclers tell us, thrown over a horse and carried by a faithful herald to be buried at Leicester. It is in vain that modern writers try to prove that Richard was gentle and accomplished, that this murder attributed to him was profitless and impossible; his name will still remain in history blackened and accursed by charges, that the great poet has turned into truth, and which, indeed, are difficult to refute. That Richard might have become a great, and wise, and powerful king, is possible; but that he hesitated to commit crimes to clear his way to the throne, which had so long been struggled for by the Houses of York and Lancaster. truth forbids us for a moment to doubt. e seems tq have been <num value="1">one</num> of those dark, wily natures that do not trust even their most intimate accomplices, and to have worked in such darkness that only the angels know what blows he struck, or what murders he planned. <num value="1">One</num> thing is certain, that Henry, Clarence, Hastings, and the princes died in terribly quick succession, and at most convenient moments.
<p>Henry VIII. expended large sums in turning Baynard's Castle from a fortress into a palace. He frequently lodged there in burly majesty, and entertained there the King of Castile, who was driven to England by a tempest. The castle then became the property of the Pembroke family, and here, in <datestruct VALUE="1553-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>, the council was held in which it was resolved to proclaim Mary Queen of England, which was at once done at the Cheapside Cross by sound of trumpet.
<p>Queen Elizabeth, who delighted to honour her special favourites, once supped at Baynard's Castle with the earl, and afterwards went on the river to show herself to her loyal subjects. It is particularly mentioned that the queen returned to her palace at <num value="10">ten</num> o'clock. <pb id="p.285" n="285">
<p>The Earls of Shrewsbury afterwards occupied the castle, and resided there till it was burnt in the Great Fire. On its site stand the Carron works and the wharf of the Castle Baynard Copper Company.
<NOTE resp=B>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.285.1">Vicar General's Office</lemma></NOTE>

<p>Adjoining Baynard's Castle once stood a tower built by King Edward II., and bestowed by him on William de Ross, for a rose yearly, paid in lieu of all other services. The tower was in later times called <QUOTE>the Legates' Tower.</QUOTE> Westward of this stood Montfichet Castle, and eastward of Baynard's Castle the Tower Royal and the Tower of London, so that the Thames was well guarded from Ludgate to the citadel. All round this neighbourhood, in the Middle Ages, great families clustered. There was Beaumont Inn, near Paul's Wharf, which, on the attainder of Lord Bardolf, Edward IV. bestowed on his favourite, Lord Hastings, whose death Richard III. (as we have seen) planned at his very door. It was afterwards Huntingdon House. Near Trigg Stairs the Abbot of Chertsey had a mansion, afterwards the residence of Lord Sandys. West of Paul's Wharf (Henry VI.) was Scroope's Inn, and near that a house belonging to the Abbey of Fescamp, given by Edward III. to. Sir Thomas Burley. In Carter Lane was the mansion of the Priors of Okeborne, in Wiltshire, and not far from the present Puddle Dock was the great mansion of the Lords of Berkley, where, in the reign of Henry VI., the kingmaking Earl of Warwick kept tremendous state, with a <num value="1000">thousand</num> swords ready to fly out if he even raised a finger.
<p>And now, leaving barons, usurpers, and plotters, we come to the Dean's Court archway of Doctors' Commons, the portal guarded by ambiguous touters for licences, men in white aprons, who look half like confectioners, and half like disbanded watermen. Here is the college of Doctors of Law, provided for the ecclesiastical lawyers in the early part of Queen Elizabeth's reign by Master Henry Harvey, Master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, Prebendary of Ely, and Dean of the Arches; according to Sir George Howes, <QUOTE>a reverend, learned, and good man.</QUOTE> The house had been inhabited by Lord Mountjoy, and .
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.285.2">Dr. Harvey</lemma>. obtained a lease of it for <num value="100">one hundred</num> years of the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's, for the annual rent of <measure value="5bmark" type=currency><num value="5">five</num> marks</measure>. Before this the civilians and canonists had lodged in a small inconvenient house in Paternoster Row, afterwards the <QUOTE>Queen's Head Tavern.</QUOTE> Cardinal Wolsey, always magnificent in his schemes, had planned a <QUOTE>fair college of stone</QUOTE> for the ecclesiastical lawyers, the plan of which Sir Robert Cotton possessed. In this college, in <datestruct value="1631--"><year reg="1631">1631</year></datestruct>, says Buc, the Master of the Revels, lived, in commons with the Judge of the High Court of Admiralty, being a doctor of civil law, the Dean of the Arches, the Judges of the Court of Delegates, the Vicar-General, and the Master or Custos of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury.
<p>Doctors' Commons, says Strype, <QUOTE>consists of <num value="5">five</num> courts-<num value="3">three</num> appertaining to the see of Canterbury, <num value="1">one</num> to the see of London, and <num value="1">one</num> to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralties.</QUOTE> The functions of these several courts he thus defines :
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Here are the courts kept for the practice of civil or ecclesiastical causes. Several offices are also here kept; as the Registrary of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Registrary of the Bishop of London.
<p>The causes whereof the civil and ecclesiastical law take cognisance are those that follow, as they are enumerated in the  <Q>Present State of Eng. land :</Q> Blasphemy, apostacy from Christianity, heresy, schism, ordinations, institutions of clerks to benefices, celebration of Divine service, matrimony, divorces, bastardy, tythes, oblations, obventions, mortuaries, dilapidations, reparation of churches, probate of wills, administrations, simony, incests, fornications, adulteries, solicitation of chastity; pensions, procurations, commutation of penance, right of pews, and other such like, reducible to those matters.
<p>The courts belonging to the civil and eccle- --siastical laws are divers.
<p><num value="1">First</num>, the Court of <hi rend=italics>Arches</hi>, which is the highest court belonging to the Archbishop of Canterbury. t was a court formerly kept in Bow Church in Cheapside; and the church and tower thereof being arched, the court was from thence called
 <hi rend=italics>The Arches</hi>, and so still is called. Hither are all appeals directed in ecclesiastical matters within the province of Canterbury. To this court belongs a judge who is called <hi rend=italics>The Dean of the Arches</hi>, so styled because he hath a jurisdiction over a deanery in London, consisting of <num value="13">thirteen</num> parishes exempt from the jurisdiction of the Bishop of London. This court hath (besides this judge) a registrar or examiner, an actuary, a beadle or crier, and an apparitor; besides advocates and procurators or proctors. These, after they be once admitted by warrant and commission directed from the Archbishop, and by the Dean of the Arches, may then (and not before) exercise as advocates and proctors there, and in any other courts.
<p>Secondly, the Court of <hi rend=italics>Audience</hi>. This was a court likewise of the Archbishop's, which he used to hold in his own house, where he received causes, complaints, and appeals, and had learned civilians <pb id="p.286" n="286"> living with him, that were auditors of the said causes before the Archbishop gave sentence. This court was kept in later times in St. Paul's. The judge belonging to this court was stiled <QUOTE lang=la>Causarum, negotiorumque Cantuarien, auditor officialis.</QUOTE> It had also other officers, as the other courts.
<p>Thirdly, the next court for civil causes belonging to the Archbishop is the <hi rend=italics>Prerogative</hi> Court, wherein wills and testaments are proved, and all administrations taken, which belongs to the Archbishop by his prerogative, that is, by a special pre-eminence that this see hath in certain causes above ordinary bishops within his province; this takes place where the deceased hath goods to the value of <measure value="5l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5">5</num></measure> out of the diocese, and being of the diocese of London, to the value of <num value="10">10</num>. If any contention grow, touching any such wills or administrations, the causes are debated and decided in this court.
<p>Fourthly, the Court of <hi rend=italics>Faculties and Dispensations</hi>, whereby a privilege or special power is granted to a person by favour and indulgence to do that which by law otherwise he could not: as, to marry, without banns <num value="1">first</num> asked in the church <num value="3">three</num> several Sundays or holy days; the son to succeed his father in his benefice; for <num value="1">one</num> to have <num value="2">two</num> or more benefices incompatible; for non-residence, and in other such like cases.
<p>Fifthly, the Court of <hi rend=italics>Admiralty</hi>, which was erected in the reign of Edward III. This court belongs to the Lord High Admiral of England, a high officer that hath the government of the king's navy, and the hearing of all causes relating to merchants and mariners. He takes cognisance of the death or mayhem of any man committed in the great ships riding in great rivers, beneath the bridges of the same next the sea. Also he hath power to arrest ships in great streams for the use of the king, or his wars. And in these things this court is concerned.
<p>To these I will add the Court of <hi rend=italics>Delegates;</hi>
to which high court appeals do lie from any of the former courts. This is the highest court for civil causes. It was established by an Act in the <num value="25">25th</num> Henry VIII., cap. <num value="19">19</num>, wherein it was enacted,  <QUOTE>That it should be lawful, for lack of justice at or in any of the Archbishop's courts, for the parties grieved to appeal to the King's Majesty in his Court of Chancery; and that, upon any such appeal, a commission under the Great Seal should be directed to such persons as should be named by the king's highness (like as in case of appeal from the Admiralty Court), to determine such appeals, and the cases concerning the same. And no further appeals to be had or made from the said commissioners for the same.</QUOTE>  These commissioners are appointed judges only for that turn; and they are commonly of the spiritualty, or bishops; of the common law, as judges of Westminster Hall; as well as those of the civil law. And these are mixed <num value="1">one</num> with another, according to the nature of the cause.
<p>Lastly, sometimes a Commission of <hi rend=italics>Review</hi> is granted by the king under the Broad Seal, to consider and judge again what was decreed in the Court of Delegates. But this is but seldom, and upon great, and such as shall be judged just, causes by the Lord Keeper or High Chancellor. And this done purely by the king's prerogative, since by the Act for Delegates no further appeals were to be laid or made from those commissioners, as was mentioned before.</QUOTE>

<p>The Act <num value="20">20</num> & <num value="21">21</num> Vict., cap. <num value="77">77</num>, called <QUOTE>The Court of Probate Act, <datestruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE> received the royal assent on the <datestruct VALUE="1857-08-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1857">1857</year></datestruct>. This is the great act which established the Court of Probate, and abolished the jurisdiction Of the courts ecclesiastical.
<p>The following, says Mr. Forster, are some of the benefits resulting from the reform of the Ecclesiastical Courts:--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><p>That reform has reduced the depositaries for wills in this country from nearly <num value="400">400</num> to <num value="40">40</num>.
<p>It has brought complicated testamentary proceedings into a system governed by <num value="1">one</num> vigilant court.
<p>It has relieved the public anxiety respecting <Q>the doom of English wills</Q> by placing them in the custody of responsible men.
<p>It has thrown open the courts of law to the entire legal profession.
<p>It has given the public the right to prove wills or obtain letters of administration without professional assistance.
<p>It has given to literary men an interesting field for research.
<p>It has provided that which ancient Rome is said to have possessed, but which London did not possess--viz., a place of deposit for the wills of living persons.
<p>It has extended the English favourite mode of trial-viz., trial by jury-by admitting jurors to try the validity of wills and questions of divorce.
<p>It has made divorce not a matter of wealth but of justice: the wealthy and the poor alike now only require a clear case and <Q>no collusion.</Q>

<p>It has enabled the humblest wife to obtain a <Q>protection order</Q> for her property against an unprincipled husband.
<p>It has afforded persons wanting to establish legitimacy, the validity of marriages, and the right to be deemed natural born subjects, the means of so doing.
<p>Amongst its minor benefits it has enabled persons needing copies of wills which have been proved since <datestruct VALUE="1858-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1858">1858</year></datestruct>, in any part of the country, to obtain them from the principal registry of the Court of Probate in Doctors' Commons.</QUOTE>

<P>A writer in Knight's <title>London</title> (<datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>) gives a pleasant sketch of the Court of Arches in that year. he Common Hall, where the Court of Arches, the Prerogative Court, the Consistory Court, and the Admiralty Court all held their sittings, was a comfortable place, with dark polished wainscoting reaching high up the walls, while above hung the richly emblazoned arms of learned doctors dead and gone; the fire burned cheerily in the central stove. The dresses of the unengaged advocates in scarlet and ermine, and of the proctors in ermine and black, were picturesque. The opposing advocates sat in high galleries, and the absence of prisoner's dock and jury-box-nay, even of a public-impressed the stranger with a sense of agreeable novelty.
<p>Apropos of the Court of Arches once held in Bow Church. <QUOTE>The Commissary Court of Surrey,</QUOTE> says Mr. Jeaffreson, in his <title>Book about the Clergy,</title> <QUOTE>still holds sittings in the Church of St. Saviour's, Southwark; and any of my London readers, who are at the small pains to visit that noble church during a sitting of the Commissary's Court, may ascertain for himself that, notwithstanding our reverence for consecrated places, we can still use them as chambers of justice. The court, of course, is a spiritual court, but the great, perhaps the greater, part of the business transacted at its sittings is of an essentially secular kind.</QUOTE>
<p>The nature of the business in the Court of Arches may be best shown by the brief summary given in the report for <num value="3">three</num> years--<datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, <datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>, and <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>. There were <num value="21">21</num> matrimonial cases; <num value="1">1</num> of defamation; <num value="4">4</num> of brawling; <num value="15">15</num> church-smiting; <num value="1">1</num> church-rate; <num value="1">1</num> legacy; <num value="1">1</num> tithes; <num value="4">4</num> correction. f these <num value="17">17</num> were appeals from the courts, and <num value="21">21</num> original suits.
<p>The cases in the Court of Arches were often very trivial. <QUOTE>There was a case,</QUOTE> says Dr. Nicholls, <QUOTE>in which the cause had originally commenced in the Archdeacon's Court at Totnes, and thence there had been an appeal to the Court at Exeter, thence to the Arches, and thence, to the Delegates; after all, the issue having been simply, which of <num value="2">two</num> persons had the right of hanging his hat on a particular peg.</QUOTE> The other is of a sadder cast, and calculated to arouse a just indignation. Our authority is Mr. T. W. Sweet (Report on Eccles. Courts), who states: <QUOTE>In <num value="1">one</num> instance, many years since, a suit was instituted which I thought produced a great deal of inconvenience and distress. t was the case of a person of the name of Russell, whose wife was supposed to have had her character impugned at Yarmouth by a Mr. Bentham. He had no remedy at law for the attack upon the lady's character, and a suit for defamation was <pb id="p.288" n="288"> instituted in the Commons. It was supposed the suit would be attended with very little expense, but I believe in the end it greatly contributed to ruin the party who instituted it; I think he said his proctor's bill would be <num value="700">700</num>. It went through several courts, and ultimately, I believe (according to the decision or agreement), each party paid his own costs.</QUOTE> It appears from the evidence subsequently given by the proctor, that he very humanely declined pressing him for payment, and never was paid; and yet the case, through the continued anxiety and loss of time incurred for <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num> years (for the suit lasted that time), mainly contributed, it appears, to the party's ruin.
<p>As the law once stood, says a writer in Knight's
<title>London,</title> if a person died possessed of property
<FIGURE id="Fig.288" n="2000.06.0104"><HEAD>The Prerogative Office, Doctors' Commons.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 lying entirely within the diocese where he died probate or proof of the will is made, or administration taken out, before the bishop or ordinary of that diocese; but if there were goods and chattels only to the amount of <num value="5">5</num> (except in the diocese of London, where the amount is <num value="10">10</num>) --in legal parlance, <QUOTE lang=la>bona notabilia</QUOTE>--within any other diocese, and which is generally the case, then the jurisdiction lies in the Prerogative Court of the Archbishop of the province--that is, either at York or at Doctors' Commons; the latter, we need hardly say, being the Court of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The <num value="2">two</num> Prerogative Courts therefore engross the great proportion of the business of this kind through the country, for although the Ecclesiastical Courts have no power over the bequests of or <pb id="p.289" n="289"> succession to unmixed real property, if such were.left, cases of that nature seldom or never occur. And, as between the <num value="2">two</num> provinces, not only is that of Canterbury much more important and extensive, but since the introduction of the funding system, and the extensive diffusion of such property, nearly all wills of importance belonging even to the Province of York are also proved in Doctors' Commons, on account of the rule of the Bank of England to acknowledge no probate of wills but from thence. To this cause, amongst others, may be attributed the striking fact that the business of this court between the <num value="3">three</num> years ending with <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>, and the <num value="3">three</num> years ending with <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>, had been doubled. Of the vast number of persons affected, or at least interested in this business, we see not only from the crowded rooms, but also from the statement given in the report of the select committee on the Admiralty and other Courts of Doctors' Commons in <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, where it appears that in <num value="1">one</num> year (<datestruct value="1829"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>) the number of searches amounted to

<P>According to Sir Herbert Jenner Fust, Lord Stowell's decisions during the war have since formed a code of international law, almost universally recognised. In <num value="1">one</num> year alone (<datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>) he pronounced <num value="2206">2,206</num> decrees. Lord Stowell (then Dr. Scott) was made Advocate-General in Doctors' Commons in z <num value="788">788</num>. and Vicar-General or official principal for the <pb id="p.290" n="290"> Archbishop of Canterbury. Soon after he became Master of the Faculties, and in <datestruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct> was nominated Judge of the High Court of Admiralty, the highest dignity of the Doctors' Commons Courts. During the great French war, it is said Dr. Scott sometimes received as much as <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> a case for fees and perquisites in a prize cause. He left at his death personal property exceeding <measure value="200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200000">200,000</num></measure>. He used to say that he admired above all other investments <QUOTE>the sweet simplicity of the <num value="3">Three</num> per Cents.,</QUOTE> and when purchasing estate after estate, observed <QUOTE>he liked plenty of elbow-room.</QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>It was,</QUOTE> says Warton, <QUOTE>by visiting Sir Robert Chambers, when a fellow of University, that Johnson became acquainted with Lord Stowell; and when Chambers went to India, Lord Stowell, as he expressed it to me, seemed to succeed to his place in Johnson's friendship.</QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>Sir William Scott (Lord Stowell),</QUOTE> says Boswell, <QUOTE>told me that when he complained of a headache in the post-chaise, as they were travelling together to Scotland, Johnson treated him in a rough manner - <Q>At your age, sir, I had no headache.</Q> </QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>Mr. Scott's amiable manners and attachment to our Socrates,</QUOTE> says Boswell in Edinburgh, <QUOTE>at once united me to him. He told me that before I came in the doctor had unluckily had a bad specimen of Scottish cleanliness. He then drank no fermented liquor. He asked to have his lemonade made sweeter; upon which the waiter, with his greasy fingers, lifted a lump of sugar and put it into it. The doctor, in indignation, threw it out. Scott said he was afraid he would have knocked the waiter down.</QUOTE>
<p>Again Boswell says :-- <QUOTE>We dined together with Mr. Scott, now Sir William Scott, his Majesty's Advocate-General, at his chambers in the Temple --nobody else there. The company being so small, Johnson was not in such high spirits as he had been the preceding day, and for a considerable time little was said. At last he burst forth- <Q> Subordination is sadly broken down in this age. No man, now, has the same authority which his father had-except a gaoler. No master has it over his servants; it is diminished in our colleges; nay, in our grammar schools.</Q> </QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>Sir William Scott informs me that on the death of the late Lord Lichfield, who was Chancellor of the University of Oxford, he said to Johnson,  <Q>What a pity it is, sir, that you did not follow the profession of the law! You might have been Lord Chancellor of Great Britain, and attained to the dignity of the peerage; and now that the title of Lichfield, your native city, is extinct, you might have had it.</Q>  Johnson upon this seemed much agitated, and in an angry tone exclaimed,  <Q>Why will you vex me by suggesting this when it is too late?</Q> </QUOTE>
<p>The strange marriage of Lord Stowell and the Marchioness of Sligo has been excellently described by Mr. Jeaffreson in his <title>Book of Lawyers.</title>

<p> <QUOTE>On <datestruct VALUE="1813-04-10"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=10>10</day>, <year reg=1813>1813</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE> says our author, <QUOTE>the decorous Sir William Scott, and Louisa Catherine, widow of John, Marquis of Sligo, and daughter of Admiral Lord Howe, were united in the bonds of holy wedlock, to the infinite amusement of the world of fashion, and to the speedy humiliation of the bridegroom. So incensed was Lord Eldon at his brother's folly that he refused to appear at the wedding; and certainly the chancellor's displeasure was not without reason, for the notorious absurdity of the affair brought ridicule on the whole of the Scott family connection. The happy couple met for the <num value="1">first</num> time in the Old Bailey, when Sir William Scott and Lord Ellenborough presided at the trial of the marchioness's son, the young Marquis of Sligo, who had incurred the anger of the law by luring into his yacht, in Mediterranean waters, <num value="2">two</num> of the king's seamen. Throughout the hearing of that <hi rend=italics>cause celebre</hi>, the Marchioness sat in the fetid court of the Old Bailey, in the hope that her presence might rouse amongst the jury or in the bench feelings favourable to her son. This hope was disappointed. The verdict having been given against the young peer, he was ordered to pay a fine of <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure>, and undergo <num value="4">four</num> months' incarceration in Newgate, and-worse than fine and imprisonmentwas compelled to listen to a parental address, from Sir William Scott, on the duties and responsibilities of men of high station. Hither under the influence of sincere admiration for the judge, or impelled by desire of vengeance on the man who had presumed to lecture her son in a court of justice, the marchioness wrote a few hasty words of thanks to Sir William Scott, for his salutary exhortation to her boy. She even went so far as to say that she wished the erring marquis could always have so wise a counsellor at his side. his communication was made upon a slip of paper, which the writer sent to the judge by an usher of the court. Sir William read the note as he sat on the bench, and having looked towards the fair scribe, he received from her a glance and a smile that were fruitful of much misery to him. Within <num value="4">four</num> months the courteous Sir William Scott was tied fast to a beautiful, shrill, voluble termagant, who exercised marvellous ingenuity in rendering him wretched and contemptible. Reared in a stately school of old-world politeness, the unhappy man was a model of decorum and urbanity. He took <pb id="p.291" n="291"> reasonable pride in the perfection of his tone and manner, and the marchioness--whose malice did not lack cleverness--was never more happy than when she was gravely expostulating with him, in the presence of numerous auditors, on his lamentable want of style and gentlemanlike bearing. It is said that, like Coke and Holt under similar circumstances, Sir William preferred the quietude of his chambers to the society of an unruly wife, and that in the cellar of his inn he sought compensation for the indignities and sufferings which he endured at home.</QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>Sir William Scott,</QUOTE> says Mr. Surtees, then <QUOTE>removed from Doctors' Commons to his wife's house in Grafton Street, and, ever economical in his domestic expenses, brought with him his own doorplate, and placed it under the pre-existing plate of Lady Sligo, instead of getting a new door-plate for: them both. Immediately after the marriage, Mr. Jekyll, so well known in the earliest part of this century for his puns and humour, happening to observe the position of these plates, condoled with Sir William on having to  <Q>knock under.</Q>  There was too much truth in the joke for it to be inwardly relished, and Sir William ordered the plates to be transposed. A few weeks later Jekyll accompanied his friend Scott as far as the door, when the latter observed,  <Q>You see I don't knock under now.</Q>   <Q>Not now,</Q>  was the answer received by the antiquated bridegroom;  <Q> <hi rend=italics>now</hi> you knock up.</Q> </QUOTE>
<p>There is a good story current of Lord Stowell in Newcastle, that, when advanced in age and rank, he visited the school of his boyhood. An old woman, whose business was to clean out and keep the key of the school-room, conducted him. She knew the name and station of the personage whom she accompanied. She naturally expectedsome recompense-half-a-crown perhaps-perhaps, since he was so great a man, <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure>. But he lingered over the books, and asked a <num value="1000">thousand</num> questions about the fate of his old school-fellows; and as he talked her expectation rose-half-a-guinea --a guinea-nay, possibly (since she had been so long connected with the school in which the great man took so deep an interest) some little annuity! He wished her good-bye kindly, called her a good woman, and slipped a piece of mioney into her hand--it was a sixpence!
<p> <QUOTE>Lord Stowell,</QUOTE> says Mr. Surtees, <QUOTE>was a great eater.</QUOTE> As Lord Eldon had for his favourite dish liver and bacon, so his brother had a favourite quite as homely, with which his intimate friends, when he dined with them, would treat him. It was a rich pie, compounded of beef steaks and layers of oysters. Yet the feats which Lord Stowell performed with the knife and fork were eclipsed by those which he would afterwards display with the bottle, and <num value="2">two</num> bottles of port formed with him no uncommon potation. By wine, however, he was never, in advanced life at any rate, seen to be affected. His mode of living suited and improved his constitution, and his strength long increased with his years.
<p>At the western end of Holborn there was a room generally let for exhibitions. At the entrance Lord Stowell presented himself, eager to see the <QUOTE>green monster serpent,</QUOTE> which, had lately issued cards of invitation to the public. As he was pulling out his purse to pay for his admission, a sharp but honest north country lad, whose business it was to take the money, recognised him as an old customer, and, knowinghis name) thus addressed him: <QUOTE>We can't take your shilling, my lord; &lsquo;tis t&lsquo; old serpent, which you have seen <num value="6">six</num> times before, in other colours; but ye can go in and see her.</QUOTE> He entered, saved his money, and enjoyed his <num value="7">seventh</num> visit to the <QUOTE>real original old sea-sarpint.</QUOTE>
<p>Of Lord Stowell it has been said by Lord Brougham that <QUOTE>his vast superiority was apparent when, as from an eminence, he was called to survey the whole field of dispute, and to unravel the variegated facts, disentangle the intricate mazes, and array the conflicting reasons, which were calculated to distract or suspend men's judgment.</QUOTE> And Brougham adds that <QUOTE>if ever the praise of being luminous could be bestowed upon human compositions, it was upon his.</QUOTE>
<p>It would be impossible with the space at our command to give anything like a tithe of the good stories of this celebrated judge. We must pass on to other famous men who have sat on the judicial bench in Doctors' Commons.
<p>Of Sir Herbert Jenner Fust, <num value="1">one</num> of the great ecclesiastical judges of modern times, Mr. Jeaffreson tells a good story:--
<p> <QUOTE>In old Sir Herbert's later days it was no mere pleasantry, or bold figure of speech, to say that the court had risen, for he used to be lifted from his chair and carried bodily from the chamber of justice by <num value="2">two</num> brawny footmen. Of course, as soon as the judge was about to be elevated by his bearers, the bar rose; and, also as a matter of course, the bar continued to stand until the strong porters had conveyed their weighty and venerable burden along the platform behind <num value="1">one</num> of the rows of advocates and out of sight. As the trio worked their laborious way along the platform, there seemed to be some danger that they might blunder and fall through <num value="1">one</num> of the windows into the space behind the court; and at a time when Sir Herbert and <pb id="p.292" n="292"> Dr.--were at open variance, that waspish advocate had, on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, the bad tasteto keep his seat at the rising of the court, and with characteristic malevolence of expression say to the footmen,  <Q> Mind, my men, and take care of that judge of yours; or, by Jove, you'll pitch him out of the window.</Q>  It is needless to say that this brutal speech did not raise the speaker in the opinion of the hearers.</QUOTE>
<p>Dr. Lushington, recently deceased, aged ninetyone, is another ecclesiastical judge deserving notice. e entered Parliament in <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>, and retired in <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>. He began his political career when the Portland Administration (Perceval, Castlereagh, and Canning) ruled, and was always a steadfast reformer through good and evil report. He was <num value="1">one</num> of the counsel for Queen Caroline, and aided Brougham and Denman in the popular triumph. He worked hard against slavery and for Parliamentary reform, and had not only heard many of Sir Robert Peel and Lord John Russell's earliest speeches, but also those of Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Disraeli. <QUOTE>Though it seemed,</QUOTE> says the <title>Daily News</title>, <QUOTE>a little incongruous that questions of faith and ritual in the Church, and those of seizures or accidents at sea, should be adjudicated on by the same person, it was always felt that his decisions were based on ample knowledge of the law and diligent attention to the special circumstances of the individual case. As Dean of Arches he was called to pronounce judgment in some of the most exciting ecclesiastical suits of modern times. When the <num value="1">first</num> prosecutions were directed against the Ritualistic innovators, as they were then called, of St. Barnabas, both sides congratulated themselves that the judgment would be given by so venerable and experienced a judge; and perhaps the dissatisfaction of both sides with the judgment proved its justice. n the prosecution of the Rev. H. ,B. Wilson and Dr. Rowland Williams, Dr. Lushington again pronounced a. judgment which, contrary to popular expectation, was reversed on appeal by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.</QUOTE>

<p>Doctors' Commons is now a ruin. The spider builds where the proctor once wove his sticky web. The college, rebuilt after the Great Fire, is described by Elmes as an old brick building in the Carolean styles the interior consisting of <num value="2">two</num> quadrangles once occupied by the doctors, a hall for the hearing of causes, a spacious library, a refectory, and other useful apartments. In <datestruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></datestruct>, when Doctors' Commons was deserted by the proctors, a clever London essayist sketched the ruins very graphically, at the time when the Metropolitan Fire Brigade occupied the lawyers' deserted town:--
<P> <QUOTE>A deserted justice-hall, with dirty mouldering walls, broken doors and windows, shattered floor, and crumbling ceiling. The dust and fog of <hi rend=italics>long-</hi>
forgotten causes lowering everywhere, making the small leaden framed panes of glass opaque, the dark wainscot grey, coating the dark rafters with a heavy dingy fur, and lading the atmosphere with a close unwholesome smell. Time and neglect have made the once-white ceiling like a huge map, in which black and swollen rivers and tangled mountain ranges are struggling for pre-eminence. Melancholy, decay, and desolation are on all sides. The holy of holies, where the profane vulgar could not tread, but which was sacred to the venerable gowned figures who cozily took it in turns to dispense justice and to plead, is now open to any passer-by. Where the public were permitted to listen is bare and shabby as a well-plucked client. The inner door of long-discoloured baize flaps listlessly on its hinges, and the true law-court little entrance-box it half shuts in is a mere nest for spiders. A large red shaft, with the word  <Q>broken</Q>  rudely scrawled on it in chalk, stands where the judgment-seat was formerly; long rows of ugly piping, like so many shiny dirty serpents, occupy the seats of honour round it; staring red vehicles, with odd brass fittings; buckets, helmets, axes, and old uniforms fill up the remainder of the space. A very few years ago this was the snuggest little law-nest in the world; now it is a hospital and store-room for the Metropolitan Fire Brigade. For we are in Doctors' Commons, and lawyers themselves will be startled to learn that the old Arches Court, the old Admiralty Court, the old Prerogative Court, the old Consistory Court, the old harbour for delegates, chancellors, vicars-general, commissaries, prothonotaries, cursitors, seal-keepers, serjeants-at-mace, doctors, deans, apparitors, proctors, and what not, is being applied to such useful purposes now. Let the reader leave the bustle of St. Paul's Churchyard, and, turning under the archway where a noble army of white-aproned touters formerly stood, cross Knightrider Street and enter the Commons. The square itself is a memorial of the mutability of human affairs. Its big sombre houses are closed. The well-known names of the learned doctors who formerly practised in the adjacent courts are still on the doors, but have, in each instance,  <Q>All letters and parcels to be addressed</Q>  Belgravia, or to <num value="1">one</num> of the western inns of court, as their accompaniment. The <num value="1">one</num> court in which ecclesiastical, testamentary, and maritime law was tried alternately, and which, as we have seen is now ending its days shabbily, but usefully, is through the further archway to the left. Here the smack <hi rend=italics>Henry and Betsy</hi> would bring its action for salvage against the schooner <hi rend=italics>Mary Jane</hi>; here a favoured gentleman was occasionally  <Q>admitted a proctor exercent by virtue of a rescript;</Q>  here, as we learnt with awe, proceedings for divorce were  <Q>carried on <foreign lang=la>in poenam</foreign>,</Q>  and  <Q>the learned judge, without entering into the facts, declared himself quite satisfied with the evidence, and pronounced for the separation ;</Q>  and here the Dean of Peculiars settled his differences with the eccentrics who, I presume, were under his charge, and to whom he owed his title.</QUOTE>
<p>Such are the changes that take place in our Protean city! Already we have seen a palace in Blackfriars turn into a prison, and the old courts of Fleet Street, once mansions of the rich and great, now filled with struggling poor. The great synagogue in the Old Jewry became a tavern; the palace of the Savoy a barracks. These changes it is our special province to record, as to trace them is our peculiar function.
<p>The Prerogative Will Office contains many last wills and testaments of great interest.

Why he left only his best bed to his wife long puzzled the antiquaries, but has since been explained.

<P>Turning from the black dome of St. Pauls, and the mean archway of Dean's Court, into a region of gorgeous blazonments, we come to that quiet and grave house, like an old nobleman's, that stands aside from the new street from the Embankment, like an aristocrat shrinking from a crowd. The original Heralds' College, Cold Harbour House, founded by Richard II., stood in Poultney Lane, but the heralds were turned out by Henry VII., who gave their mansion to Bishop Tunstal, whom he had driven from Durham Place. The heralds then retired to Ronceval Priory, at Charing Cross (afterwards Northumberland Place). Queen Mary, however, in <datestruct value="1555--"><year reg="1555">1555</year></datestruct> gave Gilbert Dethick, Garter King of Arms, and the other heralds and pursuivants, their present college, formerly Derby House, which had belonged to the <num value="1">first</num> Earl of Derby, who married Lady Margaret, Countess of Richmond, mother to King Henry VII. The grant specified that there the heralds might dwell together, and <QUOTE>at meet times congregate, speak, confer, and agree among themselves, for the good government of the faculty.</QUOTE>
<p>The College of Arms, on the east side of St. Bennet's Hill, was swept before the Great Fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>; but all the records and books, except <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num>, were preserved.

<p>However ancient the offices of heralds may be, we have hardly any memory of their titles or names before Edward III. In his reign military glory and heraldry were in high esteem, and the patents of the King of Arms at this day refer to the reign of King Edward III. The king created the <num value="2">two</num> provincials, by the titles of Clarencieux and Norroy; he instituted Windsor and Chester heralds, and Blue Mantle pursuivant, beside several others by foreign titles. From this time we find the officers of arms employed at home and abroad, both in military and civil affairs: military, with our kings and generals in the army, carrying defiances and making truces, pr attending tilts, tournaments, and duels; as civil officers, in negotiations, and attending our ambassadors in foreign Courts; at home, waiting upon the king at Court and Parliament, and directing public ceremonies.
<p>In the <num value="5">fifth</num> year of King Henry V. armorial bearings were put under regulations, and it was declared that no persons should bear coat arms that could not justify their right thereto by prescription or grant; and from this time they were communicated to persons as <foreign lang=la>insignia</foreign>, <foreign lang=la>gentilitia</foreign>, and hereditary marks of <foreign lang=fr>noblesse</foreign>. About the same time, or soon after, this victorious prince instituted the office of Garter King of Arms; and at a Chapter of the Kings and Heralds, held at the siege of Rouen in Normandy, on the <datestruct VALUE="1420-01-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1420">1420</year></datestruct>, they formed themselves into a regular society, with a common seal, receiving Garter as their chief.
<p>The office of Garter King at Arms was instituted for the service of the Most Noble Order of the Garter; and, for the dignity of that order, he was made sovereign within the office of arms, over all the other officers, subject to the Crown of England, by the name of Garter King at Arms of England. By the constitution of his office he must be a native of England, and a gentleman bearing arms. To him belongs the correction of arms, and all ensigns of arms, usurped or borne unjustly, and the power of granting arms to deserving persons, and supporters to the nobility and Knights of the Bath. It is likewise his office to go next before the sword in solemn processions, none interposing except the marshal; to administer the oath to all the officers of arms; to have a habit like the registrar of the order, baron's service in the Court, lodgings in Windsor Castle; to bear his white rod, with a banner of the ensigns of the order thereon, before the sovereign; also, when any lord shall enter the Parliament chamber, to assign him his place, according to his degree; to carry the ensigns of the order to foreign princes, and to do, or procure to be done, what the sovereign shall enjoin relating to the order, with other duties incident to his office of principal King of Arms. The other <num value="2">two</num> kings are called Provincial kings, who have particular provinces assigned them, which together comprise the whole kingdom of England--that of Clarencieux comprehending all from the river Trent southwards; that of Norroy, or North Roy, all from the river Trent northward. These Kings at Arms are distinguished from each other by their respective badges, which they may wear at all times, either in a gold chain or a ribbon, Garters being blue, and the Provincials purple.
<p>The <num value="6">six</num> heralds take place according to seniority in office. They are created with the same ceremonies as the kings, taking the oath of an herald, and are invested with a tabard of the Royal arms embroidered upon satin, not so rich as the kings', but better than the pursuivants', with a silver collar of SS.; they are esquires by creation.
<p>The <num value="4">four</num> pursuivants are also created by the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl Marshal, when they take their oath of a pursuivant, and are invested with a tabard of the Royal arms upon damask. It is the duty of the heralds and pursuivants to attend on the public ceremonials, <num value="1">one</num> of each class together by a monthly rotation.
<p>These heralds are the king's servants in <pb id="p.297" n="297"> ordinary, and therefore, in the vacancy of the office of Earl Marshal, have been sworn into their offices by the Lord Chamberlain. Their meetings are termed Chapters, which they hold the <num value="1">first</num> Thursday in every month, or oftener if necessary, wherein all matters are determined by a majority of voices, each king having <num value="2">two</num> voices.</QUOTE>

<p><num value="1">One</num> of the earliest instances of the holding an heraldic court was that in the time of Richard II., when the Scropes and Grosvenors had a dispute about the right to bear certain arms. John of Gaunt and Chaucer were witnesses on this occasion; the latter, who had served in France during the wars of Edward III., and had been taken prisoner, deposing to seeing a certain cognizance displayed during a certain period of the campaign.
<p>The system of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.297.1">heraldic visitations</lemma>, when the pedigrees of the local gentry were tested, and the arms they bore approved or cancelled, originated in the reign of Henry VIII. The monasteries, with their tombs and tablets and brasses, and their excellent libraries, had been the great repositories of the provincial genealogies, more especially of the abbeys' founders and benefactors. These records were collected and used by the heralds, who thus as it were preserved and carried on the monastic genealogical traditions. These visitations were of great use to noble families in proving their pedigrees, and preventing'disputes about property. The visitations continued till <datestruct value="1686"><year reg="1686">1686</year></datestruct> (James II.), but a few returns, says Mr. Noble, were made as late as <datestruct value="704"><year reg="704">704</year></datestruct>. Why they ceased in the reign of William of Orange is not known; perhaps the respect for feudal rank decreased as the new dynasty grew more powerful. The result of the cessation of these heraldic assizes, however, is that American gentlemen, whose Puritan ancestors left England during the, persecutions of Charles II., are now unable to trace their descent, and the heraldic gap can never be filled up.
<p><num value="3">Three</num> instances only of the degradation of knights are recorded in <num value="3">three</num> centuries' records of the Court of Honour. The <num value="1">first</num> was that of Sir Andrew Barclay, in <datestruct value="1322--"><year reg="1322">1322</year></datestruct>; of Sir Ralph Grey, in <num value="464">464</num>; and of Sir Francis Michell, in <datestruct value="1621--"><year reg="1621">1621</year></datestruct>, the last knight being convicted of heinous offences and misdemeanours. On this last occasion the Knights' Marshals' men cut off the offender's sword, took off his spurs and flung them away, and broke his sword over his head, at the same time proclaiming him <QUOTE>an infamous arrant knave.</QUOTE>
<p>The Earl Marshal's office--sometimes called the Court of Honour--took cognizance of words supposed to reflect upon the nobility. Sir Richard Grenville was fined heavily for having said that the Duke of Suffolk was a base lord; and Sit George Markham in the enormous sum of <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>, for saying, when he had horsewhipped the huntsman of Lord Darcy, that he would do the same to his master if he tried to justify his insolence. In <datestruct value="1622--"><year reg="1622">1622</year></datestruct> the legality of the court was tried in the Star Chamber by a contumacious herald, who claimed arrears of fees, and to King James's delight the legality of the court was fully established. In <datestruct value="1646--"><year reg="1646">1646</year></datestruct> (Charles I.) Mr. Hyde (afterwards Lord Chancellor Clarendon) proposed doing away with the court, vexatious causes multiplying, and very arbitrary authority being exercised. He particularly cited a case of great oppression, in which a rich citizen had been ruined in his estate and imprisoned for merely calling an heraldic swan a goose. After the Restoration, says Mr. Planche, in Knight's <title>London,</title> the Duke of Norfolk; hereditary Earl Marshal, hoping to re-establish the court, employed Dr. Plott, the learned but credulous historian of Staffordshire, to collect the materials for a history of the court, which, however, was never completed. The court, which had outlived its' age, fell into desuetude, and the last cause heard concerning the right of bearing arms (Blount <hi rend=italics>versus</hi> Blunt) was tried in the year <datestruct value="1720"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct> (George I.). In the old arbitrary times the Earl Marshal's men have been known to stop the carriage of a <hi rend=italics>parvenu</hi>, and by force deface his illegally assumed arms.
<p>Heralds' fees in the Middle Ages were very high. At the coronation of Richard II. they received <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>, and <measure value="100bmark" type=currency><num value="100">100</num> marks</measure> at that of the queen. On royal birthdays and on great festivals they also required largess. The natural result of this was that, in the reign of Henry V., William Burgess, Garter King of Arms, was able to entertain the Emperor Sigismund in sumptuous state at his house at Kentish Town.
<p>The escutcheons on the south wall of the college --<num value="1">one</num> bearing the legs of Man, and the other the eagle's claw of the House of Stanley--are not ancient, and were merely put up to heraldically mark the site of old Derby House.
<p>In the Rev. Mark Noble's elaborate <title>History of the College of Arms </title> we find some curious stories of worthy and unworthy heralds. Among the evil spirits was Sir William Dethick, Garter King at Arms, who provoked Elizabeth by drawing out treasonable emblazonments for the Duke of Norfolk, and James I. by hinting doubts, as it is supposed, against the right of the Stuarts to the crown. He was at length displaced. He seems to have been an arrogant, stormy, proud man, who used at public ceremonials to buffet the heralds and pursuivants <pb id="p.298" n="298"> who blundered or offended him. He was buried at St. Paul's, in <datestruct value="1612--"><year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct>, near the grave of Edward III.'s herald, Sir Pain Roet, Guienne King at Arms, and Chaucer's father-in-law. Another black sheep was Cook, Clarencieux King at Arms in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, who was accused of granting arms to any <num value="1">one</num> for a large fee, and of stealing <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num> heraldic books from the college library. There was also Ralph Brooke, York Herald in the same reign, a malicious and ignorant man, who attempted to confute some of Camden's genealogies in the <title>Britannia.</title> He broke open and stole some muniments from the office, and finally, for <num value="2">two</num> felonies, was burnt in the hand at Newgate.
<p>To such rascals we must oppose men of talent and scholarship like
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.298.1">the great Camden</lemma>. This grave and learned antiquary was the son of a painter in the Old Bailey, and, as <num value="2">second</num> master of Westminster School, became known to the wisest and most learned men of London, Ben Jonson honouring him as a father, and Burleigh, Bacon, and Lord Broke regarding him as a friend. His
<title>Britannia</title> is invaluable, and his <title>Annals of Elizabeth </title> are full of the heroic and soaring spirit of that great age. Camden's house, at Chislehurst, was that in which the Emperor Napoleon has recently died.
<p>SirWilliam Le Neve (Charles I.), Clarencieux, was another most learned herald. He is said to have read the king's proclamation at Edgehill with great marks of fear. His estate was sequestered by the Parliament, and. he afterwards went mad from loyal and private grief and vexation. In Charles II.'s reign we find the famous antiquary, Elias Ashmole, Windsor Herald for several years. He was the son of a Lichfield saddler, and was brought up as a chorister-boy. That impostor, Lilly, calls him the <QUOTE>greatest virtuoso and curioso</QUOTE> that was ever known or read of in England; for he excelled, in music, botany, chemistry, heraldry, astrology, and antiquities. His <title>History of the Order of the Garter </title> formed no doubt part of his studies at the College of Arms.
<p>In the same reign as Ashmole, that great and laborious antiquary, Sir William Dugdale, was Garter King of Arms. In early life he became acquainted with Spelman, an antiquary as profound as himself, and with the same mediaeval power of work. He fought for King Charles in the Civil Wars. His great work was the <title>Monasticon Anglicanum,</title> <num value="3">three</num> volumes folio, which disgusted the Puritans and delighted the Catholics. His <title>History of Warwickshire </title> was considered a model of county histories. His <title>Baronage of England</title>
 contained many errors. In his visitations he was very severe in defacing fictitious arms.
<p>Francis Sandford, <num value="1">first</num> Rouge Dragon Pursuivant, and then Lancaster Herald (Charles II., James II.), published an excellent <title>Genealogical History of England,</title> and curious accounts of the funeral of General Monk and the coronation of James II. He was so attached to James that he resigned his office at the Revolution, and died, true to the last, old, poor, and neglected, somewhere in Bloomsbury, in <datestruct value="1693--"><year reg="1693">1693</year></datestruct>.
<p>Sir John Vanbrugh, the witty dramatist, for building Castle Howard, was made Clarencieux King of Arms, to the great indignation of the heralds, whose pedantry he ridiculed. He afterwards sold his place for <measure value="200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200000">2,00000</num></measure>, avowing igno- France of his profession and his constant neglect of his official duties.
<p>In the same reign, to Peter Le Neve (Norroy) we are indebted for the careful preservation of the invaluable <title>Paxton Letters,</title> of the reigns of Henry VI., Edward IV., and Richard III., purchased and afterwards published by Sir John Fenn.
<p>Another eminent herald was John Anstis, created Garter in <datestruct value="1718--"><year reg="1718">1718</year></datestruct> (George I.), after being imprisoned as a Jacobite. He wrote learned works on the Orders of the Garter and the Bath, and left behind him valuable materials-his MS. for the <title>History of the College of Arms,</title> now preserved in the library.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.298.2">Francis Grose, that roundabout</lemma>, jovial friend of Burns, was Richmond Herald for many years, but he resigned his appointment in <datestruct value="1763--"><year reg="1763">1763</year></datestruct>, to become Adjutant and Paymaster of the Hampshire Militia. Grose was the son of a Swiss jeweller, who had settled in London. His <title>Views of Antiquities in England and Wales </title> helped to restore a taste for Gothic art. He died in <datestruct value="1791--"><year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>.
<p>Of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.298.3">Oldys</lemma>, that eccentric antiquary, who was Norroy King at Arms in the reign of George II. --the Duke of Norfolk having appointed him fromthe pleasure he felt at the perusal of his <title>Life of Sir Walter Raleigh </title> Grose gives an amusing account:--
<p><title>William Oldys, Norroy King at Arms,</title> says Grose, <QUOTE>author of the  <Q> Life of Sir Walter Raleigh,</Q>  and several others in the  <Q>Biographia Britannica,</Q>  was natural son of a Dr. Oldys, in the Commons, who kept his mother very privately, and probably very meanly, as when he dined at a tavern he used to beg leave to send home part of the remains of any fish or fowl for his <hi rend=italics>cat</hi>, which cat was afterwards found out to be Mr. Oldys' mother. His parents dying when he was very young, he soon <pb id="p.299" n="299"> squandered away his small patrimony, when he became <num value="1">first</num> an attendant in Lord Oxford's library and afterwards librarian. He was a little meanlooking man, of a vulgar address, and, when I knew him, rarely sober in the afternoon, never after supper. His favourite liquor was porter, with a glass of gin between each pot. Dr. Ducarrel told me he used to stint Oldys to <num value="3">three</num> pots of beer whenever he visited him. Oldys seemed to have little classical learning, and knew nothing of the sciences; but for iridex-reading, title-pages, and the knowledge of scarce English books and editions, he had no equal. This he had probably picked up in Lord Oxford's service, after whose death he was obliged to write for the booksellers for a subsistence. Amongst many other publications, chiefly in the biographical line, he wrote the  <Q> Life of Sir Walter Raleigh,</Q>  which got him much reputation. The Duke of Norfolk, in particular, was so pleased with it that he resolved to provide for him, and accordingly gave him the patent of Norroy King at Arms, then vacant. The patronage of that duke occasioned a suspicion of his being a Papist, though I really think without reason; this for a while retarded his appointment. It was underhand propagated by the heralds, who were vexed at having a stranger put in upon them. He was a man of great good-nature, honour, and integrity, particularly in his character as an historian. Nothing, I firmly believe, would ever have biassed him to insert any fact in his writings he did not believe, or to suppress any he did. Of this delicacy he gave an instance at a time when he was in great distress. After the publication of his  <Q> Life of Sir Walter Raleigh,</Q>  some booksellers, thinking his name would sell a piece they were publishing, offered him a considerable sum to father it, which he refused with the greatest indignation. He was much addicted to low company; most of his evenings he spent at the  <Q> Bell</Q>  in the Old Bailey, a house within the liberties of the Fleet,. frequented by persons whom he jocularly called
<hi rend=italics>rulers</hi>, from their being confined to the rules or limits of that prison. From this house a watchman, whom he kept regularly in pay, used to lead him home before <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock, in order to save-sixpence paid to the porter of the Heralds' office, by all those who came home after that time, sometimes, and not unfrequently, <num value="2">two</num> were necessary. He could not resist the temptation of liquor, even when he was to officiate on solemn occasions; for at the burial of the Princess Caroline he was so intoxicated that he could scarcely walk, but reeled about with a crown  <Q>coronet</Q>  on a cushion, to the great scandal of his brethren, His method of composing was somewhat singular. He had, a number of small parchment bags inscribed with the names of the persons whose lives he intended to write; into these bags he put every circumstance and anecdote he could collect, and from thence drew up his history. By his excesses he was kept poor, so that he was frequently in distress; and at his death, which happened about <num value="5">five</num> on Wednesday morning, <datestruct VALUE="1761-04-15"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=15>15th</day>, <year reg=1761>1761</year></datestruct>, he left little more than was sufficient to bury him.; Dr. Taylor, the oculist, son of the famous doctor of that name and profession, claimed administration at the Commons, on account of his being <hi rend=italics>nullius filius-Anglice</hi>, a bastard. He was buried the <num value="19">19th</num> following, in the north aisle of the Church of St. Benet, Paul's Wharf, towards the upper end of the aisle. He was about seventytwo years old. Amongst his works is a preface to Izaak Walton's  <Q>Angler.</Q> </QUOTE>
<p>The following pretty anacreontic, on a fly drinking out of his cup of ale, which is doubtless well known, is from the pen of Oldys :--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=stanza><L>Busy, curious, thirsty fly,
<L>Drink with me, and drink as I;
<L>Freely welcome to my cup,
<L>Couldst thou sip and sip it up.

<L>Both alike are mine and thine,

<p>The Rev. Mark Noble comments upon Grose's text by saying that this story of the crown must be incorrect, asthe coronet at the funeral of a princess is always carried by Clarencieux, and not by Norroy.
<p>In <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>, <num value="2">two</num> eminent heralds, Benjamin Pingo, York Herald, and John Charles Brooke, Somerset Herald, were crushed to death in a,. crowd at the side door of the Haymarket Theatre. Mr. Brooke had died standing, and was found as if asleep, and with colour still in his cheeks.
<p>Edmund Lodge, Lancaster Herald, who died in <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>, is chiefly known for his interesting series of
<title>Portraits of Illustrious British Personages,</title> accompanied by excellent genealogical and biographical memoirs.
<p>During the Middle. Ages heralds were employed to bear letters, defiances, and treaties to foreign princes and persons in authority; to proclaim war, and bear offers of marriage, &amp;c.; and after battles to catalogue the dead, and note their rank by the heraldic bearings on their banners, shields, and tabards, In later times they were allowed to correct false crests, arms, and cognizances, and register noble <pb id="p.300" n="300"> descents in their archives. They conferred arms on those who proved themselves able to maintain the state of a gentleman, they marshalled great or rich men's funerals, arranged armorial bearings for tombs and stained-glass windows, and laid down the laws of precedence at state ceremonials. Arms, it appears from Mr. Planche, were sold to the <QUOTE>new rich</QUOTE> as early as the reign of King Henry VIII., who wished to, make a new race of gentry, in order to lessen the power of the old nobles. The fees varied then from <measure value="6l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6">6</num></measure> <measure value="13s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="13">13</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> to <measure value="5l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5">5</num></measure>.
<p>In the old times the heralds' messengers were called knights caligate. After <num value="7">seven</num> years they became knight-riders (our modern Queen's messengers); after <num value="7">seven</num> years more they became pursuivants, and then heralds. In later times, says Mr. Planche, the herald's honourable office was transferred to nominees of the Tory nobility, discarded valets, butlers, or sons of upper servants. Mr. Canning, when Premier, very properly put a stop to this system, and appointed to this post none but young and intelligent men of manners and education.
<p>Among the many curious volumes of genealogy in the library of the College of Arms-volumes which have been the result of centuries of exploring and patient study--the following are chiefly notice-

 able :--A book of emblazonment executed for Prince Arthur, the brother of Henry VIII., who died young, and whose widow Henry married; the Warwick Roll, a series of figures of all the Earls of Warwick from the Conquest to the reign of Richard III., executed by Rouse, a celebrated antiquary of Warwick, at the close of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century; and a tournament roll of Henry VIII., in which that stalwart monarch is depicted in regal state, with all the <QUOTE>pomp, pride, and circumstance of glorious (mimic) war.</QUOTE> In the gallery over the library are to be seen the sword and dagger which belonged to the unfortunate James of Scotland, that chivalrous king who died fighting to the last on the hill at Flodden. The sword-hilt has been enamelled, and still shows traces of gilding which has once been red-wet with the Southron's blood; and the dagger is a strong and serviceable weapon, as no doubt many an English archer and billman that day felt. The heralds also show the plain turquoise ring which tradition says the French queen sent James, begging him to ride a foray in England. Copies of it have been made by the London jewellers. These trophies are heirlooms of the house of Howard, whose bend argent, to use the words of Mr. Planche, received the honourable augmentation of the Scottish lion, in testimony of the prowess displayed by the gallant soldier who <pb id="p.301" n="301"> commanded the English forces on that memorable occasion. Here is also to be seen a portrait of Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury (the great warrior), from his tomb in Old St. Paul's; a curious pedigree of the Saxon kings from Adam, illustrated with many beautiful drawings in pen and ink, about the period of Henry VIII., representing the Creation, Adam and Eve in Paradise, the building of Babel, the rebuilding of the Temple, &amp;c. &amp;c.; MSS., consisting chiefly of heralds' visitations, records of grants of arms and royal licences; records of modern pedigrees (i.e., since the discontinuance of the visitations in <datestruct value="1687--"><year reg="1687">1687</year></datestruct>); a most valuable collection of official funeral certificates; a portion of the Arundel MSS.; the Shrewsbury or Cecil papers, from which <num value="26">26</num>

<P>The Wardrobe, a house long belonging to the Government, in the Blackfriars, was built by Sir John Beauchamp (died <datestruct value="1359--"><year reg="1359">1359</year></datestruct>), whose tomb in Old St. Paul's was usually taken for the tomb of the good Duke Humphrey. Beauchamp's executors sold it to Edward III., and it was subsequently converted into the office of the Master of the Wardrobe, and the repository for the royal clothes. When Stow drew up his <title>Survey,</title> Sir John Fortescue was <pb id="p.302" n="302"> lodged in the house as Master of the Wardrobe. What a royal ragfair this place must have been for rummaging antiquaries, equal to <num value="20">twenty</num> Madame Tussaud's and all the ragged regiments of Westminster Abbey put together!
<p> <QUOTE>There were also kept,</QUOTE> says Fuller, <QUOTE>in this place the ancient clothes of our English kings, which they wore on great festivals; so that this Wardrobe was in effect a library for antiquaries, therein to read the mode and fashion of garments in all ages.

<p>Linacre's house in Knightrider Street was given by him to the College of Physicians, and used as their place of meeting till the early part of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century.
<p>In his student days
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.303.2">Linacre</lemma> had been patronised by Lorenzo de Medicis, and at Florence, under Demetrius Chalcondylas, who had fled from Constantinople when it was taken by the Turks, he acquired a perfect knowledge of the Greek language. He studied eloquence at Bologna, under Politian, <num value="1">one</num> of the most eloquent Latinists in Europe, and while he was at Rome devoted himself to medicine and the study of natural philosophy, under Hermolaus Barbarus. Linacre was the <num value="1">first</num> Englishman who read Aristotle and Galen in the original Greek. On his return to England, having taken the degree of M.D. at Oxford, he gave lectures in physic, and taught the Greek language in that university. His reputation soon became so high that King Henry VII. called him to court, and entrusted him with the care of the health and education of his son, Prince Arthur. To show the extent of his acquirements, we may mention that he instructed Princess Katharine in the Italian language, and that he published a work on mathematics, which he dedicated to his pupil, Prince Arthur.
<p>His treatise on grammar was warmly praised by Melancthon. This great doctor was successively physician to Henry VII., Henry VIII., Edward VI., and the Princess Mary. He established lectures on physic (says Dr. Macmichael, in his amusing book, <title>The Gold-headed Cane</title>), and towards the close of his life he founded the Royal College of Physicians, holding the office of President for <num value="7">seven</num> years. Linacre was a friend of Lily, the grammarian, and was consulted by Erasmus. The College of Physicians <num value="1">first</num> met in <datestruct value="1518--"><year reg="1518">1518</year></datestruct> at Linacre's house (now called the Stone House), Knightrider Street, and which still belongs to the society.

In front of the building was a library, and there were early donations of books, globes, mathematical instruments, minerals,  &amp;c. Dissections were <num value="1">first</num> permitted by Queen Elizabeth, in <datestruct value="1564--"><year reg="1564">1564</year></datestruct>. As soon as the <num value="1">first</num> lectures were founded, in <datestruct value="1583--"><year reg="1583">1583</year></datestruct>, a spacious anatomical theatre was built adjoining Linacre's house, and here the great
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.303.3">Dr. Harvey</lemma> gave his <num value="1">first</num> course of lectures; but about the time of the accession of Charles I. the College removed
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.303.4">to a house of the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's</lemma>, at the bottom of Amen Corner, where they planted a botanical garden and built an anatomical theatre. During the civil wars the Parliament levied <num value="5">5</num> a week on the College. Eventually sold by the Puritans, the house and gardens were purchased by Dr. Harvey and given to the society. The great Harvey built a museum and library at his own expense, which were opened in <datestruct value="1653--"><year reg="1653">1653</year></datestruct>, and Harvey, then nearly <num value="80">eighty</num>, relinquished his office of Professor of Anatomy and Surgery. The garden at this time extended as far west as the Old Bailey, and as far south as St. Martin's Church. Harvey's gift consisted of a convocation room and a library, to which Selden contributed some Oriental MS., Elias Ashmole many valuable volumes, the Marquis of Dorchester <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="100">100</num></measure>; and Sir Theodore Mayerne, physician to <num value="4">four</num> kings--viz., Henry IV. of France, James I., Charles I., and Charles II.--left his library. The old library was turned into a lecture and reception room, for such visitors as Charles II. who in <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct> attended here the anatomical praelections of Dr. Ent, whom he knighted on the occasion. This building was destroyed by the Great Fire, from which only <num value="112">112</num> folio books were saved. The College never rebuilt its premises, and on the site were erected the houses of <num value="3">three</num> residentiaries of St. Paul's. Shortly after a piece of ground was purchased in Warwick Lane, and the new building opened in <datestruct value="1674--"><year reg="1674">1674</year></datestruct>. A similar grant <pb id="p.304" n="304"> to that of Linacre's was that of Dr. Lettsom, who in the year <datestruct value="1773"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct> gave the house and library in Bolt Court, which is at the present moment occupied by the Medical Society of London.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.304.1">Cheapside</lemma>; what restless life and energy; with what vigorous pulsation life beats to and fro in that great commercial artery! How pleasantly on a summer morning that last of the Mohicans, the green plane-tree now deserted by the rooks, at the corner of Wood Street, flutters its leaves! How fast the crowded omnibuses dash past with their loads of young Greshams and future rulers of Lombard Street! How grandly Bow steeple bears itself, rising proudly in the sunshine! How the great webs of gold chains sparkle in the jeweller's windows! How modern everything looks, and yet only a short time since some workmen at a foundation in Cheapside, <num value="25">twenty-five</num> feet below the surface, came upon traces of primeval inhabitants in the shape of a deer's skull, with antlers, and the skull of a wolf, struck down, perhaps, more than a <num value="1000">thousand</num> years ago, by the bronze axe of some British savage.

<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.304.2">The engraving which we give on page <num value="307">307</num></LEMMA> is from <num value="1">one</num> of the most ancient representations extant of Cheapside. It shows the street decked out in holiday attire for the procession of the wicked old queen-mother, Marie de Medici, on her way to visit her son-in-law, Charles I., and her wilful daughter, Henrietta Maria.
<p>The City records, explored with such unflagging interest by Mr. Riley in his <title>Memorials of London,</title> furnish us with some interesting gleanings relating to Cheapside. In the old letter books in the Guildhall--the Black Book, Red Book, and White Book-we see it in storm and calm, observe the vigilant and jealous honesty of the guilds, and become witnesses again to the bloody frays, cruel punishments, and even the petty disputes of the middle-age craftsmen, when Cheapside was <num value="1">one</num> glittering row of goldsmiths' shops, and the very heart of the wealth of London. The records culled so carefully by Mr. Riley are brief but pregnant; they give us facts uncoloured by the historian, and highly suggestive glimpses of strange modes of life in wild and picturesque eras of our civilisation. Let us take the most striking <foreign lang=la>seriatim.</foreign>

<p>In <datestruct value="1273--"><year reg="1273">1273</year></datestruct> the candle-makers seem to have taken a fancy to Cheapside, where the horrible fumes of that necessary but most offensive trade soon excited the ire of the rich citizens, who at last expelled <num value="17">seventeen</num> of the craft from their sheds in Chepe. In the <num value="3">third</num> year of Edward II. it was ordered and commanded on the king's behalf, that <QUOTE>no man or woman should be so bold as henceforward to hold common market for merchandise in Chepe, or any other highway within the City, except Cornhill, after the hour of nones</QUOTE> (probably about <measure value="2d." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> p.</measure>m.); and the same year it was forbidden, under pain of imprisonment, to scour pots in the roadway of Chepe, to the hindrance of folks who were passing; so that we may conclude that in Edward II.'s London there was a good deal of that out-door work that the traveller still sees in the back streets of Continental towns.
<p>Holocausts of spurious goods were not. uncommon in Cheapside. In <datestruct value="1311--"><year reg="1311">1311</year></datestruct> (Edward II.) we find that at the request of the hatters and haberdashers, search had been made for traders selling <QUOTE>bad and cheating hats,</QUOTE> that is, of false and dishonest workmanship, made of a mixture of wool and flocks. The result was the seizure of <num value="40">forty</num> grey and white hats, and <num value="15">fifteen</num> black) which were publicly burnt in the street of Chepe. What a burning such a search would lead to in our less scrupulous days! Why, the pile would reach half way up St. Paul's. Illegal nets had been burnt opposite Friday Street in the previous reign. After the hats came a burning of fish panniers defective in measure; while in the reign of Edward III. some false chopins (wine measures) were destroyed. This was rough justice, but still the seizures seem to have been far fewer than they would be in our boastful epoch. <pb id="p.305" n="305">
<p>There was a generous lavishness about the royalty of the Middle Ages, however great a fool or scoundrel the monarch might be. Thus we read that on the safe delivery of Queen Isabel  (wife of Edward II.), in <datestruct value="1312--"><year reg="1312">1312</year></datestruct>, of a son, afterwards Edward III., the Conduit in Chepe, for <num value="1">one</num> day, ran with nothing but wine, for all those who chose to drink there; and at the
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.305.1">cross</lemma>, hard by the church of St. Michael in West Chepe, there was a pavilion extended in the middle of the street, in which was set a tun of wine, for all passers-by to drink of.
<p>The mediaeval guilds, useful as they were in keeping traders honest (Heaven knows, it needs supervision enough, now!), still gave rise to jealousies and feuds. The sturdy craftsmen of those days, inured to arms, flew to the sword as the quickest arbitrator, and preferred clubs and bills to Chancery courts and Common Pleas. The stones of Chepe were often crimsoned with the blood of these angry disputants. Thus, in <datestruct value="1327--"><year reg="1327">1327</year></datestruct> (Edward III.), the saddlers and the joiners and bit-makers came to blows. In May of that year armed parties of these rival trades fought right and left in Cheapside and Cripplegate. The whole city ran to the windows in alarm, and several workmen were killed and many mortally wounded, to the great scandal of the City, and the peril of many quiet people. he conflict at last became, so serious that the mayor, aldermen, and sheriffs had to interpose, and the dispute had to be finally settled at a great discussion of the <num value="3">three</num> trades at the Guildhall, with what result the record does not state.
<p>In this same reign of Edward III. the excessive length of the tavern signs ( <QUOTE>ale-stakes</QUOTE> as they were then called) was complained of by persons riding in Cheapside. All the taverners of the City were therefore summoned to the Guildhall, and warned that no sign or bush (hence the proverb, <QUOTE>Good wine needs no bush</QUOTE> ) should henceforward extend over the king's highway beyond the length of <num value="7">seven</num> feet, under pain of a fine of <measure value="40d." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num> pence</measure> to the chamber of the Guildhall.
<p>In <datestruct value="1340--"><year reg="1340">1340</year></datestruct> (Edward III.) <num value="2">two</num> more guilds fell to quarrelling. This time it was the pelterers (furriers) and fishmongers, who seem to have tanned each other's hides with considerable zeal. It came at last to this, that the portly mayor and sheriffs had to venture out among the sword-blades, cudgels, and whistling volleys of stones, but at <num value="1">first</num> with little avail, for the combatants were too hot. They soon arrested some scaly and fluffy misdoers, it is true; but then came a wild rush, and the noisy misdoers were rescued; and, most audacious of all, <num value="1">one</num> Thomas, son of John Hansard, fishmonger, with sword drawn (terrible to relate), seized the mayor by his august throat, and tried to lop him on the neck; and <num value="1">one</num> brawny rascal, John le Brewere, a porter, desperately wounded <num value="1">one</num> of the City serjeants: so that here, as the fishmongers would have observed, <QUOTE>there was a pretty kettle of fish.</QUOTE> For striking a mayor blood for blood was the only expiation, and Thomas and John were at once tried at the Guildhall, found guilty on their own confession, and beheaded in Chepe; upon hearing which Edward III. wrote to the mayor, and complimented him on his display of energy on this occasion.

<p>In the luxurious reign of Richard II. the guilds were again vigilant, and set fire to a number of caps that had been oiled with rank grease, and that had been frilled by the feet and not by the hand, <QUOTE>so being false and made to deceive the commonalty.</QUOTE> In this same reign (<datestruct value="1393--"><year reg="1393">1393</year></datestruct>), when the air was growing dark with coming mischief, an ordinance was passed, prohibiting secret huckstering of stolen and bad goods by night <QUOTE>in the common hostels,</QUOTE> instead of the <num value="2">two</num> appointed markets held every feast-day, by daylight only, in Westchepe and Cornhill. The Westchepe market was held by day between St. Lawrence Lane and a house called <QUOTE>the Cage,</QUOTE> between the <num value="1">first</num> and <num value="2">second</num> bell, and special provision was made that at these markets no crowd should obstruct the shops adjacent to the open-air market. To close the said markets the <QUOTE>bedel of the ward</QUOTE> was to ring a bell (probably, says Mr. Riley, the bell on the Tun, at Cornhill) twice-<num value="1">first</num>, an hour before sunset, and another final <num value="1">one</num> half an hour later. Another civic edict relating to markets occurs in <datestruct value="1379--"><year reg="1379">1379</year></datestruct> (Richard II.), when the stands for stalls at the High Cross of Chepe were let by the mayor and chamberlain at <measure value="13s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="13">13</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> each. At the same time the stalls round the brokers' cross, at the north door of St. Paul's (erected by the Earl of Gloucester in Henry III.'s reign) were let at ios. and <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> each. The stationers, or vendors in small wares, on the taking down of the Cross in <datestruct value="1390--"><year reg="1390">1390</year></datestruct>, probably retired to Paternoster Row.
<p>The punishment of the pillory (either in <pb id="p.306" n="306"> Cheapside or Cornhill; the <title>Letter Book</title> does not say which) was freely used in the Middle Ages for scandal-mongers, dishonest traders, and forgers; and very deterring the shameful exposure must have been to even the most brazen offender. Thus, in Richard II.'s reign, we find John le Strattone, for obtaining <measure value="13bmark" type=currency><num value="13">thirteen</num> marks</measure> by means of a forged letter, was led through Chepe with trumpets and pipes to the pillory on <QUOTE>Cornhalle</QUOTE> for <num value="1">one</num> hour, on <num value="2">two</num> successive days.
<p>For the sake. of classification we may here mention a few earlier instances of the same ignominious punishment. In <datestruct value="1372--"><year reg="1372">1372</year></datestruct> (Edward III.) Nicholas Mollere, a smith's servant, for spreading a lying report that foreign merchants were to be allowed the same rights as freemen of the City, was set in the pillory for <num value="1">one</num> hour, with a whetstone hung round his neck. In the same heroic reign Thomas Lanbye, a chapman, for selling rims of base metal for cups, pretending them to be silvergilt, was put in the pillory for <num value="2">two</num> hours; while in <datestruct value="1382--"><year reg="1382">1382</year></datestruct> (Richard II.) we find Roger Clerk, of Wandsworth, for pretending to cure a poor woman of fever by a talisman wrapped in cloth of gold, was ridden through the City to the music of trumpets and pipes; and the same year a cook in Bread Street, for selling stale slices of cooked conger, was put in the pillory for an hour, and the said fish burned under his rascally nose.
<p>Sometimes, however, the punishment awarded to these civic offenders consisted in less disgraceful penance, as, for instance, in the year <datestruct value="1387"><year reg="1387">1387</year></datestruct> (Richard II.), a man named Highton, who had assaulted a worshipful alderman, was sentenced to lose his hand; but the man being a servant of the king, was begged off by certain lords, on condition of his walking through Chepe and Fleet Street, carrying a lighted wax candle of <measure value="3l." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> pounds</measure>&lsquo; weight to St. Dunstan's Church, where he was to offer it on the altar.
<p>In <datestruct value="1591--"><year reg="1591">1591</year></datestruct>, the year Elizabeth sent her rash but brave young favourite, Essex, with <num value="3500">3,500</num> men, to help Henry IV. to besiege Rouen, <num value="2">two</num> fanatics named Coppinger and Ardington, the former calling himself a prophet of mercy and the latter a prophet of vengeance, proclaimed their mission in Cheapside, and were at once laid by the heels. But the old public punishment still continued, for in <datestruct value="1600--"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct> (the year before the execution of Essex) we read that <QUOTE>Mrs. Fowler's case was decided</QUOTE> by sentencing that lady to be whipped in Bridewell; while a Captain Hermes was sent to the pillory, his brother was fined lIoo and imprisoned, and Gascone, a soldier, was sentenced to ride to the Cheapside pillory with his face to the horse's tail, to be there branded in the face, and afterwards imprisoned for life.
<p>In <datestruct value="1578--"><year reg="1578">1578</year></datestruct>, when Elizabeth was coquetting with Anjou and the French marriage, we find in <num value="1">one</num> of those careful lists of the Papists of London kept by her subtle councillors, a Mr. Loe, vintner, of the <QUOTE>Mitre,</QUOTE> Cheapside, who married Dr. Boner's sister  (Bishop Bonner?). In <datestruct value="1587--"><year reg="1587">1587</year></datestruct>, the year before, the defeat of the Armada, and when Leicester's army was still in Holland, doing little, and the very month that Sir William Stanley and <num value="13000">13,000</num> Englishmen surrendered Deventer to the Prince of Parma, we find the Council writing to the Lord Mayor about a mutiny, requiring him <QUOTE>to see that the soldiers levied in the City for service in the Low Countries, who had mutinied against Captain Sampson, be punished with some severe and extraordinary correction. To be tied to carts and flogged through Cheapside to Tower Hill, then to be set upon a pillory, and each to have <num value="1">one</num> ear cut off.</QUOTE>
<p>In the reign of James I. the same ignominious and severe punishment continued, for in <datestruct value="1611--"><year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct> <num value="1">one</num> Floyd (for we know not what offence) was fined <num value="5000">5,000</num>, sentenced to be whipped to the pillories of Westminster and Cheapside, to be branded in the face, and then imprisoned in Newgate.
<p>To return to our historical sequence. In <datestruct value="1388--"><year reg="1388">1388</year></datestruct>  (Richard II.) it was ordered that every person selling fish taken east of London Bridge should sell the same at the Cornhill market; while all Thames fish caught west of the bridge was to be sold near the conduit in Chepe, and nowhere else, under pain of forfeiture of the fish.
<p>The <num value="11">eleventh</num> year of Richard II. brought a real improvement to the growing city, for certain <QUOTE>substantial men of the ward of Farringdon Within</QUOTE> were then allowed to build a new water-conduit near the church of St. Michael le Quern, in Westchepe, to be supplied by the great pipe opposite St. Thomas of Accon, providing the great conduit should not be injured; and on this occasion the Earl of Gloucester's brokers' cross at St. Paul's was removed.
<p>Early in the reign of Henry V. complaints were made by the poor that the brewers, who rented the fountains and chief upper pipe of the Cheapside conduit, also drew from the smaller pipe below, and the brewers were warned that for every future offence they would be fined <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> In the <num value="4">fourth</num> year of this chivalrous monarch a <QUOTE>hostiller</QUOTE> named Benedict Wolman, under-marshal of the Marshalsea, was condemned to death for a conspiracy to bring a man named Thomas Ward, <hi rend=italics>alias</hi> Trumpington, from Scotland, to pass him off as Richard II. <pb id="p.307" n="307">

<p>In <datestruct value="1622--"><year reg="1622">1622</year></datestruct> the traders of the Goldsmiths' Company began to complain that alien traders were creeping into and alloying the special haunts of the trade, Goldsmiths' Row and Lombard Street; and that <num value="183">183</num> foreign goldsmiths were selling counterfeit jewels, engrossing the business and impoverishing its members.
<p>City improvements were carried with a high hand in the reign of Charles I., who, determined to clear Cheapside of all but goldsmiths, in order to make the eastern approach to St. Paul's grander, committed to the Fleet some of the alien traders who refused to leave Cheapside. This unfortunate monarch seems to have carried out even his smaller measures in a despotic and unjustifiable manner, as we see from an entry in the State. Papers, <datestruct VALUE="1634-10-2"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=2>2</day>, <year reg=1634>1634</year></datestruct>. It is a petition of William Bankes, a Cheapside tavern-keeper, and deposes:--
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Petition of William Bankes to the king. Not fully <num value="12">twelve</num> months since, petitioner having obtained a license under, the Great Seal to draw wine and vent it at his house in Cheapside, and being scarce entered into his trade, it pleased his Majesty, taking into consideration the great disorders that grew by the numerous taverns within London, to stop so growing an evil by a total suppression of victuallers in Cheapside, &amp;c., by which petitioner is much decayed in his fortune. Beseeches his Majesty to grant him (he not being of the Company of Vintners in London, but authorised merely by his Majesty) leave to victual and retail meat, it being a thing much desired by noblemen and gentlemen of the best rank and others (for the which, if they please, they may also contract beforehand, as the custom is in other countries), there being no other place fit for them to eat in the City.</QUOTE>

<p>The foolish determination to make Cheapside more glittering and showy seems again to have struck the weak despot, and an order of the Council (<datestruct value="11-16"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=16>16</day></datestruct>) goes forth that- <QUOTE>Whereas in Goldsmith's Row, in Cheapside and Lombard Street, divers shops are held by persons of other trades, whereby that uniform show which was an ornament to those places and a lustre to the City is now greatly diminished,</QUOTE> all the shops in Goldsmith's Row are to be occupied by none but goldsmiths; and all the goldsmiths who keep shops in other parts of the City are to resort thither, or to Lombard Street or Cheapside.
<p>The next year we find a tradesman who had been expelled from Goldsmiths' Row praying bitterly to be allowed a year longer, as he cannot find a residence, the removal of houses in Cheapside, Lombard Street, and St. Paul's Churchyard having rendered shops scarce.
<p>In <datestruct value="1637--"><year reg="1637">1637</year></datestruct> the king returns again to the charge, and determines to carry out his tyrannical whim by the. following order of the Council :-- <QUOTE>The Council threaten the Lord Mayor and aldermen with imprisonment, if they do not forthwith enforce the king's command that all shops should be shut up in Cheapside and Lombard Street that were not goldsmiths' shops.</QUOTE> The Council <QUOTE>had learned that there were still <datestruct value="24"><year reg="24">twenty-four</year></datestruct> houses and shops that were not inhabited by goldsmiths, but in some of them were qne.

<P>Cheapside has been the scene of <num value="2">two</num> great riots, which were threatening enough to render them historically important. The <num value="1">one</num> was in the reign of Richard I., the other in that of Henry VIII. he <num value="1">first</num> of these, a violent protest against Norman oppression, was no doubt fomented, if not originated, by the down-trodden Saxons. It began thus :--On the return of Richard from his captivity in Germany, and before his fiery retaliation on France, a London citizen named William with the Long Beard (<hi rend=italics>alias</hi> Fitzosbert, a deformed man, but of great courage and zeal for the poor), sought the king, and appealing to his better nature, laid before him a detail of great oppressions and outrages wrought by the Mayor and rich aldermen of the city, to burden the humbler citizens and relieve themselves, especially at <QUOTE>the hoistings</QUOTE> when any taxes or tollage were to be levied. Fitzosbert, encouraged at gaining the king's ear, and hoping too much from the generous but rapacious Norman soldier, grew bolder, openly defended the causes of oppressed men, and thus drew round him daily great crowds of the poor.
<p> <QUOTE>Many gentlemen of honour,</QUOTE> says Holinshed, <QUOTE>sore hated him for his presumptions attempts to the hindering of their purposes; but he had such comfort of the king that he little paused.for their malice, but kept on his intent, till the king, being advertised of the assemblies which he made, commanded him to cease from such doings, that the people might fall again to their sciences and occupations, which they had for the most part left off at the instigation of this William with the Long Beard, which he nourished of purpose, to seem the more grave and manlike, and also, as it were, in despite of them which counterfeited the Normans (that were for the most part shaven), and because he would resemble the ancient usage of the English nation. The king's commandment in restraint of people's resort unto him was well kept for a time,. but it was not long before they began to follow him. again as they had done before. Then he took upon him to make unto them certain speeches. By these and such persuasions and means as he. used, he had gotten <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> persons ready to have taken his part.</QUOTE>
<p>How far this English Rienzi intended to obtain redress by. force we cannot clearly discover; but he does not seem to have been a man who would have stopped at anything to obtain justice for the oppressed-and that the Normans were oppressors, till they became real Englishmen, there can be no doubt. The rich citizens and the Norman nobles, who had clamped the City fast with fortresses, soon barred out Longbeard from the king's chamber. he Archbishop of Canterbury especially, who ruled the City, called together the rich citizens, excited their fears, and with true priestly. craft persuaded them to give sure pledges that no outbreak should take place, although he denied all belief in the possibility of such an event. The citizens, overcome by his oily and false words, willingly gave their pledges, and were from that time in the archbishop's power. The wily prelate then, finding the great demagogue was still followed by dangerous and threatening crowds, appointed <num value="2">two</num> burgesses and other spies to watch Fitzosbert, and, when it was possible, to apprehend him.
<p>These men at a convenient time set upon Fitzosbert, to bind and carry him off, but Longbeard was a hero at heart and full of ready courage. Snatching up an axe, he defended himself manfully, slew <num value="1">one</num> of the archbishop's emissaries, and flew at once for sanctuary into the Church of St. Mary Row. Barring the doors and retreating to the tower, he and some trusty friends turned it into a small fortress, till at last his enemies, gathering thicker round him and setting the steeple on fire, forced Longbeard and a woman whom he loved, and who had followed him there, into the open street.
<p>As the deserted demagogue was dragged forth through the fire and smoke, still loth to yield, a son of the burgess whom he had stricken dead ran. forward and stabbed him in the side. The wounded. man was quickly overpowered, for the citizens, afraid, to forfeit their pledges, did not come to his. aid as he had expected, and he was hurried to the Tower, where the expectant archbishop sat ready <pb id="p.310" n="310"> to condemn him. We can imagine what that drum-head trial would be like. Longbeard was at once condemned, and with <num value="9">nine</num> of his adherents, scorched and smoking from the fire, was sentenced to be hung on a gibbet at the Smithfield Elms. For all this, the fermentation did not soon subside; the people too late remembered how Fitzosbert had pleaded for their rights, and braved king, prelate, and baron; and they loudly exclaimed against the archbishop for breaking sanctuary, and putting to death a man who had only defended himself against assassins, and was innocent of other crimes. The love for the dead man, indeed, at last rose to such a height that the rumour ran that miracles were wrought by even touching the chains by which he had been bound in the Tower. He became for a time a saint to the poorer and more suffering subjects. of the Normans, and the place where he was beheaded in Smithfield was visited as a spot of special holiness.
<p>But this riot of Longbeard's was but the threatening of a storm. A tempest longer and more terrible broke over Cheapside on <QUOTE>Evil May Day,</QUOTE> in the reign of Henry VIII. Its origin was the jealousy of the Lombards and other foreign money-lenders and craftsmen entertained by the artisans and prentices of London. Its actual cause was the seduction of a citizen's wife by a Lombard named Francis de Bard, of Lombard Street. The loss of the wife might have been borne, but the wife took with her, at the Italian's solicitation, a box of her husband's plate.

<p> <QUOTE>This abuse,</QUOTE> says Holinshed, <QUOTE>was much hated; so that the same and manie other oppressions done by the Lombards increased such a malice in the Englishmen's hearts, that at the last it burst out. or amongst others that sore grudged these matters was a broker in London, called John Lincolne, that busied himself so farre in the matter, that about Palme Sundie, in the <num value="8">eighth</num> yeare of the King's reign, he came to <num value="1">one</num> Doctor Henry Standish with these words:  <Q>Sir, I understand that you shall preach at the Sanctuarie, Spittle, on ondaie in Easter Weeke, and so it is, that Englishmen, both merchants and others. are undowne, for strangers have more liberty in this land than Englishmen, which is against all reason, and also against the commonweal of the realm. I beseech you, therefore, to declare this in your sermon, and in soe doing you shall deserve great thanks of my Lord Maior and of all his brethren ;</Q>  and herewith he offered unto the said Doctor Standish a bill containing this matter more at large. <gap> Dr. Standish refused to have anything to do with the matter, and John Lincolne went to Dr. Bell, a chanon of the same Spittle, that was appointed likewise to preach upon the Tuesday in Easter Weeke, whome he perswaded to read his said bill in the pulpit.</QUOTE>
<p>This bill complained vehemently of the poverty of London artificers, who were starving, while the foreigners swarmed everywhere; also that the English merchants were impoverished by foreigners, who imported all silks, cloth of gold, wine, and iron, so that people scarcely cared even to buy of an Englishman. Moreover, the writer declared that foreigners had grown so numerous that, on a Sunday in the previous Lent, he had seen <num value="600">600</num> strangers shooting together at the popinjay. He also insisted on the fact of the foreigners banding in fraternities, and clubbing together so large a fund, that they could overpower even the City of London.
<p>Lincoln having won over Dr. Bell to read the complaint, went round and told every <num value="1">one</num> he knew that shortly they would have news; and excited the &lsquo;prentices and artificers to expect some speedy rising against the foreign merchants and workmen. n due time the sermon was preached, and Dr. Bell drew a strong picture of the riches and indolence of the foreigners, and the struggling and poverty of English craftsmen.
<p>The train was ready, and on such occasions the devil is never far away with the spark. The Sunday after the sermon, Francis de Bard, the aforesaid Lombard, and other foreign merchants, happened --to be in the King's Gallery at Greenwich Palace, and were laughing and boasting over Bard's intrigue with the citizen's wife. Sir Thomas Palmer, to whom they spoke, said, <QUOTE>Sirs, you have too much favour in England ;</QUOTE> and <num value="1">one</num> William Bolt, a merchant, added, <QUOTE>Well, you Lombards, you rejoice now; but, by the masse, we will <num value="1">one</num> day have a fling at you, come when it will.</QUOTE> And that saying the other merchants affirmed. This tale was re, ported about London.
<p>The attack soon came. <QUOTE>On the <datestruct VALUE="1513-04-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1513">1513</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE> says Holinshed, <QUOTE><p>some young citizens picked quarrels with the strangers, insulting them in various ways, in the streets; upon which certain of the said citizens were sent to prison. Then suddenly rose a secret rumour, and no <num value="1">one</num> could tell how it began, that on May-day next the City would rise against the foreigners, and slay them; insomuch that several of the strangers fled from the City. This rumour reached the King's Council, and, <pb id="p.311" n="311"> Cardinal Wolsey sent for the Mayor, to ask him what he knew of it; upon which the Mayor told him that peace should be kept. The Cardinal told him to take pains that it should be. The Mayor came from the Cardinal's at <num value="4">four</num> in the afternoon of May-day eve, and in all haste sent for his brethren to the Guildhall; yet it,was almost <num value="7">seven</num> before they met. It was at last decided, with the consent of the Cardinal, that instead of a strong watch being set, which might irritate, all citizens should be warned to keep their servants within doors on the dreaded day. The Recorder and Sir Thomas More, of the King's Privy Council, came to the Guildhall, at a quarter to <measure value="9d." type=currency><num value="9">nine</num> p.</measure>m., and desired the aldermen to send to every ward, forbidding citizen's servants to go out from <measure value="7d." type=currency><num value="7">seven</num> p.</measure>m. that day to <num value="9">nine</num> a.m. of the next day.</QUOTE>

<p> <QUOTE>After this command had been given,</QUOTE> says the chronicler, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>in the evening, as Sir John Mundie  (an alderman) came from his ward, and found <num value="2">two</num> young men in Chepe, playing at the bucklers, and a great many others looking on (for the command was then scarce known), he commanded them to leave off; and when <num value="1">one</num> of them asked why, he would have had him to the counter. Then all the young &lsquo;prentices resisted the alderman, taking the young fellow from him, and crying  <Q>&lsquo;Prentices and Clubs.</Q>  Then out of every door came clubs and weapons. The alderman fled, and was in great danger. Then more people arose out of every quarter, and forth came serving men, watermen, courtiers, and others; so that by <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock there were in Chepe <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="700">seven hundred</num>; and out of Paul's Churchyard came <num value="300">300</num>, which knew not of the other. So out of all places they gathered, and broke up the counters, and took out the prisoners that the Mayor had committed for hurting the strangers; and went to Newgate, and took out Studleie and Petit, committed thither for that cause.
<p>The Mayor and Sheriff made proclamation, but no heed was paid to them. Herewith being gathered in plumps, they ran through St. Nicholas' shambles, and at St. Martin's Gate there met with them Sir Thomas More, and others, desiring them to goe to their lodgings; and as they were thus intreating, and had almost persuaded the people to depart, they within St. Martin's threw out stones, bats, and hot water, so that they hurt divers honest persons that were there with Sir Thomas More; insomuch as at length <num value="1">one</num> Nicholas Downes, a sergeant of arms, being there with the said Sir Thomas More, and sore hurt amongst others, cried  <Q>Down with them!</Q>  and then all the misruled persons ran to the doors and windows of the houses round Saint Martin's, and spoiled all that they found.
<p>After that they ran headlong into Cornhill, and there likewise spoiled divers houses of the French men that dwelled within the gate of Master Newton's house, called Queene Gate. This Master Newton was a Picard borne, and reputed to be a. great favourer of Frenchmen in their occupiengs and trades, contrary to the laws of the Citie. If the people had found him, they had surelie have stricken off his head; but when they found him. not,the watermen and certain young preests that were there, fell to rifling, and some ran to Blanchapelton, and broke up the strangers' houses and spoiled them. Thus from <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="11">eleven</num> of the clock these riotous people continued their outrageous doings, till about <num value="3">three</num> of the clock, at. what time they began to withdraw, and went to their places of resort; and by the way they were taken by the Maior and the heads of the Citie, and sent some of them to the Tower, some to Newgate, some to the counters, to the number of <num value="300">300</num>.
<p>Manie fled, and speciallie the watermen and preests and serving men, but the &lsquo;prentices were caught by the backs, and had to prison. In the meantime, whilst the hottest of this ruffling lasted, the Cardinall was advertised thereof by Sir Thomas Parre; whereon the Cardinall strengthened his house with men and ordnance. Sir Thomas Parre rode in all haste to Richmond, where the King lay, and informed him of the matter; who incontinentlie sent forth hastilie to London, to understand the state of the Citie, and was truely advertised how the riot had ceased, and manie of the misdoers apprehended. The Lieutenant of the Tower, Sir Roger Cholmeleie (no great friend to the Citie), in a frantike furie, during the time of this uprore, shot off certaine pieces of ordinance against the Citie, and though they did no great harm, yet he won much evil will for his hastie doing, because men thought he did it of malice, rather than of any discretion.
<P>About <num value="5">five</num> o'clock, the Earls of Shrewsbury and Surrey, Thomas Dockerin, Lord of Saint John's George Neville, Lord of Abergavenny, came to London with such force as they could gather in haste, and so did the Innes of Court. Then were the prisoners examined, and the sermon of Dr. Bell brought to remembrance, and he sent to the Tower. Herewith was a Commission of Oyer and Determiner, directed to the Duke of Norfolk and other lords, to the Lord Mayor of London, and the aldermen, and to all the justices of England, for punishment of this insurrection. (The Citie thought the Duke bare them a grudge for a lewd preest of <pb id="p.312" n="312">

<p>At the time of the examination the streets were filled with harnessed men, who spake very opprobrious words to the citizens, which the latter, although <num value="200">two hundred</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, bore patiently. The inquiry was held at the house of Sir John Fineux, Lord Chief Justice of England, neare to St. Bride's, in Fleet Street.
<p>When the lords were met at the Guildhall, the

 prisoners were brought through the street, tied in ropes, some men, and some lads of <num value="13">thirteen</num> years of age. Among them were divers not of the City, some-priests, some husbandmen and labourers. The whole number amounted unto <num value="200">two hundred</num>, <num value="3">three</num> score, and eighteen persons. Eventually, <num value="13">thirteen</num> were found guilty, and adjudged to be hanged, drawn, and quartered. <num value="11">Eleven</num> pairs of gallows were set up in various places where the offences had been committed, as at Aldgate, Blanchappleton, Gratious Street, Leaden Hall, and before every Counter. <num value="1">One</num> also at Newgate, St. Martin's, at Aldersgate, and Bishopsgate. Then were the prisoners that were judged brought to those places of execution, and executed in the most rigorous <pb id="p.314" n="314"> manner in the presence of the Lord Edward Howard, son to the Duke of Norfolke, a knight marshal, who showed no mercie, but extreme crueltie to the poore yonglings in their execution; and likewise the duke's servants spake many opprobrious words. On Thursday, <datestruct value="05-7"><month reg="05">May</month> the <day reg=7>7th</day></datestruct>, was Lincolne, Shirwin, and <num value="2">two</num> brethren called Bets, and diverse other persons, adjudged to die and Lincolne said,  <Q>My lords, I meant well, for if you knew the mischiefe that is insued in this realme by strangers, you would remedie it. And many times I have complained, and then I was called a busie fellow; now, our Lord have mercie on me!</Q>  They were laid on hurdels and drawne to the Standard in Cheape, and <num value="1">first</num> was John Lincolne executed; and as the others had the ropes about their neckes, there came a commandment from the king to respit the execution. Then the people cried,  <Q> God save the king! </Q>  and so was the oier and terminer deferred till another daie, and the prisoners sent againe to ward. The armed men departed out of London, and all things set in quiet.
<p>On the <datestruct value="05-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, the king being at Greenwich, the Recorder of London and several aldermen sought his presence to ask pardon for the late riot, and to beg for. mercy for the prisoners; which petition the king sternly refused, saying that although it might be that the substantial citizens did not actually take part in the riot, it was evident, from their supineness in putting it down, that they  <Q>winked at the matter.</Q>
<p>On Thursday, the <datestruct value="05-22"><day reg="22">22nd</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, the king, attended by the cardinal and many great lords, sat in person in judgment in Westminster Hall, the mayor, aldermen, and all the chief men of the City being present in their best livery. The king commanded that all the prisoners should be brought forth, so that in came the poore yonglings and old false knaves, bound in ropes, all along <num value="1">one</num> after another in their shirts, and everie <num value="1">one</num> a halter about his necke, to the number of now foure <num value="100">hundred</num> men and <num value="11">eleven</num> women; and when all were come before the king's presence, the cardinall sore laid to the maior and commonaltie their negligence; and to the prisoners he declared that they had deserved death for their offense. Then all the prisoners together cried,  <Q>Mercie, gratious lord, mercie!</Q>  Herewith the lords altogither besought his grace of mercie, at whose sute the king pardoned them all. Then the cardinal gave unto them a good exhortation, to the great gladnesse of the hearers.
<p>Now when the generall pardon was pronounced all the prisoners shouted at once, and altogither cast up their halters into the hall roofe, so that the king might perceive they were none of the discreetest sort. Here is to be noticed that diverse offenders that were not taken, hearing that the king was inclined to mercie, came well apparelled to Westminster, and suddenlie stripped them into their shirts with halters, and came in among the prisoners, willinglie to be partakers of the king's pardon; by which dooing it was well known that <num value="1">one</num> John Gelson, yeoman of the Crowne, was the <num value="1">first</num> that began to spoile, and exhorted others to doe the same; and because he fled and was not taken, he came in with a rope among the other prisoners, and so had his pardon. This companie was after called the  <Q>black-wagon.</Q>  Then were all the gallows within the Citie taken downe, and many a good prayer said for the king.</QUOTE>

</LIST></ARGUMENT>

<P>We do not hear much in the old chronicles of tournaments and shivered spears in Cheapside, but of gorgeous pageants much. On coronation days, and days when our kings rode from the Tower to Westminster, or from Castle Baynard. eastward, Cheapside blossomed at once with flags and banners, rich tapestry hung from every window, and the very gutters ran with wine, so loyal and generous were the citizens of those early days. Costume was bright and splendid in the Middle Ages, and heraldry kept alive the habit of contrasting and mingling colours. Citizens were wealthy, and, moreover, lavish of their wealth.
<p>In these processions and pageants, Cheapside was always the very centre of the show. There velvets and silks trailed; there jewels shone; there spearheads and axe-heads glittered; there breastplates and steel caps gleamed; there proud horses fretted; there bells clashed; there the mob clamoured; there proud, warlike, and beautiful face; showed, uncapped and unveiled, to the seething, jostling people; rand there mayor and aldermen grew hottest, bowed most, and puffed out with fullest dignity.
<p>In order to celebrate the birth of the heir of England (the Black Prince, <datestruct value="1330--"><year reg="1330">1330</year></datestruct>), a great tournament was proclaimed in London. Philippa and all the female nobility were invited to be present. <num value="13">Thirteen</num> knights were engaged on each side, and the tournament was held in Cheapside, between Wood Street and Queen Street; the highway was covered with sand, to prevent the horses' feet from slipping, and a grand temporary wooden tower was erected, for the accommodation of the Queen and her ladies. But scarcely had this fair company entered the tower, when the scaffolding suddenly gave way, and all present fell to the ground with the Queen. Though no <num value="1">one</num> was injured, all were terribly frightened, and great confusion ensued. <pb id="p.316" n="316">
<p>When the young king saw the peril of his wife, he flew into a tempest of rage, and vowed that the careless carpenters who had constructed the building should instantly be put to death. Whether he would thus far have stretched the prerogative of an English sovereign can never be known (says Miss trickland), for his angelic partner, scarcely recovered from the terror of her fall, threw herself on her knees before the incensed king, and so effectually pleaded for the pardon of the poor men, that Edward became pacified, and forgave them.
<p>When the young princess, Anne of Bohemia, the <num value="1">first</num> wife of the royal prodigal, Richard II., entered London, a castle with towers was erected at the upper end of Cheapside. On the wooden battlements stood fair maidens, who blew gold leaf on the King, Queen, and retinue, so that the air seemed filled with golden butterflies. This pretty device was much admired. The maidens also threw showers of counterfeit gold coins before the horses' feet of the royal cavalcade, while the <num value="2">two</num> sides of the tower ran fountains of red wine.
<p>On the great occasion when this same Anne, who had by this time supped full of troubles, and by whose entreaties the proud, reckless young king, who had, as it were, excommunicated the City and now forgave it, came again into Chepe, red and white wine poured in fountains from a tower opposite the Great Conduit. The King and Queen were served from golden cups, and at the same place an angel flew down in a cloud, and presented costly golden circlets to Richard and his young wife.
<p><num value="2">Two</num> days before the opening of Parliament, in <datestruct value="1423--"><year reg="1423">1423</year></datestruct>, Katherine of Valois, widow of Henry V., entered the city in a chair of state, with her child sitting on her knee. When they arrived at the west door of St. Paul's Cathedral, the Duke Protector lifted the infant king from his chair and set him on his feet, and, with the Duke of Exeter, led him between them up the stairs going into the choir; then, having knelt at the altar for a time, the child was borne into the churchyard, there set upon a fair courser, and so conveyed through Cheapside to his own manor of Kennington.
<p>Time went on, and the weak young king married the, fair amazon of France, the revengeful and resolute
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.316.1">Margaret of Anjou</lemma>. At the marriage pageant maidens acted, at the Cheapside conduit, a play representing the <num value="5">five</num> wise and <num value="5">five</num> foolish virgins. Years after, the corpse of the same king passed along the same street; but no huzzas, no rejoicing now. .It was on the day after the restoration of Edward IV., when people dared not speak above a breath of what might be happening in the Tower, that the corpse of Henry VI. was borne through Cheapside to St. Paul's, barefaced, on a bier, so that all might see it, though it was surrounded by more brown bills and glaives than torches.
<p>By-and-by, after the fierce retribution of Bosworth, came the Tudors, culminating and ending with Elizabeth.
<p>As
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.316.2">Elizabeth of York</lemma> (Henry VII.'s consort) went from the Tower to Westminster to be crowned, the citizens hung velvets and cloth of gold from the windows in Chepe, and stationed children, dressed like angels, to sing praises to the Queen as she passed by. When the Queen's corpse was conveyed from the Tower, where she died, in Cheapside were stationed <num value="37">thirty-seven</num> virgins, the number corresponding with the Queen's age, all dressed in white, wearing chaplets of white and green, and bearing lighted tapers.
<p>As
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.316.3">Anne Boleyn</lemma><NOTE resp=B>

<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.316.4">Anne Boleyn's Autograph</LEMMA></NOTE>, during her short felicity, proceeded from the Tower to Westminster, on the eve of her coronation, the conduit of Cheapside ran, at <num value="1">one</num> end white wine, and at the other red. At Cheapside Cross stood all the aldermen, from amongst whom advanced Master Walter, the City Recorder, who presented the Queen with a purse, containing a <measure value="1000bmark" type=currency><num value="1000">thousand</num> marks</measure> of gold, which she very thankfully accepted, with many goodly words. At the Little Conduit of Cheapside was a rich pageant, full of melody and song, where Pallas, Venus, and Juno gave the Queen an apple of gold, divided into <num value="3">three</num> compartments, typifying wisdom, riches, and felicity.
<p>When Queen Elizabeth, young, happy and regal, proceeded through the City the day before her coronation, as she passed through Cheapside, she smiled; and being asked the reason, she replied, <QUOTE>Because I have just heard <num value="1">one</num> say in the crowd,  <Q>I remember old King Harry the <num value="8">Eighth</num>.</Q> </QUOTE> When she came to the grand allegory of Time and Truth, at the Little Conduit, in Cheapside, she asked, who an old man was that sat with his scythe and hour-glass.

<p>In this pageant she spied that Truth held a Bible, in English, ready for presentation to her; and she bade Sir John Perrot (the knight nearest to her, who held up her canopy, and a kinsman, afterwards beheaded) to step forward and receive it for her; but she was informed such was not the regular manner of presentation, for it was to be let down into her chariot by a silken string. She therefore told Sir John Perrot to stay; and at the proper crisis, some verses being recited by Truth, the book descended, <QUOTE>and the Queen received it in both her hands, kissed it, clasped it to her bosom, and thanked the City for this present, esteemed <pb id="p.317" n="317"> above all others. She promised to read it diligently, to the great comfort of the bystanders.</QUOTE> All the houses in Cheapside were dressed with banners and streamers, and the richest carpets, stuffs, and cloth of gold tapestried the streets. At the upper end of Chepe, the Recorder presented the Queen from the City, with a handsome crimson satin purse, containing a <measure value="1000bmark" type=currency><num value="1000">thousand</num> marks</measure> in gold, which she most graciously pocketed. There were trumpeters at the Standard in Chepe, and the City waits stood at the porch of St. Peter's, Cornhill. The City companies stretched in rows from Fenchurch Street to the Little Conduit in Chepe, behind rails, which were hung with cloth.
<p>On an occasion when James I. and his wife visited the City, at the Conduit, Cheapside, there was a grand display of tapestry, gold cloth, and silks; and before the structure <QUOTE rend=blockquote>a handsome apprentice was appointed, whose part it was to walk backwards and forwards, as if outside a shop, in his flat cap and usual dress, addressing the passengers with his usual cry for custom of,  <Q>What d&lsquo;ye lack, gentles?

<p>But what are royal processions to the Lord Mayor's Show?
<p>The earliest civic show on record, writes Mr. Fairholt, who made a specialty of this subject, took place in <datestruct value="1236--"><year reg="1236">1236</year></datestruct>, on the passage of Henry III. and Eleanor of Provence through the City to Westminster. They were escorted by the mayor, aldermen, and <num value="360">360</num> mounted citizens, apparelled in robes of embroidered silk, and each carrying in their hands a cup of gold or silver, in token of the privilege claimed by the City for the lord mayor to officiate as chief butler at the king's coronation. On the return of Edward I. from the Holy Land the citizens, in the wildness of their loyalty, threw, it is said, handfuls of gold and silver out of window to the crowd. It was on the return of the same king from his Scotch victories that the earliest known City pageant took place. Each guild had its show. The Fishmongers had gilt salmon and sturgeon, drawn by <num value="8">eight</num> horses, and <num value="6">six</num>-and-<num value="40">forty</num> knights riding sea-horses, followed by St. Magnus  (it was St. Magnus' day), with <num value="1000">1,000</num> horsemen.
<p>Mr. Fairholt proved from papers still preserved by the Grocers' Company that water processions took place at least <num value="19">nineteen</num> years earlier than the usual date (<datestruct value="1453"><year reg="1453">1453</year></datestruct>) set down for their commencement. Sir John Norman is mentioned by the City poet as the <num value="1">first</num> Lord Mayor that rowed to Westminster. He had silver oars, and so delighted the London watermen that they wrote a ballad about him, of which <num value="2">two</num> lines only still exist--

<p>In the troublous reign of Henry VI. the Goldsmiths made a special stand for their privileges on Lord Mayor's day.

On their return they landed at Paul's Wharf, where they took horse, <QUOTE>and in great pomp passed through the great street of the city called Cheapside.</QUOTE> The road was cleared by beadles and men dressed as devils, and wild men, whose clubs discharged squibs. <num value="1">First</num> came <num value="2">two</num> great standards, bearing the arms of the City and of the Lord Mayor's company; then <num value="2">two</num> drums, a flute, and an ensign of the City, followed by <num value="70">seventy</num> or <num value="80">eighty</num> poor men, <num value="2">two</num> by <num value="2">two</num>, in blue gowns with red sleeves, each <num value="1">one</num> bearing a pike and a target, with the arms of the Lord Mayor's company. These were succeeded by <num value="2">two</num> more banners, a set of hautboys playing; after these came wyfflers, or clearers of the way, in velvet coats and gold chains, and with white staves in their hands. After the pageant itself paced <num value="16">sixteen</num> trumpeters, more wyfflers to clear the way, and after them the bachelors-<num value="60">sixty</num>, <num value="80">eighty</num>, or <num value="100">one hundred</num>--of the Lord Mayor's company, in long gowns, with crimson satin hoods. These bachelors were to wait on the Mayor. Then followed <num value="12">twelve</num> more trumpeters and the drums and flutes of the City, an ensign of the Mayor's company, the City waits in blue gowns, red sleeves, and silver chains; then the honourable livery, in long robes, each with his hood, half black, half red, on his left shoulder. After them came sheriffs' officers and Mayor's officers, the common serjeant, and the chamberlain. Before the Mayor went the swordbearer in his cap of honour, the sword, in a sheath set with pearls, in his right hand; while on his left came the common cryer, with the great gilt club and a mace on his shoulder. The Mayor wore a long scarlet gown, with black velvet hood and rich gold collar about his neck; and with him rode that fallen dignitary, the ex-Mayor. Then followed all the aldermen, in scarlet gowns and black velvet tippets, those that had been mayors wearing gold chains. The <num value="2">two</num> sheriffs came last of all, in scarlet gowns and gold chains. About <num value="1000">one thousand</num> persons sat down to dinner at Guildhall-a feast which cost the Mayor and the <num value="2">two</num> sheriffs <measure value="400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="400">400</num></measure>, whereof the Mayor disbursed <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="200">200</num></measure>. Immediately after dinner they went to evening prayer at St. Paul's, the poor men aforementioned carrying torches and targets. The dinner still continues to be eaten, but the service at St Paul's, as interfering with digestion, was abandoned after the Great Fire. In the evening farewell speeches were made to the Lord Mayor by allegorical personages, and painted posts were set up at his door.
<p><num value="1">One</num> of the most gorgeous Lord Mayor's shows was that of <datestruct value="1616--"><year reg="1616">1616</year></datestruct> (James I.) devised by Anthony Munday, <num value="1">one</num> of the great band of Shakesperean dramatists, who wrote plays in partnership with Drayton. The drawings for the pageant are still in the possession of the Fishmongers' Company. The new mayor was John Leman, a member of that body (knighted during his mayoralty). The <num value="1">first</num> pageant represented a buss, or Dutch fishing-boat, on wheels. The fishermen in it were busy drawing up nets full of live fish and throwing them to the people. On the mast and at the head of the boat were the insignia of the company-St. Peter's keys and <num value="2">two</num> arms supporting a crown. The <num value="2">second</num> pageant was a gigantic crowned dolphin, ridden by Arion. The <num value="3">third</num> pageant was the king of the Moors riding on a golden leopard, and scattering gold and silver freely round him. He was attended by <num value="6">six</num> tributary kings in gilt armour on horseback, each carrying a dart and gold and silver ingots. his pageant was in honour of the Fishmongers' brethren,the Goldsmiths. The <num value="4">fourth</num> pageant was the usual pictorial pun on the Lord Mayor's name and crest. The car bore a large lemon-tree full of golden fruit, with a pelican in her nest feeding her young (proper). At the top of the tree sat <num value="5">five</num> children, representing the <num value="5">five</num> senses. The boys were dressed as women, each with her emblemeeing, by an eagle; Hearing, by a hart; Touch, by a spider; Tasting, by an ape; and Smelling, by a dog. The <num value="5">fifth</num> pageant was Sir William Walworth's bower, which was hung with the shields of all lord mayors who had been Fishmongers. Upon a tomb within the bower was laid the effigy in knightly armour of Sir William, the slayer of Wat Tyler. <num value="5">Five</num> mounted knights attended the car, and a mounted man-at-arms bore Wat Tyler's head upon a dagger. In attendance were <num value="6">six</num> trumpeters and <num value="24">twenty-four</num> halberdiers, arrayed in light blue silk, emblazoned with the Fishmongers' arms on the breast and Walworth's on the back. Then followed an angel with golden wings and crown, riding on horseback, who, on the Lord Mayor's approach, with a golden rod awoke Sir William from his long sleep, and the <num value="2">two</num> then became speakers in the interlude.
<p>The great central pageant was a triumphal car drawn by <num value="2">two</num> mermen and <num value="2">two</num> mermaids. In the highest place at a guardian angel defending the crown of Richard II., who sat just below her. Under the king sat female personifications of the royal virtues, Truth, Virtue, Honour, Temperance, Fortitude, Zeal, Equity, Conscience, beating down reason and Mutiny, the <num value="2">two</num> last being enacted <QUOTE>by burly men.</QUOTE> In a seat corresponding with the king's sat Justice, and below her Authority, Law, Vigilance, Peace, Plenty, and Discipline. <pb id="p.321" n="321">
<p>Shirley, the dramatist (Charles I.) has described the Show in his <title>Contention for Honour and Riches</title> (<datestruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>). Clod, a sturdy countryman, exclaims, <QUOTE>I am plain Clod; I care not a beanstalk for the best <hi rend=italics>what lack you</hi> on you all. No, not the next day after Simon and Jude, when you go a-feasting to Westminster with your galley-foist and your pot-guns, to the very terror of the paper whales; when you land in shoals, and make the understanders in Cheapside wonder to see ships swim on men's shoulders; when the fencers flourish and make the king's liege people fall down and worship the devil and St. Dunstan; when your whifflers are hanged in chains, and Hercules Club spits fire about the pageants, though the poor children catch cold that shone like painted cloth, and are only kept alive with sugarplums; with whom, when the word is given, you march to Guildhall, with every man his, spoon in his pocket, where you look upon the giants, and feed like Saracens, till you have no stomach to go to St. Paul's in the afternoon. I have seen your processions, and heard your lions and camels make speeches, instead of grace before and after dinner. I have heard songs, too, or something like &lsquo;em; but the porters have had all the burden, who were kept sober at the City charge <num value="2">two</num> days before, to keep time and tune with their feet; for; brag what you will of your charge, all your pomp lies upon their back.</QUOTE> In <title>Honoria and Memoria,</title>
<datestruct value="1652--"><year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct>, Shirley has again repeated this humorous and graphic description of the land and water pageants of the good citizens of the day; he has, however, abridged the general detail, and added some degree of indelicacy to his satire. He alludes to the wild men that cleared the way, and their fireworks, in these words: <QUOTE>I am not afeard of your green Robin Hoods, that fright with fiery club your pitiful spectators, that take pains to be stifled, and adore the wolves and camels of your company.</QUOTE>
<p>Pepys, always curious, always chatty, has, of course, several notices of Lord Mayors' shows; for instance:--

Lady Davis is now come to our next lodgings, and she locked up the lead's door from'me, which puts me in great disquiet.
<p><datestruct VALUE="1663-10-29"><month reg="10">Oct.</month> <day reg=29>29</day>, <year reg=1663>1663</year></datestruct>.-Up, it being Lord Mayor's Day (Sir Anthony Bateman). This morning was brought home my new velvet cloak--that is, lined with velvet, a good cloth the outside--the <num value="1">first</num> that ever I had in my life, and I pray God it may not be too soon that I begin to wear it. I thought it better to go without it because of the crowde, and so I did not wear it. At noon I went to Guildhall, and, meeting with Mr. Proby, Sir R. Ford's son, and Lieutenant-Colonel Baron, a City commander, we went up and down to see the tables, where under every salt there was a bill of fare, and at the end of the table the persons proper for the table. Many were the tables, but none in the hall but the mayor's and the lords of the privy council that had napkins or knives, which was very strange. We went into the buttry, and there stayed and talked, and then into the hall again, and there wine was offered and they drunk, I only drinking some hypocras, which do not break my vowe, it being, to the best of my present judgment, only a mixed compound drink, and not any wine. If I am mistaken, God forgive me! But I do hope and think I am not. By-and-by met with Creed, and we with the others went within the several courts, and there saw the tables prepared for the ladies, and judges, and bishops-all great signs of a great dining to come. By-and-by, about <num value="1">one</num> o'clock, before the Lord Mayor come, came into the hall, from the room where they weie <num value="1">first</num> led into, the Chancellor, Archbishopp before him, with the Lords of the Council, and other bishopps, and they to dinner. Anon comes the Lord Mayor, who went up to the lords, and then to the other tables, to bid wellcome; and so all to dinner. I sat near Proby, Baron, and Creed, at the merchant strangers' table, where <num value="10">ten</num> good dishes to a messe, with plenty of wine of all sorts, of which I drank none; but it was very unpleasing that we had no napkins nor change of trenchers, and drunk out of earthen pitchers and wooden dishes. It happened that after the lords had half dined, came the French ambassador up to the lords' table, where <pb id="p.322" n="322"> he was to have sat; he would not sit down nor dine with the Lord Mayor, who was not yet come, nor have a table to himself, which was offered, but, in a discontent, went away again. After I had dined, I and Creed rose and went up and down the house, and up to the ladies' room, and there stayed gazing upon them. But though there were many and fine, both young and old, yet I could not discern <num value="1">one</num> handsome face there, which was very strange. I expected musique, but there was none, but only trumpets and drums, which displeased me. The dinner, it seems, is made by the mayor and <num value="2">two</num> sheriffs for the time being, the Lord Mayor paying <num value="1">one</num> half, and they the other; and the whole, Proby says, is reckoned to come to about <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="800">eight hundred</num> at most. Being wearied with looking at a company of ugly women, Creed and I went away, and took coach, and through Cheapside, and there saw the pageants, which were very silly. The Queene mends apace, they say, but yet talks idle still.</QUOTE>

<p>The last Lord Mayor's pageant of the old school was in <datestruct value="1702--"><year reg="1702">1702</year></datestruct> (Queen Anne), when Sir Samuel Dashwood, vintner, entertained her Majesty at the Guildhall.

At St. <pb id="p.323" n="323"> Paul's Churchyard the saint made a stand, and, drawing his sword, cut off half his crimson scarf, and gave it to some beggars and cripples who importuned him for charity.

<p>Sir Samuel Fludyer, Lord Mayor of London in the year <datestruct value="1761"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>, the year of the marriage of good King George III., appears to have done things with thoroughness..

Our sight-seer was an early riser.

He took boat on the Thames, that he--might accompany the procession of state barges on their way to Westminster. He reports <QUOTE>the silent highway</QUOTE> as being quite covered with boats and gilded barges.

The barge belonging to the Stationers' Company, after having passed through <num value="1">one</num> of the narrow arches of Westminster Bridge, and tacked about to do honour to the Lord Mayor's landing, touched at Lambeth and took on board, from the archbishop's palace, a hamper of claret--the annual tribute of theology to learning.

The Lord Mayor encountered good Samaritans in'the shape of the master and benchers of the Temple, who invited him to come on shore and lunch with them in the Temple Hall.
<p>Every house from Temple Bar to Guildhall was crowded from top to bottom, and many had scaffoldings besides; carpets and rich hangings were hung out on the fronts all the way along; and our friend notes that the citizens were not mercenary, but <QUOTE>generously accommodated their friends and customers gratis, and entertained them in the most elegant manner, so that though their--shops were shut, they might be said to have kept open house.</QUOTE>

Our sight-seer, as the royal family passed his window, counted between <num value="20">twenty</num> and <num value="30">thirty</num> coaches-and-<num value="6">six</num> belonging to then and to their attendants, besides those <pb id="p.324" n="324"> of the foreign ambassadors, officers of state, and the principal nobility. There preceded their Majesties the Duke of Cumberland, Princess Amelia, the Duke of York, in a new state coach the Princes William Henry and Frederic, the Princess Dowager of Wales, and the Princesses Augusta and Caroline in <num value="1">one</num> coach, preceded by <num value="12">twelve</num> footmen with black caps, followed by guards and a grand retinue. The king and queen were in separate coaches, and had separate retinues. Our friend in the window of the <QUOTE>Queen's Arms</QUOTE> was in luck's way. From a booth at the eastern end of the churchyard the children of Christ Church Hospital paid their respects to their Majesties, the senior scholar of the grammar school reciting a lengthy and loyal address, after which the boys chanted <QUOTE>God Save the King.</QUOTE> At last the royal family got to the house of Mr. Barclay, the Quaker, from the balcony of which, hung with crimson silk damask, they were to see, with what daylight remained, the civic procession that presently followed; but in the interval came Mr. Pitt, in his chariot, accompanied by Earl-Temple. The great commoner was then in the zenith of his popularity, and our sight-seer narrates how, <QUOTE>at every step, the mob clung about every part of the vehicle, hung upon the wheels, hugged his footmen, and even kissed his horses. There was an universal huzza, and the gentlemen at the windows

 and the balconies waved their hats, and the ladies their handkerchiefs.</QUOTE>
<p>The Lord Mayor's state coach was drawn by <num value="6">six</num> beautiful iron-grey horses, gorgeously caparisoned, and the companies made a grand appearance. Even a century ago, howeveri degeneracy had set in. Our sight-seer complains that the Armourers' and Braziers', the Skinners' and Fishmongers' Companies were the only companies that had anything like the pageantry exhibited of old on the occasion. The Armourers sported an archer riding erect in his car, having his bow in his left hand, and his quiver and arrows hanging behind his left shoulder; also a man in complete armour. The Skinners were distinguished by <num value="7">seven</num> of their company being dressed in fur, having their skins painted in the form of Indian princes. The pageant of the Fishmongers consisted of a statue of St. Peter finely gilt, a dolphin, <num value="2">two</num> mermaids, and a couple of seahorses; all which duly passed before Georgius Rex as he leaned over the balcony with his Charlotte by his side.
<p>Our chronicler understood well the strategic movements indispensable to the zealous sight-seer. As soon as the Lord Mayor's procession had passed him, he <QUOTE>posted along the back lanes, to avoid the crowd,</QUOTE> and got to the Guildhall in advance of the Lord Mayor. He had procured a ticket for the banquet through the interest of a friend, who <pb id="p.325" n="325">
<FIGURE id="Fig.325" n="2000.06.0116"><HEAD>The Royal Banquet in Guildhall. From a Contemporary Print (See Page <num value="326">326</num>).</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <pb id="p.326" n="326"> was <num value="1">one</num> of the committee for managing the entertainment, and also a <QUOTE>mazarine.</QUOTE> It is explained that this was a kind of nickname given to the common councilmen, on account of their wearing mazarine blue silk gowns. He learned that the doors of the hall had been <num value="1">first</num> opened at <num value="9">nine</num> in the morning for the admission of ladies into the galleries, who were the friends of the committee men, and who got the best places; and subsequently at <num value="12">twelve</num> for the general reception of all who had a right to come in. What a terrible spell of waiting those fortunate unfortunates comprising, the earliest batch must have had!. The galleries presented a very brilliant show, and among the company below were all the officers of state, the principal nobility, and the foreign ambassadors. The Lord Mayor arrived at half-past <num value="6">six</num>, and the sheriffs went straight to Mr. Barclay's to conduct the royal family to the hall . The passage from the hall-gate to steps leading to the King's Bench was lined by mazarines with candles in their hands, by aldermen in their red gowns, and gentlemen pensioners with their axes in their hands. At the bottom of the steps stood the Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress, with the entertainment committee, to receive the members of the royal family as theyarrived. The princes and princesses; as they successively came in, waited in the body of the hall until their Majesties' entrance. On their arrival being announced, the Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress, as the chronicler puts it, advanced to the great door of the hall; and at their Majesties' entrance, the Lord Mayor presented the City sword, which being returned, he carried before the King, the Queen following, with the Lady Mayoress behind her. <QUOTE>The music had struck up, but was drowned in the acclamations of the company; in short, all was life and joy; even the giants, Gog and Magog, seemed to be almost animated.</QUOTE> The King, at all events, was more than almost. animated; he volubly praised the splendour of the scene, and was very gracious to the Lord Mayor on the way to the council chamber, followed by the royal family and the reception committee. This room reached, the Recorder. delivered the inevitable addresses, and the wives and daughters of the aldermen were presented. These ladies had the honour of being saluted by his Majesty, and of kissing the Queen's hand, then the sheriffs were knighted, as also was the brother of the Lord Mayor.

<p>After half an hour's stay in the council chamber, the royal party returned into the hall, and weere conducted to the upper end of it, called the hustings, where a table was provided for them, at which they sat by themselves. There had been, it seems, a knotty little, question of etiquette. The ladiesin-waiting on the Queen had claimed the right of custom to dine at the same table with her Majesty, but this was disallowed; so they dined at the table of the Lady Mayoress in the King's Bench. The royal table <QUOTE>was set off with a variety of emblematic ornaments, beyond description elegant;</QUOTE> and. a superb canopy was placed over their Majesties' heads at the upper end. For the Lord Mayor, aldermen, and their ladies, there was a table on the lower hustings. The privy councillors, ministers of state, and great nobles dined at a table on the right of this; the foreign ministers at <num value="1">one</num> on the left. For the mazarines and the general company there were <num value="8">eight</num> tables laid out in the.body of the hall, while the judges, serjeants, aid other legal celebrities, dined in the old council chamber, and the attendants of the distinguished visitors were regaled in the Court of Common Pleas.
<p>George and his consort must have got up a fine appetite between noon and <num value="9">nine</num> o'clock, the hour at which the dinner was served. The aldermen on the committee acted as waiters at the royal table. he Lord Mayor stood behind the King, <QUOTE>in quality of chief butler, while the Lady Mayoress waited on her Majesty</QUOTE> in the same capacity, but soon after seats were taken they were graciously sent to their seats. The dinner consisted of <num value="3">three</num> courses, besides the dessert, and the purveyors were Messrs. Horton and Birch, the same house which in the present day supplies most of the civic banquets. The illustration which we give on the previous page is from an old print of the period representing this celebrated festival, and is interesting not merely on account of the scene which it depicts, but also as a view of Guildhall at that period.

 <pb id="p.327" n="327">
<p>In all, not including the dessert, there were placed on the tables <num value="414">four hundred and fourteen</num> dishes, hot and cold. Wine was varied and copious. In the language of the chronicler, <QUOTE>champagne, burgundy, and other valuable wines were to be had everywhere, and nothing was so scarce as water.</QUOTE> When the <num value="2">second</num> course was being laid on, the toasts began. The common crier, standing before the royal table, demanded silence, then proclaimed aloud that their Majesties drank to the health and prosperity of the Lord Mayor, aldermen, and common council of the City of London. Then the common crier, in the name of the civic dignitaries, gave the toast of health, long life, and prosperity to their most gracious Majesties. After dinner there was no tarrying over the wine-cup. The royal party retired at once to the council chamber, <QUOTE>where they had their tea.</QUOTE> What became of the rest of the company is not mentioned, but clearly the Guildhall could have been no place for them. That was summarily occupied by an army of carpenters. The tables were struck and carried out. The hustings, where the great folks had dined, and the floor of which had been covered with rich carpeting, was covered afresh, and the whole hall rapidly got ready for the ball, with which the festivities were to conclude. On the return of their majesties, and as soon as they were seated under the canopy, the ball was opened by the Duke of York and the Lady Mayoress. It does not appear that the royal couple took the floor, but <QUOTE>other minuets succeeded by the younger branches of the royal family with ladies of distinction.</QUOTE>
<p>About midnight Georgius Rex, beginning probably to get sleepy with all this derangement of his ordinarily methodical way of living, signified his desire to take his departure; but things are not always possible even when kings are in question. Such was the hurry and confusion outside-at least that is the reason assigned by the chronicler-that there was great delay in fetching up the royal carriages to the Guildhall door. Our own impression is that the coachmen were all drunk, not excepting the state coachman himself. Their Majesties waited half an hour before their coach could be brought up, and perhaps, after all the interchange of civilities, went away in a tantrum at the end. It is clear the Princess Dowager of Wales did, for she waited some time in the temporary passage, <QUOTE>nor could she be prevailed on to retire into the hall.</QUOTE> There was no procession on the return from the City. The royal people'trundled home as they best might, and according as their carriages came to hand. But we are told that on the return journey, past midnight as it was, the crowd in some places was quite as great as it had been in the daytime, and that Mr. Pitt was vociferously cheered all the way to his own door. The King and Queen did not get home to St. James's till <num value="2">two</num> o'clock in the morning, and it is a confirmation of the suggestion that the coachman must have been drunk, that in turning under the gate <num value="1">one</num> of the glasses of their coach was broken by the roof of the sentry-box. As for the festive people left behind in the Guildhall, they kept the ball up till <num value="3">three</num> o'clock, and we are told that <QUOTE>the whole was concluded with the utmost regularity and decorum.</QUOTE> Indeed, Sir Samuel Fludyer's Lord Mayor's day appears to have been a triumphant success. His Majesty himself, we are told, was pleased to declare <QUOTE>that to be elegantly entertained he must come into the City.</QUOTE> The foreign ministers in general expressed their wonder, and <num value="1">one</num> of them politely said in French, that this entertainment was only fit for <num value="1">one</num> king to give to another.
<p><num value="1">One</num> of the Barclays has left a pleasant account of this visit of George III. to the. City to see the Lord Mayor's Show:-- <QUOTE>The Queen's clothes,</QUOTE> says the lady, <QUOTE>which were as rich as gold, silver, and silk could make them, was a suit from which fell a train supported by a little page in scarlet and silver. The lustre of her stomacher was inconceivable. The King I think a very personable man. All the princes followed the King's, example in complimenting each of us with a kiss. The Queen was upstairs <num value="3">three</num> times, and my little darling, with Patty Barclay and Priscilla Bell, were introduced to her. I was present, and not a little anxious, on account of my girl, who kissed the Queen's hand with so much grace, that I thought the Princess Dowager would have smothered her with kisses. Such a report of her was made to the King, that Miss was sent for, and afforded him great amusement by saying,  <Q>that she loved the king, though she must not love fine things, and her grandpapa would not allow her to make a curtsey.</Q> --Her sweet face made such an impression on the Duke of York, that I rejoiced she was only <num value="5">five</num> instead of <num value="15">fifteen</num>. When he <num value="1">first</num> met her, he tried to persuade Miss to let him introduce her to the Queen, but she would by no means consent, till I informed her he was a prince, upon which her little female heart relented, and she gave him her hand--a true copy of the sex. The King never sat down, nor did he taste anything during the whole time. Her Majesty drank tea, which was brought her on a silver waiter by brother John, who delivered it to the lady in waiting, and she presented it kneeling. The leave they took of us was such as we might expect from <pb id="p.328" n="328"> our equals-full of apologies for our trouble for their entertainment, which they were so anxious to have explained, that the Queen came up to us as we stood on <num value="1">one</num> side of the door, and had every word interpreted. My brothers had the honour of assisting the Queen into her coach. Some of us sat up to see them return, and the King and Queen took especial notice of us as they passed. The King ordered <num value="24">twenty-four</num> of his guard to be placed opposite our door all night, lest any of the canopy should be pulled down by the mob, in which</QUOTE> (the canopy, it is to be presumed) <QUOTE>there were <num value="100">100</num> yards of silk damask.</QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>From the above particulars we learn,</QUOTE> says Dr. Doran, <QUOTE>that it was customary for our sovereigns to do honour to industry long before the period of the Great Exhibition year, which is erroneously supposed to be the opening of an era when a sort of fraternisation took place between commerce and the Crown. Under the old reign, too, the honour took a homely, but not an undignified, and if still a ceremonious, yet a hearty shape. It may be questioned, if Royalty were to pay a visit to the family of the present Mr. Barclay, whether the monarch would celebrate the brief sojourn by kissing all the daughters of  <Q> Barclay and Perkins.</Q>  He might do many things not half so pleasant.</QUOTE>
<p>The most important feature of the modern show, says Mr. Fairholt very truly, is the splendidly carved and gilt coach in which the Lord Mayor rides; and the paintings that decorate it may be considered as the relics of the ancient pageants that gave us the living representatives of the virtues and attributes of the chief magistrate here delineated. Cipriani was the artist who executed this series of paintings, in <datestruct value="1757--"><year reg="1757">1757</year></datestruct>; and they exhibit upon the panel of the right door, Fame presenting the Mayor to the genius of the City; on the left door, the same genius, attended by Britannia, who points with her spear to a shield, inscribed <QUOTE>Henry Fitz-Alwin, <datestruct value="1109--"><year reg="1109">1109</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> On each side of the doors are painted Truth, with her mirror; Temperance, holding a bridle; Justice, and Fortitude. The front panel exhibits Faith and Hope, pointing to St. Paul's; the back panel Charity, <num value="2">two</num> female figures, typical of Plenty and Riches; casting money and fruits into her lapwhile a wrecked sailor and sinking ship fill up the background. By the kind permission of the Lord Mayor we are enabled to give a representation of the ponderous old vehicle, which is still the centre of attraction every <datestruct value="11-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>.
<p>The carved work of the coach is elaborate and beautiful, consisting of Cupids supporting the City arms, &amp;c. The roof was formerly ornamented in the centre with carved work, representing <num value="4">four</num> boys supporting baskets of fruit, &amp;c. These were damaged by coming into collision with an archway leading into Blackwall Hall, about <num value="50">fifty</num> years ago; some of the figures were knocked off, and the group was entirely removed in consequence. This splendid coach was paid for by a subscription of <measure value="60l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="60">60</num></measure> from each of the junior aldermen, and such as had not passed the civic chair-its total cost being <measure value="1065l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1065">1,065</num></measure> <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure> Subsequently each alderman, when sworn into office, contributed that sum to keep it in repair; for which purpose, also, each Lord Mayor gave &pound;ioo, which was allowed to him in case the cost of the repairs during his mayoralty rendered it requisite, This arrangement was not, however, complied with for many years; after which the whole expense fell upon the Lord Mayor, and in <num value="1">one</num> year it exceeded <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure>. This outlay being considered an unjust tax upon the mayor for the time being, the amount over &pound;ioo was repaid to him, and the coach became the property of the corporation, the expenses ever since being paid by the Committee for General Purposes. Even so early as <datestruct value="20"><year reg="20">twenty</year></datestruct> years after its construction it was found necessary to repair the coach at an expense of <measure value="335l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="335">335</num></measure>; and the average expense of the repairs during <num value="7">seven</num> years of the present century is said to have been as much as <measure value="115l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="115">115</num></measure>. Hone justly observes, <QUOTE>All that remains of the Lord Mayor's Show to remind the curiously-informed of its ancient character, is the <num value="1">first</num> part of the procession. These are the poor men of the company to which the Lord Mayor belongs, habited in long gowns and close caps of the company's colour, bearing shields on their arms, but without javelins. So many of these lead the show as there are years in the Lord Mayor's age.</QUOTE>
<p>Of a later show <QUOTE>Aleph</QUOTE> gives a pleasant account. <QUOTE>I was about <num value="9">nine</num> years old,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE><p>when from a window on Ludgate Hill I watched the ponderous mayor's coach, grand and wide, with <num value="6">six</num> footmen standing on the footboard, rejoicing in bouquets as big as their heads and canes <num value="4">four</num> feet high, dragged slowly up the hill by a team of be-ribboned horses, which, as they snorted along, seemed to be fully conscious of the precious freight in the rear. Cinderella's carriage never could boast so goodly a driver; his full face, of a dusky or purple red, swelled out on each side like the breast of a pouting pigeon; his <num value="3">three</num>-cornered hat was almost hidden by wide gold lace; the flowers in his vest were fullblown and jolly, like himself; his horsewhip covered with blue ribbons, rising and falling at intervals merely for form-such horses were not made to be flogged. Coachee's box was rather a throne than a <pb id="p.329" n="329"> seat. Then a dozen gorgeous walking footmen on either hand; grave marshalmen, treading gingerly, as if they had corns; and City officers in scarlet, playing at soldiers, but looking anything but soldierly; <num value="2">two</num> trumpeters before and behind, blowing an occasional blast. <gap>

<p>How that old coach swayed to and fro, with its dignified elderly gentlemen and rubicund Lord Mayor, rejoicing in countless turtle feeds-for, reader, it was

<p>As the ark of copper, plate glass, and enamel crept slowly up the incline, a luckless sweeper-boy (in those days such dwarfed lads were forced to climb chimneys) sidled up to <num value="1">one</num> of the fore horses, and sought to detach a pink bow from his mane. The creature felt his honours diminishing, and turned to snap at the blackee. The sweep screamed, the horse neighed, the mob shouted, and Sir William turned on his pivot cushion to learn what the noise meant; and thus we were enabled to gaze on a Lord Mayor's face. In sooth he was a goodly gentleman, burly, and with <num value="3">three</num> fingers' depth of fat on his portly person, yet every feature evinced kindliness and benevolence of no common order.</QUOTE>

<p>The men in armour were from time immemorial important features in the show, and the subjects of many a jest. Hogarth introduces them in <num value="1">one</num> of his series, <title>Industry and Idleness,</title> and <title>Punch</title>
has cast many a missile at those disconsolate warriors, who all but perished under their weight of armour, degenerate race that we are!
<p>The suits of burnished mail, though generally understood to be kindly lent for the occasion by the custodian of the Tower armoury, seem now and then to have been borrowed from the playhouse, possibly for the reason that the imitation accoutrements were more showy and superb than the real.
<p>This was at any rate the case (says Mr. Dutton Cook) in <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, when Sir Claudius Hunter was Lord Mayor, and Mr. Elliston was manager of the Surrey Theatre. A melodramatic play was in preparation, and for this special object the manager had provided, at some considerable outlay, <num value="2">two</num> magnificent suits of brass and steel armour of the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century, expressly manufactured for him by Mr. Marriott of Fleet Street. No expense had been spared in rendering this harness as complete and splendid as could be. Forthwith Sir Claudius applied to Elliston for the loan of the new armour to enhance the glories of the civic pageant. The request was acceded to with the proviso that the suit of steel could only be lent in the event of the ensuing <datestruct value="11-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct> proving free from damp and fog. No such condition, however, was annexed to the loan of the brass armour; and it was understood that Mr. John Kemble had kindly undertaken to furnish the helmets of the knights with costly plumes, and personally to superintend the arrangement of these decorations. Altogether, it would seem that the mayor stood much indebted to the managers, who, willing to oblige, yet felt that their courtesywas deserving of some sort of public recognition. At least this was Elliston's view of the matter, who read with chagrin sundry newspaper paragraphs, announcing that at the approaching inauguration of Sir Claudius some of the royal armour from the Tower would be exhibited, but ignoring altogether the loan of the matchless suits of steel and brass from the Surrey Theatre. The manager was mortified; he could be generous, but he knew the worth of an advertisement. He expostulated with the future mayor. Sir Claudius replied that he did not desire to conceal the transaction, but rather than it should go forth to the world that so high a functionary as an alderman of London had made a request to a theatrical manager, he thought it advisable to inform the public that Mr. Elliston had offered the use of his property for the procession of the <num value="9">9th</num>. This was hardly a fair way of stating the case, but at length the following paragraph, drawn up by Elliston, was agreed upon for publication in the newspapers:-- <QUOTE>We understand that Mr. Elliston has lent to the Lord Mayor elect the <num value="2">two</num> magnificent suits of armour, <num value="1">one</num> of steel and the other of brass, manufactured by Marriott of Fleet Street, and which cost not less than <measure value="600l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="600">600</num></measure>. These very curious specimens of the revival of an art supposed to have been lost will be displayed in the Lord Mayor's procession, and afterwards in Guildhall, with some of the royal armour in the Tower.</QUOTE> It would seem also, according to another authority, that the wearers of the armour were members of the Surrey company.
<p>On the <num value="9">9th</num> Elliston was absent from London, but he received from <num value="1">one</num> left--in charge of his interests a particular account of the proceedings of the day:--
<p> <QUOTE>The unhandsome conduct of the Lord Mayor has occasioned me much trouble, and will give you equal displeasure. In the <num value="1">first</num> place, your paragraph never would have appeared at all had I not interfered in the matter; secondly, cropped-tailed hacks had been procured without housings, so that was compelled to obtain <num value="2">two</num> trumpeters' horses from the Horse Guards, long-tailed animals, and richly caparisoned; thirdly, the helmets which had been delivered at Mr. Kemble's house were not <pb id="p.330" n="330"> returned until <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock on the day of action, with <num value="3">three</num> miserable feathers in each, which appeared to have been plucked from the draggle tail of a hunted cock; this I also remedied by sending off at the last moment to the <num value="1">first</num> plumassier for the hire of proper feathers, and the helmets were ultimately decorated with <num value="14">fourteen</num> superb plumes; fourthly, the Lord Mayor's officer, who rode in Henry V. armour, jealous of our stately aspect, attempted to seize <num value="1">one</num> of our horses, on which your rider made as gallant a retort as ever knight in armour could have done, and the assailer was completely foiled.</QUOTE>
<p>This was bad enough, but in addition to this the narrator makes further revelation of the behind-the-scenes secrets of a civic pageant <num value="60">sixty</num> years ago. On the arrival of the procession it was found that no accommodation had been arranged for <QUOTE>Mr. Elliston's men,</QUOTE> nor were any refreshments proffered them. <QUOTE>For <num value="7">seven</num> hours they were kept within Guildhall, where they seem to have been considered as much removed from the necessities of the flesh as Gog and Magog above their heads.</QUOTE> At length the compassion, or perhaps the sense of humour, of certain of the diners was moved by the forlorn situation of the knights in armour, and bumpers of wine were tendered them. The man in steel discreetly declined this hospitable offer, alleging that after so long a fast he feared the wine would affect him injuriously. It was whispered that his harness imprisoned him so completely that eating and drinking were alike im-

 practicable to him. His comrade in brass made light of these objections, gladly took the proffered cup into his gauntleted hands, and <QUOTE>drank the red wine through the helmet barred,</QUOTE> as though he had been <num value="1">one</num> of the famous knights of Branksome Tower. It was soon apparent that the man in brass was intoxicated. He became obstreperous; he began to reel and stumble, accoutred as he was, to the hazard of his own bones and to the great dismay of bystanders. It was felt that his fall might entail disaster upon many. Attempts were made to remove him, when he assumed a pugilistic attitude, and resolutely declined to quit the hall. Nor was it possible to enlist against him t e ser. vices of his brother warrior. The man in steel sided with the man in brass, and the <num value="2">two</num> heroes thus formed a powerful coalition, which was only overcome at last by the onset of numbers. The scene altogether was of a most scandalous, if comical, description. It was some time past midnight when Mr. Marriot, the armourer, arrived at Guildhall, and at length succeeded in releasing the <num value="2">two</num> half-dead warriors from their coats of mail.
<p>After all, these famous suits of armour never returned to the wardrobe of the Surrey Theatre, or gleamed upon its stage. From Guildhall they were taken to Mr. Marriott's workshop. This, with all its contents, was accidentally consumed by fire. But the armourer's trade had taught him chivalry. At his own expense, although he had lost some <measure value="3000l." type=currency><num value="3000">three thousand</num> pounds</measure> by the fire, he provided Elliston with new suits of armour in lieu of those <pb id="p.331" n="331"> that had been destroyed. To his outlay the Lord Mayor and the City authorities contributednothing! although but for the procession of the <datestruct value="11-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct> the armour had never been in peril.
<p>The most splendid sight that ever glorified mediaeval Cheapside was the Midsummer Marching Watch, a grand City display, the description of which makes even the, brown pages of old Stow glow with light and colour, seeming to rouse in the old London chronicler recollections of his youth.
<p> <QUOTE>Besides the standing watches,</QUOTE> says Stow, <QUOTE><p>all in bright harness, in every ward and street in the City and suburbs, there was also
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.331.1">a Marching Watch</lemma>, that passed through the principal streets thereof; to wit, from the Little Conduit, by Paul's Gate, through West Cheap by the <hi rend=italics>Stocks</hi>, through Cornhill, by Leaden Hall, to Aldgate; then back down Fenchurch Street, by Grasse Church, about Grasse Church Conduit, and up Grasse Church Street into Cornhill, and through into West Cheap again, and so broke up. The whole way ordered for this Marching Watch extended to <num value="3200">3,200</num> taylors' yards of assize. For the furniture whereof, with lights, there were appointed <num value="700">700</num> cressets, <num value="500">500</num> of them being found by the Companies, the other <num value="200">200</num> by the

 Chamber of London. Besides the which lights, every constable in London, in number more than <num value="240">240</num>, had his cresset; the charge of every cresset was in light <measure value="2s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings <num value="4">four</num> pence</measure>; and every cresset had <num value="2">two</num> men, <num value="1">one</num> to bear or hold it, another to bear a bag with light, and to serve it; so that the poor men pertaining to the cressets taking wages, besides that every <num value="1">one</num> had a strawen hat, with a badge painted, and his breakfast, amounted in number to almost <num value="2000">2,000</num>. The Marching Watch contained in number about <num value="2000">2,000</num> men, part of them being old soldiers, of skill to be captains, lieutenants, serjeants, corporals, &amp;c.; whifflers, drummers and fifes, standard and ensign bearers, demi-launces on great horses, gunners with handguns, or half hakes, archers in coats of white fustian, signed on the breast and back with the arms of the City, their bows bent in their hands, with sheafs of arrows by their side; pikemen, in bright corslets, burganets, &amp;c.; halbards, the like; the billmen in Almain rivets and aprons of mail in great number.
<p>This Midsummer Watch was thus accustomed yearly, time out of mind, until the year <datestruct value="1539"><year reg="1539">1539</year></datestruct>, the <num value="31">31st</num> of Henry VIII.; in which year, on the <num value="8">8th</num> of <pb id="p.332" n="332"> May, a great muster was made by the citizens at the <hi rend=italics>Mile's End</hi>, all in bright harness, with coats of white silk or cloth, and chains of gold, in <num value="3">three</num> great battels, to the number of <num value="15000">15,000</num>; which passed through London to Westminster, and so through the Sanctuary and round about the Park of St. James, and returned home through Oldborn.
<p>King Henry, then considering the great charges of the citizens for the furniture of this unusual muster, forbad the Marching Watch provided for at midsummer for that year; which being once laid down, was not raised again till the year <datestruct value="1548"><year reg="1548">1548</year></datestruct>, the <num value="2">second</num> of Edward the <num value="6">Sixth</num>, Sir John Gresham then being Maior, who caused the arching Watch, both on the eve of Saint John Baptist, and of Saint Peter the Apostle, to be revived and set forth, in as comely order as it had been accustomed.
<p>In the months of June and July, on the vigil of festival days, and on the same festival days in the evenings, after the sun-setting, there were usually made bonefires in the streets, every man bestowing wood or labour towards them. The wealthier sort, also, before their doors, near to the said bonefires, would set out tables on the vigils, furnished with sweet bread and good drink; and on the festival days, with meat and drink, plentifully; whereunto they would invite their neighbours and passengers also, to sit and be merry with them in great familiarity, praising God for his benefits bestowed on them. These were called Bonefires, as well of good amity amongst neighbours, that being before at controversie, were there by the labours of others reconciled, and made of bitter enemies loving friends; as also for the virtue that a great fire hath to purge the infection of the air. On the vigil of Saint John Baptist, and on Saint Peter and Paul, the apostles, every man's door being shadowed with green birch, long fennel, St. John's wort, orpin, white lillies, and such-like, garnished upon with beautiful flowers, had also lamps of glass, with oyl burning in them all the night. Some hung out branches of iron, curiously wrought, containing hundreds of lamps, lighted at once, which made a goodly show, namely, in New Fish Street, Thames Street, &amp;c.</QUOTE>

</LIST></ARGUMENT>

<P>THE Cheapside Standard, opposite Honey Lane, was also a fountain, and was rebuilt in the reign of Henry VI. In the year <datestruct value="1293"><year reg="1293">1293</year></datestruct> (Edward I.) <num value="3">three</num> men had their right hands stricken off here for rescuing a prisoner arrested by an officer of the City. In Edward III.'s reign <num value="2">two</num> fishmongers, for aiding a riot, were beheaded at the Standard. Here also, in the reign of Richard II., Wat Tyler, that unfortunate reformer, beheaded Richard Lions, a rich merchant. When Henry IV. usurped the throne, very beneficially for the nation, it was at the Standard in Chepe that he caused Richard II.'s blank charters to be burned. In the reign of Henry VI. Jack Cade (a man who seems to have aimed at removing real evils) beheaded the Lord Say, as readers of Shakespeare's historical plays will remember; and in <datestruct value="1461--"><year reg="1461">1461</year></datestruct> John Davy had his offending hand cut off at the Standard for having struck a man before the judges at Westminster.
<p>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.332.1">Cheapside Cross</lemma><NOTE resp=B>see also <num value="304">304</num></NOTE> <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="9">nine</num> crosses erected by Edward I., that soldier king, to mark the restingplaces of the body of his beloved queen,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.332.2">Eleanor of Castile</lemma>, on its way from Lincoln to Westminster Abbey, stood in the middle of the-road facing Wood Street. It was built in <datestruct value="1290--"><year reg="1290">1290</year></datestruct> by Master Michael, a mason, of Canterbury. From an old painting at Cowdray, in Sussex, representing the procession of Edward VI. from the Tower to Westminster, an engraving of which we have given on page <num value="313">313</num>, we gather that the cross was both stately and graceful. It consisted of <num value="3">three</num> octangular compartments, each supported by <num value="8">eight</num> slender columns. The basement story was probably <num value="20">twenty</num> feet high; the <num value="2">second</num>, <num value="10">ten</num>; the <num value="3">third</num>, <num value="6">six</num>. In the <num value="1">first</num> niche stood the effigy of probably a contemporaneous pope; round the base of the <num value="2">second</num> were <num value="4">four</num> apostles, each with a nimbus round his head; and above them sat the Virgin, with the infant Jesus in her <pb id="p.333" n="333"> arms. The highest niche was occupied by <num value="4">four</num> standing figures, while crowning all rose a cross surmounted by the emblematic dove. The whole was rich with highly-finished ornament.
<p>Fox, the martyrologist, says the cross was erected on what was then an open spot of
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.333.2">Cheapside</LEMMA>. Some writers assert that a statue of Queen Eleanor <num value="1">first</num> stood on the spot, but this is very much doubted. The cross was rebuilt in <datestruct value="1441--"><year reg="1441">1441</year></datestruct>, and combined with a drinking-fountain. The work was a long time about, as the full design was not carried to completion till the <num value="1">first</num> year of Henry VII. This <num value="2">second</num> erection was, in fact, a sort of a timber-shed surrounding the old cross, and covered with gilded lead. It was, we are told, re-gilt on the visit of the Emperor Charles V. On the accession of Edward VI., that child of promise, the cross was altered and beautified.
<p>The generations came and went. The &lsquo;prentice who had played round the cross as a newly-girdled lad sat again on its steps as a rich citizen, in robes and chain. The shaven priest who stopped to mutter a prayer to the half-defaced Virgin in the votive niche gave place to his successor in the Geneva gown, and still the cross stood, a memory of death, that spares neither king nor subject. But in Elizabeth's time, in their horror of imageworship, the Puritans, foaming at the mouth at every outward and visible sign of the old religion, took great exception at the idolatrous cross of Chepe. Violent protest was soon made. In the night of <datestruct VALUE="1581-06-21"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=21>21st</day>, <year reg=1581>1581</year></datestruct>, an attack was made on the lower tier of <hi rend=italics>images</hi>--<hi rend=italics>i.e</hi>., the Resurrection, Virgin, Christ, and Edward the Confessor, all which were miserably mutilated. The Virgin was <QUOTE>robbed of her son, and the arms broken by which she stayed him on her knees, her whole body also haled by ropes and left ready to fall.</QUOTE> The Queen offered a reward, but the offenders were not discovered. In <datestruct value="1595--"><year reg="1595">1595</year></datestruct> the effigy of the Virgin was repaired, and afterwards <QUOTE>a newe sonne, misshapen (as borne out of time), all naked, was laid in her arms; the other images continuing broken as before.</QUOTE> Soon an attempt was made to pull down the woodwork, and substitute a pyramid for the crucifix; the Virgin was superseded by the goddess Diana- <QUOTE>a woman (for the most part naked), and water, conveyed from the Thames, filtering from her naked breasts, but oftentimes dried up.</QUOTE> Elizabeth, always a trimmer in these matters, was indignant at these fanatical doings; and thinking a plain cross, a symbol of the faith of our country, ought not to give scandal, she ordered <num value="1">one</num> to be placed on the summit, and gilt. The Virgin also was restored; but <num value="12">twelve</num> nights afterwards she was again attacked, <QUOTE>her crown being plucked off, and almost her head, taking away her naked child, and stabbing her in the breast.</QUOTE> Thus dishonoured the cross was left till the next year, <datestruct value="600"><year reg="600">600</year></datestruct>, when it was rebuilt, and the universities were consulted as to whether the crucifix should be restored. They all sanctioned it, with the exception of Dr. Abbot (afterwards archbishop), but there was to be no dove. In a sermon of the period the following passage occurs :-- <QUOTE>Oh! this cross is <num value="1">one</num> of the jewels of the harlot of Rome, and is left and kept here as a love-token, and gives them hope that they shall enjoy it and us again.</QUOTE> Yet the cross remained undisturbed for several years. At this period it was surrounded by a strong iron railing, and decorated in the most inoffensive manner. It consisted of only <num value="4">four</num> stones. Superstitious images were superseded by grave effigies of apostles, kings, and prelates. The crucifix only of the original was retained. The cross itself was in bad taste, being half Grecian, half Gothic; the whole, architecturally, much inferior to the former fabric.
<p>The uneasy zeal of the Puritanical sects soon revived. On the night of <datestruct VALUE="1641-01-24"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=24>24th</day>, <year reg=1641>1641</year></datestruct>, the cross was again defaced, and a sort of literary contention began. We have <title>The Resolution of those Contemners that will no Crosses ;</title> <title>Articles of High Treason exhibited against Cheapside Cross;</title>

<title>The Chimney-sweepers' Sad Complaint, and Humble Petition to the City of London for erecting a Neue Cross;</title> <title>A Dialogue between the Cross in Chepe and Charing Cross.</title> Of these here is a specimen-

<p>These disputes were the precursors of

In <datestruct VALUE="1643-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1643">1643</year></datestruct>, the Parliament deputed Robert Harlow to the work, who went with a troop of horse and <num value="2">two</num> companies of foot, and executed his orders most completely.

<p> <QUOTE>On the <datestruct VALUE="1643-05-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1643">1643</year></datestruct>, the cross in Cheapside <pb id="p.334" n="334"> was pulled down. At the fall of the top cross drums beat, trumpets blew, and multitudes of caps were thrown into the air, and a great shout of people with joy. The <datestruct value="05-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, the almanack says, was the invention of the cross, and the same day at night were the leaden popes burnt (they were not popes, but eminent English prelates) in the place where it stood, with ringing of bells and great acclamation, and no hurt at all done in these actions.</QUOTE>
<p>The <num value="10">10th</num> of the same month, the <title>Book of Sports</title> (a collection of ordinances allowing games on the Sabbath, put forth by James I.) was burnt by the hangman, where the Cross used to stand, and at the Exchange.

<p>Howell, the letter writer, lamenting the demolition of so ancient and visible a monument, says trumpets were blown all the while the crowbars and pickaxes were working. Archbishop Laud in his

<p>The old London conduits were pleasant gathering places for &lsquo;prentices, serving-men, and servant girls--open-air parliaments of chatter, scandal, love-making, and trade talk. Here all day repaired the professional water-carriers, rough, sturdy fellows --like Ben Jonson's Cob--who were hired to supply the houses of the rich goldsmiths of Chepe, and who, before Sir Hugh Middleton brought the New River to London, were indispensable to the citizen's very existence.
<p>The Great Conduit of Cheapside stood in the middle of the east end of the street near its junction with the Poultry, while the Little Conduit was at the west end, facing Foster Lane and Old Change.

<p>In the reign of Edward III. the supply of water for the City seems to have been derived chiefly from the river, the local conduits being probably insufficient.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.335.2">The Church of St. Mary-le-Bow</lemma><NOTE resp=B>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.335.1">Confirmation in Bow Church of Longley, Archbishop of Canterbury</lemma></NOTE>, the sound of whose mellow bells is supposed to be so dear to cockney ears, is the glory and crown of modern Cheapside. The music it casts forth into the troubled London air has a special magic of its own, and has a power to waken memories of the past. This <foreign lang=fr>chef-d'oeuvre</foreign> of Sir Christopher Wren, whose steeple--as graceful as it is statelyrises like a lighthouse above the roar and jostle of the human deluge below, stands on an ecclesiastical site of great antiquity. The old tradition is that here, as at St. Paul's and Westminster, was a Roman temple, but of that there is no proof whatever. The <num value="1">first</num> Bow Church seems, however, to have been <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest churches built by the conquerors of Harold; and here, no doubt, the sullen Saxons came to sneer at the masse chanted with a French accent. The <num value="1">first</num> church was racked by storm and fire, was for a time turned into a fortress, was afterwards the scene of a murder, and last of all became <num value="1">one</num> of our earliest ecclesiastical courts. Stow, usually very clear and unconfused, rather contradicts himself for once about the origin of the name of the church- <QUOTE>St. Mary de Arcubus or Bow.</QUOTE> In <num value="1">one</num> place he says it was so called because it was the <num value="1">first</num> London church built on arches; and elsewhere, when out of sight of this assertion, he says that it took its name from certain stone arches supporting a lantern on the top of the tower. The <num value="1">first</num> is more probably the true derivation, for St. Paul's could also boast its Saxon crypt. Bow Church is <num value="1">first</num> mentioned in the reign of William the Conqueror, and it was probably built at that period.
<p>There seems to have been nothing to specially disturb the fair building and its ministering priests till <datestruct value="1090"><year reg="1090">1090</year></datestruct> (William Rufus), when, in a tremendous storm that sent the monks to their knees, and shook the very saints from their niches over portal and arch, the roof of Bow Church was, by <num value="1">one</num> great wrench of the wind, lifted off, and wafted down like a mere dead leaf into the street. It does not say much for the state of the highway that <num value="4">four</num> of the huge rafters, <num value="26">twenty-six</num> feet long, were driven (so the chroniclers say) <num value="22">twenty-two</num> feet into the ground.
<p>In <datestruct value="1270--"><year reg="1270">1270</year></datestruct> part of the steeple fell, and caused the death of several persons; so that the work of mediaval builders does not seem to have been always irreproachable.
<p>It was in <datestruct value="1284--"><year reg="1284">1284</year></datestruct> (Edward I.) that blood was shed, and the right of sanctuary violated, in Bow Church. <num value="1">One</num> Duckett, a goldsmith, having in that warlike age wounded in some fray a person named Ralph Crepin, took refuge in this church, and slept in the steeple. While there, certain friends of Crepin entered during the night, and violating the sanctuary, <num value="1">first</num> slew Duckett, and then so placed the body as to induce the belief that he had committed suicide. A verdict to this effect was accordingly returned at the inquisition, and the body was interred with the customary indignities. The real circumstances, however, being afterwards discovered, through the evidence of a boy, who, it appears, was with Duckett in his voluntary confinement, and had hid himself during the struggle, the murderers, among whom was a woman, were apprehended and <pb id="p.336" n="336"> executed. After this occurrence the church was interdicted for a time, and the doors and windows stopped with brambles.
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> we hear of the nightly ringing of Bow bell at <num value="9">nine</num> o'clock--a reminiscence, probably, of the tyrannical Norman curfew, or signal for extinguishing the lights at <measure value="8d." type=currency><num value="8">eight</num> p.</measure>m.--is in <datestruct value="1315--"><year reg="1315">1315</year></datestruct> (Edward II.). It was the go-to-bed bell of those early days; and <num value="2">two</num> old couplets still exist, supposed to be the complaint of the sleepy &lsquo;prentices of Chepe and the obsequious reply of the Bow Church clerk. In the reign of Henry VI. the steeple was completed, and th. ringing of the bell was, perhaps,

<p>In <datestruct value="1315--"><year reg="1315">1315</year></datestruct> (Edward II.) William Copeland, church warden of Bow, gave a new bell to the church, or had the old <num value="1">one</num> re-cast.
<p>In <datestruct value="1512--"><year reg="1512">1512</year></datestruct> (Henry VIII.) the upper part of the steeple was repaired, and the lanthorn and the stone arches forming the open coronet of the tower <pb id="p.337" n="337"> were finished with Caen stone. It was then pro posed to glaze the <num value="5">five</num> corner lanthorns and the top lanthorn, and light them up with torches or cressets at night, to serve as beacons for travellers on the northern roads to London; but the idea was never carried out.
<p>By the Great Fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, the old church was destroyed; and in <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct> thepresent edifice was com menced by Sir C. Wren. After it was erected the parish was united to <num value="2">two</num> others, Allhallows, Honey Lane, and St. Pancras, Soper Lane. As the right of presentation to the latter of them is also vested in the Archbishop of Canterbury, and that of the former in the Grocers' Company, the Archbishop nominates twice consecutively, and the Grocers' Company once. We learn from the <title>Parentalia,</title> that the former church had been mean and low. On digging out the ground, a foundation was discovered sufficiently firm for the intended fabric, which, on further examination, the account states, appeared to be the walls and pavement of a temple, or church, of Roman workmanship, entirely buried under the level of the present street. In reality, however (unless other remains were found below those since seen, which is not probable), this was nothing more than the
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.337.1">crypt</lemma> of the ancient Norman church, and it may still be examined in the vaults of the present building; for, as the account informs us, upon these walls was commenced the new church. The former building stood about <num value="40">forty</num> feet backwards from Cheapside; and in order to bring the new steeple forward to the line of the street, the site of a house not yet rebuilt was purchased, and on it the excavations were commenced for the foundation of the tower. Here a Roman causeway was found, supposed to be the once northern boundary of the colony. The church was completed (chiefly at the expense of subscribers)

A certain Dame Dyonis Williamson, of Hale's Hall, in the county of Norfolk, gave <num value="2000">2,000</num> towards the rebuilding. Of the monuments in the church, that to the memory of Dr. Newton, Bishop of Bristol, and <num value="25">twenty-five</num> years rector of Bow Church, is the most noticeable. In <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct> the spire was repaired by George Gwilt, architect, and the upper part of it taken down and rebuilt. There used to be a large building, called the Crown-sild, or shed, on the north side of the old church (now the site of houses in Cheapside), which was erected by Edward III., as a place from which the Royal Family might view tournaments and other entertainments thereafter occurring in Cheapside. Originally the King had nothing but a temporary wooden shed for the purpose, but this falling down, as already described (page <num value="316">316</num>), led to the erection of the Crown-sild.
<P> <QUOTE>Without the north side of this church of St. Mary Bow,</QUOTE> says Stow, <QUOTE>towards West Chepe, standeth <num value="1">one</num> fair building of stone, called in record Seldam, a shed which greatly darkeneth the said church; for by means thereof all the windows and doors on that side are stopped up. King Edward caused this sild or shed to be made, and to be strongly built of stone, for himself, the queen, and other estates to stand in, there to behold the joustings and other shows at their pleasure. And this house for a long time after served for that use--viz., in the reigns of Edward III. and Richard II.; but in the year <datestruct value="1410"><year reg="1410">1410</year></datestruct> Henry IV. confirmed the said shed or building to Stephen Spilman, William Marchfield, and John Whateley, mercers, by the name of <num value="1">one</num> New Seldam, shed, or building, with shops, cellars, and edifices whatsoever appertaining, called Crownside or Tamersilde, situate in the Mercery in West Chepe, and in the parish of St. Mary de Arcubus, in London, &amp;c. <pb id="p.338" n="338"> Notwithstanding which grant the kings of England and other great estates, as well of foreign countries repairing to this realm, as inhabitants of the same have usually repaired to this place, therein to behold the shows of this city passing through West Chepe--viz., the great watches accustomed in the night, on the even of St. John the Baptist and St. Peter at Midsummer, the example whereof were over long to recite, wherefore let it suffice briefly to touch <num value="1">one</num>. In the year <datestruct value="1510"><year reg="1510">1510</year></datestruct>, on St. John's even at night, King Henry VIII. came to this place, then called the King's Head in Chepe, in the livery of a yeoman of the guard, with a halbert on his shoulder, and there beholding the watch, departed privily when the watch was done, and was not known to any but whom it pleased him; but on St. Peter's night next following he and the queen came royally riding to the said place, and there with their nobles beheld the watch of the city, and returned in the morning.</QUOTE>
<p>The <title>Builder</title>, of <datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct>, gives a full account of the discovery of architectural remains beneath some houses in Bow Churchyard:--
<p> <QUOTE>They are,</QUOTE> says the <title>Builder</title>, <QUOTE>of a much later date than the celebrated Norman crypt at present existing under the church. Beneath the house No. <num value="5">5</num> is a square vaulted chamber, <num value="12">twelve</num> feet by <num value="7">seven</num> feet <num value="3">three</num> inches high, with a slightly pointed arch of ribbed masonry, similar to some of those of the Old London Bridge. There had been in the centre of the floor an excavation, which might have been formerly used as a bath, but which was now arched over and converted into a cesspool. Proceeding towards Cheapside, there appears to be a continuation of the vaulting beneath the houses Nos. <num value="4">4</num> and <num value="3">3</num>. The arch of the vault here is plain and more pointed. The masonry appears, from an aperture near to the warehouse above, to be of considerable thickness. This crypt or vault is <num value="7">seven</num> feet in height, from the floor to the crown of the arch, and is <num value="9">nine</num> feet in width, and eighteen feet long. Beneath the house No. <num value="4">4</num> is an outer vault. The entrance to both these vaults is by a depressed Tudor arch, with plain spandrils, <num value="6">six</num> feet high, the thickness of the walls about <num value="4">four</num> feet. In the thickness of the eastern wall of <num value="1">one</num> of the vaults are cut triangular-headed niches, similar to those in which, in ancient ecclesiastical edifices, the basins containing the holy water, and sometimes lamps, were placed. These vaultings appear originally to have extended to Cheapside; for beneath a house there, in a direct line with these buildings and close to the street, is a massive stone wall. The arches of this crypt are of the low pointed form, which came into use in the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century. There are no records of any monastery having existed on this spot, and it is difficult to conjecture what the building originally was Mr. Chaffers thought it might be the remains of the <hi rend=italics>Crown-sild,</hi>
or shed, where our sovereigns resorted to view the joustings, shows, and great marching matches on the eves of great festivals.</QUOTE>
<P>The ancient silver parish seal of St. Mary-le- Bow, of which we give an engraving on page <num value="337">337</num>, representing the tower of the church as it existed before the Great Fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, is still in existence. It represents the old coronetted tower with great exactitude.
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> recorded rector of Bow Church was William. D. Cilecester (<datestruct value="1287--"><year reg="1287">1287</year></datestruct>, Edward I.), and the earliest known monument in the church was in memory of Sir John Coventry, Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1425--"><year reg="1425">1425</year></datestruct> (Henry VI.). The advowson of St. Mary-le- Bow belongs to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and is the chief of his <num value="13">thirteen</num> <hi rend=italics>peculiars</hi>, or insulated livings.
<p>Lovers of figures may like to know that the height of Bow steeple is <num value="221">221</num> feet <num value="8.50">8 1/2</num> inches.

<p>It was in Bow parish, Maitland thinks, that John Ware, the rich mercer, lived, at the sign of the <QUOTE>Crown,</QUOTE> in the reign of Henry VIII. He was a Suffolk man, made a large fortune, and left a considerable sum in charity--to poor prisoners, to the hospitals, the lazar-houses, and the alms-men of Whittington College-and <num value="35">thirty-five</num> heavy gold mourning rings to special friends.
<p>Edward IV., the same day he was proclaimed, dined at the palace at Paul's (that is, Baynard's Castle, near St. Paul's), in the City, and continued there till his army was ready to march in pursuit of King Henry; during which stay in the City he caused Walter Walker, an eminent grocer in Cheapside, to be apprehended and tried for a few harmless words innocently spoken by him-viz., that he would make his son heir to the Crown, inoffensively meaning his own house, which had the crown for its sign; for which imaginary crime he was beheaded in Smithfield, on the <num value="8">eighth</num> day of this king's reign. This <QUOTE>Crown</QUOTE> was probably Hare's house.
<p>The house No. <num value="108">108</num>, Cheapside, opposite Bow Church, was rebuilt after the Great Fire upon the sites of <num value="3">three</num> ancient houses, called respectively the <QUOTE>Black Bull,</QUOTE> leased to Daniel Waldo; the <QUOTE>Cardinalle Hat,</QUOTE> leased to Ann Stephens; and the <QUOTE>Black Boy,</QUOTE> leased to William Carpenter, by the Mercers' Company. In the library of the City of London there are MSS. from the Surveys of Wills, &amp;c., after the Fire of London, giving a <pb id="p.339" n="339"> description of the property, as well as the names of the respective owners. It was subsequently leased to David Barclay, linendraper; and has been visited by <num value="6">six</num> reigning sovereigns, from Charles II. to George III., on civic festivities, and for witnessing the Lord Mayor's show. In this house Sir Edward Waldo was knighted by Charles II., and the Lord Mayor, in <datestruct value="1714--"><year reg="1714">1714</year></datestruct>, was created a baronet by George I. When the house was taken down in <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>, the fine old oak-panelled dining-room, with its elaborate carvings, was purchased entire, and removed to Wales. The purchaser has written an interesting description (privately printed) of the panelling, the royal visits, the Barclay family, and other interesting matters.
<p>In <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct> there was sold, says Mr. Timbs, amongst the old materials of No. <num value="108">108</num>, the <QUOTE>fine old oakpanelling of a large dining-room, with chimneypiece and cornice to correspond, elaborately carved in fruit and foliage, in capital preservation, <num value="750">750</num> fee superficial.</QUOTE> These panels were purchased by Mr. Morris Charles Jones, of Gunrog, near Welshpool, in North Wales, for <measure value="72l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="72">72</num></measure> <measure value="10s. 3d." type=Currency><num value="10">10</num>s. <num value="3">3</num>d.</measure>, including commission and expenses of removal, being about <measure value="1s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="1">1</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> per foot superficial. It has been conveyed from Cheapside to Gunrog. This room was the principal apartment of the house of Sir Edward Waldo, and stated, in a pamphlet by Mr. Jones, <QUOTE>to have been visited by <num value="6">six</num> reigning sovereigns, from Charles II. to George III., on the occasion of civic festivities and for the purpose of witnessing the Lord Mayor's show.</QUOTE> (See Mr. ones's pamphlet, privately printed, <datestruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></datestruct>.) A contemporary (the <title>Builder</title>) doubts whether this carving can be the work of Gibbons; <QUOTE>if so, it is a rare treasure, cheaply gained. But, except in St. Paul's, a Crown and ecclesiastical structure, be it remembered, not a corporate <num value="1">one</num>, there is not a single example of Gibbons' art to be seen in the City of London proper.</QUOTE>
<p>Goldsmiths' Row, in Cheapside, between Old Change and Bucklersbury, was originally built by Thomas Wood, goldsmith and sheriff, in <datestruct value="1491--"><year reg="1491">1491</year></datestruct> (Henry VII.). Stow, speaking of it, says: <QUOTE>It is a most. beautiful frame of houses and shops, consisting of tenne faire dwellings, uniformly builded foure stories high, beautified towards the street with the Goldsmiths' arms, and likeness of Woodmen, in memorie of his name, riding on monstrous beasts, all richly painted and gilt.</QUOTE> Maitland assures us <QUOTE>it was beautiful to behold the glorious appearance of goldsmith's shops, in the south row of Cheapside, which reached from the Old Change to Bucklersbury, exclusive of <num value="4">four</num> shops.</QUOTE>
<p>The sign in stone of a nag's head upon the front of the old house, No. <num value="39">39</num>, indicates, it is supposed, the tavern at the corner of Friday Street, where, according to Roman Catholic scandal, the Protestant bishops, on Elizabeth's accession, consecrated each other in a very irregular manner.
<p>Pennant thus relates the scandalous story:-- <QUOTE>It was pretended by the adversaries of our religion, that a certain number of ecclesiastics, in their hurry to take possession of the vacant sees, assembled here, where they were to undergo the ceremony from Anthony Kitchen, <hi rend=italics>alias</hi> Dunstan, Bishop of Llandaff, a sort of occasional conformist, who had taken the oaths of supremacy to Queen Elizabeth. Bonner, Bishop of London, then confined in prison, hearing of it, sent his chaplain to Kitchen, threatening him with excommunication in case he proceeded. The prelate, therefore, refused to perform the ceremony; on which, say the Roman Catholics, Parker and the other candidates, rather than defer possession of their dioceses, determined to consecrate <num value="1">one</num> another, which, says the story, they did without any sort of scruple, and Story began with Parker, who instantly rose Archbishop of Canterbury. The simple refutation of this lying story may be read in Strype's  <Q> Life of Archbishop Parker.</Q> </QUOTE> The <QUOTE>Nag's Head Tavern</QUOTE> is shown in La Serre's print, <QUOTE lang=fr>Entr&eacute;e de la Reyne M&egrave;re du Roy</QUOTE>, <datestruct value="1638--"><year reg="1638">1638</year></datestruct>, of which we gave a copy on page <num value="307">307</num> of this work.
<p> <QUOTE>The confirmation,</QUOTE> says Strype, <QUOTE><p>was performed <num value="3">three</num> days after the Queen's letters commissional above-said; that is, on the <datestruct value="12-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> day of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, in the Church of St. Mary de Arcubus (i.e. Maryle-Bow, in Cheapside), regularly, and according to the usual custom; and then after this manner:-- <num value="1">First</num>, John Incent, public notary, appeared personally, and presented to the Right Reverend the ommissaries, appointed by the Queen, her said letters to them directed in that behalf; humbly praying them to take upon them the execution of the said letters, and to proceed according to the contents thereof, in the said business of confirmation. And the said notary public publicly read the Queen's commissionai letters. Then, out of the reverence and honour those bishops present  (who were Barlow, Story, Coverdale, and the suffragan of Bedford), bore to her Majesty, they took upon them the. commission, and accordingly resolved to proceed according to the form, power, and effect of the said letters. Next, the notary exhibited his proxy for the Dean and Chapter of the Metropolitan Church, and made himself a party for them; and, in the procuratorial name of the said Dean and Chapter, presented the venerable Mr. Nicolas Bullingham, LL.D., and placed him before <pb id="p.340" n="340"> the said commissioners; who then exhibited his proxy for the said elect of Canterbury, andmade himself a party for him. Then the said notary exhibited the original citatory mandate, together with the certificate on the back side, concerning the execution of the same; and then required all and singular persons cited, to be publicly called. And consequently a threefold proclamation was made, of all and singular opposers, at the door of the parochial church aforesaid; and so as is customary in these cases.
<p>Then, at the desire of the said notary to go on in this business of confirmation, they, the commissioners, decreed so to do, as was more fully contained in a schedule read by Bishop Barlow, with the consent of his colleagues. It is too long to relate distinctly every formal proceeding in this business; only it may be necessary to add some few of the most material passages.
<p>Then followed the deposition of witnesses concerning the life and actions, learning and abilities of the said elect; his freedom, his legitimacy, his priesthood, and such like. <num value="1">One</num> of the witnesses was John Baker, of <num value="39">thirty-nine</num> years old, gent., who is said to sojourn for the present with the venerable Dr. Parker, and to be born in the parish of St. Clement's, in Norwich.. He, among other things, witnessed,  <Q>That the same reverend father was and is a prudent man, commended for his knowledge of sacred Scripture, and for his life and manners. That he was a freeman, and born in lawful matrimony; that he was in lawful age, and in priest's orders, and a faithful subject to the Queen;</Q>  and the said Baker, in giving the reason of his knowledge in this behalf, said,  <Q>That he was the natural brother of the Lord Elect, and that they were born
<foreign lang=la>ex uni sparentibus</foreign> </Q>  (or rather, surely, <foreign lang=la>ex una parente</foreign>, i.e., of <num value="1">one</num> mother). William Tolwyn, M.A., aged <num value="70">seventy</num> years, and rector of St. Anthony, London, was another witness, who had known the said elect <num value="30">thirty</num> years, and knew his mother, and that he was still very well acquainted with him, and of his certain knowledge could testify all above said.
<p>The notary exhibited the process of the election by the Dean and Chapter; which the commissioners did take a diligent view of, and at last, in the conclusion of this affair, the commissioners decreed the said most reverend lord elected and presently confirmed, should receive his consecration; and committed to him the care, rule, and administration, both of the temporals and spirituals of the said archbishopric; and decreed him to be inducted into the real, actual, and corporal possession of the same archbishopric.
<p>After many years the old story is ventured again into the world, in a book printed at Douay, anno <datestruct value="1654"><year reg="1654">1654</year></datestruct>, wherein they thus tell their tale.  <Q>I know they (i.e., the Protestants) have tried many ways, and feigned an old record (meaning the authentic register of Archbishop Parker) to prove their ordination from Catholic bishops. But it was false, as I have received from <num value="2">two</num> certain witnesses. The former of them was Dr. Darbyshire, then Dean of St. Paul's (canon there, perhaps, but never dean), and nephew to Dr. Boner, Bishop of London; who almost <num value="60">sixty</num> years since lived at Meux Port, then a holy, religious nian (a Jesuit), very aged, but perfect in sense and memory, who, speaking what he knew, affirmed to myself ahd another with me, <hi rend=italics>that like good fellows they made themselves bishops at an inn, because they could get no true bishops to consecrate them</hi>. My other witness was a gentleman of honour, worth, and credit, dead not many years since, whose father, a chief judge of this kingdom, visiting Archbishop Heath, saw a letter, sent from Bishop Boner out of the Marshalsea, by <num value="1">one</num> of his chaplains, to the archbishop, read, while they sat at dinner together; wherein he merrily related the manner how these new bishops (because he had dissuaded Ogelthorp, Bishop of Carlisle, from doing it in his diocese) ordained <num value="1">one</num> another at an inn, where they met together. And while others laughed at this new manner of consecrating bishops, the archbishop himself, gravely, and not without tears, expressed his grief to see such a ragged company of men come poor out of foreign parts, and appointed to succeed the old clergy.</Q>
<p>Which forgery, when once invented, was so acceptable to the Romanists, that it was most confidently repeated again in an English book, printed at Antwerp, <datestruct value="1658--"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>, <foreign lang=la>permissione superiorum</foreign>, being a <num value="2">second</num> edition, licensed by Gulielmo Bolognimo, where the author sets down his story in these words:--<Q>The heretics who were named to succeed in the other bishops' sees, could not prevail with Llandaff (whom he calls a little before
<hi rend=italics>an old simple man</hi>) to consecrate them at the <QUOTE>Nag's Head,</QUOTE> in Cheapside, where they appointed to meet him. And therefore they made use of Story, who was never ordained bishop, though he bore the name in King Edward's reign. Kneeling before him, he laid the Bible upon their heads or shoulders, and bid them rise up and preach the word of God sincerely. <Q>This is,</Q> added he, <Q>so evident a truth, that for the space of <num value="50">fifty</num> years no Protestant durst contradict it.</Q></Q></QUOTE>

<p> <QUOTE>The form adopted at the confirmation of Archbishop Parker,</QUOTE> says Dr. Pusey in a letter dated <pb id="p.341" n="341"> <datestruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct>, quoted by Mr. Timbs, <QUOTE>was carefully framed on the old form used in the confirmations by Archbishop Chichele (which was the point for which I examined the registers in the Lambeth library).. The words used in the consecration of the bishops confirmed by Chichele do not occur in the registers. The words used by the consecrators of Parker,  <Q>Accipe Spiritum sanctum,</Q>  were read in the later pontificals, as in that of Exeter, Lacy's (Maskell's  <Q>Monumenta Ritualia,</Q>  iii. <num value="258">258</num>). Roman Catholic writers admit <hi rend=italics>that</hi> only is essential to consecration which the English service-book retained-prayer during the service, which should have reference to the office of bishop, and the imposition of hands. And, in fact, Cardinal Pole engaged to retain in their orders those who had been so ordained under Edward VI., and his act was confirmed by Paul IV.</QUOTE> (Sanders, <title>De Schism.

<p>That dull poet, worthy Sir Richard Blackmore, whom Locke and Addison praised and. Dryden ridiculed, lived either at Saddlers' Hall or. just opposite. It was on this weariful Tupper of his day that Garth wrote these verses :
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Unwieldy pedant, let thy awkward muse,

And some other satirical verses on Sir Richard began:--

<p>At No. <num value="90">90</num>, Cheapside lived
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.343.1">Alderman Boydell</lemma>, engraver and printseller, a man who in his time did more for English art than all the English monarchs from the Conquest downwards. He was apprenticed, when more than <num value="20">twenty</num> years old, to Mr. Tomson, engraver, and soon felt a desire to popularise and extend the art. His <num value="1">first</num> funds <pb id="p.344" n="344"> he derived from the sale of a book of <num value="152">152</num> humble prints, engraved by himself. With the profits he was enabled to pay the best engravers liberally, to make copies of the works of our best masters.
<p> <QUOTE>The alderman assured me,</QUOTE> says <QUOTE>Rainy Day Smith,</QUOTE> <QUOTE><p>that when he commenced publishing, he etched small plates of landscapes, which he produced in plates of <num value="6">six</num>, and sold for sixpence; and that as there were very few print-shops at that time in London, he prevailed upon the sellers of children's toys to allow his little books to be put in their windows. These shops he regularly visited every Saturday, to see if any had been sold, and to leave more. His most successful shop was the sign of the  <Q>Cricket Bat,</Q>  in Duke's Court, St. Martin's Lane, where he found he had sold as many as came to <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence. With this success he was so pleased, that, wishing to invite the shopkeeper to continue in his interest, he laid out the money in a silver pencil-case; which article, after he had related the above anecdote, he took out of his pocket and assured me he never would part with. He then favoured me with the following history of Woollett's plate of the  <Q>Niobe,</Q>  and, as it is interesting, I shall endeavour to relate it in Mr. Boydells own words:--
<p><QUOTE>When I got a little forward in the world,</QUOTE>
said the venerable alderman, <QUOTE><p>I took a whole shop, for at my commencement I kept only half a <num value="1">one</num>. In the course of <num value="1">one</num> year I imported numerous impressions of Vernet's celebrated <QUOTE>Storm</QUOTE>, so admirably engraved by Lerpiniere, for which I was obliged to pay in hard cash, as the French took none of our prints in return. Upon Mr. Woollett's expressing himself highly delighted with the
<QUOTE>Storm,</QUOTE> I was induced, knowing his ability as an engraver, to ask him if he thought he could produce a print of the same size which I could send over, so that in future I could avoid payment in money, and prove to the French nation that an Englishman could produce a print of equal merit; upon which he immediately declared that he should like much to try.
<p>At this time the principal conversation among artists was upon Mr. Wilson's grand picture of
<QUOTE>Niobe</QUOTE>, which had just arrived from Rome. I therefore immediately applied to his Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester, its owner, and procured permission for Woollett to engrave it. But before he ventured upon the task, I requested to know what idea he had as to the expense, and after some consideration, he said he thought he could engrave it for <num value="100">one hundred</num> guineas. This sum, small as it may now appear, was to me, <QUOTE> observed the alderman, </QUOTE> an unheard--of price, being considerably more than I had given for any copperplate. However, serious as the sum was, I bade him get to work, and he proceeded with all cheerfulness, for as he went on I advanced him money; and though he lost no time, I found that he had received nearly the whole amount before he had half finished his task. I frequently called upon him, and found him struggling with serious difficulties, with his wife and family, in an upper lodging in Green's Court, Castle Street, Leicester Square, for there he lived before he went into Green Street. However, I encouraged him by allowing him to draw on me to the extent of <measure value="25l." type=currency><num value="25">twenty-five</num> pounds</measure> more; and at length that sum was paid, and I was unavoidably under the necessity of saying, <QUOTE>Mr. Woollett, I find we have made too close a bargain with each other. You have exerted yourself, and I fear I have gone beyond my strength, or, indeed, what I ought to have risked, as we neither of us can be aware of the success of the speculation. However, I am determined, whatever the event may be, to enable you to finish it to your wish--at least, to allow you to work upon it as long as another <measure value="25l." type=currency><num value="25">twenty-five</num> pounds</measure> can extend, but there we must positively stop.</QUOTE> The plate was finished; and, after taking very few proofs, I published the print at <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure>, and it succeeded so much beyond my expectations, that I immediately employed Mr. Woollett upon another engraving, from another picture by Wilson; and I am now thoroughly convinced that had I continued publishing subjects of this description, my fortune would have been increased tenfold.</QUOTE></QUOTE>

<p> <QUOTE>In the year <datestruct value="1786"><year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE> says Knowles, in his <title>Life of Fuseli,</title> <QUOTE><p>Mr. Alderman Boydell, at the suggestion of Mr. George Nicol, began to form his splendid collection of modern historical pictures, the subjects being from Shakespeare's plays, and which was called  <Q>The Shakespeare Gallery.</Q>  This liberal and well-timed speculation gave great energy to this branch of the art, as well as employment to many of our best artists and engravers, and among the former to Fuseli, who executed <num value="8">eight</num> large and <num value="1">one</num> small picture for the galley. The following were the subjects:  <Q>Prospero,</Q>   <Q>Miranda,</Q>   <Q>Caliban,</Q>  and  <Q>Ariel,</Q>  from the <title>Tempest</title>;  <Q>Titania in raptures with Bottom, who wears the ass's head, attendant fairies, &amp;c.</Q>   <Q>Titania awaking, discovers Oberon at her side, Puck is removing the ass's head from Bottom</Q>  (<title>Midsummer Night's Dream</title>); <Q>Henry V. with the Conspirators</Q> (<title>King Henry V</title>.);  <Q>Lear dismissing Cordelia from his Court</Q>  (<title>King Lear</title>);  <Q>Ghost of Hamlet's Father</Q>  (<title>Hamlet</title>);  <Q>Falstaff and Doll</Q>  (<title>King Henry IV., <num value="2">Second</num> Part</title>);  <Q> Mac-

This gallery gave the public an opportunity of judging of Fuseli's versatile powers.
<p>The stately majesty of the  <Q>Ghost of Hamlet's Father</Q>  contrasted with the expressive energy of his son, and the sublimity brought about by the light, shadow, and general tone, strike the mind with awe. In the picture of  <Q>Lear </Q>  is admirably portrayed the stubborn rashness of the father, the filial piety of the discarded daughter, and the wicked determination of Regan and Goneril. The fairy scenes in <title>Midsummer Night's Dream</title> amuse the fancy, and show the vast inventive powers of the painter; and  <Q>Falstaff with Doll</Q>  is exquisitely ludicrous.
<p>The example set by Boydell was a stimulus to other speculators of a similar nature, and within a few years appeared the Macklin and Woodmason galleries; and it may be said with great truth that Fuseli's pictures were among the most striking, if not the best, in either collection.</QUOTE>

<p> <QUOTE>A.D. <datestruct value="1787"><year reg="1787">1787</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE> says Northcote, in his <title>Life of Reynolds,</title> <QUOTE><p>when Alderman Boydell projected the scheme of his magnificent edition of the plays of Shakespeare, accompanied with large prints from pictures to be executed by English painters, it was deemed to be absolutely necessary that something of Sir Joshua's painting should be procured to grace the collection; but, unexpectedly, Sir Joshua appeared to be rather shy in the business, as if he thought it degrading himself to paint for a printseller, and he would not at <num value="1">first</num> consent to be employed in the work. George Stevens, the editor of Shakespeare, now undertook to persuade him to comply, and, taking a bank-bill of <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">five hundred</num> pounds</measure> in his hand, he had an interview with Sir Joshua, when, using all his eloquence in argument, he, in the meantime, slipped the bank-bill into his hand; he then soon found that his mode of reasoning was not to be resisted, and a picture was promised. Sir Joshua immediately commenced his studies, and no less than <num value="3">three</num> paintings were exhibited at the Shakspeare Gallery, or at least taken from that poet, the only ones, as has been very correctly said, which Sir Joshua ever executed for his illustration, with the exception of a head of  <Q>King Lear</Q>  (done indeed in <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>), and now in possession of the Marchioness of Thomond,.and a portrait of the Hon. Mrs. Tollemache, in the character of  <Q>Miranda,</Q>  in
 <title>The Tempest</title>, in which  <Q>Prospero</Q>  and  <Q>Caliban</Q>  are introduced.
<p><num value="1">One</num> of these paintings for the Gallery was  <Q>Puck,</Q>  or  <Q>Robin Goodfellow,</Q>  as it has been called, which, in point of expression and animation, is unparalleled, and <num value="1">one</num> of the happiest efforts of Sir Joshua's pencil, though it has been said by some. cold critics not to be perfectly characteristic of the merry wanderer of Shakespeare.  <Q>Macbeth,</Q>  with the witches and the caldron, was another, and for this last Mr. Boydell paid him <num value="1000">1,000</num> guineas; but who is now the possessor of it I know not.
<p> <Q>Puck</Q>  was painted in <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>. Walpole depreciates it as  <Q>an ugly little imp (but with some character) sitting on a mushroom half as big as a mile-stone.</Q>  Mr. Nicholls, ofthe British Institution, related to Mr. Cotton that the alderman and his grandfather were with Sir Joshua when painting the death of Cardinal Beaufort. Boydell was much taken with the.portrait of a naked child, and wished it could be brought into the Shakspeare. Sir Joshua said it was painted from a little child he found sitting on his steps in Leicester Square. Nicholls' grandfather then said,  <Q>Well, Mr. Alderman, it can very easily come into the Shakspeare if Sir Joshua will kindly place him upon a mushroom, give him fawn's ears, and make a Puck of him.</Q>  Sir Joshua liked the notion, and painted the picture accordingly.
<p>The morning of the day on which Sir Joshua's  <Q>Puck</Q>  was to be sold, Lord Farnborough and Davies, the painter, breakfasted with Mr. Rogers, and went to the sale together. When the picture was put up there was a general clapping of hands, and yet it was knocked down to Mr. Rogers for <num value="105">105</num> guineas. As he walked home from the sale, a man carried  <Q>Puck</Q>  before him, and so well was the picture known that more than <num value="1">one</num> person, as they were going along the street, called out,  <Q>There it is!</Q>  At Mr. Rogers' sale, in <datestruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></datestruct>, it was purchased by Earl Fitzwilliam for <num value="980">980</num> guineas. he grown--up person of the sitter for  <Q>Puck</Q>  was in Messrs. Christie and Manson's room during the sale, and stood next to Lord Fitzwilliam, who is also a survivor of the sitters to Sir Joshua. he merry boy, whom Sir Joshua found upon his door-step, subsequently became a porter at Elliot's brewery, in Pimlico.</QUOTE>

<p>In <datestruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct>, Alderman Boydell applied through his friend, Sir John W. Anderson, to the House of Commons, for leave to dispose of his paintings and drawings by lottery. In his petition he described himself, with modesty and pathos, as an old man of <num value="85">eighty-five</num>, anxious to free himself from debts which now oppressed him, although he, with his brethren, had expended upwards of <measure value="350000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="350000">350,000</num></measure> in promoting the fine arts. <num value="60">Sixty</num> years before he had begun to benefit engraving by establishing a school of English engravers. At that time the whole print commerce of England consisted in importing a few foreign prints (chiefly French) <QUOTE>to supply the cabinets of <pb id="p.346" n="346"> the curious.</QUOTE> In time he effected a total change in this branch of commerce, <QUOTE>very few prints being now imported, while the foreign market is principally supplied with prints from England.</QUOTE> By degrees, the large sums received from the Continent for English plates encouraged him to attempt also an English school of pictorial painting, the want of such a school having been long a source of opprobrium among foreign writers on England. The Shakespeare Gallery was sufficient to convince the world that English genius only needed encouragement to obtain a facility, versatility, and independence of thought unknown to the Italian, Flemish, or French schools. That Gallery he had long hoped to have left to a generous public, but the recent Vandalic revolution in France had cut up his revenue by the roots, Flanders, Holland, and Germany being his chief marts. At the same time he acknowledged he had not been provident, his natural enthusiasm for promoting the fine arts having led him after each success to fly at once to some new artist with the whole gains of his former undertaking. He had too late seen his error, having increased his stock of copper-plates to such a heap that all the print-sellers in Europe (especially in these unfavourable times) could not purchase them. He therefore prayed for permission to create a lottery, the House having the assurance of the even tenor of a long life <QUOTE>that it would be fairly and honourably conducted.</QUOTE>
<p>The worthy man obtained leave for his lottery, and died <datestruct value="12-11"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=11>11</day></datestruct>, a few days after the last tickets were sold. He was buried with civic state in the Church of St. Olave, Jewry, the Lord Mayor, aldermen, and several artists attending. Boydell was very generous and charitable. He gave pictures to adorn the City Council Chamber, the Court Room of the Stationers' Company, and the dining-room of the Sessions House. He was also a generous benefactor to the Humane Society and the Literary Fund, and was for many years the President of both Societies. The Shakespeare Gallery finally fell by lottery to Mr. Tassie, the well-known medallist, who thrived to a good old age upon the profits of poor Boydell's too generous expenditure. This enterprising man was elected Alderman of Cheap Ward in <datestruct value="1782--"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct>, Sheriff in <datestruct value="1785--"><year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct>, and Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>. His death was occasioned by a cold, caught at the Old Bailey Sessions. His nephew, Josiah Boydell, engraved for him for <num value="40">forty</num> years.
<p>It was the regular custom of Mr. Alderman Boydell (says <QUOTE>Rainy Day</QUOTE> Smith), who was a very early riser, to repair at <num value="5">five</num> o'clock immediately to the pump in Ironmonger Lane. There, after placing his wig upon the ball at the top, he used to sluice his head with its water. This well known and highly respected character was <num value="1">one</num> of the last men who wore a <num value="3">three</num>-cornered hat, commonly called the <QUOTE>Egham, Staines, and Windsor.</QUOTE>

<P>Old Change was formerly the old Exchange, so called from the King's Exchange, says Stow, there kept, which was for the receipt of bullion to be coined.
<p>The King's Exchange was in Old Exchange, now Old &lsquo;Change, Cheapside. <QUOTE>It was here,</QUOTE> says Tite, <QUOTE>that <num value="1">one</num> of those ancient officers, known as the King's Exchanger, was placed, whose duty it was to attend to the supply of the mints with bullion, to distribute the new coinage, and to regulate the exchange of foreign coin. Of these officers there were anciently <num value="3">three</num>-<num value="2">two</num> in London, at the Tower and Old Exchange, and <num value="1">one</num> in the city of Canterbury. Subsequently another was appointed, with an establishment in Lombard Street, the ancient rendezvous of the merchants; and it appears not improbable that Queen Elizabeth's intention was to have removed this functionary to what was pre-eminently designated by her  <Q>The Royal Exchange,</Q>  and hence the reason for the change of the name of this edifice by Elizabeth.</QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>In the reign of Henry VII.,</QUOTE> says Francis, in his <title>History of the Bank of England,</title> <QUOTE>the Royal prerogative forbade English coins to be exported, and the Royal Exchange was alone entitled to give native money for foreign coin or bullion. During <pb id="p.347" n="347"> the reign of Henry VIII. the coin grew so debased as to be difficult to exchange, and the Goldsmiths quietly superseded the royal officer. In <datestruct value="1627--"><year reg="1627">1627</year></datestruct> Charles I., ever on the watch for power, reesta- blished the office, and in a pamphlet written by his orders, asserted that  <Q>the prerogative had always been a flower of the Crown, and that the Goldsmiths had left off their proper trade and turned exchangers of plate and foregn coins for our English coins, although they had no right.</Q>  Charles entrusted the office of <Q>changer, exchanger, and ante-changer</Q> to Henry Rich, <num value="1">first</num> Earl of Holland, who soon deserted his cause for tht of the Parliament. The office has not since been re-established.</QUOTE>

<p> <QUOTE>Friday Street was so called,</QUOTE> says Stow; <QUOTE>of fishmongers dwelling there, and serving Friday's Market.</QUOTE> In the roll of the Scrope and Grosvenor heraldic controversy (Edward III.) the poet Chaucer is recorded as giving the following evidence connected with this street:--
<p> <QUOTE>Geffray Chaucere, Esqueer, of the age of <num value="40">forty</num> years, and moreover armed <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> years for the side of Sir Richard Lescrop, sworn and examined, being asked if the arms; azyure, a bend or, belonged or ought to pertain to the said Sir Richard by right and heritage, said, Yes; for he saw him so armed in Frannce, before the town of Petters, and Sir Henry Lescrop armed inthe same arms with a white label and with banner; and the said Sir Richard armed in the entire arms azyure a bend or, and so during the whole expedition until the said Geaffray was taken. Being asked how he knew that the.said arms belonged to the said Sir Richard, said that he had heard old knights and esquires say that. they had had continual possession of the said arms; and that he had seen them displayed on banners, glass paintings, and vestments, and commonly called the armsof Scrope. Being asked whether he had ever heard of any interruption or challenge made by Sir Robert Grosvernor or his ancestors, said No; but that he was once in Friday Street, London. and walking up the street he observed a new sign hanging out with these arms thereon, and enquired what inn that was that had hung out these arms of Scrope? And <num value="1">one</num> answered him, saying,  <Q>They are not hung out, Sir, for the arms of Scrope, nor painted there for those arms, but they are painted and put there by a Knight of the county of Chester, called Sir Robert Grosvernor.</Q>  And that was the <num value="1">first</num> time he ever heard speak of Sir Robert Grosvernor or his ancestors, or of any <num value="1">one</num> bearing the name of Grosvernor.</QUOTE> This is really almost the only authentic scrap we possess of the facts of Chaucer's life.

<p>At the Wednesday Club in Friday Street, William Paterson, the founder of the Bank of England, and originator of the unfortunate Darien scheme, held his real or imaginary Wednesday club meetings, in which were discussed proposals for the union of England and Scotland and the redemption of the National Debt. This remarkable financier was born at Lochnabar, in Dumfriesshire, in <datestruct value="1648--"><year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct>, and died in <datestruct value="1719--"><year reg="1719">1719</year></datestruct>. The following extracts from Paterson's probably imaginary conversations are of interest:--
<P> <QUOTE>And thus,</QUOTE> says Paterson, <QUOTE>supposing the people of Scotland to be in number <num value="1">one</num> million, and that as matters now stand their industry yields them only about <num value="5">five</num>-pounds per annum per head as reckoned <num value="1">one</num> with another, or <num value="5">five</num> millions yearly in the whole at this rate these <num value="5">five</num> millions will by the union not only be advanced to <num value="6">six</num>, but put in a way of further improvement; and allowing <num value="100000">100,000</num> per annum were on this foot to be paid an additional taxes, yet there would still remain a yearly sum of about <num value="900000">900,000</num> towards subsisting the people more comfortably, and making provision against times of scarcity, and other accidents, to which, I understand, that country is very much exposed (<datestruct value="1706--"><year reg="1706">1706</year></datestruct>).</QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>And I remember complaints of this kind were very loud in the days of King Charles II.,</QUOTE> said Mr. Brooks, <QUOTE>particularly that, though in his time the public taxes and impositions upon the people were doubled or trebled to what they formerly were, he nevertheless run at least a million in debt.</QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>If men were uneasy with public taxes and debts in the time of King Charles II.,</QUOTE> said Mr. May, <QUOTE>because then doubled or trebled to what they had formerly been how much more may they be so now, when taxed at least <num value="3">three</num> times more, and the public debts increased from about <num value="1">one</num> million, as you say they then were, to <num value="50">fifty</num> millions or <pb id="p.348" n="348"> upwards? . <gap> and yet France is in a way of being entirely out of debt in a year or <num value="2">two</num>.</QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>At this rate,</QUOTE> said Mr. May, <QUOTE>Great Britain may possibly be quite out of debt in <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> years, or less. But though it seems we have been at least as hasty in running into debt as those in France, yet would I by no means advise us to run so hastily out; slower measures will be juster, and consequently better and surer.</QUOTE>
<p>Mr. Pitt's celebrated measure was based upon an opinion that money could be borrowed with advantage to pay the national debt. Paterson proposed to redeem it out of a surplus revenue, administered so skilfully as to lower the interest in the money market. The notion of <hi rend=italics>borrowing</hi> to

The <num value="1">first</num> turning on the left hand, as you enter from Cheapside, was called <QUOTE>Black Spread Eagle Court,</QUOTE> and not unlikely from the family ensign of the poet's father. Milton was born in this street (<datestruct VALUE="1608-12-9"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=9>9</day>, <year reg=1608>1608</year></datestruct>), and baptised in the adjoining church of Allhallows, Bread Street, where the register of his baptism is still preserved. Of the house in which he resided in later life, and the churchyard of St. Giles, Cripplegate, where he was buried, we give a view on page <num value="349">349</num>. Aubrey tells us that the house and chamber in which the poet was born were often visited by foreigners, even in the poet's lifetime.. Their visits must have taken place before the fire, for the house was destroyed in the Great Fire, and
<title>Paradise Lost </title> was published after it. Spread Eagle Court is at the present time a warehouseyard, says Mr. David Masson. The position of a scrivener was something between a notary and a law stationer.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.350.2">The <QUOTE>Mermaid</QUOTE> Tavern, in Cheapside</lemma>, about the site of which there has been endless controversy, stood in Bread Street, with side entrances, as <pb id="p.351" n="351"> Mr. Burn has shown, with admirable clearness, in Friday Street and Bread Street; hence the disputes of antiquaries.
<p>Mr. Burn, in his book on <QUOTE>Tokens,</QUOTE> says, <QUOTE>The site of the  <Q>Mermaid</Q>  is clearly defined, from the circumstance of W.

<p>Here Sir Walter Raleigh is, by <num value="1">one</num> of the traditions, said to have instituted <QUOTE>The Mermaid Club.</QUOTE> Gifford, in his edition of <QUOTE>Ben Jonson,</QUOTE> has thus described the club :-- <QUOTE>About this time-(<datestruct value="1603--"><year reg="1603">1603</year></datestruct>) Jonson probably began to acquire that turn for conviviality for which he was afterwards noted. Sir Walter Raleigh, previously to his unfortunate engagement with the wretched Cobham and others, had instituted a meeting of <hi rend=italics>beaux esprits</hi> at the  <Q>Mermaid,</Q>  a celebrated tavern in Friday Street. Of this club, which combined more talent and genius than ever met together before or since, our author was a member, and here for many years he regularly repaired, with Shakespeare, Beaumont, Fletcher, Selden, Cotton, Carew, Martin, Donne, and many others, whose names, even at this distant period, call up a mingled feeling of reverence and respect.</QUOTE> But this is doubted. A writer in the
<title>Athenaeum</title>, <datestruct VALUE="1865-09-16"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=16>16</day>, <year reg=1865>1865</year></datestruct>, states:-- <QUOTE>The origin of the common tale of Raleigh founding the  <Q>Mermaid Club,</Q>  of which Shakespeare is said to have been a member, has not been traced. Is it older than Gifford?</QUOTE> Again:-- <QUOTE>Gifford's apparent invention of the  <Q> Mermaid Club.</Q>  Prove to us that Raleigh founded the  <Q>Mermaid Club,</Q>  that the wits attended it under his presidency, and you will have made a real contribution to our knowledge of Shakespeare's time, even if you fail to show that our poet was a member of that club.</QUOTE> The tradition, it is thought, must be added to the long list of Shakespearian doubts.
<p>But we nevertheless have a noble record left of the wit combats here in the celebrated epistle of Beaumont to Jonson:-- Methinks the little wit I had is lost

<p> <QUOTE>Many,</QUOTE> says Fuller, <QUOTE>were the wit combats betwixt him (Shakespeare) and Ben Jonson, which <num value="2">two</num> I behold like a Spanish great galleon and an English man-of-war.

<p>These combats, <num value="1">one</num> is willing to think, although without any evidence at all, took place at the <QUOTE>Mermaid</QUOTE> on such evenings as Beaumont so glowingly describes.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.353.2">The <num value="2">second</num> hall</lemma> is supposed to have been built by Sir Dru Barentyn, in <datestruct value="1407--"><year reg="1407">1407</year></datestruct> (Henry IV.). The Livery Hall had a bay window on the side next to Huggin Lane; the roof was surmounted with a lantern and vane; the reredos in the screen was surmounted by a silver-gilt statue of St. Dunstan; and the Flemish tapestry represented the story of the patron saint of goldsmiths. Stow, writing in <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>, expresses doubt at the story that Bartholomew Read, goldsmith and mayor in <datestruct value="1502--"><year reg="1502">1502</year></datestruct>, gave a feast there to more than <num value="100">100</num> persons, as the hall was too small for that purpose.
<P>From <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct> till the Restoration, Goldsmiths' Hall served as the Exchequer of the Commonwealth. All the money obtained from the sequestration of Royalists' estates was here stored, and then disbursed for State purposes. The following is a description of
<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.353.3">the earlier hall</LEMMA>:---
<P> <QUOTE>The buildings,</QUOTE> says Herbert, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>were of a fine red brick, and surrounded a small square court, paved; the front being ornamented with stone corners, wrought in rustic, and a large arched entrance, which exhibited a high pediment, supported on Doric columns, and open at the top, to give room for a shield of the Company's arms. The livery, or common hall, which was on the east side of the court, was a spacious and lofty apartment, paved with black and white marble, and very elegantly fitted up. The wainscoting was very handsome, and the ceiling and its appendages richly stuccoed--an enormous flower adorning the centre, and the City and Goldsmiths' arms, with various decorations, appearing in its other compartments. A richly-carved screen, with composite pillars, pilasters, &amp;c.; a balustrade, with vases, terminating in branches for lights (between which displayed the banners and flags used on public occasions); and a beaufet of considerable size, with white and gold ornaments, formed part of the embellishments of this splendid room.
<P>The balustrade of the staircase was elegantly carved, and the walls exhibited numerous reliefs of scrolls, flowers, and instruments of music. The court-room was another richly-wainscoted apartment, and the ceiling very grand, though, perhaps somewhat overloaded with embellishments. The chimney-piece was of statuary marble, and very sumptuous.</QUOTE>

<P>The guild of Goldsmiths is of extreme antiquity, having been fined in <datestruct value="1180--"><year reg="1180">1180</year></datestruct> (Henry II.) as adulterine, that is, established or carried on without the king's <pb id="p.354" n="354"> special licence; for in any matter where fines could be extorted, the Norman kings took a paternal interest in the doings of their patient subjects. In <datestruct value="1267--"><year reg="1267">1267</year></datestruct> (Henry III.) the goldsmiths seem to have been infected with the pugnacious spirit of the age; for we come upon bands of goldsmiths and tailors fighting in London streets, from some guild jealousy; and <num value="500">500</num> snippers of cloth meeting, by appointment, <num value="500">500</num> hammerers of metal, and having a comfortable and steady fight. In the latter case many were killed on both sides, and the sheriff at last had to interpose with the City's <foreign lang=la>posse comitatus</foreign> and with bows, swords, and spears. The ringleaders were finally apprehended, and <num value="13">thirteen</num> of them condemned and executed. In <datestruct value="1278--"><year reg="1278">1278</year></datestruct> (Edward I.) many spurious goldsmiths were arrested for frauds in trade, <num value="3">three</num> Englishmen were hung, and more than a dozen unfortunate Jews.

<p>The goldsmiths were incorporated into a permanent company in the prodigal reign of Richard II., and they no doubt drove a good business with that thriftless young Absalom, who, it is said wore golden bells on his sleeves and baldric. For <measure value="10bmark" type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> marks</measure>--not a very tremendous consideration, though it was, no doubt, all he could get-Richard's grandfather, that warlike and chivalrous monarch, Edward III., had already incorporated the Company, and given <QUOTE>the Mystery</QUOTE> of Goldsmiths the privilege of purchasing in mortmain an estate of <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> per annum, for the support of old and sick members; for these early guilds were benefit clubs as well as social companies, and jealous privileged monopolists; and Edward's grant gave the corporation the right to inspect, try, and regulate all gold and silver wares in any part of England, with the power to punish all offenders detected in <pb id="p.355" n="355">

 <pb id="p.356" n="356"> working adulterated gold and silver. Edward, in all, granted <num value="4">four</num> charters to the Worshipful Company.
<p>Henry IV., Henry V., and Edward IV. both granted and confirmed the liberties of the Company. The Goldsmiths' records commence <num value="5">5th</num> Edward III., and furnish much curious information. In this reign all who were of Goldsmiths' Hall were required to have shops in Chepe, and to sell no silver or gold vessels except in Chepe or in the King's Exchange. The <num value="1">first</num> charter complains loudly of counterfeit metal, of false bracelets, lockets, rings, and jewels, made and exported; and also of vessels of tin made and subtly silvered over.
<p>The Company began humbly enough, and in their <num value="1">first</num> year of incorporation (<datestruct value="1335--"><year reg="1335">1335</year></datestruct>) <num value="14">fourteen</num> apprentices only were bound, the fees for admission being as, and the pensions given to <num value="12">twelve</num> per-. sons come to only <measure value="1l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1">1</num></measure> <measure value="16s." type=currency><num value="16">16</num>s.</measure> In <datestruct value="1343--"><year reg="1343">1343</year></datestruct> the number of apprentices in the year rose to <num value="74">seventy-four</num>; and in <datestruct value="1344--"><year reg="1344">1344</year></datestruct> there were payments for licensing foreign workmen and non-freemen.
<p>During the Middle Ages these City companies were very attentive to religious observances, and the Wardens' accounts show constant entries referring to such ceremonies. Their great annual feast was on St. Dunstan's Day (St. Dunstan being the patron saint of goldsmiths), and the books of expenses show the cost of masses sung for the Company by the chaplain, payments for ringing the bells at St. Paul's, for drinking obits at the Company's standard at St. Paul's, for lights kept burning at St. James's Hospital, and for chantries maintained at the churches of St. John Zachary (the Goldsmiths' parish church), St. Peter-le-Chepe, St. Matthew, Friday Street, St. Vedast, Foster Lane, and others.
<p>About the reign of Henry VI. the records grow more interesting, and reflect more strongly the social life of the times they note. In <datestruct value="1443--"><year reg="1443">1443</year></datestruct> we find the Company received a special letter from Henry VI., desiring them, as a craft which had at all times <QUOTE>notably acquitted themselves,</QUOTE> more especially at the king's return from his coronation in Paris, to meet his queen, Margaret of Anjou, on her arrival, in company with the Mayor, aldermen, and the other London crafts. On this occasion the goldsmiths wore <QUOTE>bawderykes of gold, short jagged scarlet hoods,</QUOTE> and each past Warden or renter had his follower clothed in white, with a black hood and black felt hat. In this reign John Chest, a goldsmith of Chepe, for slanderous words against the Company, was condemned to come to Goldsmiths' Hall, and on his knees ask all the Company forgiveness for what he had myssayde; and was also forbidden to wear the livery of the Company for a whole month. Later still, in this reign, a goldsmith named German Lyas, for selling a tablet of adulterated gold, was compelled to give to the fraternity a gilt cup, weighing <num value="24">twenty-four</num> ounces, and to implore pardon on his knees. In <datestruct value="1458--"><year reg="1458">1458</year></datestruct>  (Henry VI.), a goldsmith was fined for giving a false return of broken gold to a servant of the Earl of Wiltshire, who had brought it to be sold.
<p>In the <num value="4">fourth</num> year of King Edward IV. a very curious trial of skill between the jealous English goldsmiths and their foreign rivals took place at the <QUOTE>Pope's Head</QUOTE> tavern (now Pope's Head Alley), Cornhill. The contending craftsmen had to engrave <num value="4">four</num> puncheons of steel (the breadth of a penny sterling) with cat's heads and naked figures in high relief and low relief; Oliver Davy, the Englishman, won, and White Johnson, the Alicant goldsmith, lost his wager of a crown and a dinner to the Company. In this reign there were <num value="137">137</num> native goldsmiths in London, and <num value="41">41</num> foreignerstotal, <num value="178">178</num>. The foreigners lived chiefly in Westminster, Southwark, St. Clement's Lane, Abchurch Lane, Brick Lane, and Bearbinder Lane.
<p>In <datestruct value="1511--"><year reg="1511">1511</year></datestruct> (Henry VIII.) the Company agreed to send <num value="12">twelve</num> men to attend the City Night-watch, on the vigils of St. John Baptist, and St. Peter and Paul. The men were to be cleanly harnessed, to carry bows and arrows, and to be arrayed in jackets of white, with the City arms. In <datestruct value="1540--"><year reg="1540">1540</year></datestruct> the Company sent <num value="6">six</num> of their body to fetch in the new Queen, Anne of Cleves, <QUOTE>the Flemish mare,</QUOTE> as her disappointed bridegroom called her. The <num value="6">six</num> goldsmiths must have looked very gallant in their black velvet coats, gold chains, and velvet caps with brooches of gold; and their servants in plain russet coats. Sir Martin Bowes was the great goldsmith in this reign; he is the man whom Stow accused, when Lord Mayor, of rooting up all the gravestones and monuments in the Grey Friars, and selling them for <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="50">50</num></measure>. He left almshouses at Woolwich, and <num value="2">two</num> houses in Lombard Street, to the Company.
<p>In <datestruct value="1546--"><year reg="1546">1546</year></datestruct> (same reign) the Company sent twentyfour men, by royal order, to the king's army. They were to be <QUOTE>honest, comely, and well-harnessed persons-<num value="4">four</num> of them bowmen, and <num value="12">twelve</num> billmen. They were arrayed in blue and red (after my Lord Norfolk's fashion), hats and hose red and blue, and with doublets of white fustian.</QUOTE> This same year, the greedy despot Henry having discovered some slight inaccuracy in the assay, contrived to extort from the poor abject goldsmiths a mighty fine of <measure value="3000bmark" type=currency><num value="3000">3,000</num> marks</measure>. The year this English Ahab died, the Goldsmiths resolved, in compliment to the Reformation, to break up the image of their patron saint, <pb id="p.357" n="357"> and also a great standing cup with an image of the same saint upon the top. Among the Company's plate there still exists a goodly cup given by Sir Martin Bowes, and which is said to be the same from which Queen Elizabeth drank at her coronation.
<p>The government of the Company has been seen to have been vested in an alderman in the reign of Henry II., and in <num value="4">four</num> wardens as early as <datestruct value="28"><year reg="28">28</year></datestruct> Edward I. The wardens were divided, at a later period, into a prime warden (always an alderman of London), a <num value="2">second</num> warden, and <num value="2">two</num> renter wardens. The clerk, under the name of <QUOTE>clerkcomptroller,</QUOTE> is not mentioned till <datestruct value="1494"><year reg="1494">1494</year></datestruct>; but a similar officer must have been established much earlier. <num value="4">Four</num> auditors and <num value="2">two</num> porters are named in the reign of Henry VI. The assayer, or as he is now called, assay warden (to whom were afterwards joined <num value="2">two</num> assistants), is peculiar to the Goldsmiths.
<p>The Company's assay of the coin, or trial of the pix, a curious proceeding of great solemnity, now takes place every year. <QUOTE>It is,</QUOTE> says Herbert, in his <title>City Companies,</title> <QUOTE><p>an investigation or inquiry into the purity and weight of the money coined, before the Lords of the Council, and is aided by the professional knowledge of a jury of the Goldsmiths' Company; and in a writ directed to the barons for that purpose (<num value="9">9</num> and <num value="10">10</num> Edward I.) is spoken of as a well-known custom.
<p>The Wardens of the Goldsmiths' Company are summoned by precept from the Lord Chancellor to form a jury, of which their assay master is always <num value="1">one</num>. This jury are sworn, receive a charge from the Lord Chancellor; then retire into the Courtroom of the Duchy of Lancaster, where the pix (a small box, from the ancient name of which this ceremony is denominated), and which contains' the coins to be examined, is delivered to them by the officers of the Mint. The indenture or authority under which the Mint Master has acted being read, the pix is opened, and the coins to be assayed being taken out, are inclosed in paper parcels, each under the seals of the Wardens, Master, and Comptrollers. From every <num value="15">15</num> lbs. of silver, which are technically called  <Q>journies,</Q>  <num value="2">two</num> pieces at the least are taken at hazard for this trial; and each parcel being opened, and the contents being found correct with the indorsement, the coins are mixed together in wooden bowls, and afterwards weighed. From the whole of these moneys so mingled, the jury take a certain number of each species of coin, to the amount of <num value="1">1</num> lb. weight, for the assay by fire; and the indented trial pieces of gold and silver, of the dates specified in the indenture, being produced by the proper officer, a sufficient quantity is cut from either of them for the purpose of comparing with it the pound weight of gold or silver by the usual methods of assay. The perfection or imperfection of these are certified by the jury, who deliver their verdict in writing to the Lord Chancellor, to be deposited amongst the papers of the Privy Council. If found accurate, the Mint Master receives his certificate, or, as it is called, <foreign lang=la>quietus</foreign></QUOTE>
(a legal word used by Shakespeare in Hamlet's great soliloquy). <QUOTE><p>The assaying of the precious metals, anciently called the  <Q>touch,</Q>  with the marking or stamping, and the proving of the coin, at what is called the  <Q>trial of the pix,</Q>  were privileges conferred on the Goldsmiths' Company by the statute <num value="28">28</num> Edward I. They had for the former purpose an assay office more than <num value="500">500</num> years ago, which is mentioned in their books. Their still retaining the same privilege makes the part of Goldsmiths' Hall, where this business is carried on, a busy scene during the hours of assaying. In the old statute all manner of vessels of gold and silver are expected to be of good and true alloy, namely,  <Q>gold of a certain <hi rend=italics>touch</hi>,</Q>  and silver of the sterling alloy; and no vessel is to depart out of the hands of the workman until it is assayed by the workers of the Goldsmiths' craft.
<p>The <hi rend=italics>Hall mark</hi> shows where manufactured, as the <hi rend=italics>Leopard's head</hi> for London. <hi rend=italics>Duty mark</hi> is the head of the Sovereign, showing the duty is paid.
 <hi rend=italics>Date mark</hi> is a letter of the alphabet, which varies every year; thus, the Goldsmiths' Company have used, from <datestruct value="1716--"><year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1755--"><year reg="1755">1755</year></datestruct>, Roman capital letters; <datestruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct>, small Roman letters; <datestruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>, old English letters; <datestruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct> to. <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>, Roman capital letters, from A to U, omitting J; <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct> small Roman letters a to u, omitting j; from <datestruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct>, old English letters. There are <num value="2">two</num> qualities of gold and silver. The inferior is mostly in use.. The quality marks for silver are Britannia, or the head of the reigning monarch; for gold, the lion passant, <num value="22">22</num> or <num value="18">18</num>, which denotes that fine gold is <num value="24">24</num>-carat; <num value="18">18</num> only <num value="75">75</num> per cent. gold; sometimes rings are marked <num value="22">22</num>. The <hi rend=italics>manufacturer's mark</hi> is the initials of the maker.
<p>The Company are allowed <num value="1">1</num> per cent., and the fees for stamping are paid into the Inland Revenue Office. At Goldsmiths' Hall, in the years <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg=1850>1850</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1863--"><year reg=1863>1863</year></datestruct> inclusive, there were assayed and marked <num value="85">85</num> <num value="22">22</num>-carat watch-case, <num value="316347">316,347</num> <num value="18">18</num>-carat, <num value="493">493</num> <num value="15">15</num>- carat, <datestruct value="1550--"><year reg="1550">1550</year></datestruct> <num value="12">12</num>-carat, <num value="448">448</num> <num value="9">9</num>-carat, making a total of <num value="318923">318,923</num> cases, weighing <num value="467250">467,250</num> ounces <num value="6">6</num> dwts. <num value="8">8</num> grains. The Goldsmiths' Company append a note to this return, stating that they have no knowledge of the value of the cases assayed, <pb id="p.358" n="358"> except of the intrinsic value, as indicated by the weight and quality of the gold given in the return.

A similar note with regard to value is appended to the return of silver cases as to the gold.</QUOTE> There has been a complaint lately that the inferior jewellery is often tampered with after receiving the Hall mark.
<p>An old book, probably Elizabethan, the <QUOTE>Touchstone for Goldsmith's Wares,</QUOTE> observes, <QUOTE>That goldsmiths in the City and liberties, as to their particular trade, are under the Goldsmiths' Company's control, whether members or not, and ought to be of
 <hi rend=italics>their own company</hi>, though, from mistake or design, many of them are free of others. For the wardens, being by their charters and the statutes appointed to survey, assay, and mark the silver-work, are to be chosen from members, such choice must sometimes fall upon them that are either of other trades, or not skilled in their curious art of making assays of gold and silver, and consequently unable to make a true report of the goodness thereof; or else the necessary attendance thereon is too great a burden for the wardens. Therefore they (the wardens) have appointed an <hi rend=italics>assay master</hi>, called by them their deputy warden, allowing him a considerable yearly salary, and who takes an oath for the due performance of his office. They have large steel puncheons and marks of different sizes, with the leopard's-head, crowned; the <hi rend=italics>lion</hi>, and a certain
 <hi rend=italics>letter</hi>, which letter they change alphabetically every year, in order to know the year any particular work was assayed or marked, as well as the markers. These marks,</QUOTE> he adds, <QUOTE>are every year new made, for the use of fresh wardens; and although the assaying is referred to the assay master, yet the
 <hi rend=italics>touch-wardens</hi> look to the striking of the marks.</QUOTE> o acquaint the public the better with this business of the assay, the writer of the <QUOTE>Touchstone</QUOTE> has prefixed a frontispiece to his work, intended to represent the interior of an assay office (we should suppose that of the old Goldsmiths' Hall), and makes reference by numbers to the various objects shown-as, i. The refining furnace; <num value="2">2</num>. The test, with silver refining in it; <num value="3">3</num>. The fining bellows; <num value="4">4</num>. The man blowing or working them; <num value="5">5</num>. The test-mould; <num value="6">6</num>. A wind-hole to melt silver in, with bellows; <num value="7">7</num>.

In the office are stated to be a sworn weigher to weigh and make entry of all silver-work brought in, and who re-weighs it to the owners when worked, reserving the ancient allowance for so doing,which is <num value="4">4</num> grains out of every i lb. marked, for a re-assay yearly of all the silver works they have passed the preceding year. There are also, he says, a table, or tables, in columns, <num value="1">one</num> whereof is of hardened lead, and the other of vellum or parchment (the lead columns having the worker's initials struck in them, and the other the owner's names); and the seeing that these marks are right, and plainly impressed on the gold and silver work, is <num value="1">one</num> of the warden's peculiar duties. The manner of marking the assay is thus:--The assay master puts a small quantity of the silver upon trial in the fire, and then, taking it out again, he, with his exact scales <hi rend=italics>that will turn with the weight of the hundredth</hi> part of a grain, computes and re. ports the goodness or badness of the gold and silver.

<p>In City pageants the Goldsmiths always held a conspicuous place. The following is an account of their pageant in jovial Lord Mayor Vyner's time (Charles II.) :--
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p><num value="1">First</num> pageant. A large triumphal chariot of gold, richly set with divers inestimable and various coloured jewels, of dazzling splendour, adorned with sundry curious figures, fictitious stories, and delightful landscapes; <num value="1">one</num> ascent of seats up to a throne, whereon a person of majestic aspect sitteth, the representer of Justice, hieroglyphically attired, in a long red robe, and on it a golden mantle fringed with silver; on her head a long dishevelled hair of flaxen colour, curiously curled, on which is a coronet of silver; in her left hand she advanceth a touchstone (the tryer of <hi rend=italics>Truth</hi> and discoverer of
<hi rend=italics>Falsehood</hi>); in her right hand she holdeth up a golden balance, with silver scales, equi-ponderent, to weigh justly and, impartially; her arms dependent on the heads of <num value="2">two</num> leopards, which emblematically intimate <hi rend=italics>courage</hi> and constancy. This chariot is drawn by <num value="2">two</num> golden unicorns, in excellent carving work, with equal magnitude, to the left; on whose backs are mounted <num value="2">two</num> raven-black negroes, attired according to the dress of India; on their heads, wreaths of divers coloured feathers; in their right hands they hold golden cups; in their left hands, <num value="2">two</num> displayed banners, the <num value="1">one</num> of the king's, the other of the Company's arms, all which represent the crest and the supporters of the ancient, famous, and worshipful Company of Goldsmiths.
<p>Trade pageant. On a very large pageant is a very rich seat of state, containing the representer of the Patron to the Goldsmiths' Company, Saint Dunstan, attired in a dress properly expressing his prelatical, dignity, in a robe of fine white lawn, over which he weareth a cope or vest of costly bright cloth of gold, down to the ground; on his reverend grey head, a golden mitre, set with topaz, ruby, emerald, amethyst, and sapphire. In his left hand he holdeth a golden crozier, and in his right hand he useth a pair of goldsmith's tongs. Beneath these steps of ascension to his chair, in opposition to St. Dunstan, is properly painted a goldsmith's forge and furnace, with fire and gold in it, aworkman blowing with the bellows. On his right and left hand, there is a large press of gold and silver plate, representing a shop of trade; and further in front, are several artificers at work on anvils with hammers, beating out plate fit for the forgery and formation of several vessels in gold and silver. There are likewise in the shop several wedges or ingots of gold and silver, and a step below St. Dunstan sitteth an assay-master, with his glass frame and balance, for trial of gold and silver, according to the standard. In another place there is also disgrossing, drawing, and flatting of gold and silver wire. There are also finers melting, smelting, fining, and parting gold and silver, both by fire and water; and in a march before this orfery, are divers miners in canvas breeches, red waistcoats, and red caps, bearing spades, pickaxes, twibills, and crows, for to sink shafts, and make adits. The Devil, also, appearing to St. Dunstan, is catched by the nose at a proper qu, which is given in his speech. When the speech is spoken, the great anvil is set forth, with a silversmith holding on it a plate of massive silver, and <num value="3">three</num> other workmen at work, keeping excellent time in their orderly strokes upon the anvil.</QUOTE>

<p>The Goldsmiths in the Middle Ages seem to have been fond of dress. In a great procession of the London crafts to meet Richard II.'s fair young queen, Anne of Bohemia, all the mysteries of the City wore red and black liveries. The Goldsmiths had on the red of their dresses bars of silver-work and Silver trefoils, and each of the <num value="7">seven</num> score Goldsmiths, on the black part, wore fine knots of gold and silk, and on their worshipful heads red hats, powdered with silver trefoils. In Edward IV.'s reign, the Company's taste changed. The Liverymen wore violet and scarlet gowns like the Goldsmiths' sworn friends, the Fishmongers; while, under Henry VII., they wore violet gowns and black hoods. In Henry VIII.'s reign the hoods of the mutable Company went back again to violet and scarlet.
<p>In <datestruct value="1456--"><year reg="1456">1456</year></datestruct> (Henry VI.) the London citizens seem to have been rather severe with their apprentices; for we find William Hede, a goldsmith, accusing his apprentice of beating his mistress. The apprentice was brought to the kitchen of the Goldsmith's Hall, and there stripped naked, and beaten by his master till blood came. This punishment was inflicted in the presence of several <pb id="p.360" n="360"> people. The apprentice then asked his master's forgiveness on his knees.
<p>The Goldsmiths' searches for bad and defective work were arbitrary enough, and made with great formality. <QUOTE>The wardens,</QUOTE> say the ordinances, <QUOTE>every quarter, once, or oftener, if need be, shall search in London, Southwark, and Westminster, that all the goldsmiths there dwelling work true gold and silver, according to the Act of Parliament, and shall also make due search for their weights.</QUOTE>
<p>The manner of making this search, as elsewhere detailed, seems to have resembled that of our modern inquest, or annoyance juries; the Company's beadle, in full costume and with his insignia of office, marching <num value="1">first</num>; the wardens, in livery, with their hoods; the Company's clerk, <num value="2">two</num> renter wardens, <num value="2">two</num> brokers, porters, and other attendants,
<FIGURE id="Fig.360" n="2000.06.0128"><HEAD>Exterior Of Goldsmiths' Hall.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 also dressed, following. Their mode of proceeding is given in the following account, entitled <QUOTE>The Manner and Order for Searches at Bartholomew Fayre and Our Ladye Fayre</QUOTE> (Henry VIII.):--
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Md. The Bedell for the time beyng shall walke uppon Seynt Barthyllmewes Eve all alonge Chepe, for to see what plaate ys in eu'y mannys deske and gyrdyll. And so the sayd wardeyns for to goo into Lumberd Streate, or into other places there, where yt shall please theym. And also the clerk of the Fellyshyppe shall wayt uppon the seyd wardeyns for to wryte eury prcell of sylur stuffe then distrayned by the sayd wardeyns.
<p>Also the sayd wardeyns been accustomed to goo into Barth'u Fayre, uppon the evyn or daye, at theyr pleasure, in theyre lyuerey gownes and hoodys, as they will appoint, and <num value="2">two</num> of the livery, <pb id="p.361" n="361"> ancient men, with them; the renters, the clerk, and the bedell, in their livery, with them; and the brokers to wait upon my masters the wardens, to see every hardware men show, for deceitful things, beads, gawds of beads, and other stuff; and then they to drink when they have done, where they please.
<p>Also the said wardens be accustomed at our Lady day, the Nativity, to walk and see the fair at Southwark, in like manner with their company, as is aforesaid, and to search there likewise.</QUOTE>

<p>Another order enjoins the <num value="2">two</num> <num value="2">second</num> wardens <QUOTE>to ride into Stourbrydge fair, with what officers they liked, and do the same.</QUOTE>
<p>Amongst other charges against the trade at this date, it is said <QUOTE>that dayly divers straungers and other gentils</QUOTE> complained and found themselves aggrieved, that they came to the shops of goldsmiths within the Cityof London, and without the City, and to their booths and fairs, markets, and other places, and there bought of them <hi rend=italics>old plate</hi> new refreshed in gilding and burnishing; it appearing to all <QUOTE>such straungers and other gentils</QUOTE> that such old plate, so by them bought, was new, sufficient, and able; whereby all such were deceived, to the grete <QUOTE>dysslaunder and jeopardy of all the seyd crafte of goldsmythis.</QUOTE>
<p>In consequence of these complaints, it was ordained (<num value="15">15</num> Henry VII.) by all the said fellow ship, that no goldsmith, within or without the City, should thenceforth put to sale such description of plate, in any of the places mentioned, without it had the mark of the <QUOTE>Lybardishede crowned.</QUOTE> All plate put to sale contrary to these orders the wardens were empowered to break. They also had the power, at their discretion, to fine offenders for this and any other frauds in manufacturing. If any goldsmith attempted to prevent the wardens from breaking bad work, they could seize such work, and declare it forfeited, according to the Act of Parliament, appropriating the <num value="1">one</num> half (as thereby
<FIGURE id="Fig.361" n="2000.06.0129"><HEAD>Altar Of Diana (see page <num value="362">362</num>).</HEAD></FIGURE>
 directed) to the king, and the other to the wardens breaking and making the seizure.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.361.1">The present Goldsmiths' Hall</lemma> was the design of Philip Hardwick, R.A. (<datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>-<num value="5">5</num>) and boasts itself the most magnificent of the City halls. The old hall had been taken down in <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>, and the new hall was built without trenching on the funds set apart for charity. The style is Italian, of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> and eighteenth centuries. The building is <num value="180">180</num> feet in front and <num value="100">100</num> feet deep. The west or chief facade has <num value="6">six</num> attached Corinthian columns, the whole height of the front supporting a rich Corinthian entablature and bold cornice; and the other <num value="3">three</num> fronts are adorned with pilasters, which also terminate the angles. Some of the blocks in the column shafts weigh from <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="12">twelve</num> tons each. The windows of the principal story, the echinus moulding of which is handsome, have bold and enriched pediments, and the centre windows are honoured by massive balustrade balconies. In the centre, above the <num value="1">first</num> floor, are the Company's arms, festal emblems, rich garlands, and trophies. The entrance door is a rich specimen of cast work. Altogether, though rather jammed up behind the Post-office, this building is worthy of the powerful and wealthy company who make it their domicile. The modern Renaissance style, it must be allowed, though less picturesque than the Gothic, is lighter, more stately, and more adapted for certain purposes.
<P>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.361.2">The hall and staircase</lemma> are much admired, and are not without grandeur. They were in <datestruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></datestruct> entirely lined with costly marbles of different sorts and colours, and the result is very splendid. The staircase branches right and left, and ascends to a domed gallery. Leaving that respectable Cerberus dozy but watchful in his bee-hive chair in the vestibule, we ascend the steps. On the square pedestals which ornament the balustrade of the <num value="1">first</num> flight of stairs stand

Between the double scagliola columns of the gallery are a group of statues; the bust of the sailor king, William IV., by Chantrey, is in a niche above. A door on the top of the staircase opens to the Livery hall; the room for the Court of Assistants is on the right of the northernmost corridor.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.362.4">display of plate</lemma>, which is lighted from above. On the side of the room is a large mirror, with busts of George III. and his worthy son, George IV. Between the columns are portraits of Queen Adelaide, by Sir Martin Archer Shee, and William IV. and Queen Victoria, by the Court painter, Sir George Hayter. The court-room has an elaborate stucco ceiling, with a glass chandelier, which tinkles when the scarlet mail-carts rush off <num value="1">one</num> after another. In this room, beneath glass, is preserved the interesting little altar of Diana, found in digging the foundations of the new hall. Though greatly corroded, it has been of fine workmanship, and the outlines are full of grace. There are also some pictures of great merit and interest. <num value="1">First</num> among them is Janssen's fine portrait of Sir Hugh Myddleton. He is dressed in black, and rests his hand upon a shell. This great benefactor of London left a share in his water-works to the Goldsmiths' Company, which is now worth more than <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> a year. Another portrait is that of Sir Thomas Vyner, that jovial Lord Mayor, who dragged Charles II. back for a <num value="2">second</num> bottle. A <num value="3">third</num> is a portrait (after Holbein) of Sir Martin Bowes, Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1545--"><year reg="1545">1545</year></datestruct> (Henry VIII.); and there is also a large picture (attributed to Giulio Romano, the only painter Shakespeare mentions in his plays). In the foreground is St. Dunstan, in rich robes and crozier in hand, while behind, the saint takes the Devil by the nose, much to the approval of flocks of angels above. The great white marble mantelpiece came from Canons, the seat of the Duke of Chandos; and the <num value="2">two</num> large terminal busts are attributed to Roubiliac. The sumptuous drawing-room, adorned with crimson satin, white and gold, has immense mirrors, and a stucco ceiling, wrought with fruit, flowers, birds, and animals, with coats of arms blazoned on the <num value="4">four</num> corners. The court dining-room displays on the marble chimney-piece <num value="2">two</num> boys holding a wreath encircling the portrait of Richard II., by whom the

<LEMMA resp=bolles id="lemma.362.8">The Company's plate</LEMMA>, as <num value="1">one</num> might suppose, is very magnificent, and comprises a chandelier of chased gold, weighing <num value="1000">1,000</num> ounces; <num value="2">two</num> superb old gold plates, having on them the arms of France quartered with those of England; and, last of all, there is

<p> <QUOTE>Dark Entry, Foster Lane,</QUOTE> says Strype, <QUOTE>gives a passage into St. Martin's-le-Grand.

<p>St. Vedast, otherwise St. Foster, was a French saint, Bishop of Arras and Cambray in the reign of Clovis, who, according to the Rev. Alban Butler, performed many miracles on the blind and lame. Alaric had a great veneration for this saint.

When found, it contained a skeleton, and was covered with a flat stone. Several other stone coffins were found at the same time.
<p>The interior of St. Foster is a melancholy instance of Louis Quatorze ornamentation. The church is divided by a range of Tuscan columns, and the ceiling is enriched with dusty wreaths of stucco flowers and fruit. The altar-piece consists of <num value="4">four</num> Corinthian columns, carved in oak, and garnished with cherubim, palm-branches, &amp;c. n the centre, above the entablature, is a group of well-executed winged figures, and beneath is a sculptured pelican.

Stow has <num value="2">two</num> conjectures as to its namefirst, that it was so called because the houses in it were built all of wood, contrary to Richard I&lsquo;s edict that London houses should be built of stone, to prevent fire; secondly, that it was called after <num value="1">one</num> Thomas Wood, sheriff in <datestruct value="1491--"><year reg="1491">1491</year></datestruct> (Henry VII.), who dwelt in this street, was a benefactor to St. Peter in Chepe, and built <QUOTE>the beautiful row of houses over against Wood Street end.</QUOTE>
<p>At Cheapside Cross, which stood at the corner of Wood Street, all royal proclamations used to be read, even long after the cross was removed. Thus, in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, we find Charles II.'s declaration of war against Louis XIV. proclaimed by the officers at arms, serjeants at arms, trumpeters, &amp;c., at Whitehall Gate, Temple Bar, the end of Chancery Lane, Wood Street, Cheapside, and the Royal Exchange. Huggin's Lane, in this street, derives its name, as Stow tells us, from a London citizen who dwelt here in the reign of Edward I., and was called Hugan in the Lane.
<p>That pleasant tree at the left-hand corner of Wood Street, which has cheered many a weary business man with memories of the fresh green fields far away, was for long the residence of rooks, who built there. In <datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct> <num value="2">two</num> fresh nests were built, and <num value="1">one</num> is still visible; but the sable birds deserted their noisy town residence several years ago. Probably, as the north of London was more built over, and such feeding-grounds as Belsiie Park turned to brick and mortar, the birds found the fatigue of going miles in search of food for their young unbearable, and so migrated. Leigh Hunt, in <num value="1">one</num> of his agreeable books, remarks that there are few districts in London where you will not find a tree. <QUOTE>A child was shown us,</QUOTE> says Leigh Hunt, <QUOTE>who was said never to have beheld a tree but <num value="1">one</num> in St. Paul's Churchyard (now gone). Whenever a tree was mentioned, it was this <num value="1">one</num>; she had no conception of any other, not even of the remote tree in Cheapside.</QUOTE> This famous tree marks the site of St. Peter in Chepe, a church destroyed by the Great Fire. The terms of the lease of the low houses at the west-end corner are said to forbid the erection of another storey or the removal of the tree. Whether this restriction arose from a love of the tree, as we should like to think, we cannot say.
<p>St. Peter's in Chepe is a rectory (says Stow), <QUOTE>the church whereof stood at the south-west corner of Wood Sireet, in the ward of Farringdon Within, but of what antiquity I know not, other than that Thomas de Winton was rector thereof in <datestruct value="1324--"><year reg="1324">1324</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE>
<p>The patronage of this church was anciently in the Abbot and Convent of St. Albans, with whom it continued till the suppression of their monastery, when Henry VIII., in the year <datestruct value="1546"><year reg="1546">1546</year></datestruct>, granted the same to the Earl of Southampton. It afterwards belonged to the Duke of Montague. This church being destroyed in the fire and not rebuilt, the parish is united to the Church of St. Matthew, Friday Street. <QUOTE>In the year <datestruct value="1401"><year reg="1401">1401</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE> says Maitland, <QUOTE>licence was granted to the inhabitants of this parish to erect a shed or shop before their church in Cheapside. On the site of this building, anciently called the  <Q>Long Shop,</Q>  are now erected <num value="4">four</num> shops, with rooms over them.</QUOTE>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.364.1">Wordsworth</lemma> has immortalised Wood Street by his plaintive little ballad-
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><p>THE REVERIE OF POOR SUSAN.
<LG type=stanza><L>At the corner of Wood Street, when daylight appears,
<L>Hangs a thrush that sings loud, it has sung for <num value="3">three</num> years;
<L>Poor Susan has passed by the spot, and has heard
<L>In the silence of morning the song of the bird.</LG><LG>

<L>&lsquo;Tis a note of enchantment; what ails her? she sees
<L>A mountain ascending, a vision of trees;
<L>Bright volumes of vapour through Lothbury glide,
<L>And a river flows on through the vale of Cheapside.</LG><LG>

<L>Green pastures she views in the midst of the dale,
<L>Down which she so often has tripped with her pail;
<L>And a single small cottage, a nest like a dove's,
<L>The <num value="1">one</num> only dwelling on earth that she loves.</LG><LG>

<L>She looks, and her heart is in heaven; but they fade,
<L>The mist and the river, the hill and the shade;
<L>The stream will not flow, and the hill will not rise,
<L>And the colours have all passed away from her eyes.</QUOTE>

<p>Perhaps some summer morning the poet, passing down Cheapside, saw the plane-tree at the corner wave its branches to him as a friend waves a hand, and at that sight there passed through his mind an imagination of some poor Cumberland servant-girl toiling in London, and regretting her far-off home among the pleasant hills.
<p>St. Michael's, Wood Street, is a rectory situated on the west side of Wood Street, in the ward of Cripplegate Within. John de Eppewell was rector <pb id="p.365" n="365"> thereof before the year <datestruct value="1328"><year reg="1328">1328</year></datestruct>. <QUOTE>The patronage was anciently in the Abbot and Convent of St. Albans, in whom it continued till the suppression of their monastery, when, coming to the Crown, it was, with the appurtenances, in the year <datestruct value="1544"><year reg="1544">1544</year></datestruct>, sold by Henry VIII. to William Barwell, who, in the year <datestruct value="1588"><year reg="1588">1588</year></datestruct>, conveyed the same to John Marsh and others, in trust for the parish, in which it still continues.</QUOTE> Being destroyed in the Great Fire, it was rebuilt, in <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, from the designs of Sir Christopher Wren. At the east end <num value="4">four</num> Ionic pillars support an entablature and pediment, and the <num value="3">three</num> circular-headed windows are well proportioned. The south side faces Huggin Lane, but the tower and spire are of no interest. The interior of the church is a large parallelogram, with an ornamented carved ceiling. In <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct> the church was repaired and the tower thrown open. The altarpiece represents Moses and Aaron. The vestrybooks date from the beginning of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, and contain, among others, memoranda of parochial rejoicings, such as- <QUOTE><datestruct value="1620--"><year reg="1620">1620</year></datestruct>. <datestruct value="11-9"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=9>9</day></datestruct> Paid for ringing and a bonfire, <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>s.</measure></QUOTE>
<p>The Church of St. Mary Staining being destroyed in the Great Fire, the parish was annexed to that of St. Michael's. The following is the most curious of the monumental inscriptions:--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>John Casey, of this parish, whose dwelling was
<L>In the north-corner house as to Lad Lane you pass;

<L>That when meagre death shall take yee away;
<L>You may live like form'd as Casey and Bowrman-

<p>Here was also a monument to Queen Elizabeth, with this inscription, found in many other London churches:--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=stanza><L>Here lyes her type, who was of late

<p>There was buried here (but without any outward monument) the head of James, the <num value="4">fourth</num> King of cots, slain at Flodden Field. After the battle, the body of the said king being found, was closed in lead, and conveyed from thence to London, and so to the monastery of Shene, in Surrey, where it remained for a time. <QUOTE>But since the dissolution of that house,</QUOTE> says Stow, <QUOTE>in the reign of Edward VI., Henry Gray, Duke of Suffolk, lodged and kept house there. I have been shown the said body, so lapped in lead. The head and body were thrown into a waste room, amongst the old timber, lead, and other rubble; since which time workmen there, for their foolish pleasure, hewed off his head; and Launcelot Young, master glazier to Queen Elizabeth, feeling a sweet savour to come from thence, and seeing the same dried from moisture, and yet the form remaining with the hair of the head and beard red, brought it to London, to his house in Wood Street, where for a time he kept it for the sweetness, but in the end caused the sexton of that church to bury it amongst other bones taken out of their charnel.</QUOTE>
<P> <QUOTE>The parish church of St. Michael, in Wood Street, is a proper thing,</QUOTE> says Strype, <QUOTE>and lately well repaired; John Iue, parson of this church, John Forster, goldsmith, and Peter Fikelden, taylor, gave <num value="2">two</num> messuages and shops, in the same parish and street, and in Ladle Lane, to the reparation of the church, the <num value="16">16th</num> of Richard II. In the year <datestruct value="1627"><year reg="1627">1627</year></datestruct> the parishioners made a new door to this church into Wood Street, where till then it had only <num value="1">one</num> door, standing in Huggin Lane.</QUOTE>
<p>St. Mary Staining, in Wood Street, destroyed by the Great Fire, stood on the north side of Oat Lane, in the Ward of Aldersgate Within. <QUOTE>The additional epithet of <hi rend=italics>staining</hi>,</QUOTE> says Maitland, <QUOTE>is as uncertain as the time of the foundation; some imagining it to bederived from the painters' stainers, who probably lived near it; and others from its being built with stone, to distinguish it from those in the City that were built with wood.</QUOTE> The advowson of the rectory anciently belonged to the Prioress and Convent of Clerkenwell, in whom it continued till their suppression by Henry VIII., when it came to the Crown. The parish, as previously observed, is now united to St. Michael's, Wood Street. That this church is not of a modem foundation, is manifest from John de Lukenore's being rector thereof before the year <datestruct value="1328"><year reg="1328">1328</year></datestruct>.
<p>St. Alban's, Wood Street, in the time of Paul, the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> Abbot of St. Alban's, belonged to the Verulam monastery, but in <datestruct value="1077--"><year reg="1077">1077</year></datestruct> the abbot exchanged the right of presentation to this church for the patronage of <num value="1">one</num> belonging to the Abbot of <pb id="p.366" n="366"> Westminster. Matthew Paris says that this Wood Street Church was the chapel of King Offa, the founder of St. Alban's Abbey, who had a palace near it. Stow says it was of great antiquity, and that Roman bricks were visible here and there among the stones. Maitland thinks it probable that it was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> churches built by Alfred in London after he had driven out the Danes. The right of presentation to the church was originally possessed by the master, brethren, and sisters of St. James's Leper Hospital (site of St. James's Palace), and after the death of Henry VI. it was vested in the Provost and Fellows of Eton College. In the reign of Charles II. the parish was united to that of St. Olave, Silver Street, and the right of presentation is now exercised alternately by Eton College and the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's. The style of the interior of the church is late pointed. The windows appear older than the rest of the building. The ceiling in the nave exhibits bold groining, and the general effect is not unpleasing.

 says Seymour, <QUOTE>is the name, by which it was <num value="1">first</num> dedicated to St. Alban, the <num value="1">first</num> martyr of England. Another character of the antiquity of it is to be seen in the manner of the turning of the arches to the windows, and the heads of the pillars. A <num value="3">third</num> note appears in the Roman bricks, here and there inlaid amongst the stones of the building. Very probable it is that this church is, at least, of as ancient a standing as King Adelstane, the Saxon, who, as tradition says, had his house at the east end of this church. This king's house, having a door also into Adel Street, in this parish, gave name, as &lsquo;tis thought, to the said Adel Street, which, in all evidences, to this day is written King Adel Street. <num value="1">One</num> great square tower of this king's house seemed, in Stow's time, to be then remaining, and to be seen at the north corner of Love Lane, as you come from Aldermanbury, which tower was of the very same stone and manner of building with St. Alban's Church.</QUOTE>
<p>About the commencement of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century St. Alban's, being in a state of great decay, was surveyed by Sir Henry Spiller and Inigo <pb id="p.367" n="367"> Jones, and in accordance with their advice, apparently, in <datestruct value="1632--"><year reg="1632">1632</year></datestruct> it was pulled down, and rebuilt

<p>The pulpit (says Seymour) is finely carved with an enrichment, in imitation of fruit and leaves; and the sound-board is a hexagon, having round it a fine cornice, adorned with cherubims and other embellishments, and the inside is neatly finniered. The altar-piece is very ornamental, consisting of <num value="4">four</num> columns, fluted with their bases, pedestals, entablature, and open pediment of the Corinthian order; and over each column, upon acroters, is a lamp with a gilded taper. Between the inner columns are the <num value="10">Ten</num> Commandments, done in gold letters upon black. Between the <num value="2">two</num>, northward, is the Lord's Prayer, and the <num value="2">two</num> southward the Creed, done in gold upon blue. Over the commandments is a Glory between <num value="2">two</num> cherubims, and above the cornice the king's arms with the supporters, helmet, and crest, richly carved, under a triangular pediment; and on the north and south side of the above described ornaments are <num value="2">two</num> large cartouches, all of which parts are carved in fine wainscot. The church is well paved with oak, and here are twolarge brass branches and a marble font, having enrichments of cherubims, &amp;c.
<p>In a curious brass frame, attached to a tall stem, opposite the pulpit is an hour-glass, by which the preacher could measure his sermon and test his listeners' patience. The hour-glass at St. Dunstan's, Fleet Street, was taken down in <datestruct value="1723--"><year reg="1723">1723</year></datestruct>, and <num value="2">two</num> heads for the parish staves made out of the silver.
<p>Wood Street Compter (says Cunningham) was <num value="1">first</num> established in <datestruct value="1555--"><year reg="1555">1555</year></datestruct>, when, on the Feast of St. Michael the Archangel in that year, the prisoners were removed from the Old Compter in Bread Street to the New Compter in Wood Street, Cheapside. This compter was burnt down in the Great Fire, but was rebuilt in <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>. It stood on the east side of the street, and was removed to Giltspur Street in <datestruct value="1791--"><year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>. There were <num value="2">two</num> compters in London--the compter in Wood Street, under the control of <num value="1">one</num> of the sheriffs, and the compter in the Poultry, under the superintendence of the other. Under each sheriff was a secondary, a clerk of the papers, <num value="4">four</num> clerk sitters, eighteen serjeants-at-mace (each serjeant having his yeomen), a master keeper, and <num value="2">two</num> turnkeys. The serjeants wore blue and coloured cloth gowns, and the words of arrest were, <QUOTE>Sir, we arrest you in the King's Majesty's name, and we charge you to obey us.</QUOTE> There were <num value="3">three</num> sides--the master's side, the dearest of all; the knights' ward, a little cheaper; and the Hole, the cheapest of all. The register of entries was called the Black Book. Garnish was demanded at every step, and the Wood Street Compter was hung with the story of the prodigal son.
<p>When the Wood Street counter gate was opened, the prisoner's name was enrolled in the black book, and he was asked if he was for the master's side, the Knight's ward, or the Hole. At every fresh door a fee was demanded, the stranger's hat or cloak being detained if he refused to pay the extortion, which, in prison language, was called <QUOTE>garnish.</QUOTE> The <num value="1">first</num> question to a new prisoner was, whether he was in by arrest or command; and there was generally some knavish attorney in a threadbare black suit, who, for <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num> shillings</measure> would offer to move for a habeas corpus, and have him out presently, much to the amusement of the villanouslooking men who filled the room, some smoking and some drinking. At dinner a vintner's boy, who was in waiting, filled a bowl full of claret, and compelled the new prisoner to drink to all the society; and the turnkeys, who were dining in another room, then demanded another tester for a quart of wine to quaff to the new comer's health.
<p>At the end of a week, when the prisoner's purse grew thin, he was generally compelled to pass over to the knight's side, and live in a humbler and more restricted manner. Here a fresh garnish of eighteen pence was demanded, and if this was refused, he was compelled to sleep over the drain; or, if he chose, to sit up, to drink and smoke in the cellar with vile companions till the keepers ordered every man to his bed.
<p>Fennor, an actor in <datestruct value="1617--"><year reg="1617">1617</year></datestruct> (James. I.), wrote a curious pamphlet on the abuses of this compter. <QUOTE>For what extreme extortion,</QUOTE> says the angry writer,
<QUOTE><p>is it when a gentleman is brought in by the watch for some misdemeanour committed, that he must pay at least an angell before he be discharged; hee must pay twelvepence for turning the key at the master-side dore <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> to the chamberleine, twelvepence for his garnish for wine, tenpence for his dinner, whether he stay or no, and when he comes to be discharged at the booke, it will cost at least <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence more, besides sixpence for the booke-keeper's paines, and sixpence for the porter. <gap> And if a gentleman stay there but <num value="1">one</num> night, he must pay for his <pb id="p.369" n="369"> garnish sixteene pence, besides a groate for his lodging, and so much for his sheetes. When a gentleman is upon his discharge, and hath given satisfaction for his executions, they must have fees for irons, <num value="3">three</num> halfepence in the pound, besides the other fees, so that if a man were in for a <num value="1000">thousand</num> or fifteene <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> pound</measure> execution, they will if a man is so madde have so many <num value="3">three</num> halfepence.

<p>In early life Thomas Ripley, afterwards a celebrated architect, kept a carpenter's shop and coffee house in Wood Street. Marrying a servant of Sir Robert Walpole, the Prime Minister of George I., this lucky pushing man soon obtained work from the Crown and a seat at the Board of Works, and supplanted that great genius who built St. Paul's, to the infinite disgrace of the age. Ripley built the Admiralty, and Houghton all, Norfolk, for his early patron, Walpole, and died rich in <datestruct value="1758--"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct> .
<p>Wood Street is associated with that last extraordinary outburst of the Civil War fanaticism-the Anabaptist rising in <datestruct VALUE="1661-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1661">1661</year></datestruct>.
<p>On Sunday, <datestruct VALUE="1661-01-6"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=6>6</day>, <year reg=1661>1661</year></datestruct>, we read in <title>Somers' Tracts,</title> <QUOTE><p>these monsters assembled at their meeting-house, in Coleman Street, where they armed themselves, and sallying thence, came to St. Paul's in the dusk of the evening, and there, after ordering their small party, placed sentinels, <num value="1">one</num> of whom killed a person accidentally passing by, because he said he was for God and King Charles when challenged by him. This giving the alarm, and some parties of trained bands charging them, and being repulsed, they marched to Bishopsgate, thence to Cripplegate and Aldersgate, where, going out, in spite of the constables and watch, they declared for King Jesus. Proceeding to Beech Lane, they killed a headborough, who would have opposed them. It was observed that all they shot, though never so slightly wounded, died. Then they hasted away to Cane Wood, where they lurked, resolved to make another effort upon the City, but were drove thence, and routed by a party of horse and foot, sent for that purpose, about <num value="30">thirty</num> being taken and brought before General Monk, who committed them to the Gate House.

<P>Nevertheless, the others who had escaped out of the wood returned to London, not doubting of success in their enterprise; Venner, a winecooper by trade, and their head, affirming, he was assured that no weapons employed against them would prosper, nor a hair of their head be touched; which their coming off at <num value="1">first</num> so well made them willing to believe. These fellows had taken the opportunity of the king's being gone to Portsmouth, having before made a disposition for drawing to them of other desperate rebels, by publishing a declaration called,  <Q>A Door of Hope Opened,</Q>  full of abominable slanders against the whole royal family.
<P>On Wednesday morning, <datestruct value="01-9"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=9>9</day></datestruct>, after the watches and guards were dismissed, they resumed their <num value="1">first</num> enterprise. The <num value="1">first</num> appearance was in Threadneedle Street, where they alarmed the trained bands upon duty that day, and drove back a party sent after them, to their main guard, which then marched in a body towards them. The <num value="5">Fifth</num> Monarchists retired into Bishopsgate Street, where some of them took into an alehouse, known by the sign of  <Q>The Helmet,</Q>  where, after a sharp dispute, <num value="2">two</num> were killed, and as many taken, the same number of the trained bands being killed and wounded. The next sight of them (for they vanished and appeared again on a sudden), was at College Hill, which way they went into Cheapside, and so into Wood Street, Venner leading them, with a morrion on his head and a halbert in his hand. Here was the main and hottest action, for they fought stoutly with the Trained Bands, and received a charge from the Life Guards, whom they obliged to give way, until, being overpowered, and Venner knocked down and wounded and shot, Tufney and Crag, <num value="2">two</num> others of their chief teachers, being killed by him, they began to give ground, and soon after dispersed, flying outright and taking several ways. The greatest part of them went down Wood Street to Cripplegate, firing in the rear at the Yellow Trained Bands, then in close pursuit of them. <num value="10">Ten</num> of them took into the  <Q>Blue Anchor</Q>  ale-house, near the postern, which house they maintained until Lieutenant-Colonel Cox, with his company, secured <pb id="p.371" n="371"> all the avenues to it. In the meantime, some of the aforesaid Yellow Trained Bands got upon the tiles of the next house, which they threw off, and fired in upon the rebels who were in the upper room, and even then refused quarter. At the same time, another file of musketeers got up the stairs, and having shot down the door, entered upon them. <num value="6">Six</num> of them were killed before, another wounded, and <num value="1">one</num> refusing quarter, was knocked down, and afterwards shot. The others being asked why they had not begged quarter before, answered they durst not, for fear their own fellows should shoot them.</QUOTE>

<p>The upshot of this insane revolt of a handful of men was that <num value="22">twenty-two</num> kings men were killed, and <num value="22">twenty-two</num> of the fanatics, proving the fighting to have been hard. <num value="20">Twenty</num> were taken, and <num value="9">nine</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> hung, drawn, and quartered. Venner, the leader, who was wounded severely, and some others, were drawn on sledges, their quarters were set on the <num value="4">four</num> gates, and their heads stuck on poles on London Bridge. <num value="2">Two</num> more were hung at the west end of St. Paul's, <num value="2">two</num> at the Royal Exchange, <num value="2">two</num> at the Bull and Mouth, <num value="2">two</num> in Beech Lane, <num value="1">one</num> at Bishopsgate, and another, captured later, was hung at Tyburn, and his head set on a pole in Whitechapel.

<p>The old Goldsmiths' Church of St. John Zachary, Maiden Lane, destroyed in the Great Fire, and not rebuilt, stood at the north-west corner of Maiden Lane, in the Ward of Aldersgate; the parish is annexed to that of St. Anne. Among other epitaphs in this church, Stow gives the following:--

<p>The site of Haberdashers' Hall, in Maiden Lane, opposite Goldsmiths' Hall, was bequeathed to the Company by William Baker, a London haberdasher, in <datestruct value="1478--"><year reg="1478">1478</year></datestruct> (Edward IV.). In the old hall, destroyed by the Great Fire, the Parliament <pb id="p.372" n="372"> Commissioners held their meetings during the Commonwealth, and many a stern decree of confiscation was there grimly signed. In this hall there are some good portraits.

<p>The haberdashers were originally a branch of the mercers, dealing like them in merceries or small wares.

The Company's original bye-laws having been <pb id="p.374" n="374"> burnt in the Great Fire, a new code was drawn up, which in <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct> was sanctioned by Lord Chancellor Finch, Sir Matthew Hale, and Sir Francis North.
<p>The dining-hall is a lofty and spacious room. About <num value="10">ten</num> years since it was much injured by fire, but has been since restored and handsomely decorated.

<P>In Milk Street was the milk-market of Mediaeval London. That good and wise man, Sir Thomas More, was born in this street. <QUOTE>The brightest man,</QUOTE> says Fuller, with his usual quaint playfulness, <QUOTE>that ever shone in that <foreign lang=la>via lactea</foreign>.</QUOTE> More, born in <datestruct value="1480--"><year reg="1480">1480</year></datestruct>, was the son of a judge of the King's Bench, and was educated at St. Anthony's School, in Threadneedle Street. He was afterwards placed in the family of Archbishop Morton, till he went to Oxford. After <num value="2">two</num> years he became a barrister, at Lincoln, entered Parliament, and opposed Henry VII. to his own danger. After serving as law reader at New Inn, he soon became an eminent lawyer. He then wrote his <title>Utopia,</title>
acquired the friendship of Erasmus, and soon after became a favourite of Henry VIII., helping the despot in his treatise against Luther. On Wolsey's disgrace, More became chancellor, and <num value="1">one</num> of the wisest andmost impartial England has ever known. Determined not to sanction the king's divorce, More resigned his chancellorship, and, refusing to attend Anne Boleyn's coronation, he was attainted for treason. The tyrant, now furious, soon hurried him to the scaffold, and he was executed on Tower Hill in <datestruct value="1535--"><year reg="1535">1535</year></datestruct>.
<p>This pious, wise, and consistent man is described <pb id="p.375" n="375"> as having dark chestnut hair, thin beard, and grey eyes. He walked with his right shoulder raised, and was negligent in his dress. When in the Tower, ore is said to have foreseen the fate of Anne Boleyn, whom his daughter Margaret had found filling the court with dancing and sporting.
<p> <QUOTE>Alas, Meg,</QUOTE> said the ex-chancellor, <QUOTE>it pitieth me to remember to what misery poor soul she will shortly come. These dances of hers will prove such dances that she will sport our heads off like foot-balls; but it will not be long ere her head will dance the like dance.</QUOTE>
<p>It is to be lamented that with all his wisdom, ore was a bigot. He burnt <num value="1">one</num> Frith for denying the corporeal presence; had James Bainton, a gentleman of the Temple, whipped in his presence for heretical opinons; went to the Tower to see him on the rack, and then hurried him to Smithfield. <QUOTE>Verily,</QUOTE> said Luther, <QUOTE>he was a very notable tyrant, and plagued and tormented innocent Christians like an executioner.</QUOTE>

<p>In Ironmonger Lane, inhabited by ironmongers
 <abbr expan="tempore" lang=la>temp.</abbr> Edward I., is
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.376.1">Mercers' Hall</lemma> an interesting building.
<p>The Mercers, though not formally incorporated till the <num value="17">17th</num> of Richard II. (<datestruct value="1393--"><year reg="1393">1393</year></datestruct>), are traced back by Herbert as early as <datestruct value="1172"><year reg="1172">1172</year></datestruct>. Soon afterwards <pb id="p.377" n="377"> they are mentioned as patrons of <num value="1">one</num> of the great London charities. In <datestruct value="1214--"><year reg="1214">1214</year></datestruct>, Robert Spencer, a mercer, was mayor. In <datestruct value="1296--"><year reg="1296">1296</year></datestruct> the mercers joined the company of merchant adventurers in establishing in Edward I.'s reign, a woollen manufacture in England, with a branch at Antwerp. In Edward II.'s reign they are mentioned as <QUOTE>the fraternity of Mercers,</QUOTE> and in <datestruct value="1406--"><year reg="1406">1406</year></datestruct> (Henry I.) they are styled in a charter, <QUOTE>Brothers of St. Thomas &agrave; Becket.</QUOTE>
<p>Mercers were at <num value="1">first</num> general dealers in all small wares, including wigs, haberdashery, and even spices and drugs. They attended fairs and markets, and even sat on the ground to sell their wares--in fact, were little more than high-class pedlers. The poet Tower talks of <QUOTE>the depression of such mercerie.</QUOTE> In late times the silk trade formed the main feature of their business; the greater use of silk beginning about <datestruct value="1573--"><year reg="1573">1573</year></datestruct>.
<p>The mercers' <num value="1">first</num> station, in Henry II.'s reign, was in that part of Cheap on the north side where Mercers' Hall now stands but they removed <hi rend=italics>soon</hi>
afterwards higher up on the south side. The part of Cheapside between Bow Church and Friday Street became known as the Mercery. Here, in front of a large meadow called the <QUOTE>Crownsild,</QUOTE> they held their little stalls or standings from Soper's Lane and the Standard. There were no houses as yet in this part of Cheapside. In <datestruct value="1329--"><year reg="1329">1329</year></datestruct> William Elsing, a mercer, founded an hospital within Cripplegate; for <num value="100">100</num> poor blind men, and became prior of his own institution.
<p>In <datestruct value="1351--"><year reg="1351">1351</year></datestruct> (Edward III.), the Mercers grew jealous of the Lombard merchants, and on Midsummer Day <num value="3">three</num> mercers were sent to the Tower for attacking <num value="2">two</num> Lombards in the Old Jewry. The mercers in this reign sold woollen clothes, but not silks. In <datestruct value="1371--"><year reg="1371">1371</year></datestruct>, John Barnes, mercer, mayor, gave a chest with <num value="3">three</num> locks, with <measure value="1000bmark" type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num> marks</measure> therein, to be lent to younger mercers, upon sufficient pawn and for the use thereof. The grateful recipients were merely to say <QUOTE>De Profundis,</QUOTE> a Pater Noster, and no more. This bequest seems to have started among the Mercers the kindly practice of assisting the young and struggling members of this Company.
<p>In the reign of Henry VI. the mercers had become great dealers in silks and velvets, and had resigned to the haberdashers the sale of small articles of dress. It is not known whether the mercers bought their silks from the Lombards, or the London silk-women, or whether they imported them themselves, since many of the members of the Company were merchants.
<p><num value="20">Twenty</num> years after the murder of Becket, the murdered man's sister, who had married Thomas
<p>Fitz Theobald de Helles, built a chapel and hospital of Augustine Friars close to Ironmonger Lane, Cheapside. The hospital was built on the site of the house where Becket was born. He was the son of Gilbert Becket, citizen, mercer and portreve of London, who was said to have been a Crusader, and. to have married a fair Saracen, who had released him from prison, and who followed him to London, knowing only the <num value="1">one</num> English word <QUOTE>Gilbert.</QUOTE> The hospital, which was called <QUOTE>St. Thomas of Acon,</QUOTE> from Becket's mother having been born at Acre, the ancient Ptolemais, was given to the Mercers' Fraternity by De Hilles and his wife, and Henry III, gave the master and <num value="12">twelve</num> brothers all the land between St. Olave's and Ironmonger Lane, which had belonged to <num value="2">two</num> rich Jews, to enlarge their ground. In Henry V.'s reign that illustrious mercer Whittington, by his wealth and charity, reflected great lustre on the Mercers' Company, who at his death were left trustees of the college and almshouses founded by the immortal Richard on College Hill. The Company still preserve the original ordinance of this charity with a curious picture of Whittington's death, and of the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="3">three</num> wardens, Coventry, Grove, and Carpenter.
<P>In <datestruct value="1414--"><year reg="1414">1414</year></datestruct>, Thomas Falconer, mercer and mayor, lent Henry V., towards his French wars, <measure value="10bmark" type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> marks</measure> upon jewels.
<P>In <datestruct value="1513--"><year reg="1513">1513</year></datestruct>, Joan Bradbury, widow of Thomas Bradbury, late Lord Mayor of London, left the Conduit Mead (now New Bond Street), to the Mercers' Company for charitable uses. In pursuance of the King's grant on this occasion, the Bishop of Norwich and others granted the Mercers' Company <num value="29">29</num> acres of land in Marylebone, <num value="120">120</num> acres in Westminster, and St. Giles, and St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, of the annual value of <measure value="113l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="113">113</num></measure> <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure>, and in part satisfaction of the said <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> a year.

The Mercers prudently bowed before the storm, promised reform, and begged her Majesty's Council to look after the Grocers. At this time the chief vendors of <pb id="p.378" n="378"> Italian silks lived inCheapside, St. Lawrence Jewry, and Old Jewry.
<p>During the civil wars both King and Parliament bore heavily on the Mercers. In <datestruct value="1640--"><year reg="1640">1640</year></datestruct> Charles I. half forced from them a loan of <measure value="3030l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3030">3,030</num></measure>, and in <datestruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct> the Parliament borrowed <measure value="6500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6500">6,500</num></measure>, and arms from the Company's armoury, valued at <measure value="88l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="88">88</num></measure>.

The result now became visible. In <datestruct value="1698--"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>, hoping to clear off their debts, the Mercers' Company engaged in a ruinous insurance scheme, suggested by Dr. Assheton, a Kentish rector.

<p>The Mercers' operations soon gave rise to more <pb id="p.379" n="379"> business-like companies, specially created to secure the public against some of the calamitous consequences of death. In <datestruct value="1706--"><year reg="1706">1706</year></datestruct>, the Amicable Life Assurance Office-usually, though, as the reader has seen, incorrectly, termed the <num value="1">First</num> Life Insur- Dance Office--was established in imitation of the Mercers' Office. <num value="2">Two</num> years later, the <num value="2">Second</num> Society of Assurance, for the support of widows and orphans, was opened in Dublin, which, like the Amicable, introduced numerous improvements upon Dr. Assheton's scheme, and was a Joint-Stock Life Assurance Society, identical in its principles with, and similar in most of its details to, the modern insurance companies, of which there were as many as <num value="160">one hundred and sixty</num> in the year <datestruct value="1859"><year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE>

<p>Large sums were subscribed, but the annuities
<FIGURE id="Fig.379" n="2000.06.0136"><HEAD>City Of London School.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 were fixed too high, and the Company had to sink to <num value="18">18</num> per cent., and even this proved an insufficient reduction. In <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct> they were compelled to stop, and, after several ineffectual struggles, to petition Parliament.
<p>The petition showed that the Mercers were indebted more than <measure value="100000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure>. The annuities then out amounted to <measure value="7620l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="7620">7,620</num></measure> per annum, and the subscriptions forfuture amounts reached <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> a year; while to answer these claims their present income only amounted to <measure value="4100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4100">4,100</num></measure> per annum. The Company was therefore empowered by Act of Parliament, <num value="4">4</num> George III., to issue new bonds and pay them off by a lottery, drawn in their own hall.

<p>Mercers' Hall and Chapel have a history of their own.

Immediately behind the great doors of the hospital and Mercers' Hall stood the hospital church of St. Thomas, and at the back were court-yards, cloisters, and gardens in a great wide enclosure east and west of Ironmonger Lane and the Old Jewry.
<p>St. Thomas's Church was a large structure, probably rich in monuments, though many of the illustrious mercers were buried in Bow Church, St. Pancras, Soper Lane, St. Antholin's, Watling Street, and St. Benet Sherehog. The church was bought chiefly by Sir Richard Gresham's influence, and Stow tells us <QUOTE>it is now called Mercers' Chappell, and therein is kept a free grammar school as of old time had been accustomed.</QUOTE> The original Mercers' Chapel was a chapel toward the street in front of the <QUOTE>great old chapel of St. Thomas,</QUOTE> and over it was Mercers' Hall.

Grey, the founder of the hospital, was apprenticed to a bookseller who occupied <num value="1">one</num> of these shops, and after the Fire of London he himself carried on the same trade in a'shop which was built on the same site. Before the suppression, the Mercers only occupied a shop of the present front, the modern Mercers' Chapel standing, says Herbert, exactly on the site of part of the hospital church.
<p>The old hospital gate, which forms the present hospital entrance, had an image of St. Thomas A Becket, but this was pulled down by Elizabethan fanatics. The interior of the chapel remains unaltered. There is a large ambulatory before it supported by columns, and a stone staircase leads to the hall and court-rooms. The ambulatory contains the

<p>Many eminent citizens were buried in St. Thomas's, though most of the monuments had been defaced even in Stow's time.

<p>Previous to the suppression; Henry VIII. had permitted the Hospital of St. Thomas of Acon, which wanted room, to throw a gallery across Old Jewry into a garden which the master had purchased, adjoining the Grocers' Hall, and in which Sir Robert Clayton afterwards built a house, of which we shall have to speak in its place. The gallery was to have <num value="2">two</num> windows, and in the winter a light was ordered to be burned there for the comfort of passers-by.

The Mercers' School was <num value="1">first</num> held in the hospital and then removed to the mercery.
<p>The present chapel front in Cheapside is the central part alone of the front built after the Great Fire. Correspondent houses, <num value="5">five</num> storeys high, formerly gave breadth and effect to the whole mass. <pb id="p.381" n="381"> Old views represent shops on each side with unsashed windows. The <num value="1">first</num> floors have stone balconies, and over the central window of each room is the bust of a crowned virgin. It has a large doorcase, enriched with <num value="2">two</num> genii above, in the act of mantling the Virgin's head, the Company's cognomen displayed upon the keystone of the arch. Above is a cornice, with brackets, sustaining a small gallery, from which, on each side, arise Doric pilasters, supporting an entablature of the same order; between the intercolumns and the central window are the figures of Faith and Hope, in niches, between whom, in a <num value="3">third</num> niche of the entablature, is Charity, sitting with her <num value="3">three</num> children. The upper storey has circular windows and other enrichments.
<p>The entrance most used is in Ironmonger Lane, where is a small court, with offices, apparently the site of the ancient cloister, and which leads to the principal building. The hall itself is elevated as anciently, and supported by Doric columns, the space below being open <num value="1">one</num> side and forming an extensive piazza, at the extremity whereof is the chapel, which is neatly planned, wainscoted, and paved with black and white marble. A high flight of stairs leads from the piazza to the hall, which is a very lofty apartment; handsomely wainscoted and ornamented with Doric pilasters, and various carvings in compartments.
<P>In the hall, besides the transaction of the Company's business, the Gresham committees are held, which consist of <num value="4">four</num> aldermen, including the Lord Mayor <foreign lang=la>pro tempore</foreign>, and <num value="8">eight</num> of the City corporation, with whom are associated a select number of the assistants of the Mercers. In this hall also the British Fishery Society, and other corporate bodies, were formerly accustomed to hold their meetings.
<p>The chief portraits in the hall are those of Sir Thomas Gresham (original), a fanciful portrait of Sir Richard Whittington, a likeness of Count Tekeli (the hero of the old opera), Count Panington; Dean Colet (the illustrious friend of Erasmus, and the founder of St. Paul's school); Thomas Papillon, Master of the Company in <datestruct value="1698--"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>, who left <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> to the Company, to relieve any of his family that ever came to want; and Rowland Wynnes Master of the Company in <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>. Wynne gave <measure value="400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="400">400</num></measure> towards the repairing of the hall after the Great Fire.
<p>In Strype's time (<datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>), the Mercers' Company gave away <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure> a year in charity. In <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct> the Company's money legacies amounted to <measure value="21699l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="21699">21,699</num></measure> <measure value="5s. 9d." type=Currency><num value="5">5</num>s. <num value="9">9</num>d.</measure>, out of which the Company paid annually  <measure value="573l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="573">573</num></measure> <measure value="17s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="17">17</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> In <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>, the lapsed legacies of the Company became the subject of a Chancery suit; the result was that money is now lent to liverymen or freemen of the Company requiring assistance in sums of <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>, and not exceeding <num value="500">500</num>, for a term, without interest, but only upon approved security.
<p>The present Mercers' School, which is but lately finished, is a very elegant stone structure, adjoining St. Michael's Church, College Hill, on the site of Whittington's Almshouses, which had been removed to Highgate to make room for it.
<p>The school scholarship is in the gift of the Mercers' Company, and it must not be forgotten that Caxton, the <num value="1">first</num> great English printer, was a member of this livery.
<p>Subsequently to the Great Fire, says Herbert, there was some discussion with Parliament on rebuilding the Mercers' School on the former site of St. Mary Colechurch. That site, however, was ultimately rejected, and by the Rebuilding Act, <num value="22">22</num> Charles II. (<datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>), it was expressly provided that there should be a plot of ground, on the western side of the Old Jewry, <QUOTE>set apart for the Mercers' School.</QUOTE> Persons who remember the building, says Herbert, describe it whilst here as an oldfashioned house for the masters' residence, with projecting upper storeys, a low, spacious building by the side of it for the schoolroom, and an area behind it for a playground, the-whole being situate on the west side of the Old Jewry, about <num value="40">forty</num> yards from Cheapside.
<p>The great value of ground on the above spot, and a desire to widen, as at present, the entrance to the Old Jewry, occasioned the temporary removal of the Mercers' School, in <datestruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></datestruct>, to No. <num value="13">13</num>, Budge Row, about <num value="30">thirty</num> yards from Dowgate Hill (a house of the Company's, which was afterwards burnt down). In <datestruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct> it was again temporarily removed, to No. <num value="20">20</num>, Red Lion Court, Watling Street; and from thence, in <datestruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></datestruct>, to its present situation on College Hill. The latter premises were hired by the Company, at the rent of. <measure value="120l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="120">120</num></measure>, and the average expense of the school was  <measure value="677l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="677">677</num></measure> <measure value="1s. 1d." type=Currency><num value="1">1</num>s. <num value="1">1</num>d.</measure> The salary of the master is <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure>, and <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure> gratuity, with a house to live in, rent and taxes free Writing, arithmetic, and merchant's accounts were added to the Greek and Latin classics, in <datestruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct>; and a writing-master was engaged, who has a salary of <measure value="120l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="120">120</num></measure>, and a gratuity of <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure>, but no house. There are <num value="2">two</num> exhibitions belonging to the school.
<p>With the Mercers' Hospital, in the Middle Ages, many curious old City customs were connected. The customary devotions of the new Lord Mayor, at St. Thomas of Acon Church, in the Catholic times, <pb id="p.382" n="382"> identify themselves in point of locality with the Mercers' Company, and are to be ranked amongst that Company's observances. Strype has described these, from an ancient MS. he met with on the subject. The new Lord Mayor, it states, <QUOTE><hi rend=italics>after dinner</hi>,</QUOTE> on his inauguration day (the ceremony would have suited much better <hi rend=italics>before</hi> dinner in modern days), <QUOTE>was wont to go from his house to the Church of St. Thomas of Acon, those of his livery going before him; and the aldermen in like manner being there met together, they came to the Church of St. Paul, whither, when they were come, namely, in the middle place between the body of the church, between <num value="2">two</num> little doors, they were wont to pray for the soul of the Bishop of London. William Norman, who was a great benefactor to the City, in obtaining the confirmation of their liberties from William the Conqueror, a priest saying the office <foreign lang=la>De Profundis</foreign> (called a dirge); and from thence they passed to the churchyard, where Thomas &agrave; Becket's parents were buried, and there, near their tomb, they said also, for all the faithful deceased, <foreign lang=la>De Profundis</foreign> again. The City procession thence returned through Cheapside Market, sometimes with wax candles burning (if it was late), to the said Church Sanctas Thomae, and there the mayor and aldermen offered single pence, which being done, every <num value="1">one</num> went to his home.</QUOTE>
<p>On all saints' days, and various other festivals, the mayor with his family attended at this same Church of St. Thomas, and the aldermen also, and those that were <QUOTE>of the livery of the mayor, with the honest men of the mysteries,</QUOTE> in their several habits, or suits, from which they went to St. Paul's to hear vespers. On the Feast of Innocents they heard vespers at St. Thomas's, and on the morrow mass and vespers.
<p>The Mercers' election cup, says Timbs, of early <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century work, was silver-gilt, decorated with fret-work and female busts; the feet, flasks; and on the cover is the popular legend of an unicorn yielding its horn to a maiden. The whole is enamelled with coats of arms, and these lines-
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>To elect the Master of the Mercerie hither am I sent,
<L>And by Sir Thomas Leigh for the same intent.</QUOTE>

<p>The Company also possess a silver-gilt wagon and tun, covered with arabesques and enamels, of <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century work. The hall was originally decorated with carvings; the main stem of deal, the fruit, flowers, &amp;c., of lime, pear, and beech. These becoming worm-eaten, were long since removed from the panelling and put aside; but they have been restored by Mr. Henry Crace, who thus describes the process:--
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>The carving is of the same colour as when taken down. I merely washed it, and with a gimlet bored a number of holes in the back, and into every projecting piece of fruit and leaves on the face, and placing the whole in a long trough, <num value="15">fifteen</num> inches deep, I covered it with a solution prepared in the following manner :--I took <num value="16">sixteen</num> gallons of linseed oil, with <num value="2">2</num> lbs. of litharge, finely ground, i lb. of camphor, and <num value="2">2</num> lbs. of red lead, which I boiled for <num value="6">six</num> hours, keeping it stirred, that every ingredient might be perfectly incorporated. I then dissolved <num value="6">6</num> lbs. of bees'-wax in a gallon of spirits of turpentine, and mixed the whole, while warm, thoroughly together.
<p>In this solution the carving remained for twentyfour hours. When taken out, I kept the face downwards, that the oil might soak down to the face of the carving; and on cutting some of the wood nearly <num value="9">nine</num> inches deep, I found it had soaked through, for not any of the dust was blown out, as I considered it a valuable medium to form a substance for the future support of the wood. This has been accomplished, and, as the dust became saturated with the oil, it increased in bulk, and rendered the carving perfectly solid.</QUOTE>

<p>The Company is now governed by a master, <num value="3">three</num> wardens, and a court of <num value="31">thirty-one</num> or more assistants. The livery fine is <measure value="53s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="53">53</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> The Mercers' Company, though not by any means the most ancient of the leading City companies, takes precedence of all. Such anomalous institutions are the City companies, that, curious to relate, the present body hardly includes <num value="1">one</num> mercer among them. In Henry VIII.'s reign the Company (freemen, householders, and livery) amounted to <num value="53">fifty-three</num> persons; in <datestruct value="1701--"><year reg="1701">1701</year></datestruct> it had almost quadrupled. Strype (<datestruct value="1754--"><year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct>) only enumerates <num value="52">fifty-two</num> mayors who had been mercers, from <datestruct value="1214--"><year reg="1214">1214</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1701--"><year reg="1701">1701</year></datestruct>; this is below the mark. Halkins over-estimates the mercer mayors as <num value="98">ninety-eight</num> up to <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>. Few monarchs have been mercers,yet Richard II. was a free brother, and Queen Elizabeth a free sister.
<p>Half our moder nobility have sprung from the trades they now despise. Many of the great mercers became the founders of noble houses; for instance-Sir John Coventry (<datestruct value="1425--"><year reg="1425">1425</year></datestruct>), ancestor of the present Earl of Coventry; Sir Geoffrey Bullen, grandfather of Queen Elizabeth; Sir William Hollis, ancestor of the Earls of Clare. From Sir Richard Dormer (<datestruct value="1542--"><year reg="1542">1542</year></datestruct>) sprang the Lords Dormer; from Sir Thomas Baldry (<datestruct value="1523--"><year reg="1523">1523</year></datestruct>) the Lords Kensington (Rich); from Sir Thomas Seymour (<datestruct value="1527--"><year reg="1527">1527</year></datestruct>) the Dukes of Somerset; from Sir Baptist Hicks, the great mercer of James I., who built Hicks' Hall, on Clerkenwell Green, sprang the Viscounts Camden;

 <pb id="p.383" n="383"> from Sir Rowland Hill, the Lords Hill; from James Butler (Henry II.) the Earls of Ormond; from Sir Geoffrey Fielding, Privy Councillor to Henry II. and Richard I., the Earls of Denbigh.
<p>The costume of the Mercers became fixed about the reign of Charles I. The master and wardens led the civic processions, <QUOTE>faced in furs,</QUOTE> with the lords; the livery followed in gowns faced with satins, the livery of all other Companies wearing facings of fringe.
<p> <QUOTE>In Ironmonger Lane,</QUOTE> says Stow, giving us a glimpse of old London, <QUOTE>is the small parish church of St. Martin, called Pomary, upon what occasion certainly I know not; but it is supposed to be of apples growing where now houses are lately builded, for myself have seen the large void places there.</QUOTE> he church was repaired in the year <datestruct value="1629"><year reg="1629">1629</year></datestruct>.

<P>The Guildhall--the mean-looking Hotel de Ville of London---was originally (says Stow) situated more to the east side of Aldermanbury, to which it gave name. Richard de Reynere, a sheriff in the reign of Richard I, (<datestruct value="1189--"><year reg="1189">1189</year></datestruct>), gave to the church of St. Mary, at <num value="0">0</num>sney, near Oxford, certain ground rents in Aldenmanbury, as appears by an entry in the Register of the Court of Hustings of the Guildhall. In Stow's time the Aldermanbury hall had been turned into a carpenter's yard.
<p>
The present Guildhall (which the meanest Flemish city would despise) was <QUOTE>builded new,</QUOTE> whatever that might imply, according to our venerable guide, in <datestruct value="1411--"><year reg="1411">1411</year></datestruct> (<num value="12">12th</num> of Henry IV.), by Thomas Knoles, the mayor, and his brethren the aldermen, and <QUOTE>from a little cottage it grew into a great house.</QUOTE> The expenses were defrayed by benevolences, from the City Companies, and <num value="10">ten</num> years' fees, fines, and amercements. Henry V. granted the City free passages for <num value="4">four</num> boats and <num value="4">four</num> carts, to bring lime, ragstone, and freestone for the works. In the <num value="1">first</num> year of Henry VI., when the citizens were every day growing richer and more powerful, the illustrious Whittington's executors gave <measure value="35l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="35">35</num></measure> to pave the Great Hall with Purbeck stone. They also blazoned some of the windows of the hall, and the Mayor's Court, with Whittington's escutcheons.
<p>A few years afterwards <num value="1">one</num> of the porches, the Mayor's Chamber, and the Council Chamber were built. In <datestruct value="1501--"><year reg="1501">1501</year></datestruct> (Henry VII.), Sir John Shaw, mayor, knighted on Bosworth Field, built the kitchens, since which time the City feasts, before that held at Merchant Taylors' and Grocers' Hall, were annually held here. In <datestruct value="1505--"><year reg="1505">1505</year></datestruct>, Sir Nicholas Alwin, mayor in <datestruct value="1499--"><year reg="1499">1499</year></datestruct>, left <measure value="73l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="73">73</num></measure> <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> to purchase tapestry for <QUOTE>gaudy</QUOTE> days at the Guildhall. In <datestruct value="1614--"><year reg="1614">1614</year></datestruct> a new Council Chamber, with a <num value="2">second</num> room over it, was erected, at an outlay of <num value="1740">1,740</num>.
<p>In the Great Fire, when all the roofs and outbuildings were destroyed, an eye-witness describes Guildhall itself still standing firm, probably because it was framed with solid oak.
<p>Mr. Vincent, a minister, in his <title>God's Terrible Voice in the City,</title> printed in the year <datestruct value="1667"><year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>, says: <QUOTE>And amongst other things that night, the sight of Guildhall was a fearful spectacle, which stood the whole body of it together in view for several hours together, after the fire had taken it, without flames (I suppose because the timber was such solid oake), like a bright shining coal, as if it had been a palace of gold, or a great building of burnished brass.</QUOTE>
<p>Pepys has some curious notes about the new Guildhall.
<p> <QUOTE>Sir Richard Ford,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>tells me, speaking of the new street</QUOTE> --the present King Street- <QUOTE>that is to be made from Guildhall down to Cheapside, that the ground is already, most of it, bought; and tells me of <num value="1">one</num>. particular, of a man that hath a piece of ground lying in the very middle of the street that must be; which, when the street is cut out of it, <pb id="p.384" n="384"> there will remain ground enough of each side to build a house to front the street. He demanded <measure value="700l." type=currency><num value="700">seven hundred</num> pounds</measure> for the ground, and to be excused paying anything for the melioration of the rest of his ground that he was to keep. The Court consented to give him <measure value="700l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="700">700</num></measure>, only not to abate him the consideration, which the man denied; but told them, and so they agreed, that he would excuse the City the <measure value="700l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="700">700</num></measure>, that he might have the benefit of the melioration without paying anything for it. So much some will get by having the City burned. Ground, by this means, that was not fourpence a foot afore, will now, when houses are built, be worth <measure value="15s." type=currency><num value="15">fifteen</num> shillings</measure> a foot.</QUOTE>
<p>In the <title>Calendar of State Papers </title> (Charles II., <datestruct VALUE="1667-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>), we find notice that <QUOTE>the Committee of the Common Council of London for making the new street called King Street, between Guildhall and Cheapside, will sit twice a week at Guildhall, to treat with persons concerned; enquiry to be made by jury, according to the Act for Rebuilding the City, of the value of land of such persons as refuse to appear.</QUOTE>
<p>The Great Hall is <num value="153">153</num> feet long, <num value="50">50</num> feet broad, and about <num value="55">55</num> feet high. The interior sides, in
<FIGURE id="Fig.384" n="2000.06.0138"><HEAD>Mercers' Chapel, As Rebuilt After The Fire. (From An Old Print.) (See Page <num value="381">381</num>.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct>, were divided into <num value="8">eight</num> portions by projecting clusters of columns. Above the dados were <num value="2">two</num> windows of the meanest and most debased Gothic. Several of the large windows were blocked up with tasteless monuments. The blockings of the friezes were sculptured; large guideron shields were blazoned with the arms of the principal City companies. The old mediaeval open timber-work roof had been swallowed up by the Great Fire, and in lieu of it there was a poor attic storey, and a flat panelled ceiling, by some attributed to Wren. At each end of the hall was a large pointed window; the east <num value="1">one</num> blazoned with the royal arms, and the stars and jewels of the English orders of knighthood; the west with the City arms and supporters. At the east end of the hall (the ancient dais) was a raised enclosed platform, for holding the Court of Hustings and taking the poll at elections, and other purposes. The panelled wainscoting (in the old churchwarden taste) was separated into compartments by fluted Corinthian pilasters. Over these was a range of ancient canopied niches in carved stone, vulgarly imitated by modern work on the west side. Our old friends Gog and Magog, before Dance's <hi rend=italics>improvements</hi>, stood on brackets adjoining <pb id="p.385" n="385"> a balcony over the entrance to the interior courts, and were removed to brackets on each side the great west window.
<p>Stow describes the statues over the great south porch of King Henry VI.'s time as bearing the following emblems: the tables of the Commandments, a whip, a sword, and a pot. By their ancient habits and the coronets on their heads, he presumed them to be the statues of benefactors of London. The statue of our Saviour had disappeared, but the <num value="2">two</num> bearded figures remaining, he conjectured, were good Bishop William and the Conqueror himself. <num value="4">Four</num> lesser figures, <num value="2">two</num> on each side the porch, seemed to be noble and pious ladies, <num value="1">one</num> of them probably the Empress Maud, another the good Queen Philippa, who once interceded for the City. These figures were taken down during Dance's injudicious alterations in <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>. They lay neglected in a cellar until Alderman Boydell obtained leave of the Corporation to give them to Banks, the sculptor, who had taste enough to appreciate the simple earnestness of the Gothic work. At his death they were given again to the City. These figures were removed from the old screen in <datestruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></datestruct>, and were not replaced in the new <num value="1">one</num>.

<p>Stow, in relation to the Guildhall statues, and to the general demolition of <QUOTE>images</QUOTE> that occurred in his time, states, <QUOTE>these verses following</QUOTE> were made about <datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>, by William Elderton, an attorney in the Sheriff's Court at Guildhall:--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Though most the Images be pulled downe,

<P>The true renovation of this great City hall commenced in the year <datestruct value="1864"><year reg="1864">1864</year></datestruct>, when Mr. Horace Jones, the architect to the City of London, was entrusted with the erection of an open oak roof, with a central louvre and tapering metal spire. The new roof is as nearly as possible framed to resemble the roof destroyed in the Great Fire. Many southern <pb id="p.386" n="386"> windows have been re-opened, and layer after layer of plaster and cement scraped from the internal architectural ornamentation. The southern windows have been fitted with stained glass, designed by Mr. F. Halliday, the subjects being-the grant of the Charter, coining money, the death of Wat Tyler, a royal tournament, &amp;c.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.386.1">The fine crypt under the Guildhall</lemma> was, till its restoration in the year <datestruct value="1851"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>, a mere receptacle for the planks, benches, and trestles used at the City banquets.
<p> <QUOTE>This crypt is by far the finest and most extensive undercroft remaining in London, and is a true portion of the ancient hall (erected in <datestruct value="1411--"><year reg="1411">1411</year></datestruct>) which escaped the Great Fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>. It extends half the length beneath the Guildhall, from east to west, and is divided nearly equally by a wall, having an ancient pointed door. The crypt is divided into aisles by clustered columns, from which spring the stone-ribbed groins of the vaulting, composed partly of chalk and stone, the principal intersections being covered with carved bosses of flowers, heads, and shields. The north and south aisles had formerly mullioned windows, long walled up. At the eastern end is a fine Early English arched entrance, in fair preservation; and in the southeastern angle is an octangular recess, which formerly was ceiled by an elegantly groined roof, height <num value="13">thirteen</num> feet. The vaulting, with <num value="4">four</num> centred arches, is very striking, and is probably some of the earliest of the sort, which seems peculiar to this country. Though called the Tudor arch, the time of its introduction was Lancastrian (see Weale's  <Q>London,</Q>  p. <num value="159">159</num>). In <datestruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct> the stone-work was rubbed down and cleaned, and the clustered shafts and capitals were repaired; and on the visit of Queen Victoria to Guildhall, <datestruct VALUE="1851-07-9"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=9>9</day>, <year reg=1851>1851</year></datestruct>, a banquet was served to her Majesty and suite in this crypt, which was characteristically decorated for the occasion. Opposite the north entrance is a large antique bowl of Egyptian red granite, which was presented to the Corporation by Major Cookson, in <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, as a memorial of the British achievements in Egypt.</QUOTE> (Timbs.)
<p> <QUOTE>There was something very picturesque,</QUOTE> says
<p>Brayley, <QUOTE>in the old Guildhall entrance. On each side of the flight of steps was an octangular turreted gallery, balustraded, having an office in each, appropriated to the hall-keeper; these galleries assumed the appearance of arbours, from being each surrounded by <num value="6">six</num> palm-trees in iron-work, the foliage of which gave support to a large balcony, having in front a clock (with <num value="3">three</num> dials) elaborately ornamented, and underneath a representation of the sun, resplendent with gilding; the clock-frame was of oak. At the angles were the cardinal virtues, and on the top a curious figure of Time, with a young child in his arms. On brackets to the right and left of the balcony were the gigantic figures of Gog and Magog, as beforemen- tioned, giving, by their. vast size and singular costume, an unique character to the whole. At the sides of the steps, under the hall-keeper's office, were <num value="2">two</num> dark cells, or cages, in which unruly apprentices were occasionally confined, by order of the City Chamberlain; these were called  <Q>Little Ease,</Q>  from not being of sufficient height for a big boy to stand upright in them.</QUOTE>
<p>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.386.2">The Gog and Magog</lemma>, those honest giants of Guildhall who have looked down on many a good dinner with imperturbable self-denial, have been the unconscious occasion of much inkshed. Who did they represent, and were they really carried about in Lord Mayor's Shows, was discussed by many generations of angry antiquaries. In Strype's time, when there were pictures of Queen Anne, King William and his consort Mary, at the east end of the hall, the <num value="2">two</num> pantomime giants of renown stood by the steps going up to the Mayor's Court. The <num value="1">one</num> holding a poleaxe with a spiked ball, Strype considered, represented a Briton; the other, with a halbert, he opined to be a Saxon. Both of them wore garlands. What was denied to great and learned was disclosed to the poor and simple. <num value="1">one</num>, the bookseller, or <num value="1">one</num> of his writers, came into possession of a little guide-book sold to visitors to the Guildhall in <datestruct value="1741--"><year reg="1741">1741</year></datestruct>; this set Mr. Fairholt, a most diligent antiquary, on the right track, and he soon settled the matter for ever Gog and Magog were really Corineus and Gogmagog. The former, a companion of Brutus the Trojan, killed, as the story goes, Gog-magog, the aboriginal giant.
<p>Our sketch of City pageants has already shown that <num value="200">two hundred</num> years ago giants named Corineus and Gogmagog (which ought to have put our antiquaries earlier on the right scent) formed part of the procession. In <datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct> Thomas Jordan, the City poet, in his own account of the ceremonial, especially mentions <num value="2">two</num> giants <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet high, in <num value="2">two</num> several chariots, <QUOTE>talking and

In <datestruct value="1706--"><year reg="1706">1706</year></datestruct> <num value="2">two</num> new and more solid giants of wood were carved for the City by Richard Saunders, a captain in the trained band, and a carver, in King Street, Cheapside. In <datestruct value="1837--"><year reg="1837">1837</year></datestruct>, Alderman Lucas being mayor, copies of these giants walked in the show, turning their great painted heads and goggling eyes, to the delight of the spectators. The Guildhall giants, as Mr. Fairholt has shown, with his usual honest industry, are mentioned by many of our early poets, dramatists, and writers, as Shirley, facetious Bishop Corbet, George Wither, and Ned Ward. In Hone's time City children visiting Guildhall used to be told that every day when the giants heard the clock strike <num value="12">twelve</num> they came down to dinner. Mr. Fairholt, in his <QUOTE>Gog and Magog</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></datestruct>), has shown by many examples how professional giants (protectors or destroyers of lives) are still common in the annual festivals of half the great towns of Flanders and of France.
<p>In the middle of the last century, says Mr. Fairholt, in his <title>Gog and Magog,</title> the Guildhall was occupied by shopkeepers, after the fashion of our bazaars; and <num value="1">one</num> Thomas Boreman, bookseller, <QUOTE>near the Giants, in Guildhall,</QUOTE> published, in <datestruct value="1741--"><year reg="1741">1741</year></datestruct>, <num value="2">two</num> very small volumes of their <QUOTE>gigantick history,</QUOTE> in which he tells us that as Corineus and Gogmagog were <num value="2">two</num> brave giants, who nicely valued their honour,.and exerted their whole strength and force in defence of their liberty and country, so the City of London, by placing these their representatives in their Guildhall, emblematically declare that they will, like mighty giants, defend the'honour of their country and liberties of this their city, which excels all others as rruch as those huge giants exceed in stature the common bulk of mankind.
<p>The author of this little volume then gives his version of the tale of the encounter, <QUOTE>wherein the giants were all destroyed, save Goemagog, the hugest among them, who, being in height <num value="12">twelve</num> cubits, was reserved alive, that Corineus might try his strength with him in single combat. Corineus desired nothing more than such a match; but the old giant, in a wrestle, caught him aloft and broke <num value="3">three</num> of his ribs. Upon this, Corineus, being desperately enraged, collected all his strength, heaved up Goemagog by main force, and bearing him on his shoulders to the next high rock, threw him headlong, all shattered, into the sea, and left his name on the cliff, which has ever since been called Lan-Goemagog, that is to say, the Giant's Leap. Thus perished Goemagog, commonly called Gogmagog, the last of the giants.</QUOTE>
<p>The early popularity of this tale is testified by its occurrence in the curious history of the Fitz- Warines, composed, in the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century, in Anglo-Norman, no doubt by a writer who resided on the Welsh border, and who, in describing a visit paid by William the Conqueror there, speaks of that sovereign asking the history of a burnt and ruined town, and an old Briton thus giving it him: -- <QUOTE>None inhabited these parts except very foul people, great giants, whose king was called Goemagog. These heard of the arrival of Brutus, and went out to encounter him, and at last all the giants were killed except Goemagog.</QUOTE>
<p>Dance's entrance to the courts was made exactly opposite the grand south entrance. <num value="4">Four</num> large tasteless cenotaphs, more fit for the Pantheon of London, St. Paul's, than for anywhere else, are erected in Guildhall--to the north, those of Beckford, the Earl of Clarendon, and Nelson; on the south, that of William Pitt.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.387.2">The monument to Beckford</lemma> the bold opposer of the arbitrary measures of a mistaken court and a misguided Parliament, is by Moore, a sculptor who lived in Berners Street. It represents the alderman in the act of delivering the celebrated speech which is engraved on the pedestal, and which, as Horace Walpole (who delighted in the mischief) says, made the king uncertain Whether to sit still and silent, or to pick up his robes and hurry into his private room.

If it were the custom to delay the erection of statues to eminent men <num value="20">twenty</num> years after their death, how many would ever be erected? The usual cold allegory, in this instance, is atoned for by some dignity of mind. The great earl (a Roman senator, of course), his left hand on a helm, is placing his right hand affectionately on the plump shoulders of Commerce, who, as a blushing young <hi rend=italics>debutante</hi>, is being presented to him by the City of London, who wears a mural crown, probably because London has no walls. In the foreground is the sculptor's everlasting Britannia, seated on her small but serviceable steed, the lion, <pb id="p.388" n="388"> and receiving into her capacious lap the contents of a cornucopia of Plenty, poured into it by <num value="4">four</num> children, who represent the <num value="4">four</num> quarters of the world.

To crown all this tame stuff there are some flags and trophies, and a pyramid, on which the City of London (female figure) is writing the words <QUOTE>Nile, Copenhagen, Trafalgar.</QUOTE> With admirable taste the sculptor, who knew what his female figures were, has turned the City of London with her back to the spectator. At the base of this absurd monument <num value="2">two</num> sailors watch over a bas-relief of the battle of Trafalgar, which certainly no <num value="1">one</num> of taste would steal.

<p>The Court of Aldermen is a richly-gilded room with a stucco ceiling, painted with allegorical figures of the hereditary virtues of the City of London- Justice, Prudence, Temperance, and Fortitudeby that over-rated painter, Hogarth's father-in-law, Sir James Thornhill, who was presented by the Corporation with a gold cup, value <measure value="225l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="225">225</num></measure> <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">7</num>s.</measure> In the cornices are emblazoned the arms of all the mayors since <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct> (the year of the Gordon riots). Each alderman's chair bears his name and arms.
<p>The apartment, says a writer in Knight's <title>London,</title> as its name tells us, is used for the sittings of the Court of Aldermen, who, in judicial matters, form the bench of magistrates for the City, and in their more directly corporate capacity try the validity of ward elections, and claims to freedom; who admit and swear brokers, superintend prisons, order prosecutions, and perform a variety of other analogous duties; a descent, certainly, from the high position of the ancient <QUOTE>ealdormen,</QUOTE> or superior Saxon nobility, from whom they derive their name and partly their functions. They were called <QUOTE>barons</QUOTE> down to the time of Henry I., if, as is probable, the latter term in the charter of that king refers to the aldermen. A striking proof of the high rank and importance of the individuals so designated is to be found in the circumstance that the wards of London of which they were aldermen were, in some cases at least, their own heritable property, and as such bought and sold and transferred under particular circumstances. Thus, the aldermanry of a ward was purchased, in <datestruct value="1279--"><year reg="1279">1279</year></datestruct>, by William Faryngdon, who gave it his own name, and in whose family it remained upwards of <num value="80">eighty</num> years; and in another case the Knighten Guild having given the lands and soke of what is now called Portsoken Ward to Trinity Priory, the prior became, in consequence, alderman, and so the matter remained in Stow's time, who beheld the prior of his day riding in procession with the mayor and aldermen, only distinguished from them by wearing a purple instead of a scarlet gown.
<p>Each of the <num value="26">twenty-six</num> wards into which the City is divided elects <num value="1">one</num> alderman, with the exception ot Cripplegate Within and Cripplegate Without, which together send but <num value="1">one</num>; add to them an alderman for Southwark, or, as it is sometimes called, Bridge Ward Without, and we have the entire number of <num value="26">twenty-six</num>, including the mayor. They are elected for life at ward-motes, by such householders as are at the same time freemen, and paying not less than <measure value="30s." type=currency><num value="30">thirty</num> shillings</measure> to the local taxes. The fine for the rejection of the office is <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure>. Generally speaking, the aldermen consist of those persons who, as common councilmen, have won the good opinion of their fellows, and who are presumed to be fitted for the higher offices.
<p>Talking of the ancient aldermen, Kemble, in his learned work, <title>The Saxons in England,</title>
says:-- <QUOTE>The new constitution introduced by Cnut reduced the ealdorman to a subordinate position. Over several counties was now placed <num value="1">one</num> eorl, or earl, in the northern sense a jarl, with power analogous to that of the Frankish dukes. The word ealdorman itself was used by the Danes to denote a class-gentle indeed, but very inferior to the princely officers who had previously borne that title. It is under Cnut, and the following Danish kings, that we gradually lose sight of the old ealdormen. The king rules by his
<FIGURE id="fig.388facing" n="2000.06.0141"><HEAD>A City Apprentice.--<num value="16">16th</num> Century</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <pb id="p.389" n="389"> earls and his huscarlas, and the ealdormen vanish from the counties. From this time the king's writs are directed to the earl, the bishop, and the sheriff of the county, but in no <num value="1">one</num> of them does the title of the ealdorman any longer occur; while those sent to the towns are directed to the bishop and the portgerefa, or prefect of the city. Gradually the old title ceases altogether, except in the cities, where it denotes an inferior judicature, much as it does among ourselves at the present day.</QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>The courts for the City</QUOTE> in Stow's time were:-- <QUOTE><num value="1">1</num>. The Court of Common Council. <num value="2">2</num>. The Court of the Lord Maior, and his brethren the Aldermen. <num value="3">3</num>. The Court of Hustings. <num value="4">4</num>. The Court of Orphans. <num value="5">5</num>.

<p>In the Court of Exchequer, formerly the Court of King's Bench (where the Mayor's Court is still held), Stow describes <num value="1">one</num> of the windows put up by Whittington's executors, as containing a blazon of the mayor, seated; in, parti-coloured habit, and with his hood on. At the back of the judge's seat there used to be paintings of Prudence, Justice, Religion, and Fortitude. Here there is a large picture, by Alaux, of Paris, presented by Louis Philippe, representing his reception of an address from the City, on his visit to England, in <datestruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct>. This part of the Guildhall treasures also contains several portraits of George III. and Queen Charlotte, by Reynolds' rival, Ramsay (son of Allan Ramsay the poet), and William III. and Queen Mary, by Van der Vaart. There is a pair of classical subjects-Minerva, by Westall, and Apollo washing his locks in the Castalian Fountains, by Gavin Hamilton.
<p> <QUOTE>The greater portion of the judicial business of the Corporation is carried on here; that business, as a whole, comprising in its civil jurisdiction, <num value="1">first</num>, the Court of Hustings, the Supreme Court of Record in London, and which is frequently resorted to in outlawry, and other cases where an expeditious judgment is desired; secondly, the Lord Mayor's Court, which has cognisance of all personal and mixed actions at common law, which is a court of equity, and also a criminal court in matters pertaining to the customs of London; and, thirdly, the Sheriffs' Court, which has a common law jurisdiction only. We may add that the jurisdiction of both courts is confined to the City and liberties, or, in other words, to those portions of incorporated London known respectively, in corporate language, as Within the Walls and Without. The criminal jurisdiction includes the London Sessions, held generally <num value="8">eight</num> times a year, with the Recorder as the acting judge, for the trial of felonies, &amp;c.; the Southwark Sessions, held in Southwark <num value="4">four</num> times a year; and the <num value="8">eight</num> Courts of Conservancy of the River.</QUOTE>
<p>Passing into the Chamberlain's Office, we find a portrait of Mr. Thomas Tomkins, by Reynolds; and if it be asked who is Mr. Thomas Tomkins, we have only to say, in the words of the inscription on another great man, <QUOTE>Look around!</QUOTE> All these beautifully written and emblazoned duplicates of the honorary freedoms and thanks voted by the City, some <num value="60">sixty</num> or more, we believe, in number, are the sole production of him who, we regret to say, is the late Mr. Thomas Tomkins. The duties of the Chamberlain are numerous; among them the most worthy of mention, perhaps, are the admission, on oath, of freemen (till of late years averaging in number <num value="1000">one thousand</num> a year); the determining quarrels between masters and apprentices (Hogarth's prints of the <title>Idle and Industrious Apprentice </title> are the <num value="1">first</num> things you see within the door); and, lastly, the tteasurership, in which department various sums of money pass through his hands. In <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>, the latest year for which we have any authenticated statement, the corporate receipts, derived chiefly from rents, dues, and market tolls, amounted to <measure value="160193l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="160193">160,193</num></measure> IIs. <measure value="8d." type=currency><num value="8">8</num>d.</measure>, and the expenditure to somewhat more. Near the door numerous written papers attract the eye--the useful daily memoranda of the multifarious business eternally going on, and which, in addition to the matters already incidentally referred to, point out <num value="1">one</num> of the modes in which that business is accomplished --the committees. We read of appointments for the Committee of the Royal Exchange--of Sewers --of Corn, Coal, and Finance--of Navigation-of Police, and so on. (Knight's <title>London,</title> <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>.)
<p>In other rooms of the Guildhall are the following interesting pictures:--Opie's <title>Murder of James I. of Scotland;</title> Reynolds' portrait of the great Lord Camden; <num value="2">two</num> studies of a <title>Tiger,</title> and a <title>Lioness and her Young,</title> by Northcote; the

<p>A large folding-screen, painted, it is said, by Copley, represents the Lord Mayor Beckford delivering the City sword to George III., at Temple Bar; interesting for its portraits, and record of the costume of the period; presented by Alderman Salomons to the City in <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct>.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.392.3">The New Library and Museum</lemma> (says Mr. Overall, the librarian), which lies at the east end of the Guildhall, occupies the site of some old and dilapidated houses formerly fronting Basinghall Street, and extending back to the Guildhall. The total frontage of the new buildings to this street is <num value="150">150</num> feet, and the depth upwards of <num value="100">100</num> feet. The structure consists mainly of <num value="2">two</num> rooms, or halls, placed <num value="1">one</num> over the other, with reading, committee, and muniment rooms surrounding them. Of these <num value="2">two</num> halls the museum occupies the lower site, the floor being level with the ancient crypt of the Guildhall, with which it will directly communicate, and is consequently somewhat below the present level of Basinghall Street. This room, divided into naves and aisles, is <num value="83">83</num> feet long and <num value="64">64</num> feet wide, and has a clear height of <num value="26">26</num> feet.

<p>The library above the museum is a hall <num value="100">100</num> feet in length, <num value="65">65</num> feet wide, and <num value="50">50</num> feet in height, divided, like the museum, into naves and aisles, the latter being fitted up with handsome oak bookcases, forming <num value="12">twelve</num> bays, into which the furniture can be moved when the nave is required on state occasions as a reception-hall <num value="1">one</num> of the principal features in the whole design of this building being its adaptability to both the purpose of a library and a series of reception-rooms when required. The hall is exceedingly light, the clerestory over the arcade of the nave, with the large windows at the north and south ends of the room, together with those in the aisles, transmitting a flood of light to every corner of the room. The oak roof--the arched ribs of which are supported by the arms of the <num value="12">twelve</num> great City Companies, with the addition of those of the Leathersellers and Broderers, and also the Royal and City arms--has its several timbers richly moulded, and <pb id="p.393" n="393">

The aisle roofs, the timbers of which are also richly wrought, have louvres over each bay, and the hall at night may be lighted by means of sun-burners suspended from each of these louvres, together with those in the nave. Each of the spandrils of the arcade has, next the nave, a sculptured head, representing History, Poetry, Printing, Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Philosophy, Law, Medicine, Music, Astronomy, Geography, Natural History, and Botany; the several personages chosen to illustrate these subjects being Stow and Camden, Shakespeare and Milton, Guttenberg and Caxton, William of Wykeham and Wren, Michael Angelo and Flaxman, Holbein and Hogarth, Bacon and Locke, Coke and, Blackstone, Harvey and Sydenham, Purcell and Handel, Galileo and Newton, Columbus and Raleigh, Linnaeus and Cuvier, Ray and Gerard. There are <num value="3">three</num> fireplaces in this room.

<p>Of the many historical events that have taken place in the Guildhall, we will now recapitulate a few. Chaucer was connected with <num value="1">one</num> of the most tumultuous scenes in the Guildhall of Richard II.'s time. In <datestruct value="1382--"><year reg="1382">1382</year></datestruct> the City, worn out with the king's tyranny and exactions, selected John of Northampton mayor in place of the king's favourite, Sir Nicholas Brember. A tumult arose when Brember endeavoured to hinder the election, which ended with a body of troops under Sir Robert Knolles interposing and installing the king's nominee. John of Northampton was at once packed off to Corfe Castle, and Chaucer fled to the Continent. He returned to London in <datestruct value="1386--"><year reg="1386">1386</year></datestruct>, and was elected member for Kent. But the king had not forgotten his conduct at the Guildhall, and he was at once deprived of the Comptrollership of the Customs in the Port of London, and sent to the Tower. Here he petitioned the government.
<p>Having alluded to the delicious hours he was wont to spend enjoying the blissful seasons, and contrasted them with his penance in the dark prison, cut off from friendship and acquaintances, <QUOTE>forsaken of all that any word dare speak</QUOTE> for him he continues: <QUOTE>Although I had little in respect (comparison) among others great and worthy, yet had I a fair parcel, as methought for the time, in furthering of my sustenance; and had riches sufficient to waive need; and had dignity to be reverenced in worship; power methought that I had to keep from mine enemies; and meseemed to shine in glory of renown. Every <num value="1">one</num> of those joys is turned into his contrary; for riches, now have I poverty; for dignity, now am imprisoned; instead of power, wretchedness I suffer; and for glory of renown, I am now despised and fully hated.</QUOTE> Chaucer was set free in <datestruct value="1389--"><year reg="1389">1389</year></datestruct>, having, it is said, though we hope unjustly, purchased freedom by dishonourable disclosures as to his former associates.
<p>It was at the Guildhall, a few weeks after the death of Edward IV., and while the princes were <pb id="p.394" n="394"> in the Tower, that the Duke of Buckingham, <QUOTE>the deep revolving witty Buckingham,</QUOTE> Richard's accomplice, convened a meeting of citizens in order to prepare the way for Richard's mounting the throne. Shakespeare, closely following Hall and Sir Thomas More, thus sketches the scene:--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><sp><SPEAKER>Buck.</SPEAKER>

<L>Withal, I did infer your lineaments,
<L>Being the right idea of your father,
<L>Both in your form and nobleness of mind:

<L>Your bounty, virtue, fair humility;
<L>Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose
<L>Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse;

<sp><SPEAKER>Buck.</SPEAKER><L>No, so God help me, they spake not a word;

<L>Which when I saw I reprehended them,
<L>And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence?
<L>His answer was, the people were not us'd

<L>Then he was urg'd to tell my tale again-
<L><QUOTE>Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd ;</QUOTE>

<L>But nothing spoke in warrant from himself.
<L>When he had done, some followers of mine own
<L>At lower end o&lsquo; the hall, hurl'd up their caps,
<L>And some <num value="10">ten</num> voices cried, <QUOTE>God save King Richard!</QUOTE>

<L>And thus I took the vantage of those few-
<L><QUOTE>Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,</QUOTE> quoth I;
<QUOTE><L>This general applause and cheerful shout,

<L>And even here brake off, and came away.</QUOTE>

<p>Anne Askew, tried at the Guildhall in Henry VIII.'s reign, was the daughter of Sir William Askew, a Lincolnshire gentleman, and had been married to a Papist, who had turned her out of doors on her becoming a Protestant. On coming to London to sue for a separation, this lady had been favourably received by the queen and the court ladies, to whom she had denounced transubstantiation, and distributed tracts. Bishop Bonner soon had her in his clutches, and she was cruelly put to the rack in order to induce her to betray the court ladies who had helped her in prison. She pleaded that her servant had only begged money for her from the City apprentices.
<p> <QUOTE>On my being brought to trial at Guildhall,</QUOTE> she says, in her own words, <QUOTE><p>they said to me there that I was a heretic, and condemned by the law, if I would stand in mine opinion. I answered, that I was no heretic, neither yet deserved I any death by the law of God. But as concerning the faith which I uttered and wrote to the council, I would not deny it, because I knew it true. Then would they needs know if I would deny the sacrament to be Christ's body and blood. I said,  <Q>Yea; for the same Son of God who was born of the Virgin Mary is now glorious in heaven, and will come again from thence at the latter day. And as for that ye call your God, it is a piece of bread. For more proof thereof, mark it when you list; if it lie in the box <num value="3">three</num> months it will be mouldy, and so turn to nothing that is good. Whereupon I am persuaded that it cannot be God.</Q>
<p>After that they willed me to have a priest, at which I smiled. Then they asked me if it were not good. I said I would confess my faults unto God, for I was sure he would hear me with favour. And so I was condemned. And this was the ground of my sentence: my belief, which I wrote to the council, that the sacramental bread was left us to be received with thanksgiving in remembrance of Christ's death, the only remedy of our souls' recovery, and that thereby we also receive the whole benefits and fruits of his most glorious passion. Then would they know whether the bread in the box were God or no. I said,  <Q>God is a Spirit, and will be worshipped in spirit and truth.</Q>  Then they demanded,  <Q>Will you plainly deny Christ to be in the sacrament?</Q>  I answered,  <Q>That I believe faithfully the eternal Son of God not to dwell there;</Q>  in witness whereof I recited Daniel iii., Acts vii. and xvii., and Matthew xxiv., concluding thus:  <Q>I neither wish death nor yet fear his might; God have the praise thereof, with thanks.</Q> </QUOTE>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.394.1">Anne Askew was burnt at Smithfield</lemma> with <num value="3">three</num> other martyrs, <datestruct VALUE="1546-07-16"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=16>16</day>, <year reg=1546>1546</year></datestruct>. Bonner, the Chancellor Wriothesley, and many nobles were present on state seats near St. Bartholomew's gate, and their only anxiety was lest the gunpowder hung in bags at the martyrs' necks should injure them when it exploded. Shaxton, the ex-Bishop of Salisbury, who had saved his life by apostacy, preached a sermon to the martyrs before the flames were put to the fagots.
<p>In <datestruct value="1546--"><year reg="1546">1546</year></datestruct> (towards the close of the life of Henry VIII.),
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.394.2">the Earl of Surrey</lemma> was tried for treason at the Guildhall. He was accused of aiming at dethroning the king, and getting the young prince into his hands; also for adding the arms of Edward the Confessor to his escutcheon. The earl, persecuted by the Seymours, says Lord Herbert, <QUOTE>was of a deep understanding, sharp wit, and deep courage, defended himself many ways sometimes denying their accusations as false, and together weakening the credit of his adversaries; sometimes interpreting the words he said in a far other sense than that in which they <pb id="p.395" n="395"> were represented.</QUOTE> Nevertheless, the king had vowed the destruction of the family, and the earl, found guilty, was beheaded on Tower Hill, <datestruct VALUE="1547-01-19"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=19>19</day>, <year reg=1547>1547</year></datestruct>. He had in vain offered to fight his accuser, Sir Richard Southwell, in his shirt. The order for the execution of the duke, his father, arrived at the Tower the very night King Henry died, and so the duke escaped.
<p>Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, another Guildhall sufferer, was the son of a Papist who had refused to take the oath of supremacy, and had been imprisoned in the Tower by Henry VIII. Nicholas, his son, a Protestant, appointed sewer to the burly tyrant, had fought by the king's side in France. During the reign of Edward VI. Throckmorton distinguished himself at the battle of Pinkie, and was knighted by the young king, who made him under-treasurer of the Mint. At Edward's death Throckmorton sent Mary's goldsmith to inform her of her accession. Though no doubt firmly attached to the Princess Elizabeth, Throckmorton took no public part in the Wyatt rebellion; yet, <num value="6">six</num> days after his friend Wyatt's execution, Throckmorton was tried for conspiracy to kill the queen.
<p>The trial itself is so interesting as a specimen of intellectual energy, that we subjoin a scene or <num value="2">two</num>:--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><P><hi rend=italics>Serjeant Stamford</hi>: Methinks those things which others have confessed, together with your own confession, will weigh shrewdly. But what have you to say as to the rising in Kent, and Wyatt's attempt against the Queen's royal person in her palace?
<P><hi rend=italics>Chief Justice Bromley</hi>: Why do you not read to him Wyatt's accusation, which makes him a sharer in his treasons?
<P><hi rend=italics>Sir R. Southwell</hi>: Wyatt has grievously accused you, and in many things which have been confirmed by others.
<P><hi rend=italics>Sir N. Throckmorton</hi>: Whatever Wyatt said of me, in hopes to save his life, he unsaid it at his death; for, since I came into the hall, I heard <num value="1">one</num> say, whom I do not know, that Wyatt on the scaffold cleared not only the Lady Elizabeth and the Earl of Devonshire, but also all the gentlemen in the Tower, saying none of them knew anything of his commotion, of which number I take myself to be <num value="1">one</num>.
<P><hi rend=italics>Sir N. Hare</hi>: Nevertheless, he said that all he had written and confessed before the Council was true.
<P><hi rend=italics>Sir N. Throckmorton</hi>: Nay sir, by your patience, Wyatt did not say so; that was Master Doctor's addition.
<P><hi rend=italics>Sir R. Southwell</hi>: It seems you have good intelligence.
<P><hi rend=italics>Sir N. Throckmorton</hi>: Almighty God provided this revelation for me this very day, since I came hither for I have been in close prison for <num value="8">eight</num> and <num value="50">fifty</num> days, where I could hear nothing but what the birds told me who flew over my head.</QUOTE>

<p>Serjeant Stamford told him the judges did not sit there to make disputations, but to declare the law; and <num value="1">one</num> of those judges (Hare) having confirmed the observation, by telling Throckmorton he had heard both the law and the reason, if he could but understand it, he cried out passionately: <QUOTE>O merciful God! O eternal Father! who seest all things, what manner of proceedings are these? To what purpose was the Statute of Repeal made in the last Parliament, where I heard some of you here present, and several others of the Queen's learned counsel, grievously inveigh against the cruel and bloody laws of Henry VIII., and some laws made in the late King's time? Some termed them Draco's laws, which were written in blood; others said they were more intolerable than any laws made by Dionysius or any other tyrant. In a word, as many men, so many bitter names and terms those laws. <gap> Let us now but look with impartial eyes, and consider thoroughly with ourselves, whether, as you, the judges, handle the statute of Edward III. with your equity and constructions, we are not now in a much worse condition than when we were yoked with those cruel laws. Those laws, grievous and captious as they were, yet had the very property of laws, according to St. Paul's description, for they admonished us, and discovered our sins plainly to us, and when a man is warned he is half armed; but these laws, as they are handled, are very baits to catch us, and only prepared for that purpose. They are no laws at all, for at <num value="1">first</num> sight they assure us that we are delivered from our old bondage, and live in more security; but when it pleases the higher powers to call any man's life and sayings in question, then there are such constructions, interpretations, and extensions reserved to the judges and their equity, that the party tried, as I am now, will find himself in a much worse case than when those cruel laws were in force. But I require you, honest men, who are to try my life, to consider these things. It is clear these judges are inclined rather to the times than to the truth, for their judgments are repugnant to the law, repugnant to their own principles, and repugnant to the opinions of their godly and learned predecessors.</QUOTE>
<p>We rejoice to say that, in spite of all the efforts of his enemies, this gentleman escaped the scaffold, and lived to enjoy happier times.
<p>Lastly, we come to <num value="1">one</num> of the Gunpowder Plot conspirators; not <num value="1">one</num> of the most guilty, yet undoubtedly cognisant of the mischief brewing,
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1606-03-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1606">1606</year></datestruct>, Garnet, the Superior of the English Jesuits (whose cruel execution in St. Paul's Churchyard we have already described), was tried at the Guildhall, and found guilty of having taken part in organising the Gunpowder Plot. He was found concealed at Hendlip, the mansion of a Roman Catholic gentleman, near Worcester.

<P>The modern Lord Mayor is supposed to have had a prototype in the Roman prefect and the Saxon portgrave. The Lord Mayor is only <QUOTE>Lord</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>Right Honourable</QUOTE> by courtesy, and not from his dignity as a Privy Councillor on the demise or abdication of a sovereign.
<P>In <datestruct value="1189--"><year reg="1189">1189</year></datestruct>, Richard I. elected
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.396.8">Henry Fitz Ailwyn</lemma>, a draper of London, to be <num value="1">first</num> mayor of London, and he served <num value="24">twenty-four</num> years. He is supposed to have been a descendant of Aylwyn Child, who founded the priory at Bermondsey in <datestruct value="1082--"><year reg="1082">1082</year></datestruct>. He was buried, according to Strype, at St. Mary <pb id="p.397" n="397"> Bothaw, Walbrook, a church destroyed in the Great Fire; but according to Stow, in the Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate. There is a doubtful half-length oil-portrait or panel of the venerable Fitz Alwyn over the master's chair in Drapers' Hall, but it has no historical value. But the <num value="1">first</num> formal mayor was Richard Renger (<datestruct value="1223--"><year reg="1223">1223</year></datestruct>), King John granting the right of choosing a mayor to the citizens, provided he was <num value="1">first</num> presented to the king or his justice for approval. Henry III. afterwards allowed the presentation to take place in the king's absence before the Barons of the Exchequer at Westminster, to prevent expense and delay, as the citizens could not be expected to search for the king all over England and France.
<p>The presentation to the king, even when he was in England, long remained a great vexation with <num value="34">34</num>

 the London mayors. For instance, in <datestruct value="1240--"><year reg="1240">1240</year></datestruct>, Gerard Bat, chosen a <num value="2">second</num> time, went to Woodstock Palace to be presented to King Henry III., who refused to appoint him till he (the king) came to London.
<p>Henry III., indeed, seems to have been, chronically troubled by the London mayors, for in <datestruct value="1264--"><year reg="1264">1264</year></datestruct>, on the mayor and aldermen doing fealty to the king in St. Paul's, the mayor, with blunt honesty, dared to say to the weak monarch, <QUOTE>My lord, so long as you unto us will be a good lord and king, we will be faithful and duteous unto you.</QUOTE>
<P>These were bold words in a reign when the heading block was always kept ready near a throne. In <datestruct value="1265--"><year reg="1265">1265</year></datestruct>, the same monarch seized and imprisoned the mayor and chief aldermen for fortifying the City in favour of the barons, and for <num value="4">four</num> years the

The City again recovered its liberties and retained them till <datestruct value="1285"><year reg="1285">1285</year></datestruct> (Edward I.), when Sir Gregory Rokesley refusing to go out of the City to appear before the king's justices at the Tower, the mayoralty was again suspended and custodes appointed till the year <datestruct value="1298"><year reg="1298">1298</year></datestruct>, when Henry Wallein was elected mayor. Edward II. also held a tight hand on the mayoralty till he appointed the great goldsmith, Sir Nicholas Farindon, mayor <QUOTE>as long as it pleased him.</QUOTE> Farindon gave the title to Farringdon Ward, which had been in his family <num value="82">eighty-two</num> years, the consideration being <measure value="20bmark" type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> marks</measure> as a fine, and <num value="1">one</num> clove or a slip of gillyflower at the feast of Easter. He was a warden of the Goldsmiths, and was buried at St. Peter-le-Chepe, a church that before the Great Fire stood where the plane-tree now waves at the corner of Wood Street. He left money for a light to burn before our Lady the Virgin in St. Peter-le-Chepe for ever.
<p>The mayoralty of Andrew Aubrey, Grocer (<datestruct value="1339--"><year reg="1339">1339</year></datestruct>), was rather warlike; for the mayor and <num value="2">two</num> of his officers being assaulted in a tumult, <num value="2">two</num> of the ringleaders were beheaded at once in Chepe. In <num value="356">356</num>, Henry Picard, mayor of London, was an honoured man, for he had the glory of feasting Edward III. of England, the Black Prince, John King of Austria, the King of Cyprus, and David of Scotland, and afterwards opened his hall to all comers at cards and dice, his wife inviting the court ladies.
<p>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.398.1">Sir William Walworth</lemma> a fishmonger, who was mayor in <datestruct value="1374--"><year reg="1374">1374</year></datestruct> (Edward III.) and <datestruct value="1380--"><year reg="1380">1380</year></datestruct>. (Richard II.), was that prompt and choleric man who somewhat basely slew the Kentish rebel, Wat Tyler, when he was invited to a parley by the young king. It was long supposed that the dagger in the City arms was added in commemoration of this foul blow, but Stow has clearly shown that it was intended to represent the sword of St. Paul, the patron saint of the Corporation of London. The manor of Walworth belonged to the family of this mayor, who was buried in the Church of St. Michael, Crooked Lane, the parish where he had resided. Some antiquaries, says Mr. Timbs, think the prefix of <QUOTE>Lord</QUOTE> is traceable to <datestruct value="1378--"><year reg="1378">1378</year></datestruct> (ist Richard II.), when there was a general assessment for a war subsidy. The question was where was the mayor to come. <QUOTE>Have him among the earls,</QUOTE> was the suggestion; so the right worshipful had to pay <measure value="4l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4">4</num></measure>, about <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> of our present money.
<p>And now we come to a mayor greater even in City story and legend than even Walworth himself, even the renowned
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.398.2">Richard Whittinton</lemma> the hero of our nursery days. He was the son of a Gloucestershire knight, who had fallen into poverty. The industrious son, born in <datestruct value="1350--"><year reg="1350">1350</year></datestruct> (Edward III.), on coming to London, was apprenticed to Hugh Fitzwarren, a mercer. Disgusted with the drudgery, he ran away; but while resting by a stone cross at the foot of Highgate Hill, he is said to have heard in the sound of Bow Bells the voice of his good angel, <QUOTE>Turn again, Whittington, thrice Lord Mayor of London.</QUOTE> What a charm there is still in the old story As for the cat that made his fortune by catching all the mice in Barbary, we fear we must throw him overboard, even though Stow tells a true story of a man and a cat that greatly resembles that told of Whittington. Whittington married his master's daughter, and became a wealthy merchant. He supplied the wedding trousseau of the Princess Blanche, eldest daughter of Henry IV., when she married the son of the King of the Romans, and also the pearls and cloth of gold for the marriage of the Princess Philippa. He became the court banker, and lent large sums of money to our lavish monarchs, especially to the chivalrous Henry V. for carrying on the siege of Harfleur, a siege celebrated by Shakespeare. It is said that in his last mayoralty King Henry V. and Queen Catherine dined with him in the City, when Whittington caused a fire to be lighted of precious woods, mixed with cinnamon and other spices; and then taking all the bonds given him by the king for money lent, amounting to no less than <measure value="60000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="60000">60,000</num></measure>, he threw them into the fire and burnt them, thereby freeing his sovereign from his debts. The king, astonished at such a proceeding, exclaimed, <QUOTE>Surely, never had king such a subject;</QUOTE> to which Whittington, with court gallantry, replied, <QUOTE>Surely, sire, never had subject such a king.</QUOTE>
<p>Whittington was really <num value="4">four</num> times mayor-twice in Richard II.'s reign, once in that of Henry IV., and once in that of Henry V. As a mayor Whittington was popular, and his justice and patriotism became proverbial. He vigorously opposed the admission of foreigners into the freedom of the City, and he fined the Brewers' Company <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> for selling bad ale and forestalling the market. His generosity was like a well-spring; and being childless, he spent his life in deeds of charity and generosity. He erected conduits at Cripplegate and Billingsgate; he founded a library at the Grey Friars' Monastery in Newgate Street (now Christ's Hospital); he procured the completion of the
<title lang=la>Liber Albus</title>, a book of City customs; and he gave largely towards the Guildhall library. He paved the Guildhall, restored the hospital of St. Bartholomew, and by his will left money to rebuild Newgate, and erect almshouses on College Hill <pb id="p.399" n="399"> (now removed to Highgate) He died in <datestruct value="1427--"><year reg="1427">1427</year></datestruct> (Henry VI.). Nor should we forget that Whittington was also a great architect, and enlarged the nave of Westminster Abbey for his knightly master, Henry V. This large-minded and munificent man resided in a grand mansion in Hart Street, up a gateway a few doors from Mark Lane. A very curious old house in Sweedon's Passage, Grub Street, with an external winding staircase, used to be pointed out as Whittington's; and the splendid old mansion in Hart Street, Crutched Friars, pulled down in <datestruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></datestruct>, and replaced by offices and warehouses, was said to have cats'-heads for knockers, and cats' heads (whose eyes seemed always turned on you) carved in the ceilings. The doorways, and the brackets of the long lines of projecting Tudor windows, were beautifully carved with grotesque figures.
<p>In <datestruct value="1418--"><year reg="1418">1418</year></datestruct> (Henry V.) Sir William de Sevenoke was mayor. This rich merchant had risen to the top of the tree by cleverness and diligence equal to that of Whittington, but we hear less of his charity. He was a foundling, brought up by charitable persons, and apprenticed to a grocer. He was knighted by Henry VI., and represented the City in Parliament. Dying in <datestruct value="1432--"><year reg="1432">1432</year></datestruct>, he was buried at St. Martin's, Ludgate.
<p>In <datestruct value="1426--"><year reg="1426">1426</year></datestruct> (Henry VI.) Sir John Rainewell, mayor, with a praiseworthy disgust at all dishonesty in trade, detecting Lombard merchants adulterating their wines, ordered <num value="150">150</num> butts to be stove in and swilled down the kennels. How he might wash down London now with cheap sherry!
<p>In <datestruct value="1445--"><year reg="1445">1445</year></datestruct> (Henry VI.), Sir Simon Eyre. This very worthy mayor left <measure value="3000bmark" type=currency><num value="3000">3,000</num> marks</measure> to the Company of Drapers, for prayers to be read to the market people by a priest in the chapel at Guildhall.
<p>It is related that when it was proposed to Eyre at Guildhall that he should stand for sheriff, he would fain have excused himself, as he did not think his income was sufficient; but he was soon silenced by <num value="1">one</num> of the aldermen observing <QUOTE>that no citizen could be more capable than the man who had openly asserted that he broke his fast every day on a table for which he would not take a <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">thousand</num> pounds</measure>.</QUOTE> This assertion excited the curiosity of the then Lord Mayor and all present, in consequence of which his lordship and <num value="2">two</num> of the aldermen, having invited themselves, accompanied him home to dinner. On their arrival Mr. Eyre desired his wife to <QUOTE>prepare the little table, and set some refreshment before the guests.</QUOTE> This she would fain have refused, but finding he would take no excuse, she seated herself on a low stool, and, spreading a damask napkin over her lap, with a venison pasty thereon, Simon exclaimed to the astonished mayor and his brethren, <QUOTE>Behold the table which I would not take a <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">thousand</num> pounds</measure> for!</QUOTE> Soon after this Sir Simon was chosen Lord Mayor, on which occasion, remembering his former promise <QUOTE>at the conduit,</QUOTE> he, on the following Shrove Tuesday, gave a pancake feast to all the &lsquo;prentices in London; on which occasion they went in procession to the Mansion House, where they met with a cordial reception from Sir Simon and his lady, who did the honours of the table on this memorable day, allowing their guests to want for neither ale nor wine.
<p>In <datestruct value="1453--"><year reg="1453">1453</year></datestruct> Sir John Norman was the <num value="1">first</num> mayor who rowed to Westminster. The mayors had hitherto generally accompanied the presentation show on horseback. The Thames watermen, delighted with the innovation so profitable to them, wrote a song in praise of Norman, <num value="2">two</num> lines of which are quoted by Fabyan in his <title>Chronicles;</title> and Mr. Rimbault, an eminent musical antiquary, thinks he has found the original tune in John Hilton's <QUOTE>Catch That, Catch Can</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1658--"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>).
<p>The deeds of Sir Stephen Forster, Fishmonger, and mayor <datestruct value="1454--"><year reg="1454">1454</year></datestruct> (Henry VI.), who by his will left money to rebuild Newgate, we have mentioned elsewhere (p. <num value="224">224</num>). Sir Godfrey Boleine, Lord Mayor, <datestruct value="1457--"><year reg="1457">1457</year></datestruct> (Henry VI.), was grandfather to Thomas, Earl of Wiltshire, the grandfather of Queen Elizabeth. He was a mercer in the Old Jewry, and left by his will<measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> to the poor householders of London, and <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure> to the poor householders in Norfolk (his native county), besides large legacies to the London prisons, lazar. houses, and hospitals. Such were the citizens, from whom half our aristocracy has sprung. Sir Godfrey Fielding, a mercer in Milk Street, Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1452--"><year reg="1452">1452</year></datestruct> (Henry VI.), was the ancestor of the Earls of Denbigh, and a privy councillor of the king.
<p>In Edward IV.'s reign, when the Lancastrians, under the bastard Falconbridge, stormed the City in <num value="2">two</num> places, but were eventually bravely repulsed by the citizens, Edward, in gratitude, knighted the mayor, Sir John Stockton, and <num value="12">twelve</num>, of the aldermen. In <datestruct value="1479--"><year reg="1479">1479</year></datestruct> (the same reign) Bartholomew James (Draper) had Sheriff Bayfield fined <num value="50">50</num><hi rend=italics>o</hi> (about <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> of our money) for kneeling too close to him while at prayers in St. Paul's, and for reviling him when complained of. There was a pestilence raging at the time, and the mayor was afraid of contagion. The money went, we presume, to build <num value="10">ten</num> City conduits, then much wanted. The Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1462--"><year reg="1462">1462</year></datestruct>, Sir Thomas Coke (Draper), <pb id="p.400" n="400"> ancestor of Lord Bacon, Earl Fitzwilliam, the Marquis of Salisbury, and Viscount Cranbourne, being a Lancastrian, suffered much from the rapacious tyranny of Edward IV. The very year he was made Knight of the Bath, Coke was sent to the Bread Street Compter, afterwards to the Bench, and illegally fined <measure value="8000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="8000">8,000</num></measure> to the king and <measure value="800l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="800">800</num></measure> to the queen. <num value="2">Two</num> aldermen also had their goods seized, and were fined <measure value="4000bmark" type=currency><num value="4000">4,000</num> marks</measure>. In <datestruct value="1473--"><year reg="1473">1473</year></datestruct> this greedy king sent to Sir William Hampton, Lord Mayor, to extort benevolences, or subsidies. The mayor gave <measure value="30l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30">30</num></measure>, the aldermen <measure value="20bmark" type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> marks</measure>, the poorer persons <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> each. In <datestruct value="1481--"><year reg="1481">1481</year></datestruct>, King Edward sent the mayor, William Herriot (Draper), for the good he had done to trade, <num value="2">two</num> harts, <num value="6">six</num> bucks, and a tun of wine, for a banquet to the lady mayoress and the aldermen's wives at Drapers' Hall.
<p>At Richard III.'s coronation (<datestruct value="1483--"><year reg="1483">1483</year></datestruct>), the Lord Mayor, Sir Edmund Shaw, attended as cup-bearer with great pomp, and the mayor's claim to this honour was formally allowed and put on record. Shaw was a goldsmith, and supplied the usurper with most of his plate. Sir William Horn, Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1487--"><year reg="1487">1487</year></datestruct>, had been knighted on Bosworth field by Henry VII., for whom he fought against the <QUOTE>ravening Richard.</QUOTE> This mayor's real name was Littlesbury (we are told), but Edward IV. had nicknamed him Horn, from his peculiar skill on that instrument. The year Henry VII. landed at Milford Haven <num value="2">two</num> London mayors died. In <datestruct value="1486--"><year reg="1486">1486</year></datestruct> (Henry VII.), Sir Henry Colet, father of good Dean Colet, who founded St. Paul's School, was mayor.
<p>Colet chose John Percival (Merchant Taylor), his carver, sheriff, by drinking to him in a cup of wine, according to custom, and Perceval forthwith sat down at the mayor's table. Percival was afterwards mayor in <datestruct value="1498--"><year reg="1498">1498</year></datestruct>. Henry VII. was remorseless in squeezing money out of the City by every sort of expedient. He fined Alderman Capel <measure value="2700l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2700">2,700</num></measure>; he made the City buy a confirmation of their charter for <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure>; in <datestruct value="1505--"><year reg="1505">1505</year></datestruct> he threw Thomas Knesworth, who had been mayor the year before, and his sheriff, into the Marshalsea, and fined them <measure value="1400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1400">1,400</num></measure>; and the year after, he imprisoned Sir Lawrence Aylmer, mayor in the previous year, and extorted money from him. He again amerced Alderman Capel (ancestor of the Earls of Essex) <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure>, and on his bold resistance, threw him into the Tower for life. In <datestruct value="1490--"><year reg="1490">1490</year></datestruct> (Henry VII.) John Matthew earned the distinction of being the <num value="1">first</num>, but probably not the last, bachelor Lord Mayor; and a cheerless mayoralty it must have been. In <datestruct value="1502--"><year reg="1502">1502</year></datestruct> Sir John Shaw held the Lord Mayor's feast for the <num value="1">first</num> time in the
<p>Guildhall; and the same hospitable mayor built the Guildhall kitchen at his own expense.
<p>Henry VIII.'s mayors were worshipful men, and men of renown. To Walworth and Whittington was now to be added the illustrious name of Gresham. Sir Richard Gresham, who was mayor in the year <datestruct value="1537"><year reg="1537">1537</year></datestruct>, was the father of the illustrious founder of the Royal Exchange. He was of a Norfolk family, and with his <num value="3">three</num> brothers carried on trade as mercers. He became a Gentleman sher Extraordinary to Henry VIII., and at the tearing to pieces of the monasteries by that monarch, he obtained, by judicious courtliness, no less than <num value="5">five</num> successive grants of Church lands. He advocated the construction of an Exchange, encouraged freedom of trade, and is said to have invented bills of exchange. In <datestruct value="1525--"><year reg="1525">1525</year></datestruct> he was nearly expelled the Common Council for trying, at Wolsey's instigation, to obtain a benevolence from the citizens. It is greatly to Gresham's credit that he helped Wolsey after his fall, and Henry, who with all his faults was magnanimous, liked Gresham none the worse for that. In the interesting <title>Paston Letters</title> (Henry VI.), there are <num value="11">eleven</num> letters of <num value="1">one</num> of Gresham's Norfolk ancestors, dated from London, and the seal a grasshopper. Sir Richard Gresham died <datestruct value="1548--"><year reg="1548">1548</year></datestruct> (Edward VI.), at Bethnal Green, and was buried in the church of St. Lawrence Jewry. Gresham's daughter married an ancestor of the Marquis of Bath, and the Duke of Buckingham and Lord Braybrooke are said to be descendants of his brother John, so much has good City blood enriched our proud Norman aristocracy, and so often has the full City purse gone to fill again the exhausted treasury of the old knighthood. In <datestruct value="1545--"><year reg="1545">1545</year></datestruct>, Sir Martin Bowes (Goldsmith) was mayor, and lent Henry VIII., whose purse was a cullender, the sum of <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure>. Sir Martin was butler at Elizabeth's coronation, and left the Goldsmiths' Company his gold fee cup, out of which the Queen drank. In our history of the Goldsmiths' Company we have mentioned his portrait in Goldsmiths' Hall. Alderman William Fitzwilliam, in this reign, also nobly stood by his patron, Wolsey, after his fall; for which the King, saying he had too few such servants, knighted him and made him a Privy Councillor. When he died, in the year <datestruct value="1542"><year reg="1542">1542</year></datestruct>, he was Knight of the Garter, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He left <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> to dower poor maidens, and his best <QUOTE>standing cup</QUOTE> to his brethren, the Merchant Taylors. In <datestruct value="1536--"><year reg="1536">1536</year></datestruct> the King invited the Lord Mayor, Sir Raphe Warren (an ancestor of Cromwell and Hampden, says Mr. Orridge), the aldermen, and <num value="40">forty</num> of the <pb id="p.401" n="401"> principal citizens, to the christening of the Princess Elizabeth, at Greenwich; and at the ceremony the scarlet gowns and gold chains made a gallant show.
<p>In Edward VI.'s reign, the Greshams again came to the front. In <datestruct value="1547--"><year reg="1547">1547</year></datestruct>, Sir John Gresham, brother of the Sir Richard before mentioned, obtained from Henry VIII. the hospital of St. Mary Bethlehem as an asylum for lunatics.
<p>In this reign the City Corporation lands (as being given by Papists for superstitious uses) were all claimed for the King's use, to the amount of <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> per annum. The London Corporation, unable to resist this tyranny, had to retrieve them at the rate of <num value="20">twenty</num> years' purchase. Sir Andrew Judd (Skinner), mayor in <datestruct value="1550--"><year reg="1550">1550</year></datestruct>, was ancestor of Lord Teynham, Viscount Strangford, Chief Baron Smythe, &amp;c. Among the bequests in his will were <QUOTE>the sandhills at the back side of Holborn,</QUOTE> then let for a few pounds a year, now worth nearly <num value="20000">20,000</num> per annum. In <datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct> Sir Thomas White (Merchant Taylor) kept the citizens loyal to Queen Mary during Wyatt's rebellion, the brave Queen coming to Guildhall and personally re-assuring the citizens. White was the son of a poor clothier; at the age of <num value="12">twelve</num> he was apprenticed to a London tailor, who left him <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="100">100</num></measure> to begin the world with, and by thrift and industry he rose to wealth. He was the generous founder of St. John's College, Oxford. According to Webster, the poet, he had been directed in a dream to found a college upon a spot where he should find <num value="2">two</num> bodies of an elm springing from <num value="1">one</num> root. Discovering no such tree at Cambridge, he went to Oxford, and finding a likely tree in Gloucester Hall garden, began at once to enlarge and widen that college; but soon after he found the real tree of his dream, outside the north gate of Oxford, and on that spot he founded St. John's College.
<p>In the reign of Elizabeth, many great-hearted citizens served the office of mayor. Again we shall see how little even the best monarchs of these days understood the word <QUOTE>liberty,</QUOTE> and how the constant attacks upon their purses taught the London citizens to appreciate and to defend their rights.

<p>The period of the Commonwealth did not furnish many mayors worth recording here. In <datestruct value="1644--"><year reg="1644">1644</year></datestruct>, the year of Marston Moor, the City gave a splendid entertainment to both Houses of Parliament, the Earls of Essex, Warwick, and Manchester, the Scotch Commissioners, Cromwell, and the principal officers of the army. They heard a sermon at Christ Church, Newgate Street, and went on foot to Guildhall. The Lord Mayor and aldermen led the procession, and as they passed through Cheapside, some Popish pictures, crucifixes, and relics were burnt on a scaffold. The object of the banquet was to prevent a letter of the king's being read in the Common Hall. On <datestruct value="01-7"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=7>7th</day></datestruct> the Lord Mayor gave a banquet to the House of Commons, Cromwell, and the chief officers, to commemorate the rout of the dangerous Levellers.

<p>The reign of Charles II. and the Royalist reaction brought more tyranny and more trouble to the City. The king tried to be as despotic as his father, and resolved to break the Whig love of freedom that prevailed among the citizens. Loyal as some of the citizens seem to have been, King Charles scarcely deserved much favour at their hands. A more reckless tyrant to the City had never sat on the English throne. Because they refused a loan of <measure value="100000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure> on bad security, the king imprisoned <num value="20">twenty</num> of the principal citizens, and required the City to fit out <num value="100">100</num> ships. For a trifling riot in the City (a mere pretext), the mayor and aldermen were amerced in the sum of <measure value="6000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6000">6,000</num></measure>. For the pretended mismanagement of their Irish estates, the City was condemned to the loss of their Irish possessions and fined <num value="50000">50,000</num>. <num value="4">Four</num> aldermen were imprisoned for not disclosing the names of friends who refused to advance money to the king; and, finally, to the contempt of all constitutional law, the citizens were forbidden to petition the king for the redress of grievances.

Of his Lady Mayoress an old story is told relative to the custom of the sovereign kissing the Lady Mayoress upon visiting Guildhall. Queen Anne broke down this observance; but upon the accession of George I., on his <num value="1">first</num> visit to the City, from his known character for gallantry, it was expected that once again a Lady Mayoress was to be kissed by the king on the steps of the Guildhall. But he had no feeling of admiration for English beauty. <QUOTE>It was only,</QUOTE> says a writer in the <title>Athenaeum</title>, <QUOTE><p>after repeated assurance that saluting a lady, on her appointment to a confidential post near some persons of the Royal Family, was the sealing, as it were, of her appointment, that he expressed his readiness to kiss Lady Cowper on her nomination as lady of the bedchamber to the Princess of Wales. At his <num value="1">first</num> appearance at Guildhall, the admirer of Madame Kielmansegge respected the new observance established by Queen Anne; yet poor Lady Humphreys, the mayoress, hoped, at all events, to receive the usual tribute from royalty from the lips of the Princess of Wales. But that strong-minded woman, Caroline Dorothea Wilhelmina, steadily looked away from the mayor's consort. She would not do what Queen Anne had not thought worth the doing; and Lady Humphreys, we are sorry to say, stood upon her unstable rights, and displayed a considerable amount of bad temper and worse behaviour. She wore a train of black velvet, then considered <num value="1">one</num> of the privileges of City royalty, and being wronged of <num value="1">one</num>, she resolved to make the best of that which she possessed-bawling, as ladies, mayoresses, and women generally should never do-bawling to her page to hold up her train, and sweeping away therewith before the presence of the amused princess herself. The incident altogether seems to have been too much for the good but irate lady's nerves; and unable or unwilling, when dinner was announced, to carry her stupendous bouquet, emblem of joy and welcome, she flung it to a <num value="2">second</num> page who attended on her state, with a scream of  <Q>Boy, take my
<hi rend=italics>bucket</hi> </Q>  In <hi rend=italics>her</hi> view of things, the sun had set on the glory of mayoralty for ever.
<p>The king was as much amazed as the princess had been amused; and a well-inspired wag of the Court whispered an assurance which increased his perplexity. It was to the effect that the angry lady was only a mock Lady Mayoress, whom the unmarried Mayor had hired for the occasion, borrowing her for that day only. The assurance was credited for a time, till persons more discreet than the wag convinced the Court party that Lady Humphreys was really no counterfeit. She was no beauty either; and the same party, when they withdrew from the festive scene, were all of <num value="1">one</num> mind, that she must needs be what she seemed, for if the Lord Mayor had been under the necessity of borrowing, he would have borrowed altogether another sort of woman.</QUOTE> This is <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest stories connecting the City with an idea of vulgarity and purse pride.

Sir Christopher Gascoigne (<datestruct value="1753--"><year reg="1753">1753</year></datestruct>), an ancestor of the present Viscount Cranbourne, was the <num value="1">first</num> Lord Mayor who resided at the Mansion House.
<P>In that memorable year (<datestruct value="1761"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>) when Sir Samuel Fludyer was elected, King George III. and Queen Charlotte (the young couple newly crowned) came to the City to see the Lord Mayor's Show from Mr. Barclay's window, as we have already described in our account of Cheapside; and the ancient pageant was so far revived that the Fishmongers ventured on a St. Peter, a dolphin, and <num value="2">two</num> mermaids, and the Skinners on Indian princes dressed in furs. Sir Samuel Fludyer was a Cloth Hall factor, and the City's scandalous chronicle says that he originally came up to London attending clothier's pack-horses, from the west country; his <num value="2">second</num> wife was granddaughter of a nobleman, and niece of the Earl of Cardigan. His sons married into the Montagu and Westmoreland families, and his descendants are connected with the Earls Onslow and Brownlow; and he was very kind to young Romilly, his kinsman (afterwards the excellent Sir Samuel). The <title>City Biography</title> says Fludyer died from vexation at a reprimand given him by the Lord Chancellor, for having carried on a contraband trade in scarlet cloth, to the prejudice of the East India Company., Sir Samuel was the ground landlord of Fludyer Street, Westminster, cleared away for the new Foreign Office.
<p>In <datestruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct> and again in <datestruct value="1769--"><year reg="1769">1769</year></datestruct> that bold citizen, William Beckford, a friend of the great Chatham, was Lord Mayor. He was descended from a Maidenhead tailor, <num value="1">one</num> of whose sons made a fortune in Jamaica. At Westminster School he had acquired the friendship of Lord Mansfield and a rich earl. Beckford united in himself the following apparently incongruous characters. He was an enormously rich Jamaica planter, a merchant, a member of Parliament, a militia officer, a provincial magistrate, a London alderman, a man of pleasure, a man of taste, an orator, and a country gentleman. He opposed Government on all occasions, especially in bringing over Hessian troops, and in carrying on a German war. His great dictum was that under the House of Hanover Englishmen for the <num value="1">first</num> time had been able to be free, and for the <num value="1">first</num> time had determined to be free. He presented to the king a remonstrance against a false return made at the Middlesex election. he king expressed dissatisfaction at the remonstrance, but Beckford presented another, and to the astonishment of the Court, added the following impromptu speech:
<p> <QUOTE>Permit me, sire, to observe,</QUOTE> are said to have been the concluding remarks of the insolent citizen, <QUOTE>that whoever has already dared, or shall hereafter endeavour by false insinuations and suggestions to alienate your Majesty's affections from your loyal subjects in general, and from the City of London in particular, and to withdraw your confidence in, and regard for, your people, is an enemy to your Majesty's person and family, a violator of the public peace, and a betrayer of our happy constitution as it was established at the <hi rend=italics>Glorious and Necessary Revolution</hi>.</QUOTE> At these words the king's countenance was observed to flush with anger. He still, however, presented a dignified silence; and accordingly the citizens, after having been permitted to kiss the king's hand, were forced to return dissatisfied from the presence-chamber.
<p>This speech, which won Lord Chatham's <QUOTE>admiration, thanks, and affection,</QUOTE> and was inscribed on the pedestal of Beckford's statue erected in Guildhall, has been the subject of bitter disputes. Isaac Reed boldly asserts every word was written by Horne Tooke, and that Home Tooke himself said so. Gifford, with his usual headlong partisanship, says the same; but there is every reason to suppose that the words are those uttered by Beckford with but <num value="1">one</num> slight alteration. Beckford <pb id="p.408" n="408"> died, a short time after making this speech, of a fever, caught by riding from London to Fonthill, his Wiltshire estate. His son, the novelist and voluptuary, had a long minority, and succeeded at last to a million ready money and <measure value="100000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure> a year, only to end life a solitary, despised, exiled man. <num value="1">One</num> of his daughters married the Duke of Hamilton.
<p>The Right Hon. Thomas Harley, Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1768--"><year reg="1768">1768</year></datestruct>, was a brother of the Earl of Oxford. He turned wine-merchant, and married the daughter of his father's steward, according to the scandalous chronicles in the <title>City Biography.</title> He is said, in partnership with Mr. Drummond, to have made <measure value="600000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="600000">600,000</num></measure> by taking a Government contract to pay the English army in America with foreign gold. He was for many years <QUOTE>the father of the City.</QUOTE>
<p>Harley <num value="1">first</num> rendered himself famous in the City by seizing the boot and petticoat which the mob were burning opposite the Mansion House, in derision of Lord Bute and the princess-dowager, at the time the sheriffs were burning the celebrated
<hi rend=italics>North Briton</hi>. The mob were throwing the papers about as matter of diversion, and <num value="1">one</num> of the bundles

 fell, unfortunately, with considerable force, against the front glass of Mr. Sheriff Harley's chariot, which it shattered to pieces. This gave the <num value="1">first</num> alarm; the sheriffs retired into the Mansion House, and a man was taken up and brought there for examination, as a person concerned in the riot. The man appeared to be a mere idle spectator; but the Lord Mayor informed the court that, in order to try the temper of the mob, he had ordered <num value="1">one</num> of his own servants to be dressed in the clothes of the supposed offender, and conveyed to the Poultry Compter, so that if a rescue should be effected, the prisoner would still be in custody, and the real disposition of the people discovered. However, everything was peaceable, and the course of justice was not interrupted, nor did any insult accompany the commitment; whereupon the prisoner was discharged. What followed, in the actual burning of the seditious paper, the Lord Mayor declared (according to the best information), arose from circumstances equally foreign to any illegal or violent designs. For these reasons his lordship concluded by declaring that, with the greatest respect for the sheriffs. and a firm belief that they would have done their duty in spite of any danger, he should put a negative upon <pb id="p.409" n="409"> giving the thanks of the City upon a matter that was not sufficiently important for a public and solemn acknowledgment, which ought only to follow the most eminent exertions of duty.
<p>In <datestruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct> Brass Crosby (mayor) signalised himself by a patriotic resistance to Court oppression, and the arbitrary proceedings of the House of Commons. He was a Sunderland solicitor, who had married his employer's widow, and settled in London. He married in all <num value="3">three</num> wives, and is said to have received <measure value="200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200000">200,000</num></measure> by the <num value="3">three</num>. Shortly after Crosby's election, the House of Commons issued warrants against the printers of the <title>Middlesex Journal</title> and the <title>Gazetteer</title>, for presuming to give reports of the debates; but on being brought before Alderman Wilkes, he discharged them. The House then proceeded against the printer of the <title>Evening Post</title>, but Crosby discharged him, and committed the messenger of the House for assault and false imprisonment. Not long after, Crosby appeared at the bar of the House, and defended what he had done; pleading strongly that by an Act of William and Mary no warrant could be executed in the City but by its ministers. Wilkes also had received an order to attend at the bar of the House, but refused to comply with it, on the ground that no notice had been taken in the order of his being a member. The next day the Lord Mayor's clerk attended with the Book of Recognisances, and Lord North having carried a motion that the recognisance be erased, the clerk was compelled to cancel it. Most of the Opposition indignantly rose and left <num value="35">35</num>

The people were furious; Lord North lost his cocked hat, and even Fox had his clothes torn; and the mob obtaining a rope, but for Crosby's entreaties, would have hung the Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms. The question was simply whether the House had the right to despotically arrest and imprison, and to supersede trial by jury. On the <datestruct value="05-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct> the session terminated, and the Lord Mayor was released, The City was illuminated at night, and there were great rejoicings.

</LIST></ARGUMENT>

<P>In <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct> that clever rascal,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.410.1">John Wilkes</lemma>, ascended the civic throne. We shall also often meet this unscrupulous demagogue about London, that we will not dwell upon him here at much length. Wilkes was born in Clerkenwell, <datestruct value="1727--"><year reg="1727">1727</year></datestruct>. His father, Israel Wilkes, was a rich distiller (as his father and grandfather had been), who kept a coach and <num value="6">six</num>, and whose house was a resort of persons of rank, merchants, and men of letters. Young Wilkes grew up a man of pleasure, squandered his wife's fortune in gambling and other fashionable vices, and became a notorious member of the Hell Fire Club at Medmenham Abbey. He now eagerly strove for place, asking Mr. Pitt to find him a post in the Board of Trade, or to send him as ambassador to Constantinople. Finding his efforts useless, he boldly avowed his intention of becoming notorious by assailing Government. In <datestruct value="1763--"><year reg="1763">1763</year></datestruct>, in his scurrilous paper, the <title>North Britain</title>, he violently abused the Princess Dowager and her favourite Lord Bute, who were supposed to influence the young king, and in the celebrated No. <num value="45">45</num> he accused the ministers of putting a lie in the king's mouth. The Government illegally arresting him by an arbitrary <QUOTE>general warrant,</QUOTE> he was committed to the Tower, and at once became the martyr of the people and the idol of the City. Released by Chief-Justice Pratt, he was next proceeded against for an obscene poem, the <title>Essay on Woman,</title> He fought a duel with Samuel Martin, a brother M.P., who had insulted him, and was expelled the House in <datestruct value="1764--"><year reg="1764">1764</year></datestruct>. He then went to France in the height of his popularity, having just obtained a verdict in his favour upon the question of the warrant. On his return to England, he daringly stood for the representation of London, and was elected for Middlesex. Riots took place, a man was shot by the soldiers, and Wilkes was committed to the King's Bench prison. After a long contest with the Commons, Wilkes was expelled the House, and being re-elected for Middlesex, the election was declared void.
<p>Eventually Wilkes became Chamberlain of the City, lectured refractory apprentices like a father, and tamed down to an ordinary man of the world, still shameless, ribald, irreligious, but, as Gibbon says, <QUOTE>a good companion with inexhaustible spirits, infinite wit and humour, and a great deal of knowledge.</QUOTE> He quietly took his seat for Middlesex in <datestruct value="1782--"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct>, and <num value="8">eight</num> years afterwards the resolutions against him were erased from the Journals of the House. He died in <datestruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>, at his house in Grosvenor Square. Wilkes' sallow face, sardonic squint, and projecting jaw, are familiar to us from Hogarth's terrible caricature. He generally wore the dress of a colonel of the militia-scarlet and buff, with a cocked hat and rosette, bag wig, and military boots, and O&lsquo;Keefe describes seeing him walking in from his house at Kensington Gore, disdaining all offers of a coach. Dr. Franklin, when in England, describes the mob stopping carriages, and compelling their inmates to shout <QUOTE>Wilkes and liberty</QUOTE> For the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="15">fifteen</num> miles out of London on the Winchester road, he says, and on nearly every door or window-shutter, <QUOTE>No. <num value="45">45</num></QUOTE> was chalked. By many Tory writers Wilkes is considered latterly to have turned his coat, but he seems to us to have been perfectly consistent to the end. He was always a Whig with aristocratic tastes. When oppression ceased he ceased to protest. Most men grow more Conservative as their minds weaken, but Wilkes was always resolute for liberty.
<p>A few anecdotes of Wilkes are necessary for seasoning to our chapter.
<p>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.410.2">Henry Tooke</lemma> having challenged Wilkes, who was then sheriff of London and Middlesex, received the following laconic reply: <QUOTE>Sir, I do not think it my business to cut the throat of every desperado that may be tired of his life; but as I am at present High Sheriff of the City of London, it may shortly happen that I shall have an opportunity of attending you in my civil capacity, in which case I will answer for it that <hi rend=italics>you shall have no ground</hi> to complain of my endeavours to serve you.</QUOTE> This is <num value="1">one</num> of the bitterest retorts ever uttered. Wilkes's notoriety led to his head being painted as a public-house sign, which, however, did not invariably raise the original in estimation. An old lady, in passing a public-house distinguished as above, her companion called her attention to the sign. <QUOTE>Ah</QUOTE> replied she, <QUOTE>Wilkes swings everywhere but where he ought.</QUOTE> Wilkes's squint was proverbial; yet even this natural obliquity he turned to humorous account. When Wilkes challenged Lord Townshend, he said, <QUOTE>Your lordship is <num value="1">one</num> of the handsomest men in the kingdom, and I am <num value="1">one</num> of the ugliest. Yet, give me but lalf an hour's start, and I <pb id="p.411" n="411"> will enter the lists against you with any woman you choose to name.</QUOTE>
<p>Once, when the house seemed resolved not to hear him, and a friend urged him to desist- <QUOTE>Speak,</QUOTE> he said, <QUOTE>I must, for my speech has been in print for the newspapers this half-hour.</QUOTE> Fortunately for him, he was gifted with a coolness and effrontery which were only equalled by his intrepidity, all <num value="3">three</num> of which qualities constantly served his turn in the hour of need. As an instance of his audacity, it may be stated that on <num value="1">one</num> occasion he and another person put forth, from a private room in a tavern, a proclamation commencing-- <QUOTE>We, the people of England,</QUOTE> &amp;c., and concluding-- <QUOTE>By order of the meeting.</QUOTE> Another amusing instance of his effrontery occurred on the hustings at Brentford, when he and Colonel Luttrell were standing there together as rival candidates for the representation of Middlesex in Parliament. Looking down with great apparent apathy on the sea of human beings, consisting chiefly of his own votaries and friends, which stretched beneath him-- <QUOTE>I wonder,</QUOTE> he whispered to his opponent, <QUOTE>whether among that crowd the fools or the knaves predominate?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>I will tell them what you say,</QUOTE> replied the astonished Luttrell, <QUOTE>and thus put an end to you.</QUOTE> Perceiving that Wilkes treated the threat with the most perfect indifference-- <QUOTE>Surely,</QUOTE> he added, <QUOTE>you don't mean to say you could stand here <num value="1">one</num> hour after I did so?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Why not?</QUOTE> replied Wilkes; <QUOTE>it is <hi rend=italics>you</hi> who would not be alive <num value="1">one</num> instant after.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>How so?</QUOTE> inquired Luttrell. <QUOTE>Because,</QUOTE> said Wilkes, <QUOTE>I should merely affirm that it was a fabrication, and they would destroy you in the twinkling of an eye.</QUOTE>
<p>During his latter days Wilkes not only became a courtier, but was a frequent attendant at the levees of George III. On <num value="1">one</num> of these occasions the King happened to inquire after his old friend <QUOTE>Sergeant Glynn,</QUOTE> who had been Wilkes's counsel during his former seditious proceedings. <QUOTE><hi rend=italics>My friend</hi>, sir!</QUOTE> replied Wilkes; <QUOTE>he is no friend of mine; he was a Wilkite, sir, which I never was.</QUOTE>
<p>He once dined with George IV. when Prince of Wales, when overhearing the Prince speak in rather disparaging language of his father, with whom he was then notoriously on bad terms, he seized an opportunity of proposing the health of the King. <QUOTE>Why, Wilkes,</QUOTE> said the Prince, <QUOTE>how long is it since you became so loyal?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Ever since, sir,</QUOTE> was the reply, <QUOTE>I had the honour of becoming acquainted with your Royal Highness.</QUOTE>
<p>Alderman Sawbridge (Framework Knitter), mayor in <datestruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct>, on his return from a state visit to Kew with all his retinue, was stopped and stripped by a single highwayman. The sword-bearer did not even attempt to hew down the robber.
<p>In <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, Alderman Kennet (Vintner) was mayor during the Gordon riots. He had been a waiter and then a wine merchant, was a coarse and ignorant man, and displayed great incompetence during the week the rioters literally held London. When he was summoned to the House, to be examined about the riots, <num value="1">one</num> of the members observed, <QUOTE>If you ring the bell, Kennet will come in, of course.</QUOTE> On being asked why he did not at the outset send for the <hi rend=italics>posse comitatus</hi>, he replied he did not know where the fellow lived, or else he would. <num value="1">One</num> evening at the Alderman's Club, he was sitting at whist, next Mr. Alderman Pugh, a soap-boiler. <QUOTE>Ring the bell, Soap-suds,</QUOTE> said Kennet. <QUOTE>Ring it yourself, Bar,</QUOTE> replied Pugh; <QUOTE>you have been twice as much used to it as I have.</QUOTE> There is no disgrace in having been a soap-boiler or a wine merchant; the true disgrace is to be ashamed of having carried on an honest business.
<p>Alderman Clarke (Joiner), mayor in <datestruct value="1784--"><year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct>, succeeded Wilkes as Chamberlain in <datestruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>, and died aged <num value="92">ninety-two</num>, in <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>. This City patriarch was, when a mere boy, introduced to Dr. Johnson by that insufferable man, Sir John Hawkins. He met r. Percy, Goldsmith, and Hawkesworth, with the Polyphemus of letters, at the <QUOTE>Mitre.</QUOTE> He was a member of the Essex Head Club. <QUOTE>When he was sheriff in <datestruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE> says Mr. Timbs, <QUOTE>he took Dr. Johnson to a judges' dinner at the Old Bailey, the judges being Blackstone and Eyre.</QUOTE> The portrait of Chamberlain Clarke, in the Court of Common Council in Guildhall, is by Sir Thomas Lawrence, and cost <num value="100">one hundred</num> guineas. There is also a bust of Mr. Clarke, by Sievier, at the Guildhall, which was paid for by a subscription of the City officers.
<p>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.411.1">Alderman Boydell, mayor</lemma> in <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>, we have described fully elsewhere. He presided over Cheap Ward for <num value="23">twenty-three</num> years. Nearly opposite his house, <num value="90">90</num>, Cheapside, is No. <num value="73">73</num>, which, before the present Mansion House was built, was used occasionally as the Lord Mayor's residence.
<p>Sir James Saunderson (Draper), from whose curious book of official expenses we quote in our chapter on the Mansion House, was mayor in <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>. It was this mayor who sent a posse of officers to disperse a radical meeting held at that <QUOTE>caldron of sedition,</QUOTE> Founders' Hall, and among the persons expelled was a young orator named Waithman, afterwards himself a mayor.
<p><datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>-<num value="6">6</num> was made pleasant to the Londoners by the abounding hospitality of Sir William Curtis, <pb id="p.412" n="412"> a portly baronet, who, while he delighted in a liberal feast and a cheerful glass, evidently thought them of small value unless shared by his friends. Many years afterwards, during the reign of George IV., whose good graces he had secured, he went to Scotland with the king, and made Edinburgh merry by wearing a kilt in public. The wits laughed at his costume, complete even to the little dagger in the stocking, but told him he had forgotten <num value="1">one</num> important thing--the spoon.
<p>In <datestruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>, Sir Benjamin Hamet was fined <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> for refusing to serve as mayor.

Among the members at Brookes's who indulged in high play was Combe, who is said to have made as much money in this way as he did by brewing. <num value="1">One</num> evening, whilst he filled the office of Lord Mayor, he was busy at a full hazard table at Brookes's, where the wit and dice-box circulated together with great glee, and where

<P>In <datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, Sir James Shaw (Scrivener), afterwards Chamberlain, was a native of Kilmarnock, where a marble statue of him has been erected.

 have taken wing in a unanimous covey, and settled down, for reasons now unknown to us, and not very material to any <num value="1">one</num>, in Gracious (Gracechurch) Street, and the end of St. Nicholas flesh shambles (now Newgate Market). Poultry was not worth its weight in silver then.
<p>The chief points of interest in the street (past and present) are the Compter Prison, Grocers' Hall, Old Jewry, and several shops with memorable associations. Lubbock's Banking House, for instance, is leased of the Goldsmiths' Company, being part of Sir Martin Bowes' bequest to the Company in Elizabeth's time. Sir Martin Bowes we have already mentioned in our chapter on the Goldsmiths' Company.
<p>The name of <num value="1">one</num> of our greatest English wits is indissolubly connected with the neighbourhood of the Poultry.

After the sudden death of the father, the widow and her children were left rather slenderly provided for. <QUOTE>My father, the only remaining son, preferred the drudgery of an engraver's desk to encroaching upon the small family store. He was articled to his uncle, Mr. Sands, and subsequently was transferred to <num value="1">one</num> of the Le Keux. He was a most devoted and excellent son to his mother, and the last days of her widowhood and decline were soothed by his tender care and affection. An opening that offered more congenial employment presented itself at last, when he was about the age of <num value="21">twenty-one</num>. By the death of Mr. John Scott, the editor of the  <Q>London Magazine,</Q>  who was killed in a duel, that periodical passed into other hands, and became the property of my father's friends, Messrs.

<p>The <QUOTE>King's Head</QUOTE> Tavern (No. <num value="25">25</num>) was kept at the Restoration by William King, a staunch cavalier.

Ned Ward, that coarse observer, in the <title>London Spy,</title> <datestruct value="1709--"><year reg="1709">1709</year></datestruct>, describes the <QUOTE>Rose,</QUOTE> anciently the <QUOTE>Rose and Crown,</QUOTE> as famous for good wine. <QUOTE>There was no parting,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>without a glass; so we went into the Rose Tavern in the Poultry, where the wine, according to its merit, had justly gained a reputation; and there, in a snug room, warmed with brush and faggot, over a quart of good claret, we laughed over our night's adventure. The tavern door was flanked by <num value="2">two</num> columns twisted with vines carved in wood, which supported a small square gallery over the portico, surrounded by handsome ironwork. On the front of this gallery was erected the sign. It consisted of a central compartment containing the Rose, behind which the artist had introduced a tall silver cup, called  <Q>a standing bowl,</Q>  with drinking glasses. Beneath the painting was this inscription:--

<p>The tavern was rebuilt after the Great Fire, and flourished many years. It was long a depot in the metropolis for turtle; and in the quadrangle of the tavern might be seen scores of turtle, large and lively, in huge'tanks of water; or laid upward on the stone floor, ready for their destination. The tavern was also noted for large dinners of the City Companies and other public bodies.

They discussed the emigration and nidification of birds, on which subjects Goldsmith seems to have been deeply interested; the bread-fruit of Otaheite, which Johnson, who had never tasted it, considered surpassed by a slice of the loaf before him; toleration, and the early martyrs. On this last subject, Dr. Mayo, <QUOTE>the literary anvil,</QUOTE> as he was called, because he bore Johnson's hardest blows without flinching, held out boldly for unlimited toleration; Johnson for Baxter's principle of only <QUOTE>tolerating all things that are tolerable,</QUOTE> which is no toleration at all.

A little coaxing, however, soon won him over; Johnson <pb id="p.419" n="419"> roared out, <QUOTE>Frank, a clean shirt!</QUOTE> and was soon packed into a hackney coach. On discovering <QUOTE>a certain gentleman in lace,</QUOTE> and he Wilkes the demagogue, Johnson was at <num value="1">first</num> somewhat disconcerted, but soon recovered himself, and behaved like a man of the world. Wilkes quickly won the great man.
<p>They soon set to work discussing Foote's wit, and Johnson confessed that, though resolved not to be pleased, he had once at a dinner-party been obliged to lay down his knife and fork, throw himself back in his chair, and fairly laugh it out- <QUOTE>The dog was so comical, sir: he was irresistible.</QUOTE> Wilkes and Johnson then fell to bantering the Scotch; Burke complimented Boswell on his successful stroke of diplomacy in bringing Johnson and Wilkes together.
<p>Mr. Wilkes placed himself next to Dr. Johnson, and behaved to him with so much attention and politeness, that he gained upon him insensibly. No man ate more heartily than Johnson, or loved better what was nice and delicate. Mr. Wilkes was very assiduous in helping him to some fine veal. <QUOTE>Pray give me leave, sir--it is better there --a little of the brown--some fat, sir--a little of the stuffing--some gravy--let me have the pleasure of giving you some butter--allow me to recommend a squeeze of this orange; or the lemon, perhaps, may have more zest.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Sir-sir, I am obliged to you, sir,</QUOTE> cried Johnson, bowing, and turning his head to him with a look for some time of <QUOTE>surly virtue,</QUOTE> but, in a short while, of complacency.
<p>But the most memorable evening recorded at Dilly's was <datestruct VALUE="1778-04-15"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=15>15</day>, <year reg=1778>1778</year></datestruct>, when Johnson and Boswell dined there, and met Miss Seward, the Lichfield poetess, and Mrs. Knowles, a clever Quaker lady, who for once overcame the giant of Bolt Court in argument. Before dinner Johnson took up a book, and read it ravenously. <QUOTE>He knows how to read it better,</QUOTE> said Mrs. Knowles to Boswell, <QUOTE>than any <num value="1">one</num>. He gets at the substance of a book directly. He tears out the heart of it.</QUOTE> At dinner Johnson told Dilly that, if he wrote a book on cookery, it should be based on philosophical principles. <QUOTE>Women,</QUOTE> he said, contemptuously, <QUOTE>can spin, but they cannot make a good book of cookery.</QUOTE>
<p>They then fell to talking of a ghost that had appeared at Newcastle, and had recommended some person to apply to an attorney. Johnson thought the Wesleys had not taken pains enough in collecting evidence, at which Miss Seward smiled. This vexed the superstitious sage of Fleet Street, and he said, with solemn vehemence, <QUOTE>Yes, ma'am, this is a question which, after <num value="5000">five thousand</num> years, is yet undecided; a question, whether in theology or philosophy, <num value="1">one</num> of the most important that can come before the human understanding.</QUOTE>
<p>Johnson, who during the evening had been very thunderous at intervals, breaking out against the Americans, describing them as <QUOTE>rascals, robbers, and pirates,</QUOTE> and declaring he would destroy them all--as Boswell says, <QUOTE>He roared out a tremendous volley which <num value="1">one</num> might fancy could be heard across the Atlantic,</QUOTE> &amp;c.--grew very angry at Mrs. Knowles for noticing his unkindness to Miss Jane Barry, a recent convert to Quakerism.
<p> <QUOTE>We remained,</QUOTE> says Boswell, writing with awe, like a man who has survived an earthquake, <QUOTE>together till it was very late. Notwithstanding occasional explosions of violence, we were all delighted upon the whole with Johnson.

<p>It was at this prison, in the reign of Charles I.,
<FIGURE id="Fig.421" n="2000.06.0155"><HEAD>The Poultry Compter. (From An Old Print.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 that Dr. Lamb, the conjurer, died, after being nearly torn to pieces by the mob. He was a creature of the Duke of Buckingham, and had been accused of bewitching Lord Windsor. On the <datestruct value="06-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct> Lamb was insulted in the City by a few boys, who soon after being increased by the acceding multitude, they surrounded him with bitter invectives, which obliged him to seek refuge in a tavern in the Old Jewry; but the tumult continuing to increase, the vintner, for his own safety, judged it proper to turn him out of the house, whereupon the mob renewed their exclamations against him, with the appellations of <QUOTE>wizard,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>conjuror,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>devil.</QUOTE> But at last, perceiving the approach of a guard, sent by the Lord Mayor <pb id="p.422" n="422"> to his rescue, they fell upon and beat the doctor in such a cruel and barbarous manner, that he was by the said guard taken up for dead, and carried to the Compter, where he soon after expired. <QUOTE>But the author of a treatise, entitled  <Q>The Forfeiture of the City Charters,</Q> </QUOTE> says Maitland, <QUOTE><p>gives a different account of this affair, and, fixing the scene of this tragedy on the <datestruct value="07-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, writes, that as the doctor passed through Cheapside, he was attacked as above mentioned, which forced him to seek a retreat down Wood Street, and that he was there screened from the fury of the mob in a house, till they had broken all the windows, and forced the door; and then, no help coming to the relief of the doctor, the housekeeper was obliged to deliver him up to save the spoiling of his goods.
<p>When the rabble had got him into their hands, some took him by the legs, and others by the arms, and so dragging him along the streets, cried,  <Q>Lamb, Lamb, the conjuror, the conjuror!</Q>  every <num value="1">one</num> kicking and striking him that were nearest.
<p>Whilst this tumult lasted, and the City was in an uproar, the news of what had passed came to the king's ear, who immediately ordered his guards to make ready, and, taking some of the chief nobility, he came in person to appease the tumult. In St. Paul's Churchyard he met the inhuman villains dragging the doctor along; and after <Q> the knightmarshal had proclaimed silence, who was but ill obeyed, the king, like a good prince, mildly exhorted and persuaded them to keep his peace, and deliver up the doctor to be tried according to law; and that if his offence, which they charged him with, should appear, he should be punished accordingly; commanding them to disperse and depart every man</Q>  to his own home. But the insolent varlets answered, that <hi rend=italics>they had judged him already</hi>; and thereupon pulled him limb from limb; or, at least, so dislocated his joints, that he instantly died.</QUOTE>

<p>This took place just before the Duke of Buckingham's assassination by Felton, in <datestruct value="1628--"><year reg="1628">1628</year></datestruct>. The king, very much enraged at the treatment of Lamb, and the non-discovery of the real offenders, extorted a fine of <measure value="6000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="6000">6,000</num></measure> from the abashed City.
<p>Dekker, the dramatist, was thrown into this prison. This poet of the great Elizabethan race was <num value="1">one</num> of Ben Jonson's great rivals. He thus rails at Shakespeare's special friend, who had made <QUOTE>a supplication to be a poor journeyman player, and hadst been still so, but that thou couldst not set <hi rend=italics>a goad face</hi> upon it. Thou hast forgot how thou ambled'st in leather-pilch, by a play-waggon in the highway; and took'st mad Jeronimo's part, to get service among the mimics,</QUOTE> &amp;c.
<p>Dekker thus delineates Ben : <QUOTE>That same Horace has the most ungodly face, by my fan; it looks for all the world like a rotten russet apple, when &lsquo;tis bruised. It's better than a spoonful of cinnamon water next my heart, for me to hear him speak; he sounds it so i&lsquo; th&lsquo; nose, and talks and rants like the poor fellows under Ludgate--to see his face make faces, when he reads his songs and sonnets.</QUOTE>
<p>Again, we have Ben's face compared with that of his favourite, Horace's- <QUOTE>You staring Leviathan! Look on the sweet visage of Horace; look, parboil'd face, look--has he not his face punchtfull of eylet-holes, like the cover of a warming-pan?</QUOTE>
<p>Ben Jonson's manner in a play-house is thus sketched by Dekker:-- <QUOTE>Not to hang himself, even if he thought any man could write plays as well as himself; not to bombast out a new play with the old linings of jests stolen from the Temple's revels; not to sit in a gallery where your comedies have entered their actions, and there make vile and bad faces at every line, to make men have an eye to you, and to make players afraid; not to venture on the stage when your play is ended, and exchange courtesies and compliments with gallants, to make all the house rise and cry- <Q>That's Horace! That's he that pens and purges humours!</Q> </QUOTE>
<p>But, notwithstanding all his bitterness, Dekker could speak generously of the old poet; for he thus sums up Ben Jonson's merits in the following lines :--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Good Horace! No! My cheeks do blush for thine,
<L>As often as thou speakest so; where <num value="1">one</num> true
<L>And nobly virtuous spirit for thy best part
<L>Loves thee, I wish <num value="1">one</num>, <num value="10">ten</num>; even from my heart!
<L>I make account, I put up as deep share
<L>In any good man's love, which thy worth earns,
<L>As thou thyself; we envy not to see
<L>Thy friends with bays to crowl thy poesy.
<L>No, here the gall lies ;--we, that know what stuff
<L>Thy very heart is made of, know the stalk
<L>On which thy learning grows, and can give life
<L>To thy <num value="1">one</num> dying baseness; yet must we
<L>Dance anticks on your paper.
<L>But were thy warp'd soul put in a new mould,
<L>I'd wear thee as a jewel set in gold.</QUOTE>

<p>Charles Lamb, speaking of Dekker's share in Massinger's <title>Virgin Martyr</title>, highly eulogises the impecunious poet. <QUOTE>This play,</QUOTE> says Lamb, <QUOTE>has some beauties of so very high an order, that with all my respect for Massinger, I do not think he had poetical enthusiasm capable of rising up to them. His associate, Dekker, who wrote <title>Old Fortunatus</title>, had poetry enough for anything. The very impurities which obtrude themselves among the sweet pictures of this play, like Satan among the sons of Heaven, have a strength of contrast, a <pb id="p.423" n="423"> raciness, and a glow in them, which are beyond Massinger. They are to the religion of the rest what Caliban is to Miranda.</QUOTE>

The ill-looking vermin, with long, rusty beards, swaddled up in rags, and their heads--some covered with thrum-caps, and others thrust into the tops of old stockings. Some quitted their play they were before engaged in, and came hovering round us, like so many cannibals, with such devouring countenances, as if a man had been but a morsel with &lsquo;em, all crying out,  <Q>Garnish, garnish,</Q>  as a rabble in an insurrection crying,  <Q>Liberty, liberty!</Q>  We were forced to submit to the doctrine of nonresistance, and comply with their demands, which extended to the sum of <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> each.</QUOTE>
<p>The Poultry Compter has a special historical interest, from the fact of its being connected with the early struggles of our philanthropists against the slave-trade. It was here that several of the slaves released by Granville Sharp's noble exertions were confined. This excellent man, and true aggressive Christian, was grandson of an Archbishop of York, and son of a learned Northumberland rector. Though brought up to the bar, he never practised, and resigned a place in the Ordnance Office because he could not conscientiously approve of the American War. He lived a bachelor life in the Temple, doing good continually. Sharp opposed the impressment of sailors and the system of duelling; encouraged the distribution of the Bible, and advocated parliamentary reform. But it was as an enemy to slavery, and the <num value="1">first</num> practical opposer of its injustice and its cruelties, that Granville Sharp earned a foremost place in the great bede-roll of our English philanthropists. Mr. Sharp's <num value="1">first</num> interference in behalf of persecuted slaves was in <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>.
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1765"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, says Clarkson, in his work on slavery, a Mr. David Lisle had brought over from Barbadoes Jonathan Strong, an African slave, as his servant. He used the latter in a barbarous manner at his lodgings, in Wapping, but particularly by beating him over the head with a pistol, which occasioned his head to swell. When the swelling went down a disorder fell into his eyes, which threatened the loss of them. To this a fever and ague succeeded; and he was affected with a lameness in both his legs.
<p>Jonathan Strong having been brought into this deplorable condition, and being therefore wholly useless, was left by his master to go whither he pleased. He applied, accordingly, to Mr. William Sharp, the surgeon, for his advice, as to <num value="1">one</num> who gave up a portion of his time to the healing of the diseases of the poor. It was here that Mr. Granville Sharp, the brother of the former, saw him. Suffice it to say that in process of time he was cured. During this time Mr. Granville Sharp, pitying his hard case, supplied him with money, and afterwards got him a situation in the family of Mr. Brown, an apothecary, to carry out medicines.
<p>In this new situation, when Strong had become healthy and robust in his appearance, his master happened to see him. The latter immediately formed the design of possessing him again. Accordingly, when he had found out his residence, he procured John Ross, keeper of the Poultry Compter, and William Miller, an officer under the Lord Mayor, to kidnap him. This was done by sending for him to a public-house in Fenchurch Street, and then seizing him. By these he was conveyed, without any warrant, to the Poultry Compter, where he was sold by his master to John Kerr for <measure value="30l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30">30</num></measure>. Mr. Sharp, immediately upon this, waited upon Sir Robert Kite, the then Lord Mayor, and entreated him to send for Strong and to hear his case. A day was accordingly appointed, Mr. Sharp attended, also William M&lsquo;Bean, a notary public, and David Laird, captain of the ship
<hi rend=italics>Thames</hi>, which was to have conveyed Strong to Jamaica, in behalf of the purchaser, John Kerr. A long conversation ensued, in which the opinion of York and Talbot was quoted. Mr. Sharp made his observations. Certain lawyers who were present seemed to be staggered at the case, but inclined rather to re-commit the prisoner. The Lord Mayor, however, discharged Strong, as he had been taken up without a warrant.
<p>As soon as this determination was made known, the parties began to move off. Captain Laird, however, who kept close to Strong, laid hold of him before he had quitted the room, and said aloud, <QUOTE>Then now I seize him as my slave.</QUOTE> Upon this Mr. Sharp put his hand upon Laird's shoulder, and pronounced these words, <QUOTE>I charge you, in the name of the king, with an assault upon the person of Jonathan Strong, and all these are my witnesses.</QUOTE> Laird was greatly intimidated by this charge, made in the presence of the Lord Mayor and others, and fearing a prosecution, let his prisoner go, leaving him to be conveyed away by Mr. Sharp. <pb id="p.424" n="424">
<p>But the great turning case was that of James Somerset, in <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>. James Somerset, an African slave, had been brought to England by his master, Charles Stewart, in <datestruct VALUE="1769-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1769">1769</year></datestruct>. Somerset, in process of time, left him. Stewart took an opportunity of seizing him, and had him conveyed on board the <hi rend=italics>Ann and Mary</hi>, Captain Knowles, to be carried out of the kingdom and sold as a slave in Jamaica. The question raised was, <QUOTE>Whether a slave, by coming into England, became free?</QUOTE>
<p>In order that time might be given for ascertaining the law fully on this head, the case was argued at <num value="3">three</num> different sittings-<num value="1">first</num>, in <datestruct VALUE="1772-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>; secondly, in <datestruct VALUE="1772-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>; and thirdly, in <datestruct VALUE="1772-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>. And that no decision otherwise than what the law warranted might be given, the opinion of the judges was taken upon the pleadings. The great and glorious issue of the trial was, <QUOTE>That as soon as ever any slave set his foot upon English territory he became free.</QUOTE>
<p>Thus ended the great case of Somerset, which, having been determined after so deliberate an investigation of the law, can never be reversed while the British Constitution remains. The eloquence displayed in it by those who were engaged on the side of liberty was perhaps never exceeded on any occasion; and the names of the counsellors, Davy, Glynn, Hargrave, Mansfield, and Alleyne, ought always to be remembered with gratitude by the friends of this great cause.
<p>It was after this verdict that Cowper wrote the following beautiful lines:--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs
<L>Imbibe our air, that moment they are free;
<L>They touch our country, and their shackles fall.
<L>That's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud
<L>And jealous of the blessing. Spread on, then,
<L>And let it circulate through every vein
<L>Of all your empire, that where Britain's power
<L>Is felt, mankind may feel her mercy too.</QUOTE>

<p>It was in this Compter that Boyse, a true type of the Grub Street poet of Dr. Johnson's time, spent many of the latter days of his life. In the year <datestruct value="1740"><year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct> Boyse was reduced to the lowest state of poverty, having no clothes left in which he could appear abroad; and what bare subsistence he procured was by writing occasional poems for the magazines. Of the disposition of his apparel Mr. Nichols received from Dr. Johnson, who knew him well, the following account. He used to pawn what he had of this sort, and it was no sooner redeemed by his friends, than pawned again. On <num value="1">one</num> occasion Dr. Johnson collected a sum of money<NOTE> <QUOTE>The sum,</QUOTE> said Johnson, <QUOTE>was collected by sixpences, at a time when to me sixpence was a serious consideration.</QUOTE> </NOTE>
 for this purpose, and in <num value="2">two</num> days the clothes were pawned again. In this state Boyse remained in bed with no other covering than a blanket with <num value="2">two</num> holes, through which he passed his arms when he sat up to write. The author of his life in Cibber adds, that when his distresses were so pressing as to induce him to dispose of his shirt, he used to cut some white paper in slips, which he tied round his wrists, and in the same manner supplied his neck. In this plight he frequently appeared abroad, while his other apparel was scarcely sufficient for the purposes of decency.
<p>In the month of <datestruct VALUE="1749-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1749">1749</year></datestruct>, Boyse died in obscure lodgings near Shoe Lane. Anold acquaintance of his endeavoured to collect money to defray the expenses of his funeral, so that the scandal of being buried by the parish might be avoided. But his endeavours were in vain, for the persons he had selected had been so otten troubled with applications during the life of this unhappy man, that they refused to contribute anything towards his funeral.
<p>Of Boyse's best poems <QUOTE>The Deity</QUOTE> contains some vigorous lines, of which the following are a favourable specimen:--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=stanza><L>Transcendent pow'r! sole arbiter of fate!
<L>How great thy glory! and thy bliss how great,

<L>Unnumbered creatures draw their smiling birth,
<L>To bless the heav'ns or beautify the earth;
<L>While systems roll, obedient to thy view,
<L>And worlds rejoice--which Newton never knew!</LG><LG>

<L>Below, thro&lsquo; different forms does matter range,
<L>And life subsists from elemental change,
<L>Liquids condensing shapes terrestrial wear,
<L>Earth mounts in fire, and fire dissolves in air;
<L>While we, inquiring phantoms of a day,
<L>Inconstant as the shadows we survey!
<L>With them along Time's rapid current pass,
<L>And haste to mingle with the parent mass;

<L>In youth immortal shalt for ever shine!
<L>No change shall darken thy exalted name,

</LIST></ARGUMENT>



<P>The Old Jewry was the Ghetto of mediaeval London. The Rev. Moses Margoliouth, in his interesting <title>History of the Jews in Great Britain,</title>
has clearly shown that Jews resided in England during the Saxon times, by an edict published by Elgbright, Archbishop of York, A.D. <datestruct value="470"><year reg="470">470</year></datestruct>, forbidding Christians to attend the Jewish feasts. It appears the Jews sometimes left lands to the abbeys; and in the laws of Edward the Confessor we find them especially mentioned as under the king's guard and protection.
<P>The Conqueror invited over many Jews from Rouen, who settled themselves chiefly in London, Stamford, and Oxford. In London the Jews had <num value="2">two</num> colonies-<num value="1">one</num> in Old Jewry, near King Offa's old palace; and <num value="1">one</num> in the liberties of the Tower. Rufus, in his cynical way, marked his hatred of the monks by summoning a convocation, where English bishops met Jewish rabbis, and held a religious controversy, Rufus swearing by St. Luke's face that if the rabbis had the best of it, he would turn Jew at once. In this reign the Jews were so powerful at Oxford that they let <num value="3">three</num> halls--Lombard Hall, Moses Hall, and Jacob Hall--to students; and their rabbis instructed even Christian students in their synagogue. Jews took care of vacant benefices for the king. In the reign of Henry I. the Jews began to make proselytes, and monks were sent to several towns to preach against them. Halcyon times! With the reign of Stephen, however, began the storms, and, with the clergy, the usurper persecuted the Jews, exacting a fine of <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure> from those of London alone for a pretended manslaughter. The absurd story of the Jews murdering young children, to anoint Israelites or to raise devils with their blood, originated in this reign.
<P>Henry II. was equally ruthless, though he did, grant Jews cemeteries outside the towns. Up till this time the London Jews had only been allowed to bury in <QUOTE>the Jews' garden,</QUOTE> in the parish of St. Giles's, Cripplegate. In spite of frequent fines and banishments, their historian owns that altogether they throve in this reign, and their physicians were held in high repute. With Richard I., chivalrous to all else, began the real miseries of the English Jews. Even on the day of his coronation there was a massacre of the Jews, and many of their houses were burnt. <num value="2000">Two thousand</num> Jews were murdered at York, and at Lynn and Stamford they were also plundered. On his return from Palestine Richard established a tribunal for Jews. In the early part of John's reign he treated the moneylenders, whom he wanted to use, with consideration. He granted them a charter, and allowed them to choose their own chief rabbi. He also allowed them to try all their own causes which did not concern pleas of the Crown; and all this justice only cost the English Jews <measure value="4000bmark" type=currency><num value="4000">4,000</num> marks</measure>, for John was poor. His greed soon broke loose. In <datestruct value="1210--"><year reg="1210">1210</year></datestruct> he levied on the Jews <measure value="66000bmark" type=currency><num value="66000">66,000</num> marks</measure>, and imprisoned, blinded, and tortured all who did not readily pay. The king's last act of inhumanity was to compel some Jews to torture and put to death a great number of Scotch prisoners who had assisted the barons. Can we wonder that it is still a proverb among the English Jews, <QUOTE>Thank God that there was only <num value="1">one</num> King John?</QUOTE>
<P>The regent of the early part of the reign of Henry III. protected the Jews, and exempted them from the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts, but they were compelled to wear on their breasts <num value="2">two</num> white tablets of linen or parchment, <num value="2">two</num> inches broad and <num value="4">four</num> inches long; and twentyfour burgesses were chosen in every town where they resided, to protect them from the insults of pilgrims; for the clergy still treated them as excommunicated infidels. But even this lull was short-persecution soon again broke out. In the <num value="14">14th</num> of Henry III. the Crown seized a <num value="3">third</num> part of all their movables, and their new synagogue in the Old Jewry was granted to the brothers of St. Anthony of Vienna, and turned into a church. In the <num value="17">17th</num> of Henry III. the Jews were again taxed to the amount of <num value="18000">18,000</num> silver marks. At the same time the king erected an institution in New Street (Chancery Lane) for Jewish converts, as an atonement for his father's cruelty to the persecuted exiles. <num value="4">Four</num> Jews of Norwich having been dragged at horses' tails and hung, on a pretended charge of <pb id="p.426" n="426"> circumcising a Christian boy, led to new persecution, and the Jews were driven out of Newcastle and Southampton; while to defray the expense of entertaining the Queen's foreign uncles <measure value="20000bmark" type=currency><num value="20000">20,000</num> marks</measure> were exacted from the suffering race. In the <num value="19">19th</num> year of his reign Henry, driven hard for money, extorted from the rich Jews <num value="10">10</num>, more marks, and several were burned alive for plotting to destroy London by fire. The more absurd the accusation the more eagerly it was believed by a superstitious and frightened rabble. In <datestruct value="1244--"><year reg="1244">1244</year></datestruct>, Matthew of Paris says, the corpse of a child was found buried in London, on whose arms and legs were traced Hebrew inscriptions. It was supposed that the Jews had crucified this child, in ridicule of the crucifixion of Christ. The converted Jews of
<FIGURE id="Fig.426" n="2000.06.0156"><HEAD>Richard Porson. (From An Authentic Portrait.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 New Street were called in to read the Hebrew letters, and the canons of St. Paul's took the child's body, which was supposed to have wrought miracles, and buried it with great ceremony not far from their great altar. In order to defray the expenses of his brother Richard's marriage the, poor Jews of London were heavily mulcted, and Aaron of York, a man of boundless wealth, was forced to pay <measure value="4000bmark" type=currency><num value="4000">4,000</num> marks</measure> of silver and <num value="400">400</num> of gold. Defaulters were transported to Ireland, a punishment especially dreaded by the Jews. A tax called Jews' alms was also sternly enforced; and we find Lucretia, widow of David, an Oxford Jew, actually compelled to pay <measure value="2590l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2590">2,590</num></measure> towards the rebuilding of Westminster Abbey. It was about this time that Abraham, a Jew of <pb id="p.427" n="427"> Berkhampstead, strangled his wife, who had refused to help him to defile and deface an image of the Virgin, and was thrown into a dungeon of the Tower; but the murderer escaped, by a present of <measure value="7000bmark" type=currency><num value="7000">7,000</num> marks</measure> to the king. Tormented by the king's incessant exactions, the Jews at last implored leave to quit England before their very skins were taken from them. The king broke into a fit of almost ludicrous rage. He had been tender of their welfare, he said to his brother Richard. <QUOTE>Is it to be marvelled at,</QUOTE> he cried, <QUOTE>that I covet money? It is a horrible thing to imagine the debts wherein I am held bound. By the head of God, they amount to the sum of <measure value="200000bmark" type=currency><num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> marks</measure>; and if I should say <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num>, I should not exceed the
<FIGURE id="Fig.427" n="2000.06.0157"><HEAD>Sir R. Clayton's House, Garden Front. (From An Old Print.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 bounds of truth. I am deceived on every hand; I am a maimed and abridged king-yea, now only half a king. There is a necessity for me to have money, gotten from what place soever, and from whomsoever.</QUOTE>
<p>The king, on Richard's promise to obtain him money, sold him the right which he held over the Jews. Soon after this, <num value="86">eighty-six</num> of the richest Jews of London were hung, on a charge of having crucified a Christian child at Lincoln, and twentythree others were thrown into the Tower. Truly Old Jewry must have often heard the voice of Rachel weeping for her children. Their persecutors never grew weary. In a great riot, encouraged by the barons, the great bell of St. Paul's tolled out, <num value="500">500</num> Jews were killed in London, and the synagogue <pb id="p.428" n="428"> burnt, the leader of the mob, John Fitz-John, a baron, running Rabbi Abraham, the richest Jew in London, through with his sword. On the defeat of the king's party at the battle of Lewes, the London mob accusing the Jews of aiding the king, plundered their houses, and all the Israelites would have perished, had they not taken refuge in the Tower. By royal edict the Christians were forbidden to buy flesh of a Jew, and no Jew was allowed to employ Christian nurses, bakers, brewers, or cooks. Towards the close of Henry's life the synagogue in Old Jewry was again taken from the Jews, and given to the Friars Penitent, whose chapel stood hard by, and who complained of the noise of the Jewish congregation; but the king permitted another synagogue to be built in a more suitable place. Henry then ordered the Jews to pay up all arrears of tallages within <num value="4">four</num> months, and half of the sum in <num value="17">seventeen</num> days. The Tower of London was naturally soon full of grey-bearded Jewish debtors.
<p>No wonder, with all these persecutions, that the Chancery Lane house of converts began soon to fill. <QUOTE>On <num value="1">one</num> of the rolls of this reign,</QUOTE> says Mr. Margoliouth, probably quoting Prynne's famous diatribe against the Jews, <QUOTE>about <num value="500">500</num> names of Jewish converts are registered.</QUOTE> From the <num value="50">50th</num> year of Henry III. to the <num value="2">2nd</num> of Edward I., the Crown, says Coke, extorted from the English Jews no less than <measure value="420000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="420000">420,000</num></measure> <measure value="15s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="15">15</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure>!
<p>Edward I. was more merciful. In a statute, however, which was passed in his <num value="3">third</num> year, he forbade Jews practising usury, required them to wear badges of yellow taffety, as a distinguishing mark of their nationality, and demanded from each of them threepence every Easter. Then began the plunder. The king wanted money to build Carnarvon and Conway castles, to be held as fortresses against the Welsh, whom he had just recently conquered and treated with great cruelty, and the Jews were robbed accordingly. It was pot difficult in those days to find an excuse for extortion if the royal exchequer was empty. In the <num value="7">7th</num> year of Edward no less than <num value="294">294</num> Jews were put to death for clipping money, and all they possessed seized by the king. In his <num value="17">17th</num> year all the Jews in England were imprisoned in <num value="1">one</num> night, as Selden proves by an old Hebrew inscription found at Winchester, and not released till they had paid <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure> of silver for a ransom. At last, in the year <datestruct value="1290"><year reg="1290">1290</year></datestruct>, came the Jews' final expulsion from England, when <num value="15000">15,000</num> or <num value="6000">6,000</num> of these tormented exiles left our shores, not to return till Cromwell set the <num value="1">first</num> great example of toleration. Edward allowed the Jews to take with them part of their money and movables, but seized their houses and other possessions. All their outstanding mortgages were forfeited to the Crown, and ships were to be provided for their conveyance to such places within reasonable distance as they might choose. In spite of this, however, many, through the treachery of the sailors, were left behind'in England, and were all put to death with great cruelty.
<p> <QUOTE>Whole rolls full of patents relative to Jewish estates,</QUOTE> says Mr. Margoliduth, <QUOTE>are still to be seen at the Tower, which estates, together with their rent in fee, permissions, and mortgages, were all seized by the king.</QUOTE> Old Jewry, and Jewin Street, Aldersgate, where their burial-ground was, still preserve a dim memory of their residence among us. There used to be a tradition in England that the Jews buried much of their treasure here, in hopes of a speedy return to the land where they had suffered so much, yet where they had thriven. In spite of the edict of'banishment a few converted Jews continued to reside in England, and after the Reformation some unconverted Jews ventured to return. Rodrigo Lopez, a physician of Queen Elizabeth's, for instance, was, a Jew. He was tortured to death for being accused of designing to,.poison the Queen.
<p>No. <num value="8">8</num>, Old Jewry was the house of Sir Robert Clayton, Lord Mayor in the time of Charles II. It was a fine brick mansion, and <num value="1">one</num> of the grandest'houses in the street. It is mentioned by Evelyn in the following terms:-- <QUOTE><datestruct VALUE="1672-09-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>.-I carried with me to dinner my Lord H. Howard (now to be made Earl of Norwich and Earl Marshal of England) to Sir Robert Clayton's, now Sheriff of London, at his own house, where we had a great feast; it is built, indeed, for a great magistrate,--at excessive cost. The cedar diningroom is painted with the history of the Giants' war, incomparably done by Mr. Streeter, but the figures are too near the eye.</QUOTE> We give on the previous page a view of the garden front of this house, taken from an old print. Sir Robert built the house to keep his shrievalty, which he did with great magnificence. It was for some years the residence of Mr. Samuel Sharp, an eminent surveyor.
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1805"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct> was established, by a proprietary in the City, the London Institution, <QUOTE>for the advancement of literature and the diffusion of useful: knowledge.</QUOTE> This institution was temporarily located in Sir Robert Clayton's famous old house. Upon the <num value="1">first</num> committee of the institution were Mr. R. Angerstein and Mr. Richard Sharp. Porson, the famous Greek scholar and editor of Euripides, was thought an eligible man to be its principal librarian. He was accordingly appointed tothe <pb id="p.429" n="429"> office by a unanimous resolution of the governors; and Mr. Sharp had the gratification of announcing to the Professor his appointment. His friends rejoiced. Professor Young, of Glasgow, writing to Burney about this time, says: <QUOTE>Of Devil Dick you say nothing. I see by the newspapers they have given him a post. A handsome salary, I hope, a suite of chambers, coal and candle, &amp;c. Porter and cyder, I trust, are among the
<foreign lang=la>et caeteras</foreign>.</QUOTE> His salary was <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure> a year, with a suite of rooms. Still, Porson was not just the man for a librarian; for no <num value="1">one</num> could use books more roughly. He had no affectation about books, nor, indeed, affectation of any sort. The late Mr. William Upcott, who urged the publication of Evelyn's diary at Wootton, was fellow-secretary with Porson. The institution removed to King's Arms Yard, Coleman Street, in <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, and thence in <datestruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></datestruct> to the
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.429.1">present handsome mansion</lemma> erected from the classic design of Mr. W. Brooks, on the north side of Moorfields, now Finsbury Circus.
<p>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.429.2">The library</lemma> is <QUOTE><num value="1">one</num> of the most useful and accessible in Great Britain;</QUOTE> and Mr. Watson found in a few of the books Porson's handwriting, consisting of critical remarks and notes. In a copy of the Aldine <title>Herodotus,</title> he has marked the chapters in the margin in Arabic numerals <QUOTE>with such nicety and regularity,</QUOTE> says his biographer, <QUOTE>that the eye of the reader, unless upon the closest examination, takes them for print.</QUOTE>
<p>Lord Byron remembered Porson at Cambridge; in the hall where he himself dined, at the Vice- Chancellor's table, and Porson at the Dean's, he always appeared sober in his demeanour, nor was he guilty,as far as his lordship knew, of any excess or outrage in public; but in an evening, with a party of undergraduates, he would, in fits of intoxication, get into violent disputes with the young men, and arrogantly revile them for not knowing what he thought they might be expected to know. He once went away in disgust, because none of them knew the name of <QUOTE>the Cobbler of Messina.</QUOTE> In this condition Byron had seen him at the rooms of William Bankes, the Nubian discoverer, where he would pour forth whole pages of various languages, and distinguish himself especially by his copious floods of Greek.
<p>Lord Byron further tells us that he had seen Sheridan <QUOTE>drunk, with all the world; his intoxication was that of Bacchus, but Porson's that of Silenus. Of all the disgusting brutes, sulky, abusive, and intolerable, Porson was the most bestial, so far as the few times that I saw him went, which were only at William Bankes's rooms. He was tolerated in this state among the young men for his talents, as the Turks think a madman inspired, and bear with him. He used to write, or rather vomit, pages of all languages, and could hiccup Greek like a Helot; and certainly Sparta never shocked her children with a grosser exhibition than this man's intoxication.</QUOTE>
<P>The library of the institution appears, however, to have derived little advantage from Porson's supervision of it, beyond the few criticisms which were found in his handwriting in some of the volumes. Owing to his very irregular habits, the great scholar proved but an inefficient librarian; he was irregular in attendance, and was frequently brught home at midnight drunk. The directors had determined to dismiss him, and said they only knew him as their librarian from seeing his name attached to receipts of salary. Indeed, he was already breaking up, and his stupendous memory had begun to fail. On the <datestruct VALUE="1806-09-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, he left the Old Jewry to call on his brother-in-law, Perry, in the Strand, and at the corner of Northumberland Street was struck down by a fit of apoplexy. He was carried over to the St. Martin's Lane workhouse, and there slowly recovered consciousness. Mr. Savage, the under-librarian, seeing an advertisement in the
<title>British Press</title>, describing a person picked up, having Greek memoranda in his pocket, went to the workhouse and brought Porson home in a hackney coach; he talked about the fire which the night before had destroyed Covent Garden Theatre, and as they rounded St. Paul's, remarked upon the ill treatment Wren had received. On reaching the Old Jewry, and after he had breakfasted, Dr. Adam Clarke called and had a conversation with Porson about a stone with a Greek inscription, brought from Ephesus; he also discussed a Mosaic pavement recently found in Palestrini, and quoted <num value="2">two</num> lines from the Greek Anthologia. Dr. Adam Clarke particularly noticed that he gave the Greek rapidly, but the English with painful slowness, as if the Greek came more naturally. Then, apparently fancying himself under restraint, he walked out, and went into the African or Cole's coffee-house in St. Michael's Alley, Cornhill; there he would have fallen had he not caught hold of <num value="1">one</num> of the brass rods of the boxes. Some wine and some jelly dissolved in brandy and water considerably roused him, but he could hardly speak, and the waiter took him back to the Institution in a coach. He expired exactly as the clock struck <num value="12">twelve</num>, on the night of Sunday, <datestruct VALUE="1808-09-25"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=25>25</day>, <year reg=1808>1808</year></datestruct>. He was buried in the Chapel of Trinity College, Cambridge, and eulogies of his talent, written in Greek and Latin verse, were affixed to his pall--an old <pb id="p.430" n="430"> custom not discontinued till <datestruct value="1822"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>. His books fetched <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure>, and those with manuscript notes were bought by Trinity College. It was said of Porson that he drank everything he could lay his hands upon, even to embrocation and spirits of wine intended for the lamp. Rogers describes him going back into the dining-room after the people had gone, and drinking all that was left in the glasses. He once undertook to learn by heart, in a week, a copy of the <title>Morning Chronicle</title>, and he boasted he could repeat <title>Roderick Random</title> from beginning to end.
<p>Mr. Luard describes Porson as being, in personal appearance, tall; his head very fine, with an expansive forehead, over which he plastered his brown hair; he had a long, Roman nose (it ought to have been Greek), and his eyes were remarkably keen and penetrating. In general he was very careless as to his dress, especially when alone in his chamber, or when reading hard; but <QUOTE>when in his gala costume, a smart blue coat, white vest, black satin nether garments, and silk stockings, with a shirt ruffled at the wrists, he looked quite the gentleman.</QUOTE>
<p>The street where, in <datestruct value="1261--"><year reg="1261">1261</year></datestruct>, many Jews were massacred, and where again, in <datestruct value="1264--"><year reg="1264">1264</year></datestruct>, <num value="500">500</num> Jews were slain, was much affected by Nonconformists. There was a Baptist chapel here in the Puritan times; and in Queen Anne's reign the Presbyterians built a spacious church, in Meeting House Court, in <datestruct value="1701--"><year reg="1701">1701</year></datestruct>. It is described as occupying an area of <num value="2600">2,600</num> square feet, and being lit with <num value="6">six</num> bow windows. The society, says Mr. Pike, had been formed <num value="40">forty</num> years before, by the son of the excellent Calamy, the persecuted vicar of Aldermanbury, who is said to have died from grief at the Fire of London. John Shower was <num value="1">one</num> of the most celebrated ministers of the Old Jewry Chapel. He wrote a protest against the Occasional Conformity Bill, to which Swift (under the name of his friend Harley) penned a bitter reply. He died in <datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct>. From <datestruct value="1691--"><year reg="1691">1691</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct> the assistant lecturer was Timothy Rogers, son of an ejected Cumberland minister, of whom an interesting story is told. Sir Richard Cradock, a High Church justice, had arrested Mr. Rogers and all his flock, and was about to send them to prison, when the justice's granddaughter, a wilful child of <num value="7">seven</num>, pitying the old preacher, threatened to drown herself if the poor people were punished. The preacher blessed her, and they parted. Years after this child, being in London, dreamed of a certain chapel, preacher, and text, and the next day, going to the Old Jewry, saw Mr. Shower, and recognised him as the preacher of her dream. The lady afterwards told this to Mr. Rogers' son, when the lad turned Dissenter. Like many other of the early Nonconformist preachers, Rogers seems to have been a hypochondriac, who looked upon himself as <QUOTE>a broken vessel, a dead man out of mind,</QUOTE> and eventually gave up his profession. Shower's successor, Simon Browne, wrote a volume of <title>Hymns,</title>
compiled a lexicon, and wrote a <title>Defence of the Christian Revelation,</title> in reply to Woolston and other Freethinkers. Browne was also a victim to delusions, believing that God, in his displeasure, had withdrawn his soul from his body. This state of mind is said by some to have arisen from a nervous shock Browne had once received in finding a highwayman with whom he had grappled dead in his grasp. He believed his mind entirely gone, and his head to resemble a parrot's. At times his thoughts turned to self-destruction. He therefore abandoned his pulpit, and retired to Shepton Mallet to study. His <title>Defence</title> is dedicated to Queen Caroline as from <QUOTE>a thing.</QUOTE>
<p>Samuel Chandler, a celebrated author and divine, and a friend of Butler and Secker, and Bowyer the printer, was for <num value="40">forty</num> years another Old Jewry worthy. He lectured against Popery with great success at Salters' Hall, and held a public dispute with a Romish priest at the <title>Pope's Head,</title> Cornhill. In a funeral sermon on George II., Chandler drew absurd parallels between him and David, which the Grub Street writers made the most of. Chandler's deformed sister Mary, a milliner at Bath, wrote verses which Pope commended.
<p>In <datestruct value="1744--"><year reg="1744">1744</year></datestruct> Richard Price, afterwards chaplain at Stoke Newington, held the lectureship at the Old Jewry. Price's lecture on <title>Civil Liberty,</title> <hi rend=italics>apropos</hi>
of the American war, gained him Franklin's and Priestley's friendship; as his <num value="1">first</num> ethical work had already won Hume's. Burke denounced him as a traitor; while the Corporation of London presented him with the freedom of the City in a gold box, the Congress offered him posts of honour, and the Premier of <datestruct value="1782--"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct> would have been glad to have had him as a secretary. The last pastor at the Old Jewry Chapel was Abraham Rees. This indefatigable man enlarged Harris's <title>Lexicon Technicum,</title> improved by Ephraim Chambers, into the <title>Encyclopaedia</title> of <num value="45">forty-five</num> quarto volumes, a book now thought redundant and ill-arranged, and the philological parts defective. In <datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct> the Old Jewry congregation removed to Jewin Street.
<p>Dr. James Foster, a Dissenting minister eulogised by Pope, carried on the Sunday evening lecture in Old Jewry for more than <num value="20">twenty</num> years; it was began in <datestruct value="1728--"><year reg="1728">1728</year></datestruct>. The clergy, wits, and <pb id="p.431" n="431"> freethinkers crowded with equal anxiety to hear him of whom Pope wrote-
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Let modest Foster, if he will, excel
<L><num value="10">Ten</num> metropolitans in preaching well.</QUOTE>
 And Pope's friend, Lord Bolingbroke, an avowed Deist, commended Foster for the false aphorism -- <QUOTE>Where mystery begins religion ends.</QUOTE> Dr. Foster attended Lord Kilmarnock before his execution. He wrote in defence of Christianity in reply to Tindal, the Freethinker, and died in <datestruct value="1753--"><year reg="1753">1753</year></datestruct>. He says in <num value="1">one</num> of his works :-- <QUOTE>I value those who are of different professions from me, more than those who agree with me in sentiment, if they are more serious, sober, and charitable.</QUOTE> This excellent man was the son of a Northamptonshire clergyman, who turned Dissenter and became a fuller at Exeter.
<p>At Grocers' Hall we stop to sketch the history of an ancient company.
<p>The Grocers of London were originally called Pepperers, pepper being the chief staple of their trade. The earlier Grocers were Italians, Genoese, Florentine or Venetian merchants, then supplying all the west of Christendom with Indian and Arabian spices and drugs, and Italian silks, wines, and fruits. The Pepperers are <num value="1">first</num> mentioned as a fraternity among the amerced guilds of Henry II., but had probably clubbed together at an earlier period. They are mentioned in a petition to Parliament as Grocers, says Mr. Herbert, in, <datestruct value="1361--"><year reg="1361">1361</year></datestruct> (Edward III.), and they themselves adopted the, at <num value="1">first</num>, opprobrious name in <datestruct value="1376--"><year reg="1376">1376</year></datestruct>, and some years later were incorporated by charter. They then removed from Soper's Lane (now Queen Street) to Bucklersbury, and waxed rich and powerful.
<p>The Grocers met at <num value="5">five</num> several places previous to building a hall; <num value="1">first</num> at the town house of the Abbots of Bury, St. Mary Axe; in <datestruct value="1347--"><year reg="1347">1347</year></datestruct> they moved to the house of the Abbot of St. Edmund; in <datestruct value="1348--"><year reg="1348">1348</year></datestruct> to the Rynged Hall, near Garlick-hythe; and afterwards to the hotel of the Abbot of St. Cross. In <datestruct value="1383--"><year reg="1383">1383</year></datestruct> they flitted to the Cornet's Tower, in Bucklersbury, a place which Edward III. had used for his money exchange. n <datestruct value="1411--"><year reg="1411">1411</year></datestruct> they purchased of Lord Fitzwalter the chapel of the Fratres du Sac (Brothers of the Sack) in Old Jewry, which had originally been a Jewish synagogue; and having, some years afterwards, purchased Lord Fitzwalter's house adjoining the chapel, began to build a hall, which was opened in <datestruct value="1428--"><year reg="1428">1428</year></datestruct>. The Friars' old chapel contained a buttery, pantry, cellar, parlour, kitchen, turret, clerk's house, a garden, and a set of almshouses in the front yard was added. The word <QUOTE>grocer,</QUOTE> says Ravenhill, in his <title>Short Account of the Company of Grocers</title> (<datestruct value="1689--"><year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct>), was used to express a trader <hi rend=italics>en gros</hi> (wholesale). As early as <datestruct value="1373"><year reg="1373">1373</year></datestruct>, the <num value="1">first</num> complement of <num value="21">twenty-one</num> members of this guild was raised to <num value="124">124</num>; and in <datestruct value="1583--"><year reg="1583">1583</year></datestruct>, <num value="16">sixteen</num> grocers were aldermen. In <datestruct value="1347--"><year reg="1347">1347</year></datestruct>, Nicholas Chaucer, a relation of the poet, was admitted as a grocer; and in <datestruct value="1383--"><year reg="1383">1383</year></datestruct>, John Churchman (Richard II.) obtained for the Grocers the great privilege of the custody, with the City, of the <QUOTE>King's Beam,</QUOTE> in Woolwharf, for weighing wool in the port of London, the <num value="1">first</num> step to a London Custom House. The Beam was afterwards removed to Bucklersbury. Henry VIII. took away the keepership of the great Beam from the City, but afterwards restored it. The Corporation still have their weights at the Weigh House, Little Eastcheap, and the porters there are the tackle porters, so called to distinguish them from the ticket porters. In <datestruct value="1450--"><year reg="1450">1450</year></datestruct>, the Grocers obtained the important right of sharing the office of garbeller of spices with the City. The garbeller had the right to enter any shop or warehouse to view and search for drugs, and to garble and cleanse them. The office gradually fell into desuetude, and is last mentioned in the Company's books in <datestruct VALUE="1687-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1687">1687</year></datestruct>, when the City garbeller paid a fine of <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure>, and <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">20</num>s.</measure> per annum, for leave to hold his office for life. The Grocers seem to have at <num value="1">one</num> time dealt in whale-oil and wool.
<p>During the Civil War the Grocers suffered, like all their brother companies. In <datestruct value="1645--"><year reg="1645">1645</year></datestruct>, the Parliament exacted <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure> per week from them towards the support of troops, <measure value="6l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6">6</num></measure> for City defences, and  <measure value="8l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="8">8</num></measure> for wounded soldiers. The Company had soon to sell <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> worth of plate. A further demand for arms, and a sum of <measure value="4500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4500">4,500</num></measure> for the defence of the City, drove them to sell all the rest of their plate, except the value of <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure>. In <datestruct value="1645--"><year reg="1645">1645</year></datestruct>, the watchful Committee of Safety, sitting at Haberdashers' Hall, finding the Company indebted <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> to <num value="1">one</num> Richard Greenough, a Cavalier delinquent, compelled them to pay that sum.
<p>No wonder, then, that the Grocers shouted at the Restoration, spent <measure value="540l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="540">540</num></measure> on the coronation pageant, and provided <num value="60">sixty</num> riders at Charles's noisy entrance into London. The same year, Sir John Frederick, being chosen Mayor, and not being, as rule required, a member of <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="12">twelve</num> Great Companies, left the Barber Chirurgeons, and joined the Grocers, who welcomed him with a great pageant. In <datestruct value="1664--"><year reg="1664">1664</year></datestruct>, the Grocers took a zealous part with their friends and allies, the Druggists, against the College of Physicians, who were trying to obtain a bill granting them power of search, seizure, fine, and imprisonment. The Plague year no election feast was held. The Great Fire followed, and not only greatly damaged Grocers' <pb id="p.432" n="432"> Hall, but also consumed the whole of their house property, excepting a few small tenements in Grub Street. They found it necessary to try and raise <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure> to pay their debts, to sell their melted plate, and to add <num value="94">ninety-four</num> members to the livery. Only succeeding, amid the general distress, in raising <measure value="6000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6000">6,000</num></measure>, the Company was almost bankrupt, their hall being seized, and attachments laid on their rent. By a great effort, however, they wore round, called more freemen on the livery, and added in <num value="2">two</num> months <num value="81">eighty-one</num> new members to the Court of Assistants; so that before the Revolution of <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct> they had restored their hall and mowed down most of their rents. Indeed, <num value="1">one</num> of their most brilliant epochs was in <datestruct value="1689--"><year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct>, when William III. accepted the office of their sovereign master.
<p>Some writers credit the Grocers' Company with the enrolment of <num value="5">five</num> kings, several princes, <num value="8">eight</num> dukes, <num value="3">three</num> earls, and <num value="20">twenty</num> lords. Of these <num value="5">five</num> kings, Mr. Herbert could, however, only trace Charles II. and William III. Their list of honorary members is <num value="1">one</num> emblazoned with many great names, including Sir Philip Sidney (at whose funeral they assisted), Pitt, Lord Chief Justice Tenterden, the Marquis of Cornwallis, George

<p>The garden of the Hall must have been a pleasant place in the old timeS, as it is now. It is mentioned in <datestruct value="1427--"><year reg="1427">1427</year></datestruct> as having vines spreading up before the parlour windows. It had also an arbour; and in <datestruct value="1433--"><year reg="1433">1433</year></datestruct> it was generously thrown open to the citizens generally, who had petitioned for this privilege. It contained hedge-rows and a bowling alley, with an ancient tower of stone or brick, called <QUOTE>the Turret,</QUOTE> at the north-west corner, which had probably formed part of Lord Fitzwalter's mansion. The garden remained unchanged till the new hall was built in <datestruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>, when it was much curtailed, and in <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct> it was nearly cut in half by the enlargement of Princes Street. For ground which had cost the Grocers, in <datestruct value="1433--"><year reg="1433">1433</year></datestruct>, only <measure value="31l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="31">31</num></measure> <measure value="17s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="17">17</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure>, they received from the Bank of England more than <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure>.
<p>The Hall was often lent for dinners, funerals, county feasts, and weddings; and in <datestruct value="1564--"><year reg="1564">1564</year></datestruct> the gentlemen of Gray's Inn dined there with the gentlemen of the Middle Temple. This system breeding abuses, was limited in <datestruct value="1610--"><year reg="1610">1610</year></datestruct>.
<p>In the time of the Commonwealth, Grocers' Hall was the place of meeting for Parliamentary <pb id="p.433" n="433"> Committees. Among other subjects there discussed, we find the selection of able ministers to regulate Church government, and providing moneys for the army; and in <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct> the Grand Committee of Safety held its sittings in this Hall.
<p>In <datestruct value="1648--"><year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct> the Grocers had to petition General Fairfax not to quarter his troops in the hall of a charitable Company like theirs. In <datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct> a grand entertainment was given by the Grocers to Cromwell and Fairfax. After hearing <hi rend=italics><num value="2">two</num></hi> sermons at Christ's Church, preached by Mr. Goodwin and Dr. Owen, Cromwell, his officers, the Speaker, and the judges, dined together. <QUOTE>No drinking of healths,</QUOTE> says a Puritan paper of the time, <QUOTE>nor other uncivill concomitants formerly of such great meetings, nor any other music than the drum and

 trumpet--a feast, indeed, of Christians and chieftains, whereas others were rather of Chretiens and cormorants.</QUOTE> The surplus food was sent to the London prisons, and <measure value="40l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40">40</num></measure> distributed to the poor. The Aldermen and Council afterwards went to General Fairfax at his house in Queen Street, and, in the name of the City, presented him with a large basin and ewer of beaten gold; while to Cromwell they sent a great present of plate, value <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure>, and <num value="200">200</num> pieces of gold. They afterwards gave a still grander feast to Cromwell in his more glorious time, and <num value="1">one</num> at the Restoration to General Monk. On the latter feast they expended <measure value="215l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="215">215</num></measure>, and enrolled <QUOTE>honest George</QUOTE> a brother of the Company.
<p>The Grocers' Hall might never have been rebuilt after the Great Fire, so crippled was the Company, <pb id="p.434" n="434"> but for the munificence of Sir John Cutler, a rich Grocer, whom Pope (not always regardful of truth) has bitterly satirised.
<p>Sir John rebuilt the parlour and dining-room in <datestruct value="1668--"><year reg="1668">1668</year></datestruct>-<num value="9">9</num>, and was rewarded by <QUOTE>a strong vote of thanks,</QUOTE> and by his statue and picture being placed in the Hall as eternal records of the Company's esteem and gratitude. <num value="2">Two</num> years later Grocers' all was granted to the parishioners of St. Mildred as a chapel till their own church could be rebuilt. he garden turret, used as a record office, was fitted up for the clerk's residence, and a meeting place for the court; and, <QUOTE>for better order, decorum, and gravity,</QUOTE> pipes and pots were forbidden in the court-room during the meetings.
<p>At Grocers' Hall, <QUOTE>to my great surprise,</QUOTE> says vivacious Pennant, <QUOTE>I met again with Sir John Cutler, Grocer, in marble and on canvas. In the <num value="1">first</num> he is represented standing, in a flowing wig, waved rather than curled, a laced cravat, and a furred gown, with the folds not ungraceful; in all, except where the dress is inimical to the sculptor's art, it may be called a good performance. By his portrait we may learn that this worthy wore a black wig, and was a good-looking man. He was created a baronet, <datestruct VALUE="1660-11-12"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=12>12th</day>, <year reg=1660>1660</year></datestruct>; so that he certainly had some claim of gratitude with the restored monarch. He died in, <datestruct value="1693--"><year reg="1693">1693</year></datestruct>. His kinsman and executor, Edmund Boulton, Esq., expended <measure value="7666l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="7666">7,666</num></measure> on his funeral expenses. He served as Master of the Company in <datestruct value="1652--"><year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1653--"><year reg="1653">1653</year></datestruct>, in <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>, and again a <num value="4">fourth</num> time.</QUOTE>
<p>In <datestruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></datestruct> the Hall was renovated at an expense of <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="500">500</num></measure>, by Sir John Moore, so as to make it fit for the residence of the Lord Mayor. Moore kept his mayoralty here, paying a rent of <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure>. It continued to be used by the Lord Mayors till <datestruct value="1735"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>, when the Company, now grown rich, withdrew their permission. In <datestruct value="1694--"><year reg="1694">1694</year></datestruct> it was let to. the Bank of England, who held their court there till the Bank was built in <datestruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></datestruct>. The Company's present hall was built in <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, and repaired in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, since which the whole has been restored, the statue of Sir John Cutler moved from its neglected post in the garden, and the arms of the most illustrious Grocers of antiquity set up.
<p>The Grocers' charities are numerous; they give away annually <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure> among the poor of the Company, and they have had <measure value="4670l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4670">4,670</num></measure> left them to lend to poor members of the community. Before <datestruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>, Boyle says, the Company gave away about <measure value="700l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="700">700</num></measure> a year.
<p>Among the bravest of the Grocers, we must mention Sir John Philpot, Mayor, <datestruct value="1378--"><year reg="1378">1378</year></datestruct>, who fitted out a fleet that captured John Mercer, a Scotch freebooter, and took <num value="15">fifteen</num> Spanish ships. He afterwards transported an English army to Brittany in his own ships, and released more than <num value="1000">1,000</num> of our victualling vessels. John Churchman, sheriff in <datestruct value="1385--"><year reg="1385">1385</year></datestruct>, was the founder of the Custom House. Sir Thomas Knolles, mayor in <datestruct value="1399--"><year reg="1399">1399</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1410--"><year reg="1410">1410</year></datestruct>, rebuilt St. Antholin's, Watling Street. Sir Robert Chichele (a relation of Archbishop Chichele), mayor in <num value="141">141</num>--<num value="12">12</num>, gave the ground for rebuilding the church of St. Stephen, Walbrook, which his descendant, Sir Thomas (Mayor and Grocer), helped to rebuild after the Great Fire. Sir William Sevenoke was founder of the school and college at Sevenoaks, Kent. Sir John Welles (mayor in <datestruct value="1431--"><year reg="1431">1431</year></datestruct>), built the Standard in Chepe, helped to build the Guildhall Chapel, built the south aisle of St. Antholin's, and repaired the miry way leading to Westminster (the Strand). Sir Stephen Brown, mayor, <datestruct value="1438--"><year reg="1438">1438</year></datestruct>, imported cargoes of rye from Dantzic, during a great dearth, and as Fuller quaintly says, <QUOTE><num value="1">first</num> showed Londoners the way to the barn door.</QUOTE> Sir John Crosby (Grocer and Sheriff in <datestruct value="1483--"><year reg="1483">1483</year></datestruct>), lived in great splendour at Crosby House, in Bishopsgate Street: he gave great sums for civic purposes, and repaired London Wall, London Bridge, and Bishopsgate. Sir Henry Keble (mayor, <datestruct value="1510--"><year reg="1510">1510</year></datestruct>) was <num value="6">six</num> times Master of the Grocers' Company: he left bequests to the Company, and gave <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> to rebuild St. Antholin's, Budge Row. Lawrence Sheriff, Warden <datestruct value="1561--"><year reg="1561">1561</year></datestruct>, was founder of the great school at Rugby.
<p> <QUOTE>The rivulet or running water,</QUOTE> says Maitland, <QUOTE>denominated Walbrook, ran through the middle of the city above ground, till about the middle of the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century, when it was arched over, since which time it has served as a common sewer, wherein, at the depth of <num value="16">sixteen</num> feet, under St. Mildred's Church steeple, runs a great and rapid stream. At the south-east corner of Grocers' Alley, *in the Poultry, stood a beautiful chapel, called Corpus Christi and Saricta Maria, which was founded in the reign of Edward III. by a pious man, for a master and brethren, for whose support he endowed the same with lands, to the amount of <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> pounds</measure> per annum.</QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>It hath been a common speech,</QUOTE> says Stow  (Elizabeth), <QUOTE><p>that when Walbrook did lie open, barges were rowed out of the Thames, or towed up so far, and therefore the place hath ever since been called <hi rend=italics>the Old Barge</hi>. Also, on the north side of this street, directly over against the said Bucklersbury, was <num value="1">one</num> antient strong tower of stone, at which tower King Edward III., in the eighteenth of his reign, by the name of the King's House, called <title>Cornets Tower</title>, in London, did <pb id="p.435" n="435"> appoint to be his exchange of money there to be kept. In the <num value="29">twenty-ninth</num> he granted it to Frydus Guynisane and Lindus Bardoile, merchants of London for <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> the year; and in the <num value="32">thirty-second</num> of his reign, he gave it to his college, or Free Chapel of St. Stephen, at Westminster, by the name of his tower, called Cornettes-Tower, at Bucklesbury, in London. This tower of late years was taken down by <num value="1">one</num> Buckle, a grocer, meaning, in place thereof, to have set up and builded a goodly frame of timber; but the said Buckle greedily labouring to pull down the old tower, a piece thereof fell upon him, which so bruised him, that his life was thereby shortened; and another, that married his widow, set up the new prepared frame of timber, and finished the work.
<p>This whole street, called Bucklesbury, on both sides, throughout, is possessed by grocers, and apothecaries toward the west end thereof. On the south side breaketh out some other short lane, called in records <title>Peneritch Street</title>. It reacheth but to St. Syth's Lane, and St. Syth's Church is the farthest part thereof, for by the west end of the said church beginneth Needlers Lane.</QUOTE>

<p> <QUOTE>I have heard,</QUOTE> says Pennant, <QUOTE><p>that Bucklersbury was, in the reign of King William, noted for the great resort of ladies of fashion, to purchase tea, fans, and other Indian goods. King William, in some of his letters, appears to be angry with his queen for visiting these shops, which, it would seem, by the following lines of Prior, were sometimes perverted to places of intrigue, for, speaking of Hans Carvel's wife, the poet says :--

<p>In the time of Queen Elizabeth this street was inhabited by chemists, druggists, and apothecaries. Mouffet, in his treatise on foods, calls on them tc decide whether sweet smells correct pestilent air; and adds, that Bucklersbury being replete witIt physic, drugs, and spicery, and being perfumed in the time of the plague with the pounding of spices, melting of gum, and making perfumes, escaped that great plague, whereof such mul. titudes died, that scarce any house was left unvisited.
<p>Shakespeare mentions Bucklersbury in his <title>Merry Wives of Windsor</title>, written at Queen Elizabeth's request. He makes Falstaff say to Mrs. Ford--

</LIST></ARGUMENT>

<P>THE Lord Mayors in old times often dwelt in the neighbourhood of the Old Jewry; but in <datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct> Lord Mayor Perry laid the <num value="1">first</num> stone of the present dull and stately Mansion House, and Sir Crisp Gascoigne, <datestruct value="1753--"><year reg="1753">1753</year></datestruct>, was the <num value="1">first</num> Lord Mayor that resided in it. The architect, Dance, selected the Greek style for the City palace.
<p>The present palace of the Lord Mayor stands on <pb id="p.436" n="436"> the site of the old Stocks' Market, built for the sale of fish and flesh by Henry Walis, mayor in the <num value="10">10th</num> year of the reign of Edward I. Before this time a pair of stocks had stood there, and they gave their name to the new market house. Walis had designed this market to help to maintain London Bridge, and the bridge keeper had for a long time power to grant leases for the market shops.

<p> <QUOTE>At the north end of the market place,</QUOTE> says Strype, admiringly, <QUOTE>by a water conduit pipe, is erected a nobly great statue of King Charles II. on horseback, trampling on slaves, standing on a pedestal with dolphins cut in niches, all of freestone, and encompassed with handsome iron grates. This statue was made and erected at the sole charge of Sir Robert Viner, alderman, knight and baronet, an honourable, worthy, and generous magistrate of this City.</QUOTE>
<p>This statue of Charles had a droll origin. It was originally intended for a statue of John Sobieski, the Polish king who saved Vienna from the Turks. In the <num value="1">first</num> year of the Restoration, the enthusiastic Viner purchased the unfinished statue abroad. Sobieski's stern head was removed by Latham, the head of Charles substituted, and the turbaned Turk, on whom Sobieski trampled, became a defeated Cromwell.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.436.2">This Mansion House</lemma></QUOTE> says Dodsley's <QUOTE>Guide to London,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>is very substantially built of Portland stone, and has a portico of <num value="6">six</num> lofty fluted columns, of the Corinthian order, in the front; the same order being continued in pilasters both under the pediment, and on each side. The basement storey is very massive and built in rustic. In the centre of this storey is the door which leads to the kitchens, cellars, and other offices; and on each side rises a flight of steps of very considerable extent, leading up to the portico, in the midst of which is the door which leads to the apartments and offices where business is transacted. The stone balustrade of the stairs is continued along the front of the portico, and the columns, which are wrought in the proportions of Palladio, support a large angular pediment, adorned with a very noble piece in basrelief, representing the dignity and opulence of the City of London, by Mr. Taylor.</QUOTE>
<p>The lady crowned with turrets represents London. She is trampling on Envy, who lies struggling on her back. London's left arm rests on a shield, and in her right she holds a wand which mightily resembles a yard measure. On her right side stands a Cupid, holding the cap of Liberty over his shoulder at the end of a staff. A little further lolls the river Thames, who is emptying a large vase, and near him is an anchor and cable. On London's <pb id="p.437" n="437"> left is Plenty, kneeling and pouring out fruit from a cornucopia, and behind Plenty are <num value="2">two</num> naked boys with bales of goods, as emblems of Commerce. The complaint is that the principal figures are too large, and crowd the rest, who, compelled to grow smaller and smaller, seem sheltering from the rain.
<p>Beneath the portico are <num value="2">two</num> series of windows, and above these there used to be an attic storey for the servants, generally known as <QUOTE>the Mayor's Nest,</QUOTE> with square windows, crowned with a balustrade. It is now removed.
<p>The Mansion House is an oblong, has an area in the middle, and at the farthest end of it is situated the grand and
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.437.1">lofty Egyptian Hall</lemma>
called from some Egyptian details that have now disappeared). This noble banquet-room was designed by the Earl of Burlington, and was intended to resemble an Egyptian chamber described by Vitruvius. It has <num value="2">two</num> side-screens of lofty columns supporting a vaulted roof, and is lit by a large west window. It can dine <num value="400">400</num> guests. In the side walls are the niches, filled with sculptured groups or figures, some of the best of them by Foley. <QUOTE>To make it regular in rank,</QUOTE> says the author of
<title>London and its Environs</title> (<datestruct value="1761--"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>), <QUOTE>the architect has raised a similar building on the front, which is the upper part of a dancing-gallery. This rather hurts than adorns the face of the building.</QUOTE> Near the end, at each side, is a window of extraordinary height, placed between complex Corinthian pilasters, and extending to the top of the attic storey. In former times the sides of the Mansion House were darkened by the houses that crowded it, and the front required an area before it. It has been seriously proposed lately to take the Poultry front of the Mansion House away, and: place it west, facing Queen Victoria Street. In a London Guide of <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct> the state bed at the Mansion House, which cost <num value="3000">three thousand</num> guineas, is spoken of with awe and wonder.
<p>There are, says Timbs, other dining-rooms, as the Venetian Parlour, Wilkes's Parlour, &amp;c. The drawing-room and ball-room are superbly decorated; above the latter is the Justice-room (constructed in <datestruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></datestruct>), where the Lord Mayor sits daily. In a contiguous apartment was the state bed. There is a fine gallery of portraits and other pictures. The kitchen is a large hall, provided with ranges, each of them large enough to roast an entire ox. The vessels for boiling vegetables are not pots, but, tanks. The stewing range is a long, broad iron pavement laid down over a series of furnaces. The spits are huge cages formed of iron bars, and turned by machinery.
<p>At the close of the Exhibition of <datestruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>, the Corporation of London, with a view to encourage art, voted <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> to be expended in statuary for the Egyptian Hall. Among the leading works we may mention <title>Alastor</title> and <title>Hermione,</title> by Mr. J. Durham; <title>Egeria</title> and <title>The Elder Brother,</title>
in <title>Comus,</title> by Mr. J. H. Foley; Chaucer's

<p> <QUOTE>None,</QUOTE> says our authority, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>can serve the office of Lord Mayor unless he be an alderman of London, who must previously have served the office of sheriff, though it is not necessary that, a sheriff should be an alderman. The sheriffs are elected by the livery of London, the only requisite for the office being, that he is a freeman and liveryman of the City, and that he possesses property sufficient to serve the office of sheriff creditably, in all its ancient splendour and hospitality, to do which generally involves an expenditure of about <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure>. There are fees averaging from <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="500">500</num></measure> to <measure value="600l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="600">600</num></measure> belonging to the office, but these are given to the under-sheriff by all respectable and honourable men, as it is considered very disreputable for the sheriff to take any of them.
<p>The Lord Mayor has the privilege, on any day between the <datestruct value="04-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct> and the <datestruct value="06-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, of nominating any <num value="1">one</num> or more persons (not exceeding <num value="9">nine</num> in the whole) to be submitted--tothe Livery on Midsummer Day, for them to elect the--<num value="2">two</num> sheriffs for the year ensuing. This is, generally done at a public dinner, when the Lord Mayor proposes the healths of such persons as he intends to nominate for sheriffs. It is generally done as a compliment, and considered as an honour; but in those cases where the parties have an objection to serve, it sometimes gives offence, as, upon the Lord Mayor declaring in the Court of Aldermen the names of those he proposes, the mace-bearer immediately waits upon them, and gives them formal notice; when, if they do not intend to serve, they are excused, upon paying, at the next Court of Aldermen, <num value="400">four hundred</num> guineas; but if they allow their names to remain on the list until elected by the livery, the fine is <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure>.

<p>On the <datestruct value="11-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct> the Lord Mayor elect is sworn into office publicly in Guildhall, having previously breakfasted with the Lord Mayor at the Mansion House; they are attended at this ceremony, as well as--at the breakfast, by the members and officers of the Court of the Livery Company to which they respectively belong, in their gowns.

<p>The powers of the Lord Mayor over the City, although abridged, like the sovereign power over the State, are still much more extensive than is generally supposed. The rights and privileges of the chief magistrate of the City. and its corporation are nearly allied to those of the constitution of the State. The Lord Mayor has the badges of royalty attached to his office--the sceptre, the swords of justice and mercy, and the mace. The gold chain, <num value="1">one</num> of the most ancient honorary distinctions, and

 <pb id="p.442" n="442"> which may be traced from the Eastern manner of conferring dignity, is worn by him, among other honorary badges; and, having passed through the office of Lord Mayor, the alderman continues to wear it during his life. He controls the City purse, the Chamberlain delivering it into his hands, together with the sceptre, on the day he is sworn into office. He has the right of precedence in the City before all the Royal Family, which right was disputed by the Prince of Wales, in St. Paul's Cathedral, during the mayoralty of Sir James Shaw, but maintained by him, and approved and confirmed by the King (George III.). The gates of the City are in his custody, and it is usual to close the only <num value="1">one</num> now remaining, Temple Bar, on the approach of the sovereign when on a visit to the City, who knocks and formally requests admission, the Mayor attending in person to grant it, and receive the visit of royalty; and upon proclaiming war or peace, he also proceeds in state to Temple Bar, to admit the heralds. Soldiers cannot march through the City, in any large numbers, without the Mayor's permission, <num value="1">first</num> obtained by the Commander-in-chief.
<p>The Lieutenancy of the City of London is in commission. The Lord Mayor, being the Chief Commissioner, issues a new commission, whenever he pleases, by application to the Lord Chancellor, through the Secretary of State. He names in the commission all the aldermen and deputies of the City of London, the directors of the Bank, the members for the City, and such of his immediate friends and relations as he pleases. The commission, being under the Great Seal, gives all the parties named therein the right to be styled esquires, and the name once in the commission remains, unless removed for any valid reason.
<p>The Lord Mayor enjoys the right of private audience with the Crown; and when an audience is wished for, it is usual to make the request through the Remembrancer, but not necessary. When Alderman Wilson was Lord Mayor, he used to apply by letter to the Lord Chamberlain. In attending levees or drawing-rooms, the Lord Mayor has the privilege of the <hi rend=italics>entree</hi>, and, in consideration of the important duties he has to perform in the City, and to save his time, he is allowed to drive direct into the Ambassadors' Court at St. James's, without going round by Constitution Hill. He is summoned as a Privy Councillor on the death of the King; and the Tower pass-word is sent to him regularly, signed by the sovereign.
<p>He has the uncontrolled conservancy of the river Thames and the waters of the Medway, from London Bridge to Rochester down the river, and from London Bridge to Oxford up the river. he holds Courts of Conservancy whenever he sess it necessary, and summons juries in Kent, from London and Middlesex, who are compelled to fo on the river in boats to view and make presentments. In the mayoralty of Alderman Wilson, these courts were held in the state barge, on the water, at the spot with which the inquiry was connected, for the convenience of the witnesses attending from the villages near. It is usual for him to visit Oxford once in <num value="14">fourteen</num>, and Rochester once in <num value="7">seven</num> years.<NOTE>A new Act for the conservancy of the Thames came into operation on <datestruct VALUE="1857-09-30"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=30>30th</day>, <year reg=1857>1857</year></datestruct>, the result of a compromise between the City and the Government, after a long law-suit between the Crown and City authorities.</NOTE>

<P>Alderman Wilson, in <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>, was the last Lord Mayor (says Fairholt, whose book was published in <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>) who visited the western boundary; and he, at the request of the Court of Alderman, made Windsor the principal seat of the festivities, going no farther than Cliefden, and visiting Magna Charta island on his return. Alderman Pirie was the last who visited the eastern boundary, the whole party staying <num value="2">two</num> days at Rochester. The Lord Mayor is privileged by the City to go these journeys every year, should he see any necessity for it; but the expense is so great (about <num value="1000">1,000</num>) that it is only performed at these distant periods, although Alderman Wilson visited the western boundary in the <num value="13">thirteenth</num>, and Alderman Pirie in the <num value="5">fifth</num> year. A similar short view is taken as far as Twickenham yearly, in the month of July, at a cost of about <num value="150">150</num>, when the Lord Mayor is attended by the alderman, the sheriffs, and their ladies, with the same show and attendance as on the more infrequent visits. His lordship ahd also a committee to assist in the duties of his office, who have a shallop of their own, and take a view up and down the river, as far as they like to go, once or twice a month during summre, at an expense of some hundreds per annum.
<P>The Lord Mayor may be said to have a veto upon the proceedings of the Courts both of Aldermen and Common Council, as well as upon the Court of Livery in Common Hall assembled, neither of these courts being able to meet unless convened by him; and he can at any time dissolve the court by removing the sword and mace from the table, and declaring the business at an end; but this is considered an ungracious display of power when exercised.
<P>The Lord Mayor may call upon the Recorder for his advice whenever he may stand in need of it, as well as for that of the Common Serjeant, the <num value="4">four</num> City pleaders, and the City solicitor, from whom <pb id="p.443" n="443"> he orders prosecutions at the City expense whenever he thinks the public good requires it. The salary of the Recorder if <measure value="2500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2500">2,500</num></measure> per annum, besides fees; the Common Serjeant <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure>, with an income from other sources of<measure value="843l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="843">843</num></measure> per annum. The solicitor is supposed to make <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure> per annum.
<P>The Lord Mayor resides in the Mansion House, the <num value="1">first</num> stone of which was laid the <datestruct VALUE="1739-10-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>.

About <measure value="9000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="9000">9,000</num></measure> was paid out of the City's income.

<P>That clever but unscrupulous tuft-hunter and smart parvenu, Theodore Hook, who talked of Bloomsbury as if it was semi-barbarous, and of citizens (whose wine he drank, and whose hospitality he so often shared) as if they could only eat venison and swallow turtle soup, has left a sketch of the short-lived dignity of a mayor, which exactly represents the absurd caricature of City life that then pleased his West-end readers, half of whom had derived their original wealth from the till. Scropps, the new Lord Mayor, cannot sleep all night for his greatness; the wind down the chimney sounds like the shouts of the people; the cocks crowing in the morn at the back of the house he takes for trumpets sounding his approach; and the ordinary incidental noises in the family he fancies the pop-guns at Stangate announcing his disembarcation at Westminster. Then come his droll mishaps: when he enters the state coach, and throws himself back upon his broad seat, with all imaginable dignity, in the midst of all his ease and

She had eighteen oars and all other fittings complete, and was profusely gilt. But when the Conservancy Act took force, and the Corporation had no longer need of her, she was sold at her moorings at Messrs. Searle's, Surrey side of Westminster Bridge, on Thursday, <datestruct VALUE="1860-04-5"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=5>5th</day>, <year reg=1860>1860</year></datestruct>, by Messrs.

 from the eldest and pet daughter of that  <Q>twice Lord Mayor.</Q>  It cost <measure value="3300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3300">3,300</num></measure>, and was built by Messrs. Field and White, in consequence of the old barge <hi rend=italics>Crosby</hi> (built during the mayoralty of Brass Crosby, <datestruct value="1771--"><year reg="1771">1771</year></datestruct>) being found past repairing.
<hi rend=italics>Maria Wood</hi> measures <num value="140">140</num> feet long by <num value="19">19</num> feet wide, and draws only <num value="2">2</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches of water.

<P>Our materials for sketching Saxon London are singularly scanty; yet some faint picture of it we may perhaps hope to convey.
<p>Our readers must, therefore, divest their minds entirely of all remembrance of that great ocean of houses that has now spread like an inundation from the banks of the winding Thames, surging over the wooded ridges that rise northward, and widening out from Whitechapel eastward to Kensington westward. They must rather recall to their minds some small German town, belted in with a sturdy wall, raised not for ornament, but defence, with corner turrets for archers, and pierced with loops whence the bowmen may drive their arrows at the straining workers of the catapult and mangonels (those Roman war-engines we used against the cruel Danes), and with stonecapped places of shelter along the watchmen's platforms, where the sentinels may shelter themselves during the cold and storm, when tired of peering over the battlements and looking for the crafty enemy Essex-wards or Surrey way. No toy battlements of modern villa or tea-garden are those over which the rough-bearded men, in hoods and leather coats, lean in the summer, watching the citizens disporting themselves in the Moorfields, or in winter sledging over the ice-pools of Finsbury. Not for mere theatrical pageant do they carry those heavy axes and tough spears. Those bossed targets are not for festival show; those buff jackets, covered with metal scales, have been tested before now by Norsemen's ponderous swords and the hatchets of the fierce Jutlanders.
<p>In such castle rooms as antiquaries now visit, the Saxon earls and eldermen quaffed their ale, and drank <QUOTE>wassail</QUOTE> to King Egbert or Ethelwolf. n such dungeons as we now see with a shudder at the Tower, Saxon traitors and Danish prisoners once peaked and pined.
<p>We must imagine Saxon London as having <num value="3">three</num> component parts-fortresses, convents, and huts. The girdle of wall, while it restricted space, would give a feeling of safety and snugness which in our great modern city--which is really a conglomeration, a sort of pudding-stone, of many towns and villages grown together into <num value="1">one</num> shapeless massthe citizen can never again experience. The streets would in some degree resemble those of Moscow, where, behind fortress, palace, and church, you come upon rows of mere wooden sheds, scarcely better than the log huts of the peasants, or the sombre felt tents of the Turcoman. There would be large <pb id="p.448" n="448"> vacant spaces, as in St. Petersburg; and the suburbs would rapidly open beyond the walls into wild woodland and pasture, fen, moor, and common. A few dozen fishermen's boats from Kent and Norfolk would be moored by the Tower, if, indeed, any Saxon fort had ever replaced the somewhat hypothetical Roman fortress of tradition; and lower down some <num value="100">hundred</num> or so cumbrous Dutch, French, and German vessels would represent our trade with the almost unknown continent whence we drew wine and furs and the few luxuries of those hardy and thrifty days.
<p>In the narrow streets, the fortress, convent, and hut would be exactly represented by the chieftain and his bearded retinue of spearmen, the priest with his train of acolytes, and the herd of halfsavage churls who plodded along with rough carts laden with timber from the Essex forests, or driving herds of swine from the glades of Epping. The churls we picture as grim but hearty folk, stolid, pugnacious, yet honest and promise-keeping, overinclined to strong ale, and not disinclined for a brawl; men who had fought with Danes and wolves, and who were ready to fight them again. The shops must have been mere stalls, and much of the trade itinerant. There would be, no doubt, rudimentary market-places about Cheapside (Chepe is the Saxon word for market); and the lines of some of our chief streets, no doubt, still follow the curves of the original Saxon roads.
<p>The date of the <num value="1">first</num> Saxon bridge over the Thames is extremely uncertain, as our chapter on London Bridge will show; but it is almost as certain as history can be that, soon after the Dane Olaf's invasion of England (<num value="994">994</num>) in Ethelred's reign, with <num value="390">390</num> piratical ships, when he plundered Staines and Sandwich, a rough wooden bridge was built, which crossed the Thames from St. Botolph's wharf to the Surrey shore. We must imagine it a clumsy rickety structure, raised on piles with rough-hewn timber planks, and with drawbridges that lifted to allow Saxon vessels to pass. There was certainly a bridge as early as <datestruct value="1006"><year reg="1006">1006</year></datestruct>, probably built to stop the passage of the Danish pirate boats. Indeed, Snorro Sturleson, the Icelandic historian, tells us that when the Danes invaded England in <datestruct value="1008--"><year reg="1008">1008</year></datestruct>, in the reign of Ethelred the Unready (ominous name!), they entrenched themselves in Southwark, and held the fortified bridge, which had penthouses, bulwarks, and shelter-turrets. Ethelred's ally, Olaf, however, determined to drive the Danes from the bridge, adopted a daring expedient to accomplish this object, and, fastening his ships to the piles of the bridge, from which the Danes were raining down stones and beams, dragged it to pieces, upon which, on very fair provocation, Ottar, a Norse bard, broke forth into the following eulogy of King Olaf, the patron saint of Tooley Street :
<p> <QUOTE>And thou hast overthrown their bridge, O thou storm of the sons of Odin, skilful and foremost in the battle, defender of the earth, and restorer of the exiled Ethelred! It was during the fight which the mighty King fought with the men of England, when King Olaf, the son of Odin, valiantly attacked the bridge at London. Bravely did the swords of the Volsces defend it; but through the trench which the sea-kings guarded thou camest, and the plain of Southwark was crowded with thy tents.</QUOTE>
<p>It may seem as strange to us, at this distance of time, to find London Bridge ennobled in a Norse epic, as to find a Sir Something de Birmingham figuring among the bravest knights of Froissart's record; but there the Norse song stands on record, and therein we get a stormy picture of the Thames in the Saxon epoch.
<p>It is supposed that the Saxon kings dwelt in a palace on the site of the Baynard's Castle of the Middle Ages, which stood at the river-side just west of St. Paul's, although there is little proof of the fact. But we get on the sure ground of truth when we find Edward the Confessor, <num value="1">one</num> of the most powerful of the Saxon kings, dwelling in saintly splendour at Westminster, beside the abbey dedicated by his predecessors to St. Peter. The combination of the palace and the monastery was suitable to such a friend of the monks, and to <num value="1">one</num> who saw strange visions, and claimed to be the favoured of Heaven. But beyond and on all sides of the Saxon palace everywhere would be fields --St. James's Park (fields), Hyde Park (fields), Regent's Park (fields), and long woods stretching northward from the present St. John's Wood to the uplands of Epping.
<p>As to the City residences of the Saxon kings, we have little on record; but there is indeed a tradition that in Wood Street, Cheapside, King thelstane once resided; and that <num value="1">one</num> of the doors of his house opened into Addle Street, Aldermanbury (<hi rend=italics>addle</hi>, from the German word <hi rend=italics>ede,</hi>
noble). But Stow does not mention the tradition, which rests, we fear, on slender evidence.
<p>Whether the Bread Street, Milk Street, and Cornhill markets date from the Saxon times is uncertain. It is not unlikely that they do, yet the earliest mention of them in London chronicles is found several centuries later.
<p>We must be therefore content to search for allusions to London's growth and wealth in Saxon <pb id="p.449" n="449"> history, and there the allusions are frequent, clear, and interesting.
<p>In the earlier time London fluctuated, according to <num value="1">one</num> of the best authorities on Saxon history, between an independent mercantile commonwealth and a dependency of the Mercian kings. The Norsemen occasionally plundered and held it as a point <hi rend=italics>d'appui</hi> for their pirate galleys. Its real epoch of greatness, however ancient its advantage as port, commences with its re-conquest by
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.449.1">Alfred the Great</lemma> in <num value="886">886</num>. Henceforward, says that most reliable writer on this period, Mr. Freeman, we find it <num value="1">one</num> of the firmest strongholds of English freedom, and <num value="1">one</num> of the most efficient bulwarks of the realm. There the English character developed the highest civilisation of the country, and there the rich and independent citizens laid the foundations of future liberty.
<p>In <num value="896">896</num> the Danes are said to have gone up the Lea, and made a strong work <num value="20">twenty</num> miles above Lundenburgh. This description, says Earle, would be particularly appropriate, if Lundenburgh occupied the site of the Tower. Also <num value="1">one</num> then sees the reason why they should go up the Lea--viz., because their old pas age up the Thames was at that time intercepted.
<p> <QUOTE>London,</QUOTE> says Earle, in his valuable Saxon Chronicles, <QUOTE>was a flourishing and opulent city, the chief emporium of commerce in the, island, and the residence of foreign merchants. Properly it was more an Angle city, the chief city of the Anglian nation of Mercia; but the Danes had settled there in great numbers, and had numerous captives that they had taken in the late wars. Thus the Danish population had a preponderance over the Anglian free population, and the latter were glad to see Alfred come and restore the balance in their favour. It was of the greatest importance to Alfred to secure this city, not only as the capital of Mercia  (<foreign lang=la>caput regni Merciorum</foreign>, Malmesbury), but as the means of doing what Mercia had not done-viz., of making it a barrier to the passage of pirate ships inland. Accordingly, in the year <datestruct value="886"><year reg="886">886</year></datestruct>, Alfred <hi rend=italics>planted</hi>
the <hi rend=italics>garrison</hi> of London (i.e., not as a town is garrisoned in our day, with men dressed in uniform and lodged in barracks, but) with a military colony of men to whom land was given for their maintenance, and who would live in and about a fortified position under a commanding officer. It appears to me not impossible that this may have been the <num value="1">first</num> military occupation of Tower Hill, but this is a question for the local antiquary.</QUOTE>
<p>In <num value="982">982</num> (Ethelred II.), London, still a mere cluster of wooden and wattled houses, was almost entirely destroyed by a fire. The new city was, no doubt, rebuilt in a more luxurious manner. <QUOTE>London in <num value="993">993</num>,</QUOTE> says Mr. Freeman, in a very admirable passage, <QUOTE>fills much the same place in England that Paris filled in Northern Gaul a century earlier. The <num value="2">two</num> cities, in their several lands, were the <num value="2">two</num> great fortresses, placed on the <num value="2">two</num> great rivers of the country, the special objects of attack on the part of the invaders, and the special defence of the country against them. Each was, as it were, marked out by great public services to become the capital of the whole kingdom. But Paris became a national capital only because its local count gradually grew into a national king. London, amidst all changes, within and without, has always preserved more or less of her ancient character as a free city. Paris was merely a military bulwark, the dwelling-place of a ducal or a royal sovereign. London, no less important as a military post, had also a greatness which rested on a surer foundation. London, like a few other of our great cities, is <num value="1">one</num> of the ties which connect our Teutonic England with the Celtic and Roman Britain of earlier times. Her British name still remains unchanged by the Teutonic conquerors. Before our <num value="1">first</num> introduction to London as an English city, she had cast away her Roman and imperial title; she was no longer Augusta; she had again assumed her ancient name, and through all changes she had adhered to her ancient character. The commercial fame of London dates from the early days of Roman dominion. The English conquest may have caused a temporary interruption, but it was only temporary. As early as the days of Aethelberht the commerce of London was again renowned. Aelfred had rescued the city from the Dane; he had built a citadel for her defence, the germ of that Tower which was to be <num value="1">first</num> the dwelling-place of kings, and then the scene of the martyrdom of their victims. Among the laws of Aethelstan, none are more remarkable than those which deal with the internal affairs of London, and with the regulation of her earliest commercial corporations. Her institutes speak of a commerce spread over all the lands which bordered on the Western Ocean. Flemings and Frenchmen, men of Ponthieu, of Brabant, and of Luttich, filled her markets with their wares, and enriched the civic coffers with their toils. Thither, too, came the men of Rouen, whose descendants were, at no distant day, to form a considerable element among her own citizens; and, worthy and favoured above all, came the seafaring men of the old Saxon brother-land, the pioneers of the mighty Hansa of the north, which was in days to come to knit together London and Novgorod in <num value="1">one</num> bond of commerce, and to dictate laws and distribute crowns among the nations <pb id="p.450" n="450"> by whom London was now threatened. The demand for toll and tribute fell lightly on those whom the English legislation distinguished as the <hi rend=italics>men of the Emperor</hi>.</QUOTE>
<p>In <date value="994">994</date>, Olaf king of Norway, and Sweyn king of Denmark, summoning their robber chieftains from their fir-woods, fiords, and mountains, sailed up the Thames in <num value="94">ninety-four</num> war vessels, eager to plunder the wealthy London of the Saxons. The brave burghers, trained to handle spear and sword, beat back, however, the hungry foemen from their walls --the rampart that tough Roman hands had reared, and the strong tower which Alfred had seen arise on the eastern bank of the river.
<p>But it was not only to such worldly bulwarks that the defenders of London trusted. On that day, says the chronicler, the Mother of God, <QUOTE>of her mild-heartedness,</QUOTE> rescued the Christian city from its foes. An assault on the wall, coupled

 with an attempt to burn the town, was defeated, with great slaughter of the besiegers; and the <num value="2">two</num> kings sailed away the same day in wrath and sorrow.
<p>During the year <datestruct value="998"><year reg="998">998</year></datestruct> a great <QUOTE>gemot</QUOTE> was held at London. Whether any measures were taken to resist the Danes does not appear; but the priests were busy, and Wulfsige, Bishop of the Dorsaetas, took measures to substitute monks for canons in his cathedral church at Sherborne; and the king restored to the church of Rochester the lands of which he had robbed it in his youth.
<p>In <datestruct value="1009--"><year reg="1009">1009</year></datestruct> the Danes made several vain attempts on London.
<p>In <datestruct value="1013--"><year reg="1013">1013</year></datestruct> Sweyn, the Dane, marched upon the much-tormented city of ships; but the hardy citizens were again ready with bow and spear.

 <pb id="p.452" n="452"> perished in vainly seeking for the fords. The assaults were as unsuccessful as those of Sweyn and Olaf, <num value="19">nineteen</num> years before, for King Ethelred's right hand was Thorkill, a trusty Dane. <QUOTE>For the <num value="4">fourth</num> time in this reign,</QUOTE> says Mr. Freeman, <QUOTE>the invaders were beaten back from the great merchant city.</QUOTE> Years after London yielded to Sweyn; then again, in Ethelred's last days, it resisted bravely its enemies; till at last Ethelred, weary of Dane and Saxon, died, and was buried St. Paul's. The <num value="2">two</num> great factions of Danes and Saxons had now to choose a king.
<P>Canute the Dane was chosen as king at Southampton; but the Londoners were so rich, free, and powerfull that they held a rival <hi rend=italics>gemot</hi>, and with <num value="1">one</num> voice elected the Saxon atheling <hi rend=italics>Edmund</hi>
Ironside, who was crowned by Archbishop Lyfing within the city, and very probably at St. Paul's. Canute, enraged at the Londoners, at once sailed for London with his army, and, halting at Greenwich, planned the immediate siege of the rebellious city. The great obstacle to his advance was the fortified bridge that had so often hindered the Danes. Canute, with prompt energy, instantly had a great canal dug on the southern bank, so that his ships might turn the flank of the bridge; and, having overcome this great difficulty, he dug another trench around the northern and western sides of the city. London was now circumvallated, and cut off from all supply of corn and cattle; but the citizen's hearts were staunch, and, baffling every attempt of Canute to sap or escalade, the Dane soon raised the siege. In the meantime, Edmund Ironside was not forgetful of the city that had chosen him as king. After <num value="3">three</num> battles, he compelled the Danes to raise their <num value="2">second</num> siege. In a <num value="4">fourth</num> battle, which took place at Brentford, the Danes were again defeated, though not without considerable losses on the side of the victors, many of the Saxons being drowned in trying to ford the river after their flying enemies. Edmund then returned to Wessex to gather fresh troops, and in his absence Canute for the <num value="3">third</num> time laid siege to London. Again the city held out against every attack, and <QUOTE>Almighty God,</QUOTE> as the pious chroniclers say, <QUOTE>saved the city.</QUOTE>
<p>After the division of England between Edmund and Canute had been accomplished, the London citizens made peace with the Danes, and the latter were allowed to winter as friends in the unconquered city; but soon after the partition Edmund Ironside died in London, and thus Canute became the sole king of England.
<p>On the succession of Harold I. (Canute's natural son), says Mr. Freeman, we find a new element, the <QUOTE>lithsmen,</QUOTE> the seamen of London. <QUOTE>The great city still retained her voice in the election of kings; but that voice would almost seem to have been transferred to a new class among the population. We hear now not of the citizens, but of the sea-faring men. Every invasion, every foreign settlement of any kind within the kingdom too, in every age, added a new element to the population of London. As a Norman colony settled in London later in the century, so a Danish colony settled there now. Some accounts tell us, doubtless with great exaggeration, that London had now almost become a Danish city (William of Malmesbury, ii. <num value="188">188</num>); but it is, at all events,
<hi rend=italics>quite</hi> certain the Danish element in the city was numerous and powerful, and that its voice strongly helped to swell the cry which was raised in favour of Harold.</QUOTE>
<P>It seems doubtful how far the London citizens in the Saxon times could claim the right to elect kings. The latest and best historian of this period seems to think that the Londoners had no special privileges in the <hi rend=italics>gemot; but</hi>, of course, when the
<hi rend=italics>gemot</hi> was held in London, the citizens, intelligent and united, had a powerful voice in the decision. Hence it <hi rend=italics>arose that the citizens</hi> both of London and Winchester (which had been an old seat of the Saxon kings) <QUOTE>seem,</QUOTE> says Mr. Freeman, <QUOTE>to be mentioned as electors of kings as late as the accession of Stephen. (See William of Malmesbury, <title>Hist. Nov.</title>, i. <num value="11">11</num>.) Even as late as the year <datestruct value="1461"><year reg="1461">1461</year></datestruct>, Edward Earl of March was elected by a tumultuous assembly of the citizens of London;</QUOTE> and again, at a later period, we find the citizens foremost in the revolution which placed Richard III. on the throne in <datestruct value="1483--"><year reg="1483">1483</year></datestruct>. These are plainly vestiges of the right which the citizens had more regularly exercised in the elections of Edmund Ironside and of Harold the son of Cnut.
<p>The city of London, there can be no doubt, soon emancipated itself from the jurisdiction of earls like Leofwin, who ruled over the home counties. It acquired, by its own secret power, an unwritten charter of its own, its influence being always important in the wars between kings and their rivals, or kings and their too-powerful nobles. <QUOTE>The king's writs for homage,</QUOTE> says a great authority, <QUOTE>in the Saxon times, were addressed to the bishop, the portreeve or portreeves, to the burgh thanes, and sometimes to the whole people.</QUOTE>
<p>Thus it may clearly be seen, even from the scanty materials we are able to collect, that London, as far back as the Saxon times, was destined to achieve greatness, political and commercial <pb id="p.453" n="453">

<P>The English Jews, that eminently commercial race, were, as we have shown in our chapter on Old Jewry, our <num value="1">first</num> bankers and usurers. To them in immediate succession, followed the enterprising Lombards, a term including the merchants and goldsmiths of Genoa, Florence, and Venice. Utterly blind to all sense of true liberty and justice, the strong-handed king seems to have resolved to squeeze and crush them, as he had squeezed and crushed their unfortunate predecessors. They were rich and they were strangers --that was enough for a king who wanted money badly. At <num value="1">one</num> fell swoop Edward seized the Lombards' property and estates. Their debtors naturally approved of the king's summary measure. But the Lombards grew and flourished, like the trampled camomile, and in the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century advanced a loan to the state on the security of the Customs. The Steelyard merchants also advanced loans to our kings, and were always found to be available for national emergencies, and so were the Merchants of the Staple, the Mercers' Company, the Merchant Adventurers, and the traders of Flanders.
<p>Up to a late period in the reign of Charles I. the London merchants seem to have deposited their surplus cash in the Mint, the business of which was carried on in the Tower. But when Charles I., in an agony of impecuniosity, seized like a robber the <measure value="200000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="200000">200,000</num></measure> there deposited, calling it a loan, the London goldsmiths, who ever since <datestruct value="1386--"><year reg="1386">1386</year></datestruct> had been always more or less bankers, now monopolised the whole banking business. Some merchants, distrustful of the goldsmiths in these stormy times, entrusted their money to their clerks and apprentices, who too often cried, <QUOTE>Boot, saddle and horse, and away!</QUOTE> and at once started with their spoil to join Rupert and his pillaging Cavaliers. About <datestruct value="1645--"><year reg="1645">1645</year></datestruct>-the citizens returned almost entirely to the goldsmiths, who now gave interest for money placed in their care, bought coins, and sold plate. The Company was not particular. The Parliament, out of plate and old coin, had coined gold, and <num value="7">seven</num> millions of half-crowns. The goldsmiths culled out the heavier pieces, melted them down, and exported them. The merchants' clerks, to whom their masters' ready cash was still sometimes entrusted, actually had frequently the brazen impudence to lend money to the goldsmiths, at fourpence per cent. per diem; so that the merchants were often actually lent their own money, and had to pay for the use of it. The goldsmiths also began now to receive rent and allow interest for it. They gave receipts for the sums they received, and these receipts were to all intents and purposes marketable as bank-notes.
<p>Grown rich by these means, the goldsmiths were often able to help Cromwell with money in advance on the revenues, a patriotic act for which we may be sure they took good care not to suffer. When the great national disgrace occurred--the Dutch sailed up the Medway and burned some of our ships--there was a run upon the goldsmiths, but they stood firm, and met all demands. The infamous seizure by Charles II. of <num value="1300000">1,300,000</num>, deposited by the London goldsmiths in the Exchequer, all but ruined these too confiding men, but clamour and pressure compelled the royal embezzler to at last pay <num value="6">six</num> per cent. on the sum appropriated. In the last year of William's reign, interest was granted on the whole sum at <num value="3">three</num> per cent., and the debt still remains undischarged. At last a Bank of England, which had been talked abot and wished for by commercial men ever since the year <datestruct value="1678"><year reg="1678">1678</year></datestruct>, was actually started, and came into operation.
<p>That great financial genius,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.453.3">William Paterson</lemma>, the founder of the Bank of England, was born in <datestruct value="1658--"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>, of a good family, at Lochnaber, in Dumfriesshire. He is supposed, in early life, to have preached among the persecuted Covenanters. He lived a good deal in Holland, and is believed to have been a wealthy merchant in New Providence (the Bahamas), and seems to have shared in Sir William Phipps' successful undertaking of raising a Spanish galleon with <num value="300000">300,000</num> worth of sunken treasure. It is absurdly stated that he was at <num value="1">one</num> time a buccaneer, and so gained a knowledge of Darien and the ports of the Spanish main. That he knew and obtained information from Captains <pb id="p.454" n="454"> Sharpe, Dampier, Wafer, and Sir Henry Morgan (the taker of Panama), is probable. He worked zealously for the Restoration of <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>, and he was the founder of the Darien scheme. He advocated the union of Scotland, and the establishment of a Board of Trade.
<p>The project of a Bank of England seems to have been often discussed during the Commonwealth, and was seriously proposed at the meeting of the <num value="1">First</num> Council of Trade at Mercers' Hall after the Restoration. Paterson has himself described the <num value="1">first</num> starting of the Bank, in his <title>Proceedings at the Imaginary Wednesday's Club,</title> <datestruct value="1717--"><year reg="1717">1717</year></datestruct>. The <num value="1">first</num> proposition of a Bank of England was made in <datestruct VALUE="1691-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1691">1691</year></datestruct>, when the Government had contracted <measure value="3000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000000">3,000,000</num></measure> of debt in <num value="3">three</num> years, and the Ministers even stooped, hat in hand, to borrow <num value="100000">100,000</num> or <num value="200000">200,000</num> at a time of the Common Council of London, on the <num value="1">first</num> payment of the land-tax, and all payable with the year, the common councillors going round and soliciting from house to house. The <num value="1">first</num> project was badly received, as people expected an immediate peace, and disliked a scheme which had come from Holland- <QUOTE>they had too many Dutch things already.</QUOTE> They also doubted the stability of William's Government. The money, at this time, was terribly debased, and the national debt increasing yearly. The ministers preferred ready money by annuities for <num value="99">ninety-nine</num> years, and by a lottery. At last they ventured to try the Bank, on the express condition that if a moiety, <num value="1200000">1,200,000</num>, was not collected by <datestruct VALUE="1699-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1699">1699</year></datestruct>, there should be no Bank, and the whole <measure value="1200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1200000">1,200,000</num></measure> should be struck in halves for the managers to dispose of at their pleasure. So great was the opposition, that the very night before, some City men wagered deeply that <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3">third</num> of the <num value="1200000">1,200,000</num> would never be subscribed. Nevertheless, the next day <measure value="346000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="346000">346,000</num></measure>, with a <num value="4">fourth</num> paid in at once, was subscribed, and the remainder in a few days after. The whole subscription was completed in <num value="10">ten</num> days, and paid into the Exchequer in rather more than <num value="10">ten</num> weeks. Paterson expressly tells us that the Bank Act would have been quashed in the Privy Council but for Queen Mary, who, following the wish of her husband. expressed firmly in a letter from Flanders, pressed the commission forward, after a <num value="6">six</num> hours' sitting.
<p>The Bank Bill, timidly brought forward, purported only to impose a new duty on tonnage, for the benefit of such loyal persons as should advance money towards carrying on the war. The plan was for the Government to borrow <measure value="1200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1200000">1,200,000</num></measure>, at the modest interest of <num value="8">eight</num> per cent. To encourage capitalists, the subscribers were to be incorporated by the name of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. Both Tories and Whigs broke into a fury at the scheme. The goldsmiths and pawnbrokers, says Macaulay, set up a howl of rage. The Tories declared that banks were republican institutions; the Whigs predicted ruin and despotism. The whole wealth of the nation would be in the hands of the <QUOTE>Tonnage Bank,</QUOTE> and the Bank would be in the hands of the Sovereign. It was worse than the Star Chamber, worse than Oliver's <num value="50000">50,000</num> soldiers. The power of the purse would be transferred from the House of Commons to the Governor and Directors of the new Company. Bending to this last objection, a clause was inserted, inhibiting the Bank from advancing money to the House without authority from Parliament. Every infraction of this rule was to be punished by a forfeiture of <num value="3">three</num> times the sum advanced, without the king having power to remit the penalty. Charles Montague, an able man, afterwards <num value="1">First</num> Lord of the Treasury, carried the bill through the House; and Michael Godfrey (the brother of the celebrated Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, supposed to have been murdered by the Papists), an upright merchant and a zealous Whig, propitiated the City. In the Lords (always the more prejudiced and conservative body than the Commons) the bill met with great opposition. Some noblemen imagined that the Bank was intended to exalt the moneyed interest and debase the landed interest; and others imagined the bill was intended to enrich usurers, who would prefer banking their money to lending it on mortgage. <QUOTE>Something was said,</QUOTE> says Macaulay, <QUOTE>about the danger of setting up a gigantic corporation, which might soon give laws to the King and the <num value="3">three</num> estates of the realm.</QUOTE> Eventually the Lords, afraid to leave the King without money, passed the bill. During several generations the Bank of England was emphatically a Whig body. The Stuarts would at once have repudiated the debt, and the Bank of England, knowing that their return implied ruin, remained loyal to William, Anne, and George. <QUOTE>It is hardly too much to say,</QUOTE> writes Macaulay, <QUOTE>that during many years the weight of the Bank, which was' constantly in the scale of the Whigs, almost counterbalanced the weight of the Church, which was as constantly in the scale of the Tories.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE><num value="17">Seventeen</num> years after the passing of the Tonnage Bill,</QUOTE> says the same eminent writer, to show the reliance of the Whigs on the Bank of England, <QUOTE>Addison, in <num value="1">one</num> of his most ingenious and graceful little allegories, described the situation of the great company through which the immense wealth of London was constantly circulating. He <pb id="p.455" n="455"> saw Public Credit on her throne in Grocers' Hall, the Great Charter over her head, the Act of Settlement full in her view. Her touch turned everything to gold. Behind her seat bags filled with coin were piled up to the ceiling. On her right and on her left the floor was hidden by pyramids of guineas. On a sudden the door flies open, the Pretender rushes in, a sponge in <num value="1">one</num> hand, in the other a sword, which he shakes at the Act of Settlement. The beautiful Queen sinks down fainting; the spell by which she has turned all things around her into treasure is broken; the money-bags shrink like pricked bladders; the piles of gold pieces are turned into bundles of rags, or fagots of wooden tallies.</QUOTE>
<p>In <datestruct value="1696--"><year reg="1696">1696</year></datestruct> (very soon after its birth) the Bank experienced a crisis. There was a want of money in England. The clipped silver had been called in and the new money was not ready. Even rich people were living on credit, and issued promissory notes. The <hi rend=italics>stock of</hi> the Bank of England had gone rapidly down from <measure value="110l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="110">110</num></measure> to <num value="83">83</num>. The golsmiths, who detested the corporation that had broken in on their system of private banking, now tried to destroy the new company. They plotted, and on the same <hi rend=italics>day they</hi> crowded to Grocers' Hall, where the Bank was located from <datestruct value="1694--"><year reg="1694">1694</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></datestruct>, and insisted on immediate payment--<num value="1">one</num> goldsmith alone demanding <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure>. The directors paid all their honest creditors, but refused to cash the goldiths' notes, and left them their remedy in Westminster Hall. The goldsmiths triumphed in scurrilous pasquinades entitled, <title>The Last Will and Testament,</title> <title>The Epitaph,</title> <title>The Inquest on the Bank of England.</title> The directors, finding it impossible to procure silver enough to pay every claim, had recourse to an expedient. They made a call of <num value="20">20</num> per cent. on the proprietors, and thus raised a sum enabling them to pay every applicant <num value="15">15</num> per cent. in milled money on what was due to him, and they returned him his note, after making a minute upon it that part had been paid. A few notes thus marked, says Macaulay, are still preserved among the archives of the Bank, as memorials of that terrible year. The alternations were frightful. The discount, at <num value="1">one</num> time <num value="6">6</num> per cent., was presently <num value="24">24</num>. A <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="10">10</num></measure> note, taken for more than <measure value="9l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="9">9</num></measure> in the morning, was before night worth less than <num value="8">8</num>.
<p>Paterson attributes this danger of the Bank to bad and partial payments, the giving and allowing exorbitant interest, high premiums and discounts, contracting dear and bad bargains; the general debasing and corrupting of coin, and such like, by which means things were brought to such a pass that even <num value="8">8</num> per cent. interest on the land-tax, although payable within the year, would not answer. Guineas, he says, on a sudden rose to <measure value="30s." type=currency><num value="30">30</num>s.</measure> per piece, or more; all currency of other money was stopped, hardly any had wherewith to pay; public securities sank to about a moiety of their original values, and buyers were hard to be found even at those prices. No man knew what he was worth; the course of trade and correspondence almost universally stopped; the poorer sort of people were plunged into irrepressible distress, and as it were left perishing, whilst even the richer had hardly wherewith to go to market for obtaining the common conveniences of life.
<P>The King, in Flanders, was in great want of money. The Land Bank could not do much. The Bank, at last, generously offered to advance <measure value="200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200000">200,000</num></measure> in gold and silver to meet the King's necessities. Sir Isaac Newton, the new Master of the Mint, hastened on the re-coinage. Several of the ministers, immediately after the Bank meeting (over which Sir John Houblon presided), purchased stock, as a proof of their gratitude to the body which had rendered so great a service to the State.
<p>The diminution of the old hammered money continued to increase, and public credit began to be put to a stand. The opposers of Paterson wished to alter the denomination of the money, so that <measure value="9d." type=currency><num value="9">9</num>d.</measure> of silver should pass for <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure>, but at last agreed to let sterling silver pass at <measure value="5s. 2d." type=Currency><num value="5">5</num>s. <num value="2">2</num>d.</measure> an ounce, being the equivalent of the milled money. The loss of the re-coinage to the nation was about <measure value="3000000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="3000000">3,000,000</num></measure>. Paterson, who was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> Directors of the Bank of England, upon a qualification of <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure> stock, disagreed with his colleagues on the question of the Bank's legitimate operations, and sold out in <datestruct value="1695--"><year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1701--"><year reg="1701">1701</year></datestruct>, Paterson says, after the peace of Ryswick, he had an audience of King William, and drew his attention to the importance of <num value="3">three</num> great measures --the union with Scotland, the seizing the principal Spanish ports in the West Indies, and the holding a commission of inquiry into the conduct of those who had mismanaged the King's affairs during his absence in Flanders. Paterson died in <datestruct value="1719--"><year reg="1719">1719</year></datestruct>, on the eve of the fatal South Sea Bubble.
<p>When the notes of the Bank were at <num value="20">20</num> per cent. discount, the Government (says Francis) empowered the corporation to add <measure value="1001171l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="1001171">1,001,171</num></measure> <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> to their original stock, and public faith was restored by <num value="4">four</num>-fifths of the subscriptions being received in tallies and orders, and <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5">fifth</num> in bank-notes at their full value, although both were at a heavy discount in the market.
<p>The past services of the Bank were not <pb id="p.456" n="456"> forgotten. The Ministry resolved that it should be enlarged by new subscriptions; that provision should be made for paying the principal of the tallies subscribed in the Bank; that <num value="8">8</num> per cent. should be allowed on all such tallies, to meet which a duty on salt was imposed; that the charter should be prolonged to <datestruct VALUE="710-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="710">710</year></datestruct> ; that before the beginning of the new subscriptions the old capital should be made up to each member <num value="100">100</num> per cent.; and what might exceed that value should be divided among the new members; that the Bank might circulate additional notes to the amount subscribed, provided they were payable on demand, and in default they were to be paid by the Exchequer out of the <num value="1">first</num> money due to the Bank; that no other bank should be allowed by Act of Parliament during the continuance of the Bank of England; that it should be exempt from all tax or imposition; and that no contract made for any Bank stock to be bought or sold should be valid unless registered in the Bank books, and transferred within <num value="14">fourteen</num> days. It was also enacted that not above <num value="2">two</num>-thirds of the directors should be re-elected in the succeeding year. These vigorous measures were thoroughly successful.

<p>The charter was at the same time extended to <datestruct value="1710--"><year reg="1710">1710</year></datestruct>, and not even then to be withdrawn, unless Government paid the full debt. Forgery of the Company's seal, notes, or bills was made felony without benefit of clergy. Sir Gilbert Heathcote, <num value="1">one</num> of the Bank Directors, gained <measure value="60000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="60000">60,000</num></measure> by this scheme. The Bank is said to have offered the King at this time the loan of a million without interest for <num value="21">twenty-one</num> years, if the Government would extend the charter for that time. Bank stock, given to the proprietors in exchange for tallies at <num value="50">50</num> per cent. discount, rose to <num value="112">112</num>. The Bank had lowered the interest of money. As early as <datestruct value="1697"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct> it had proposed to have branch Banks in every city and market town of England.
<p>In <datestruct value="1700--"><year reg="1700">1700</year></datestruct>-<datestruct value="1704--"><year reg="1704">1704</year></datestruct>, the conquests of Louis XIV. alarmed England, and shook the credit of the Bank, In the latter year the Bank Directors were once more obliged to issue sealed bills bearing interest for a large sum, in order to keep up their credit. In <datestruct value="1707--"><year reg="1707">1707</year></datestruct> the fears of an invasion threatened by the Pretender brought down stocks <num value="14">14</num> or <num value="15">15</num> per cent. The goldsmiths then gathered up Bank bills, and tried to press the Directors. Hoare and Child both joined in the attack, and the latter <pb id="p.457" n="457"> pretended to refuse the bills of the Bank. The loyal Whigs, however, instead of withdrawing their deposits, helped it with all their available cash. The Dukes of Marlborough, Newcastle, and Somerset, with others of the nobility, hurried to the Bank with their coaches brimming with heavy bags ot long hoarded guineas. A private individual, who had but <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure>, carried it to the Bank; and on the story being told to the Queen, she sent him <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>, with an obligation on the Treasury to repay the whole <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure>. Lord Godolphin, seeing the crisis, astutely persuaded Queen Anne to allow the Bank for <num value="6">six</num> months an interest of <num value="6">6</num> per cent. on their sealed bills. This, and a call of <num value="20">20</num> per cent. on the proprietors, saved the credit of the Bank. <num value="39">39</num>

 In <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct> the charter was extended to <datestruct value="1732--"><year reg="1732">1732</year></datestruct>. This concession was again vehemently opposed by the enemies of the Bank. Nathaniel Tench, who wrote a reply for the directors, proved that the Bank had never bought land, or monopolised any other commodity, and had, on the contrary, increased and encouraged trade. He asserted that they had never influenced an elector, and had been the chief cause of lowering the interest of money, even in war time. The Government wishing to circulate Exchequer bills, the Bank raised their capital by new subscriptions to <num value="5000000">5,000,000</num>. The new subscriptions were raised in a few hours, and nearly <num value="1">one</num> million more could have been obtained on the same day. <pb id="p.458" n="458">
<p>During the absurd Tory riots of <datestruct value="1709--"><year reg="1709">1709</year></datestruct> the Bank was in considerable danger. A vain, mischievous High Church clergyman named Sacheverell had been foolishly prosecuted for attacking the Whig Government, and calling the Lord Treasurer Godolphin <title>Volpone</title> (a character in a celebrated play written by Ben Jonson). A guard of butchers escorted the firebrand to his trial at Westminster Hall, at which Queen Anne was present. Riots then broke out, and the High Church mob sacked several Dissenting chapels, burning the pews and pulpits in Lincoln's Inn Fields, Holborn, and elsewhere, and even threatened to use a Dissenting preacher as a holocaust. The rioters at last threatened the Bank. The Queen at once sent her guards, horse and foot, to the City, and left herself unprotected. <QUOTE>Am I to preach or fight?</QUOTE> was the <num value="1">first</num> question of Captain Horsey, who led the cavalry. But the question needed no answer, for the rioters at once dispersed.
<p>In <datestruct value="1713--"><year reg="1713">1713</year></datestruct> the Bank charter was renewed until <datestruct value="1742--"><year reg="1742">1742</year></datestruct>. The great catastrophe of the South Sea Bubble in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, which we shall sketch fully in another chapter, did not injure the Bank. The directors generously tried to save the fallen company, but (as might have been expected) utterly failed. With prudence, perhaps, gained from this national cataclysm, the Bank, in <datestruct value="1722--"><year reg="1722">1722</year></datestruct>, commenced keeping a reserve--the <QUOTE>rest</QUOTE> --that rock on which unshakable credit has ever since been proudly built. In <datestruct value="1728--"><year reg="1728">1728</year></datestruct> no notes were issued by the Bank for less than <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure>, and as part of the note only was printed the clerk's pen supplied the remainder.
<p>In <datestruct value="1742--"><year reg="1742">1742</year></datestruct>, when the charter was renewed till <datestruct value="1762"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>, the loan of <measure value="1600000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1600000">1,600,000</num></measure>, without interest, was required by the Government for the favour. By the act of renewal forging bank-notes, &amp;c., was declared punishable with death.
<p>The Bank was at this time a small and modest building, surrounded by houses, and almost invisible to passers by. There was a church called Christopher le Stocks, afterwards pulled down for fear it should ever be occupied by rioters, and <num value="3">three</num> taverns, too, on the south side, in Bartholomew Lane, just where the chief entrance now is, and about <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num> private buildings. A few years later visitors used to be shown in the bullion office the original bank chest, no larger than a seamen's, and the original shelves and cases for the books of business, to show the extraordinary rapidity with which the institution had struck root and borne fruit.
<p>In <datestruct value="1746--"><year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct>, the capital on which the Bank stock proprietors divided amounted to <measure value="10780000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="10780000">10,780,000</num></measure>. It had been more than octupled in little more than half a century.

It was at the same time made felony without benefit of clergy to forge powers of attorney for receiving dividends, transferring or selling stock. The Government, which had won <num value="12">twelve</num> millions before the <num value="7">Seven</num> Years' War, annihilated the navy of France, and wrested India frbm the French sway, was glad to recruit its treasury by so profitable a bargain with the Bank.

<p>During the formidable riots of <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct> the Bank was in considerable danger.

The Catholic chapels and the tallow-chandlers' shops were universally destroyed; Newgate was sacked and burned. The mob, half thieves, at last decided to march upon the Bank, but precautions had been taken there. The courts and roof Of the building were defended by armed clerks and volunteers, and there were soldiers ready outside. The old pewter inkstands had been melted into bullets.

In a private desk was found a list of his forgeries, ending with these words: <QUOTE>The Bank <num value="1">first</num> began to refuse our acceptances, thereby destroying the credit of our house. The Bank shall smart for it.</QUOTE> After Fauntleroy was hung at Newgate there were obscure rumours in the City that he had been saved by a silver tube being placed in his throat, and that he had escaped to Paris.
<p>Having given a summary of the history of the Bank of England, we now propose to select a series of anecdotes, arranged by dates, which will convey a fuller and more detailed notion of the romance and the vicissitudes of banking life.
<p>The Bank was <num value="1">first</num> established (says Francis) in Mercers' Hall, and afterwards in Grocers' Hall, since razed for the erection of a more stately structure. Here, in <num value="1">one</num> room, with almost primitive simplicity, were gathered all who performed the duties of the establishment. <QUOTE>I looked into the great hall where the Bank is kept,</QUOTE> says the graceful essayist of the day, <QUOTE>and was not a little pleased to see the directors, secretaries, and clerks, with all the other members of that wealthy corporation, ranged in their several stations according to the parts they hold in that just and regular economy.</QUOTE>
<p>Mr. Michael Godfrey, to whose exertions, with those of William Paterson, may be traced the successful establishment of the Bank, met with a somewhat singular fate, on the <datestruct VALUE="1695-07-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>. t that time the transmission of specie was difficult and full of hazard, and Mr. Godfrey left his peaceful avocations to visit Namur, then vigorously besieged by the English monarch. The deputy-governor, willing to flatter the King, anxious to forward his mission, or possibly imagining the vicinity of the Sovereign to be the safest place he could choose, ventured into the trenches. <QUOTE>As you are no adventurer in the trade of war, Mr. Godfrey,</QUOTE> said William, <QUOTE>I think you should not expose yourself to the hazard of it.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Not being more exposed than your Majesty,</QUOTE> was the courtly reply, <QUOTE>should be excusable if I showed more concern?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Yes,</QUOTE> returned William; <QUOTE>I am in my duty, and therefore have a more reasonable claim to preservation.</QUOTE> A cannon-ball at this moment answered the <QUOTE>reasonable claim to preservation</QUOTE> by killing Mr. Godfrey; and it requires no great stretch of imagination to fancy a saturnine smile passing over the countenance of the monarch, as he beheld the fate of the citizen who paid so heavy a penalty for playing the courtier in the trenches of Namur.
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1731-08-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1731">1731</year></datestruct>, a scene was presented which strongly marks the infatuation and ignorance of lottery adventurers. The tickets for the State lottery were delivered out to the subscribers at the Bank of England; when the crowd becoming so great as to obstruct the clerks, they told them, <QUOTE>We deliver blanks to-day, but tomorrow we shall deliver the prizes;</QUOTE> upon which many, who were by no means for blanks, retired, and by this bold stratagem the clerks obtained room to proceed in their business. In this lottery, we read, <QUOTE>Her Majesty presented his Royal Highness the Duke with <num value="10">ten</num> tickets.</QUOTE>
<p>In <datestruct value="1738--"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct> the roads were so infested by highwaymen, and mails were so frequently stopped by the gentlemen in the black masks, that the post-master made a representation to the Bank upon the subject, and the directors in consequence advertised an issue of bills payable at <QUOTE><num value="7">seven</num> days' sight,</QUOTE> that, in case of the mail being robbed, the proprietor of stolen bills might have time to give notice.
<p>The effect of the arrival, in <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct>, of Charles Edward at Derby, upon the National Bank, was alarming indeed. Its interests were involved in those of the State, and the creditors flocked in crowds to obtain payment for their notes. The directors, unprepared for such a casualty, had recourse to a justifiable stratagem; and it was only by this that they escaped bankruptcy. Payment was not refused, but the corporation retained its specie, by employing agents to enter with notes, who, to gain time, were paid in sixpences; and as those who came <num value="1">first</num> were entitled to priority of payment, the agents went out at <num value="1">one</num> door with the specie they had received, and brought it back by another, so that the <hi rend=italics>bondfide</hi> holders of notes could never get near enough to present them. <QUOTE>By this artifice,</QUOTE> says our authority, somewhat quaintly, <QUOTE>the Bank preserved its credit, and literally faced its creditors.</QUOTE>
<p>An extraordinary affair happened about the year <datestruct value="1740"><year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct>. <num value="1">One</num> of the directors, a very rich man, had occasion for <num value="30000">30,000</num>&pound;, which he was to pay as the price of an estate he had just bought. To facili- State the matter, he carried the sum with him to the Bank, and obtained for it a bank-note. On his return home he was suddenly called out upon particular business; he threw the note carelessly on the chimney, but when he came back a few minutes afterwards to lock it up, it was not to be found. No <num value="1">one</num> had entered the room; he could not, therefore, suspect any person. At last, after much ineffectual search, he was persuaded that it had fallen from the chimney into the fire. The director went to acquaint his colleagues with the misfortune that had happened to him; and as he <pb id="p.461" n="461"> was known to be a perfectly honourable man, he was readily believed. It was only about twentyfour hours from the time that he had deposited the money; they thought, therefore, that it would be hard to refuse his request for a <num value="2">second</num> bill. He received it upon giving an obligation to restore the <num value="1">first</num> bill, if it should ever be found, or to pay the money himself, if it should be presented by any stranger. About <num value="30">thirty</num> years afterwards (the director having been long dead, and his heirs in possession of his fortune) an unknown person presented the lost bill at the Bank, and demanded payment. It was in vain that they mentioned to this person the transaction by which that bill was annulled; he would not listen to it. He maintained that it came to him from abroad, and insisted upon immediate payment. The note was payable to bearer, and the <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure> were paid him. The heirs of the director would not listen to any demands of restitution, and the Bank was obliged to sustain the loss. It was discovered afterwards that an architect having purchased the director's house, and taken it down, in order to build another upon the same spot, had found the note in a crevice of the chimney, and made his discovery an engine for robbing the Bank.
<p>In the early part of last century, the practice of bankers was to deliver in exchange for money deposited a receipt, which might be circulated like a modern cheque. Bank-notes were then at a discount; and the Bank of England, jealous of Childs' reputation, secretly collected the receipts of their rivals, determined, when they had procured a very large number, suddenly to demand money for them, hoping that Childs' would not be able to meet their liabilities. Fortunately for the latter, they got scent of this plot; and in great alarm applied to the celebrated Duchess of Marlborough, who gave them a single cheque of <measure value="700000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="700000">700,000</num></measure> on their opponents. Thus armed, Childs' waited the arrival of the enemy. It was arranged that this business should be transacted by <num value="1">one</num> of the partners, and that a confidential clerk, on a given signal, should proceed with all speed to the Bank to get the cheque cashed. At last a clerk from the Bank of England appeared, with a full bag, and demanded money for a large number of receipts. he partner was called, who desired him to present them singly. The signal was given; the confidential clerk hurried on his mission; the partner was very deliberate in his movements, and long before he had taken an account of all the receipts, his emissary returned with <measure value="700000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="700000">7,00000</num></measure>; and the whole amount of <measure value="500000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500000">500,000</num></measure> or <measure value="600000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="600000">600,000</num></measure> was paid by Childs' in Bank of England notes. In addition to the triumph of this manceuvre, Childs' must. have made a large sum, from Bank paper being at a considerable discount.
<p>The day on which a forged note was <num value="1">first</num> presented at the Bank of England forms a remarkable era in its history; and to Richard William Vaughan, a Stafford linendraper, belongs the melancholy celebrity of having led the van in this new phase of crime, in the year <datestruct value="1758"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct>. The records of his life do not show want, beggary, or starvation urging him, but a simple desire to seem greater than he was. By <num value="1">one</num> of the artists employedand there were several engaged on different parts of the notes--the discovery was made. The criminal had filled up to the number of <num value="20">twenty</num>, and deposited them in the. hands of a young lady, to whom he was attached, as a proof of his wealth. There is no calculating how much longer Bank notes might have been free from imitation, had this man not shown with what ease they might be counterfeited. (Francis.)
<p>The circulation of .<num value="1">1</num> notes led to much forgery, and to a melancholy waste of human life. Considering the advances made in the mechanical arts, small notes were rough, and even rude in their execution. Easily imitated, they were also easily circulated, and from <datestruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct> the executions for forgery augmented to an extent which bore no proportion to any other class of crime. During <num value="6">six</num> years prior to their issue there was but <num value="1">one</num> capital conviction; during the <num value="4">four</num> following years <num value="85">eighty-five</num> occurred. The great increase produced inquiry, which resulted in an Act <QUOTE>For the better prevention of the forgery of the notes and bills of exchange of persons carrying on the business of banker.</QUOTE>
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1758"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct> a judgment was given by the Lord Chief Justice in connection with some notes which were stolen from <num value="1">one</num> of the mails. he robber, after stopping the coach and taking out all the money contained in the letters, went boldly to a Mr. Miller, at the Hatfield post-office, who unhesitatingly exchanged <num value="1">one</num> of them. Here he ordered a post-chaise, with <num value="4">four</num> horses, and at several stages passed off the remainder. They were, however, stopped at the Bank, and an action was brought by the possessor to recover the money. he question was an important <num value="1">one</num>, and it was decided by the law authorities, <QUOTE>that any person paying a valuable consideration for a Bank note, payable to bearer, in a fair course of business, has an undoubted right to recover the money of the Bank.</QUOTE> The action was maintained upon the plea that the figure <num value="11">11</num>, denoting the date, had been converted by the robber to a <num value="4">4</num>. <pb id="p.462" n="462">
<p>A new crime was discovered in <datestruct value="1767--"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>. The notice of the clerks at the Bank had been attracted by the habit of William Guest, a teller, of picking new from old guineas without assigning any reason. An indefinite suspicion-increased by the knowledge that an ingot of gold had been seen in Guest's possession-arose, and although he asserted that it came from Holland, it was very unlike the regular bars of gold, and had a large quantity of copper at the back. Attention being thus drawn to the behaviour of Guest, he was observed to hand <num value="1">one</num> Richard Still some guineas, which he took from a private drawer, and placed with the others on the table. Still was immediately followed, and on the examination of his money <num value="3">three</num> of the guineas in his possession were deficient in weight. An inquiry was immediately instituted. <num value="40">Forty</num> of the guineas in the charge of Guest looked fresher than the others upon the edges, and weighed much less than the legitimate amount. On searching his house some gold filings were found, with instruments calculated to produce artificial edges. Proofs soon multiplied, and the prisoner was found guilty. The instrument with which he had effected his fraud, of which <num value="1">one</num> of the witnesses asserted it
<FIGURE id="Fig.462" n="2000.06.0168"><HEAD>The Bank Parlour, Exterior View.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 was the greatest improvement he had ever seen, is said to be yet in the Mint.
<p>In <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct> an action interesting to the public was brought against the Bank. It appeared from the evidence that some stock stood in the joint names of a man and his wife; and by the rules of the corporation the signatures of both were required before it could be transferred. To this the husband objected, and claimed the right of selling without his wife's signature or consent. The Court of King's Bench decided in favour of the plaintiff, with full costs of suit, Lord Mansfield believing that <QUOTE>it was highly <hi rend=italics>cruel and oppressive</hi> to withhold from the husband his right of transferring.</QUOTE>
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1772-06-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, Neale and Co., bankers, in Threadneedle Street, stopped payment; other failures resulted in consequence, and throughout the City there was a general consternation. The timely interposition of the Bank, and the generous assistance of the merchants, prevented many of the expected stoppages, and trade appeared restored to its former security. It was, however, only an appearance; for on Monday, the <num value="22">22nd</num> of the same month, may be read, in a contemporary authority, a description of the prevailing agitation, which <pb id="p.463" n="463">
<FIGURE id="Fig.463" n="2000.06.0169"><HEAD>Dividend Day at the Bank</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <pb id="p.464" n="464"> forcibly reminds us of a few years ago. <QUOTE>It is beyond the power of words to describe the general consternation of the metropolis at this instant. No event for <num value="50">fifty</num> years has been remembered to give so fatal a blow to trade and public credit. A universal bankruptcy was expected; the stoppage of almost every banker's house in London was looked for; the whole city was in an uproar; many of the <num value="1">first</num> families were in tears. This melancholy scene began with a rumour that <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest bankers in London had stopped, which afterwards proved true. A report at the same time was propagated that an immediate stoppage of the greatest Bank of all must take place. Happily this proved groundless; the principal merchants assembled, and means were concocted to revive trade and preserve the national credit.</QUOTE>
<p>The desire of the directors to discover the makers of forged notes produced a considerable amount of anxiety to <num value="1">one</num> whose name is indelibly associated with British art. George Morland--a name rarely mentioned but with feelings of pity and regrethad, in his eagerness to avoid incarceration for debt, retired to an obscure hiding-place in the suburbs of London. <QUOTE>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion,</QUOTE> says Allan Cunningham, <QUOTE>he hid himself in Hackney, where his anxious looks and secluded manner of life induced some of his charitable neighbours to believe him a maker of forged notes. The directors of the Bank dispatched <num value="2">two</num> of their most dexterous emissaries to inquire, reconnoitre, search and seize. The men arrived, and began to draw lines of circumvallation round the painter's retreat. He was not, however, to be surprised: mistaking those agents of evil mien for bailiffs, he escaped from behind as they approached in front, fled into Hoxton, and never halted till he had hid himself in London. Nothing was found to justify suspicion; and when Mrs. Morland, who was his companion in this retreat, told them who her husband was, and showed them some unfinished pictures, they made such a report at the Bank, that the directors presented him with a couple of Bank notes of <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> each, by way of compensation for the alarm they had given him.</QUOTE>
<p>The proclamation of peace in <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>, says Francis, was indirectly an expense to the Bank, although hailed with enthusiasm by the populace. The war with America had assumed an aspect which, with all thinking men, crushed every hope of conquest. It was therefore amid a general shout of joy that on Monday, the <datestruct VALUE="1783-10-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>, the ceremonial took place. A vast multitude attended, and the people were delighted with the suspension of war. The concourse was so great that Temple Bar was opened with difficulty, and the Lord Mayor's coachman was kept <num value="1">one</num> hour before he was able to turn his vehicle. The Bank only had reason to regret, or at least not to sympathise so freely with the public joy. During the hurry attendant on the proclamation at the Royal Exchange, when it may be supposed the sound of the music and the noise of the trumpet occupied the attention of the clerk more than was beneficial for the interests of his employers, <num value="14">fourteen</num> notes of--<measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure> each were presented at the office and cash paid for them. The next day they were found to be forged.
<p>In <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct> Mathison's celebrated forgeries were committed. John Mathison was a man of great mechanical capacity, who, becoming acquainted with an engraver, unhappily acquired that art which ultimately proved his ruin. A yet more dangerous qualification was his of imitating signatures with remarkable accuracy. Tempted by the hope of sudden wealth, his <num value="1">first</num> forgeries were the notes of the Darlington Bank. This fraud was soon discovered, and a reward being offered, with a description of his person, he escaped to Scotland. here, scorning to let his talents lie idle, he counterfeited the notes of the Royal Bank of Edinburgh, amused himself by negotiating them during a pleasure excursion through the country, and reached London, supported by his imitative talent. Here a fine sphere opened for his genius, which was so active, that in <num value="12">twelve</num> days he had bought the copper, engraved it, fabricated notes, forged the water-mark, printed and negotiated several. When he had a sufficient number, he travelled from <num value="1">one</num> end of the kingdom to the other, disposing of them. Having been in the habit of procuring notes from the Bank (the more accurately to copy them), he chanced to be there when a clerk from the Excise Office paid in <num value="7000">7,000</num> guineas, <num value="1">one</num> of which was scrupled. Mathison, from a distance, said it was a good <num value="1">one</num>; <QUOTE>then,</QUOTE> said the Bank clerk, on the trial, <QUOTE>I recollected him.</QUOTE> . The frequent visits of Mathison, who was very incautious, together with other circumstances, created some suspicion that he might be connected with those notes, which, since his <num value="1">first</num> appearance, had been presented at the Bank. On another occasion, when Mathison was there, a forged note of his own was presented, and the teller, half in jest and half in earnest, charged Maxwell, the name by which he was known, with some knowledge of the forgeries. Further suspicion was ex cited, and directions were given to detain him at some future period. The following day the teller was informed that <QUOTE>his friend Maxwell,</QUOTE> as he was styled ironically, was in Cornhill. The clerk <pb id="p.465" n="465"> instantly went, and under pretence of having paid Mathison a guinea too much on a previous occasion, and of losing his situation if the mistake were not rectified in the books, induced him to return with him to the hall; from which place he was taken before the directors, and afterwards to Sir John Fielding. To all the inquiries he replied, <QUOTE>He had a reason for declining to answer. He was a citizen of the world, and knew not how he had come into it, or how he should go out of it.</QUOTE> Being detained during a consultation with the Bank solicitor, he suddenly lifted up the sash and jumped out of the window. On being taken and asked his motive, if innocent, he said, <QUOTE>It was his humour.</QUOTE>
<p>In the progress of the inquiry, the Darlington paper, containing his description, was read to him, when he turned pale, burst into tears, and saying he was a dead man, added, <QUOTE>Now I will confess all.</QUOTE> He was, indeed, found guilty only on his own acknowledgment, which stated he could accomplish the whole of a note in <num value="1">one</num> day. It was asserted at the time, that, had it not been for his confession, he could not have been convicted. He offered to explain the secret of his discovery of the method of imitating the water-mark, on the condition that the corporation would spare his life; but his proposal was rejected, and he subsequently paid the full penalty of his crime.
<p>The conviction that some check was necessary grew more and more peremptory as the evils of the system were exposed. In <num value="14">fourteen</num> years from the <num value="1">first</num> issue of. small notes, the number of convictions had been centupled. In the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="10">ten</num> years of the present century, &pound;--<num value="101061">101,061</num> were refused payment, on the plea of forgery. In the <num value="2">two</num> years preceding the appointment of the commission directed by Government to inquire into the facts connected with forging notes, nearly <measure value="60000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="60000">60,000</num></measure> were presented, being an increase of <num value="300">300</num> per cent. In <datestruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>, the entire cost of prosecutions for forgeries was i&pound;,<num value="500">500</num>, and in the last <num value="3">three</num> months of <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct> it was near <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure>. Sir Samuel Romilly said that <QUOTE>pardons were sometimes found necessary; but few were granted except under circumstances of peculiar qualification and mitigation. He believed the sense and feeling of the people of England were against the punishment of death for forgery. It was clear the severity of the punishment had not prevented the crimes.</QUOTE>
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> instance of fraud, to a great amount, was perpetrated by <num value="1">one</num> of the confidential servants of the corporation. In the year <datestruct value="1803"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, Mr. Bish, a member of the Stock Exchange, was applied to by Mr. Robert Astlett, cashier of the Bank of England, to dispose of some Exchequer bills. When they were delivered into Mr. Bish's hands, he was greatly astonished to find not only that these bills had been previously in his possession, but that they had been also delivered to--the Bank. Surprised at this, he immediately opened a communication with the directors, which led to the discovery of the fraud and the apprehension of Robert Astlett. By the evidence produced on the trial, it appeared that the prisoner had been placed in charge of all the Exchequer bills brought into the Bank, and when a certain number were collected, it was his duty to arrange them in bundles, and deliver them to the directors in the parlour, where they were counted and a receipt given to the cashier. This practice had been strictly adhered to; but the prisoner, from his acquaintance with business, had induced. the directors to believe that he had handed them bills to the amount of <measure value="700000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="700000">700,000</num></measure>, when they were only in possession of <measure value="500000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500000">500,000</num></measure>. So completely had he deceived these gentlemen, that <num value="2">two</num> of the body vouched by their signatures for the delivery of the larger amount.
<p>He was tried for the felonious embezzlement of <num value="3">three</num> bills of exchange of <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> each. He escaped hanging, but remained a miserable prisoner in Newgate for many years.
<p>In <datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct> Vincent Alessi, a native of <num value="1">one</num> of the Italian States, went to Birmingham, to choose some manufactures likely to return a sufficient profit in Spain. Amongst others he sought a brass-founder, who showed him that which he required, and then drew his attention to <QUOTE>another article,</QUOTE> which he said he could sell cheaper than any other person in the trade. Mr. Alessi declined purchasing this, as it appeared to be a forged bank-note; upon which he was shown some dollars, as fitter for the Spanish market. These also were declined, though it is not much to the credit of the Italian that he did not at once denounce the dishonesty of the Birmingham brass-founder. It would seem, however, from what followed, that Mr. Alessi was not quite unprepared, as, in the evening, he was called on by <num value="1">one</num> John Nicholls, and after some conversation, he agreed to take a certain quantity of notes, of different values, which were to be paid for at the rate of <measure value="6s." type=currency><num value="6">six</num> shillings</measure> in the pound.
<p>Alessi thought this a very profitable business, while it lasted, as he could always procure as many as he liked, by writing for so many dozen candlesticks, calling them Nos. <num value="5">5</num>, <num value="2">2</num>, or I, according to the amount of the note required. The vigilance of the English police, however, was too much even for the subtlety of an Italian; he was taken by them, and allowed to turn king's evidence, it being <pb id="p.466" n="466">
<NOTE resp=B>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.466.1">Overend and Gurney Trial</lemma></NOTE>
 thought very desirable to discover the manufactory whence the notes emanated.
<p>In December John Nicholls received a letter from Alessi, stating that he was going to America; that he wanted to see Nicholls in London; that he required <num value="20">twenty</num> dozen candlesticks, No. <num value="5">5</num>; twentyfour dozen, No. <num value="1">1</num>; and <num value="4">four</num> dozen, No. <num value="2">2</num>. Mr. Nicholls, unsuspicious of his correspondent's captivity, and consequent frailty, came forthwith to town, to fulfil so important an order. Here an interview was planned, within hearing of the police officers. Nicholls came with the forged notes. Alessi counted up the whole sum he was to pay, at <measure value="6s." type=currency><num value="6">six</num> shillings</measure> in the pound, saying, <QUOTE>Well, Mr. Nicholls, you will take all my money from me.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Never mind, sir,</QUOTE> was the reply; <QUOTE>it will all be returned in the way of business.</QUOTE> Alessi then remarked that it was cold, and put on his hat. This was the signal for the officers. To the dealer's surprise and indignation, he found himself entrapped with the counterfeit notes in his possession, to the precise amount in number and value that had been ordered in the letter.
<p>A curious scene took place in <datestruct VALUE="1818-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>, at the Bank. On the <num value="26">26th</num> of that month, a notice had been posted, stating that books would be opened on the <datestruct value="05-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, and <num value="2">two</num> following days, for receiving subscriptions to the amount of <measure value="7000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="7000000">7,000,000</num></measure> from persons desirous of funding Exchequer bills. It was generally thought that the whole of the sum would be immediately subscribed, and great anxiety was shown to obtain an early admission to the office of the chief cashier. <num value="10">Ten</num> o'clock is the usual time for public business; but at <num value="2">two</num> in the morning many persons were assembled outside the building, where they remained for several hours, their numbers gradually augmenting. The opening of the outer door was the signal for a general rush, and the crowd, for it now deserved that name, next established themselves in the passage leading to the chief cashier's office, where they had to wait another hour or <num value="2">two</num>, to cool their collective impatience. When the time arrived, a further contest arose, and they strove lustily for an entrance. The struggle for preference was tremendous; and the door separating them from the chief cashier's room, and which is of a most substantial size, was forced off its hinges. By far the greater part of those who made this effort failed, the whole <num value="7000000">7,000,000</num> being subscribed by the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="10">ten</num> persons who gained admission.
<p>In <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct> a very extraordinary appeal was made to the French tribunals by a man named J. Costel, who was a merchant of Hamburg, while the free city was in the hands of the French. He accused the general commanding there of employing him to get <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure> worth of English bank-notes changed, which proved to be forged, and he was, in consequence of this discovery, obliged to fly from Hamburg. He also said that Savary, Duke of Rovigo, and Desnouettes, were the fabricators, and that they employed persons to pass them into England, <num value="1">one</num> of whom was seized by the London police, and hanged. Mr. Doubleday asserts that some <num value="1">one</num> had caused a large quantity of French assignats to be forged at Birmingham, with the view of depreciating the credit of the French Republic.
<p>Merchants and bankers now began to declare that they would rather lose their entire fortunes than pour forth the life which it was not theirs to give. A general feeling pervaded the whole interest, that it would be better to peril a great wrong than to suffer an unavailing remorse. <num value="1">One</num> petition against the penalty of death was presented, which bore <num value="3">three</num> names only; but those were an honourable proof of the prevalent feeling. The name of Nathan Meyer Rothschild was the <num value="1">first</num>, <QUOTE>through whose hands,</QUOTE> said Mr. Smith, on presenting the petition, <QUOTE>more bills pass than through those of any <num value="20">twenty</num> firms in London.</QUOTE> The <num value="2">second</num> was that of Overend, Gurney, and Co., through whom <num value="30">thirty</num> millions passed the preceding year; and the <num value="3">third</num> was that of Mr. Sanderson, ranking among the <num value="1">first</num> in the same profession, and a member of the Legislature.
<p>A principal clerk of <num value="1">one</num> of our bankers having robbed his employer of Bank of England notes to the amount of <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure>, made his escape to Holland. Unable to present them himself, he sold them to a Jew. The price which he received does not appear; but there is no doubt that, under the circumstances, a good bargain was made by the purchaser. In the meantime every plan was exhausted to give publicity to the loss. The numbers of the notes were advertised in the newspapers, with a request that they might be refused, and for about <num value="6">six</num> months no information was received of the lost property. At the end of that period the Jew appeared with the whole of his spoil, and demanded payment. which was at once refused on the plea that the bills had been stolen, and that payment had been stopped.
<p>The owner insisted upon gold, and the Bank persisted in refusing. But the Jew was an energetic man, and was aware of the credit of the corporation. He was known to be possessed of immense wealth, and he went deliberately to the Exchange, where, to the assembled merchants of London, in the presence of her citizens, he related publicly that the Bank had refused to honour their own <pb id="p.467" n="467"> bills for <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure>; that their credit was gone, their affairs in confusion; and that they had stopped payment. The Exchange wore every appearance of alarm; the Hebrew showed the notes to corroborate his assertion. He declared that they had been remitted to him from Holland, and as his transactions were known to be extensive, there appeared every reason to credit his statement. He then avowed his intention of advertising this refusal of the Bank, and the citizens thought there must be some truth in his bold announcement. Information reached the directors, who grew anxious, and a messenger was sent to inform the holder that he might receive cash in exchange for his notes.
<p>In <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct> the light sovereigns were called in. The total amount of light coin received from the <datestruct value="06-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct> to the <datestruct value="07-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct> was <measure value="4285837l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4285837">4,285,837</num></measure>, and <measure value="2.75d." type=currency><num value="2.75">2 3/4</num>d.</measure> was the loss on each, taking an average of <num value="35000">35,000</num>. The large sum of <measure value="1400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1400">1,400</num></measure>, in <measure value="1l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1">1</num></measure> notes, was paid into the Bank this year. They had probably been the hoard of some eccentric person, who evinced his attachment to the obsolete paper at the expense of his interest. A few years afterwards a <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> note came in which had been outstanding for about a century and a quarter, and the loss of interest on which amounted to some thousands.
<p>And now a few anecdotes about bank-notes. An eccentric gentleman in Portland Street, says Mr. Grant, in his <title>Great Metropolis,</title> framed and exhibited for <num value="5">five</num> years in <num value="1">one</num> of his sitting-rooms a Bank post bill for <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure>. The <num value="5">fifth</num> year he died, and down came the picture double quick, and was cashed by his heirs. Some years ago, at a nobleman's house near the Park, a dispute arose about a certain text, and a dean present denying there was any such text at all, a Bible was called for. A dusty old Bible was produced, which had never been removed from its shelf since the nobleman's mother had died some years before. When it was opened a mark was found in it, which, on examination, turned out to be a Bank post bill for <measure value="40000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40000">40,000</num></measure>. It might, it strikes us, have been placed there as a reproof to the son, who perhaps did not consult his Bible as often as his mother could have wished. The author of <title>The American in England</title> describes, in <datestruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct>, <num value="1">one</num> of the servants of the Bank putting into his hand Bank post bills, which, before being cancelled by having the signatures torn off, had represented the sum of <num value="5">five</num> millions sterling. The whole made a parcel that could with ease be put into the waistcoat pocket.
<p>The largest amount of a bank-note in current circulation in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct> was <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure>. It is said that <num value="2">two</num> notes for <num value="100000">100,000</num> each, and <num value="2">two</num> for <measure value="50000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50000">50,000</num></measure>, were once engraved and issued. A butcher who had amassed an immense fortune in the war time, went <num value="1">one</num> day with <num value="1">one</num> of these <measure value="50000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50000">50,000</num></measure> notes to a private bank, asking the loan of <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure>, and wishing to deposit the big note as security in the banker's hands, saying that he had kept it for years. The <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure> were at once handed over, but the banker hinted at the same time to the butcher the folly of hoarding such a sum and losing the interest. <QUOTE>Werry true, sir,</QUOTE> replied the butcher, <QUOTE>but I likes the look on't so wery well that I keeps t'other <num value="1">one</num> of the same kind at home.</QUOTE>
<p>As the Bank of England pays an annual average sum of <measure value="70000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="70000">70,000</num></measure> to the Stamp Office for their notes, while other banks pay a certain sum on every note as stamped, the Bank of England never re-issues its notes, but destroys them on return. A visitor to the Bank was <num value="1">one</num> day shown a heap of cinders, which was the ashes of  <measure value="40000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40000000">40,000,000</num></measure> of notes recently burned. The letters could here and there be seen. It looked like a piece of laminated larva, and was about <num value="3">three</num> inches long and <num value="2">two</num> inches broad, weighing probably from <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="12">twelve</num> ounces.
<p>The losses of the Bank are considerable. In <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct> no fewer than <num value="352">352</num> persons were convicted, at a great expense, of forging small notes. In <datestruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct> the yearly losses of the Bank from forgeries on the public funds were upwards of <measure value="40000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40000">40,000</num></measure>.
<p>It is said that in the large room of the Bank a quarter of a million sovereigns will sometimes change hands in the course of the day. The entire amount of money turned over on an average in the day has been estimated as low as <measure value="2000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000000">2,000,000</num></measure>, and as high as <measure value="2500000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2500000">2,500,000</num></measure>. At a rough guess, the number of persons who receive dividends on the <num value="1">first</num> day of every half year exceeds <measure value="100000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure>, and the sum paid away has been estimated at <measure value="500000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500000">500,000</num></measure>.
<p>The number of clerks in the Bank of England was computed, in <datestruct value="1837--"><year reg="1837">1837</year></datestruct>, at <num value="900">900</num>; the engravers and bank-note printers at <num value="38">thirty-eight</num>. The salaries vary from <measure value="700l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="700">700</num></measure> per annum to <measure value="75l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="75">75</num></measure>, and the amount paid to the servants of the entire establishment, about <num value="1000">1,000</num>, upwards of <measure value="200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200000">200,000</num></measure>. Some years ago the proprietors met <num value="4">four</num> times a year. <num value="3">Three</num> directors sat daily in the Bank parlour. On Wednesday a Court of Directors sat to decide on London applications for discount, and on Thursdays the whole court met to consider all notes exceeding <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure>. The directors, <num value="24">twenty-four</num>, exclusive of the Governor and Deputy-Governor, decide by majority all matters of importance.

The north side is remarkable for <num value="3">three</num> exquisite chimney-pieces of statuary marble, the centre being the most magnificent. The east and west are distinguished by columns detached from the walls, supporting beautiful arches, which again support a ceiling rich with ornament. The west leads by folding doors to an elegant octagonal committee-room, with a fine marble chimney-piece. The Governor's room is square, with various paintings, <num value="1">one</num> of which is a portrait of William III. in armour, an intersected ceiling, and semi-circular windows. This chimneypiece is also of statuary marble; and on the wall is a fine painting, by Marlow, of the Bank, Bank Buildings, Cornhill, and Royal Exchange.

In the waiting-room are <num value="2">two</num> busts, by Nollekens, of Charles James Fox and William Pitt. The original Rotunda, by Sir Robert Taylor, was roofed in with timber; but when a survey was made, in <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct> it was found advisable to take it down; and in the ensuing year the

 pelled by steam. This is a self-acting weighing machine, which, with unerring precision, tells which sovereigns are of standard weight, and which are light, and of its own accord separates the <num value="1">one</num> from the other. Imagine a long trough or spout-half a tube that has been split into <num value="2">two</num> sections-of such a semi-circumference as holds sovereigns edge ways, and of sufficient length to allow of <num value="200">two hundred</num> of them to rest in that position <num value="1">one</num> against another. The trough thus charged is fixed slopingly upon the machine, over a little table, as big as the plate of an ordinary sovereign-balance. The coin nearest to the Lilliputian platform drops upo it, being pushed forward by the weight of those behind. Its own weight presses the table down; but how far down? Upon that hangs the whole merit and discriminating power of the machine. At the back and on each side of this small table, <num value="2">two</num> little hammers move by steam backwards and forwards at different elevations. If the sovereign be full weight, down sinks the table too low for the higher hammer to hit it, but the lower <num value="1">one</num> strikes, the edge, and off the sovereign tumbles into a receiver to the left. The table pops up again, receiving, perhaps, a light sovereign, and the higher hammer, having always <num value="1">first</num> strike, knocks it into a receiver to the right, time enough to escape its colleague, which, when it comes forward, has nothing to hit, and returns, to allow the table to be elevated again. In this way the reputation of <num value="33">thirty-three</num> sovereigns is established or destroyed every minute. The light weights are taken to a clipping machine, slit at the rate of <num value="200">two hundred</num> a minute, weighed in a lump, the balance of deficiency charged to the banker from whom they were received, and sent to the Mint to be re-coined. Those which have passed muster are re-issued to the public. The inventor of this beautiful little detector was Mr. Cotton, a former Governor. The comparatively few sovereigns brought in by the general public are weighed in ordinary scales by the tellers.</QUOTE>
<p>The Bank water-mark-or, more properly, the wire-mark--is obtained by twisting wires to the desired form or design, and sticking them on the face of the mould; therefore the design is above the level face of the mould by the thickness of the wires it is composed of. Hence the pulp, in settling down on the mould, must of necessity be thinneron the wire design than on the other parts of the sheet. When the water has run off through the sieve-like face of the mould, the new-born sheet of paper is <QUOTE>couched,</QUOTE> the mould gently but firmly pressed upon a blanket, to which the spongy sheet clings. Sizing is a subsequent process, and, when dry, the water-mark is plainly discernible, being, of course, transparent where the substance is thinnest. The paper is then dried, and made up into reams of <num value="500">500</num> sheets each, ready for press. The water-mark in the notes of the Bank of England is secured to that establishment by virtue of a special Act of Parliament. It is scarcely necessary to inform the reader that imitation of anything whatever connected with a bank-note is an extremely unsafe experiment.
<p>This curious sort of paper is unique. There is nothing like it in the world of sheets. Tested by the touch, it gives out a crisp, crackling, sharp music, which resounds from no other quires. To the eye it shows a colour belonging neither to bluewove, nor yellow-wove, nor cream-laid, but a white, like no other white, either in paper and pulp. The <num value="3">three</num> roughfringy edges are called the <QUOTE>deckelled</QUOTE> edges, being the natural boundary of the pulp when <num value="1">first</num> moulded; the <num value="4">fourth</num> is left smooth by the knife, which eventually cuts the <num value="2">two</num> notes in twain. This paper is so thin that, when printed, there is much difficulty in making erasures; yet it is so strong, that <QUOTE>a water-leaf</QUOTE> (a leaf before the application of size) will support <measure value="36l." type=currency><num value="36">thirty-six</num> pounds</measure>, and, with the addition of <num value="1">one</num> grain of size, will hold half a hundredweight, without tearing. Yet the quantity of fibre of which it consists is no more than eighteen grains and a half.
<P>Dividend day at the Bank has been admirably described, in the wittiest manner, by a modern essayist in Household Words:-- <QUOTE>Another public creditor,</QUOTE> says the writer, <QUOTE><p>appears in the shape of a drover, with a goad, who has run in to present his claim during his short visit from Essex. Near him are a lime-coloured labourer, from some wharf at Bankside, and a painter who has left his scaffolding in the neighbourhood during his dinner hour. Next come several widows--some florid, stout, and young; some lean, yellow, and careworn, followed by a gay-looking lady, in a showy dress, who may have obtained her share of the national debt in another way. As old man, attired in a stained, rusty, black suit, crawls in, supported by a long staff, like a weary pilgrim who has at last reached the golden Mecca. Those who are drawing money from the accumulation of their hard industry, or their patient self-denial, can be distinguished at a glance from those who are receiving the proceeds of unexpected and unearned legacies. The <num value="1">first</num> have a faded, anxious, almost disappointed look, while the <num value="2">second</num> are sprightly, laughing, and observant of their companions.

 stantial capitalists in high check neckties, doublebreasted waistcoats, curly-rimmed hats, narrow trousers, and round-toed boots. Parties of thin, limp, damp-smelling women, come in with mouldy umbrellas and long, chimney-cowl-shaped bonnets, made of greasy black silk, or threadbare black velvet--the worn-out fashions of a past generation.

</LIST></ARGUMENT>

<P>THE Royal Exchange, in the reign of William III., being found vexatiously thronged, the moneydealers, in <datestruct value="1698--"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>, betook themselves to Change Alley, then an unappropriated area. A writer of the period says:-- <QUOTE>The centre of jobbing is in the kingdom of &lsquo;Change Alley. You may go over its limits in about as minute and a half. Stepping but of Jonathan's into the Alley, you turn your face full south; moving on a few paces, and then turning to the east, you advance to Garraway's; from thence, going out at the other door you go on, still east, into Birchin Lane; and then, halting at the Swordblade Bank, you immediately face to the north, enter Cornhill, visit <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> petty provinces there on your way to the west; and thus, having boxed your compass, and sailed round the stockjobbing globe, you turn into Jonathan's again.</QUOTE>
<P>Sir Henry Furnese, a Bank director, was the Reuter of those times. He paid for constant despatches from Holland, Flanders, France, and Germany. His early intelligence of every battle, and especially of the fall of Namur, swelled his profits amazingly. King William gave him a diamond ring as a reward for early information; yet he condescended to fabricate news, and his plans for influencing the funds were probably the types of similar modern tricks. If Furnese wished to buy, his brokers looked gloomy; and, the alarm spread, completed their bargains. In this manner prices were lowered <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> per cent. in a few hours. The Jew Medina, we are assured, granted Marlborough an annuity of <measure value="6000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6000">6,000</num></measure> for permission to attend his campaigns, and amply repaid himself by the use of the early intelligence he obtained.
<P>When, in <datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct>, says <QUOTE>Aleph,</QUOTE> the Pretender landed in Scotland, after the dispersion of his forces, a carriage and <num value="6">six</num> was seen in the road near Perth, apparently destined for London. Letters reached the metropolis announcing the capture of the discomfited Stuart; the funds rose, and a large profit was realised by the trick. Stock-jobbers must have been highly prosperous at that period, as a Quaker, named Quare, a watchmaker of celebrity, who had made a large fortune by money speculations, had for his guests at his daughter's wedding-feast the famous Duchess of Marlborough and the Princess of Wales, who attended with <num value="300">300</num> quality visitors.
<P>During the struggle between the old and new East India Companies, boroughs were sold openly in the Alley to their respective partisans; and in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct> Parliamentary seats came to market there as commonly as lottery tickets. Towards the close of Anne's reign, a well-dressed horseman rode furiously down the Queen's Road, loudly proclaiming her Majesty's demise. The hoax answered, the funds falling with ominous alacrity; but it was observed, that while the Christian jobbers kept aloof, Sir Manasseh Lopez and the Hebrew brokers bought readily at the reduced rate.
<P>The following extracts from Cibber's play of <title>The Refusal, or, the Ladies' Philosophy</title>, produced in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, show the antiquity of the terms <QUOTE>bull</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>bear.</QUOTE> This comedy abounds in allusions to the doings in &lsquo;Change Alley, and <num value="1">one</num> of the characters, Sir Gilbert Wrangle, is a South Sea director:--

And again:--

He was the son of a lighterman, and for many years stood behind a counter and sold books. Acquiring a small amount of ready cash, he was tempted to employ it in Change Alley; it turned
<FIGURE id="Fig.474" n="2000.06.0173"><HEAD>Capel Court.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 to excellent account, and soon led him to a far more profitable traffic in those tickets with which, from the time of Charles II., our seamen were remunerated. They were paid in paper, not readily convertible, and were forced to part with their wages at any discount which it pleased the moneylenders to fix. Guy made large purchases in these tickets at an immense reduction, and by such not very creditable means, with some windfalls during the South Sea agitation, he realised a fortune of <measure value="500000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500000">500,000</num></measure>. Half a million was then almost a fabulous sum, and it was constantly increasing, owing to his penurious habits. He died at the age of <num value="81">eighty-one</num>, leaving by will <measure value="240000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="240000">240,000</num></measure> to the hospital which bears his name. His body lay in <pb id="p.475" n="475"> state at Mercers' Chapel, and was interred in the asylum he raised, where, <num value="10">ten</num> years after his death, a statue was erected to his memory.
<p>Sir John Barnard, a great opponent of stockbrokers, proposed, in <datestruct value="1737--"><year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct>, to reduce the interest on the National Debt from <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="3">three</num> per cent., the public being at liberty to receive their principal in full if they preferred. This anticipation of a modern financial change was not adopted. At this period, <measure value="10000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000000">10,000,000</num></measure> were held by foreigners in British funds. In <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>, the reduction from <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="3">three</num> per cent. interest on the funded debt was effected, and though much clamour followed, no reasonable ground for complaint was alleged, as the measure was very cautiously carried out. Sir John Barnard, the Peel of a bygone age, was com-

 monly denominated the <QUOTE>great commoner.</QUOTE> Of the stock-jobbers he always spoke with supreme contempt; in return, they hated him most cordially. On the money market it was not unusual to hear the merchants inquire, <QUOTE>What does Sir John say to this? What is Sir John's opinion?</QUOTE> He refused the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer in <datestruct value="1746--"><year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct>, and from the moment his statue was set up in Gresham's Exchange he would never enter the building but carried on his monetary affairs outside. The Barnard blood still warms the veins of some of our wealthiest commercial magnates, since his son married the daughter of a capitalist, known in the City as <QUOTE>the great banker, Sir John Hankey.</QUOTE>
<P>Sampson Gideon, the famous Jew broker, died in <datestruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>. Some of his shrewd saying are <pb id="p.476" n="476"> preserved. Take a specimen: <QUOTE>Never grant a life annuity to an old woman; they wither, but they never die.</QUOTE> If the propose annuitant coughed, Gideon called out, <QUOTE>Ay, ay, you may cough, but it shan't save you <num value="6">six</num> months' purchase!</QUOTE> In <num value="1">one</num> of his dealings with Snow, a banker alluded to by Dean Swift, Snow lent Gideon <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure>. The <QUOTE><num value="45">Forty-five</num></QUOTE> followed, and the banker forwarded a whining epistle to him speaking of stoppage, bankruptcy, and concluding the letter with a passionate request for his money. Gideon procured <num value="21000">21,000</num> bank-notes, rolled them round a phial of hartshorn, and thus mockingly repaid the loan.
<hi rend=italics>Gideon's fortune</hi> was made by the advance of the rebels towards London. Stocks fell awfully, but hastening to <QUOTE>Jonathan's,</QUOTE> he bought all in the market, spending all his cash, and pledging his name for more. The Pretender retreated, and the sagacious Hebrew became a millionaire. Mr. Gideon had a sovereign contempt for fine clothes; an essayist of the day writes, <QUOTE>Neither Guy nor Gideon ever regarded dress.</QUOTE> He educated his children in the Christian faith; <QUOTE>but,</QUOTE> said he, <QUOTE>I'm too old to change.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Gideon is dead,</QUOTE> says <num value="1">one</num> of his biographers, <QUOTE>worth more than the whole land of Canaan. He has left the reversion of all his milk and honey-after his son and daughter, and their children--to the Duke of Devonshire, without insisting on his assuming his name, or being circumcised!</QUOTE> His views must have been liberal, for he left a legacy of <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure> to the Sons of the Clergy, and of <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> to the London Hospital. He also gave <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> to the synagogue, on condition of having his remains interred in the Jewish burying-place.
<p>In <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct> the occurrence of some Scotch failures led to a Change-Alley panic, and the downfall of Alexander Fordyce, who, for years, had been the most thriving jobber in London. He was a hosier in Aberdeen, but came to London to improve his fortunes. The money game was in his favour. He was soon able to purchase a large estate. He built a church at his private cost, and spent thousands in trying to obtain a seat in Parliament. Marrying a lady of title, on whom he made a liberal settlement, he bought several Scotch lairdships, endowed an hospital, and founded several charities. But the lease of his property was short His speculations suddenly grew desperate; hopeless ruin ensued; and a great number of capitalists were involved in his fall. The consternation was extreme, nor can we wonder, since his bills, to the amount of <measure value="4000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4000000">4,000,000</num></measure>, were in circulation. He earnestly sought, but in vain, for pecuniary aid. The Bank refused it, and when he applied for help to a wealthy Quaker, <QUOTE>Friend Fordyce,</QUOTE> was the answer, <QUOTE>I have known many men ruined by <hi rend=italics><num value="2">two</num> dice</hi>, but I will not be ruined <hi rend=italics>by <num value="4">Four</num>-dice.</hi></QUOTE>
<p>In <datestruct value="1785--"><year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct>, a stockbroker, named Atkinson, probably from the <QUOTE>North Countree</QUOTE> speculated enormously, but skilfully, we must suppose, for he realised a fortune of <measure value="500000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500000">500,000</num></measure>. His habits were eccentric. At a friend's dinner party he abruptly turned to a lady who occupied the next chair, saying, <QUOTE>If you, madam, will entrust me with <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> for <num value="3">three</num> years, I will employ it advantageously.</QUOTE> The speaker was well known, and his offer accepted; and at the end of the <num value="3">three</num> years, to the very day Atkinson called on the lady with <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>, to which, by his adroit management, her. deposit had increased.
<p>In general (says <QUOTE>Aleph,</QUOTE> in the <title>City Press</title>), a stock-jobber's pursuits tend to shorten life; violent excitement, and the constant alternation of hope and fear, wear out the brain, and soon lead to disease or death. Yet instances of great longevity occur in this class: John Rive, after many active years in the Alley, retired to the Continent, and died at the age of <num value="118">118</num>.
<p>The author of <title>The Bank Mirror</title> (circa <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>) gives a graphic description of the Stock Exchange of that period. <QUOTE>The scene opens,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>about <num value="12">twelve</num>, with the call of the prices of stock, the shouting out of names, the recital of news, &amp;c., much in the following manner:--

 The noise of the screech-owl, the howling of the wolf, the barking of the mastiff, the grunting of the hog, the braying of the ass, the nocturnal wooing of the cat, the hissing of the snake, the croaking of toads, frogs, and grasshoppers-all these in unison could not be more hideous than the noise which these beings make in the Stock Exchange. And as several of them get into the Bank, the beadles are provided with rattles, which they occasionally spring, to drown their noise and give, the fair purchaser or seller room and opportunity to transact their business; for that part of the Rotunda to which the avenue from Bartholomew Lane leads is often so crowded with them that people cannot enter.

<p>About <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>, the shares of this old Stock Exchange having fallen into few hands, they boldly attempted, instead of a sixpenny diurnal admission to every person presenting himself at the bar, to make it a close subscription-room often guineas per annum for each member, and thereby to shut out all petty or irregular traffickers, to increase the revenues of this their monopolised market. A violent democracy revolted at this imposition and invasion of the rights, privileges, and immunities of a public market for the public stock. They proposed to raise <num value="263">263</num> shares of <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure> each, creating a fund of <measure value="13150l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="13150">13,150</num></measure> wherewith to build a new, uninfluenced, unaristocraticised, free, open market. Those shares were never, as in the old conventicle, to condense into a few hands, for fear of a dread aristocracy returning. Mendoza's boxing-room, the debating-forum up Capel Court, and buildings contiguous with the freehold site, were purchased, and the foundation-stone was laid for this temple, to be when completed, consecrated to free, open traffic.
<p>In <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct> Ambrose Charles, a Bank clerk, publicly charged the Earl of Moira, a cabinet minister, with using official intelligence to aid him in speculating in the funds. The Premier was compelled to investigate the charge, but no truthful evidence could be adduced, and the falsehood of his allegations was made apparent.
<p>Mark Sprat, a remarkable speculator, died in <datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>. He came to London with small means, but getting an introduction to the Stock Exchange, was wonderfully successful. In <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct> he contracted for the Lottery; and in <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct> and the <num value="3">three</num> following years he was foremost among those who contracted for the loans. During Lord Melville's trial, he was asked whether he did not act as banker for members of both houses. <QUOTE>I never do business with privileged persons!</QUOTE> was his reply, which might have referred to the following fact:--A broker came to Sprat in great distress. He had acted largely for a principal who, the prices going against him, refused to make up his losses. <QUOTE>Who was the scoundrel?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>A nobleman of immense property.</QUOTE> Sprat volunteered to go with him to his dishonest debtor. The great man coolly answered, it was not convenient to pay. The broker declared that unless the account was settled by a fixed hour next day, his lordship would be posted as a defaulter. Long before the time appointed the matter was arranged, and Sprat's friend rescued from ruin.
<p>The history of the money articles in the London papers is thus given by the author of <title>The City.</title>
n <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct> (says the writer), the papers had commenced regularly to publish the prices of Consols and the other seurities then in the market, but the list was merely furnished by a stockbroker, who was allowed, as a privilege for his services, to append his name and address, thereby receiving the advantages of an advertisement without having to pay for it. A further improvement was effected by inserting small paragraphs, giving an outline of events occurring in relation to City matters, but these occupied no acknowledged position, and only existed as ordinary intelligence. However, from <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct> up to <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>, considerable changes took place in the arrangements of the several daily journals; and a <hi rend=italics>new</hi> era almost commenced in City life with the numerous companies started on the joint-stock principle at the more advanced period, and then it was that this department appears to have received serious attention from the heads of the leading journals. <pb id="p.478" n="478">
<p>The description of matter comprised in City articles has not been known in its present form more than <num value="50">fifty</num> years. There seems a doubt whether they <num value="1">first</num> originated with the <title>Times</title> or the
 <title>Herald</title>. Opinion is by some parties given in favour of the last-mentioned paper. Whichever establishment may be entitled to the praise for commencing so useful a compendium of City news, <num value="1">one</num> thing appears very certain-viz., that no sooner was it adopted by the <num value="1">one</num> paper, than the other followed closely in the line chalked out. The regular City article appears only to have had existence since <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>-<num value="25">25</num>, when the <num value="1">first</num> effect of that over-speculating period was felt in the insolvency of public companies and the breakage of banks. Contributions of this description had been made and published, as already noticed, in separate paragraphs throughout the papers as early as <datestruct value="1811"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>; but these took no very prominent position till the more important period of the close of the war, and the declaration of peace with Europe.
<P>In <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, the case of Benjamin Walsh, M.P., a member of the Stock Exchange, occasioned a prodigious sensation. Sir Thomas Plomer employed him as his broker, and, buying an estate, found it necessary to sell stock. Walsh advised him not to sell directly, as the funds were rising; the deeds were not prepared, and the advice was accepted. Soon after, Walsh said the time to sell was come, for the funds would quickly fall. The money being realised, Walsh recommended the purchase of exchequer bills as a good investment. Till the cash was wanted, Sir Thomas gave a cheque for <measure value="22000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="22000">22,000</num></measure> to Walsh, who undertook to lodge the notes at Gosling's. In the evening he brought an acknowledgment for, <measure value="6000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6000">6,000</num></measure>, promising to make up the amount next day. Sir Thomas called at his bankers, and found that a cheque for <measure value="16000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="16000">16,000</num></measure> had been sent, but too late for presentation, and in the morning the cheque was refused. In fact, Walsh had disposed of the whole; giving <num value="1000">1,000</num> to his broker, purchasing <measure value="11100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="11100">11,100</num></measure> of American stock, and buying <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure> worth of Portuguese doubloons. He was tried and declared guilty; but certain legal difficulties were interposed; the judges gave a favourable decision; he was released from Newgate, and formally expelled from the House of Commons. Such crimes seem almost incredible, for such culprits can have no chance of escape; as, even when the verdict of a jury is favourable, their character and poition must be absolutely and hopelessly lost. .
<P>In these comparatively steady-going times, the funds often remain for months with little or no variation; but during the last years of the French war, a difference of <num value="8">eight</num> or even <num value="10">ten</num> per cent. might happen in an hour, and scripholders might realise eighteen or <num value="20">twenty</num> per cent. by the change in the loans they so eagerly sought. From what a fearful load of ever-increasing expenditure the nation was relieved by the peace resulting from the battle of Waterloo, may be judged from the fact that the decrease of Government charges was at once declared to exceed <measure value="2000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000000">2,000,000</num></measure> per month.
<P><num value="1">One</num> of the most extraordinary Stock Exchange conspiracies ever devised was that carried'out by De Berenger and Cochrane Johnstone in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>. It was a time when Bonaparte's military operations against the allies had depressed the funds, and great national anxiety prevailed. The conspiracy was dramatically carried out. On the <datestruct VALUE="1824-02-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>, about <num value="1">one</num> a.m., a violent knocking was heard at the door of the <QUOTE>Ship Inn,</QUOTE> then the principal hotel of Dover. On the door being opened, a person in richly embroidered scarlet uniform, wet with spray, announced himself as Lieutenant-Colonel De Bourg, aide-de-camp of Lord Cathcart. He had a star and silver medals on his breast, and wore a dark fur travelling cap, banded with gold. He said he had been brought over by a French vessel from Calais, the master of which, afraid of touching at Dover, had landed him about <num value="2">two</num> miles off, along the coast. He was the bearer of important news--the allies had gained a great victory and had entered Paris. Bonaparte had been overtaken by a detachment of Sachen's Cossacks, who had slain and cut him into a <num value="1000">thousand</num> pieces. General Platoff had saved Paris from being reduced to ashes. The white cockade was worn everywhere, and an immediate peace was now certain. He immediately ordered out a post-chaise and <num value="4">four</num>, but <num value="1">first</num> wrote the news to Admiral Foley, the port-admiral at Deal. The letter reached the admiral about <num value="4">four</num> a.m., but the morning proving foggy, the telegraph would not work. Off dashed De Bourg (really De Berenger, an adventurer, afterwards a livery-stable keeper), throwing napoleons to the post-boys every time he changed horses. At Bexley Heath, finding the telegraph could not have worked, he moderated his pace and spread the news of the Cossacks fighting for Napoleon's body. At the Marsh Gate, Lambeth, he entered a hackney coach, telling the post-boys to spread the news on their return. By a little after <num value="10">ten</num>, the rumours reached the Stock Exchange, and the funds rose; but on its being found that the Lord Mayor had had no intelligence, they soon went down again.
<p>In the meantime other artful confederates were at work. The same day, about an hour before <pb id="p.479" n="479"> daylight, <num value="2">two</num> men, dressed as foreigners, landed from a <num value="6">six</num>-oar galley, and called on a gentleman of Northfleet, and handed him a letter from an old friend, begging him to take the bearers to London, as they had great public news to communicate; they were accordingly taken. About <num value="12">twelve</num> or <num value="1">one</num> the same afternoon, <num value="3">three</num> persons (<num value="2">two</num> of whom were dressed as French officers) drove slowly over London Bridge in a post-chaise, the horses of which were bedecked with laurel. The officers scattered billets to the crowd, announcing the death of Napoleon and the fall of Paris. They then paraded through Cheapside and Fleet Street, passed over Blackfriars Bridge, drove rapidly to the Marsh Gate, Lambeth, got out, changed their cocked hats for round ones, and disappeared as De Bourg had done.
<p>The funds once more rose, and long bargains were made; but still some doubt was felt by the less sanguine, as the ministers as yet denied all knowledge of the news. Hour after hour passed by, and the certainty of the falsity of the news gradually developed itself. <QUOTE>To these scenes of joy,</QUOTE> says a witness, <QUOTE>and of greedy expectations of gain, succeeded, in a few hours, disappointment and shame at having been gulled, the clenching of fists, the grinding of teeth, the tearing of hair, all the outward and visible signs of those inward commotions of disappointed avarice in some, consciousness of ruin in others, and in all boiling revenge.</QUOTE> A committee was appointed by the Stock Exchange to track out the conspiracy, as on the <num value="2">two</num> days before Consols and Omnium, to the amount of <measure value="826000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="826000">826,000</num></measure>, had been purchased by persons implicated. Because <num value="1">one</num> of the gang had for a blind called on the
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.479.1">celebrated Lord Cochrane</lemma>, and because a relation of his engaged in the affair had purchased Consols for him, that he might unconsciously benefit by the fraud, the Tories, eager to destroy a bitter political enemy, concentrated all their rage on as high-minded, pure, and chivalrous a man as ever trod a frigate's deck. He was tried <datestruct VALUE="1817-06-21"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=21>21</day>, <year reg=1817>1817</year></datestruct>, at the Court of Queen's Bench, fined <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure>, and sentenced ignominiously to stand <num value="1">one</num> hour in the pillory. This latter part of his sentence the Government was, however, afraid to carry out, as Sir Francis Burdett had declared that if it was done, he would stand beside his friend on the scaffold of shame. To crown all, Cochrane's political enemies had him stripped of his knighthood, and the escutcheon of his order disgracefully kicked down the steps of the chapel in Westminster Abbey. For some years this true successor of Nelson remained a branded exile, devoting his courage to the cause of universal liberty, lost to the country which he loved so much. In his old age tardy justice restored to him his unsoiled coronet, and finally awarded him a grave among her heroes.
<p>The ticket pocketing of <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct> is thus described by the author of <QUOTE>An Expose of the Mysteries of the Stock Exchange:</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Of all the tricks,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE><p>practised against Goldschmidt, the ticket pocketing scheme was, perhaps, the most iniquitous: it was to prevent the buying in on a settling day the balance of the account, and to defeat the consequent rise, thereby making the real bear a fictitious bull account. To give the reader a conception of this, and of the practices as well as the interior of the Stock Exchange, the following attempted delineation is submitted :--The doors open before <num value="10">ten</num>, and at the minute of <num value="10">ten</num> the spirit-stirring rattle grates to action. Consols are, suppose, <num value="69">69</num> to <num value="69">69</num> <num value="1">1</num>/<num value="8">8</num>---that is, buyers at the lower and sellers at the higher price. Trifling manoeuvres and puffing up till <datestruct value="12"><year reg="12">twelve</year></datestruct>, as neither party wish the Government broker to buy under the highest price; the sinkingfund purchaser being the point of diurnal altitude, as the period before a loan is the annually depressed point of price, when the Stock Exchange have the orbit of these revolutions under their own control.
<p>At <num value="12">twelve</num> the broker mounts the rostrum and opens:  <Q>Gentlemen, I am a buyer of <measure value="60000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="60000">60,000</num></measure> Consols for Government, at <num value="69">69</num>.</Q>   <Q>At <num value="1">1</num>/<num value="8">8th</num>, sir,</Q>  the jobbers resound;  <Q><num value="10000">ten thousand</num> of me-<num value="5">five</num> of me--<num value="2">two</num> of me,</Q>  holding up as many fingers. Nathan, Goldschmidt's agent, says,  <Q>You may have them all of me at your own bidding, <num value="69">69</num>.</Q>  In <num value="10">ten</num> minutes this commission is earned from the public, and this state sinking-fund joint stock jobbed. Nathan is hustled, his hat and wig thrown upon the commissioner's sounding-board, and he must stand bare-headed until the porter can bring a ladder to get it down. Out squalls a ticketcarrier,  <Q>Done at <num value="7">7</num>/<num value="8">8</num>;</Q>  again,  <Q>At <num value="0.75">3/4</num>, all a-going;</Q>  and the contractors must go, too; they have served the commissioners at <num value="69">69</num>, when the market was full <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="8">eighth</num>. All must come to market before next omnium payment; they cannot keep it up (yet this operation might have suited the positions of the market). Nathan cries out,  <Q>Where done at <num value="3">3</num>/<num value="4">4th</num>'s?</Q>   <Q>Here-there, there, there!</Q>  Mr. Doubleface, going out at the door, meets Mr. Ambush, a brother bear, with a wink,  <Q>Sir, they are <num value="0.75">3/4</num>ths, I believe, sellers; you may have <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure> thereat, and <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> at <num value="5">5</num>/<num value="8">8</num>ths.</Q>  This is called fiddling: it is allowable to jobbers thus to bring the turn to <num value="1">1</num>/<num value="16">16th</num>, or a <num value="32">32nd</num>, but not to brokers, as thereby the public would not be fleeced <num value="1">1</num>/<num value="8">8th</num>, to the house benefit. <pb id="p.480" n="480">  <Q>Sir, I would not take them at <num value="1">1</num>/<num value="4">4th</num>,</Q>  replies Mr. Ambush.  <Q>Offered at <num value="0.75">3/4</num>ths and <num value="5">5</num>/<num value="8">8</num>ths,</Q>  bawls out an urchin scout, holding up his face to the ceiling, that by the re-echo his spot may not be discovered.</QUOTE>

<p>The system of business at the Stock Exchange is thus described by an accomplished writer on the subject: <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Bargains are made in the presence of a <num value="3">third</num> person. The terms are simply entered in a pocket-book, but are checked the next day; and the jobber's clerk (also a member of the house) pays or receives the money, and sees that the securities are correct. There are but <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> dealers in Exchequer bills. Most members of the Stock Exchange keep their money in convertible securities, so that it can be changed from hand to hand almost at a moment's notice. The brokers execute the orders of bankers, merchants, and private individuals; and the jobbers are the persons with whom they deal. When the broker appears in the market, he is at once surrounded by eager jobbers. <num value="1">One</num> of the cries of the Stock Exchange is,  <Q>Borrow money? borrow money?</Q> a singular cry to general apprehension, but it of course implies that the credit of the borrower must be <num value="1">first</num>-rate, or his security of the most satisfactory nature, and that it is not the principal who goes into the market, but only the principal's broker.  <Q>Have you money to lend to-day?</Q>  is a startling question often asked with perfect
<hi rend=italics>non-chalance</hi> in the Stock Exchange. If the answer is  <Q>Yes,</Q>  the borrower says,  <Q>I want, <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> or <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure>.</Q>   <Q>At what security?</Q>  is the vital question that soon follows.
<P>Another mode of doing business is to conceal the object of the borrower or lender, who asks, What are Exchequer? <Q> The answer may be, <num value="40">Forty</num> and <num value="42">forty-two</num>.</Q>  That is, the party addressed will buy <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> at <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">40</num> shillings</measure>, and sell <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> at <measure value="42s." type=currency><num value="42">42</num> shillings</measure>. The jobbers cluster round the broker, who perhaps says,  <Q>I must have a price in <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure>.</Q>  If it suits them, they will say,  <Q><num value="5">Five</num> with me,</Q>   <Q><num value="5">Five</num> with me,</Q>   <Q><num value="5">Five</num> with me,</Q>  making <num value="15">fifteen</num>; or they will say,  <Q><num value="10">Ten</num> with me;</Q>  and it is the broker's, business to get, these parties pledged to buy of him at <num value="40">40</num>, or to sell to him at <num value="42">42</num>, they not knowing whether he is a buyer or a seller. The broker then declares his purpose, saying, for example,  <Q>Gentlemen, I sell to you <num value="20000">20,000</num> at <num value="40">40</num>;</Q>  and the sum is then apportioned among them. If the money were wanted only for a month, and the Exchequer market remained the same during the time, the buyer would have to give <num value="42">42</num> in the market for what he sold at <num value="40">40</num>, being the difference between the buying and the selling price, besides which he would have to pay the broker <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure> per cent. commission on the sale, and <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure> per cent. on the purchase, again on the bills, which would make altogether <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>s.</measure> per cent. If the object of the broker be to buy Consols, the jobber offers to buy his <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> at <num value="96">96</num>, or to sell him that amount at <num value="96">96</num> <num value="1">1</num>/<num value="8">8</num>, without being at all aware which he is engaging himself to do. The same person may not know on any particular day whether he will be a borrower or a lender. If he has sold stock, and has not re-purchased about <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> o'clock in the day, he would be a lender of money; but if he has bought stock, and not sold, he would be a borrower. Immense sums are lent on condition of being recalled on the short notice of a few hours.</QUOTE>

<p>The uninitiated wonder that any man should borrow <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> or <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure> for a day, or at most a fortnight, when it is liable to be called for at the shortest notice. The directors of a railway company, instead of locking up their money, send the &pound;,<num value="12000">12,000</num> or <measure value="14000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="14000">14,000</num></measure> a week to a broker, to be lent on proper securities. Persons who pay large duties to Government at fixed periods, lend the sums for a week or <num value="2">two</num>. A person intending to lay out his capital in mortgage or real property, lends out the sum till he meets with a suitable offer. The great bankers lend their surplus cash on the Stock Exchange. A jobber, at the close of the day, will lend his money at <num value="1">1</num> per cent., rather than not employ it at all. The extraordinary fluctuations in the rate of interest even in a single day are a great temptation to the money-lender to resort to the Stock Exchange. <QUOTE>Instances have occurred,</QUOTE> says our authority, <QUOTE>when in the morning everybody has been anxious to lend money at <num value="4">4</num> per cent., when about <num value="2">two</num> o'clock money has become so scarce that it could with difficulty be borrowed at <num value="10">10</num> per cent. If the price of Consols be low, persons who are desirous of raising money will give a high rate of interest rather than sell stock.</QUOTE>
<p>The famous Pop-gun Plot was generally supposed to have been a Stock Exchange trick. A writer on stockbroking says: <QUOTE>The Pop-gun Plot, in Palace Yard, on a memorable occasion of the King going to the Parliament House, was never understood or traced home. It is said to have originated in a Stock Exchange hoax.  <Q>Popgun John</Q>  was at the time a low republican in the Stock Exchange, and had a house in or near Palace Yard, from which a missile had been projected. He subsequently grew rich.</QUOTE>
<p>The journals of that day described the hot <pb id="p.481" n="481"> pursuit by the myrmidons being cooled by a well-got--up story that the fugitive suspected had been unfortunately drowned; and in proof, a hat picked up by a waterman at the Nore was brought wet to the police office, and proved to have belonged to the person pursued. The plotter disappeared after this <QUOTE>drowning</QUOTE> for some months, while the hushmoney and sinister manoeuvres were baffling the pursuers. Afterwards, the affair dying away, he reappeared, resuscitated, in the Stock Exchange, making very little secret of this extraordinary affair, and would relate it in ordinary conversation on the Stock Exchange benches, as a philosophical experiment, not intended to endanger the king's life, but certainly planned to frighten the public, so as to effect a fall, and realise a profitable bear

 account; if sufficient to trip up the contractors, the better.
<p>While the dupes of the Cato Street conspiracy were dangling before the <QUOTE>debtor's door,</QUOTE> the surviving adept of the former plot, from his villa not <num value="10">ten</num> miles from London, was mounting his carriage to drive to the Stock Exchange, to operate upon the effect this example might produce in the public mind, and, consequently, realising his now large portion of funded property.
<p>If there are any members now of that standing in the Stock Exchange, they must remember how artlessly the tale of this philosophical experiment used to be told by the contriver of it in a year or <num value="2">two</num> afterwards, in reliance upon Stock Exchange men's honour and confidence. <pb id="p.482" n="482">
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1798"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>, Nathan, the <num value="3">third</num> son of Meyer Anselm Rothschild, of Frankfort, intimated to his father that he would go to England, and there commence business. The father knew the intrepidity of Nathan, and had great confidence in his financial skill: he interposed, therefore, no difficulties. The plan was proposed on Tuesday, and on Thursday it was put into execution.
<p>Nathan was entrusted with <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure>, and though perfectly ignorant of the English language, he commenced a most gigantic career, so that in a brief period the above sum increased to the amount of <num value="60000">60,000</num>. Manchester was his starting-point. He took a comprehensive survey of its products, and observed that by proper management a treble harvest might be reaped from them. He secured the <num value="3">three</num> profitable trades in his grasp-viz., the raw material, the dyeing, and the manufacturingand was consequently able to sell goods cheaper than any <num value="1">one</num> else. His profits were immense, and Manchester soon became too little for his speculative mind. Nevertheless, he would not have left it were it not a private pique against <num value="1">one</num> of his co-religionists, which originated by the dishonouring of a bill which was made payable to him, disgusted him with the Manchester community. In <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>, therefore, he quitted Manchester for the metropolis. With giant strides he progressed in his prosperity. The confused and insecure state of the Continent added to his fortune, and contributed to his fame.
<p>The Prince of Hesse Cassel, in flying from the approach of the republican armies, desired, as he passed through Frankfort, to store a vast amount of wealth, in such a manner as might leave him a chance of recovery after the storm had passed by. He sought out Meyer Anselm Rothschild, and confided all his worldly possessions to the keeping of the Hebrew banker. Meyer Anselm, either from fear of loss or hope of gain, sent the money to his son Nathan, settled in London, and the latter thus alluded to this circumstance: <QUOTE>The Prince of Hesse Cassel gave my father his money; there was no time to be lost; he sent it to me. I had <num value="600000">600,000</num> arrive by post unexpectedly; and I put it to so good use, that the prince made me a present of all his wine and linen.</QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>When the late Mr. Rothschild was alive, if business,</QUOTE> says the author of <title>The City,</title> <QUOTE>ever became flat and unprofitable in the Stock Exchange, the brokers and jobbers generally complained, and threw the blame upon this leviathan of the money market. Whatever was wrong, was always alleged to be the effects of Mr. Rothschild's operations, and, according to the views of these parties, he was either bolstering up, or unnecessarily depressing prices for his own object. An anecdote is related of this great speculator, that hearing on <num value="1">one</num> occasion that a broker had given very strong expression to his feelings in the open market on this subject, dealing out the most deadly anathemas against the Jews, and consigning them to the most horrible torments, he sent the broker, through the medium of another party, an order to sell <measure value="600000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="600000">600,000</num></measure> Consols, saying,  <Q>As he always so abuses me, they will never suspect he is <hi rend=italics>bearing</hi> the market on my account.</Q>  Mr. Rothschild employed several brokers to do his business, and hence there was no ascertaining what in reality was the tendency of his operations. While perchance <num value="1">one</num> broker was buying a certain quantity of stock on the order of his principal in the market, another at the same moment would be instructed to sell; so that it was only in the breast of the principal to know the probable result. It is said that Mrs. Rothschild tried her hand in speculating, and endeavoured by all her influence to get at the secret of her husband's dealings. She, however, failed, and was therefore not very successful in her ventures. Long before Mr. Rothschild's death, it was prophesied by many of the brokers that, when the event occurred, the public would be less alarmed at the influence of the firm, and come forward more boldly to engage in stock business. They have, notwithstanding, been very much mistaken.</QUOTE>
<p>The chronicler of the <title>Stock Exchange </title> says: <QUOTE><num value="1">One</num> cause of Rothschild's success, was the secrecy with which he shrouded all his transactions, and the tortuous policy with which he misled those the most who watched him the keenest. If he possessed news calculated to make the funds rise, he would commission the broker who acted on his behalf to sell half a million. The shoal of men who usually follow the movements of others, sold with him. The news soon passed through Capel Court that Rothschild was bearing the market, and the funds fell. Men looked doubtingly at <num value="1">one</num> another; a general panic spread; bad news was looked for; and these united agencies sunk the price <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> per cent. This was the result expected; other brokers, not usually employed by him, bought all they could at the reduced rate. By the time this was accomplished the good news had arrived; the pressure ceased, the funds arose instantly, and Mr. Rothschild reaped his reward.</QUOTE>
<p>It sometimes happened that notwithstanding Rothschild's profound secrecy, he was overcome by stratagem. The following circumstance, which was related to Mr. Margoliouth by a person who <pb id="p.483" n="483"> knew Rothschild well, will illustrate the above statement. When the Hebrew financier lived at Stamford Hill, there resided opposite to him another very wealthy dealer in the Stock Exchange, Lucas by name. The latter returning home <num value="1">one</num> night at a late hour from a convivial party, observed a carriage and <num value="4">four</num> standing before Rothschild's gate, upon which he ordered his own carriage out of the way, and commanded his coachman to await in readiness his return. Lucas went stealthily and watched, unobserved, the movements at Rothschild's gate. He did not lie long in ambush before he heard some <num value="1">one</num> leaving the Hebrew millionaire's mansion, and going towards the carriage. He saw Rothschild, accompanied by <num value="2">two</num> muffled figures, step into the carriage, and heard the word of command, <QUOTE>To the City.</QUOTE> He followed Rothschild's carriage very closely, but when he reached the top of the street in which Rothschild's office was situated, Lucas ordered his carriage to stop, from which he stepped out, and proceeded, reeling to and fro through the street, feigning to be mortally drunk. He made his way in the same mood as far as Rothschild's office, and <hi rend=italics>sans ceremonie</hi> opened the door, to the great consternation and terror of the housekeeper, uttering sundry ejaculations in the broken accents of Bacchus' votaries. Heedless of the affrighted housekeeper's remonstrances, he opened Rothschild's private office, in the same staggering attitude, and fell down flat on the floor.
<p>Rothschild and his friends became very much alarmed. Efforts were made to restore and remove the would-be drunkard, but Lucas was too good an actor, and was therefore in such a fit as to be unable to be moved hither or thither. <QUOTE>Should a physician be sent for?</QUOTE> asked Rothschild. But the housekeeper threw some cold water into Lucas's face, and the patient began to breathe a little more naturally, and fell into a sound snoring sleep. He was covered over, and Rothschild and the strangers proceeded unsuspectingly to business. The strangers brought the good intelligence that the affairs in Spain were all right, respecting which the members of the Exchange were, for a few days previous, very apprehensive, and the funds were therefore in a rapidly sinking condition. The good news could not, however, in the common course of despatch, be publicly known for another day. Rothschild therefore planned to order his brokers to buy up, cautiously, all the stock that should be in the market by <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock the following day. He sent for his principal broker thus early, in order to entrust him with the important instruction.
<p>The broker was rather tardier than Rothschild's patience could brook; he therefore determined to go himself. As soon as Rothschild was gone, Lucas began to recover, and by degrees was able to get up, though distracted, as he said, <QUOTE>with a violent headache,</QUOTE> and insisted, in spite of the housekeeper's expostulations, upon going home. But Lucas went to his broker, and instructed him to buy up-all the stock he could get by <num value="10">ten</num> o'clock the following morning. About <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock Lucas met Rothschild, and inquired satirically how he, Rothschild, was off for stock. Lucas won the day, and Rothschild is said never to have forgiven <QUOTE>the base, dishonest, and nefarious stratagem.</QUOTE>
<p>Yet, with all his hoardings, says Mr. Margoliouth, Rothschild was by no means a happy man. Dangers and assassinations seemed to haunt his imagination by day and by night, and not without grounds. Many a time, as he himself said, just before he sat down to dinner, a note would be put into his hand, running thus:-- <QUOTE>If you do not send me immediately the sum of <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">five hundred</num> pounds</measure>, I will blow your brains out.</QUOTE> He affected to despise such threats; they, nevertheless, exercised a direful effect upon the millionaire. He loaded his pistols every night before he went to bed, and put them beside him., He did not think himself more secure in his country house than he did in his bed. <num value="1">One</num> day, while busily engaged in his golden occupation, <num value="2">two</num> foreign gentlemen were announced as desirous to see Baron Rothschild <hi rend=italics>inproiprid persond</hi>. The strangers had not the foresight to have the letters of introduction in readiness. They stood, therefore, before the Baron in the ludicrous attitude of having their eyes fixed upon the Hebrew Croesus, and with their hands rummaging in large European coatpockets. The fervid and excited imagination of the Baron conjured up a multitudinous array of conspiracies. Fancy eclipsed his reason, and, in a fit of excitement, he seized a huge ledger, which he aimed and hurled at the mustachioed strangers, calling out, at the same time, for additional physical force. The astonished Italians, however, were not long, after that, in finding the important documents they looked for, which explained all. The Baron begged the strangers' pardon for tie unintentional insult, and was heard to articulate to himself, <QUOTE>Poor unhappy me! a victim to nervousness and fancy's terrors! and all because of my money!</QUOTE>
<p>Rothschild's mode of doing business when engaging in large transactions (says Mr. Grant) was this. Supposing he possessed exclusively, which he often did, a day or <num value="2">two</num> before it could be generally known, intelligence of some event, which had occurred in any part of the Continent, sufficiently important to cause a rise in the French funds, and through them on the English funds, he would <pb id="p.484" n="484"> empower the brokers he usually employed to sell out stock, say to the amount of <num value="500000">500,000</num>. The news spread in a moment that Rothschild was selling out, and a general alarm followed. Every <num value="1">one</num> apprehended that he had received intelligence from some foreign part of some important event which would produce a fall in prices. As might, under such circumstances, be expected, all became sellers at once. This, of necessity, caused the funds, to use Stock Exchange phraseology, <QUOTE>to tumble down at a fearful rate.</QUOTE> Next day, when they had fallen, perhaps, <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> per cent., he would make purchases, say to the amount of <measure value="1500000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1500000">1,500,000</num></measure>, taking care, however, to employ a number of brokers whom he was not in the habit of employing, and commissioning each to purchase to a certain extent, and giving all of them strict orders to preserve secrecy in the matter. Each of the persons so employed was, by this means, ignorant of the commission given to the others. Had it been known the purchases were made by him, there would have been as great and sudden a rise in the prices as there had been in the fall, so that he could not purchase to the intended extent on such advantageous terms. On the <num value="3">third</num> day, perhaps, the intelligence which had been expected by the jobbers to be unfavourable arrived, and, instead of being so, turned out to be highly favourable. Prices instantaneously rise again, and possibly they may get <num value="1">one</num> and a-half or even <num value="2">two</num> per cent. higher than they were when he sold out his <measure value="500000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500000">500,000</num></measure>. He now sells out, at the advanced price, the entire <measure value="1500000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1500000">1,500,000</num></measure> he had purchased at the reduced prices. The gains by such extensive transactions, when so skilfully managed, will be at once seen to be enormous. By the supposed transaction, assuming the rise to be <num value="2">two</num> per cent.; the gain would be <measure value="35000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="35000">35,000</num></measure>. But this is not the greatest gain which the late leviathian of modern capitalists made by such transactions. He, on more than <num value="1">one</num> occasion, made upwards of <measure value="100000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure> on <num value="1">one</num> account.
<p>But though no person during the last <num value="12">twelve</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> years of Rothschild's life (says Grant) was ever able, for any length of time, to compete with him in the money market, he on several occasions was, in single transactions, outwitted by the superior tactics of others. The gentleman to whom I allude was then and is now the head of <num value="1">one</num> of the largest private banking establishments in town. Abraham ontefiore, Rothschild's brother-in-law, was the principal broker to the great capitalist, and in that capacity was commissioned by the latter to negotiate with Mr.--a loan of <measure value="1500000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1500000">1,500,000</num></measure>. The security offered by Rothschild was a proportionate amount of stock in Consols, which were at that time <num value="84">84</num>. This stock was, of course, to be transferred to the name of the party advancing the money, Rothschild's object being to raise the price of Consols by carrying so large a quantity out of the market. The money was lent, and the conditions of the loan were these--that the interest on the sum advanced should be at the rate of <num value="4.50">4 1/2</num> per cent., and that if the price of Consols should chance to go down to <num value="74">74</num>, Mr. should have the right of claiming the stock at <num value="70">70</num>. The Jew, no doubt, laughed at what he conceived his own commercial dexterity in the transaction; but, ere long, he had abundant reason to laugh on the wrong side of his mouth; for, no sooner was the stock poured into the hand of the banker, than the latter sold it, along with an immensely large sum which had been previously standing in his name, amounting altogether to little short of <measure value="3000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000000">3,000,000</num></measure>. But even this was not all. Mr. also held powers of attorney from several of the leading Scotch and English banks, as well as from various private individuals, who had large property in the funds, to sell stock on their account. On these powers of attorney he acted, and at the same time advised his friends to follow his example. They at once did so, and the consequence was that the aggregate amount of stock sold by himself and his friends conjointly exceeded <measure value="10000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000000">10,000,000</num></measure>. So unusual an extent of sales, all effected in the shortest possible time, necessarily drove down the prices. In an incredibly short time they fell to <num value="74">74</num>; immediately on which, Mr.--claimed of Rothschild his stock at <num value="70">70</num>. The Jew could not refuse: it was in the bond. This climax being reached, the banker bought in again all the stock he had previously sold out, and advised his friends to re-purchase also. They did so; and the result was, that in a few weeks Consols reached <num value="84">84</num> again, their original price, and from that to <num value="86">86</num>. Rothschild's losses were very great by this transaction; but they were by no means equal to the banker's gains, which could not have been less than <measure value="300000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300000">300,000</num></measure> or  <measure value="400000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="400000">400,000</num></measure>.
<p>The following grotesque sketch of the great Rothschild is from the pen of a clever anonymous writer:-- <QUOTE>The thing before you,</QUOTE> says the author quoted, <QUOTE>stands cold, motionless, and apparently speculationless, as the pillar of salt into which the avaricious spouse of the patriarch was turned; and while you start with wonder at what it can be or mean, you pursue the association, and think upon the fire and brimstone that were rained down. It is a human being of no very Apollolike form or face: short, squat, with its shoulders drawn up to its ears, and its hands delved into its <pb id="p.485" n="485"> breeches'-pockets. The hue of its face is a mixture of brick-dust and saffron; and the texture seems that of the skin of a dead frog. There is a rigidity and tension in the features, too, which would make you fancy, if you did not see that that were not the fact, that some <num value="1">one</num> from behind was pinching it with a pair of hot tongs, and that it were either afraid or ashamed to tell. Eyes are usually denominated the windows of the soul; but here you would conclude that the windows are false ones, or that there is no soul to look out at them. There comes not <num value="1">one</num> pencil of light from the interior, neither is there <num value="1">one</num> scintillation of that which comes from without reflected in any direction. The whole puts you in mind of  <Q>a skin to let;</Q>  and you wonder why it stands upright without at least something within. By-and-by another figure comes up to it. It then steps <num value="2">two</num> paces aside, and the most inquisitive glance that ever you saw, and a glance more inquisitive than you would ever have thought of, is drawn out of the erewhile fixed and leaden eye, as if <num value="1">one</num> were drawing a sword from a scabbard. The visiting figure, which has the appearance of coming by accident, and not by design, stops but a <num value="2">second</num> or <num value="2">two</num>, in the course of which looks are exchanged which, though you cannot translate, you feel must be of most important meaning. After these, the eyes are sheathed up again, and the figure resumes its stony posture. During the morning numbers of visitors come, all of whom meet with a similar reception, and vanish in a similar manner; and last of all the figure itself vanishes, leaving you utterly at a loss as to what can be its nature and functions.</QUOTE>
<p>
Abraham Goldsmid, a liberal and honourable man, who almost rivalled Rothschild as a speculator, was ruined at last by a conspiracy. Goldsmid, in conjunction with a banking establishment, had taken a large Government loan. The leaguers contrived to produce from the collectors and receivers of the revenue so large an amount of floating securities-Exchequer Bills and India Bonds--that the omnium fell to <num value="18">18</num> discount. The result was Goldsmid's failure, and eventually his suicide. The conspirators purchased omnium when at its greatest discount, and on the following day it went up to <num value="3">3</num> premium, being then a profit of about <num value="2000000">2,000,000</num>.
<p>Goldsmid seems to have been a kind-hearted man, not so wholly absorbed in speculation and self as some of the more greedy and vulgar members of the Stock Exchange. <num value="1">One</num> day Mr. Goldsmid observed his favourite waiter at the City of London Tavern very melancholy and abstracted. On being pressed, John confessed that he had just been arrested for a debt of <measure value="55l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="55">55</num></measure>, and that he was thinking over the misery of his wife and <num value="5">five</num> children. Goldsmid instantly drew out his chequebook, and wrote a cheque for <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>, the sight of which gladdened poor John's heart and brought tears into his eyes. On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, after a carriage accident in Somersetshire, Goldsmid was carried to the house of a poor curate, and there attended for a fortnight with unremitting kindness. <num value="6">Six</num> weeks after the millionaire's departure a letter came from Goldsmid to the curate, saying that, having contracted for a large Government loan, he (the writer) had put down the curate's name for <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure> omnium. The poor curate, supposing some great outlay was expected from him for this share in the loan, wrote back to say that he had not <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure>, or even <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure>, in the world. By the next post came a letter enclosing the curate <measure value="1500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1500">1,500</num></measure>, the profit on selling out the <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure> omnium, the premium having risen since the curate's name had been put down.
<p>The vicissitudes of the Stock Exchange are like those of the gambling-table. A story is related specially illustrative of the rapid fortunes made in the old war-time, when the funds ran up and down every time Napoleon mounted his horse. Mr. F., afterwards proprietor of <num value="1">one</num> of the largest estates in the county of Middlesex, had lost a fortune on the Stock Exchange, and had, in due course, been ruthlessly gibbeted on the cruel black board. In a frenzy, as he passed London Bridge, contemplating suicide, F. threw the last shilling he had in the world over the parapet into the water. Just at that moment some <num value="1">one</num> seized him by the hand. t was a French ensign. He was full of a great battle that had been fought (Waterloo), which had just annihilated Bonaparte, and would restore the Bourbons. The French ambassador had told him only an hour before. A gleam of hope, turning the black board white, arose before the miserable man. e hurried off to a firm on the Stock Exchange, and offered most important news on condition that he should receive half of whatever profits they might realise by the operation. He told them of Waterloo. They rushed into the market, and purchased Consols to a large amount. In the meantime F., sharpened by misfortune, instantly proceeded to another firm, and made a <num value="2">second</num> offer, which was also accepted. There were <num value="2">two</num> partners, and the keenest of them whispered the other not to let F. out of his sight, while he sent brokers to purchase Consols. He might tell some <num value="1">one</num> else. Lunch was then brought in, and the key turned on them. Presently the partner returned, red and seething, from the Stock Exchange. Most <pb id="p.486" n="486"> unaccountably Consols had gone up <num value="3">3</num> per cent., and he was afraid to purchase. But F. urged the importance of the victory, and declared the funds would soon rise <num value="10">10</num> or <num value="12">12</num> per cent. The partners, persuaded, made immense purchases. The day the news of Waterloo arrived the funds rose <num value="15">15</num> per cent., the greatest rise they were ever known to experience; and F.&lsquo;s share of the profits from the <num value="2">two</num> houses in <num value="1">one</num> day exceeded <measure value="100000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure>. He returned next day to the Stock Exchange, and soon amassed a large fortune; he then wisely purchased an estate, and left the funds alone for ever.
<p>Some terrible failures occurred in the Stock Exchange during the Spanish panic of <datestruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct>. A few facts connected with this disastrous time will serve excellently to illustrate the effects of such reactions among the speculators in stocks. A decline of <num value="20">20</num> or <num value="30">30</num> per cent. in the Peninsular securities within a week or <num value="10">ten</num> days ruined many of the members. They, like card houses in a puff of wind, brought down others; so that in <num value="1">one</num> short month the greater part of the Stock Exchange had fallen into difficulties. The failure of principals out of doors, who had large differences to pay, caused much of this trouble to the brokers. Men with limited means had plunged into what they considered a certain speculation, and when pay-day arrived and the account was against them, they were obliged to confess their inability to scrape together the required funds. For instance, at the time Zumalacarregui was expected to die, a principal, a person who could not command more than &pound;I,ooo, <QUOTE>stood,</QUOTE> as the Stock Exchange phrase runs, to make a <QUOTE>pot of money</QUOTE> by the event. He speculated heavily, and had the Spanish partisan general good-naturedly died during the account, the commercial gambler would have certainly netted nearly <measure value="40000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40000">40,000</num></measure>. The general, however, obstinately delayed his death till the next week, and by that time the speculator was ruined, and all he had sold. Many of the dishonest speculators whose names figured on the black board in <datestruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></datestruct> had been <QUOTE>bulls</QUOTE> of Spanish stock. When the market gave way and prices fell, the principals attempted to put off the evil day, says a writer of the period, by <QUOTE>carrying over instead of closing their accounts.</QUOTE> The weather, however, grew only the more stormy, and at last, when payment could no longer be evraded, they coolly turned round, and with brazen faces refused, although some of them were able to adjust the balances which their luckless brokers exhibited against them. Now a broker is obliged either to make good his principal's losses from his own pocket, or be declared a defaulter and expelled the Stock Exchange. This rule often presses heavily, says an authority on the subject, on honest but not over-opulent brokers, who transact business for other persons, and become liable if they turn out either insolvent or rogues. Brokers are in most cases careful in the choice of principals if they speculate largely, and often adopt the prudent and very justifiable plan of having a certain amount of stock deposited in their <QUOTE>strong box</QUOTE> as security before any important business is undertaken. Every principal who dabbles in rickety stock without a certain reserve as a security is set down by most men as little better than a swindler.
<p>During the rumours of war which prevailed in <datestruct VALUE="1840-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>, shortly before the fall of the Thiers administration in France, the fluctuations in Consols were as much as <num value="4">4</num> per cent. The result was great ruin to speculators. The speculators for the risethe <QUOTE>bulls,</QUOTE> in fact--of <num value="400000">400,000</num> Consols sustained a loss of from <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> to <measure value="15000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="15000">15,000</num></measure>, for which more than <num value="1">one</num> broker found it necessary, for sustaining his credit, to pay.
<p>The railway mania produced many changes in the Stock Exchange. The share market, which previously had been occupied by only <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> brokers and a number of small jobbers, now became a focus of vast business. Certain brokers, it is said, made <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure> or <measure value="4000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4000">4,000</num></measure> a day by their business. <num value="1">One</num> fortunate man outside the house, who held largely of Churnett Valley scrip before the sanction of the Board of Trade was procured, sold at the best price directly the announcement was made, and netted by that <hi rend=italics>coup</hi> <measure value="27000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="27000">27,000</num></measure>. The <QUOTE>Alley men</QUOTE> wrote letters for shares, and when the allotments were obtained made some ios. on each share. Some of these <QUOTE>dabblers</QUOTE> are known to have made only <num value="50">fifty</num> farthings of <num value="50">fifty</num> shares of a railway now the <num value="1">first</num> in the kingdom. The sellers of letters used to meet in the Royal Exchange before business hours, till the beadle had at last to drive them away to make room for the merchants. There is a story told of an <QUOTE>Alley man</QUOTE> during the mania contriving to sell some rotten shares by bowing to Sir Isaac Goldsmid in the presence of his victim. Sir Isaac returned the bow, and the victim at once believed in the respectability of the gay deceiver.
<p>With the single exception of Mr. David Ricardo, the celebrated political economist, says Mr. Grant, there are few names of any literary distinction connected with the Stock Exchange. Mr. Ricardo is said to have amassed his immense fortune by a scrupulous attention to his own golden rules:--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>Never refuse an option when you can get it;
<L>Cut short your losses;
<L>Let your profits run on.</QUOTE>
By the <num value="2">second</num> rule, which, like the rest, is strictly technical, Mr, Ricardo meant that purchasers of <pb id="p.487" n="487">
<FIGURE id="Fig.487" n="2000.06.0176"><HEAD>On Change. (From An Old Print, About <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>. The Figures By Rowlandson; Architecture By Nash.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <pb id="p.488" n="488"> stock ought to re-sell immediately prices fell. By the <num value="3">third</num> he meant that when a person held stock and prices were rising, he ought not to sell until prices had reached their highest, and were beginning to fall.
<p>Gentlemen of the Stock Exchange are rough with intruders. A few years since, says a writer in the <title>City Press</title>, an excellent clergyman of my acquaintance, who had not quite mastered the Christian philosophy of turning the right cheek to those who smote the left, had business in the City, and being anxious to see his broker, strayed into the Stock Exchange, in utter ignorance of the great liberty he was committing. Instantly known as an interloper, he was surrounded and hustled by some dozen of the members. <QUOTE>What did he want?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>How dared he to intrude there?</QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>I wish to speak with a member, Mr. A--, and was not aware it was against the rules to enter the building.</QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>Then we'll make you aware for the future,</QUOTE> said a coarse but iron-fisted jobber, prepared to suit the action to the word.
<p>My friend disengaged himself as far as possible, and speaking in a calm but authoritative tone, said, <QUOTE>Sirs, I am quite sure you do not mean to insult, in my person, a minister of the Church of England; but take notice, the <num value="1">first</num> man who dares to molest me shall feel the weight of my fist, which is not a light <num value="1">one</num>. Stand by, and let me leave this inhospitable place.</QUOTE> They did stand by, and he rushed into the street without sustaining any actual violence.
<p>Practical joking, says an <hi rend=italics>habitue</hi>, relieves the excitement of this feverish gambling. The stockbrokers indulge in practical jokes which would be hardly excusable in a schoolboy. No member can wear anew hat in the arena of bulls and bears without being tormented, and his chapeau irrecoverably spoiled. A new coat cannot be worn without peril; it is almost certain to be ticketed <QUOTE>Moses and Son-dear at <measure value="18s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="18">18</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure></QUOTE> The pouncebox is a formidable missile, and frequently nearly blinds the unwary. As P. passes K.&lsquo;s desk, the latter slily extends his foot in order to trip him up; and when K. rises from his stool, he finds his coat-tail pinned to the cushion, and is likely to lose a portion of it before he is extricated. Yet these men are capable of extreme liberality. Some years ago knocking off hats and chalking <num value="1">one</num> another's backs was a favourite amusement on the Stock Exchange, as a vent for surplus excitement, and on the <datestruct value="11-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct> a cart-load of crackers was let off during the day, to the destruction of coats. The cry when a stranger is detected is <QUOTE><num value="1400">Fourteen hundred</num>,</QUOTE> and the usual test question is, <QUOTE>Will you purchase any new Navy <num value="5">Five</num> per Cents., sir?</QUOTE> The moment after a rough hand drives the novice's hat over his nose, and he is spun from <num value="1">one</num> to another; his coat-tails are often torn off, and he is then jostled into the street. There have been cases, however, where the jobbers have caught a Tartar, who, after half-strangling <num value="1">one</num> and knocking down <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> more, has fairly fought his way out, pretty well unscathed, all but his hat.
<p>The amount of business done at the Stock Exchange in a day is enormous. In a few hours property, including time bargains, to the amount of <measure value="10000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000000">10,000,000</num></measure>, has changed hands. Rothschild is known in <num value="1">one</num> day to have made purchases to the extent of <measure value="4000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4000000">4,000,000</num></measure>. This great speculator never appeared on the Stock Exchange himself, and on special occasions he always employed a new set of brokers to buy or sell. The boldest attempt ever made to overthrow the power of Rothschild in the money market was that made by a Mr. H. He was the son of a wealthy country banker, with money-stock in his own name, though it was really his father's, to the extent of <measure value="50000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50000">50,000</num></measure>. He began by buying, as openly as possible, and selling out again to a very large amount in a very short period of time. About this time Consols were as high as <num value="96">96</num> or <num value="97">97</num>, and there were signs of a coming panic. Mr. H. determined to depress the market, and carry on war against Rothschild, the leader of the <QUOTE>bulls.</QUOTE> He now struck out a bold game. He bought <measure value="200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200000">200,000</num></measure> in Consols at <num value="96">96</num>, and at once offered any part of <measure value="100000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure> at <num value="94">94</num>, and at once found purchasers. He then offered more at <num value="93">93</num>, <num value="92">92</num>; and eventually as low as <num value="90">90</num>. The next day he brought them down to <num value="74">74</num>; a run on the Bank of England began, which almost exhausted it of its specie. He then purchased to a large extent, so that when the reaction took place, the daring adventurer found his gains had exceeded &pound;.<num value="100000">100,000</num>. <num value="2">Two</num> years after he had another <QUOTE>operation,</QUOTE> but Rothschild, guessing his plan, laid a trap, into which he fell, and the day after his name was up on the black board. It was then discovered that the original <measure value="50000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50000">50,000</num></measure> money-stock had been in reality his father's. A deputation from the committee waited upon Mr. H. immediately after his failure, and quietly suggested to him an immediate sale of his furniture and the mortgage of an annuity settled on his wife. He, furious at this, rang the bell for his footman, and ordered him to show the deputation down stairs. He swore at the treatment that he had received, and said, <QUOTE>As for you, you vagabond,  <Q>My son Jack</Q>  (the nickname <pb id="p.489" n="489"> of the spokesman), who has had the audacity to make me such a proposal, if you don't hurry down stairs I'll pitch you out of window.</QUOTE>
<p>Nicknames are of frequent occurrence on the Stock Exchange.. <QUOTE>My son Jack</QUOTE> we have just mentioned. Another was known as <QUOTE>The Lady's Broker,</QUOTE> in consequence of being employed in an unfortunate speculation by a lady who had ventured without the knowledge of her husband. The husband refused to pay a farthing, and the broker, to save himself from the black board, divulged the name of the lady who was unable to meet her obligations.
<p>It is a fact not generally known, says a writer on the subject, that by <num value="1">one</num> of the regulations of the Stock Exchange, any person purchasing stock in the funds, or any of the public companies, has a right to demand of the seller as many transfers as there are even <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">thousand</num> pounds</measure> in the amount bought. Suppose, for instance, that any person were to purchase <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> stock, then, instead of having the whole made over to him by <num value="1">one</num> ticket of transfer, he has a right to demand, if he so pleases, <num value="10">ten</num> separate transfers from the party or parties of whom he purchased.
<p>The descriptions of English stock which are least generally understood are scrip and omnium. Scrip means the receipt for any instalment or ins stalments which may have been paid on any given amount which has been purchased on any Government loan. This receipt, or scrip, is marketable, the party purchasing it, either at a premium or discount, as the case chances to be, becoming of course bound to pay up the remainder of the instalments, on pain of forfeiting the money he has given for it. Omnium means the various kinds of stock in which a loan is absorbed, or, to make the thing still more intelligible, a person purchasing a certain quantity of omnium, purchases given proportions of the various descriptions of Governent securities.
<p>Bargains made <num value="1">one</num> day are always checked the following day, by the parties themselves or their clerks. This is done by calling over their respective books <num value="1">one</num> against another. In most transactions what is called an option is given, by mutual consent, to each party. This is often of great importance to the speculator. It is said that the business at the Stock Exchange is illegal, since an unrepealed Act of Parliament exists which directs all buying and selling of Bank securities shall take place in the Rotunda of the Bank.
<p>There are about <num value="1700">1,700</num> members of the Stock Exchange, who pay <num value="12">twelve</num> guineas a year each. The election of members is always by ballot, and every applicant must be recommended by <num value="3">three</num> persons, who have been members of the house for at least <num value="2">two</num> years. Each recommender must engage to pay the sum of <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> to the candidate's creditors in case any such candidate should become a defaulter, either in the Stock Exchange or the Foreign Stock market, within <num value="2">two</num> years from the date of his admission. A foreigner must have been resident in the United Kingdom for <num value="5">five</num> years previous, unless he is recommended by <num value="5">five</num> members of the Stock Exchange, each of whom becomes security for <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure>. The candidate must not enter into partnership with any of his recommenders for <num value="2">two</num> years after his admission, unless additional security be provided, and <num value="1">one</num> partner cannot recommend another. Bill and discount brokers are excluded from the Stock Exchange, says the same writer, and no applicant's wife can be engaged in any sort of business. No applicant who has been a bankrupt is eligible until <num value="2">two</num> years after he has obtained his certificate, or fulfilled the conditions of his deed of composition, or unless. he has paid <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> in the pound. No <num value="1">one</num> who has been twice bankrupt is eligible unless on the same very improbable condition.
<p>If a member makes any bargains before or after the regular business hours-<num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="4">four</num>-the bargain is not recognised by the committee. No bonds can be returned as imperfect after <num value="3">three</num> days' detention. If a member comes to private terms with his creditors, he is put upon the black board of the Exchange as a defaulter, and expelled. A further failure can be condoned for, after <num value="6">six</num> months' exile, provided the member pays at least <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3">third</num> of any loss that may have occurred on his speculations. For dishonourable conduct the committee-can also chalk up a member's name.
<p>It is said that a member of the Stock Exchange who fails and gives up his last farthing to his creditors is never thought as well of as the man who takes care to keep a reserve, in order to step back again into business. For instance, a stockbroker once lost on <num value="1">one</num> account <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>, and paid the whole without a murmur. Being, however, what is called on the Stock Exchange <QUOTE>a little man,</QUOTE> he never again recovered his credit, it being suspected that his back was irretrievably broken.
<p>But a still more striking and very interesting illustration of the estimation in which sterling integrity is held among a large proportion of the members was afforded (says Mr. Grant) in the case of the late Mr. L. A. de la Chaumette, a gentleman of foreign extraction. He had previously been in the Manchester trade, but had been unfortunate. Being a man much respected, and extensively <pb id="p.490" n="490"> known, his friends advised him to go on the Stock Exchange. He adopted their advice, and became a member. He at once established an excellent business as a broker. Not only did he make large sums, in the shape of commissions on the transactions in which he was employed by others, but <num value="1">one</num> of the largest mercantile houses in London, having the highest possible opinion of his judgment and integrity, entrusted him with the sole disposal of an immense sum of money belonging to the French refugees, which was in their hands at the time. He contrived to employ this money so advantageously, both to his constituents and himself, that he acquired a handsome fortune. Before he had been a member <num value="3">three</num> years, he invited his creditors to dine with him on a particular day at the London Tavern, but concealed from them the particular object he had in view in so doing. On entering the room, they severally found their own names on the different plates, which were reversed, and on turning them up, each found a cheque for the amount due to him, with interest. The entire sum which Mr. L. A. de la Chaumette paid away on this occasion, and in this manner, was upwards of <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure>. Next day, he went into the house as usual, and such was the feeling entertained of his conduct, that many members refused to do a bargain with him to the extent of a single <num value="1000">thousand</num>. They looked on his payment of the claims of his former creditors as a foolish affair, and fancied that he might have exhausted his resources, never dreaming that, even if he had, a man of such honourable feeling and upright principle was worthy of credit to any amount. He eventually died worth upwards of <measure value="500000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500000">500,000</num></measure>.
<p>The locality of the Stock Exchange (says the author of <title>The Great Babylon,</title> probably the Rev. Dr. Croly) is well chosen, being at a point where intelligence from the Bank of England, the Royal Exchange, and the different coffee-houses where private letters from abroad are received, may be obtained in a few minutes, and thus <QUOTE>news from all nations</QUOTE> may be very speedily manufactured with an air of authenticity. <num value="1">One</num> wide portal gapes toward the Bank, in Bartholomew Lane; and there is a sally-port into Threadneedle Street, for those who do not wish to be seen entering or emerging the other way. From the dull and dingy aspect of these approaches, which, it seems, cannot be whitened, <num value="1">one</num> could form no guess at the mighty deeds of the place; and when the hourly quotations of the price of stocks are the same, the place is silent, and only a few individuals, with faces which grin but cannot smile, are seen crawling in and out, or standing yawning in the court, with their hands in their breeches' pockets. If, however, the quotations fluctuate, and the Royal Exchange, where most of the leading men of the money market lounge, be full of bustling and rumours, and especially if characters, with eyes like basilisks, and faces lined and surfaced like an asparagus bed ere the plants come up, be ever and anon darting in at the north door of the Royal Exchange, bounding toward the chief priests of Mammon, like pith balls to the conductor of an electric machine, and, when they have <QUOTE>got their charge,</QUOTE> bounding away again, then you may be sure that the Stock Exchange is worth seeing, if it could be seen with comfort, or even with safety. At those times, however, a stranger might as well jump into a den of lions, or throw himself into the midst of a herd of famishing wolves.
<p>Among the various plans adopted for securing early intelligence for Stock Exchange purposes before the invention of the telegraph, none proved more successful than that of <QUOTE>pigeon expresses.</QUOTE> Till about the beginning of the century the ordinary courier brought the news from the Continent; and it was only the Rothschilds, and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num>-other important firms, that <QUOTE>ran</QUOTE> intelligence, in anticipation of the regular French mail. However, many years ago, the project was conceived of establishing a communication between London and Paris by means of pigeons, and in the course of <num value="2">two</num> years it was in complete operation. The training of the birds took considerable time before they could be relied on; and the relays and organisation required to perfect the scheme not only involved a vast expenditure of time, but also of money. In the <num value="1">first</num> place, to make the communication of use on both sides of the Channel, it was necessary to get <num value="2">two</num> distinct establishments for the flight of the pigeons-<num value="1">one</num> in England and another in France. It was then necessary that persons in whom reliance could be placed should be stationed in the <num value="2">two</num> capitals, to be in readiness to receive or dispatch the birds that might bring or carry the intelligence; and make it available for the parties interested. Hence it became almost evident that <num value="1">one</num> speculator, without he was a very wealthy man, could not hope to support a pigeon <QUOTE>express.</QUOTE> The consequence was, that, the project being mooted, <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of the speculators, including brokers of the house, themselves joined, and worked it for their own benefit. Through this medium several of the dealers rapidly made large sums of money; but the trade became less profitable, because the success of the <num value="1">first</num> operators induced others to follow the example of establishing this species of communication. The cost of keeping a <QUOTE>pigeon express</QUOTE> has <pb id="p.491" n="491"> been estimated at <measure value="600l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="600">600</num></measure> or <measure value="700l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="700">700</num></measure> a year; but whether this amount was magnified, with the view of deterring others from venturing into the speculation, is a question which never seems to have been properly explained. It is stated that the daily papers availed themselves of the news brought by these <QUOTE>expresses ;</QUOTE> but, in consideration of allowing the speculators to read the despatches <num value="1">first</num>, the proprietors, it is said, bore but a minimum proportion of the expense. The birds generally used were of the Antwerp breed, strong in the wing, and fully feathered. The months in which they were chiefly worked were the latter end of May, June, July, August, and the beginning of September; and, though the news might not be always of importance, a communication was generally kept up daily between London and Paris in this manner.
<p>In <datestruct value="1837--"><year reg="1837">1837</year></datestruct>-<num value="38">38</num>-<num value="39">39</num>, and <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>, a great deal of money was made by the <QUOTE>pigeon men,</QUOTE> as the speculators supposed to have possession of such intelligence were familiarly termed; and their appearance in the market was always indicative of a rise or fall, according to the tendency of their operations. Having the <num value="1">first</num> chance of buying or selling, they, of course, had the market for a while in their own hands; but as time progressed, and it was found that the papers, by their <QUOTE><num value="2">second</num> editions,</QUOTE> would communicate the news, the general brokers refused to do business till the papers reached the City. The pigeons bringing the news occasionally got shot on their passage; but, as a flock of some <num value="8">eight</num> or a dozen were usually started at a time, miscarriage was not of frequent occurrence. At the time of the death of Mr. Rothschild, <num value="1">one</num> was caught at Brighton, having been disabled by a gun-shot wound, and beneath the shoulder-feathers of the left wing was discovered a small note, with the words <QUOTE lang=fr>il est mort,</QUOTE> followed by a number of hieroglyphics. Each pigeon had a method of communication entirely their own; and the conductors, if they fancied the key to it was in another person's power, immediately varied it. A case of this description occurred worth noting. The parties interested in the scheme fancied that, however soon they received intelligence, there were others in the market who were quite equal with them. In order to arrive at the real state of affairs, the chief proprietor consented, at the advice of a friend, to pay <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> for the early perusal of a supposed rival's <QUOTE>pigeon express.</QUOTE> The <QUOTE>express</QUOTE> came to hand, he read it, and was not a little surprised to find that he was in reality paying for the perusal of his own news! The truth soon came out. Somebody had bribed the keepers of his pigeons, who were thus not only making a profit by the sale of his intelligence, but also on the speculations they in consequence conducted. The defect was soon remedied by changing the style of characters employed, and all went right as before.
<p>When a defalcation takes place in the Stock Exchange (says a City writer of <datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct>), the course pursued is as follows:--At the commencement of the <QUOTE>settling day,</QUOTE> should a broker or jobberthe <num value="1">one</num> through the default of his principals, and the other in consequence of unsuccessful speculations-find a heavy balance on the wrong side of his accounts, which he is unfortunately unable to settle, and should an attempt to get the assistance from friends prove unavailing, he must fail. Excluded from the house, the scene of his past labours and speculations, he dispatches a short but unimportant communication to the committee of the Stock Exchange. The other members of the institution being all assembled in the market, busied in arranging and settling their accounts, some of them, interested parties, become nervous and fidgety at the non-appearance of Mr.--  (the defaulter in question). The doubt is soon explained, for the porter stationed at the door suddenly gives <num value="3">three</num> loud and distinctly repeated knocks with a mallet, and announces that Mr.-.. presents his respects to the house, and regrets to state that he is unable to comply with his <QUOTE>bargains</QUOTE> --<foreign lang=fr>Anglic&eacute;</foreign>, to fulfil his engagements.
<p>Visit Bartholomew Lane at any time of the year, says a City writer, and you will be sure to find several people of shabby exterior holding converse at the entrance of Capel Court, or on the steps of the auction mart. These are the <QUOTE>Alley men.</QUOTE> You will see <num value="1">one</num>, perhaps, take from his pocket a goodsized parcel of dirty-backed letters, all arranged, and tied round with string or red tape, which he sorts with as much care and attention as if they were bank-notes, That parcel is his stock-in-trade. Perhaps those letters may contain the allotment of shares, in various companies, to an amount, if the capital subscribed was paid, of many hundreds of thousands of pounds.
<p>To describe fairly the <QUOTE>Alley man,</QUOTE> we must take him from the <num value="1">first</num> of his career. He is generally some broken-down clerk or tradesman, who, having lost every prospect of life, chooses this description of business as a <hi rend=italics>dernier ressort.</hi>
<num value="1">First</num> started in his calling, he associates with the loiterers at the Stock Exchange, where, by mixing with them, and perhaps making the acquaintance through the introduction of Sir John Barleycorn, at the tap of a tavern, he is initiated by degrees into the secrets of the business, and, perhaps, before long; becomes as great an adept in the sale or purchase of letters as the oldest man on <pb id="p.492" n="492"> the walk. When he has acquired the necessary information respecting dealing, he can commence letter-writing for shares. This is effected at the expense of a penny only for postage, pen and ink being always attainable, either in the tavern-parlour or coffee-house he frequents. When a new company comes out, and is advertised, he immediately calls for a form of application, fills it up, and dispatches it, with the moderate request to be allotted <num value="100">one hundred</num> or <num value="200">two hundred</num> shares, the amount of call or share being quite immaterial to him, as he never intends to pay upon or keep them, his only aim being to increase his available stock of letters, so that he can make a <QUOTE>deal,</QUOTE> and pocket the profit, should they have a price among the fraternity.
<p>The purchase of stock is thus described by an
<foreign lang=fr>habitu&eacute;</foreign>. <QUOTE>Suppose I went,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>to buy <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> stock in the <num value="4">Four</num> per Cents. I soon know whether the funds are better, or worse, or steady; for this is the language of the place. If they are <hi rend=italics>better,</hi>
they are on the rise from the preceding day; if
<hi rend=italics>worse</hi>, they are lower than on that day; if <hi rend=italics>steady,</hi>
they have not fluctuated at all, or very little. To render the matter as intelligible as possible, we
<FIGURE id="Fig.492" n="2000.06.0177"><HEAD>Inner Court Of The <num value="1">First</num> Royal Exchange. (see page <num value="495">495</num>).</HEAD></FIGURE>
 will suppose the price to be <num value="80">80</num> <num value="1">1</num>/<num value="8">8</num>, that is, <num value="80">80</num> <measure value="2s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> sterling for <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> stock. Upon my asking the price of the <num value="4">Four</num> per Cents., the answer probably is,  <Q>Buyers at an <num value="8">eighth</num>, and sellers at a quarter;</Q>  that is, the jobbers who either buy or sell will have the <hi rend=italics>turn</hi>, or <num value="1">1</num>/<num value="8">8</num>. Now if I leave the purchase to a broker, he probably gives, without the least hesitation, <num value="80">80</num> <num value="3">3</num>/<num value="8">8</num>, because he may have a friendly turn to make to his brother broker, for a similar act of kindness the preceding day. Well, but I do
<hi rend=italics>not</hi> leave the purchase to a broker; I manage it myself. I direct my broker to buy me <num value="100">100</num> stock at <num value="80.25">80 1/4</num>. He takes my name, profession, and place of residence; he then makes a purchase, and the seller of the stock transfers it to me, my heirs, assigns, &amp;c., and makes his signature. On the same leaf of the same book in which the
<hi rend=italics>transfer</hi> is made to me, there is a form of accept- Dance of the stock transferred to me, and to which I also put my signature; the clerk then witnesses the receipt, and the whole business is done. The seller of the stock gives me the receipt, with his signature to it, which I may keep till I receive a dividend, when it is no longer any use. The <pb id="p.493" n="493"> payment of the dividend is an acknowledgment of my right to the stock; and therefore the receipt then becomes useless.</QUOTE>
<p>The usual commission charged by a broker is <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="8">eighth</num> (<measure value="2s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure>) per cent. upon the stock sold or purchased; although of late years the charge has often been reduced <num value="50">fifty</num> per cent., especially in speculators' charges, a reduction ascribed to the influx into the market of a body of brokers who will <QUOTE>do business</QUOTE> almost for nothing, provided they can procure customers. The broker deals with the <QUOTE>jobbers,</QUOTE> a class of members, or <QUOTE>middle-men,</QUOTE> who remain stationary in the stock market, ready to act upon the orders received from brokers.
<p>There is, moreover, a fund subscribed by the members for their decayed associates, the invested capital of which, exclusive of annual contributions, amounts to upwards of <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure>.

<p>The Stock Exchange has numbered amongst its subscribers some valuable members of society, including David Ricardo and several of his descendants, Francis Baily the astronomer, and many others, down to Charles Stokes, F.R.S., not long ago deceased. Horace Smith and the author of the
<title>Last of the Plantagenets</title>--himself in his prosperity a munificent patron of literature--also for a long time enlivened its precincts. The writer of the successful play of <title>The Templar,</title> and other elegant productions, was <num value="1">one</num> of the body.
<P>The managers, in <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>, expended about <measure value="6000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6000">6,000</num></measure> in securing additional space for the Stock Exchange prior to the commencement of the works, and the contract was taken at <num value="10400">10,400</num>, some subsequent alterations respecting ventilation having caused the amount to be already exceeded.
<P>The fabric belongs to a private company, <pb id="p.494" n="494"> consisting of <num value="400">400</num> shareholders, and the shares were originally of <num value="50">50</num> each, but are now of uncertain amount, the last addition being a call of <measure value="25l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="25">25</num></measure> per share, made for the construction of the new edifice. The affairs of this company are conducted under a cumbersome and restrictive deed of settlement, by <num value="9">nine</num> <QUOTE>managers,</QUOTE> elected for life by the shareholders, no election taking place till there are <num value="4">four</num> vacancies. The members or subscribers, however, entirely conduct their own affairs by a committee of <num value="30">thirty</num> of their own body. Neither members nor committee are elected for more than <num value="1">one</num> year.
<p>The number of members at present exceeds <num value="1700">1,700</num>. The subscription is paid to the <QUOTE>managers,</QUOTE> who liquidate all expenses, and adopt alterations in the building, upon the representations of the committee of the members, or even on the application of the subscribers. Of the <num value="400">400</num> shares mentioned above, the whole, with scarcely an exception, are held by the members themselves. No <num value="1">one</num> person is allowed to hold, directly or indirectly, more than <num value="4">four</num>.
<p>The present building stands in the centre of the block of buildings fronting Bartholomew Lane, Threadneedle Street, Old Broad Street, and Throgmorton Street. The principal entrance is from Bartholomew Lane through Capel Court. There are also <num value="3">three</num> entrances from Throgmorton Street, and <num value="1">one</num> from Threadneedle Street.

There are, however, seldom more than half that number present. The site is very irregular, and has enforced some peculiar construction in covering it, into which iron enters largely.

<P>In the year <datestruct value="1563"><year reg="1563">1563</year></datestruct>
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.494.2">Sir Thomas Gresham</lemma>, a munificent merchant of Lombard Street, who traded largely with Antwerp, carrying out a scheme of his father, offered the City to erect a Bourse at his own expense, if they would provide a suitable plot of ground; the great merchant's local pride having been hurt at seeing Antwerp <hi rend=italics>provided</hi> with a stately Exchange, and London without <num value="1">one</num>.
<P>A short sketch of the Gresham family is here necessary, to enable us to understand the antecedents of this great benefactor of London. The family derived its name from Gresham, a little village in Norfolk; and <num value="1">one</num> of the early Greshams appears to have been clerk to Sir William Paston, a judge. The family afterwards removed to Holt, near the sea. John Gresham married an heiress, by whom he had <num value="4">four</num> sons, William, Thomas, Richard, and John. Thomas became Chancellor of Lichfield, the other <num value="3">three</num> brothers turned merchants, and <num value="2">two</num> of them were knighted by Henry VIII. Sir Richard, the father of Sir Thomas Gresham, was an eminent London merchant, elected Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1537--"><year reg="1537">1537</year></datestruct>. Being a trusty foreign agent of Henry VII., and a friend of Cromwell and Wolsey, he received from the king <num value="5">five</num> several gifts of church lands. Sir Richard died at Bethnal Green, <datestruct value="1548--"><year reg="1548">1548</year></datestruct>-<num value="9">9</num>. He was buried in the church of St. Lawrence Jewry.

 <hi rend=italics>to Gonville College</hi>, Cambridge, <hi rend=italics>and</hi> apprenticed probably before that to his Uncle Sir John, a Levant merchant, <hi rend=italics>for <num value="8">eight</num></hi> years. In <datestruct value="1543--"><year reg="1543">1543</year></datestruct> we find the young merchant applying to Margaret, Regent of the Low Countries, for leave to export gunpowder to England, for King Henry, who was then preparing for his attack on France, and the siege of Boulogne. In <datestruct value="1554--"><year reg="1554">1554</year></datestruct> Gresham married the daughter of a Suffolk gentleman, and the widow of a London mercer. By her he had several children, none of whom, however, reached maturity.
<p>It was in <datestruct value="1551--"><year reg="1551">1551</year></datestruct> or <datestruct value="1552--"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct> that Gresham's real fortune commenced, by his appointment as king's merchant factor, or agent, at Antwerp, to raise private loans from German and Low Country merchants to meet the royal necessities, and to keep the privy council informed in the local news. The wise factor borrowed in his own name, and soon raised the exchange from <measure value="16s." type=currency><num value="16">16</num>s.</measure> Flemish for the pound sterling to <measure value="22s." type=currency><num value="22">22</num>s.</measure>, at which rate he discharged all the king's debts, and made money plentiful. He says, in a letter to the Duke of Northumberland, that
<FIGURE id="fig.494facing" n="2000.06.0179"><HEAD>The Royal Exchange & Bank of England</HEAD></FIGURE>
 <pb id="p.495" n="495"> he hoped in <num value="1">one</num> year to save England <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure>. It being forbidden to export further from Antwerp, Gresham had to resort to various stratagems, and in <datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct> (Queen Mary) we find him writing to the Privy Council, proposing to send <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure> (in heavy Spanish rials), in bags of pepper, <num value="4">four</num> at a time, and the English ambassador at Brussels was to bring over with him <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure> or <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure>, but he afterwards changed his mind, and sent the money packed up in bales with suits of armour and <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure> in each, rewarding the searcher at Gravelines with new year presents of black velvet and black cloth. About the time of the Queen's marriage to Philip Gresham went to Spain, to start from Puerto Real <num value="50">fifty</num> cases, each containing <num value="22000">22,000</num> Spanish ducats. All the time Gresham resided at Antwerp, carrying out these sagacious and important negociations, he was rewarded with the paltry remuneration of <measure value="1l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1">1</num></measure> a day, of which we often find him seriously complaining. It was in Antwerp, that vast centre of commerce, that Gresham'must have gained that great knowledge of business by which he afterwards enriched himself. Antwerp exported to England at this time, says Mr. Burgon, in his excellent life of Gresham, almost every article of luxury required by English people.
<p>Later in Queen Mary's reign Gresham was frequently displaced by rivals. He made trips to England, sharing largely in the dealings of the Mercers' Company, of which he was a member, and shipping vast quantities of cloth to sell to the Italian merchants at Antwerp, in exchange for silks. A few years later the Mercers are described as sending forth, twice a year, a fleet of <num value="50">50</num> or <num value="60">60</num> ships, laden with cloth, for the Low Countries. Gresham is mentioned, in <datestruct value="1555--"><year reg="1555">1555</year></datestruct> as presenting Queen Mary, as a new year's gift, with <QUOTE>a bolt of fine Holland,</QUOTE> receiving in return a gilt jug, weighing <num value="16.50">16 1/2</num> ounces. That the Queen considered Gresham a faithful and useful servant there can be no doubt, for she gave him, at different times, a priory, a rectory, and several manors and advowsons.
<p>Gresham, like a prudent courtier, seems to have been <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> persons of celebrity who visited Queen Elizabeth on her accession. She gave the wise merchant her hand to kiss, and told him that she would always keep <num value="1">one</num> ear ready to hear him; <QUOTE>which,</QUOTE> says Gresham, <QUOTE>made me a young man again, and caused me to enter on my present charge with heart and courage.</QUOTE>
<p>The young Queen also promised him on her faith that if he served her as well as he had done her brother Edward, and Queen Mary, her sister, she would give him as much land as ever they both had. This gracious promise Gresham reminded the Queen of years after, when he had to complain to his friend Cecil that the Marquis of Winchester had tried to injure him with the Queen.
<p>Gresham soon resumed his visits to Flanders, to procure money, and send over powder, armour, and weapons. He was present at the funeral of Charles V., seems to have foreseen the coming troubles in the Low Countries, and commented on the rash courage of Count Egmont.
<p>The death of Gresham's only son Richard, in the year <datestruct value="1564"><year reg="1564">1564</year></datestruct>, was the cause, Mr. Burgon thinks, of Gresham's determining to devote his money to the benefit of his fellow-citizens. Lombard Street had long become too small for the business of London. Men of business were exposed there to all weathers, and had to crowd into small shops, or jostle under the pent-houses. As early as <datestruct value="1534"><year reg="1534">1534</year></datestruct> or <datestruct value="1535--"><year reg="1535">1535</year></datestruct> the citizens had deliberated in common council on the necessity of a new place of resort, and Leadenhall Street had been proposed. In the year <datestruct value="1565"><year reg="1565">1565</year></datestruct> certain houses in Cornhill, in the ward of Broad Street, and <num value="3">three</num> alleys-Swan Alley, Cornhill; New Alley, Cornhill, near St. Bartholomew's Lane; and St. Christopher's Alley, comprising in all fourscore householders--were purchased for <measure value="3737l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3737">3,737</num></measure> <measure value="6s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure>, and the materials sold for <measure value="478l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="478">478</num></measure>. The amount was subscribed for in small sums by about <num value="750">750</num> citizens, the Ironmongers' Company giving <measure value="75l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="75">75</num></measure>. The <num value="1">first</num> brick was laid by Sir Thomas, <datestruct VALUE="1566-06-7"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=7>7</day>, <year reg=1566>1566</year></datestruct>. A Flemish architect superintended the sawing of the timber, at Gresham's estate at Ringshall, near Ipswich, and on Battisford Tye (common) traces of the old sawpits can still be seen. The slates were bought at Dort, the wainscoting and glass at Amsterdam, and other materials in Flanders. The building, pushed on too fast for final solidity, was slated in by <datestruct VALUE="1567-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1567">1567</year></datestruct>, and shortly after finished. The Bourse, when erected, was thought to resemble that of Antwerp, but there is also reason to believe that Gresham's architect closely followed the Bourse of Venice.
<p>
The new Bourse, Flemish in character, was a long <num value="4">four</num>-storeyed building, with a high double balcony. A bell-tower, crowned by a huge grasshopper, stood on <num value="1">one</num> side of the chief entrance. The bell in this tower summoned merchants to the spot at <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock at noon and <num value="6">six</num> o'clock in the evening. A lofty Corinthian column, crested with a grasshopper, apparently stood outside the north entrance, overlooking the quadrangle. The brick building was afterwards stuccoed over, to imitate stone. Each corner of the building, and the peak of every dormer window, was crowned by a grasshopper. Within
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.495.1">Gresham's Bourse</lemma> were piazzas for wet weather, and the covered walks <pb id="p.496" n="496"> were adorned with statues of English kings. A statue of Gresham stood near the north end of the western piazza. At the Great Fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct> this statue alone remained there uninjured, as Pepys and Evelyn particularly record. The piazzas were supported by marble pillars, and above were <num value="100">100</num> small shops. The vaults dug below, for merchandise, proved dark and damp, and were comparatively valueless. Hentzner, a German traveller who visited England in the year <datestruct value="1598"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>, particularly mentions the stateliness of the building, the assemblage of different nations, and the quantities of merchandise.
<p>Many of the shops in the Bourse remained unlet till Queen Elizabeth's visit, in <datestruct value="1570--"><year reg="1570">1570</year></datestruct>, which gave them a lustre that tended to make the new building fashionable. Gresham, anxious to have the Bourse worthy of such a visitor, went round twice in <num value="1">one</num> day to all the shopkeepers in <QUOTE>the upper pawn,</QUOTE> and offered them all the shops they would furnish and light up with wax rent free for a whole year. The result of this liberality was that in <num value="2">two</num> years Gresham was able to raise the rent from <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">40</num>s.</measure> a year to <measure value="4bmark" type=currency><num value="4">four</num> marks</measure>, and a short time after to <measure value="4l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4">4</num></measure> <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> The milliners' shops at the Bourse, in Gresham's time, sold mousetraps, birdcages, shoeing-horns, lanthorns, and Jews' trumps. There were also sellers of armour, apothecaries, booksellers, goldsmiths, and glass-sellers; but the shops soon grew richer and more fashionable, so that in <datestruct value="1631--"><year reg="1631">1631</year></datestruct> the editor of Stow says, <QUOTE>Unto which place,

<p>The new Exchange, like the nave of St. Paul's, soon became a resort for idlers. In the Inquest Book of Cornhill Ward, <datestruct value="1574--"><year reg="1574">1574</year></datestruct> (says Mr. Burgon), there is a presentment against the Exchange, because on Sundays and holidays great numbers of boys, children, and <QUOTE>young rogues,</QUOTE> meet there, and shout and holloa, so that honest citizens cannot quietly walk there for their recreation, and the parishioners of St. Bartholomew could not hear the sermon.

It was also seriously complained of that the bear-wards, Shakespeare's noisy neighbours in Southwark, before special bull or bear baitings, used to parade before the Exchange, generally in business hours, and there make proclamation of their entertainments, which caused tumult, and drew together mobs. It was usual on these occasions to have a monkey riding on the bear's back, and several discordant minstrels fiddling, to give additional publicity to the coming festival

<p>Gresham seems to have died before the Exchange was thoroughly furnished, for in <datestruct value="1610--"><year reg="1610">1610</year></datestruct> (James I.)

<p>In Gresham's Exchange great precautions were taken against fire. Feather-makers and others were forbidden to keep pans of fire in their shops. Some care was also taken to maintain honesty among the shopkeepers, for they were forbidden to use blinds to their windows, which might obscure the shops, or throw false lights on the articles vended.
<p>On the sudden death of Sir Thomas Gresham, in <datestruct value="1579--"><year reg="1579">1579</year></datestruct>, it was found that he had left, in accord- Dance with his promise, the Royal Exchange jointly to the City of London and the Mercers' Company after the decease of his wife. Lady Gresham appears not to have been as generous, singleminded, and large-hearted as her husband. She contested the will, and was always repining at the thought of the property passing away from her at death. She received <measure value="751l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="751">751</num></measure> <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">7</num>s.</measure> per annum from the rent of the Exchange, but tried hard to be allowed to grant leases for <num value="21">twenty-one</num> years, or <num value="3">three</num> lives, keeping the fines to herself; and this was pronounced by the Council as utterly against both her husband's will and the <num value="23">23rd</num> Elizabeth, to which she had been privy. She complained querulously that the City did not act well. The City then began to complain with more justice of Lady Gresham's parsimony. The Bourse, badly and hastily built, began to fall out of repair, gratings by the south door gave way in <datestruct value="1582--"><year reg="1582">1582</year></datestruct>, and the clock was always out of order.

<p> <QUOTE>The Eye of London,</QUOTE> as Stow affectionately calls the <num value="1">first</num> Royal Exchange, rapidly became a vast bazaar, where fashionable ladies went to shop, and sometimes to meet their lovers.
<p>Contemporary allusions to Gresham's Exchange are innumerable in old writers. Donald Lupton, in a little work called <QUOTE>London and the Country Carbonadoed and Quartered into Severall Characters,</QUOTE> published in <datestruct value="1632--"><year reg="1632">1632</year></datestruct>, says of the Exchange:-- <QUOTE>Here are usually more coaches attendant than at church doors.

<p>Samuel Rolle, a clergyman who wrote on the Great Fire, has left the following account of this edifice as it appeared in his day:-- <QUOTE>How full of riches,</QUOTE> he exclaims, <QUOTE>was that Royal Exchange Rich men in the midst of it, rich goods both above and beneath! There men walked upon the top of a wealthy mine, considering what Eastern treasures, costly spices, and such-like things were laid up in the bowels (I mean the cellars) of that place. As for the upper part of it, was it not the great storehouse whence the nobility and gentry of England were furnished with most of those costly things wherewith they did adorn either their closets or themselves? Here, if anywhere, might a man have seen the glory of the world in a moment. What artificial thing could entertain the senses, the fantasies of men, that was not there to be had? Such was the delight that many gallants took in that magazine of all curious varieties, that they could almost have dwelt there (going from shop to shop like bee from flower to flower), if they had but had a fountain of money that could not have been drawn dry. I doubt not but a Mohamedan (who never expects other than sensual delights) would gladly have availed himself of that place, and the treasures of it, for his heaven, and have thought there was none like it.</QUOTE>
<p>In <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>, during the Plague, great fires were made at the north and south entrances of the Exchange, to purify the air. The stoppage of public business was so complete that grass grew within the area of the Royal Exchange.

<p>At the Great Fire the King and the Duke of York, afterwards James II., attended to give directions for arresting the calamity.

<p>In Wren's great scheme for rebuilding London, he proposed to make the Royal Exchange the centre nave of London, from whence the great <num value="60">sixty</num>-feet wide streets should radiate like spokes in a huge wheel. The Exchange was to stand free, in the middle of a great piazza, and was to have double porticoes, as the Forum at Rome had. Evelyn wished the new building to be at Queenhithe, to be nearer the water-side, but eventually both his and Wren's plan fell through, and Mr. Jerman, <num value="1">one</num> of the City surveyors, undertook the design for the new Bourse.
<p>For the east end of the new building the City required to purchase <num value="700">700</num> or <num value="800">800</num> fresh superficial feet of ground from a Mr. Sweeting, and <num value="1400">1,400</num> more for a passage. It was afterwards found that the City only required <num value="627">627</num> feet, and the improvement of the property would benefit Mr. Sweeting, who, however, resolutely demanded <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure>. The refractory, greedy Sweeting declared that his tenants paid him <measure value="246l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="246">246</num></measure> a year, and in fines <measure value="620l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="620">620</num></measure>; and that if the new street cut near St. Benet Fink Church, another <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> would not satisfy him for his damage.

<p>Jerman's design for the new building being completed, and the royal approbation of it obtained, together with permission to extend the south-west angle of the new Exchange into the street, the building (of which the need was severely felt) was immediately proceeded with; and the foundation was laid on the <datestruct VALUE="1667-05-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.501.2">The ground-plan of Jerman's Exchange</lemma> we read in Britton and Pugin's <title>Public Buildings,</title> presented nearly a regular quadrangle, including a spacious open court with porticoes round it, and also on the north and south sides of the building. The front towards Cornhill was <num value="210">210</num> feet in extent. The central part was composed of a lofty archway, opening from the middle intercolumniation of <num value="4">four</num> Corinthian <num value="3">three</num>-quarter columns, supporting a bold entablature, over the centre of which were the royal arms, and on the east side a balustrade,  &amp;c., surmounted by statues emblematical of the <num value="4">four</num> quarters of the globe. Within the lateral intercolumniations, over the lesser entrance to the arcade, were niches, containing the statues of Charles I. and II., in Roman habits, by Bushnell. The tower, which rose from the centre of the portico, consisted of <num value="3">three</num> storeys. In front of the lower storey was a niche, containing a statue of Sir Thomas Gresham; and over the cornice, facing each of the cardinal points, a bust of Queen Elizabeth; at the angles were colossal griffins, bearing shields of the City arms. Within the <num value="2">second</num> storey, which was of an octagonal form with trusses at the angles, was an excellent clock with <num value="4">four</num> dials; there were also <num value="4">four</num> wind-dials. The upper storey (which contained the bell) was circular, with <num value="8">eight</num> Corinthian columns supporting an entablature, surmounted by a dome, on which was a lofty vane of gilt brass, shaped like a grasshopper, the crest of the Gresham family. The attic over the columns, in a line with the basement of the tower, was sculptured with <num value="2">two</num> alto-relievos, in panels, <num value="1">one</num> representing Queen Elizabeth, with attendant figures and heralds, proclaiming the original building, and the other Britannia, seated amidst the emblems of commerce, accompanied by the polite arts, manufactures, and agriculture. <pb id="p.502" n="502"> The height from the basement line to the top of the dome was <num value="128">128</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches.
<p>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.502.1">Within the quadrangle</lemma> there was a spacious area, measuring <num value="144">144</num> feet by <num value="117">117</num> feet, surrounded by a wide arcade, which, as well as the area itself, was, for the general accommodation, arranged into several distinct parts, called <QUOTE>walks,</QUOTE> where foreign and domestic merchants, and other persons engaged in commercial pursuits, daily met. The area was paved with real Turkey stones, of a small size, the gift, as tradition reports, of a merchant who traded to that country.
<p>In the centre, on a pedestal, surrounded by an iron railing, was a statue of Charles II., in a Roman habit, by Spiller.. At the intersections of the groining was a large ornamented shield, displaying either the City arms, the arms of the Mercers' Company, viz., a maiden's head, crowned, with dishevelled hair; or those of Gresham, viz., a chrevron, ermine, between <num value="3">three</num> mullets.
<p>On the centre of each cross-rib, also in alternate succession, was a maiden's head, a grasshopper, and a dragon. The piazza was formed by a series of semi-circular arches, springing from columns. In the spandrils were tablets surrounded by festoons, scrolls, and other enrichments. In the wall of the back of the arcade were <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> niches, only <num value="2">two</num> of which were occupied by statues, viz., that toward the north-west, in which was
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.502.2">Sir Thomas Gresham, by Cibber</lemma>; and that toward the south-west, in wch was Sir John Barnard, whose figure was placed here, whilst he was yet living, at the expense of his fellow-citizens, <QUOTE>in testimony of his merits as a merchant, a magistrate, and a faithful representative of the City in Parliament.</QUOTE>
<p>Over the arches of the portico of the piazza were <num value="25">twenty-five</num> large niches with enrichments, in which were the statues of our sovereigns. Many of these statues were formerly gilt, but the whole were latterly of a plain stone colour. Walpole says that the major part were sculptured by Cibber.
<p>We append a few allusions to
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.502.3">the <num value="2">second</num> &lsquo;Change</lemma>

<p> <QUOTE>There is no place in the town,</QUOTE> says that rambling philosopher, Addison, <QUOTE>which I so much love to frequent as the Royal Exchange. It gives me a secret satisfaction, and in some measure gratifies my vanity, as I am an Englishman, to see so rich an assembly of countrymen and foreigners consulting together upon the private business of mankind, and making this metropolis a kind of emporium for the whole earth. I must confess I look upon High &lsquo;Change to be a great council in which all considerable nations have their representatives. Factors in the trading world are what ambassadors are in the politic world; they negociate affairs, conclude treaties, and maintain a good correspondence between those wealthy societies of men that are divided from <num value="1">one</num> another by seas and oceans, or live on the different extremities of a continent. I have often been pleased to hear disputes adjusted between an inhabitant of Japan and an alderman of London; or to see a subject of the great Mogul entering into a league with <num value="1">one</num> of the Czar of Muscovy. I am infinitely delighted in mixing with these several ministers of commerce, as they are distinguished by their different walks and different languages. Sometimes I am jostled among a body of Armenians; sometimes I am lost in a crowd of Jews; and sometimes make <num value="1">one</num> in a group of Dutchmen. I am a Dane, Swede, or Frenchman at different times; or rather, fancy myself like the old philosopher, who, upon being asked what countryman he was, replied that he was a citizen of the world.</QUOTE>
<p> <QUOTE>When I have been upon the &lsquo;Change</QUOTE> (such are the concluding words of the paper), <QUOTE>I have often fancied <num value="1">one</num> of our old kings standing in person where he is represented in effigy, and looking down upon the wealthy concourse of people with which that place is every day filled. In this case, how would he be surprised to hear all the languages of Europe spoken in this little spot of his former dominions, and to see so many private men, who in his time would have been the vassals of some powerful baron, negotiating, like princes, for greater sums of money than were formerly to be met with in the royal treasury! Trade, without enlarging the British territories, has given us a kind of additional empire. It has multiplied the number of the rich, made our landed estates infinitely more valuable than they were formerly, and added to them an accession of other estates as valuable as the land themselves.</QUOTE> (<title>Spectator</title>, No. <num value="69">69</num>.) <pb id="p.503" n="503">
<p>It appears, from <num value="1">one</num> of Steele's contributions to
<hi rend=italics>the Spectator</hi>, that so late as the year <datestruct value="1712"><year reg="1712">1712</year></datestruct> the shops continued to present undiminished attraction.

<p> <QUOTE>On evening &lsquo;Change,</QUOTE> says Steele, <QUOTE>the mumpers, the halt, the blind, and the lame; your vendors of trash, apples, plums; your ragamuffins, rake-shames, and wenches--have jostled the greater number of honourable merchants, substantial tradesmen, and knowing masters of ships, out of that place. So that, what with the din of squallings, oaths, and cries of beggars, men of the greatest consequence in our City absent themselves from the Royal Exchange.</QUOTE> The cost of the <num value="2">second</num> Exchange to the City and Mercers' Company is estimated by Strype at <measure value="80000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="80000">80,000</num></measure>, but Mr. Burgon calculates it at only <measure value="69979l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="69979">69,979</num></measure> <measure value="11s." type=currency><num value="11">11</num>s.</measure> The shops in the Exchange, leading to a loss, were forsaken about <datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>, and eventually done away with some time after by the unwise Act of <datestruct value="1768--"><year reg="1768">1768</year></datestruct>, which enabled the City authorities to pull down Gresham College. From time to time frequent repairs were made in Jerman's building. Those effected between the years <datestruct value="1819--"><year reg=1819>1819</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg=1824>1824</year></datestruct> cost <num value="34390">34,390</num>. This sum included the cost of a handsome gate tower and cupola, erected in <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>, from the design of George Smith, Esq., surveyor to the Mercers' Company, in lieu of Jerman's dilapidated wooden tower.
<p>The clock of the <num value="2">second</num> Exchange, set up by Edward Stanton, under the direction of Dr. Hooke, had chimes with <num value="4">four</num> bells, playing <num value="6">six</num>, and latterly <num value="7">seven</num> tunes. The sound and tunable bells were bought for <measure value="6l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6">6</num></measure> <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>s.</measure> per cwt. The balconies from the inner pawn into the quadrangle cost about <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="300">300</num></measure>. The signs over the shops were not hung, but were over the doors.
<p>Caius Gabriel Cibber, the celebrated Danish sculptor, was appointed carver of the royal statues of the piazza, but Gibbons executed the statue of Charles II. for the quadrangle. Bushnell, the mad sculptor of the fantastic statues on Temple Bar, carved statues for the Cornhill front, as we have before mentioned. The statue of Gresham in the arcade was by Cibber; George III., in the piazza, was sculptured by Wilton; George I. and II. were by Rysbrach.
<p>The old clock had <num value="4">four</num> dials, and chimed <num value="4">four</num> times daily.

The east side of Sweeting's Alley was destroyed, and all the royal statues but that of Charles II. perished. <num value="1">One</num> of Lloyd's safes, containing bank-notes for <measure value="2500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2500">2,500</num></measure>, was discovered after the fire, with the notes reduced to a cinder, but the numbers still traceable. A bag of <num value="20">twenty</num> sovereigns, thrown from a window, burst, and some of the mob benefited by the gold. The statue
<FIGURE id="Fig.504" n="2000.06.0184"><HEAD>The Present Royal Exchange.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 of Gresham was entirely destroyed. In the ruins of the Lord Mayor's Court Office the great City Seal, and <num value="2">two</num> bags, each containing <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure> in gold, were found uninjured. The flames were clearly seen at Windsor (<num value="24">twenty-four</num> miles from London), and at Roydon Mount, near Epping (eighteen miles). Troops from the Tower kept Cornhill clear, and assisted the sufferers to remove their property. If the wind had been from the south, the Bank and St. Bartholomew's Church would also have perished.
<p>An Act of Parliament was passed in <datestruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct>, giving power to purchase and remove all the buildings <pb id="p.505" n="505"> (called Bank Buildings) west of the Exchange, and also the old buildings to the eastward, nearly as far as Finch Lane. The Treasury at <num value="1">first</num> claimed the direction of the whole building, but eventually gave way, retaining only a veto on the design. The cost of the building was, from the <num value="1">first</num>, limited to <measure value="150000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="150000">150,000</num></measure>, to be raised on the credit of the London Bridge Fund. <num value="30">Thirty</num> designs were sent in by the rival architects, and exhibited in Mercers' Hall, but none could be decided upon; and so the judges themselves had to compete. Eventually the competition lay between Mr. Tite and Mr. Cockerell, and the former was appointed by the Committee. Mr. Tite was a classical man, and the result was a
<hi rend=italics>quasi</hi>-Greek, Roman, and Composite building. Mr. Tite at once resolved to design the new building with simple and unbroken lines, like the Paris Bourse, and, as much as possible, to take the Pantheon at Rome as his guide. The portico was to be at the west end, the tower at the east. The <num value="1">first</num> Exchange had been built on piles; the foundations of the <num value="3">third</num> cost <measure value="8124l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="8124">8,124</num></measure>. In excavating for it, the workmen came on what had evidently been the very centre of Roman London. In a gravelpit, which afterwards seemed to have been a pond

 (perhaps the fountain of a grand Roman court-yard) were found heaps of rubbish, coins of copper, yellow brass, silver, and silver-plated brass, of Augustus, Tiberius, Claudius, Nero, Vespasian, Domitian, &amp;c., Henry IV. of England, Elizabeth, &amp;c., and stores of Flemish, German, Prussian, Danish, and Dutch money. They also discovered fragments of Roman stucco, painted shards of delicate Samian ware, an amphora and terra-cotta lamps (<num value="17">seventeen</num> feet below the surface), glass, bricks and tiles, jars, urns, vases, and potters' stamps. In the Corporation Museum at the Guildhall, where Mr. Tite deposited these interesting relics, are also fine wood tablets, and styles (for writing on wax) of iron, brass, bone, and wood. There are also in the same collection, from the same source, artificers' tools and leatherwork, soldiers' sandals and shoes, and a series of horns, shells, bones, and vegetable remains. Tesselated pavements have been found in Threadneedle Street, and other spots near the Exchange.
<p>The cost of enlarging the site of the Exchange, including improvements, and the widening of Cornhill, Freeman's Court, and Broad Street, the removal of the French Protestant Church, and demolition of St. Benet Fink, Bank Buildings, and Sweeting's <pb id="p.506" n="506"> Alley, was, according to the City Chamberlain's return of <datestruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></datestruct>, <measure value="223578l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="223578">223,578</num></measure> <measure value="1s. 10d." type=Currency><num value="1">1</num>s. <num value="10">10</num>d.</measure> The cost of the building was <measure value="150000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="150000">150,000</num></measure>.
<p>The portico, <num value="1">one</num> of the finest of its kind, is ninetysix feet wide, and <num value="74">seventy-four</num> feet high. That of St. Martin's Church is only <num value="64">sixty-four</num> wide, and the Post Office <num value="76">seventy-six</num>. The whole building was rapidly completed.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.506.2">The present Royal Exchange</lemma> was opened by Queen Victoria on <datestruct VALUE="1844-10-28"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=28>28</day>, <year reg=1844>1844</year></datestruct>. The procession walked round the ambulatory, the Queen especially admiring Lang's (of Munich) encaustic paintings, and proceeded to Lloyd's Reading-room, which was fitted up as a throne-room. Prince Albert, the Duke of Wellington, Sir Robert Peel, Lord John Russell, Sir Robert Sale, and other celebrities, were present. There the City address was read. After a sumptuous <foreign lang=fr>dejeuner</foreign> in the Underwriters' room, the Queen went to the quadrangle, and there repeated the formula, <QUOTE>It is my royal will and pleasure that this building be hereafter called  <Q>The Royal Exchange.</Q> </QUOTE> The mayor, the Right Hon. William Magnay, was afterwards made a baronet, in commemoration of the day.
<p>A curious fact connected with the <num value="2">second</num> Exchange should not be omitted. On the <datestruct VALUE="1787-09-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1787">1787</year></datestruct>, a deserted child was found on the stone steps of the Royal Exchange that led from Cornhill to Lloyd's Coffee-house. The then churchwarden, Mr. Samuel Birch, the well-known confectioner, had the child taken care of and respectably brought up. He was named Gresham, and christened Michael, after the patron saint of the parish in which he was found. The lad grew up shrewd and industrious, eventually became rich, and established the celebrated Gresham Hotel in Sackville Street, Dublin. About <datestruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></datestruct> he sold the hotel for <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure>, and retired to his estate, Raheny ark, near Dublin. He was a most liberal and benevolent man, and took an especial interest in the Irish orphan societies.
<p>The tower at the east end of the Exchange is <num value="177">177</num> feet to the top of the vane. The inner area of the building is <num value="170">170</num> feet by <num value="112">112</num>, of which <num value="111">111</num> feet by <num value="53">53</num> are open to the sky.
<p>The south front is <num value="1">one</num> unbroken line of pilasters, with rusticated arches on the ground floor for shops and entrances, the <num value="3">three</num> middle spaces being <pb id="p.507" n="507">
<NOTE resp=B>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.507.1">Fountain in front of Royal Exchange</lemma></NOTE>
 simple recesses. Over these are richly-decorated windows, and above the cornice there are a balustrade and attic. On the north side the centre projects, and the pilasters are fewer. The arches on the ground floor are rusticated, and there are <num value="2">two</num> niches. In <num value="1">one</num> of them stands a statue of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.507.2">Sir Hugh Myddelton</lemma>, who brought the New River to London in <datestruct value="1614--"><year reg="1614">1614</year></datestruct>; and another of Sir Richard Whittington, by Carew. Whittington was, it must be remembered, a Mercer, and the Exchange is specially connected with the Mercers' Company.
<p>On the east front of the tower is a niche where a statue of Gresham, by Behnes, keeps watch and ward. The vane is Gresham's former grasshopper, saved from the fire. It is <num value="11">eleven</num> feet long. The various parts of the Exchange are divided by party walls and brick arches of such great strength as to be almost fire-proof--a compartment system which confines any fire that should break out into a small and restricted area.
<p>West of the Exchange stands Chantrey's bronze equestrian
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.507.3">statue of the Duke of Wellington</lemma>. It was Chantrey's last work; and he died before it was completed. The sculptor received <measure value="9000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="9000">9,000</num></measure> for this figure; and the French cannon from which it was cast, and valued at <measure value="1500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1500">1,500</num></measure>, were given by Government for the purpose. The inauguration took place on the anniversary of the battle of Waterloo, <datestruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct>, the King of Saxony being present.
<p>On the frieze of the portico is inscribed, <QUOTE lang=la>ANNO III. ELIZABETHAE R. CONDITVM; ANNO VIII. ICTORIA R. RESTAVRATVM.</QUOTE> Over the central doorway are the royal arms, by Carew. The keystone has the merchant's mark of Gresham, and the key-stones of the side arches the arms of the merchant adventurers of his day, and the staple of Calais. North and south of the portico, and in the attic, are the City sword and mace, with the date of Queen Elizabeth's reign and <datestruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct>, and in the lower panels mantles bearing the initials of Queen Elizabeth and Queen Victoria respectively. The imperial crown is <num value="12">twelve</num> inches in relief, and <num value="7">seven</num> feet high. The tympanum of the pediment of the portico is filled with sculpture, by Richard Westmacott, R.A., consisting of <num value="17">seventeen</num> figures carved in limestone, nearly all entire and detached. The centre figure, <num value="10">ten</num> feet high, is Commerce, with her mural crown, upon <num value="2">two</num> dolphins and a shell. She holds the charter of the Exchange. On her right is a group of <num value="3">three</num> British merchantsas Lord Mayor, Alderman, and Common Councilman--a Hindoo, a Mohammedan, a Greek bearing a jar, and a Turkish merchant. On the left are <num value="2">two</num> British merchants and a Persian, a Chinese, a Levant sailor, a negro, a British sailor, and a supercargo. The opposite angles are filled with anchors, jars, packages, &amp;c. Upon the pedestal of Commerce is this inscription, selected by Prince Albert: <QUOTE>THE EARTH IS THE LORD&lsquo;S, AND THE FULNESS THEREOF.</QUOTE> --Psalm xxiv. <num value="1">1</num>. The ascent to the portico is by <num value="13">thirteen</num> granite steps. It was discussed at the time whether a figure of Gresham himself should not have been substituted for that of Commerce; but perhaps the abstract figure is more suitable for a composition which is, after all, essentially allegorical.
<p>The clock, constructed by Dent, with the assistance of the Astronomer Royal, is true to a <num value="2">second</num> of time, and has a compensation pendulum. he chimes consist of a set of <num value="15">fifteen</num> bells, by ears, and cost <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure>, the largest being also the hour-bell of the clock. In the chime-work, by Dent, there are <num value="2">two</num> hammers to several of the bells, so as to play rapid passages; and <num value="3">three</num> and <num value="5">five</num> hammers strike different bells simultaneously. All irregularity of force is avoided by driving the chime-barrel through wheels and pinions. There are no wheels between the weight that pulls and the hammer to be raised. The lifts on the chime-barrel are all epicycloidal curves; and there are <num value="6000">6,000</num> holes pierced upon the barrel for the lifts, so as to allow the tunes to be varied. The present airs are <title>God save the Queen,</title> <title>The Toast Beef of Old England,</title> <title>Rule Britannia,</title>
and the <num value="104">104</num>th Psalm. The bells, in substance, form, dimensions, &amp;c., are from the Bow bells' patterns; still, they are thought to be too large for the tower. The chime-work is stated to be the <num value="1">first</num> instance in England of producing harmony in bells.
<p>The interior of the Exchange is an open courtyard, resembling the <hi rend=italics>cortile of</hi> Italian palaces. It was almost unanimously decided by the London merchants (in spite of the caprices of our charming climate) to have no covering overhead, a decision probably long ago regretted. The ground floor consists of Doric columns and rusticated arches. Above these runs a series of Ionic columns, with arches and windows surmounted by a highlyorna- mented pierced parapet. The keystones of the arches of the upper storey are decorated with the arms of all the principal nations of the world, in the order determined by the Congress of Vienna. In the centre of the eastern side are the arms of England.
<p>The ambulatory, or Merchants' Walk, is spacious and well sheltered. The arching is divided by beams and panelling, highly painted and decorated in encaustic. In the centre of each panel, on the <num value="4">four</num> sides, the arms of the nations are repeated, <pb id="p.508" n="508"> emblazoned in their proper colours; and in the <num value="4">four</num> angles are the arms of Edward the Confessor, who granted the <num value="1">first</num> and most important charter to the City, Edward III., in whose reign London <num value="1">first</num> grew powerful and wealthy, Queen Elizabeth, who opened the <num value="1">first</num> Exchange, and Charles II., in whose reign the <num value="2">second</num> was built. In the south-east angle is a statue of Queen Elizabeth, by Watson, and in the south-west a marble statue of Charles II., which formerly stood in the centre of the <num value="2">second</num> Exchange, and which escaped the last fire unscathed.
<p>In <num value="8">eight</num> small circular panels of the ambulatory are emblazoned the arms of the <num value="3">three</num> mayors (Pirie, Humphrey, and Magnay), and of the <num value="3">three</num> masters of the Mercers' Company in whose years of office the Exchange was erected. The arms of the chairman of the Gresham Committee, Mr. R. L. Jones, and of the architect, Mr. Tite, complete the heraldic illustrations. The Yorkshire pavement of the ambulatory is panelled and bordered with black stone, and squares of red granite at the intersections. The open area is paved with'the traditional <QUOTE>Turkey stones,</QUOTE> from the old Exchange, which are arranged in Roman patterns, with squares of red Aberdeen granite at the intersections.
<p>On the side-wall panels are the names of the walks, inscribed upon chocolate tablets. In each of the larger compartments are the arms of the <QUOTE>walk,</QUOTE> corresponding with the merchants'. As you enter the colonnade by the west are the arms of the British Empire, with those of Austria on the right, and Bavaria on the reverse side; then, in rotation, are the arms of Belgium, France, Hanover, Holland, Prussia, Sardinia, the <num value="2">Two</num> Sicilies, Sweden and Norway, the United States of America, the initials of the Sultan of Turkey, Spain, Saxony, Russia, Portugal, Hanseatic Towns, Greece, and Denmark. On a marble panel in the Merchants' Area are inscribed the dates of the building and opening of the <num value="3">three</num> Exchanges.
<p> <QUOTE>Here are the same old-favoured spots, changed though they be in appearance,</QUOTE> says the author of the <title>City</title> (<datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct>); <QUOTE>and notwithstanding we have lost the great Rothschild, Jeremiah Harman, Daniel Hardcastle, the younger Rothschilds occupy a pillar on the south side of the Exchange, much in the same place as their father; and the Barings, the Bateses, the Salomons, the Doxats, the Durrants, the Crawshays, the Curries, and the Wilsons, and other influential merchants, still come and go as in olden days. Many sea-captains and brokers still go on &lsquo;Change; but the <Q>walks</Q> are disregarded. The hour at High &lsquo;Change is from <num value="3">3</num>:<num value="30">30</num> to <num value="4">4</num>:<measure value="30d." type=currency><num value="30">30</num> p.</measure>m., the <num value="2">two</num> great days being Tuesday and Friday for foreign exchanges.</QUOTE>
<p>A City writer of <datestruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct> has sketched the chiet celebrities of the Exchange of an earlier date. Mr. Salomon, with his old clothes-man attire, his close-cut grey beard, and his crutch-stick, toddling towards his offices in Shooter's Court, Throgmorton Street; Jemmy Wilkinson, with his old-fashioned manner, and his long-tailed blue coat with gilt buttons.
<p>On the south and east sides of the Exchange are the arms of Gresham, the City, and the Mercers' Company, for heraldry has not even yet died out. Over the <num value="3">three</num> centre arches of the north front are the <num value="3">three</num> following mottoes:--Gresham's (in old French), <foreign lang=fr>Fortun--&agrave; my</foreign>; the City, <QUOTE lang=la>Domine dirige nos</QUOTE> ; the Mercers', <QUOTE lang=la>Honor Deo.</QUOTE>

<p>Surely old heraldry was more religious than modern trade, for the shoddy maker, or the owner of overladen vessels, could hardly inscribe their vessels or their wares with the motto <QUOTE lang=la>Honor Deo;</QUOTE> nor could the director of a bubble company with strict propriety head the columns of his ledger with the solemn words, <QUOTE lang=la>Domine dirige nos.</QUOTE> But these are cynical thoughts, for no doubt trade ranks as many generous, honourable, and pious people among its followers as any other profession; and we have surely every reason to hope that the moral standard is still rising, and that <QUOTE>the honour of an Englishman</QUOTE> will for ever remain a proverb in the East.
<p>The whole of the west end of the Exchange is taken up by the offices and board-rooms of the Royal Exchange Assurance Company, <num value="1">first</num> organised in <datestruct value="1171--"><year reg="1171">1171</year></datestruct>, at meetings in Mercers' Hall. It was an amalgamation of <num value="2">two</num> separate plans. The petition for the royal sanction made, it seems, but slow way through the Council and the Attorney- General's department, for the South Sea Bubble mania was raging, and many of the Ministers, including the Attorney-General himself (and who was indeed afterwards prosecuted), had shares in the great bubble scheme, and wished as far as possible to secure for it the exclusive attention of the company. The petitioners, therefore (under high legal authority), at once commenced business under the temporary title of the Mining, Royal Mineral, and Batteries Works, and in <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a year insured property to the amount of nearly <num value="2">two</num> millions sterling. After the lapse of <num value="2">two</num> years, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, eager for the money to be paid for the charter, and a select committee having made a rigid inquiry into the project, and the cash lodged at the Bank to meet losses, recommended the grant to the House of <pb id="p.509" n="509"> Commons. The Act of the <num value="6">6th</num> George I., cap. <num value="18">18</num>, authorised the king to grant a charter, which was accordingly done, <datestruct VALUE="1720-06-22"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=22>22nd</day>, <year reg=1720>1720</year></datestruct>. The <title>London Assurance,</title> which is also lodged in the Exchange, obtained its charter at the same time. Each of these companies paid <num value="300000">300,000</num> to the Exchequer. They were both allowed to assure on ships at sea, and going to sea, and to lend money on bottomry; and each was to have <QUOTE>perpetual succession</QUOTE> and a common seal. To prevent a monopoly, however, no person holding stock in either of the companies was allowed to purchase stock in the other. In <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>, the <title>Royal Exchange Assurance</title> obtained another charter for assurances on lives, and also of houses and goods from fire. In consequence of the depression of the times, the company was released from the payment of <measure value="150000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="150000">150,000</num></measure> of the <measure value="300000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300000">300,000</num></measure> originally demanded by Government.
<p>At the close of the last, and commencement of the present century, the monopolies of the <num value="2">two</num> companies in marine assurance were sharply assailed. Their enemies at last, however, agreed to an armistice, on their surrendering their special privileges, which (in spite of Earl Grey's exertions) were at last annulled, and any joint-stock company can now effect marine assurances. The loss of the monopoly did not, however, injure either excellent body of underwriters.
<p> <QUOTE>Lloyd's,</QUOTE> at the east end of the north side of the Royal Exchange, contains some magnificent apartments, and the steps of the staircase leading to them are of Craigleath stone, <num value="14">fourteen</num> feet wide. The subscribers' room (for underwriting) is <num value="100">100</num> feet long, by <num value="48">48</num> feet wide, and runs from north to south, on the east side of the Merchants' Quadrangle. This noble chamber has a library attached to it, with a gallery round for maps and charts, which many a shipowner, sick at heart, with fears for his rich argosy, has conned and traced. The captains' room, the board-room, and the clerks' offices, occupy the eastern end; and along the north front is the great commercial room, <num value="80">80</num> feet long, a sort of club-room for strangers and foreign merchants visiting London. The rooms are lit from the ceilings, and also from windows opening into the quadrangle. They are all highly decorated, well warmed and ventilated, and worthy, as Mr. Effingham Wilson, in his book on the Exchange, justly observes, of a great commercial city like London.
<p>The system of marine assurance seems to have been of great antiquity, and probably began with the Italian merchants in
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.509.1">Lombard Street</lemma>.  The <num value="1">first</num> mention of marine insurance in England, says an excellent author, Mr. Burgon, in his <title>Life of Gresham,</title> is in a letter from the Protector Somerset to the Lord Admiral, in <datestruct value="1548--"><year reg="1548">1548</year></datestruct> (Edward VI.), still preserved. Gresham, writing from Antwerp to Sir Thomas Parry, in <datestruct VALUE="1560-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct> (Elizabeth), speaks of armour, ordered by Queen Elizabeth, bought by him at Antwerp, and sent by him to Hamburg for shipment (though only about <num value="12">twelve</num> ships a year came from thence to London). He had also adventured at his own risk, <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">one thousand</num> pounds</measure>&lsquo; worth in a ship which, as he says, <QUOTE>I have caused to be assured upon the Burse at Antwerp.</QUOTE>
<p>The following preamble to the Statute, <num value="43">43rd</num> Elizabeth, proves that marine assurance was even then an old institution in England:--
<p><QUOTE rend=blockquote>Whereas it has been, time out of mind, an usage among merchants, both of this realm and of foreign nations, when they make any great adventures (specially to remote parts), to give some considerable money to other persons (which commonly are no small number) to have from them assurance made of their goods, merchandize, ships, and things adventured, or some part thereof, at such rates, and in such sorts as the parties assurers and the parties assured can agree, which course of dealing is commonly termed a policy of assurance, by means of which it cometh to pass upon the loss or perishing of any ship, there followeth not the undoing of any man, but the loss lighteth rather easily upon many, than heavy upon few; and rather upon them that adventure not, than upon them that adventure; whereby all merchants, specially the younger sort, are allowed to venture more willingly and more freely.</QUOTE>

<p>In <datestruct value="1622--"><year reg="1622">1622</year></datestruct>, Malynes, in his <title>Lex Mercatoria,</title> says that all policies of insurance at Antwerp, and other places in the Low Countries, then and formerly always made, mention that it should be in all things concerning the said assurances, as it was accustomed to be done in Lombard Street, London.
<p>In <datestruct value="1627--"><year reg="1627">1627</year></datestruct> (Charles I.), the marine assurers had rooms in the Royal Exchange, as appears by a law passed in that year, <QUOTE>for the sole making and registering of all manners of assurances, intimations, and renunciations made upon any ship or ships, goods or merchandise in the Royal Exchange, or any other place within the City of London ;</QUOTE> and the Rev. Samuel Rolle, in his
<title>CX. Discourses on the Fire of London,</title> mentions an assurance office in the Royal Exchange, <QUOTE>which undertook for those ships and goods that were hazarded at sea, either by boistrous winds, or dangerous enemies, yet could not secure itself, when sin, like Samson, took hold of the pillars of it, and went about to pull it down.</QUOTE>
<p>After the Fire of London the underwriters met <pb id="p.510" n="510"> in a room near Cornhill; and from thence they removed to a coffee-house in Lombard Street, kept by a person named Lloyd, where intelligence of vessels was collected and made public.

<p>The author of <title>The City</title> (<datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct>) says: <QUOTE><p>The affairs of Lloyd's are now managed by a committee of underwriters, who have a secretary and <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> clerks, besides a number of writers to attend upon the rooms. The rooms, <num value="3">three</num> in number, are called respectively the Subscribers' Room, the Merchants' Room, and the Captains' Room, each of which is frequented by various classes of persons connected with shipping and mercantile life. Since the opening of the Merchants' Room, which event took place when business was re-commenced at the Royal Exchange, at the beginning of this year, an increase has occurred in the number of visitors, and in which numbers the subscribers to Lloyd's are estimated at <num value="1600">1,600</num> individuals.

 <pb id="p.512" n="512"> we shall <num value="1">first</num> describe the business and appearance of the Subscribers' Room. Members to the Subscribers' Room, if they follow the business of underwriter or insurance broker, pay an entrance fee of <num value="25">twenty-five</num> guineas, and an annual subscription of <num value="4">four</num> guineas. If a person is a subscriber only, without practising the craft of underwriting, the payment is limited to the annual subscription fee of <num value="4">four</num> guineas. The Subscribers' Room numbers about <num value="1000">1,000</num> or <num value="1100">1,100</num> members, the great majority of whom follow the business of underwriters and insurance brokers. The most scrupulous attention is paid to the admission of members, and the ballot is put into requisition to determine all matters brought before the committee, or the meeting of the house.
<p>The Underwriters' Room, as at present existing, is a fine spacious room, having seats to accommodate the subscribers and their friends, with drawers and boxes for their books, and an abundant supply of blotting and plain paper, and pens and ink. he underwriters usually fix their seats in <num value="1">one</num> place, and, like the brokers on the Stock Exchange, have their particular as well as casual customers.

<p>Not only has Lloyd's--a mere body of merchants without Government interference or patronage, done much to give stability to our commerce, but it has distinguished itself at critical times by the most princely generosity and benevolence. In the great French war, when we were pushed so hard by the genius of Napoleon, which we had unwisely provoked, Lloyd's opened a subscription for the relief of soldiers' widows and orphans, and commenced an appeal to the general public by the gift of <num value="20000">20,000</num> <num value="3">Three</num> per Cent.
<p>Consols. In <num value="3">three</num> months only the sum subscribed at Lloyd's amounted to more than <measure value="70000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="70000">70,000</num></measure>.

In other charities Lloyd's were equally munificent. They gave <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure> to the London Hospital, for the admission of London merchant-seamen; <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> for suffering inhabitants of Russia, in <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>; <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure> for the relief of the North American Militia (<datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>);  <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> to the Waterloo subscription of <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>;  <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure> for the establishment of lifeboats on the English coast. They also instituted rewards for those brave men who save, or attempt to save, life from shipwreck, and to those who do not require money a medal is given. This medal was executed by W. Wyon, Esq., R.A. The subject of the obverse is the sea-nymph Leucothea appearing to Ulysses on the raft; the moment of the subject chosen is found in the following lines :
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L>This heavenly scarf beneath thy bosom bind,

By the system upon which business is conducted in Lloyd's, information is given to the insurers and the insured; there are registers of almost every ship which floats upon the ocean, the places where they were built, the materials and description of timber used in their construction, their age, state of repair, and general character. An index is kept, showing the voyages in which they have been and are engaged, so that merchants may know the vessel in which they entrust their property, and assurers may ascertain the nature and value of the risk they undertake. Agents are appointed for Lloyd's in almost every seaport in the globe, who send information of arrivals, casualties, and other matters interesting to merchants, shipowners, and underwriters, which information is published daily in <title>Lloyd's List</title>, and transmitted to all parts of the world. The collection of charts and maps is <num value="1">one</num> of the most correct and comprehensive in the world. The Lords of the Admiralty presented Lloyd's with copies of all the charts made from actual surveys, and the East India Company was equally generous. The King of Prussia presented Lloyd's with copies of the charts of the Baltic, all made from surveys, and printed by the Prussian Government. Masters <pb id="p.513" n="513"> of all ships, and of whatever nation, frequenting the port of London, have access to this collection.
<p>Before the last fire at the Exchange there was, on the stairs leading to Lloyd's, a monument to Captain Lydekker, the great benefactor to the London Seamen's Hospital. This worthy man was a shipowner engaged in the South Sea trade, and some of his sick sailors having been kindly treated in the <QUOTE>Dreadnought</QUOTE> hospital ship, in <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, he gave a donation of <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> to the Society. On his death, in <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, he left <num value="4">four</num> ships and their stores, and the residue of his estate, after the payment of certain legacies. The legacy amounted to <measure value="48434l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="48434">48,434</num></measure> <measure value="16s. 11d." type=Currency><num value="16">16</num>s. <num value="11">11</num>d.</measure> in the <num value="3">Three</num> per Cents., and <measure value="10295l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10295">10,295</num></measure> <measure value="11s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="11">11</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> in cash was eventually received. The monument being destroyed by the fire in <datestruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct>, a new monument, by Mr. Sanders, sculptor, was executed for the entrance to Lloyd's rooms.
<p>The remark of <QUOTE>a good book</QUOTE> or <QUOTE>a bad book</QUOTE> among the subscribers to Lloyd's is a sure index to the prospects of the day, the <num value="1">one</num> being indicative of premium to be received, the other of losses to be paid. The life of the. underwriter, like the stock speculator, is <num value="1">one</num> of great anxiety, the events of the day often raising his expectations to the highest, or depressing them to the lowest pitch; and years are often spent in the hope for acquisition of that which he never obtains. Among the old stagers of the room there is often strong antipathy expressed against the insurance of certain ships, but we never recollect its being carried out to such an extent as in the case of <num value="1">one</num> vessel. She was a steady trader, named after <num value="1">one</num> of the most venerable members of the room, and it was a most curious coincidence that he invariably refused to <QUOTE>write her</QUOTE> for <QUOTE>a single line.</QUOTE> Often he was joked upon the subject, and pressed <QUOTE>to do a little</QUOTE> for his namesake, but he as frequently denied, shaking his head in a doubtful manner. <num value="1">One</num> morning the subscribers were reading the <QUOTE>double lines,</QUOTE> or the losses, and among them was the total wreck of this identical ship.
<p>There seems to have been a regret on the <num value="1">first</num> opening of the Exchange for the coziness and quiet comfort of the old building. Old frequenters missed the firm oak benches in the old ambulatoria, the walls covered with placards of ships about to sail, the amusing advertisements and lists of the sworn brokers of London, and could not acquire a rapid friendship for the encaustic flowers and gay colours of the new design. They missed the old sonorous bell, and the names of the old walks.

<P>OF Lothbury, a street on the north side of the Bank of England, Stow says: <QUOTE>The Street of Lothberie, Lathberie, or Loadberie (for by all those names.have I read it), took the name as it seemeth of <hi rend=italics>berie</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>court</hi>, of old time there kept, but by whom is grown out of memory. This street is possessed for the most part by founders that cast candlesticks, chafing dishes, spice mortars, and such-like copper or laton works, and do afterwards turn them with the foot and not with the wheel, to make them smooth and bright with turning and scratching (as some do term it), making a loathsome noise to the by-passers that have not been used to the like, and therefore by them disdainfully called Lothberie.</QUOTE>

<p>Stow says of St. Margaret's, Lothbury: <QUOTE>I find it called the Chappel of St. Margaret's de Lothberie, in the reign of Edward II., when in the <num value="15">15th</num> <pb id="p.514" n="514"> of that king's reign, license was granted to found a chauntry there. There be monuments in this church of Reginald Coleman, son to Robert Coleman, buried there <datestruct value="1383--"><year reg="1383">1383</year></datestruct>. This said Robert Coleman may be supposed the <num value="1">first</num> builder or owner of Coleman Street; and that St. Stephen's Church, there builded in Coleman Street, was but a chappel belonging to the parish church of St. Olave, in the Jewry.</QUOTE> In niches on either side of the altar-piece are <num value="2">two</num> flat figures, cut out of wood, and painted to represent Moses and Aaron. These were originally in the Church of St. Christopher le Stocks, but when that church was pulled down to make way for the west end of the Bank of England, and the parish was united by Act of Parliament to that of St. Margaret, Lothbury (in <datestruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></datestruct> ), they were removed to the place they now occupy. At the west end of the church is a metal bust inscribed to Petrus le Maire, <datestruct value="1631--"><year reg="1631">1631</year></datestruct>; this originally stood in St. Christopher's, and was brought here after the fire.
<p>This church, which is a rectory, seated over the ancient course of Walbrook, on the north side of Lothbury, in the Ward of Coleman Street (says Maitland), owes its name to its being dedicated to St. Margaret, a virgin saint of Antioch, who suffered in the reign of Decius.

<p>Tokenhouse Yard, leading out of Lothbury, derived its name from an old house which was once the office for the delivery of farthing pocketpieces, or tokens, issued for several centuries by many London tradesmen. Copper coinage, with very few exceptions, was unauthorised in England till <datestruct value="1672"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>. Edward VI. coined silver farthings, but Queen Elizabeth conceived a great prejudice to copper coins, from the spurious <QUOTE>black money,</QUOTE> or copper coins washed with silver, which had got into circulation. The silver halfpenny, though inconveniently small, continued down to the time of the Commonwealth. In the time of Elizabeth, besides the Nuremberg tokens which are often found in Elizabethan ruins, many provincial cities issued tokens for provincial circulation, which were ultimately called in. In London no less than <num value="3000">3,000</num> persons, tradesmen and others, issued tokens, for which the issuer and his friends gave current coin on delivery. In <datestruct value="1594--"><year reg="1594">1594</year></datestruct> the Government struck a small copper coin, <QUOTE>the pledge of a halfpenny,</QUOTE> about the size of a silver twopence, but Queen Elizabeth could never be prevailed upon to sanction the issue. Sir Robert Cotton, writing in <datestruct value="1607--"><year reg="1607">1607</year></datestruct> (James I.), on how the kings of England have supported and repaired their estates, says there were then <num value="3000">3,000</num> London tradesmen who cast annually each about <measure value="5l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="5">5</num></measure> worth of lead tokens, their store amounting to some <measure value="15000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="15000">15,000</num></measure>. London having then about <num value="800000">800,000</num> inhabitants, this amounted to about <measure value="2d." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>d.</measure> a person; and he urged the King to restrain tradesmen from issuing these tokens.--In consequence of this representation, James, in <datestruct value="1613--"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct>, issued royal farthing tokens (<num value="2">two</num> sceptres in saltier and a crown on <num value="1">one</num> side, and a harp on the other), so that if the English took a dislike to them they might be ordered to pass in Ireland. They were not made a legal tender, and had but a narrow circulation. In <datestruct value="1635--"><year reg="1635">1635</year></datestruct> Charles I. struck more of these, and in <datestruct value="1636--"><year reg="1636">1636</year></datestruct> granted a patent for the coinage of farthlings to Henry Lord Maltravers and Sir Francis Crane. During the Civil War tradesmen again issued heaps of tokens, the want of copper money being greatly felt. Charles II. had halfpence and farthings struck at the Tower in <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>, and <num value="2">two</num> years afterwards they were made a legal tender, by proclamation; they were of pure Swedish copper. In <datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct> there was a coinage of tin farthings, with a copper centre, and the inscription,
<QUOTE lang=la>Nummorum famulus.</QUOTE> The following year halfpence of the same description were issued, and the use of copper was not resumed till <datestruct value="1693"><year reg="1693">1693</year></datestruct>, when all the tin money was called in. Speaking of the supposed mythical Queen Anne's farthing, Mr. Pinkerton says:-- <QUOTE>All the farthings of the following reign of Anne are trial pieces, since that of <datestruct value="1712--"><year reg="1712">1712</year></datestruct>, her last year.

<p>Tokenhouse Yard was built in the reign of Charles I., on the site of a house and garden of the Earl of Arundel (removed to the Strand), by Sir William Petty, an early writer on political economy, and a lineal ancestor of the present Marquis of Lansdowne. This extraordinary genius, the son of a Hampshire clothier, was <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest members of the Royal Society. He studied anatomy with Hobbes in Paris, wrote numerous philosophical works, suggested improvements for the navy, and, in fact, explored almost every path of science. Aubrey says that, being challenged by Sir Hierom Sankey, <num value="1">one</num> of Cromwell's knights, Petty being short-sighted, chose for place a dark cellar, and for weapons a big carpenter's axe. Petty's house was destroyed in the Fire of London. John Grant, says Peter Cunningham, also had property in Tokenhouse Yard. It was for Grant that Petty is said to have compiled the bills of mortality which bear his name.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.515.2">Defoe</lemma>, who, however, was only <num value="3">three</num> years old when the Plague broke out, has laid <num value="1">one</num> of the most terrible scenes in his <title>History of the Plague in Tokenhouse Yard.</title> <QUOTE>In my walks,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>I had many dismal scenes before my eyes, as particularly of persons falling dead in the streets, terrible shrieks and screeching of women, who in their agonies would throw open their chamber windows, and cry out in a dismal surprising manner.

Just in Bell Alley, on the right hand of the passage, there was a more terrible cry than that, though it was not so directed out at the window; but the whole family was in a terrible fright, and I could hear women and children run screaming about the rooms like distracted; when a garret window opened, and somebody from a window on the other side the alley called and asked,  <Q>What is the matter?</Q>  upon which, from the <num value="1">first</num> window it was answered,  <Q> Ay, ay, quite dead and cold!</Q>  This person was a merchant, and a deputy-alderman, and very rich.

<P>Throgmorton Street is at the north-east corner of the Bank of England, and was so called after Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, who is said to have been poisoned by Dudley, Earl of Leicester, Queen Elizabeth's favourite. There is a monument to his memory in the Church of St. Catherine Cree.
<P>The Drapers' <num value="1">first</num> Hall, according to Herbert, was in Cornhill; the <num value="2">second</num> was in Throgmorton Street, to which they came in <datestruct value="1541--"><year reg="1541">1541</year></datestruct> (Henry VIII.), on the beheading of Cromwell, Earl of Essex, its previous owner; and the
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.515.3">present structure</lemma> was reerected on its site, after the Great Fire of London.
<P>Stow, describing the Augustine Friars' Church, says there have been built at its west end <QUOTE>many feyre houses, namely, in Throgmorton Streete;</QUOTE> and among the rest, <QUOTE><num value="1">one</num> very large and spacious,</QUOTE> <pb id="p.516" n="516"> builded, he says, <QUOTE>in place of olde and small tenements, by Thomas Cromwell, minister of the King's jewell-house, after that Maister of the Rolls, then Lord Cromwell, Knight, Lord Privie Seale, Vicker- Generall, Earle of Essex, High Chamberlain of England, &amp;c. ;</QUOTE> and he then tells the following story respecting it:--
<p> <QUOTE>This house being finished, and having some reasonable plot of ground left for a garden, hee caused the pales of the gardens adjoining to the north parte thereof, on a sodaine, to bee taken down, <num value="22">twenty-two</num> foote to be measured forth right into the north of every man's ground, a line there to be drawne, a trench to be cast, a foundation laid, and a high bricke wall to be builded.

<p>The Company was incorporated in <datestruct value="1439--"><year reg="1439">1439</year></datestruct> (Henry VI.), but it also possesses a charter granted them by Edward III., that they might regulate the sale of cloths according to the statute. Drapers were originally makers, not merely, as now, dealers in cloth. (Herbert.) The country drapers were called clothiers; the wool-merchants, staplers. The Britons and Saxons were both, according to the best authorities, familiar with the art of cloth-making; but the greater part of English wool, from the earliest times, seems to have been sent to the Netherlands, and from thence returned in the shape of fine cloth, since we find King Ethelred, as early as <datestruct value="967"><year reg="967">967</year></datestruct>, exacting from the Easterling. merchants of the Steel Yard, in Thames Street, tolls of cloth, which were paid at Billingsgate.
<p>The width of woollen cloth is prescribed in Magna Charta. There was a weavers' guild in the reign of Henry I., and the drapers are mentioned soon after as flourishing in all the large provincial <pb id="p.517" n="517"> cities. It is supposed that the cloths sold by such drapers were red, green, and scarlet cloths, made in Flanders. In the next reign English cloths, made of Spanish wool, are spoken of. Drapers are recorded in the reign of Henry II. as paying fines to the king for permission to sell dyed cloths. In the same reign, English cloths made of Spanish wool are mentioned. In the reign of Edward I., the cloth of Candlewick Street (Cannon Street) was famous. The guild paid the king <measure value="2bmark" type=currency><num value="2">two</num> marks</measure> of gold every year at the feast of Michaelmas.
<p>But Edward III., jealous of the Netherlands, set to work to establish the English cloth manufacture. He forbade the exportation of English wool, and invited over <num value="70">seventy</num> Walloon weaver families, who settled in Cannon Street. The Flemings had their meeting-place in St. Lawrence Poultney churchyard, and the Brabanters in the churchyard of St. Mary Somerset. In <datestruct value="1361--"><year reg="1361">1361</year></datestruct> the king removed the wool staple from Calais to Westminster and <num value="9">nine</num> English towns. In <datestruct value="1378--"><year reg="1378">1378</year></datestruct> Richard II. again changed the wool staple from Westminster to Staples' Inn, Holborn; and in <datestruct value="1397--"><year reg="1397">1397</year></datestruct> a weekly cloth-market was established at Blackwell Hall, Basinghall Street ;
<FIGURE id="Fig.517" n="2000.06.0189"><HEAD>Drapers' Hall Garden.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 the London drapers at <num value="1">first</num> opposing the right of the country clothiers to sell in gross.
<p>The drapers for a long time lingered about Cornhill, where they had <num value="1">first</num> settled, living in Birchin Lane, and spreading as far as the Stocks' Market; but in the reign of Henry VI. the drapers had all removed to Cannon Street, where we find them tempting Lydgate's <title>London Lickpenny</title> with their wares. In this reign arms were granted to the Company, and the grant is still preserved in the British Museum.
<p>The books of the Company commence in the reign of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.517.1">Edward IV.</lemma>, and are full of curious details relating to dress, observances, government, and trade. Edward IV., it must be remembered, in <datestruct value="1479--"><year reg="1479">1479</year></datestruct>, when he had invited the mayor and aldermen to a great hunt at Waltham Forest, not to forget the City ladies, sent them <num value="2">two</num> harts, <num value="6">six</num> bucks, and a tun of wine, with which noble present the lady mayoress (wife of Sir Bartholomew James, Draper) entertained the aldermen's wives at Drapers' Hall, St. Swithin's Lane, Cannon Street. he chief extracts from the Drapers' records made by Herbert are the following:--
<p>In <datestruct value="1476--"><year reg="1476">1476</year></datestruct> <num value="40">forty</num> of the Company rode to meet <pb id="p.518" n="518"> Edward IV. on his return from France, at a cost of <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure>. In <datestruct value="1483--"><year reg="1483">1483</year></datestruct> they sent <num value="6">six</num> persons to welcome the unhappy Edward V., whom the Dukes of Gloucester and Buckingham, preparatory to his murder, had brought to London; and in the following November, the Company dispatched <num value="22">twenty-two</num> of the livery, in many-coloured coats, to attend the coronation procession of Edward's wicked hunchback uncle, Richard III. Presently they mustered <num value="200">200</num> men, on the rising of the Kentish rebels; and again, in Finsbury Fields, at <QUOTE>the coming of the Northern men.</QUOTE> They paid <measure value="9s." type=currency><num value="9">9</num>s.</measure> for boat hire to Westminster, to attend the funeral of Queen Anne (Richard's queen).
<p>In Henry VII.'s reign, we find the Drapers again boating to Westminster, to present their bill for the reformation of cloth-making. The barge seems to have been well supplied with ribs of beef, wine, and pippins. We find the ubiquitous Company at many other ceremonies of this reign, such as the coronation of the queen, &amp;c.
<p>In <datestruct value="1491--"><year reg="1491">1491</year></datestruct> the Merchant Taylors came to a conference at Drapers' Hall, about some disputes in the cloth trade, and were hospitably entertained with bread and wine. In the great riots at the Steel Yard, when the London &lsquo;prentices tried to sack the Flemish warehouses, the Drapers helped to guard the depot, with weapons, cressets, and banners. hey probably also mustered for the king at Blackheath against the Cornish insurgents. We meet them again at the procession that welcomed Princess Katherine of Spain, who married Prince Arthur; then, in the Lady Chapel at St. Paul's, listening to Prince Arthur's requiem; and, again, bearing <num value="12">twelve</num> enormous torches of wax at the burial of Henry VII., the prince's father.
<p>In <datestruct value="1514--"><year reg="1514">1514</year></datestruct> (Henry VIII.) Sir William Capell left the Drapers' Company houses in various parts of London, on condition of certain prayers being read for his soul, and certain doles being given. n <datestruct value="1521--"><year reg="1521">1521</year></datestruct> the Company, sorely against its will, was compelled by the arbitrary king to help fit out <num value="5">five</num> ships of discovery for

The same year, Sir John Brugge, Mayor and Draper, being invited to the Serjeants' Feast at Ely House, Holborn, the masters of the Drapers and <num value="7">seven</num> other crafts attended in their best livery gowns and hoods; the Mayor presiding at the high board, the Master of the Rolls at the <num value="2">second</num>, the Master of the Drapers at the <num value="3">third</num>.

<p>In <datestruct value="1527--"><year reg="1527">1527</year></datestruct> great disputes arose between the Drapers and the Crutched Friars. Sir John Milborne, who was several times master of the Company, and mayor in <datestruct value="1521--"><year reg="1521">1521</year></datestruct>, had built <num value="13">thirteen</num> almshouses, near the friars' church, for <num value="13">thirteen</num> old men, who were daily at his tomb to say prayers for his soul. here was also to be an anniversary obit. The Drapers' complaint was that the religious services were neglected, and that the friars had encroached on the ground of Milborne's charity. Henry VIII. afterwards gave Crutched Friars to Sir Thomas Wyat, the poetical friend of the Earl of Surrey, who built a mansion there, which was afterwards Lumley House. At the dissolution of monasteries, the Company paid <measure value="1402l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1402">1,402</num></measure> <measure value="6s." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>s.</measure> for their chantries and obits.
<p>The dress or livery of the Company seems to have varied more than that of any other-from violet, crimson, murrey, blue, blue and crimson, to brown, puce. In the reign of James I. a uniform garb was finally adopted. The observances of the Company at elections, funerals, obits, and pageants were quaint, friendly, and clubable enough. Every year, at Lady Day, the whole body of the fellowship in new livery went to Bow Church (afterwards to St. Michael's, Cornhill), there heard the Lady ass, and offered each a silver penny on the altar. At evensong they again attended, and heard dirges chanted for deceased members. On the following day they came and heard the Mass of Requiem, and offered another silver penny. On the day of the feast they walked <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="2">two</num> in livery to the dining-place, each member paying <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> shillings</measure> the year that no clothes were supplied, and <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> only when they were. he year's quarterage was sevenpence. In <datestruct value="1522--"><year reg="1522">1522</year></datestruct> the election dinner consisted of fowls, swans, geese, pike, half a buck, pasties, conies, pigeons, tarts, pears, and filberts. The guests all washed after dinner, standing. At the side-tables ale and claret were served in wooden cups; but at the high table they gave pots and wooden cups for ale and wine, but for red wine and hippocras gilt cups. After being served with wafers and spiced wine, the masters went among the guests and gathered the quarterage. The old master then rose and went into the parlour, with a garland on his head <pb id="p.519" n="519"> and his cupbearer before him, and, going straight to the upper end of the high board, without minstrels, chose the new master, and then sat down. Then the masters went into the parlour, and took their garlands and <num value="4">four</num> cupbearers, and crossed the great parlour till they came to the upper end of the high board; and there the chief warden delivered his garland to the warden he chose, and the <num value="3">three</num> other wardens did likewise, proffering the garlands to divers persons, and at last delivering them to the real persons selected. After this all the company rose and greeted the new master and wardens, and the dessert began. At some of these great feasts some <num value="230">230</num> people sat down. The lady members and guests sometimes dined with the brothers, and sometimes in separate rooms. At the Midsummer dinner, or dinners, of <datestruct value="1515--"><year reg="1515">1515</year></datestruct>, <num value="6">six</num> bucks seem to have been eaten, besides <num value="3">three</num> boars, a barrelled sturgeon, <num value="24">twenty-four</num> dozen quails; <num value="3">three</num> hogsheads of wine, <num value="21">twenty-one</num> gallons of muscadel, and <num value="13">thirteen</num> and a half barrels of ale. It was usual at these generous banquets to have players and minstrels.
<p>The funerals of the Company generally ended with a dinner, at which the chaplains and a chosen few of the Company feasted. The Company's pall was always used; and on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, in <datestruct value="1518--"><year reg="1518">1518</year></datestruct>, we find a silver spoon given to each of the <num value="6">six</num> bearers. Spiced bread, bread and cheese, fruit, and ale were also partaken of at these obits, sometimes at the church, sometimes at a neighbouring tavern. At the funeral of Sir Roger Achilley, Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1513--"><year reg="1513">1513</year></datestruct>, there seem to have been <num value="24">twenty-four</num> torchbearers. The pews were apparently hung with black, and children.holding torches stood by the hearse. The Company maintained <num value="2">two</num> priests at St. Michael's, Cornhill. The funeral of Sir William Roche, Mayor in <datestruct value="1523--"><year reg="1523">1523</year></datestruct>, was singularly splendid. <num value="1">First</num> came <num value="2">two</num> branches of white wax, borne before the priests and clerks, who paced in surplices, singing as they paced. Then followed a standard, blazoned with the dead man's crest-a red deer's head, with gilt horns, and gold and green wings. Next followed mourners, and after them the herald, with the dead man's coat armour, checkered silver and azure. Then followed the corpse, attended by clerks and the livery. After the corpse came the son, the chief mourner, and <num value="2">two</num> other couples of mourners. The sword-bearer and Lord Mayor, in state, walked next; then the aldermen, sheriffs, and the Drapery livery, followed by all the ladies, gentlewomen, and aldermen's wives. After the dirge, they all went to the dead man's house, and partook of spiced bread and comfits, with ale and beer. The next day the mourners had a collection at the church. Then the chief mourners presented the target, sword, helmet, and banners to the priests, and a collection was made for the poor. Directly after the sacrament, the mourners went to Mrs. Roche's house, and dined, the livery dining at the Drapers' Hall, the deceased having left <measure value="6l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="6">6</num></measure> <measure value="15s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="15">15</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> for that purpose. The record concludes thus: <QUOTE>And my Lady Roche, of her gentylness, sent them moreover <num value="4">four</num> gallons of French wine, and also a box of wafers, and a pottell of ipocras. For whose soul let us pray, and all Christian souls. Amen.</QUOTE> The Company maintained priests, altars, and lights at St. Mary Woolnoth's, St. Michael's, Cornhill, St. Thomas of Acon, Austin Friars, and the Priory of St. Bartholomew.
<p>The Drapers' ordinances are of great interest. very apprentice, on being enrolled, paid fees, which went to a fund called <QUOTE>spoon silver.</QUOTE> The mode of correcting these wayward lads was sometimes singular. Thus we find <num value="1">one</num> Needswell in the parlour, on court day, flogged by <num value="2">two</num> tall men, disguised in canvas frocks, hoods, and vizors, twopennyworth of birchen rods being expended on his moral improvement. The Drapers had a special ordinance, in the reign of Henry IV., to visit the fairs of Westminster, St. Bartholomew, Spitalfields, and Southwark, to make a trade search, and to measure doubtful goods by the <QUOTE>Drapers' Bell,</QUOTE> a standard said to have been granted them by King Edward III. Bread, wine, and pears seem to have been the frugal entertainment of the searchers.
<p>Decayed brothers were always pensioned; thus we find, in <datestruct value="1526--"><year reg="1526">1526</year></datestruct>, Sir Laurence Aylmer, who had actually been mayor in <datestruct value="1507--"><year reg="1507">1507</year></datestruct>, applying for alms, and relieved, we regret to state, somewhat grudgingly. In <datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct> Mr. Lawford, clerk of the Company, stated to the Commissioners of Municipal Inquiry that there were then <num value="60">sixty</num> poor freemen on the charity roll, who received <measure value="10l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10">10</num></measure> a year each. The master and wardens also gave from the Company's bounty quarterly sums of money to about <num value="50">fifty</num> or <num value="60">sixty</num> other poor persons. In cases where members of the court fell into decay, they received pensions during the court's pleasure. <num value="1">One</num> person of high repute, then recently deceased, had received the sum of <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure> per annum, and on this occasion the City had given him back his sheriff's fine. The attendance fee given to members of the court was <num value="2">two</num> guineas.
<p>From <datestruct value="1531--"><year reg="1531">1531</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1714--"><year reg="1714">1714</year></datestruct>, Strype reckons <num value="53">fifty-three</num> Draper mayors. <num value="8">Eight</num> of these were the heads of noble families, <num value="43">forty-three</num> were knights or baronets, <num value="15">fifteen</num> represented the City in Parliament, <num value="7">seven</num> <pb id="p.520" n="520"> were founders of churches and public institutions.

<p> <QUOTE>What gives the festivities of this Company an unique zest,</QUOTE> says Herbert, <QUOTE>however, is the visitors at them, and which included a now extinct race.

<p>The last public procession of the Drapers' Company was in <datestruct value="1761--"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>, when the master wardens and court of assistants walked in rank to hear a sermon at St. Peter's, Cornhill; a number of them each carried a pair of shoes, stockings, and a suit of clothes, the annual legacy to the poor of this Company.
<p>The Drapers possess <num value="7">seven</num> original charters, all of them with the Great Seal attached, finely written, and in excellent preservation. These charters comprise those of Edward I., Henry VI., Edward IV., Philip and Mary, Elizabeth, and <num value="2">two</num> of James I. The latter is the acting charter of the company.

<FIGURE id="Fig.520" n="2000.06.0209"><HEAD>Cromwell's House, From Aggas's Map. (Taken From Herbert's <title>City Companies.</title>)</HEAD></FIGURE>

<p>Aggas's drawing represents Cromwell House almost windowless, on the street side, and with <num value="3">three</num> small embattled turrets; and there was a footway through the garden of Winchester House, which forms the present passage (says Herbert) from the east end of Throgmorton Street, through Austin Friars to Great Winchester Street. The Great Fire stopped northwards at Drapers' Hall. The renter warden lost <measure value="446l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="446">446</num></measure> of the Company's money, but the Company's plate was buried safely in a sewer in the garden. Till the hall could be rebuilt, Sir Robert Clayton lent the Drapers a large room in Austin Friars. The hall was rebuilt by Jarman, who built the <num value="2">second</num> Exchange and Fishmongers' Hall. The hall had a very narrow escape (says Herbert) in <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct> from a fire, which <pb id="p.521" n="521"> broke out in the vaults beneath the hall (let out as a store-cellar), and destroyed a considerable part of the building, together with a number of houses on the west side of Austin Friars.
<p>The
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.521.1">present Drapers' Hall</lemma> is Mr. Jarman's structure, but altered, and partly rebuilt after the fire in <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>, and partly rebuilt again in <datestruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></datestruct>. It principally consists of a spacious quadrangle, surrounded by a fine piazza or ambulatory of arches, supported by columns. The quiet old garden greatly improves the hall, which, from this appendage, and its own elegance, might be readily supposed the mansion of a person of high rank.
<p>The present Throgmorton Street front of the building is of stone and marble, and was built by Mr. Herbert Williams, who also erected the splendid new hall, removing the old gallery, adding a marble staircase fit for an emperor's palace, and new facing the court-room, the ceiling of which was at the same time raised. Marble pillars, stained glass windows, carved marble mantelpieces, gilt panelled ceilings-everything that is rich and tasteful--the architect has used with lavish profusion.
<p>The buildings of the former interior were of fine red brick, but the front and entrance, in Throgmorton Street, was of a yellow brick; both interior and exterior were highly enriched with stone ornaments. Over the gateway was a large sculpture of the Drapers' arms, a cornice and frieze, the latter displaying lions' heads, rams' heads, &amp;c., in small circles, and various other architectural decorations.
<p>The old hall, properly so called, occupied the eastern side of the quadrangle, the ascent to it being by a noble stone staircase, covered, and highly embellished by stucco-work, gilding, &amp;c. he stately screen of this magnificent apartment was curiously decorated with carved pillars, pilasters, arches, &amp;c. The ceiling was divided into numerous compartments, chiefly circular, displaying, in the centre, Phaeton in his car, and round him the signs of the zodiac, and various other enrichments. In the wainscoting was a neat recess, with shelves, whereon the Company's plate, which, both for quality and workmanship, is of great value, was displayed at their feasts. Above the screen, at the end opposite the master's chair, hung a portrait of Lord Nelson, by Sir William Beechey, for which the Company paid <num value="400">four hundred</num> guineas, together with the portrait of Fitz-Alwin, the great Draper, already mentioned. <QUOTE>In denominating this portrait
<hi>curious</hi>,</QUOTE> says Herbert, <QUOTE>we give as high praise as can be afforded it. Oil-painting was totally unknown to England in Fitz-Alwin's time; the style of dress, andits execution as a work of art, are also too modern.</QUOTE>
<p>In the gallery, between the old hall and the livery-room, were full-length portraits of the English sovereigns, from William III. to George III., together with a full-length portrait of George IV., by Lawrence, and the celebrated picture of Mary Queen of Scots, and her son, James I., by Zucchero. he portrait of the latter king is a fine specimen of the master, and is said to have cost the Company between <measure value="600l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="600">600</num></measure> and <measure value="700l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="700">700</num></measure>. <QUOTE>It has a fault, however,</QUOTE> says Herbert, <QUOTE>observable in other portraits of this monarch, that of the likeness being flattered. If it was not uncourteous so to say, we should call it George IV. with the face of the Prince of Wales. Respecting the portrait of Mary and her son, there has been much discussion. Its genuineness has been doubted, from the circumstance of James having been only a twelvemonth old when this picture is thought to have been painted, and his being here represented of the age of <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num>; but the anachronism might have arisen from the whole being a composition of the artist, executed, not from the life, but from other authorities furnished to him.</QUOTE> It was cleaned and copied by Spiridione Roma, for Boydell's print, who took off a mask of dirt from it, and is certainly a very interesting picture. There is another tradition of this picture: that Sir Anthony Babington, confidential secretary to
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.521.2">Queen Mary</lemma>, had her portrait, which he deposited, for safety, either, at Merchant Taylors' Hall or Drapers' Hall, and that it had never come back to Sir Anthony or his family. It has been insinuated that Sir William Boreman, clerk to the Board of Green Cloth in the reign of Charles II., purloined this picture from <num value="1">one</num> of the royal palaces. Some absurdly suggest that it is the portrait of Lady Dulcibella Boreman, the wife of Sir William. There is a tradition that this valuable picture was thrown over the wall into Drapers' Garden during the Great Fire, and never reclaimed.
<p>The old court-room adjoined the hall, and formed the north side of the quadrangle. It was wainscoted, and elegantly fitted up, lile the last. The fire-place was very handsome, and had over the centre a small oblong compartment in white marble, with a representation of the Company receiving their charter. The ceiling was stuccoed, somewhat similarly to the hall, with various subjects allusive to. the Drapers' trade and to the heraldic bearings of the Company. Both the (dining) hall and this apartment were rebuilt after the fire in <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>.
<p>The old gallery led to the ladies' chamber and livery-room. In the former, balls, &amp;c., were occasionally held. This was also a very elegant room. <pb id="p.522" n="522"> The livery-room was a fine lofty apartment, and next in size to the hall. Here were portraits of Sir Joseph Sheldon, Lord Mayor, <datestruct value="1677--"><year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>, by Gerard Soest, and a <num value="3">three</num>-quarter length of Sir Robert Clayton, by Kneller, <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>, seated in a chair--a great benefactor to Christ's Hospital, and to that of St. Thomas, in Southwark; and <num value="2">two</num> benefactors-Sir William Boreman, an officer of the Board of Green Cloth in the reigns of Charles I. and Charles II., who endowed a free school at Greenwich; and Henry Dixon, of Enfield, who left land in that parish for apprenticing boys of the same parish, and giving a sum to such as were bound to freemen of London at the end of their apprenticeship. Here was also a fine portrait of Mr. Smith, late clerk of the Company (threequarters); a smaller portrait of Thomas Bagshaw, who died in <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>, having been beadle to the Company <num value="40">forty</num> years, and who for his long and faithful services has been thus honoured. The windows of the livery-room overlook the private garden, in the midst of which is a small basin of water, with a fountain and statue. The large garden, which adjoins this, is constantly open to the public, from morning till night, excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and the Company's festival days. This is a pleasant and extensive plot of ground, neatly laid out with gravelled walks, a grass-plot, flowering shrubs, lime-trees, pavilions, &amp;c. Beneath what was formerly the ladies' chamber is the record-room, which is constructed of stone and iron, and made fire-proof, for the more effectually securing of the Company's archives, books, plate, and other valuable and important documents.

<P>Bartholomew Lane is associated with the memory of Mr. George Robins, <num value="1">one</num> of the most eloquent auctioneers who ever wielded an ivory hammer.
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.522.1">The Auction Mart</lemma> stood opposite the Rotunda of the Bank. It is said that Robins was once offered <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure> and all his expenses to go and dispose of a valuable property in New York. His annual income was guessed at <measure value="12000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="12000">12,000</num></measure>. It is said that half the landed property in England had passed under his hammer. Robins, with incomparable powers of blarney and soft sawder, wrote poetical and alluring advertisements (attributed by some to eminent literary men), which were irresistibly attractive. His notice of the sale of the twentyseven years' lease of the Olympic, at the death of Mr. Scott, in <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>, was a marvel of adroitness:--

<L>THE MOST SPLENDID LITTLE THEATRE IN EUROPE;

<p>The sale itself is thus described by Mr. Grant, who writes as if he had been present:-- <QUOTE>Mr. Robins,</QUOTE> says Grant, <QUOTE>had exhausted the English language in commendation of that theatre; he
<FIGURE id="Fig.523" n="2000.06.0190"><HEAD>Pope's House, Plough Court, Lombard Street.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 made it as clear as any proposition in Euclid that Madame Vestris could not possibly succeed in Covent Garden; that, in fact, she could succeed in no other house than the Olympic; and that consequently the purchaser was quite sure of her as a tenant as long as he chose to let the theatre to her. He proved to demonstration that the theatre would always fill, no matter who should be the lessee; and that consequently it would prove a perfect mine of wealth to the lucky gentleman who was sufficiently alive to his own interests to become the purchaser. By means of such representations, made in a way and with an ingenuity peculiar to himself, Mr. Robins had got the biddings up from the starting sum, which was <measure value="3000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3000">3,000</num></measure>, to <measure value="3400l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3400">3,400</num></measure>. <pb id="p.524" n="524"> There, however, the aspirants to the property came to what Mr. Robins called a dead stop. For at least <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> minutes he put his ingenuity to the rack in lavishing encomiums on the property, without his zeal and eloquence being rewarded by a single new bidding. It was at this extremityand he never resorts to the expedient until the bidders have reached what they themselves at the time conceive to be the highest point--it was at this crisis of the Olympic, Mr. Robins, causing the hammer to descend in the manner I have described, and accompanying the slow and solemn movement with a  <Q> Going-going-go--,</Q>  that the then highest bidder exclaimed,  <Q>The theatre is mine!</Q>  and at which Mr. Robins, apostrophising him in his own bland and fascinating manner, remarked,  <Q>I don't wonder, my friend, that your anxiety to possess the property at such a price should anticipate my decision; but,</Q>  looking round the audience and smiling, as if he congratulated them on the circumstance,  <Q>it is still in the market, gentlemen : you have still an opportunity of making your fortunes without risk or trouble.</Q>  The bidding that instant recommenced, and proceeded more briskly than ever.

<p>After the expulsion of the Jews, the Lombards (or merchants of Genoa, Lucca, Florence, and Venice) succeeded them as the money-lenders and bankers of England. About the middle of the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century these Italians established themselves in Lombard Street, remitting money to Italy by bills of exchange, and transmitting to the Pope and Italian prelates their fees, and the incomes of their English benefices. Mr. Burgon has shown that to these industrious strangers we owe many of our commercial terms, such, for instance, as
<hi rend=italics>debtor, creditor, cash, usance, bank, bankrupt, journal, diary, ditto</hi>, and even our s. d., which originally stood for <hi rend=italics>libri, soldi</hi>, and <hi rend=italics>denari</hi>. In the early part of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century we find these swarthy merchants advancing loans to the State, and having the customs mortgaged to them by way of security. Pardons and holy wafers were also sold in this street before the Reformation.
<p><num value="1">One</num> of the celebrated dwellers in mediaeval Lombard Street was William de la Pole, father of Michael, Earl of Suffolk. He was king's merchant or factor to Edward III., and in <datestruct value="1338--"><year reg="1338">1338</year></datestruct>, at Antwerp, lent that warlike and extravagant monarch a sum equivalent to <measure value="400000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="400000">400,000</num></measure> of our current money. He received several munificent grants of Crown land, and was created chief baron of the exchequer and a knight banneret. He is always styled in public instruments <QUOTE lang=la>dilectus mercator et valectus noster.</QUOTE> His son Michael, who died at the siege of Harfleur in <datestruct value="1415--"><year reg="1415">1415</year></datestruct>, succeeded to his father's public duties and his house in Lombard Street, near Birchin Lane. Michael's son fell at Agincourt. The last De la Pole was beheaded during the wars of the Roses.
<p>About the date <datestruct value="1559"><year reg="1559">1559</year></datestruct>, when Gresham was honoured by being sent as English ambassador to the court of the Duchess of Parma, he resided in Lombard Street. His shop (about the present No. <num value="18">18</num>) was distinguished by his father's crest --viz., a grasshopper. The original sign was seen by Pennant; and Mr. Burgon assures us that it continued in existence as late as <datestruct value="1795"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>, being removed or stolen on the erection of the present <pb id="p.525" n="525"> building. Gresham was not only a mercer and merchant adventurer, but a banker--a term which in those days of <num value="10">10</num> or <num value="12">12</num> per cent. interest meant also, <QUOTE>a usurer, a pawnbroker, a money scrivener, a goldsmith, and a dealer in bullion</QUOTE> (Burgon). After, his knighthood, Gresham seems to have thought it undignified to reside at his shop, so left it to his apprentice, and removed to Bishopsgate, where he built Gresham House. It was a vulgar tradition of Elizabeth's time, according to Lodge, that Gresham was a foundling, and that an old woman who found him was attracted to the spot by the increased chirping of the grasshoppers. This story was invented, no doubt, to account for his crest.
<p>During the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="2">two</num> years of Gresham's acting as the king's factor, he posted from Antwerp no fewer than <num value="40">forty</num> times. Between the <datestruct VALUE="1552-03-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct>, and the <datestruct value="07-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct> his payments amounted to <measure value="106301l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="106301">106,301</num></measure> <measure value="4s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="4">4</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure>; his travelling expenses for riding in and out <num value="8">eight</num> times, <measure value="102l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="102">102</num></measure> <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure>, including a supper and a banquet to the Schetz and the Fuggers, the great banks with whom he had to transact business, <num value="26">26</num> being equal, Mr. Burgon calculates, to <num value="250">250</num> of the present value of money. he last-named feast must have been <num value="1">one</num> of great magnificence, as the guests appear to have been not more than <num value="20">twenty</num>. On such occasions Gresham deemed it policy to <QUOTE>make as good chere as he could.</QUOTE>
<p>He was living in Lombard Street, no doubt, at that eventful day when, being at the house of Mr. John Byvers, alderman, he promised that <QUOTE>within <num value="1">one</num> month after the founding of the Burse he would make over the whole of the profits, in equal moities, to the City and the Mercers' Company, in case he should die childless ;</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>for the sewer performance of the premysses, the said Sir Thomas, in the presens of the persons afore named, did give his house to Sir William Garrard, and drank a carouse to Thomas Rowe.</QUOTE> This mirthful affair was considered of so much importance as to be entered on the books of the Corporation, solemnly commencing with the words, <QUOTE>Be it remembered, that the <datestruct value="02-6"><day reg="6">sixth</day> day of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, in Anno Domini <datestruct value="1565--"><year reg="1565">1565</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE> &amp;c.
<p>Greshan's wealth was made chiefly by trade with Antwerp. <QUOTE>The exports from Antwerp,</QUOTE> says Burgon, <QUOTE>at that time consisted of jewels and precious stones, bullion, quicksilver, wrought silks, cloth of gold and silver, gold and silver thread, camblets, grograms, spices, drugs, sugar, cotton, cummin, galls, linen, serges, tapestry, madder, hops in great quantities, glass, salt-fish, small wares (or, as they were then called, merceries), made of metal and other materials, to a considerable amount; arms, ammunition, and household furniture. From England Antwerp imported immense quantities of fine and coarse woollen goods, as canvas, frieze, &amp;c., the finest wool, excellent saffron in small quantities, a great quantity of lead and tin, sheep and rabbit-skins, together with other kinds of peltry and leather; beer, cheese, and other provisions in great quantities, also Malmsey wines, which the English at that time obtained from Candia. Cloth was, however, by far the most important article of traffic between the <num value="2">two</num> countries. The annual importation into Antwerp about the year <datestruct value="1568"><year reg="1568">1568</year></datestruct>, including every description of cloth, was estimated at more than <num value="200000">200,000</num> pieces, amounting in value to upwards of <num value="4000000">4,000,000</num> escus d&lsquo;or, or about <measure value="1200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1200000">1,200,000</num></measure> sterling.</QUOTE>

<p> <QUOTE>I have,</QUOTE> says <QUOTE>Aleph,</QUOTE> in the <title>City Press</title>, <QUOTE>a vivid recollection of Lombard Street in <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>. More than half a century has rolled away since then, yet there, sharply and clearly defined, before the eye of memory, stand the phantom shadows of the past. I walked through the street a few weeks ago. It is changed in many particulars; yet enough remains to identify it with the tortuous, dark vista of lofty houses which I remember so well. Then there were no pretentious, stucco-faced banks or offices; the whole wall-surface was of smoke-blacked brick; its colour seemed to imitate the mud in the road, and as coach, or wagon, or mail-cart toiled or rattled along, the basement storeys were bespattered freely from the gutters. <pb id="p.526" n="526"> The glories of gas were yet to be. After <num value="3">three</num> o'clock p.m. miserable oil lamps tried to enliven the foggy street with their  <Q>ineffectual light,</Q>  while through dingy, greenish squares of glass you might observe tall tallow candles dimly disclosing the mysteries of bank or counting-house. Passengers needed to walk with extreme caution; if you lingered on the pavement, woe to your corns; if you sought to cross the road, you had to beware of the flying postmen or the letter-bag express. As <num value="6">six</num> o'clock drew near, every court, alley, and blind thoroughfare in the neighbourhood echoed to the incessant din of letter-bells. Men, women, and children were hurrying to the chief office, while the fiery-red battalion of postmen, as they neared the same point, were apparently well pleased to balk the diligence of the public, anxious to spare their coppers. The mother post-office for the United Kingdom and the Colonies was then in Lombard Street, and folks thought it was a model establishment. Such armies of clerks, such sacks of letters, and countless consignments of newspapers! How could those hard-worked officials ever get through their work? The entrance, barring paint and stucco, remains exactly as it was <num value="50">fifty</num> years ago. What crowds used to besiege it! What a strange confusion of news-boys! The struggling public, with late letters; the bustling redcoats, with their leather bags, a scene of anxious life and interest seldom exceeded. And now the letter-boxes are all closed; you weary your knuckles in vain against the sliding door in the wall. No response. Every hand within is fully occupied in letter-sorting for the mails; they must be freighted in less than half an hour. Yet, on payment of a--shilling for each, letters were received till <datestruct value="10"><year reg="10">ten</year></datestruct> minutes to <num value="8">eight</num>, and not unfrequently a post-chaise, with the horses in a positive lather, tore into the street, just in time to forward some important despatch. Hark! The horn! the horn! The mail-guards are the soloists, and very pleasant music they discourse; not a few of them are firstrate performers. A long train of gaily got-up coaches, remarkable for their light weight, horsed by splendid-looking animals, impatient at the curb, and eager to commence their journey of <num value="10">ten</num> miles (at least) an hour; stout  <Q>gents,</Q>  in heavy coats, buttoned to the throat, esconce themselves in  <Q>reserved seats.</Q>  Commercial men contest the right of a seat with the guard or coachman; some careful mother helps her pale, timid daughter up the steps; while a fat old lady already occupies <num value="2">two</num>-thirds of the seat-what will be done? Bags of epistles innumerable stuff the boots; formidable bales of the daily journals are trampled small by the guard's heels. The clock will strike in less than <num value="5">five</num> minutes; the clamour deepens, the hubbub seems increasing; but ere the last <num value="60">sixty</num> seconds expire, a sharp winding of warning bugles begins. Coachee flourishes his whip, greys and chestnuts prepare for a run, the reins move, but very gently, there is a parting crack from the whipcord, and the brilliant cavalcade is gone--<foreign lang=la>exeunt omnes!</foreign> Lombard Street is a different place now, far more imposing, though still narrow and dark; the clean--swept roadway is paved with wood, cabs pass noiselessly--a capital thing, only take care you are not run over. Most of the banks and assurance offices have been converted into stone.</QUOTE>

<p> <QUOTE>I am sorry (he said) to be obliged to such a presumption as to name my family in the same leaf with your lordship's; but my father had the honour in <num value="1">one</num> instance to resemble you, for he was a younger brother.

How sincerely glad should I be to pay to that young nobleman's memory the debt I owed to his friendship, whose early death deprived your family of as much wit and honour as he left behind him in any branch of it. But as to my father, I could assure you, my lord, that he was no mechanic (neither a hatter, nor, which might please your lordship yet better, a cobbler), but, in truth, of a very tolerable family, and my mother of an ancient <num value="1">one</num>, as well born and educated as that lady whom your lordship made use of to educate your own children, whose merit, beauty, and vivacity (if transmitted to your posterity) will be a better present than even the noble blood they derive from you.

<p>The house of Pope's father was afterwards occupied by the well-known chemists, Allen, Hanbury, and Barry, a descendant of which firm still occupies it. Mr. William Allen was the son of a Quaker silk manufacturer in Spitalfields. He became chemical lecturer at Guy's Hospital, and an eminent experimentalist-discovering, among other things, the proportion of carbon in carbonic acid, and proving that the diamond was pure carbon. He was mainly instrumental in founding the Pharmaceutical Society, and distinguished himself by his zeal against slavery, and his interest in all benevolent objects. He died in <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>, at Lindfield, in Sussex, where he had founded agricultural schools of a thoroughly practical kind.
<p>The
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.527.1">church of St. Edmund King and Martyr</lemma>
(and St. Nicholas Acons), on the north side of Lombard Street, stands on the site of the old Grass Market. The only remarkable monument is that of Dr. Jeremiah Mills, who died in <datestruct value="1784--"><year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct>, and had been President of the Society of Antiquaries many years. The local authorities have, with great good sense, written the duplex name of this church in clear letters over the chief entrance.
<p>The date of the <num value="1">first</num> building of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.527.2">St. Mary Woolnoth of the Nativity, in Lombard Street</lemma> seems to be very doubtful; nor does Stow help us to the origin of the name. By some antiquaries it has been suggested that the church was so called from being beneath or nigh to the wool staple. Mr. Gwilt suggests that it may have been called <QUOTE>Wool-nough,</QUOTE> in order to distinguish it from the other church of St. Mary, where the wool-beam actually stood.
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> rector mentioned by, Newcourt was John de Norton, presented previous to <datestruct value="1368--"><year reg="1368">1368</year></datestruct>. Sir Martin Bowes had the presentation of this church given him by Henry V., it having anciently belonged to the convent of St. Helen's, Bishopsgate. From the Bowes's the presentation passed to the Goldsmiths' Company. Sir Martin Bowes was buried here, and so were many of the Houblons, a great mercantile family, on <num value="1">one</num> of whom Pepys wrote an epitaph. Munday particularly mentions that the wills of several benefactors of St. Mary's were carefully preserved and exhibited in the church. Strype also mentions a monument to Sir William Phipps, that lucky speculator who, in <datestruct value="1687--"><year reg="1687">1687</year></datestruct>, extracted <num value="300000">300,000</num> from the wreck of a Spanish plate-vessel off the Bahama bank. Simon Eyre, the old founder of Leadenhall Market, was buried in this church in <datestruct value="1549--"><year reg="1549">1549</year></datestruct>.
<p>Sir Hugh Brice, goldsmith and mayor, governor of the Mint in the reign of Henry VII., built or rebuilt part of the church, and raised a steeple. he church was almost totally destroyed in the Great Fire, and repaired by Wren. Sir Robert Viner, the famous goldsmith, contributed largely towards the rebuilding, <QUOTE>a memorial whereof,</QUOTE> says Strype, <QUOTE>are the vines that adorn and spread about that part of the church that fronts his house and the street; insomuch, that the church was used to be called Sir Robert Viner's church.</QUOTE> Wren's repairs having proved ineffectual, the church was rebuilt in <datestruct value="1727--"><year reg="1727">1727</year></datestruct>. The workmen, <num value="20">twenty</num> feet under the ruins of the steeple, discovered bones, tusks, Roman coins, and a vast number of broken Roman pottery. It is generally thought by antiquaries that a temple dedicated to Concord once stood here. Hawksmoor, the architect of St. Mary Woolnoth was born the year of the Great Fire, and died in <datestruct value="1736--"><year reg="1736">1736</year></datestruct>. He acted as Wren's deputy during the erection of the Hospitals at Chelsea and Greenwich, and also in the building of most of the City churches. The principal works of his own design are Christ Church, Spitalfields, St. Anne's Limehouse, and St. George's, Bloomsbury. Mr. J. Godwin, an excellent authority, calls St. Mary Woolnoth <QUOTE><num value="1">one</num> of the most striking and original, although not the most beautiful, churches in the metropolis.</QUOTE>
<p>On the north side of the communion-table is a plain tablet in memory of that excellent man, the Rev. John Newton, who was curate of Olney, Bucks, for <num value="16">sixteen</num> years, and rector of the united parishes of St. Mary Woolnoth and St. Mary Woolchurch <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> years. He died on the <datestruct VALUE="1807-12-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="82">eighty-two</num> years, and was buried in a vault in this church.
<p>On the stone is the following inscription, full of Christian humility:--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote>John Newton, clerk, once an infidel and libertine, a servant of slaves in Africa, was, by the rich mercy of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, preserved, restored, pardoned, and appointed to preach the faith he had long laboured to destroy.</QUOTE>

<p>Newton's father was master of a merchant-ship, and Newton's youth was spent in prosecuting the African slave-trade, a career of which he afterwards bitterly repented. He is best known as the writer  (in conjunction with the poet Cowper) of the
<title>Olney Hymns.</title>

<p>The exterior of this church is praised by competent authorities for its boldness and originality, though some critic says that the details are ponderous enough for a fortress or a prison. The elongated tower, from the arrangement of the <pb id="p.528" n="528"> small chimney-like turrets at the top, has the appearance of being <num value="2">two</num> towers united. Dallaway calls it an imitation of St. Sulpice, at Paris; but unfortunately Servandoni built St. Sulpice some time after St. Mary Woolnoth was completed. Mr. Godwin seems to think Hawksmoor followed Vanbrugh's manner in the heaviness of his design.
<p>St. Clement's Church, Clement's Lane, Lombard Street, sometimes called St. Clement's, Eastcheap, is noted by Newcourt as existing as early as <datestruct value="1309"><year reg="1309">1309</year></datestruct>. The rectory belonged to Westminster Abbey, but was given by Queen Mary to the Bishop of London and his successors for ever. After the Great Fire, when the church was destroyed, the parish of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.528.1">St. Martin Orgar</lemma> was united to that of St. Clement's.

<p>In digging a new sewer in Lombard Street a few years ago (says Pennant, writing in <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>), the remains of a Roman road were discovered, with numbers of coins, and several antique curiosities, some of great elegance. The beds through which the workmen sunk were <num value="4">four</num>. The <num value="1">first</num> consisted of factitious earth, about <num value="13">thirteen</num> feet <num value="6">six</num> inches thick, all accumulated since the desertion of the ancient street: the <num value="2">second</num> of brick, <num value="2">two</num> feet <pb id="p.530" n="530"> thick, the ruins of the buildings; the <num value="3">third</num> of ashes, only <num value="3">three</num> inches; the <num value="4">fourth</num> of Roman pavement, both common and tessellated, over which the coins and other antiquities were discovered. Beneath that was the original soil. The predominant articles were earthenware, and several were ornamented in the most elegant manner. A vase of red earth had on its surface a representation of a fight of men, some on horseback, others on foot; or perhaps a show of gladiators, as they all fought in pairs, and many of them naked. The combatants were armed with falchions and small round shields, in the manner of the Thracians, the most esteemed of the gladiators. Some had spears, and others a kind of mace. A beautiful running foliage encompassed the bottom of this vessel. On the fragment of another were several figures. Among them appears Pan with his <foreign lang=la>pedum</foreign>, or crook; and near to him <num value="1">one</num> of the <foreign lang=la>lascivi Satyri</foreign>, both in beautiful skipping attitudes. On the same piece are <num value="2">two</num> tripods; round each is a serpent regularly twisted, and bringing its head over a bowl which fills the top. These seem (by the serpent) to have been dedicated to Apollo, who, as well as his son Aesculapius, presided over medicine. On the top of <num value="1">one</num> of the tripods stands a man infull armour. Might not this vessel have been votive, made by order of a soldier restored to health by favour of the god, and to his active powers and enjoyment of rural pleasures, typified under the form of Pan and his nimble attendants? A plant extends along part of another compartment, possibly allusive to their medical virtues; and, to show that Bacchus was not forgotten, beneath lies a <hi rend=italics>thyrsus</hi> with a double head.
<p>On another bowl was a free pattern of foliage. On others, or fragments, were objects of the chase, such as hares, part of a deer, and a boar, with human figures, dogs, and horses; all these pieces prettily ornamented. There were, besides, some beads, made of earthenware, of the same form as those called the <hi rend=italics>ovum anguinum</hi>, and, by the Welsh,
 <hi rend=italics>glain naidr</hi>; and numbers of coins in gold, silver, and brass, of Claudius, Nero, Galba, and other emperors down to Constantine.

<p>The pulpit and sounding-board are of oak, and the font has a cover of the same material, presenting carved figures of the <num value="4">four</num> Evangelists within niches. n the south side of the church is an elaborate monument of marble, part of which is gilt, consisting of twisted columns supporting a circular pediment, drapery, cherubim, &amp;c., to Mr. Edward herwood, who died <datestruct VALUE="1690-01-5"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=5>5th</day>, <year reg=1690>1690</year></datestruct>; and near it is a <num value="2">second</num>, in memory of Sir Patience Ward, Knt., Alderman, and Lord Mayor of London in <datestruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></datestruct>.

The east end of the church is in Abchurch Lane, and the south side faces an open paved space, divided from the lane by posts. This was formerly enclosed as a burial-ground, but was thrown open for the convenience of the neighbourhood.
<p>The present church was completed from the designs of Sir Christopher Wren in <datestruct value="1686--"><year reg="1686">1686</year></datestruct>. In the interior it is nearly square, being about <num value="65">sixty-five</num> feet long, and <num value="60">sixty</num> feet wide. The walls are plain, having windows in the south side and at the east end to light the church. The area of the church is covered by a large and handsome cupola, supported on a modillion cornice, and adorned with paintings which were executed by Sir James Thornhill; and in the lower part of this also are introduced other lights. <QUOTE>The altar-piece,</QUOTE> says Mr. G. Godwin, <QUOTE>presents <num value="4">four</num> Corinthian columns, with entablature and pediment, grained to imitate oak, and has a carved figure of a pelican over the centre compartment. It is further adorned by a number of carved festoons of fruit and flowers, which are so exquisitely executed, that if they were a <num value="100">hundred</num> miles distant, we will venture to say they would have many admiring visitants from London. These carvings, by Grinling Gibbons, were originally painted after natures by Sir James. They were afterwards covered with white paint, and at this time they are, in common with the rest of the screen, of the colour of oak. Fortunately, however, these proceedings, which must have tended to fill up the more delicately carved parts, and to destroy the original sharpness of the lines, have not materially injured their general effect.</QUOTE> <pb id="p.531" n="531">

<P>IN Threadneedle Street we stand in the centre of Roman London. In <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct> a tesselated pavement, now in the British Museum, was found at Lothbury. The Exchange stands, as we have already mentioned, on a mine of Roman remains. In <datestruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></datestruct>-<num value="41">41</num> tesselated pavements were found, about <num value="12">twelve</num> or <num value="14">fourteen</num> feet deep, beneath the old French Protestant Church, with coins of Agrippa, Claudius, Domitian, Marcus Aurelius, and the Constantines, together with fragments of frescoes, and much charcoal and charred barley. These pavements are also preserved in the British Museum. In <datestruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></datestruct>, in excavating the site of the church of St. Benet Fink, there was found a large deposit of Roman
 <hi rend=italics>debris</hi>, consisting of Roman tiles, glass, and fragments of black, pale, and red Samian pottery.
<p>The church of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.531.5">St. Benet Fink</lemma>, of which a representation is given at page <num value="468">468</num>, was so called from <num value="1">one</num> Robert Finck, or Finch, who built a previous church on the same site (destroyed by the Fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>). It was completed by Sir Christopher Wren, in <datestruct value="1673--"><year reg="1673">1673</year></datestruct>, at the expense of <measure value="4130l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4130">4,130</num></measure>, but was taken down in <datestruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct>. The tower was square, surmounted by a cupola of <num value="4">four</num> sides, with a small turret on the top. There was a large recessed doorwayon the north side, of very good design.
<p>The arrangement of the body of the church was very peculiar, we may say unique; and although far from beautiful, afforded a striking instance of Wren's wonderful skill. The plan of the church was a decagon, within which <num value="6">six</num> composite columns in the centre supported <num value="6">six</num> semi-circular vaults. Wren's power of arranging a plan to suit the site was shown in numerous buildings, but in none more forcibly than in this small church.
<p> <QUOTE>St. Benedict's,</QUOTE> says Maitland, <QUOTE>is vulgarly Bennet Fink. Though this church is at present a donative, it was anciently a rectory, in the gift of the noble family of Nevil, who probably conferred the name upon the neighbouring hospital of St. Anthony.</QUOTE>
<p>Newcourt, who lived near St. Benet Fink, says the monks of the Order of St. Anthony hard by were so importunate in their requests for alms that they would threaten those who refused them with <QUOTE>St. Anthony's fire;</QUOTE> and that timid people were in the habit of presenting them with fat pigs, in order to retain their good-will. Their pigs thus became numerous, and, as they were allowed to roam about for food, led to the proverb, <QUOTE>He will follow you like a St. Anthony's pig.</QUOTE> Stow accounts for the number of these pigs in another way, by saying that when pIgs were seized in the markets by the City officers, as ill-fed or unwholesome, the monks took possession of them, and tying a bell about their neck, allowed them to stroll about on the dunghills, until they became fit for food, when they were claimed for the convent.
<p>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.531.6">The Merchant Taylors, whose hall</lemma> is very appropriately situated in Threadneedle Street, had their <num value="1">first</num> licence as <QUOTE>Linen Armourers</QUOTE> granted by Edward I. Their <num value="1">first</num> master, Henry de Ryall, was called their <QUOTE>pilgrim,</QUOTE> as <num value="1">one</num> that travelled for the whole company, and their wardens <QUOTE>purveyors of dress.</QUOTE> Their <num value="1">first</num> charter is dated i Edward III. Richard II. confirmed his grandfather's grants. From Henry IV. they obtained a confirmatory charter by the name of the <QUOTE>Master and Wardens of the Fraternity of St. John the Baptist of London.</QUOTE> Henry VI. gave them the right of search and correction of abuses. The society was incorporated in the reign of Edward IV., who gave them arms; and Henry VII., being a member of the Company, for their greater honour transformed them from Tailors and Linen Armourers to Merchant Taylors, giving them their present acting charter, which afterwards received the confirmation and <foreign lang=la>inspeximus</foreign> of <num value="5">five</num> sovereigns --Henry VIII., Edward VI., Philip and Mary, Elizabeth, and James I.
<p>There is no doubt (says Herbert) that Merchant Taylors were originally <foreign lang=la>bona fide</foreign> cutters-out and makers--up of clothes, or dealers in and importers of cloth, having tenter-grounds in Moorfields. The ancient London tailors made both men's and women's apparel, also soldiers' quilted surcoats, the padded lining of armour, and probably the trappings of war-horses. In the <num value="27">27th</num> year of Edward III. the Taylors contributed <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> towards the French wars, and in <datestruct value="1377--"><year reg="1377">1377</year></datestruct> they sent <num value="6">six</num> members to the Common Council, a number equalling (says Herbert) the largest guilds, and they were reckoned <pb id="p.532" n="532"> the <num value="7">seventh</num> company in precedence. In <datestruct value="1483--"><year reg="1483">1483</year></datestruct> we find the Merchant Taylors and Skinners disputing for precedence. The Lord Mayor decided they should take precedence alternately; and, further, most wisely and worshipfully decreed that each Company should dine in the other's hall twice a year, on the vigil of Corpus Christi and the feast of St. John Baptist--a laudable custom, which soon restored concord. In <datestruct value="1571--"><year reg="1571">1571</year></datestruct> there is a precept from the Mayor ordering that <num value="10">ten</num> men of this Company and <num value="10">ten</num> men of the Vintners' should ward each of the City gates every <num value="10">tenth</num> day. In <datestruct value="1579--"><year reg="1579">1579</year></datestruct> the Company was required to provide and train <num value="200">200</num> men for arms. In <datestruct value="1586--"><year reg="1586">1586</year></datestruct> the master and wardens are threatened by the Mayor for not making the provision of gunpowder required of all the London companies. In <datestruct value="1588--"><year reg="1588">1588</year></datestruct> the Company had to furnish <num value="35">thirty-five</num> armed men, as its quota for the Queen's service against the dreaded Spanish Armada.
<p>In <datestruct value="1592--"><year reg="1592">1592</year></datestruct> an interesting entry records Stow (a tailor and member of the Company) presenting his famous <title>Annals</title> to the house, and receiving in consequence an annuity of <num value="4">4</num> per annum, eventually raised to <num value="10">10</num>. The Company afterwards restored John Stow's monument in the Church of St. Andrew Undershaft. Speed, also a tailor and member of the Company, on the same principle, seems to have presented the society with valuable maps, for which, in <datestruct value="1600--"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct>, curtains were provided. In <datestruct value="1594--"><year reg="1594">1594</year></datestruct> the Company subscribed <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure> towards a pest-house, the plague then raging in the City, and the same year contributed <measure value="296l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="296">296</num></measure> <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> towards <num value="6">six</num> ships and a pinnace fitted out for her Majesty's service.
<p>In <datestruct value="1603--"><year reg="1603">1603</year></datestruct> the Company contributed <num value="234">234</num> towards the <measure value="2500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2500">2,500</num></measure> required from the London companies to welcome James I. and his Danish queen to England. <num value="6">Six</num> triumphal arches were erected between Fenchurch Street and Temple Bar, that in Fleet Street being <num value="90">ninety</num> feet high and <num value="50">fifty</num> broad. Decker and Ben Jonson furnished the speeches and songs for this pageant. <datestruct VALUE="1607-06-7"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=7>7</day>, <year reg=1607>1607</year></datestruct>, was <num value="1">one</num> of the grandest days the Company has ever known; for James I. and his son, Prince Henry, dined with the Merchant Taylors. It had been at <num value="1">first</num> proposed to train some boys of Merchant Taylors' School to welcome the king, but Ben Jonson was finally invited to write an entertainment. The king and prince dined separately. The master presented the king with a purse of <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>. <QUOTE>Richard Langley shewed him a role, wherein was registered the names of seaven kinges, <num value="1">one</num> queene, seventeene princes and dukes, <num value="2">two</num> dutchesses, <num value="1">one</num> archbishoppe, <num value="1">one</num> and thirtie earles, <num value="5">five</num> countesses, <num value="1">one</num> viscount, fourteene byshoppes, sixtie and sixe barons, <num value="2">two</num> ladies, seaven abbots, seaven priors, and <num value="1">one</num> sub-prior, omitting a great number of knights, esquires, &amp;c., who had been free of that companie.</QUOTE> The prince was then made a freeman, and put on the garland..

<p>The king seems at this time to have scarcely recovered the alarm of the Gunpowder Plot; for the entries in the Company's books show that there was great searching of rooms and inspection of: walls, <QUOTE>to--prevent villanie and danger to His Majestie.</QUOTE> The cost of this feast was more than  <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure>. The king's chamber was made by cutting a hole in the wall of the. hall, and building a small room behind it.
<p>In <datestruct value="1607--"><year reg="1607">1607</year></datestruct> (James I.), before a Company's dinner, the names of the livery were called, and notice taken of the absent. Then prayer was said, every <num value="1">one</num> kneeling, after which the names of benefactors and their <QUOTE>charitable and godly devices</QUOTE> were read, also the ordinances, and the orders for the grammar-school in St. Laurence Pountney. Then followed the dinner, to which were invited the assistants and the ladies, and old masters' wives and wardens' wives, the preacher, the schoolmaster, the wardens' substitutes, and the humble almsmen of the livery. Sometimes, as in <datestruct value="1645--"><year reg="1645">1645</year></datestruct>, the whole livery was invited.
<p>The kindness and charity of the Company are strongly shown in an entry of <datestruct value="05-23"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=23>23</day></datestruct>,--<datestruct value="1610--"><year reg="1610">1610</year></datestruct>, when John Churchman, a past master, received a pension of <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> per annum. With true consideration, they allowed him to wear his bedesman's gown without a badge, and did not require him to appear in the hall with the other pensioners. All that was required was that he should attend Divine service and pray for the prosperity of the Company, and share his house with Roger Silverwood, clerk of the Bachellors' Company. Gifts to the Company seem to have been numerous. Thus we have <pb id="p.533" n="533">

After a sermon at Bow Church, the artillerymen (<num value="128">128</num>) mustered at dinner. Many zealous Protestants, rather than dine with a Popish duke, tore up their tickets or gave them to porters and mechanics; and as the duke returned along Cheapside, the people shouted, <QUOTE>No Pope, no Pope!

<p>In <datestruct value="1696--"><year reg="1696">1696</year></datestruct> the Company ordered a portrait of Mr. Vernon, <num value="1">one</num> of their benefactors, to be hung up in St. Michael's Church, Cornhill. In <datestruct value="1702--"><year reg="1702">1702</year></datestruct> they let their hall and rooms to the East India Company for a meeting; and in <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct> they let a room to the South Sea Company for the same purpose. In <datestruct value="1768--"><year reg="1768">1768</year></datestruct>, when the Lord Mayor visited the King of Denmark, the Company's committee decided, <QUOTE>there should be no breakfast at the hall, <hi rend=italics>nor pipes nor tobacco in the barge</hi> as usual, on Lord Mayor's Day.</QUOTE> Mr. Herbert thinks that this is the last instance of a Lord Mayor sending a precept to a City company, though this is by no means certain. In <datestruct value="1778--"><year reg="1778">1778</year></datestruct>, Mr. Clarkson, an assistant, for having given the Company the picture, still extant, of Henry VII. delivering his charter to the Merchant Taylors, was presented with a silver waiter, value <measure value="25l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="25">25</num></measure>.
<p>For the searching and measuring cloth, the Company kept a <QUOTE>silver yard,</QUOTE> that weighed thirtysix ounces, and was graven with the Company's arms. With this measure they attended Bartholomew Fair yearly, and an annual dinner took place on the occasion. The livery hoods seem finally, in <datestruct value="1568--"><year reg="1568">1568</year></datestruct>, to have settled down to scarlet and puce, the gowns to blue. The Merchant Taylors' Company, though not the <num value="1">first</num> in City precedence, ranks more royal and noble personages amongst its members than any other company. At King James's visit, before mentioned, no fewer than <num value="22">twenty-two</num> earls and lords, besides knights, esquires, and foreign ambassadors, were enrolled. Before <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, the Company had granted the freedom to <num value="10">ten</num> kings, <num value="3">three</num> princes, <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> bishops, <num value="26">twenty-six</num> dukes, <num value="47">forty-seven</num> earls, and <num value="16">sixteen</num> lord mayors. The Company is specially proud of <num value="3">three</num> illustrious members--Sir John Hawkwood, a great leader of Italian Condottieri, who fought for the Dukes of Milan, and was buried with honour in the Duomo at Florence; Sir Ralph Blackwell, the supposed founder of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.533.4">Blackwell Hall</lemma> and <num value="1">one</num> of Hawkwood's companions at arms; and Sir William Fitzwilliam, Lord High Admiral to Henry VIII., and Earl of Southampton. He left to the Merchant Taylors his best standing cup, <QUOTE>in friendly remembrance of him for ever.</QUOTE> They also boast of Sir William Craven, ancestor of the Earls of Craven, who came up to London a poor Yorkshire lad, and was bound apprentice to a draper. His eldest son fought for Gustavus Adolphus, and is supposed to have secretly married the <pb id="p.534" n="534"> unfortunate Queen of Bohemia, whom he had so faithfully served.
<p>The hall in Threadneedle Street originally belonged to a worshipful gentleman named Edmund Crepin. The Company moved there in <datestruct value="1331--"><year reg="1331">1331</year></datestruct> (Edward III.) from the old hall, which was behind the <QUOTE>Red Lion,</QUOTE> in Basing Lane, Cheapside, an executor of the Outwich family leaving them the advowson of St. Martin Outwich, and <num value="17">seventeen</num> shops. The Company built <num value="7">seven</num> almshouses near the hall in the reign of Henry, IV. The original mansion of Crepin probably at this time gave way to a new hall, and to which now, for the <num value="1">first</num> time, were attached the almshouses mentioned. Both these piles of building are shown in the ancient plan of St. Martin Outwich, preserved in the church vestry, and which was taken by William Goodman in <datestruct value="1599--"><year reg="1599">1599</year></datestruct>.

<P>The modern Merchant Taylors' Hall (says Herbert) is a spacious but irregular edifice of brick. The front exhibits an arched portal, consisting of an arched pediment, supported on columns of the Composite order, with an ornamental niche above; in the pediment are the Company's arms. The hall itself is a spacious and handsome apartment, having at the lower end a stately screen of the Corinthian order, and in the upper part a very large mahogany table <num value="30">thirty</num> feet long. The sides of the hall have numerous emblazoned shields of masters' arms, and behind the master's seat are inscribed in golden letters the names of the different sovereigns, dukes, earls, lords spiritual and temporal, &amp;c., who have been free of this community. In the drawing-room are full-length portraits of King William and Queen Mary, and other sovereigns; and in the court and other rooms are half-lengths of Henry VIII. and Charles II., of tolerable execution, besides various other portraits, amongst which are those of Sir Thomas White, Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>, the estimable founder of St. John's. College, Cambridge, and Sir Thomas Rowe, Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1568--"><year reg="1568">1568</year></datestruct>, and Mr. Clarkson's picture of Henry VII. presenting the Company with their incorporation charter. In this painting the king is represented seated on his throne, and delivering the charter to the Master, Wardens, and Court of Assistants of the Company. His attendants are Archbishop Warham, the Chancellor, and Fox, Bishop of Winchester, Lord Privy Seal, on his right hand; and on his left, Robert Willoughby, Lord Broke, then Lord Steward of the Household. In niches are shown the statues of Edward III. and John of Gaunt, the king's ancestors. In the foreground the clerk of the Company is exhibiting the roll with the names of the kings, &amp;c., who were free of this' Company. In the background are represented the banners of the Company and of the City of London. The Yeomen of the Guard, at the entrance of the palace, close the view. On the staircase are likewise pictures of the following Lord Mayors, Merchant Taylors :--Sir William Turner, <datestruct value="1669--"><year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct>, Sir P. Ward, <datestruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></datestruct>; Sir William Pritchard, <datestruct value="1683--"><year reg="1683">1683</year></datestruct>; and Sir John Salter, <datestruct value="1741--"><year reg="1741">1741</year></datestruct>.
<p>The interior of the <QUOTE>New Hall, or Taylors' Inne,</QUOTE> was adorned with costly tapestry, or arras, representing the history of St. John the Baptist. It had a screen, supporting a silver image of that saint in a tabernacle, or, according to an entry of <datestruct value="1512--"><year reg="1512">1512</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>an ymage of St. John gilt, in a tabernacle gilt.</QUOTE> The hall windows were painted with armorial bearings; the floor was regularly strewed with clean rushes; from the ceiling hung silk flags and streamers; and the hall itself was furnished, when needful, with tables on tressels, covered on feast days with splendid table linen, and glittering with plate.
<p>The Merchant Taylors have for their armorial ensigns-Argent, a tent royal between <num value="2">two</num> parliament robes; gules, lined ermine, on a chief azure, a lion of England. Crest--a Holy Lamb, in glory proper. Supporters-<num value="2">two</num> camels, or. Motto

<p>The stained glass windows of the

They differ from the present (granted in <datestruct value="1586--"><year reg="1586">1586</year></datestruct>), the latter having a lion instead of the Holy Lamb (which is in the body of the <num value="1">first</num> arms), and which latter is now their crest.
<p><num value="1">One</num> of the most splendid sights at this hall in the earlier times would have been (says Herbert), of course, when the Company received the high honour of enrolling King Henry VII. amongst their members; and subsequently to which, <QUOTE>he sat openly among them in a gown of crimson velvet on his shoulders,</QUOTE> says Strype, <QUOTE>a <foreign lang=fr>la mode de Londres</foreign>, upon their solemn feast day, in the hall of the said Company.</QUOTE>

This splendid company was guarded by whifflers and billmen, to the number of <num value="4000">4,000</num>, besides pages and footmen, who marched through Broad Street (the residence of the duke their captain). They continued their march through Moorfields, by Finsbury, to Smithfield, where, after having performed their several evolutions, they shot at the target for glory.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.536.2">The Hall of Commerce</lemma>, existing some years ago in Threadneedle Street, was begun in <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct> by Mr. Edward Moxhay, a speculative biscuit-baker, on the site of the old French church. Mr. Moxhay had been a shoemaker, but he suddenly started as a rival to the celebrated Leman, in Gracechurch Street. He was an amateur architect of talent, and it was said at the time, probably unjustly, that the building originated in Moxhay's vexation at the Gresham committee rejecting his design for a new Royal Exchange. He opened his great commercial news-room <num value="2">two</num> years before the Exchange was finished, and while merchants were fretting at the delay, intending to make the hall a mercantile centre, to the annihilation of Lloyd's, the Baltic, Garraway's, the Jerusalem, and the North and South American Coffee-houses. <num value="70000">70,000</num> were laid out. <pb id="p.537" n="537"> There was a grand bas-relief on the front by Mr. Watson, a young sculptor of promise, and there was an inaugurating banquet.

Wool sales were held there, and there was an auction for railway shares. There were also rooms for meetings of creditors and private arbitrations, and rooms for the deposit of deeds.
<p>A describer of Threadneedle Street in <datestruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></datestruct> particularly mentions amongst the few beggars the Creole flower-girls, the decayed ticket-porters, and cripples on go-carts who haunted the neighbourhood, a poor, shrivelled old woman, who sold fruit on a stall at a corner of <num value="1">one</num> of the courts. She. was the wife of Daniel Good, the murderer.
<p>The Baltic Coffee House, in Threadneedle Street, used to be the rendezvous of tallow, oil, hemp, and seed merchants indeed, of all merchants and brokers connected with the Russian trade. There was a time when there was as much gambling in tallow as in Consols, but the breaking down of the Russian monopoly by the increased introduction of South American and Australian tallow has done away with this. Mr. Richard Thornton and Mr. Jeremiah Harman were the <num value="2">two</num> monarchs of the Russian trade <num value="40">forty</num> years ago. The public saleroom was in the upper part of the house. The Baltic was superintended by a committee of management.
<p>That famous free school of the City, St. Anthony's, stood in Threadneedle Street, where the French church afterwards stood, and where the Bank of London now stands. It was originally a Jewish synagogue, granted by Henry V. to the brotherhood of St. Anthony of Vienna. A hospital was afterwards built there for a master, <num value="2">two</num> priests, a schoolmaster, and <num value="12">twelve</num> poor men. The Free School seems to have been built in the reign of Henry VI., who gave <num value="5">five</num> presentations to Eton and <num value="5">five</num> Oxford scholarships, at the rate of <num value="10">ten</num> francs a week each, to the institution. Henry VIII., that arch spoliator, annexed the school to the collegiate church of St. George's, Windsor. The proctors of St. Anthony's used to wander about London collecting <QUOTE>the benevolence of charitable persons towards the building.</QUOTE> The school had great credit in Elizabeth's reign, and was a rival of St. Paul's. That inimitable coxcomb, Laneham, in his description of the great visit of Queen Elizabeth to the Earl of Leicester, at Kenilworth Castle, <datestruct value="1575--"><year reg="1575">1575</year></datestruct>, a book which Sir Walter Scott has largely availed himself of, says- <QUOTE>Yee mervail perchance,</QUOTE> saith he, <QUOTE>to see me so bookish.

<p>In Elizabeth's reign <QUOTE>the Anthony's pigs,</QUOTE> as the <QUOTE>Paul's pigeons</QUOTE> used to call the Threadneedle boys, used to have an annual breaking--up day procession, with streamers, flags, and beating drums, from Mile End to Austin Friars. The French or Walloon church established here by Edward VI. seems, in <datestruct value="1652--"><year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct>, to have been the scene of constant wrangling among the pastors, as to whether their disputes about celebrating holidays should be settled by <QUOTE>colloquies</QUOTE> of the foreign churches in London, or the French churches of all England. At this school were educated the great Sir Thomas More, and that excellent Archbishop of Canterbury, the zealous Whitgift (the friend of Beza, the Reformer), whose only fault seems to have been his persecutions of the Genevese clergy whom Elizabeth disliked.
<p>Next in importance to Lloyd's for the general information afforded to the public, was certainly the North and South American Coffee House (formerly situated in Threadneedle Street), fronting the thoroughfare leading to the entrance of the Royal Exchange. This establishment was the complete centre for American intelligence. There was in this, as in the whole of the leading City coffeehouses, a subscription room devoted to the use of merchants and others frequenting the house, who, by paying an annual sum, had the right of attend- Dance to read the general news of the day, and make reference to the several files of papers, which were from every quarter of the globe. It was here also that <num value="1">first</num> information could be obtained of the arrival and departure of the fleet of steamers, packets, and masters engaged in the commerce of America, whether in relation to the minor ports of Montreal and Quebec, or the larger ones of Boston, Halifax, and New York. The room the subscribers occupied had a separate entrance to that which was common to the frequenters of the eating and drinking part of the house, and was most comfortably and neatly kept, being well, and in some degree elegantly furnished. The heads of the chief American and Continental firms were on the subscription list; and the representatives of Baring's, Rothschild's, and the other large establishments celebrated for their wealth and extensive mercantile operations, attended the rooms as regularly as Change, to see and hear what was going on, and gossip over points of business. <pb id="p.538" n="538">

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.538.1">South Sea House-Arms for Court Room </lemma></NOTE>

<p>At the north-east extremity of Threadneedle Street is the once famous South Sea House. The back, formerly the Excise Office, afterwards the South Sea Company's office, thence called the Old South Sea House, was consumed by fire in <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct>. The building in Threadneedle Street, in which the Company's affairs were formerly transacted, is a magnificent structure of brick and stone, about a quadragle, supported by stone pillars of the Tuscan order, which form a fine piazza. The front looks into Threadneedle Street, the walls being well built and of great thickness. The several offices were admirably disposed; the great hall for sales, the dining-room, galleries, and chambers were equally beautiful and convenient. Under these were capacious arched vaults, to guard what was valuable from the chances of fire.
<p>The
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.538.2">South Sea Company</lemma> was originated by Swift's friend, Harley, Earl of Oxford, in the year <datestruct value="1711"><year reg="1711">1711</year></datestruct>. The new Tory Government was less popular than the Whig <num value="1">one</num> it had displaced, and public credit had fallen. Harley wishing to provide for the discharge of <num value="10">ten</num> millions of the floating debt, guaranteed <num value="6">six</num> per cent. to a company who agreed to take it on themselves. The <measure value="600000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="600000">600,000</num></measure> due for the annual interest was raised by duties on wines, silks, tobacco, &amp;c.; and the monopoly of the trade to the South Seas granted to the ambitious new Company, which was incorporated by Act of Parliament.
<p>To the enthusiastic Company the gold of Mexico and the silver of Peru seemed now obtainable by the ship-load. It was reported that Spain was willing to open <num value="4">four</num> ports in Chili and Peru. The negotiations, however, with Philip V. of Spain led to little. The Company obtained only the privilege of supplying the Spanish colonies with negro slaves for <num value="30">thirty</num> years, and sending an annual vessel to trade; but even of this vessel the Spanish king was to have <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4">fourth</num> of the profits, and a tax of <num value="5">five</num> per cent. on the residue. The <num value="1">first</num> vessel did not sail till <datestruct value="1717"><year reg="1717">1717</year></datestruct>, and the year after a rupture with Spain closed the trade.
<p>In <datestruct value="1717--"><year reg="1717">1717</year></datestruct>, the King alluding to his wish to reduce the National Debt, the South Sea Company at once petitioned Parliament (in rivalry with the Bank),that their capital stock might be increased from <num value="10">ten</num> millions to <num value="12">twelve</num>, and offered to accept <num value="5">five</num>, instead of <num value="6">six</num> per cent. upon the whole amount. Their proposals were accepted.
<p>The success of Law's Mississippi scheme, in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, roused the South Sea directory to emulation. They proposed to liquidate the public debt by reducing the various funds into <num value="1">one</num>. <datestruct VALUE="1720-01-22"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=22>22</day>, <year reg=1720>1720</year></datestruct>, a committee met on the subject. The South Sea Company offered to melt every kind of stock into a single security. The debt amounted to <measure value="30981712l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30981712">30,981,712</num></measure> at <num value="5">five</num> per cent. for <num value="7">seven</num> years, and afterwards at <num value="4">four</num> per cent, for which they would pay <measure value="3500000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3500000">3,500,000</num></measure>. The Government approved of the scheme, but the Bank of England opposed it, and offered <measure value="5000000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="5000000">5,000,000</num></measure> for the privilege. The South Sea shareholders were not to be outdone, and ultimately increased their terms to <measure value="7500000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="7500000">7,500,000</num></measure>. In the end they remained the sole bidders; though some idea prevailed of sharing the advantage between the <num value="2">two</num> companies, till Sir John Blunt exclaimed, <QUOTE>No, sirs, we'll never divide the child!</QUOTE> The preference thus given excited a positive frenzy in town and country. On the <datestruct value="06-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct> their stock rose to <num value="890">890</num>; it quickly reached <num value="1000">1,000</num>, and several of the principal managers were dubbed baronets for their <QUOTE>great services.</QUOTE> Mysterious rumours of vast treasures to be acquired in the South Seas got abroad, and <num value="50">50</num> per cent. was boldly promised.
<p> <QUOTE>The scheme,</QUOTE> says
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.538.3">Smollett</lemma>, <QUOTE>was <num value="1">first</num> projected by Sir John Blount, who had been bred a scrivener, and was possessed of all the cunning, plausibility, and boldness requisite for such an undertaking. He communicated his plan to Mr. Aislabie, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and a Secretary of State. He answered every objection, and the project was adopted.</QUOTE>
<p>Sir Robert Walpole alone opposed the bill in the House, and with clear-sighted sense (though the stock had risen from <num value="130">130</num> to <num value="300">300</num> in <num value="1">one</num> day) denounced <QUOTE>the dangerous practice of stock-jobbing, and the general infatuation, which must,</QUOTE> he said, <QUOTE>end in general ruin.</QUOTE> Rumours of free trade with Spain pushed the shares up to <num value="400">400</num>, and the bill passed the Commons by a majority of <num value="172">172</num> against <num value="55">55</num>. In the other House, <num value="17">17</num> peers were against it, and <num value="83">83</num> for it. Then the madness fairly began. Stars and garters mingled with squabbling Jews, and great ladies pawned their jewels in order to gamble in the Alley. The shares sinking a little, they were revived by lying rumours that Gibraltar and Port Mahon were going to be exchanged for Peruvian sea-ports, so that the Company would be allowed to send out whole fleets of ships.
<p>Government, at last alarmed, began too late to act. On <datestruct value="07-18"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=18>18</day></datestruct> the King published a proclamation denouncing eighteen petitions for letters patent and <num value="86">eighty-six</num> bubble companies, of which the following are samples:--

<P><num value="1">One</num> of the most famous bubbles was <QUOTE>Puckle's Machine Compny,</QUOTE> for discharging round and square cannon-balls and bullets, and making a total revolution in the art of war. <QUOTE>But the most absurd and preposterous of all,</QUOTE> says Charles Mackay, in his <title>History of the Delusion,</title> <QUOTE>and which showed more completely than any other the utter madness of the people, was <num value="1">one</num> started by an unknown adventurer, entitled, <title>A Company for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.</title> Were not the fact stated by scores of credible witnesses, it would be impossible to believe that any person could have been duped by such a project. The man of genius who essayed this bold and successful inroad upon public credulity merely stated in his prospectus that the required capital was <measure value="500000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="500000">500,000</num></measure>, in <num value="5000">5,000</num> shares of <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> each, deposit <measure value="2l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2">2</num></measure> per share. Each subscriber paying his deposit would be entitled to <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> per annum per share. How this immense profit was to be obtained he did not condescend to inform them at the time, but promised that in a month full particulars should be duly announced, and a call made for the remaining <measure value="98l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="98">98</num></measure> of the subscription. Next morning, at <num value="9">nine</num> o'clock, this great man opened an office in Cornhill. Crowds of people beset his door; and when he shut up at <num value="3">three</num> o'clock he found that no less than <num value="1000">1,000</num> shares had been subscribed for, and the deposits paid. He was thus in <num value="5">five</num> hours the winner of <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure>. He was philosopher enough to be contented with his venture, and set off the same evening for the Continent. He was never heard of again.</QUOTE>
<p>Another fraud that was very successful was that of the <QUOTE>Globe Permits,</QUOTE> as they were called. They were nothing more than square pieces of playing cards, on which was the impression of a seal, in wax, bearing the sign of the <QUOTE>Globe Tavern,</QUOTE> in the neighbourhood of Exchange Alley, with the inscription of <QUOTE>Sail-cloth Permits.</QUOTE> The possessors enjoyed no other advantage from them than permission to subscribe at some future time to a new sail-cloth manufactory, projected by <num value="1">one</num> who was then known to be a man of fortune, but who was afterwards involved in the peculation and punishment of the South Sea directors. These permits sold for as much as <num value="60">sixty</num> guineas in the Alley.
<p>During the infatuation (says Smollett), luxury, vice, and profligacy increased to a shocking degree; the adventurers, intoxicated by their imaginary wealth, pampered themselves with the rarest dainties and the most costly wines. They purchased the most sumptuous furniture, equipage, and apparel, though with no taste or discernment. Their criminal passions were indulged to a scandalous excess, and their discourse evinced the most disgusting pride, insolence, and ostentation. They affected to scoff at religion and morality, and even to set Heaven at defiance.
<p>A journalist of the time writes: <QUOTE>Our South Sea equipages increase daily; the City ladies buy South Sea jewels, hire South Sea maids, take new country South Sea houses; the gentlemen set up South Sea coaches, and buy South Sea estates. They neither examine the situation, the nature or quality of the soil, or price of the purchase, only the annual rent and title for the rest, they take all by the lump, and pay <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num> years' purchase!</QUOTE>
<p>By the end of May, the whole stock had risen to <num value="550">550</num>. It then, in <num value="4">four</num> days, made a tremendous leap, and rose to <num value="890">890</num>. It was now thought impossible that it could rise higher, and many prudent persons sold out to make sure of their spoil. any of these were noblemen about to accompany the king to Hanover. The buyers were so few on <datestruct value="06-3"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=3>3rd</day></datestruct>, that stock fell at once, like a plummet, from <measure value="890l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="890">890</num></measure> to <num value="640">640</num>. The directors ordering their agents to still buy, confidence was restored, and the stock rose to <num value="750">750</num>. By August, the stock culminated at <num value="1000">1,000</num> per cent., or, as Dr. Mackay observes, <QUOTE>the bubble was then full blown.</QUOTE>
<p>The reaction soon commenced. Many government annuitants complained of the directors' partiality in making out the subscription lists. It was soon reported that Sir John Blunt, the chairman and several directors had sold out. The stock fell all through August, and on <datestruct value="09-2"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=2>2nd</day></datestruct> was quoted at <num value="700">700</num> only. Things grew alarming. The directors, to restore confidence, summoned a <pb id="p.540" n="540"> meeting of the corporation at Merchant Taylors' Hall. Cheapside was blocked by the crowd.
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.540.1">Mr. Secretary Craggs</lemma> urged the necessity of union; and Mr. Hungerford said the Company had done more for the nation than Crown, pulpit, and bench. It had enriched the whole nation. The Duke of Portland gravely expressed his wonder that any <num value="1">one</num> could be dissatisfied. But the public were not to be gulled; that same evening the stock fell to <num value="640">640</num>, and the next day to <num value="540">540</num>. It soon got so low as <num value="400">400</num>. The ebb tide was running fast. <QUOTE>Thousands of families,</QUOTE> wrote Mr. Broderick to Lord Chancellor Middleton, <QUOTE>will be reduced to beggary. The consternation is inexpressible, the rage beyond description.</QUOTE> The Bank was pressed to circulate the South Sea bonds, but as the panic increased they fought off. Several goldsmiths and bankers fled. The Sword Blade Company, the chief cashiers of the South Sea Company, stopped payment. King George returned in haste from Hanover, and Parliament was summoned to meet in December.
<p>In the <num value="1">first</num> debate the enemies of the South Sea Company were most violent. Lord Molesworth said he should be satisfied to see the contrivers of the scheme tied in sacks and thrown into the Thames. Honest Shippen, whom even Walpole could not bribe, looking fiercely in Mr. Secretary

 Craggs' face, said <QUOTE>there were other men in high station who were no less guilty than the directors.</QUOTE> Mr. Craggs, rising in wrath, declared he was ready to give satisfaction to any <num value="1">one</num> in the House, or out of it, and this unparliamentary language he had afterwards to explain away. Ultimately a <num value="2">second</num> committee was appointed, with power to send for persons, papers, and records. The directors were ordered to lay before the house a full account of all their proceedings, and were forbidden to leave the kingdom for a twelvemonth.
<p>Mr. Walpole laid before a committee of the whole house his scheme for the restoration of public credit, which was, in substance, to ingraft <num value="9">nine</num> millions of South Sea stock into the Bank of England, and the same sum into the East India Company, upon certain conditions. The plan was favourably received by the House. After some few objections it was ordered that proposals should be received from the <num value="2">two</num> great corporations. They were both unwilling to lend their aid, and the plan met with a warm but fruitless opposition at the general courts summoned for the purpose of deliberating upon it. They, however, ultimately agreed upon the terms on which they would consent to circulate the South Sea bonds; and their report being presented to the committee, a bill was then brought in, under the superintendence of Mr. <pb id="p.541" n="541"> Walpole, and safely carried through both Houses of Parliament.
<p>In the House of Lords,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.541.1">Lord Stanhope</lemma> said that every farthing possessed by the criminals, whether directors or not, ought to be confiscated, to make good the public losses.
<p>The wrath of the House of Commons soon fell quick and terrible as lightning on <num value="2">two</num> members of the Ministry, Craggs, and Mr. Aislabie, Chancellor of the Exchequer. It was ordered, on the <datestruct value="01-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>, that all South Sea brokers should lay before the House a full account of all stock bought or sold by them to any officers of the Treasury or Exchequer since Michaelmas, <datestruct value="1719--"><year reg="1719">1719</year></datestruct>. Aislabie instantly resigned his office, and absented himself from Parliament, and <num value="5">five</num> of the South Sea directors (including Mr. Gibbon, the grandfather of the historian) were ordered into the custody of the Black Rod.
<p>The next excitement was the flight of Knight, the treasurer of the Company, with all his books and implicating documents, and a reward of <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2,000</num></measure> was offered for his apprehension. The same night
<FIGURE id="Fig.541" n="2000.06.0196"><HEAD>London Stone. (see page <num value="544">544</num>.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 the Commons ordered the doors of the House to be locked, and the keys laid on the table.
<p>General Ross, <num value="1">one</num> of the members of the Select Committee, then informed the House that there had been already discovered a plot of the deepest villany and fraud that Hell had ever contrived to ruin a nation. <num value="4">Four</num> directors, members of the House-i.e., Sir Robert Chaplin, Sir Theodore Janssen, Mr. Sawbridge, and Mr. F. Eyles-were expelled the House, and taken into the custody of the Serjeant-at-Arms. Sir John Blunt, another director, was also taken into custody. This man, mentioned by Pope in his <title>Epistle to Lord Bathurst,</title> had been a scrivener, famed for his religious observances and his horror of avarice. He was examined at the bar of the House of Lords, but refused to criminate himself. The Duke of Wharton, vexed at this prudent silence of the criminal, accused Earl Stanhope of encouraging this taciturnity of the witness. The Earl became so excited in his return speech, that it brought on an apoplectic fit, of which he died the next day, to the great grief of his royal master, George I. The <pb id="p.542" n="542"> Committee of Secrecy stated that in some of the books produced before them, false and fictitious entries had been made; in others there were entries of money, with blanks for the names of the stockholders. There were frequent erasures and alterations, and in some of the books leaves had been torn out. They also found that some books of great importance had been destroyed altogether, and that some had been taken away or secreted. They discovered, moreover, that before the South Sea Act was passed there was an entry in the Company's books of the sum of <measure value="1259325l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1259325">1,259,325</num></measure> upon account of stock stated to have been sold to the amount of <measure value="574500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="574500">574,500</num></measure>. This stock was all fictitious, and had been disposed of with a view to promote the passing of the bill. It was noted as sold on various days, and at various prices, from <num value="150">150</num> to <num value="325">325</num> per cent.
<p>Being surprised to see so large an amount disposed of, at a time when the Company were not empowered to increase their capital, the committee determined to investigate most carefully the whole transaction. The governor, sub-governor, and several directors were brought before them and examined rigidly. They found that at the time these entries were made the Company were not in possession of such a quantity of stock, having in their own right only a small quantity, not exceeding <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure> at the utmost. They further discovered that this amount of stock was to be esteemed as taken or holden by the Company for the benefit of the pretended purchasers, although no mutual agreement was made for its delivery or acceptance at any certain time. No money was paid down, nor any deposit or security whatever given to the Company by the supposed purchasers; so that if the stock had fallen, as might have been expected had the act not passed, they would have sustained no loss. If, on the contrary, the price of stock advanced (as it actually did by the success of the scheme), the difference by the advanced price was to be made good by them. Accordingly, after the passing of the act, the account of stock was made up and adjusted with Mr. Knight, and the pretended purchasers were paid the difference out of the Company's cash. This fictitious stock, which had chiefly been at the disposal of Sir John Blunt, Mr. Gibbon, and Mr. Knight, was distributed among several members of the Government and their connections, by way of bribe, to facilitate the passing of the bill. To the Earl of Sunderland was assigned <measure value="50000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50000">50,000</num></measure> of this stock; to the Duchess of Kendal, <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>; to the Countess of Platen, <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>; to her <num value="2">two</num> nieces, <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>; to Mr. Secretary Craggs, <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure>; to Mr. Charles Stan. hope (<num value="1">one</num> of the Secretaries of the Treasury), <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>; to the Sword Blade Company, <measure value="50000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50000">50,000</num></measure>. It also appeared that Mr. Stanhope had received the enormous sum of <measure value="250000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="250000">250,000</num></measure>, as the difference in the price of some stock, through the hands of Turner, Caswall, and Co., but that his name had been partly erased from their books, and altered to Stangape.
<p>The punishment fell heavy on the chief offenders, who, after all, had only shared in the general lust for gold. Mr. Charles Stanhope, a great gainer, managed to escape by the influence of the Chesterfield family, and the mob threatened vengeance. Aislabie, who had made some <measure value="800000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="800000">800,000</num></measure>, was expelled the House, sent to the Tower, and compelled to devote his estate to the relief of the sufferers. Sir George Caswall was expelled the House, and ordered to refund <measure value="250000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="250000">250,000</num></measure>. The day he went to the Tower, the mob lit bonfires and danced round them for joy. When by a general whip of the Whigs the Earl of Sunderland was acquitted, the mob grew menacing again. That same day the elder Craggs died of apoplexy. The report was that he had poisoned himself, but excitement and the death of a son, <num value="1">one</num> of the secretaries of the Treasury, were the real causes. His enormous fortune of a million and a half was scattered among the sufferers. Eventually the directors were fined <measure value="2014000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2014000">2,014,000</num></measure>, each man being allowed a small modicum of his fortune. Sir John Blunt was only allowed <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure> out of his fortune of <measure value="183000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="183000">183,000</num></measure>; Sir John Fellows was allowed <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> out of <measure value="243000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="243000">243,000</num></measure>; Sir Theodore Janssen, <measure value="50000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50000">50,000</num></measure> out of <measure value="243000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="243000">243,000</num></measure>; Sir John Lambert, <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure> out of <measure value="72000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="72000">72,000</num></measure>. <num value="1">One</num> director, named Gregsley, was treated with especial severity, because he was reported to have once declared he would feed his carriage-horses off gold; another, because years before he had been mixed up with some harmless but unsuccessful speculation. According to Gibbon the historian, it was the Tory directors who were stripped the most unmercifully.
<p> <QUOTE>The next consideration of the Legislature,</QUOTE> says Charles Mackay, <QUOTE>after the punishment of the directors, was to restore public credit. The scheme of Walpole had been found insufficient, and had fallen into disrepute. A computation was made of the whole capital stock of the South Sea Company at the end of the year <datestruct value="1720"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>. It was found to amount to <measure value="3l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3">3</num></measure> <num value="7800000">7,800,000</num>, of which the stock allotted to all the proprietors only reached <measure value="24500000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="24500000">24,500,000</num></measure>. The remainder of <measure value="13300000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="13300000">13,300,000</num></measure> belonged to the Company in their corporate capacity, and was the profit they had made by the national delusion. Upwards of <measure value="8000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="8000000">8,000,000</num></measure> of this was taken from <pb id="p.543" n="543"> the Company, and divided among the proprietors and subscribers generally, making a dividend of about <measure value="33l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="33">33</num></measure> <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> per cent. This was a great relief. It was further ordered that such persons as had borrowed money from the South Sea Company upon stock actually transferred and pledged, at the time of borrowing, to or for the use of the Company, should be free from all demands upon payment of <num value="10">ten</num> per cent. of the sums so borrowed. They had lent about <measure value="11000000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="11000000">11,000,000</num></measure> in this manner, at a time when prices were unnaturally raised; and they now received back <measure value="1100000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="1100000">1,100,000</num></measure>, when prices had sunk to their ordinary level.</QUOTE>
<p>A volume (says another writer) might be collected of anecdotes connected with this fatal speculation. A tradesman at Bath, who had invested his only. remaining fortune in this stock, finding it had fallen from <num value="1000">1,000</num> to <num value="900">900</num>, left Bath with an intention to sell out; on his arrival in London it had fallen to <num value="250">250</num>. He thought the price too low, sanguinely hoped that it would re-ascend, still deferred his purpose, and lost his all.
<p>The Duke of Chandos had embarked <measure value="300000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300000">300,000</num></measure> in this project; the Duke of Newcastle strongly advised his selling the whole, or at least a part, with as little delay as possible; but this salutary advice he delayed to take, confidently anticipating the gain of at least half a million, and through rejecting his friend's counsel, he lost the whole. Some were, however, more fortunate. The guardians of Sir Gregory Page Turner, then a minor, had purchased stock for him very low, and sold it out when it had reached its maximum, to the amount of <measure value="200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200000">200,000</num></measure>. With this large sum Sir Gregory built a fine mansion at Blackheath, and purchased <num value="300">300</num> acres of land for a park. <num value="2">Two</num> maiden sisters, whose stock had accumulated to <measure value="90000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="90000">90,000</num></measure>, sold out when the South Sea stock was at <num value="790">790</num>. The broker whom they employed advised them to re-invest in navy bills, which were at the time at a discount of <num value="25">twenty-five</num> per cent.!; they took his advice, and <num value="2">two</num> years afterwards received their money at par.
<p>Even the poets did not escape. Gay (says Dr. Johnson, in his <title>Lives of the Poets</title>) had a present from young Craggs of some South Sea stock, and once supposed himself to be the master of <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure>. His friends, especially Arbuthnot, persuaded him to sell his share, but he dreamed of dignity and splendour, and could not bear to obstruct his own fortune. He was then importuned to sell as much as would purchase a <num value="100">hundred</num> a year for life, <QUOTE>which,</QUOTE> said Fenton, <QUOTE>will make you sure of a clean shirt and a shoulder of mutton every day.</QUOTE> This counsel was rejected; the profit and principal were both lost, and Gay sunk so low under the calamity that his life for a time became in danger.
<p>Pope, always eager for money, was also dabbling in the scheme, but it is uncertain whether he made money or lost by it. Lady Mary Wortley Montague was a loser. When Sir Isaac Newton was asked when the bubble would break, he said, with all his calculations he had never learned to calculate the madness of the people.
<p>Prior declared, <QUOTE>I am lost in the South Sea. The roaring of the waves and the madness of the people are justly put together. It is all wilder than St. Anthony's dream, and the bagatelle is more solid than anything that has been endeavoured here this year.</QUOTE>
<p>In the full heat of it, the Duchess of Ormond wrote to Swift: <QUOTE>The king adopts the South Sea, and calls it his beloved child; though perhaps, you may say, if he loves it no better than his son, it may not be saying much; but he loves it an much as he loves the Duchess of Kendal, and that is saying a good deal. I wish it may thrive, for some of my friends are deep in it. I wish you were too.</QUOTE>
<p>Swift, cold and stem, escaped the madness, and even denounced in the following verses the insanity that had seized the times:--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><LG type=stanza><L>There is a gulf where thousands fell,
<L>Here all the bold adventurers came;
<L>A narrow sound, though deep as hell--
<L>Change Alley is the dreadful name.</LG><LG>

<L>Subscribers here by thousands float,
<L>And jostle <num value="1">one</num> another down;
<L>Each paddling in his leaky boat,
<L>And here they fish for gold and drown.</LG><LG>

<L>Now buried in the depths below,
<L>Now mounted up to heaven again,
<L>They reel and stagger to and fro,
<L>At their wit's end, like drunken men.</QUOTE>

<p>Budgell, Pope's barking enemy, destroyed him. self after his losses in this South Sea scheme, and a well-known man of the day called <QUOTE>Tom of <num value="10000">Ten Thousand</num></QUOTE> lost his reason.

I <pb id="p.544" n="544"> dare say thou hast often admired its magnificent portals, ever gaping wide, and disclosing to view a grave court, with cloisters and pillars, with few or no traces of goers--in or comers-out--a desolation something like Balclutha's.<NOTE><CIT><QUOTE>I passed by the walls of Balclutha, and they were desolate.</QUOTE><BIBL>(Ossian. )</BIBL></CIT></NOTE> This was once a house of trade--a centre of busy interests.

<p>Cannon Street was originally called Candlewick Street, from the candle-makers who lived there. It afterwards, became a resort of drapers.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.544.2">London Stone</lemma>, the old Roman <foreign lang=la>milliarium</foreign>, or milestone, is now a mere rounded boulder, set in a stone case built into the outer southern wall of the church of St. Swithin, Cannon Street. Camden, in his <title>Britannia,</title> says- <QUOTE>The stone called London Stone, from its situation in the centre of the longest diameter of the City, I take to have been a miliary, like that in the Forum at Rome, from whence all the distances were measured.</QUOTE>
<p>Camden's opinion, that from this stone the Roman roads radiated, and that by it the distances were reckoned, seems now generally received. tow, who thinks that there was some legend of the early Christians connected with it, says : <QUOTE>On the south side of this high street (Candlewick or Cannon Street), near unto the channel, is pitched upright a great stone, called London Stone, fixed in the ground very deep, fastened with bars of iron, and otherwise so strongly set, that if carts do run against it through negligence, the wheels be broken and the stone itself unshaken. The cause why this stone was set there, the time when, or other memory is none.</QUOTE>
<p>Strype describes it in his day as already set in its case. <QUOTE>This stone, before the Fire of London, was much worn away, and, as it were, but a stump remaining. But it is now, for the preservation of it, cased over with a new stone, handsomely wrought, cut hollow underneath, so as the old stone may be seen, the new <num value="1">one</num> being over it, to shelter and defend the old venerable <num value="1">one</num>.</QUOTE>
<p>It stood formerly on the south side of Cannon Street, but was removed to the north, <datestruct VALUE="1742-12-13"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=13>13th</day>, <year reg=1742>1742</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct> it was again removed, as an obstruction, and, but for the praiseworthy interposition

<p>This most interesting relic of Roman London is that very stone which the arch-rebel Jack Cade struck with his bloody sword when he had stormed London Bridge, and <QUOTE>Now is Mortimer lord of this city</QUOTE> were the words he uttered too confidently as he gave the blow. Shakespeare, who perhaps wrote from tradition, makes him strike London Stone with his staff:--

<p>Dryden, too, mentions this stone in a very fine passage of his Fable of the <QUOTE>Cock and the Fox:</QUOTE> --
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><L part=f>The bees in arms

<L>Jack Straw at London Stone, with all his rout,
<L>Struck not the city with so loud a shout.</QUOTE>

<p>Of the old denizens of this neighbourhood in Henry VIII.'s days, Stow gives a very picturesque sketch in the following passage, where he says:-- <QUOTE>The late Earl of Oxford, father to him that now liveth, hath been noted within these <num value="40">forty</num> years to have ridden into this city, and so to his house by London Stone, with <num value="80">eighty</num> gentlemen in a livery of Reading tawny, and chains of gold about their necks, before him, and <num value="100">one hundred</num> tall yeomen in the like livery to follow him, without chains, but all having his cognizance of the blue boar embroidered on their left shoulder.</QUOTE>
<p>A turning from Cannon Street leads us to
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.545.1">Southwark Bridge</lemma>. The cost of this bridge was computed at <num value="300000">300,000</num>, and the annual revenue was estimated at <num value="90000">90,000</num>. Blackfriars Bridge tolls amounted to a large annual sum; and it was supposed Southwark might fairly claim about a <num value="3">third</num> of it. Great stress also was laid on the improvements that would ensue in the miserable streets about Bankside and along the road to the King's Bench. We need scarcely remind our readers that the bridge never answered, and was almost disused till the tolls were removed and it was thrown open to general traffic.
<p> <QUOTE>Southwark Bridge,</QUOTE> says Mr. Timbs, <QUOTE>designed by
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.545.2">John Rennie, F.R.S.</lemma>, was built by a public company, and cost about <measure value="800000l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="800000">800,000</num></measure>. It consists of <num value="3">three</num> cast-iron arches; the centre <num value="240">240</num> feet span, and the <num value="2">two</num> side arches <num value="210">210</num> feet each, about fortytwo feet above the highest spring-tides; the ribs forming, as it were, a series of hollow masses, or
 <foreign lang=fr>voussoirs</foreign>, similar to those of stone, a principle new in the construction of cast-iron bridges, and very successful. The whole of the segmental pieces and the braces are kept in their places by dovetailed sockets and long cast-iron wedges, so that bolts are unnecessary, although they were used during the construction of the bridge to keep the pieces in their places until the wedges had been driven. The spandrels are similarly connected, and upon them rests the roadway, of solid plates of cast iron, joined by iron cement. The piers and abutments are of stone, founded upon timber platforms resting upon piles driven below the bed of the river. The masonry is tied throughout by vertical and horizontal bond-stones, so that the whole rests as <num value="1">one</num> mass in the best position to resist the horizontal thrust. The <num value="1">first</num> stone was laid by Admiral Lord Keith, <datestruct VALUE="1815-05-23"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=23>23rd</day>, <year reg=1815>1815</year></datestruct>, the bill for erecting the bridge having been passed <datestruct VALUE="1811-05-16"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=16>16th</day>, <year reg=1811>1811</year></datestruct>. The iron-work (weight <num value="5700">5,700</num> tons) had been so well put together by the Walkers of Rotherham, the founders, and the masonry by the contractors, Jolliffe and Banks, that, when the work was finished, scarcely any sinking was discernible in the arches. From experiments made to ascertain the expansion and contraction between the extreme range of winter and summer temperature, it was found that the arch rose in the summer about <num value="1">one</num> inch to <num value="1">one</num> and a half inch. The works were commenced in <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, and the bridge was opened by lamp-light, <datestruct VALUE="1819-03-24"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=24>24th</day>, <year reg=1819>1819</year></datestruct>, as the clock of St. Paul's Cathedral tolled midnight. Towards the middle of the western side of the bridge used to be a descent from the pavement to a steam-boat pier.</QUOTE>
<p>Mr. Charles Dickens, in <num value="1">one</num> of the chapters of his <title>Uncommercial Traveller,</title> has sketched; in his most exquisite manner, just such old City churches as we have in Cannon Street and its turnings. The dusty oblivion into which they are sinking, their past glory, their mouldy old tombs-everything he paints with the correctness of Teniers and the finish of Gerard Dow.
<p> <QUOTE>There is,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE><p>a pale heap of books in the corner of my pew, and while the organ, which is hoarse and sleepy, plays in such fashion that I can hear more of the rusty working of the stops than of any music, I look at the books, which are mostly bound in faded baize and stuff. They belonged, in <datestruct value="1754--"><year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct>, to the Dowgate family. And who were they? Jane Comfort must have married young Dowgate, and come into the family that way. Young Dowgate was courting Jane Comfort when he gave her her prayer-book, and recorded the presentation in the fly-leaf. If Jane were fond of young Dowgate, why did she die and leave the book here? Perhaps at the rickety altar, and before the damp Commandments, she, Comfort, <pb id="p.546" n="546"> had taken him, Dowgate, in a flush of youthful hope and joy; and perhaps it had not turned out in the long run as great a success as was expected.
<p>The opening of the service recalls my wandering thoughts. I then find to my astonishment that I have been, and still am, taking a strong kind of invisible snuff up my nose, into my eyes, and down my throat. I wink, sneeze, and cough. The clerk sneezes: the clergyman winks; the unseen organist sneezes and coughs (and probably winks); all our little party wink, sneeze, and cough. The snuff seems to be made of the decay of matting, wood, cloth, stone, iron, earth, and something else. Is the something else the decay of dead citizens in the vaults below? As sure as death it
<FIGURE id="Fig.546" n="2000.06.0197"><HEAD>The <num value="4">Fourth</num> Salters' Hall. (see page <num value="548">548</num>.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 is! Not only in the cold, damp February day, do we cough and sneeze dead citizens, all through the service, but dead citizens have got into the very bellows of the organ, and half-choked the same. We stamp our feet to warm them, and dead citizens arise in heavy clouds. Dead citizens stick upon the walls, and lie pulverised on the sounding-board over the clergyman's head, and when a gust of air comes, tumble down upon him.

<p>In the churches about Mark Lane there was a dry whiff of wheat; and I accidentally struck an airy sample of barley out of an aged hassock in <num value="1">one</num> of them. From Rood Lane to Tower Street, and thereabouts, there was sometimes a <pb id="p.547" n="547"> subtle flavour of wine; sometimes of tea. <num value="1">One</num> church, near Mincing Lane, smelt like a druggist's drawer. Behind the Monument, the service had a flavour of damaged oranges, which, a little further down the river, tempered into herrings, and gradually toned into a cosmopolitan blast of fish. In <num value="1">one</num> church, the exact counterpart Qf the church in the  <Q>Rake's Progress,</Q>  where the hero is being married to the horrible old lady, there was no speciality of atmosphere, until the organ shook a perfume of hides all over us from some adjacent warehouse.
<p>The dark vestries and registries into which I have peeped, and the little hemmed--in churchyards that have echoed to my feet, have left impressions
<FIGURE id="Fig.547" n="2000.06.0198"><HEAD>Cordwainers' Hall. (See Page <num value="550">550</num>.)</HEAD></FIGURE>
 on my memory as distinct and quaint as any it has that way received. In all those dusty registers that the worms are eating, there is not a line but made some hearts leap, or some tears flow, in their day. Still and dry now, still and dry! And the old tree at the window, with no room for its branches, has seen them all out. So with the tomb of the old master of the old company, on which it drips. His son restored it and died, his daughter restored it and died, and then he had been remembered long enough, and the tree took possession of him, and his name cracked out.</QUOTE>

<p>The Salters, who have anchored in Cannon Street, have had at least <num value="4">four</num> halls before the present <num value="1">one</num>. The <num value="1">first</num> was in Bread Street, to be <pb id="p.548" n="548"> near their kinsmen, the Fishmongers, in the old fish market of London, Knightrider Street. It is noticed, apparently, as a new building, in the will of Thomas Beamond, Salter, <datestruct value="1451--"><year reg="1451">1451</year></datestruct>, who devised to <QUOTE>Henry Bell and Robert Bassett, wardens of the fraternity and gild of the Salters, of the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ in the Church of All Saints, of Bread Street, London, and to the brothers and sisters of the same fraternity and gild, and their successors for ever, the land and ground where there was then lately erected a hall called Salters' Hall, and <num value="6">six</num> mansions by him then newly erected upon the same ground, in Bread Street, in the parish of All Saints.</QUOTE> The last named were the Company's almshouses.
<p>This hall was destroyed by fire in <datestruct value="1533--"><year reg="1533">1533</year></datestruct>. The <num value="2">second</num> hall, in Bread Street, had an almshouse adjoining, as Stow tells us, <QUOTE>for poore decayed brethren.</QUOTE> It was destroyed by fire in <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>. This hall was afterwards used by Parliamentary committees. There the means of raising new regiments was discussed, and there, in <datestruct value="1654--"><year reg="1654">1654</year></datestruct>, the judges for a time sat. The <num value="3">third</num> hall (and these records furnish interesting facts to the London topographer) was a mansion of the prior of Tortington (Sussex), near the east end of St. Swithin's Church, London tone. The Salters purchased it, in <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>, of Captain George Smith, and it was then called Oxford House, or Oxford Place. It had been the residence of Maister Stapylton, a wealthy alderman. The house is a marked <num value="1">one</num> in history, as at the back of it, according to Stow, resided those bad guiding ministers of the miser king Henry VII., Empson'and Dudley, who, having cut a door into Oxford House garden, used to meet there, like the <num value="2">two</num> usurers in Quintin Matsys' picture, and suggest war taxes to each other under the leafy limes of the old garden. Sir Ambrose Nicholas and Sir John Hart, both Salters, kept their mayoralties here.
<p>The <num value="4">fourth</num> hall, built after the Great Fire had made clear work of Oxford House, was a small brick building, the entrance opening within an arcade of <num value="3">three</num> arches springing from square fluted pillars. A large garden adjoined it, and next that was the Salters' Hall Meeting. House. he parlour was handsome, and there were a few original portraits. This hall, the clerk's house, with another at the, gate of St. Swithin's Lane, were pulled down and sold in <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>.
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.548.1">The present hall</lemma> was designed by Mr. Henry Carr, and completed in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>.
<p>As a chartered company there is no record of the Salters before the <num value="37">37th</num> year of Edward III., when liberties were granted them. In the <num value="50">50th</num> of Edward III. they sent members to the common council. Richard II. granted them a livery, but they were <num value="1">first</num> incorporated in <datestruct value="1558--"><year reg="1558">1558</year></datestruct> by Elizabeth. Henry VIII. had granted them arms, and Elizabeth a crest and supporters. The arms are:-- Chevron azure and gules, <num value="3">three</num> covered salts, or, springing salt proper. On a helmet and torse, issuing out of a cloud argent, a sinister arm proper, holding a salt as the former. Supporters, <num value="2">two</num> otters argent plattee, gorged with ducal coronets, thereto a chain affixed and reflected, or; motto,
<QUOTE lang=la>Sal sapit Omnia.</QUOTE> <title>A Short Account of the Salters' Company,</title> printed for private distribution, rejects the otters as supporters, in favour,of ounces or small leopards, which latter, it states, have been adopted by the assistants, in the arms put up in their new hall; and it gives the following, <QUOTE>furnished by a London antiquary,</QUOTE> as the Salters' real supporters:--<num value="2">Two</num> ounces sable besante, gorged with crowns and chased gold. The Salters claim to have received <num value="8">eight</num> charters.
<p>The Romans worked salt-pits in England, and salt-works are frequently mentioned in Domesday Book. Rock or fossil salt, says Herbert, was never worked in England till <datestruct value="1670"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>, when it was discovered in Cheshire. The enormous use of salt fish in the Catholic households of the Middle Ages brought wealth to the Salters.
<p>In a pageant of <datestruct value="1591--"><year reg="1591">1591</year></datestruct>, written by the poet Peele, <num value="1">one</num> clad like a sea-nymph presented the Salter mayor (Webb) with a rigged and manned pinnace, as he took barge to go to Westminster.
<p>In the Drapers' pageant of <datestruct value="1684--"><year reg="1684">1684</year></datestruct>, when each of the <num value="12">twelve</num> companies were represented by allegorical figures, the Salters were figured by Salina in a sky-coloured robe and coronation mantle, and crowned with white and yellow roses. Among the citizens nominated by the, common council to attend the mayor as chief butler, at tlie coronation of Richard III., occurs the name of a Salter.
<p>The following bill of fare for <num value="50">fifty</num> people of the Company of Salters, A.D. <datestruct value="1506"><year reg="1506">1506</year></datestruct>, is still preserved:--

<p>In <datestruct VALUE="1866-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1866">1866</year></datestruct>, a mysterious murder took place in Cannon Street. The victim, a widow, named Sarah Millson, was housekeeper on the premises of Messrs. Bevington, leather-sellers. About <num value="9">nine</num> o'clock in the evening, when sitting by the fire in company with another servant, the street bell was heard to ring, on which Millson went down to the door, remarking to her neighbour that <hi rend=italics>hhe</hi>
knew who it was. She did not return, although for an hour this did not excite any suspicion, as she was in the habit of holding conversations at the street door. A little after <num value="10">ten</num> o'clock, the other woman-Elizabeth Lowes-went down, and found Millson dead at the bottom of the stairs, the blood still flowing profusely from a number of deep wounds in the head. Her shoes had been taken off and were lying on a table in the hall, and as there was no blood on them it was presumed this was done before the murder. The housekeeper's keys were also found on the stairs. Opening the door to procure assistance, Lowes observed a woman on the doorstep, screening herself apparently from the rain, which was falling heavily at the time.

<p>A Bill in Parliament being engrossed for the erection of a church for the French Protestants in the churchyard of this parish, after the Great Fire, the parishioners offered reasons to the Parliament against it; declaring that they were not against erecting a church, but only against erecting it in the place mentioned in the Bill; since by the Act for rebuilding the city, the site and churchyard of St. Martin Orgar was directed to be enclosed with a wall, and laid open for a burying-place for the parish.

<p>Watling Street, now laid open by the new street leading to the Mansion House, is probably the oldest street in London. It is part of the old Roman military road that, following an old British forest-track, led from London to Dover, and from Dover to South Wales. The name, according to Leland, is from the Saxon <hi rend=italics>atheling</hi>--a noble street. At the north-west end of it is the church of St. Augustine, anciently styled <foreign lang=la>Ecclesia Sancti Augustini ad Portam</foreign>, from its vicinity to the south-east gate of St. Paul's Cathedral.

<p>The church of St. Antholin, in Watling Street, is the only old church in London dedicated to that monkish saint. The date of its foundation is unknown, but it must be of great antiquity, as it is mentioned by Ralph de Diceto, Dean of St. Paul's at the end of the <num value="12">twelfth</num> century. The church was rebuilt, about the year <datestruct value="1399"><year reg="1399">1399</year></datestruct>, by Sir Thomas Knowles, Mayor of London, who was buried here, and whose odd epitaph Stow notes down:--

<p>St. Antholin's perished in the Great Fire, and the present church was completed by Wren, in the year <datestruct value="1682"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct>, at the expense of about <measure value="5700l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5700">5,700</num></measure>. After <pb id="p.553" n="553"> the fire the parish of St. John Baptist, Watling Street, was annexed to that of St. Antholin, the latter paying <num value="5">five</num>-eighths towards the repairs of the church, the former the remaining <num value="3">three</num>-eighths. The interior of the church is peculiar, being covered with an oval-shaped dome, which is supported on <num value="8">eight</num> columns, which stand on high plinths. The carpentry of the roof, says Mr. Godwin, displays constructive knowledge. The exterior of the building, says the same authority, is of pleasing proportions, and shows great powers of invention. As an apology for adding a Gothic spire to a quasi- Grecian church, Wren has, oddly enough, crowned the spire with a small Composite capital, which looks like the top of a pencil-case. Above this is the vane. The steeple rises to the height of <num value="154">154</num> feet.
<p>The church was rebuilt by John Tate, a mercer, in <datestruct value="1513--"><year reg="1513">1513</year></datestruct>; and Strype mentions the erection in <datestruct value="1623--"><year reg="1623">1623</year></datestruct> of a rich and beautiful gallery with <num value="52">fifty-two</num> compartments, filled with the coats-of-arms of kings and nobles, ending with the blazon of the Elector Palatine.

<p>In the heart of the City, and not far from London Stone, was a house which used to be inhabited by the Lord Mayor or <num value="1">one</num> of the sheriffs, situated so near to the Church of St. Antholin that there was a way out of it into a gallery of the church.

<p>If Stow is correct,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.554.3">St. Mary's Aldermary</lemma>, Watling Street, was originally called Aldermary because it was older than St. Mary's Bow, and, indeed, any other church in London dedicated to the Virgin; but this is improbable.

<P>This quaint appeal seems to have had its effect, for in <datestruct value="1626--"><year reg="1626">1626</year></datestruct> a Mr. William Rodoway left <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="200">200</num></measure> for the rebuilding the steeple; and the same year Mr. Richard Pierson bequeathed <measure value="200bmark" type=currency><num value="200">200</num> marks</measure> on the <pb id="p.555" n="555"> express condition that the new spire should resemble the old <num value="1">one</num> of Keeble's. The old benefactor of St. Mary's was not very well treated, for no monument was erected to him till <datestruct value="1534"><year reg="1534">1534</year></datestruct>, when his son-in-law, William Blount, Lord Mountjoy, laid a stone reverently over him. But in the troubles following the Reformation the monument was cast down, and Sir William Laxton (Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1534--"><year reg="1534">1534</year></datestruct>) buried in place of Keeble. The church was destroyed in the Great Fire, but soon rebuilt by Henry Rogers, Esq., who gave <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5,000</num></measure> for the purpose. An able paper in the records of the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society states that <QUOTE>the tower is evidently of the date of Kebyll's work, as shown by the old <num value="4">four</num>-centre-headed door leading from the tower into the staircase turret, and also by the Caen stone of which this part of the turret is built, which has indications of fire upon its surface. The upper portion of the tower was rebuilt in <datestruct value="1711--"><year reg="1711">1711</year></datestruct>; the intermediate portion is, I think, the work of <datestruct value="1632--"><year reg="1632">1632</year></datestruct>; and if that is admitted, it is curious as an example of construction at that period in an older style than that prevalent and in fashion at the time. The semi-Elizabethan character of the detail of the strings and ornamentation seems to confirm this conclusion, as they are just such as might be looked for in a Gothic work in the time of Charles I. In dealing with the restoration of the church, Wren must have not only followed the style of the burned edifice, but in part employed the old material. The church is of ample dimensions, being a <num value="100">hundred</num> feet long and <num value="63">sixty-three</num> feet broad, and consists of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.555.1">a nave and side aisles. The ceiling is very singular, being an imitation of fan tracery executed in plaster</lemma>. The detail of this is most elaborate, but the design is odd, and, being an imitation of stone construction, the effect is very unsatisfactory. It is probable that the old roof was of wood, and entirely destroyed in the Fire; consequently no record of it remained as a guide in the rebuilding, as was the case with the clustered pillars, which are good and correct in form, and only mongrel in their details. In some of the furniture of the church, such as the pulpit and the carving of the pews, the Gothic style is not followed; and in these, as in the other parts where the great master's genius is left unshackled, we perceive the exquisite taste that guided him, even to the minutest details, in his own peculiar style. The sword-holder in this church is a favourable example of the careful thought which he bestowed upon his decoration. The sword-holder is almost universally found in the City churches. . . . Amongst the gifts to this church is <num value="1">one</num> by Richard Chawcer (supposed by Stowe to be father of the great Geoffrey), who gave his tenement and tavern in the highway, at the corner of Keirion Lane. Richard Chawcer was buried here in <datestruct value="1348--"><year reg="1348">1348</year></datestruct>. After the Fire, the parishes of St. Mary Aldermary and St. Thomas the Apostle were united; and as the advowson of the latter belonged to the cathedral church of St. Paul's, the presentation is now made alternately by the Archbishop of Canterbury and by the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's.</QUOTE>

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.556.1">Gerard's Hall, Basing Lane</lemma>, Bread Street (removed for improvements in <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>), and latterly an hotel, was rebuilt, after the Great Fire, on the site of the house of Sir John Gisors (Pepperer), Mayor in <datestruct value="1245--"><year reg="1245">1245</year></datestruct> (Henry III.). The son of the Mayor was Mayor and Constable of the Tower in <datestruct value="1311--"><year reg="1311">1311</year></datestruct> (Edward II.). This <num value="2">second</num> Gisors seems to have got into trouble from boldly and honestly standing up for the liberties of the citizens, and his troubles began after this manner.
<p>In the troublesome reign of Edward II. it was ordained by Parliament that every city and town in England, according to its ability, should raise and maintain a certain number of soldiers against the Scots, who at that time, by their great depredations, had laid waste all the north of England as far as York and Lancaster. The quota of London to that expedition being <num value="200">200</num> men, it was <num value="5">five</num> times the number that was sent by any other city or town in the kingdom. To meet this requisition the Mayor in council levied a rate on the city, the raising of which was the occasion of continual broils between the magistrates and freemen, which ended in the Jury of Aldermanbury making a presentation before the Justices Itinerant and the Lord Treasurer sitting in the Tower of London, to this effect:-- <QUOTE>That the commonalty of London is, and ought to be, common, and that the citizens are not bound to be taxed without the special command of the king, or without their common consent; that the Mayor of the City, and the custodes in their time, after the common redemption made and paid for the City of London, have come, and by their own authority, without the King's command and Commons' consent, did tax the said City according to their own wills, once and more, and distrained for those taxes, sparing the rich, and oppressing the poor middle sort; not permitting that the arrearages due from the rich be levied, to the disinheriting of the King and the destruction of the City, nor can the Commons know what becomes of the monies levied of such taxes.</QUOTE>
<p>They also complained that the said Mayor and aldermen had taken upon them to turn out of the Common Council men at their pleasure; and that the Mayor and superiors of the City had deposed Walter Henry from acting in the Common Council, because he would not permit the rich to levy tollages upon the poor, till they themselves had paid their arrears of former tollages; upon which Sir John Gisors, some time Lord Mayor, and divers of the principal citizens, were summoned to attend the said justices, and personally to answer to the accusations laid against them; but, being conscious of guilt, they fled from justice, screening themselves under the difficulty of the time.
<p>How long Sir John Gisors remained absent from London does not appear; but probably on the dethronement of Edward II. and accession of Edward III., he might join the prevailing party and return to his mansion, without any dread of molestation from the power of ministers and favourites of the late reign, who were at this period held in universal detestation. Sir John Gisors died, and was buried in Our Lady's Chapel, Christ Church, Faringdon Within (Christ's Hospital).
<p>Later in that century the house became the residence of Sir Henry Picard, Vintner and Lord Mayor, who entertained here, with great splendour, no less distinguished personages than his sovereign,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.556.2">Edward III</lemma>., John King of France, the King of Cyprus, David King of Scotland,
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.556.3">Edward the Black Prince</lemma>, and a large assemblage of the nobility. <QUOTE>And after,</QUOTE> says Stow, <QUOTE>the said Henry Picard kept his hall against all comers whosoever that were willing to play at dice and hazard. In like manner, the Lady Margaret his wife did also keep her chamber to the same effect.</QUOTE> . We are told that on this occasion <QUOTE>the King of Cyprus, playing with Sir Henry Picard in his hall, did win of him <measure value="50bmark" type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> marks</measure>; but Picard, being very skilled in that art, altering his hand, did after win of the same king the same <measure value="50bmark" type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> marks</measure>, and <measure value="50bmark" type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> marks</measure> more; which when the same king began to take in ill part, although he dissembled the same, Sir Henry said unto him,  <Q>My lord and king, be not aggrieved; I court not your gold, but your play; for I have not bid you hither that you might grieve;</Q>  and giving him his money again, plentifully bestowed of his own amongst the retinue.

<p>Gerard Hall contained <num value="1">one</num> of the finest Norman crypts to be found in all London. It was not an ecclesiastical crypt, but the great vaulted warehouse of a Norman merchant's house, and it is especially mentioned by Stow. <pb id="p.557" n="557">
<p> <QUOTE>On the south side of Basing Lane,</QUOTE> says Stow, <QUOTE>is <num value="1">one</num> great house of old time, built upon arched vaults, and with arched gates of stone, brought from Caen, in Normandy. The same is now a common hostrey for receipt of travellers, commonly and corruptly called Gerrarde's Hall, of a giant said to have dwelt there. In the high-roofed hall of this house some time stood a large fir-pole, which reached to the roof thereof, and was said to be <num value="1">one</num> of the staves that Gerrarde the giant used in the wars to run withal. There stood also a ladder of the same length, which (as they say) served to ascend to the top of the staff. Of later years this hall is altered in building, and divers rooms are made in it; notwithstanding the pole is removed to <num value="1">one</num> corner of the room, and the ladder hangs broken upon a wall in the yard. The hostelar of that house said to me,  <Q>the pole lacketh half a foot of <num value="40">forty</num> in length.</Q>  I measured the compass thereof, and found it <num value="15">fifteen</num> inches. Reasons of the pole could the master of; the hostrey give none; but bade me read the great chronicles, for there he had heard of it. I will noW note what myself hath observed concerning that house. I read that John Gisors, Mayor of Londonin <datestruct value="1245--"><year reg="1245">1245</year></datestruct>, was owner thereof, and that Sir John Gisors, Constable of the Tower <datestruct value="1311--"><year reg="1311">1311</year></datestruct>, and divers others of that name and family, since that time owned it. So it-appeareth that this Gisors Hall of late time, by corruption, hath been called Gerrarde's Hall for Gisors' Hall. The pole in the hall might be used of old times (as then the custom was in every parish) to be set up in the summer as a maypole. The ladder served for the decking of the maypole and roof of the hall.</QUOTE> The works of Wilkinson and J. T. Smith contain a careful view of the interior of this crypt.

<p>St. Mary Woolchurch was an old parish church in Walbrook Ward, destroyed in the Great Fire, and not rebuilt.

<p>The parish of St. Stephen is now united to that of St. Bennet Sherehog (Pancras Lane), the church of which was destroyed in the Fire. The cupola of St. Stephen's is supposed by some writers to have been a rehearsal for the dome of St. Paul's. <QUOTE>The interior,</QUOTE> says Mr. Godwin, <QUOTE>is certainly more worthy of admiration in respect of its general arrangement, which displays great skill, than of the details, which are in many respects faulty. The body of the church, which is nearly a parallelogram, is divided into <num value="5">five</num> unequal aisles (the centre being the largest) by <num value="4">four</num> rows of Corinthian columns, within <num value="1">one</num> intercolumniation from the east end. <num value="2">Two</num> columns from each of the <num value="2">two</num> centre rows are omitted, and the area thus formed is covered by an enriched cupola, supported on light arches, which rise from the entablature of the columns. By the distribution of the columns and their entablature, an elegant cruciform arrangement is given to this part of the church. But this is marred in some degree,</QUOTE> says the writer, <QUOTE>by the want of connection which exists between the square area formed by the columns and their entablature and the cupola which covers it. The columns are raised on plinths. The spandrels of the arches bearing the cupola present panels containing shields and foliage of unmeaning form. The pilasters at the chancel end and the brackets on the side wall are also condemned. The windows in the clerestory are mean; the enrichments of the meagre entablature clumsy. The fine cupola is divided into panels ornamented with palm-branches and roses, and is terminated at the apex by a circular lantern-light. The walls of the church are plain, and disfigured,</QUOTE> says Mr. Godwin, <QUOTE>by the introduction of those disagreeable oval openings for light so often used by Wren.</QUOTE>
<p>The picture, by West, of the death of St. Stephen is considered by some persons a work of high character, though to us West seems always the tamest and most insipid of painters.

Of those worthy of notice, the Zitelle, at Venice (by Palladio), is the nearest approximation in regard to size; but it ranks far below our church in point of composition, and still lower in point of effect.
<p> <QUOTE>The interior of St. Stephen's,</QUOTE> says Mr. Timbs, <QUOTE>is <num value="1">one</num> of Wren's finest works, with its exquisitely proportioned Corinthian columns, and great central dome of timber and lead, resting upon a circle of light arches springing from column to column. Its enriched Composite cornice, the shields of the spandrels, and the palm-branches and rosettes of the dome-coffers are very beautiful; and as you enter from the dark vestibule, a halo of dazzling light flashes upon the eye through the central aperture of the cupola. The elliptical openings for light in the side walls are, however, very objectionable. The fittings are of oak; and the altarscreen, organ-case, and gallery have some good carvings, among which are prominent the arms of the Grocers' Company, the patrons of the living, and who gave the handsome wainscoting. The enriched pulpit, its festoons of fruit and flowers, and canopied sounding-board, with angels bearing wreaths, are much admired.

During the repairs, in <datestruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></datestruct>, it is stated that <num value="4000">4,000</num> coffins were found beneath the church, and were covered with brickwork and concrete to prevent the escape of noxious effluvia.

<p>Goldsmith visited the <QUOTE>Boar's Head,</QUOTE> and has left a delightful essay upon his day-dreams there, totally forgetting that the original inn had perished in, the Great Fire. <QUOTE>The character of Falstaff,</QUOTE> says the poet, <QUOTE><p>even with all his faults, gives me more consolation than the most studied efforts of wisdom. I here behold an agreeable old fellow forgetting age, and showing me the way to be young at <num value="65">sixty-five</num>. Surely I am well able to be as merry, though not so comical as he. Is it not in my power to have, though not so much wit, at least as much vivacity? Age, care, wisdom, reflection, be gone! I give you to the winds. Let's have t'other bottle. Here's to the memory of Shakespeare, Falstaff, and all the merry men of Eastcheap! <pb id="p.562" n="562">
<p>Such were the reflections which naturally arose while I sat at the  <Q> Boar's Head Tavern,</Q>  still kept at Eastcheap. Here, by a pleasant fire, in the very room where old Sir John Falstaff cracked his jokes, in the very chair which was sometimes honoured by Prince Henry, and sometimes polluted by his immortal merry companions, I sat and ruminated on the follies of youth, wished to be young again, but was resolved to make the best of life whilst it lasted, and now and then compared past and present times together. I considered myself as the only living representative of the old knight, and transported my imagination back to the times when the Prince and he gave life to the revel. The room also conspired to throw my reflections back into antiquity. The oak floor, the Gothic windows, and the ponderous chimney-piece had long withstood the tooth of time. The watchman had gone <num value="12">twelve</num>. My companions had all stolen off, and none now remained with me but the landlord. From him I could have wished to know the history of a tavern that had such a long succession of customers. I could not help thinking that an account of this kind would be a pleasing contrast of the manners of different ages. But my landlord could give me no information. He continued to doze and sot, and tell a tedious story, as most other landlords usually do, and, though he said nothing, yet was never silent. <num value="1">One</num> good joke followed another good joke; and the best joke of all was generally begun towards the end of a bottle. I found at last, however, his wine and his conversation operate by degrees. He insensibly began to alter his appearance. His cravat seemed quilted into a ruff, and his breeches swelled out into a farthingale. I now fancied him changing sexes; and as my eyes began to close in slumber, I imagined my fat landlord, actually converted into as fat a landlady. However, sleep made but few changes in my situation. The tavern, the apartment, and the table continued as before. Nothing suffered mutation but my host, who was fairly altered into a gentlewoman, whom I knew to be Dame Quickly, mistress of this tavern in the days of Sir John; and the liquor we were drinking seemed converted into sack and sugar.
<p> <Q>My dear Mrs. Quickly,</Q>  cried I (for I knew her perfectly well at <num value="1">first</num> sight),  <Q>I am heartily glad to see you. How have you left Falstaff, Pistol, and the rest of our friends below stairs? --brave and hearty, I hope?</Q> </QUOTE>

<p>Years after that amiable American writer, Washington Irving, followed in Goldsmith's steps, and came to Eastcheap, in <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>, to search for Falstaff relics; and at the <QUOTE>Masons' Arms,</QUOTE> <num value="12">12</num>, Miles Lane, he was shown a tobacco-box and a sacramental cup from St. Michael's Church, which the poetical enthusiast mistook for a tavern goblet.
<p> <QUOTE>I was presented,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE><p>with a japanned iron tobacco-box, of gigantic size, out of which, I was told, the vestry smoked at their stated meetings from time immemorial, and which was never suffered to be profaned by vulgar hands, or used on common occasions. I received it with becoming reverence; but what was my delight on beholding on its cover the identical painting of which I was in quest I There was displayed the outside of the  <Q>Boar's Head Tavern;</Q>  and before the door was to be seen the whole convivial group at table, in full revel, pictured with that wonderful fidelity and force with which the portraits of renowned generals and commodores are illustrated on tobacco-boxes, for the benefit of posterity. Lest, however, there should be any mistake, the cunning limner had warily inscribed the names of Prince Hal and Falstaff on the bottom of their chairs.
<p>On the inside of the cover was an inscription, nearly obliterated, recording that the box was the gift of Sir Richard Gore, for the use of the vestry meetings at the Boar's Head Tavern, and that it was  <Q>repaired and beautified by his successor, Mr. John Packard, <datestruct value="1767--"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>.</Q>  Such is a faithful description of this august and venerable relic; and I question whether the learned Scriblerius contemplated his Roman shield, or the Knights of the Round Table the long-sought Saint-greal, with more exultation.
<p>The great importance attached to this memento of ancient revelry (the cup) by modern churchwardens at <num value="1">first</num> puzzled me; but there is nothing sharpens the apprehension so much as antiquarian research; for I immediately perceived that this could be no other than the identical  <Q>parcel-gilt goblet</Q>  on which Falstaff made his loving but faithless vow to Dame Quickly; and which would, of course, be treasured up with care among the regalia of her domains, as a testimony of that solemn contract.

<p><gap>For my part, I love to give myself up to the illusions of poetry. A hero of fiction, that never existed, is just as valuable to me as a hero of history that existed a <num value="1000">thousand</num> years since; and, if may be excused such an insensibility to the common ties of human nature, I would not give up fat Jack for half the great men of ancient chronicles, <pb id="p.563" n="563"> What have the heroes of yore done for me or men like me?

But old Jack Falstaff!--kind Jack Falstaff! sweet Jack Falstaff!--has enlarged the boundaries of human enjoyment; he has added vast regions of wit and good humour, in which the poorest man may revel; and has bequeathed a never-failing inheritance of jolly laughter, to make mankind merrier and better to the latest posterity.</QUOTE>

<p>The very name of the <QUOTE>Boar's Head,</QUOTE> Eastcheap, recalls a <num value="1000">thousand</num> Shakespearian recollections; for here Falstaff came panting from Gadshill; here he snored behind the arras while Prince Harry laughed over his unconscionable tavern bill; and here, too, took place that wonderful scene where Falstaff and the prince alternately passed judgment on each other's follies, Falstaff acting the prince's father, and Prince Henry retorts by taking up the same part. As this is <num value="1">one</num> of the finest efforts of Shakespeare's comic genius, a short quotation from it, on the spot where the same was supposed to take place, will not be out of place.
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><sp><SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER><p>Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time, but also how thou art accompanied; for though the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the more it wears. That thou art my son, I have partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion; but chiefly a villainous trick of thine eye, and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant me, If then thou be son to me, here lies the point--why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher, and eat blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall a son of England prove a thief, and take purses? a question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast often heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch. This pitch, as ancient writers do report, doth defile: so doth the company thou keepest; for, Harry, now I do not speak to thee in drink, but in tears; not in pleasure, but in passion; not in words only, but in woes also ;--and yet there is a virtuous man, whom I have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.
<sp><SPEAKER>P. Hen.</SPEAKER><p>What manner of man, an it like your Majesty?
<sp><SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER><p>A good portly man, i&lsquo; faith, and a corpulent; of a cheerful look, a pleasing eye, and a most noble carriage; and, as I think, his age some <num value="50">fifty</num>, or, by &lsquo;r Lady, inclining to <num value="3">three</num> score. And, now I remember me, his name is Falstaff. If that man should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Henry, I see virtue in his looks. If, then, the tree may be known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then, peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that Falstaff. Him keep with; the rest banish.
<sp><SPEAKER>P. Hen.</SPEAKER><p>Swearest thou, ungracious boy? Henceforth ne'er look on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace. There is a devil haunts thee, in the likeness of a fat old man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that bolting hutch of beastliness, that swoln parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and drink it? Wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a capon and, eat it? Wherein cunning, but in his craft? Wherein crafty, but in villany? Wherein villanous, but in all things? Wherein worthy, but in nothing?
<sp><SPEAKER>Fal.</SPEAKER><p>But to say I know more harm in him than in myself were to say more than I know.

<p> <QUOTE>In Love Lane,</QUOTE> says worthy Strype, <QUOTE>on the north-west corner, entering into Little Eastcheap, is the Weigh-house, built on the ground where the church of St. Andrew Hubbard stood before the fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>. Which said Weigh-house was before in Cornhill. In this house are weighed merchandizes brought from beyond seas to the king's beam, to which doth belong a master, and under him <num value="4">four</num> master porters, with labouring porters under them. They have carts and horses to fetch the goods from the merchants' warehouses to the beam, and to carry them back. The house belongeth to the Company of Grocers, in whose gift the several porters', &amp;c., places are. But of late years little is done in this office, a's wanting a compulsive power to constrain the merchants to have their goods weighed, they alleging it to be an unnecessary trouble and charge.</QUOTE>
<p>In former times it was the usual practice for merchandise brought to London by foreign merchants to be weighed at the king's beam in the presence of sworn officials. The fees varied from <measure value="2d." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>d.</measure> to <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>s.</measure> a draught; while for a bag of hops the uniform charge was <measure value="6d." type=currency><num value="6">6</num>d.</measure>
<p>The Presbyterian Chapel in the Weigh-house was founded by Samuel Slater and Thomas Kentish, <num value="2">two</num> divines driven by the Act of Uniformity from St. Katherine's in the Tower. The <num value="1">first</num>-named minister, Slater, has distinguished himself by his devotion during the dreadful plague which visited London in <datestruct value="1625--"><year reg="1625">1625</year></datestruct> (Charles I.). Kentish, of whom Calamy entertained a high opinion, had been persecuted by the Government. Knowle, another <pb id="p.564" n="564"> minister of this chapel, had fled to New England to escape Laud's cat-like gripe. In Cromwell's time he had been lecturer at Bristol Cathedral, and had there greatly exasperated the Quakers. Knowles and Kentish are said to have been so zealous as sometimes to preach till they fainted. In Thomas Reynolds's time a new chapel was built at the King's Weigh-house. Reynolds, a friend of the celebrated Howe, had studied at Geneva and at Utrecht. He died in <datestruct value="1727--"><year reg="1727">1727</year></datestruct>, declaring that, though he had hitherto dreaded death, he was rising to heaven on a bed of roses. After the celebrated quarrel between the subscribers and nonsub- scribers, a controversy took place about psalmody, which the Weigh-house ministers stoutly defended. Samuel Wilton, another minister of Weigh-house Chapel, was a pupil of Dr. Kippis; and an apologist for the War of Independence. John Clayton, chosen for this chapel in <datestruct value="1779--"><year reg="1779">1779</year></datestruct>, was the son of a Lancashire cotton-bleacher, and was converted by Romaine, and patronised by the excellent Countess of Huntingdon; he used to relate how he had been pelted with rotten eggs when preaching in the open air near Christchurch. While itinerating foi Lady Huntingdon, Clayton became acquainted
<FIGURE id="Fig.564" n="2000.06.0205"><HEAD>The Weigh-House Chapel (See Page <num value="563">563</num>).</HEAD></FIGURE>
 with Sir H. Trelawney, a young Cornish haronet, who became a Dissenting minister, and eventually joined the <QUOTE>Rational party.</QUOTE> An interesting anecdote is told of Trelawney's marriage in <datestruct value="1778--"><year reg="1778">1778</year></datestruct>. For his bride he took a beautiful girl, who, apparently without her lover's knowledge, annulled a prior engagement, in order to please her parents by securing for herself a more splendid station. The spectacle was a gay <num value="1">one</num> when, after their honeymoon, Sir Harry and his wife returned to his seat at Looe, to be welcomed home by his friend Clayton and the servants of the establishment. The young baronet proceeded to open a number of letters, and during the perusal of <num value="1">one</num> in particular his countenance changed, betokening some shock sustained by his nervous system. Evening wore into night, but he would neither eat nor converse. At length he confessed to Clayton that he had received an affecting expostulation from his wife's former lover, who had written, while ignorant of the marriage, calling on Trelawney as a gentleman to withdraw his claims on the lady's affections. This affair is supposed to have influenced Sir Harry more or less till the end of his days, although his married life continued to flow on happily. <pb id="p.565" n="565">
<p>Clayton was ordained at the Weigh House Chapel in <datestruct value="1778--"><year reg="1778">1778</year></datestruct>; the church, with <num value="1">one</num> exception unanimously voted for him--the <num value="1">one</num> exception, a lady, afterwards became the new minister's wife. Of Clayton Robert Hall said, <QUOTE>He was the most favoured man I ever saw or ever heard of.</QUOTE> He died in <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>. Clayton's successor, the eloquent Thomas Binney, was pastor of Weigh House Chapel for more than <num value="40">forty</num> years. So ends the chronicle of the Weigh House worthies.

The altitude from the pavement is <num value="202">202</num> feet; the diameter of the shaft (or body) of the column is <num value="15">15</num> feet; the ground bounded by the plinth or lowest part of the pedestal is <num value="28">28</num> feet square, and the pedestal in height is <num value="40">40</num> feet.

Over the capital is an iron balcony encompassing a cippus, or meta, <num value="32">32</num> feet high, supporting a blazing urn of brass gilt. Prior to this the surveyor (as it appears by an original drawing) had made a design of a pillar of somewhat less proportion-viz., <num value="14">14</num> feet in diameter, and after a peculiar device; for as the Romans expressed by
<hi rend=italics>relievo</hi> on the pedestals and round the shafts of their columns the history of such actions and incidents as were intended to be thereby commemorated, so this monument of the conflagration and resurrection of the City of London was represented by a pillar in flames.

<p>This pillar was set up in perpetual remembrance of the most dreadful burning, of this Protestant city, begun and carried on by the treachery and malice of the Popish faction, in the beginning of <hi rend=italics>September</hi>, in the year of our Lord DCLXVI., in order to the effecting their horrid plot for the extirpating the Protestant religion and English liberties, and to introduce Popery and slavery.</QUOTE>

<p> <QUOTE>The basis of
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.566.1">the monument</lemma>,</QUOTE> says Strype, <QUOTE><p>on that side toward the street, hath a representation of the destruction of the City by the Fire, and the restitution of it, by several curiously engraven figures in full proportion. <num value="1">First</num> is the figure of a woman representing London, sitting on ruins, in a most disconsolate posture, her head hanging down, and her hair all loose about her; the sword lying by her, and her left hand carefully laid upon it. A <num value="2">second</num> figure is Time, with his wings and bald head, coming behind her and gently lifting her up. Another female figure on the side of her, laying her hand upon her, and with a sceptre winged in her other hand, directing her to look upwards, for it points up to <num value="2">two</num> beautiful goddesses sitting in the clouds, <num value="1">one</num> leaning upon a cornucopia, denoting Plenty, the other having a palm-branch in her left hand, signifying Victory, or Triumph. Underneath this figure of London in the midst of the ruins is a dragon with his paw upon the shield of a red cross, London's arms. Over her head is the description of houses burning, and flames breaking <pb id="p.567" n="567"> out through the windows. Behind her are citizens looking on, and some lifting up their hands.
<p>Opposite against these figures is a pavement of stone raised, with <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> steps, on which appears King Charles II., in Roman habit, with a truncheon in his right hand and a laurel about his head, coming towards the woman in the foresaid despairing posture, and giving orders to <num value="3">three</num> others to descend the steps towards her. The <num value="1">first</num> hath wings on her head, and in her hand something resembling a harp. Then another figure of <num value="1">one</num> going down the steps following her, resembling Architecture, showing a scheme or model for building of the City, held in the right hand, and the left holding a square and compasses. Behind these <num value="2">two</num> stands another figure, more obscure, holding up an hat, denoting Liberty. Next behind the king is the Duke of York, holding a garland, ready to crown the rising City, and a sword lifted up in the other hand to defend her. Behind this a <num value="3">third</num> figure, with an earl's coronet on his head. A <num value="4">fourth</num> figure behind all, holding a lion with a bridle in his mouth. Over these figures is represented an house in building, and a labourer going up a ladder with an hodd upon his back. Lastly, underneath the stone pavement whereon the king stands is a good figure of Envy peeping forth, gnawing a heart.</QUOTE>

<p>The bas-relief on the pediment of the Monument was carved by a Danish sculptor, Caius Gabriel Cibber, the father of the celebrated comedian and comedy writer Colley Cibber; the <num value="4">four</num> dragons at the <num value="4">four</num> angles are by Edward Pierce. The Latin inscriptions were written by Dr. Gale, Dean of York, and the whole structure was erected in <num value="6">six</num> years, for the sum of <measure value="13700l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="13700">13,700</num></measure>. The paragraphs denouncing Popish incendiaries were not written by Gale, but were added in <datestruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></datestruct>, during the madness of the Popish plot. They were obliterated by James II., but cut again deeper than before in the reign of William III., and finally erased in <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>, to the great credit of the Common Council.
<p>Wren at <num value="1">first</num> intended to have had flames of gilt brass coming out of every loop-hole of the Monument, and on the top a phoenix rising from the flames, also in brass gilt. He eventually abandoned this idea, partly on account of the expense, and also because the spread wings of the phoenix would present too much resistance to the wind. Moreover, the fabulous bird at that height would not have been understood. Charles II. preferred a gilt ball, and the present vase of flames was then decided on. Defoe compares the Monument to a lighted candle.
<p>The Monument is loftier than the pillars of Trajan and Antoninus, at Rome, or that of Theodosius at Constantinople; and it is not only the loftiest, but also the finest isolated column in the world.
<p>It was at <num value="1">first</num> used by the members of the Roya! Society for astronomical purposes, but was abandoned on account of its vibration being too great for the nicety required in their observations. Hence the report that the Monument is unsafe, which has been revived in our time; <QUOTE>but,</QUOTE> says Elwes, <QUOTE>its scientific construction may bid defiance to the attacks of all but earthquakes for centuries to come.</QUOTE>
<p>A large print of the Monument represents the statue of Charles placed, for comparative effect, beside a sectional view of the apex, as constructed. Wren's autograph report on the designs for the summit were added to the MSS. in the British Museum in <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>. A model, scale <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="8">eighth</num> of an inch to the foot, of the scaffolding used in building the Monument is preserved. It formerly belonged to Sir William Chambers, and was presented by Heathcote Russell, C.E., to the late Sir Isambard Brunel, who left it to his son, Mr. I. K. Brunel. he ladders were of the rude construction of Wren's time-<num value="2">two</num> uprights, with treads or rounds nailed on the face.
<p>On <datestruct VALUE="1825-06-15"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=15>15</day>, <year reg=1825>1825</year></datestruct>, the Monument was illuminated with portable gas, in commemoration of laying the <num value="1">first</num> stone of New London Bridge. A lamp was placed at each of the loop-holes of the column, to give the idea of its being wreathed with flame; whilst <num value="2">two</num> other series were placed on the edges of the gallery, to which the public were admitted during the evening.
<p>Certain spots in London have become popular with suicides, yet apparently without any special reason, except that even suicides are vain and like to die with &<hi rend=italics>cdat</hi>. Waterloo Bridge is chosen for its privacy; the Monument used to be chosen, we presume, for its height and quietude. <num value="5">Five</num> persons have destroyed themselves by leaps from the Monument. The <num value="1">first</num> of these unhappy creatures was William Green, a weaver, in <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>. On <datestruct value="06-25"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=25>25</day></datestruct> this man, wearing a green apron, the sign of his craft, came to the Monument door, and left his watch with the doorkeeper. A few minutes after he was heard to fall. Eighteen guineas were found in his pocket. The next man who fell from the Monument was Thomas Craddock, a baker. e was not a suicide; but, in reaching over to see an eagle which was hung in a cage from the bars, he overbalanced himself, and was killed. The next victim was Lyon Levi, a Jew diamond merchant in embarrassed circumstances, who destroyed himself on the <datestruct VALUE="1810-01-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>. The <num value="3">third</num> suicide <pb id="p.568" n="568">  (<datestruct VALUE="1839-09-11"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=11>11</day>, <year reg=1839>1839</year></datestruct>) was a young woman named Margaret Meyer. This poor girl was the daughter of a baker in Hemming's Row, St. Martin'sin- the-Fields. Her mother was dead, her father bed-ridden, and there being a large family, it had become necessary for her to go out to service, which preyed upon her mind. The October following, a boy named Hawes, who had been that morning discharged by his master, a surgeon, threw himself from the same place. He was of unsound mind, and his father had killed himself. he last suicide was in <datestruct VALUE="1842-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1842">1842</year></datestruct>, when a servant-girl from Hoxton, named Jane Cooper, while the watchman had his head turned, nimbly climbed over the iron railing, tucked her clothes tight between her knees, and dived headfore- most downwards. In her fall she struck the griffin on the right side of the base of the Monument, and, rebounding. into the road, cleared a cart in the fall. The cause of this act was not discovered. Suicides being now fashionable here, the City of London (not a moment too soon)
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.568.1">caged in the top of the Monument</lemma> in the present ugly way.
<p>The Rev. Samuel Rolle, writing of the Great Fire in <datestruct value="1667--"><year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>, says--<QUOTE><p>If London its self be not the doleful monument of its own destruction, by always lying in ashes (which God forbid it should), it is provided for by Act of Parliament, that after its restauration, a pillar, either of brass or stone, should be erected, in perpetual memory of its late most dismall conflagration.
<p>Where the fire began, there, or as near as may be to that place, must the pillar be erected (if ever there be any such). If we commemorate the places where our miseries began, surely the causes whence they sprang (the meritorious causes, or sins, are those I now intend) should be thought of much more. If such a Lane burnt London, sin <num value="1">first</num> burnt that Lane; <foreign lang=la>causa, causa est causa causatio</foreign>; <hi>affliction springs not out of the dust</hi>; not but that it may spring thence immediately (as if the dust of the earth should b.e turned into lice), but primarily and originally it springs up elsewhere.
<p>As for the inscription that ought to be upon that pillar (whether of brass or stone), I must leave it to their piety and prudence, to whom the wisdom of the Parliament hath left it; only <num value="3">three</num> things I both wish and hope concerning it. The <num value="1">first</num> is, that it may be very humble, giving God the glory of his righteous judgments, and taking to ourselves the shame of our great demerits. Secondly, that the confession which shall be there engraven may be as impartial as the judgement itself was; not charging the guilt for which that fire came upon a few only, but acknowledging that all have sinned, as all have been punished. Far be it from any man to say that his sins did not help to burn London, that cannot say also (and who that is I know not) that neither he nor any of his either is, or are ever like to be, anything the worse for that dreadful fire. Lastly, whereas some of the same religion with those that did hatch the Powder-Plot are, and have been, vehemently suspected to have been the incendiaries, by whose means London was burned, I earnestly desire that if time and further discovery be able to acquit them from any such guilt, that pillar may record their innocency, and may make themselves as <hi rend=italics>an iron pillar or brazen wall</hi> (as I may allude to Jer. i. <num value="18">18</num>) against all the accusations of those that suspect them; but if, in deed and iir truth, that fire either came or was carried on and continued by their treachery, that the inscription of the pillar may consigne over their names to perpetual hatred and infamy.
<p>Then was God to his people as a shadow from the heat of the rage of their enemies, as a wall of fire for their protection; but this pillar calls that time to remembrance, in which God covered himself, as with a cloud, that the prayers of Londoners should not passe unto him, and came forth, not as a conserving, but as a consuming fire, not for, but against, poor London.</QUOTE>

<p>Roger North, in his Life of Sir Dudley, mentions the Monument when still in its <num value="1">first</num> bloom. <QUOTE>He (Sir Dudley North),</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>took pleasure in surveying the Monument, and comparing it with mosque-towers, and what of that kind he had seen abroad. We mounted up to the top, and <num value="1">one</num> after another crept up the hollow iron frame that carries the copper head and flames above. We went out at a rising plate of iron that hinged, and there found convenient irons to hold by. We made use of them, and raised our bodies entirely above the flames, having only our legs to the knees within; and there we stood till we were satisfied with the prospect from thence. I cannot describe how hard it was to persuade ourselves we stood safe, so likely did our weight seem to throw down the whole fabric.</QUOTE>
<p>Addison takes care to show his Tory foxhunter the famed Monument. <QUOTE>We repaired,</QUOTE> says the amiable essayist, <QUOTE>to the Monument, where my fellow-traveller (the Tory fox-hunter), being a well-breathed man, mounted the ascent with much speed and activity. I was forced to halt so often in this particular march, that, upon my joining him on the top of the pillar, I found he had counted all the steeples and towers which were discernible from this advantageous situation, <pb id="p.569" n="569"> and was endeavouring to compute the number of acres they stood on. We were both of us very well pleased with this part of the prospect; but I found he cast an evil eye upon several warehouses and other buildings, which looked like barns, and seemed capable of receiving great multitudes of people. His heart misgave him that these were so many meeting-houses; but, upon communicating his suspicions to me, I soon made him easy in that particular. We then turned our eyes upon the river, which gave me an occasion to inspire him with some favourable thoughts of trade and merchandise, that had filled the Thames with such crowds of ships, and covered the shore with such swarms of people. We descended very leisurely, my friend being careful to count the steps, which he registered in a blank leaf of his new almanack. Upon our coming to the bottom, observing an English inscription upon the basis, he read it over several times, and told me he could scarce believe his own eyes, for he had often heard from an old attorney who lived near him in the country that it was the Presbyterians who burnt down the City,  <Q>whereas,</Q>  says he,  <Q>the pillar positively affirms, in so many words, that the burning of this antient city was begun and carried on by, the treachery and malice of the Popish faction, in order to the carrying on their horrid plot for extirpating the Protestant religion and old English liberty, and introducing Popery and slavery.</Q>  This account, which he looked upon to be more authentic than if it had been in print, I found, made a very great impression upon him.</QUOTE>
<p>Ned Ward is very severe on the Monument. <QUOTE>As you say, this edifice,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>as well as some others, was projected as a memorandum of the Fire, or an ornament to the City, but gave those corrupted magistrates that had the power in their hands the opportunity of putting <measure value="2000l." type=currency><num value="2000">two thousand</num> pounds</measure> into their own pockets, whilst they paid <num value="1">one</num> towards the building. I must confess, all I think can be spoke in praise of it is, <hi>&lsquo;tis a monument to the City's shame, the orphan's grief the Protestant's pride, and the Papist's scandal; and only serves as a high-crowned hat, to cover the head of the old fellow that shows it.</hi></QUOTE>

<p>Mr. John Hollingshead, an admirable modemr essayist, in a chapter in <title>Under Bow Bells,</title> entitled <title>A Night on the Monument,</title> has given a most powerful sketch of night, moonlight, and daybreak from the top of the Monument. <QUOTE>The puppet men,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE><p>now hurry to and fro, lighting up the puppet shops, which cast a warm, rich glow upon the pavement. A cross of dotted lamps springs into light, the <num value="4">four</num> arms of which are the <num value="4">four</num> great thoroughfares from the City. ed lines of fire come out behind black, solid, sullen masses of building; and spires of churches stand out in strong, dark relief at the side of busy streets. Up in the housetops, under green-shaded lamps, you may see the puppet clerks turning quickly over the clean, white, fluttering pages of puppet day-books and ledgers; and from east to west you see the long, silent river, glistening here and there with patches of reddish light, even through the looped steeple of the Church of St. Magnus the Martyr. Then, in a white circle of light round the City, dart out little nebulous clusters of houses, some of them high up in the air, mingling, in appearance, with the stars of heaven; some with <num value="1">one</num> lamp, some with <num value="2">two</num> or more; some yellow, and some red; and some looking like bunches of fiery grapes in the congress of twinkling suburbs. Then the bridges throw up their arched lines of lamps, like the illuminated garden-walks at Cremorne. <gap>

<p>The moon has now increased in power, and, acting on the mist, brings out the surrounding churches <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>. There they stand in the soft light, a noble army of temples thickly sprinkled amongst the money-changers. Any taste may be suited in structural design. There are high churches, low churches; flat churches; broad churches, narrow churches; square, round, and pointed churches; churches with towers like <pb id="p.570" n="570"> cubical slabs sunk deeply in between the roofs of houses; towers like toothpicks, like <num value="3">three</num>-pronged forks, like pepper-casters, like factory chimneys, like limekilns, like a sailor's trousers hung up to dry, like bottles of fish-sauce, and like St. Paul'sa balloon turned topsy-turvy. There they stand, like giant spectral watchmen guarding the silent city, whose beating heart still murmurs in its sleep. At the hour of midnight they proclaim, with iron tongue, the advent of a New Year, mingling a song of joy with a wail for the departed <gap>

<p>The dark grey churches and houses spring into existence <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>. The streets come up

The distant turrets of the Tower, and the long line of shipping on the river, become visible. Clear smoke still flows over the housetops, softening their outlines, and turning them into a forest of frosted trees.
<p>Above all this is a long black mountain-ridge of cloud, tipped with glittering gold; beyond float deep orange and light yellow ridges, bathed in a faint purple sea. Through the black ridge struggles a full, rich, purple sun, the lower half of his disc <pb id="p.571" n="571">

<p>This celebrated inscription (says Cunningham), set up pursuant to an order of the Court of Common Council, <datestruct VALUE="1681-06-17"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=17>17th</day>, <year reg=1681>1681</year></datestruct>, was removed in the reign of James II., replaced in the reign of William III., and finally taken down, <QUOTE>on account of the stoppage of passengers to read it.</QUOTE> Entick, who made additions to Maitland in <datestruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>, speaks of it as <QUOTE>lately taken away.</QUOTE>
<p>The Fire was for a long time attributed to Hubert, a crazed French Papist of <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> and <num value="20">twenty</num> years of age, the son of a watchmaker at Rouen, in Normandy. He was seized in Essex, confessed he had begun the fire, and persisting in his confession to his death, was hanged, upon no other evidence than that of his own confession.

<p>A few notes about the Great Fire will here be interesting.
<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.572.2">Pepys</lemma> gives a graphic account of its horrors.

And, among other things, the poor pigeons, I perceive, were loth to leave their houses, but hovered about the windows and balconys till they burned their wings and fell down.

<p>But by far the most, vivid conception of the Fire is to be found in a religious book written by the Rev. Samuel Vincent, who expresses the feelings of the moment with a singular force. Says the writer:
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>It was the <datestruct VALUE="1666-09-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, that the anger of the Lord was kindled against London, and the fire began. It began in a baker's house in Pudding Lane, by Fish Street Hill; and now the Lord is making London like a fiery oven in the time of his anger (Psalm xxi. <num value="9">9</num>), and in his wrath doth devour and swallow up our habitations. It was in the depth and dead of the night, when most doors and senses were lockt up in the City, that the fire doth break forth and appear abroad, and like a mighty giant refresht with wine doth <pb id="p.573" n="573"> awake and arm itself, quickly gathers strength, when it had made havoc of some houses, rusheth down the hill towards the bridge, crosseth Thames Street, invadeth Magnus Church at the bridge foot, and, though that church were so great, yet it was not a sufficient barricade against this conqueror; but having scaled and taken this fort, it shooteth flames with so much the greater advantage into all places round about, and a great building of houses upon the bridge is quickly thrown to the ground. Then the conqueror, being stayed in his course at the bridge, marcheth back towards the City again, and runs along with great noise and violence through Thames Street westward, where, having such combustible matter in its teeth, and such a fierce wind upon its back, it prevails with little resistance, unto the astonishment of the beholders.
<p>My business is not to speak of the hand of man, which was made use of in the beginning and carrying on of this fire. The beginning of the fire at such a time, when there had been so much hot weather, which had dried the houses and made them more fit for fuel; the beginning of it in such a place, where there were so many timber houses, and the shops filled with so much combustible matter; and the beginning of it just when the wind did blow-so fiercely upon that corner towards the rest of the City, which then was like tinder to the spark; this doth smell of a Popish design, hatcht in the same place where the Gunpowder Plot was contrived, only that this was more successful.
<p>Then, then the City did shake indeed, and the inhabitants flew away in great amazement from their houses, lest the flame should devour them. Rattle, rattle, rattle, was the noise which the fire struck upon the ear round about, as if there had been a <num value="1000">thousand</num> iron chariots beating upon the stones; and if you opened your eye to the opening of the streets where the fire was come, you might see in some places whole streets at once in flames, that issued forth as if they had been so many great forges from the opposite windows, which, folding together, were united into <num value="1">one</num> great flame throughout the whole street; and then you might see the houses tumble, tumble, tumble, from <num value="1">one</num> end of the street to the other, with a great crash, leaving the foundations open to the view of the heavens.</QUOTE>

<p>The original Church of St. Magnus, London ridge, was of great antiquity; for we learn that in <datestruct value="1302--"><year reg="1302">1302</year></datestruct> Hugh Pourt, sheriff of London, and his wife Margaret, founded a charity here; and the <num value="1">first</num> rector mentioned by Newcourt is Robert de St. Albano, who resigned his living in <datestruct value="1323--"><year reg="1323">1323</year></datestruct>.

On the top of the square tower, which is terminated with an open parapet, Wren has introduced an octagon lantern of very simple and pleasing design, crowned by a cupola and short spire. We must here, once for all, remark on the fertility of invention displayed by Wren in varying constantly the form of his steeples.
<p>The interior of the church is divided into a nave and, side aisles by Doric columns, that support an entablature from which rises the camerated ceiling. <QUOTE>The general proportions of the church,</QUOTE> says Mr. Godwin, <QUOTE>are pleasing; but the columns are too slight, the space between them too wide, and the result is a disagreeable feeling of insecurity.</QUOTE> The altar-piece, adorned with the figure of a pelican feeding her young, is richly carved and gilded.

<lemma resp=bolles id="lemma.574.1">Miles Coverdale</lemma>, the great reformer, was a rector of St. Magnus'.

Thomas Lord Cromwell patronised him; and Queen Catherine Parr appointed him her almoner. At the funeral of that ill-fated lady he preached a sermon at SudeleyCastle. When Mary came to the throne, she soon exerted her authority in tyrannically ejecting and persecuting this amiable and learned prelate. By an-Act of Council (<datestruct value="1554--"><year reg="1554">1554</year></datestruct>-<num value="55">55</num>) he was allowed to <QUOTE>passe towards Denmarche with <num value="2">two</num> servants, his bagges and baggage,</QUOTE> where he remained till the death of the queen.

This was the <num value="1">first</num> English Bible allowed by royal authority, and the <num value="1">first</num> translation of the whole Bible printed in our language.

</LIST></ARGUMENT>

<P>The London of Chaucer's time (the reigns of Edward III. and Richard II.) was a scattered town, spotted as thick with gardens as a common meadow is with daisies. Hovels stood cheek by jowl with stately monasteries, and the fortified mansions in the narrow City lanes were surrounded by citizens' stalls and shops. Westminster Palace, out in the suburbs among fields and marshes, was joined to the City walls by that long straggling street of bishops' and nobles' palaces, called the Strand. The Tower and the Savoy were still royal residences. In all the West-end beyond Charing Cross, and in all the north of London beyond Clerkenwell and Holborn, cows and horses grazed, milkmaids sang, and ploughmen whistled. There was danger in St. John's Wood and Tyburn Fields, and robbers on Hampstead Heath. The heron could be found in Marylebone pastures, and moorhens in the brooks round Paddington. Priestly processions were to be seen in Cheapside, where the great cumbrous signs, blazoned with all known and many unknown animals, hung above the open stalls, where the staid merchants and saucy &lsquo;prentices shouted the praises of their goods. The countless church-bells rang ceaselessly, to summon the pious to prayers. Among the street crowds the monks and men-at-arms were numerous, and were conspicuous by their robes and by their armour.
<p>With the manners and customs of those simple times our readers will now be pretty well familiar, for we have already written of the knights and priests of that age, and have described their good and evil doings. We have set down their epitaphs, detailed the history of their City companies, their mayors, aldermen, and turbulent citizens. We have shown their buildings, and spoken of their revolts against injustice. Yet, after all, Time has destroyed many pieces of that old puzzle, and who can dive into oblivion and recover them? The long rows of gable ends, the abbey archways, the old guild rooms, the knightly chambers, no magic can restore to us in perfect combination. While certain spots can be etched with exactitude by the pen, on vast tracts no image rises. A dimmed and imperfect picture it remains, we must confess, even to the most vivid imagination. How the small details of City life worked in those days we shall never know. We may reproduce Edward III.'s London on the stage, or in poems; but, after all, and at the best, it will be conjecture.
<p>But of many of those people who paced in Watling Street, or who rode up Cornhill, we have imperishable pictures, true to the life, and richcoloured as Titian's, by Chaucer, in those <title>Canterbury Tales</title> he is supposed to have written about <datestruct value="1385--"><year reg="1385">1385</year></datestruct> (Richard II.), in advanced life, and in his peaceful retirement at Woodstock. The pilgrims he paints in his immortal bundle of tales are no ideal creatures, but such real flesh and blood as Shakespeare drew and Hogarth engraved. He drew the people of his age as genius most delights to do; and the fame he gained arose chiefly from the fidelity of the figures with which he filled his wonderful portrait-gallery.
<p>We, therefore, in Chaucer's knight, are introduced to just such old warriors as might any day, in the reign of Edward III., be met in Bow Lane or Friday Street, riding to pay his devoirs to some noble of Thames Street, to solicit a regiment, or to claim redress for a wrong by force of arms. The great bell of Bow may have struck the hour of noon as the man who rode into Pagan Alexandria, under the banner of the Christian King of Cyprus, and who had broken a spear against the Moors at the siege of Granada, rides by on his strong but not showy charger. He wears, you see, a fustian gipon, which is stained with the rust of his armour. There is no plume in his helmet, no gold upon his belt, for he is just come from Anatolia, where he has smitten off many a turbaned head, and to-morrow will start to thank God for his safe return at the shrine of St. Thomas in Kent. In sooth it needs only a glance at him to see that he is <QUOTE>a very perfect gentle knight,</QUOTE> meek as a maid, and trusty as his own sword.
<p>That trusty young bachelor who rides so gaily by the old knight's side, and who regards him with love and reverence, is his son, a brave young knight of <num value="20">twenty</num> years of age, as we guess. He has borne him well in Flanders, Artois, and Picardy, and has watered many a French vineyard. with French blood. See how smart he is in his short gown and long wide sleeves. He can joust, and dance, and sing, and write love verses, with any <num value="1">one</num> between here and Paris. The citizens' daughters devour him with their eyes as he rides under their easements <pb id="p.576" n="576">
<p>There rides behind this worthy pair a stout yeoman, such as you can see a dozen of every morning, in this reign, in <num value="10">ten</num> minutes' walk down Cheapside, for the nobles' houses in the City swarm with such retainers-sturdy, brown-faced country fellows, quick of quarrel, and not disposed to bear gibes. He wears a coat and hood of Lincoln green, and has a sword, dagger, horn, and buckler by his side. The sheaf of arrows at his girdle have peacock-feathers. <num value="10">Ten</num> to <num value="1">one</num> but that fellow let fly many a shaft at Cressy and Poictiers, for he is fond of saying, over his ale-bowl, that he carries <QUOTE><num value="10">ten</num> Frenchmen's lives under his belt.</QUOTE>
<p>The prioress Chaucer sketches so daintily might have been seen any day ambling through Bishopsgate from her country nunnery, on her way to shrine or altar, or on a visit to some noble patroness to whom she is akin. <QUOTE>By St. Eloy!</QUOTE> she cries to her mule, <QUOTE>if thou stumble again I will chide thee!</QUOTE> and she says it in the French of Stratford at Bow. Her wimple is trimly plaited, and how fashionable is her cloak! She wears twisted round her arm a pair of coral beads, and from them hangs a gold ornament with the unecclesiastical motto of
<QUOTE lang=la>Amor vincit omnia.</QUOTE> Behind her rides a nun and <num value="3">three</num> priests, and by the side of her mule run the little greyhounds whom she feeds, and on whom she doats.
<p>The rich monk that loved hunting was a character that any monastery of Chaucer's London could furnish. Go early in the morning to Aldersgate or Cripplegate, and you will be sure to find such a <num value="1">one</num> riding out with his greyhounds and falcon. His dress is rich, for he does not sneer at worldly pleasures. His sleeves are trimmed with fur, and the pin that fastens his hood is a gold love-knot. His brown palfrey is fat, like its master, who does not despise a roast Thames swan for dinner, and whose face shines with good humour and good living. It is such men as these that Wycliffe's followers deride, and point the finger at; but they forget that the Church uses strong arguments with perverse adversaries.
<p>To find Chaucer's merchant you need not go further than a few yards from Milk Street. There you will see him at any stall, grave, and with forked beard; on his head a Flemish beaver hat, and his boots <QUOTE>full fetishly</QUOTE> clasped. He talks much of profits and exchanges, and the necessity of guarding the sea, from the French between- Middleburgh and the Essex ports.
<p>Chaucer's poor lean Oxford clerk you will find in Paul's, peering about the tombs, as if looking for a benefice. All his riches, worthy man! are some <num value="20">twenty</num> books at his bed's head, and he is talking philosophy to a fellow-student lean and thin as himself, to the profound contempt of that stiff serjeant-at-law who is waiting for clients near the font, on which his fees are paid.
<p>Any procession day in the age of Edward you can meet, in Westminster Abbey, near the royal shrines and tombs, Chaucer's franklin, or country gentleman, with his red face and white beard. His dagger hangs by his silk purse, and his girdle is as white as milk, for our friend has been a sheriff and knight of the shire, and is known all Buckinghamshire over for his open house and well-covered board. Aye, and many a fat partridge he has in his pen, and many a fat pike in his fish-pond.
<p>Chaucer's shipman we shall be certain to discover near Billingsgate. He is from Dartmouth, and wears a short coat, and a knife hanging from his neck. A hardy good fellow he is, and shrewd, and his beard has shaken in many a tempest. Bless you! the captain of the <hi rend=italics>Magdalen</hi> knows all the havens from Gothland to Cape Finisterre, aye, and every creek in Brittany and Spain; and many a draught of Bordeaux wine he has tapped at night from his cargo.
<p>Nor must we forget that favourite pilgrim of Chaucer--the poor parson of a town, who is also a learned clerk, and who is by many supposed to strongly resemble Wycliffe himself, whom Chaucer's patron, John of Gaunt, protects at the hazard of his life. He is no proud Pharisee, like the fat abbot who has just gone past the church door; but benign and wondrous diligent, and in adversity full patient. Rather than be cursed for the tithe he takes, he gives to the poor of his very subsistence. Come rain, come thunder, staff in hand, he visits the farthest end of his parish; he has no spiced conscience--
<QUOTE REND=blockquote>For Christe's love, and his apostles <num value="12">twelve</num>, He taught, <hi>but <num value="1">first</num> he followed it himselve.</hi></QUOTE>
You will find him, be sure, on his knees on the cold floor, before some humble City altar, heedless of all but prayer, or at the lazar-house on his knees, beside some poor leper, and pointing through the shadow of death to the shining gables of the New Jerusalem.
<p>Such were the tenants of Chaucer's London. On these types at least we may dwell with certainty. As for the proud nobles and the toughskulled knights, we must look for them in the pages of Froissart. Of the age of Edward III. at least our patriarchal poet has shown us some vivid glimpses, and imagination finds pleasure in tracing home his pilgrims to their houses in St. Bartholomew's and Budge Row, the Blackfriars monastery, and the palace on the Thames shore. </TEXT></TEI.2>
