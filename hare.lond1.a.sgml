<div1 type="chapter" n="1" id="c.1"><HEAD>Preface.</HEAD>
 
 <p>Long ago, when I was a boy at a private tutors near Edmonton, the only book in which I could find any interest or amusement in the scanty library of the house was Charles Knight's <title>London,</title> and the pleasure derived from it led to my spending every sixpence I could save, and every holiday on which I could get leave, in seeing some of the places it described. 
   <p>London is much changed since that time; but the solitary expeditions I then made through its historic sights, so inexpressibly delightful at the time, laid a foundation for the work of the last <num value="2">two</num> years, of which these volumes are the result.. They aim at nothing original, indeed any <num value="1">one</num> who attempts a work of the kind must, to borrow the language of the author of <title>Eothen,</title> be <QUOTE>subjected to the immutable law which compels a man with a pen in his hand to be uttering now and then some sentiment not his own, as though, like the French peasant under the old <foreign lang=fr>r&eacute;gime</foreign>, he were bound to perform a certain amount of work on the public highways.</QUOTE> But, when I was wishing to know something about London <pb id="p.viii" n="viii"> myself, in spite of the multiplicity of works upon the subject, I felt the want of having things brought together in the order in which they occur, of <num value="1">one</num> recollection being interlaced with another in a way which might help me to remember it, and this is what I have tried to do for others. 
    <p>In these <num value="2">two</num> volumes I believe that all the objects of interest in London are described consecutively, as they may be visited in excursions, taking Charing Cross as a centre.  The <num value="1">first</num> volume is chiefly devoted to the City, the <num value="2">second</num> to the West End and Westminster. 
    <p>I have followed the plan adopted in my books on Italy, of introducing quotations from other and better authors, where they apply to my subject; and, while endeavouring to make <title>Walks in London</title> something more interesting than a Guide-book, I have tried, especially in Westminster Abbey and the Picture Galleries, to give such details as may suggest new lines of inquiry to those who care to linger and investigate. 
   <p>The Histories of London, and the Histories of especial points connected with London, are too numerous to mention. They are all to be found in the admirable Library at the Guildhall, which is the greatest advantage to a local antiquarian, and leaves little to be desired except a better Catalogue. Of the various works by which I have benefited in my own rambles through London, I should mention with marked gratitude the many volumes of Mr. John Timbs, especially his <title>Curiosities of London,</title> enriched by <title><num value="60">Sixty</num> Years' Personal Recollections,</title> and the admirable articles <pb id="p.ix" n="ix"> on the old houses and churches of London which, for many years, have from time to time appeared in <title>The Builder.</title>

   <p>Some of the chapters in <title>Walks in London </title> have been already published, in a condensed form, in <title>Good Words</title>
for <datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>. The illustrations, with <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> exceptions, are from my own sketches taken on the spot, and carefully transferred to wood by the skill of Mr. T. Sulman. 
   <p>I shall gladly and gratefully receive any corrections of errors found in my work by those who follow in my footsteps.

 <pb id="p.xii" n="xii"> 
<p> <QUOTE>Sir, the happiness of London is not to be conceived but by those who have been in it. I will venture to say there is more learning and science within the circumference of <num value="10">ten</num> miles from where we sit than in all the rest of the kingdom.</QUOTE> Such was the dictum of Dr. Johnson when he was seated with Boswell in the Mitre Tavern near Temple Bar, and how many thousands of people before and since have felt the same cat-like attachment as the old philosopher to the vast town of multitudinous life and ever-changing aspects?   As Cowper says- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Where has Pleasure such a field, 
<L>So rich, so thronged, so drained, so well supplied, 
<L>As London-opulent, enlarged, and still 
<L>Increasing London.</QUOTE>
 
    <p>Macaulay had the reputation of having walked through every street in London, but if we consider the ever-growing size of the town we cannot believe that anyone else will ever do so: for more people live in London already than in the whole of Denmark or Switzerland, more than twice as many as in Saxony or Norway, and nearly as many as in  Scotland. And, if we trust to old prophecies. London has <pb id="p.xiii" n="xiii"> still to be doubled in circumference, for Mother Shipton says that the day will come when Highgate Hill shall be in the middle of the town. Few indeed are the Londoners who see more than a small circuit around their homes, the main arteries of mercantile life, and some of the principal sights. It is very easy to live with eyes open, but it is more usual, and a great deal more fashionable, to live with eyes shut. Scarcely any man in what is usually called <QUOTE>society</QUOTE> has the slightest idea of what there is to be seen in his own great metropolis, because he never looks, or still more perhaps, because he never inquires, and the architectural and historical treasures of the City are almost as unknown to the West End as the buried cities of Bashan or the lost tombs of Etruria. Strangers also, especially foreigners, who come perhaps with the very object of seeing London, are inclined to judge it by its general aspects, and do not stay long enough to find out its more hidden resources. They never find out that the London of Brook Street and Grosvenor Street, still more the odious London of Tyburnia, Belgravia, and South Kensington, is as different to the London of our great-grandfathers as modernised Paris is to the oldest town in Brittany, and dwellers in the West End do not know that they might experience almost the refreshment and tonic of going abroad in the transition from straight streets and featureless houses to the crooked thoroughfares half-an-hour off, where every street has a reminiscence, and every turn is a picture.   There is a passage in Heinrich Heine which says, <QUOTE>You may send a philosopher to London, but by no means a poet.   The bare earnestness of everything, the colossal sameness, the machine-like movement, oppresses the imagination and <pb id="p.xv" n="xv"> rends the heart in twain.</QUOTE> But those who know London well will think that Heine must have stayed at an hotel in Wimpole Street, and that his researches can never have taken him much beyond Oxford Street and its surroundings; and that a poet might find plenty of inspiration, if he would do what is so easy, and break the ice of custom, and see London as it really is--in its strange varieties of society, in its lights and shadows of working life, in its endless old buildings which must ever have a hold on the inmost sympathies of those who look upon them, and who, while learning the story they tell of many generations, seem to realise that they are <QUOTE>in the presence of their fame and feel their influence.</QUOTE> 
   <p>An artist, after a time, will find London more interesting than any other place, for nowhere are there such atmospheric effects on fine days, and nowhere is the enormous power of blue more felt in the picture; while the soot, which puts all the stones into mourning, makes everything look old. The detractors of the charms of London always lay their strongest emphasis upon its fogs- 
   <p><QUOTE rend=blockquote><CIT><QUOTE>More like a distillation of mud than anything else; the ghost of mud,--the spiritualised medium of departed mud, through which the dead citizens of London probably tread, in the Hades whither they are translated.</QUOTE><BIBL>-Hawthorne. <title>Note-books</title>.</BIBL></CIT></QUOTE>
But if the fogs are not too thick an artist will find an additional charm in them, and will remember with pleasure the beautiful effects upon the river, when only the grand features remain, and the ignominious details are blotted out; or when <QUOTE>the eternal mist around St. Paul's is turned to a glittering haze.</QUOTE> In fact, if the capitals of Europe are considered, London is <num value="1">one</num> of the most picturesque--far <pb id="p.xvi" n="xvi"> more so than Paris or Vienna; incomparably more so than St. Petersburg, Berlin, Dresden, Munich, Brussels, or Madrid. 
   <p>No town in Europe is better supplied with greenery than London: even in the City almost every street has its tree. And pity often is ill bestowed upon Londoners by dwellers in the country, for the fact is all the best attributes of the country are to be found in the town. The squares of the West End, with their high railings, and ill-kept gardens, are certainly ugly enough, but the parks are full of beauty, and there are walks in Kensington Gardens which in early spring present a maze of loveliness. Lately too, since window gardening has become the fashion, each house has its boxes of radiant flowers, enlivening the dusty stonework or smoke-blackened bricks, and seeming all the more cheerful from their contrast. Through the markets too all that is best in country produce flows into the town: the strawberries, the cherries, the vegetables, are always finer there than at the places where they are grown.   Milton, who changed his house oftener than anyone else, and knew more parts of the metropolis intimately, thus apostrophizes it- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Oh city, founded by Dardanian hands, 
<L>Whose towering front the circling realms commands, 
<L>Too blest abode! no loveliness we see, 
<L>In all the earth, but it abounds in thee.</QUOTE>
 
   <p>There is a certain class of minds, and a large <num value="1">one</num>, which stagnates in the country, and which finds the most luxurious stimulant in the ceaseless variety of London, where there is always so much to be seen and so much to be heard, and these make so much to be thought of. <pb id="p.xvii" n="xvii"> 
   <p><QUOTE rend=blockquote><CIT><QUOTE>I have passed all my days in London, until I have formed as many and as intense local attachments, as any of you mountaineers can have done with dead nature. The lighted shops of the Strand and Fleet Street; the innumerable trades, tradesmen, and customers, coaches, waggons, playhouses; all the bustle and wickedness round about Covent Garden; the watchmen, drunken scenes, rattles;--life awake, if you awake, at all hours of the night; the impossibility of being dull in Fleet Street; the crowds, the very dirt and mud, the sun shining upon houses and pavements, the print-shops, the old book-stalls, parsons cheapening books, coffee-houses, steams of soups from kitchens, the pantomimes-London itself a pantomime and a masquerade-all these things work themselves into my mind, and feed me without a power of satiating me. The wonder of these sights impels me into night-walks about her crowded streets, and I often shed tears in the motley Strand from fulness of joy at so much life. ...   I consider the clouds above me but as a roof beautifully painted, but unable to satisfy the mind; and at last, like the pictures of the apartment of a connoisseur, unable to afford him any longer a pleasure. So fading upon me, from disuse, have been the beauties of Nature, as they have been confinedly called; so ever fresh, and green, and warm, are all the inventions of men, and assemblies of men in this great city.</QUOTE><BIBL>Charles Lamb to Wordsworth, <datestruct VALUE="1800-01-30"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=30>30</day>, <year reg=1800>1800</year></datestruct>.</BIBL></CIT></QUOTE>
 
   <p>Many derivations are given for the name London.

Tacitus mentions that it was already the great <QUOTE>mart of trade and commerce</QUOTE> and the <QUOTE>chief residence of merchants,</QUOTE> when the revolt of the Iceni occurred under Boadicea in A.D. <datestruct value="61"><year reg="61">61</year></datestruct>, in which it was laid waste with fire and sword. It had however risen from its ashes in the time of Severus (A.D. <datestruct value="193"><year reg="193">193</year></datestruct>-<num value="211">211</num>), when Tacitus describes it as <QUOTE>illustrious for the vast number of merchants who resorted to it, for its extensive commerce, and for the abundance of every kind of commodity which it could supply.</QUOTE> <NOTE><title>Londiniana</title>.</NOTE>

   <p>Stow says that the walls of London were built by Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, <QUOTE>about the year of Christ <num value="306">306</num>,</QUOTE> at any rate there is little doubt that they were erected in the <num value="4">fourth</num> century. They were rather more than <num value="2">two</num> miles in circumference, defended by towers, and marked at the principal points by the great gates, Aldgate, Bishopsgate, Cripplegate, Aldersgate, and Ludgate. The best fragments of the old wall remaining are to be seen opposite Sion College, and in the churchyard of St. Giles, Cripplegate   there is also a fragment in St. Martin's Court on Ludgate Hill. Quantities of Roman antiquities, tessellated pavements, urns, vases, &amp;c., have been found from time to time within this circuit, especially in digging the foundations of the Goldsmiths' Hall, and of the Hall of Commerce in Threadneedle Street. For a long time these remains were carelessly kept or not kept at all, but latterly some of them have been collected in the admirable little museum under the Guildhall. Several Roman cemeteries have been discovered, <num value="1">one</num> of them by <pb id="p.xix" n="xix">  Sir Christopher Wren when he was laying the foundation of the new   St. Paul's.   All the excavations show   that modern London is at least <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet higher than the  London of the Romans, which has been buried by the same inexplicable process which entombed the Roman Forum, and covered many of its temples with earth up to the capitals of the columns. 
    <p>Very little is known of London in Saxon times except that St. Paul's Cathedral was founded by Ethelbert, in A.D. <datestruct value="610"><year reg="610">610</year></datestruct>, in the time of King Sebert.   Bede, who mentions this, describes London as an <QUOTE>emporium   of many nations who arrived thither by land and sea.</QUOTE> London was the stronghold of the Danes, but was successfully besieged by Alfred, and Athelstan had a palace here. His successor Ethelred the Unready was driven out again by the Danes under  Sweyn.   On the death of Sweyn, Ethelred returned, and his son Edmund Ironside was the <num value="1">first</num> monarch crowned in the capital.   London grew   greatly in importance under  Edward the Confessor, who built the Palace and Abbey of  Westminster, and it made a resistance to the Conqueror which was for some time effectual, though, on the submission of the clergy, he was presented with the keys of the  City and crowned at the Confessor's tomb. He immediately tried to conciliate the citizens, by granting them the charter, which, written in the Saxon language, on a strip of vellum, is still preserved amongst the City archives. 
   <p> <QUOTE>William the King greeteth William the Bishop and Godfrey the Portreve, and all the burgesses within London, both French and English. And I declare that I grant you all to be law-worthy as ye were in King Edward's days. And I will that every child be his father's heir after his father's days. And I will not suffer that any man do you wrong. . God preserve you.</QUOTE> <pb id="p.xx" n="xx"> 
   <p>The chief events in the after story of London, its insurrections, its pageants, its martyrdoms, its conspiracies, its pestilences, its Great Fire, its religious agitations, its political excitements, are all noticed in describing those parts of the town with which they are especially connected. 
   <p>Fuller says that London <QUOTE>is the <num value="2">second</num> city in Christendome for greatnesse, and the <num value="1">first</num> for good government.</QUOTE> Its chief officer under the Saxons was called the Portreeve. After the Conquest the French word Maire, from Major, was introduced. We <num value="1">first</num> hear of a <hi rend=italics>Mayor</hi> of London in the reign of Henry II. His necessary qualifications are, that he shall be free of <num value="1">one</num> of the City Companies, have served as Sheriff, and be an Alderman at the time of his election.<NOTE>Londiniana.</NOTE>   The name of <hi rend=italics>Alderman</hi> is derived from the title of a Saxon noble, <hi rend=italics>eald</hi> meaning old, <hi rend=italics>ealder</hi> elder.   It is applied to the chief officer of a ward or guild and each Alderman of London takes his name from a ward. The  <rs type=subject>City Companies</rs> or Merchant Guilds, though branches of the Corporation, have each a distinct government and peculiar liberties and immunities granted in special charters. Each Company has a Master and other officers, and separate <hi rend=italics>Halls</hi> for their business or banquets.

The Bakers, Goldsmiths, Skinners, Grocers, Carpenters, and Fishmongers, all date from   the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century.

   <p>In the <num value="2">second</num> year of Elizabeth the pictorial map of Ralph Aggas was published, which shows how little in those days London had increased beyond its early boundaries. Outside Aldgate, Bishopsgate, and Cripplegate, all was still complete country. <QUOTE>The Spital Fyeld</QUOTE> (Spitalfields) and <QUOTE>Finsburie Fyeld</QUOTE> were archery grounds: Moorfields was a marsh. St. Giles, Cripplegate, was the church of a little hamlet beyond the walls. Farther west a few houses in <QUOTE>Little Britanne</QUOTE> and Cock Lane clustered around the open space of <QUOTE>Schmyt Fyeld,</QUOTE> black with the fires of recent martyrdoms. A slender thread of humble dwellings straggled along the road which led by Holbourne Bridge across the Fleet to St. Andrew's Church and Ely Place, but ceased altogether after <QUOTE>Holbourne Hill</QUOTE> till the road reached the desolate village and leper-hospital of St. Giles-in-the-Fields. A wide expanse of open pasture-land, only broken by Drury House and the Convent Garden of Westminster, extended southwards from St. Giles's to the Strand, where the houses of the great nobles lined the passage of the sovereign from the City to the small royal city and great palace of Westminster. From   Charing Cross, St. Martin's Lane and the Haymarket were hedge-girt roads leading into a solitude, and there was scarcely any house westwards except the Hospital of St. James, recently turned into a palace. 
   <p>After the time of Elizabeth, London began to grow <pb id="p.xxii" n="xxii"> rapidly, though Elizabeth herself and her immediate successors, dreading the power of such multitudes in the neighbourhood of the Court, did all they could to check it. In <datestruct VALUE="1580-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1580">1580</year></datestruct>, all persons were prohibited from building houses within <num value="3">three</num> miles of any of the City gates, and, in <datestruct value="1602--"><year reg="1602">1602</year></datestruct>, a proclamation was made for <QUOTE>restraining the increase of buildings,</QUOTE> and the <QUOTE>voyding of inmates</QUOTE> in the cities of London and Westminster, and for <num value="3">three</num> miles round. But in spite of this, in spite of the Plague which destroyed <num value="68596">68,596</num> people, and the Fire which destroyed <num value="13200">13,200</num> houses, the great city continued to grow. Latterly it has increased so rapidly westwards, that it is impossible to define the limits of the town. It has been travelling west more or less ever since the time of the Plantagenets;--from the City to the Strand, and to Canonbury and Clerkenwell; then, under the Stuart kings, to the more northern parts of the parish of St. Clement Danes and to Whitehall: then, under William III. and Anne, to Bloomsbury and Soho: under the early Georges, to the Portland and Portman estates, then to the Grosvenor estates, and lastly to South Kensington. By its later increase the town has enormously increased the wealth of <num value="9">nine</num> peers, to whom the greater portion of the soil upon which it has been built belongs-i.e. the Dukes of Portland, Bedford, and   Westminster; the Marquises   of Exeter, Salisbury, Northampton, and the Marquis Camden; the Earl Craven and Lord Portman. No <num value="1">one</num> can tell where the West End will be next year. It is always moving into the country and never arriving there. Generally Fashion <QUOTE>is only gentility moving away from vulgarity and afraid of being overtaken by it,</QUOTE> but in this case it is also a perpetual flight before the smoke, which still always drives <pb id="p.xxiii" n="xxiii"> westwards, so that when the atmosphere is thickest in Brompton, the sky is often blue and the air pure in Ratcliff Highway. 
   <p>In all the changes of generations of men and manners in London, the truth of the proverb, <QUOTE>Birds of a feather flock together,</QUOTE> has been attested by the way in which the members of the same nationalities and those who have followed the same occupations have inhabited the same district.   Thus, French live in the neighbourhood of Leicester Square and Soho, Italians in Hatton Garden, and Germans in the east of London. Thus, Lawyers live in Lincoln's Inn and the Temple; Surgeons and Dentists in George Street and Burlington Street; Doctors in Harley Street; and retired Indians in Cavendish Square and Portman Square, with their adjoining streets, which have obtained the name of Little Bengal.   Thus, too, you would go to look for Booksellers in Paternoster Row, Clockmakers: in Clerkenwell, Butchers in Newgate and Smithfield, Furniture Dealers in Tottenham Court Road, Hatmakers in Southwark, Tanners and Leather-dressers in Bermondsey, Bird and Bird-cage sellers near the <num value="7">Seven</num> Dials, Statuaries in the Euston Road, and Artists at the Boltons. 
   <p>The poorest parts of London also have always been its eastern and north-eastern parishes, and the district about Soho and St. Giles-in-the-Fields. So much has been said and written of the appearance of poverty and crime which these streets present, that those who visit them will be surprised to find at least outward decency and a tolerably thriving population; though of course the words of Cowley are true- <pb id="p.xxiv" n="xxiv"> 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>The monster London, 
<L><gap>

<L>Let but thy wicked men from out thee go, 
<L>And all the fools that crowd thee so, 
<L>Even thou, who dost thy millions boast, 
<L>A village less than Islington wilt grow 
<L>A solitude almost.</QUOTE>
 The great landmarks are the same in London now that they were in the time of the Plantagenets: the Tower is still the great fortress; London Bridge is still the great causeway for traffic across the river; St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey are still the great churches; and Westminster Palace is only transferred from the sovereign to the legislature. The City still shows by its hills-Ludgate Hill, Cornhill, and Tower Hill-why it was chosen as the early capital.   <num value="1">One</num> feature however of old London is annihilated-all the smaller brooks or rivers which fed the Thames are buried and lost to view. The Eye Bourne, the Old Bourne, and the Wall Brook, though they still burrow beneath the town, seem to have left nothing but their names. Even the Fleet, of which there are so many unflattering descriptions in the poets of the last century, is entirely arched over, and it is difficult to believe that there can ever have been a time when Londoners saw <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> ships at once sailing up to Holborn Bridge, or still more that they can have gone up as high as Baggnigge Wells Road, where the discovery of an anchor seems to testify to their presence. Where the aspect is entirely changed the former character of London sites is often pleasantly recorded for us in the names of the streets. <QUOTE>Hatton Garden,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Baldwin's Gardens,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>Whetstone Park</QUOTE> keep up a reminiscence of the rural nature of a now crowded district as late as the time of the Stuarts, though <pb id="p.xxv" n="xxv"> with <QUOTE>Lincoln's Inn Fields,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>Great and Little Turnstile,</QUOTE> they have a satirical effect as applied to the places which now belong to them.   In the West End, Brook Street, Green Street, Farm Street, Hill Street, and Hay Hill, commemorate the time, <num value="200">two hundred</num> years ago, when the Eye Bourne was a crystal rivulet running down-hill to Westminster through the green hay-fields of Miss Mary Davies. 
    <p>Few would re-echo Malcolm's exclamation, <QUOTE>Thank God, old London was burnt,</QUOTE> even if it were quite true, which it is not. The Fire destroyed the greater part of London, but gave so much work to the builders that the small portion unburnt remained comparatively untouched till the tide of fashion had flowed too far westwards to make any systematic rebuilding worth while. It is over the <hi rend=italics>City</hi> of  London, as the oldest part of the town, that its chief interest still hovers. Those who go there in search of its treasures will be stunned on week-days by the tourbillon of its movement, and the constant eddies at all the great crossings in the whirlpool of its business life, such as no other town in Europe can show. But this also has its charms, and no <num value="1">one</num> has seen London properly who has not watched the excited crowds at the Stock Exchange, threaded the labyrinth of the Bank, wondered at the intricate arrangements of the Post Office, attended a Charity Children's service at St. Paul's, beheld the Lord Mayor drive by in his coach; stood amid the wigged lawyers and whirling pigeons of the Guildhall; and struggled through Cheapside, Cornhill, and Great Tower Street with the full tide of a weekday. 
   <p>But no <num value="1">one</num> can see the City properly who does not walk in it, and.no <num value="1">one</num> can walk in it comfortably except on a <pb id="p.xxvi" n="xxvi"> Sunday.   On that day it is thoroughly enjoyable. The great chimneys have ceased smoking, the sky is blue, the trees look green, but that which is most remarkable is, the streets are empty. What becomes of all the people it is impossible to imagine; there are not only no carriages, there are scarcely any foot-passengers: <num value="1">one</num> may saunter along the pavement with no chance of being jostled, and walk down the middle of the street without any fear of being run over. Then alone can the external features of the City be studied, and there is a great charm in the oddity of having it all to <num value="1">one</num>'s self, as well as in the quietude. Then we see how, even in the district which was devastated by the Fire, several important fragments escaped, and how the portion which was unburnt is filled with precious memorials of an earlier time.   Scarcely less interesting also, and, though not always beautiful, of a character exceedingly unusual in England, are the numerous buildings erected immediately after the Fire in the reign of Charles II. The treasures which we have to look for are often very obscure --a sculptured gateway, a panelled room, a storm-beaten tower, or an incised stone-and in themselves might scarcely be worth a tour of inspection; but in a city where so many millions of inhabitants have lived and passed away, where so many great events of the world's history have occurred, there is scarcely <num value="1">one</num> of these long-lived remnants which has not some strange story to tell in which it bears the character of the only existing witness. The surroundings, too, are generally picturesque, and only those who study them and dwell upon them can realise the interest of the desolate tombs in the City churches, the loveliness of the plane-trees in their fresh spring green rising amid the smoky <pb id="p.xxvii" n="xxvii"> houses in those breathing spaces left by the Fire in the old City churchyards where the churches were never rebuilt, or the soft effects of aerial perspective from the wharfs of the Thames or amid the many-masted shipping in the still reaches of <QUOTE>the Pool,</QUOTE> where the great White Tower of the Conqueror still frowns at the beautiful church built in honour of a poor ferry-woman, 
<p><num value="17">One hundred and seven</num> churches were destroyed in the Fire, and only <num value="22">twenty-two</num> were preserved. Of these many have since been pulled down, and there are now only <num value="13">thirteen</num> churches in existence which date before the time of Charles II. Those which were built immediately after the Fire; however, are scarcely less interesting, for though Wren had more work than he could possibly attend to properly, he never forgot that the greatest acquirement of architecture is the art of <hi rend=italics>interesting</hi>, and the inexhaustible power of his imagination displayed in his parish churches is not less astonishing than his genius evinced at St. Paul's. He built <num value="53">fifty-three</num> churches in London, mostly classic; in <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num>, as St. Mary Aldermary and St. Alban, Wood Street, he has attempted Gothic, and in these he has failed. Almost all the exteriors depend for ornament upon their towers, which are seldom well seen individually on account of their confined positions, but which are admirable in combination. The best is undoubtedly that of Bow Church; then St. Magnus, St. Bride, St. Vedast, and St. Martin deserve attention. The saints to whom the old City churches are dedicated are generally the old English saints honoured before the Reformation, whose comparative popularity may be gathered from the number of buildings placed under the protection of each. Thus there were <num value="4">four</num> churches <pb id="p.xxviii" n="xxviii"> dedicated to St. Botolph, <num value="4">four</num> to St. Benet, <num value="3">three</num> to St. Leonard, <num value="3">three</num> to St. Dunstan, and <num value="2">two</num> to St. Giles, while St. Ethelburga, St. Etheldreda, St. Alban, St. Vedast, St. Swithin, St. Edmund, and St. Bridget, had each their single church. <num value="12">Twelve</num> of the City churches have been wantonly destroyed in our own time, and, though perhaps not beautiful in themselves, the thinning of the forest of towers and steeples, which was such a characteristic of ancient London, is greatly to be deplored. The interiors of the churches derive their chief interest from their monuments, but they are also often rich in Renaissance carvings and ironwork. They almost always have high pews, in which those who wish to attend the service may share the feelings of the little girl who, when taken to church for the <num value="1">first</num> time, complained that she had been shut up in a closet, and made to sit upon a shelf. 
   <p>Interesting specimens of domestic architecture before the Fire are to be found in the neighbourhood of Smithfield, in Aldersgate, Bishopsgate, and their surroundings. Crosby Hall and Sir Paul Pindar's House in the City; the Water Gate of York House; and Holland House in Kensington, are the most remarkable examples which come within the limits of our excursions. 
    <p>When the new London--arose after the Fire, the persistence of the citizens who jealously clung to their old landmarks caused the configuration of the former city to be observed, to the destruction of the grand designs of renovation proposed by Evelyn and Wren, but to the preservation of many old associations, and the rescuing of much historic interest from oblivion. The domestic buildings which were then erected are no less interesting than the churches, <pb id="p.xxix" n="xxix"> including as they do many of the noble old Halls of the City Companies, and private houses built by Wren. With the landing of William   III. the Dutch style of regular windows and flat-topped uniform   brick fronts was introduced, which gradually deteriorated from the comfortable quaint houses of Anne's time with the carved wooden porches which may be seen in Queen Anne's Gate, to the hideous monotony of Wimpole Street and Baker Street. Under the brothers Adam   and their followers there was a brief revival of good taste, and all their works are deserving of study-masterly alike in proportion and in delicacy of detail.   In fact, though the buildings of the British Classical revival were often cold and formal, they were never bad. 
   <p>Some people maintain that Art is dead in England, others that it lives and grows daily. Certainly street architecture appeared to be in a hopeless condition, featureless, colourless, almost formless, till a few years ago, but, since then, there has been an unexpected resurrection. Dorchester House is a noble example of the Florentine style, really grandiose and imposing, and the admirable work of Norman Shaw at Lowther Lodge seems to have given an impulse to brick and terra-cotta decoration, which has been capitally followed out in several new houses in Cheapside, Oxford Street, Bond Street, and South Audley Street, and which is the beginning of a school of architecture for the reign of Victoria, as distinctive as that of Inigo Jones and Wren was for the time of the Stuarts. The more English architects study   the brick cities of Northern Italy and learn that the best results are brought about by the simplest means, and that the greatest charm of a street <pb id="p.xxx" n="xxx"> is its irregularity, the more beautiful and picturesque will our London become. 
    <p>Besides the glorious collection in its National Gallery,  London possesses many magnificent pictures in the great houses of its nobles, though few of these are shown to the public with the liberality displayed in continental cities. In the West End, however, people are more worth seeing than pictures, and foreigners and Americans will find endless sources of amusement in Rotten Row--in the Exhibitions-and in a lev&eacute;e at St. James's.

   <p>The Thames is still the greatest highway in London, formerly it was the only highway; for even the best streets were comparatively mere bye-ways, where the men rode upon horseback, and the ladies were carried in horse litters. It is a proof of the constant use of the river even in the time of Charles II., that Pepys makes a point of mentioning in his <title>Diary</title> whenever he went to a place <hi rend=italics>by land</hi>. The Watermen then used to keep time with their oars to songs, with the chorus- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Heave and how, rumbelow,</QUOTE>
 like the gondoliers at Venice. Howell, writing in <datestruct value="1645--"><year reg="1645">1645</year></datestruct>, says that the river Thames has not her fellow <QUOTE>if regard be <pb id="p.xxxii" n="xxxii"> had to those forests of masts that are perpetually upon her; the variety of smaller wooden bottoms playing up and down; the stately palaces that are built upon both sides of her banks so thick; which made divers foreign ambassadors affirm that the most glorious sight, take land and water together, was to come upon a high tide from Gravesend, and shoot the bridge to Westminster.</QUOTE> It is a proof of the little need there was to provide for any except water traffic, that except London Bridge there was no bridge over the river in London until Westminster Bridge was built in the middle of the last century. <hi rend=italics>All</hi> the existing bridges date from   the present century.   Hackney coaches were not invented till the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, and these excited the utmost fury in the minds of the Watermen, who had hitherto had the monopoly of all means of public locomotion. Taylor, the Water Poet, who died in <datestruct value="1654--"><year reg="1654">1654</year></datestruct>, writes- 
    <p><QUOTE rend=blockquote>After a mask or a play at the Court, even the very earth quakes and trembles, the casements shatter, tatter, and clatter, and such a confused noise is made, so that a man can neither sleep, speak, hear, write, or eat his dinner or supper quiet for them.</QUOTE>
 
   <p>The <num value="1">first</num> Hackney Coach stand, which existed till <datestruct value="1853"><year reg="1853">1853</year></datestruct>, was established in front of St. Mary-le-Strand by Captain Baily in <datestruct value="1634--"><year reg="1634">1634</year></datestruct>, in which year also Strafford's Letters relate that <QUOTE>sometimes there are <num value="20">twenty</num> of them together, which disperse up and down,</QUOTE> and that <QUOTE>they and others are to be had everywhere as Watermen are to be had at the waterside.</QUOTE> In the same year the Watermen complained vehemently to the king that the hackney coaches were <QUOTE>not confined to going north and south, but that their plying and carrying of people east and west, to and fro, in the streets and places abutting upon the river doth utterly <pb id="p.xxxiii" n="xxxiii"> ruinate your petitioners.</QUOTE> In <datestruct value="1635--"><year reg="1635">1635</year></datestruct> the hackney-coaches were limited.   In <datestruct VALUE="1636-06--"><month reg="06">June</month> <year reg="1636">1636</year></datestruct> the coachmen petitioned to be made into a corporation, so that <num value="100">one hundred</num> might have coaches and pay the king a <num value="100">hundred</num> a year for the right. This number gradually increased, but has only been unlimited since <datestruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>. 
   <p>In their early existence hackney-coaches had not only he Watermen to contend with.   Prince Charles and the  Duke of Buckingham   had brought back with them   from  Spain several Sedan chairs, and, though these at <num value="1">first</num> excited the utmost contempt, people <QUOTE>loathing that men should be brought to as servile a condition as horses,</QUOTE> their comparative safety on such rugged pavements as the streets were afflicted with in those days soon made them popular, and they continued to be the fashion for a century and a half  They were not, however, without their disadvantages.  Swift describes the   position of a London dandy in a shower- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Box'd in a chair the beau impatient sits, 
<L>While spouts run clattering o&lsquo;er the roof by fits; 
<L>And ever and anon with frightful din 
<L>The leather sounds ;--he trembles from within.</QUOTE>
 
   <p>The discomforts of the streets, however, then made all means of locomotion unpleasant: thus Gay says- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Let others in the jolting coach confide, 
<L>Or in the leaky boat the Thames divide, 
<L>Or, box'd within the chair, contemn the street, 
<L>And trust their safety to another's feet: 
<L>Still let me walk.</QUOTE>
 
   <p>Not only are the pavements improved, and the streets lighted by gas, but we have now every facility of transport. <pb id="p.xxxiv" n="xxxiv"> Cabs are unlimited, and Hansom-cabs, so named from their inventor. Omnibuses, only introduced from Paris in <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, now run in every direction, and transport those who are not above using them, for immense distances and very small fares. More expensive, and more disagreeable, but still very convenient for those who are in a hurry, is the underground Metropolitan Railway, which makes a circle round London from Cannon Street (the <QUOTE>Mansion House</QUOTE> ) to Aldgate, with stations at all the principal points upon the way. 
   <p>A pleasant way of learning <num value="1">one</num>'s London, as of seeing Rome, is to follow some consecutive guiding thread, such as the life of a particular person, and seeing what it shows us. The life of Milton, for example, would lead from his birthplace in Bread Street and his school at St. Paul's, to the sites of his houses in St. Bride's Churchyard, Holborn, Spring Gardens, Scotland Yard, Petty France, Bartholomew Close, and Jewin Street, and so by the place of his death in Bunhill Fields to his grave at St. Giles's, Cripplegate. 
    <p>No <num value="1">one</num> can consider the subject without regretting that no official care-taker is appointed   for the historical memorials of London, without whose consent the house of Milton in Petty France could not have been swept away, and whose influence might be exerted to save at least the picturesque tower of the church which commemorates his baptism, with Dryden's inscription; who might have interposed to save the Tabard Inn, and have prevented the unnecessary destruction of St. Antholin's Tower: who, when a time-honoured burial-ground is turned into a recreation-ground, might suggest that, as in France, advantage <pb id="p.xxxv" n="xxxv"> should be taken of all the sinuosities and irregularities which gave the place its picturesqueness, instead of levelling them, and overlaying them with yellow gravel and imitation rockwork, ruthlessly tearing up tombstones from the graves to which they belong, and planting paltry flowers and stunted evergreens in their place, as in the historic though now ruined burial-ground of St. Pancras.   <QUOTE lang=fr>Les Monuments sont les crampons qui unissent une gen&eacute;ration &agrave; une autre; conservez ce qu'ont vu vos p&egrave;res,</QUOTE> is well said by Joubert in his <title>Pens&eacute;es</title>. 
   <p>Dwellers in the West End never cease to regret the need of the street scavengers, who in even the smaller towns of France and Germany would be employed daily to gather up and carry away the endless litter of orange-peel and paper which is allowed to lie neglected for months, hopelessly vulgarising the grass and flowers of London parks and squares,--a small but contemptible disgrace to our city, which is much commented upon by foreigners. 
   <p>Another point which greatly requires a competent and well informed supervision is the nomenclature of the streets. Almost all the older blocks of houses have possessed an inmate or seen an event they might commemorate, and new streets are usually built on land connected with something which might give them a name; so that it is simply contemptible that there should be <num value="95">95</num> streets in London called King; <num value="99">99</num> Queen; <num value="78">78</num> Princes; <num value="009">009</num> George; <num value="119">119</num> John; <num value="91">91</num> Charles; <num value="87">87</num> James; <num value="58">58</num> Thomas; <num value="47">47</num> Henry; <num value="54">54</num> Alfred; <num value="88">88</num> William; <num value="57">57</num> Elizabeth; <num value="91">91</num> Church; <num value="69">69</num> Chapel; <num value="129">129</num> Union; <num value="166">166</num> New; go North and South; <num value="50">50</num> East and West; <num value="127">127</num> York; <num value="87">87</num> Gloucester; <num value="56">56</num> Cambridge; <num value="76">76</num> Brunswick; <num value="70">70</num> Devonshire; <num value="60">60</num> Norfolk; <num value="50">50</num> Richmond, &amp;c. <pb id="p.xxxvi" n="xxxvi"> 
   <p>The Artist in London will find much less difficulty than he anticipates in sketching in the streets, as people are generally too busy to stop to look at him. But, if accustomed to the facilities and liberality met with in Continental cities, he will be quite wearied out with the petty obstacles thrown in his way by every <num value="1">one</num> who can make an obstacle to throw. From the Benchers of the Temple to the humblest churchwarden, each official demands to the utmost, orders signed and countersigned, so that no jot of the little meed of homage to their individual self-importance can by any possibility be overlooked. 
   <p>There are many who, amid the fatigues of society, might find the utmost refreshment of mind and body in mornings spent amid the tombs at Westminster; the pictures of the City Companies, the Learned Societies or the great houses of the West End; but most of all in rambles through the ancient bye-ways of the City. There are many more, especially young men, for whom time in London hangs very heavy, and to whom the perpetual lounge in the Park must end by becoming wearisome and monotonous, and for these a new mine of interest and pleasure is only waiting to be worked. If they will take even the Walks indicated in these volumes, they can scarcely fail to end them by agreeing with Dr. Johnson that <QUOTE>he who is tired of London is tired of existence.</QUOTE> To them especially the author would say, in the words of Shakspeare-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes

     <p>Dr. Johnson said, <QUOTE>I think the full tide of existence is at Charing Cross.</QUOTE> It is the <num value="1">first</num> point which meets the eyes of the traveller on arriving from the Continent, and it may well be taken as a centre in an explanation of London. 
   <p>In <datestruct value="1266--"><year reg="1266">1266</year></datestruct> a village on this site was spoken of as Cherringe, where William of Radnor, Bishop of Landaff, asked permission of Henry III. to take up his abode in a hermitage during   his visits to London.      This earlier mention of the name unfortunateley   renders it impossible to derive it, as has been often done, from <foreign lang=fr>La Ch&egrave;re Reine</foreign>, Eleanor, wife of Edward I.,   <QUOTE lang=la>mulier pia, modesta, misericors, Anglicorum omnium amatrix</QUOTE> to whom her husband erected here the last of the <num value="9">nine</num> crosses which marked the resting-places of the beloved corpse in <datestruct value="1291--"><year reg="1291">1291</year></datestruct> on its way from Lincoln to Westminster.      More probably the name is derived from the Saxon word Charan, to turn, both the road and river making a bend here. The other crosses in memory of Eleanor were at Lincoln, Northampton, Stoney Stratford, Woburn, Dunstable, St. Albans, Waltham, and Cheap; and <pb id="p.2" n="2"> of these only those of Northampton and Waltham remain. That of Charing was the most magnificent of all: it was designed by Richard and Roger de Coverdale, with figures by Alexander of Abingdon.   The modern cross erected in front of Charing Cross Railway Station is intended as a reproduction of it.   The old cross was pulled down in <datestruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></datestruct> by the Puritans, amid great lamentations from the opposite party.

   <p>The most interesting approach to the City of London is by that which leads to it from   Charing Cross--the great highway of the Strand, <QUOTE>down which the tide of labour flows daily to the City,</QUOTE> <NOTE id="n.5.2">Blanchard Jerrold.</NOTE> and where Charles Lamb says that he <QUOTE>often shed tears for fulness of joy at such multitude of life.</QUOTE> To us, when we think of it, the Strand is only a vast thoroughfare crowded with traffic, and the place whither we go to find Exeter Hall, or the Adelphi or Gaiety theatres, <pb id="p.6" n="6"> as our taste may guide us. But the name which the street still bears will remind us of its position, following the <hi rend=italics>strand</hi>, the shore, of the Thames. This was the <num value="1">first</num> cause of its popularity, and of its becoming for <num value="300">three hundred</num> years what the Corso is to Rome, and the Via Nuova to Genoa, a street of palaces. The rise of these palaces was very gradual. As late as the reign of Edward II. (<datestruct value="1315--"><year reg="1315">1315</year></datestruct>) a petition was presented complaining that the road from Temple Bar to Westminster was so infamously bad that it was ruinous to the feet both of men and horses, and moreover that it was overgrown with thickets and bushes. In the time of Edward III. the rapid watercourses which crossed that road and fell into the Thames were traversed by bridges, of which there were <num value="3">three</num> between Charing Cross and Temple Bar. Of <num value="2">two</num> of these bridges the names are still preserved to us in the names of <num value="2">two</num> existing streets- Ivy Bridge Lane and Strand Bridge Lane; the <num value="3">third</num> bridge has itself been seen by many living persons. It was discovered in <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, buried deep beneath the soil near St. Clement's Church, and was laid bare during the formation of some new sewers. In the reign of Henry VIII. <QUOTE>the road of the Strand was still described as full of pits and sloughs, very perilous and noisome.</QUOTE> But the Strand was the highway from the royal palace at Westminster to the royal palace on the Fleet, and so became popular with the aristocracy. Gradually great houses had sprung up along its course, the earliest being Essex House, Durham House, and the Palace of the Bishops of Norwich, afterwards called York House; though even in Elizabeth's time the succession was rather <num value="1">one</num> of country palaces than of town residences, for all the great houses looked into fields upon the north, <pb id="p.7" n="7"> and on the south had large and pleasant gardens sloping towards the river. 
   <p>Till the Great Fire drove the impulse of building westwards and the open ground of Drury Lane and its neighbourhood was built upon, the Strand was scarcely a street in its present sense; but it was already crowded as a thoroughfare. Even in <datestruct value="1628--"><year reg="1628">1628</year></datestruct> George Wither, the Puritan Poet, in his <title>Britain's Remembrancer,</title> speaks of- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>The Strand, that goodly throw-fare betweene 
<L>The Court and City: and where I have scene 
<L>Well-nigh a million passing in <num value="1">one</num> day.</QUOTE>
 It was in the Strand that (<datestruct VALUE="1660-05-29"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=29>29</day>, <year reg=1660>1660</year></datestruct>) Evelyn <QUOTE>stood and beheld and blessed God</QUOTE> for the triumphal entry of Charles II. 
   <p>As the houses closed in <num value="200">two hundred</num> years ago and the Strand became a regular street, it was enlivened by every house and shop having its own sign, which long took the place of the numbers now attached to them. Chaucer and Shakspeare when in London would have been directed to at the sign of the Dog, or the Golden Unicorn, or the <num value="3">Three</num> Crowns, or whatever the emblem of the house might be at which they were residing. The signs were all swept away in the reign of George III., both because they had then acquired so great a size, and projected so far over the street, and because on a windy day they were blown to and fro with horrible creaking and groaning, and were often torn off and thrown down, killing the foot-passengers in their fall. Many old London signs are preserved in the City Museum of the Guildhall, and are very curious. The persons who lived in the houses so distinguished were frequently <pb id="p.8" n="8"> surnamed from their signs. Thus the famous Thomas h Becket was in his youth called <QUOTE>Thomas of the Snipe,</QUOTE> from the emblem of the house where he was born. 
   <p><num value="1">One</num> only of the great Strand palaces has survived entire to our own time. We have all of us seen and mourned over Northumberland House, <num value="1">one</num> of the noblest Jacobean buildings in England, and the most picturesque feature of London. The original design was by Jansen, but it was altered by Inigo Jones, and from the plans of the latter the house was begun (in <datestruct value="1603--"><year reg="1603">1603</year></datestruct>) by Henry Howard, Earl of Northampton, who was ridiculed for building so large a residence in the then country village of Charing. He bequeathed it to his nephew, the Earl of Suffolk, who was the builder of Audley End, and who finished the garden side of the house. It was then called Suffolk House, but changed its name (in <datestruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct>) when Elizabeth, daughter of the <num value="2">second</num> Earl of Suffolk, married Algernon Percy, <num value="10">tenth</num> Earl of Northumberland. On his death it passed to his daughter, Lady Elizabeth Percy, who was twice a widow and <num value="3">three</num> times a wife before she was <num value="17">seventeen</num>. Her <num value="3">third</num> husband was Charles Seymour, commonly called the proud Duke of Somerset, who was <num value="1">one</num> of the chief figures in the pageants and politics of <num value="6">six</num> reigns, having supported the chief mourner at the funeral of Charles II., and carried the orb at the coronation of George II.   It was this Duke who never allowed his daughters to sit down in his presence, even when they were nursing him for days and weeks together, in his <num value="87">eighty-seventh</num> year at Northumberland House, and who omitted <num value="1">one</num> of his daughters in his will because he caught her involuntarily napping by his bedside. In his last years his punctiliousness so little decreased that when <pb id="p.9" n="9"> his <num value="2">second</num> wife, Lady Charlotte Finch, once ventured to pat him playfully on the shoulder, he turned round upon her with, <QUOTE>Madam, my <num value="1">first</num> wife was a Percy, and she would never have taken such a liberty.</QUOTE> It was a son of this proud Duke who was created Earl of Northumberland, with remainder to his only daughter, who married Sir Hugh Smithson, created Duke of Northumberland in <datestruct value="1766--"><year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct>. Added to, and altered at different periods, the greater part of the house, though charming as a residence, was architecturally unimportant. But when it was partially rebuilt, the original features of the Strand front had always been preserved-and as we saw its beautiful gateway, so with the exception of a few additional ornaments, Inigo Jones designed it. The balustrade was originally formed by an inscription in capital letters, as at Audley End and Temple Newsam, and it is recorded that the fall of <num value="1">one</num> of these letters killed a spectator as the funeral of Anne of Denmark was passing. High above the porch stood for a <num value="125">hundred and twenty-five</num> years a leaden lion, the crest of the Percies (now removed to Syon House); and it was a favourite question, which few could answer right, which way the familiar animal's tail pointed. Of all the barbarous and ridiculous injuries by which London has been wantonly mutilated within the last few years, the destruction of Northumberland House has been the greatest. The removal of some ugly houses on the west, and the sacrifice of a corner of the garden, might have given a better turn to the street now called Northumberland Avenue, and have saved the finest great historical house in London, <QUOTE>commenced by a Howard, continued by a Percy, and completed by a Seymour</QUOTE> --the house in which the restoration of the <pb id="p.10" n="10"> monarchy was successfully planned in <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct> in the secret conferences of General Monk. 
   <p>It is just beyond the now melancholy site of Northumberland House that we enter upon what is still called <QUOTE>the Strand.</QUOTE> If we could linger, as we might in the early morning, when there would be no great traffic to hinder us, we should see that, even now, the great street is far from unpicturesque. Its houses, projecting, receding, still ornamented here and there with bow-windows, sometimes with a little sculpture or pargetting work, present a very broken outline to the sky; and, at the end, in the blue haze which is so beautiful on a fine day in London, rises the Flemish-looking steeple of St. Mary le Strand with the light streaming through its open pillars. 
   <p>The Strand palaces are gone now.   In Italian cities, which love their reminiscences and guard them, their sites would be marked by inscribed tablets let into the later houses.   This is not the way with Englishmen; yet, even in England, they have their own commemoration, and in the Strand the old houses and the old residents have their record in the names of the adjoining streets on either side the way.   Gay, calling upon his friend Fortescue to walk west with him from Temple Bar, thus alludes to them:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Come, Fortescue, sincere, experienced friend, 
<L>Thy briefs, thy deeds, and e'en thy fees suspend;

<L>Through the long Strand together let us stray. 
<L>With thee conversing, I forget the way.

<L>Whose building to the slimy shore extends; 
<L>Here Arundel's famed structure rear'd its frame, 
<L>The street alone retains the empty name. <pb id="p.11" n="11">

<L>The colour'd prints of Overton appear. 
<L>Where statues breathed, the works of Phidias' hands, 
<L>A wooden pump, or lonely watchhouse stands. 
<L>There Essex&rsquo; stately pile adorn'd the shore, 
<L>There Cecil's, Bedford's, Villiers's,--now no more.</QUOTE>
 
   <p><rs type=subject>Charing Cross Railway Station</rs>, in front of which a copy of the ancient Cross of Queen Eleanor has been recently erected by <hi rend=italic>E.

The Hungerford Suspension Bridge which here crossed the Thames now spans the tremendous chasm beneath St. Vincent's Rocks at Clifton. 
   <p>We must turn to the right, immediately beyond the station, to visit the remnants of the famous palace known as York House. The Archbishops of York had been without any town house after York Place, now Whitehall, was taken away from them by Wolsey, and this site, previously occupied by the Inn of the Bishops of Norwich, was given to them by Mary. The Archbishops, however, scarcely ever lived here. They let it to the Lords Keepers of the Great Seal, and thus it was that Sir Nicholas Bacon came to reside at York House, and that his son, the great Lord Bacon, was born here in <datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>. He in his turn lived here as Chancellor, and was greatly attached to the place; for when the Duke <pb id="p.12" n="12"> of Lennox wished him to sell his interest in it, he answered, <QUOTE>For this you will pardon me, York House is the house where my father died, and where I <num value="1">first</num> breathed, and there   I will yield my last breath, please God and the king.</QUOTE>

 He sold York House and its gardens for building purposes, at the same time buying property in Dowgate, but insisted as a condition of purchase that he should be commemorated in the names of the streets erected on his former property, and this quaint memorial of him still remains in the names of George Street, Villiers Street, with Duke Street and Buckingham Street, formerly connected by Of Lane-George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham.

   <p>Immediately behind the gate is, at the end of Buckingham Street on the left, the only remaining portion of the house of the Duke of Buckingham. It is now used for the Charity Organization Society, but retains its old ceilings, decorated with roses and apples magnificently raised in stucco of extraordinary bold design; and, in the centre, pictures, perhaps by Verrio, of Spring and Summer. Peter the Great lived in the upper part of this house when he was in England, and used to spend his evenings here with Lord Caermarthen, drinking hot brandy with pepper in it; and here also Dickens, who lived here for some time himself, makes his David Copperfield reside in <QUOTE>a singularly desirable, compact set of chambers, forming a genteel residence for a young gentleman.</QUOTE> The house on the other side the way, upon which the windows of this old house looked out, was occupied by Samuel Pepys.

 Southampton Street--where phosphorus was <num value="1">first</num> manufactured in England-leads into <rs type=subject>Covent Garden</rs>, a space which, as early as <datestruct value="1222"><year reg="1222">1222</year></datestruct>, under the name of Frire Pye Garden, was the convent garden of Westminster, and which through all the changes of time and place has ever remained sacred to the fruits and flowers of its early existence, so that, though they are no longer growing, it has never lost its old name of <QUOTE>garden.</QUOTE> At the Dissolution Edward VI. granted the garden to his uncle the Protector Somerset, but, reverting <pb id="p.20" n="20"> to the crown on his attainder, it was afterwards granted, with the <num value="7">seven</num> acres called Long Acre, to John, Earl of Bedford, who built his town-house on the site now occupied by Southampton Street. It was not till <datestruct value="1621"><year reg="1621">1621</year></datestruct> that the houses around the square were built from designs of Inigo Jones, but then, and long afterwards, the market continued to be held under the shade of what Stow calls <QUOTE>a grotto of trees,</QUOTE> hanging over the wall of the grounds of Bedford House (now commemorated in Bedford Street), which bounded Covent Garden on the south. Many allusions in the works of the poets of Charles II.'s time show that this, which Sydney Smith calls <QUOTE>the amorous and herbivorous parish of Covent Garden,</QUOTE> was then <num value="1">one</num> of the most fashionable quarters of London--in fact, that it was the Belgrave Square of the Stuarts, and it will always be classic ground from its association with the authors and wits of the last century. When Bedford House was pulled down in <datestruct value="1704--"><year reg="1704">1704</year></datestruct>, the market gradually, by the increasing traffic, became pushed into the middle of the area, and finally has usurped the whole, though a print by Sutton Nichols shows that as late as <num value="8100">8100</num> it only consisted of a few sheds. 
   <p>The north and east sides of the market are still occupied by the arcade, <num value="1">first</num> called <QUOTE>the Portico Walk,</QUOTE> but which has long borne the quaint name of <hi rend=italics>Piazza</hi>, an open corridor like those which line the streets of Italian towns. It is common-place enough   now   with ugly   plastered columns, but when originally built by Inigo Jones, was highly picturesque, with its carved grey stone pillars relieved upon a red brick front. There is an odd evidence of the popularity of the piazza in the time of Charles II., James II., and William III., in the fact that <QUOTE>piazza</QUOTE> was <pb id="p.21" n="21"> chosen as the favourite name for the foundling children of the parish. The registers abound in such names as Peter Piazza, Mary Piazza, and Paul Piazza. It was the custom in those days to lay all foundling children at the doors of the unfortunate Bishop of Durham, and leave them there. In the last century the square was used for the football matches, which are described by Gay:--

   <p>When St. Martin-in-the-Felds became too small for its parishioners, Francis, <num value="5">fifth</num> Earl of Bedford, to whom all this neighbourhood belonged, desired Inigo Jones to build him a chapel in Covent Garden, but said that he would not go to any expense about it--in short, that it must be little better than a barn. <QUOTE>Then it shall be the handsomest barn in England,</QUOTE> said Inigo Jones, and he built <rs type=subject>St. Paul's, Covent Garden</rs> (always interesting as the <num value="1">first</num> important Protestant church raised in England), which exactly fulfils his promise.

The most serious defect is that this portico leads to nothing, for, in order to have the altar to the east, the entrance is at the side, and the altar behind the portico.

   <p>Beyond the wide opening of Wellington Street are the buildings of <rs type=subject>Somerset House</rs>, erected from the stately plans of Sir William   Chambers, <datestruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></datestruct>-<num value="86">86</num>.   The river front is <num value="600">six hundred</num> feet in length.   This building, now of little interest, occupies the site of <num value="1">one</num> of the most historic houses in London, which was only destroyed when the present house was raised. The old Somerset House was built in <datestruct value="1549--"><year reg="1549">1549</year></datestruct> on the site of the town houses of the Bishops of Worcester, <pb id="p.34" n="34"> Lichfield, and Landaff, by Edward Seymour, the Lord Protector, brother of Queen Jane, and uncle of Edward VI. Its architecture was attributed to John of Padua, <QUOTE>devizer of his Majesty's buildings</QUOTE> to Henry VIII. The tower and the greater part of the Church of St. John's, Clerkenwell, the cloister (called Pardon Churchyard) of St. Paul's, and the chapel of Pardon Churchyard near the Charterhouse, were unscrupulously pulled down, and their materials used in its erection.   But long before it was finished (<datestruct value="1552--"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct>) the Protector had been beheaded on Tower Hill, and his house was bestowed upon the Princess Elizabeth. James I. gave it to Anne of Denmark, and desired that it might be called Denmark House, and here that Queen lay in state in <datestruct value="1616--"><year reg="1616">1616</year></datestruct>, and James I. in <datestruct value="1625--"><year reg="1625">1625</year></datestruct>. Charles I. then gave the house to his Queen, Henrietta Maria, and caused a Roman Catholic chapel to be built here for her use, which was served by Capuchin monks, and in which many of her French attendants were buried. Their vaults still exist under the present courtyard. The time of the Commonwealth was marked for Somerset House by the death of Inigo Jones within its walls (<datestruct value="1652--"><year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct>); and here Cromwell lay in state, his <QUOTE>effigies being apparelled in a rich suit of uncut velvet,</QUOTE> bearing <QUOTE>in the right hand the golden sceptre, representing Government; in his left the globe, representing Principality; upon his head   the cap of Regality of purple velvet, furred with ermins.</QUOTE> <NOTE id="n.34.1"><title>The Gazette</title>, Sept. <num value="9">9</num>, <datestruct value="1658--"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>.</NOTE>   The magnificence of expenditure on this occasion made people collect outside the gates and throw dirt upon the Protector's escutcheon at night. 
   <p>With the Restoration, Henrietta Maria, then called <QUOTE>the <pb id="p.35" n="35"> Queen-Mother,</QUOTE> returned to Somerset House, where the young Duke of Gloucester died in <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, and was taken <QUOTE>down Somerset stairs,</QUOTE> to be buried at Westminster. When Henrietta Maria left England, in <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>, she was succeeded by the Portuguese Queen, Catherine of Braganza, wife of Charles II., who used to spend her days in playing at Ombre, a game which she <num value="1">first</num> introduced into England, and who trembled here in her chapel as she heard the frenzied people shouting round the effigy of the Pope as they burnt it before Temple Bar, on the occasion of the Duke of York's marriage with Mary of Modena. Catherine restored the old palace, which had become greatly neglected, with a magnificence which is commemorated by Cowley, who extols its position:--

   <p>After Catherine left England for Portugal in <datestruct value="1692--"><year reg="1692">1692</year></datestruct>, this old Strand palace continued to be regarded as the dower house of the queens of England, but as there were no queens-dowager to inhabit it, it was used as Hampton Court is now, as lodgings for needy nobility. By an Act of <datestruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct>, Buckingham House was settled on Queen Charlotte instead of Somerset House, and   the old palace of the queens of England was then destroyed.

It is believed that the wonderfully cold, clear water comes from the miraculous well of St. Clement, which gave a name to the neighbouring Holywell Street, and was once greatly resorted to for its cures. A <num value="2">second</num> bath, in the same building, still used, and with chalybeate properties, is shown as having been constructed by Elizabeth's Earl of Essex, when he was residing hard by in Essex House.

 The <rs type=subject>Church of St. Clement Danes</rs> was erected in <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct> by Edward Pierce, under the superintendence of Wren. In the old church, from its vicinity to Exeter House, were buried John Booth, Bishop of Exeter (<datestruct value="1478--"><year reg="1478">1478</year></datestruct>), and his brother, Sir William, who died in the same year; and John Arundell, Bishop of Exeter (<datestruct value="1503--"><year reg="1503">1503</year></datestruct>).   Here also was a monument to the <num value="1">first</num> wife of Dr. John Donne, the poet-dean of St. Paul's, who preached in the church soon after her death on the words, <QUOTE>Lo, I am the man that hath seen affliction.</QUOTE> And <QUOTE>indeed his very words and looks testified him to be truly such a man.</QUOTE> It was this wife whose spirit he saw twice pass through his room at Paris, bearing the dead child to which she was then giving birth. Like all Wren's parish churches, the existing building depends entirely upon its <pb id="p.42" n="42"> steeple, which is built in several stories, for its reputation. Its bells chime merrily, even to a proverb- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Oranges and lemons,

but the chimes can also play the Old Hundredth Psalm and other tunes.

In the vestry house is a painting executed for the church as an altar-piece, by Kent the landscape gardener, intended to represent a choir of angels playing in chorus. In <datestruct value="1725--"><year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct> an order was issued by Bishop Gibson for its removal on account of its being supposed to contain surreptitious portraits of the Pretender's wife and children.

   <p>Of the strange name, St. Clement Danes, various explanations are given. Stow tells how the body of Harold, the illegitimate son of King Canute, buried at Westminster after a reign of <num value="3">three</num> years, was exhumed by his successor, the legitimate Hardicanute, and thrown ignominiously into the Thames, and how a fisherman, seeing it floating upon the river, took it up and buried it reverently on this spot. This is the more picturesque story; but perhaps that of Strype is more likely, who says that when Alfred expelled the remnant of the Danish nation in <datestruct value="1886--"><year reg="1886">1886</year></datestruct>, those who had married English wives were still permitted to live here, whence the name-St. Clement Danes.

   <p>We now come to <rs type=subject>Essex Street</rs>, where Dr. King in his Anecdotes of his own Time describes his presentation to Prince Charles Edward in <datestruct VALUE="1750-09--"><month reg="09">September</month> <year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>, at the house <pb id="p.49" n="49"> of lady Primrose. It was the Prince's only visit to London, and he was only there <num value="5">five</num> days. The same Lady Primrose (daughter of Drelincourt, Dean of Armagh, and widow of Hugh, <num value="3">3rd</num> Viscount Primrose) gave a home in <datestruct value="1747--"><year reg="1747">1747</year></datestruct> to Flora Macdonald after her release by the government. Essex Street occupies the site of Exeter House, which was built by Walter Stapleton, Bishop of Exeter.   Here he was besieged by the people when he was holding London for Edward II., and, having fled to take sanctuary at St. Paul's, was beheaded, and brought back to be buried under a dust-heap by his own gateway. After the Reformation, Exeter House was inhabited by the   Earl of Leicester, and then by Elizabeth's latest favourite, the Earl of Essex (whose Countess was the widow   of Sir Philip Sidney), when the name was changed to Essex House.   It was here that the handsome earl tried to rouse the people against Sir R. Cecil, Sir Walter Raleigh, and other reigning court favourites whom he believed to have been the cause of his losing his ascendancy over the Queen. Here he was blockaded, cannon being pointed at Essex House from the roofs of the neighbouring houses and the tower of St. Clement Danes, and hence, having surrendered, he was taken away to the Tower, where he was beheaded. It is to Essex House that Spenser alludes, after describing the Temple, in the Prothalamion:--

 A pair of stone pillars at the end of the street, which perhaps belonged to its water-gate, are the only existing <pb id="p.50" n="50"> remains of the old house. But in <rs type=subject>Devereux Court</rs> (on the left of Essex Street), high up on a wall, is a bust of Lord Essex, attributed to Gibber.   It marks the   celebrated Grecian coffee-house, where the wits of the last century loved to congregate, and whence Steele, in the <num value="1">first</num> number of the <title>Tatler</title>, says that he shall date all his learned articles. The dandyism   and affectation displayed by the yourg students of the Inns of Court frequenting the Grecian excited the contempt of Addison (<hi rend=italics>Spectator</hi>, <num value="491">491</num>), who says, <QUOTE>I do not know that I meet in any of my walks objects which move both my spleen and laughter so effectually as those young fellows at the Grecian, Squire's, Searle's, and all other coffee-houses adjacent to the law, who rise early <pb id="p.51" n="51"> for no other purpose but to publish their laziness. <num value="1">One</num> would think these young virtuosos take a gay cap and slippers, with a scarf and party-coloured gown, to be the ensigns of dignity; for the vain things approach each other with an air which shows they regard <num value="1">one</num> another for their vestments.</QUOTE> 
   <p><rs type=subject>Palsgraves Place</rs>, the next entry on the right of the Strand, marks the site of the <QUOTE>Palsgrave's Head Tavern,</QUOTE> which commemorated the marriage of Frederick, Palsgrave of the Rhine, with Elizabeth, eldest daughter of James I. Ship Yard, opposite, destroyed in building the Law Courts, was a relic of Sir Francis Drake, as containing the Tavern which took as its sign the ship in which he circumnavigated the world. 
   <p>We now arrive where, black and grimy, in much sooty dignity, Temple Bar still ends the Strand, and marks the division between the City of London and the Liberty of Westminster. It was never a city gate, but as defining the City bounds, was, according to ancient custom, invariably closed, and only then, when a sovereign approached the City on some public occasion. When the monarch arrived, <num value="1">one</num> herald sounded a trumpet, another herald knocked, a parley ensued, the gates were flung open, and the Lord Mayor presented the sword of the City to the sovereign, who returned it to him again. Thus it was at the old Temple Bar with Elizabeth when she went to return thanks at St. Paul's for the destruction of the Armada; so it was with Cromwell when he went to dine in state in the City in <datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct> ; so with Queen Anne after the battle of Blenheim; so with Queen Victoria when she has gone to the City in state. 
   <p>Strype says that <QUOTE>anciently there were only posts, rails, <pb id="p.52" n="52"> and a chain</QUOTE> at Temple Bar.

In the time of Henry VII. it is believed that a wooden edifice was erected, and was the gate beneath which the bier of Elizabeth of York, on its way from the Tower to Westminster, was sprinkled with holy water by the abbots of Bermondsey and Westminster. We know that it was <QUOTE>newly paynted and repayred</QUOTE> for the coronation of Anne Boleyn (<datestruct value="1533--"><year reg="1533">1533</year></datestruct>), and that it was <QUOTE>painted and fashioned with battlements and buttresses of various colours, richly hung with cloth of arras, and garnished with <num value="14">fourteen</num> standards of flags</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1547--"><year reg="1547">1547</year></datestruct>) for the coronation of Edward VI.<NOTE id="n.52.1">Stow</NOTE>
It was by this <QUOTE>Tempull Barre</QUOTE> that Sir Thomas Wyatt was taken prisoner. Being summoned to surrender, he said he would do so to a gentleman, when Sir Maurice Berkeley rode up, and <QUOTE>bade him lepe up behind him, and so he was carried to Westminster.</QUOTE> 
   <p>The present Temple Bar was built in <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>. Charles II. promised (but never paid) a large contribution towards it from   the revenue he received from   licensing the then newly invented hackney coaches. Sir Christopher Wren was the architect and Joshua Marshall the mason. Bushell, a sculptor who died mad in <datestruct value="1701--"><year reg="1701">1701</year></datestruct>, was employed to adorn it with <num value="4">four</num> feeble statues, those on the west representing Charles I. and Charles II., those on the east Elizabeth and James I. 
   <p>The statue of the popular Elizabeth used annually to receive an ovation on the anniversary of her accession, which was kept as the chief festival of Protestantism, till after <pb id="p.53" n="53"> the coming of William   III., when Protestant ardour was transferred to Guy Fawkes' day. Roger North, in his <title>Examen,</title> describes how the statue was provided every <datestruct VALUE="-11-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct> with a wreath of gilded laurel and a golden shield with the motto- <QUOTE>The.

   <p>No <num value="1">one</num> sees Temple Bar without connecting it with the human remains-dried by summer heats, and beaten and occasionally hurled to the ground by winter storms --by which it was so long surmounted.

Walpole afterwards saw their heads on Temple Bar, and says that people used to make a trade of letting out spy-glasses to look at them at a halfpenny a look. The spikes which supported the heads were only removed in the present century. It was in front of the Bar that. the miserable Titus Oates stood in the pillory, pelted with dead cats and rotten eggs, and that De Foe, placed in the pillory for a libel on the Government, stood there enjoying a perfect ovation from the people, who drank his health as they hung the pillory with flowers.

   <p>With the removal of Temple Bar an immensity of the associations of the past will be swept away. Almost all the well-known authors of the last <num value="2">two</num> centuries.have somehow had occasion to mention it. Fleet Street, just within its bounds, is still the centre for the offices of nearly all the leading newspapers and magazines, and those who stood beneath the soot-begrimed arches had to the last somewhat <pb id="p.56" n="56"> of the experience which Dr. Johnson describes in his <title>Project for the Employment of Authors</title> (<datestruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>).

<div1 type="chapter" n="4" id="c.4"><HEAD>Chapter II:  The Inns of Court.</HEAD>
 
 <p>Just within Temple Bar we may turn aside into the repose of the <num value="1">first</num> of the <num value="4">four</num> Inns of Court (Middle  Temple, Inner Temple, Lincoln's Inn, and Gray's Inn), which Ben Jonson calls <QUOTE>the noblest nurseries of humanity and liberty in the kingdom.</QUOTE> Here, beside the bustle of  Fleet Street, yet utterly removed from it, are the groups of ancient buildings described by Spenser :-- 
                              <QUOTE rend=blockquote><L part=f>those bricky towers, 
<L>The which on Thames' broad aged back doe ride, 
<L>Where now the studious lawyers have their bowers,

  The earliest residence of the Knights Templar was in  Holborn, but they removed hither in <datestruct value="1184--"><year reg="1184">1184</year></datestruct>.   After their suppression in <datestruct value="1313--"><year reg="1313">1313</year></datestruct> Edward I. gave the property to Aymer de Valence. At his death it passed into the hands of the  Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, but was leased to the  Inns of Court, so called because their inhabitants, who were students of the law, belonged to <QUOTE>the King's Court.</QUOTE> It is interesting to notice how many of the peculiar terms used by the Templars seem to have descended with the <pb id="p.58" n="58"> place to their legal successors. Thus the serjeants-at-law represent the <foreign lang=la>fratres servientes</foreign>--<foreign lang=fr>fr&egrave;res serjens</foreign> of the Templars; and the title of Knight reappears in that of the Judges.   The waiters were, and are still, called panniers, from the <foreign lang=la>panarii</foreign>, bread-bearers, of the Templars; and the scullions are still called wash-pots. The register of the Temple is full of such entries as <QUOTE>On <datestruct VALUE="-03-28"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=28>28th</day></datestruct> died William Brown, wash-pot of the Temple.</QUOTE> 
   <p>Before the Temple was leased by the lawyers, the laws were taught in hostels--<foreign lang=la>hospitia curis</foreign>, of which there were a great number in the metropolis, especially in the neighbourhood of Holborn, but afterwards the Inns of Court and Chancery increased in prosperity till they formed what Stow describes as <QUOTE>a whole university of students, practisers or pleaders, and judges of the laws of this realm, not living on common stipends, as in the other universities it is for the most part done, but of their owne private maintenance.</QUOTE> The name of <hi rend=italics>Hostel</hi> was continued in that of <hi rend=italics>Inn</hi>.   Butler, playing on the latter, speaks of

<L>Of the Inns of Court and Chancery-Justice.</QUOTE>
 
   <p>The prosperity of the lawyers, however, was not without its reverses, and such was their unpopularity at the time of Jack Cade's rebellion that they were chosen as his <num value="1">first</num> victims.   Thus, in Shakespeare's <title>Henry VI</title>. (Pt. I. Act iv. sc. a), Dick, the Butcher of Ashford, is introduced as saying, <QUOTE>The <num value="1">first</num> thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers;</QUOTE> to which Cade replies, <QUOTE>Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment? that parchment, being scribbled over, should undo a man?</QUOTE> And in scene <num value="7">7</num> Cade <pb id="p.59" n="59"> says, <QUOTE>Now go some and pull down the Savoy; others to the Inns of Court; down with them all!</QUOTE> 
   <p>In the end, Jack Cade really did the lawyers no harm, but their houses were pulled down in the invasion of Wat Tyler, and their books burnt in Fleet Street. Nevertheless the Inns of the Temple continued to increase in importance till the reign of Mary I., when the young lawyers had become such notorious fops that it was actually necessary to pass an Act of Parliament to restrain them. Henceforth they were not to wear beards of more than <num value="3">three</num> weeks' growth upon pain of a fine of <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num> shillings</measure>; and they must restrain their passion for Spanish cloaks, swords, bucklers, rapiers, gowns, hats, or daggers at their girdles.   Only Knights and Benchers might luxuriate in doublets or hose of bright colours, except scarlet or crimson; and they were forbidden to wear velvet caps, scarf-wings to their gowns, white jerkins, buskins, velvet shoes, double shirt-cuffs, or feathers and ribbons in their caps. 
   <p>The Temple was not finally conferred upon the lawyers till the time of James I., who declared in <num value="1">one</num> of his speeches in the Star Chamber that <QUOTE>there were only <num value="3">three</num> classes of people who had any right to settle in London--the courtiers, the citizens, and the gentlemen of the Inns of Court.</QUOTE> The division into <num value="2">two</num> Halls dates from the time of Henry VI., when the number of students who frequented the Temple <num value="1">first</num> made it necessary, and the <num value="2">two</num> Halls have ever since maintained a distinct individuality. Though their gateways rise almost side by side on the right of Fleet Street, and their courts and passages join, the utmost distinction exists in the minds of the inmates. 
   <p>Before any student can be admitted to either of the <num value="4">four</num> <pb id="p.60" n="60"> Societies of the Inns of Court, he must obtain the certificate of <num value="2">two</num> barristers, and in the case of the Middle Temple that of a bencher, to show he is <QUOTE lang=la>aptus, habilis, et idoneus moribus et scientia.</QUOTE> On his admission, he has the use of the library, may claim a seat in the church or chapel of the Inn, and can have his name set down for chambers.   He must then keep <hi rend=italics>commons</hi>, by dining in hall for <num value="12">twelve</num> terms, of which there are <num value="4">four</num> in each year. Before keeping terms, he must also deposit <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>   with the treasurer, to be returned, without interest, when he is called to the Bar. 
   <p>No student can be <hi rend=italics>called</hi> till he. is of <num value="3">three</num> years' standing, and <num value="21">twenty-one</num> years of age: after he is called, he becomes 
<hi rend=italics>a Barrister</hi>. The call is made by the <hi rend=italics>Benchers</hi>, the governing body of seniors, chosen for their <QUOTE>honest behaviour and good disposition,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>such as from their experience are of best note and ability to serve the kingdom.</QUOTE> 
   <p>Lectures are given at each of the Inns, which are open to all its students; examinations take place and scholarships are awarded: but a man may be called to the Bar who has not attended lectures or passed examinations, though <hi rend=italics>keeping commons</hi> by dining in hall is an indispensable qualification. 
   <p><QUOTE rend=blockquote><CIT><QUOTE>The Inns of Court are interesting to others besides lawyers, for they are the last working institutions in the nature of the old trade guilds. It is no longer necessary that a shoemaker should be approved by the company of the craft before he can apply himself to making shoes for his customers, and a man may keep an oyster-stall without being forced to serve an apprenticeship and be admitted to the Livery of the great Whig Company; but the lawyers' guilds guard the entrance to the law, and prescribe the rules under which it shall be practised.

    <p>A dull red-brick <hi rend=italics>Gate-way</hi>, by Wren (<datestruct value="1684--"><year reg="1684">1684</year></datestruct>), forms the entrance to <rs type=subject>Middle Temple Lane</rs>. The site was formerly occupied by a gate decorated with the arms of Cardinal  Wolsey, which was erected by Sir Amias Paulet while he was the cardinal's prisoner in the other Temple Gate-house, in the hope of appeasing his displeasure. 
    <p>The <num value="2">second</num> <hi rend=italics>Gate-house</hi> belonging to the <rs type=subject>Inner Temple</rs>
was once surmounted by gables and annexed to very picturesque buildings of great extent. Only a fragment of the ornamental portion remains, adorned with the feathers of Henry, Prince of Wales. A hairdresser of lively imagination has set up an inscription declaring it to have been the palace of Henry VIII. and Cardinal Wolsey, but it was really built in the time of James I., when it was the office for the Duchy of Cornwall. Afterwards it became <QUOTE>Nando's,</QUOTE> a coffee-house, where the foundation of Lord Thurlow's fortunes was laid. Some lawyers overheard him here arguing cleverly about some famous cause, and the next day he received his <num value="1">first</num> important brief. The sides of this gate are adorned with the arms of the Inner Temple, as that of the Middle Temple is with the lamb bearing the banner of Innocence and the red cross, which was the original badge of the Templars. Here the shields bear a horse, now representing Pegasus, with the motto, <QUOTE lang=la>Volat ad astera virtus,</QUOTE> but when this emblem was originally chosen it was a horse with <num value="2">two</num> men upon it, the <num value="2">two</num> men on <num value="1">one</num> horse being intended to indicate the poverty of the Templars. The men gradually became worn from the shield, and when it was restored they were <pb id="p.62" n="62"> mistaken for wings; hence the winged horse.   A   wit once wrote here:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><LG type=stanza><L>As by the Templars' hold you go,

   <p>By Inner Temple Lane we reach the only existing relic of the residence of the Knights Templars in these courts, their magnificent <rs type=subject>Temple Church</rs> (St. Mary's), which fortunately just escaped the Great Fire in which most of the Inner Temple perished. The church was restored in <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>-<num value="42">42</num> at an expense of <measure value="70000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="70000">70,000</num></measure>, but it has been ill-done, and with great disregard of the historic memorials it contained. 
   <p>It is entered by a grand Norman arch under the western porch, which will remind those who have travelled in France of the glorious door of Loches.   This opens upon the Round Church of <datestruct value="1185--"><year reg="1185">1185</year></datestruct> (<num value="58">fifty-eight</num> feet in diameter), built in recollection of the Round Church of the Holy Sepulchre, <num value="1">one</num> of the only-<num value="4">four</num> remaining round churches in England; the others being at Cambridge, Northampton, and Maplestead in Essex. Hence, between graceful groups of Purbeck marble columns, we look into the later church of <datestruct value="1240--"><year reg="1240">1240</year></datestruct>; these <num value="2">two</num> churches, built only at a distance of <num value="55">fifty-five</num> years from   each   other, forming <num value="1">one</num> of the most interesting examples we possess of the transition from Norman to Early English architecture.

    <p>Opposite the Temple, occupying a space of <num value="8">eight</num> acres, in the clearance of which   as many as <num value="30">thirty</num> wretched <pb id="p.78" n="78"> courts and alleys were removed, the <rs type=subject>New Law   Courts</rs>
are rising, with a front <num value="483">four hundred and eighty-three</num> feet in length towards the Strand and Fleet Street. They are built in the Decorated style from designs of 
<hi rend=italics>G. E. Street. R.A</hi>., with the view   of uniting all the principal Law   Courts (hitherto divided between Lincoln's Inn and Westminster) upon <num value="1">one</num> site, and they promise to form <num value="1">one</num> of the handsomest piles of building in London. 
   <p>A little farther down Fleet Street is the entrance of <rs type=subject>Chancery Lane</rs>, a long winding street where the great Lord Strafford was born (<datestruct value="1593--"><year reg="1593">1593</year></datestruct>) and where Izaak.Walton, <QUOTE>the father of angling,</QUOTE> lived as a London linen-draper (<datestruct value="1627--"><year reg="1627">1627</year></datestruct>-<datestruct value="1644--"><year reg="1644">1644</year></datestruct>).

<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Long Chancery Lane retentive rolls the sound.</QUOTE>
 
   <p>The Lane and its surrounding streets have a peculiar legal traffic of their own, and abound in wig makers, strongbox makers, and law stationers and booksellers.   In former times when the Inns of Court were more like colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, and when the students which belonged to them lived together within their walls, dined together, and shared the same exercises and amusements, the Inns of Court always had Inns of Chancery annexed to them. These were houses where the younger students underwent a course of preparation for the greater freedom of the colleges of the Inns of Court, to which, says Jeaffreson, in his <title>Book about Lawyers,</title> they bore much the same position as Eton bears towards King's College at Cambridge, or Winchester to New College at Oxford.   Now the Inns of Chancery are comparative <pb id="p.79" n="79"> solitudes: readers of Dickens will recollect the vivid descriptions of Symond's Inn in <title>Bleak House.</title>

    <p>On the right of Chancery Lane, behind St. Dunstan's  Church, are the dark brick courts of <rs type=subject>Serjeants' inn</rs>, originally intended only for judges and the serjeants-at-law   who derive their name from the <foreign lang=la>Fratres Servientes</foreign> of the Knights  Templars. The serjeants still address each other as brothers.  The degree of Serjeant is the highest attainable in the faculty of law, and indispensable for a seat on the judicial bench. The buildings were sold in <datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>, and the little Hall  (<num value="38">38</num> ft. by <num value="21">21</num>) and Chapel (<num value="31">31</num> ft. by <num value="20">20</num>)-both with richly stained windows--will probably ere long be pulled down. 
   <p>The courts of Serjeants' Inn join those of the earliest foundation of those Inns of Chancery which we have been describing, <rs type=subject>Cifford's Inn</rs>   (entered   from   Fetter Lane), which is so called because the land on which it stands was devised in the reign of Edward II. (<datestruct value="1310--"><year reg="1310">1310</year></datestruct>) to <QUOTE>our beloved and faithful Robert de Clifford.</QUOTE> It was in the hall of Clifford's Inn that Sir Matthew Hale and <num value="17">seventeen</num> other judges sate after the Great Fire to adjudicate upon the perplexed claims of landlords and tenants in the destroyed houses--a task which they accomplished so much to the satisfaction of every <num value="1">one</num> concerned that their portraits are all preserved in Guildhall in honour of patient justice. 
   <p>Farther down Chancery Lane, on the same side, is an old dingy courtyard containing the <rs type=subject>Rolls Court</rs> and <hi rend=italics>Chapel.</hi>
The latter was originally built in the time of Henry III., but rebuilt by Inigo Jones in <datestruct value="1617--"><year reg="1617">1617</year></datestruct>, when Dr. Donne preached the consecration sermon. Bishop Atterbury and Bishop Butler were Preachers at the Rolls, and also Bishop Burnet, who was dismissed on account of the offence given <pb id="p.80" n="80"> to King and Court, by his preaching a sermon here on the text, <QUOTE>Save me from the lion's mouth; thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.</QUOTE> 
   <p>It is little known that within the walls of this ugly chapel is <num value="1">one</num> of the noblest pieces of sculpture which England possesses, a tomb which may be compared for beauty with the famous monuments of Francesco Albergati at Bologna, and of Bernardo Guigni in the Badia at Florence. The visitor will at once be struck by the contrast of the tomb of Dr. John Young, Master of the Rolls in the time of Henry VIII., with the usual types of English monuments. The aged Master reposes in the most sublime serenity of death upon a sarcophagus, shaped like a Florentine <QUOTE>bridechest,</QUOTE> within a circular arch, on the back of which the <pb id="p.81" n="81"> half figure of the Saviour rises in low relief between <num value="2">two</num> cherubim. In the panel of the pedestal beneath is the inscription and the date MDXVI. The whole is the work of the immortal <hi rend=italics>Torregiano</hi>, who was the sculptor of Henry VII.'s tomb, and words would fail to give an idea of the infinite repose which he has here given to the venerable features of the dead.   Another stately monument on the same side of--the chapel commemorates Lord Bruce of Kinloss (<datestruct value="1610--"><year reg="1610">1610</year></datestruct>), who was sent to open a secret correspondence with Cecil, under the pretence of congratulating Elizabeth on the failure of the revolt under Lord Essex, and who was afterwards rewarded by James I. with the Mastership of the Rolls.   In front kneel his <num value="4">four</num> children.   The eldest son, in armour, was the Lord Bruce of Kinloss who was killed in a duel with Sir Edward Sackville. On the opposite side of the altar is the tomb of Sir Richard Allington, of Horseheath (<datestruct value="1561--"><year reg="1561">1561</year></datestruct>): he kneels with his wife at an altar on which their <num value="3">three</num> daughters are represented. Amongst other Masters buried here are Sir John Strange, of whom Pennant gives the gunning epitaph- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Here lies an honest lawyer, that is-Strange,</QUOTE>
and Sir John Trevor, Speaker of the House of Commons, who was compelled to pronounce his own conviction and dismissal for bribery.

It is ornamented by inlaid brickwork of different colours, in the style of Hampton Court, and is the only example remaining in London, except the gate of St. James's. Stretching along the front of the Inn, on the interior, are a number of curious towers and gables with pointed doorways and Tudor windows, forming, with the chapel opposite upon its raised arches, <num value="1">one</num> of the most picturesque architectural groups in London. It is upon this <pb id="p.83" n="83"> gateway that Fuller describes Ben Jonson as working with his Horace in <num value="1">one</num> hand, and a trowel in the other, when <QUOTE>some gentlemen pitying that his parts should be buried under the rubbish of so mean a calling, did of their bounty manumize him freely to follow his own ingenious inclinations.</QUOTE> But the generation which can delight in the Albert Hall and the Albert Memorial has no admiration to spare for these grand relics of architects who knew their business, and, unless opinion speedily interferes to protect it, the gateway of Lincoln's Inn will share the fate of Northumberland House, the Burlington Portico, and the Tabard, for it is doomed to be pulled down! 
    <p>The name Lincoln's Inn came from Henry de Lacy, Earl of  Lincoln, <hi rend=italics>ob</hi>. <datestruct value="1312--"><year reg="1312">1312</year></datestruct>, whose town-house once occupied its site.

There is a tradition that the Protector came thither <num value="1">one</num> day to discuss with Thurloe the plot of Sir Richard Willis for seizing the persons of the <num value="3">three</num> princes, sons of Charles I. Having disclosed his plans, he discovered Thurloe's clerk apparently asleep upon his desk.   Fearing treason, he would have killed him on the spot, but Thurloe prevented him, and after passing a dagger repeatedly over his unflinching countenance he was satisfied that the clerk was really asleep.  He was not asleep, however, and had heard everything, and found means to warn the princes.

It takes its name from Drury House, built by Sir William Drury in the time of Henry VIII. From the Drurys it passed into the hands of William, Lord Craven, who (the grandson of a Yorkshire carrier's boy who rose to be Lord Mayor) was so celebrated in the wars of Gustavus Adolphus. He <pb id="p.93" n="93"> rebuilt Drury House, which was for a short time the residence of the unfortunate Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia, to whom he always showed the most chivalrous devotion, and who is sometimes believed to have become his wife, though <num value="12">twelve</num> years his senior.

He is still commemorated in <rs type=subject>Craven Buildings</rs>, where a fresco, now quite obliterated, long represented him, riding on his white charger.

   <p>If we follow Chancery Lane into Holborn, a long series of gables of the time of James I. breaks the sky line <pb id="p.96" n="96"> upon the right, and beneath them is a grand old house, following the bend of the street with its architecture, projecting more and more boldly in every story, broken by innumerable windows of quaint design and intention, and with an arched doorway in the centre. This is the entrance to <rs type=subject>Staple Inn</rs>, originally a hostelry of the merchants of the Wool Staple, who were removed to Westminster by Richard II. in <datestruct value="1378--"><year reg="1378">1378</year></datestruct>.

   <p<QUOTE rend=blockquote><CIT><QUOTE>Behind the most ancient part of Holborn, where certain gabled houses some centuries of age still stand looking on the public way, as if disconsolately looking for the Old Bourne that has long since run dry, is a little nook composed of <num value="2">two</num> irregular quadrangles, called Staple Inn.

    <p>Nathaniel Hawthorne, in his <num value="1">first</num> visit to   London, says- 
   <p><QUOTE rend=blockquote>I went astray in Holborn through an arched entrance, over which was  <Q>Staple Inn,</Q>  and here likewise seemed to be offices; but, in a court opening inwards from this, there was a surrounding seclusion of quiet dwelling-houses, with beautiful green shrubbery and grass-plots in the court, and a great many sun-flowers in full bloom. The windows were open; it was a lovely summer afternoon, and I have a sense that bees were humming in the court, though this may have been suggested by my fancy, because the sound would have been so well suited to the scene. A boy was reading at <num value="1">one</num> of the windows. There was not a quieter spot in England than this, and it was very strange to have drifted into it so suddenly out of the bustle and rumble of Holborn; and to lose all this repose as suddenly, on passing through the arch of the outer court. In all the hundreds of years since London was built, it has not been able to sweep its roaring tide over that little island of quiet.</QUOTE>
 
    <p>Beyond the miniature Hall--<hi rend=italics>eminently</hi> picturesque, with its high timber roof and lanthorn, its stained windows and ancient portraits and busts of the Caesars--in a <num value="2">second</num> court containing some admirable modern buildings on a raised terrace (by <hi rend=italics>Whig and Pownall</hi>, <datestruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></datestruct>), of the architecture of James I., devoted to the offices of the taxing masters in Chancery.   It was to Staple Inn that Dr. Johnson removed from Gough Square, and here that--to pay the expenses of his mother's funeral and fulfil the few debts she left behind her-he wrote, what he described to Miss Porter as a little story-book-i.e. his <title>Rasselas.</title>

   <p>A   little lower down on the same side of Holborn a <pb id="p.98" n="98"> passage under a public-house forms the humble entrance to <rs type=subject>Barnard's Inn</rs>, a little Inn of Chancery belonging to Gray's Inn. Again, there are tiny courts with a single tree growing in them, and flowers lining the window sills, divided by a tiny hall with a baby lanthorn, and a line of quaint windows decorated by coats of arms and set in a timber framework. 
   <p>On the opposite side of the street is <rs type=subject>Furnival's Inn</rs>, which was called after a Sir William Furnival, who once owned the land. It was an Inn of Chancery attached to Lincoln's Inn. Its buildings are shown by old prints to have been exceedingly stately, and were for the most part pulled down in the time of Charles I., and it was entirely rebuilt in <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>. A statue of Henry Peto, <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, stands in the modern courtyard. Sir Thomas More was a <QUOTE>reader</QUOTE> of Furnival's Inn, and Dickens was residing here when he began his <title>Pickwick Papers.</title>

    <p>Very near this was Scroope's Inn, described by Stow as <num value="1">one</num> of the <QUOTE>faire buildings</QUOTE> which stood on the north side of <QUOTE>Old Borne Hill,</QUOTE> above the bridge. It belonged to the Serjeants at Law, but is entirely destroyed. 
    <p>On the opposite side of the street, close to where St.  Andrew's Church now stands, was Thavie's Inn, the most ancient of all the Inns of Court, which in the time of  Edward III. was the <QUOTE>hospitium</QUOTE> of John Thavie, an armourer, and leased by him to the <QUOTE>Apprentices of the  Law.</QUOTE> Its buildings were destroyed by fire at the end of the last century. 
    <p>Gray's Inn Lane leads from the north of Holborn to 
 <rs type=subject>Gray's Inn</rs>, which is the <num value="4">fourth</num> Inn of Court in importance.  It derives its name from the family of Gray de Wilton, to which it formerly belonged. Its vast pink-red court, with <pb id="p.99" n="99"> the steep roofs and   small-paned windows which   recall French buildings, still contains a handsome hall of <datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>, in which, on all festal meetings, the only toast proposed is <QUOTE>the glorious, pious, and immortal memory of Queen Elizabeth,</QUOTE> by whom   the members of Gray's Inn were always treated with great distinction. 
    <p>Sir William   Gascoigne, the just judge who committed  Henry V. as Prince of Wales to prison for contempt of court; Cromwell, Earl of Essex; Bishop Gardiner; Lord  Burleigh; Sir Nicholas Bacon, and the great Lord Bacon, were members of Gray's Inn, as were Archbishop Whitgift,  Bishop Hall, and Archbishop Laud.   Lord Bacon wrote the <title>Novum   Organum</title> here, a work which, in spite of  King James, who declared it was <QUOTE>like the peace of God which passeth all understanding,</QUOTE> was welcomed with a tumult of applause by all the learned men of Europe.   Dr.  Richard Sibbes, who wrote the <title>Soul's Conflict </title>and the

<p>In passing the site of Temple Bar we are in the City of London.   It separates the City from the Shire, in allusion to which <QUOTE>Shire Lane</QUOTE> (destroyed by the New Law Courts) was the nearest artery on its north-western side. We enter <rs type=subject>Fleet Street</rs>, which; like Fleet Market and Fleet Ditch, takes its name from the once rapid and clear, but now fearfully polluted river Fleet, which has its source far away in the breezy heights of Hampstead, and flows through the valley where Farringdon Street now is, in which it once turned the mills which are still commemorated in Turnmill Street. Originally (r <num value="2">2</num> <num value="8">8</num>) it was called the <QUOTE>River of Wells,</QUOTE> being fed by the clear springs now known as Sadler's Wells, Bagnigge Wells, and the Clerks' Well or Clerkenwell, and it was navigable for a short distance. The river was ruined as the town extended westwards. Ben Jonson graphically describes in verse the horrors to which the increasing traffic had subjected the still open Fleet in his day, and Gay, Swift, and Pope also denounce them; but in <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct> the stream   was arched over, and since then has sunk to the level of being recognised <pb id="p.102" n="102"> as the most important sewer--the Cloaca Maxima-of London. 
   <p>Having always been considered as the chief approach to the City, Fleet Street is especially connected with its ancient pageants. All the Coronation processions passed through it, on their way from the Tower to Westminster: but perhaps the most extraordinary sight it ever witnessed was in <datestruct value="1448--"><year reg="1448">1448</year></datestruct>, when Eleanor Cobham, Duchess of Gloucester, aunt of King Henry VI., was forced to walk bare-headed through it to St. Paul's with a lighted taper in her hand, in penance for having made a wax figure of the young king and melted it before a slow fire, praying that his life might melt with the wax.

The opposition of the rector, who placed all possible hindrances in his way, and prevented his having more than a single- candle, which he held in his hand during his sermon, only secured for him the firmer support of the people.

   <p>Here we may fancy him as Miss Burney describes him- <QUOTE>tall, stout, grand and authoritative, but stooping horribly, his back quite round, his mouth continually opening and shutting, as if he were chewing something; with a singular method of twirling and twisting his hands; his vast body in constant agitation, see-sawing backwards and forwards; his feet never a moment quiet, and his whole great person looking often as if it were going to roll itself, quite voluntarily, from its chair to the floor.</QUOTE> There is no figure out of the past with which we are able to be as familiar as we are with that of Samuel Johnson: his very dress is portrayed for us by Peter Pindar:--

It was from hence, while Goldsmith's, landlady was pressing him within doors and the bailiff without, that Dr. Johnson took the manuscript of a novel he had written to James Newberry, sold it for <measure value="60l." type=currency><num value="60">sixty</num> pounds</measure>, and returned with the money to set him free.

   <p><num value="1">One</num> of the streets which open upon the right of Fleet Street still bears the name of <rs type=subject>Whitefriars</rs>, which it derives from the convent of the Brotherhood of the Virgin of Mount Carmel, founded   by Sir Richard   Grey in <datestruct value="1241--"><year reg="1241">1241</year></datestruct>.<NOTE id="n.114.1">It contained the tombs of Sir Robert Knolles, the builder of Rochester Bridge, celebrated in the French wars (<datestruct value="1407--"><year reg="1407">1407</year></datestruct>); of Robert Mascall, Bishop of Hereford, who built the choir and steeple (<datestruct value="1416--"><year reg="1416">1416</year></datestruct>); of William Montacute, Earl of Salisbury and King of Man, killed in a tournament at Windsor (<datestruct value="1343--"><year reg="1343">1343</year></datestruct>); and of Stephen Patrington, Confessor of Henry IV. and Bishop of St. David's and Chichester (<datestruct value="1417--"><year reg="1417">1417</year></datestruct>). King Henry VIII. gave the chapter-house of Whitefriars to his physician, Dr. Butts, the enemy of Cranmer.</NOTE>     The establishment of <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest Theatres in London in the monastic hall of Whitefriars was probably due to the fact of its being a sanctuary beyond the jurisdiction of the Mayor and Corporation, who   then and ever since have opposed theatrical performances within the City.

After the Dissolution, this   district retained   the privilege of sanctuary, and thus it became the refuge for troops of bad characters of every description.

   <p>Through Alsatia, the abode of the rogues, we descend appropriately upon the site of their famous prison of <rs type=subject>Bridewell</rs>, which was demolished in <datestruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></datestruct>-<num value="4">4</num>.

It was a difficult task, but the clergyman was equal to the occasion. He wound up a commonplace discourse upon mortality by saying- <QUOTE>I am desired by the will of the deceased to mention her, and to say nothing but what is <hi rend=italics>well</hi> of her. All that I shall say therefore is this--that she was born well, lived well, and died well; for she was born a Creswell, she lived in Clerkenwell, and she died in Bridewell.</QUOTE> <NOTE id="n.117.1">In the court-room of the prison hung a huge picture of Edward VI. granting a charter for the endowment of Bridewell to the mayor. It was attributed to Holbein, but could not be his, for the simple reason that it represented an event which occurred <num value="10">ten</num> years after his death,</NOTE>
    The prison was, as we have said, founded upon the old place of Bridewell, which, in its turn, had occupied the site of the tower of Montfiquet, built by a Norman follower of the Conqueror. The palace embraced courts, cloisters, and gardens, and close against the walls ran the Fleet. It was to this Bridewell Palace that Henry VIII., after he had been captivated by Anne Boleyn, summoned the Members of Council, the Lords of the Court, and the Mayor and Aldermen, and communicated to them   that scruples had <QUOTE>long tormented his mind with regard to his marriage with Katherine of Arragon.</QUOTE> Shakspeare makes the   whole <num value="3">third</num> act of his <hi rend=italics>Henry VIII</hi>. pass in the palace at Bridewell, which is historically correct.

   <p>The name of Bridewell comes from   St. Bride's or St. Bridget's Well, a holy spring with supposed miraculous <pb id="p.118" n="118"> powers like that of St. Clement, which we have already noticed in the Strand. The well here, of which Milton certainly drank, has shared the fate of all the other famous wells of London, and has become a pump. <rs type=subject>St. Bride's Church</rs> was rebuilt by Wren after the Fire, and its steeple is <num value="1">one</num> of those on which he bestowed particular pains, though it is often not unjustly compared to the slides of a telescope drawn out. It stands effectively at the end of a little entry at the foot of Fleet Street, but it should be remembered that, owing to its having been twice struck by lightning, it is somewhat shorn of the lofty proportions which were originally given to it by the great architect (<num value="226">226</num> ft. instead of <num value="234">234</num>). Its bells, put up in <datestruct value="1700--"><year reg="1700">1700</year></datestruct>, are dear to the Londoner's soul. Wynkin de Worde, the famous printer, who rose under the patronage of the mother of Henry VII., and published no less than <num value="400">400</num> works, was buried in the old church, which also contained the graves of the poets Sackville (<datestruct value="1608--"><year reg="1608">1608</year></datestruct>) and Lovelace (<datestruct value="1658--"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>), and of Sir Richard Baker (<datestruct value="1645--"><year reg="1645">1645</year></datestruct>), who died in the Fleet prison, author of the very untrustworthy <title>Chronicle of the Kings of England,</title> beloved by Sir Roger de Coverley. In the existing building are monuments to Samuel Richardson (<datestruct value="1761--"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>), who is buried here with his wife and family, and to John Nichols, the historian of Leicestershire.

   <p>Here, in the churchyard of St. Bride, still a quiet and retired spot, John Milton came to lodge in <datestruct value="1643--"><year reg="1643">1643</year></datestruct> in the house of <num value="1">one</num> Russell a tailor; here he wrote his treatises <QUOTE>Of Reformation,</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Of Practical Episcopacy,</QUOTE> and others; and here he instructed, and very often whipped, his sister's <pb id="p.119" n="119"> <num value="2">two</num> boys. <QUOTE>Here,</QUOTE> says Aubrey, <QUOTE>his <num value="1">first</num> wife, Mrs. Mary Powell, a royalist, having been brought up and lived where there was a great deal of company, merriment, and dancing, when she came to live with her husband at Mr. Russell's, found it very solitary; no company came to her, and oftentimes she heard his nephews beaten and cry.</QUOTE> Her parents also, reports Milton's nephew Phillips, <QUOTE>began to repent them   of having matched the eldest daughter of the family to a person so contrary to them in opinion, and thought that it would be a blot on their escutcheon.</QUOTE> At length the poor young wife found married life <QUOTE>so irksome to her, that she went away to her parents at Forest Hill.</QUOTE> This visit was indefinitely prolonged, and the poet's letters remained unanswered.   He sent a messenger to bring her back, who was scornfully dismissed; but after a time Mrs. Milton's jealousy was excited by the belief that the poet was paying attentions to the   beautiful Miss Davis, and she entreated for a reconciliation of her own accord, an event which had a happy result for the Powell family as they were able to take refuge in the house of their republican son-in-law, when the royalist cause became desperate. The poet's royalist wife Mary died in <datestruct value="1653--"><year reg="1653">1653</year></datestruct>, leaving her husband, who was then becoming blind, with <num value="3">three</num> little daughters, of whom the eldest was only <num value="6">six</num> years old.

   <p>At the entrance of the passage down which the tower of St. Bride's is seen from Fleet Street, the well-known figure of <title>Punch</title> will always attract attention to the office whence so much fun has emanated since the <num value="1">first</num> establishment of the Paper in <datestruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></datestruct>. 
   <p>Bridewell was not the only prison which was waiting on the outskirts of Alsatia for its frequenters.

It is an evidence of the size of the river Fleet in old days, difficult as it is to believe possible now, that the prisoners used to be brought from Westminster by water, and landed at a gate upon the Fleet like the Traitor's Gate upon the Thames at the Tower.   It was here that poor old Bishop Hooper was imprisoned (<datestruct value="1555--"><year reg="1555">1555</year></datestruct>) before he was sent to be burnt at Gloucester, his bed being <QUOTE>a little pad of straw, with a rotten covering,</QUOTE> and here, to use his own words, he <QUOTE>moaned, called, and cried for help</QUOTE> in his desperate sickness, but the Warden charged that none of his men should help him, saying, <QUOTE>Let him   alone, it were a good riddance of him.</QUOTE> Here Prynne was imprisoned for a denunciation of actresses, which was supposed to reflect upon Queen Henrietta Maria, who had lately been <pb id="p.121" n="121"> indulging in private theatricals at Somerset House, was condemned to pay a fine of <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure>, to be burned in the forehead, slit in the nose, and to have his ears cut off. Hence, <num value="6">six</num> years later, for reprinting <num value="1">one</num> of Prynne's books, <QUOTE>free-born John Lilburne</QUOTE> was whipped to Westminster, and   then brought back to be imprisoned, till he   was triumphantly   released   by   the Long   Parliament.     The cruelties which were discovered to have been practised in the Fleet led, in <datestruct value="1726--"><year reg="1726">1726</year></datestruct>, to the trial of its gaoler, Bambridge, for murder, when horrors were disclosed   which appalled all who heard of them.   Bambidge was found to have frequently beguiled unwary and innocent persons to the prison gate-house, and then seized and manacled them   without any authority whatever, and kept them there until he had extorted a ransom.   In several cases the prisoners were tortured, in others they were left for so many days without food that they died from inanition, in others Bambidge having ordered his men to stab them with their bayonets, they perished from   festered wounds.   Hogarth <num value="1">first</num> rose to celebrity by his picture of the Fleet Prison Committee. Horace Walpole describes it: 
   <p><QUOTE rend=blockquote>The scene is the committee. On the table are the instruments of torture. A prisoner in rags, half-starved, appears before them. The poor man has a good countenance, that adds to the interest. On the other hand is the inhuman gaoler. It is the very figure that Salvator Rosa would have drawn for Iago in the moment of detection. Villainy, fear, and conscience are mixed in yellow and livid on his countenance. His lips are contracted by tremor, his face advances as eager to lie, his legs step back as thinking to make his escape. <num value="1">One</num> hand is thrust precipitately into his bosom, the fingers of the other are catching uncertainly at his button-holes.

    <p>St. Paul's has been burnt <num value="5">five</num> times; thrice by fire from heaven.

    <p>Christopher Wren, son   of a Dean of Windsor, was chosen as the architect of the new church, and on <datestruct VALUE="1675-06-21"><month reg="06">June</month>  <day reg=21>21</day>,   <year reg=1675>1675</year></datestruct>, was laid the <num value="1">first</num> stone of the <rs type=subject>New St. Paul's</rs>, which was finished in <num value="35">thirty-five</num> years. When he was occupied on St. Paul's, Wren was consulted as to the repairs of  Ely Cathedral, a building which took such hold upon his mind, that, in spite of the difference of styles, an architect may detect his admiration for the great church of the eastern counties in many details of St. Paul's, not always with advantage, as in the case of the meaningless arches which break the simplicity of the cornice in the pillars of the dome.   The whole cost, <measure value="747954l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="747954">747,954</num></measure> <measure value="2s. 9d." type=Currency><num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="9">9</num>d.</measure>, was <pb id="p.136" n="136"> paid by a tax on every chaldron of coal brought into the Port of London, on   which account it is said that the cathedral has a special claim of its own to its smoky exterior.   It will be admitted   that, though in general effect there is nothing in the same style of architecture which exceeds the exterior of St. Paul's, it has not a single <hi rend=italics>detail</hi> deserving of attention, except the Phoenix over the   south portico, which was executed by   <hi rend=italics>Gibber</hi>, and   commemorates   the   curious   fact narrated   in   the 
<title>Parentalia,</title> that the very <num value="1">first</num> stone which Sir Christopher Wren directed a mason to bring from the rubbish of the old church to serve as a mark for the centre of the dome in his plans, was inscribed with the single word 
<foreign lang=la>Resurgam</foreign>--I shall rise again.   The other ornaments and statues are chiefly by <hi rend=italics>Bird</hi>, a most inferior sculptor. Those who find greater faults must, however, remember that St. Paul's, as it now stands, is not according to the <num value="1">first</num> design of Wren, the rejection of which cost him bitter tears. Even in his after work he met with so many rubs and ruffles, and was so insufficiently paid, that the Duchess of Marlborough said, in allusion to his scaffold labours, <QUOTE>He is dragged up and down in a basket <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> times in a week for an insignificant <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound;  <num value="200">200</num></measure> a year.</QUOTE>

 <pb id="p.137" n="137"> 
   <p>That the west front of the cathedral does not exactly face Ludgate Hill is due to the fact that too many houses were already built to allow of it, the commissioners for reconstructing the city having made their plans before anything was decided   about the new   cathedral. The <rs type=subject>Statue of Queen Anne</rs>, in front of the church, has gained a certain picturesqueness through age, and the fine old railing of wrought Lamberhurst iron which surrounds it. It is historically interesting here as commemorating the frequent state visits of Queen Anne to the church to return public thanks for the repeated victories of the Duke of Marlborough. Lately the effect of the west front has, in the opinion of many, been much injured by the removal of the iron railing of the churchyard which (though not <pb id="p.138" n="138"> part of Wren's design) was invaluable for comparison and measurement, and which fully carried out the old Gothic theory that a slight and partial concealment only gives additional dignity to a really grand building.

It must, however, be conceded that the railing was <num value="1">first</num> put up in opposition to the wish of Wren, who objected to its height as concealing the base of the cathedral and the western flight of steps; and that its destruction was chiefly due to the wish of Dean Milman, who abused it as a <QUOTE>heavy, clumsy, misplaced fence.</QUOTE>

   <p>The <hi rend=italics>Interior</hi> of St. Paul's is not without a grandeur of its own, but in detail it is bare, cold, and uninteresting, though Wren intended to have lined the dome with mosaics, and to have placed a grand baldacchino in the choir. Though a comparison with St. Peter's inevitably forces itself upon those who are familiar with the great Roman basilica, there can scarcely be a greater contrast than between the <num value="2">two</num> buildings. There, all is blazing with precious marbles; here, there is no colour except from the poor glass of the eastern windows, or where a tattered banner waves above a hero's monument.   In the blue depths of the <pb id="p.139" n="139"> misty dome, the London fog loves to linger, and hides the remains of some feeble frescoes by Thornhill, Hogarth's father-in-law. In St. Paul's, as in St. Peter's, the statues on the monuments destroy the natural proportion of the arches by their monstrous size, but they have seldom any beauty or grace to excuse them. The week-day services <NOTE id="n.139.1">The services are at <num value="10">10</num> A.M. and <num value="3">3</num>.<num value="30">30</num> P.M.</NOTE>
are thinly attended, and, from the nave, it seems as if the knot of worshippers near the choir were lost in the immensity, and the peals of the organ and the voices of the choristers were vibrating through an arcaded solitude. In <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct>, Dr. Newton, as Dean of St. Paul's, conceded to the wish of Sir Joshua Reynolds, then President of the Academy, that the unsightly blank spaces on the walls of the cathedral should be filled with works by academicians. Sir Joshua himself promised the Nativity, West the Delivery of the Law by Moses.   Barry, Dance, Cipriani, and Angelica Kaufmann were selected by the Academy for the other works. But when Dr. Terrick, then Bishop of London, heard of the intention, he peremptorily refused his consent. -- <QUOTE>Whilst I live and have the power,</QUOTE> he wrote to Bishop Newton, <QUOTE>I will never suffer the doors of the Metropolitan Church to be opened to Popery.</QUOTE> It was then proposed only to put up the works of West and Reynolds-the Foundation of the Law and Gospel-over the doors of the north and south aisles, but the concession was absolutely refused, and the cathedral was left in its bareness.<NOTE id="n.139.2">See Leslie and Taylor's <title>Life of Sir J.

The aged Duke lies, like a Scaliger of Verona, deeply sleeping upon a lofty bronze sarcophagus. Around the base are the names of his victories. At the sides of the canopy, which is supported by noble pillars of the best period of the Renaissance, are grand figures in bronze, of  Courage suppressing Cowardice, and Virtue suppressing  Vice.   The whole was to have been surmounted, like the great tomb of Can Grande, by an equestrian statue; but this was opposed by Dean Milman, and the artist, the greatest sculptor of our time, was snatched away before his <pb id="p.141" n="141"> work was completed, and before England had awaked to realise that it possessed a worthy follower of Michael Angelo.

   <p>In the Crypt, not far from the old St. Paul's tombs, the revered Dean Milman, the great historian of the church (best known, perhaps, by his <title>History of the Jews,</title> his <pb id="p.148" n="148">

In a recess on the south is the slab tomb of Sir Christopher Wren, and near him, in other chapels, Robert Mylne, the architect of old Blackfriars Bridge, and John Rennie, the architect of Waterloo Bridge. Beneath the pavement lies Sir Joshua Reynolds (<datestruct value="1742--"><year reg="1742">1742</year></datestruct>), who had an almost royal funeral in St. Paul's, dukes and.marquises contending for.the honour of being his pall-bearers.

Beyond the tomb of Nelson, in a ghastly ghost-befitting chamber hung with the velvet which surrounded his lying in state at Chelsea, and on which, by --the flickering torchlight, we see emblazoned the many Orders presented to him   by foreign sovereigns, is the funeral car of Wellington, modelled and constructed in <num value="6">six</num> weeks, at an expense of,<measure value="13000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="13000">13,000</num></measure>, from the guns taken in his different campaigns. 
    <p>In the south-west pier of the dome a staircase ascends by <num value="616">616</num> steps to the highest point of the cathedral.   No feeble person. should attempt the fatigue, and, except to architects, the undertaking is scarcely worth while. An easy ascent leads to the immense passages of the triforium, in which, opening from the gallery above the south aisle, is the <hi rend=italics>Library</hi>, founded by Bishop Compton, who crowned William and Mary, Archbishop Seeker refusing to do so. It contains the bishop's portrait, and some carving by Gibbons. 
   <p>At the corner of the gallery, on the left, a very narrow stair leads to the <hi rend=italics>Clock</hi>, of enormous size, with a pendulum <num value="16">16</num> feet long, constructed by <hi rend=italics>Langley Bradley</hi> in <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>. <pb id="p.150" n="150"> Ever since, the oaken seats behind it have been occupied by a changing crowd, waiting with anxious curiosity to see the hammer strike its bell, and tremulously hoping to tremble at the vibration. 
    <p>Returning, another long ascent leads to the <hi rend=italics>Whispering  Gallery</hi>, below the windows of the cupola, where visitors are requested to sit down upon a matted seat, that they may be shown how a low whisper uttered against the wall can be distinctly heard from the other side of the dome.  Hence we reach the <hi rend=italics>Stone Gallery</hi>, outside the base of the dome, whence we may ascend to the <hi rend=italics>Golden Gallery</hi> at its summit. This last ascent is interesting, as being between the outer and inner domes, and showing how completely different in construction <num value="1">one</num> is from the other. The view from the gallery is vast, but generally, beyond a certain distance, it is shrouded in smoke.

  <QUOTE rend=blockquote><CIT><QUOTE><p>Paul's Cross was the pulpit not only of the cathedral; it might almost be said, as preaching became more popular, and began more and more to rule the public mind, to have become that of the Church of England. The most distinguished ecclesiastics, especially from the Universities, were summoned to preach before the Court (for the Court sometimes attended) and the City of London. Nobles vied with each other in giving hospitality to those strangers. The Mayor and Aldermen were required (this was at a later period) to provide sweet and convenient lodgings, for them, with fire, candles, and all other necessaries. Excepting the king and his retinue, who had a covered gallery, the congregation, even the Mayor and Aldermen, stood in the open air. 
   <p>Paul's Cross was not only the great scene for the display of <pb id="p.152" n="152"> eloquence by distinguished preachers; it was that of many public acts, some relating to ecclesiastical affairs, some of mingled cast, some simply political. Here Papal Bulls were promulgated; here excommunications were thundered out; here sinners of high position did penance; here heretics knelt and read their recantations, or, if obstinate, were marched off to Smithfield. Paul's Cross was never darkened by the smoke of human sacrifice. Here miserable men, and women suspected of witchcraft, confessed their wicked dealings; here great impostures were exposed, and strange frauds unveiled in the face of day.

The buildings, which had belonged to the Grey Friars, and which were set apart for this purpose, had been given to the City of London by Henry VIII. at the Dissolution. 
    <p>The monastery of Grey Friars, which was <num value="1">one</num> of the most important religious houses in London, was founded by the <num value="1">first</num> Franciscans who came over to England in the reign of  Henry III.

   <p><QUOTE rend=blockquote>It was market morning, the ground was covered nearly ankle-deep with filth and mire, and a thick steam perpetually rising from the reeking bodies of the cattle, and mingling with the fog which seemed to rest upon the chimney-tops, hung heavily above.

Countrymen, butchers, drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves, idlers, and vagabonds of every low grade, were mingled together in a dense mass. The whistling of drovers, the barking of dogs, the bellowing and plunging of beasts, the bleating of sheep, and grunting and squeaking of pigs; the cries of hawkers, the shouts, oaths, and quarrelling on all sides, the ringing of bells, and the roar of voices that issued from every public-house; the crowding, pushing, driving, beating, whooping, and yelling, the hideous and discordant din that resounded from every corner of the market, and the unwashed, unshaven, squalid, and dirty figures constantly running to and fro, and bursting in and out of the throng, rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene, which quite confused the senses.</QUOTE>
 
   <p>The market for living animals in Smithfield was abolished in <datestruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></datestruct>, when the new   Meat-Market was built.

   <p>Of the long line of sufferers for the Protestant faith, generally on the question of transubstantiation, in the reign of Henry VIII., perhaps the   most remarkable was Sir William Askew's beautiful daughter Anne, whom Wriothesley, the Lord Chancellor, tortured with his own hands, and who lost the use of her feet by her extreme sufferings upon the rack to make her disclose the name of those court ladies of Queen Katherine Parr who shared her opinions. The account in   Foxe   of   her death   is   too   pictorial to omit. 
   <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>The day of her execution (<datestruct value="1546--"><year reg="1546">1546</year></datestruct>) being appointed, this good woman was brought into Smithfield in a chair, because she could not go on her feet, by means of her great torments. When she was brought unto the stake, she was tied by the middle with a chain, that held up her body. When all things were thus prepared to the fire, Dr. Shaxton,<NOTE id="n.177.1">The renegade Bishop of Salisbury.</NOTE> who was then appointed to preach, began his sermon. Anne Askew, hearing and answering again unto him, when he said well, confirmed the same; when he said amiss,  <Q> There,</Q>  said she,  <Q> he misseth, and speaketh without the book.</Q>  
   <p>The sermon being finished, the martyrs, standing there tied at <num value="3">three</num> several stakes ready to their martyrdom, began their prayers.  The multitude and concourse of the people was exceeding; the place <pb id="p.178" n="178"> where they stood being railed about to keep out the press. Upon the bench under St. Bartholomew's Church sate Wriothesley, chancellor of England; the old Duke of Norfolk, the old Earl of Bedford, the Lord Mayor, with divers others. Before the fire should be set unto them, <num value="1">one</num> of the bench, hearing that they had gunpowder about them, and being alarmed lest the faggots, by strength of the gunpowder, would come flying about their ears, began to be afraid; but the Earl of Bedford, declaring unto him how the gunpowder was not laid under the faggots, but only about their bodies, to rid them out of their pain; which having vent, there was no danger to them of the faggots, so diminished that fear. 
   <p>Then Wriothesley, lord chancellor, sent to Anne Askew letters, offering her the king's pardon if she would recant; who, refusing once to look upon them, made this answer again, that she came not thither to deny her Lord and Master. Then were the letters likewise offered to the others, who, in like manner, following the constancy of the woman, denied not only to receive them, but also to look upon them. Whereupon the Lord Mayor, commanding fire to be put unto them, cried with a loud voice, <foreign lang=la>Fiat Justitia!</foreign>

   <p>And thus the good Anne Askew, with these blessed martyrs, being troubled so many manner of ways, and having passed through so many torments, now ended the long course of her agonies, being compassed in with flames of fire.</QUOTE>

   <p>To those who study the story of the executions in Smithfield it will be striking, how, in the midst of a Catholic population, the English feeling of injustice towards the victims, and indignation at the cruelty of their persecutors, especially against Bonner, Bishop of London, always made the spectators sympathize with the sufferers, and only fear lest they should be induced by terror to recant at the last.

   <p><QUOTE rend=blockquote>The people were in a marvellous dump and sadness thinking that Cardmaker would recant at the burning of Warne.

   <p>Amongst the most remarkable of the after sufferers was John Bradford, who died embracing the stake and comforting his fellow sufferer; and John Philpot, Archdeacon of <pb id="p.180" n="180"> Winchester, who knelt, like St. Andrew, at <num value="1">first</num> sight of his stake.

Rahere, returning, obtained the royal sanction for his work, which was speedily assisted by miraculous agency, for a marvellous light was believed to shine on the roof of the church as it arose, the blind who visited it received their sight, cripples went away with their limbs restored, and, the hiding-place of a choral book stolen by a Jew was marvellously revealed. Rahere died in <datestruct value="1143--"><year reg="1143">1143</year></datestruct> leaving <num value="13">thirteen</num> monks in his

The monastery was at <num value="1">one</num> time <num value="1">one</num> of the largest religious houses in London, its precincts extending as far as  Aldersgate Street. But nothing is left now of the monastic buildings, though part of the cloisters existed within the memory of living persons. The Prior's house stood behind the church, between it and Red Lion Passage.

It is an early English arch, with several rows of dogtooth ornament between its mouldings. Through its iron gate we look upon the blackened churchyard, with the ghastly tombs, of

    <p>Grand as St. Bartholomew's still is, it is only the choir of <pb id="p.183" n="183"> the monastic church, with the <num value="1">first</num> bay of the nave and fragments of the transepts.   The   choir has atriforium and clerestory, and is entirely surrounded by an ambulatory.   The narrow   stilted horseshoe arches of the apse are very curious.   Of the arches which supported the tower, <num value="2">two</num> are round, the others (towards the transepts) slightly pointed.   The general effect of this interior is greatly enhanced by having its area kept open, with chairs in the place of pews, allowing the lines of the architecture and the bases of the pillars to be seen.

   <p>It is this monastic choir, as we now see it, which witnessed a strange scene when (<datestruct value="1247--"><year reg="1247">1247</year></datestruct>) the Proven&ccedil;al Archbishop   Boniface, uncle of Henry III.'s queen, Ellinor, irritated at a want of deference on the part of the sub-prior, rushed upon him, slapped him in the face, tore his cope to fragments, and trampled it under foot, and finally, being himself in full armour under his vestments, pressed him against a pillar so violently as almost to kill him. A general scrimmage ensued between the monks and the attendants of the archbishop, and as the inhabitants of Smithfield poured in to the assistance of the former, Boniface was forced to fly to Lambeth, followed by shouts that he was a ruffian and cruel, unlearned and a stranger, and moreover that he had a wife!    The last prior was Fuller, previously prior of Waltham. <pb id="p.184" n="184"> Under his predecessor, Prior Bolton   (<datestruct value="1506--"><year reg="1506">1506</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1532--"><year reg="1532">1532</year></datestruct>), a great deal of restoration was done, marked by the perpendicular work inserted on the old Norman building. Especially noteworthy is the oriel called Prior Bolton's pew, projecting over the south side of the choir, where the prior

   <p>On the north of the choir is the tomb erected in the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century to the founder, Rahere, with a beautifully groined canopy.

Behind, in the ambulatory, are <num value="2">two</num> recesses; that nearest the east end was part of the Walden Chapel, where Walden, Bishop of London, was buried. From   a very humble sphere he rose to be Dean of York, Treasurer of Calais, Secretary to the King, and Treasurer of England. When Archbishop Arundel was banished by Richard II. Walden was made archbishop, but when Arundel returned with Henry IV., he was deposed, though he was generously made Bishop of London by his rival.

   <p>We cannot leave the   Charterhouse   without quoting Thackeray's touching reminiscence of his founder's day :-- <pb id="p.198" n="198"> 
   <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>The death-day of the founder is still kept solemnly by the Cistercians. In their chapel, where assemble the boys of the school, and the fourscore old men of the hospital, the founder's tomb stands--a huge edifice, emblazoned with heraldic decorations and clumsy carved allegories. There is an old hall, a beautiful specimen of the architecture of James's time. An old hall P Many old halls, old staircases, old passages, old chambers decorated with old portraits, walking in the midst of which we walk, as it were, in the early <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century. To others than Cistercians, Grey Friars is a dreary place, possibly. Nevertheless the pupils educated there love to revisit it, and the oldest of us grow young again for an hour or <num value="2">two</num> as we come back into those scenes of childhood. 
   <p> The custom of the school is, that on the <datestruct VALUE="-12-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, the Founder's Day, the head gown-boy shall recite a Latin oration, in praise <foreign lang=la>Fundatoris Nostri</foreign>, and upon other subjects, and a goodly company of old Cistercians is generally brought together to attend this oration; after which we go to chapel and have a sermon; after which we adjourn to a great dinner, where old condisciples meet, old toasts are given, and speeches are made. Before marching from the oration-hall to chapel, the stewards of the day's dinner, according to old-fashioned rite, have wands put into their hands, walk to church at the head of the procession, and sit there in places of honour. The boys are already in their seats, with smug fresh faces, and shining white collars; the old black-gowned pensioners are on their benches, the chapel is lighted, and the founder's tomb, with its grotesque carvings, monsters, heraldries, darkles and shines with the most wonderful shadows and lights. There he lies, Fundator Noster, in his ruff and gown, awaiting the Great Examination Day. We oldsters, be we ever so old, become boys again as we look at that familiar old tomb, and think how the seats are altered since we were here, and how the doctor--not the present doctor, the doctor of <hi rend=italics>our</hi> time-used to sit yonder, and his awful eye used to frighten us shuddering boys, on whom it lighted; and how the boy next us <hi rend=italics>would</hi> kick our shins during service time, and how the monitor would cane us afterwards because our shins were kicked. Yonder sit <num value="40">forty</num> cherry-cheeked boys, thinking about home and holidays to-morrow. Yonder sit some threescore old gentlemen-pensioners of the hospital, listening to the prayers and the psalms. You hear them   coughing feebly in the twilight--the old reverend blackgowns. Is Codd Ajax alive? you wonder. The Cistercian lads called these old gentlemen  <Q> codds,</Q>  I know not wherefore-but is old Codd Ajax alive? I wonder, or Codd Soldier, or kind old Codd Gentleman, or has the grave closed over them? A plenty of candles light up this chapel, and this scene of age and youth, and early <pb id="p.199" n="199"> memories, and pompous death. How solemn the well-remembered prayers are, here uttered again in the place where in childhood we used to hear them! How beautiful and decorous the rite! How noble the ancient words of the supplications which the priest utters, and to which generations of past children, and troops of bygone seniors, have cried   <Q>Amen,</Q>  under those arches!

John knighted Alexander of Scotland here, and Edward I. came hither to spend his honeymoon with Eleanor. This early Priory was so large that, when it was burnt by the rebels under Wat Tyler, the conflagration lasted <num value="7">seven</num> days. All the other houses of the knights in London were destroyed by the insurgents at the same time, and the prior, Sir Robert Hales, was beheaded, in revenge for his having advised the king (Richard II.) to make no terms with the commons. The Priory, however, was soon rebuilt, and Henry IV. and V. frequently stayed there, and it was there that-finding how ill it would be received by the people of England-Richard III. gave a public denial to the rumours of his intended marriage with his niece Elizabeth of York. The Order of St. John was suppressed by Henry VIII. on pretext that the knights denied his supremacy, <num value="2">two</num> of those who opposed him being beheaded, and a <num value="3">third</num> hung and quartered. But the Priory still continued to be the resort of royalty, and Mary resided here frequently during the reign of Edward VI., and rode hence to pay state visits to her brother, attended by a great troop of Catholic ladies and gentlemen. The buildings of the Priory perished for the most part when they were blown up by the Protector Somerset, who intended to use them in building his palace in the Strand.

The accounts which he gave of the marvellous powers of his friend Garrick inspired Cave with a desire to see him act, and in the old room, which is now the dining-hall of the tavern, Garrick is said <pb id="p.203" n="203"> to have made his debut before a select audience in Fielding's

    <p>Till a few years ago people frequently came to this crypt to visit the coffin (now buried) of <QUOTE>Scratching Fanny, the  Cock Lane Ghost,</QUOTE> which had excited the utmost attention in <datestruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>, being, as Walpole said, not an <hi rend=italics>apparition</hi>, but an 
 <hi rend=italics>audition</hi>. It was supposed that the spirit of a young lady poisoned by a lover to whom   she had bequeathed her property, came to visit, invisibly, but with very mysterious noises, a girl named Parsons who lived in Cock Lane  (between Smithfield and Holborn) and was daughter to the clerk of St. Sepulchre's Church.   Horace Walpole went to see the victim, with the Duke of York, Lady Northumberland, Lady Mary Coke, and Lord Hertford, but after waiting till half-past <num value="1">one</num> in the morning in a suffocating room with <num value="50">fifty</num> people crowded into it, he was told that <pb id="p.205" n="205"> the ghost would not come that night till <num value="7">seven</num> in the morning, <QUOTE>when,</QUOTE> says Walpole, <QUOTE>there were only prentices and old women.</QUOTE> At length, the ghost having promised, by an affirmative knock, that she would attend any <num value="1">one</num> of her visitors in the vaults of St. John's Church, and there knock upon her coffin, an investigation was made, of which Dr. Johnson, who was present, has left a description:-- 
   <p><QUOTE rend=blockquote>About <num value="10">ten</num> at night, the gentlemen met in the chamber in which the girl, supposed to be disturbed by a spirit, had with proper caution been put to bed by several ladies. They sate rather more than an hour, and hearing nothing, went down-stairs, where they interrogated the father of the girl, who denied in the strongest terms any knowledge or belief of fraud. While they were inquiring and deliberating, they were summoned into the girl's chamber by some ladies who were near her bed, and who had heard knocks and scratches. When the gentlemen entered, the girl declared that she felt the spirit like a mouse upon her back, when the spirit was very solemnly required to manifest its existence by appearance, by impression on the hand or body of any present, or any other agency; but no evidence of any preternatural power was exhibited. The spirit was then very seriously advertised that the person to whom the promise was made of striking the coffin was then about to visit the vault, and that the performance of the promise   was them claimed. The company at <num value="1">one</num> o'clock went into the church, and the gentleman to whom the promise was made went with another into the vault. The spirit was solemnly required to perform its promise, but nothing more than silence ensued; the person supposed to be accused by the spirit then went down with several others, but no effect was perceived. Upon their return they examined the girl, but could draw no confession from her. Between <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="3">three</num> she desired and was permitted to go home with her father. It is therefore the opinion of the whole assembly that the child has some art of making or counterfeiting a particular noise, and that there is no agency of any higher cause.</QUOTE>
 
   <p>The failure of the investigation led to the discovery that the father of the girl who was the supposed   object of spiritual visitation had arranged the plot in order to frighten the man accused of murder into remitting a loan which he <pb id="p.206" n="206"> had received from him whilst he was lodging in his house. Parsons was imprisoned for a year, and placed <num value="3">three</num> times in the pillory, where, however, instead of maltreating him, the London mob raised a subscription in his favour. The account of the nocturnal expedition of Dr. Johnson and his friends to the crypt caused great amusement; which was enhanced by the appearance of Churchill's poem   of <title>The Ghost.</title>

Since which time, workmen there, <pb id="p.229" n="229"> for their foolish pleasure, hewed off his head; and Lancelot Young, master-glazier to her Majesty, feeling a sweet savour to come from thence, and seeing the same dried from all moisture, and yet the form remaining, with the hair of the head, and the beard red, brought it to London, to his house in Wood Street, where for a time he kept it for its sweetness, but in the end caused the sexton of that church to bury it amongst other bones taken out of their charnel,</QUOTE> --<hi rend=italics>Stow</hi>, p. <num value="112">112</num>.

   <p>The   <rs type=subject>Guildhall</rs> was   originally   built in   the   time   of Henry   IV. (<datestruct value="1411--"><year reg="1411">1411</year></datestruct>), but it has   been so   much altered that, though the walls were not much injured in the Fire <pb id="p.237" n="237"> and only had to be reroofed, very little can be said to remain visible of that time except the crypt. The front, by <hi rend=italics>George Dance</hi>, is a miserable work of <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>. 
   <p>Here it was that, after the death of Edward IV., while his sons were in the Tower, on <datestruct VALUE="1483-06-22"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=22>22</day>, <year reg=1483>1483</year></datestruct>, the Duke of Buckingham   addressed the people, and after cunningly dwelling on the exactions of the late king's reign, denied his legitimacy, and, affirming that the Duke of Gloucester was the only true son of the Duke of York, demanded that he should be acknowledged as king. 
   <p>In <datestruct value="1546--"><year reg="1546">1546</year></datestruct> the Guildhall was used for the trial of Anne, daughter of Sir William Askew of Kelsey in Lincolnshire, who had been turned out of doors by her husband (<num value="1">one</num> Kyme) because she had become a Protestant.   Coming to London, to sue for a separation, she had been kindly received by Queen Katherine Parr, and was found to have distributed Protestant tracts amongst the court ladies. In the Guildhall she was tried for heresy, and on being asked by the Lord Mayor why she refused to believe that the priest could make the body of Christ, gave her famous answer- <QUOTE>I have heard that God made man, but that man can make God I have never heard.</QUOTE> She was afterwards cruelly tortured on the rack to extort evidence against the court ladies, and on <datestruct VALUE="1546-07-16"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=16>16</day>, <year reg=1546>1546</year></datestruct>, was burnt at Smithfield. 
   <p>It was also in the Guildhall that the Protestant Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, a personal friend of Edward VI., was tried, <datestruct VALUE="1554-04-17"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=17>17</day>, <year reg=1554>1554</year></datestruct>, for participation in the Wyatt rebellion against Mary, and was acquitted by his own wonderful acuteness and presence of mind. 
   <p>Here, on the other side, in <datestruct value="1606--"><year reg="1606">1606</year></datestruct>, took place the trial of Garnet, Superior of the Jesuits in England. He had been <pb id="p.238" n="238"> arrested at Hendlip House near Worcester for complicity in the Gunpowder Plot. The rack having failed to extort a confession, he was induced to believe, whilst imprisoned in the Tower, that he might confer unheard with another Jesuit, Oldcorne, who occupied the next cell. <num value="2">Two</num> listeners wrote down the whole conversation, which was produced as criminatory evidence at the Guildhall, and he was condemned to death and executed in St. Paul's Churchyard, after which he was honoured by Catholics as a martyr. 
    <p>Among the other trials which have taken place here, have been that of the poet Surrey, in the time of Henry VIII., and of the poet Waller, during the Commonwealth.

   <p>The end of Poultry faces the Royal Exchange, with Chantrey's fine equestrian <rs type=subject>Statue of Wellington</rs> in front of it. On the right is the Mansion House, on the left the Bank of England. <pb id="p.251" n="251"> 
   <p>The <num value="1">first</num> <rs type=subject>Royal Exchange</rs> was built by Sir Thomas Gresham, the great merchant-prince of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century. Under Edward VI. and Mary he had been employed as a confidential agent in obtaining subsidies from great foreign merchants, and under Elizabeth took advantage of his increasing favour to enforce the benefit of obtaining loans from wealthy Englishmen rather than foreigners. Treated with the utmost confidence by Elizabeth, he was made <QUOTE>Sir Thomas</QUOTE> when employed as ambassador to the Duchess of Parma. He continued to keep his shop in Lombard Street, distinguished by the sign of the grasshopper, the Gresham crest, but in the country lived with great magnificence at Mayfield in Sussex (previously a palace of the Archbishop of Canterbury), and at Osterley in Middlesex. He died of an apoplectic fit as he was walking from his house in Bishopsgate Street to the Exchange, <datestruct VALUE="1579-11-21"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=21>21</day>, <year reg=1579>1579</year></datestruct>. 
   <p>The idea of the Exchange originated with Sir Richard Gresham, father of Sir Thomas, who wished to see English merchants as well lodged as those whom   he had been accustomed to see in the magnificent Bourse at Antwerp. And how much something of the kind was needed in London we learn from Stow, who says, <QUOTE>The merchants and tradesmen, as well English as strangers, did for their general making of bargains, contracts and commerce, usually meet twice a day.   But these meetings were unpleasant and troublesome, by reason of walking and talking in an open narrow street . . . being there constrained either to endure all extremes of weather, viz. heat or cold, snow or rain; or else to shelter themselves in shops.</QUOTE> 
   <p>The <num value="1">first</num> Exchange, therefore, was built as much as <pb id="p.252" n="252"> possible on the plan of that at Antwerp. A Flemish architect, Henryke, was appointed, and all the materials were brought from Flanders, much to the disgust of English masons and bricklayers. The result was that the Exchange, which was opened by Elizabeth in <datestruct value="1571--"><year reg="1571">1571</year></datestruct>, was foreign-looking to the last degree. It was an immense cloistered court, with a corridor filled with shops running above its arcades, called a <QUOTE>pawn,</QUOTE> from the German word <QUOTE>bahn</QUOTE> --a way. In front rose an immense column surmounted by the grasshopper of the Greshams. Over the pillars round the quadrangle, which were all of marble, were statues of the sovereigns from the Confessor to Elizabeth. Immediately on the execution of Charles I. his statue was thrown down, and in its plate was inscribed, <QUOTE lang=la>Exit tyrannus, regum ultimus, anno libertatis Anglia restitutae primo.</QUOTE>   The Exchange of Gresham was totally destroyed in the Great Fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>. Wren then wished in restoring it to make the Exchange the centre of the new London, from which all the principal streets should diverge. His wish was opposed, and the new building was built much in the same style as the old, but with greater magnificence, by Edward Jarman, and was adorned with statues by Cibber. 
    <p>The <num value="2">second</num> Exchange was burnt in <datestruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></datestruct>, and the statues which survived the fire were for the most part sold as lumber!   The present building by <hi rend=italics>Tile</hi>, stately, though inferior to its predecessor, was opened in <datestruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></datestruct>. It encloses a large cloistered court, with a statue of Queen Victoria in the centre. The statue of Charles II. by <hi rend=italics>Gibbons</hi>, which formerly occupied that position, is preserved at the southeast angle. The inscription on the pedestal of the figure of  Commerce on the front of the building-- <QUOTE>The Earth is the <pb id="p.253" n="253"> Lord's, and the fulness thereof,</QUOTE> was selected by Dean Milman on hearing the suggestion of the Prince Consort to Mr. Westmacott that the space should be used for some inscription recognising a Superior Power. 
   <p>The busiest time at the Exchange, when it is most worth seeing, is from <num value="3">3</num> to <num value="4">4</num> P.M. on Tuesdays and Fridays. The eastern part of the building is occupied by <hi rend=italics>Lloyd's</hi>, the great rendezvous of ship-owners, and all who seek shipping intelligence.

   <p>Opposite the Exchange, on the right, we should notice an old <hi rend=italics>Shop Front</hi> (No. ZZZ<num value="11">11</num>, Cornhill), carved, painted green, and with unusually small panes of glass--as being the oldest shop of its class in the metropolis.

    <p>On the right as we face the Royal Exchange rises the <rs type=subject>Mansion House</rs>, the palace of the King of the City, built from   designs of <hi rend=italics>George Dance</hi> in <datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>-<num value="40">40</num>.

On the site occupied by the Mansion House stood formerly a statue altered to represent Charles II., from   an old statue of John Sobieski, King of Poland, brought from Leghorn by Robert Viner, the Lord Mayor,<NOTE id="n.254.1">Pennant.</NOTE>

He took it home, and showed it to Dryden, who said at once, <QUOTE>This man cuts us all out and the ancients too.</QUOTE> The street has still much of the character, though it has lost the picturesqueness, described by Washington Irving. 
   <QUOTE rend=blockquote><CIT><QUOTE><p>In the centre of the great City of London lies a small neighbourhood, consisting of a cluster of narrow streets and courts, of very venerable and debilitated houses, which goes by name of Little <pb id="p.261" n="261"> Britain.   Christ Church School and St. Bartholomew's Hospital bound it on the west; Smithfield and Long Lane on the north; Aldersgate Street, like an arm of the sea, divides it from the eastern part of the City; whilst the yawning gulf of Bull and Mouth Street separates it from Butcher's Hall Lane and the regions of Newgate. Over this little territory, thus bounded and designated, the great dome of St. Paul's, swelling above the intervening houses of Paternoster Row, Amen Corner, and Ave Maria Lane, looks down with an air of motherly protection. 
    <p>This quarter derives its appellation from having been, in ancient times, the residence of the Dukes of Brittany. As London increased, however, rank and fashion moved off to the west, and trade, creeping on at their heels, took possession of their deserted abodes. For some time Little Britain became the great mart of learning, and was peopled by the busy and prolific race of booksellers; these also gradually deserted it, and emigrating beyond the great strait of Newgate Street, settled down in Paternoster Row and St. Paul's Churchyard, where they continue to increase and multiply even at the present day. 
   <p>But though thus fallen into decline, Little Britain still bears traces of its former splendour. There are several houses ready to tumble down, the fronts of which are magnificently enriched with oaken carvings of hideous faces, unknown birds, beasts, and fishes; and fruits and flowers which it would puzzle a naturalist to classify. There are also, in Aldersgate Street, certain remains of what were once spacious and lordly family mansions, but which have in latter days been subdivided into several tenements. Here may often be found the family of a petty tradesman, with its trumpery furniture, burrowing amongst the relics of antiquated finery, in great rambling time-stained apartments, with fretted ceilings, gilded cornices, and enormous marble fire-places.  The lanes and courts also contain many smaller houses, not on so grand a scale, but, like your small gentry, sturdily maintaining their claims to equal antiquity. These have their gable ends to the street; great bow windows, with diamond panes set in lead; grotesque carvings, and low-arched doorways.<NOTE id="n.261.1">There are still such houses in the neighbouring Cloth Fair.</NOTE>   Little Britain may truly be called the heart's core of the City; the stronghold of true John Bullism.

The monastery had been granted by Henry VIII. to the <num value="1">first</num> Marquis, who is celebrated as having lived under <num value="9">nine</num> sovereigns, and who, when asked in his old age how he had contrived to get on so well with them all, said <QUOTE>by being a willow and not an oak.</QUOTE> He was the builder of Winchester House in Austin Friars, which was sold to a city merchant by the <num value="4">4th</num> Marquis, but only pulled down in <datestruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></datestruct>.

 <p>Returning to the Royal Exchange, we must follow <rs type=subject>Threadneedle Street</rs>, properly <num value="3">Three</num>-Needle Street, which belongs to the Merchant Tailors.   On the right, concealed by a row of houses (for which an annual rent of <measure value="3l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3">3</num></measure> per foot is paid), is the <rs type=subject>Hall of the Merchant Tailors Company</rs>, which was incorporated in <datestruct value="1466--"><year reg="1466">1466</year></datestruct>. It was built after the great Fire by the city architect Jarmin, and surrounds a courtyard.   It can only be visited by a special order from the Master or Clerk of the Company. The Hall is a noble chamber (go feet by <num value="48">48</num>), rich in stained glass and surrounded by the arms of the members. At the end are the arms of the Company--the Lamb of their patron St. John Baptist, and a pavilion between <num value="2">two</num> royal mantles, with camels as supporters. A corridor beyond the Hall has stained glass windows which commemorate a quarrel for precedence between the Merchant Tailors and Skinners Companies in <datestruct value="1484--"><year reg="1484">1484</year></datestruct>-<num value="5">5</num>. The Lord Mayor (Sir R.

   <p>Sir John Crosby, <QUOTE>Grocer and Woolman,</QUOTE> was an Alderman, who represented the City of London in <datestruct value="1461--"><year reg="1461">1461</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1471--"><year reg="1471">1471</year></datestruct> he was knighted by Edward IV. He obtained a lease of this property for <num value="99">ninety-nine</num> years from Alice Ashfield, Prioress of St. Helens, and built <QUOTE>this house of stone and timber, very large and beautiful, and the highest,</QUOTE> says Stow, <QUOTE>at that time in London.</QUOTE> But he died in <datestruct value="1475--"><year reg="1475">1475</year></datestruct>; so that he only enjoyed his palace for a short time. 
   <p>It was here, says Sir Thomas More, that Richard, Duke of Gloucester, <QUOTE>lodged himself, and little by little all folks drew unto him, so that the Protector's court was crowded <pb id="p.283" n="283"> and King Edward's left desolate,</QUOTE> and it was in the hall which we now see that he planned the deposition, most probably the death, of his nephew.   Shakspeare knew Crosby Hall well, for we know from the parish assessments that he was residing in <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct> in St. Helens, where, from the sum levied, he must have inhabited a house of importance. He introduces Crosby Hall as the place where Richard induced Anne of Warwick to await his return from the funeral of her father-in-law, the murdered Henry VI., and he otherwise twice mentions it in his play of <hi rend=italics>Richard III.</hi>, to which fact it is probable that we owe the preservation of the grand old house, amongst the vicissitudes which have attended other historical buildings. 
    <p>Sir Thomas More lived here for some years; and here, without doubt, wrote his Life of Richard III. In <datestruct value="1523--"><year reg="1523">1523</year></datestruct> he sold it to the man whom   he himself describes as his <QUOTE>dearest friend,</QUOTE> Antonio Bonvisi, an Italian merchant of Lucca, who was settled in London. It was to this Bonvisi that he wrote a last touching letter with charcoal from the Tower, and, on the morning of his execution, the dress he put on was the <QUOTE>silk camlet gown given him by his entire good friend M. Antonio Bonvisi.</QUOTE> It would seem that after Sir Thomas More's execution his.devoted daughter Margaret longed to return to a place so much connected with her father's sacred life, and in <datestruct value="1547--"><year reg="1547">1547</year></datestruct> Bonvisi leased Crosby Hall to More's son-in-law, William Roper, and to his nephew, William Rastell, who was an eminent printer. By the religious persecutions under Edward VI., Bonvisi, Roper, and Rastell were all obliged to go abroad, but they returned under Mary. The next proprietor of the house was Alderman Bond, who added a turret to it, and died <pb id="p.284" n="284"> here in <datestruct value="1576--"><year reg="1576">1576</year></datestruct>.   The rich Mayor of London, Sir John Spencer, bought Crosby Place in <datestruct value="1594--"><year reg="1594">1594</year></datestruct>, and during his occupation M. de Rosny, afterwards Duc de Sully, the minister of Henry IV., was received here as ambassador, when he came over to persuade James I. to preserve the league which had existed between Elizabeth, France, and the Hollanders, and not to make war with Catholic Spain. In his Memoirs he gives a curious account of a scene which occurred here in the great hall during his visit. Previous ambassadors had brought great disrepute upon their country through the excesses committed in London by members of their suite, and of these he was determined to prevent a recurrence. To his horror, upon the very evening of his arrival, he discovered that <num value="1">one</num> of his attendants, going out to amuse himself, had murdered an English merchant in a brawl in Great St. Helen's.   He immediately made the whole of his companions and servants range themselves against the wall; and taking a lighted flambeau, he walked up to each in turn, and, throwing the light full upon them, scrutinised their faces. By his trembling and his livid paleness it was soon disclosed that a noble young gentleman, son of the Sieur de Combaut, was the culprit. He was related to the French Ambassador M. de Beaumont, who demanded, urged, and entreated his pardon, but in vain. Sully declared that Combaut should be beheaded in a few minutes. He was finally induced to give him up to the Mayor, who saved his life; but his severity, says Sully, had this consequence, that <QUOTE>the English began to love, and the French to fear him more.</QUOTE> 
   <p>Sir John Spencer, having but a poor opinion of the Compton family in that day, positively forbade the <num value="1">first</num> <pb id="p.285" n="285"> Earl of Northampton to pay his addresses to his daughter, who was the greatest heiress in England. <num value="1">One</num> day, at the foot of the staircase, Sir John met the baker's boy with his covered barrow, and, being pleased at his having come punctually when he was ordered, he gave him sixpence; but the baker's boy was Lord Northampton in disguise, and in the covered barrow   he was carrying off the beautiful Elizabeth Spencer.   When he found how he had been duped, Sir John swore that Lord Northampton had seen the only sixpence of his money he should ever receive, and refused to be reconciled to his daughter. But the next year Queen Elizabeth, having expressed to Sir John Spencer the sympathy which she felt with his sentiments upon the ingratitude of his child, invited him to come and be <QUOTE>gossip</QUOTE> with her to a newly-born baby in which she was much interested, and he could not refuse; and it is easy to imagine whose that baby was. So the Spencer property came to the Comptons after all, and an immense inheritance it has been, and. Lord Northampton lived to erect the magnificent tomb to his <QUOTE>well-deserving father-in-law,</QUOTE> where the disobedient daughter, in everlasting contrition for her fault, may be seen kneeling, in a tremendous hoop, at her father's feet. 
   <p>The rich wife continued to live frequently in Crosby Place, and was rather an expensive wife to her husband, especially considering the value of money at that time, as may be judged from the following letter written soon after her marriage. It seems worth giving as characteristic of the people, the place, and the times.

Also I would have <num value="2">two</num> gentlewomen, lest <num value="1">one</num> should be sick, or have some other let; also, believe it, it is an indecent thing for a gentlewoman to stand mumping alone, when God hath blessed their lord and lady with a great estate.

Also, for laundresses, when I travel, I will have them sent away before the carriages, to see all safe; and the chamber-maids I will have go before, that the chamber may be ready, sweet, and clean. Also, and for that it is undecent for me to crowd myself up with my gentleman-usher in my coach, I will have him to have a convenient horse to attend me either in city or country. And I must have <num value="2">two</num> footmen. And my desire is that you defray all the charges for me.

In <datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct> it became a Presbyterian Meeting House.   It was later a packer's warehouse, till, in <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>, a subscription was raised to restore it as we now see it. 
   <p>A passage, <num value="1">one</num> of those obscure and almost secret ways of the City, which yet are crowded with foot passengers, leads under an archway into and through Crosby Square.   It passes in front of the noble oriel of the <hi rend=italics>Hall</hi>. This is a stately room, <num value="54">54</num> ft. long, <num value="27">27</num> ft. broad, and was once <num value="40">40</num> ft. high but this has been curtailed, with a noble perpendicular timber roof. The great oriel window has been filled by <hi rend=italics>Willement</hi>
with stained glass armorial bearings of the different possessors of Crosby Place.   It is <num value="1">one</num> of the few ancient halls in which there is no indication of a raised dais. Above the adjoining <hi rend=italics>Council Chamber</hi> is the so-called <hi rend=italics>Throne Room</hi>, with a peculiarly beautiful window. Crosby Place is now occupied by the Restaurant of Messrs. Gordon and Co. 
    <p>In   <rs type=subject>Crosby Square</rs>, at the back of the Hall, are some admirable modern buildings of brick and terra-cotta. <rs type=subject>Crosby Hall Chambers</rs>, close by, have a good   chimney-piece of <datestruct value="1635--"><year reg="1635">1635</year></datestruct>. 
   <p>Close to Crosby Place, a low timber-corbelled gateway leads out of Bishopsgate Street into <rs type=subject>Great St. Helen's</rs>, where, from the noise and bustle of the great thoroughfare, you <pb id="p.288" n="288"> suddenly enter upon the quiet of a secluded churchyard, filled in early spring with bright green foliage. Here, c. <datestruct value="1216--"><year reg="1216">1216</year></datestruct>, the Priory of the Nuns of St. Helen's was founded by William Basing, Dean of St. Paul's. The old Hall of the Nuns was only removed in <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>. Their <hi rend=italics>Church</hi> remains, and from the number of monuments connected with the City of London within its walls it has become a kind of Westminster Abbey for the City, and is of the highest interest. Lately the number of these monuments has been greatly increased by the destruction, in <datestruct value="1874--"><year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct>, of the ancient <pb id="p.289" n="289"> Church of St. Martin Outwich (so called from its founder, John de Oteswitch), and the removal to St. Helen's of all the tombs which it contained. 
   <p>The church consists of <num value="2">two</num> aisles, separated by perpendicular arches, with chapels attached at the south-east. Only a very small portion of the building is used for congregational purposes, and till a few years ago a large part of the west end, screened off, and always known as <QUOTE>The Void,</QUOTE> was only used for funerals.   The whole building is surrounded with monuments.   An inscription over the west door reminds us that <QUOTE>This is none other than the house of God,</QUOTE> but the usual entrance is by the handsome Jacobean door on the south side of the building. The small altar-tomb with incised figures opposite the entrance is that of William and Magdalen Kirwen of <datestruct value="1594--"><year reg="1594">1594</year></datestruct>.   On the left of the door is the stately alabaster tomb of the rich Sir John Spencer (<datestruct value="1609--"><year reg="1609">1609</year></datestruct>), raised by Lord Northampton to his <QUOTE>well-deserving father-in-law.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Some <num value="1000">thousand</num> men in mourning cloakes</QUOTE> assisted at his funeral.<NOTE id="n.289.1">Letter from Mr. John Beaulieu to Mr. Turnbull. <datestruct VALUE="1609-03-2"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=2>2</day>, <year reg=1609>1609</year></datestruct>-<datestruct value="1610--"><year reg="1610">1610</year></datestruct>.</NOTE>   The figures of Sir Johns and his wife (Alicia Bromfeld) repose   under a double canopy; the heiress daughter, almost eclipsed in the immensity of her hoop, kneels at a desk at their feet.

    <p>Here the line of monuments is broken by a great tomb like a house, to Francis Bancroft, founder of the Mile End  Almshouses, who <QUOTE>settled his estate in London and Middlesex for the beautifying and keeping in repair of this monument for ever.</QUOTE> It is very ugly, but very curious. Being the property of the Drapers' Company, when a new Master is appointed, he generally pays his respects to Francis  Bancroft, for the tomb can be entered by a door, and the lid of the coffin turns back, displaying the skeleton.  Bancroft was so unpopular as a city magistrate in his life-time, that the people pealed the bells at his funeral, and tried to upset the coffin on its way to the grave.  He desired that for a <num value="100">hundred</num> years a loaf of bread and a bottle of wine might be placed in his grave every year on the anniversary of his death, because he was convinced that before that time he should awake from   his death-sleep and require it. The <num value="100">hundred</num> years have now expired. 
   <p>Beyond Bancroft's tomb are a staircase and a door, which formerly communicated with <num value="2">two</num> stories of the convent. There, against the wall, are the tombs of William Bond--<QUOTE lang=la>Flos Mercatorum</QUOTE>-- <QUOTE>a merchant-adventuret, and most famous in his age for his great enterprises by sea and land</QUOTE> (<datestruct value="1576--"><year reg="1576">1576</year></datestruct>); and Martin Bond (<datestruct value="1643--"><year reg="1643">1643</year></datestruct>), governor of Tilbury Fort in the time of Elizabeth.

    <p>From the south porch of the church a labyrinthine passage leads by St. Mary Axe to St. Andrew Undershaft, of which there is a picturesque view where the passage opens upon the street.   Several of the houses which look upon St. Helen's Churchyard deserve notice.

   <p>The next turn out of Bishopsgate Street leads into St. Helen's Place, near the end of which is the modern <rs type=subject>Hall of the Leather-sellers' Company</rs>, incorporated by Richard II.   It stands upon the still-preserved crypt of St. Helen's Priory. At the beginning of this century a curious fountain with the figure of a mermaid, sculptured by Caius Gabriel Cibber in <datestruct value="1779--"><year reg="1779">1779</year></datestruct>, in payment of a fine to the company, stood in the court in front of it; but it disappeared many years ago. 
    <p>On the opposite side of Bishopsgate Street is the ancient hostelry of the <rs type=subject>Green Dragon</rs>, with wooden galleries overhanging its courtyard.   The curious Inn of <hi rend=italics>The <num value="4">Four</num> Swans</hi>

   <p>Near this on the left, with buildings extending to Broad <pb id="p.296" n="296"> Street, stood Gresham College, founded in honour of Sir Thomas Gresham, who gave the Royal Exchange to the City on condition that the Corporation would institute lectures   on   Divinity, Civil Law, Astronomy, Music, Geometry, Rhetoric, and Physic, to be delivered in his dwelling-house, which he bequeathed for the purpose. 
   <p>Many eminent men were professors of this college, and their learned weekly meetings in <datestruct value="1645--"><year reg="1645">1645</year></datestruct> gave birth to the Royal Society.

   <p>Almost concealed by its parasitic houses, so that we might easily pass it unobserved, is (right) the Gothic arch which forms an entrance to the solemn little <rs type=subject>Church of St. Ethdeburga</rs>, dedicated to the daughter of King Ethelbert, <num value="1">one</num> of the few churches which survived the Fire. It contains some good fragments of old stained glass, and its existence is mentioned as early as <datestruct value="1366"><year reg="1366">1366</year></datestruct>. At the junction of Camomile and Wormwood Streets, a large episcopal mitre on a house-wall marks the site of the old Gate of the City called Bishops' Gate.   Tradition ascribed the foundation of this gate (frequently rebuilt) to St. Erkenwald in <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, and the Bishops of London had an ancient right to levy <num value="1">one</num> stick from every cart laden with wood which passed beneath it, in return for which they were obliged to supply the hinges of the gate. Beyond this, the street is called <rs type=subject>Bishopsgate Without.</rs>

   <p>On the left of Bishopsgate Without is <rs type=subject>St. Botolph's Church</rs>, an ugly building of <datestruct value="1728--"><year reg="1728">1728</year></datestruct>.

    <p>It is not far down Bishopsgate Street to (left) the beautiful old <rs type=subject>House of Sir Paul Pindar</rs>, <QUOTE>worthie benefactor to the poore,</QUOTE> with overhanging oriel windows, very richly decorated with panel-work, forming a subject well worthy of the artist's pencil.

His reputation of the richest merchant of the kingdom brought him frequent visits here from James I. and Charles I. to beg for a loan in their necessities. At the request of the <pb id="p.300" n="300"> Turkey Company he was sent by James I. as ambassador to Constantinople, where he did much to improve the English trade in the Levant. On his return in <num value="11620">11620</num>, he brought back with him, amongst other treasures, a great diamond which was valued at <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure>, and which he was wont to lend to James I. to wear at the opening of his Parliaments; it was afterwards sold to Charles I. At the time of the civil wars it was Sir Paul Pindar who provided funds for the escape of the Queen and her children. He lived to give <measure value="10000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="10000">10,000</num></measure> for the restoration of St. Paul's, which was begun in Charles II.'s reign before the Great Fire. When he died the King owed no less than <measure value="300000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300000">300,000</num></measure> to Sir Paul and the other Commissioners of the Customs, and Pindar's <pb id="p.301" n="301"> affairs were found to be in such confusion, that his executor, William Toomer, was unable to bear the responsibility of his trust, and destroyed himself. When the great merchant was living, the house had a park attached to it behind, of which <num value="1">one</num> of the richly ornamented lodges and some old mulberry trees, planted to please James I., existed till a few years ago in Half-Moon Alley. Now all is closely hemmed in by houses. 
   <p>The name of <rs type=subject>Devonshire Street</rs> (on the right) commemorates the town-house of the Cavendishes, Earls of Devonshire, who lived in Bishopsgate during the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, and some of whom are buried in St. Botolph's.

   <p><QUOTE rend=blockquote><CIT><QUOTE>The style of Bunyan is delightful to every reader, and invaluable as a study to every person who wishes to obtain a wide command over the English language. The vocabulary is the vocabulary of the common people. There is not an expression, if we except a few technical terms of theology, which would puzzle the rudest peasant.   We have observed several pages which do not contain a single word of more than <num value="2">two</num> syllables. Yet no writer has said more exactly what he meant to say.

<p>The labyrinthine but most busy streets which form the centre of the City of London to the south of the Royal Exchange are filled with objects of interest, though of minor interest, amid which it will be difficult to thread our way, and impossible to keep up any continuous connection of associations. The houses, which have looked down upon so many generations of toilers, are often curious in themselves. The City churches for the most part are dying a slow   death; their congregations have ebbed and will never flow   back.   Very few   are worth visiting for their own sakes, yet almost every <num value="1">one</num> contains some tomb or other fragment which gives it a historic interest. Dickens vividly describes their general aspect and the kind of thoughts which are awakened by attending a service in <num value="1">one</num> of these queer old churches. 
   <QUOTE rend=blockquote><CIT><QUOTE><p>There is a pale heap of books in the corner of every pew, and while the organ, which is hoarse and sleepy, plays in such a fashion that I can hear more of the rusty working of the stops than of the music, I look at the books, which are mostly bound in faded baize and stuff. They belonged, in <datestruct value="1754--"><year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct>, to the Dowgate family. And who were they? Jane Comport must have married young Dowgate, and come into the family that way. Young Dowgate was courting Jane Comport when <pb id="p.322" n="322"> he gave her her prayer-book, and recorded the presentation in the fly leaf. If Jane were fond of young Dowgate, why did she die and leave the book here?   Perhaps at the rickety altar, and before the damp Commandments, she, Comport, had taken him, Dowgate, in a flush of youthful hope and joy, and perhaps it had not turned out in the long run as great a success as was expected. 
   <p> The opening of the service recalls my wandering thoughts. I then find to my astonishment that I have been, and still am, taking a strong kind of invisible snuff up my nose, into my eyes, and down my throat.  I wink, sneeze, and cough. The clerk sneezes; the clergyman winks; the unseen organist sneezes and coughs (and probably winks); all our little party wink, sneeze, and cough. The snuff seems to be made of the decay of matting, wood, cloth, stone, iron, earth, and something else. Is the something else the decay of dead citizens in the vaults below? As sure as death it is! Not only in the cold damp February day, do we cough and sneeze dead citizens, all through the service, but dead citizens have got into the very bellows of the organ and half choked the same. We stamp our feet to warm them, and dead citizens arise in heavy clouds. Dead citizens stick upon the walls, and lie pulverised on the sounding-board over the clergyman's head, and when a gust of air comes, tumble down upon him.

   <p>In the churches about Mark Lane there was a dry whiff of wheat; and I accidentally struck an airy sample of barley out of an aged hassock in <num value="1">one</num> of them. From Rood Lane to Tower Street, and thereabouts, there was sometimes a subtle flavour of wine; sometimes of tea. <num value="1">One</num> church, near Mincing Lane, smelt like a druggist's drawer. Behind the  Monument, the service had a flavour of damaged oranges, which, a little farther down the river, tempered into herrings, and gradually turned into a cosmopolitan blast of fish. In <num value="1">one</num> church, the exact counterpart of the church in the  <Q>Rake's Progress,</Q>  where the hero is being married to the horrible old lady, there was no speciality of atmosphere, until the organ shook a perfume of hides all over us from some adjacent warehouse. 
   <p> The dark vestries and registries into which I have peeped, and the little hemmed in churchyards that have echoed to my feet, have left impressions on my memory as distinct and quaint as any it has in that way received. In all those dusty registers that the worms are eating, there is not a line but made some hearts leap, or some tears flow, in their day. Still and dry now, still and dry   and the old tree at the window, with no room for its branches, has seen them all out. So with the tomb of the Master of the old Company, on which it drips.

   <p>Let us now   turn down. <rs type=subject>Lombard Street</rs>-the street of Bankers, which derived its name from the Italian merchants who frequented it before the reign of Edward II. Jane Shore, the beloved of Edward IV., was the wife of a <pb id="p.335" n="335"> goldsmith in this street; Guy, the founder of Guy's Hospital, was a bookseller here; and here, where his father was a linen-draper, the poet Pope was born in <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct> amongst the merchants and money-makers.   At No. <num value="68">68</num> was Sir Thomas Gresham's banking office and goldsmith's shop, once surmounted by a huge gilt grasshopper.   On the right, Nicholas Lane leads by the churchyard of St. Nicholas Acon, never rebuilt after the Great Fire. On the left is <rs type=subject>the Church of St. Edmund</rs> the English King and Martyr, which now also serves for the parishes of St. Benet, Grace Church, and St. Leonard, Eastcheap.   It is <num value="1">one</num> of Wren's restorations.

   <p>On the left of Lombard Street is another poor work of Wren, the <rs type=subject>Church of Allhallows, Lombard Street</rs>. The church is of Saxon foundation and is mentioned in records of <datestruct value="1653--"><year reg="1653">1653</year></datestruct>.

   <p>From Lombard Street, <rs type=subject>Fenchurch Street</rs> leads to Aldgate, taking its name from the fenny ground caused by the overflowings of the Lang Bourne, a clear brook of sweet water which ran down Fen Church Street and Lombard Street as <pb id="p.336" n="336"> far as St. Mary Woolnoth, where it broke into several small rills which flowed southward to the Thames. Many of the buildings in this street bear a date immediately after the Great Fire, in which it was consumed.

Its <num value="2">second</num> name indicates its position.

St. Dionis is now (<datestruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></datestruct>) condemned.

              <p><rs type=subject>Mincing Lane</rs> (right) is named   from   houses which belonged to the Minchuns or nuns of St. Helen's. Near the entrance of the lane, on the left, an iron gate is the entrance to the <rs type=subject>Hall of the Clothworkers' Company</rs>, whose badge is a ram. About <num value="110">one hundred and ten</num> poor men and the same number of women are clothed throughout by this Company, and receive a guinea each after attending a service at <num value="1">one</num> of the neighbouring churches on the <datestruct VALUE="-05-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>.

The cash-books of the Company exist, <QUOTE>brought forward,</QUOTE> from <datestruct value="1480--"><year reg="1480">1480</year></datestruct>. The garden of the Company is formed by the <rs type=subject>Churchyard of All Hallows Staining</rs>, in which most of the tombs have been ruthlessly buried under the shrubs and gravel. Elizabeth is said to have attended a thanksgiving service here on the day of her deliverance from  the Tower, before dining at the Queen's Head. The  church is demolished, and the churchyard ruined by gravel and silly rockwork, but the fine old tower, which escaped the Fire, is retained. All Hallows Staining claims to be the earliest stone church in the City. 
    <p>To this churchyard has been removed a fragment of the beautiful <rs type=subject>Crypt of the Hermitage of St. James in the Wall</rs>, which was pulled down in <datestruct value="1874--"><year reg="1874">1874</year></datestruct>, when the chapel built above it by William Lambe the Clothworker (<datestruct value="1495--"><year reg="1495">1495</year></datestruct>-<datestruct value="1580--"><year reg="1580">1580</year></datestruct>) was removed from Cripplegate to Islington. It has low zig-zag Roman arches. 
<p>Returning to Fenchurch Street, on the left is the <rs type=subject>Elephant Tavern</rs>, rebuilt in <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct>, on the site of a tavern which was <pb id="p.338" n="338"> of great interest, because, being a massive house built of solid stone, it alone resisted the Great Fire, and the flames, which tore swiftly through the timber buildings of this part of London; left it standing smoke-begrimed and flame-blackened, but sufficiently uninjured to give a shelter to numbers of the homeless inhabitants of the <num value="13200">13,200</num> houses which were swept away. William Hogart, who afterwards changed his name to Hogarth, came to lodge in this house, in <datestruct value="1697--"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct>, soon after the death of his father, who kept a small school in the Old Bailey, and here for a long time he earned a hand-to-mouth subsistence by selling his engravings on copper. <QUOTE>I remember the time,</QUOTE> he says, <QUOTE>when I have gone moping into the City with scarce a shilling, but <pb id="p.339" n="339"> as soon as I have obtained <num value="2">two</num> guineas for a plate, I have returned home, put on my sword, and sallied forth again with all the confidence of a man with thousands in his pockets.</QUOTE> Sometimes, however, the plates accumulated unsold till the artist was glad to sell them at half-a-crown the pound to Mr. Bowles of the Black Horse at Cornhill.   It was in <datestruct value="1727--"><year reg="1727">1727</year></datestruct>, while he was living here, that Hogarth made a tapestry design for Morris the upholsterer, for which he was refused payment, and vainly sued for it in the Courts. It is believed that this loss induced him to run so far into debt with his landlord that he consented to wipe off the score with his brush by caricaturing on the wall of the Elephant taproom the parochial authorities who had insulted his landlord by removing the scene of their annual orgie to a tavern (Henry the <num value="8">Eighth</num>'s Head) opposite, and insulted himself by omitting to send his accustomed invitation.   The famous picture of <QUOTE>Modern Midnight Conversation</QUOTE> was the result, in which every phase of riotry and intoxication was represented,<NOTE id="n.339.1">Orator Henley, the famous but eccentric and profligate preacher, who was the <QUOTE>orator of brazen face and lungs</QUOTE> of Pope's <hi rend=italics>Dunciad</hi>, was introduced here.</NOTE> and which delighted   the landlord by attracting half London to his house.   The host of the Elephant was only too glad to obliterate a <num value="2">second</num> score for the picture of the <QUOTE>Hudson's Bay Company Porters going to dinner,</QUOTE> in which Fenchurch Street, as it then was, was represented; and to these greater pictures the paintings of Harlequin and Pierrot, and of Harlow Bush Fair, were afterwards added, so that the Elephant became a little gallery of the best works of Hogarth.<NOTE id="n.339.2">See <hi rend=italics>The Builder</hi>, Sept. ii, <datestruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></datestruct>.</NOTE>

   <p>The Convent of Crossed or Crouched Friars (<foreign lang=la>Fratres Sanctae Crucis</foreign>) in Hart Street, founded by Ralph Hosier and William   Saberner in <datestruct value="1298--"><year reg="1298">1298</year></datestruct>, has given a name to the neighbouring street of <rs type=subject>Crutched Friars</rs>.   Here, in Cooper's Row, were Sir John Milbome's Almshouses (lately removed to <num value="7">Seven</num> Sisters Road, Holloway), built in <datestruct value="1535--"><year reg="1535">1535</year></datestruct>, in honour of God and of the Virgin, where, having strangely survived Puritan iconoclasm, a relief of the Assumption of the Virgin remained to the last over the entrance gate. Near this was an early Northumberland House, inhabited by the <num value="2">second</num> Earl of Northumberland, who was slain at the Battle of St. <pb id="p.345" n="345"> Alban's, and his son the <num value="3">third</num> Earl, who fell, sword in hand, at the Battle of Towton. In Crutched Friars are the vast buildings of the East India Docks Indigo Warehouse. 
   <p>Returning to Fenchurch Street, we pass, on the left, <rs type=subject>Billiter Lane</rs>, formerly <QUOTE>Bell-yeter Lane,</QUOTE> from   the bellfounders, though Stow says it was formerly <QUOTE>Belzettars Lane, so called of the <num value="1">first</num> owner and builder thereof.</QUOTE> Fenchurch Street leads into Aldgate High Street, where <rs type=subject>Aldgate Pump</rs> occupies the site of a famous well dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel. Close by stood a little Chapel of St. Michael, which belonged to the neighbouring monastery of the Holy Trinity, where wayfarers to the eastern counties sought the divine protection for their journey. The chapel is destroyed, but its beautiful <hi rend=italics>Crypt</hi>
still exists beneath the pavement of Aldgate, though the approaches to it have been recently blocked up. 
   <p><hi rend=italics>Aldgate</hi> was <num value="1">one</num> of the great gates of the City, and the chief outlet to the eastern counties from the time of the Romans to its destruction in <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>.   Its antiquity is shown in the name of Aeld or Old gate. It was rebuilt in the reign of John by the Barons, with money robbed from the coffers of the monks and stone taken from the houses of the Jews, for they feared that others might not experience more difficulty than they had done themselves, in entering the City on this side. The dwelling-house above the gate was leased by the corporation in <datestruct value="1374--"><year reg="1374">1374</year></datestruct> (<num value="48">48</num> Edward III.) to the poet Chaucer for life, though he was not allowed to underlet any portion of the building to others. In <datestruct value="1471--"><year reg="1471">1471</year></datestruct> Aldgate was attacked by Thomas Nevill, the <QUOTE>Bastard of Falconbergh,</QUOTE> who succeeded in effecting an entrance, but, the portcullis being let down, was surrounded and slain with <pb id="p.346" n="346"> his men. In <datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct> Aldgate was hung from the top to the bottom with streamers to welcome Mary I., as she entered London in triumph, after the fall of the partisans of Lady Jane Grey. The gate built by the Barons was pulled down in <datestruct value="1606--"><year reg="1606">1606</year></datestruct> and rebuilt in <datestruct value="1609--"><year reg="1609">1609</year></datestruct>. This last Aldgate bore on its east side a gilded statue of James I. with a lion and unicorn chained at his feet, and on the west side gilded statues of Peace, Fortune, and Charity. It was used after the Fire for the prisoners who had been lodged in the Poultry Compter. 
   <p>The name of <rs type=subject>Nightingale Lane</rs> just outside the site of Aldgate is an odd corruption of <QUOTE>Knighten Guild Lane,</QUOTE> commemorating the district which Stow describes as <QUOTE>a certain portion of land on the east part of the City, left desolate and forsaken by the inhabitants, by reason of too <pb id="p.347" n="347"> much servitude,</QUOTE> which was given by King Edgar to <QUOTE><num value="13">thirteen</num> knights or soldiers well-beloved, for service by them done,</QUOTE> and was formed by them into the liberty called Knighten Guild, which still exists as <rs type=subject>Portsoken (soke of the gate) Ward.</rs>

   <p>Stow, the antiquary, lived in Aldgate, and here witnessed the death of the Bailiff of Romford, <QUOTE>a man very well beloved,</QUOTE> who was executed on an accusation of having taken part in a rising in the Eastern Counties. This accusation was brought by Sir Stephen, Curate of St. Andrew Undershaft, the popular agitator whose silly sermon at Paul's Cross led to the destruction of the parish Maypole. The bailiff died, protesting his entire innocence. <QUOTE>I heard the words of the prisoner,</QUOTE> says Stow, <QUOTE>for he was executed upon the pavement of my door, where I kept house;</QUOTE> and the popular indignation was so great that the Curate was forced to take flight from the City. 
   <p><rs type=subject>Duke Street</rs>, on the left, commemorates Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, who married the heiress of the property on this site. On the right is <rs type=subject>Jewry Street</rs> (leading into Crutched Friars), called even in Stow's time <QUOTE>the poor Jurie, of Jews dwelling there.</QUOTE> But the great settlement of Jews here was in <datestruct value="1655--"><year reg="1655">1655</year></datestruct>, under Cromwell, when they came to England in such numbers that there was no room for them in Old Jewry and Jewin Street. 
   <p>The ugly <rs type=subject>Church of St. Botolph, Aldgate</rs>, was built by George Dance in <datestruct value="1744--"><year reg="1744">1744</year></datestruct> on the site of an earlier church, for there were churches to this popular saint at <num value="4">four</num> of the gates-Billingsgate, Aldersgate, Bishopsgate, and Aldgate. Retained from the older church are the curious painted bust of Robert Dow, merchant tailor, <datestruct value="1612--"><year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct>, and a figure in <pb id="p.348" n="348"> a shroud on the tomb of Sir Nicholas and Lady Elizabeth Carew, with their son-in-law Lord Darcy of the north and their grandson Sir Arthur Darcy.   Almost opposite St. Botolph's is an old house decorated with Prince of Wales's feathers, the Fleur-de-lis of France, the Thistle of Scotland, and Portcullis of Westminster. 
    <p>The <hi rend=italics><num value="3">Three</num> Nuns Inn</hi> (left) near St. Botolph's is mentioned in Defoe's History of the Plague. It takes its name of the nuns of the Minorite convent which gave its name to the opposite street of the Minories.

Petticoat Lane proper is long and narrow, and to look down it is to look down a vista of many-coloured garments, alike on the sides and on the ground. The effect sometimes is very striking, from the variety of hues and the constant flitting or gathering of the crowd into little groups of bargainers. Gowns of every shade and every pattern are hanging up, but none, perhaps, look either bright or white; it is a vista of dinginess, but many-coloured dinginess, as regards female attire. Dress-coats, frock-coats, greatcoats, livery and game-keepers' coats, paletots, tunics, trowsers, knee. breeches, waistcoats, capes, pilot-coats, working jackets, plaids, hats, dressing-gowns, shirts, Guernsey frocks, are all displayed. The predominant colours are black and blue, but there is every colour; the light dress of some aristocratic livery, the dull brown-green of velveteen, <pb id="p.349" n="349"> the deep blue of a pilot jacket, the variegated figures of the shawl dressing-gown, the glossy black of the restored garments, the shine of the newly-turpentined black satin waistcoats, the scarlet and green of some flaming tartan-these things, mixed with the hues of the women's garments, spotted and striped, certainly present a scene which cannot be beheld in any other part of the greatest city in the world, nor in any other portion of the world itself.

Handkerchiefs, sometimes of a gaudy orange pattern, are leaped on a chair. Lace and muslin occupy small stands, or are spread on the ground. Black and drab and straw hats are hung up, or piled <num value="1">one</num> upon another, and kept from falling by means of strings; while incessantly threading their way through all this intricacy is a mass of people, some of whose dresses speak of a recent purchase in this lane.</QUOTE><BIBL>--H.

At the end of Great Tower Street is the Church of <rs type=subject>Allhallows, Barking</rs>, which derives its surname from having been founded by the nuns of Barking Abbey before the reign of Richard I., who added a chantry in honour of the Virgin where the north chancel aisle now is. This chantry- <QUOTE>Berking Chapel</QUOTE> contained a famous image of the Virgin placed there by Edward I. in consequence of a vision before his father's death, in which she assured him that he should subdue Wales and Scotland, and that he would be always victorious, whilst he kept her chapel in repair. To the truth of this vision he swore before the Pope, and obtained an indulgence of <num value="40">forty</num> days for all penitents worshipping here at her shrine. In the instrument which set this forth, prayer is especially asked for the soul of Richard I., <QUOTE>whose heart is buried beneath the high altar</QUOTE> : the lion-heart, however, is really in the museum at Rouen, having been exhumed from <pb id="p.364" n="364"> the cathedral, where it was deposited when the king's body was buried at Fontevrault.

   <p>Below Tower Hill, separated from it by a wide moat and ramparts now planted with gardens on the side of the town, is the immense pile of fortifications known as the <rs type=subject>Tower of London</rs>. Though <num value="1">one</num> of the most ancient, and quite the most historical, of English fortresses, a great feeling of disappointment will be inevitably felt by those who see it for the <num value="1">first</num> time. Its picturesque points have to be carefully sought for. Its general aspect is poor, rrean, and uninteresting, a fault which is entirely owing to the <pb id="p.369" n="369"> feebleness of our later English architects--to the same utter ignorance of the honour due to light and shadow-and the same sacrifice of general outline to finish, which has ruined Windsor Castle. Here, where an Italian would have used enormous blocks of stone, perfect rocks heaped <num value="1">one</num> upon another, all work of rebuilding or restoration has been done with small stones neatly cut and fitted together like bricks, producing an impression of durable piteousness, which it requires all the romance of history to counteract.

Griffin, Prince of Wales, was imprisoned here in <datestruct value="1244--"><year reg="1244">1244</year></datestruct> and attempted to escape by a rope made of his bedclothes, but it broke, and he met with a frightful death in the moat. Under Edward I. the great prisoners taken in the Scottish wars were immured here. Baliol, after <num value="3">three</num> years, was released on the intercession of the Pope, but William Wallace and Sir Simon Fraser only left their prison to be executed with the most horrible brutality in Smithfield. 
   <p>Edward II. frequently resided in the Tower, where his eldest daughter, thence called Jane of the Tower, was born. Under Edward III., John, King of France, and David Bruce, King of Scotland, were imprisoned here. In the reign of Richard II. the Tower was continually filled with prisoners who were victims of the jealousy of rival factions, the most illustrious being the young king's tutor, the excellent Sir Simon Burley, of whom Froissart says, <QUOTE>To write of his shameful death right sore displeaseth me; for when I was young I found him a noble knight, sage and wise <gap> yet no excuse could be heard, and on a day he was brought out of the Tower and beheaded like a traitor-God have mercy on his soul.</QUOTE> For this act, when his own friends <pb id="p.371" n="371"> obtained the chief power, King Richard caused his uncle the Duke of Gloucester to be put to death at Calais, and the Earl of Arundel lost his head on Tower Hill. 
   <p>During the rebellion of Wat Tyler, when the king, who had previously been fortified in the Tower, was induced to go forth to meet the insurgents, the rebels broke into the fortress and pillaged it, beheading Sudbury, Archbishop of Canterbury (who had abused them as <QUOTE>shoeless ribalds</QUOTE> ), Sir Robert Hales the treasurer, and others whom   they found there. It was in the upper chamber of the White Tower that Richard II. abdicated in favour of his cousin Henry of Bolingbroke, and hence Henry IV. went to his coronation, a custom   which was followed by all after sovereigns of England till James II.   Henry, Earl of Huntingdon, the king's brother-in-law, was the <num value="1">first</num> of a long series of victims beheaded in the Tower in the reign of Henry IV., in which Prince James of Scotland, son of Robert III., was imprisoned there. Under Henry V. the prisons were filled with the captives of Agincourt, including Charles, Duke of Orleans,<NOTE id="n.371.1">The father (by his <num value="3">third</num> wife) of Louis XII. He had previously married Isabella of Valois, widow of Richard II. of England.</NOTE> and his brother John, Count of Angoulme. In this reign also the Tower became the prison of many of the reformers called Lollards, of whom the greatest was Lord Cobham, who was dragged by a chain from the Tower to be burnt in St. Giles's Fields. 
   <p>In the reign of Henry VI. the fortress was occupied by the prisoners of the Wars of the Roses, and here in <datestruct VALUE="1471-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1471">1471</year></datestruct>, King Henry VI. died mysteriously just after the Battle of Tewkesbury-according to Fabian and Hall, by the hand of the Duke of Gloucester, who <QUOTE>murthered the <pb id="p.372" n="372"> said kyng with a dagger.</QUOTE> Queen Margaret was imprisoned here till <datestruct value="1475"><year reg="1475">1475</year></datestruct>. <num value="2">Two</num> years afterwards George, Duke of Clarence, brother of Edward IV., was put to death in the Tower.   With the death of Edward IV. the darkest page in the annals of the fortress is opened by the execution of Lord Hastings, soon to be followed by the alleged murder of the young King Edward V., and his brother Richard, Duke of York. 
    <p>Hence Elizabeth of York went to her coronation as wife of Henry VII., and here she died after her confinement in <datestruct value="1503--"><year reg="1503">1503</year></datestruct>. Her little daughter Katherine was the last princess born in the Tower. The most illustrious victim of this reign was Edward, Earl of Warwick, son of the murdered Duke of Clarence, and the last male Plantagenet, who was beheaded in <datestruct value="1499--"><year reg="1499">1499</year></datestruct>, his only crime being his royal blood. In the same year Perkin Warbeck, the White Rose of England, who claimed to be the younger son of Edward IV., was imprisoned here before being taken to be hung at Tyburn. 
    <p>The accession of Henry VIII. witnessed the imprisonment and execution of Empson and Dudley the taxgatherers of his father, and in <datestruct value="1521--"><year reg="1521">1521</year></datestruct> that of Edward Bohun,  Duke of Buckingham, whose chief fault was his descent from Thomas of Woodstock, youngest son of Edward III.  The next great executions on Tower Hill were those of  Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, and Sir Thomas More, who suffered for refusing to acknowledge the king's supremacy.  These were soon followed by the private execution of  Queen Anne Boleyn and her brother Lord Rochford, and by the death on Tower Hill of Henry Norris, William  Brereton, Sir Francis Weston, and Mark Smeaton for her <pb id="p.373" n="373"> sake.   The endless victims of the northern insurrections and of the dissolution of monasteries next succeeded to the prisons of the Tower, followed by those accused of treasonable correspondence with Cardinal Pole, including his venerable mother, Margaret, Countess of Salisbury, niece of the Kings Edward IV. and Richard III., who was brutally beheaded within the walls.   In <datestruct value="1540--"><year reg="1540">1540</year></datestruct> Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex, the chief promoter of the dissolution of monasteries, who had offended Henry VIII. by bringing about his marriage with Anne of Cleves, was imprisoned and brought to the block. His execution was soon followed by that of Queen Catherine Howard and her confidante Lady Rochford. 
   <p>In <datestruct value="1546--"><year reg="1546">1546</year></datestruct> Anne Askew was racked in the Tower for the Protestant faith before her burning in Smithfield. And in <datestruct value="1547--"><year reg="1547">1547</year></datestruct> the poet Earl of Surrey was executed on Tower Hill, the only ground for the accusation of high treason brought against him being that he quartered (as he had a right to do) the arms of Edward the Confessor, and that he was fond of conversing with foreigners. His father Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, only escaped being added to the victims of Henry VIII.'s jealousies by the tyrant's death. 
    <p>In the reign of Edward VI., Thomas, Lord Seymour of Sudeley, his uncle, and the widower of his stepmother, Queen Katherine Parr, was beheaded on Tower Hill for government intrigues, and for having defrauded the mint to an amount of something like <measure value="40000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40000">40,000</num></measure> and having established cannon foundries where he had <num value="24">twenty-four</num> cannons ready for immediate service.

    <p>In <datestruct value="1551--"><year reg="1551">1551</year></datestruct> the King's other uncle, the Duke of Somerset,  Lord Protector, being most unjustly found guilty of felony, was beheaded amid the tears of the people. His execution was followed by those of his friends, Sir Thomas Arundel,  Sir Michael Stanhope, Sir Ralph Vane, and Sir Miles  Partridge. 
    <p>The accession of Mary brought Lady Jane Grey and her husband Lord Guildford Dudley to the Tower and the scaffold, with her father-in-law John Dudley, Duke of  Northumberland, and his adherents Sir John Gates and  Sir Thomas Palmer. The rebellion of Sir Thomas Wyatt, a principal cause in the execution of Lady Jane Grey, led to his being beheaded, to the execution of the Duke of  Suffolk and Lord Thomas Grey, and to the imprisonment in the Tower of the Princess Elizabeth. 
    <p>The accession of Elizabeth sent a number of Roman  Catholic bishops and abbots to the Tower for refusing to acknowledge her supremacy. Lady Katherine Grey, sister of Lady Jane, was also kept in prison till her death in <datestruct value="1567--"><year reg="1567">1567</year></datestruct> for the crime of a secret marriage with the Earl of Hertford.  Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, son of the unfortunate  Earl of Surrey, was imprisoned and executed in <datestruct value="1571--"><year reg="1571">1571</year></datestruct>, for having aspired to the hand of Mary, Queen of Scots. In the latter part of the queen's reign numbers of Jesuit priests were committed to the Tower and executed, and Henry  Percy, Earl of Northumberland, being imprisoned there, <pb id="p.375" n="375"> died by suicide. Sir John Perrot, a natural son of Henry VIII., unjustly imprisoned, died of a broken   heart. Through the bitter jealousy of the reigning court favourites, Cecil and Raleigh, Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, was imprisoned and beheaded privately in the Tower in <datestruct value="1601--"><year reg="1601">1601</year></datestruct>, his execution being followed by those of Sir Christopher Blunt, Sir Charles Danvers, Sir Gilley Merrick, and Henry Cuffe. 
   <p>Shortly after James I. came to the throne an alleged plot for the re-establishment of popery and raising of Lady Arabella Stuart to the throne led to that lady's imprisonment for life in the Tower (where she died insane) with Lord Thomas Grey and Lord Cobham, and to the execution of George Brook the brother of the latter. Sir Walter Raleigh, imprisoned at the same time (<datestruct value="1603--"><year reg="1603">1603</year></datestruct>), was released in <datestruct value="1616--"><year reg="1616">1616</year></datestruct>, but he was reimprisoned in <datestruct value="1618--"><year reg="1618">1618</year></datestruct> to gratify the malice of Gondomar the Spanish ambassador, and (though he had been appointed admiral of the fleet with command of an expedition to Guiana, during his short interval of liberty) he was beheaded <num value="2">two</num> months afterwards on his old accusation. 
   <p>In <datestruct value="1606--"><year reg="1606">1606</year></datestruct> the dungeons of the Tower were filled with the conspirators of the Gunpowder Plot, who were all hung, cut down, and disembowelled while they were still living. In <datestruct value="1613--"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct> Sir Thomas Overbury was poisoned in the Tower by the Earl of Rochester and the Countess of Essex, who obtained a pardon by the favour of King James, though he had prayed that <QUOTE>God's curse might light upon him and his posterity (which it did) if he spared any that were guilty.</QUOTE>

   <p>In <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct> Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Stafford, unjustly condemned for high treason against the will of his sovereign Charles I., was beheaded on Tower Hill, having been blessed from a window on his way to execution by Archbishop Laud, who was then himself a prisoner, having been impeached for Romish tendencies, and who was himself beheaded on <datestruct VALUE="1643-01-4"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=4>4</day>, <year reg=1643>1643</year></datestruct>. In the wars which followed, Sir John Hotham and his son, the Duke of Hamilton, the Earl of Holland and Lord Capel were imprisoned and suffered death for the cause of their king. 
   <p>With the return of Charles II. came the imprisonment and death of many of the regicides, but the next important executions were those of Algernon Sidney and William Lord Russell; and that of the Duke of Monmouth, who was executed for high treason against his uncle James II. in <datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct> the Archbishop of Canterbury and <num value="6">six</num> bishops were imprisoned in the Tower for a libel upon the king and his government.

   <p>The parts of the Tower generally exhibited to the public are the Armoury and the Jewel Tower. These, however, are the parts least worth seeing. To visit the rest of the Tower an order should be obtained from the Constable. Visitors are shown over the Tower by <hi rend=italics>Beefeaters</hi>, as the Wardens of the Tower are called, who still wear the picturesque dress of the Yeomen of the Guard of Henry VIII. established in <datestruct value="1285--"><year reg="1285">1285</year></datestruct>, a privilege which was obtained for them in perpetuity from   Edward VI. by his uncle the Protector Somerset, who had noted their diligence in their office while he was a prisoner in the Tower. It has been well observed that the dress of the Beefeaters in the Tower shows, more than anything else in London, the reverence of England for her past. Their name is supposed to be derived from the fact that the commons of the early Yeomen of the Guard, when on duty, was beef-an<num value="4">4</num> the name was probably derisory, beef being then a cheap article of consumption, for when under Henry VIII. butchers were compelled by law to sell their mutton at <num value="3">three</num> farthings, beef was only a half-penny. 
   <p>Before reaching the moat we pass by what is called <QUOTE>the Spur</QUOTE> beneath the <hi rend=italics>Middle Gate</hi>, where an ancient arch with a portcullis is now built into modernised bastions. This was the gate where Elizabeth, coming from   Canonbury before her coronation, on entering the fortress which had been her prison, alighted from her palfrey, and falling upon her knees <QUOTE>offered up to Almighty God, who had delivered her from a danger so imminent, a solemn and devout thanksgiving for an  <Q>escape so miraculous,</Q>  as she <pb id="p.378" n="378"> expressed it herself,  <Q>as that of Daniel out of the mouths of the Lions.</Q> </QUOTE> <NOTE id="n.378.1">See Burnet's <title>History of the Reformation.</title></NOTE>

   <p>Adjoining the Middle Gate was the <rs type=subject>Lion Tower</rs>, with a semicircular area, where the kings of England formerly kept their wild beasts. The <num value="1">first</num> of these were <num value="3">three</num> leopards presented to Henry III. by the Emperor Frederick, in allusion to the royal arms. A bear was soon added, for which the sheriffs of London were ordered to provide a muzzle and iron chain to secure him when out of the water, and a strong cord to hold him <QUOTE>when fishing in the Thames.</QUOTE> An elephant was procured in the same reign, and a lion in that of Edward II.

The <num value="1">first</num> steps leading to the river are the Queen's Stairs (once much wider), where the sovereigns embarked for their coronations.

     <QUOTE rend=blockquote><CIT><QUOTE><p>A monk of St. Alban's, who tells the tale, asserts that a priest who was passing near the fortress saw the spirit of an archbishop, dressed in his robes, holding a cross, and attended by the spirit of a clerk, gazing sternly on these new works.

Here it was that Anne Boleyn was landed, having been hurried hither without warning from a tournament at Greenwich, and fell upon her knees upon the steps, praying God to defend her, as she was innocent of the crime of which she was accused.

   <p>Beyond the Traitor's Gate, guarding the outer ward towards the river, were the <rs type=subject>Cradle lower</rs>, the <rs type=subject>Well Tower</rs>, and the <rs type=subject>Galleyman Tower</rs>. Near the last was the approach called the <rs type=subject>Iron Gate.</rs>

   <p>Returning to the main entrance, we pass into the <rs type=subject>Outer  Ward</rs> through the <rs type=subject>Byward Tower</rs> (so called from the password given on entering it), having on the left the Bell  Tower, in which Bishop Fisher and Lady Arabella Stuart were confined.

We may linger a moment at the top of its steps also, to recollect that it was here that as Sir Thomas More was being led back to prison, after his condemnation, with the fatal sign of the reversed axe carried before him, his devoted daughter Margaret, who had been watching unrecognised amid the crowd, burst through the guards and flinging herself upon his neck, besought his blessing.

   <p>Immediately opposite the Traitor's Gate, another ancient arch with a portcullis admits us to the <rs type=subject>Inner Ward</rs>. The old ring on the left of the arch is that to which the rope was fastened, stretched across the roadway, from the boat which brought in the prisoners. This is altogether the most picturesque point in the building.   It is called the <rs type=subject>Bloody Tower</rs>, from the belief that here the sons of Edward <pb id="p.383" n="383"> IV. were murdered by order of their uncle Richard III. There is not, however, any proof that, if the murder was committed, it occurred here, and the present name has only been given to the place since the reign of Elizabeth: it was previously called <QUOTE>the Garden Tower,</QUOTE> because it joined the constable's garden, which now forms part of the parade. 
   <p>Though there is no proof that the princes were murdered here, a very old tradition points out the angle at the foot of the wall, outside the gate on the right, as the place of their hasty burial by their reputed assassins, Dighton and Forrest, before their removal by Richard III. to the foot of the staircase in the White Tower. 
   <p>The gate looks the same now as it did when Sir Thomas Wyatt passed through it to his prison, when Sir John Bridges seized him and shook him by the collar, calling him names and saying-- <QUOTE>but that the law must pass upon thee, I would stick thee with my dagger</QUOTE> -- <QUOTE>To the which,</QUOTE> says Holinshed, <QUOTE>Wyatt, holding his arms under his side, and looking grievously with a grim look upon the lieutenant, said,  <Q> It is no mastery now,</Q>  and so passed on.</QUOTE> 
   <p>It is from the little portico on the right within the Bloody Gate that nightly, at ii P.M., the sentry of the guard challenges the Chief Warder having the keys of the fortress -- <QUOTE>Who goes there?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Keys.</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Whose keys?</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Queen Victoria's keys.</QUOTE> Upon which the Warder exclaims, <QUOTE>God bless Queen Victoria.</QUOTE> The soldiers respond, the keys pass on, and the guard disperse. 
   <p>Just within the gate, on the right, some steps lead into the <rs type=subject>Wakefield Tower</rs>, where the Regalia is now kept. This tower, which is said to derive its name from the prisoners kept here after the Battle of Wakefield, has a beautiful <pb id="p.384" n="384"> vaulted roof. Opening from the raised recess of the window on   the south   side is the oratory of Henry VI., which tradition points out as the scene of his murder. The centre of the chamber is occupied by a great glass-case containing 
<hi rend=italics>the Regalia</hi>, with the magnificent gold plate used at Coronation banquets.   The collection of plate and jewels here is valued at <num value="3">three</num> millions. The most important objects are-

   <p>The crown jewels have frequently been pledged by the English kings to Flemish and French merchants. A determined attempt to carry them off was made by an Irishman named Thomas Blood in the reign of Charles II. He was a desperate ruffian, who, amongst other wild deeds, had carried off the Duke of Ormond and very nearly succeeded in hanging him at Tyburn to avenge the deaths of some of his associates in a Dublin insurrection, when the Duke was Lord Lieutenant. On the present occasion he came <num value="1">first</num> <pb id="p.386" n="386"> with his supposed wife to see the Regalia, and while there the woman pretended to be taken ill, and her being conveyed into the rooms of Talbot Edwards, the Deputy-keeper, then <num value="80">eighty</num> years old, was made the pretext for an acquaintance, which ended in a proposition on the part of Blood to bring about a marriage between his son and the daughter of Edwards. Some days after he returned with the imaginary bridegroom and <num value="2">two</num> other companions, and, while waiting for the lady, begged to show them the crown jewels. Edwards complied, and, as soon as the door, according to custom, was locked on the inside, they gagged the old man, beat him till he was half senseless, and began to pack up the regalia.   Fortunately young Edwards returned from Flanders at that moment and arrived to see his father. The old keeper, hearing him, contrived to cry out <QUOTE>Murder,</QUOTE> and the conspirators made off, Blood carrying the crown, and <num value="1">one</num> of his companions, Perrot, the orb.   They were pursued and seized.   The most extraordinary part of the story is, that backed by the reminiscence of his attack on the Duke of Ormond, Blood so contrived to terrify the king by his account of the vengeance which his friends would take in case of his execution, that he was not only released, but allowed a pension of <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> a year! while poor old Edwards, promised a pension which was never paid, was allowed to die almost in destitution. 
   <p>Before the Regalia were removed hither, the Wakefield Tower was used as a Record office. It was here that Selden, with Sir Robert Cotton, searched for the precedents upon which the Petition of Rights was founded.

   <p>The centre of the Inner Ward is occupied by the mighty

   <p>At the south-west angle is the entrance of the <rs type=subject>Horse Armoury</rs>, through which visitors are usually hurried full speed by the warders. The gallery is decorated, fantastically and rather absurdly, with weapons. In the centre are <num value="22">twenty-two</num> equestrian figures in suits of armour, illustrating the different reigns from Edward I. to James II. The suits of armour are all ascribed to different kings or knights, but for the most part without authority. 
   <p>The collection is a fine <num value="1">one</num>, but not to be compared to those of Madrid and Vienna, or even to that of Turin. <pb id="p.388" n="388"> Suits which really belonged to those to   whom   they are assigned, and   which   therefore especially   require notice, are-

   <p>Suit of russet armour, covered with filigree work, of the time of Edward VI. The horse armour is adorned with the badges of Burgundy and Granada. It probably belonged to the Archduke Philip, who married the unfortunate Joanna, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella.

  <p>Gilt suit of the Earl of Essex (<datestruct value="1581--"><year reg="1581">1581</year></datestruct>), which was worn by the king's champion at George II.'s coronation.

  <p>The oldest piece of armour here is an Asiatic suit of the time of the Crusades, brought from Tong Castle, in Shropshire.

   <p>A staircase leads (passing through some imitation pillars and a Norman doorway formed out of a window) to Queen Elizabeth's armoury. Here also the old Norman walls are everywhere spoilt by deal panelling and a ridiculous decoration of pistols, sabres, &amp;c., arranged in the forms of feathers or flowers. At the foot of the stairs is a curious suit of armour sent to Charles II. by the Great Mogul.

    <p>Hence a   winding   stair leads to <rs type=subject>St. John's Chapel</rs>
(of <datestruct value="1078--"><year reg="1078">1078</year></datestruct>), the most perfect Norman chapel in England, encircled by heavy circular pillars with square cornices and bases, and a very wide triforium   over the aisles. The stilted horseshoe arches of the apse resemble on a small scale those of St. Bartholomew   the Great.   The pavement is modern but admirably adapted to the place. Here, while he was kneeling in prayer, Brackenbury, the Lieutenant of the Tower, received an order to murder the young Edward V. and his brother, and refused to obey it; here Mary attended a mass for her brother Edward VI. at the time of his funeral; and here the Duke of Northumberland, father-in-law of Lady Jane Grey, heard mass and publicly <QUOTE>kneeled down and axed all men forgiveness, and likewise forgave all men,</QUOTE> before his execution. 
   <p>It is on this floor of the White Tower that Flambard, Bishop of Durham, Griffin, Prince of Wales, John Baliol, and the Duke of Orleans were confined. Baliol especially lived here in great state, with an immense household. 
   <p>Adjoining the chapel was the ancient <hi rend=italics>Banqueting Hall</hi>, now   filled with weapons.   The upper floor, also now divided as an armoury, was the <hi rend=italics>Council Chamber</hi> in which Richard II. abdicated in favour of Henry IV.

It is irresistible to quote Sir Thomas More's graphic account of what followed. 
    <QUOTE rend=blockquote><CIT><QUOTE><p>The protector set the lords fast in communing, and thereupon praying them to spare him for a little while, departed thence.

<LB><gap><LB>
Then said the protector,  <Q> Ye shall all see in what wise that sorceress, and that other witch, of her counsel, Shore's wife, with their affinity, have by their sorcery and witchcraft wasted my body.</Q>  And therewith he plucked up his doublet-sleeve to his elbow, upon his left arm, when he shewed a werish withered arm and small, as it was never other. And thereupon every man's mind sore misgave him, well perceiving that this matter was but a quarrel. For well they wist that the queen was too wise to go about any such folly. And also, if she would, yet would she, of all folk, least make Shore's wife of counsel, whom of all women she most hated, as that concubine whom the king her husband had most loved. And also no man was there present but well knew that his arm was ever such since his birth. 
   <p>Nevertheless the lord-chamberlain answered and said,  <Q> Certainly, my lord, if they have so heinously done, they be worthy heinous punishment.</Q>  <pb id="p.395" n="395"> 
   <p> <Q> What,</Q>  quoth the protector,  <Q> thou servest me ill I ween with ifs and with ands; I tell thee they have so done, and that I will make good on thy body, traitor.</Q>  And therewith, as in a great anger, he clapped his fist upon the board a great rap; at which token given, <num value="1">one</num> cried  <Q>treason </Q>  without. the chamber.

And another let fly at the Lord Stanley, who shrunk at the stroke, and fell under the table, or else his head had been cleft to the teeth; for, as shortly as he shrank, yet the blood ran about his. ears.

So was he brought forth into the green, beside the chapel within the Tower, and his head laid down upon a long log of timber, and there stricken off; and afterward his body with the head interred at Windsor, beside the body of King Edward; both whose souls our Lord pardon!</QUOTE><BIBL>-<title>Life of Richard III.</title></BIBL></CIT></QUOTE>

   <p>Having looked out of the window   whence Richard beheld the execution on Tower Green, we may enter the broad triforium of St. John's Chapel, whence there was a communication with the royal apartments. 
   <p>There is a glorious view from the leads on the summit of the White Tower.   Greenwich is visible on a fine day. The turrets are restorations. In that by which we enter (N.E.) King John imprisoned the beautiful Maud, daughter of Robert Fitzwalter of Baynard's Castle. 
   <p>The vaults of the White Tower were used as prisons, though there is, no authority for the statement of the Warders that Bishop Fisher and Sir Thomas More were imprisoned there. As we descend, we may see the remains <pb id="p.396" n="396"> of the old staircase on the right: a sword shown as Smith O&lsquo;Brien's is kept there. The holes in which the rack was fixed upon which Anne Askew was tortured are still to be seen in the floor of the vault. Burnet narrates that the Lord Chancellor Wriothesley, throwing off his coat, himself drew it so severely that he almost tore her body asunder. In the prison called <rs type=subject>Little Ease</rs> Guy Fawkes was imprisoned, with his companions, and here he was racked, and confessed after <num value="30">thirty</num> minutes of torture. On a wall in <num value="1">one</num> of the vaults is the inscription, <QUOTE lang=la>Sacris vestris indutus, dum sacra mysteria servans, captus et in hoc angusto carcere inclusus. T. Fisher</QUOTE>--probably by a Jesuit priest involved in the conspiracy. 
   <p>The Armouries and the Regalia are the sights usually shown to strangers. Those really interested in the Tower will obtain leave to make the circuit of the smaller towers, of which there were <num value="12">twelve</num> encircling the Inner Ward. Returning to the Bloody Gate, and ascending the steps on the right they will be shown the rooms over the gateway which are full of curious or great reminiscences. 
   <p>On the wall of a small chamber (left) on the <num value="1">first</num> floor is an inscription by the Bishop of Ross, so long an active partisan of Mary, Queen of Scots, who, while here, confessed the Norfolk and Northumberland plots in her favour, and declared her privy to the death of Darnley: only the name is now legible, the rest of the inscription having been chipped   by axes in the time of the Commonwealth. Another room   on this floor is that whither Felton, the murderer of Buckingham, was brought to prison, blessed by the people on his way. Here also Colonel Hutchinson was imprisoned after the Restoration- <QUOTE>It was a great dark <pb id="p.397" n="397"> room,</QUOTE> says Mrs. Hutchinson, <QUOTE>with no window in it, and the portcullis of a gate was drawn up within it, and below there sate every night a court of guard.</QUOTE> The same prison was afterwards occupied by a very different character, James II.'s Judge Jeffreys, who was taken at Wapping in the dress of a sailor by a man he had injured, and who died here of drinking, having, during his imprisonment, been insulted by receiving a present of a barrel, apparently containing Colchester oysters, but really a halter. 
   <p>On the upper floor is the room where the supposed murder of the Princes took place. Its window opens upon a narrow passage by which the assassins are said to have entered from the outside walk upon the walls. The rooms have been subdivided in late times. In <num value="1">one</num> of them Margaret Cheyne was imprisoned, the wild woman who excited the <num value="2">second</num> pilgrim-invasion of Yorkshire in the reign of Henry VIII., its object being to overthrow the power of Cromwell and restore Catherine of Arragon. Here Dudley, Earl of Northumberland, father-in-law of Lady Jane Grey, was imprisoned, and hence he was led to the scaffold. Here was the <num value="1">first</num> prison of Archbishop Cranmer. Henry, Earl of Northumberland, imprisoned for exciting a Catholic crusade against Elizabeth, shot himself here, <datestruct VALUE="1585-06-21"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=21>21</day>, <year reg=1585>1585</year></datestruct>, to avoid the confiscation of his estates. In the same room Sir Thomas Overbury, in the reign of James I., underwent slow agonies of poisoning at the hands of the Earl and Countess of Somerset and their minions. Here also Sir Walter Raleigh lived through his <num value="2">second</num> and longest imprisonment of <num value="16">sixteen</num> years, being accused of a plot in favour of Lady Arabella Stuart.   His imprisonment was not rendered unnecessarily severe, and his wife and son <pb id="p.398" n="398"> were allowed to live near him in the Tower. In the still existing room   he wrote his <title>History of the World,</title> and burnt its <num value="2">second</num> volume as a sacrifice to Truth on being convinced that a murder, which he fancied that he had seen from his prison window, was only an optical delusion.<NOTE id="n.398.1">D&lsquo;Israeli, <title>Curiosities of Literature.</title></NOTE> Here he received the visits of Ben Jonson and other clever men of the time, and of Prince Henry, who said, <QUOTE>No man but my father would keep such a bird in such a cage.</QUOTE> In the adjoining garden he used to work, to cultivate rare plants, and distil curious essences from   them.

   <p>The chapel contains several interesting monuments. At the N.E. corner of the north aisle is the noble alabaster tomb (originally in front of the chancel) of Sir Richard Cholmondeley, Lieutenant of the Tower under Henry VII. (<hi rend=italics>ob</hi>. <datestruct value="1544--"><year reg="1544">1544</year></datestruct>), and his wife Elizabeth. His effigy is in plate armour with a collar of SS., his head rests on a helmet, his feet on a lion: his wife, who lies on her left side, has a pointed headdress: both the statues were once coloured and gilt. The north wall of the chancel is occupied by the tomb of Sir Richard Blount (<datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>) and Sir Michael Blount, his son (<datestruct value="1592--"><year reg="1592">1592</year></datestruct>), both Lieutenants of the Tower. On the south wall of the chancel are some quaint monuments to the Carey family and the black marble tablet to Sir Allan Apsley (father of Mrs. Hutchinson), <datestruct value="1630--"><year reg="1630">1630</year></datestruct>. Other monuments commemorate Valentine Pyne (<datestruct value="1677--"><year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>), Master Gunner <pb id="p.410" n="410"> of England; Sir Jonas More (<datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>), Surveyor-General of the Ordnance under Charles.

The Duke of Monmouth, the unfortunate son of Charles II., was buried beneath the altar, where his bones exist still. On the left of Anne Boleyn (north of chancel) lies her brother, Lord Rochford; to the right of Katherine Howard (south) were her friend Lady Rochford, and the venerable Countess of Salisbury, whose bones have been identified.

   <p>Thames Street is the very centre of turmoil.

The belief that <QUOTE>to be buried in the habit of the Order was a sure preservative against the attacks of the devil</QUOTE> afterwards led to the interment of many great and wealthy personages in the monastic church, <pb id="p.439" n="439"> including Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent, and his wife Margaret of Scotland; Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester, beheaded in the Wars of the Roses; and Sir Thomas and Dame Maude Parr, father and mother of Queen Katherine Parr.

But Blackfriars Monastery will always be best remembered as the place, made familiar by Shakspeare (who knew it well), where (<datestruct VALUE="1529-06-21"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=21>21</day>, <year reg=1529>1529</year></datestruct>) the <num value="2">two</num> Cardinals, Wolsey and Campeggio, sate in judgment upon the divorce of Catherine of Arragon, and where the queen, as <QUOTE>a poor weak woman, fallen from   favour,</QUOTE> flinging herself at her husband's feet, made that touching speech, which has been scarcely altered by Shakspeare.

    <p>In order to visit in a group the interesting points in  Blackfriars, we may turn up <rs type=subject>Wafer Lane</rs>, the last side street on the right before reaching New Bridge Street. Here  (right) is the <rs type=subject>Apothecaries' Hall</rs>, belonging to <num value="1">one</num> of the busiest and most useful of the City Companies, which was founded in the reign of James I. Except the Stationers' it is the only Company whose members are strictly what its name implies, and it has <num value="500">five hundred</num>   members. The laboratories connected with this Hall result from the association of the Apothecaries and Druggists. For till <datestruct value="1687"><year reg="1687">1687</year></datestruct> apothecaries were only what druggists are now, and it was their presuming to prescribe which gave such offence to the College of Physicians in the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century and led to the verses of Garth-

A contemporary bust of Gideon de Laune here commemorates the physician of Anne of Denmark, who obtained their charter for the Apothecaries. Beneath it is a magnificent old iron-bound chest, with a lock guarded by <num value="4">four</num> apes. In the <hi rend=italics>Court Room</hi> is a picture of De Laune with many other portraits, including that of the famous Dr. Richard Mead, <datestruct value="1717--"><year reg="1717">1717</year></datestruct>, and a sketch by <hi rend=italics>Sir Joshua Reynolds</hi> for his portrait of Dr. Hunter (<datestruct value="1728--"><year reg="1728">1728</year></datestruct>-<num value="83">83</num>) now in the College of Surgeons. A slight canopy on the left of the Court Room marks the spot where the Master formerly sate upon a dais, and formally admitted the student candidates, who bowed before him on the step. 
    <p>At the back of the Hall are the <rs type=subject>Chemical Laboratories</rs>, established <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>, from which the Army is still supplied with <pb id="p.442" n="442"> medicines, and which formerly supplied the Navy also.

The preparation of some of the drugs, especially those containing mercury, is so deleterious to the workmen that, though they work in helmets with glass eyes, they are constantly obliged to be allowed a few   days' leave of absence. 
    <p>Turning left we reach <rs type=subject>Carter Lane</rs>. The names of the side arteries of this Lane-Friar Street, Creed Lane, Holiday Yard, and Pilgrim Street-bear record of the great religious house in their neighbourhood, and of the ancient pilgrimages to the shrine of St. Erkenwald.

   <p>Retracing our steps a little, <rs type=subject>Church Entry</rs> (on the left of Carter Lane as we return) contains, against the wall of Blackfriars School, a monument to Dr. William   Gouge, who was minister of the old Church of St. Anne when Shakspeare was residing here, and who, being of like <pb id="p.443" n="443"> principles, was probably of his personal acquaintance. Church Entry leads into <rs type=subject>Ireland Yard</rs>, which takes its name from the William Ireland whose name appears in a deed of conveyance to Shakspeare of a house on that site.

   <p>In the <num value="6">sixth</num> picture of Hogarth's <title>Marriage &agrave; la Mode</title>
the appearance of the houses on old London Bridge may be seen. At <num value="1">one</num> time the booksellers' shops on London Bridge had the reputation which those of Paternoster Row have now. The infant daughter of Sir William Hewett, a famous clock-maker on the bridge, Lord Mayor of London in <datestruct value="1559--"><year reg="1559">1559</year></datestruct>, fell from <num value="1">one</num> of the overhanging windows and was saved from drowning by the gallantry of his apprentice <pb id="p.449" n="449"> Edward Osborne, who was eventually rewarded with her hand and a large dowry. Osborne himself was Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1582--"><year reg="1582">1582</year></datestruct>, and his great-grandson became Duke of Leeds. Pennant describes the street on London Bridge shortly before its fall- <QUOTE>narrow, darksome, and   dangerous to passengers from the multitude of carriages: frequent arches of strong timbers crossing the street from the tops of the houses, to keep them together and from falling into the river.   Nothing but use could preserve the repose of the inmates, who soon grew deaf to the noise of falling waters, the clamours of watermen, or the frequent shrieks of drowning wretches.</QUOTE> The narrowness of the arches beneath the bridge, and the consequent compression of the river, made <QUOTE>shooting the bridge</QUOTE> very dangerous.   Ray's proverb, <QUOTE>London Bridge was made for wise men to go over, and fools to go under,</QUOTE> shows the popular feeling about its rapids. Cowley describes the river as- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Stopp'd by the houses of that wondrous street, 
<L>Which rides o&lsquo;er the broad river like a fleet.</QUOTE>

    <p>In its later existence most of the houses on the bridge were inhabited by pin-makers, and it was a fashionable amusement with west-end ladies to drive to buy their pins there. In the last century the old houses, in <num value="1">one</num> of which  Hans Holbein had lived, were removed <num value="1">one</num> after the other.  Fuller says of Old London Bridge-

    <p>Immediately beyond London Bridge, on the left, now half-buried amongst raised streets and railways, is the fine <pb id="p.450" n="450"> cruciform <rs type=subject>Church of St. Saviour's, Southwark</rs>. It has been sadly mutilated in the present century, but its Lady Chapel and choir are still amongst our best specimens of Early English architecture.

She was buried within the walls of the church, and, by some, its dedication has been supposed to refer to her, as the Virgin Mother is not the St. Mary referred to, having her own chapel-the <QUOTE>Lady Chapel</QUOTE> --annexed to the building. The foundation of Mary Overy was for a House of Sisters, but this was afterwards turned into a College of Priests by Swithin, a noble lady, who is said to have built the <num value="1">first</num> timber bridge over the river; and, in <datestruct value="1106--"><year reg="1106">1106</year></datestruct>, it was refounded for canons regular by William Pont de l&lsquo;Arche and William Dauncy, <num value="2">two</num> Norman knights.   At the dissolution the church was made parochial.

    <p>The Choir, of the most exquisite and unspoilt Early  English   architecture, retains its beautiful altar-screen, erected by Fox, Bishop of Winchester, in <datestruct value="1528--"><year reg="1528">1528</year></datestruct>, and adorned <pb id="p.451" n="451"> with his device, the pelican.

In the pavement an inscription marks the grave to which Philip Massinger has been removed from the churchyard. Near it is that of John Fletcher (Beaumont and Fletcher), <datestruct value="1625--"><year reg="1625">1625</year></datestruct>, of whom Aubrey says that, during the great Plague, he was invited by a Knight in Suffolk or Norfolk to take refuge with him till the danger should be over, but lingered while his tailor made him a suit of new clothes, fell sick, and died. 
   <p>On the left of the north transept is the beautiful tomb of John Gower the Poet, <hi rend=italics>ob</hi>. <datestruct value="1402--"><year reg="1402">1402</year></datestruct>, removed from the Chantrey of St. John, where he had been buried in accordance with his will.

It is on this poem, which represents a dialogue between a lover and his confessor, that the reputation of Gower is founded. It was finished in <datestruct value="1393--"><year reg="1393">1393</year></datestruct>, and is said to have been written in answer to the desire of Richard II., who, meeting the poet <num value="1">one</num> day upon the Thames, called him into his barge, and desired him to <QUOTE>booke some new thing.</QUOTE> The <num value="1">first</num> edition contained many passages flattering to King Richard, but the time-serving poet afterwards either omitted these altogether or converted them to the praise of his rival and successor <pb id="p.453" n="453"> Henry IV. Gower was educated for the law at the Middle Temple and is believed there to have contracted a friendship with Chaucer. Their tastes were the same, and Gower was especially attached to the patronage of Thomas of Woodstock, <num value="1">one</num> of the uncles of Richard III., as Chaucer was to that of another, John of Gaunt. It is believed, however, that the friendship of the poets was turned to enmity before the death of Chaucer. Gower became blind in the <num value="1">first</num> year of Henry IV. and died in <datestruct value="1402--"><year reg="1402">1402</year></datestruct>.

   <p>Against the pillar on the left, adjoining the tomb, are the arms of Cardinal Henry Beaufort, son of John of Gaunt, <pb id="p.454" n="454"> who was consecrated Bishop of Winchester and came to Winchester House close to this church   in the year of Gower's death. Against the same pillar is a curious miniature tomb to William Emerson, <datestruct value="1575--"><year reg="1575">1575</year></datestruct>, <QUOTE>who lived and died an honest man.</QUOTE> He is represented in his shroud.

   <p>Paris Garden took its name from Robert de Paris, who leased a house and garden there from the Abbot of Bermondsey, in the reign of Richard II.

   <p><rs type=subject>Guy's Hospital</rs>, on the left of the Borough High Street, with an entrance in St. Thomas's Street, was built by Dance (<hi rend=italics>oh</hi>. <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct>). It owes its foundation to Thomas Guy (born <datestruct value="1645--"><year reg="1645">1645</year></datestruct>), son of a coal-merchant at Horsleydown, who became a Lombard Street bookseller. The hospital had a narrow escape of losing the wealth of the rich tradesman. He promised to marry his pretty maid, Sally, and had ordered various repairs to his house previous to his nuptials. Seeing that these were incompletely carried out, Sally, in her capacity of bride elect, ordered them: to be properly finished; an assumption of authority which gave such offence to her betrothed that he broke off his marriage, and determining to remain a bachelor, built and endowed the hospital at a cost of <measure value="238292l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="238292">238,292</num></measure>. There is a blackened brass statue of the founder in the courtyard, and another in marble,. in the chapel. 
   <p>We are now in <hi rend=italics>Southwark</hi>, the town on the south side of the Thames, <QUOTE>called by the Saxons,</QUOTE> says Pennant, <QUOTE>Southverke, or the South Work.</QUOTE> It is intersected by the great street called <rs type=subject>the Borough High Street</rs>, which was the <pb id="p.461" n="461"> highway between the metropolis and the southern counties, and by which the Canterbury pilgrimages passed out towards the shrine of St. Thomas h Becket. A memorial of these pilgrimages may be seen in a succession of ancient taverns, retaining their picturesque wooden galleries around their courtyards, with the chambers opening from them, like the old inns in the French towns.   Of these, <rs type=subject>The White Hart</rs>, on the left, a little beyond Guy's Hospital, has a court surrounded by old   balustraded   galleries.   It is mentioned by Shakspeare in his <hi rend=italics>Henry VI</hi>., when Jack Cade remonstrates with his peasant followers, who are forsaking him and accepting the pardon offered by Buckingham and Clifford, saying--

    <p>The next inn, <rs type=subject>The George</rs>, has double tiers of wooden <pb id="p.462" n="462"> galleries.
