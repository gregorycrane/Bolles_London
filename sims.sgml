<head>PREFACE.</head><p><figure n="2000.01.0053.fig00001"><head></></figure>
<p>THE papers which form this volume appeared in the spring and summer of the present
year in The Pictorial World. The interest now evinced in the great question of Housing the
Poor leads me to hope that they will be of assistance to many who are studying the subject
and would desire to have their information in a convenient form for reference. Much that I
ventured to prognosticate when <q>How the Poor Live</q> was written has happened since, and I
have the permission of the author of <q>The Bitter Cry of Outcast London</q> to say that from
these articles he derived the greatest assistance while compiling his now famous pamphlet.
I have thought it well, all circumstances considered, to let the work stand in its original
form, and have in no way added to it or altered it.
</p>
<p>If an occasional lightness of treatment seems to the reader out of harmony with so
grave a subject, I pray that he will remember the work was undertaken to enlist the sympathies
of a class not generally given to the study of <soCalled>low life.</soCalled>
</p>
<p>I take this opportunity of expressing my gratitude to Mr. Frederick Barnard, the
eminent artist, who, at considerable risk to his health and comfort, accompanied me on a
painful journey, and took his sketches <soCalled>on the spot,</soCalled> amid the most distasteful surroundings.

<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p> <figure n="2000.01.0053.fig00002"</>I COMMENCE with the first of this series of papers, a book of travel.
An author and an artist have gone hand in hand
into many a far-off region
of the earth, and the
result has been a volume
eagerly studied by the
stay-at-home public,
anxious to know something of the world in
which they live. In
these pages I propose to
record the results of a
journey with pen and
pencil into a region
which lies at our own
doors--into a dark continent that is within easy
walking distance of the
General Post Office.
This continent will, I
hope, be found as interesting as any of those
newly-explored lards which engage the attention of the
<rs type="org">Royal Geographical Society</rs>-the wild races who inhabit
it will, I trust, gain public sympathy as easily as those
savage tribes for whose benefit the Missionary Societies
never cease to appeal for funds.</p>
<p>I have no shipwrecks, no battles, no moving adventures
by flood and field to record. Such perils as I and my
fellow-traveller have encountered on our journey are not of
the order which lend themselves to stirring narrative. It is
unpleasant to be mistaken, in underground cellars where
the vilest outcasts hide from the light of day, for detectives
in search of their prey-it is dangerous to breathe for some
hours at a stretch an atmosphere charged with infection and
poisoned with indescribable effluvia-it is hazardous to be
hemmed in down a blind alley by a crowd of roughs who
have had hereditarily transmitted to them the maxim of
John Leech, that half bricks were specially designed for the
benefit of <soCalled>strangers;</soCalled> but these are not adventures of
the heroic order, and they will not be dwelt upon lovingly
after the manner of travellers who go farther afield.</p>
<p>My task is perhaps too serious a <num value="1">one</num> even for the light
tone of these remarks. No man who has seen <q>How the
Poor Live </q> can return from the journey with aught but an
aching heart. No man who recognises how serious is the
social problem which lies before us, can approach its consideration in any but the gravest mood. Let me then
briefly place before the reader the serious purpose of these
papers, and then I will ask him to set out with me on the
journey and judge for himself whether there is no remedy
for much that he will see. He will have to encounter
misery that some good people think it best to leave undiscovered. He will be brought face to face with that dark
side of life which the wearers of rose-coloured spectacles
turn away from on principle. The worship of the beautiful
is an excellent thing, but he who digs down deep in the
mire to find the soul of goodness in things evil, is a
better man and a better Christian than he who shudders at
the ugly and the unclean, and kicks it from his path, that
it may not come between the wind and his nobility.
But let not the reader be alarmed, and imagine that I am
about to take advantage of his good nature in order to
plunge him neck high into a mud bath. He may be pained
before wepart company, but he shall not be disgusted. He
may occasionally feel a choking in his throat, but he shall
smile now and again. Among the poor there is humour as
well as pathos, there is food for laughter as well as for tears,
and the rays of God's sunshine lose their way now and again,
and bring light and gladness into the vilest of the London
slums.</p>
<p>His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, in his speech
at the opening of the Royal College of Music last May,
said: <q>The time has come when class can no longer stand
aloof from class, and that man does his duty best who works
most earnestly in bridging over the gulf between different
classes, which it is the tendency of increased wealth and
increased civilisation to widen.</q> It is to increased wealth
and to increased civilisation that we owe the wide gulf
which to-day separates well-to-do citizens from the masses.
It is the increased wealth of this mighty city which has
driven the poor back inch by inch, until we find them today herding together, packed like herrings in a barrel,
neglected and despised, and left to endure wrongs and
hardships which, if they were related to a far-off savage
tribe, would cause <placeName key=x>Exeter Hall</placeName>!
 to shudder till its bricks
<pb id="p.6" n="6">fell down. It is the increased civilisation of this marvellous
age which has made life a victory only for the strong, the
gifted, and the specially blest, and left the weak, the poor,
and the ignorant to work out in their proper persons the
theory of the survival of the fittest to its bitter end.</p>
<p>There are not wanting signs that the <soCalled> one-roomed helot</soCalled>
and his brood are about to receive a little scientific attention. They have become natural curiosities, and to this fact
they may owe the honour in store for them, of dividing
public attention with the Zenanas, the Aborigines, and the
South Sea Islanders. The long-promised era of domestic
legislation is said to be at hand, and prophets with powerful
telescopes declare they can see the first faint signs of its
dawn upon the political horizon. When that era has come
within the range of the naked eye, it is probable that the
Homes of the Poor will be <num value="1">one</num> of its burning questions,
and the strong arm of the law may be extended protectingly,
even at the risk of showing the shortness of its sleeve, as
far as the humble toilers who at the present moment suffer
only its penalties and enjoy none of its advantages.</p>
<p>That there are remedies for the great evil which lies
like a cankerworm in the heart of this fair city is certain.
What those remedies are you will be better able to judge
when you have seen the condition of the disease for which
Dr. State is to be called in. Dr. State, alas, is as slow to
put in an appearance as his parish confrere when the patient
in need of his services is poor and friendless.</p>
<p>Forgive me this little discourse by the way. It has at any
rate filled up the time as we walk along to the outskirts
of the land through which we are to travel for a few weeks
together. And now, turning out of the busy street alive
with the roar of commerce, and where the great marts and
warehouses tower stories high, and where Dives adds daily
to his wealth, we turn up a narrow court, and find ourselves at once in the slum where Lazarus lays his head
-even as he did in the sacred story-at the very gates of
the mighty millionaire.</p>
<p>We walk along a narrow dirty passage, which would
effectually have stopped the Claimant had he come to this
neighbourhood in search of witnesses, and at the end we
find ourselves in what we should call a back yard, but which,
in the language of the neighbourhood, is a square. The
square is full of refuse, heaps of dust and decaying vegetable
matter lie about here and there, under the windows and in
front of the doors of the squalid tumble-down houses. The
windows above and below are broken and patched, the roofs
of these two-storied <soCalled>eligible residences</soCalled> look as though
Lord Alcester had been having some preliminary practice
with his guns here before he set sail for Alexandria. All
these places are let out in single rooms at prices varying
from 2s. 6d. to 4s. a week. We can see a good deal of
the inside through the cracks and crevices and broken
panes, but if we knock at the door we shall get a view of
the inhabitants.</p>
<p>If you knew more of these Alsatias, you would be
rather astonished that there was a door to knock at. Most
of the houses are open day and night, and knockers and
bells are things unknown. Here, however, the former
luxuries exist; so we will not disdain them.</p>
<p>Knock, knock!</p>
<p>Hey, presto! what a change of scene! Sleepy Hollow
has come to life. Every door flies open, and there is a
cluster of human beings on the threshold. Heads of matted
hair and faces that haven't seen soap for months come
out of the broken windows above.</p>
<p>Our knock has alarmed the neighbourhood. Who are
we? The police? No. Who are we? Now theyrecognise
one of our number-our guide-with a growl. He and we
with him can pass without let or hindrance where it would
be dangerous for a policeman to go. We are supposed to
be on business connected with the School Board, and we
are armed with a password which the worst of these outcasts
have grown at last sulkily to acknowledge.</p>
<p>My fellow-traveller has sketched this result of a knock,
as we are not likely to see it again. This is a very respectable place,<figure n="2000.01.0053.fig00003"></> and we have taken it first to break the ground
gently for an artist who has not hitherto studied <soCalled>character</soCalled>
on ground where I have had many wanderings.</p>
<p>To the particular door attacked there comes a poor
woman, white and thin and sickly-looking; in her arms
she carries a girl of eight or nine with a diseased spine;
behind her, clutching at her scanty dress, are two or three
other children. We put a statistical question, say a kind
word to the little ones, and ask to see the room.</p>
<p>What a room ! The poor woman apologises for its condition, but the helpless child, always needing her care, and
the other little ones to look after, and times being bad, &amp;c.
Poor creature, if she had ten pair of hands instead of one
pair always full, she could not keep this room clean. The
walls are damp and crumbling, the ceiling is black and <pb id="p.7" n="7">
peeling off, showing the laths above, the floor is rotten and
broken away in places, and the wind and the rain sweep in
through gaps that seem everywhere. The woman, her husband, and her six children live, eat, and sleep in this one
room, and for this they pay three shillings a week. It is
quite as much as they can afford. There has been no
breakfast yet, and there won't be any till the husband (who
has been out to try and get a job) comes in and reports <figure n="2000.01.0053.fig00004"></>
progress. As to complaining of the dilapidated, filthy
condition of the room, they know better. If they don't like
it they can go. There are dozens of families who will jump
at the accommodation, and the landlord is well aware of
the fact.</p>
<p>Some landlords do repair their tenants' rooms. Why,
cert'nly. Here is a sketch of one and of the repairs we saw
the same day. Rent, 4s. a week; condition indescribable.
But notice the repairs: a bit of a box lid nailed across a
hole in the wall big enough for a man's head to go through,
a nail knocked into a window frame beneath which still
comes in a little fresh air, and a strip of new paper on a
corner of the wall. You can't see the new paper because
it is not up. The lady of the rooms holds it in her hand.
The rent collector has just left it for her to put up herself.
Its value, at a rough guess, is threepence. This landlord has
executed repairs. Items: one piece of a broken soap-box,
one yard and a-half of paper, and one nail. And for these
repairs he has raised the rent of the room threepence a week.</p>
<p>We are not in the square now, but in a long dirty street,
full of lodging-houses from end to end, a perfect human
warren, where every door stands open night and day-a
state of things that shall be described and illustrated a little
later on when we come to the <soCalled>'appy dossers.</soCalled> In this
street, close to the repaired residence,we select at hazard an
open doorway and plunge into it. We pass along a greasy,
grimy passage, and turn a corner to ascend the stairs.
Round the corner it is dark. There is no staircase light,
and we can hardly distinguish in the gloom where we are
going. A stumble causes us to strike a light.</p>
<p>That stumble was a lucky one. Here is the staircase
we were ascending, and which men and women and little
children go up and down day after day, and night after night.
The handrail is broken away, the stairs themselves are going
-a heavy boot has been clean through one of them already,
and it would need very little, one would think, for the whole
lot to give way and fall with a crash. The sketch herewith,
taken by the light of successive vestas, fails to give the
grim horror of that awful staircase. The surroundings, the
ruin, the decay, and the dirt, cannot be reproduced.</p>
<p>We are anxious to see what kind of people get safely up
and down this staircase, and as we ascend them we knock
accidentally up against something; it is a door and a
landing. The door is opened, and as the light is thrown
on to where we stand we give an involuntary exclamation of
horror; the door opens right on to the corner stair. The
woman who comes out would, if she stepped incautiously,
fall six feet, and nothing could save her. It is a tidy room
this, for the neighbourhood. A good hardworking woman
has kept her home neat, even in such surroundings. The
rent is <measure value="4." type=currency><num value="4">four</num></measure>and <measure value="6." type=currency><num value="6">sixpence</num></measure>a week, and the family living
in it number eight souls; their total earnings are <measure value="12." type=currency><num value="12">twelve</num></measure>
shillings. A hard lot, one would fancy; but in comparison
to what we have to encounter presently it certainly is not.
Asked about the stairs, the woman says, <q>It is a little
ockard-like for the young 'uns a-goin' up and down to
school now the Board make 'em wear boots; but they
don't often hurt themselves.</q> Minus the boots, the children
had got used to the ascent and descent, I suppose, and
were as much at home on the crazy staircase as a chamois <figure></>
on a precipice. Excelsior is our motto on this staircase.
No maiden with blue eyes comes out to mention avalanches,
but the woman herself suggests <q>it's werry bad higher up.</q>
We are as heedless of the warning as Longfellow's headstrong banner-bearer, for we go on.</p>
<p>It is <soCalled>werry bad</soCalled> higher up, so bad that we begin to
light some more matches and look round to see how we
are to get down.- But as we continue to ascend the darkness <pb n="8" id="p.8"><p><Figure></><pb id="p.9" n="9">gets less and less. We go a step at a time, slowly
and circumspectly, up, up to the light, and at last our
heads are suddenly above a floor and looking straight into
a room.</p>
<p>We have reached the attic, and in that attic we see a
picture which will be engraven on our memory for many a
month to come.<p>
The attic is almost bare; in a broken fireplace are some
smouldering embers, a log of wood lies in front like a fender.<figure></> There is a broken chair trying to steady itself against
a wall black with the dirt of ages. In one corner, on a
shelf, is a battered saucepan and a piece of dry bread. On
the scrap of mantel still remaining embedded in the wall,
is a rag; on a bit of cord hung across the room are
more rags-garments of some sort, possibly; a broken
flower-pot props open a crazy window-frame, possibly to let
the smoke out, or in-looking at the chimney-pots below, it
is difficult to say which; and at one side of the room is a
sack of Heaven knows what-it is a dirty, filthy sack,
greasy and black and evil looking. I cannot guess what
was in it if I tried, but what was on it was a little child-a
neglected, ragged, grimed, and bare-legged little baby girl of
four. There she sat, in the bare squalid room, perched on
the sack, erect, motionless, expressionless, on duty.</p>
<p>She was <soCalled>a little sentinel,</soCalled> left to guard a baby that lay
asleep on the bare boards behind her, its head on its arm,
the ragged remains of what had been a shawl flungover its legs.</p>
<p>That baby needed a sentinel to guard it, indeed. Had it
crawled a foot or two it would have fallen head-foremost in
to that unprotected, yawning abyss of blackness below. In
case of some such proceeding on its part, the child of four
had been left <soCalled>on guard.</soCalled></p>
<p>The furniture of the attic, whatever it was like, had been
seized the week before for rent. The little sentinel's papa
- this we unearthed of the <soCalled>deputy </soCalled> of the house later on-
was a militiaman and away; the little sentinel's mamma
was gone out on <soCalled>a arrand,</soCalled> which, if it was anything
like her usual <soCalled>arrands,</soCalled> the deputy below informed us,
would bring her home about dark, very much the worse for
it. Think of that little child, keeping guard on that dirty
sack for six or eight hours at a stretch-think of her utter
loneliness in that bare, desolate room, every childish impulse
checked, left with orders <q>not to move or I'll kill yer,</q> and
sitting there often till night and darkness came on, hungry,
thirsty, and tired herself, but faithful to her trust to the last
minute of the drunken mother's absence. <q> Bless yer! I've
known that young 'un sit there eight 'our at a stretch. I've
seen her there of a mornin' when I've come up to see if I
could git the rint, and I've seen her there when I've come
agin' at night </q>-says the deputy. <q>Lor, that ain't nothing
-that ain't.</q></p>
<p>Nothing! It is one of the saddest pictures I have seen for
many a day. Poor little baby-sentinel-left with a human
life in its sole charge at four-neglected and overlooked: what
will its girl life be, when it grows old enough to think? I
should like some of the little ones whose every wish is
gratified, who have but to whimper to have, and who live
surrounded by loving, smiling faces, and tendered by gentle
hands, to see the little child in the bare garret sitting sentinel
over the sleeping baby on the floor, and budging never an
inch throughout the weary day from the place that her
mother had bidden her stay in.</p>
<p>With our minds full of this pathetic picture of child-life in
the <soCalled>Homes of the Poor,</soCalled> we descend the crazy staircase,
and get out into as much light as can find its way down
these narrow alleys.</p>
<p>Outside we see a portly gentleman with a big gold chain <figure></>
across his capacious form, and an air of wealth and good
living all over him. He is the owner of a whole block of
property such as this, and he waxes rich on his rents.
Strange as it may seem, these one-roomed outcasts are the <pb id="p.10" n="10">
best paying tenants in London. They pay so much
for so little, and almost fight to get it. That they
should be left to be thus exploited is a disgrace to the
Legislature, which is never tired of protecting the oppressed
of <soCalled>all races that on earth do dwell,</soCalled> except those of that
particular race who have the honour to be free-born
Englishmen.</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" id="c.2" n="2">
<head>CHAPTER II.</head><p><figure n="2000.01.0053.fig00002"></>
<p>As I glance over the notes I have
jotted down during my journey
through outcasts' land, the delicacy of the task I have undertaken comes home to me more
forcibly than ever. The housing
of the poor and the remedy for
the existing state of things are
matters I have so much at heart
that I fear lest I should not
make ample use of the golden
opportunities here afforded me
of ventilating the subject. On
the other hand, I hesitate to
repel the reader, and, unfortunately, the best illustrations of
the evils of overcrowding are repulsive to a degree.</p>
<p>Perhaps if I hint at a few of the very bad cases it will be
sufficient. Men and women of the world will be able to
supply the details and draw the correct deductions; and it
is, after all, only men and women of the world whose
practical sympathy is likely to be enlisted by a revelation of
the truth about the poor of great cities.</p>
<p>Come with me down this court, where at eleven o'clock
in the morning a dead silence reigns. Every house is tenanted, but the blinds of the windows are down and the
doors are shut. Blinds and doors I Yes, these luxuries are
visible here. This is an aristocratic street, and the rents are
paid regularly. There is no grinding poverty, no starvation
here, and no large families to drag at the bread-winner.
There is hardly any child-life here at all, for the men are
thieves and highway cheats, and the women are of the class
which has furnished the companions of such men from the
earliest annals of roguedom.</p>
<p>The colony sleeps though the sun is high. The day with
them is the idle time, and they reap their harvest in the
hours of darkness. Later in the day, towards two o'clock,
there will be signs of life; oaths and shouts will issue from
the now silent rooms, and there will be fierce wrangles and
fights over the division of ill-gotten gains. The spirit
of murder hovers over this spot, for life is held of little
account. There is a Bill Sikes and Nancy in scores of
these tenements, and the brutal blow is ever the accompaniment of the brutal oath.</p>
<p>These people, remember, rub elbows with the honest
labouring poor; their lives are no mystery to the boys and
girls in the neighbourhood; the little girls often fetch
Nancy's gin, and stand in a gaping crowd while Nancy and
Bill exchange compliments on the doorstep, drawn from the
well of Saxon, impure and utterly defiled. The little boys
look up half with awe and half with admiration at the burly
Sikes with his flash style, and delight in gossip concerning
his talents as a <soCalled>cribcracker,</soCalled> and his adventures as a
pickpocket. The poor-the honest poor--have been driven
by the working of the Artizans' Dwellings Acts, and the
clearance of rookery after rookery, to come and herd with
thieves and wantons, to bring up their children in the last
Alsatias, where lawlessness and violence still reign supreme.</p>
<p>The constant association of the poor and the criminal
class has deadened in the former nearly all sense of right
and wrong. In the words of one of them, <q>they can't
afford to be particular about their choice of neighbours.</q> I
was but the other day in a room in this district occupied by
a widow woman, her daughters of seventeen and sixteen,
her sons of fourteen and thirteen, and two younger children
Her wretched apartment was on the street level, and behind
it was the common yard of the tenement. In this yard the
previous night a drunken sailor had been desperately
maltreated and left for dead. I asked the woman, if she
had not heard the noise, and why she didn't interfere.
<q>Heard it?</q> was the reply; <q>well, we ain't deaf, but
they're a rum lot in this here house, and we're used to rows.
There ain't a night passes as there ain't a fight in the
passage or a drunken row; but why should I interfere?
'Tain't no business of mine.</q> As a matter of fact, this
woman, her grown-up daughters, and her boys must have
lain in that room night after night, hearing the most obscene
language, having a perfect knowledge of the proceedings of
the vilest and most depraved of profligate men and women
forced upon them, hearing cries of murder and the sound of
blows, knowing that almost every crime in the Decalogue
was being committed in that awful back yard on which that
broken casement looked, and yet not one of them had ever
dreamed of stirring hand or foot. They were saturated with
the spirit of the place, and though they were respectable
people themselves they saw nothing criminal in the behaviour
of their neighbours.</p>
<p>For this room, with its advantages, the widow paid four
and sixpence a week; the walls were mildewed and streaming with damp, the boards as you trod upon them made the
slushing noise of a plank spread across a mud puddle in a
brickfield: foul within and foul without, these people paid
the rent of it gladly, and perhaps thanked God for the luck
of having it. Rooms for the poor earning precarious livelihoods are too hard to get and too much in demand now for
a widow woman to give up one just because of the trifling
inconvenience of overhearing a few outrages and murders.</p>
<p>One word more on this shady subject and we will get out
into the light again. I have spoken of the familiarity of
the children of the poor with all manners of wickedness
and crime. Of all the evils arising from this one-room
system there is perhaps none greater than the utter destruction of innocence in the young. A moment's thought will
enable the reader to appreciate the evils of it. But if it is <pb id="p.11" n="11">bad in the case of a respectable family, how much more
terrible is it when the children are familiarised with actual
immorality!</p>
<p>Wait outside while we knock at this door.</p>
<p>Knock, knock.-No answer!</p>
<p>Knock, knock, knock!</p>
<p>A child's voice answers, <q>What is it ?</q></p>
<p>We give the answer-the answer which has been our
<soCalled>open, sesame</soCalled> everywhere-and after a pause a woman
opens a door a little and asks us to wait a moment.
Presently we are admitted. A woman pleasing looking and
with a certain refinement in her features holds the door
open for us. She has evidently made a hurried toilet and
put on an ulster over her night attire. <figure n="2000.01.0053.fig00003"><head>Mother and Daughters.</></figure>She has also put a
brass chain and locket round her neck. There is a little
rouge left on her cheeks and a little of the burnt hairpin
colour left under her eyes from overnight. At the table
having their breakfast are two neat and clean little girls
of seven and eight.</p>
<p>They rise and curtsey as we enter. We ask them a few
questions, and they answer intelligently-they are at the
Board School and are making admirable progress-charming children, interesting and well-behaved in every way.
They have a perfect knowledge of good and evil-one of
them has taken a Scripture prize-and yet these two charming and intelligent little girls live in that room night and
day with their mother, and this is the den to which she
snares her dissolute prey.</p>
<p>I would gladly have passed over this scene in silence, but
it is one part of the question which directly bears on the
theory of State interference. It is by shutting our eyes to
evils that we allow them to continue unreformed so long. I
maintain that such cases as these are fit ones for legislative
protection. The State should have the power of rescuing
its future citizens from such surroundings, and the law which
protects young children from physical hurt should also be so
framed as to shield them from moral destruction.</p>
<p>The worst effect of the present system of Packing the
Poor is the moral destruction of the next generation.
Whatever it costs us to remedy the disease we shall gain in
decreased crime and wickedness. It is better even that the
ratepayers should bear a portion of the burthen of new homes for the respectable poor than that they should have
to pay twice as much in the long run for Prisons, Lunatic
Asylums, and Workhouses. </p>
<p>Enough for the present of the criminal classes. Let us
see some of the poor people who earn an honest living-
well, <soCalled>living</soCalled> perhaps, is hardly the word-let us say, who
can earn enough to pay their rent and keep body and soul
together.</p>
<p>Here is a quaint scene, to begin with. When we open
the door we start back half choked. The air is full of
floating fluff, and some of it gets into our mouths and half
chokes us. When we've coughed and wheezed a little we
look about us and gradually take in the situation.</p>
<p>The room is about eight feet square. Seated on the floor<pb id="p.12" n="12">
is a white fairy-a dark-eyed girl who looks as though she
had stepped straight off a twelfth cake. <figure n="2000.01.0053.fig00004"><head>Rabbit-Pulling.</></figure>Her hair is powdered all over a la Pompadour, and the effect is bizarre.
Seated beside her is an older woman, and she is white and
twelfth-cakey too. Alas, their occupation is prosaic to a
degree. They are simply pulling rabbit-skins-that is to
say they are pulling away all the loose fluff and down and
preparing the skins for the furriers, who will use them for
cheap goods, dye them into imitations of rarer skins, and
practise upon them the various tricks of the trade.</p>
<p>Floor, walls, ceiling, every inch of the one room these
people live and sleep in, is covered with fluff and hair.
How they breathe in it is a mystery to me. I tried and
failed, and sought refuge on the doorstep. The pair,
working night and day at their trade, make, when business
is good, about twelve shillings a week. Their rent is four.
This leaves them four shillings a week each to live upon,
and as there is no one else to share it with them, I suppose
they are well-to-do folk.</p>
<p>The younger woman's appearance was striking. Seated
on the floor in an Eastern attitude, and white from top to
toe-the'effect of her dark eyes heightened by the contrast
--she was a picture for an artist, and my fellow-worker
made excellent use of his pencil, while I engaged her and
her mother in conversation.</p>
<p>These people complained bitterly of their surroundings,
of the character of the people they had to live among, and
of the summary proceedings of their landlord, who absolutely refused to repair their room or give them the slightest
convenience.</p>
<p><q>Then why not move?</q> I ventured to suggest. <q>Four
shillings a week-ten guineas a year for this pigstye-is an
exorbitant rent-you might do better.</q></p>
<p>The woman shook her head. <q>There's lots o' better
places we'd like to go to, but they won't have us. They object to our business. We must go where they'll take us.</q> </p>
<p> <q>But there are plenty of places a little way out where
you can have two rooms for what you pay for this.</q><figure ><head> A Protestant Darkie</></figure></p>
<p><q>A little way out, yes; but how are we to get to and fro
with the work when it's done ? We must be near our work.
We can't afford to ride.</q></p> <pb id="p.13" n="13">
<p>Exactly! And therein lies one of the things. which
reformers have to consider. There are thousands of these
families who would go away into the suburbs, where we
want to get them, if only the difficulty of travelling expenses
to and fro could be conquered. They herd together all in
closely packed quarters because they must be where they
can get to the dock, the yard, the wharf, and the warehouses
without expense. The highest earnings of this class is
rarely above sixteen shillings a week, and that, with four or
five shillings for, rent, leaves very little margin where the
family is large. The omnibus and the train are the magicians
which will eventually bid the rookeries disappear, but the
services of these magicians cost money, and there is none
to spare in the pockets of the poor.</p>
<p>In another room close to these people, but if anything in
a more wretched condition still, we come upon a black man
sitting with his head buried in his hands. He is suffering
with rheumatics, and has almost lost the use of his limbs.<figure n="2000.01.0053.fig00006"><head>A Common Kitchen</></figure>
The reason is evident. His wife points to the bed in the
corner against the wall, the damp is absolutely oozing
through and trickling down the wall. The black man is
loquacious. He is a hawker, and can't go out and lay in a
stock, for he hasn't a penny in the world. He is stone
broke. He is a Protestant darkie, he informs us, and is full
of troubles. Two boys are lolling about on the floor. At
our entrance a shock-headed ragged girl of ten has crawled
under the bed. The Protestant darkie drags her out and
explains she is <q>a-bringin' him to his grave with sorrer-
she's a bad gel and slangs her mother.</q> The P. D. doesn't
know how he's going to pay his rent or where the next
meal's coming from. He stands outside <soCalled>a coffee shop </soCalled>
generally, when he can get about, and <q>the lady as keeps it,
bless her-she's a rare good 'un to me-she's a fallen angel,
that's what she is;</q> but he can't go and hawk nothing, else
he'd be took up. <q>I ain't got no capital, and, faith of a
Protestant darkie, I'm defunct.</q> </p>
<p>The man has a host of quaint sayings and plenty of the
peculiar wit of the nigger breed, but his position is undoubtedly desperate.
<p>The rent of the death-trap he lives in with his wife and
family is four and sixpence, and his sole means of subsistence is hawking shrimps and winkles when they are cheap,
or specked oranges and damaged fruit. He has at the best
of times only a shilling or two to lay out in the wholesale
market, and out of his profit he must pay his rent and keep
his family. I suspect that the <soCalled>fallen angel</soCalled> is often good
for a meal to the poor darkie, and I learn that he is a most
respectable, hardworking fellow. <q>How do you do when
you're stone broke?</q> I ask him. <q>Well, sir, sometimes I
comes across a gentleman as gives me a bob and starts me
again.</q>
<p>The shot hits the mark, and we leave the Protestant darkie
grinning at his own success, and debating with his wife what
will be the best article in which to invest for the day's market.</p>
<p>Honest folks enough in their way, these,-keeping themselves to themselves and struggling on as best they can, now
<soCalled>making a bit over,</soCalled> and now wondering where on earth
the next sixpence is to come from. Just up the street is a
house with an inscription over it which tells us we can find
within a very different class to study. This is a licensed
lodging-house, where you can be accommodated for 4d. or
6d. a night. This payment gives you during the day the
privilege of using the common kitchen, and it is into the
common kitchen we are going. We walk into the passage, and
are stopped by a strapping young woman of about eight
and twenty. She is the deputy. <q>What do we want?</q></p>
<p>Once again the password is given, and the attitude of the
lady changes. She formally conducts us into a large room,
where the strangest collection of human beings are crowded
together. It is sheet-washing day, and there is a great fire
roaring up the chimney. Its ruddy glare gives a Rembrandtish tone to the picture. Tables and forms run round <pb id="p.14" n="14">
the room, and there is not a vacant place. Men, women,
and children are lolling about, though it is mid-day, apparently with nothing to do but make themselves comfortable.
The company is not a pleasant one. Many of the men and
women and boys are thieves. Almost every form of disease,
almost every kind of deformity, seems crowded into this
Chamber of Horrors. The features are mostly repulsive
an attractive face there is not among the sixty or seventy
human beings in the room. Some of them are tramps and
hawkers, but most of them are professional loafers, picking
up in any way that presents itself the price of a night's
lodging. They are a shifting population, and rarely remain in
one house long. Some of them only get a night in now
and then as a luxury, and look upon it as a Grand Hotel
episode. They sleep habitually in the open, on the staircases, or in the casual ward. The house we are in is one
where Nancy and Sikes come often enough when they are
down on their luck. Here is a true story of this very place,
which will perhaps illustrate sufficiently the type of its
frequenters.</p>
<p>Some time last year two men left the house one morning.
They were going into the country on business. One, whom
I will call John, kissed his mistress, a girl of twenty, and
said <q>Good-bye,</q> leaving her at the house; he wouldn't be
away long, and he and Bill, his companion, set out on their
travels.
<p>A day or two after Bill returns alone, the girl asks him
where her sweetheart is. <q>He's lagged,</q> says Bill. But
the girl has a bit of newspaper, and in it she reads that
<q>the body of a man has been found in some woods near
London;</q> and she has an idea it may be John. <q>Oh,
nonsense,</q> says Bill-I quote the evidence-<q>he then lit
his candle, and they retired to rest.</q> John, as a matter of
fact, had been murdered by his companion, they having
quarrelled over the division of the proceeds of the burglary;
and eventually this young woman, who so readily transferred
her affections from one lord to another, appeared in the
witness-box and deposed to pawning boots and other things
for Bill which were undoubtedly the proceeds of a robbery
at a house close to where the body was found.</p>
<p>This is the house in which we stand where the burglary
was planned-whence the murderer and the murdered set
out together on their fatal journey. It was at one of these
tables that the young girl discussed her absent lover's fate
with her new lord his murderer, and it was here that the
police came to search for him and found the gill whose
evidence helped to hang him.</p>
<p>Look at the people who sit there to-day-murderers and
burglars some of them, cheats and pickpockets others, and
a few respectable folks as far as their opportunities will
allow. But remember that dozens of really respectable
families do have to frequent these places now, and mix with
malefactors day and night, because there are no other places
open to them.</p>
<p>Among all the cruelties practised on the poor in the
name of Metropolitan Improvements this one deserves
mentioning-that the labourer. earning a precarious livelihood with his wife and his children have been driven at
last to accept the shelter of a thieves' kitchen and to be
thankful for it.</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" id="c.3" n="3">
<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<p>I CANNOT help being struck, in my wanderings through
Povertyopolis, with the extraordinary resemblance which
Caesar bore to Pompey-especially Pompey. One room in
this district is very like the other. The family likeness of
the chairs and tables is truly remarkable, especially in the
matter of legs. Most chairs are born with four legs, but
the chairs one meets with here are a two-legged race-a
four-legged chair is a rara avis, and when found should be
made a note of. The tables, too, are of a type indigenous
to the spot. The survival of the fittest does not obtain in
these districts in the matter of tables. The most positively
unfit are common, very common objects. What has
become of the fittest I hesitate to conjecture. Possibly
they have run away. I am quite sure that a table with legs
would make use of them to escape from such surroundings.</p>
<p>As to the bedsteads. they are wretched, broken-down old <figure n="2000.01.0053.fig00007"><head>A Furnished Apartment</></figure>
things of wood and iron that look as though they had been
rescued a little late from a fire, then used for a barricade,
afterwards buried in volcanic eruption, and finally dug out
of a dust-heap that had concealed them for a century. The
bedding, a respectable coal-sack would blush to acknowledge
even as a poor relation.</p>
<p>I have enumerated chairs, tables, and beds-not because
they are found in every poor home; there are several rented
rooms which can boast of nothing but four walls, a ceiling,
and a floor, but because these articles placed in one of
these dens constitute what are euphemistically called <soCalled>furnished apartments,</soCalled> a species of accommodation with which
all very poor neighbourhoods abound.</p>
<p>The <soCalled>furnished apartments </soCalled>fetch as much as tenpence
a day, and are sometimes occupied by three or four different
tenants during a week.</p>
<p>The <soCalled>deputy </soCalled> comes for the money every day, and it is
pay or go with the occupants. If the man who has taken <pb id="p.15" n="15">
one of these furnished rooms for his <soCalled>home, sweet home,</soCalled>
does not get enough during the day to pay his rent, out he
goes into the street with his wife and children, and enter
another family forthwith.</p>
<p>The tenants have not, as a rule, much to be flung after
them in the shape of goods and chattels. The clothes they
stand upright in, a battered kettle and, perhaps, a bundle,
make up the catalogue of their worldly possessions.</p>
<p>This rough-and-ready lodging is the resource of thousands
of industrious people earning precarious livelihoods, and
they rarely rise above it to the dignity of taking a room by
the week. The great struggle is to get over Saturday, and
thank God for Sunday. Sunday is a free day, and no
deputy comes to disturb its peaceful calm. The Saturday's
rent, according to the custom of the country, makes the
tenant free of the apartments until Monday.</p>
<p>It is the custom to denounce the poor as thriftless, and
that they are so I grant. The temptation to trust to luck
and let every day take care of itself is, it must be remembered, great. Life with them is always a toss-up, a daily
battle, an hourly struggle. Thousands of them can never
hope to be five shillings ahead of the world if they keep
honest. The utmost limit of their wage is reached when
they have paid the rent, kept themselves and their horribly
large families from starvation, and bought the few rags
which keep their limbs decently covered. With them the
object of life is attained when the night's rent is paid, and
they do not have to hesitate between the workhouse or a
corner of the staircase in some doorless house.</p>
<p>There is a legend in one street I know of-a man who
once saved half-a-crown, and lost it through a hole in his
pocket. The moral of that legend may have improved
itself upon the whole population and discouraged thrift for
evermore; but be that as it may, the general rule is, <q>what
you make in a day, spend in a day.</q> It is needless to add
that this precept brings its practisers perpetually within
measureable distance of absolute penniless. They live and
die on the confines of it. I am wrong; they invariably die
on the wrong side of the border, and are buried at somebody else's expense.</p>
<p>Drink is the curse of these communities; but how is it
to be wondered at? The gin-palaces flourish in the slums,
and fortunes are made out of men and women who seldom
know where to-morrow's meal is coming from.
Can you wonder that the gaudy gin-palaces, with their
light and their glitter, are crowded ? Drink is sustenance
to these people; drink gives them the Dutch courage
necessary to go on living; drinks dulls their senses and
reduces them to the level of the brutes they must be to live
in such styes.</p>
<p>The gin-palace is Heaven to them compared to the Hell
of their pestilent homes. A copper or two often obtained
by pawning the last rag that covers the shivering children
on the bare floor at home will buy enough vitriol madness
to send a woman home so besotted that the wretchedness,
the anguish, the degradation that await her there have lost
their grip. To be drunk with these people means to be
happy. Sober - God help them! - how could they be aught
but wretched?</p>
<p>There is not only temptation to drink wrought by the
fearful surroundings of the poor; a positive craving for it is
engendered by the foul and fetid atmosphere they continually breathe. I have often wondered that the advocates of
temperance, with the immense resources of wealth and
organisation they command, have not given more attention
to the overcrowding and the unsanitary condition of the
dwellings of the poor, as one of the great causes of the
abuse of stimulants.</p>
<p>It is not only that crime and vice and disorder flourish
luxuriantly in these colonies, through the dirt and discomfort
bred of intemperance of the inhabitants, but the effect upon
the children is terrible. The offspring of drunken fathers
and mothers inherit not only a tendency to vice, but they
come into the world physically and mentally unfit to
conquer in life's battle. The wretched, stunted, mis-shapen
child-object one comes upon in these localities, is the most
painful part of our explorers' experience. The county
asylums are crowded with pauper idiots and lunatics, who
owe their wretched condition to the sin of the parents, and
the rates are heavily burthened with the maintenance of the
idiot offspring of drunkenness.</p>
<p>The drink dulls every sense of shame, takes the sharp
edge from sorrow, and leaves the drinker for a while in a
fool's paradise. Here is the home of the most notorious
<soCalled>drunkardess </soCalled>-if I may coin a word-in the neighbourhood. Mrs. O'Flannigan's room is easily entered, for it is
on the street level, and one step brings us into the presence
of the lady herself. She is in bed, a dirty red flannel rag
is wrapped about her shoulders, and her one arm is in a
sling. She sits up in bed at the sight of visitors, and greets us
in a gin and fog voice slightly mellowed with the Irish brogue.
Biddy has been charged at the police-courts seventy-five
times with being drunk, and she is therefore a celebrated
character. She is hardly sober now, though she has evidently had a shaking which would have sobered most people
for a month. Her face is a mass of bruises and cuts, and
every now and then a groan and a cry to certain Saints in
her calendar tell of aches and pains in the limbs concealed
under the dirty blanket that covers the bed.</p>
<p><q>I'm a pretty sight now, ain't I, gintlemen dear?</q> she
says, with a foolish laugh. <q>Shure and I got blind drunk
again last Saturday, and they run me in. The inspector let
me out o' Sunday: God bless him for a rale gintleman.
They carried me on a stretcher, bless yer hearts, and I
kicked. Ha! ha! ha!</q> The hag positively yelled with
laughter as she thought of the scene she caused and the
trouble she gave the police.</p>
<p>Suddenly she looks round as if in search of something.</p>
<p><q>Molly, ye young varmint, where are ye?</q> she shouts, and
presently, from under the bed, where it lay crouching in
fear, she drags a child, a wretched little girl of seven or
eight, with its face and head a covered with sores, that make
one shudder to look at them.</p>
<p><q>There, Molly, ye young varmint, show yourself to their
honours, will ye?</q></p>
<p>The child begins to snivel. One of our number is the
Board School officer of the district, and Molly has not been
to school lately.</p> <pb id="p.16" n="16"><p><figure n="2000.01.0053.fig00008"><head>A Roaring Trade</></figure><pb n="17" id="p.17">
<p>Mrs. O'Flannigan explains.</p>
<p><q>Ye see, I can't use my limbs just yet, yer honour, and
Molly-Lord love her !- she's just the only thing I got to
look afther me. I might be burned in my blessed bed, yer
honour, and not able to move.</q></p>
<p><q>You should give up getting drunk,</q> I ventured to
suggest; <q>then you wouldn't want a nurse.</q></p>
<p><q>You're right, your honour. It's the drink. Yer see, I
can't help it. I ain't been sober for five years-ha! ha! ha!
-and it's all thro' the trouble as come to me. My boy got
into bad company and got lagged and put away for ten
years, and I've never been the same since, and it broke my
heart, and I took to the drink. And now my old man's
took to drink thro' aggravation o' me, and he gets drunk
every night of his blessed life. Ha! ha! ha!</q></p>
<p>The woman's story is practially true. <figure n="2000.01.0053.fig00009"><head>Mrs. O'Flannigan</></figure> Before her trouble
she and her husband were costermongers and hawkers of
fruit. The first of the evils of the foul slums where honest
workers are forced to live, fell upon them in the ruin of the
boy reared in a criminal atmosphere. The vicious surroundings were too strong for him, and he became a thief and
paid the penalty.</p>
<p>The mother sees her son-idolised in her rough waytaken from her; the den of a home becomes doubly
wretched, and the cursed drink-fiend is invoked to charm
the sorrow away. That is the first step <soCalled>to drown sorrow.</soCalled>
The steps after that are easy to count. The woman becomes
an habitual drunkard, the rooms they live in get dirtier and
smaller and fouler, and at last the husband drowns his
sorrow too. <soCalled>Aggravation</soCalled> and a constant association
with a drunken woman turn the poor fellow to evil ways;
himself and a whole family are wrecked, that under better
circumstances might have been good and useful citizens.
Had these people been able to get a decent room among
decent people, the first misfortune that sent them wrong
might never have happened. Their case is the case of
hundreds.</p>
<p>Of drinking-shops there are plenty in these places; of
eating-houses, or shops for the sale of food, very few. So
rare are the latter that when we come to one in a dirty,
tumble-down street, we stop and examine the contents of
the window. I don't know whether to call it a tart-shop, a
baker's, or a dripping emporium. There seems to be a
little bit of each about it, and half a rice-pudding, and a
ham-bone, on which a bluebottle has gone to sleep-tired
out perhaps with looking for the meat-give it the faintest
suspicion of being an eating-house. There is also in the
window a dilapidated bloater which looks as though it had
been run over by an omnibus many years ago.</p>
<p>It is while taking notes of the contents of this tempting
emporium of luxuries that we become aware of a very
powerful perfume. It seems to rise from beneath where we
are standing, and used as we are by this time to the
bouquets of the east, we involuntarily step back and contort
the muscles of our faces.</p>
<p>Then we see that we have been standing on a grating.
Peering down we can just see into a gloomy little room.
To the opened window presently there comes a man in his
shirt-sleeves and looks up at us. His face is deadly white,
the eyes are sunken, the cheek bones hollow, and there is a
look in his face that says more plainly than the big ticket of
the blind impostor, <q>I am starving.</q> Starving down below
there, with only a thin floor between himself and the hambone, the ancient herring, the rice pudding, and the treacle
tarts.</p>
<p>As the noisome effluvia rises and steams through the<pb id="p.18" n="18">
grating we begin to appreciate the situation. This food
shop is directly over the cellar which gives the odour forth.
Pleasant for the customers, certainly. <figure n="2000.01.0053.fig00010"><head>The Tart Shop</></figure> We determine to
push our investigation still further, and presently we are
down in the cellar below.</p>
<p>The man in his shirt-sleeves-we can guess where the
coat is-receives us courteously. His wife apologises for
the wretched condition of the room. <figure n="2000.01.0053.fig00011"><head>The Occupant of the Cellar </></figure> Both of them speak
with that unmistakable timbre of voice which betokens a
smattering of education. In the corner of the room
is a heap of rags. That is the bed. There are two children, a boy and a girl, sitting on a bare hearth and
gazing into the fast-dying embers of a wretched fire. Furniture the room has absolutely none, but a stool roughly
constructed of three pieces of unplaned wood nailed
together.</p>
<p>Four shillings a week is the rent of the cellar below the
pie-shop-the foul smell arises from the gradual decay of the
basement and the utter neglect of all sanitary precautions.</p>
<p>The man (who has only one arm) is out of work this
week, he tells us, but he is promised a job next. To tide
over till then is a work of some difficulty, but the <soCalled>sticks</soCalled>
and the <soCalled>wardrobe</soCalled> of the family have paid the rent up to
now. As to meals-well, they hain't got much appetite.
The stench in which they live effectually destroys that. In
this instance even bad drainage has its advantages, you see.</p>
<p>Before the man lost his arm he was a clerk; without a
right hand he is not much good as a penman in a competitive market. So he goes on as timekeeper in a builder's
yard, as a messenger, or as anything he can get a few
shillings at for a living. <figure n="2000.01.0053.fig00012"><head>A Foot-Note</></figure></p>
<p>The children have not been to school. <q>Why?</q> asks
the officer who accompanies us. <q>Because they've no
boots, and they are both ill now.</q> It is true. The children,
pale, emaciated little things, cough a hard rasping cough
from time to time. To show us how bad they are they set
up a perfect paroxysm of coughing until the mother fetches
them a smack, and inquires <q>how they expect the gentleman to hear himself speak if they kick up that row ?</q></p>
<p>The children's boots have gone with the father's coat,
and at present it does seem hard to say that the parents
must be fined unless the children come barefooted through
the sloppy streets to school.</p>
<p>Such, however, is the rule, and this boot question is an
all-important one in the compulsory education of the children of the slums. How to get the boots for Tommy and
Sarah to go their daily journey to the Board School is a <pb id="p.19" n="19">
problem which one or two unhappy fathers have settled by
hanging themselves behind the domestic door. </p>
<p>The difficulties which the poor have in complying with
the demands of the Education Act are quite unsuspected
by the general public. They are so numerous, and the
histories revealed by their investigation are so strange, that
I propose in the next Chapter to ask the reader to accompany
me to a meeting at which the parental excuses for non-attendance are made. This is a meeting at which the
parents who have been summoned for the non-attendance
of their children adduce what reasons they can why they
should not be summoned before a magistrate.
<p>I will let the mothers and fathers tell their own tale, and
give a few statistics which I fancy will be revelation to many
who are at present in sublime ignorance of
<q>HOW THE POOR LIVE.</q> </p> </div1>
<div1 type="chapter" id="c.4" n="4">
<Head>CHAPTER IV.</Head>
<p>IN the remote age when I was a good little boy I remember being induced to join a Dorcas meeting. Don't imagine
that I ever so far forgot the dignity of my sex as to sew or
make little flannel petticoats and baby-linen for the poor of
the parish. The young ladies did that, and we-myself and
about ten other good little boys-were inveigled into joining
on the plea, that while our sisters plied needle and thread
we could stick scraps into books and colour them, make
toys, and perform various other little feats of usefulness
which would eventually benefit the benighted Hottentots.<p>
<p>I know that when I had consented to join I was in agonies
till the first day of meeting arrived, and wondered to what
I had committed myself; and I remember to this day
how very red I blushed when I arrived late and found fifty
other good little boys and girls assembled, all of whom
looked up and eyed me as though I was a natural curiosity,
when the good lady who directed the society said, <q>This is
little Master So-and-so, who has come to help us in our
good work.</q></p>
<p>How I got past all those little girls I don't know, but
I kept my eyes fixed modestly on the ground, and at last
found myself seated at a table with about a dozen young
gentlemen of my own age.</p>
<p>The elderly, good-hearted spinster who presided instantly
deposited in front of me a huge pot of paste, an empty
book, and some old illustrated papers. I guessed what she
intended me to do, and I made wild efforts to do it. I was
informed that this book, when I had completed it, would be
sold at a bazaar for the benefit of the Heathen.</p>
<p>I never ascertained what that book did fetch, but I know
that it never paid expenses. The mess that I got into with
that paste, the way it would get all over my fingers and on to
my coat-sleeve, and all down me and all over me-why, I
wrecked a whole suit, which in my vanity I put on new, at
a single sitting. That was my first introduction to scissors
and paste, and I took an intense dislike to them.</p>
<p>I quote the reminiscence because this article is to be all
about a <soCalled>B</soCalled> meeting; and when I first heard of a <soCalled>B</soCalled>
meeting I made sure it must be something like a Dorcas
meeting, where everybody was a busy bee, and did work for
the poor.</p>
<p>I had not had a very long experience before I found out
that it was something not half so pleasant as the scrap-book
and flannel petticoat society of my youth.</p>
<p>A <soCalled>B</soCalled> meeting is held under the auspices of the School
Board, to hear the reasons parents may have to give why
they should not be summoned to appear before a magistrate
for neglecting to send their children to school.</p>
<p>Here is an exact reproduction of the Notice B left with

To Mr. Bridge, 2, Smith's Court.
Take Notice, that you have been guilty of a breach of the
law in that your child Robert has not duly attended school, and you
are hereby invited to attend at George Street School on Wednesday,
the 6th day of June, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon precisely, to state
any excuse you may have, and to show cause why you should not be
summoned before a magistrate and fined.
Dated this 31st day of May,<date value="1883">1883</date>.
(Signed) ............... .....
Officer of the <rs type=org>School Board</rs> for London.
(SEAL.)</p>
<p>Few persons who have not actual experience of the lives
of the poorest classes can have any conception of the serious
import to them of the Education Act. Compulsory education is a national benefit. I am one of its stoutest defenders,
but it is idle to deny that it is an Act which has gravely
increased the burthens of the poor earning precarious
livelihoods; and as self-preservation is the first law of
nature, there is small wonder that every dodge that craft
and cunning can suggest is practised to evade it.</p>
<p>In many cases the payment of the fees is a most serious
difficulty. Twopence or a penny a week for each of four
children is not much, you may say; but where the difference
between the weekly income and the rent is only a couple of
shillings or so, I assure you the coppers represent so many
meals. The Board now allows the members to remit fees
in cases of absolute inability to pay them, and the remission
of fees is one of the principal items of business at a <soCalled>B</soCalled>
meeting.</p>
<p>Again, many of the children who are of school age are of
a wage-earning age also, and their enforced <soCalled>idleness,</soCalled> as
their parents call it, means a very serious blow to the family
exchequer. Many a lad whose thick skull keeps him from
passing the standard which would leave him free to go to
work, has a deft hand, strong arms, and a broad back-
three things which fetch a fair price in the labour market.
As I will show you presently, from the actual cases which
come before the <soCalled>B </soCalled> meeting, the hardship of making boys <pb id="p.20" n="20">
<figure n="2000.01.0053.fig00012"><head>A "B" Meeting</></figure><pb id="p.21" n="21">and girls stop at school who might be earning good money
towards their support, is terrible. Often these children are
the sole bread-winners, and then the position is indeed a
hard nut for the kind-hearted official to crack.</p>
<p>After the children have passed a certain standard the
officials have the power of granting <soCalled>half-time</soCalled>; that is to
say, the boys and girls can earn money so many days a week,
and come to school for the remainder. <soCalled>The half-time
grant</soCalled> is another feature of the <soCalled>B</soCalled> meeting.</p>
<p>The worst duty of the official who presides is to authorise
the summoning before a magistrate of the parents who
cannot or will not send their children regularly. The law
leaves him no option. All children must come unless
illness or some equally potent excuse can be urged, and
if they don't the parent must appear before a magistrate,
who, if the case is made out, is bound by the law to
impose a fine. I will endeavour to show you, as the
meeting progresses, a few of the parents who thoroughly
deserve the penalty.</p>
<p>A <soCalled>B </soCalled> meeting is held in the up-stairs room of one of
the Board Schools. Here is a sketch of one in full swing.
The summoned parents are waiting in a huge crowd outside.
They come in one by one to be disposed of. You will
easily recognise the president of the meeting, with the book
before him, in which the cases to be heard are fully entered
up. Beside him sits the Board official, the inspector of
officers, who advises him on little points of School Board
law, and who marks the papers which are to be returned
to the School Board officer <soCalled>in charge of the case </soCalled> to be
acted upon.</p>
<p>The gentlemen standing round the room are the School
Board officers of the different divisions in the district. They
are familiar with the history and circumstances of every one
who will come into the little room, and they will supply confirmation or contradiction as the necessity arises.</p>
<p>Somewhere or other in the scene the artist has, I perceive,
depicted <soCalled>us.</soCalled> Where, I leave the reader to discover. We
are accepted by the parents who come and go as
part and parcel of the <soCalled>Inquisition,</soCalled> and some care is
necessary in executing our task, for this class is very great
on the rights of property; and more than one energetic
dame, if she knew her face was being <soCalled>scratched </soCalled> by
an unauthorised interloper, would literally return the
compliment.</p>
<p><soCalled>The short and simple annals of the poor,</soCalled> here related
in their own words, will induct the reader into the mysteries
of <soCalled>How they live</soCalled> far more thoroughly than I could
do did I fill pages with my own composition; so, silence,
pray, and let the <soCalled>B</soCalled> meeting commence.</p>
<p>Here is a lady who very much objects to being summoned.</p>
<p><q>What bizerness 'as he to summings me,</q> she says,
pointing to the officer, <q>just cus my boy ain't bin fur a
week? He's 'arsh and harbitury, that's what he is. 'Arsh
and harbitury. D'ye think I ain't got anything to do
without a-trapesin' down here a-losin' my work. I tell ye
what it is --</q></p>
<p>The chairman mildly interposes-- <q>My good lady--</q></p>
<p><q>Don't good lady me. I ain't a lady. If I was you
daren't treat me like it, you daren't; it's only because
I'm-</q></p>
<p><q>My good woman, will you allow me to say one word?</q></p>
<p><q>Oh--yes-certainly-if you've got anything to say-
go on.</q></p>
<p>Thus encouraged the chairman points out to the voluble
lady that her son has not been to school for a fortnight.</p>
<p><q>Well, it's all through the boots,</q></p>
<p><q>Boots!</q> says the chairman; <q>why, that was what you
said last time, and we gave you an order on a shoemaker
for a pair.</q></p>
<p>The woman acknowledges this is so. Some charitable
people have started a fund to let a few bad cases have boots,
and this truant has been one of the first recipients.</p>
<p><q>I know you was kind enough to do that,</q> says the
mother, <q>but they 'urt him' and he can't wear 'em.</q> <figure><head>He's 'arsh and harbitury, that's what he is. 'Arsh
and harbitury.</></figure></p>
<p>Here the officer who has brought the lady up before the
Board tells his story.</p>
<p><q>The boy had a decent pair of boots supplied him, sir;
but Mrs. Dash went back to the shop with him, and said
they weren't good enough-she wanted a pair of the best
the man had in stock, and made such a noise she had to be
put out.</q></p>
<p><q>Which, beggin' your pardon,</q> strikes in the angry
lady, <q>it's like your imperence to say so. They 'urt the
boy, they did, and he haves tender feet, through his father,
as is dead, being a shoemaker hisself.</q></p>
<p>The officer chimes in again, <q>If he can play about the
streets all day in the boots, Mrs. Dash, they can't hurt
him very much.</q></p>
<p><q>My boy play about the streets! Well, of all the oudacious things as ever I 'erd And as to his comin' to school <pb id="p.22" n="22">
he's a beautiful little scholard now, and he ain't got no more
to learn.</q></p>
<p>Eventually the <soCalled>beautiful little scholard,</soCalled> who was waiting outside, was sent for. Here he is.<figure n="2000.01.0053.fig00015"><head> A Beautiful Little Scholard</></figure></p>
<p>He confessed that the boots didn't hurt him, and Mrs.
Dash was informed that if he didn't forthwith attend she
would be summoned.</p>
<p>With much difficulty Mrs. Dash was induced to retire,<figure><head>I'm very sorry,
sir, but I've had a little trouble.</></figure>
and her place was taken by a burly man covered with grime
from a forge, or something of the sort, who looked the personification of fierceness and stoney-heartedness. His
daughter had not been to school lately, arid he was asked
to account for her absence.</p>
<p>There was a moment's pause. We expected an oath, or a
volley of abuse. Instead of that the man's lips trembled
a moment, then his eyes filled with tears, and one rolled
slowly down each grimy cheek.</p>
<p>In a choking voice he gasped out, <q>I am very sorry,
sir, but I've had a little trouble,</q></p>
<p><q>Dear me! </q>says the chairman, slightly staggered at the
unusual display of emotion; <q>I am sorry for that. What
sort of trouble ? </q></p>
<p><q>Well, sir, it ain't a pleasant thing to talk about,</q>-sob-
<q>but my wife,</q>-sob-<q> she's left me, sir,</q>-sob-<q>gone
away with another man.</q></p>
<p>Here the poor fellow broke down utterly and sobbed like
a child. Then he drew a dirty rag from his pocket, and
rubbed and rubbed it round his eyes till there was a white
ring about them that looked like a pair of spectacles.</p>
<p>The effect was ludicrous, but no one smiled. The audience,
as they say in theatrical notices, was visibly affected.</p>
<p>The man stammered out his tale bit by bit. His wife
had left him with four little children. He had to go out to
work, and his daughter he had to keep away from school to
look after them. She had to be <soCalled>little mother</soCalled> in the
deserted home.</p>
<p>I wondered what the woman was like, and if she had any
idea of the genuine love for her that welled up in this
honest fellow's heart. As I watched the tears flow down
his grimy face, I couldn't help thinking how many a noble
dame would like to know that her absence from the domestic
hearth would cause grief as genuine as this.</p>
<p>Under the painful circumstances the excuse was accepted;
the <soCalled>little mother</soCalled> was allowed a short holiday till the
betrayed husband had time to make other arrangements,
and he left the room murmuring his thanks and mopping
his eyes.</p>
<p><q>Mrs. Smith,</q> calls out the Board official, taking the
next case down on the list for hearing, and a young girl of
about fifteen, with a baby in her arms and a child of five
clinging to her skirts, enters the room and seats herself
nervously on the extreme edge of the chair.</p>
<p><q>You're not Mrs. Smith, my dear,</q> says the chairman,
with a smile.</p>
<p><q>No, sir; that's mother.</q></p>
<p><q>Oh, you've come for her, eh? These boys, Thomas
and Charles, who have been absent for three weeks, are
your brothers, I suppose ?</q></p>
<p><q>Yes, sir.</q></p>
<p><q>Well, my dear, they ought to come, you know. What's
the reason?</q></p>
<p><q>Please, sir, they're at work.</q></p>
<p><q>But they've not passed the Fourth Standard.</q></p>
<p><q>I know, sir; but they've got a job, and it's four shillings
a week each, and that's all I've got to keep us.</q></p>
<p><q> All you've got, my dear ? Where's your father ?</q></p>
<p>The girl colours a little and hesitates. The School Board
officer steps forward to the table and helps her.</p>
<p><q>It's a very painful case, sir,</q> he says. <q>The father's
been living with another woman-left his family. A fortnight
ago the mother met him and asked him for some money.
He knocked her down, and she fell and cut her head open.<pb id="p.23" n="23">
She's in St. Thomas's Hospital-not expected to live. The
man was taken up, and he's under remand now, and this
girl has to look after the entire family.</q></p>
<p><q>I see,</q> says the chairman; <q>and Thomas and Charles
are giving you their money, eh? and that's all you've got?</q></p>
<p><q>Yes, sir. I can't work myself, because I've got the
baby and the others to look after,</q><figure><head>Yes, sir. I can't work myself, because I've got the
baby and the others to look after.</></figure></p>
<p><q>Well, my dear,</q> says the chairman, <q>I am very sorry
for you, but your brothers can only have half-time or
come back to school.</q></p>
<p>The girl says nothing, she is only fifteen, and can't argue
it out with the gentleman-so she curtseys and is ushered
out. I wonder, if the mother dies and the father gets a long
term of imprisonment, what the fate of the family will be ?</p>
<p>I have said that the hardships entailed upon the poor by
the Education Act are numerous. Let me quote a few
statistics gleaned from the papers which I turn over on the
chairman's desk by his kind permission.</p>
<p>They are cases in which the parents apply to have the
fees remitted because they cannot afford to pay them. <list>
<item>1. Mrs. Walker. 7 children of school age, fee 2d. a week
each. Total earnings of entire family 10s. Rent
5s. 6d. Husband once good mechanic, lost employment through illness and deafness. Parish relief none.
Character good. Is now a hawker-sells oranges and
fish. Children half-starved. When an orange is too
bad to sell they have it for breakfast, with a piece of
bread.
<item>2. Mr. Thompson. 5 children of school age. Out of
work. No income but pawning clothes and goods.
Rent 4s. Wife drinks surreptitiously. Husband, good
character.
<item>3. Mrs.--. 5 children of school age; widow. Earnings 6s. Rent 3s. Her husband when alive was a
Drury Lane clown. Respectable woman; feels her
poverty very keenly.
<item>4. Mr. Garrard. 8 children of school age; two always
under doctor. No income. Pawning last rags. Rent
5s. 6d. No parish relief. Starving. Declines to
go into workhouse.</list>
<p>I could multiply such instances by hundreds. These,
however, ill suffice to show how serious a burden is added
to the lives of the very poor by the enforced payment of
school fees. As a rule they are remitted for very good
and sufficient reasons.</p>
<p>How these people live is a mystery. It is a wonder that
they are not found dead in their wretched dens, for which
they pay a rent out of all proportion to their value, by
dozens daily. But they live on, and the starving children
come day after day to school with feeble frames and bloodless
bodies, and the law expects them to learn as readily as
well-fed, healthy children, to attain the same standard of
proficiency in a given time.</p>
<p>It is these starving children who are not allowed to earn
money towards their support until they are thirteen, and in
many cases fourteen. Less necessitous children, as a rule,
pass out of school earlier, for reasons which will be obvious
to any one who reflects for a moment upon the relationship
of a healthy brain to a healthy body.</p>
<p>In another Chapter we shall hear a few more personal
narrations at a <soCalled>B</soCalled> meeting. I will conclude this one
with a picture of a young gentleman whose excuse for
non-attendance is at least dramatic.<figure><head>A Budding Pro</></figure>  He has been absent
for six weeks, and his mother explains, <q>It's all along of 'is
aven a reglar engagement at the Surrey Pantermine, and
there hev been so many matynees.</q></p> <pb id="p.24" n="24">
<p><q>He's on the Surrey, is he?</q> says the chairman.
<q>Perhaps that's the reason he can't pass the Standard!</q>
<p>We see the joke and chuckle, but the boy doesn't.
Evidently his pantomime training has been thrown away
upon him.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" id="c.5" n="5"><head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<p>THE ladies and gentlemen whom I had the pleasure of
introducing to you in the last chapter, had, most of them,
some good and sufficient excuse for the non-attendance of
their children at school. Before the <soCalled>B </soCalled> meeting at which
we assisted was over, more than one case was examined,
which left the official no option but to take out a summons
and run the risk of one of those amiable lectures which unthinking magistrates now and again see fit to bestow upon
the luckless officer of the Board who has done what the law
compels him to do, and no more.</p>
<p>The parents summoned are in many instances dissolute
or careless people, who utterly neglect their offspring, and
take no pains to ensure their attending school, or they are
crafty, cunning wretches, who see in the law a means of
attaining a consummation devoutly to be wished.</p>
<p>Here is a woman who, when asked why her boy of nine
has not been to school for a month, declares that he plays <figure><head> The Truant's Mamma</></figure>
truant, and that he is quite beyond her control. Now
the result of such a complaint is, that the young gentleman
will, if the parent reiterates in court her statement, be sent
to a reformatory for five years.</p>
<p>That is just what the good lady wants. Her story is one
that may be instructive if not edifying.</p>
<p>Two years ago her husband got ten years' penal servitude
for a heavy fracture of his country's laws, leaving her with
three children, two boys and a girl. There is a custom in
such districts as that of which I write which shortens the
period of mourning for a lost mate very considerably.
Directly husband <soCalled>No. </soCalled> gets forcibly removed from the
domestic hearth, his place is almost invariably taken by
another gentleman, who is <soCalled>master of the situation,</soCalled> and
locum tenens with full family honours.</p>
<p>I cannot resist telling a little story apropos of this domestic
phase of slum life, which illustrates it rather forcibly. A
little girl of eight at one of the schools near the Mint came
one morning with a pair of boots on her little feet. This
was the first pair of boots she had ever been seen in, and
the unwonted magnificence naturally attracted attention.</p>
<p><q>Why, Annie, you've got a pair of boots at last, then !</q>
exclaimed the governess.</p>
<p><q>Yes, mistress,</q> the child replied, glancing proudly at
the battered, second-hand shoes, three times too large
for her.</p>
<p><q>And where did you get them?</q></p>
<p><q>One of my fathers gave 'em to me, mistress; the one
what's at home this week.</q></p>
<p>This <soCalled>father</soCalled> was evidently a better fellow than most of
the nomadic husbands who wander about from family circle
to family circle, ready to replace its absent head at a
moment's notice. He must have been more generous to
another man's child than the <soCalled>husband</soCalled> of the lady whose
history I have so unceremoniously interrupted, and who
wants her boy put away in a reformatory.</p>
<p>Husband <soCalled>No. 2,</soCalled> I gather from one who knows the
history of the case, is a young fellow who objects to <soCalled>brats,</soCalled>
and the <soCalled>brats </soCalled> are being got out of the way one by one.
The eldest boy was put to thieving, and he is being kept
now by the State; the girl took to something worse,
and a benevolent society relieved the mother of any future
liability on her behalf. And now the good lady comes to
the <soCalled> B</soCalled> meeting and declares the youngest boy is incorrigible, and hints as broadly as she dare that she should be
glad to have him put away as well. She will have her wish,
and the boy, whom in all probability she has wilfully kept
away and encouraged in his incorrigibleness, will be sent to
a reformatory within a fortnight.</p>
<p>Thus you see a wholesale clearance has been made of one
family, and the room they took up at home will soon be
utilized by new-comers, in the shape of family number two.</p>
<p>A more charming and ingenious way of disposing of incumbrances it is difficult to imagine. It is not, however, by
any means uncommon.</p>
<p>Marriage, as an institution, is not fashionable in these
districts. Yet so long as cohabitation is possible, that is to
say, so long as neither the hospital, the prison, nor the
churchyard effects a separation, the couples are fairly faith
ful, and look upon themselves as man and wife, with the
usual marital obligations.</p>
<p>Both parties to the arrangement exhibit great reluctance
to <soCalled>break</soCalled> of their own free will, and it is marvellous to
see the tenacity with which a decent hard-working woman
will cling to a ruffian who spends her earnings and blackens
her eye, as regularly as Saturday night comes round;
although he has not the slightest legal claim on her
allegiance.</p>
<p>If you ask the couples who live happily together why <pb id="p.25" n="25"> <p><figure><head>Waiting for the Verdicts</></figure></p><pb n="26" id="p.26"><p>
they don't get married, some will tell you frankly that they
never gave it a thought, others that it's a lot of trouble and
they haven't had time. A clergyman's wife who took intense interest in a young couple living together in a room
in the Mint determined to make them get married. The
young fellow earned fair wages, and was sober and steady;
the girl kept her room and her two little children clean and
decent, and was always civil-spoken and pleasant. The
good lady who had the entree of the place talked to the
young man whenever she saw him, and he admitted at last
that, perhaps, the union might as well be made a legal one
-<q> Not that me and Sall 'ull get on any better, you know,
mum,--we couldn't; but since you've been on at her she
seems to have a bit o' fancy like for to have the marridge
lines, and if you'll tell us how, we'll get it done and over,
missis.</q></p>
<p>Delighted with the promise, the lady set to work and
prepared everything. She gave the bride a new gown to be
married in, and made frocks for the two little ones to come
and see their father married; she arranged with her husband
to perform the ceremony, and last, but most important, she
got the young man a day's holiday without loss of pay from
his employers.</p><p>
The eventful day arrived; the good soul beaming and
elated, waited, with a few friends invited to see the interesting ceremony, at the church. The clergyman stood with his
book at the altar, but no young couple. Twelve o'clock
struck, the clergyman went into the vestry, and put his coat
on; and bitterly disappointed at the failure of her little
scheme, the good lady sat on for an hour, thinking some delay
might have occurred, but after a while she gave it up as a
bad job, and departed also.</p><p>
That evening, in as towering a rage as a clergyman's wife
could decently be, she marched off to the Mint, and
tackled the delinquents at once. <soCalled>What did they mean
by it?</soCalled>
<p>The young man was very civil and very apologetic. <q> He
didn't mean to be rude, but the fact was, a mate hearin'
he'd got a day off offered him a job at carting as was worth
five bob; and you know, mum, I couldn't loose five bob
just for the sake o' gettin' married.</q></p>
<p>I am happy to say that the energetic lady set to work
again, got another holiday for the man a week after, and
this time <soCalled> personally conducted</soCalled> the wedding party to the
church, which they did not leave till the young woman was
the proud possessor of that by no means common property
in the locality, a marriage certificate.</p>
<p>But to return to the <soCalled> B</soCalled> meeting. The lady who wants
her little boy put away having been disposed of, a decent-looking woman takes her place. She is nursing a baby,
and by her side stands a small boy with staring eyes that
seem fixed upon nothing in particular-a strange, uncanny,
big-headed child, who attracts attention directly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jones, the mother, is called upon to say why this
lad's sister, aged ten, has been absent three weeks.</p>
<p><q>Well, I'm very sorry, gen'lemen, but I've had to keep
her at home. Ye see, gen'lemen, I haves ruematics, which
takes me all of a nonplush in the joints o' the knees and
the ankles of the feet, and then I can't move.</q></p>
<p><q>Yes, but that needn't keep the girl at home. You can
nurse the baby even if you have rheumatics.</q></p>
<p><q>Yes, sir, I know; but it's that boy as is the trouble.
Ye see, sir, he can't be lef' not a minnit without somebody as
can get after him quick. He's allers settin' hisself a-fire.
He gets the matches wherever we 'ides 'em, and he lights
anything he sees-the bed, the baby, hisself. Bless you,
gen'lemen, it's orful; he can't be off settin' somethin' alight
not five minnits together. He ain't right in 'is 'ed, sir.</q></p>
<p>The idiot incendiary paid not the slightest attention; his
wild, strange eyes were wandering about the room, probably
for a box of matches with which to set us alight, and make
one big blaze of the <soCalled>B</soCalled> meeting, chairman, officers,
himself, and all.</p>
<p><q>And that ain't all, sir: my 'usband's dead, sir; and all
we've got for a livin's a little shop, sir, where we sells
drippin', and matches, and candles, and odds and ends;
<figure><head>A Youthful Incendiary</></figure>and I can't run in and out when I'm so queer, and the
gal's all I've got to do things. I wish you would give her
half-time, sir.</q></p>
<p>The poor woman certainly had her work cut out, with the
rheumatics, the baby, the shop, and the idiot incendiary; and
the chairman, after a little consultation with the officer, find
ing the case was a deserving one, granted the half-time; and
the woman left evidently considerably relieved, dragging the
young gentleman with a tendency to commit hourly arson
after her.</p>
<p>The next to put in an appearance was a lady with a
wretched-looking face and a shabby, draggled, out-all-night
and drunk-in-the-morning appearance generally. Her profession was stated with official bluntness in the paper handed
to the chairman. It is generally translated <soCalled>street-walker</soCalled>
in family circles.</p>
<p>But, whatever she might be, she had children, and the law <pb id="p.27" n="27">
required them to come to school. Instead of making their
attendances, learning to read and write, the children were
street Arabs. The woman was meek and quiet enough. She
promised <q>She'd see to it,</q> and was reminded that she had <figure><head>She Promised "she'd see to it."</></figure>
made the same promise before. This time it was not
accepted, and the woman was informed that she would have
to appear before a magistrate.</p>
<p>Meekly and quietly she said, <q>Thank you, sir,</q> as if the
chairman had presented her with a medal or a pound of tea,
and went out.</p>
<p>The women poured in one after the other-there were
very few men, most of them, I suppose, being <soCalled>at work,</soCalled>
whatever that term might imply in their particular case - and they were of all sizes, sorts, and conditions. There
were respectable, decent, motherly-looking souls, drunken
outcasts, slatternly trollops, half-starved and sickly-looking
women, and fat, overwhelming women, who came not to be
crushed, but to crush.</p>
<p>One gaunt, fierce-looking lady, with the voice of a man
and the fist of a prize-fighter, gave the company a bit of her
mind. <q> Her 'gal' warn't a-coming to be worrited with a
lot o' stuff. She was delikit, her gal was, and the School
Board was murderin' of her.</q></p>
<p><q>What's the matter with her ? </q> asked the chairman.</p>
<p><q>Well, it's nervis system, and her teeth growin' out.</q></p>
<p><q>Where's the doctor's certificate that she's too ill to

<p>The School Board officer knows this lady's circumstances,
and he whispers something to the chairman. The girl's
<soCalled>nervis system</soCalled> and dental eccentricities have not prevented her affectionate mother from sending her out hawking every day while she stops at home and drinks.</p>
<p><q>Where's your husband ? </q> asked the officer. <q>I haven't
seen him lately. He'll have to be summoned, you know, as
you can't get a certificate.</q></p>
<p>The officer in question has good reason to ask affectionately after the husband. Last year the worthy gentleman
got a month for playfully tossing the officer down a flight of
stairs on to his head.</p>
<p><q>Where's my husband? Ah!</q> says she, purple with
passion, <q>you want to summon him, do you ? Well, then,
you jolly well carn't. Gord's got him.</q></p>
<p><q>Dead ? </q> asked the chairman.</p>
<p><q>Yes-didn't I say so ? </q></p>
<p><q>Then you will be summoned instead.</q></p>
<p>The lady didn't retire-she had to be diplomatically
crowded out, and the last sounds that reached the room as
she receded along the corridor, under gentle pressure, were
wishes that the chairman and all concerned might go where,
at least if her estimate of his whereabouts was correct, they
would not have the pleasure of meeting her late lamented
consort.</p>
<p>There are some rough customers to deal with in this
district-so rough that it is a wonder the Act works so
smoothly as it does. The fiercest and most reckless of the
lawless classes have to be bearded in their dens by the
devoted ill-paid officers, who ferret out the children and
insist upon their coming to school. Up to the topmost
garret and down to the lowest cellar, in dens and hovels
given over to thieves and wantons, I have accompanied a
School Board officer on his rounds, and I frankly confess
that I have passed a few bad quarters of an hour. <figure><head>"Ain't My Word Good Enough?"</></figure>
<p>There are dozens of these places where the blow follows
the word in a moment, where life is held of the least
account, and where assaults are so common that the victims
would as soon think of asking the police to notice their
broken windows as to take cognizance of their broken
heads.</p>
<p>There is a legend that one of these cellars in the Mint - it fetches 3s. a week rent, by the by-a man killed a
woman and left her; and that nobody took any notice
until the body got unpleasant, and then they threw it out
into the street.</p> <pb id="p.28" n="28">
<p>The <soCalled>'appy dossers</soCalled> are the wretched people who roam
about the street houseless, and creep in to sleep on the
stairs, in the passages and untenanted cellars of the lodging-houses with the doors open night and day. No policeman's
lantern is ever turned on them, and they crowd together in
their rags and make a jolly night of it. Sometimes in among
them creeps a starving woman, to die from want and
exposure; and she dies while the foul oath and the ribald
jests go on; and the <soCalled>dossers</soCalled> who are well enough to be
<soCalled>'appy </soCalled> make such a noise that a lodger, disturbed in his
legitimate rest for which he has paid, comes out and lays
about him vigorously at the <soCalled>varmints,</soCalled> and kicks them
down stairs, if he can. <figure><head>"'Appy Dosers."</></figure>
<p>Thus not only are many of the licensed lodging-houses
and homes of the poor breeding-houses in themselves for
crime, disease, and filth, but they are, for lack of supervision, receptacles for that which has already been bred
elsewhere, and which is deposited gratis, to swell the
collection.</p>
<p>A <soCalled>'appy dosser</soCalled> can make himself comfortable anywhere. I heard of one who used to crawl into the dust-bin,
and pull the lid down; but I know that to be an untruth,
from the simple fact that none of the dust bins on this class
of property have a lid. The contents are left, too, for
months to decompose, not only under the eyes of the
authorities, but under the noses of the inhabitants. The sanitary inspection of these houses is a farce, and in many
cases the vestrymen, who ought to put the law in motion,
are themselves the owners of the murder-traps.</p>
<p>How foul, how awful some of these places, where the
poor have found their last refuge, from Artisans' Dwelling
Acts and Metropolitan improvements, are, I dare not tell
you. I have been told that the readers of a shilling book
don't care to know, and the difficulties of dealing with this
subject are increased by my knowledge of the fact that in a
truthful account of <q>How the Poor Live </q> there can be but
little to attract those who read for pleasure only. Rags-
that is to say, the rags of our cold, sunless clime-are never
picturesque; squalor and misery can only be made tolerable
by the touch of the romancist-and here I dare rot
romance.</p>
<p>Bad, however, as things are, shocking as is the condition
in which thousands and thousands of our fellow-citizens live
from the cradle to the grave, it is not an unmixed evil if out
of its very repulsiveness grows a remedy for it.</p>
<p>It has got now into a condition in which it cannot be left.
For very shame England must do something, nay, for self-preservation, which is the most powerful of all human
motives. This mighty mob of famished, diseased, and filthy
helots is getting dangerous, physically, morally, politically
dangerous. The barriers that have kept it back are rotten
and giving way, and it may do the State a mischief if it be <pb id="p.29" n="29">
not looked to in time. Its fevers and its filth may spread
to the homes of the wealthy; its lawless armies may sally
forth and give us a taste of the lesson the mob has tried to
teach now and again in Paris, when long years of neglect
have done their work.</p>
<p>Happily there is a brighter side. Education-compulsory
education-has done much. The new generation is learning,
at least to be clean if notto be honest. The young mothers of
the slums-the girls who have been at the Board Schools-have far tidier homes already than their elders. The old
people born and bred in filth won't live out of it. If you
gave some of the slumites Buckingham Palace they would
make it a pigstye in a fortnight. These people are irreclaimable, but they will die out, and the new race can be
worked for with hope and with a certainty of success. Hard
as are some of the evils of the Education Act, they are
outbalanced by the good, and it is that Act above all others
which will eventually bring about the new order of things
so long desired.</p>
<p>So important a bearing on the home question has the
schooling of the children who are to be the rent-payers of
the next generation, that I propose to devote the next
chapter to some sketches of School Board life and
character; and I will take it in one of the worst districts
in London, where the parents are sunk in a state of misery
almost beyond belief.</p>
<p>I will show you the children at school who come daily
to their work from the foulest and dirtiest dens in London
-that awful network of hovels which lie about the Borough
and the Mint.</p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter" id="c.6" n="6"><head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<p><figure></>THE difficulty of getting
that element of picturesqueness into these
Chapters which is so essential to success with
a large class of English
readers, becomes more
and more apparent as
I and my travelling companion explore region
after region where the
poor are hidden away
to live as best they can.
There is a monotony in
the surroundings which
became painfully apparent to us, and were
our purpose less earnest
than it is we might well
pause dismayed at the
task we have undertaken.</p>
<p>The Mint and the
Borough present scenes awful enough in all conscience to
be worthy of earnest study; but scene after scene is the
same. Rags, dirt, filth, wretchedness, the same figures, the
same faces, the same old story of one room unfit for
habitation yet inhabited by eight or nine people, the same
complaint of, a ruinous rent absorbing three-fourths of the
toiler's weekly wage, the same shameful neglect by the
owner of the property of all sanitary precautions, rotten
floors, oozing walls, broken windows, crazy staircases, tileless roofs, and in and around the dwelling-place of hundreds
of honest citizens the nameless abominations which could
only be set forth were we contributing to the Lancet
instead of the Pictorial World;-these are the things
which confront us, whether we turn to the right or to
the left, whether we linger in the Mint or seek fresh fields
in the slums that lie round <placeName key=x>Holborn</placeName>!
, or wind our adventurous footsteps towards the network of dens that lie
within a stone's-throw of our great National Theatre,
<placeName key=x>Drury Lane</placeName>!.</p>
<p>The story of one slum is the story of another, and all
are unrelieved by the smallest patch of that colour which
lends a charm to pictures of our poorest peasantry. God
made the country, they say, and man the town; and
wretched as is the lot of the agricultural labourer, the
handiwork of Heaven still remains to give some relief to
the surroundings of his miserable life. Field and tree and
flower, the green of the meadow and the hedge, the gold
and white of buttercup and daisy, the bright hues of the
wild cottage garden,-it is in the midst of these the pigstyes
of the rustic poor are pitched, and there is scope for the
artist's brush. But in the slums he can use but one colour;
all is a monotone-a sombre grey deepening into the blackness of night. Even the blue that in the far-off skies seems
to defy the man-made town to be utterly colourless, is
obscured by the smoke belched forth from a hundred
chimneys; and when the sun, which shines with systematic
impartiality on the righteous and unrighteous alike, is
foiled in its efforts to get at these outcasts by the cunning
builders, who have put house so close to house that even a
sunbeam which had trained down to the proportions of
Mdlle. Sarah Bernhardt, and then been flattened by a steamroller, could not force its way between the overhanging
parapets with any chance of getting to the ground. So what
sunshine there is stops on the roofs among the chimney-pots,
and is the sole property of the cats of the neighbourhood,
who may be seen dozing about in dozens or indulging in
a pastime which they have certainly not learnt of their
masters and mistresses, namely, washing their faces.</p>
<p>The cat-life of the slums is peculiar. Dogs are rare, but
the cats are as common as blackberries in September. Not
over clean and not over fat, the cats of the slums yet seem
perfectly contented, and rarely leave the district in which
they have been reared. They ascend to the roof early in
the day, and stay there long after darkness has set in, and in
the choice of a local habitation they show their feline sense.
The rooms of their respective owners offer neither air nor sunshine, and when <soCalled> the family</soCalled> are all at home, it is possibly
the inability of finding even a vacant corner to curl up in that
drives Thomas to that part of a house which the people of
the East consider the best, but which the people of our East
have never sought to utilise.</p> <pb id="p.30" n="30">
<p>The cats of the slums are certainly domesticated: they
marry and have families, and the kittens are the only really
pretty things we have seen since we started on our
explorations.</p>
<p>The young of most animals are interesting and picturesque;
but a kitten is perhaps the prettiest of all; and a painful
contrast is there between the sallow dirty face, the sunken
eyes and wizard features of a baby we see sitting on a doorstep nursing one, and the dainty face, blue eyes, and plump
pretty figure of the kitten. The mother of the latter has set
an example in the matter of philoprogenitiveness and
domestic forethought which the mother of the former would
do well to imitate.</p>
<p>There are not wanting those who believe that for the
present generation of poor little can be done. I mean, of
course, the poor who are sunk in the misery and degradation
of slum life. Dirtiness is ingrained in them, and if they had
decent habitations provided for them to-morrow, they would
no more live in them than a gipsy could settle down under
any but a canvas roof.</p>
<p>Thrift they do not understand, and are too old to be
taught; and ordinary decency is a thing of which they have
about as much conception as they would have of the
aestheticism of Mr. Oscar Wilde or the philosophy of
Mr. Herbert Spencer.</p>
<p>I am not of the school which says that the regeneration
of the masses is hopeless, but I freely confess that the great
chance of bringing about a new and better order of things
lies among the children who are to be the mothers and
fathers of the future. In the old Biblical times water and
fire were the elements which solved the knotty problem of<figure><head>One Remove from an Idiot</></figure>
regenerating a seething mass of humanity sunk in the lowest
abysses of vice and degradation. The deluge that shall do
the work now must come of the opening of the floodgates
of knowledge. Already, in tiny rivulets as yet, the waters
are trickling even into the darkest corners of our great
cities. The flood can never rise high enough to cleanse
those who have grown up ignorant,-at best it can but wet
their feet; but the children cannot escape it,-the waters
will gather force and volume and grow into a broad glorious
river, through which the boys and girls of to-day will wade
breast high until they gain the banks of the Promised Land.
It is this river of knowledge which the modern wanderers <figure><head>Pretty Intelligent</></figure>
in the wilderness must ford to reach the Canaan which the
philanthropist sees waiting for them in his dreams.</p>
<p>The first working of the Education Act was fraught with
countless difficulties. It was no light task to catch the
children of a shifting race, to schedule street Arabs and the
offspring of beggars and thieves and prostitutes. But in the
course of a few years almost every difficulty has been
conquered, and now there is hardly a child above a certain
age-no matter how wretched its condition may be-that is
not brought within the beneficial influence of education.</p>
<p>True that many of them come shoeless, ragged, and
starving, to learn the three R's, to burthen their scanty
brains with sums and tasks while their stomachs are empty
and their bodies weakened by disease and neglect; but they
have at least their chance. Let us take a school where,
perhaps, the poorest children come-a school recruited
from such homes as we have familiarised you with in previous chapters-and see the little scholars at their dainty
tasks. Here is a child who is but one remove from an idiot.
The teacher has a hard task, for the Government inspector
expects all the scholars to make the same progress. This
poor waif-the offspring of a gentleman whose present
address is Holloway Gaol, and a lady who has been charged
seventy-three times with being drunk and incapable-must
pass a certain standard before she can leave school; in her
case, if she lives, she will pass out by age, for statistics show
that no system can make this class of intellect retain a
lesson. It is sowing seed upon a rock, and there will be ho
harvest; but the child has just sufficient intelligence to escape <pb id="p.31" n="31">
the asylum, and between the asylum and the school there is
no half-way house.</p>
<p>Some benefit, at least, she derives from the discipline, the
care, and the motherly sympathy of a kind head-mistress,
who takes a strong personal interest in her little charges.
For so many hours a day at least the child escapes the
ghastly surroundings of the den wnich is her <soCalled>home.</soCalled></p>
<p>Side by side with her sits a pretty, intelligent little girl of
nine. This child's eyes are bright with intelligence, the
features are pleasing and regular. As she is called forward,
she rises and smilingly comes towards us. <figure><head> A Loose Leaf from a Sketch-Book</></figure>There is none
of that stolid indifference, that mechanical obedience to a command which distinguishes too many of the little ones
who are here in obedience to the laws. This girl learns
quickly, and has had all the better qualities brought out. She
is neat, and takes a pride in her personal appearance. She
has learnt to be ashamed of dirt, and she is ambitious to be
high up in her class. Ambition is the one quality which
will help above all others to lift the poor out of degradation.
The older race have it not; hence they are content with
their present positions, only seeking to gratify their daily
appetites, and caring not a fig for the morrow. This child
will do well, whatever she undertakes; and it is such as she
who will survive in the battle of life, and become the mothers
of a better and more useful class.</p>
<p>Yet hers is a sad enough story. Her father was a
boatman, and in a drunken rage struck his wife down with
a boat hook.</p>
<p>Hers was the common offence of asking for money. The
blow injured the woman's brain, and from that day to this
she has been in a lunatic asylum. The father disappeared
after the crime, and the child's grandmother took the orphan
with living parents in, and out of her scanty earnings kept
her. One day this year the old lady passed some men
carrying a body found in the river to the dead-house.
Curiosity induced her to go in with the crowd, and the face
of the dead man was that of her son.</p>
<p>A back street tragedy-common enough, with a varied
plot and incidents in these parts, but, as it stands, the lifestory of this child.</p>
<p><q>And your granny keeps you now? </q> says the teacher, as
she concludes the little history and turns to the girl.
<q>Yes, teacher; and when I grow up I'm going to keep
granny.</q></p>
<p>So may it be!</p>
<p>Here is a group of girls sketched hastily from the hundred
in the room. Some of them come from decent homes, and
some from cellars; many of their histories are romances,
but they are romances which mostly tend one way-to show
the misery, the guilt, and the poverty in which they have
been reared; and to recount them would be but to dwell upon
a note which perhaps I have touched too often already.</p> <pb id="p.32" n="32">
<p>There are brighter stories, too, to be told of their parents,
but none so bright as they will be able to tell of themselves
when, after years of discipline and culture, they go forth to
lead lives which with their fathers and mothers were
impossible.</p>
<p>Close to the school where the elder girls are educated,
and in the same building, is the department for infants. Here
the children under seven are prepared to pass into the upper
department.</p>
<p>Directly we enter we are struck with the appearance of
these children. Bad faces there are among them-bruises
and scars, and bandages and rags-but the bulk of these
younger children have a generally better appearance than
their little neighbours.</p>
<p>There is a theory in the school, and it is borne out to a
certain extent by fact, that some of the youngest and bestlooking are the children of girls who just got the benefit of
the Education Act before they were too old, and who in their
young married life have reaped the benefit of those principles
of cleanliness and thrift which the Board School inculcates
The young mothers are already a race far ahead of the older
ones in this district, and the children naturally benefit by it.
It must be borne in mind that the girls of this class marry or
take a mate at a very early age. Many of them have three
or four children by the time they are twenty, so that at the
time the Education Act came into force, some twelve years
ago, they would have been brought under its influence.
These young women, too, live in a better way; their room
is tidier and cleaner, there is a little coquetry in them, and
they have a sense of shame which renders them excellent
service. They are anxious about their children's education,
they recognise the advantage the discipline and instruction
have been to them, and the general tone of their lives is
every way a distinct advance on the old order of things.</p>
<p>I quote these facts because they so fully bear out the
theory that Education must be the prime instrument in
changing the condition of the poor for the better, whatever
results it may have later on upon the condition of the labour
market and the political and social questions of the future.
The many theories which are put forward about the result
of educating the masses, it is not my province here to
discuss; nor need I consider those doctrines which are
closely akin to socialism, and which are the favourite arguments of a school of advanced thinkers when discussing the
future condition of the masses.</p>
<p>I have only to confine myself to the facts before me, and
I think this great improvement in the children of the young
mothers a most important one.
<p>The best examples are in a room which is a kind of creche.
Here the babies can be left by the mothers who have to go
out to work, and the tiny mites are looked after with
motherly care by a kind-hearted creature whose lot I do
not envy. Fancy forty infants, some of them little over two
years old, to take care of for eight hours a day. Mothers
will appreciate the situation better than I can describe it.
<p>Look at the illustration on the next page, and you will see
the babies at dinner. They have brought their bread and
butter with them, and they sit at the little low table enjoying
it thoroughly. In the winter, when work is scarce, alas!
baby's bread and butter is not always so thick as it is to-day.
Sometimes baby has only a dry crust. But there is a lot of
the best sort of Christian character knocking about in the
Great City, and an excellent society, which provides dinners
for poor Board School children, has done much to alleviate
this painful state of things. A starving body, a famished
child: there is no fear of imposture here; and if any one
who reads these Chapters wishes to support a truly admirable
movement, where there is no fear of abuse, he or she may
imitate Captain Cuttle, and, having found a good thing, make
a note of it.</p>
<p>In addition to the dining and play-table there is a long bed
in the room. There the tired babies sleep eight or ten in a
row sometimes, and forget their baby troubles. The creche
is a boon and a blessing to the poor woman who going out
to work has a choice of keeping an elder girl at home to nurse
the baby and be summoned for it, or locking the said baby
up alone in a room all day with the risk to its life and its
limbs inevitable to such a course, not to mention the danger
of fire and matches and fits.</p>
<p>It is therefore with grief I hear that there are to be no
more built in Board Schools, and that the cost of maintaining
those existing must in future be defrayed by voluntary contributions. The Government objects to the creche department
on economical grounds.</p>
<p>The lady who manages the infants old enough to learn
has no easy task, but the order is perfect, and the children
drill like little soldiers. Here, too, the stories of many of
them reveal a depth of misery not often sounded except in
the police-courts.</p>
<p>Here is a bright, pretty, golden-haired girl of five who
rather upsets my pet theory. <figure><head>Five.</></figure> She ought to be ugly and dull,
if there is anything in breed. Her mamma is seldom out of
prison for more than a week. Mamma not having learned
Latin does not know the difference between meum and tuum,
and is an incorrigible shoplifter and thief. When she is
enjoying her liberty, too, she has a habit of tumbling about
which is not conducive to health. She has fallen out of a
window and damaged the pavement below, and once with a
baby in her arms she fell down, the stairs of this very school.</p>
<p>When they picked her up the baby's collar bone was broken,
<pb id="p.33" n="33"> <p><figure><head>The Crche.-Dinner Time.</head></figure>
<pb id="p.34" n="34">
but she was sound enough to exclaim, <q> If it hadn't ha' been
for that blessed baby I'd a broken my neck, I would.</q> </p>
<p>It isn't every mother who is philosopher enough to
recognise the use of a baby in breaking her fall down
stairs.</p>
<p>The father of this little girl, whose counterfeit presentment
is here given, is a respectable man; but he has to go a long
way away for work, and when papa is in the country and
mamma is in goal, some good Sisters of Charity have taken
the child and found it a home.</p>
<p>We have made our notes and taken our sketches, and the
children file out of school to dinner and to play.</p>
<p>One sturdy little chap takes his sister's hand and leads her
out like a little father. <figure><head>A Pretty Pair</></figure>He has over half a mile to take her
home. We are told it is a beautiful sight to see him piloting
her across the great thoroughfares when the traffic sweeps
wildly up and down, and never leaving go the little hand
that is placed so trustingly in his till home is reached and the
dangers of the streets are over. They are a pretty pair as
they toddle out hand in hand, and they form a pleasant
picture in this brief sketch of the little scholars who come
daily from the garrets and cellars of the slums to get that
<soCalled>little learning </soCalled> which in their cases is surely the reverse
of a <soCalled>dangerous thing.</soCalled></p> </div1>
<div1 type="chapter" id="c.7" n="7">
<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<p>IF I were asked to say off-hand what was the greatest
curse of the poor and what was the greatest blessing, I
think my answer to the first query would be the public-house, and to the second the hospital. Of course, I might
be wrong. There are some people who will contend that in
these islands the greatest blessing of the natives of all
degrees is that they are Great Britons. Our patriotic songs
bid us all rejoice greatly at the fact, and patriotism is not a
class privilege. The starved outcast, crouching for shelter
on a wild March night in one of the stone recesses of <figure><head>Starved Outcast</></figure>
London Bridge, has a right to exclaim with the same pride
as the Marquis of Westminster-</p>
<p><q>Far as the breeze can bear the billows' foam,
Survey our empire and behold our home.</q></p>
<p>His soul, for all we know, may rejoice greatly that Britannia
rules the waves, and in spite of the fact that a policeman
spying him out as <soCalled>without the visible means of subsistence</soCalled>
may seize him and consign him to durance vile, he-the
outcast, not the policeman--may ponder with much
national vanity on the fact that Britons never shall be slaves.</p>
<p>Out upon the parochial-minded disciples of the Birmingham school, who pretend that a nation can be very great
abroad and yet very small at home! <q>Survey our Empire </q>
is a noble line, and there is another about the Queen's
morning drum which has a magnificent ring about it, and
crops up in patriotic leading articles about twice a week all
the year round. It is, however, just possible that the vast
extent of British rule does not come home so pleasurably to
my friend on the bridge as it does to the well-fed, prosperous
citizen of Jingo proclivities who believes that Heaven's first
command to an Englishman was, <q>Thou shalt remove thy
neighbour's landmark.</q> The poor wretch may <soCalled>survey</soCalled>
his <soCalled>empire</soCalled> with a feeling of anything but contentment,
and he may be tempted to wish that we had a little less
empire to look after abroad in order that a little attention
might be bestowed upon the place where charity begins.</p>
<p>Even at the risk of being pronounced unpatriotic, I shall,
therefore, maintain my contention that the greatest blessing
of the poor is the hospital-that noble institution of which
Englishmen of all classes and all creeds may reasonably be
proud.</p>
<p>Sickness, disease, and accident enter very largely into
the annals of the poor. Overcrowding, and unsanitary
dwellings-all the ghastly surroundings of poor life in a
<pb id="p.35" n="35">
great city, which I have attempted feebly to describe in
these papers-render the masses peculiarly susceptible to
illness in every shape and form. Epidemics of some sort
or other are rarely absent from the poorer districts, and
many painful diseases and deformities are transmitted
regularly from parent to child. To be sound of limb and
well in health in these dens is bad enough, but the existence
of an invalid under such circumstances is pitiable to a
degree. The hospitals are the heavens-upon-earth of the
poor. I have heard little children-their poor pinched
faces wrinkled with pain-murmur that they didn't mind it,
because if they had been well they would never have come
to <soCalled> the beautiful place.</soCalled> Beautiful, indeed, by contrast with
their wretched homes are the clean wards, the comfortable beds, and the kind faces of the nurses. Step across
from the home of a sick child in the slums of the Borough
to the Evelina Hospital, and it is like passing from the
infernal regions to Paradise. To this noble charity little
sufferers are often brought dirty, neglected, starving; and
even the nurses, used as they are to such sights, will tell
you their hearts ache at the depth of baby wretchedness
revealed in some of the cases brought to them.</p>
<p>Passing from cot to cot, and hearing the histories of the
little ones lying there so clean, and, in spite of their
suffering, so happy, one is inclined to think that the charity
is a mistake-that to nurse these children back to health
only to send them again to their wretched homes is a
species of refined cruelty. It were better in dozens of
cases that the children were left to die now, while they are
young and innocent, than that death should be wrestled
with and its prize torn from it only to be cast back into a
state of existence which is worse than death.</p>
<p>The children have some dim inkling of this themselves.
Many of them cry when they are well, and cling to the
kind nurses, asking piteously not to be sent back to the
squalor and dirt, and often, alas ! cruelty, from which they
have been snatched for a brief spell. Here is a child at
home and the same child in the hospital. Contrast the
surroundings. Look on this picture and on that, and then
say if there is not at least some ground for such a train
of thought as the Hospital for Sick Children suggested
to me!</p>
<p>The elder people doubtless appreciate the blessings of the
hospital as much as the children. The poor generally
speak in the highest terms of such institutions. They could
not, as a rule, lie ill at home; care and attention would be
impossible; and for a sick person the atmosphere would
mean certain death. Doctors they cannot afford to pay.
The class of practitioners who lay themselves out for
business in these neighbourhoods are not, as a rule, much
more than nostrum and patent-medicine vendors, and their
charges are generally extortionate. If you could bring
yourself to imagine truthfully the condition of the sick poor
without the hospitals to go to, you would see a picture of
human misery so appalling that you would cover your eyes
and turn away from it with a shudder.</p>
<p>Yet there are such pictures to be seen. There are cases
which, from varying circumstances, do not go to the hospital.
There are men and women who lie and die day by day in
these wretched single rooms, sharing all the family trouble,
enduring the hunger and the cold, and waiting without hope,
without a single ray of comfort, until God curtains their
staring eyes with the merciful film of death.</p>
<p>It was such a case we came upon once in our wanderings,
and which, without unduly harrowing the reader up, I will
endeavour to describe.</p>
<p>The room was no better and no worse than hundreds of
its class. It was dirty and dilapidated, with the usual bulging blackened ceiling, and the usual crumbling greasy walls.
Its furniture was a dilapidated four-post bedstead, a chair,
and a deal table. On the bed lay a woman, young and with
features that before hourly anguish contorted them had
been comely. The woman was dying slowly of heart disease. Death was <soCalled>writ large</soCalled> upon her face. At her
breast she held her child, a poor little mite of a baby that
was drawing the last drain of life from its mother's breast.
The day was a bitterly cold one; through the broken casement the wind came ever and anon in icy gusts, blowing
the hanging end of the ragged coverlet upon the bed to and
fro like a flag in a breeze. The wind roared in the chimney
too, eddying down into the fireless grate with a low howling
noise like the moan of a Banshee round a haunted house.
To protect the poor woman from the cold her husband had
flung on it his tattered great coat-a garment that the most
ancient four-wheel night cabman would have spurned as a
knee protector. <q>He was a plumber,</q> she whispered to us
in a weak, hollow voice; <q>he had been out of work for a
week, and he had gone out to try and look for a job.</q> One
shivered to think of him wearily trudging the streets this
bitter day, half clad and wholly starved; what must have
been his torture as he failed at place after place, and the
day wore on and brought the night when he would have to
return to the poor dying wife with the old sad story?</p>
<p>As one realised the full meaning of this little domestic
tragedy, and knew that it was only one of many daily
enacted in the richest city in the world-the scene of it laid
not a mile from the full tide of all the pomps and vanities
of fashion, of all the notorious luxury and extravagances
which is the outward show of our magnificence and wealth,
it was hard to repress a feeling of something akin to shame
and anger-shame for the callous indifference which bids
one half the world ignore the sufferings of the other-anger
that with all the gold annually borne along on the broad
stream of charity so little of it ever reaches the really
deserving and necessitous poor.</p>
<p>The house this poor woman lay dying in was one of a
block which would have been a prize to a sanitary inspector
anxious to make a sensational report. For the room in
question the plumber out of work had to pay four and sixpence, and the broken pane of glass the landlord had refused to replace. The man was told <q>he must do it himself,
or if he didn't like it as it was he could go.</q></p>
<p>Such stories as this are painful, but they should be told.
It is good for the rich that now and again they should be
brought face to face with misery, or they might doubt its
existence. These people-our fellow-citizens-cannot be
neglected with impunity. These fever and pestilence-breeding dens that are still allowed to exist, these death- <pb id="p.36" n="36"> <figure><head>A Domestic Tragedy</></figure>
traps out of which vestrymen and capitalists make large
annual incomes, are a danger to the whole community.</p>
<p>While I am on this subject, I may as well quote an
instance which bears directly upon the interest-the selfish
interest-which the better classes have in lending their
voices to swell the chorus of complaints which is going
up about the present state of things.</p>
<p>Here is an <soCalled>interior</soCalled> to which I would call the special
attention of ladies who employ nurse-girls for their children.</p>
<p>This room when we entered it was in a condition beyond
description. The lady was washing the baby, and she made
that an excuse for the dirt of everything else. Two ragged
boys were sitting on the filthy floor, a dirty little girl was in
-a corner pulling a dirty kitten's tail, and the smoke from
the untidiest grate I ever saw in my life was making the
half-washed baby sneeze its little head nearly off. The
family, all told, that slept in this room was seven. There
was a bed and there was a sofa-so I concluded the floor
must have been the resting-place of some of them. <q>The
eldest girl</q>-materfamilias informed us in answer to our
questions-<q>was gone out. She slept on the sofa.</q> We
knew somebody had slept there, because some rags were on
it which had evidently done duty as bed-clothes.</p>
<p>Outside this room, which opened on to a back yard, was
a dust-bin. We didn't want eyesight to know that-it
appealed with sufficient power to another sense. Inside was
an odour which made the dust-bin rather a relief.</p>
<p>I have described this place a little graphically for the sake
of that eldest girl. It is not from any gallantry to the fair
sex that I have done this, but because the young woman in
question was, I ascertained, a domestic servant. She was a
nursemaid just home from a place at Norwood, and in a week
she was going to a place at Clapham. I remembered, as I
gazed on the scene, a certain vigorous letter from Mr. Charles
Reade which appeared in the Daily Telegraph some years
ago about servants <soCalled>pigging with their relations at home,</soCalled>
and wanting the best bed-room and a feather-bed with
damask furniture when in service. I never so thoroughly
realised what <soCalled>pigging with their relations</soCalled> meant
before.</p>
<p>Now if you will take the trouble to think out the possible
result of girls going from such pigstyes as these straight into
well-to-do families, where they will nurse the children and be
constantly in the closest contact with the younger members
of the family, I think you will see that the dangers of unhealthy homes for the poor may be equally dangerous to a
better class. I should like to know how many families now
mourning the loss of a little child from fever, or the death of
some dear one from small-pox, would have been spared their
sorrow had the existence of such places as I have described
been rendered impossible by the action of the law!</p>
<p>I do not imagine for one moment that I have seen, or that
I am likely to see, the worst phases of the evil which has
become one of the burning questions of the hour. But what
I have written about I have in every case seen with my own
eyes, and in no case have I exaggerated; and yet more than
one of my kindly correspondents doubt my story of the
dead body being kept and eventually put out into the
street.</p>
<p>With regard to this, let the reader in doubt ask any sanitary
inspector or officer of health to whom he can get an introduction if it is not an appalling fact that the poor have
grown so used to discomfort and horrors that they do not
look upon a corpse in the room they live, and eat, and sleep
in as anything very objectionable!</p>
<p>It often happens there is no money to pay for the funeral,
and so, with that inertness and helplessness bred of long
years of neglect, nothing at all is done, no steps are
taken, and the body stops exactly where it was when the
breath left it.</p>
<p>The following incident I take haphazard from the reports
of Dr. Liddle, whose recent statement has even attracted
Parliamentary attention and led to a question in the
House:-</p>
<p>PROLONGED RETENTION OF A DEAD BODY IN A ROOM OCCUPIED
BY A FAMILY.
Mr. Wrack reports that, on visiting No. 17, Hope Street, Spitalfields, he found in the room of the second floor the dead body of a
child who had died fifteen days before the time of his visit. The room,
which contained 1,176 cubic feet of space, was occupied by the parents
of the dead child and a daughter aged thirteen years. The body was
in a decomposed state. The reason assigned for not burying the child
at an earlier period was that the father had no means to do so, and
that his friends had failed to render him the assistance which they had
promised. Mr. Wrack having pointed out the danger of keeping a
dead body so long in the only room occupied by the family, application
was made to the relieving officer, and the body was buried on the
following day.</p>
<p>Fifteen days! Fancy that I with the knowledge you have
by this time of the size and condition of the room in which
the corpse remains mixed up with the living inmates day
and night. Here are two more cases. Note the fact that
in the first the child has died of scarlet fever, and that
tailoring work is going on around it-work which when
finished will be carried, in all human probability, with the
germs of disease in it to the homes of well-to-do and
prosperous people-a class which too frequently objects
to be worried with revelations of the miseries of the
masses.</p>
<p>PROLONGED RETENTION OF A DEAD BODY IN A ROOM OCCUPIED
BY A FAMILY.
Mr. Wrack reports that, upon visiting No. 28, Church Street, Spitalfieds, on the 5th December last, he found in the second floor front
room the dead body of a child which had died of scarlet fever on the
1st of the month. The body was not coffined, and it lay exposed on
a table in one corner of the room. The room was occupied as a living
and sleeping room by five persons, viz., the father and mother, their
child, a girl about three years old, and by two adults, viz., the grandfather and grandmother of the child, who were engaged at tailors'
work. The child was playing on the floor. The room was ab ut
fourteen feet square and eight feet high, thus affording only 260 cubic
feet of space to each person. The smell on entering the room was
most sickening. Upon remonstrating with the people for keeping the
body so long unburied, and especially for not having it coffined, they
replied that they were waiting to raise the means for burying it; and,
being Irish, said that it was not their custom to coffin their dead until
the day of the funeral. The body was not buried until the 9th of
December, and then it had to be buried by the parish authorities.
Mr. Wrack also visited No. 24, Princes Street, Spitalfields, on the
5th January, and found in the second floor front room the dead body of
an aged woman, who died on Christmas Day. The room was occupied
by the daughter of the deceased, a person about 40 years of age, who
lived and slept in the same room. Upon asking the reason of her
keeping the body so long unburied, she stated that she had been waiting
for suitable things to be made for the funeral; and upon asking when
the funeral would take place, she stated that the body would not be <pb id="p.37" n="37">
buried until the 8th January, a period of fifteen days from the death.
The Board had no power to compel the removal of the corpse, as
there is no mortuary belonging to the Board in the district.</p>
<p>I want to drive this nail home, though it is the practice
itself I should prefer to knock on the head. Here are
three more cases. Let me quote them, and have done with
the subject.</p>
<p>PROLONGED RETENTION OF DEAD BODIES.
There have been three cases of prolonged retention of the dead in
rooms occupied as living and sleeping rooms. One of these cases was
that of a child who died at No. 26, King Street, Spitalfields, and whose
body was retained for nine days, the parents stating that they were
unable to raise sufficient money to bury it. During the time the body
was kept it became so offensive that it was necessary to remove it to a
shed at the rear of the house. Eventually the father applied to the
relieving officer, and obtained an order for the burial of the body.
Another case was that of a young man who died of consumption at
120, Royal Mint Street. The body of this young man was kept for
eight days in the room in which his father and mother lived and
slept.
The third case was that of a child three weeks old, who died at No.
5, Devonshire Place, Whitechapel. The body of this child was kept
in the room occupied by its parents for a period of twelve days, and at
the time of the visit of the inspector the smell from it was most
offensive.
Although in each of these cases everything was done by the officer
of this Board and by the relieving officer to induce the respective
parties to bury their dead before a nuisance was occasioned, yet to a
certain extent their efforts were unavailing.
As such cases are of frequent occurrence, it is certainly full time
that power was given to magistrates to order the burial without delay
of every corpse which is certified to be a nuisance or dangerous to the
public health.</p>
<p>It is necessary a great many things were done. It is
necessary, above all, that the direct attention of the State
should be given to the whole question, but the Home
Secretary says there is <q>no time</q> to attend to such matters.
The question which led to this answer and the Home
Secretary's statement in full were as follows:-</p>
<div2 type="article">
<p>SANITARY CONDITION OF WHITECHAPEL.</p>
<p>Mr. Bryoe asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department
whether his attention had been called to the two last reports presented
to the <rs type=org>Whitechapel District Board of Works</rs> by the Medical Officer of
Health on the sanitary condition of the Whitechapel district, in which
he condemned, as unsanitary and ill-arranged, several new buildings
recently erected in that district, and expressed the opinion that amendments in the existing Building Acts were urgently required; and
whether, if sufficient powers to prevent the erection or order the closing
of unsanitary dwellings were not now possessed by local authorities,
he would undertake to bring in a Bill to amend the Building Acts in
this important particular, by investing the proper local authorities with
such powers.</p>
<p>Sir W. Harcourt said he would be glad to introduce Bills upon this
and many other subjects, but there was no time for them.-Evening
Standard, <date value="1883-06-18">June 18, 1883.</date></p></div2>
<div1>
<p><q>No time !</q></p>
<p>It is well, with that answer ringing in our ears, to turn to
the Parliamentary proceedings and discover what the important questions are which are engrossing the entire attention
of the Legislature, and leaving <q>no time</q> for such a matter
as the constant menace to public health which exists in the
present system of <soCalled>Housing the Poor.</soCalled> I will not enumerate them, or I might be tempted into a political disquisition, which would be out of place; but the reader can,
with considerable profit to himself, find them and make a
note of them.</p>
<p>The list of important measures which have consumed the
session and left <q>no time </q> for this question will be instructive and amusing-amusing because the discussions which
have taken up the time of the House contain in themselves
all the elements of screaming farce.</p>
<p>And talking of screaming farce I am reminded by my
collaborator that <rs type=person>Mr. J. L. Toole</rs> is in his sketch-book, and
I have never given an opportunity for him to be introduced
yet.<figure n="2000.p5.0034"><head>A Familiar Face</></figure></p>
<p>Room by all means, and at once for <rs type=person>Mr. J. L. Toole</rs> -not the Toole of Toole's Theatre-the popular comedian
who has made tomfoolery a fine art and burlesque a science,
but his living, breathing image as he appeared to us, <q>Mug,</q>
voice, and gesture, at the door of a house at which we lately
knocked in search of information as to the profits of hatbox making.</p>
<p><rs type=person>Our J. L. Toole</rs> didn't tell us-he was very funny-he
cracked wheezes that even <rs type=person>John Laurence </rs> himself might
give off without blushing.</p>
<p>He suggested that while we were about it perhaps <q>he
might as well tell us who he worked for as how much he
got, and then we could go round and offer to make hatboxes a halfpenny a dozen under.</q> We didn't get much
out of our J. L. Toole except his portrait, and that was
taken entirely without his permission, and is herewith
presented gratis to our readers.</p></div1> <pb id="p.38" n="38">
<div1 type="chapter" id="c.8" n="8">
<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<p>ONE of the greatest evils of the overcrowded districts of
London is the water supply. I might almost on this head
imitate the gentleman who wrote a chapter on Snakes in
Iceland, which I quote in its entirety-<q> There are no
snakes in Iceland.</q> To say, however, that in these districts there is no water supply would be incorrect, but it is
utterly inadequate to the necessities of the people. In
many houses more water comes through the roof than
through a pipe, and a tub or butt in the back yard about
half full of a black, foul-smelling liquid, supplies some
dozens of families with the water they drink and the water
they wash in as well.<figure n="2000.p5.0035"><head>The Water Butt</></figure> It is, perhaps, owing to the limited
nature of the luxury that the use of water both internally
and externally is rather out of favour with the inhabitants.
As to water for sanitary purposes, there is absolutely no
provision for it in hundreds of the most densely-inhabited
houses. In the matter of water and air, the most degraded
savage British philanthropy has yet adopted as a pet is a
thousand times better off than the London labourer and
his family, dwelling in the areas whose horrors medical
officers are at last divulging to the public.</p>
<p>The difficulties of attaining that cleanliness which we
are told is next to godliness may be imagined from the
contemplation of this butt, sketched in the back yard of a
house containing over ninety people. The little boy in his
shirt-sleeves has come to fill his tin bowl, and we are indebted to him for the information that he wants it for his
mother to drink. The mother is ill-has been for weeks
-her lips are burning with fever, her throat is dry and
parched, and this common reservoir, open to all the dust
and dirt with which the air is thick, open to the draining
in rainy weather of the filthy roof of the tumble-down
structure beside it, this is the spring at which she is to
slake her thirst. Is it any wonder that disease is rampant,
or that the Temperance folk have such trouble to persuade the masses that cold water is a good and healthy
drink ?</p>
<p>Remember, this is absolutely the supply for the day; it
is, perhaps, turned on for about dive minutes, and from
this butt the entire inhabitants of the house must get all
the water they want. In dozens of instances there is no
supply at all-accident or design has interfered with it,
and the housewife who wants to wash her child's face or
her own, or do a bit of scrubbing, has to beg of a neighbour or make a predatory excursion into a back yard more
blessed than her own.</p>
<p>Some of the facts about the water supply are not easy to
deal with in articles for general reading, nor do they lend
themselves to the art of the illustrator. The hewer of wood
has found plenty of scope in this series, but the difficulties
of the <soCalled>drawer of water </soCalled> are great. It was while I and my
esteemed collaborator were debating how we couldpossibly
reproduce much that we had seen in connection with this
crying evil that a gentleman came along and gave us the
chance of at least one sketch <soCalled>on the spot.</soCalled> You observe him busy at the side of a tub-a tub from which his
neighbours will fill their drinking and their culinary vessels
anon. Do not imagine that he is engaged in his morning
ablution. He is washing his potatoes-that is all-and in
the evening he will take them out baked, and sell them in
the public highway. For the sake of the public I am glad
they will be baked, but though the water will in some
instances be boiled, I don't think that tea is improved by
the dirt off potato-skins-at least I have never heard so.</p>
<p>Perhaps at the house where this tub was sketched the
inhabitants were not so much injured as they might have
been by the deficient water supply in the yard. If they
didn't get water in one way, they generally had it in
another. The law of compensation is always at work,
and the rapacity of a landlord who left his tenants so badly
off in one particular way may have been a godsend in
another.</p>
<p>The water in rainy weather simply poured through the
roof of this house, saturating the sleepers in their beds and
washing their faces in a rough-and-ready manner, but unfortunately it didn't rain towels at the same time, so that
the bath had its inconveniences.</p>
<p>The cause of these periodical shower-baths was pointed
out to us by a tenant who paid four and sixpence a week
for his <soCalled>watery nest</soCalled> in the attic, and who, in language
which did not tend to show that his enforced cleanliness
had brought godliness in its train, explained that the landlord had taken the lead from the roof and sold it, and <pb id="p.39" n="39"><p><figure n="2000.p5.0036"><head>The "Watery Nest."</></figure> <pb n="40" id="p.40"><p>
replaced it with asphalte, which had cracked with the result
above described.</p>
<p>Unacquainted with the stern necessities of the situation,
you will contemplate the picture and say that these people
are idiots to pay rent for such accommodation. What are
they to do?-Move. Whither ? They know well how they
will have to tramp from slum to slum, losing work, and
the difficulties which will beset them on this room-hunt.
They are thankful to have a roof, even with cracks in it,
and they will go on suffering-not in silence, perhaps, but
without taking action, because they know if they go further
they may fare worse. <figure><head>Washing His Potatoes.</></figure></p>
<p>The accommodation which these people will put up with
is almost incredible.</p>
<p>Some of the houses are as absolutely dangerous to life
and limb as those specially built up on the stage as pitfalls
for the unwary feet of the melodramatic heroes and heroines
led there by designing villains in order that they may fall
through traps into dark rivers and so be got rid of.</p>
<p>Here is a house which has been slowly decaying for
years; the people who live in it must be competent to
accept engagements as acrobats, yet from floor to roof
every room is densely inhabited.</p>
<p>The stairs are rotten, and here and there show where
some foot has trodden too heavily. The landing above is
a yawning gulf which you have to leap, and leap lightly,
or the rotten boarding would break away beneath you.
Open a door and look into a room. There are two women
and three children at work, and the holes in the floor are
patched across with bits of old boxes which the tenants
have nailed down themselves.</p>
<p>The place is absolutely a shell. There is not a sound
room or passage in it. Yet it is always crammed with
tenants, and they pay their rent without a murmur-nay,
within the last year the rents of the rooms have been raised
nearly twenty-five per cent.</p>
<p>The gentleman who inhabits the ground-floor with his
wife and family is best off. He is a bit of a humorist,
and he seems quite proud of pointing out to us the dilapidations of his dwelling-place, and takes the opportunity to
indulge in what the gentlemen of the theatrical persuasion
call <soCalled>wheezes.</soCalled></p> <pb id="p.41" n="41">
<p><q>Come thro',</q> he says; <q>well, no, I can't say as anybody have come through, not altogether. We sees a leg o'
somebody sometimes as we ain't invited to join us, and
now and agen a lump o' ceilin' comes down when the
young woman up stairs stamps her foot, but so long as
they don't start a dancin' acadermy up there, I don't
mind.</q></p>
<p><q>But haven't you spoken to the landlord about it?</q></p>
<p><q>Spoke! Lor' bless you ! wot's the use ? He'd larf at
us, and if he was to larf too loud it might be dangerous.
He won't do nothink. The place is bound to come down,
yer know, by and by, for improvements.</q></p>
<p>Possibly the man's explanation of the landlord's neglect
was correct, but to us it certainly appeared that the place
was more likely to come down for lack of improvements.</p>
<p>Going to bed under such circumstances as these must
require a good deal of confidence, but I suppose the contingency of the floor above descending on one in one's
sleep does not have the same terror for these people that it
had for the nervous hero of that story of Edgar Allan Poe's,
in which the room with contracting walls and descending
roof was supposed to be a horror worthy of the inventive
genius of the gentlemen of the Inquisition.</p>
<p>Of course, when the ordinary repairs demanded by consideration for the safety of life and limb are left undone,
and the most ordinary sanitary precautions are neglected,
it is not likely that the present race of poor tenement-owners
will listen to the appeals of those tenants whose livelihood
depends upon them keeping animals, and make some
provision for the housing of pigs and the stabling of
donkeys.</p>
<p>Strange, too, as it may seem, in the houses which are
being built on improved principles, no provision is made
for the barrows and donkeys of the costermonger-a class
which enters very largely into the composition of the one-roomed tribes. Some time ago a man was charged with
assaulting his wife, and at the magisterial hearing it was
elicited that the matrimonial quarrel was all on account of
a donkey which slept under the bed.</p>
<p>The magistrate was naturally astonished. He didn't
believe such a state of things possible. Doubtless his
wonder was shared by the public. The presence of a
donkey in the apartment of a costermonger and his family
is, however, by no means rare, and quite recently a zealous
sanitary inspector has discovered a cellar inhabited by a
man, his wife, three children, and four pigs.</p>
<p>The presence of animals not exactly regarded as domestic
is a feature of certain poor districts of London. Fowls
roost nightly in dozens of bedrooms in the back streets;
and only the other day a score of those miserable tortoises
that one sees on barrows destitute of the smallest vestige
of green stuff, and probably enduring the most prolonged
agony, were discovered crawling about the floor of a costermonger's attic among his progeny, only slightly inferior in
point of numbers to the poor animals themselves.</p>
<p>It is a great complaint of the men, who as a rule are
hardworking, honest fellows enough in their way, and
thrifty too when they can keep away from the temptation of
drink, that so little attention is being paid to their needs in
the many schemes for improved dwellings for the industrial
classes.</p>
<p>In some of the cases where the accommodation for ponies
and donkeys may fairly be called <soCalled>stabling,</soCalled> the entrance
is through the passage of a house densely inhabited, and
the animals are led in and out daily in such a manner as to
be a nuisance to the occupants, while the stables, being so
close to the windows of the room and kept in anything but
good order, are a constant danger to health.</p>
<p>I have been assured by an old inhabitant of the costers'
quarters that he knew a donkey who went upstairs to the
third floor every night to go to bed; but old inhabitants
are not to be relied upon, and I give you this story for what
it is worth.</p>
<p>Of one thing, however, no one who personally investigates the poorer districts of great cities can remain in
doubt. There are there hidden away from general observation marvels as great as any of those which the enterprising
Farini imports from the Cannibal Islands, the dismal
swamps, the deserts and jungles of the savage world, for
the amusement and edification of the shilling-paying public.
Missing links abound, and monstrosities are plentiful. Some
of the terrible sights which we have seen we have too much
respect for the readers' feelings to reproduce. Now and
again the revelations of some police court send a shudder
through society. Children starved and stunted and ignorant
as the lowest beasts of the forest are unearthed in foul
dens where they have passed their little lives chained to the
walls, or pounced upon by the police, led to the discovery
by the tavern gossip of the neighbours. Grown women
who have lived naked in underground cellars, and long ago
lost their reason, are found one fine morning by the merest
accident while their gaolers are away. On these hidden
horrors of unknown London I need not dwell here. The
history of Horrible London has yet to be written, but the
brutality which makes many of these terrible things possible
is largely due to the circumstances under which the poor
live. The careless disregard of human life and human
suffering which has so long characterised us as a nation
must bear fruit. The waste of human life brought about
by the conditions under which the poor are allowed to live
breeds in them a contempt for the sufferings of others.
They become hardened, and the cruelty at which we shudder
is their second nature. All that is best and holiest in life
there is nothing to encourage-only the ferocious instincts
of the brute are fostered by a state of existence in which
the struggle for the very air men breathe is bitter and
intense.</p>
<p>Says a philanthropist, who has gone to the root of this
appalling subject:- <q>In these districts men live in little
more than half the space their corpses occupy when dead.</q>
Think of it. Penetrate the awful places where vice and
squalor, crime and brutality reign supreme; where the oath
of the gin-maddened ruffian, the cry of the trampled wife,
and the wail of the terrified child ring out night and day;
where all is one fierce ferment in a hell upon earth, where
day brings no light, and night no rest, and ask your
self what manner of fruit these forcing-houses can bear.</p>
<p>When some one bold enough shall write <soCalled>Horrible <pb id="p.42" n="42">
London,</soCalled> and the black page lies open that all may read,
then, and not till then, will the enormity of the responsibility be recognised of those to whom the power to do so
much has been given and who have done so little.</p>
<p>That work is for stronger hands than mine to do. I am
content here to chronicle such lights and shadows of life
among the poor as fall across my path in a journey round
the outskirts only of the dark continent in our midst.<figure><head>In Petticoats.</></figure></p>
<p>Here is an incident which, pathetic enough, has yet its
humorous side. Here is a boy of eight years old in
petticoats, a big, strong, healthy lad. His father is a dock
labourer, and this is how he was brought forward as a
candidate for some cast-off clothing which a director of
the <rs type=org>East and West India Dock Company </rs> was generously
distributing.</p>
<p>The dock labourers are a distinct class among the East-end poor, and I hope at some future time to give the reader
a glimpse of life among them. How hard their struggle is
may be gathered when their boys have to go till eight and
nine years old in petticoats because the parents cannot
afford to buy them knickerbockers or trousers.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" id="c.9" n="9"><head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<p>THESE pages would be incomplete without at least a
passing reference to some of the many efforts which have
already been made to deal with the evils arising from the
condition of things it has been my desire to expose.</p>
<p>The mere charitable work going on I have not space to
deal with. There are night refuges, missions, and many
excellent institutions due to public and private enterprise in
all the poorer quarters, all of which in a manner more or less
satisfactory afford relief to the inhabitants.</p>
<p>One good work, however, which I do not care to leave
hiding its light under a bushel, is the home for factory-girls, managed by the Sisters of St. John the Baptist, Clewer and situated in Southwark. Here, girls employed in the many factories of the neighbourhood during the day can, if they are willing to submit to the rules, find a real home for a small weekly payment, and escape the wretched and too often vicious surroundings of the places in which their parents live.</p>
<p>With full knowledge of all the temptation which besets the working-girls who have to spend their leisure in these slums none can doubt the good work such institutions may do.</p>
<p>On the night of our visit we were conducted from basement to roof by one of the Sisters; we saw the girls and heard their histories from their own lips, and learnt how terrible was the sin and misery which had forced them to look upon their vile homes with loathing, and how fierce the temptation which beset them when left to themselves.</p>
<p>These girls are of the class which most deserve help; they work hard at dangerous trades for their livinng and<figure><head>Sister.</></figure> they pay for their food and board. What the charity does
is to throw a certain home influence around them; give
them cleanliness and godliness, and preserve them to some
extent from the contamination of the streets-streets here
which are thronged at night with the worst types of humanity
the great city can show.</p>
<p>The story of the Mission is romantic. A lady, Mrs. Hun <pb id="p.43" n="43">
was left a young widow. After less than two years of married
life her husband died suddenly. She devoted herself to her
own daughter, who grew up into a beautiful girl. The
morning after her first ball the young lady was found dead
in her bed. To assuage her grief and keep from breaking
down utterly, the bereaved mother determined to devote
herself to charity. The fearful condition of the young girls
in this neighbourhood was brought to her attention, and
with her fortune and her dead daughter's she devoted herself
to establishing a home for factory-girls.</p>
<p>Such is the short and simple story of how this excellent
institution was founded. How it is carried out, how the
girls cling to the Home, and how thoroughly they appreciate
its comforts, any lady can see who cares to take a trip as far
as Union Street, Borough, and ring the bell of the <rs type=place>All
Hallows' Mission-House.</rs></p>
<p>The work which these girls have to do in return for a
small wage is generally of a dangerous character. Many of
them literally snatch their food from the jaws of death.</p>
<p>One girl in the Home was white and ill and weak, and
her story may be taken as a sample. She worked at the
<soCalled>bronzing,</soCalled> that is, a branch of the chromo-lithography
business, and it consists in applying a fluid, which gives off
a poisonous exhalation, to certain work. Bronzing enters
largely into the composition of those Christmas pictures
which delight us so much at the festive season, and which
adorn the nursery of many a happy, rosy-cheeked English
child.</p>
<p>The law recognising the dangerous nature of the works
says that the girls doing it shall be allowed a pint of milk
per day, the milk in some way counteracting the effect of
the poison the girls inhale. It will hardly be believed that
some of the best firms refuse to comply with the regulation,
and if the girls complain they are at once discharged.</p>
<p>Now, the wages paid are seven shillings per week. To
keep at their employment it is necessary that the workers
take castor-oil daily, and drink at least a pint of milk. They
must either pay for these luxuries out of their scanty earnings
or go without, and eventually find their way to the hospital.</p>
<p>Take another trade-the fur-pulling. The women and
girls employed at this are in some shops locked in the room
with their work, and have to eat their food there.</p>
<p>If you had ever seen a room crowded with girls pulling
the fluff from cats, rabbits, rats, and goodness knows what
other animals, you would appreciate the situation better.
The fluff, the down, and the small hairs smother everything,
and are necessarily swallowed by the occupants of the room
with pernicious effect. Yet it is the custom of some of the
men in the trade to force their employees to eat under such
circumstances, that is, to swallow their food thickly coated
with the hairs from which nothing can preserve it.<p>
<p>Why do not the women refuse? Because they would be
discharged. There are always hundreds ready and eager to
take their places. The struggle for bread is too fierce for
the fighters to shrink from any torture in its attainment.</p>
<p>With the dangers of the white-lead works, which employ a
large number of these families, most people are now familiar;
at least, those who read the inquests must be. In addition
to the liability to lead-poisoning, in many of these works
the machinery is highly dangerous. In spite of the Employer's Liability Act, the victims of machinery accidents
-that is, when they are women or children-rarely get
compensation.</p>
<p>The hospitals are full of accidents from these causes;
often the negligence is that of a fellow-workman, but in at
least half-a-dozen cases I have investigated not one shilling
of compensation has the victim obtained.</p>
<p>Saw-mills, and places where steam and circular saws are
used, employ a large number of boys. If you were to give <figure><head>Rabbit Pulling</></figure>
a tea-party to saw-mill boys, the thing that would astonish
you would be the difficulty of finding half-a-dozen of your
guests with the proper number of fingers.</p>
<p>I know one little lad who is employed at pulling out the
planks which have been pushed through the machine by
men, and he has one hand now on which only the thumb is
left. Then there is the lemonade-bottling, which is another
industry largely employing the lads of poor neighbourhoods.
The bottles are liable to burst, and cases of maiming are
almost of daily occurrence. The bottlers are obliged to
wear masks to protect their faces, but their hands are bound
to be exposed to the danger.</p>
<p>These are a few of the dangerous and unhealthy occupations by which the poor live, and I have enumerated
those largely practised by children. I have done so to
show how little we can wonder if for lack of a protecting
arm, or that parental love which is, alas, so rare a thing in
the very poor districts, these boys and girls yield to the first <pb id="p.44" n="44">
temptation to go wrong, and instead of risking life and
limb for a paltry wage, take to those paths of vice which we
have it on the highest authority are always the most easy of
access.</p>
<p>As we leave the home of the factory girls we come upon
a scene which illustrates the life outside. A big crowd of
foul-mouthed, blackguardly boys and girls, with a few men
and women among them, are gathered round two girls who
are fighting fiercely. They have quarrelled, a bystander
tells us, in the adjacent public-house about a young man.
He is considered her legitimate property by one lady, and
the said lady has surprised him treating her rival to gin.
Neither of the girls are more than seventeen, I should say,
yet they are fighting and blaspheming and using words that
make even myself and my collaborator shudder, used as we
are by this time to the defiled Saxon of the slums.</p>
<p><q>Go it, Sal,</q> yells a female friend, and Sal goes it, and
the boys and girls stand round and enjoy the spectacle, and
add their chorus of blasphemy and indecency to the quarrel
duet of the Madame Angots of the gutter.</p>
<p>I had nearly forgotten an incident which occurred when
we were in the factory-girls' home, and which is not without
its lesson as showing the value even these girls attach to
social position. One young lady was introduced to us as
having a sweetheart who always brought her home of an
evening with great punctuality. <q> What is your sweetheart ?</q>
I asked. <q>A boot-finisher,</q> was the answer. <q>Where
does he work-at what firm?</q> <q>He works just by <rs type=station>Fenchurch Street Station</rs>.</q> <q>Is it a large bootmaker's?</q>
<q>Well, it ain't exactly a bootmaker's; he's a shoeblack.</q>
I never heard a shoeblack called a boot-finisher before, but
I think the euphemism was allowable in a young lady who
wishes to exalt the commercial status of her intended.</p>
<p>I alluded in a recent Chapter to the costermongers as a
large and worthy class. Since that Chapter was written I
have explored a district which is almost exclusively inhabited by them-a portion of St. Luke's. To what I have
already written let me add that until now I had not the
slightest conception that things were so bad as they really
are. My visit was early in the morning, before the men
and women had gone out with their loads. If you could
have seen the condition of the rooms and yards piled up
with rotting vegetable refuse, and the way in which the
cabbages and the fruit were stowed for the night, and where
they were stowed, it would have cured such among you as
are fond of a bargain at the door from ever patronising a
barrow again.</p>
<p>Out of the fetid one room where man and wife and
family slept they carried the stuff that their neighbours were
to eat. It had passed the night with them, and the green-stuff was decidedly faded and languid. It was piled on
the barrow, and then soused with dirty water, and so
wheeled away to be cried up and down the streets of
London.</p>
<p>No wonder diseases are spread if from such poisoned
fever-breeding dens as this the food is carried with all its
impurity day after day to be hawked from door to door!<p>
<p>I do not blame the costers. They must get where there
is an open space for their barrows handy, some bit of waste
land where houses have been condemned and pulled down.
They stack their barrows here, taking off one wheel and
carrying it home, that their property may not be wheeled
off in the night. But areas with this waste land are limited,
so up go the prices, and the coster must pay. In Green
Arbour Court, St. Luke's, I came upon a man who was
paying <measure value="8." type=currency><num value="8">eight</num></measure>shillings a week for one miserable room, and
all round the district the very vilest accommodation fetches
something very near that figure.</p>
<p>Eight<measure value="8." type=currency><num value="8">eight</num></measure> shillings a week for one room! Surely a class that
can pay that must be worth catering for even by the five
per cent. philanthropists.</p>
<p>Some time ago there was a scheme to build a goods
station in this district, and before the Bill could be considered Parliament required a labouring-class statement, that
is, a statement of the number of poor people who would be
displaced.</p>
<p>On looking through the figures I find that to build this
station about 3,000 poor people would have to be turned
out of their homes.</p>
<p>It is the pulling down of area after area for the purpose
of building large warehouses and railway stations, and that
sort of thing, which is, of course, at the root of the overcrowding. The accommodation becomes more limited
year after year, and the property built as dwelling-houses
under the Artisans' Dwelling Act does not, as I have
pointed out before, offer any accommodation to the class
displaced.<figure><head>Fine Straw-B-Ries. Fine Fresh-Gathered Stroby-riees.</></figure></p>
<p>In another district I made a discovery which I fancy
must be unique, I found a public house which was a highway for traffic. You went out of a street into a bar--you
walked straight through and found yourself in a network of
courts behind. I found on inqury that for years the public
house had been used as a footpath, and I have no doubt it
was found highly convenient by ladies and gentlemen in a
hurry to escape observation.</p>
<p>In another district still I unearthed as sweet a little story
as any of the annals of jobbery can, I imagine, furnish. Let <pb id="p.45" n="45"><p><figure><head>Go it, Sal!</></figure> <pb n="46" id="p.46">
me tell it carefully, for the law of libel is a fearful and
wonderful thing, and I have no desire to have the proprietors
of this journal reading their next Christmas number in
Holloway Gaol.</p>
<p>A big block of buildings falling into decay were for sale.
A person officially connected with the parish drew the
attention of the sanitary officers to them, and had them
condemned as unfit for habitation. Directly this was done
the parish gentleman, in conjunction with a firm of speculators, bought the property for a bagatelle-for old building
material, in fact. But the new proprietors didn't pull it
down-not they. They gave a coat of whitewash here and
there, and let every single room again directly at increased
rentals, and every single room is full of rent-payers now.
The street of houses which was condemned five years ago
has been a little gold mine, and a handsome fortune has
been made out of it by the very people who insisted upon
calling the attention of the sanitary authorities to it.
It is needless to say that the same attention has never
been solicited since.</p>
<p>I should like to know how many more blocks of property
-unfit for human habitation-are held in the same way in
London.</p>
<p>I fancy the revelations on this subject would be startling
to a degree.</p>
<p>Yet amidst all these horrors and sufferings, working at
dangerous trades, housed in death-traps, neglected and
persecuted, the poor manage to live, and some of them to
amuse themselves. How they amuse themselves we shall
shortly see.</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" id="c.10" n="10">
<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<p>WHEN I come to the task of describing how the poor
amuse themselves, there comes back to me the memory of a
certain <soCalled>exam.</soCalled> I submitted myself to in the happy long
ago. I am not quite sure now whether the result was to be
a clerkship in Somerset House, or a certificate of proficiency
which I could frame, and glaze, and hang up in my bedroom; all I remember is, that I was taken up to London
with half-a-dozen of my fellow-collegians, and deposited
in a large room, at a desk, and that in front of me was
placed a paper with a string of printed questions on it,
which I was requested to answer in writing. The questions
were not particularly flabbergasting then, though I doubt
whether I could answer a single one of them correctly now;
but that which carried terror to my fluttering heart at once
was the special note which enjoined me to write my
answers briefly and concisely. There are certain questions
which will not be answered in half-a-dozen words. Several
such there were on my examination-paper, and such a question, after a lapse of years, again stands and defies me to
mortal combat.</p>
<p><q>How do the poor amuse themselves ?</q></p>
<p>The name of their amusements is legion, and to catalogue
them briefly is beyond my powers, even after a long life
passed among postcards, which are used on one side only,
and telegraph forms, on which one word over twenty puts
25 per cent. on to the cost of transmission.</p>
<p>The principal amusement of the people who have no
money is, I take it, loafing at street corners and gossiping
with their neighbours, and the form of enjoyment by far the
most prevalent is getting drunk.</p>
<p>The public-house, after centuries of philanthropic tall-talk
and hundreds of miles of newspaper and magazine writing,
tracts and essays, remains still the Elysian field for the tired
toiler. The well-meaning efforts of the societies which have
endeavoured to attract the poor to hear countesses play the
fiddle and baronets sing comic songs in temperance halls
have not been crowned with anything like success, for the
simple reason that there is an air of charity and goody-goody
about the scheme which the poor always regard with suspicion. They want their amusement as a right, not as a
favour, and they decline to be patronised.</p>
<p>The public-house, then, is still the centre of attraction for
the masses during their leisure-the public-house and its
giant offspring, the music-hall. The old Free and Easy,
held every Monday or every Saturday, as the case might be,
in the bar-parlour or the big room up stairs, is dying the
death-the halls have killed it. There are a few still in
existence, but the attendance is meagre, and the entertainment is only kept up by ambitious amateurs of the type who
sit back in a chair and close their eyes to sing a sentimental
ballad, and the young gentlemen who are anxious to exchange the workshop or the counter for the footlights, and
try their hand first at the comic songs of Messrs. Arthur
Roberts and McDermott before the dozen or so of the bar-parlour frequenters of the Blue Bear who make up the
weekly audiences of the <soCalled>Free and Easy.</soCalled></p>
<p>The old sporting-houses, once the resort of half the blackguardism of the East-end and a good deal of the West, have
gone down before the steady bowling of the law. The friendly
bouts with the gloves between local <soCalled>chickens</soCalled> and
<soCalled>novices,</soCalled> which once were regular Saturday night amuse
ments, are few and far between, and dog-fights and ratting
matches have to be searched for by the curious as diligently
as though they were looking for a policeman in a suburban
neighbourhood, and the result is generally the same.</p>
<p>That boxing and ratting, and other forms of the <soCalled> fancy,</soCalled>
still exist as part of the amusement of the lower orders, is
perfectly true, but they exist in such a hole-and-corner, out-of-the-way, few-and-far-between .style, that they can no
longer be classed as among the amusements of those who
cannot afford to pay high prices of admission to illegal
entertainments.</p>
<p>The noble art of self-defence did undoubtedly linger
among the lower orders as a. pastime long after it had
passed out of favour with the Corinthians, and many of the
porters of Billingsgate, Covent Garden, and Smithfield,
waterside labourers, costermongers, and street hawkers are
to this day famous as <soCalled>bruisers,</soCalled> and given to indulge their
friends at odd times with a display of their prowess on the
extreme Q.T., in quiet out-houses and secluded spots where
the police are unlikely to mar the harmony of the proceed <pb id ="p.47" n="47"><p><figure><head>"'Ere Y' Are; Three Shots a Penny! Now's Yer Charnce!!!"</></figure>
ings. Such meetings, when they do take place, always
attract a mob of the lowest riff-raff, and if there be, as
is generally the case, a charge for admission, ragged
wretches, who look as though a crust of bread and cheese
would be of considerable advantage to them, manage in some
mysterious way to find the requisite amount of silver, without
the production of which the crystal Bar of the Pug's Paradise moves not, and the sporting Peri is sent disconsolate
away.</p>
<p>It has been my good or evil fortune, in my desire to know
all sorts and conditions of men, to witness some of the latest
revivals of glove-fighting; now in drill-sheds, now in top
floors of public-houses, and once in the upper floor of a
workshop, which nearly gave way with the weight of
accumulated blackguardism collected. These, it is only
fair to say, were mostly <soCalled>ramps,</soCalled> or swindles, got up to
obtain the gate money, and generally interrupted by circumstances arranged beforehand by those who were going to
<soCalled>cut up</soCalled> the plunder.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the suburban racecourse has now
absorbed most of the poorer patrons of the ring, and the
fighting men-that is, the class who are of the slum order-find employment in connection with the betting lists and
booths. The turf is still as highly patronised as ever in
poor districts, in spite of the objection of the police to
ready-money betting, and the racing element enters largely
into the recreations of the residuum.</p>
<p>This, however, is hardly the class of amusement with
which we are concerned, which is more that which
engages the attention of the poorer toilers after work
hours. The Saturday night is the great night in these districts for the play which prevents Jack being dull,
and accordingly it is a Saturday night we select to take a
trip once more through the streets of the unfashionable
quarters.</p>
<p>We choose the heart of a thickly-populated district, and
emerge from comparative quiet into a Babel of sound. A
sharp turn brings us from a side street into one long
thoroughfare ablaze with light and as busy as a fair. It is
a fair in fact; the pavement and the roadway are crowded
with a seething mass of human beings side by side with the
meat-stalls, the fish-stalls, the fruit and vegetable-stalls, and
the cheap finery-stalls; there are shooting-galleries, try-your-strength-machines, weighing-chairs, raffling-boards, and
nothing is lacking but <soCalled> three shies a penny</soCalled> and a Richardson's show to make a complete picture of an old-fashioned
fair.</p><p>All the world and his wife are out to-night, and the wildest extravagances are being committed in the way of fish
for supper to-night and vegetables for dinner to-morrow.
The good housewives, basket on arm, are giving the ready-witted hawker as much repartee over the price of a cabbage
as would suffice for a modern comedy.</p>
<p>The workman, released fromhis toil, is smoking his pipe and
listening open-mouthed to the benevolent and leather-lunged
gentlemen who are sacrificing household utensils, boots,
ornaments, concertinas, and cutlery, at prices which would
have cajoled the money from the pocket of a Daniel Dancer.
And the golden youth of the neighbourhood, with their best
attire on, all cut after one relentless fashion-the mashers
of the East-they too are out in full force, entering into the
wild delirium of reckless pleasure which the scene invites.
The principal amusement in the street, apart from buying
knives and neckties of the Cheap Jack and entering into a
raffle for a concertina, which is the sole business of one
densely crowded stall, seems to be shooting at a target-
three shots a penny, and the prize for hitting the bull's-eye,
a real Whitechapel cigar. This seems to be an intensely
popular pastime with the boys, and the one who wins a
cigar and turns away and proudly lights it is at once surrounded by a crowd of lads, who praise his skill and plead
for a puff at the luxury which his marksmanship has won
for him.</p>
<p>The public-houses are crammed all along the line. This
form of <soCalled>amusement </soCalled> seems to be the favourite one with
families, for in house after house there are little groups <figure><head> An East-end "Masher."</></figure>
comprising a grey-headed old lady with a glass of neat gin,
a buxom young woman with a baby and ditto, and a burly
young fellow with a big pewter. On barrels against the
wall and on forms set round, these groups of young men
and young women are talking more or less loudly, and
spending an idle hour in putting the bulk of the week's
wages down their throats. It is a truism to say that the
curse of the lower orders is drink, but no man with eyes
can walk on a Saturday night through the homes of the
wage-earning class without feeling how terrible the evil
is, and how earnestly, without being either a bigot or a
fanatic, every man who has a chance should raise his voice
at the criminal neglect which flings these poor people into
the arms of their only caterer-the publican.</p>
<p>Many people object to the music-halls as sinks of iniquity.
That they are unmixed blessings I am not going to contend, <pb id="p.49" n="49"> <p><figure> <head> A Critical Audience on the Question of "Step-Dancing."</></figure>
but if properly conducted they do an immense deal of comparative good. Drink is sold certainly in some of them,
but few people get drunk. A very little liquor goes a long
way at a hall, and the people being amused and interested
in the entertainment do not want much liquid sustenance.
The entertainments at some of the lower halls might, it is <figure><head>Why Pay a Doctor?</></figure>
true, be weeded of certain suggestive songs, but after all the
best patrons of indecency are the rich, and the poor give
their loudest applause to skilful dancing and sentimental
singing. A good ballad, well sung, <soCalled>fetches</soCalled> the masses
as nothing else will, and they can appreciate good music. If
the managers of halls would do away with the coarser items
in their programmes, I should say that this form of entertaining the masses was absolutely calculated to benefit them.
I am quite certain that to keep young men and women off
the streets and away from bars is no bad service to the
cause of morality. In the east of London there are several
places where a big entertainment is given and no liquor is sold
at all. At one of them-the best of its kind in London-
there are two houses nightly. From seven till nine dramas
are performed, then everybody is turned out and the house
is refilled with a fresh audience for a music-hall entertainment
-and nearly every evening the theatre is crammed to suffocation; the admission is 1d. the gallery, 2d. the pit, and 3d.
and 6d. the upper circle and boxes. On the night of our
visit there wasn't room to cram another boy in the place; <pb id="p.51" n="51">
the gallery and pit were full of boys and girls of from eight to
fifteen, I should say, and the bulk of the audience in the
other parts were quite young people.</p>
<p>The gallery was a sight which once seen could never be
forgotten. It was one dense mass of little faces and white
bare arms twined and intertwined like snakes round a tree-tier above tier of boys rising right away from the front rows
until the heads of the last row touched the ceiling. It was
a jam-not a crowd-when one boy coughed it shook the
thousands wedged in and round about; and when one boy
got up to go out he had to crawl and walk over the heads of
the others; space below for a human foot to rest there was
absolutely none.</p>
<p>All this vast audience was purely local. Our advent,
though our attire was a special get-up for the occasion,
attracted instant attention, and the cry of <soCalled>Hottentots</soCalled>
went round. <soCalled>Hottentots </soCalled> is the playful way in this district of designating a stranger, that is to say, a stranger come
from the West.</p>
<p>The entertainment was admirable; the artistes were clever,
and in only one case absolutely vulgar; and the choruses
were joined in by the entire assembled multitude.</p>
<p>When it was time for the chorus to leave off and the
singer to go on again, an official in uniform, standing by the
orchestra, and commanding the entire house, raised his
hand, and instantly, as if by magic, the chorus ceased.
<p>Of course there are disturbances, but the remedy is short
and effective. Two young gentlemen in the dress circle
fought and used bad language to each other. Quick as
lightning the official was up stairs with a solitary policeman,
the delinquents were seized by the collar, and, before they
could expostulate, flung down a flight of steps and hustled
out into the street with a celerity which could only come of
constant practice.</p>
<p>It is fair to say that the youths seemed quite ready for the
emergency, and took their <soCalled>chucking out</soCalled> most skilfully.
I should have fallen and broken my nose had I been flung
down a flight of steps like that; these youths were evidently
prepared, and took a flying jump on to the landing. What
they did outside I can't say, but after a chorus of hooting at
the helmeted intruder, the audience resumed their seats, and
the performance went on without any further interruption.
<p>Such places as this-the cheaper halls, gaffs, and sing-songs-are the principal places of resort of the ladies and
gentlemen of the slums who have coppers to spare for
amusement. But the streets themselves offer to many a
variety of entertainments for which there is no charge. A
horse down is a great source of quiet enjoyment; a fight
attracts hundreds; and round in one dark spot, we came
upon an al fresco gambling establishment, where some
hundreds of lads were watching half-a-dozen of their companions playing some game at cards on a rough deal stand,
presided over by a villainous-looking Jew. What the game
was we could not stay long enough to study, for our approach was signalled by scouts, and as we came close to the
crowd it dispersed as if by magic, and the gentleman with
the board produced from his pocket a quantity of cough-drops, and flung them upon the board, bawling aloud, <q>Six
a penny, six a penny !</q> in a manner intended to convince
us that this was his occupation. Possibly we were mistaken
for plain-clothes policemen; at any rate, we were followed
and watched for fully a hundred yards.</p>
<p>The mock-litany scoundrel had a big crowd in one street,
and an infant phenomenon-a boy who played all the popular
airs down the spout of a coffee-pot-was largely patronised;
but the biggest audience of the evening surrounded a gentleman who, mounted on a cart, was at once carrying on the
business of an ointment vendor and the profession of an
improvisatore. His ointment was only a penny a box, but
its intrinsic merits were priceless. It was warranted to draw
glass or iron or steel from any part of the human body with
one application; also to cure weak eyes, bad legs, and sores
of all descriptions.
<p>The gentleman indulged in anecdotes full of ancient and
modern history, all proving the value of his ointment, and
every now and then he dropped into rhyme.</p>
<p>If you have a bad leg, and physicians have given you up,
Or you've been to the doctor's who've half poisoned you with nasty
stuff,
Perhaps you fancy that it's no good that your leg can't be cured;
But Moore's ointment will do of that, rest assured.
Try it; if it don't succeed, you're only a penny the worse.
If you don't try it, you may think of it too late, when you're in your
funeral hearse.
It's cured hundreds, and thousands will testify
It is good for even the tenderest baby's eye.
Why pay a doctor, or in hospital lie for months,
When this ointment will cure you by only applying it once?</p>
<p>Then the gentleman broke off into prose, and related
how Napoleon, in the Island of <soCalled>Helber</soCalled> had bought a
box of this very ointment of the seller's grandfather, who
was under the British Government then, and had declared, if
ever he got free, every soldier in the French army should
have a box in his knapsack, and also gave certain humorous
reminiscences of his own struggles to get the English
people to believe in the specific. His eloquence was not
thrown away, for he did a roaring trade, and at one time
a perfect forest of hands was held up to secure the famous
ointment.</p>
<p>The crowd thins as closing time comes, and the hawkers
pack up what is left of their stock, strike their naptha-lamps,
and wheel off the ground. What they have left they will
sell in the early market on Sunday morning.</p> <pb id="p.52" n="52">

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<p><figure></>L00KING over what I have written
I am struck by what
seems to me an important omission. In driving home the nail of the miserable condition in which the poor are forced to live, I have perhaps led the reader to imagine
that the better instincts of humanity have been utterly
stamped out -that the courts and alleys are great wastes
of weed, where never a flower grows.</p>
<p>I should be loth to father such an idea as this. In the
course of many years of the closest contact with the most
poverty-stricken of our fellow-men, I have learnt to think
better, and not worse, of human nature, and to know that
love, self-sacrifice, and devotion flourish in this barren soil
as well as in the carefully-guarded family circles which are,
or should be, forcing-houses for all that is choicest and most
beautiful among human instincts.</p>
<p>Braver than many a hero who comes back from foreign
plains with a deed of prowess to his credit and a medal on
his breast, are some of the ragged rank and file who fight
the battle of life against overwhelming odds, and never
flinch or falter, but fight on to the end; and the end, alas!
is rarely victory or renown-too often the guerdon of these
brave soldiers is the workhouse, the hospital, or a miserable
death from cold and slow starvation, in a quiet corner of the
street, where they have sunk down to rise no more.</p>
<p>It is often a matter of wonder-at least I hope it is-to
the good folks who skim their newspapers at the morning
meal and take their politics, their Court Circular, and their
police intelligence at a single draught between their sips of
coffee, what becomes of the children whose fathers and
mothers are sent to prison for long or short periods.</p>
<p>The State does not consider the innocent victims of
crime; the law punishes the individual without taking
thought of the consequences to those who may be dependent
upon her or him for bread. I am not advocating any
leniency to a culprit on the score of his value as a bread-winner; I am simply going to state a few facts, and leave
my readers to draw any moral they please from the
narrative.</p>
<p>Half the men and women of the lower orders who are
imprisoned for various small offences, such as being drunk
and incapable, assaulting each other, or committing petty
larceny, are married and have families. Bachelors and
spinsters are rare after a certain age in low neighbourhoods,
and large families are invariably the result of early marriages,
or that connection which, among the criminal classes and
the lowest grade of labourers, does duty for the legally-solemnised institution.</p>
<p>Many persons who wander into police-courts at the East-end, either for business or amusement, must be familiar with
the poor woman, a baby in her arms, and her head strapped
up with sticking-plaster and surgical bandages, who begs the
magistrate not to punish the hulking fellow in the dock who
has so brutally ill-used her. <figure><head>"I'll Do for You Wen I Come Out."</></figure>The woman knows, what the
magistrate and the public ignore, that the three months'
sentence means comfort and luxury to the man-misery and
starvation to the woman and her little ones.</p>
<p>He has probably been the chief bread-winner; the woman
is incapacitated by his ill-treatment from doing any work,
and so she and her children are suddenly rendered penniless
and homeless. She must crawl back from the court to her
miserable garret, and when her babies ask for food pawn her
few rags to get it for them; and when all is pawned and
gone, she cannot pay her nightly rent, so she must turn out
with her little family into the streets or go into the work-house. Such a case we heard as we looked into a police-court on our travels; and I shall not soon forget the agonised <pb id="p.53" n="53">
cry of the woman as the magistrate gave her husband six
months, and congratulated her on being temporarily rid of
such a ruffian.</p>
<p><q>Great God, what will become of us now?</q></p>
<p>I see that many humane people are asking what can be
done to alleviate the sufferings of the poor. I don't know
whether there is any society which looks after the wives and
children of malefactors, and lends them a helping hand, if
they deserve it, to tide over the absence of their sole source
of income; but if there is not, I fancy here is work for idle
hands to do, and a source for charity that, worked with
discrimination and care, might alleviate one of the crushing
evils to which poor families are liable.<figure><head> "It's all a Mistake, Your Worship, All a Mistake; He Didn't Do Nuffing, He Wouldn't 'Urt a Fly!"</></figure></p>
<p>But these people are not always friendless, and it is a
case I wish to quote which has led me to touch upon the
subject.</p>
<p>In one wretched room we visited there were six little
ones home at the mid-day hour from school.</p>
<p><q>You have six children ?</q> I said to the woman.</p>
<p><q>No, sir, only four; these two little ones ain't mine-they are staying with us.</q></p>
<p>I imagined that they were the children of a relative, and
questioned the woman further, wondering how she cared to
crowd her little den with extra visitors, and then the story
came out.</p>
<p>These two extra mouths the good soul was feeding be
longed to two little children whose mother, a widow, lived
in a room above. For an assault upon the police she had
been sent to prison. Thus the position of these orphans
with a living parent was terrible. They would have been
starved or taken to the workhouse, but this good creature
went up and fetched them down to be with her own
children, and made them welcome; she washed them and
dressed them, and did for them all she could, and she
intended to keep them if she was able till the mother came
out.</p>
<p><q>She didn't see that she had done anything wonderful.
It was only neighbourly-like, and my heart bled to see the
poor young 'uns a-cryin', and that wretched and neglected
and dirty.</q></p>
<p>Such cases as this are common enough-the true charity,
the charity which robs itself to give to others, is nowhere
so common as among the poor. The widow's mite that
won the Saviour's praise is cast into the great treasury
daily, and surely stands, now, as then, far higher on the
roll of good deeds than all the gold flung carelessly
by the hands of the rich to every box rattler who
promises <q>that the amount shall be duly acknowledged
in the Times.</q></p>
<p>I will quote one more case, which has just come under
my personal observation, and which illustrates the brave
struggles against adversity of which those people are
capable.</p>
<p>Our attention was directed to the circumstance by the
head-mistress of the school which the children were
attending, and who had noticed that they who had always
been the cleanest and tidiest in the class were beginning to
show signs of a little less motherly care. The children
said their mother was too ill to do much, and we went to
see her.</p>
<p>Mrs. B. had some children of her own, and in addition
she and her husband had taken in a little girl whose father
had gone off tramping in search of work.</p>
<p>We found her propped up in a chair looking terribly ill,
but in front of her in another chair was the wash-tub, and
the poor woman was making a feeble effort to wash and
wring out some of the children's things. She was dying.
She was suffering from dropsy, and had not lain down for a
month-the water was rising rapidly and would soon reach
her heart and kill her. Yet here she sat, scarcely able to
breathe, and enduring untold agony, but making an effort
to the very last to work and keep her little ones clean and
tidy.</p>
<p>It is a glorious lot in life-these people's, is it not?-to
toil on and struggle, to resist temptation, and giving their
youth and age to the hardest labour for a wage that barely
staves off starvation, to know that when illness comes or
time steals their strength away, they are mere burthens,
refuse to be got rid of since it encumbers the land.</p>
<p>Can one blame them if, knowing their hard lot and the
little reward the most virtuous life can bring them, they sink
into the temptations spread around them ? Remember, that
for half their miseries, half their illness and premature
decay, and much of the disease which cripples and carries
off their children, the shameful way in which they are <pb id="p.54" n="54">
housed, and the callous neglect of their rights as citizens by
the governing class is responsible.</p>
<p>They are handicapped in the race from start to finish.
And under these circumstances, such charity, such humanity,
and such patience and long-suffering as exist among them
are indeed worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>The natural instinct of man is to eviland when I read in
little tracts and clerical addresses of the awful depravity of<figure><head>" I Can Do That there Little Bit on My 'Ed."</></figure>
the <soCalled>heathen in our midst,</soCalled> I am tempted to ask what the
reverend gentlemen and shocked philanthropists expect. I
say, with a full knowledge of their surroundings, that the
lower classes of our great cities are entitled to the highest
credit for not being twenty times more depraved than they
are.</p>
<p>They are a class which contains the germs of all that goes
to make up good citizenship, and the best proof of it is the
patience with which they endure the systematic neglect oftheir more fortunate fellow-countrymen. In any other land
but ours, the mighty mass of helots would long ago have
broken their bonds and swept over the land in vast revolutionary hordes. They did not always know their power,
and had not enough knowledge to appreciate their wrongs.
Education is opening their eyes, and their lips will not be
slow to express their new-born sentiments. It will be well
to meet the movement half-way and yield to them that
reform and humane recognition which some day they may
all too noisily demand.</p>
<p>Here am I up on a platform and thumping away at the
table and spouting what I have no doubt many excellent
persons will think is rank communism, though it is nothing
of the sort. Peccavi, I apologise. The fumes of the
misery I have passed through the last two months have got
into my head and made me talk wildly. Let me resume
my labour more in the character of a missionary or special <pb id="p.55" n="55">
correspondent, and leave oratory and denunciation to the
Sunday morning Wilkeses of Battersea Park.</p>
<p>We have no business out of doors at all-let us study
another domestic interior. The scene, a street which lies
cheek by jowl with the quarter where the world of fashion
rolls nightly in comfortable carriages to enjoy theatrical and
operatic performance in half-guinea stalls and three-guinea
boxes, and where fabulous fortunes are made by those who
can make Mr. and Mrs. Dives weep at imaginary woes or
laugh at a merry jest or comic antic.</p>
<p>From such a scene as I am going to ask you to witness,
thousands who crowd a theatre nightly to see a woman's
head battered out against a sofa or a young man suffocate
himself with the fumes of charcoal, would shrink back in
disgust. But you will not, for if you have gone so far with
us as this journey, you are, I feel sure, convinced that no
good can come of hiding the worst phase of a question which
is only dragged forward here that it may, by the very horror
of its surroundings, arrest attention and so secure that discussion which must always precede a great scheme of
reformation.</p>
<p>Come with me to this place. Our way lies through Clare
Market, so don't go alone, for it is a dangerous neighbourhood to strangers. Come with me through strange sights
and sounds, past draggled, tipsy women crowding the foot-way, and hulking fellows whose blasphemies fill the tainted
air, pick your way carefully through the garbage and filth
that litter the streets, and stop in this narrow thoroughfare
which is but a stone's throw from many a stage that holds
the mirror up to nature, and yet would shrink from holding
such a scene as this.</p>
<p>We have stopped at a marine-store shop-we enter the
passage and find our way up to the third floor. Here in a
single room live a man, his wife, and three children. There
has been an inquest on a baby who has died-poisoned by
the awful atmosphere it breathed. We have stumbled up
the dark crazy staircase at the risk of our limbs, to see this
room in which the family live and sleep and eat, because in
its way it is a curiosity. It has been the scene of an
incident which one would hardly believe possible in this
Christian country. For days in this foul room the body of
a dead baby had to lie because the parish had no mortuary.
Not only did the corpse have to lie here for days among
the living, but on that little table, propped against the
window, the surgeon had to perform a post-mortem
examination.</p>
<p>Think of it, you who cry out that the sufferings of these
people are sensationally exaggerated-the dead baby was
cut open in the one room where the mother and the other
little ones, its brothers and sisters, lived and ate and slept.
And why?<p>
<p>Because the parish had no mortuary, and no room in
which post-mortems could be performed.
<p>The jurymen who went to view the body sickened at the
frightful exhalations of this death-trap, and one who had
thirty years' experience of London said never had he seen a
fouler den.
<p>I have turned to the newspapers for a report of the
inquest and found it, and I think it will be better to present
it word for word. It is an ordinary newspaper report of
what has happened and been legally investigated, and may
carry conviction where my own unsupported testimony
would fail.
<p><q>A coroner's inquiry was held last night by Mr. Langham
regarding the death of an infant aged two and a half
months, the daughter of a butcher named Kent, who, with
his wife and three children, occupy a single room on the
third floor of premises used as a marine store in Wych
Street. The inquiry was held in the Vestry Room of the
parish. On the return of the jury from viewing the body-which lay in the room occupied by the family-one of the
jurymen addressed the coroner. He had, he stated, during
his thirty years' residence in the parish, seen many places
which he regarded as unfit for dwelling houses, but never had
he seen one so bad as that which the jury had just visited.
The staircase was dark and out of repair. The atmosphere
inside was intolerable. Indeed, it was so bad that several
of his fellow jurymen had felt ill while they were there. They
hoped that this expression of opinion would have some
effect in inducing the proper authorities to provide a mortuary for the district, and that families who lived in one room
might not be compelled to sleep and take their meals with
a dead body within sight. Mr. Samuel Mills, surgeon,
3, Southampton Street, Strand, medical officer to the Bow
Street Division of Police, deposed that he had made a post-mortem examination of the body on a propped-up table
placed in front of the window of the room occupied by the
family. The cause of death was consumption of the brain.
From the state of the atmosphere in which the child was
born, it was unhealthy. Another child had died from the
same cause. He thought the local authority ought to provide a mortuary, and also a room in which post-mortem
examinations could be conducted. A verdict in accordance
with the medical evidence was returned by the jury, who
further expressed their opinion that the want of a mortuary
was calculated to be detrimental to the health of the persons
living in the district; that there being no mortuary was a
disgrace to the local authority; and that the circumstances
surrounding the case they had investigated were a disgrace
to this enlightened age.</q></p>
<p>I will not add a word. I leave the newspaper report to
arouse whatever thoughts it may in the minds of those who
will peruse it. It is at least a revelation to many of <q>How
the Poor Live.</q></p>
<p>Let me hark back again to the lighter side of my subject.
I began the chapter with a story of the self-sacrifice of the
poor. I will now end it with a little incident of which I
was an eye-witness this week. Some poor children of the
slums had <soCalled>a day in the country given them</soCalled> by a friend,
at which I had the privilege of being present.</p>
<p>At tea, to every little one there were given two large slices
of cake; I noticed one little boy take his, break a little
piece off, eat it, and quietly secrete the remainder in his
jacket pocket. Curious, and half suspecting what his intention was, I followed the lad when tea was over, to the fields.
<p><q>Eaten your cake yet ?</q> I said.</p>
<p><q>No, sir,</q> he answered, colouring as though he had
done something wrong.</p><pb id="p.56" n="56">
<p><q>What are you going to do with it ?</q></p>
<p><q>Please sir,</q> he stammered, <q>I'm goin' to take it'ome to
mother. She's ill and can't eat nothink, and I thought as
she might manage cake, sir.</q></p>
<p>In the train that brought those youngsters down came one
white-faced child, who looked faint and ill with the walk to
the station.</p>
<p>The head teacher, who has the history of child at her
fingers' end, saw what was the matter.</p>
<p><q>Had no breakfast to-day, Annie ? </q></p>
<p><q>No, ma'am,</q> was the faltering reply.</p>
<p>There was a crowd of poor mothers at the station come
to see the children off. One went out and presently returned
with a penny, which she pressed into the child's hand-to
buy herself something with. The woman had pawned her
shawl for a copper or two in sheer womanly sympathy.
Had she had the money about her she needn't have left
the station.</p>
<p>There was a good deal of pawning that morning, I know,
from an eye-witness, and all to give the little children a
copper or two to spend.</p>
<p>And what a struggle there had been to get them something
decent to wear for that grand day out! If all the
stories were written that could be told of the privations and
sacrifices endured by mothers, that Sally and Jane and Will
might look respectable at the treat, your heart would ache.
As I don't wish it to, we will not go into the matter.</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" id="c.12" n="12">
<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<p>To get an odd job at the Docks is often the last hope
of the labouring men who are out of regular employment,
and to whom the acquisition of a few shillings for rent, and
the means of subsistence for themselves and families, is a
task fraught with as much difficulty as were some of the
labours, the accomplishment of which added in no inconsiderable degree to the posthumous fame of Hercules.</p>
<p>When it is borne in mind that sometimes at the West
India Docks-taking one for example-as many as 2,500
hands can be taken on in the morning, it will be easily
understood that the chance of employment draws an immense
concourse of men daily to the gates.</p>
<p>The time to see what I venture to think is one of the
most remarkable sights in the world, is an hour at which the
general public is not likely to be passing by.</p>
<p>Sometimes the hands are engaged as early as four, but it
is generally about six o'clock that the quay-gangers ascend
the rostrums or elevated stands which are placed all along
the outside wall, and survey the huge crowd in front of
them, and commence to call them out for work and
send them into the different docks where the good ships
lie, with their vast cargoes, waiting for willing hands to
unload them.</p>
<p>The pay is fivepence an hour, and the day's work lasts for
eight hours. It is miscellaneous, and a man is expected





<figure></>Some of them have tramped all night, and flung themselves
down to sleep at the great dock gates in the early dawn,
determined to be in the front rank.</p>
<p>They are of all sorts, sizes, and conditions. Among them
is the seedy clerk, the broken-down betting-man, the discharged soldier, the dismissed policeman, the ticket-of-leave
man, the Jack-of-all-trades, the countryman, and the London
rough. An enormous proportion of the regular men are
Irish and of the ordinary labouring class, but now and then
a foreigner or a nero crops up among the crowd. One
man there is among them who wears his rough jacket and
his old battered billycock with a certain air of gentility, and
whose features are strangely refined when compared with the
coarser lineaments of those around him.</p>
<p>In the Docks they call him <soCalled>the nobleman.</soCalled> He is a
gentleman by birth and education; he can swear, I believe,
in four languages; and as a matter of fact is the son of a <pb id="p.58" n="58"><p><figure><head>"All Sorts and Conditions of Men"</></figure><pb id="p.59" n="59">

baronet, and has a right to be called <q>sir</q> if he chose to
demand it. Into the sad story which has brought about this
social wreck it is no business of mine to enter, though to the
friendly Dock police and to the gangers the baronet is ready
enough to tell it.</p>
<p>The baronet can work, in spite of his pedigree, as well as
any of his mates, and the fivepence an hour is a god-send to
him. Strange are the stories of vicissitude which many of
these men can tell. I have said it is the last haven of the
outcast, and by that I do not mean to imply that all dock
labourers are destitute, but that among the huge crowd of
outsiders who come daily to take their chance are many of
those who form the absolutely most helpless and most hopeless of the London poor. No character is required for the
work, no questions are asked; a man can call himself any
name he likes: so long as he has two hands and is willing to
use them, that is all the Dock Company require. Among
these men are hundreds of those whose cases are so
difficult to deal with in respect of house accommodation. <figure><Head>Dock Messenger</></figure>
They are the men who have to pay exorbitant rents for the
filthy single rooms of the slums, and whose fight with
starvation is daily and hourly. They are the men earning
precarious livelihoods who are objected to by the managers
of all the new Industrial Dwellings, which have swept away
acres of accommodation of an inferior class. A man who is
a Dock labourer may earn a pound a week-he may earn
only five shillings. Sometimes they get taken on every day
in a week, and then for a fortnight they may have to go
empty-handed from the gates day after day.</p>
<p>Once fix on your mind the wear and tear, the anxiety and
doubt, the strain and harass, the ups and downs of a life like
this, count the smallness of the gain and the uncertainty of
employment, and you will understand why it is that the
common body of men who are classed as <soCalled> Dock labourers </soCalled>
are reckoned as among the poorest of the London poor
who make an honest effort to keep out of the workhouse.
Watch this crowd-there must be over two thousand present
in the great outer circle. The gangers are getting into the
rostrums-two tea ships have come in, and a large number
of men will be required. Hope is on many faces now; the
men who have been lying in hundreds sleeping on the bank
opposite-so usual a bed that the grass is worn away-leap
to their feet. The crowd surges close together, and every
eye is fixed in the direction of the ganger, who, up in his
pulpit, his big book with the list of the names of regular
men, or <soCalled>Royals,</soCalled> open before him, surveys the scene and
prepares for business. He calls out name after name, the
men go up and take a pass, present it to the police at the
gate, and file in to be told off to the different vessels. It is
when the <soCalled>Royals </soCalled> are exhausted that the real excitement
begins. The men who are left are over a thousand strong
-they have come on the chance. The ganger eyes them
with a quick, searching glance, then points his finger to
them, <q>You-and you-and you-and you.</q> The extra
men go through the usual formality and pass in. There is
still hope for hundreds of them. The ganger keeps on
engaging men-but presently he stops.</p>
<p>You can almost hear a sigh run through the ragged crowd.
There comes into some of the pale, pinched faces a look of
unutterable woe-the hope that welled up in the heart has
sunk back again. There is no chance now. All the
men wanted are engaged.</p>
<p>As you turn and look at these men and study them, these
the unfortunate ones, you picture to yourself what the
situation means to some of them. What are their thoughts
as they turn away? Some of them perhaps have grown
callous to suffering, hardened in despair. To-day's story is
but the story of yesterday and will be the story of to-morrow.
There is on many of their faces that look of vacant unconcern to everything that comes of long familiarity with
adversity. They have the look of the man who came into
the French Court of Justice to take his trial for murdering
his colleague at the galleys, and who had branded on his
arm his name. <soCalled> Never a chance.</soCalled> Never a chance when
a man gets that branded not on his arm but on his heart;
he takes bad luck very quietly. It is the good luck which
would astonish and upset him.</p>
<p>Some of the men, new comers most of these, and not used
to the game yet, show a certain rough emotion. It is fair
to say it generally takes the form of an expletive. Others,
men who look as though they had sunk by degrees from
better positions, go away with a quivering lip and a flush of
disappointment. If we could follow the thoughts of some
of them, we should see far away and perhaps where in some
wretched room a wife and children sit cowering and shivering, waiting for the evening to come, when father will bring
back the price of the day's work he has gone to seek. It
must be with a heavy heart that his wife towards midday
hears the sound of her husband's footsteps on the creaking
stairs. This advent means no joy to her. That footstep
tells its sad, cruel tale in one single creak. He has not
been taken on at the Docks-another weary day of despair
has to be sat through, another night she and the little ones
must go hungry to bed.</p>
<p>It must not be imagined that the men clear away directly
who have not been engaged. Hope springs eternal in the
human breast, and dozens of men still wait on in hope. It
sometimes happens that a ship comes in late, or something
happens, and more men are required. Then the ganger
comes out and picks them from among the remaining crowd.</p>
<p>Dozens of them hang about on the off-chance until two;
after that it rarely happens any men are engaged, so the last
brave few who have stood with wistful eyes for six or eight
hours at the gate, turn slowly on their heels and go-God
knows where.</p>
<p>Some of them, I believe, are absolutely homeless and
friendless, and hang about street corners, getting perhaps a
bit of tobacco from one or another more fortunate in this
world's goods than themselves, and with it stave off the
gnawing pangs of hunger. They hang about up side streets
and round corners till night comes, then fling themselves
down and sleep where they can, and go back once more at
dawn to the gates of their paradise, to wait and hope, and
be disappointed perhaps again.
<p>This is the dark side of the Dock labourer's story. It
has a brighter and better one inside, where on miles and
miles of wharf hundreds of men, package and bale-laden,
are hurrying to and fro, stowing the produce of the world in <pb id="p.60" n="60">
shed after shed. Thousands of barrels of sugar are lying
in one, and the air is perfectly sweet with it. The ground
is treacly with it, and one's boots are saturated with it as one
walks through a thick slime of what looks toffee gone wrong
in a sweetstuff window on a hot summer day. Thousands
of boxes of tea, just in from China are in another shed
and their next door neighbours are myriads of bags of
wheat. The steam cranes are going as far as the eye can
see, whirling, and dragging, and swinging huge bale after
bale greedily from the good ship's hold; lighters laden to
the top are being piled higher still; whole regiments of men
bent with precious burthens are filing from wharf to warehouse; the iron wheels of the trolley, as it is pushed rapidly
over the asphalted floor, makes a music of its own; and the
whole scene shut in with a background of shipping-argosies
freighted with the wealth of the Indies, the produce of
many a land beyond the seas ;-all this goes to make up a
picture of industry and enterprise and wealth, which gives
just a little pardonable pride to the Englishman who
contemplates it for the first time.</p>
<p>The system in the Docks is admirable. The strange men
who are taken on are not taken entirely on trust. There is a
uniform scale of pay for old hands and new, but there is an
overlooker to see that all work well. If a man shirks or
makes himself in any way objectionable, the process is short
and summary: <q>Go to the office and take your money.</q>
The man is discharged-he is paid for the time he has
worked, but no more; and he can leave the Docks out of
the question as a field for his talents, if he has shown
himself a duffer. A mark is put against his name in the
ganger's book.</p>
<p>At the door every man who leaves the Docks is searched.
This is more of a preventive measure than anything else.
The men handle many packages of valuable commodities
which have been broken in transit, and could easily extract
some for their private use.</p>
<p>It would not be hard for a gentleman brought face to
face with a broken chest of tea to fill his pockets with a
loose pound or two, for instance. The search at the gate
stops that. Knowing that detection is certain, those men
who would be dishonest if they could get a chance see the
impossibility of escaping with their plunder, and so, making
a virtue of necessity, respect the eighth commandment.
The Docks are in the custody of a special body of Dock
police, who maintain order, keep guard night and day over
the goods in the warehouse, search the men, and check all
the carts and vans passing out or in at the gates, and are
generally responsible for everything.</p>
<p>The boys employed as messengers between the Dock
House in Billiter Street and the Docks themselves, and also
the lads employed on the spot, are all dressed in a remarkably neat uniform, and add to the picturesqueness of the
busy scene. All these boys are drilled, and come to attention
and salute their superiors with the precision of old soldiers.
I have given a little space to the inside of the Docks
because such numbers of the men whose homes we have
visited in previous chapters are employed there, and it is
there that unskilled labour finds the readiest market.
But it is outside that one must search for the misery
which those who know them best acknowledge to be the
commonest lot of the Dock labourer.</p>
<p>Inside, when the men are at work, the beer barrel on
a stand with wheels is trundled merrily along at certain
hours, and there is a contractor who supplies the men with
food. It is outside that the beer barrel and the food
contractor find their occupation gone.</p>
<p>Poverty in its grimest form exists here, and it is for these
men, struggling so bravely and waiting so patiently for the
work their hands are only too willing to do, that philanthropists might look a little more earnestly into the question
of house accommodation.</p>
<p>Looking at the uncertainty of employment, it is not hard
for any one to see that a rent of five shillings for a single
room is too much for these men to pay, and they cannot go
out into the suburbs, where rents are cheaper, because they
could not get to the Docks in anything like condition to
work.</p>
<p>These men must live within a reasonable distance of their
labour, and to do so they have to pay exorbitant prices for
vile accommodation. They are kept in the lowest depths of <pb id="p.61" n="61">
poverty, because rent almost exhausts all the money-all
that the luckiest can hope to earn.</p>
<p> <q>Honest sweat,</q> the poet has told us, is a very noble
decoration to a man's brow, and these men are plentifully
decorated before their task is over, I can assure you. It is
scandalous that having done all they can, risked life and
limb (for dock accidents are numerous and keep a hospital
busy), and done their duty in that state of life to which it
has pleased God to call them, they should have to creep
home to fever dens and pestilential cellars-half the money
they pay ought to go for food for themselves and their
children, instead of into the well-lined pockets of those
who are making fortunes out of the death-traps they call
<soCalled>House Property.</soCalled></p>
<p>This short and hurried sketch of life in the Docks is
necessarily incomplete. Its one great feature connected
with the subject of these articles my readers can see for
themselves at any time they like to take a long walk in the
very earlymorning. No one who does not see the vast
crowd can appreciate the character and pathetic elements it
contains. I cannot write them with my pen, nor can my
collaborator draw them with his pencil.</p>
<p>But we can both of us gratefully acknowledge our indebtedness to Mr. A. T. A. Brownlow, of the London Offices,
and Captain Sheppy, of the Dock Police, whose kindness
enabled us to see under peculiar advantages this phase of
<q>HOW THE POOR LIVE.</q> </p></div1>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<p>WITH the present chapter I bring this series of Papers to
a close. I have endeavoured briefly to present to the reader
a few of the phases of existence through which their poorer
brethren pass. I have necessarily left untrodden whole
acres of ground over which a traveller in search of startling
revelations might with advantage have journeyed. But
startling revelations were not the objects I and my collaborator had in view when we undertook these sketches.
Our object was to skim the surface lightly, but sufficiently
to awaken in the general mind an interest in one of the
great social problems of the day. A few of the evils of the
present system of overcrowding and neglected sanitation,
I have the courage to believe, have been brought home for
the first time to a world of readers outside the hitherto
narrow circle of philanthropists who take an active interest
in the social condition of the masses.<p>
<p>One word with regard to the many letters which have
appeared in the Pictorial World, and which have reached us
privately. There seems a very general and a very earnest
desire among the writers to do something for the people
on whose behalf we have appealed to their sympathy.</p>
<p>While fully appreciating the kind-heartedness and the
generous feelings evoked, I cannot help regretting that in
too many instances the idea prevails that charity can
ameliorate the evils complained of. I have been grievously
misunderstood if anything I have said has led to the belief
that all Englishmen have to do to help the denizens of the
slums and alleys is to put their hands in and pull out a
sovereign or a shilling.</p>
<p>It is legislation that is wanted, not almsgiving. It is not
a temporary relief, but a permanent one, that can alone
affect, in any appreciable manner, the condition of the
one-roomed portion of the population of great cities.</p>
<p>Charity is to be honoured wherever it is found, but
charity unless accompanied by something else, may do
more evil than good. There are in London scores and
scores of men and women who live by getting up bogus
charities and sham schemes for the relief of the poor.
Hundreds of thousands of pounds pass annually through
the hands of men whose antecedents, were they known, would
make a careful householder nervous about asking them into
his hall if there were any coats and umbrellas about.</p>
<p>I am not a thick and thin supporter of the C.O.S. At
various times I have been bitterly opposed, both to its
theories and its practices; but it certainly has done an
immense deal of good in exposing some of the scoundrels
who appeal to the best sympathies of human nature under
absolutely false pretences.</p>
<p>It is not so long ago that a man who had been convicted
of fraud was found the flourishing proprietor of a mission to
the poo.r, or something of the sort, and whose annual income
for two years past had been over a couple of thousand
pounds, against an expenditure in tracts, rent, and blankets
of one hundred and thirty-six pounds.</p>
<p>In another instance, the promoter of a charity which had
been in a flourishing condition for years, actually had his
villa at St. John's Wood, and kept his brougham-his total
source of income being the charity itself.</p>
<p>If I quote these cases here it is not to hinder the flow of
the broad, pure stream of charity by one single obstacle, but
to show such of my readers as may need the hint how
dangerous and delusive it is to think that careless alms-giving is in any shape or form a real assistance to the poor
and suffering.</p>
<p>People who wish to do good must give their time as well
as their money. They must personally investigate all those
cases they wish to relieve, and they must set about seeing
how the causes which lead to misery and suffering can be
removed.</p>
<p>How are the evils of overcrowding-how are the present
miseries of the poor to be removed-in what way can the
social status of the labouring classes be permanently raised?
Not by collecting-cards or funds, not by tracts or missions,
but by remedial legislation-by State help and State protection, and by the general recognition of those rights of
citizenship which should be as carefully guarded for the
lowest class as for the highest.</p>
<p>We live in a country which practically protects the poor
and oppressed of every land under the sun at the expense of
its own. We organise great military expeditions, we pour
out blood and money ab libitum in order to raise the social
condition of black men and brown-the woes of an Egyptian,
or a Bulgarian, or a Zulu, send a thrill of indignation through <pb id="p.62" n="62"><p><figure><head>A Sketch from Life</></figure><pb id="p.63" n="63">
honest John Bull's veins; and yet at his very door there is
a race so oppressed, so hampered, and so utterly neglected
that its condition has become a national scandal. </p>
<p>Is it not time that the long-promised era of domestic
legislation gave some faint streaks of dawn in the parliamentary sky ? Are we to wait for a revolution before we
rescue the poor from the clutches of their oppressors? are
we to wait for the cholera or the plague before we remedy
a condition of things which sanitarily is without parallel
in civilised countries ?</p>
<p>There is a penalty for packing cattle too closely together;
why should there be none for improperly packing men and
women and children? The law says that no child shall
grow up without reading, writing, and arithmetic; but the
law does nothing that children may have air, and light, and
shelter.</p>
<p>No one urges that the State should be a grandmother to
the citizens, but it should certainly exercise ordinary parental
care over its family.</p>
<p>To quote an instance of the gross neglect of the interests
of the poor by the State, take the working of the Artisans'
Dwelling Act. Space after space has been cleared under
the provision of this Act, thousands upon thousands of
families have been rendered homeless by the demolition of
whole acres of the slums where they hid their heads, and
in scores of instances the work of improvement has stopped
with the pulling down. To this day the cleared spaces stand
empty-a cemetery for cats, a last resting-place for worn-out
boots and tea-kettles. The consequence of this is, that the
hardships of the displaced families have been increased a
hundredfold. So limited is now the accommodation for the
class whose wage-earning power is of the smallest, that in
the few quarters left open to them, rents have gone up 100
per cent. in five years-a room which once let for 2s. a week
is now 4s. Worse even than this, the limited accommodation has left the renters helpless victims of any extortion
or neglect the landlords of these places may choose to
practise.</p>
<p>The tenants cannot now ask for repairs, for a decent
water supply, or for the slightest boon in the way of
improvement. They must put up with dirt, and filth, and
putrefaction-with dripping walls and broken windows, with
all the nameless abominations of an unsanitary hovel,
because if they complain the landlord can turn them out
at once, and find dozens of people eager to take their
places who will be less fastidious. It is Hobson's choice-that shelter or none-and it is small wonder that few families
are stoical enough to move from a death-trap to a ditch
or a doorstep for the sake of a little fresh air. The law
which allows them the death-trap denies them the doorstep
-that is a property which must not be overcrowded.</p>
<p>Now, is it too much to ask that in the intervals of civilizing
the Zulu and improving the condition of the Egyptian
fellah the Government will turn its attention to the poor of
London and see if in its wisdom it cannot devise a scheme
to remedy this terrible state of things ?
The social, moral, and physical improvement of the
labouring classes is surely a question as important
say as the condition of the traffic at Hyde Park Corner;
or the disfigurement of the Thames Embankment. If
one-tenth of the indignation which burst forth when a
ventilator ventured to emit a puff of smoke on the great
riverside promenade to the injury of the geraniums in..
Temple Gardens could only be aroused over the wholesale
stifling and poisoning of the poor which now goes on all
over London, the first step towards a better state of things.
would have been taken.</p>
<p>Why does that indignation find no stronger outlet than
an occasional whisper, a nod of the head, a stray leading
article, or a casual question in the House sandwiched
between an inquiry concerning the Duke of Wellington's
statue and one about the cost of cabbage-seed for the
kitchen-garden at Buckingham Palace ?</p>
<p>The answer probably will be, that up to a recent date the
magnitude of the evil has not been brought home to the
general public or the members of the legislature. M.P.'s
do not drive through'the Mint or Whitechapel, nor do they
take their constitutional in the back slums of Westminster
and Drury Lane. What the eye does not see the heart
does not grieve after, and the conservative spirit born and
bred in Englishmen makes them loth to start a crusade against
any system of wrong until its victims have begun to start a
crusade of their own, to demonstrate in Trafalgar Square, and
to hold meetings in Hyde Park. There is a disposition in this
country not to know that a dog is hungry till it growls, and
it is only when it goes from growling to snarling, and from
snarling to sniffing viciously in the vicinity of somebody's
leg, that the somebody thinks it time to send out a flag of
truce in the shape of a bone. We don't want to wait until
the dog shows its teeth to know that he has such things.
We want the bone to be offered now-a good marrowy
bone with plenty of legislative meat upon it. He has been
a good, patient, long-suffering dog, chained to a filthy
kennel for years, and denied even a drink of clean water,
let alone a bone, so that the tardy offering is at least
deserved.</p>
<p>It would be easy to show how the amelioration of the
condition of the lower classes would be beneficial to the
entire community, but it is scarcely worth while to put the
question on such low grounds. The boon craved should
come as an act of justice, not as a concession wrung from
unwilling hands by fear, or granted with interested motives.</p>
<p>Briefly, and narrowing the question down to its smallest
dimensions, what is wanted is this. The immediate erection
on cleared spaces of tenements suitable to the classes dislodged. A system of inspection which would not only
cause the demolition of unhealthy houses, but prevent unhealthy houses being erected-a certain space should be
insisted on for every human being inhabiting a room-say
300 cubic feet for each person, and this regulation should
be enforced by inspection of labouring-class dwellings, the
enforcement of proper sanitary regulations, and a higher
penalty for any breach of them; the providing of increased
bath and washing accommodation in every crowded district;
the erection of proper mortuaries in every parish, and the
preservation in every district of certain open spaces to act
as lungs to the neighbourhood--all these should be items
in any remedial scheme. Beyond this, the poor should be <pb id="p.64" n="64">
encouraged in every possible way to decentralise. They
must at present all crowd round the big centres of employment, because the means of travelling to and fro are
beyond the reach of their slender purses. But if a system
of cheap conveyance by tram or rail for the working-classes
could be developed, they would scatter themselves more and
more about the suburbs, and by their own action reduce
the exorbitant rents they are now called upon to pay.</p>
<p>Again, there should be in all new blocks of tenements
built for this class accommodation for the hawkers and
others who have barrows which they must put somewhere,
and who are compelled at times to house the vegetable and
animal matter in which they deal. A man who sells cabbages
in the streets cannot leave his unsold stock to take care of
itself at night, so he takes it home with him. At present he
and his family generally sleep on it in their one room, but
lock-up sheds and stabling for donkeys and ponies would
obviate all the evils of the present system. The men are
quite willing to pay for a little extra accommodation, and
the removal of the mischief which comes of whole areas
polluted with decaying vegetable matter is at least worth an
experiment.</p>
<p>The density of the population in certain districts, and
the sanitary defects of the tenements, are at present absolute
dangers to the Public Health. On this ground alone it is
desirable to agitate for reform; but there is a broader
ground still-humanity. It is on that broadground I venture to ask those who by these scant sketches of a great evil
have become in some slight way acquainted with it, to raise
their voices and give strength to the cry which is going up
at last for a rigid and searching inquiry into the conditions
under which the Poor of this vast city live.</p>
<p>To leave the world a little better than he found it, is the
best aim a man can have in life, and no labour earns so
sweet and so lasting a reward as that which has for its object
the happiness of others.
<p>Public opinion boldly expressed never fails to compel the
obedience of those who guide the destinies of states. Public
opinion is a chorus of voices, and the strength of that chorus
depends upon the manner in which each individual member
of it exerts his vocal power. How long the scandal which
disgraces the age shall continue depends greatly, therefore,
good reader, upon your individual exertions. If aught that
has been written or drawn here, then, has enlisted your
sympathy, pass from a recruit to a good soldier of the cause,
and help with all your will and all your strength to make so
sad a story as this impossible when in future years abler pen
and pencil than ours shall perhaps once again attempt to tell
you-</p>
<p><q>HOW THE POOR LIVE.</q></p>
<p>THE END.</p>
