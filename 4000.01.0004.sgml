  <p> EVERY one knows enough of the government of England to be
aware that, in name a monarchy, it is, in reality, a republic. The
Sovereign is a fact, but it is rather the idea than the fact of
sovereignty which dominates the English mind. British loyalty is
divided between a woman and an abstraction. The woman is the
Queen; the abstraction is the power she exercises.</p>
  <p>The thirty or forty millions of the inhabitants of the United
Kingdom accept the monarchy; have not the slightest wish to get rid of
it; honor the Monarch as their Church Catechism bids them do;
would reprobate any attacks upon the royal person; would resent
disrespectful language about her; would even risk their lives to
save hers. Yet of these millions, not one per cent.-not one in a
thousand-has ever seen the Queen, knows of her except from the
newspapers, has any notion of what she is like except from
pictures, or of the manner in which she passes her days. Imagine it
possible that the Queen should die and her death be kept a
profound secret; imagine that certain members of her household and
ministers of State conspired together to pretend that she continued
to live; imagine that the same announcements appeared as appear
now in the <title>Court Circular</title>; imagine finally that it were practicable

<pb n="4" id="p.4">

to perpetuate this delusion, and that the conspirators kept good
faith among themselves-imagine this to be the case, and all would
go on as it goes on now.</p>
<p>There are not five hundred of Her Majesty's subjects who need
or would suspect anything to be wrong. The inclemency of the
season, neuralgic pains always supervening on exposure to the air,
general debility, an insuperable indisposition to see or be seen by
any of her fellow-creatures-any of these pleas would be accepted,
provided that no suspicions were excited, as a perfectly reasonable
excuse for the <persName key="Queen of England">Queen of England</persName> being completely, as she is now
all but completely, invisible to the ordinary eye. Two or three
years ago there died a great English noble-the <persName key="Duke of Portland">Duke of Portland</persName>
-who had certainly not revealed himself to more than a score of
his relatives or retainers during the last two or three decades of his
existence. He had become a myth while he was still in the flesh.
Yet the proposition that he was alive never excited controversy,
and his estate was as well managed as if he himself issued daily
orders to his agents.</p>
  <p>The business of the English Empire would be conducted in the
same fashion, and might be conducted with nearly the same
ceremony, if the Sovereign were as far removed from the mundane
vision, from year's end to year's end, as she is from the vision of
all save an infinitesimal minority of those who gratefully confess
her supremacy. It is sometimes said that the English people are
impervious to ideas. Their attitude towards the throne and its
occupant shows that they are not. To the overwhelming mass of
the British nation, monarchy is an idea pure and simple-
intangible, impalpable-yet never a phantom, still less a chimera.</p>
 <p> But if monarchy is an idea in England, do not suppose that the
monarchy is a nullity. It is no paradox to say that the Monarch
is a reality because she is, to such an extent, an idea; that she has
power because she circumscribes it within such exiguous limits;
that her presence is worshipped because so few manifestations of
it are vouchsafed to the worshipper. Her existence is one constant
appeal to the imagination of the most imaginative people under the
sun. She constitutes the tiny bit of romance in the grimly prosaic
lives of tens of thousands. The masses who would probably be
organized to agitate and howl if the Queen were to assert any of
the powers which the law of the Constitution, by a series of
obsolete fictions, reposes in her, would immediately arouse a million

                            <pb n="5" id="p.5">

champions if any one in public were to speak lightly against her, or
so much as refuse to credit her with the sum of all feminine graces
and virtues.</p>
 <p> Again, the <persName key="Queen of England">Queen of England</persName>, notwithstanding that her strength
resides chiefly in her ideal aspect, is not a political nonentity,
because she is an exceedingly clever woman. And here let me offer
a word of advice and caution. In England one may sometimes
find one's self in the company of people who speak of the royal
family as if its members were, without an exception, stupid,
ignorant, wrong-headed, maladroit, and dull. That is the way of the
more vulgar Britons. They detract their royalties as they
calumniate their climate. The truth is, the reigning family in England
is remarkable for its extreme ability, its skilfulness in dealing with
situations and with men or women, its rapid and accurate
perception, its intuitive savoir-faire. The <persName key="Crown Princess of Germany">Crown Princess of Germany</persName> is,
we all know, one of the most gifted ladies in Europe, and only a
woman of the highest calibre could have held her own, as she has
done in private and public matters, against <persName key="Bismarck">Bismarck</persName>, or have
suggested herself to him as an obstacle in the path of his policy with
which he must reckon.</p>
  <p>Perhaps I may be asked for a proof of the talents with which I
have credited the <persName key="Queen of England">Queen of England</persName>. I reply, look at the facts.
She became a sovereign forty-eight years ago; she remains a
sovereign still; the foundation of her throne is deeper and firmer than
ever. Is not this enough? What would you more? There is a
proverb which tells us that if it needs a clever man to make a
fortune, it needs a cleverer man to keep it. Depend upon it that the
Sovereign who, when her reign is well-nigh half a century old, has
absolutely nothing to fear from any hostile movement, is a very
remarkable woman indeed.</p>
 <p> The Queen's year is divided between a Scotch chateau, a feudal
mansion in the suburbs-the stateliest building perhaps of its kind
in Europe-and a country house close to a fashionable yachting
resort. At <placeName key="Balmoral">Balmoral</placeName> she lives as much as possible in the open air,
reading State documents and being read to by her ladies during the
summer in a tent; at <placeName key="Windsor">Windsor</placeName>, and as <placeName key="Windsor">Windsor</placeName> is only some twenty
miles from <placeName key="London ">London </placeName>it may be called a suburb, and at Osborne she
leads the existence of an august recluse, the solitude and monotony
of which are only broken by frequent State visits and more
unfrequent State ceremonials.</p>
<pb n="6" id="p.6">

  <p>The constitutional functions of sovereignty may be dismissed in
a sentence. <persName key="The Queen">The Queen</persName> signs documents and suggests or vetoes
the appointment of bishops-that.is about all. Yet there is an
indirect influence which she exercises on affairs, and, if she does
not check the advance of events for long, she may raise difficulties
in the way of their progress, or, on the other hand, may help their
despatch. The English Premier would find his position much
lighter if he could forego his daily letter to Her Majesty when
Parliament is in session, and if, in other matters, he were not
obliged to observe the formality of consulting the royal will.</p>
 <p> Having vast experience, the Queen has some of the authority
which it confers. So recently as the autumn of last year that
authority was exercised. The two chambers of the legislature were
in collision about parliamentary reform. The Queen summoned
to her perhaps the only public man with whom she may be now
described as on terms of personal friendship-the <persName key="Duke of
Richmond">Duke of
Richmond</persName>. Formerly Her Majesty regarded with exceptional favor
and confidence <persName key="Lord Carnarvon">Lord Carnarvon</persName>, but he fell from the royal grace,
never completely to be restored, when he quarrelled with <persName key="Lord
Beaconsfield">Lord
Beaconsfield</persName>. <persName key="The Queen">The Queen</persName>, I say, sent for the <persName key="Duke of Richmond">Duke of Richmond</persName>,
exhorted him to close the feud between the two parties and the two
Houses, and plainly said that upon any terms the matter must be
arranged. What followed? The Duke communicated the will of
his royal mistress to <persName key="Lord Salisbury">Lord Salisbury</persName>, and the incident was at an
end.</p>
  <p>With the exception of the <persName key="Duke of Richmond">Duke of Richmond</persName>, the Queen has
among the statesmen of her epoch no personal friends who would
dare plainly to express their opinion to Her Majesty. <persName key="Lord
Beaconsfield">Lord
Beaconsfield</persName>, who by his adroitness, patient courtiership, unbounded
and extravagant adulation, had completely overcome the royal
prejudices against him, which at one time seemed insuperable, and who
had won the heart and trust of his sovereign, was the last minister
who fully enjoyed the royal favor. <persName key="Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone">Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone</persName>
periodically visit Her Majesty, but the personal relations between
the Sovereign and her Premier are of a tepid kind, and have been
known to be actually strained and chilly. The position of the
Queen is solitary-nay, sad. If the late <persName key="Brown, John">John Brown</persName> was mourned
so deeply by Her Majesty, and missed so much, it was because he
had acquired by long years of faithful service some of its privileges
-because Her Majesty knew that she could trust his judgment and
                     <pb n="7" id="p.7">

counsel. Few are the friendships which royalty can allow itself,
and the attendant of the Queen of England who died some three
years ago was not a menial, but a friend. With <persName key="Sir Henry Ponsonby">Sir Henry Ponsonby</persName>
her relations are those of personal cordiality, but still formal and
official. The three most intimate friends of her own sex possessed
by the Queen are tile <persName key="Dowager Duchess of Roxburghe">Dowager Duchess of Roxburghe</persName>, <persName key="Lady Ely">Lady Ely</persName>,
and <persName key="Lady Churchill">Lady Churchill</persName>, none of them remarkable for cleverness, tact,
or social talent, but each habituated to the ways and attached to
the person of the Sovereign.</p>
 <p> The lot of the maids of honor is far from easy. The demand
upon their physical strength and patience is continuous. They
must always be within call, and as <persName key="Her Majesty">Her Majesty</persName> seldom or never
reads a newspaper with her own eyes, neither their eyes nor their
voice must ever tire. Do the hardships of their position, it may be
asked, end here? Not perhaps exactly. Crowned womanhood is
no exception to the general law of womanhood, and, kindly though
her heart may be, the Queen has the capriciousness of her exalted
station and her sex. <persName key="Lady Ely">Lady Ely</persName>-a woman with the most
affectionate manner in the world; all tenderness and sympathetic interest in
those with whom she is brought into contact-has no more
disagreeable duty to fulfil than that, not seldom imposed upon her, of
telling some lady of the Court that her presence has become
burdensome to Her Majesty, and that she must go. The Queen likes
young people about her, and has few favorites past middle age.
Within the last few years two ladies whom the Queen had received
into her service with open arms have been dismissed
suddenlyone because the Sovereign had wearied of her, the other because
she had proved physically unequal to the labor of the position.</p>
  <p>How speeds daily life beneath the royal roof? Much in this
fashion. The Queen takes her meals-breakfasts and lunches-in
her apartments alone. The ladies of the Court have a sitting-room
and dining-room appropriated to themselves, and at <placeName key="Balmoral">Balmoral</placeName> the
dimensions of these are of the most modest kind, the entire space
occupied by the castle being so limited that the Queen's ministers
in attendance are requested not to bring a private secretary with
them, and are compelled to transact all their business and
correspondence in their bedchamber.</p>
 <p> The royal dinner-hour is nine o'clock, and at five minutes to nine
the Queen, if she has company, enters the room in which the guests
are assembled, and then, as the hour strikes, leads the way to the
<pb n="8" id="p.8">

banquet. Royal dinner-parties have one great advantage-they are
very short. Soon after ten the diners are once more in the salon or
corridor of reception, the Queen addresses each in succession for a
few minutes, and before eleven the function is at an end. What
impresses those who have had the honor of conversation with Her
Majesty most is the singularly minute acquaintance which she
possesses of the character and the career, the fortune and the families,
of her most distinguished subjects. In the army she takes the
keenest interest, and exercises in many methods her personal
initiative and command. <persName key="Valentine Baker Pacha">Valentine Baker Pacha</persName>, now in the
Egyptian service, and formerly colonel of a hussar regiment, would have
been restored to his original rank in the British army but for the
hostile intervention of the Sovereign. More lately the Queen gave
instructions that a lady of title, guilty of a literary indiscretion,
should be forbidden to attend the royal drawing-rooms of the
London season.</p>
 <p> When the Queen makes her influence felt in the restricted sphere
of activity which still remains open to her, she generally does so in
a way that most of her subjects would approve. A few failings,
some feminine, some royal, apart, the Queen is a fair embodiment
and reflection of English common-sense, accurately understanding
in the main the genius of her people and the currents of popular
feeling; well knowing that princes are loved and esteemed in
proportion as they show themselves to be human, and that the
autobiographical volumes, contemptible though, as literary productions,
they are, which she has from time to time given to the public, or
the messages which she addresses to the people when any great
event occurs-a railway accident or a battle-perceptibly strengthen
the foundations on which the structure of monarchy rests. And
perhaps Englishmen and Englishwomen of the middle or the lower
class like their Sovereign none the less because so many of her
tastes are identical with their own. <persName key="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</persName> has not only
the true German love for pageants and ceremonials of State,
uniforms, trappings, shows, and functions of all kinds, but the passion
distinctive of the English proletariat for funerals and for whatever
is associated with the sepulchre. It is morbid, but what will you?
There is nothing which fascinates the British workman and his
wife so much as the business of the undertaker. The crowning
ambition in the laborer's life is a handsome funeral. Coffins,
shrouds, hearses, and nodding plumes delight him. He and his
                                    <pb n="9" id="p.9">

wife are enthusiastic over what they will call a beautiful corpse.
These peculiarities are illustrated by the Queen on a becoming
scale. There is a bliss in tears, and to English royalty there is a
pleasure, nay, a rapture, in the pomp and apparatus of mortality.</p>
  <p>The Queen's youngest daughter, the <persName key="Princess Beatrice">Princess Beatrice</persName>, now about
to be married to <persName key="Prince Henry of Battenberg">Prince Henry of Battenberg</persName>, has been for years
her mother's constant companion, and will see a good deal of Her
Majesty in the future. The English mind has been, unconsciously
it may be, impressed by the spectacle of the Queen and the Princess,
by the contrast it suggests, and by the tender thoughtfulness shown,
without failure and without stint, by the girl to the woman. To
Her Royal Highness life, varied though the domestic routine of
Court has been by attendance at flower-shows, bazaars, and fetes,
has proved perhaps a trifle monotonous. It was necessary to do
something, and four years ago the Princess determined to change
her state, and privately betrothed herself to the handsome scion of
Prussian royalty. The secret was well kept. When the <persName key="Princess
Beatrice">Princess
Beatrice</persName> breathed it into the ears of her royal mother a little storm
broke. It did not last long, but while it lasted it was acute.
Everything is now arranged. The formal consent of the Sovereign
has been given, and though the match is not liked by any of the
royal family it is acquiesced in. The <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</persName> may wish it
were otherwise, and in that desire, if it be his desire, he is
influenced less by personal sentiments than by his own idea of public
opinion. The English people, he knows, are averse to this indefinite
multiplication of petty German potentates, supported by English
money, dwelling under the shadow of royalty. Moreover His
Royal Highness is aware that the pretensions of these foreign
princes, the airs they give themselves, the knowledge especially of
military matters which they profess, are not acceptable to the
English gentry. As a question of taste, therefore, and policy, the
<persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</persName> does not encourage alliances of that sort. But he
is too sagacious to create any disturbance about it, and he will
receive <persName key="Prince Henry">Prince Henry</persName> as his brother-in-law much as he received
<persName key="Prince Christian">Prince Christian</persName> or the <persName key="Marquis of Lorne">Marquis of Lorne</persName>.</p>
 <p> <persName key="Prince Christian">Prince Christian</persName>, who married the third daughter of the
Sovereign, lives the life of an English country gentleman in a capital
house in <placeName key="Windsor Park">Windsor Park</placeName>-an amiable, domesticated,
philoprogenitive person; not brilliant, perhaps, yet not wanting in the quality
of practical shrewdness. Silly stories have been current about
<pb n="10" id="p.10">

him, such as that he had conceived before his marriage higher
matrimonial ambitions, and that he had previously rehearsed the
drama of domesticity elsewhere. These stories are fictions. <persName key="Prince
Christian">Prince
Christian</persName> is nothing more than he seems to be and what I have
described. There is no skeleton in his cupboard. He is a fair
shot, a kindly companion, hospitable, contented with his lot;
equally pleased whether some of his royal relatives come down to
shoot with him or whether he is shooting by himself. The <persName key="Princess
Christian">Princess
Christian</persName> takes an interest in charitable and beneficent institutions
of every kind: bazaars, asylums, schools, orphanages, and so forth.
She is the feminine equivalent of the Englishman who is a
professional chairman of public dinners and patron of eleemosynary
funds. She is the friend and colleague of <persName key="Mrs. Jeune">Mrs. Jeune</persName>, whose
acquaintance every visitor of distinction makes before he or she has
been in London many days.</p>
 <p> Let me preface my remarks on the <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</persName> with a few
brief comments on the other royalties. The <persName key="Princess Mary">Princess Mary</persName>, with
her ducal husband, <persName key="Prince Teck">Prince Teck</persName>, has quitted the English capital,
probably forever, and, as is well known, is now settled at
<placeName key="Florence">Florence</placeName>. She was always much liked in England. Teck, however,
was not a success. The <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</persName> and his people never took
kindly to him. They recognized in him something which the
English call bad form. His manner lacked the repose which
English taste demands. Physically by no means ill-looking--
indeed, almost handsome-and with a fine presence, he possessed by
nature and he acquired by art nothing of the grand manner. He
missed the due proportion of things, and showed an ignorance of
their fitness. He presumed upon his position with a curious
clumsiness. He was habitually late for appointments, and when he
apologized for his unpunctuality he did so in a manner which
aggravated the original offence. Then he was not always happy
in his conversation at dinner, contriving too often to say the wrong
thing to the wrong person. He himself said that he was never well
received in England. Whether his grievances were real or
imaginary, he paraded them too much. He went about complaining of
his treatment, and protesting, without the slightest provocation,
that he intended henceforth to look after himself. He was
supposed to be wanting in deference to his wife altogether; he rubbed
up the most fastidious and sensitive portion of English society the
wrong way. Nevertheless a good fellow.</p>
                                <pb n="11" id="p.11">

 <p> Of the <persName key="Princess Louise">Princess Louise</persName>, <persName key="Marchioness of Lorne">Marchioness of Lorne</persName>, and of the
<persName key="Marquis of Lorne">Marquis of Lorne</persName>, it is not possible to say much which is not known
already. His Lordship, though the heir to the ancient Scotch
dukedom of <placeName key="Argyll">Argyll</placeName>, was never made one of the family by his royal
brothers-in-law. It was regarded as a mesalliance. His
appointment to the Viceroyship of <placeName key="Canada">Canada</placeName> was a temporary release from a
position not merely difficult, but impracticable. He has now been
two years in England again, and he finds his path much smoother.
He is a gentleman of pleasant, picturesque appearance, thoroughly
courteous and kindly, of reflective habits, studious tastes, and no
mean intellectual endowments. The sense of novelty and
strangeness he experienced at being the Queen's son-in-law has worn off.
He has developed an independence of character, has resolved to
live his own life, reading much, writing a little, and generally
following the bent of his own excellent inclinations. The <persName key="Prince of
Wales">Prince of
Wales</persName> recognizes the propriety of his brother-in-law's course. The
<persName key="Marchioness of Lorne">Marchioness of Lorne</persName> has her own occupations, is a passable artist
and tolerable statuary. And so between them the pair have settled
down into a steady, respectable, refined, dignified existence. It
was their common wish that they should proceed to India as
Viceroy and Vicequeen after the retirement of <persName key="Lord Ripon">Lord Ripon</persName>; but there
were political objections to the step, and the force of these was
fully admitted by <persName key="Lord Lorne">Lord Lorne</persName> and the Princess.</p>
 <p> There are three other royal or semi-royal personages, of whom
everything that it is necessary to state may be summed up in half
a dozen sentences. Than <persName key="Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar">Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar</persName>, till the
other day <persName key="Governor of Portsmouth">Governor of Portsmouth</persName>, no more thoroughly excellent
or universally popular man has been ever known in England. A
capital officer, he was generosity itself as a host. Government
House at <placeName key="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</placeName> was always open in his time to every properly
accredited comer. Bright, cheery, acute, ingenious, resourceful,
assisted-nay, made-by his Princess, he won all hearts. His
local popularity expanded into a national popularity, and nothing
could be more acceptable to the English people than his promotion
to the military command of Ireland. <persName key="Count Gleichen">Count Gleichen</persName>, who married
a sister of the late <persName key="Lord Hertford">Lord Hertford</persName>, is a meritorious sculptor,
working at his art as if it were his only means of subsistence, and
receiving many valuable commissions. His studio is in <persName key="St. James's
Palace">St. James's
Palace</persName>, where he has a modest little establishment. To the majority
of Englishmen his existence is unknown, and in London society
<pb n="12" id="p.12">

he is seldom seen. He is the father of a clever and graceful
daughter-herself no mean sculptress-the <persName key="Countess Feodore">Countess Feodore</persName>. Of
<persName key="Prince Leiningen ">Prince Leiningen </persName>nothing more need be said than that he is a
commander of the Queen's yacht, that he has a pleasant presence, and
a short, quick, imperious manner.

The <persName key="Duke of Cambridge">Duke of Cambridge</persName>, the cousin of the Queen, is the visible
and permanent official head of the English army. A bluff, fresh,
hale country gentleman, somewhat past middle age, with
something of the vigorous, healthy frankness of the English skipper,
and something, too, of the Prussian martinet; industrious,
punctual, rising early, seeking rest late, fond of life and its pleasures,
of good dinners, good cigars, pleasant women, of the opera, of the
play, slightly given to slumber before dinner is well over, joyous,
cheery, still retaining traces of the ardor of youth-this is <persName key="His
Royal Highness George, Duke of Cambridge">His
Royal Highness George, Duke of Cambridge</persName>; a man of strong
feelings and stronger partialities, just by principle, yet liable to be
unjust by prejudice; honestly anxious to do the right thing, yet
frequently doing the wrong. His role is one of no small difficulty.
Constitutionally distrustful of reforms, he is compelled to accept
periodic revolutions.</p>
  <p>His day begins with exercise on horseback, then follow breakfast
and official papers at his house in <placeName key="Park Lane">Park Lane</placeName>; from two to seven,
and often later, he is at the <placeName key="Horse Guards">Horse Guards</placeName> in <placeName key="Pall Mall">Pall Mall</placeName>. If
necessary, he works again at night; if unnecessary, he dedicates the
evening to enjoyment. At least these royal dukes are not drones
in the hive.
</p>

<pb n="14" id="p.14">

  <p>His life is full of many stories. He has been engaged in many
affairs of the heart. He is a man of warm feeling and much loyalty
to those whom he loves; tempted to behave heartlessly, he has
uniformly comported himself honorably and well. He is to this
day the mature child of a passion that is never unprincipled. He
finds himself frequently in collision with the parliamentary head
of the army, the Secretary of State for Military Affairs, and with
the high officials of the War Office, Lord Wolseley, and his men.
He bears the vexations which cross his path with equanimity,
tempered or relieved by devotional ejaculations. The constitutional
spirit which has become part of the Queen's nature, and is as the
breath of his nostrils to the <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</persName>, dominates in the main
the <persName key="Duke of Cambridge">Duke of Cambridge</persName>. He acquiesces, because the Constitution
of the realm demands it, in much which he cordially detests. Yet,
if he believes in his heart that the army, in consequence of
newfangled innovations, is going to the dogs or the devil, he never says
so. He is, on the whole, a jovial optimist when he might have
been a morose pessimist. He has the facility of his family for
details. The dossier of every officer of any distinction in the army is
at his fingers' ends. His judgment of individuals is good. He lost
his head in the <placeName key="Crimea">Crimea</placeName>, but is an expert critic of tactics, and knows
how troops ought to be handled, whether at <placeName key="Aldershot">Aldershot</placeName> or in the
<placeName key="Soudan">Soudan</placeName>. He has an immense regard for and an exaggerated fear
of public opinion-especially when that opinion finds articulate
expression in print-and has before now given excellent counsel,
which has sometimes been obeyed, to the <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</persName>. Take
him for all in all, he is not only a favorable specimen of the house
of Hanover, but a good specimen of a man.</p>
 <p> It is usually supposed that the position which the <persName key="Duke of
Cambridge">Duke of
Cambridge</persName> occupies is reserved for the <persName key="Duke of Connaught">Duke of Connaught</persName>, who, with
the thoroughness and courage of his race, has set himself to learn
practically the duties of soldiering. As a cadet at <placeName key="Woolwich">Woolwich</placeName>, <persName key="Prince
Arthur">Prince
Arthur</persName> went through the curriculum of an officer of the <orgName key="Prince
Arthur">Royal
Engineers or Artillery</orgName>. If when he served in <placeName key="Egypt">Egypt</placeName> three years
ago he encountered no alarming amount of peril, that was not his
fault. In <placeName key="India">India</placeName> he has spared himself no labor. He shares his
brother's, the Prince of Wales's, accentuated devotion for the
minutiae of uniform, a devotion which they each of them inherit
from their father and mother. There is no better judge of a march
past than the Queen. No one has a quicker eye for buttons, epaulettes,
                                 <pb n="15" id="p.15">

 and sword-belts than the <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</persName>. The <persName key="Duke of
Connaught">Duke of
Connaught</persName> is not to be blamed if one of the articles of his faith is
military smartness. He is a good patriot and a good soldier. His
face, with its bronzed complexion, well-shaved chin, heavy
mustache, is that typical of the English or the German officer. He is
singularly modest and unaffected, anxious to learn, and when he
thinks he has mastered his lesson, and not before, confident. His
return to England is now anticipated with interest, and when he is
back you may be sure that he will commit no mistakes-at most
the minimum of mistakes permissible to a prince.</p>
  <p>The <persName key="Duke of Edinburgh">Duke of Edinburgh</persName> is a contrast to both his brothers, and is
less popular than he deserves to be. His wife, the daughter of the
late and the sister of the present Czar, never captivated the hearts
of the English people like her sister-in-law, the <persName key="Princess of Wales">Princess of Wales</persName>.
But it may be doubted whether there is room in England for two
such princesses. As the consort of the Heir-Apparent to the English
throne was in possession of the ground long before the <persName key="Duchess of
Edinburgh">Duchess of
Edinburgh</persName> had placed her foot upon the soil of Great Britain,
how should it not be unavoidable that both the <persName key="Duke and Duchess
of Edinburgh">Duke and Duchess
of Edinburgh</persName> should be eclipsed by the elder brother, upon whom
so many of the social and ceremonial duties of sovereignty had
already devolved?</p>
  <p>The <persName key="Duke of Edinburgh">Duke of Edinburgh</persName> is a clear-headed, astute, sagacious, and
careful man of business. His fortune is not in proportion to his
position, and his demands upon it are great. So, therefore, is the
necessity for thrift. Naturally this has laid him open to the
charge of parsimony; but he is not parsimonious, he is simply
wise. He does not throw his money away or cast pearls before
swine. But there is no real niggardliness about him, as those who
have stayed in his house or cruised with him in his ship know.
His manner, it may be admitted, is less charming, polished, and
conciliatory than that of his elder brother. He illustrates perhaps
a little too aggressively the nil admirari principle which is itself so
essentially English. When the <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</persName> is visiting any of
his future subjects he takes the utmost interest in everything
which concerns them, and lavishes his admiration upon all their
possessions, whether it be their wives or their daughters, their
houses or estates, their pictures or their wines, their cigars, silver
and gold plate, or china.</p>
<p>  This is not the way of the <persName key="Duke of Edinburgh">Duke of Edinburgh</persName>. He is apt to be
<pb n="16" id="p.16">

brusque, sometimes even a little contemptuous or disparaging, in
his comments. If he is shown an heirloom, or introduced to a rare
vintage, he spontaneously compares it with something of the same
sort which he himself possesses. It is a good wine, but not so good
as some in his own cellar. It is an interesting piece of crockery,
but he has seen others which would beat it, and, for that matter,
he can beat it himself. Or Mr. <persName key="Christopher Sykes">Christopher Sykes</persName>, the object of
whose life it is to irradiate the lives of royalties, reserves for the
<persName key="Duke of Edinburgh">Duke of Edinburgh</persName> his best covert in the shooting season, and His
Royal Highness acknowledges the compliment in what Mr. Sykes
considers a grudging fashion. That all princes are charming is
part of the religion of society in London. The standard of perfect
charm is afforded by the Prince of Wales, and of that standard the
<persName key="Duke of Edinburgh">Duke of Edinburgh</persName> just falls short.</p>
  <p>When the <persName key="Duchess of Edinburgh">Duchess of Edinburgh</persName> first came to England she was
the victim of an untoward combination of circumstances. The
English people were in one of those humors which recur at
intervals of hostility to <placeName key="Russia">Russia</placeName>. She found herself-and how could she
help it?-in an unsympathetic atmosphere. She was greeted with
respect, of course, but not with enthusiasm. She reciprocated the
tepidity of the sentiment displayed towards her. The English
public were not slow to discover that there was less of fascination in
her bow, as she drove in Hyde Park, than in that of the <persName key="Princess
of Wales">Princess
of Wales</persName>, and that her face was seldom brightened by a smile.
Those who are better acquainted with her have long since learned
her merits. Still her position in the economy of English royalty is
subordinate, and even obscure. She is not, and she will never be,
a popular personage. But she is a deserving princess, and, as I
have said, the place which some expected to see her fill was
preoccupied by the wife of her brother-in-law.</p>
  <p>I must crave pardon for having left to the last the social ruler of
the English realm, the <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</persName> himself. I call him the
social ruler, because in all matters appertaining to society and to
Court ceremonial he plays vicariously the part of the Sovereign.
The English monarchy may be described at the present moment as
being in a state of commission. Most of the duties of official
routine are performed by the Queen. It is the <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</persName> who
transacts its ceremonial business, who shows himself to the masses
as the embodiment of the monarchical principle, presides at the
opening of exhibitions, at levees, and, with the Princess, at drawing-rooms.
                           <pb n="17" id="p.17">

 If there were no <placeName key="Marlborough House">Marlborough House</placeName> there would be no
Court in London. The house of the Prince of Wales may be an
unsatisfactory substitute for a Court, but it is the only substitute
which exists, and it is the best which, under the circumstances, is
attainable.</p>
<p>  Every man, so the philosophers say, undergoes a complete change
once in seven years. Not a fibre, muscle, particle of flesh, or drop
of blood is the same at the end of that period as it was at the
beginning. This scientific fact, if royalty is amenable to the operations
of science, might explain why the <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</persName> is in <date value="1885">1885</date> very
different from what he was in <date value="1878">1878</date>. The vie orageuse is over and
forgotten, or remembered only, and only looked at, through the
mellowing medium of middle age. The <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</persName> does not
enjoy existence less, but more-calmly as one to whom the pleasure
which was once a passion has been transformed into an art. The
faculty of appreciation remains, but appetite has been curbed by
the discipline of time.</p>
  <p>His Royal Highness's father was the incarnation of respectability,
and the Prince himself has now confirmed the idol of respectability
in the highest niche of his country's pantheon. He shows, too, that
he has inherited something of the paternal anxiety lavished years
ago upon himself. His eldest son is of full age, and might in
the ordinary course of things expect an establishment of his own.
But the nature of the lad is gentle and submissive. He gives his
parents no solicitude. He is content to live under the paternal roof,
and has no uncontrollable desire for the possession of the royal
substitute for the ordinary latch-key. A thoroughly good boy this;
tended by his fond father in all things with a vigilance resembling
that exercised by a duenna over a beauty and heiress at a ball. The
second son of the Prince and Princess of Wales is, like his elder
brother, admirably conducted, is of a more vivacious temperament,
has more "go," and may therefore yet give some trouble. As for
the girls, they are what English princesses of their age should
bemodel young ladies.</p>
  <p>The <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</persName> has witnessed the disappearance of most of
the intimates of his youth or early manhood. Many of those whom
he delighted to honor have not done well. <persName key="Lord Aylesford">Lord Aylesford</persName> died the
other day. <persName key="Walter Harbord">Walter Harbord</persName> and <persName key="George Russell">George Russell</persName> are among the
disparus-have, <persName key="Anglice">Anglice</persName>, "gone under."  Others have suffered the
eclipse of calamity or death. But the <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</persName> survives,

<pb n="18" id="p.18">

and, having profited by the lessons of experience, can look back
upon a past marked by incidents and vicissitudes, not uniformly wise
or decorous, with a feeling of satisfaction at having risen superior
to his early eccentricities. His Royal Highness has developed into
a sort of censor and inquisitor of society and of the Court. As his
royal mother is apt to sit in judgment upon him, so he in his turn
criticises, counsels, castigates those who are subject to his authority.
He is prodigal of advice on great matters and small. Whether it
be a conjugal quarrel or a questionable marriage, the pattern of a
coat or the color of a frock, the Prince, if he is interested in those
whom the matter concerns, volunteers his advice. It is all meant
and done in the kindliest spirit in the world. His Royal Highness
wishes to be the mentor as well as the presiding genius of the
aristocratic system of England. He is therefore the champion of the
proprieties and the gentle but firm reprover of all deviations from
the standard of correctness. He attaches great importance to the
ordinances of religion, attends church regularly, digests and
criticises the sermon, has a quick eye for the mise en scene of the
ecclesiastical interior.</p>
 <p> The <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</persName> combines with this devotion to decorum a
love of mystery. It pleases him to be selected as the exclusive
confidant of any friends, of either sex, in whom he takes a special
interest. It would, he frankly tells them, be indiscreet to impart
to others the information with which it is right to entrust him.
Nor does he ever violate the faith reposed in him. He is as loyal
as he is kindly and considerate. If he deems it desirable to make
use of what has been told him, he never mentions names, and he
only says just enough to convince others that he is in possession of
all the facts. Frequently the private intelligence of which he is the
depositary seems to require further elucidation. There is a riddle
to be solved or an enigma to be unravelled. His Royal Highness
in following a clew displays all the patience of a detective
policeofficer on his promotion, and quite as much acumen. This is one
of his peculiarities, and it is in reality perfectly harmless. He has
nothing of the mischief-maker in his composition. He has,
moreover, a thoroughly creditable sense of his own responsibility. He
wishes to make those about him virtuous and good; and if he
considers that the best way of doing this is to superintend, and when
necessary investigate, their affairs, who shall say him nay?</p>
  <p>The <persName key="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</persName> is more than the supreme ruler of society;

                             <pb n="19" id="p.19">

he is the microcosm of society. All its idiosyncrasies are reflected
in the person of His Royal Highness: its hopes, its fears, its
aspirations, its solicitudes, its susceptibilities, its philosophy, its way of
looking at life and of appraising character-of each of these is the
Heir-Apparent the mirror. The sympathy which thus exists
between the Prince and his social subjects is vivid and intimate; the
most ill-natured censor cannot deny that its results are unmixedly
good. If a definition of society were sought for I should be inclined
to give it as the social area of which the Prince of Wales is
personally cognizant, within the limits of which he visits, and every
member of which is to some extent in touch with the ideas and wishes
of His Royal Highness. But for this central authority society in
London would be in imminent danger of falling into the same chaos
and collapse as the universe itself were one of the great laws of
nature to be suspended for five minutes.</p>
  <p>The introduction of the cigarette or cigar after dinner, when the
ladies have retired, and the economy of wine which it promotes;
the diffusion of a taste for music and the theatre; the personal as
well as the professional welcome accorded to theatrical and operatic
artistes in society, and the extent to which at evening parties their
services are in requisition; smoking concerts; the growing practice
of serving the joint at dinner as the piece de resistance immediately
after the fish, and before the entrees; above all things the growing
tendency towards curtailment of the menu, though London dinners
are still outrageously long-trifling as in themselves they may
appear are instances of the potency of the Prince's initiative. Again,
the Prince of Wales never misses attendance at church on Sunday,
and London society scrupulously follows his example. Nor, while
the Prince exercises throughout society a uniformly controlling
discipline, has he-a result which might, perhaps, have been
fearedreduced it to a dead level of sameness and dulness. On the
contrary, he has always encouraged with his approval, within the
limits of discretion and decorum, the presence of original and even
eccentric characters. Alive to the danger of stagnation, he shows
in many ways his wise desire to admit into it fresh currents of
social activity and thought.  Its innate tendency to sink into a
state of vapid conventionality is thus largely neutralized.
Moreover, the Prince of Wales does what is possible to perpetuate the
ancient virtues in a condition of things highly complex and
artificial; there is a risk of such virtues, I mean, as firmness to friends,

<pb n="20" id="p.20">

chivalrous regard for the feelings of others, loyalty, good faith, and
high honor, being crowded out of existence. It has sometimes
occurred to me that the Prince of Wales may be compared to a
physician of the body politic whose prescriptions are regarded as
infallible, and who decides in exactly what proportions the two
opposite principles of social medicine shall be combined by the
practitioners who bow to his authority; how far Bohemianism may
be blended with Pharisaism; in what quantity the acid of
rakishness may be infused into the alkali of respectability. From this
point of view the English Heir-Apparent is a great medicine-man,
ever beneficently ready with his counsel and specifics, quick to
diagnose the patient, to pronounce upon the evils which lie at the
root of the malady, and to indicate how they may be removed.</p>
  <p>In his attitude, then, to English society the Prince of Wales, at
the age of forty-three years, is a benevolent despot. He wishes it
to enjoy itself, to disport itself, to dance, sing, and play to its
heart's content. But he desires that it should do so in the right
manner, at the right times, and in the right places; and of these
condition she holds that he is the best, and, indeed, an infallible
judge. This conviction, while it causes him to exercise his
authority over his subjects in a more or less peremptory way, causes him
also to be exceedingly jealous of any censure, interference, or
criticism from outside. Gravely admonishing ladies and gentlemen who
are guilty, in his judgment, of some dereliction, he denounces
those who presume to find fault independently of himself. Severe
and, when necessary, uncompromising, he is just to and jealous of
those whom he corrects. He loves while he reproves, and he
insists that the chastening power should be reserved for his hand.</p>
  <p>There is an institution in London-well managed, but badly
situated-called the New Club, and domiciled in Covent Garden.
One may pleasantly wind up an evening here, dancing if you will,
and being always sure of capital music. The Prince of Wales
takes extreme interest in the New Club; it owes, in fact, its
existence to his support. A couple of years ago it was the subject of
some criticisms. His Royal Highness was exceedingly annoyed.
What did these mischievous and ill-natured intermeddlers mean?
Another instance of this trait-call it self-sufficiency,
irresponsibility, what you will-in the character of the Heir-Apparent: no man in
England will work harder or will transact business more efficiently;
but the work must be done in his own way and at his own time.</p>
                                 <pb n="21" id="p.21">

  <p>Englishmen, I have found, are easily bored. I will therefore
abstain from indulging in any further generalities about the Prince of
Wales, such as that he is the most hard-worked of Englishmen; that
his manner, which is indeed fascinating, has made him  many
friends; that he is a patron of the drama; that he occasionally
attends, in the capacity of Maecenas, theatrical suppers; and that the
machinery of English society could not be worked without him.
Again, I regard it as unnecessary to put into language the
banalities which readily come to my pen when I contemplate the elegant,
delightful, and lovely vision of the Princess of Wales. Her function
is to be and to look charming; to preserve, as she does, the
appearance of youth without invoking the aid of art; and to retain, as she
will retain to the last, the place she won in the English heart when
she first came to this country more than two decades ago. As the
Princess of Wales has her secretary and librarian, she may be credited
with literary tastes and intellectual powers. That she is clever
beyond the feminine average, and that she possesses an abundant
measure of that common sense which is perhaps uncommon, is
proved by the success with which she has played a domestic part
that she must have occasionally found difficult and trying. She
has avoided blunders, has fallen into none of the snares which
Court intrigue might have woven for her. She has never created,
or connived at the creation of, any Court faction of her own. With
a loyalty and nobility equal to her judgment, she has from the first
identified herself with the Prince of Wales, and has insisted
resolutely on seeing everything from the right point of view.</p>
  <p>It is not enough to say that in doing this she has evinced
considerable social dexterity. She has really discharged a
constitutional service, and by checking the initial growth of a scandal has
strengthened the foundations of the throne. You will be told that
Her Royal Highness is much occupied with trivialities, and that her
thoughts are centred in her wardrobe. Very well. But pray
remember that she is a princess, and that in England the sphere of
the activity of princes and princesses is rigidly circumscribed.
Like the Queen, the Princess of Wales has her little host of
attendant ladies. She displays towards them as much consideration as is
practicable, and though their existence may not be uniformly easy,
it is not wholly unendurable.</p>
  <p>There is nothing in London society more noticeable than its
monotony. If one is permitted to penetrate its most select circle, one
<pb n="22" id="p.22">

will find one's self perpetually in the company of the same persons,
and one's ears will be full of the discussion of the same topics.
The ladies and gentlemen who are the intimates of the Prince and
Princess of Wales, who constitute, in fact, a semi-regal court, are
not more than thirty or forty in number. I need not catalogue them
exhaustively. I will notice only a few of the more prominent,
summing up, as I do so, after the names of each, their chief qualities.</p>
  <p>The most constant of courtiers and the most indefatigable of
royal Amphitryons is Mr. Christopher Sykes, tall, well-mannered,
well-bred, and with an air significant of a curious surprise at the
trouble which so many of his fellow-creatures expend upon the
serious business of existence. His bearing indeed is that of a chronic
inability to comprehend why any one should take life in earnest.
Yet he is neither fool nor fribble. He is, on the contrary, a
hardheaded Yorkshireman, who has deliberately chosen his metier, and
sticks to it. At Sandringham and at Marlborough House he is a
species of what the English call tame cat. In return for his
domestication his country house in Yorkshire and his London house in
Mayfair are ever at the disposal of his august patrons. The social
wishes of the Prince of Wales are commands, and when the good
Christopher receives an intimation from his royal master that he will
dine with him on a certain evening, and that he expects to meet
certain guests, any previous engagement is cancelled, and the
banquet, big or small, is prepared forthwith. Mr. Sykes is, possibly
by the mandate of royalty, unmarried.</p>
 <p> Lord Cadogan, another intimate of his Royal Highness, is, equally
in appearance and in tastes, a contrast to Mr. Christopher Sykes.
His house, with its marble hall and broad staircase, is a palace.
He is exceedingly rich, and owns a large proportion of the most
fashionable part of Belgravia. A sportsman, a religionist, a social
reformer upon Conservative lines; he is the pink of social orthodoxy.
His demeanor is perhaps a little too professorial, but he is a good
type of an English nobleman. When one hears that the Prince of
Wales is his guest, one may be sure that the future King of England
is in safe hands.</p>
 <p> Lord Fife is also a peer whom the Prince of Wales delights to
honor in a marked degree. Had he been born in a lower station,
had he been less-the spoiled child of fortune, his Lordship would, ere
now, young as he is, have done great things; for he is very highly
gifted, and beneath the softest and pleasantest manner in the world

                                 <pb n="23" id="p.23">

conceals the quickest perception and the most robust judgment.
His life, his establishment, his ideas, his cuisine are those of a true
grand seigneur. He is also great equally as courtier and banker.
His right-hand man is Mr. Horace Farquhar, a gentleman of great
powers of business, but of not too conciliatory address; with a mind
so preoccupied by his duty to his patron and himself that he has
scarcely leisure to trouble himself with other thoughts. He has had
an astonishing career. By dint of will or ability he has reduced
success in any enterprise to a certainty. Altogether a strong man.</p>
  <p>Captain Oliver Montagu is a universal favorite in the Prince of
Wales's establishment, acceptable in the same degree to each of
Their Royal Highnesses, and always willing to make himself
useful. If he does not exactly possess the gift of wit, he has a
readiness and resourcefulness of mind, a certain aptness for blunt
repartee, which is probably understood better than would be an
intellectual article of superior make.  Lord Charles Beresford,
who, as I write, is putting forth his prowess and gallantry in
Egypt, is in a perennial state of high favor with the royalties, and
enjoys a chartered license. These Beresfords are indeed an
extraordinary family. If none of them are overburdened with false
modesty, none are conscious of fear. Lord William Beresford is
the incarnation of the fighting genius of the English or the Irish
race. Lord Charles is not his inferior in this respect, and has a
peculiar sense of fun, which he indulges at all seasons, altogether
his own. He it was who, when he received at the eleventh hour
an invitation to dinner from his royal master, sent this
characteristic telegram: "Very sorry; can't come. Lie follows by post."</p>
 <p> But I do not propose here to pass in review all those whom the
future King and Queen of England honor with their friendship and
intimacy. The proper place for mentioning their names and
describing their virtues will occur hereafter. The Prince of Wales is
both catholic and tolerant in his acquaintances. His dominating
idea is to place himself at the head of English society in general,
and, though he may have his special favorites, the list of those who
are in a general way courtiers would be too lengthy for me to
enumerate now. Every one worthy of commendation shall be presented
in a different context. To touch upon the ladies of English society
whom His Royal Highness distinguishes with exceptional attention
would be a delicate task; suffice it to say that he recognizes
impartially feminine merit of every degree. If that only is forth-coming

<pb n="24" id="p.24">

he has no prejudices.  Different nationalities, diverse types of
beauty and of character, are equal in his eyes; but in these matters,
as in others, he respects the convenances of society. Thus, though
the enthusiastic admiration lavished by His Royal Highness upon
individuals contributed to create the system of professional
beauties, he had no sooner ascertained that the elevation of these
divinities into a caste apart from others was prejudicial to the social
harmony of the community than he discouraged them. As a
consequence, professional beauties are unknown in England-at least by
that name-at the present moment.</p>
  <p>The Prince of Wales, while he is the cause of much hospitality,
is also himself hospitable. He entertains assiduously and wisely at
Marlborough House and Sandringham. He consults in the smallest
details the comfort of his guests. The ceremonial is as little
irksome as possible, and if the hospitality has a fault, it is that it is
conceived and ministered upon too generous a scale. The English
royalties are blessed with appetites of singular heartiness. Four
substantial meals a day are considered by no means an excessive
allowance. The five-o'clock tea, which was once restricted to the
beverage whence it derived its name, now includes a repast which
among the British bourgeoisie would be esteemed an abundant
supper. The plates of thin bread-and-butter, cakes, and hot muffins
are but the fringe of the entertainment; the pieces de resistance to
which unfailing justice is done are sandwiches of all sorts, pate de
foie gras, ham and eggs, cold tongue, and other dainties.</p>
  <p>Although the Prince of Wales honors with his company hosts of
every degree, you could scarcely imagine how many excellent
persons there are, the one unfulfilled ambition of whose existence is to
secure His Royal Highness at their table. With this view they
plot and plan with infinite ingenuity and patience, making the life
of Mr. Francis Knollys a burden to him. The number of
invitations sent out to last year's garden-party at Marlborough House
was, I have been told, three thousand. It is certain that at least a
third of those who were honored with the much-envied cards are
constantly occupied with the endeavor to secure royalty as their
guest.</p>
  <p>Now it is obvious that the Prince of Wales could not perform his
duties in this department unless he did so upon a definite principle.
The invitations he accepts and the houses he patronizes admit, I
believe, of a threefold division. First, there are the great nobles

                                <pb n="25" id="p.25">

and the more or less patrician plutocrats, whose establishments His
Royal Highness regards it as his pleasure or his duty, or both, to
visit. Secondly, there are the hosts whom he favors because he
knows that his enjoyment with them will be complete. Thirdly,
there are the representative gatherings whither he is impelled partly,
as in the first instance, by a sense of duty, and partly, it may be,
by a sense of pleasure.  Hence he attends the suppers or dinners
of actors and public institutions, for in all things His Royal
Highness has a consummate eye to effect. This it is which causes him
to distribute his favors impartially between the members of the two
parties in the State, and which, when five years ago Mr. Gladstone
was called to the Premiership, caused him, although he had only
just arrived in London from a Continental trip, to call upon the
nation's choice at half-past ten o'clock at night.</p>
  <p>I have already mentioned the name of Mr. Francis Knollys.
This reminds me that the Prince of Wales is served most admirably
by the officers of his household.  Sir William  Knollys, Mr.
Knollys's father, had the charge of His Royal Highness's affairs
from the very first. The traditions of the father have descended
to the son, and if the secrets of Marlborough House were divulged
it would be found that the knowledge of the world possessed by
Mr. Knollys, his cool, cautious judgment, and his courage had
rendered services for which alike the Prince and the country may
well be grateful. The Prince of Wales has also found trusty
servants and wise friends in some distinguished soldiers. In addition
to Colonel Arthur Ellis and Lord Suffield, Colonel Teesdale, one of
the heroes of Kars, and Sir Dighton Probyn, a beau sabreur, who
won his laurels during the Indian mutiny, a born leader of men,
who raised a troop of irregular cavalry, known still as Probyn's
Light Horse, are among those on regular duty at Marlborough
House.</p>

             <head type="sub">COSMOPOLITANISM OF LONDON SOCIETY.</head>

<argument><list type="toc"><item>London a new Paris</item><item>Peculiar organization of London society</item><item>Introduced
   to society</item><item>General features of society: its staidness, its credulity, its
   simplicity, its heartlessness, its careers.</item></list></argument>

<p>   ENGLAND is the country, and London is the capital, of the
unexpected. Nothing is exactly like what you were told you would find
it. The climate of Great Britain is always caricatured.  The
society of the British metropolis is always misrepresented-by
foreigners because they never mix in it long enough to understand
it as a whole, by English writers because they are only acquainted
with one or two aspects of it, while the genius of the nation does
not enable them to generalize. Society in London-and when you
have seen that you have seen everything-may be compared to a
piece of patchwork: you look at it from one point of view, and it
is all very familiar; from another, and it is strange. Something
here reminds you of Paris, something a little farther on of Vienna,
something next of any other capital you like. But the interspaces
between these apparently familiar experiences are new; in other
words, they are English. What you gaze upon is the foreign
pattern worked upon a native ground. The character of the polite
Anglo-Saxon is tricked out with so much which is entirely novel to
him that at first it is impossible to distinguish between the original
object and its superficial or accidental ornament.</p>
  <p>For these reasons people feel both more at home and more strange
in London society than in any other society in the world. The
explanation is that London society is the most cosmopolitan of any
in existence. I shall not err if I say that London is the only city
in Europe which possesses a society upon anything like its own
scale. Its organization, the care with which its fabric is built up
and tended, the effort and ingenuity expended upon it, its
tolerance, its credulity, its mixture of shrewdness and folly, of common-sense


<pb n="27" id="p.27">

 and conceit, its alternate subservience to and defiance of the
proprieties-all these, believe me, are unique.</p>
<p>  Before I illustrate what I mean let me define my general position.
There is, one is told, no waste in nature, and what Paris, since the
fall of the Empire, has lost, London has gained. I do not say that
every one goes to London now as all the world went to Paris once;
but the British capital to-day approaches nearer to the Paris of
fifteen or twenty years ago than any other capital of the world.
London is not the most beautiful, the most splendid, or even the
most convenient city; but it is pre-eminently the smart metropolis
of Europe. And the Americans have found it out. Formerly good
Americans were said to go to Paris after they died; depend upon it
their souls now migrate to London.</p>
<p>  Now when I say that London is above all things cosmopolitan,
I do not mean that those who are about to make their bow to
London society for the first time must be prepared for any
pentecostal variety of tongues. Less French is spoken on the banks of
the Thames than on the banks of any other great navigable river
in the western hemisphere. British cosmopolitanism shows itself
in its rapid assimilation of the social ideas of other countries and
in its heroic struggle to rise superior to the hampering restrictions
of insular respectability. True it still possesses its own excellent
common-sense, but even this immense virtue is beguiled by the
desire of those who possess it to prove that they are without its
prejudices.</p>
<p>  London society is thus a society in a state of solution. Some
day its different elements may crystallize themselves into a definite
shape, but not yet. If it is partially ruled by the traditions it fights
against, its very impatience of discipline carries it into the most
extravagant, the most ludicrous excesses. The more it is
contemplated, the more instructive and amusing it becomes. It is, in a
word, with English society as it is with English politics. The
principles of tradition and discipline are in perpetual conflict with
those of liberty and the right of private judgment.</p>
<p>  I have said that London alone of modern capitals possesses a
regular system of society. This is because London alone has what
one may call a social citadel, around which rally those who are
interested, or wish to affect an interest, in supporting it. There
are in London Whig houses and Tory houses, Radical and
Conservative hosts and hostesses. But be not led astray by names.</p>
<pb n="28" id="p.28">



<p>The division is unnatural and forced. Society, as society, is the
common possession in London of all who are admitted into it. It
is more than a phrase-more than an idea. It is an actuality. It
has a real existence, and its votaries are animated by a common
principle. The same men and women who, when they are
compelled to assume a political role, say, "How can we help our
party?" say in their social character, which is the real one, "How
can we keep ourselves together?" Society is conscious of an
identity of interest which compacts, with the force of cement, its
members into a single corporation. In Paris we have never had and
never shall have anything of the kind. Successive revolutions
have robbed us of a common social centre. Political differences
assert themselves as social distinctions, but in England, or rather in
London, this is unknown.</p>
<p>  Since, then, there exists a genuine stronghold to defend, it is
worth taking considerable trouble to defend it. Thus you have an
explanation of the elaborate scheme of dinner hospitalities
unknown elsewhere, to say nothing of those less serious
entertainments which the English share with the society of other European
capitals. Some people may think when they have heard a
legislative proposal discussed in the House of Commons that the only
point at issue is, how will it affect political parties? But society is
above parties, and what society asks itself is how it will affect its
order. It is this organic unity which is one of the characteristics
of the polite world on the English side of La Manche.</p>
<p>  However well introduced a person may be, however well
personally supported, society in London will not immediately welcome
him or her with open arms. Contrast with the Frenchman's first
visit to London the first visit of the Englishman to Paris. For his
Parisian friend to take the British stranger to the salon of the
Marquise D., to present him to the Marquise herself, and to obtain his
presentation by her to the great ladies whom she had assembled
about her, is, or in happier days was, the effort of an evening, nay,
of an hour, but it made his career. He knew almost in an instant
every one. There was not a house worth visiting in Paris which
was not open to him forthwith. He was a gentleman. His
credentials were good. His presence was agreeable. He knew the
right people; and whether he began with knowing fifty or a
hundred of them was immaterial. Some of these advantages the
foreigner who is exceptionally well situated may enjoy in visiting


<pb n="29" id="p.29">

England. Once the new-comer has fairly established his footing,
he will be passed on from house to house and, when September
comes, from country mansion to country mansion. But he must
not expect his letter of introduction to produce any instantaneous
or magical effect. He will leave with his card a letter of
recommendation at the house of a gentleman in Piccadilly, who will
casually observe to his wife, " My dear, here is M. So-and-so with
a letter from old - . I suppose," and here he will heave a little
sigh, " we must ask him to dinner. Shall we say the 9th?"</p>
 <p> "Impossible," his good lady will reply, "we have no place
vacant then. The earliest day would be the 23d, and, if you think
it necessary, I suppose he must come."</p>
<p>  The upshot is that the visitor will receive an invitation to dinner
on the 23d, that he will present himself at the house of his
entertainer at a quarter past eight, that he will be one of a company of
eighteen guests, whose faces are unknown to him and whose
language he imperfectly understands, and that he will quit the
premises of his new acquaintances about midnight without, unless
circumstances are exceptionally favorable, knowing anything more
of a single individual he has met than before he met them. This,
I admit, may be a discouraging commencement; but the stranger
must not be cast down, and if the impression he has created is
fairly favorable his opportunity will come.  He will not, as is
frequently done in Paris, make the acquaintance of the society of
London by attending the evening receptions of fine ladies in their
drawing-rooms, simply because the crushes which were once called
kettle-drums, and are now known merely as parties, present no
opportunities of this kind. He will go, of course, to receptions, to
show that he is asked, to put himself in evidence, and, when he
has ceased to be a stranger, to meet his friends. But he will not
go to them to make friends. The crowd is too great, the
movement too rapid, the attendance too brief, to render anything of this
sort possible.</p>
<p>  And yet there exists in England a sort of parallel or analogy, so
far as some of its social uses are concerned, to the old Parisian
salon. It is the afternoon call about the hour of five-o'clock tea.
Then is the time when, if there is anything worth recognizing in
the social recruit, his friends will find it out. He may be fortunate
enough to light upon his hostess and her daughter when they are
alone. The conversation will range round many subjects, and

<pb n="30" id="p.30">



come to a head in some proposals. If the days are still short and
the weather wintry, he may be invited to make one of a party to
the play. As summer draws near, there will be a suggestion of
picnics on the Thames; and he will be able to develop mere
acquaintance into friendship within the picturesque precincts of
Hyde Park. Thus, by degrees, he will find himself fairly launched.
It is of some importance that he should have his entree into the
St. James's Club. Mr. Gillett will receive him with open arms into
the Bachelors', and if he thinks he is worth cultivating he will ask
him to one of his little dinners, at which he seldom entertains less
than eight-and-twenty guests.</p>
<p>  London society, which is in some respects the most fastidious,
is in others the most credulous, the most composite, or the most
mixed upon the surface of our planet. It is the most fastidious
because it is the least tolerant of an obtrusive personality. English
society can pardon anything but egotism and blague. There are
many clever and amusing men who have been social failures, who
have made irretrievable shipwreck, because they have been
irrepressible. There are individuals who may enjoy a special license,
but they must be very sure of their ground before they begin to
presume upon it. Society in London hates for the most part aman
who insists upon having his presence felt. The reason is that it
recognizes in such an one the egotist, and that in the egotist it
scents unerringly the bore.</p>
<p>  Lay, then, this golden rule to heart: Never attempt to be
amusing; never venture into an anecdote; watch how anecdotes are
received; hear the comment of your next-door neighbor at dinner
upon them, and note how he invariably whispers confidentially in
your ear that he has heard the story a thousand times before.
When you are a personage in society, then you may affect to be
one; then, but not before; and let any one who is ever tempted to
violate this rudimentary maxim of good conduct be sure that it is
only the members of a coterie, held together by the ties of an
invisible freemasonry, who can safely indulge their antics before each
other. The social genius of the English race is solemn. Look at
the exquisites whom one will encounter in London theatres and
clubs, known till recently as "mashers." They are ripe for any
folly or dissipation, but their physiognomy is severity itself. The
austerity of their manner is relieved by no gleam of fun. Their
countenance wears a settled look of sullen melancholy. They



<pb n="31" id="p.31">

might, when they are not interchanging improper innuendoes with
each other, be mutes at a funeral; yet, their absurdities
notwithstanding, they are true to the traditions of their race.</p>
<p>  Strange, it may well seem, that this society, so self-contained, so
impatient of certain forms of folly, is duped with the most
extraordinary facility. It is impossible to enter the most irreproachable
drawing-rooms in London without meeting these foreigners, of both
sexes, whose presence is well known to be tabooed in the
secondrate salons of republican Paris. Madame Denise and her daughter
are droll phenomena to men who know something of Madame
Denise's antecedents. What is one to say? Is it the simplicity or
the hospitality of the Anglo-Saxon race which finds its expression
in this truly catholic comprehensiveness? Kindly and unsuspecting
though the English are, they would not, I believe, welcome, as they
do, the odd foreigners I am now speaking of unless they could
boast the very highest authority for doing so. England is the chosen
home of freedom, but not of independence; and society in London,
in all it does, or abstains from doing, is, as I have already shown,
absolutely dependent on the initiative of royalty. It is indeed so
large, so overgrown, that it is conscious it would, unless it were to
accept the guidance of royalty, be without any controlling principle.
It does, therefore, precisely what royalty, or even those who are
somewhat remotely connected with royalty, bids it to do. If august
personages in commanding positions receive ladies such as Madame
Denise, and improvised husbands such as M. Denise, society follows
suit. And yet there are fools who say that the monarchy in
England is in danger!</p>
<p>Let me give another instance of this sort of thing, which one
must be prepared indefinitely to meet with in London society. One
of the first persons to whom the stranger is likely to be presented is
a lady, famous for her beauty, whose career has been, to say the
least, interesting. A few years ago she was unknown in London.
But she went to a theatre by herself. In the next stall to her sat a
nobleman, the Marquis of ---, accompanied by the Marchioness.
His keen eye was immediately arrested by the loveliness of his
neighbor. He offered her his play-bill or his opera-glass, entered
into conversation with her, discovered that her husband was
yachting in the Polar Seas, and that her father was, say, a colonial
prelate. The beauteous stranger was staying at an hotel, and had
intended rejoining her husband, I think at Spitzbergen, the next
<pb n="32" id="p.32">



day. The kindly and courteous peer expressed a hope that as she
was in the capital she would stay to see a little more of its society.
In eighteen hours afterwards the Marquis and Marchioness of
had called upon her. Four-and-twenty hours later she was their
guest at dinner, and before the week was out she was a personage
in London society.</p>
<p>  It is inevitable that a society assorted upon these loose and
fortuitous principles should be curiously miscellaneous. It is
miscellaneous, however, in an orthodox manner. The word of command
must first be given in the highest quarters. The adventurer or the
adventuress is not admitted into houses really worth entering,
unless those whose word is law have set the precedent. When that is
done the rest is easy. Society in London will never judge for itself
if its rulers will relieve it of the responsibility. Whatever these do
is right. The doctrine of passive obedience which was once the
foundation of loyalty to the throne is now illustrated with
unswerving allegiance in the social sphere. The subordination of
Englishmen to the monarchical principle shows itself on a new plane, but
is in reality as rigid as ever. Paradox though it may seem, the two
chief characteristics of society in London are its simplicity and its
heartlessness. The former quality is shown in other ways than I
have just described. Society is amused with marvellous ease. The
smallest of practical jokes are enough to set it in a roar. The
slightest eccentricity of demeanor plunges it in a paroxysm of
laughter. Gossip that is perfectly puerile delights it. Any trivial
scandal, the tale of which is told without point, epigram, or even
antithesis, is welcomed as the best thing in the world. In Paris a
certain flavor of wit or humor is expected. There is no necessity
of anything of the kind in London. These grown-up men and
women who laugh at the recital of imbecilities and ineptitudes are
as easily entertained as children. Like children, too, they love to
parade their own vices, and to make themselves out a thousand
times more wicked than they are. No society could exist if it was
half as corrupt as the members of London society, to judge from
their casual talk or from the significance which their comments
and allusions are intended to convey. But it is talk only-the lax
garrulity of a race which is still laboriously endeavoring to
emancipate itself from the fetters of Puritanism. It is Puritanism, it is
morality, it is religion, it is the sense of duty, wedded to and
regulating the fever of enterprise, which have made the English the race


<pb n="33" id="p.33">

they are. Yet it is these obligations which society in London
affects to ridicule.</p>
<p>In what does that which I have called the heartlessness of society
exhibit itself? Partly in its cynicism, which is, to a large extent,
an affectation; partly and far more conspicuously in its disrespect
of those conventionalities-in its violation of that unwritten law of
decency and family obligations which is sacro sanct in France.
Here, then, one may see the latent barbarism of the English
character betraying itself. A smart lady in London society will dine
out and enjoy herself in any fashion-a perfectly harmless fashion,
no doubt-that pleases her when her brother or her sister, perhaps
even her father or her mother, is stricken with a mortal illness, or
is actually at the point of death. I will give a more definite
instance. Some few months ago a nobleman leased his shooting-box
in the country to another nobleman of his own kindred.  The
eldest son of the proprietor of the estate happened to die, and the
lad's funeral was fixed for the same day as that on which a party of
fashionable guests was to assemble at the house which, had he lived,
he would have inherited. Nevertheless the party was not put off,
and the same train that conveyed the corpse of the young man to
the family vault, which was in the church of the estate, then let to
his kinsman, conveyed also his father, the owner of the property,
and all the guests who were to enjoy themselves on his moors.
The party had been arranged beforehand, and in England the pace
at which they live is so quick that the sorrows of the sepulchre
must yield to the convenience of society.</p>
<p>  Society in London has the recommendation of supplying some
gentlemen with a career exactly appropriate for the display of
activities that might otherwise languish for want of employment.
Mr. Gillett, whose name has been already mentioned, is one of
these; Mr. Dalison is another. But the most puissant of the group
is Mr. Kenneth Howard, who has succeeded Mr. Augustus Lumley
as an organizer-in-chief of society's entertainments. Each of these
gentlemen was designed by nature, with a special view to the
ornamental needs of society, as a master of ceremonies. Mr. Lumley,
young now no longer, wealthy, and the lord of a fine estate,
continues to take a benevolent interest in society's doings, would
doubtless give a favorite dowager the benefit of his counsel upon
any critical occasion, and might even, at a pinch, superintend the
arrangement of a cotillon-a species of enterprise in which erewhile

<pb n="34" id="p.34">

he achieved greater successes than any other European arbiter of
elegance. Mr. Howard fills Mr. Lumley's place to perfection, and
the most anxious and nervous of hostesses has learned from
experience that she may place as implicit confidence in the list of dancing
men he draws up at short notice for a ball as in the famous
catalogues of his predecessor. Mr. Alfred Montgomery, the very
picture of an elderly beau, has also rendered substantial service to
society's hostesses. In some respects he is a more noticeable man
than he might at first be taken for. One might easily suppose him
to be nothing more than a dandy in his decadence. After a very
little conversation one discovers that he combines with a thorough
knowledge of the world a comprehensive acquaintance with
English literature as well as a vast repertory of stories. His career has
been eventful. He has known domestic trouble, and has been
rewarded for his sufferings by non-domestic success.</p>

<argument><list type="toc"><item>English diplomatic officials and ex-officials: Lord Granville, Sir Charles Dilke,

   de Bylandt</item><item>Diplomatic society should be better organized.</item>
</list></argument>
<p>   THERE is no society in London that can be called distinctively
diplomatic. The Foreign Secretary entertains diplomatists at
dinner when special events in which they are concerned are taking
place in the English capital; when, for instance, a treaty for the
navigation of the Danube is being drawn up, or an Egyptian
conference is being held. The wife of the Foreign Secretary receives,
of course, ambassadors and attaches at her State parties at the
Foreign Office or at her house; and at these the "diplomatic circle,"
as the newspapers call it, is represented prominently-that is to
say, there is visible an unusual number of gentlemen accredited to
the Court of St. James's and decorated with foreign orders. The
scene is brilliant, but it is not more brilliant than any other of the
receptions at the mansions of English ministers who happen also to
be nobles of high degree.</p>
<p>  There is, indeed, a club in London-the St. James's-one of the
best-with a cuisine and cellar of exceptional excellence, to which
most diplomatists, English or foreign, belong. The St. James's
Club has thus a diplomatic cachet about it, and the representatives
of all nations find it a convenient locality for dining, smoking, and
card-playing. It is, however, official as much as it is diplomatic.
If most perhaps of the Foreign Office clerks and under-secretaries
belong to it, so, too, do many of the clerks of other offices of State,
notably the Treasury and the superior departments of the Civil
Service generally. The club may be described by the English
epithet, now much in vogue, smart. It is more than any other establishment

<pb n="36" id="p.36">



 of the kind-an international and cosmopolitan
rendezvous for gentlemen of position and fashion. Breakfast at Voisin's
any morning you like, and you may be sure that the majority of
those you meet there, if they are Englishmen, or if they have
occasion to be in England pretty frequently, have the entree of the St.
James's Club.</p>
<p>  The foreign diplomatist, then, in England is, like the English
diplomatist, like the English lawyer, politician, or doctor, merged in the
elements which constitute the general society of London. He is to
be met with at all the best houses of the capital. At the first a foreign
ambassador or attache may find the time hang a little heavily on his
hands. The dinners of ceremony are unpalatable novelties. He
sighs for more frequent and less formal intercourse with the fair sex.
So it was with the Italian ambassador on his earliest arrival in
England, the Chevalier Nigra. But the strangeness soon wears off, and
English comfort is felt to be no bad recompense for the deficiencies
of the English salon. After a time the diplomatist who is stationed
in London is surrounded by a little set of special acquaintances, and
gradually grows to be intimate at particular houses. There are a
few English hosts and hostesses who make it a point of honor to
secure at their more select feasts the presence of a leader diplomat.
The present head of the London Rothschilds, Sir Nathaniel de
Rothschild, who lives in a palace in Piccadilly, is noted for his
hospitality to foreign ambassadors and attaches. Sir Algernon and
Lady Borthwick, whose house, formerly the residence of the poet
Byron, is only a hundred paces distant in the same thoroughfare.
Sir Julian and Lady Goldsmid, Lord and Lady Delawarr, are also
renowned for the alacrity with which they welcome the official
representatives of foreign governments. Other persons, whom it
is needless to name, if they are interested in commercial or
industrial enterprises in the territory of some remote State, cultivate
in a special degree the friendship of that State's ministers and
servants in England; and indeed you will soon be able to form a
shrewd idea, from the nationality of the minor foreign diplomats
whom you meet under any particular roof, where the wealth or
some portion of it of their entertainers, whether they are
contractors, investors, or speculators, is laid out.</p>
<p>  Lord Granville, who I imagine will remain at the head of the
Foreign Office for some time longer, lives at Carlton House
Terrace. All Europe knows him by reputation. Very courtly, well-bred,


<pb n="37" id="p.37">

 and pleasant to look upon; a little deaf, but not so deaf as he
is often supposed to be, and indeed concealing at times a singular
quickness of hearing under the veil of this malady; cautious, wary
-one might say wily-saying little himself, and preferring to talk
on any subject rather than on politics or diplomacy. Altogether
he is an interesting man. He once declined to be, and has twice
narrowly missed being Prime-minister.  He was once a prime
favorite at Court, but has compromised or sacrificed that position
since he attached himself so devotedly to Mr. Gladstone and his
fortunes. Although, as is plain for one to see, he has been a man
of pleasure, he is not prematurely old, and carries his years well.
Gout has peremptorily restricted his enjoyment of existence within
narrow limits, and has tended to confirm a natural impulse towards
indecision. But though his judgment is halting, and his
reluctance to undertake responsibilitity unusually great even for a Whig
-dread of responsibility and sensitiveness to public opinion are the
notes of Whiggism-he still transacts in his own fashion, working
by preference in his house rather than at his bureau in Downing
Street, a good deal of business. Lord Granville married a second
time some years ago a young wife. He has a rising family of boys
and girls. He is a brave husband and an assiduous father.</p>
<p>  Two years ago it seemed as if Lord Granville would find at no
distant date a successor in Sir Charles Dilke. That minister has
educated himself in a manner peculiarly suitable for the portfolio
of Foreign Affairs. He has been a great traveller; he has acquired
many acquaintances and some friendships at the chief European
capitals; he was for several years the one Englishman who knew
Gambetta; he is possessed of a property near Toulon to which he
retires periodically, though not for the same length of time
together that he formerly did. Perhaps the place has lost some of its
attractions, or perhaps the demands of office render more
protracted sojourns impossible. Add, too, the insight into European
questions, and into the forces which govern their development,
immense aptitude for dealing with details, clearness of judgment,
and strength of will; add, also, great linguistic acquirements and a
decidedly good manner-grave though urbane, kindly but cautious
-and you have no bad material for the composition of an English
Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>  But, alas! the prospect once so fair has been clouded over. Sir
  Charles Dilke may be compared to an ardent admirer of the sex
<pb n="38" id="p.38">



who has had a disappointment of heart to which he is unable to
rise superior. His passion blighted, his hope nipped in the bud,
have bequeathed him a legacy of resentment and disgust. He will
have no more to say, at any rate for the present, to foreign affairs.
For what happened?   It is but three short years ago that Sir
Charles Dilke went to Paris burning with impatience to win the
heart of the French people to a commercial treaty. He was like a
young, enthusiastic, and credulous lover. He confided in M.
Gambetta, believed that Gambetta would do anything for him, as he
would have done for Gambetta. Oh, the perfidy of that man!
Oh, for the fond expectances of the English Under-secretary
shattered forever!</p>
<p>  Sir Charles Dilke was kept in Paris, at the magnificent
apartments in the Grand Hotel to which he had been welcomed with the
ovation due to a plenipotentiary after he has concluded a treaty,
for some weeks at that season of the year when Paris is most
insupportable.  It all came to nothing.  The French were dead
against free exchange. M. Gambetta had played upon the young
affections of his English friend. Sir Charles Dilke silently, though
not on that account the less bitterly, resented the wrong he had
suffered. Henceforth he would disbelieve foreign statesmen
generally and French statesmen in particular.  No talk for the present,
if you please, of replacing Lord Granville; and very soon after
his return to England Sir Charles Dilke quitted the Foreign Office
for the Presidency of the Local Government Board with the
determination that he would henceforth have nothing more to do with
foreign policy. Since then he has been as little in Paris, as little
indeed out of England, as possible. Whether the wound is
irremediable, whether he will remain a misodiplomat, as some cruelly
treated lovers remain misogynists to the end of the chapter, time
will show.</p>
<p>  Yet, though Sir Charles Dilke cannot conceal all traces of an
affliction still recent, he is agreeable, hospitable, and marvellously
well informed. He drinks no wine and smokes many cigars. I
am told that he meditates for the second time matrimony. For
myself I think that Sir Charles Dilke's aversion to the Foreign
Office is not invincible, and is only transient. It often happens
that when a man has been severely defeated in a love affair jilted
by his betrothed, or duped by the mistress for whom he had a grand
passion, he has sworn he would for the future have nothing more


<pb n="39" id="p.39">

to say to womankind. It is a rash vow. The inevitable hour
arrives, the destined lady appears, and the misogynist yields. Sir
Charles Dilke may have steeled his heart, may have turned his soft
susceptibilities to adamant. But fate is too much for him. In the
bitterness of his disappointment, and in the full fury of his wrath,
he swore that foreign affairs should never tempt him to their
embrace again; that he would dedicate his future to that chaste ideal
of non-intervention which all good Radicals ought to worship.
But who shall control circumstances?  See what England has had
to face during the last two years-the reopening of the whole
Egyptian and of a large part of the Eastern Question. There are
no signs that the era of these foreign complications is about to
close. Non-intervention, abstinence from diplomacy, is
therefore rapidly becoming just as much out of the question to that
austere eremite of Radicalism, Sir Charles Dilke, as isolation from
feminine society is to the man who, living in the midst of his
fellow-creatures, cannot subdue the cravings of the old Adam for the
old or the young Eve.</p>
<p>  Of the lesser officials of the Foreign Office there is only one who
is seen extensively in the guise of an entertainer of diplomatists.
Sir Julian Pauncefote and Mr. Villiers Lister are both of them
gentlemen greatly to be esteemed, eminently worthy and capable.
The former is a first-rate man of business. He is not, indeed, so
completely in the diplomatic current, so saturated with the
traditions of a Foreign Office, as Mr. Lister, who is a connection of the
late Lord Clarendon, and the member of a governing and a
diplomatic family. Sir Julian Pauncefote is even, from the Foreign
Office point of view, a parvenu. He is in the Office, but not of it.
He knows its routine, but he has not felt the contagious force of its
genius. He is a capital official, but an official who, as his colleagues
think, though they are the last men in the world to hint so much in
words, lacks the inspiration of his department. Titularly he is the
successor of Lord Hammond, who spent the greater portion of half
a century in the Foreign Office, and who during that time opened
more official letters with his own hand than was ever done within
a similar period by a servant of the English Crown. Lord Hammond
still lives-a gouty, rather cross-grained and opinionated old
gentleman, but agreeable and instructive when he is not suffering from
an acute attack of the malady peculiar to British statesmen and
diplomatist, and happy in the possession of a wife and daughters
<pb n="40" id="p.40">



who are among the best and most amiable women in the world.
But I have forgotten to mention the name of the Under-secretary
of the Foreign Office who, so far as London society is concerned, is
incomparably the most prominent of the group-a ubiquitous
diner-out, and a deeply versed and finished Amphitryon.</p>
<p>  Mr. Philip Currie can be a stranger to no one who is acquainted
with Paris, Florence, or London. He is a true citizen of the world,
though many of his most admirable qualities are distinctively
British. He is now a man of nearly fifty-two years of age, of a pink
and white countenance befitting his innocence, with light curling
hair, with a presence undeniably good, and a manner half courtly
and half contemptuous. Finished man of the world as he is,
cynical and blase as he may be also, there is still a soupcon of boyish
freshness about him which is in its way quite charming. You may
make a long day's journey in London, and in England, and come
across many varieties of men before you meet a more creditable
specimen of the English official or the English gentleman than
Philip Currie.</p>
<p>  I attribute his merits to a combination of circumstances.
Belonging immediately to a powerful and opulent commercial family,
he has inherited the best sort of common-sense with which the
English middle class is gifted. His brother is one of the largest
partners, and the chief manager, of one of the greatest private
banks in the City of London. Mr. Philip Currie, had his career
been that of banking instead of diplomacy, would have
acquitted himself equally well. As it is, he has brought into diplomacy
all those qualities which would have stood him in such good stead
in business. He adds to the finesse of the diplomatist the
practical shrewdness, the grit of the Englishman of business. He
knows that his countrymen are, above all things, traders, and that
the City of London is, in a sense, England. There can be nothing
visionary in the political or diplomatic faith which rests upon a
metallic basis.</p>
<p>  Again, Mr. Philip Currie is closely connected with one of the
most sagacious and not the least aristocratic of Whig families, the
family of Lord Kimberley; and the Whiggism he has imbibed
from these relatives makes, in its conjunction with the City
ingredients in his character, an admirable blend. Probably his greatest
defect and his worst enemy, though it has detracted in no degree
from his official usefulness, has been a certain voluptuous languor


<pb n="41" id="p.41">

of disposition, superinducing something akin to indolence. He is
an epicurean of the most comprehensive, and in many respects
refined, tastes. He has a suburban villa, which is a model in some
rooms of the very best style of English furniture and decoration, in
others of Italian ornament. You will observe the same grace and
finish in everything about him. He may be a little too official for
some people, a little too cynical for others, but he is never either
without a reason. His manner may be criticised as too much
resembling that of the dilettante.  But there is nothing frivolous or
effeminate in his views on practical matters. If he is not a
statesman, he knows what a statesman ought to be, and he is an
admirable judge alike of the temper of the English people and the extent
of English resources.</p>
<p>  Thus far I have had nothing to say of those who are of some
importance in a sketch of diplomatic society in London, viz., the
foreign diplomatists themselves. I repeat my remark that there is no
circle in London society which is exclusively diplomatic.
Individual ambassadors have their favorite hosts and hostesses, and are
to be seen most frequently at certain houses. Thus one minister,
M. Waddington and Mme. Waddington, are constant guests at
Lady Molesworth's. Her Ladyship knows, and has known for,
shall I say half a century? every one in London or in England
worth knowing. Never was an acquaintance at once so catholic
and so eclectic. Statesmen, judges, divines, authors, actors,
painters, wits, beauties, the rank and file of men and women of the
world-with all the most prominent of these she has been upon
good terms, has entertained them well, and has allowed herself to
be entertained by some of them in return. She has an inborn
aptitude for that most critical of social combinations, the London
dinner-party of from eight to twelve people. Any hostess can turn
her dining-room into a table-d'hote; very few can make it the scene
of symposia, at once attractive for their social ease and impressive
for their social distinction. And all this though, resembling in that
respect the city of Rome-Exiguis profecta initiis.</p>
<p>  The German Ambassador, Count Munster, is, so far as habits
and tastes are concerned, an Englishman. He enjoys to the full
the pleasures, and he is impregnated with most of the prejudices,
of the aristocratic order in which he mixes. Connected himself by
marriage with the Earl of Rosslyn, he is on terms of domestic
intimacy with that nobleman. He is also a frequent visitor at the
houses in London and in the country of a ci-devant English Secretary
<pb n="42" id="p.42">



 of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Derby. But wherever
you go, provided only the social level is sufficiently high, there you
will meet Count Munster. Fond of horses, and a good judge of
them, a fair rider, a passable whip, a member of the Four-in-Hand
Club, whose coach is always one of the best turned out in the Park,
an industrious and early-rising fisherman when he happens to be
on a visit at a country house through the grounds of which there
runs a trout-stream that takes his fancy-Count Munster presents
also the appearance of an English gentleman, and it is only from
his foreign accent that you would know him not to be an
Englishman born. As a host he cannot be praised; his dinners are the
worst, and his evening parties among the dullest, of the London
season. Nor as a diplomatist has he any particular
recommendations. To Prince Bismarck he is almost useless, but he has not
been recalled for no other reason than that there is probably no
other subject of the German Empire who could afford the expense
of the German embassy in Carlton House Gardens. His opinion
on the political affairs of England is absolutely worthless. He is
without more knowledge than may be picked up from the
newspapers. When the Times writes in a Conservative sense, he is
persuaded that the country is Tory at heart; and when its tone
approximates to Liberalism, he is convinced that Mr. Gladstone or
Mr. Chamberlain is, and is likely to remain, omnipotent.</p>
<p>  As to the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador to the Court of St.
James's, Count Karolyi, and his perfectly charming Countess, you
will see them nowhere to greater advantage than in the mansion
of Lord Breadalbane, which used to belong to the eccentric Duke
of Portland, Harcourt House, in Cavendish Square. The Karolyis
indeed go everywhere, less because the Count is so much
appreciated or so brilliant than because the Countess is so popular. The
reader may remember that one of the first things which Mr.
Gladstone did on his accession to office in <date value="1880">1880</date> was to address a letter to
the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador to the Court of St. James's
expressing his regret that he should have spoken disrespectfully of
the policy of his government.  It is a fact that this incident vastly
improved the social position of Count Karolyi, both in Liberal and
Conservative circles.</p>
<p>  The Danish Minister and his wife-an English lady well known
and much liked-Madame de Falk, may be said to live more even
for society than diplomacy.</p>
<p>  The Chevalier Nigra is justly famous for the excellence of the


<pb n="43" id="p.43">

dinners which he gives to his favored friends. He is also famous
for a chef whose gifts are not confined to the cuisine, and who is
quite a master of the art of legerdemain. His excellency, when he
pays visits to his friends from Saturday to Monday, is in the habit
of taking with him his domestic to amuse the company with his
tricks.</p>
<p>The Chevalier Nigra belongs to the school of Cavour, and is
probably the most efficient member of the Italian diplomatic corps.
He is cool, quiet, and determined; speaks French with strong
accent, which, when he so desires it, renders him unintelligible;
has a great opinion of female influence, and has always employed
it with success in his diplomatic career. In France his power with
the Empress was the principal factor in the foreign policy of the
Empire. When transferred to Russia, he immediately contrived to
establish such relations with certain members of the Court circle
among the fair sex as gave him an authority usually denied to
foreign representatives in the Russian capital. Since his arrival in
London he has elaborated a similar programme, to the success of
which can be ascribed in a great measure the conclusion of the
Anglo-Italian alliance.</p>
<p>  The representatives of the Sultan and of the Dutch Government
have been in London longer than any other members of the corps
diplomatique. Musurus-a quiet-looking little man, with a
tranquil, almost seraphic expression of countenance, giving one the
idea that he is engaged in the stealthy contemplation of the beatific
vision-though almost English in his habits of thought, his tastes,
as in his partialities, and though speaking English well, prefers to
talk in French. M. de Bylandt speaks English as an Englishman,
and is in this respect a great contrast to Countess de Bylandt, a
clever and well-read woman, but not too easy to understand in
consequence of the peculiarity of her enunciation, whatever the
tongue in which she may address one.</p>
<p>  In society Count de Bylandt has a gift of agreeable conversation
and a nervous manner. His diplomatic career has been long and
successful. As Secretary of Embassy in St. Petersburg he
acquired a diplomatic habit of a Russian kind, which he intensified
by marriage with a Russian lady belonging to an old Muscovite
family. Subsequently he was Minister at Constantinople, and
having now been for nearly fifteen years Minister in London, is
regarded by his colleagues as an authority upon all matters of form.
<pb n="44" id="p.44">



The estimation in which he is held by his own government, who
find his voluminous despatches a trifle irksome, is less respectful,
and the Foreign Office at the Hague is animated by a hope that
Count de Bylandt will shortly seek repose and cause a
muchcoveted post to be vacant.</p>
<p>  The Spanish Minister, the Marquis de Casa Laiglesia, has also
been resident for many years in London, and is a familiar and
popular personage in London society. His career in the English
capital is better known to most persons from the social than from the
diplomatic aspect. He has had in his day several affairs of heart.
His name has been mentioned, rightly or wrongly, in many
contests of gallantry. But all things come to an end, and the Marquis
de Laiglesia has-not, I dare say, without a sigh of regret-bidden
adieu to the amorous dalliance of his prime.</p>
<p>  Count Piper, the Swedish Minister, is seldom seen in any except
purely official society. Speaking English with much volubility and
amusing incorrectness, he is ready to talk about any theme, social
or political, foreign or domestic, which crops up.  Droll,
diverting, and inexhaustibly good tempered, he scatters cheeriness around
him, and society in London would be the merrier if it saw more
of him.</p>
  <p>Just now the polite world is speculating as to the successor of
Mr. Russell Lowell at the United States embassy. Mr. Lowell's
retirement will be a greater loss to the literary and intellectual life
of London than to its political or diplomatic circles. For he is
above all things a man of letters-the reader and writer of books,
the master of epigrammatic English, and on the whole the best
after-dinner speaker in the capital. Summoned from an American
professorship to diplomacy, he brought with him to his new duties
none of the stiffness or pedantry of the schoolman. Beyond any
of his contemporaries, he has been instrumental in improving the
estimate entertained of Americans, not only by Englishmen, but
by the representatives of Europe in England, and indeed elsewhere.</p>
<p>  St. Petersburg has recently sent to London a new Ambassador in
M. de Staal, who has won golden opinions. This was what his
predecessor never succeeded in doing. The Baron de Mohrenheim
had the misfortune to spread, wherever he went, a sense of ennui.
He was accused of having caused Mr. Gladstone's illness a couple
of years ago, while he could never see Lord Granville without
predisposing that illustrious statesman to an attack of the gout.</p>


<pb n="45" id="p.45">

<p>  Let me conclude these remarks with a word or two about Baron
Solvyas, the Belgian Minister. His predecessor, M. Van Der Weyer,
was to all intents and purposes an Englishman. Very nearly the
same may be said of the present representative of the Belgian
Government. He speaks English as an Englishman, and he judges at
least as correctly of English character and of the currents of
political thought as the most dispassionate Briton.</p>
<p>  M. de Staal, noted for his correctness and courtesy, was formerly
an official attached to the staff of Gortschakoff (brother of the
Chancellor), while in command of the Military District of Warsaw.
With Gortschakoff lie subsequently became more intimately
associated by his marriage with his daughter, a lady whose charms of
conversation are generally recognized. M. de Staal has the
reputation of being safe and cautious, and, since the death of his wife's
uncle and the Chancellor, has remained on confidential terms with
his successor at the Russian Foreign Office, M. de Giers. He is
given to hospitality, and, in conjunction with Madame de Staal,
bids fair to achieve a social success in London. So far as his
diplomatic action is concerned, he may be trusted quietly to
maintain the traditions of his country's diplomatic service.</p>
<p>  That the position of diplomacy in England and the character of
what I have called for the sake of convenience, rather than of
accuracy, diplomatic society should be what it has been represented
as being is not strange. The English carry their insularity into
everything. Even their public men seem to think that as their
country is divided by the sea from the rest of the world, it is of no
particular importance to them to have any intimacy with foreigners.
Thus society in London welcomes after a frigid fashion the
ministers of foreign Powers, treats them well, entertains them royally,
but it does no more. I do not think it is very wise in its
generation. English politicians might derive greater benefit than they
look for by recognizing in ambassadors and attaches, not only
foreign officials to whom courtesy is due, but men who might be useful
in establishing between England and the rest of Europe a sort of
personal rapport which is surely at this time of day greatly to be
desired.</p>

<p>   OVERGROWN and mixed as London society is, there are in it two
or three small and exceedingly exclusive sets the ladies and
gentlemen composing which, if they occasionally mingle with the
outer world, never tolerate the presence among themselves of
any one who does not belong to their number. Lady Sefton, Lady
Cowper, Lady Marian Alford, Lady Northampton, and Lady
Pembroke are the representatives of coteries of this kind, rigidly barred
against all outsiders. Lady Marian Alford, a devoted as well as a
very agreeable and accomplished hostess of royalty, is hardly ever
to be met with save in her own house. Lord and Lady Bath have
little intercourse with those of their fellow-creatures who move on
a lower plane. They receive in London and at Longleat a chosen
and limited circle of friends. They are finished and favorable
specimens of the English nobility, patrician to the tips of their
finger-nails. Lord Bath, with his frigidity and hauteur, might be
the original of a conventional portrait of an English peer. If his
youth and early manhood were agitated by occasional indiscretions,
he has long since cast the husk of all follies, and has settled-one
might almost say has frozen-down into the very exemplar of an
immaculate, unemotional, self-possessed British aristocrat. He has
had, too, his flirtations with Liberalism, and has coquetted with
Mr. Gladstone. But this, too, is an affair of the past, and one may
truthfully state, for the satisfaction of all whom it concerns, that
he is to-day as unbending and narrow-minded a Tory as he is a
blue-blooded peer. Only contrast with these unrelentingly inelastic
cliques the more light-hearted and catholic circles where enjoyment



<pb n="47" id="p.47">

is the first thing sought after, and where folly is not despised
because it is folly, in which the Hardwicks and Dangans move.</p>
<p>  The scale on which London society exists is unmanageably huge.
It therefore lacks unity; it is a chaotic congeries of sets. There
are higher grades in it and lower grades. There are certain houses
and hosts who constitute centres round which the social atoms
rally. On the other hand, the instances just given are almost the
only ones which English society affords of equivalents of the old
nobility of the Faubourg St. Germain, the old Catholic aristocracy
of France or Italy, who will have nothing to say to the newer social
grades. For the rest there are a few genuine social leaders. There
are innumerable pretenders of the pettiest kind to social leadership.
It is impossible, and it would be uninteresting even if it were
possible, to pass all or even a majority of these in review. I shall
only aim at presenting the reader to some of the chief personages
whom it is important he or she should know, and at indicating the
principal forces which sway the social mass.</p>
<p>  Of these the chief is wealth. English society, once ruled by an
aristocracy, is now dominated mainly by a plutocracy. And this
plutocracy is to a large extent Hebraic in its composition. There
is no phenomenon more noticeable in the society of London than
the ascendency of the Jews. Exception may be taken to this
statement. I may be told that the chosen race exert no particular
power, and that there is a great deal of excellent society in
England, and for that matter in London, where Jews are unknown or
are rarely seen. But in that kind of society which is known as
"smart" you will soon discover that the Israelites are the lords
paramount.</p>
 <p> The reason is not far to seek. It is to be found, first, in the
increased power attaching to the principle of money, as distinguished
from the principle of birth; and secondly, in the initiative of the
Prince of Wales. The Heir-Apparent is, as I have already
explained, the king of the social system in London, just as much as
is the Queen the constitutional monarch of the realm. His Royal
Highness regards the best class of Hebrews with conspicuous favor.
In that, as in other matters, he sets a fashion. The innumerable
host of his satellites follow his example, and bow the knee before
the descendants of the tribes. You may say that the same thing
may be witnessed elsewhere than in England. Possibly; but
nowhere, I think, to precisely the same degree.</p>

<pb n="48" id="p.48">



<p>  In London the Rothschilds are, to a great extent, as I have said,
by favor of the Prince of Wales, a race of social potentates. That
they are commercial potentates in the City of London, as they are
in sundry cities of the Continent, who needs to be told? You may
hear that there is no member of the English firm of Rothschild,
whose mercantile palace is New Court, of commanding ability. If,
however, the financial genius of the old Baron Lionel has not
descended in its plenitude to each of his sons, each is clever beyond
the average, while the accumulated traditions of generations and
the ripe experience of their chiefs of department are guarantees
against any serious mistakes.</p>
<p>  It is, so far as the Rothschilds themselves are concerned, a species
of trinity, the first person of which is Sir Nathaniel, the second
Mr. Alfred, and the third Mr. Leopold de Rothschild. The baronet
is the supreme head of the establishment, occupying the first place
at the family tribunal, receiving visitors, and treated with marked
deference by his two brothers. You will find him at first a
gentleman of curious manner. He is so preoccupied by the cares of
business, lie is so habituated to the exercise of authority, that he can
spare little thought for the amenities of life, and he is not so much
intolerant of contradiction by others as fond of contradicting others
himself. But this is merely one of the superficial idiosyncrasies of
the man. A contradiction with him means no more than an
interrogation with you. It is only the way in which he puts a question.
Instead of asking on what evidence your assertion rests that the
day is fine or wet, he considers it the more effectual to meet your
statement that it is wet or fine with a point-blank denial. In this
fashion he hopes to elicit your reasons, to put you on your mettle,
to compel you to retract your declaration, if it is hasty and ill-
considered, or to demonstrate that it is based upon testimony entitled
to respect. People who make "Natty's " acquaintance for the first
time may be forgiven if they conceive the idea that he is disposed
to be imperious, overbearing, and harsh. There could be no greater
mistake. He is not any one of these things. He is, on the
contrary, when his interest or regard is fairly enlisted, kind,
considerate, and sympathetic.</p>
<p>  His two brothers discharge respectively parts essential to the
economy of New Court. The youngest, Leopold, is occupied with
the mechanical minutiae of the business. In the City his vocation
appears humble and he himself little more than a drudge. Outside



<pb n="49" id="p.49">

the City he is a person of importance, a man of sport and pleasure,
a member of the Jockey Club, an owner of race-horses, and of a
modest establishment in Buckinghamshire. The second of the
three Rothschild brothers has functions, as he has a physiognomy,
altogether unlike either of his two brothers. He is light of
complexion, while they are dark, with tawny hair and drooping
mustache of the same color and cut known as the Dundreary.
He bestows much attention on the graces of manner. His
hospitalities in London and in the country are upon an elaborate scale.
The Prince of Wales is frequently among his visitors, and no
opportunity is wanting to enable him to form an accurate idea of
the opinion held by the privileged or official classes in English
society. Add to this that the Rothschilds in London have at their
disposal a little army of brokers and touts in the City, a choice
detachment of politicians and financiers, whether they do or do not
belong to the public service at the West End; bear in mind, too,
that they receive early information from their kinsmen and
correspondents in every part of the earth of what is happening or is
likely to happen, and you will not be surprised to know that New
Court is the abode of power.</p>
<p>  The family genius of the Rothschilds shows itself equally in the
understanding they maintain among themselves and the relations
they establish with all those who can be useful to them. It is only
natural that a house divided as the Rothschilds are into branches,
each branch being a separate dynasty, should have its own little
jealousies. There could be no more solid monument to their
shrewdness and sagacity than that they should not suffer these
jealousies to hold them apart at critical moments when union is
strength. Nor do they choose their friends and agents outside
themselves with less discrimination or treat them with less of wise
generosity and forbearance. They know exactly whom to select
for their purpose, and once having made their choice, they are loyal
to it. Many men are indebted to the Rothschilds for their fortune.
No one who has once placed their trust in them, and whom they
have found it worth their while to trust, can reproach them with
having deserted him.</p>
<p>  There is a fourth member of the Rothschild family, himself
having nothing to do with the business in New Court, or with any
department of the Rothschild business in any other capital, and
yet largely instrumental in extending the influence and popularity,


<pb n="50" id="p.50">



and in reinforcing the dignity, of the great house: this is Baron
Ferdinand Rothschild, by birth an Austrian, by process of
naturalization an Englishman. His role in existence is principally
ornamental. Like his kinsmen, he is possessed of a palace in that
portion of Piccadilly which may be called the Rothschilds' quarter.
He has also a magnificent chateau in that part of the county of
Buckingham  which the Rothschilds have practically annexed,
though, with characteristic caution, their actual investments in
land are much smaller than is generally supposed. Here he receives
more or less throughout the whole year, and especially during the
summer months for two or three days at a time, whole cohorts of
fashionable and distinguished guests. It is a real palace of art; a
superb domicile of decorative treasure; a paradise for the
connoisseur and the virtuoso. All the Rothschilds are collectors, and
Baron Ferdinand is conspicuous among them.</p>
<p>  The Oppenheim and Bischoffsheim establishments are two of the
other chief monuments which London affords to the Hebraic
ascendency. There is, however, a marked distinction between these
families. Mr. Oppenheim-" H. O.," as you may hear him
familiarly called in New Court and in other circles where he is intimate
-has completely merged himself in the society of Englishmen.
Himself a man of singularly agreeable and even winning manners,
he married one of the cleverest, prettiest, and best born of Irish
women; he inhabits and has beautified incredibly the mansion in
Bruton Street which belonged formerly to Lord Granville and Lord
Carnarvon. On the other hand, Mr. and Mrs. Bischoffsheim are to
all intents and purposes foreigners. Naturalized and acclimatized
to England and London they are; but they have never become
completely amalgamated with the social mass of which they form a
part. It is true they entertain, and are entertained by, the highest
and the smartest personages in England; but Mr. Bischoffsheim, a
Dutchman by birth, is as little of an Englishman as his brother
Charles, that most confirmed of all Parisian boulevardiers. Nor is
there more of the Briton in Mrs. Bischoffsheim. A Viennese by
origin, she is a bold, successful, gracious woman of the world; very
handsome, and with the eye of a general for social combinations
and manoeuvres. Her attitude may indeed remind one of that of a
foreign commander in petticoats in possession of a conquered
country, and placed there for the exclusive purpose of holding down its
inhabitants. She does not, perhaps, greatly love the English, or,



<pb n="51" id="p.51">

indeed, the Christian race. She fetes and pets them if necessary
with benignity and with magnificence; but, unless I am much
mistaken, her sentiments are those of the general who, by dint of
consummate cleverness, has won a supreme triumph, and whom
victory enables to be generous, rather than of the hostess of London
society who is to the manner born. She is an excellent mother, and
dresses to perfection. As her children are admirably brought up,
so are her toilets in the best taste. Indeed, both Mrs.
Bischoffsheim and Mrs. Oppenheim have more influence upon fashion in
feminine costume than any two other ladies resident in London;
and as regards modes are six months in advance of any of their
rivals.</p>
<p>  The second feature to which, in my attempt to present a
trustworthy chart of society in London, I should draw attention is the
ascendency of the Teutonic element. The social influences of Jews
and Germans run in parallel, often in converging, streams, and are
frequently centred in the same persons. But there are some
Germans, who are exceedingly powerful in London, who are not Jews.
Just as Great Britain is now suffering from an invasion of Germans
as formidable in its way as that which France experienced in the
Great War--an invasion which substitutes German clerks and
lawyers, German merchants and big and small tradesmen for
English; which supplants English by German barristers-so in society
there are opulent Teutons who, having made large fortunes in the
United States or in the colonies of England, have settled in London,
and exercise their supremacy over a gradually extending area.</p>
<p>  Every grade in English life, from the royal family to the
domestic servant, is leavened by the German element. A few statistics
will show the force of this statement. Of the 250,000 Germans in
England to-day at least two-fifths live in the metropolis. The
German consulate estimates the total at 70,000; but if one reckons
German Austrians and German Swiss, the aggregate of Teutonic
Londoners cannot fall short of 100,000; and one must never forget that
many of these are married, and that their children probably
number 50,000.</p>
<p>  To depart for a moment from the society of the West End, you
will discover much crime, more misery, and infinite degradation
at the East End, occasioned, first, among the English work-people,
secondly, among themselves, by the influx of Germans. Thus
there are some 5,000 tailors of German birth east of the Bank of

<pb n="52" id="p.52">



England who swell the ranks of an industry which without them
would be more than choked. It is the same with every calling in
the British capital, whether in high life or low. Germans elbow
Englishmen in all directions, underselling them in commerce, and
reducing the increment of the wage-earning classes to a minimum
which barely suffices to keep starvation from their doors. It is a
startling fact that in no city in the world, Berlin alone excepted,
are there so many destitute Germans as in London.</p>
<p>  Fifty years ago things were very different. The German was
then only a casual visitor to our shores, and the German language
was despised by English scholars. But the neglected idiom of the
Fatherland became a general and favorite study immediately after
the marriage of the Queen with a German prince, and to-day Goethe
and Lessing are as familiar to some English people as Carlyle,
Lytton, or Scott are to the German.</p>
<p>  As with literature, so with every other profession and phase
of the national existence. Music, art, politics, finance, commerce
soon began to feel, and still feels, to even an increasing extent, the
influence of German culture and resource. In English finance
Germany is represented by men of whom I have already spoken.
One of the ablest men in the House of Commons, Mr. Goschen,
is a German; so are Mr. <persName key="Schreiber Baron">Schreiber Baron</persName> and Henry de Worms.
Mr. Max Muller is only one of a host of German professors in
England. Music claims many eminent German composers, such as
Halle, Richter, Meininger, Joachim, Bonnawitz, Strakosch, Menter.
Since the Franco-German War there has been an unwonted
tendency on the part of the Teuton in every quarter of the world to
assert his nationality; and though in English society he is respected
and welcomed, in English commercial and professional life he is
creating a scare by the manner in which he is displacing the sons of
the soil.</p>
<p>  Not less remarkable than the social organization and authority of
the children of Israel and of the Fatherland is the place which
Americans have won for themselves in the social economy of the
English capital. Between the tactics of the Hebrews and the
subjects of the United States there is a certain similarity: each
commences his operations by establishing firmly a centre and a base.
Now it may be a connection secured by marriage with a great house,
now a friendship with those in social or political power. The
Americans of both sexes, if, like the Jews, they have their international



<pb n="53" id="p.53">

and tribal jealousies, seldom fail to combine as against
the Briton. Englishmen and Englishwomen are the opponents
against whom they naturally range themselves, and to overcome
whom is the supreme triumph. The American, once he or she has
got a foothold in society, never voluntarily relinquishes, and is
seldom violently dislodged from it. And the Americans are
gregarious; they hunt, not merely in couples, but in little packs.
The fair Yankee has no sooner made a conquest and led an
English aristocrat to the altar than she commences immediately to
consider what she can do for her compatriots with the leverage in
her hands. She has sisters or cousins as beautiful as herself, and
she feels all the pride of conquest in inducing English lovers to
bend the knee to them and to pass under the transatlantic yoke.
British fathers and mothers may protest, but the young Englishman,
if there is anything which renders him at all eligible when once he
is enmeshed in the toils of <foreign lang="fr">la belle Americaine</foreign>, never, I think,
escapes from them, or never, I should perhaps rather say, shows
any desire to do so.</p>
<p>Much may be said in favor of the American lady who is now one
of the reigning princesses of English society. She is often pretty,
never mercenary. She has for the most part some wealth herself,
and prefers infinitely to wealth in her husband position, wit,
intellect. She is also seldom lacking in humor and in conversational
skill. Altogether she is an acquisition to society, though her
independence, her impatience of restraints, and especially her
incessant efforts to advance by matrimonial alliances or otherwise the
interest of her countrywomen, may sometimes prove fertile in
mischief.</p>
<p>  One of the reasons why the fair Americans of London society
are so much in request, and are so conspicuous at such august
functions as ambassadors' dinners, is that they are for the most part
accomplished linguists. The greater portion of their life has been
spent on the continent of Europe. Their French, German, and
Italian are infinitely better than those of the ordinary educated
Englishwoman. Thus they can play their part in the conversation
at the most cosmopolitan and panglot of feasts.</p>
<p>  Everywhere in France and in Germany politicians and
diplomatists are found wedded to American wives. That, perhaps, may
be to a large extent because these wives are heiresses. English
society, being wealthier, has not felt in the same degree as society

<pb n="54" id="p.54">



in France and Germany the effects of their wealth; but it has felt
in a greater degree than the society of other capitals the effects of
their social talents, has been brightened by their vivacity and
illuminated with their gayety. Finally, the fair American has, like
the representatives of the Hebrew race, been largely benefited by
the approval of royalty. The Prince of Wales is an habitual
worshipper at American shrines, and my reader may perhaps, before
the London season of <date value="1885">1885</date> is over, have the opportunity of meeting
His Royal Highness at a dinner-party every lady present at which
comes from the great republic of the west.</p>
<p>  Change breeds love of change, and society in London, having
taken to its bosom the exotic novelties here specified, seeks to
indulge its passion for novelty in a host of other ways. It craves
perpetually for fresh sensations, for new features, for anything that
is a little out of the common. Mark now how this impulse
expresses itself. Jews, Germans, and Americans are the new blood
introduced into English society's veins. That circumstance is to
be regarded as the assertion of a general principle. But you will
see this principle illustrated in a more specific manner and upon a
different scale. For instance, there is a lady well known in
London society who lives in a street between <placeName key="Cavendish Square">Cavendish Square</placeName> and
<placeName key="Regent's Park">Regent's Park</placeName>, and who, inspired by the prevailing passion for
novel and sensational effects, has turned her drawing-room, and at
the hour of luncheon her dining-room too, into a rendezvous of
curiosities. There is another lady of the same sort, whose house is at
no great distance, who is even more devoted to second-rate
celebrities and pinchbeck beauties, and who, next to a Radical
statesman, adores an actress with a history, or a married lady on whom
august personages in remote regions are reported to have doted.
She has her admirers, at a decorous distance be it understood,
among all parties, all sects, all religions. She welcomes
impartially to her roof Tories and revolutionists, bishops and ballet-girls,
-or if not exactly ballet-girls, young ladies whose faces are as
well known from their appearance on the burlesque stage as from
their photographs in the shop-windows.</p>
<p>  I do not know whether London is to be visited in the course of
the coming summer by any royal savage from Africa or Asia. If
so, he is sure to be as much in request at houses of the type I now
speak of as the jeune premier in light comedy who happens to be
for the moment the vogue, and his wife who is the substantial embodiment


<pb n="55" id="p.55">

 of all matronly virtues, and who, even as certain soi-disant
negro minstrels never perform out of London, takes good care to
acquaint the world that she never goes anywhere unaccompanied
by her husband.</p>
<p>  This notoriety-hunting, this droll mixture of nobles and nihilists,
of the very flower of respectability with Bohemians whose celebrity
is the creation of yesterday, is less amusing than might be expected.
Enter the apartment in which this droll assembly is collected, and
you will find that you are in an atmosphere of social constraint.
The Tory plutocrat tries to make himself agreeable to the
communist, but carefully keeps at a little distance, as one who is afraid
of his pockets being picked. The hostess herself, as she looks
around, betrays signs of misgiving at the experiment in which she
is engaged, or, it may be, is agitated by apprehensions that the
ornaments which lie scattered about her drawing-room are less safe
than usual.</p>
<p>  Now, though there is upon these occasions and in such
establishments as I am describing a great blending of elements, there is no
real fusion of them; it is a rude and undigested mass. Society in
its fierce appetite for novelty may be compared to the greedy and
famishing eater who bolts anything on which he can lay his hands,
but does not assimilate the various morsels. The aliens, the
monstrosities, the notorieties, who are very often nonentities, of both
sexes, invited for the sake of effect, are looked at askance. They
are treated like animals in a cage. At the Zoological Gardens you
are requested not to approach too close to the bars, behind which
is the fractious monkey or the untamable tiger. Society applies
that rule to its intercourse with those whom it affects to welcome
as a relief from its own monotony.</p>
<p>  There are some ladies in London who make it a point to invite
at least one writer of repute to their week-day, and an actor or two
of standing to their Sunday, dinner-parties. You can always
recognize the social outsider from his air of isolation. Perhaps he is
looked at, perhaps he is ignored. He is no more one of the convives,
unless he sings or plays or recites, than is the butler or the
pageboy. To speak the truth, London society in its anxiety to secure
prophylactics against boredom has run into a dangerous excess, and
there are some at least who are beginning to doubt whether the
remedy is not worse than the disease. But is that possible?  The
actors and actresses, impostors and impostresses, who feebly twinkle

<pb n="56" id="p.56">
in the social firmament, at least help to diversify its appearance. If
these are not very entertaining, they are at least harmless. Society
does not suffer from its contact with them, and if any one is injured
by the arrangement it is the gentlemen and ladies, of a sphere which
is not that of society, who are more or less intoxicated by the
influences brought to bear upon them, and who occasionally make
themselves ridiculous by burlesquing the demeanor of their patrons.</p>
<p>  Let me point out one or two more aspects of this mania which
has possessed society in London for the bizarre and the unfamiliar.
So terrific had the ravages of ennui and the spleen become that ere
yet these queer combinations in drawing-rooms were devised
English society was resolved to do something desperate. It occurred
to it that it would at least be a change to ignore, when there seemed
any possibility of ignoring, the distinction between virtue and vice.
I do not mean to say that it deliberately and with one accord
dethroned virtue from its pedestal. The idea which suggested itself
was, that people branded with the epithet of vicious might at least
possess the virtue of contributing to the general fund of
amusement. It was therefore determined by way of experiment to grant
an amnesty to a certain class of social offenders-to continue to
admit them to the chosen places of society if the scandals in which
they had been involved were not of a very flagrant character, or if
haply they had been forgotten.</p>
<p>  So successful did this prove that the ethical relaxation which was
the leading idea of the experiment has been permanently
established. Society, finding that it was less dull in proportion as it was
more tolerant, resolved to carry the virtue of Christian charity and
forgiveness to an extreme.</p>
<p>  But here I must warn the stranger against committing an
unpardonable mistake. Do not suppose that the conversational license
which society in London sanctions and stimulates is
indiscriminately allowed to any one who chooses to claim it. You must be a
chartered libertine in the possession of a certificate duly given to
you by society first. Almost anything may be said. Almost any
story, however risque, may be told. Almost any allusion, however
delicate, may be ventured on, if the person venturing upon it has
received, so to speak, the necessary commission from the right
authorities. Two things are indispensable. One, that the lady or
gentleman indulging in this lively vein should know the
idiosyncrasies of his company; the other, that he should be known by



<pb n="57" id="p.57">

them-known, that is, as bien vu in high places. And before even
the privileged individual can dare all this with impunity, he or she
must be thoroughly versed in that jargon and argot which in smart
society pass for conversation; must have acquired the right of
calling a good many of his friends and acquaintances by their Christian
names; must be initiated into all the mysteries of high life; in a
word, must be somebody.</p>
<p>  The audacious parvenu who, on the strength of a casual or
superficial acquaintance with the customs and chatter of society, thinks
to win a reputation by transgressing the limits of decorum, by mild
sallies of irreproachable humor, or even by the jests which gentle
dulness ever loves, will soon be reminded of his mistake. There is
in these matters, as in others, an inexorable order, to violate which
is fatal. Society ruthlessly ostracizes anything like unwarranted
familiarity. It may be compared to a family party. Its members
have been brought up with the same traditions and in the same
curriculum. They are bound together by that identity of
sentiment or pursuit which comes from the associations of school,
college, or regiment, politics or clubs, official, diplomatic, or
military life. Much is permitted to those united by this community
of experience or occupation. But society resents peremptorily and
punishes pitilessly any act of intrusion or presumption on the part
of those who have not made their social footing good, or who are
not furnished with the due credentials.</p>
<p>  It has often occurred to me that society in London, or that
particular section of society which is the brightest, the most diverting,
and which makes itself most heard of, resembles an Agapemone.
The relations existing between the blithe and joyous persons of
whom this household consists may be the most curious imaginable;
husbands and wives may all be a little mixed; but then though
there is fusion there is no confusion. They understand each other
so well. They have tacitly agreed to enjoy themselves according
to their own taste. "Fay ce que voudras" is their motto. There
was a time when the upshot of it all would have been elopements,
duels, the breaking up of homes, and Heaven only knows what
else. That sort of thing is sneered at by society to-day as obsolete,
melodramatic, childish. The dominating idea is not the
cultivation of virtue, but the prevention of scandal. Every one, society
argues, has a clear interest in suppressing anything which might
lead to social disturbance. Externally, therefore, the proprieties
<pb n="58" id="p.58">



must be respected. No handle must be given which the profane
vulgar may seize upon to society's detriment. If things wrong in
themselves are to be done, in Heaven's name let them be done
quietly and decently. If the world will talk, let the lie direct be
given to its base assertions and rumors by presenting to the
public a front of social decorum and unity. Ladies and gentlemen,
as I have said, have entered into a tacit and rational agreement.
Let them therefore be unabashed. They have no thought of
pursuing each other into the divorce court, and so they take every
opportunity of appearing in public as if conjugal infidelity could
not be dreamt of, much less exist. When, for instance, an intimacy
that may be perhaps a trifle equivocal has been developed between
two or three households, the gentlemen and ladies concerned, by
way of dispelling suspicion and rebuking the comments of
ignorance and malice, make up a party for the play and appear together
in the orchestra stalls.</p>
 <p> The real significance of this interesting phenomenon is the
extreme sensitiveness of the ladies and gentlemen prominent in
London society to the public opinion of their inferiors, and their
loyal attachment to the well-being of society itself. Periodically
they are troubled with vague alarms that their social organization
is in some danger from outside attacks. They catch the echoes of
popular disapproval at their doings which, when any scandal
occurs, find expression in the newspapers read by their social
inferiors. Offences will come, but woe unto him or her by whom
they come; and society regards as, in some sort, an enemy and a
traitor to itself the man or woman who puts it openly to the blush.
Let all things by all means be done decently and in due order;
that is society's motto; and those who do not obey it are held to
have introduced a foe into the camp. On the whole, the public
opinion of society on itself may be defined as the inarticulate
utterance of the apprehension with which society is inspired by the
actual or possible censures of the common herd.</p>
<p>  There is something curious, and even touching, in the tenacity
with which society in London clings to the remnants of
respectability-in which it is always assuring itself that, however hostile
appearances may seem, it is in reality thoroughly moral at heart,
and in which it responds to any appeals that may be made to its
piety and its virtue. No other nation in the world possesses this
morbidly developed self-consciousness. Frenchmen and
Frenchwomen may be as virtuous, or the reverse of virtuous, as Englishmen


<pb n="59" id="p.59">

 and Englishwomen; but with them the morality or immorality
is assumed. It is taken for granted; it is not talked about. It is
as much a matter of course as the features of the countenance. I
should say that in England the most respectable, the most
absolutely blameless of ladies love to discuss the contrasts which society
contains between vice and virtue, and to toy, in the purest spirit
conceivable, with topics of a questionable kind. To sum up,
London society is in a constant state of moral valetudinarianism,
which is not a conclusive sign of moral health. It protests a little
too much that it is ethically robust not to suggest the suspicion
that there may be something organically wrong.</p>
<p>  Do not, however, draw from these interesting phenomena the
conclusion that society in London is anything like as lax in its
observance of ethical laws as it pretends to be. Ladies and gentlemen
treat each other with an easy abandon which may seem to imply
the absence of respect either for themselves or for each other.
You may also fancy that they impute to one another peccadilloes
and offences of which not only the Hebraic Decalogue but the
English law takes cognizance. That is a peculiarly English trait,
and you must beware of overrating its significance. Self-
disparagement is a national weakness of the English race, possessing kindred
on one side to the pride that apes humility, and on the other to
that cynical indifference born of the stolidity of the Briton.</p>
<p>  There is scarcely anything indigenous to his land which the
Englishman does not in turn abuse, whether it be his climate or
his architecture, the physical condition of the streets of his
metropolis in bad weather, or their moral condition in all weathers.
Society would have too little to talk about if it did not burlesque
and exaggerate its pleasant vices. When one considers how much
scandal, even though it be short-lived, any serious deflection from
the strait path of virtue excites; how much preparation, moreover,
it involves; the comparative absence, in a word, of the
opportunities of evil-one may perceive immediately that London society
could not by any possibility be half so incorrect as it loves in
casual conversation to paint itself as being. My concluding advice
to the stranger, therefore, is to abstain from presuming-I say not
in deed merely, but in word-on that disregard of the sacred laws
of hearth and home which the unreflecting listener to the talk of
English drawing-rooms and dinner-tables might suppose to be the
characteristic of the interesting country and capital he may be
about to visit.</p>

<p>   THE reader will now be in a position to form a fair general idea,
to take a bird's-eye view, of London society. Wherever it may be
-whether the scene shifts from Mayfair and Hyde Park to the
country houses of the provinces or to the spas of the
Continentthat society is always the same. There are thousands and tens of
thousands of well-dressed, decently bred, and more or less highly
educated persons outside, but for our present purpose no account
need be taken of these.</p>
<p>  Unless one develops a taste for sport or a grand passion one finds
few inducements to study or mix with the society of London
except in London. Not, indeed, that one is able to dispense with
making its acquaintance in its rural aspects. However much you
may detest the country and its occupations, the country-house visit
is an occasional necessity, and, if you shoot or hunt, a very
agreeable rite. But you will encounter no variety save of venue and
surroundings. The company will be the same, and there will be
no departure by a hair's-breadth from the stock topics of
conversation. If your host thinks it his duty, he will ask a few of the local
gentry to meet his fine friends from London. But the aborigines
of the district are instantly eclipsed by the brilliant strangers.
Moreover, it is impossible for hosts and hostesses when they
entertain their friends at the family seats in the English shires to do
anything else. They must observe in the case of these gatherings
the same principle that they do at their dinner-parties in town.
Country-house hospitalities are, in fact, London dinner-parties
prolonged over two or three days. The fruition of all which the
resources of the establishment of the domain can yield is packed into



<pb n="61" id="p.61">

that limited space. As the function is numerously attended, so it
is exceedingly costly. The host has to find accommodation, not
merely for his friends, but for a multitude of servants. His
visitors will not care to come unless they can meet their friends, and
when that particular visit is over there are similar appointments in
other parts of the United Kingdom to be kept.</p>
<p>  You will thus see that the instinct for novelty and change, which,
as I have already explained, is one of the most pronounced
attributes of society, is compensated equally in the country and in
London by the infinite sufferance of the familiar and the stereotyped.
Unless, indeed, this element preponderates in the composition of
any of the parties to which you are invited, you will at once know
that the establishment is one of a second-rate order. After a very
little experience you will be able to predict with accuracy whom
you will find at a dinner-table or in a drawing-room upon any given
occasion; and if when you enter the apartments of your hosts the
majority of the names and faces are strange, you will be right in
concluding that your entertainers are not so well placed as to
entitle them to a continuance of your attentions.</p>
<p>   A small sprinkling of unknowns is indeed permissible, and may
 be contemplated without apprehension. Famous travellers recently
 returned from the East, relatives of the household who have been
 serving with their regiments in India, in Canada, or elsewhere,
 even obscure cousins, are to be expected. But society, as it is
represented by its representatives at these select reunions, invariably
 looks with something of astonishment and distrust at the unknowns,
 and wonders as the English king wondered of the apples in the
 dumplings how the deuce they ever got inside. Yet the society in
 which you will see no one whom after a time you have not seen
 before is less tedious on the whole than the society in which new
 faces abound. It is not merely the best, but perhaps the only, the
 sole society which it is worth taking the trouble to enter. When
 an English wit was once asked to dine in Bloomsbury in the old
 coaching days he replied, "Delighted; but pray tell me where we
 change horses." The impertinence and affectation were
abominable. The assumption, however, on which they rested, that it was
 not worth while dining outside the limited circumference of
fashion, was justified by facts. What Bloomsbury was, South
Kensington is; and though there are many persons who have a
recognized position in London society, and who live in Queen's Gate
<pb n="62" id="p.62">



and its neighborhood, you will do well to hesitate before you
accept the ordinary invitations which emanate to you from their
quarter.</p>
<p>  What are the ties or principles of union which hold the various
sections of London society, and the individuals constituting these
sections, together? Except for special purposes it is not similarity
of interests or tastes. It is not the link of political sympathy.
Least of all is it resemblance of antecedents. Probably I shall not
be wrong if I say that there is no bond of social union so subtle and
far-reaching as that of sport-sport in its various branches-
shooting, hunting, the card-table, and, above all, the turf. It is a
common English saying that "on the turf and under it all men are
equal." For art and literature it is not incumbent on Englishmen
to profess any regard.  Towards politics their attitude may be,
and usually is, one of scepticism, indifference, and pessimism. If
they are members of the House of Lords or the House of Commons
they will vote upon a particular side and will be attached to a
particular leader. But they are not pervaded by any cohesive spirit
of political loyalty, and it is not considered to their discredit that
they should often avow they are sick to death of politics and of
everything appertaining to them.</p>
<p>  But in sport, employing that word in the comprehensive sense
just indicated, I find a pastime or a business-call it what you will
-that really constitutes a centre round which the social atoms, each
in their own orbit, revolve. All Englishmen, and a good many
Englishwomen, if they have no vested interest in horses, bet,
gamble, or speculate in some way. When it is not the turf, it is
the Stock Exchange, and perhaps this is the reason that the City
plays so large a part in the arrangements of the West End. Duch
esses and other ladies of rank, I may parenthetically observe, would
scarcely be so demonstrative in their affection for the wirepullers
of the London money market, to say nothing of a crowd of
stockjobbers and stock-brokers, but for the speculative impulse within
them.</p>
<p>  I pronounce, without hesitation, that the turf and the operations
essential or subsidiary to it possess more of a universal power in
society and exercise a greater attractive force in society than
anything else. It is the ruling passion, and in virtue of its
predominance it does in effect group society round itself.  The Prince of
Wales, as society's king, is a patron of the turf; seldom misses an



<pb n="63" id="p.63">

important race-meeting, and is reported to have a share in the
proprietorship of some race-horses. The Duke of Richmond celebrates
the Goodwood meeting, held in his park, with a brilliant
countryhouse party, of not less than thirty or forty in number, containing
the cream of London society, and every one of them interested, or
making a show of being interested, in racing. Many other
mansions in the neighborhood are filled in the same fashion, though
upon a less splendid scale. What takes place in and about
Goodwood in August has been previously witnessed in the neighborhood
of Ascot in June. A fortnight before Ascot the Derby has been
run at Epsom, and the week between Epsom and Ascot
traditionally marked the zenith and the apogee of the London season. Nor
are the other great hippic festivals of the year at Doncaster, at
Stockbridge, and at Chester of less local importance.  Rightly,
therefore, will you learn to look upon the turf as one of the great
rallying centres of London society-as the embodiment of the
principle which unites society the most.</p>
<p>  I will now proceed to say a few words about the more prominent
of those ranged round and on the turf, who, if they are not actively
its patrons, associate with each other more or less directly under its
auspices. I do not exaggerate the charms of the pastime-all I say
is that it is one which serves as a social focus. One of its presidents
is the largest and wealthiest of London landlords, the Duke of
Westminster, an altogether exemplary peer in every relation of
life, with a clean-made figure, spare, and even thin, good features,
of a somewhat rigid type, looking perhaps generally less like the
ideal of an English noble than of a man of business. His manner
is reserved, his hospitalities are judiciously dispensed. He is Whig
or Liberal in politics, zealous to promote anything which may
conduce to the social benefit of the masses.</p>
<p>  The Duke of Beaufort is a peer of a different sort. The
possessor of a racing stud, he is more largely interested in hunting
and in four-in-hand driving than the Duke of Westminster. He
has no town residence, living in apartments hard by St. James's
Park.  At Badminton, his country seat in Gloucestershire, he
keeps open house. He is the elderly Alcibiades of the theatrical
profession, and he is not unknown at the coulisses of the burlesque
theatres. A genial, open-handed representative of the English
country squire, with the titles of a great peer and the top-dressing
of a man about town.</p>

<pb n="64" id="p.64">



 <p> The Duke of Portland is not yet thirty years of age. Before he
succeeded, six years ago, to his title, he was a captain in the Foot
Guards, with only the ordinary allowance of a young English
gentleman in that position.</p>
<p>  Among others who belong to this category are also most or all
of those of whom I have said something in treating of the Prince
of Wales and his friends-Lord Rosebery, Lord Rosslyn, Mr. Henry
Chaplin, Mr. Henry Calcraft, Lord Alington, Sir George Chetwynd,
and Sir Frederick Johnstone. The last two are sportsmen pure and
simple. Without their stables and their race-meeting they would
have no occupation. Each has figured in well-known passages of
English social history. Sir Frederick Johnstone has won and lost
heavily; Sir George Chetwynd has been on the whole successful.
These are each of them Englishmen of the type whom you may
admire at Monte Carlo, not necessarily playing high, but enjoying
life exceedingly, and always in smart company.</p>
<p>  Lord Rosebery is much more than an owner of race-horses. He
is now a Cabinet Minister. He seldom sees his stud, and will
perhaps soon cease to take more than a theoretical interest in its doings.
Yet he is, while never speculating, a capital judge of a horse. His
purchases have been judicious, and some years ago, after having
seen one of his stable, in which he had always believed, victorious
in a match on Newmarket Heath, he made, a little later in the same
day, a telling and eloquent speech in the House of Lords. Lord
Rosebery possesses everything which can make existence happy
and distinguished.</p>
<p>  His alliance with the house of Rothschild by marriage placed at
his disposal a fortune which if not colossal-and in England all
men having anything are popularly credited with three times
as much as they have-is sufficient. He is young as age is now
computed, and looks younger than he is. He has excellent health
and a capital appetite. He is endowed with abilities which are not
merely great, but of a kind which is exceptional in England, and
yet which is peculiarly acceptable to those amid whom his career
is passed. At Eton, to which he was devoted, as at Oxford, he
never displayed great proficiency in the studies of the place; but
he had no sooner shaken the dust of school and college off his feet
than he applied himself to the learning without which public men
in England never make an enduring mark. When he was little
more than five-and-twenty he had become sufficiently encyclopaedic



<pb n="65" id="p.65">

to deliver the opening address at that meeting of British savants
known as the Social Science Association.</p>
<p>But it is not study which has made Lord Rosebery what he is.
He is by the happy gift of nature witty and singularly light in
hand. He can instruct his hearers, but he never bores them. He
never proses. His sense of fun is exceedingly quick and happy,
but there is nothing uproarious in his merriment. It is indeed
chastened even to the point of severity. The cause of laughter in
others, he rarely laughs himself. His faculty of suppressing any
emotion of fun makes his fun funnier. His drollery is the more
irresistible because his droll things are said with a countenance of
gravity and in tones almost solemn and austere. Then, too, though
his presence is not imposing, it abounds in dignity. He might and
occasionally does venture to enunciate sentiments, and even to
crack jokes, which his company appreciate the better because of
the calm and serious manner in which they are uttered.</p>
<p>  Lord Rosslyn is a nobleman of a different kind. Older, not of
keener intellect, but of sharper and more habitually exercised
business powers, distingue in appearance, with something of the vieille
moustache in his face and presence, a certain swagger or insolence
of manner compatible with perfect dignity; with the aristocratic
affectation of voice, and an expression of the eye which, when it is
directed at a stranger, says as plainly as words, "Who the devil
are you?" Lord Rosslyn is by taste sportsman and poet, but his
views of life are less those of the poet than of the sportsman. The
impression which he conveys to his acquaintances and friends is
that of being perpetually on the lookout for the main chance. He
has as good an eye for a bargain as he has for a horse. He has
always something to suit some special requirement of your own, or
he knows of somebody else who is in that position.</p>
<p>  Here is a specimen of his pleasant insinuating and thoughtful
manner.</p>
<p>  "Ah! my dear fellow, so glad to see you. Staying in town a
bit?"</p>
  <p>"Yes."</p>
<p>  "Think you asked me to dine with you last week? No? A
mistake, then. Perhaps you have not a cook; perhaps you want a
cook: if so, I can send you the best cook in the world."</p>
<p>  And so on. Lord Rosslyn is or would be a universal provider, like
a London tradesman in a bourgeois quarter. Whether it is a chef


<pb n="66" id="p.66">



or a secretary, a stud or a perambulator, Lord Rosslyn can assist
you to get the very thing you want on the most advantageous
terms. To those whom he meets on a footing of equality Lord
Rosslyn is amusing, the best fun in the world. To his inferiors he
is arrogant. Yet he means no evil; it is simply his idiosyncrasy.
He is a kind-hearted, chivalrous, and cultivated gentleman, with a
wide acquaintance of the world, and with liberal ideas of comfort
and grandeur.</p>
<p>  Mr. Henry Chaplin is another personage of importance in London
society, a connecting link between the worlds of society, politics,
and sport. He appears to take as his model the late Lord George
Bentinck, who was the champion of the Protectionist party in
Parliament when Free Trade was being pressed forward, and who was
also a mighty patron of the turf. There is a mixture in Mr.
Chaplin's bearing of geniality and pomposity which will be found by no
means unpleasant. He has had his crosses, vexations, even his
serious troubles in life. But his disappointments and his suffering,
deep as they have been, have not permanently embittered him.
He denounces his political opponents in Parliament, but there is no
malignity in his invective. His oratorical manner is heavy, his voice
sonorous, his sentences rotund. He reminds one alternately of a
school-boy declaiming his theme, and an evangelical clergyman
proclaiming the doom of the scarlet lady of Babylon from his pulpit.
He has all the instincts and takes interest in all the avocations of
the country gentleman. Of practical politics he is ignorant; he
calls himself a Tory.</p>
<p>  I now pass to a character perhaps the most ubiquitous in the
polite life of the United Kingdom. Mr. Henry Calcraft is no
connection of the eminent hangman of that name recently deceased.
In society, indeed, you will often hear him spoken of as the
hangman, but then that is only society's fun. It is difficult to say for
what nature intended this gentleman-detective agent or squire of
dames, mentor or minister, ambassador or clerk, director-in chief
of a nation's destinies or a commission agent. He has now been
some thirty years in London society, knows every one, goes
everywhere, and is at home everywhere. He may be bracketed with
Mr. Philip Currie as a professional and indefatigable diner-out.
His face wears a perpetual smile, which often breaks into a not
very musical laugh. His manner is beamingly abrupt and fidgety;
his body is in a constant state of spasmodic motion, and his shirts



are not made as well as his friends might desire. He jerks out his
comments in a ragged sort of fashion, and, unless he has a
particular reason for being interested in what his companion, man or
woman, may be saying to him, he never seems to be paying any
attention to you, but to be grudging you the time which the talk
takes, as if he might be more profitably employed with some one
else. Mr. Calcraft, however, is a favorite and a privileged one.
He has received the imprimatur of society, and he passes current
everywhere. He is received by the very highest, by society's
chosen king, the Prince of Wales, and by all the lesser luminaries
of the English social constellation.</p>
<p>  The fashionable world in England may be accused of fickleness,
but it is really loyalty personified. It no more dismisses an old
favorite than it hoots the actor whom it has been its habit to
applaud from the stage. Knowledge is power; and Mr. Calcraft is
courted and powerful because, knowing so much, lie is reputed to
know even more than he actually does. It was this credit for
social omniscience which some years ago caused him to be selected
seriously by several competent social judges as the probable editor,
when the post was vacant, of the greatest of English newspapers.
Perhaps fully to explain this circumstance, I should say that lie has
not only his finger always on the pulse of the upper classes, but
that he has much official experience, and is reckoned one of the
most sagacious servants of the Crown among English civilians.
It may be that he is now engaged in writing his memoirs; but if
they are as truthful as doubtless they will be comprehensive, their
publication will assuredly be posthumous.</p>
<p>  I pass on now to a gentleman who for the purposes of society is
in much the same category as Mr. Calcraft-Sir Henry James.
His profession is that of a lawyer. His ambitions and his aptitudes
are those of a statesman. Technically he is accounted the head of
the common-law bar of England, and by precedent and tradition
he would, unless some special arrangement were made, be appointed
to the Lord Chancellorship should that august post fall vacant
while his party is in power. He is clever in his calling, with a
penetrating intellect, and a manner not more dogmatic than it is,
I suppose, inevitable for lawyers in a position of authority to
develop. He has, too, no mean eye to statesmanlike effects, and
occasionally, either in the House of Commons or in the country,

<pb n="68" id="p.68">



he delivers a speech on some political question of the hour which
sets people talking and thinking-which makes its mark.</p>
<p>  But on the occasions that you will encounter him, Sir Henry
James is above everything the man of society and of the world.
His deportment is not wanting in a certain forensic flavor. He
seems to be conscious of the presence of a judge and a jury, even
though the latter should be only a jury of matrons and maids.
Wherever you find Mr. Calcraft, there you may expect to see Sir
Henry James. There is, too, a kind of personal resemblance
between them. Each has the same square-cut head, each the same
vigilant eye, each the same capacity for mastering at a glance the
general character of the company in which he is placed. Sir
Henry James, however, shrewd and profound jurisconsult as he
is, is more than Mr. Henry Calcraft, whose heart is not, I should
think, his most vulnerable point, a creature of impulse. His
manner is apt to be uneasy and restive. That is not so much because
his intellect is overburdened with cares as because he is torn with
emotions, some professional and some social, which he is anxious
to suppress. These are his little peculiarities, and they endear him
to society. The finest and most fashionable of ladies will tell you
he is a "dear creature." He is equally popular with men.
Perhaps that is because he is so general a favorite with their wives
and sisters.</p>
<p>  But that is only a partial explanation. He is himself no mean
sportsman, and he provides excellent sport for others. He manages
to devote several weeks in every year to shooting in the Scotch
Highlands. He can bring down his due allowance of grouse, and
occasionally does considerable execution among the deer. Then
he is the proprietor of some very capital coverts within easy
distance of London, and when his legal duties compel him to be in
town during the late weeks of autumn he organizes
shootingparties with great success, and royalty itself slaughters his
pheasants with its breech-loader.</p>

<p>  As I have just made mention of no less a person than the
Attorney-General, I will say something more about the legal luminaries
who are to be encountered in London society. It is not my business
to compose a little treatise for public edification on the subject of
the legal profession, which, as far as I have been able to observe,
consists principally of gentlemen who have nothing to do, and of
whom no one hears anything; secondly, of gentlemen who have a
great deal to do, but who are for social purposes unknown; thirdly,
of lawyers who combine success or eminence in their calling with
social notoriety. The lawyer who belongs to either of the two first
categories may be an estimable person, but is indistinguishable,
from the point of view I can alone take now, from any other variety
of hard-working Briton. Who wants to know where or how the
great pundit of the Chancery Bar, Mr. Jones, lives? or what is the
appearance, and what are the ideas, of his scarcely less successful
rival, Mr. Robinson? To the ordinary member of society these are,
and will always be, names. It is better that I should describe a few
of the gentlemen learned in the law to whom you are likely to be
presented in the course of your pilgrimage through society in
London.</p>
<p>  I shall begin with the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Coleridge, who
enjoys the fame of being the best conversationalist and the most
agreeable companion at a dinner-table. On his private virtues I
will forbear to dwell. He is pious and thrifty; he is a widower;
<pb n="70" id="p.70">



he is a High Churchman, a great scholar; he reads novels, but is
generally believed never to have looked at or heard of any
newspaper except the Times. He is the friend of Mr. Henry Irving, but
he was never acquainted with the name of Mr. Corney Grain, a
delightful drawing-room entertainer, until that gentleman had been
brought before his notice officially. Lord Coleridge is fond of the
theatres, but the theatres which he does not personally visit are to
him as if they were not. He knows the Haymarket and the
Lyceum, but of the Gaiety and the Globe-I select the names at random
-he would, I suspect, putting on that air of innocent amazement of
which he is a master, profess himself in a state of "unqualified
nescience."</p>
<p>  This peculiarity on his part may at first surprise you a little. It
will cease to surprise you when you know him somewhat better,
and have acquired an insight into his bland irony. I am not quite
certain whether, if you mentioned to him you were going to see the
Derby or the Ascot Cup run for, he would not look at you with
benign and wondering curiosity, and then ask you whether these
hippic contests took place in England.</p>
<p>  I have often, years ago, heard his Lordship examine or
crossexamine witnesses in court, and if ever any individual assumed
with perfect success the manner of the heathen Chinee, which,
according to Mr. Bret Harte, was childlike and bland, that
individual was the present Lord Chief Justice of England. Other
counsel, when they found the man or woman before them in the
witnessbox stubbornly stupid or reticent, would attempt to browbeat and
bully. Sir John Coleridge, as he was then, would shake his head
with a seraphic smile in disapproval of so inhuman a proceeding,
and would wait his turn. He went upon an entirely different tack.
He never bullied, never hurried or flustered any one, but he got out
of every one the exact thing he wanted, and by dint of sheer suavity
inveigled those whom he interrogated into making the most suicidal
admissions.</p>
<p>  The way in which he accomplished it was this. He treated the
witness before him not merely as a gentleman or a lady, but as a
kind of superior being who had at his or her disposal just the
information to extricate him from an appalling difficulty. " My good
friend," he said, or seemed to say, " pray help me. I really know
nothing about this matter. My own faculties are exceedingly
limited. I am a simple searcher after truth, and I respectfully pray
                           <pb n="71" id="p.71">

for your assistance. Let me proceed to ask you in my own
unsophisticated way a few modest questions." When those modest
questions had been put and, as they invariably were, answered in
the exact way in which the questioner anticipated and designed, the
prisoner at the bar, if it was a hanging case and Sir John Coleridge
was against him, was a dead man. He felt the hempen cord tighten
round his neck, and turned pale and sick.</p>
<p>  Of its kind this is the highest sort of art I have ever seen
displayed in a court of justice. I am not surprised that Lord Coleridge
should be a great patron of actors. If he has learned something from
them, they may have perfected their education by studying him;
for he, indeed, was, and is, the greatest actor of all. To sum up
his character, I should say that Lord Coleridge was, while having
a consummate eye to artistic effect, a little too obviously artificial.
His voice is too dulcet to be quite natural; his conversation too
primly eloquent to flow spontaneously; his anecdotes too much
elaborated, and, I am constrained to say, not unfrequently bearing
too close a resemblance to stories which have long since become
classical, to have the air of genuineness. His Lordship, in fact,
conveys the idea that there is a good deal in the background which
he does not find it convenient to bring prominently forward, and
yet which is just as much a part of the man himself, and of his life,
as the impressive personality and sententious sagacity or ornate
instructiveness which sum up the idea conceived of him by society.</p>
<p>  Contrast with Lord Coleridge another English judge well known
in what are called fashionable and sporting circles-Sir Henry
Hawkins. They designate him a hanging judge because it is not
his habit to treat crime as merely the abnormal development of
virtue, or to commiserate thieves and murderers as irresponsible
lunatics. Facts are to him what ideas are to the Lord Chief Justice.
The latter has the spirit of a law-reformer, but then he thinks that
no legal reform can be worth having which is not first approved by
his own conscience; that is to say, Lord Coleridge is perpetually
engaged in the attempt to construct a new legal code which shall
have precedence over any code in existence out of his own
subjective notions of right and wrong. His conscience--he holds with
the High Church divines-is the image of God reflected within him.
Its verdicts, therefore, are infallible and absolute. Consequently,
anything he can do to twist the laws of man into conformity with
the laws of God-otherwise with the ideas of Lord Chief Justice
<pb n="72" id="p.72">



Coleridge-is calculated to promote the dignity of law and the
moral improvement of the human race.</p>
<p>  Sir Henry Hawkins is entirely free from any of these judicial
sentimentalisms. The object of the law, as he understands it, is to
put down crime, to be a terror to evil-doers. This object it cannot
effect unless it treats criminals as criminals, and not as the proteges
of the hopeful experimentalist in social ethics. I confess I never
look at Lord Coleridge and then at Sir Henry Hawkins when I
happen to meet them-which is exceedingly seldom-at the same
dinnertable without being reminded of the screen-scene in the "School for
Scandal." Lord Coleridge appears to me the Joseph Surface of that
episode, which elicits from his brother Charles the ironical
observation, "There is nothing so noble as a man of sentiment." Sir Henry
Hawkins is the Sir Peter Teazle, who bluntly interposes with the
"Oh, damn your sentiments!" But then Sir Henry Hawkins is not,
as Lord Coleridge is, a metaphysician, a theologian, a scholar, a
nineteenth-century Chrysostom. He is only a first-rate lawyer, a
clear-sighted judge of evidence, with an intellect which acts as an
acid solvent to cant of all sorts-a man of the world who has no
wish to pose as a latter-day edition of a father of the early Christian
Church, a Greek sophist, or a mediaeval anchorite.</p>
<p>  Again, Sir Henry Hawkins does not boast the possession of a great
uncle who was so wholly impossible as Samuel Taylor
Coleridgepoet, mystic, religious dreamer, and entirely untrustworthy in every
relation of life. When Sir Henry Hawkins has done his day's work
he takes a stroll with a terrier of a particularly sporting type; and
this over, dines at the Turf Club, or wherever else his engagements
and inclinations may prompt him. Whither Lord Coleridge retires,
if he has not to keep a dinner appointment with prelates or with
titled laymen more severe in their notions than prelates themselves,
I have not the faintest idea.</p>
<p>  Among the other judges who are to be met with in London
society the most notable perhaps are Mr. Baron Huddleston, Mr.
Justice Stephen, and the Master of the Rolls, Sir Baliol Brett. The
last of these is on the Bench a man of singular acumen, gifted with
an extraordinary memory, with a marvellous capacity to seize the
points that are of real importance, and with a remarkable knack of
continuously illustrating and emphasizing the line of argument he
has from the first resolved to maintain. He sees far and he sees
clearly, but he never sees either to the right or to the left. His

<pb>

appearance is in his favor, and eloquent of his prosperity. There
is too much of refinement and intellectual power in his face not to
render it impressive. He is a man of distinction and dignity, and
though in drawing-rooms one might think that his first object was
to produce a favorable impression on ladies of title, young and old,
though he has some of the conceits and affectations of a
superannuated petit maitre, every one perceives immediately that he is far more
than he pretends to be. Sleek and florid one may think him, and
he is. Talk five minutes to him, and, after he has gratified his
vision by looking down on his jewelled fingers and his well-trimmed
nails, you will discover that the Master of the Rolls is a person of
rare shrewdness and sagacity, and of wide and varied knowledge.</p>
<p>  While Sir Baliol Brett might be taken easily for any person rather
than a judge, Mr. Baron Huddleston and Mr. Justice Stephen wear
the judge conspicuously, ostentatiously on their shirt-fronts. Not,
indeed, in the same manner. There are, perhaps, no two men in
London society, and certainly no two judges, who are more
diametrically dissimilar.  Although Mr. Baron Huddleston expends
his energies on his profession, and he lays out his whole life with
a paramount regard to the duties imposed on him by the Bench,
he does not live forgetful of society or its claims; and in his
scheme of existence the polite world, of which he is an
acknowledged ornament, occupies a prominent place.  He married the
daughter of the late and the sister of the present Duke of St. Albans.
He is thus honored with the patent of a brevet nobility. He has
shown much acuteness in discovering that he is more important
and diverting in society in proportion as he utilizes for its benefit
the special experiences he has acquired as a judge. His
conversation is free from trivial banalities.</p>
<p>  In a word, he is interesting because he speaks of what he knows
and of what others do not, yet in such a way that he is never
obscure or unintelligible.  Experts have more authority than is
well for themselves or for the rest of mankind in England. Nor
do I know a greater weariness to the flesh than a specialist
discoursing on some topic of which he is supposed to possess the
monopoly. Mr. Baron Huddleston has all the advantages of alegal
specialist, and none of his drawbacks. He never obtrudes his
professional experiences. He never throws them away. He
economizes them, introducing them just when and where he perceives
that they may be subservient to the general conversational good

<pb n="74" id="p.74">



of the community. He will spin you legal and judicial yarns by
the yard if lie is quite certain that there is a real demand for them.
But in general society he is content to give just a judicial flavor
to the conversation exactly as the late Bishop of Winchester, Dr.
Wilberforce-and the two men have a great deal in common
redundant-was an adept in giving an ecclesiastical or episcopal flavor
to it. A judge or a bishop in society ought, in my opinion, to be
what onion is in a salad or garlic in an omelette-it should scarcely
be detected, and yet it should animate the whole.</p>
<p>  Mr. Justice Stephen does not, any more than Mr. Baron
Huddleston, aggressively remind those about him that he is a judge. But
then he does not condescend to trifles. He has no small-talk, and
one can as readily imagine an elephant dancing a minuet as Fitz-
James Stephen, to call him by the name which seems most familiar
to his friends, engaged in the free give-and-take of casual
conversation. He is above all things a professor, a homilist, a superior
creature. He must have a thesis, a text, an audience. Give him
now a verse from a poet or an incident in a novel-he is
wonderfully well read in the romances of Victor Hugo-an ethical
paradox, or a specious commonplace; give him, I say, any one of these
things, and you will hear an interesting little lecture quite worthy
of a mechanics' institute. He wants, indeed, lightness of touch.
Nasmyth hammers are sometimes indispensable, but they have not
superseded nut-crackers; and Mr. Justice Stephen is the
embodiment of the force, though it is not always quite as delicately
adjusted with him as in the original, of the former of these two
implements.</p>
<p>  What could you expect, however, when you look at the man?
A head of enormous proportions is planted, with nothing
intervening except an inch-and-a-half neck, upon the shoulders of a
giant. Force is written upon every line of his countenance, upon
every square inch of his trunk. He is not a particularly engaging
person, but a very impressive one.  The genius of the Anglo-
Saxon race is embodied in men of this stamp.  He lacks
geniality and play of fancy, but in their stead he has a grim and
neverflagging perception of what he means and what he wants. He is
not only a worker whose sole form of amusement is a variety of
work, he is probably never conscious of fatigue. It is not so far
back that he went to India, and since the days of Macaulay's
visit to that portion of the British Empire no man ever labored


<pb n="75" id="p.75">

in India as Fitz-James Stephen did. Ordinary mortals of a less
robust frame and less heroic powers of concentration visit
Hindustan and partially succumb to the enervating influences of the
climate. Stephen was far above all that sort of thing. He had
not voyaged four thousand miles from England to do nothing.
He accomplished marvels of industry, and he filled his purse.
Shortly after his return he was made a judge, and here he is in
England to-day, treating toil as if it were a pastime, and, when not
considering knotty cases or delivering weighty judgments in court,
amusing himself with writing discourses on any subject which,
provided it be sufficiently stiff, he can discover in the borderland
between metaphysics and law.</p>
<p>Many other judges than these there are, to say nothing of
counsel learned in the law, who are after their modest fashion
constellations in the firmament of London society. But they all twinkle
in nearly the same fashion, and it would be a little tedious to
describe the various degrees of radiance which they shed. Some of
them, like Mr. Justice Grove, are eminent men of science. Lord
Justice Bowen is a judge who, widely differing from any of those
already mentioned, is a persona grata to London society. The
youngest of the illustrious potentates of the High Court of Appeal,
he represents the influences and the culture of the most approved
Oxford school. Legal and judicial subjects, as a social talker, he
eschews; nor are the mere frivolities of society, fond of society
though he is, to his taste. He discusses matters of art and
literature, blue china and science, with the impartiality of a philosopher
and the precision of a professor. His voice has the academic ring,
and his appearance is of a kind that one instinctively connects
rather with an ecclesiastic or a schoolmaster than a judge.</p>
<p>  As for the remaining occupants of the judicial bench, they are
not for the most part personages in London society. If you sit
next at dinner to any well-informed and highly educated
gentleman who is either particularly outspoken or particularly reserved
in his comments, who cavils at much, or who commits himself to
nothing, the chances are either that that gentleman is a judge or
that he is a very eminent lawyer. Unless there is some particular
reason to induce them to do so, the last thing which they will
discuss is-and it is extremely natural that this should be the
casetheir own professional avocations. They are sportsmen and
whistplayers, like Mr. Charles Russell; or men of society and patrons of
<pb n="76" id="p.76">



the theatre, like Mr. Montagu Williams; or students of the seamy
side of human nature, like Mr. Henry Poland. The great bulk of
them have not characteristics even as definite as these. They are
perfectly colorless, and the general tendency of London society is
to reduce not only them but all professional men to a dead level of
monotony.</p>
<p>  London society is, indeed, as great a leveller as Death itself, and
professional men who are recognized in London society owe their
position, with some exceptions, not to their eminence in their own
callings, but to their capacity for being absorbed into their
environment. This is true of professional men of all kinds in their
social capacity. Thus there is in London society no military caste.
Military officers, or, to speak more accurately, gentlemen bearing
military rank, abound. But great numbers of them are retired, or
on half-pay, waiting, often hopelessly, for active employment.
The true soldier type is somewhat of a bird of passage; now in
London, now in the remote wilds of Africa or Afghanistan, now
re-appearing, to be feted and petted on every side. The successful
soldier is welcomed at Windsor or in the most exclusive coteries.
His mantel-piece is crowded with cards of invitation, and the Prince
of Wales secures his election to the Marlborough Club. Lord
Wolseley has society at his feet. Lady Wolseley shares in the
conquest, having rendered her lord and master infinite service by her
tact, industry, and strict attention to the business of calls,
correspondence, and entertainment.  The Wolseleys are met
everywhere.</p>
<p>  A keen soldier, whose first and last thought is for his profession,
Lord Wolseley is also a thorough man of the world. He likes to
be supposed to know everything, to do everything, to be capable of
everything. The last bit of gossip, the last political canard, flows
glibly from his lips; he is a dilettante in art, and will readily
preside at a dinner of literary men. Bright-eyed and vivacious, he
talks fluently of the social life around him as one behind the
scenes and deep in its mysteries. But a passing remark, a chance
question, a single hint, will draw him out directly on the subject
he has nearest his heart. Ever ready to discuss military matters,
and with a freedom that has won him at times no little ill-will,
Lord Wolseley is most tenacious of his opinions, and the
uncompromising champion of the new institutions which he has helped
to create, and which are still on their trial. Those who hold opposite
                               <pb n="77" id="p.77">

 views may expect no quarter; comrades of all ranks, high
and low alike, come under his lash, a reactionary royal duke no
less than the careless subaltern.</p>
<p>  To those who are of his way of thinking, and who will support
him through thick and thin, he is a stanch and true friend.
There are many such men whom he has himself selected and
pushed to the front, and who have repaid his appreciation by steady
and unstinting devotion. It is pleasant to see him in the midst of
his own followers. They are his chosen intimates and associates;
he is frank and cordial with them, free-spoken, as a comrade, yet
retaining, although never seeming to claim, their respect.
At one time the epithet Wolseleyite, as applied to the Wolseley
school, was employed as a term of reproach. In the future it may
be regarded as a term of distinction, for the men whose names are
on every tongue when England's frequent wars are in progress are
those who began or graduated under Wolseley. Sir Evelyn Wood
has a reputation of his own; but the mobile, easily excited young
general, fluent of speech, prompt in action, with the habitually
grave expression of a man who has pondered deeply upon the
mysteries of the higher life, would not have climbed the ladder so
rapidly had not he cast in his fortunes with the conqueror of King
Coffee Calcali. Sir George Greaves, a blunt and brusque soldier,
was the close ally and adviser of Lord Wolseley in the Ashanti
campaign. Sir John McNeil is another Wolseleyite, who owes to
his war-services the favor of his sovereign. There is little of the
silken, supple courtier about him; he is only too eager to exchange
the court for a camp, as now, when his soldierly character, aided
perhaps by royal influence, have sent him as a brigadier to Suakin.
He is no doubt useful as an equerry, but what the Queen likes
best in him is his Scotchman's love of sport. One of the liveliest
of the Queen's canine pets is a Scotch terrier, the gift of Sir John
McNeil.</p>
<p>  Long ago Sir Thomas Baker attached himself to Lord
Wolseley's fortunes, and has risen with them; a smooth-spoken,
pleasant-mannered man, acceptable in every drawing-room, and much
repandu in London society when not actively engaged abroad.</p>
<p>  Perhaps the most remarkable of Wolseley's followers, the one
who has risen most rapidly, and who will do best if he escape the
spears of the Soudanese warriors, is Sir Redvers Buller. His
promotion gives the lie to the common opinion that speedy advancement
<pb n="78" id="p.78">



 is denied to real merit in the British army. Fifteen years
ago Redvers Buller was a lieutenant in a rifle regiment. To-day
he is a general officer with reasonable hopes of a peerage if he lives
many years more. He is a soldier heart and soul: he would not
relinquish his profession even when the death of an elder brother
gave him the succession to wide estates. Nothing holds him back
when there is fighting on hand; neither the cares of a country
place nor a newly wedded wife. Abrupt, even discourteous in his
manner, he impresses you with his bold, uncompromising spirit.
Diffidence does not enter into his composition; he is so self-reliant
that he would be thought merely conceited if a weaker man. His
value is now generally recognized; but even when fewer people
believed in him, Buller fully believed in himself. This excessive
self-confidence is not a pleasing trait, backed up as it is by a
contempt he is often at no pains to conceal for the best efforts of
others. Buller may be strong enough to despise popularity, but it
is certain that, although respected, feared even, he is not greatly
liked by his brethren in arms.</p>
<p>  Lieutenants like Sir Redvers Buller help to keep alive and
embitter the opposition to his chief. Wolseley's success has gained
him many foes; enemies public and private, who deny his talents,
and would scarcely regret his failure in the very arduous
undertaking he has now in hand. A very open and unfriendly critic is
Sir Edward Hamley, whose hostility dates from Tel-el-Kebir. His
bitter feelings found vent after the campaign in a public print.
In no army but the British would a subordinate divisional general
have dared to pass such an affront upon his commander. But
Hamley aspires to be an oracle; he affects an European reputation
as a military man of letters. And he is always ready to express his
views with the vehemence of conviction. His constant attitude is
that of the genius unappreciated. A pretty knack in composition,
and a pedantic but not profound acquaintance with military
literature, seems to have encouraged him in the belief that he is an
undeveloped Napoleon. Only opportunity was needed, he thought;
yet when the chance came, in Egypt, what did he do with it? Now
he is consumed with inward jealousy of every competitor, old and
young, and vents his spite in scathing invective on all.  Sir
Edward is in consequence an agreeable and amusing companion,
caustic, a trifle too ponderous in his talk, and too formal in his
satirical epigrams, but listened to gladly by all who like to hear



<pb n="79" id="p.79">

their friends abused. He is something of a bon vivant, and
indefatigable as a diner-out.  A comfortable look of embonpoint is
growing upon him. It is little likely that Hamley, although con
vinced of his own superior capacity, will be actively employed
again. Were he less overbearing, less intolerant, less ill-natured,
he might give useful advice upon general questions, but he is hardly
suited for command. He may soon, indeed, be included among
the "has beens," like Lord Napier, Sir "Dan" Lysons, Sir Alfred
Horsford, or Sir Charles Ellice.</p>
<p>  The last of these, possessor of a substantial income and of a
hospitable house in Eaton Square, long filled a large space in London
life. Fortune has always smiled upon Sir Charles. As a young
man the massacre of a hecatomb of brother-officers at
Chillianwallah, while he was absent on the staff at Malta, pushed him at one
stroke to the top of the regimental tree. He fought an ill-
conceived and badly executed action in the Indian mutiny, which
would have ruined another, but was with Ellice the stepping-stone
to the best appointments in the service. He has passed from post
to post, from one command to another. Essentially a persona
grata to the Duke of Cambridge, he enjoyed the fullest share of
that august person's patronage, and was in succession Military
Secretary, Quartermaster- General, and Adjutant-General at the
Horse Guards. It is difficult for an outsider to realize his fitness
for the highest staff employment. Extremely suave in manner and
very dignified in deportment, his mental calibre is mediocre, and
his chief talent has been displayed in picking the brains of capable
subordinates. This was the secret of his unwavering
championship of Colonel Home, and the poignancy with which he regretted
that excellent officer's premature death.</p>
<p>  Strange to say, the best military talent does not generally gather
about the Horse Guards. Lord Wolseley's influence, when in
power, may be effective in filling the junior posts with the best
coming men. But the seniors, the heads of departments, must,
before all things, be personally acceptable to the Duke. This sadly
limits the field of choice. Now and again the right man falls into
the right place, as when Sir Edmund Whitmore, urbane,
considerate, and as impartial as the exigencies of his place admitted, filled
the office of Military Secretary. The last appointment, that of Sir
Archibald Alison to succeed Lord Wolseley as Adjutant-General,
might seem an exception to the rule; but no one thrown into the

<pb n="80" id="p.80">



society of Sir Archibald Alison could credit him with commanding
capacity. So garrulous a man, one who laughs so readily and so
inanely at his own or any joke, cannot impress you with his power.
He has seen war, no doubt, and paid the penalty in his person; but
an empty sleeve, although an honorable record of service, is not a
convincing proof of power to lead.</p>
 <p> The narrow-minded official is to be seen in the man next him in
rank at the Horse Guards. Sir Arthur Herbert, the Quartermaster
General, has filled many minor posts satisfactorily, but he is weak
and irresolute, or his face belies him. Lord Chelmsford is another
English general of some social prominence, whose appearance
explains his want of success as a leader of men. Face and physique
both indicate feebleness of character. One can understand, after
listening to his verbose defence of the operations he conducted,
why the earlier phases of the Zulu war were not more brilliant.
So much straitness of vision, combined with such an inordinate
love of petty detail, would infallibly produce an incompetent
commander. They said of Lord Chelmsford in Africa, that he wished
to do everybody's work; he could stoop to help a fatigue-party pick
up stones from a road, but he was incapable of designing a great
strategical plan. Lord Chelmsford is most suited to the position in
which he is supposed to be happiest, that of senior assistant in the
organ-loft of St. Peter's, Eaton Square.</p>
 <p> General Crealock, again, has talents artistic rather than military.
He owed his first advancement to the happy caricatures that raised
a smile at Crimean head-quarters in days of dire disaster. Since
then he has wielded brush and pencil with unwearied assiduity and
much facility, but has never risen far above the amateur. But
little of the sportsman, he can yet draw a horse or a dog; without
any knowledge of anatomy, he can catch a likeness and copy the
human figure passably. His devotion to the arts has been
sedulously turned towards the decoration of his own person, General
Crealock being uniformly remarkable for a strange originality in
costume, mostly florid and quite independent of fashion. He made
long-waisted, long-tailed overcoats, tight trousers, and
broadbrimmed hats noticeable before the days of the mashers. He is
fond of garish colors in his dress; he has expended years of patient
pains on a curling beard, worn in despite of military regulations,
and a divinely waxed, interminably involuted corkscrew mustache.
All this has naturally occupied him too much to allow of any deep



<pb n="81" id="p.81">

and close study of his profession. He might have been useful in
the junior grades of the general staff, but as a leader in the field he
was a conspicuous failure. His groans from the Tugela, when
crying for the condiments still wanting to complete his commissariat,
made him the laughing-stock of Europe. A more enterprising and
more competent general would have organized his trains for himself;
at least he would have managed to advance somehow when his
cooperation was so urgently required.</p>
<p>  There are many soldiers in society without great military
pretensions who are still very typical of their class. Generals like
Barnard Hankey, a kindly, warm-hearted friend, beloved of
duchesses and welcome at cosey tea-tables, who might, had he seen
more service in the days when he was young, have gained higher
honors; " Charlie" Fraser, a glorified dragoon who has reached the
apotheosis of old dandydom, and whose glossy hats and inimitable
boot-varnish youthful plungers worship from afar; or "Tim"
Reilly, a gunner who has made no mark as a scientific artillerist,
but who has, nevertheless, a solid understanding concealed
somewhere in a somewhat too solid mountain of flesh. " Tim," though
uncomfortably overgrown, is not thick-headed; he can say shrewd,
sharp things, and he is not without honor among smart people.
Admirable as a raconteur, a noted jester and mime, General "Pug"
Macdonnell is happiest in gatherings where there are no
womenkind. "Pug" is one of the Prince of Wales's favorite henchmen;
Poins at a pinch, with good imitation of excellent wit, who will
keep dinner-table or smoking-room in a roar. But he does not
covet, nor has he ever achieved, much military renown. The
names of such men might be multiplied indefinitely; they fluctuate
between the Park and Pall Mall, and never put on uniform except
to go to Court, a duty which they perform religiously at least once
every season.</p>
<p>  The most hopeful sign for the future of the British army is the
soldierly spirit of the upper classes, which send so many to take
service in its ranks. Scions of the best families, the heads
themselves, are glad to bear the Queen's commission. The passion for
warlike adventure has been inherited through generations of
fighting ancestors, and these often fortunate youths, who might linger
amid the soft pleasures of London life, eagerly seek to share in
the dangers and hardships of any campaign. The British peerage
was well represented in the last battles in the Soudan. One earl,




Airlie, was Stewart's Brigade-Major; and Lord Airlie had already
proved his thoroughness as a soldier by accepting the laborious
duties of adjutant of his regiment, the 10th Hussars. Another
peer, Lord Cochrane, or more exactly Lord Dundonald, highly
distinguished himself at the battle of Abu Klea; a clever, thoughtful
youth, who, before he embraced the career of arms, had mastered
the intricacies of chemistry, experimental and applied.  Other
peers and peers' sons, notably Lord St. Vincent, have met their
death on recent hard-fought fields; many more cheerfully face exile
and hard knocks in search of reputation. Foremost among them
is Colonel Methuen, big, stalwart, handsome " Paul," an athlete in
frame and by predilection; skilled in self-defence, and a
masterhand with single-stick and foil. Paul Methuen is one of the
gentlest, sweetest-tempered of men, good as gold, universally popular
in London and in his profession. But he is ready for any rough
work that may offer anywhere. Just now he has turned a leader
of irregular horse on the South African frontier, whence he may
pass to the Upper Nile, or the rocky fastnesses of Afghanistan.
He is the exact opposite of the common ignorant conception of the
British guardsman, who, so far from being an indolent voluptuary,
is perhaps the most eager for active service of any of his
professional brethren.</p>
<p>  They are mostly capital soldiers, these gallant members of the
Household Brigade, and their merits are generally recognized. At
this moment a Guards General, Stephenson, commands in Lower
Egypt; another, Fremantle, was chief at Suakin, and is now a
brigadier under Graham. Ewart, a life-guardsman, somewhat
unfairly to light-cavalry officers perhaps, is in command of Graham's
cavalry. Dozens of others are clamorous candidates for
employment. Men like Edward Clive, Fitzroy, Crichton, or Moncrieff
might safely be entrusted with any important work. Others, like
George Villiers, now military attache in Paris, or Everard
Primrose, who, till he joined Lord Wolseley, held the same post in
Vienna, are excellently suited to represent our British army abroad.
Colonel Villiers has a silky, caressing manner which wins him
friends directly, and his handsome, engaging presence has secured
him more than one bonne fortune. Colonel Primrose seems older
than his years; his rather stern and impassive face wears a grave,
preoccupied look, but he talks well, and impresses you as a
thoughtful, sensible man of the world.  A third military attache


<pb n="83" id="p.83">

may be mentioned here, Colonel Swaine, who, until his health
broke down, had been acting as military secretary to Lord
Wolseley, but whose post is really at Berlin. The godson of the King of
the Belgians, Leopold Victor Swaine has many of the
characteristics of the highly-trained Continental officer; he is a fluent linguist
and has much of the German's solidity and thoroughness. With
such officers as these the reproach once levelled at the British army
has no longer any foundation in fact. It cannot well be said
nowadays that British soldiers are lions led by asses; at any rate,
under the new short-service system, the lions are but whelps, and
with the marked development of professional education the asses
have learned much wisdom.</p>
<p>British naval officers are drawn from the same sections of society
as those in the army, and, with due allowance for difference in
training and experience, display nearly identical characteristics.
Great fame has generally been denied them. They are generally
well bred and well informed, although apt in society to be bluff,
outspoken, exuberantly genial, at times a little too noisy, and
hearty. " Pim" Macdonald is one of this class; an intimate ally
and associate of the Prince of Wales, apt in repartee, well stocked
with quaint and curious anecdote, and ready to take a leading
part in any sports that may be afoot in the royal coterie. His
appearance is less that of the rough, weather-beaten sea-captain
than of the sleek physician or financier; with a handsome face,
a mobile eye, and a mouth which proclaims his character at a
glance. Admiral Wilson, again, who has a distinguished record of
services, and has given proofs of the highest personal courage, is
no less popular with the Heir-Apparent-a welcome guest at
Sandringham or Marlborough House. The future Earl of Shaftesbury,
Lord Ashley, is more remarkable perhaps for a very low-crowned
hat than brilliant services afloat, but lie is a kindly, warm-hearted
soul whom everybody likes. George Tryon, now Admiral on the
Australian station, is widely known, but less popular. The
overbearing manner of the man who, as Secretary to the Admiralty,
had long the prospects of his brother-officers in his hands does not
please or conciliate; and it may be doubted whether he will greatly
help forward the adjustment of pending delicate and difficult
colonial questions. " Fred " Maxse did a gallant thing in his youth,
and was long petted and made much of in society; but with years
he has developed a wildly radical, almost communistic, spirit which
<pb n="84" id="p.84">



has alarmed and estranged many friends. There is probably as
good stuff in the naval officer of to-day as when Britain really ruled
the seas; but he has hitherto lacked opportunity, and modern
science has so revolutionized his profession that he will not easily
maintain his pre eminence in future naval wars.</p>
<p>  There are many eminent divines and preachers in England.
Some of them are the centres of a little group of intimate admirers
and friends, but when they are in society their professional status
is practically relinquished, and they are recognized and respected,
not as clerics, but as highly educated and agreeable men. The late
Bishop Wilberforce did much by his own example to cement this
union between the Church and the world, or, as some might
uncharitably say, between religion, the flesh, and the devil. The late
Dean of Westminster, Arthur Stanley, as he was always called
affectionately by London society, contributed unintentionally and
in a different degree to the same result. There is no Anglican
ecclesiastic living to-day who discharges any of these functions.
Dr. Magee, the Bishop of Peterborough, has much of Wilberforce's
conversational happiness, as he has also of his oratorical power,
but in a harsher and heavier key. Canon Liddon and Dean Church
very seldom appear in society, and would resent the imputation of
being in the world, and of it, as Wilberforce and Stanley delighted
to be.</p>
<p>  Of course society in London being the most moral and
respectable in the world, dreading above all things the consequences of
those very scandals the incidents of which it discusses with such
avidity, naturally-and thus paying a tribute to the strength of the
democracy-holds in high esteem the Church as an institution and
the ordinances of religion. London is the only European capital
entirely given over to the rule of sabbatarianism. Of late years,
indeed, this despotism has been somewhat relaxed. The Sunday
dinner-parties, which were once confined almost to business
persons--lawyers, actors, and litterateurs--are now universal; as much
the vogue in the best houses known to society as on its Bohemian
borderland. The day, however, retains, notwithstanding the many
pleasanter innovations which have relieved its austerity, some of
the signs of its primitive sanctity. Most of the smart people go to
church, to the Chapel Royal, or to St. Margaret's, Westminster, if
they belong to the political set; and many other shrines are
specially set apart for society's elect. Even those who do not go to


<pb n="85" id="p.85">

church obligingly recognize in theory the obligation of going there
when they talk of, or take a part in, the after-church parade in
Hyde Park. It is astonishing how far the most atomic quantity of
the ecclesiastical leaven will reach, and how much of secular
indulgence it will condone. That hour and a half spent in a
Protestant temple earns for society the right to pass the remainder of
its day, whether in town or country house, exactly as it pleases;
beguiling the hours with flirtation or small-talk, piquet, ecarte,
poker, baccarat, or tennis.</p>
<p>  The least spiritually-minded of ladies in London society may
have a taste for dipping into devotional books, and even among
Protestants may have her own special "director." It is not,
perhaps, that she feels the want of these now, but she may feel the
want of them some day. That is the principle on which many
persons go to church. It is like drinking from a mineral spring at
a watering-place. One does not need it now, but one never knows
that it may not produce some good hereafter. Some ladies as well
as gentlemen there are with a passion for mysticism which the
functions and the faith whether of the Anglican or Roman
communion are not enough to gratify.  There is an English peer
who openly professes the faith of Mahomet. The propaganda of
Esoteric Buddhism and Spiritualism  has recently made marked
progress, and has afforded a career to several adventurous notoriety
hunters.</p>
<p>  But the teachers and preachers who belong to the more orthodox
and generally accepted creeds have, notwithstanding the advance of
these bizarre superstitions, lost none of their power. The Queen is
a theologian as well as a stateswoman, with some sympathy for
theological latitudinarianism, but thoroughly sound in her religious
views, with a bias in the direction of Scotch Presbyterianism, and
on the whole in favor of what in England is called Moderate
Churchmanship. The late Dr. Norman Macleod was a homilist
Her Majesty specially admired, and was said to have enjoyed her
spiritual confidence. The Prince of Wales is also, as I have
intimated elsewhere, a capital judge of a sermon, and fond of hearing
a good one. That perhaps explains why there exists in English
society a distinct feeling in favor of going to church.</p>
<p>  The most imposing figure among London ecclesiastics is that
of Cardinal Manning, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of
Westminster. Ascetic in appearance and in life, urbane and courtly in
<pb n="86" id="p.86">



manner, intense in his convictions, narrow in his views, fervid and
vehement in his pulpit oratory, he is seldom to be seen in any other
society than that of which the great Roman Catholic houses-the
Duke of Norfolk's, Lord Derby's, Lord Ripon's-are the centres.
A few years ago a certain Monsignor Capel, made famous by a
penand-ink portrait of him as Monsignor Catesby in one of Lord
Beaconsfield's novels, shot like a meteor through the social
firmament. His relations with Cardinal Manning were not fortunate,
and he has temporarily disappeared. Among Anglican prelates
there is none who fills anything like the same place in the social
system as was formerly occupied by Wilberforce, Bishop of
Winchester. The Archbishop of York has some qualifications for the
Court and the salon. Dr. Magee, Bishop of Peterborough, destined
by nature to be a great parliamentary debater or a great judge,
crowning his career with the Lord Chancellorship, is sometimes to
be met at dinner-tables, and has a gift of saying pungent things
in a witty and sparkling way. Archdeacon Farrar is the most
extensively admired of pulpit declaimers. His eloquence is
inexhaustible and ornate. He deluges his congregation with
magnificent words and splendid images. But his is the genius rather of
the popular journalist than of the traditional school of Anglican
preachers. Mr. Teignmouth Shore, a voluble and amiable
Irishman, has combined the mission of improving society and
advancing himself. He is a Court favorite, and exactly understands the
temper of the upper classes in England. He is the ornament of a
fashionable chapel in Mayfair, and his discourses are a melange of
religious and secular comment, a fusion of art, literature, and
science, dished up in the style of the popular journalist, presented
to his patrons in a pleasant and easily intelligible form.</p>
<p>  All this time the doctors have been waiting. Some of these
successfully, if unconsciously, carry their profession into the social
circles in which'they move. Before I give any instances of this, I
should like to point out the peculiarly favorable position which the
men of medicine occupy. The influences of the age are in their
favor. It is in England the epoch of introspection. The English
are always thinking that something is wrong with their morals or
with their conscience, with their digestion or with their lungs.
They are perpetually inditing, or causing others to indite, homilies
on the deterioration, physical or ethical, of their race. As a
matter-of-fact, perhaps nowhere in the world will you find men and


<pb n="87" id="p.87">

women in such perfect health as in London society. If it is not
polite to speculate much as to the welfare of their souls, they are
always soliloquizing on the condition of the carnal envelope of
those spiritual organs. In fact, the attention which was once-or
if it was not, ought to be-spent upon their ghostly sanity is now
spent upon their stomachs. This is the doctors' opportunity. And
since every one has his or her pet ailment, the physician is a power
to an extent to which, when what I have called introspection was
not quite so much the rage, was impossible.</p>
<p>  The influence of doctors on diet is everywhere conspicuous. It
is the fashionable thing for ladies and gentlemen in London society
to carry about with them a list of prohibited dishes and drinks,
very often rigidly to abstain from all in which they once most
lavishly indulged, because their doctors have placed these pleasures
of the palate under their ban.</p>
<p>  The disciplinary precepts of physicians must, I think, have had
a considerable effect upon the trade of wine-merchants. Yet, if
they have checked that commerce in some quarters, they have
expanded it in others. Indeed, there are certain doctors in London
to whom a peculiar vendor of wines is as necessary an appendage
as a chemist. If you consult one apostle of Galen he will tell you
to forswear everything except a port of a particular vintage,
procurable only at an address which he will give you, and which he
straightway proceeds to write down. Another oracle of the
profession admonishes you that if for the space of six months you
touch anything but a beverage concocted out of grapes grown in
some inaccessible vineyard in a remote corner of Europe you will
be a dead man. That wine, he confidentially adds, is the exclusive
specialite of a firm in the City, or the West End, which will not
supply casual customers with the precious fluid. You, however,
shall be, thanks to his recommendation, a privileged person. His
card-and here he gives you one-will be the "open sesame" to
the cellars which contain the true elixir of life-the one and only
antidote to gout and liver-complaint, dyspepsia, consumption, cold
in the head, and blue-devils.</p>
<p>  That London doctors can and often do make the fortune of
watering-places, or of places as barren of water as the Great Sahara,
there can be no doubt. Bath, whither I went some weeks ago, has
had quartered upon it for some time a large contingent of London
society. The town, which is one of the most beautiful in England,
<pb n="88" id="p.88">



is experiencing a blissful revival of its glories. Its mineral springs
have been brought into fashion again because the doctors, who
speak with authority, have discovered that all their ancient virtues
have returned to them. Other spots may ere long enjoy the same
good fortune. The enchanter, in the shape of the M.D. who has a
following, has but to wave his wand, pronounce his incantation,
and the spell is complete. It would be an excellent investment, if
one could ascertain betimes the localities destined to find favor in
the doctors' eyes, to buy up house property in the district.</p>
<p>  Curiously enough, the physicians who are chiefly responsible for
the asceticism now the vogue in many circles are they who mingle
most in society. I suppose there is no one who has terrified more
persons into total or partial abstinence from intoxicating fluids
than Sir Andrew Clark. Yet that distinguished doctor is
frequently to be met with at the dinner-tables of the great and wealthy.
Nor, so far as I have been able to observe, does he exclusively
restrict himself to some aerated water, qualified by the most trivial
infusion of Scotch whiskey. He is a shrewd student of human
nature, as well as, I doubt not, a considerable man of science-this
canny Aberdonian.</p>
<p>  Some years ago he conveyed to Mrs. Gladstone a deep impression
of his powers. Mr. Gladstone recognized in him a careful doctor
and a good High Churchman. The combination pleased the present
Prime Minister, and Sir Andrew Clark's fame and fortune were as
good as made. His happy faculty of oracular utterances, the
solemn aphorisms with which he clinches his counsel to his patients,
the sonorous platitudes with which he emphasizes the simplest of
sanitary maxims, his quick eye, the kind severity of his manner,
the air of judicial sympathy with which he interrogates those who
come to see him upon their maladies, the calm deliberation, the
systematic shunning of the semblance of haste-these are the
qualities which cause London society to repose confidence in Sir Andrew
Clark. Moreover he is, when encountered in the dining-rooms and
drawing-rooms of the metropolis, an agreeable and companionable
person, with plenty of anecdotes and a gift of humor, the point of
which is heightened by his Scotch accent. Sir Andrew Clark is a
typical physician of his period, justly confident, doubtless, in his
acquaintance with the British pharmacopoeia, but confident rather
in, and accomplishing more by, his comprehensive and microscopic
knowledge of human nature.</p>



<pb n="89" id="p.89">

<p>  Sir William Gull is endowed with all Sir Andrew Clark's
command of noble and sagacious sentiments. If his prescriptions
could be sometimes dispensed with, it is worth paying a couple of
guineas for them in order to store one's memory with the wise
saws and modern instances of which he is full. His presence is
more that of the ideal doctor than Sir Andrew Clark's. You could
not, wherever you might see him, mistake him for anything but a
doctor; whereas Sir Andrew might equally well be a lawyer, a
farmer, a school-master, or a parson. He plumes himself on his
power of probing the secret hearts of his patients to their lowest
depths by eagle glances and by pregnant and pithy pieces of
professional sententiousness, enunciated in a melodramatic undertone.
His manner is as perfectly calm and collected as is to be found in
phlegmatic England itself. He can be kind as well as courteous;
but whether he is simply the latter or whether he infuses into his
demeanor something of the former, nothing appears to proceed
from the spontaneous emotion of the instant-everything is
prearranged. If he is not as great a doctor as many hold him to be,
he is a marvellous piece of human machinery.</p>
<p>  The more purely social side of the medical profession is displayed
by men like Dr. Quain and Sir Oscar Clayton. The latter of these
I should pronounce without hesitation the nearest approach to the
Court physician of a century since, now extant. He is attached in his
professional capacity to the household of the Duke of Edinburgh;
but as it was once said of an historical head-master of Eton that
one could not help having a respect for a man who had whipped in
his day the whole bench of bishops, so one's admiration for Sir
Oscar Clayton is increased by the circumstance that he has
physicked, for more or less serious, more or less noble, or ignoble,
ailments, the principal members of the aristocracy of England. It
often occurs to me as I look upon this little knight of the
lancetwell stricken in years, well made up, radiant in hair-dyes and
cosmetics the secret of which rests with himself alone, deferential
and insinuating in manner, with all sorts of stories calculated to
suit every variety of audience, from a prelate to a demirep, at his
disposal-that the spirit of the courtly leech of the Grand Monarch
or of the Caroline restoration in England must be enshrined in
him.</p>
<p>  Of Dr. Quain, certainly one of the most distinguished children of
AEsculapius-alas! that the child should now be rapidly marching

<pb n="90" id="p.90">



towards the goal of septuagenarianism-it may be said that he
is a cheery, kindly, genial, and gifted Irishman first and a great
physician afterwards.  Heaven forbid that when I say this I
should hint anything like disparagement at that most worthy of
doctors, that most stanch, omniscient, and fluently conversational of
friends! Indeed, Dr. Quain is not only a Hippocrates of vast
experience and profoundly scientific attainments, but a medical writer
of the highest authority. He has produced within the last few
years an encyclopaedia of medical knowledge. How he found
time for such a chef-d'oeuvre is the standing wonder to his friends.
The explanation doubtless is that the doctor has an extraordinary
appreciation of the value of time and diet for industrial purposes.
He never loses an hour or a minute. The evenings that he gives to
society recruit his energies for toil, and there is, I am informed,
authentic testimony on record that Dr. Quain, after an evening
spent with convivial friends, prosecutes his editorial labors, literary
or scientific, till the bell rings for matins-a religious service that he
usually makes a point of attending.</p>
<p>  He is a perfect treasure-house of miscellaneous anecdotes, equally
charming and various as host or guest, with a professional
acquaintance of men who have made their mark in all departments of life,
which has usually ripened into a personal friendship unprecedented,
I should think, in the history of the Royal College of Physicians.
Several decades of London life have not destroyed his rich native
brogue, but rather chastened it. He takes that easy view of life
peculiar to prosperous, and for that matter unprosperous, natives
of the Emerald Isle. He is, in a word, a medical philosopher of the
Epicurean type.</p>
<p>  Dr. Morell Mackenzie is too entirely devoted to his profession to
have much time to spare for the social distractions of Sir Oscar
Clayton or Dr. Quain. He is probably one of the most gifted
specialists in Europe, with one of the shrewdest heads on his
shoulders. For these reasons he is not too much beloved by the
members of his own fraternity. He is, however, as kindly as he is
clever, and hospitable upon a big scale. This hospitality he shares
in common with-though between the entertainments of the two
men there is no similarity-Sir Henry Thompson. The former is
renowned for his big banquets; the latter for his small select
parties, at which the number is strictly limited to eight. He calls
them his octaves. At these you will find a company well assorted



<pb n="91" id="p.91">

and easily amalgamating, dishes judiciously chosen, and sound
wine. Sir Henry Thompson, who is indebted for his knighthood
to the surgical skill which he exhibited in operating on the august
person of the King of the Belgians, is also an accomplished artist,
and many of the most pleasing pictures which adorn the walls of
his house are from his own brush. He is an aesthete rather than an
apolaust. He delights in whatever lends charm and elegance to
life. He takes the same sort of pride and care in his cellar,
although he never touches wine, that a scientific floriculturist might
take in his greenhouses though their contents never had a place in
his drawing-room vases. Each of the four doctors whose names I
have last mentioned discharges distinct social services by bringing
the members of various social sections into mutual communication.
Politicians, litterateurs, artists, actors, journalists, professional men
of all grades, find themselves in each other's company under the
auspices of Quain and Clayton, Mackenzie and Thompson. Thus
we have a quaternion of doctors who, in addition to the benefits
they confer upon humanity by the exercise of the healing art,
supply in the plenitude of their amiable thoughtfulness that social
cement which causes society's various parts pleasantly to cohere.
Such masters of medical science as Sir William Jenner and Sir
James Paget constitute a more solemn class in the hierarchy of
physicians. The latter is specially in favor with the Whig
aristocracy, and the former is much occupied with the Queen.</p>

<p>   IF there is no society in England which can be called distinctly
political, politics are themselves as a department of society. Just
as society in London is, as I have previously explained, a
conditional guarantee of political union; so even among politicians
the claims of society are equal to, or paramount over, the duties of
statesmanship.</p>
<p>  With very few exceptions, most of the public men in England
who, whether in or out of office, direct its affairs, lead a dual
existence-half devoted to the business of the country, the other half
to the pastimes and functions of fashion. It may be said that this
is true of public men in any other European State, but it is not true
to the same extent. Mr. Gladstone and Lord Granville each of
them attach infinitely more importance to the ordinances of society
than Prince Bismarck or M. Jules Ferry. They both dine out and
entertain regularly; and if Mr. Gladstone is, as he is universally
declared to be, one of the hardest workers of his century, he
contrives to reserve a marvellous amount of energy for the small-talk
of the dinner-table and the drawing-room. The London season is
coincident with the parliamentary session, and from February to
July the dinner-parties and other entertainments arranged for the
amusement of the politicians and their belongings exceed the sum
of those given in all the other European capitals. Sometimes it
happens that Cabinet ministers who are expected at dinner, and
who have been long waited for, are prevented by stress of
parliamentary business from appearing; but that is the rare exception; and
in a general way the dinner-party and the evening reception are
institutions not less stereotyped and sacred in the London spring
and summer than the sittings of the commons or the peers.</p>

           <pb n="93" id="p.93">

<p>  The leaders and rulers of parties only set an example which is
faithfully followed by their inferiors and subordinates. Politics
and society in London thus go hand in hand; and if the public
business of the British Empire does not much suffer from the
arrangement, its influence is still discernible. English ministers and their
opponents may protest that relief from work is a necessity, which
no one denies. But do they take their relief in the most efficacious
form? One hears periodically that Lord Granville is laid up with
the gout, or that Mr. Gladstone is suffering from nervous exhaustion.
I cannot think that these ailments are invariably due to the fatigues
of office. Lord Beaconsfield was not in office when he died, but the
physicians, I believe, were of opinion that it was the multitude of
dinner-givers who hastened his end.</p>
<p>  It seems inevitable that statesmen who insist on crowding so
much work and enjoyment into their existences must sometimes
be placed at a disadvantage with the foreign States, whose officials,
when they are not occupied with the routine of their departments,
are reinvigorating themselves by rest taken in the way that their
taste suggests, and are not merely exchanging the excitements and
exhaustions of office for those of society. The more I have watched
English ministers, the more have I become convinced that many of
their worst errors of omission or commission come from the fact
that they do not pass their time wisely; that they attempt to do
too much; and that the regard they feel bound to pay to the
ceremonials and distractions of society diminishes their energies for
business, causes their vigilance to relax, and betrays them into those
slips of which an astute adversary like the German Chancellor is
not slow to take advantage. After all, it is impossible for any one,
peer or commoner, in or out of office, to live the pleasant, luxurious,
yet exciting life of London society without having in some shape
or other to pay the price for it.</p>
<p>One word more by way of preliminary explanation. While all
the best society in London is in some degree political-contains,
that is to say, men who belong to the legislature, have been or are
ministers, and are keenly interested in the fate of parties; women
whose titles, if they are of the nobility, are charged with political
associations, or who are indebted for such social position as they
have to the political influence of their husbands-there is no section
of society which will be found political in the sense in which the
stranger may expect.  Upon ordinary occasions, that is to say,
<pb n="94" id="p.94">



though every person present may be a politician, politics are seldom
talked, and it is deemed a breach against the law of good taste, the
unwritten decalogue of society's etiquette, to touch upon partisan
matters in mixed assemblies.  This rule is sometimes relaxed
among men, but the feeling is unfavorable to its relaxation even
then.</p>
<p>  The reason is simple. First, Englishmen hear so much of
politics, which they cannot avoid, that they humbly pray for and
welcome a respite from them whenever possible. Secondly, heated
discussions on political topics might prove instrumental in
destroying the harmony of the gathering. They are therefore dangerous.
Thirdly, to talk politics, to proclaim one's own political faith and
argue against one's opponents when politicians are off duty, is
looked upon as a mark of the enthusiast, and in London society the
enthusiast is considered to be only one degree less intolerable, if
even that, than the bore. Of course one must be prepared to find
great houses in London labelled with the epithet Whig or Tory,
Conservative or Liberal. The mansion of the Marquis and
Marchioness of Salisbury, in Arlington Street, is a Tory establishment,
the mistress of which has been known to pique herself on never
crossing a Whig threshold, and is conscious of the mission, imposed
on her by circumstances, of a grande dame of Toryism. The
Salisbury dinners may be compared to Conservative tables-d'hote. They
are entertainments of the most orthodox constitutional kind. Not
perhaps very vivacious, but distinguished.</p>
<p>  Sir Stafford and Lady Northcote also discharge, though upon a
more modest scale, their social and hospitable duties to the
Conservative party; and there are several other hosts and hostesses who
endeavor so to regulate their hospitable rites that they shall redound
to the credit and advantage of the constitutional cause. With
scarce an exception, however, the first idea in their minds is the
purely social, and the political object is subordinated to that just as
the wife of the average member of Parliament, or of the gentleman
who thinks he ought to be a member of Parliament, thinks more of
the attention paid her by the peers and peeresses on whose side she
is politically ranged than of the vote given by her husband in the
House of Commons.</p>
<p>  Lady Stanhope and Lady Ridley, the wives respectively of Earl
Stanhope and Sir Matthew Whyte Ridley, have both of them made
praiseworthy attempts at creating Conservative salons. The ladies
     LONDON SOCIETY, POLITICS AND POLITICIANS.           <pb n="95" id="p.95">

of the Liberal party have been more assiduous and successful in
their attempts in this direction. Lady Hayter, the wife of Sir
Arthur Hayter, has made her beautiful house in Grosvenor Square
the social head-quarters of Liberalism. Her husband is a pleasant,
amiable man, though his normal blandness is sometimes agitated
by a curious petulance. His father was the most laborious and
peremptory of Whigs whom the Liberals have ever known, and his
son has himself served in that capacity. But the old Adam of the
heavy dragoon has a large part in his nature, and almost eclipses the
Liberal official. Lady Hayter is the fair embodiment of the genius
of Liberal partisanship, one of the best dressed women in London,
and gifted with all the graces of a born hostess. She is connected
by ties of birth and personal friendship with one or two powerful
Conservative families, and one may see the two parties in the State,
with their various subsections, represented in almost equal
proportions, not, indeed, in her dining-room, but in her reception salons.</p>
<p>  Lady Rosebery will, perhaps, now that her husband has been
gazetted a Cabinet minister, make Lansdowne House the focus of
social Liberalism. But one may be quite sure that almost as many
Conservatives as Liberals will be welcomed by her ladyship and her
lord.</p>
<p>  Lady Aberdeen and Lady Breadalbane both respond with
admirable alacrity to the appeal, periodically made to them, to invite the
wives and daughters of the gentlemen who support Mr. Gladstone
with their vote to their houses. It is a difficult and a somewhat
graceless task. The cards of invitation are practically issued, as
they must necessarily be, by the official understrappers of the party.
These are acquainted with the husbands, but know nothing of their
womankind, and are apt consequently to be betrayed into absurd
mistakes-supplementing the name of Mr. Smith with those of Mrs.,
Misses and the Miss Smiths, when the former may be dead and the
latter either in the nursery or else have long since changed their
names.</p>
  <p>It is difficult to restrain an emotion of pity when one sees the
hostesses, who thus patriotically exert themselves for the good of
their party, standing for hour after hour at the door of their
drawing-rooms and welcoming with all possible show of cordiality guests
whom they have never seen before, whom they pray they may never
see again, and whose names they have failed distinctly to catch.</p>
<p>  In no respect is the difference between the two English political
<pb n="96" id="p.96">



parties more marked than in that of social machinery. London is
without any society proportionate to the magnitude of the Liberal
party as a whole. The Conservatives, on the other hand, have a
social organization adequate to all their wants. It is to be found
first in their clubs, where all sections of Conservatism, leaders and
followers, associate upon equal terms.  Among the Liberals the
chiefs go to one set of clubs, and those who owe allegiance to them
to another.  Again, there are many energetic spirits among the
ladies of the Conservative party who spare no effort to make the
wives and daughters of the parvenus, actually in Parliament, or
anxious to get into Parliament, on the Tory side, at home. The
wives and daughters of Liberal M.P.'s on the same social level are
neglected or cold-shouldered, or treated only with frigid and
conventional civility by the grandes dames of Whiggism or the smart
ladies of Liberalism. Consequently those who enter political life,
as many do, at the promptings of social ambition-to gratify, for
instance, the ladies of their family-can count upon a more definite
social reward by joining the Conservatives.</p>
<p>  If the great Conservative ladies are exclusive, they still take more
trouble to please those whom it is politic to conciliate than the great
Whig ladies; and there are also among the Conservatives many
hostesses who, while not being perhaps of the first calibre, are still
energetic and patriotic.  Hence discontent, heart-burnings, and
jealousies, purely social in their origin, abound among the Liberals.
This, so far as I have been able to judge, will continue to be the
case until the Whig clique which dominates the councils of
Liberalism is broken up. When a Liberal Government is in power it is
the old Whig families-the Cavendishes, the Spencers, and the
Russells-who are first consulted in the economy and the
arrangements of the party. Even Mr. Gladstone, popular force as
undeniably he is, has made and has tried to make no alteration in this
respect, his social sympathies being in the main with the opulent
and cultured Whigs. And the Whigs generally, be it said, are
cultured in the best sense to a far greater degree than the Tories.
There is better talk to be heard, and there are more interesting
persons to be met, at their tables than at Conservative houses of
corresponding distinction.</p>
<p>  The most superficial study of London society suffices to convince
one that there exists among its ladies a considerable capacity for
playing the role of political host which has yet to be utilized.

              <pb n="97" id="p.97">

Gladys, Countess of Lonsdale, might, under proper auspices,
become a social centre of real political power. She has, and in the
days of Lord Beaconsfield often displayed, the gift of receiving
guests with grace, dignity, and ease. But her attention and
interest are difficult to fix, and her perseverance is not equal to her
natural ability. The tendency she illustrates is common enough.
When ladies, and especially young ladies, have the intelligence and
esprit which qualify them to take an interest in political matters,
there are sure to be many other things which have an equal
attraction for them: either they make amusement of every kind their first
object, or they are animated with a desire to enthrone themselves
as the idol of a little coterie of votaries. I could mention half a
dozen wives of Liberal politicians whose political tastes find their
gratification in gathering round them at their dinner-table, or at
some other place, politicians of distinction or of promise. This is
a perfectly intelligible feminine instinct. But it is the very
opposite of that which organizes a society round itself, and establishes a
salon.</p>
<p>  Thus much by way of introduction. Let me now approach the
individuals who have a place in the political system of England.
Of Mr. Gladstone so much has been written and said that it is
almost hopeless to add anything at once fresh and true. I may
perhaps venture to predict that when in years to come his
character and career are impartially estimated, it will be deemed a
wonder that a statesman whose greatest achievements are of a
strictly official kind, and confined to the department of finance,
should have acquired so unchallenged a power over his
countrymen.</p>
<p>  Perhaps he would not have succeeded in doing this but for the
institution of the penny press. Some thirty years ago the paper
duties were taken off, and an impulse was given to cheap journalism
in England, the like of which can be found in the history of no
other country in the world. The Daily Telegraph led the way. It
appealed to the emotions of the multitude. Like Byron when he
sat down to write "Don Juan," it wanted a hero; without such an
object of adoration, concrete and visible, how could the enthusiasm
of the nation be worked up to a fever-heat? It discovered what it
wanted in Mr. Gladstone. He was the depositary of the financial
traditions of Peel. Unlike Peel, he possessed attributes calculated
to stimulate and fire the popular imagination. He was not only, as

<pb n="98" id="p.98">



was Peel, an accomplished scholar and a man of unblemished
character; he had done what Peel never did--he had made fervid
speeches on the beauty of freedom, and had identified himself with
the cause of liberty in every part of Europe. His name was full of
meaning to Greeks and to Italians.</p>
<p>  All this, combined with Mr. Gladstone's unbounded fluency of
speech and fertility of rhetorical resource, presented fine scope for
journalistic treatment. The Daily Telegraph not only made itself
by acting as the apostle of Mr. Gladstone, but made Mr. Gladstone
as well.</p>
<p>  Gradually the strain of jubilant panegyric was echoed. Even the
Standard, though opposed to Mr. Gladstone's politics, had no
sooner become a penny morning newspaper than it hymned in a
minor key, with frequent variations of censure and condemnation,
Mr. Gladstone's glories. The penny press was springing up
everywhere in the provinces. It was in the main Gladstonian.</p>
<p>  I do not doubt for one moment that, had this remarkable
personage lived in an age in which there was no press at all, he would, by
dint of his prowess as a debater, his mental grasp, and his other
magnificent qualities, have risen to a high place, perhaps the
highest. But if the press in England has any influence, Mr. Gladstone
himself must admit that the penny press was the foundation of the
unprecedented ascendency he eventually acquired.</p>
<p>  The position of Mr. Gladstone, as his career draws to a close, will
be always remembered as an instance of the irony of fate, malignant
beyond precedent. Purely a domestic administrator and financier,
he has been called upon to deal with affairs of which he has no
knowledge, and for the treatment of which he is totally without
aptitude. He may be compared to a nineteenth-century Falkland.
"Non-intervention" was the cry with which he came into office in
<date value="1880">1880</date>. The European concert was to be the guarantee of unbroken
peace. What has actually been witnessed?  The history of his
government has been that of a series of interventions; England
has been once more dragged into the vortex of foreign politics; and
under Mr. Gladstone's auspices his country has been committed to
wars more sanguinary and costly, less profitable and honorable, than
during any other period of the century. In comparison with the
foreign policy and enterprises of the English Premier, M. Ferry's
Chinese enterprises have been an unqualified and a cheap triumph.</p>
<p>  But because his achievements have fallen so much below the
   <pb n="99" id="p.99">

standard of his expectations, because destiny has fought against
him and proved too much for him, is Mr. Gladstone on that
account dejected ? On the contrary, although he may experience
some passing emotions of chagrin and a pious resentment against
circumstances, he cherishes the comfortable conviction that both
what he has done and has abstained from doing are right. Facts
may be against him, but then so much the worse for the facts. His
view of foreign politics is that every male child born into the world,
whether Indian or African Mussulman, Egyptian fellah or Zulu
Kaffir, Aztec or Esquimau, is capable of being educated into a
free and independent elector for an English borough.
Parliamentary institutions and representative government are to him not only
the supreme end at which to aim, but the regime to which all
nationalities are instinctively capable of adapting themselves. He
makes no allowance for differences of race or climate, historical
antecedents, national peculiarities. Herein he displays a lack of
imagination, which is more strange seeing that he possesses a large
allowance of the imaginative faculty in other respects, and that he
is really poet first and statistician afterwards.</p>
<p>  Particular causes have combined to confirm this defect. Mr.
Gladstone has spent his life in the House of Commons, and cannot
imagine a political system or a scheme of popular rule, without as
accurate a copy as conditions permit, of the English representative
Chamber. Again, he understands the English people so well, he
has so completely identified himself with the ideas and aspirations
of the upper class of bourgeoisie, that he considers it scarcely worth
while to attempt to understand any other race. If he attempts
such an intellectual process he can only measure the unfamiliar by
reference to the familiar object.</p>
<p>  Mr. Gladstone has drunk too deeply of the atmosphere of
idolatry and incense by which he has been surrounded. His immense
experience of public life, his great capacities as a financier, his
moral earnestness, his religious fervor, his scholarship, culture, and
conversational powers have procured for him enthusiastic
worshippers in every section of the community-among the lower classes,
among the men of commerce and business, among the Whig
aristocracy with whom he has been educated and who have long since
seen in him the bulwark against revolution, among the clergy of
the Anglican Church and the Nonconformist ministers, finally
among certain small and exclusive divisions of London society itself.

<pb n="100" id="p.100">



 No man can receive the homage that has fallen to the lot of
Mr. Gladstone during so many years without experiencing a kind
of moral intoxication and forming an absurd idea of his own
infallibility. Nor is it good for him that domestic interposition should
ward off from him the hostile expressions of opinion which are
occasionally expressed in the newspapers not affected to his cause,
and which represent the views of a certain section of the English
people.</p>
<p>  In social life Mr. Gladstone consorts chiefly with the more or less
exclusive coteries of Whiggism. He stays at the houses of the
great nobles of his party, and entertains them at his own
countryseat. In London he gives occasionally dinners to a mixed
company of members of the House of Commons and a few of his
extraparliamentary friends.  He also entertains strangers, admirers,
intimates, and celebrities or notorieties at breakfast on Thursday.
The meal is of the most uncompromisingly British character: the
hour is ten. Here the visitor may meet an operatic prima donna,
or a popular actor, or an editor, or a litterateur, or Madame de
Novikoff, seated between a Whig peeress, stiff and frigid as an
icicle, and an Anglican preacher such as Canon Liddon. The
combination is kaleidoscopic, both in its variety and monotony, and
always incongruous.</p>
<p>  Mr. Gladstone and Mrs. Gladstone do not trouble themselves
greatly about the amalgamation of their guests, and both are
systematically indifferent to their assortment at table. Of the many
warm friends whom this extraordinary man possesses among the
Whig peers of England, the stanchest is perhaps Lord Spencer,
whose belief in Mr. Gladstone amounts to an enthusiasm. Mr.
Gladstone has also always had the warm support of the house of
Cavendish. The Russells upon one occasion were, I believe, ready
to form a cabal against him. Perhaps matters never went quite to
that length, but the Duke of Bedford is a confirmed cynic, and
might without any serious thought of evil have taken a perverse
pleasure in pleasantly plotting against his leader. There is no
member of London society who says as many good things, who is
the author of as many mots as acid and biting, who impresses one
with a deeper notion of his contempt for human nature generally,
than his Grace of Woburn.</p>
<p>  Lord Rosebery and Lord Aberdeen have together entertained Mr.
  Gladstone more frequently than any other two subjects of the English
<pb n="101" id="p.101">

 Crown. Before the English Premier all doors fly open. His
hosts compete with each other, and are honored by his presence
beneath their roof. It is, I hope, not impertinent to say that Mr.
Gladstone has been the reverse of reluctant to bestow this honor
upon those to whom he considers it is due. He assumes, no doubt
rightly, that the distinction of receiving him is competed for with
jealous rivalry by many qualified persons. To save them trouble
he himself selects whither, when he wants change, he shall go. In
this way the cumbrous machinery of invitation is dispensed with.
He asks his hosts; he does not wait for his hosts to ask him. He
may be compared in this respect to the ladies in leap-year, who on
every 29th of February are supposed to avail themselves of their
prerogative of making love and offering marriage to the gentlemen.</p>
<p>  Only perhaps a lady of the peculiar type of Mrs. Gladstone could
manage this as gracefully as she does. Mrs. Gladstone is the
elderly incarnation of guileless naivete, the matronly essence of
impulsive simplicity. She is to appearance all artlessness. I have
heard persons, who, I think, ought to know better, speak
disparagingly of Mrs. Gladstone's sagacity because of these little
peculiarities. Believe me, they make a great mistake or they commit a
great injustice. Mrs. Gladstone is, in her way, one of the
cleverest women living. Her existence has been a semi-public one for
half a century. During that time she has been brought into
contact with the most distinguished of Englishmen and Englishwomen,
from royalty downwards. A silly woman-any woman, indeed,
but a remarkably clever one-must have perpetrated under these
circumstances a host of blunders. Mrs. Gladstone has steered clear
of all. At the very worst she can be credited only with a few
small ineptitudes which, if they really deserve that name, are in
perfectly artistic keeping with her character. Here is an excellent
and, as she is reputed to be, most unsophisticated lady, who, for I
know not how long, has been the depositary of the most intimate
secrets of State. When, I ask, did she ever show herself so far the
victim of feminine communicativeness as to betray or to hint at any
one of these ? I have heard of ladies and gentlemen, very astute
in their own estimate of themselves, who have endeavored to
extract early knowledge of public matters from Mrs. Gladstone; I
have never heard of one who succeeded; and her aplomb is as
remarkable as her discretion.</p>
<p>   Here is an instance. Two years ago, when Mr. W. E. Forster had

<pb n="102" id="p.102">



resigned his portfolio in Mr. Gladstone's Cabinet, he was naturally
anxious to hear how the Prime-minister would speak of the
incident in the House of Commons, and not less naturally anxious to
listen without being himself observed. He therefore did not take
his ordinary place in the body of that assemblage, but made his
way into the ladies' cage, or rather that portion of it which is set
apart for the lady-friends of the wife of the Speaker. Directly he
had entered he perceived that the sole occupant of the apartment
was no less a person than Mrs. Gladstone herself. She was the one
person whom he would have avoided seeing. He felt a little
discomposed, and was proceeding to evince his discomposure in the
rugged, spasmodic way peculiar to that flower of Quaker subtlety.
But Mrs. Gladstone was perfectly at her ease. She held up her
finger at him, and, shaking her head with an air of gentle reproval,
muttered in a low voice, " Naughty! naughty!" I have only once
in my experience of Englishmen or Englishwomen heard anything
at all comparable to this: that was when Lady Waldegrave-now,
alas ! dead-asked Lord Beaconsfield whether he intended to
dissolve in the forthcoming autumn. "Perhaps," she said archly,
"you have another surprise in store for us." The impassive Earl
was silent for a moment. He then looked her ladyship straight
in the face, and in a tone, half oracular, half bantering, which I
shall never forget, said, "Oh, you dear !"</p>
<p>  Mrs. Gladstone has exhibited a not inferior dexterity in her
management of Mr. Gladstone himself. She understands precisely how
to humor him-and how to diet him, what friends to encourage,
what to ward off, and what social eccentricities are permissible to
him, and even a safety-valve for his overflowing spirits and
superabundant vigor. The English Premier is a very careful eater, and
has publicly announced that every morsel of animal food which he
puts in his mouth requires, for the purposes of digestion,
thirtythree-or is it thirty-one ?-distinct bites. Mrs. Gladstone
therefore takes care that he should always eat slowly. Again, his
internal economy enables him to be indifferent to the quality of the
wine, hock, or champagne which he may sip at dinner. He takes
very little of it, but he enjoys a couple of glasses of good port
afterwards; and Mrs. Gladstone takes care that the good port is
never wanting. In the same way as regards his friends, and
especially his lady-friends, Mrs. Gladstone never thwarts his tastes, and
perhaps one of the reasons of the English Premier's sempiternal

       <pb n="103" id="p.103">

freshness is that he can disport himself in what social pastures he
will without domestic fear or reproach.</p>
<p>  Of Mr. Gladstone's manner and conversation in society different
opinions are entertained. He is a voluble, eager, interested, and
apparently omniscient talker upon every topic which may suggest
itself. Whether he is equally accurate and profound is another
question. I once heard a Japanese gentleman, who had dined in
his company, and had listened to him while he held forth on
every subject, Japan itself included, exclaim: " What a wonderful
man is Mr. Gladstone! He seems to know something about
everything except Japan." For myself I cannot say that this most
encyclopaedic of septuagenarian statesmen has ever struck me as
particularly entertaining. He assumes too much, though in the
least aggressive way, of that papal infallibility against which he
once wrote a pamphlet; and when he takes a seat at a private
dinner-table he is apt, quite unintentionally no doubt, to pose, even in
his small-talk, as the symbol of traditional authority against which
there can be no appeal. The selection of his familiar friends may
also appear a little odd. He loves to liberate his soul to extremely
commonplace people. There are of course his old Eton and
Oxford friends, his Oxford and High Church friends, his Whig and
aristocratic friends, all of whom are respectable and some of whom
may be distinguished; but then in addition to these he commands
a petty contingent of satellites, sycophants, and toad-eaters, who
are picked up from the pavement.</p>

<p>   So much, then, for Mr. Gladstone and his social metier. Let me
record my ideas on the character and position of the second
statesman in the Liberal party. One of the superficial differences
between Lord Hartington and Mr. Gladstone is that whereas the
latter is in the best society of London and England, the former is of
it. If the two were to retire into private life to-morrow, Mr.
Gladstone's seclusion would be that of a dignified scholarship, bordered
with an academic and even an aristocratic fringe. Were Lord
Hartington to do so, the transition would be simply from
statesmanship to society; one element only would have dropped out of
his life. With the friends and acquaintances of whom he knows
most, and who know most of him, he would be as great a man, as
considerable a social force, as he now is-some might say even a
greater.</p>
<p>  As Mr. Gladstone has his resources and occupations in theology,
hymnology, and archaeology, so is Lord Hartington fond of society
and sport. He is a great noble and a zealous turfite. Five years
ago he resigned the stewardship of the Jockey Club to become a
Secretary of State. To-day, I think, he would resign, if his sense
of pride and public spirit allowed him, the Secretaryship of State
to become steward of the Jockey Club. He would not surround
himself with savants, scholars, and ecclesiastics after Mr.
Gladstone's heart; he would only enter more unrestrainedly into the
enjoyments, of which, as matters are, he partakes sparingly. Thus
STATESMEN IN SOCIETY.

<pb n="105" id="p.105">

he would figure more frequently in that patrician set presided over
by the Prince of Wales. He would pay more attention to his stud
and his pleasures. The drawing - rooms and dinner - tables, the
bright particular stars, of which in the ranks of English
womanhood are the Duchess of Manchester, Lady Lonsdale, Lady Charles
Bersford, Lady Randolph Churchill, Lady Mandeville, Lady
Hamilton, and, when she is in London or England, Lady Kildare, would
see him at less frequent intervals than is now possible.</p>
<p>  The society in which Lord Hartington moves, and in which he is
most at home, is not primarily political at all, and in his company,
politics-as is indeed natural, seeing that there are probably three
Conservatives for one Liberal in it-are systematically avoided. It
would be too much to say that he enjoys society; he is rather
reconciled to it; he acquiesces in it, even as he acquiesces in, and is
reconciled to, the politicians with whom he has cast in his lot, the
exalted station to which he has been born, and the prospect of the
dukedom which awaits him. Lord Hartington's manner is
suggestive of a semi-contemptuous protest against everything,
politics and society, the House of Commons and the House of Lords.
"But," he always seems to be saying to himself, " it is not my fault;
how can I help it?"  He is the embodiment of e " spleen;" he is
the embodiment also of English common-sense.
Lord Hartington is often criticised for his manner.
Unquestionably it is peculiar. When he enters a room where a party is
assembled for dinner-which he seldom does save as the last-comer
-he ignores most of those in whose presence he finds himself.
Some may fancy he wishes to avoid them; others, more
idiotically sensitive, may impute to him a design to cut them. But it is
not so; Lord Hartington merely illustrates one of the most
pronounced tendencies of English society, viz., to shun
demonstrativeness of any kind. He hates, therefore, whether on arriving or
leaving a house, to plunge into a perplexing maze of hand-shakings,
nods, and bows.</p>
<p>  One of my compatriots once fairly summed up the air and
demeanor of this distinguished nobleman when he said to an English
friend, " What I principally like about your Lord Hartington is
his you-be-damnedness." He has hauteur, but he has not insolence;
for insolence implies something which is ill-bred or under-bred,
and no one can accuse Lord Hartington of being either. He says
little, and presents to most people the front of an impenetrable reserve.
<pb n="106" id="p.106">



  Not infrequently he breaks his silence by a laugh, half
hearty, half suppressed, partly cynical and wholly good-natured.
He is an Englishman to the back-bone, and he understands and
manages, certainly better than Mr. Gladstone, and probably better
than any other Englishman could, that peculiar amalgam of
prejudice and shrewdness, passion and judgment, emotion and sound
sense-the House of Commons.</p>
<p>  To see Lord Hartington at his best, to form an adequate notion
of the innate strength of the man, you should watch him at a
critical moment in the popular Chamber. The members of this
assembly are bound together by a certain organic unity of sentiment
which justifies their comparison to a huge animal, subject, as
such monsters are, to rapid alternations of excitement and
quiescence, phlegmatic indifference and keen attention. When a bore
is on his legs, this portent of complex vitality seems to stretch
itself out at full length, and only to remind one of its existence by
snorts and sibilations of impatience. When it is irritated or
disturbed it lashes out with its tail, or its bristles stand up erect on
its back, or it hisses between its teeth and threatens to become
dangerously unmanageable.</p>
<p>  It is at these moments that Lord Hartington asserts his strong
ascendency over it. Up to that time he has tolerated its
absurdities and viewed with a lenient eye its grotesque petulance. "But
now," he seems to say, "he will have no more nonsense." The
many-headed brute understands him in an instant. The same
rapport is established between him and it as between a fractious
lion in the Zoological Gardens and the keeper with the irresistible
eye, or between the horse-tamer and the quadruped just reduced
to obedience. Phlegm, spleen, and fire are combined in Lord
Hartington's composition in the proportions exactly suited to
dominate and impress the English people.</p>
<p>  One often hears wonder expressed that an aristocrat like Lord
Hartington should consent to act with the Radicals and
revolutionists with whom it is said he associates. The reason of it is his
cynical contempt for his social inferiors, whatever political label
they may bear. They are, in fact, in his disdainful estimate, alike
canaille; what is there to choose between them ? And the
answer which Lord Hartington gives to this question is, "
Absolutely nothing." Asked once whether political demonstrations
ought not to be forbidden in Hyde Park on Sundays, he replied,

STATESMEN IN SOCIETY.

<pb n="107" id="p.107">

with a characteristic sneer which had in it nothing that was
affected, offensive, or insincere, that he could not for the life of
him see why if you were to admit a well-dressed mob into the
park on week-days you should exclude from it a less well-dressed
mob on the Sabbath. No sentiment could have shown more
plainly the opinion he holds of human nature generally, and of
English political nature in particular.</p>
<p>  He continues to act with the party of which he is a member for
two further reasons-one his honorable sense of loyalty, the other
the hard practical sense of the long-headed Anglo-Saxon. It is not
in him to desert those with whom he is identified. Were he to do
so, with whom could he throw in his lot?  Would not his
public career be closed? Would he not be surrendering the position
which as an English noble he ought to hold? Would he not be
untrue to the traditions of his order? Secondly, his worldly
wisdom convinces him that to part company with the Radicals would
be to efface himself. They are essential to him. Politics with
him are not mere matters of opinion, but means to tangible ends.
He has nothing of the visionary in his composition. Convince
him that a measure of which he disapproves is necessary, and
he acquiesces, though doubtless in a grumbling and
discontented manner. That is his way. He is the Devil's Advocate of the
Liberal party, with a mind quick to raise all sorts of objections,
which he formulates in stridently querulous tones.</p>
<p>  Is he a popular man? On the whole, yes. First, because he is
a lord, the heir to a great dukedom: and Englishmen love a lord.
Secondly, because he is fond of the turf, is a man of pleasure,
with a dash of libertinism in his composition: and Englishmen
like to feel that their leaders have the same passions as
themselves. Lord Hartington has never, perhaps, resisted feminine
influence with relentless obstinacy, and a few venial escapades of
his youth are fondly remembered by his countrymen and endear
him to their hearts. The true-born Briton, Puritan and hypocrite
as he may be, prone to worship or affect to worship respectability
with the same idolatry with which a Greek Christian prostrates
himself before his stocks and stones, or a tawny savage before his
fetich, still loves a viveur; and the knowledge that Lord
Hartington, proud as Lucifer though he may be, reserved, contemptuous,
and scornful, is at bottom not absolutely adamant, has something
attractive about it for the masses. This, too, was the secret of

<pb n="108" id="p.108">



much of Lord Palmerston's popularity, as it was of Lord
Melbourne's before him. There is no instance, so far as I am aware,
in English politics or English society in which it does, or has done,
a man-peer or commoner-any harm to be known that a lady,
not necessarily his wife, is, to use the cant term, a factor-or
should it not be a factress?-in his existence.</p>
<p>  The ladies who can venture to play this critical and delicate
partare very few-must be absolutely sure of their position, and must
have the art, which only high station, birth, breeding, or
extraordinary natural powers can develop, of never violating
appearances or offending decorum. If I may venture upon the difficult
task of classifying ladies in London society, I should do it as
follows. First come those of the most indisputably aristocratic ton
-ladies of birth and title, such as those whose names I have already
mentioned and shall have occasion to mention again.  It is the
rarest thing in the world for any one of these to make openly a
faux pas, and the penalty for such a blunder is usually ostracism
for life.  Place for penitence there is none, and the great lady
who, by an indiscretion, has fallen from her high estate has no
alternative but partial solitude, if she stays in her own country,
or exile to that society which lies perilously close to the borders
of the half-world if she goes abroad.  She becomes, in a word,
declassee. In Paris and Rome, as in many other cities and
pleasureresorts of the Continent, instances of these fair patrician exiles
are not unknown.</p>
<p>  The second order of ladies in London society may be described
as the parliamentary, political, and official. These, it is needless
to say, are one and all paragons of virtue. Not only no suspicion
but no shadow of a suspicion has ever rested upon them.
Cornelia herself was not a better mother; Griselda not a more
exemplary wife. Their husbands are sometimes peers of inferior degree
or of diminished fortunes, sometimes baronets or simply untitled
members of Parliament and officials of the Crown. The wife of
the Speaker of the House of Commons is at the head of this
section of London society, even as the Speaker himself is known as
the first commoner in England. The ladies I now mention go to
all the entertainments given at the great houses upon State
occasions. In their turn they entertain the leaders of their party, the
bishop, and the more prominent of the clergy (when these divines
happen to be in town), of their diocese the better sort of Civil

STATESMEN IN SOCIETY.

<pb n="109" id="p.109">

servants. They rise or sink in the scale of social importance
according as the party to which their husbands are attached are in
or out of office. Officialism is to them the atmosphere from which
they derive the nutrition necessary to social existence.</p>
<p>  The third place in this classification may be assigned to those
ladies in London society whose position is recognized, who may
often be seen at the very first houses in the capital, who are bidden
to the banquets given by high ministers of State, ambassadors,
diplomatists, nay, royalty itself, but whose position is nevertheless
not assured in the same way as that of those composing the two
classes previously mentioned. May I venture to indicate the ladies
of whom I now speak by the French compound demi-castor-la
lionne pauvre would imply more than is necessary. I assume that
these have all the advantages of birth and breeding, and upon the
rigid propriety of their life who can make any imputation? But
somehow or other they are not quite strong enough to lead an
entirely unsupported existence, while a London establishment and
London toilets are heavy drains upon a limited income. They
have, indeed, husbands on whom they can lean, but, alas ! how
frequently do the exigencies of business or not the less
imperious demands of sport compel that gentleman to be from home!
He has a railway concession to negotiate in the East, or property
to look after in Siberia, or a vineyard to superintend in Spain, or a
tramway to lay down in Damascus. Or else the turf is necessary
to him, and there are race-meetings he must attend, and visits at the
country houses of noble friends which he must make for that
purpose. Or perhaps he cannot breathe freely in the oppressive
atmosphere of London. He pines for the air of the moor and the
mountain, of the loch and the sea. His enthusiasm is for yachting,
fishing, hunting, shooting; and his wife, with noble unselfishness,
allows him frequent spells of prolonged liberty. Nor is her
temporary widowhood without its consolations.  She visits and is
visited a great deal. Her house is perfectly appointed. Dinners
she does not give, but a few friends occasionally lunch with her,
and upon these occasions the company is as much without fear and
without reproach as Bayard himself. Moreover she is certain to
have one or two stanch lady-friends belonging to the first or the
second categories at which I have already glanced. These
constitute her protectresses, her guardian angels; and should it ever be
unjustly insinuated that she is not exactly as Caesar's wife ought to

<pb n="110" id="p.110">



be, their reply is as prompt as it is conclusive. "Poor little woman,"
they say, "she has been badly treated. She is really the best and
stanchest of her sex." To put it differently, she thrives and
conquers on the suggestions of persecution. The very mention of her
name becomes a tacit appeal to the chivalry of manhood and
womanhood. She is one of London society's canonized martyrs.
She has passed through the ordeal of that diaboli advocatus who is
allowed to have his say before canonization is conceded, and
henceforth any attacks made upon her recoil upon the aggressors. She
always seems about to topple over the precipice; sometimes she
does; usually she contrives to maintain her equilibrium.</p>
<p>  There is a fourth class of ladies, more or less accredited to society
in London, differing in some important respects from any of the
foregoing. This consists of ladies whose temperament is known as
artistic. Sometimes there are elements in their nature or
circumstances in their social position and antecedents which establish a
link of affinity between themselves and the ladies who belong to
any one of the three former orders. That is to say, they may be
great ladies in virtue of their birth and relations, or they may be
ladies attached to the official and political connection, anxious to
strike out a career for themselves and to win a position independent
of and additional to that which belongs to them in the natural
course of affairs. Or there may be spread over them just that
glamour of equivocal, perhaps compromising romance which
intensifies the interest it is natural to take in the weaker sex. But art,
or possibly science, dominates their whole social environment.
They live in an atmosphere of artistic ideals. The society which
they entertain and by which they are entertained, if its background
derives its hue from the class of which they naturally form part, is
shot through by a hue lent to it by the peculiarity, the bizarrerie of
their tastes. Possibly some inconsiderate persons may expect me
to associate with the classification of ladies in society here given
individual names. Most respectfully do I decline to do anything
of the sort-for two reasons. In the first place, for those who
would recognize the propriety of the names, to mention them is
superfluous; the names will occur to them readily enough without
being specified. In the second place, to those to whom the
classification does not suggest the names, the mere enumeration of them
would fail to convey any idea at all.</p>
<p>  Lord Salisbury's nature is traversed by a vein of contempt for
STATESMEN IN SOCIETY.

<pb n="111" id="p.111">

the rest of the world, as pronounced as that of the future Duke of
Devonshire. But the scorn of the Tory leader is of a more
intellectual quality. Not that he lacks the sentiment of pride of birth,
though he conceals it with an air of deferential courtesy which has
reminded some of his friends of the family physician. His
appearance is imposing. Tall, strongly built, with something of the
scholar's stoop in his shoulders, with well-cut features, and a face
largely covered with black hair, with a manner half mysterious,
half melancholy, he is to the eye much the sort of person whom a
milliner's girl might conjure up to herself after a course of
novelreading as a typical nobleman - the patrician genius of
melodramatic romance. He has few, if any, intimate friends. Lady
Salisbury, who enjoys the position, without perhaps the ideal
aptitudes, of a grande dame-a keen politician and accomplished
litterateur, gracious, kindly, amiable, if not a finished hostess-is his
sole and paramount Egeria.</p>
<p>  Though Lord Salisbury himself wants those qualities which
distinguish the statesman who is the leader of men from the
politician and the pamphleteer, the debater, the epigrammatist, the
journalist, it may be that he will yet make his mark as a great
minister. At present he is admired, but he does not attract. The field
is still open to him, and if he can once settle to his satisfaction
that the game is worth the candle, and that it is premature to
despair of political life-if, in a word, he can subdue his disdain
for his inferiors, and temper his pessimism by a certain infusion of
faith in human nature and in his fellow-countrymen; if he can
stoop to a plebeian House of Commons, and simulate as much
interest in his humble and, it may be, vulgar followers as in his
laboratory at Hatfield-for Lord Salisbury is a man of science as
well as of letters-he may accomplish the greatest things.</p>
<p>  Sir Stafford Northcote, Lord Salisbury's colleague in the
management of the Conservative party, is a curious compound of the
government official, the academic, the country squire. In the first
of these capacities he is admirable. He was apprenticed to Mr.
Gladstone as his private secretary, and the lesson taught him by
that master of finance he has no more forgotten than he has been
able to shake off the ascendency of the teacher, or to present
himself in any other attitude than that of the pupil. In action and in
speech, he is full of the caution and hesitation of an Oxford scholar.
He is as terror-stricken at the idea of responsibility, as impotent to

<pb n="112" id="p.112">



face an emergency and to turn it to good account, as the most
timid and procrastinating of Whigs. The utmost praise which
can be given to him as a leader of the Conservative opposition is
that others might have done worse. He is supposed to be a safe
man. It is a question of opinion whether that is a term of merit
or reproach.</p>
<p>  Socially his manner is not good. He is alternately gauche and
pedantic, familiar and distant. It has never occurred to him to
adopt any system of social procedure. He has not given a
moment's thought to the laws which sway society, although he is,
in his own judgment, formed for society, a ladies' man,
fascinating, irresistible, with a dash of Don Giovanni in his composition.
When I speak of his social manner, I refer to his demeanor in
London drawing-rooms and clubs. In the country, and especially
in his own western shire of Devon, he is extremely popular, affable,
humorous, even facetious, cracking his jokes at the covert-side, the
life and soul of a farmer's ordinary on market-day. Altogether, a
droll mixture of the Treasury clerk, Sir Roger de Coverley, and the
pantaloon on the pantomimic stage.</p>
<p>  It must be confessed that, with a few exceptions, the other
members of the Conservative party are somewhat deficient in
human interest. Among the peers, the Duke of Richmond, of
whom I have said something before now, is a stolid, sensible John
Bull. Lord Cairns is a great lawyer, a capital orator, a first-rate
debater; but his health is feeble. He is without the aristocratic
descent which Tory peers, whatever they may say to the contrary,
demand in their chief, and his legal eminence and legal habits of
mind are against him. Lord Cranbrook, both as speaker and
party tactician, is full of fire; but he is descending into the vale
of years, and lives less in the present than in the past. He is a
splendid declaimer, but too vehement and impulsive for a
statesman.</p>
<p>  Lord Carnarvon has considerable qualities. As administrator of
a department, and as the author of official statements, whether
oral or written, he has few superiors.  Very cultivated and
refined, he has a manner which is too mincing to inspire
confidence. Moreover, his action is apt to be incalculable. He is the
victim of a mental and moral eccentricity, partly natural and
partly the result of the hot-house air in which he was from a boy
brought up. As a consequence, he has developed a self-sufficiency

STATESMEN IN SOCIETY.

<pb n="113" id="p.113">

and independence which assert themselves at the moments most
inconvenient for his political friends.  He is too largely
preoccupied by domestic solicitudes. He has married a second time,
and seems to take the same interest in the young family he is now
rearing as a bibliophilist in his books, or a connoisseur of vintages
in his cellar.  The first Countess of Carnarvon was a notable
specimen of the English fine lady, and, had she lived, his
subsequent career and character might have been different.
Nevertheless, though he wants both grip and grit, he is, and will be,
indispensable to any Conservative Cabinet that may be formed.
He is rich and hospitable, and, while far too fond of surrounding
himself by second-rate satellites who play upon his vanity, is a
dispenser of useful bounties to aspiring Conservatives, who like to
feel that their host is a nobleman.</p>
<p>Lord Lytton is almost too various, too cosmopolitan, seriously
to take rank as a Conservative statesman. His manners are a
cross between those of the Parisian petit maitre and the dandy
diplomatist of Great Britain. The ladies whom he honors by his
observations or his flattery pronounce him a singularly charming
man. He has also been a successful one. As Viceroy of India
he was unpopular, save with his favorites, and, as few other
Indian Viceroys have done, succeeded without much effort in
setting the society of England's Asiatic empire by the ears. His
temperament is pre-eminently that of the poet and writer. His
despatches, transmitted with exuberant frequency to England,
were models of ornate rhetoric, elegant and fairly lucid statement,
and of a length entirely unprecedented.  As a speaker he is
voluble and sometimes effective.  He belongs by taste to the
world of art and the drama ; it is the irony of nature and the
accidents of his position which have contributed to make him an
aspirant for political place. He is a troubadour among officials, a
pilgrim of passion in an age of uncompromising and prosaic fact.</p>
 <p> There are several engaging noblemen in the Conservative party
who ought not to be ignored. Lord Abergavenny is, in his way,
a potentate, a keen politician, though seldom or never speaking in
Parliament; always over head and ears in work and engagements,
though there never seems any particular reason why he should
trouble himself to do anything; a friend and patron of Mr.
Spofforth, erewhile a party manager, with a passion for pulling
the political wires and for returning members of the complexion he

<pb n="114" id="p.114">



approves to the House of Commons. He believes, and whatever
action he takes embodies this belief, that politics ought, even in
this democratic age, to be kept as much as possible a game, the
players in which are the heads of the great titled houses, while the
rank and file of parties are the pawns they move. Lord
Abergavenny is not only a puissant noble, but a popular landlord and
what the English familiarly call a capital fellow.</p>
<p>  Lord Latham is the possessor of an historic title and the noblest
beard cultivated by any English peer. Lord Barrington is rather
a skilled observer of the game of politics than a man who takes a
very active part in them. He reverences, but not slavishly, the
memory of his late chief, Lord Beaconsfield, and lie criticises the
shortcomings of his successors in an airily sagacious manner.
Lord Rowton, Lord Beaconsfield's former secretary and ame damnee,
visits the peers' chamber somewhat fitfully, and supports with
grace and even hilarity the burden of an honor unto which he was
not born. Lord Wharncliffe and Lady Wharncliffe are both
bulwarks of the Tory party, but politics are with them subordinated
to their cares of and position in society; and perhaps they are never
more happy than when they are presiding over one of their beauty
dinner-parties at the family mansion in Curzon Street.</p>
<p>  I am afraid I have said little or nothing about the great dukes of
England. But, with one or two exceptions, a duke in society is a
rarity. I have never seen the Duke of Leeds or the Duke of
Manchester in my life. The Duke of Argyll is magnificent as an orator
and politician, and in the former capacity always gives one the
idea of a Scotch dominie in a fine frenzy. The Duke of
Devonshire is very little in London. The Duke of Northumberland
among the Tories is only visible upon State occasions. The Duke
of Abercorn lives, I think, entirely in the bosom of his family.
The Duke of St. Albans is a cheery, sensible, sagacious, most
kindhearted man of business, and the husband of the most charming of
Duchesses.  The Duke of Marlborough has material in him for
half a dozen reputations. He is a chemist, mathematician, traveller,
and linguist. He studies politics with aids to knowledge that few
men possess. He can both write and speak. Existence is still
before him, and with concentration and the ballast which experience
ought to supply he will make his mark and become a force to be
reckoned with.</p>
 <p> The most attractive figure among the younger members of the

STATESMEN IN SOCIETY.

<pb n="115" id="p.115">

Conservative party is beyond doubt that of the Duke of
Marlborough's brother, Lord Randolph Churchill. With his audacity, his
insouciance, his impetuosity, his vehemence, and his occasional
coolness, more exasperating than his vehemence-in a word, with
his fresh and vivid personality, he stands out in delightful relief
from among the humdrum mediocrities- decorous, plausible,
heavy-by whom he is surrounded. His political life is one of
perpetual war. He is either assaulting the enemy from without,
or assailing his friends within. The sword he wields is
doubleedged, and directly it has smitten a foe, hip and thigh, it recoils
to cleave the skull of an associate. Sir Richard Cross and Mr. W.
H. Smith are commonplace Englishmen of the middle class-
bourgeois nonentities whom Disraeli used to find convenient as a foil.
Lord John Manners is the very pink and quintessence of a Tory
gentleman, getting on in years; a chivalrous spirit, incapable of
doing or thinking a mean thing, and without any of the
qualifications which the leader of a party ought to possess. Sir Michael
Hicks-Beach is reputed to be a strong man. He has a will and a
temper of his own, a fine presence, a good voice, a tenacious and
penetrating intellect, and a natural appetite for work. Lord George
Hamilton was once described by a high authority-the present Lord
Sherbrooke-as the best of the young men who had entered the
House of Commons during his time. But he has done little more
than prove himself industrious, a dashing but uncertain speaker,
apt at arithmetic and statistics. Mr. Edward Stanhope is
intelligent, but prim. Mr. James Lowther resembles an overgrown
school-boy, and his character is summed up in the familiar
abbreviation of his Christian name, "Jim."</p>
<p>  Mr. Gibson and Mr. Plunket are two pleasant, popular, and
accomplished Irish lawyers, each presenting a marked contrast to the
other. Mr. Gibson is famous for his white head, his fluent, fearless
utterance, his Irish brogue, his spirit and energy, and, in all matters
outside the region of his professional or local knowledge, his
neverfailing inaccuracy. When, for instance, he essays, as he sometimes
does, to speak upon questions of foreign policy, he may be
expected, before he has been on his legs five minutes, to perpetrate
some error which raises a laugh and spoils an argument. He has
all the fire of his race in its most developed form, says droll things
in a droll way-sometimes sententious, at others purely
frivolousis a capital companion, and universally liked.
</p>

<pb n="116" id="p.116">


<p>
  Mr. Plunket is a man of more polished manner, more subtle
intellect, and a far higher gift of parliamentary oratory. His speeches
are invariably welcomed in the House of Commons, and lie has a
slight hesitation in his voice, of which he often makes a
consummately artistic use to accentuate his points. But he has two
failings: the first the bigotry of an Irish Protestant, which he may
suppress, but of which he can never divest himself; the second an
incurable love of ease. He gives up to pleasure what was meant
for politics: and as he has the taste, so he is often overcome with
the languor and the lassitude of the refined voluptuary. He is a
great diner-out and a finished mimic.</p>
<p>  Lord Randolph Churchill is of a fibre and is cast in a mould
different from any of these. For some years he had a difficulty in
inducing people to take him seriously. It was only when he made
it clear, by the applause which his speeches on platforms received,
that he was a personage in the country that his leaders considered
it worth their while to treat him, as one who might some day be
their equal. He is on the lips of all men. Every feature of his
countenance and characteristic of his costume would be
recognized by the multitude in any town in England.   Music-hall
songs have been composed in his honor, his name is the cue for
admiring laughter in farces or opera-bouffes, the London cabmen
and omnibus drivers are as well acquainted with him by sight as
with Mr. Gladstone or Mr. Henry Irving.</p>
<p>  It is a face and a figure which once seen are not easily
forgotten. The largely developed and carefully tended mustache, to the
growth of which, by constant manual treatment, a peculiar turn
and shape have been given; the large, restless, prominent eyes,
observing everything, watching an adversary in the House of
Commons, or a hostile disputant in private argument, as a cat
does a mouse; the forehead somewhat low, but broad and massive,
with the perceptive organs above the eyes almost abnormally
developed; the pallid, bloodless skin; the manner alternating
between excess of listlessness and excess of excitability; the
temperament proud, highly strung, keen, sensitive, disdainful, forgiving,
revealing itself in every movement of the body, nay, in the very
fashion in which the cigarette smoke is inhaled; the toilet
sombre in color, careful, and in good taste-these are the outward and
visible signs of a character remarkable and interesting.</p>
<p>  Lord Randolph Churchill is a combination of coolness and of

STATESMEN IN SOCIETY.

<pb n="117" id="p.117">

nervousness, of dignity and impudence, of real earnestness and of
cynical indifference to everything but the whim of the moment.
He is always on the wings of elation or in the depths of
depression, and when he takes the calm and collected view of affairs,
which the statesman ought always to be able to command, it is
because something has occurred to damp his hopes. To be
collected or tranquil it is necessary that he should be pensive also.
He reminds one of a child who, when he does not happen to be
making a noise, is ill.</p>
<p>   Yet he is not quite as impulsive as he seems. He has a far
 keener eye to effect, and judges more deliberately the means
necessary to produce any given effect, than those who watch him
casually might think. From this it follows that he has made
comparatively few mistakes. When the newspapers in their articles,
or society through its more staid and severe members, have
remonstrated with him on his sallies and his outbursts, it is probable
that the critics have been wrong, and Lord Randolph Churchill
has been right. A politician who is playing for his position must
not stick at trifles, and the politician who aims at supremacy in a
democratic age must do something which will impress the
democracy with the effigy of himself. So far as principles are
concerned, the only approach to them with which Lord Randolph
Churchill can be credited is a hasty generalization from experience
and expediency, which is always liable to be upset by a negative
instance. As he himself has said, the business of an opposition is
to oppose, and it is only as a member of opposition that he has yet
proclaimed his qualifications to the English people. To borrow a
metaphor of the national game, he has shown that he can bowl; it
yet remains to be seen whether he can bat.</p>
<p>   His sympathies, real or affected, are popular; his personal
predilections are exclusive. If he has some of the arts of the
demagogue, he has much of the hauteur of the noble. He resents
 familiarity, and he has a pretty power of making that resentment
 felt by impertinent intruders who presume upon the most
superficial acquaintance with him. As a speaker he is forcible,
impassioned, always effective, and sometimes eloquent. His facility of
 expression is astounding, and nothing is more noticeable in him
 than the literary quality of his rhetoric. He is quick as lightning
 in repartee, and, whether in social conversation or in the desultory
 wrangles of the House of Commons, the rejoinder follows upon
<pb n="118" id="p.118">



the attack with the same celerity with which the thunder succeeds
the flash. It would be too much to say that he is a master of
epigram, though the English apply that expression to many
persons who deserve it infinitely less. But he has an inexhaustible
fund at his disposal of original and audacious antitheses, of strange
combinations of words and ideas, of bizarre involutions of phrase,
which are no bad substitutes for epigram. The tone of his voice
is powerful, though rather uncertain, and he speaks with
something more than a suspicion of the aristocratic lisp.</p>
<p>  In private life he is agreeable, hospitable, and sumptuous in his
ideas of hospitality. His love for display and magnificence is only
tempered by the perfect taste of Lady Randolph Churchill-one of
the most accomplished women in London society, a finished artist
and musician, and a perfect dresser-and himself. Everything in
the Randolph Churchill establishment is comme il faut. The
dinners are never too large or too long. The dishes are always the
best of their kind-perfect simplicity combined with the highest
merit. Matters, too, are arranged on a princely scale, for Lord
Randolph Churchill has all the inclinations of a grand seigneur.
His house is one of the few which possesses the electric light. It
costs him about fifteen times as much as any other mode of
domestic illumination. But what of that ? It was the thing to have,
and his Lordship had it accordingly. I hope I shall not be
accused of disrespect if I dare to compare him to Sarah Bernhardt.
He has something of the genius, much of the emotional excitability,
much of the same combination of opposite qualities, that belong to
the incomparable artist who weds a husband for the sake of a
caprice. Like her, he can be strenuous, energetic, industrious.
In his case, as in hers, it is equally impossible to predict what he
may do under any given but unexpected conditions. The love for
the magnificent and the superb is not more developed in the one
than in the other. Each is the child of passion and whim, and
each is also breathed upon by the divine afflatus of that indefinable
something which men call genius.</p>
<p>  <persName key="Churchill, Randolph, Lord">Lord Randolph Churchill</persName> is now, I believe, some seven-
and thirty years of age. He is thoroughly range. He has left behind
him the social dissipations of youth, and it may be that he has
shaken off the political extravagances of that chartered period
of existence.  His health has improved, though it still requires
looking after. He cannot, I take it, during the Parliamentary session


<pb n="119" id="p.119">

afford to lead the two lives which Lord Hartington can manage
without any inconvenience. It is reported of Lord Hartington
that some years ago-I think in the summer of <date value="1880">1880</date>-he actually
succeeded in getting to bed soon after midnight. Before he had
successfully courted his first slumber he was roused by a message
from Downing Street. He has not since repeated the vain
experiment of early bed-going, which, according to an English proverb,
is one of the secrets of success.</p>
<p>  With <persName key="Churchill, Randolph, Lord">Lord Randolph Churchill</persName> it is quite different. During the
parliamentary session he orders his life with an exclusive regard to
the exigences of politics. He entertains splendidly, and is
splendidly entertained by others. But when he is not kept up late at
Westminster he wooes slumber at the first opportunity, and when
he can snatch a day's rest he spends it in the delicious languor of
doing nothing except the smoking of cigarettes and the reading of
French novels. The two most normal phases of his existence are
those in which he is expending force in great efforts, or recruiting
and recuperating himself after the efforts have been made.
Fortunately for him, he has arrived at a period of life when he
understands something of the doctrine of the economy of strength. He
avoids bores, and though for the sake of pleasing his friends he
will strain a point and assist at entertainments which are a pain
and weariness to him, he quits the scene of tedious distraction
betimes, and contrives to enjoy more of the solace of seclusion than
most people. Formerly he used to be a great hunter and a keen
whist-player; now his two chief occupations when he is on holiday
are angling and the cultivation of nirvana.</p>
<p>  Lord Randolph Churchill has a large share of that personal
power so difficult to define, so easy to feel, so essentially magnetic
in its operation, which enables an individual to assert himself as a
leader of men. If there resides in him a strong repulsive force, if
he offends as often as he conciliates, that suggests only the other
side of those attributes in virtue by which he draws many persons
to himself. Mere jealousy sufficiently explains why some of his
own party in the House of Commons are permanently estranged
from him. Yet could there be a greater tribute to his innate
potency than that even these feel his fascination ? Among his
opponents this fascination is an admitted fact. Mr. Chamberlain,
notwithstanding one or two little ruptures of intimacy, is his firm
and warm admirer. Nor has he made any abiding enemies even

<pb n="120" id="p.120">



among politicians who belong to his own party. He has indeed
established a little party of his own. The droll thing is that the
most useful and obedient members of it are two gentlemen
considerably Lord Randolph Churchill's seniors in years and in
experience.</p>
<p>  Mr. Gorst is an extremely clever man; the same thing may be said
of Sir Henry Drummond-Wolff, who is, indeed, one of the historic
personages of his time. The former is an eminent mathematician
and a fair linguist, of well-balanced mind, and a keen eye for the
points which in a controversy can be best made against an
antagonist. The latter commenced life as a diplomatist. In that capacity,
and by virtue of his family relations-he is on the maternal side a
Walpole-he formed an extensive, miscellaneous, and panglot
acquaintance. He has a mind stored with anecdotes suitable for
various tastes. He is one of the few men in England who can tell
a story equally well in French and in his own native tongue. He
is therefore much in request in society, and frequently to be met
with in the best houses. He can be at times exceedingly amusing,
but there are occasions when he appears to be sunk in an
atrabilious gloom. This is not due to the depressing influence of years,
for Sir Henry Wolff, if he has rather more than completed his half
century, preserves the guileless delight in existence of a child, and
has the exquisite pink-and-white complexion of which a young
lady in her teens might be proud.</p>
<p>  The explanation, I am disposed to think, is that,
notwithstanding any disbelief in human nature and human institutions which he
jauntily parades; notwithstanding his tendency to treat
everything as a joke or as a peg on which to hang a bonne histoire, he has
always on his lips the exclamation with which Pitt is said to have
died, " 0 my country!"</p>
<p>  Sir Henry Wolff is a man greatly misunderstood. He is a patriot
in the guise of a cynic; a moral philosopher and reformer who
presents to society the front of an Epicurean indifferentist. He is at
heart profoundly concerned for the state of the nation. Superior
to parties, although a loyal Tory, he has ever before him the image
of his fatherland. The frivolity and the social corruption of the
age often cause his brows to be overcast, and even when he most
successfully attempts to drown his solicitude in mirth and
pleasantry, I have noticed a shadow pass over his countenance, like the
cloud which is mirrored in a sunlit lake, and which tells me that a
                  STATESMEN IN SOCIETY.                    <pb n="121" id="p.121">

lofty melancholy has marked him as her own. At such times his
thoughts lie too deep for tears and far too deep for words. He is
rent by conflicting emotions. He is divided between anger at the
social and political offences of the day and bland compassion for
the offenders.</p>
<p>  Mr. Gorst succeeds in maintaining a more unruffled calm. If he
does not sparkle like Sir Henry Wolff, he is without his moody and
dejected moments. His voice is smooth and flute-like, and he can
say the most incisive things in the softest tones. Both of these
gentlemen are the counsellors and lieutenants of Lord Randolph
Churchill, who has profited in turn from the advice and varied
knowledge of each. But it would be a mistake to suppose that
Lord Randolph has ever subordinated himself to them, or that the
initiative has not been his. Another member of the little coterie
over which he presides, although not bound to him by the ties of a
political allegiance so close as Sir Henry Wolff and Mr. Gorst, is
Mr. Arthur Balfour, an elderly young gentleman of singularly
charming manners, pleasant and well-bred appearance, over six feet
in height, and with legs whose length he is not always able to
control. He is a metaphysician, a writer, a cogent and
clearvisioned arguer, a nephew of Lord Salisbury, whose habit he can
reproduce with felicitous fidelity.

</item></list></argument>
<p>   THERE are several houses in London at any one of which one
may be sure to meet a certain number of political celebrities.
Such are the establishments of all persons in the first social rank
who systematically entertain. Some of these have been already
enumerated.  Mrs. Jeune, who as a hostess has a recognized
position, when she does not dissipate her efforts on Bohemianism,
and when she arranges a dinner to which she attaches
exceptional importance, can always secure a fair supply of ministers,
exministers, or ministers yet to be. Sir Charles Forster is one of the
chief Amphitryons of the Liberal party ; Mr. Gladstone is his
frequent guest, and politicians, whether attached to the opposite
party or unattached, are to be found at his board. The same may
be said of Mr. Henry Edwards, who has made a fortune in the
linseed trade, and who primarily lives that others may eat and
drink their fill.</p>
<p>  Then there are the Brasseys-Sir Thomas and Lady Brassey, I
mean. Their house in Park Lane is noted for overgrown
dinnerparties and for the receptions which Lady Brassey loves to
designate by the epithet "small and early." Sir Thomas Brassey is
reputed a good fellow. His manner is phlegmatic and fishlike.
Perhaps the latter quality is the result of his extensive maritime
experience. He bears no resemblance whatever in his
countenance to his father, who was a man of decidedly distinguished
appearance as well as enormous business capacities. He writes
books, or is the cause of writing books by others, just as Lady
Brassey writes journals which are presented to the public in the



<pb n="123" id="p.123">

guise of splendidly illustrated volumes. Lady Brassey appears to
order her existence upon the lines which may have been suggested
by a social empress on the burlesque stage. She is an excellent
and exemplary woman in every relation of life, as wife, mother,
and sister-in-law; she, therefore, only resembles the grand-
duchess in her love of authority and ceremonial. She has a passion
almost Oriental for a retinue. She reminds one of the lady in the
nursery-rhyme who, with rings on her fingers and bells on her
toes, insisted upon having music wherever she went. The
simplest journey is converted by her into a royal progress. There
must be equipages and outriders, the paraphernalia of a cortege.
She would like that her arrival at any given point should be
announced by a peal of bells from the neighboring spire or a <foreign lang="fr">feu de joie</foreign>.</p>
<p>Devoted to "Tom" as she is, she prefers to make her pilgrimages
by herself, accompanied only by her satellites. "Tom's " presence
detracts from the attention which she excites. Tom may well be
content to follow in a modestly closed brougham, while her
ladyship reveals her imperial splendor, seated in an open barouche, to
the gaping multitude. It is the same thing when she goes to the
theatre or the opera. She has her people about her, and behind
her chair there is tolerably certain to stand Mr. Roger Eykyn, a
stock-broker by profession, a hanger-on and a connection of the
nobility by a matrimonial accident.</p>
<p>  There are other ladies of the Liberal or Conservative party, or
of no party whatever, who deserve to be celebrated in these pages.
Lady Hayter I have already mentioned: she is beyond all
comparison the great hostess of the Liberals. Her house, with its
exquisite dining-room, its perfect suite of reception-rooms, and its
convenient ball-room, lends itself marvellously well to the ends
of hospitality. Thought and judgment are also as apparent as
amiable intention in the catalogue of the company invited to her
dinners and her evenings. She has done in fact what very few
women in London have been able to do for their menage; she has
succeeded in investing her entertainments with dignity and
importance. In this respect she resembles, even though at a
considerable interval, Lady Palmerston, who so contrived her reunions
that every one assisting at them felt that he was indebted to his
hostess for a compliment personal to himself. Lady Hayter is one
of the most comme-il-faut ladies in London.  Her toilets are the

<pb n="124" id="p.124">



perfection of taste, and invariably serve with her as the frame of a
charming picture. She never dons a bonnet or a frock, selects a
color or jewel, without being satisfied of its applicability to the
figure, face, and complexion with which nature has endowed her. Her
presence is not lacking in dignity, and the charm of her expression is
the more piquant because it possesses a certain tinge of melancholy.</p>
<p>  Prominent among the eclectic and impartial entertainers of
politicians is Lady Dorothy Nevill. She does not indeed give
dinnerparties, but has organized a scheme of Sunday, and occasionally
week-day, luncheons, much appreciated by those who have the
entree of the house. Her ladyship is discriminatingly
indiscriminate in her selection of guests, and makes with much success raids
into Bohemia, returning now with an author or journalist of repute,
now with an actor or actress. She knows everybody: has been the
confidante of statesmen, field-marshals, bishops, and diplomatists.
Apropos, note the difference thus indicated between the French
and English woman: the latter talks, advises, criticises; the former
sits still and expects to be admired. The one asks for confidence,
the other for homage. Lady Dorothy Nevill hears everything.
To her London society is one long whispering-gallery. She herself
occupies a position midway down the corridor, and not a voice or
footfall sounds without reaching her ears. She is also extensively
popular, and, strange to say, she is liked by women as well as by
men. She has made few enemies of her own sex; or, if these exist,
there is scarcely one who, from the knowledge that public opinion
would be hostile to her if she were to avow her hostility, would
dare to reveal it. The great charm in Lady Dorothy Nevill's
manner is not merely the frankness and the absence of affectation,
but the union of detachment from the incidents and persons amid
which she lives, with minute knowledge of, and keen personal
interest in, them. This detachment is a quality which appeals to the
intellect and charms the imagination. It gives one the notion of
a reserve, a suppressed power of character, and has secured Lady
Dorothy Nevill friends and admirers among men of the greatest
distinction of the century. In politics she is a democratic Tory.
As a Tory she touches hands with, and regales upon clarets and
cutlets, Sir Stafford Northcote and Lord Salisbury; as a democrat
she is at home to Mr. Chamberlain or Mr. Bright; while in Lord
Randolph Churchill, who is her delight, she recognizes the
connecting link between the two. When her company is a little perilously



<pb n="125" id="p.125">

mixed, and the atmosphere threatens to become electrical, she
takes care that there shall be two or three lightning-conductors
about her room, in the shape of a litterateur who will divert and
disarm the destructive fluid; or an artist at the critical moment
concentrates upon himself the attention of the guests, the heated
controversialists included. This is Lady Dorothy Nevill's idea of
a salon, and it is not a bad one.</p>
<p>  Isabella, Countess of Wilton, is a hostess of a different order,
less catholic in her tastes than Lady Dorothy Nevill, less various
in her sympathies, but appreciative of other excellences than those
of rank, social splendor, and beauty. An amiable and most
hospitable lady this; consistently striving, too, while preserving the
dignity of her feasts, to stamp upon them something of a character
which shall be all their own. Lord Hartington, and those who are
to be found where Lord Hartington is-the representatives of the
diplomatic circle, the fine gentlemen and ladies who are accepted
at the houses where samples of the best London society may at any
moment be seen-these are to be found beneath the roof of Isabella,
Countess, etc. Like Lady Dorothy Nevill, she is no respecter of
political parties or personages, though she is conscious of a special
power to entertain ambassadors. She may imagine herself a Tory,
just as, from her conversation and the garniture of French phrases,
it might be inferred that she at times imagined herself a Parisian
grande dame; but the former would be as much of a delusion as
the latter is of a habit.</p>
 <p> I may here mention the name of another lady of title, often to be
seen in the same company as Lady Wilton-Maria, Marchioness of
Aylesbury. This personage is one of the most famous institutions
in London society; one of the most imposing monuments of the
grandness of a past regime.  Wherever dukes or peers of high
degree entertain, wherever royalty deigns to show itself, there will
be found, as there has been to be found any time during the last
half-century, the stately and unmistakable presence of Maria,
Marchioness of, etc. The tall form, the aristocratic countenance, the
frizzled wealth of the hair which in gracefully swelling
protuberances decorates the side of her head, the many-colored toilets,
the miraculous head-dresses, and the unique arrangement of
jewels-these are the outward and visible signs of the lady who is
more intimately at home in many great English households than
any other of her sex.</p>
<pb n="126" id="p.126">



<p>  Lady Reay, who has recently left England accompanying her
husband, the new Governor of Bombay, was, and no doubt will be
again on her return five years hence, a favorable specimen of the
political hostess. She has much ambition; that she has much
cleverness is proved by the career she has made for her husband,
by his conversion from a Scotch into an English peer, and by his
appointment to an important proconsulate. Formerly attached to
the Liberal party, she is far from being a mere partisan. She had
caused her house to take rank as one of the best in London, and she
has quitted England just as her social star was attaining its
ascendant. At Lady Reay's one might be sure upon occasions, at lunch
or dinner on Sunday afternoon or at an evening party, to have
met-though, indeed, for that matter they are to be met at many
other houses the hospitalities of which are to-day in full
swingsome of the most prominent members of the Liberal party.</p>
<p>  If in London society to-day the grande dame is seldom to be
met with, I must not be supposed to assert that ladies of high
rank, uniting dignity and sweetness, whatever is most attractive
in charm of manner and of mind, are wanting. There is no
European capital where the superior of Lady Airlie, as a type of
patrician matronhood, the intelligent and tactful woman of the
world, preserving, now that her hair is silvered with years, much
of the freshness and fascination of youth, can be seen. I might
also point to Lady Stanhope and to Lady Lytton as veritable
paragons and cynosures of their sex and order. Lady Holland is
now little in London. But she seldom fails to pass some weeks of
every summer at Holland House, Kensington-that monument to
a departed social order, that depository of vanished social
traditions.  Her garden-parties remain among the chief events of
society's summer in the metropolis, and have lost none of the air
of distinction which was their original attribute.</p>
 <p> Let me now revert from my social apercu to my political survey.
Here I will suppose there stand before me-whether in Lady A's
or Lady B's drawing-room does not much matter-three or four
members of Mr. Gladstone's Cabinet, and a few other gentlemen
who are either of Cabinet rank or are names with which a certain
section of the European public is familiar.</p>
<p>  The gentleman with the smooth-shaven face, the eye-glass, the
inquiring expression of countenance, the hair brushed back, the
lines indicating will strongly defined in the neighborhood of the


<pb n="127" id="p.127">

lips, is Mr. Chamberlain. His nose at once recalls the pictures
and statues of the younger Pitt.  Of Pitt's will he has much;
Pitt's courage he shares; Pitt's high-toned patriotism he may yet
display.  He is an English statesman after the most approved
fashion of the last quarter of the nineteenth century, first-rate as
a man of business, prompt, ready, resourceful, courageous,
courteous. I suppose no man after so short an experience of the House
of Commons ever acquired such an authority in the country, or
possessed an equal number of followers and enemies. With Mr.
Chamberlain politics are not only the supreme object, but the one
dominating aim, of existence. To these everything else is
subordinated. He mixes with and is now well received by society in
London, but, unlike some of his colleagues, he makes no secret of
the fact that London society only occupies the second place in his
affections, and that he will be no more subject to its constraints or
obedient to its demands than may be necessary to his position or
agreeable to his tastes.</p>
<p>  You will meet him at some of the most eligible houses in the
capital. He also entertains a good deal himself, though, as he is a
widower, his parties are limited to men. He has in London some
stanch allies and even enthusiastic admirers among women, and
the little knot of smart ladies, which includes, among others,
Lady Randolph Churchill, Lady Blanche Hozier, are fond of
organizing entertainments of which he is the chief ornament and
lion. He is, in fact, in London society very much what, thirty
years ago, Mr. Bright was in the political society gathered round
the House of Commons. The reality of him is less terrible than
his name, and during the London season one encounters not a few
people who, having expected to find in Mr. Chamberlain some
fierce and aggressive person, profess their astonishment at
discovering him to be a very agreeable gentleman with a large stock of
conversational subjects, appreciative of humor, and light in hand.
He is, however, one of the comparatively few English politicians
who naturally talk about politics in society, and in a tone less
cynical and more earnest than society is accustomed to hear.</p>
<p>  For the rest, Mr. Chamberlain is a connoisseur of pictures, fond
of the theatre, especially of the French play when it happens to
be in London, an enthusiastic smoker, and, as a consequence of a
capital constitution and a figure with no tendency to fatty
degeneration, as superior as Lord Lyons himself to physical exercise,
<pb n="128" id="p.128">



and as free from malaise when that exercise is not forth-coming
Mr. Chamberlain has many friends and admirers outside the limits
of his own party. He can appreciate ability and courage, tactical
skill and political capacity, in whomsoever these qualities may
reside, and however bitterly they may be arrayed against him.
Tories of so unimpeachable a kind as Mr. Gibson, Mr. Plunket,
and Sir <persName key="Henry Holland">Henry Holland</persName>--to say nothing of <persName key="Lord Randolph
Churchill">Lord Randolph
Churchill</persName> and <persName key="Sir Henry Drummond-Wolff">Sir Henry Drummond-Wolff</persName>-are among his most
frequent guests. Between himself and <persName key="Sir Charles Dilke">Sir Charles Dilke</persName>, of whom
I have previously spoken at some length, there exists the closest
and most loyal intimacy. They stand together, and they would
fall together. The career of each depends upon reciprocal fidelity
and mutual usefulness.  One often hears comparisons drawn
between the two men. The suggestion is even made that some
day or other there may be developed a dangerous rivalry between
them. Believe it not.</p>
<p>  <persName key="Sir William Harcourt">Sir William Harcourt</persName> is a politician of imposing presence and
a manner sometimes pompous, sometimes in a chastened fashion
facetious. He is not only a Secretary of State, but a squire of
dames, and can make himself an engaging companion to ladies of
beauty or position. He is scarcely a popular man. Perhaps the
general verdict of society would be that lie is unpopular. That is
because he unites to the haughty reserve of the English aristocrat
and the English statesman some of the idiosyncrasies of the legal
and the literary temperament. He has a larger knowledge of
English literature than any man, <persName key="Mr. Gladstone">Mr. Gladstone</persName> himself not excepted,
now prominent in English political life. He had won his laurels
as a writer long before his name was known in politics or he had
laid the foundations of forensic fame. Unless I am mistaken, he
wrote some exceedingly clever electioneering squibs as a mere lad.
Subsequently he struck out into journalism, and acquired as
perfect a mastery of the art as Lord Salisbury himself.</p>
<p>  <persName key="Mr. Trevelyan">Mr. Trevelyan</persName> is the only other member of Mr. Gladstone's
Cabinet who is identified with literature to the same extent as Sir
William Harcourt, and in whose speeches traces of the same
literary quality are forth-coming. He is the nephew of Macaulay, and
from his uncle he inherited an admiring appreciation of the literary
tradition of the Whigs. Since he has assumed the responsibilities
of official life, he has proved that there is the stuff of a statesman
in him. Mr. Lefevre, the youngest member of the Cabinet, has



<pb n="129" id="p.129">

also been a writer of books and articles. There is nothing brilliant
or showy about him. He has great intellectual tenacity, has a
native aptitude for administration, and is enamored of detail.</p>
<p>  The two most conspicuous among the unattached forces in
English politics are <persName key="Mr. Goschen">Mr. Goschen</persName> and <persName key="Mr. Forster">Mr. Forster</persName>. Neither of them
can be felicitated on his manner. Both are men of considerable
calibre, and with both, so long as they are alive, the Government
and the Opposition of the day must count. Both, too, are
frequently to be met with in the dining-rooms and drawing-rooms of
the great, and I will venture to say that there is no one better
acquainted with the political undercurrents of society's thought and
conversation than Mr. Forster or Mr. Goschen. Perfectly honest
and sincere as the latter of these is, I am not quite certain that he
is entirely fitted for the political life of Great Britain. He
combines with the academic knowledge-I might almost say the
omniscience-of an Oxford scholar and a German professor something
of the sinuosity of the Oriental. That is to say, the constraints of
English party life, with the sharp and restricted choice of
alternatives that they offer, appear irksome to him. The men who
succeed in English statesmanship must attach themselves to one
party or the other, and must give up all idea of a rapprochement
with the opposite side. Mr. Goschen understands this perfectly in
theory, but he does not reduce the theory to practice. There is
nothing disingenuous about him. He is not an intriguer; he is a
philosopher-too broad, too judicial, too far-seeing to be a partisan.
Though he may yet have before him in England a great future, I
am disposed to think that he would have done better if his lot had
not been cast so far west.</p>
<p>  If it be possible to conceive of the genius of unadulterated,
rugged veracity, at once anxious to impress the world that this is
its real character, and desirous of making friends with the
mammon of unrighteousness by appearing in dress-clothes in
drawingrooms and by sipping tea of an afternoon with ladies of rank, Mr.
Forster goes far to realize such a conception. Born a
Yorkshireman and a Quaker, he retains the demure pharisaisms of his
religion, and he brings into prominent relief the astute idiosyncrasies
of his nationality. He has the eye of an artist for popular effects.
The most cautious and reticent of cats cannot long conceal from
him how it will jump. He has, all praise to him, so closely and so
transcendently to his own satisfaction associated himself with whatever

 is honorable, fair, chivalrous, and noble, that he can never
look in the glass without recognizing in his own image the reflected
apostle of a holy cause. Inevitably, therefore, he magnifies his
apostleship-and to magnify that, what is it but to glorify himself?
Every one who knows him is persuaded that he is the incarnation
of great qualities. So firmly is he persuaded of it, that he is
incapable of believing that any qualities reside in him which are not
great. Hence it follows that those who condemn or oppose him or
stand in his way are not only vexing him with a personal
antagonism, and irritating him by wounding his amour propre, but are
making war against righteousness itself. How, then, can it be
otherwise than his duty to visit with the extremity of his vengeance
those who are guilty of this wanton impiety? and, be it said to his
credit, he displays all a Yorkshireman's cleverness in exasperating
and annihilating his foes. All Yorkshiremen are reputed to be
fond of horses and of the turf. I have never heard that Mr.
Forster is even a part owner of a racing-stud; but he is so far a
sportsman that he is devoted to whist-a noble game, which he
plays exceedingly ill, and at which his losses are sometimes heavy.</p>
 <p> I have, I think, now fairly done duty to the political aspect of
society in London. There is, however, one gentleman, more
typical of the race than some of those I have just passed in review,
about whom I cannot be silent. <persName key="Sir Robert Peel">Sir Robert Peel</persName> is the son of one
of the greatest statesmen England has ever known; perhaps quite
the greatest-Mr. Gladstone himself not excepted-as a domestic
statesman. Illustrious in virtue of his descent, he is in virtue of
himself and his personal endowments an English celebrity. He
had a roaring youth; he has even had a resonant manhood. He is
the exact antithesis of his famous sire in almost every respect.
The most remarkable exception is his real, though frequently
concealed, tolerance of opinions the opposite of those which he
professes, and his clearness of political vision. Calling himself a
Tory, no man knows better the shortcomings of the Tories, or has
a deeper insight into the inevitable drift of affairs. In his speeches
and in his private conversation he is a partisan, not infrequently a
furious partisan. In his own mental estimate of men, of
emergencies, and of the goal towards which things are going, no man is
less of a partisan.</p>
<p>  Herein he resembles his father, who knew that it was by the
irony of fate that he was placed in the position of leader of the


<pb n="131" id="p.131">

Tory party, and that the tide was setting against Toryism as fatally
and as irrevocably as the sun sinks to his rest in the west or the
magnet points to the pole. In everything else what a contrast
between the two ! Sir Robert, the father, was the grave, reserved,
tranquil worshipper of the British proprieties, with an inborn
terror or hatred of anything verging on the unseemly or the
scandalous, superstitiously reverencing the conventional. He was a model
school-boy, a model undergraduate, a model member of Parliament.
Whatever the virtues of his son, he has owned allegiance to few of
those restraints which his father venerated. He has between thirty
and forty years' parliamentary experience, I believe refused
Cabinet office, and has, I know, twice refused a peerage. But
tranquillity is not his metier. He loves a stormy atmosphere. When
tempest does not exist he has a knack of creating it, and he would
always be fain to ride in the most conspicuous position on the crest
of the wave. He is a big man with a big manner. He is no more
to be ignored than the <foreign lang="fr"><placeName key="Arc de Triomphe">Arc de Triomphe</placeName></foreign> itself or <foreign lang="fr"><placeName key="Mont Blanc">Mont Blanc</placeName></foreign>, or
any other colossal eminence. Tn society lie is the highly-bred man
of the world, but he never allows himself to be effaced; and when
he is in the society of men only, he is apt to be dogmatic,
contradictory, paradoxical, inaccurate, not invariably observing the line
which separates self-assertion from turbulence.</p>
<p>  Were he a little younger, I should predict that he would be the
accepted chief of the Tory democracy. He could live-no man
better-in a whirlwind of democratic movement. He likes to sway
the mob, and the mob has no objection to be swayed by him. His
voice is as fine as his presence, and he has a gift of oratory which
not a dozen men in England possess. Moreover, it is his special
fondness digito monstrarier. He is not only an indefatigable
attendant at the House of Commons-he never misses any sort of
meeting, secular or religious, within a convenient distance of which he
may happen to be, when there are no more pressing demands upon
his time. Nothing pleases him more than to be gazed at as Sir
Robert Peel, and when he is able, as is frequently the case, while
gratifying his passion for notoriety, to acquire an insight into
popular feeling, he is supremely happy. With his velvet collar, his tall
hat rakishly placed at an angle on his head, his demeanor dashing,
dignified, defiant, and sportsmanlike, he suggests iresistibly the
master of the ring at a circus; his natural and indomitable humor,
his love of fun and pun, his jesting audacity on the platform, fit

<pb n="132" id="p.132">



him for the part of Mr. Merriman. In London society he is often
to be met with. His sister and brother-in-law, the. <persName key="Countess of
Jersey">Countess of
Jersey</persName> and Mr. Brandling, entertain much, and of course he visits
them. He is on terms of intimacy with the Rothschilds and
Bischoffsheims; <persName key="Mr. Henry Edwards">Mr. Henry Edwards</persName> rejoices to feast him; and, to
descend to a slightly lower level, there is scarcely a house in London,
belonging to those who inhabit the opulent portion of the
frontier which separates society from Bohemia, where he is not at home.</p>
<p>  Whether among the politicians I have or have not mentioned
there is any one likely to fill a high place in the list of Europe's
real statesmen, time must show. As yet I can see little more than
a number of clever political managers and schemers in the
department of the home affairs of England. What productive forces
are there inherent in the democracy? What power has it of
implanting energy, and inspiring action, in individuals? How is the
principle of authority at home and abroad to be maintained under
its supremacy? How are its passions to be curbed or its inertness
to be dispelled? Who or what will be adequate to its discipline?
Or is this democracy to prove fatal to England as an imperial state,
and as a pattern and mother of constitutions to the world? These
are the questions which are of vital moment both to Englishmen
and foreigners. A few years must give the answer, but only a
prophet could reply to them to-day.</p>
 <p> The great fact in the political situation in England is that the
party system which underlay political life for three centuries has
broken down. Its machinery is exhausted or hopelessly out of
repair. Its energies are distracted. What was once a whole is split
up into factions and sects, which reduce each other to paralysis
and impotence. There is only one progressive principle at work
in English politics. It is Radicalism; it is the revolutionary spirit.
I see before me a rabble of followers led by a few daring, astute,
perhaps unscrupulous chiefs. What is the policy of these leaders?
It is to plunge everything into the crucible. The more disturbing
the issue, the more prompt they are to raise it. Every cause they
support is an interest attacked. That is their universal method.
They depreciate values by threatening property. One day it is
land; the next it is incomes, from whatever source derived; wealth
itself, because it is wealth, for which they propose a graduated tax.
But to menace and destroy marks with them only the
commencement. It is the essential preliminary to the process of reconstruction.


<pb n="133" id="p.133">

 Having brought landlords and the owners of any kind of
property to despair, and to the very brink of ruin, the Radical
leaders turn round and say, " Halt! it is enough; we have satisfied
you that you are in our hands, and that you ought to consider
yourselves fortunate if you escape, we will not say with an acre or
a sovereign, but with your life. However, we will be merciful.
We are a great party. We can, therefore, afford to be just, to be
generous. You shall retain positively the better part of that which
is your own, be it land or money. The rest is for the State, for the
public good, for us. Do you see in us your despoilers? Not so.
Behold in us rather your saviours."</p>
<p>  These, I repeat, are, so far as one can judge at present, the
tactics of the Radical chiefs. They have no other strategy. Their one
and only plan is to create a tempest in a teacup, a washing-basin,
or a sponge-bath, and then to make a show of quelling it. To adopt
a metaphor from the City, they are perpetually "bearing " stock in
order that they may "bull" it. How long the English people will
tolerate these grotesque and hazardous methods who shall say ?
But is it not clear that, if they are persevered in, there must
ultimately be little in England either to bull or to bear, and that it will
be useless for Radicals to move the elements, to create the storm,
because there will no longer exist the material of salvage to rescue?</p>
 <p>  On the other hand, what are the Conservatives? What are their
 aims and their policy? what their future? Their chief idea just
 now would seem to be to abuse their opponents for remaining in
 office, and to shrink from taking their place. In no single instance
 since the death of Beaconsfield have they shown the courage of
 their convictions. Their more active spirits are always seeking
 how they can outbid their opponents, how trump the socialistic
 card which the Radical plays. Lord Salisbury vies with Mr.
Gladstone in pandering to Demos-the sole King in England. I see no
 sign of their resorting to any new expedient. There is no one
 among them who shows himself capable of grasping the situation,
 supplying by his own action and initiative what it needs. Disraeli
 was a man of commanding genius, who by an accident found
himself at the head of the Conservative party. But he was not a
Conservative. He succeeded because he was the cleverest man the
 Conservatives could find. He achieved a brilliant personal triumph,
 and he reflected its lustre upon his political followers. Naturally,
 therefore, when he departed the whole fabric was dissolved. Men

<pb n="134" id="p.134">



of his gifts will always be rare. The Conservatives, if they are to
do anything, must not wait till Disraeli's genius re appears. May
not, after all, mediocrity suit them better than genius? mediocrity
of a high stamp, but mediocrity all the same. For instance, have
they ever had a leader who did them better service, till he was
overthrown, than the great Sir Robert Peel? He was a man of business
pre-eminently. He had made the financial system of the country
his study. The City trusted him. If the Conservatives are wise,
they will see whether they cannot discover or develop another man
of business upon the same lines as Sir Robert Peel. But is there a
chance of this?  It is in the knowledge and aptitude of business
that the Conservatives are wanting. Many of them are ludicrously
ignorant of affairs-more are the victims of fallacies and delusions.
The nation of shopkeepers knows this too well. In its despair it
trusts itself to the Liberals, not because it likes them or admires
them, but because, of two evils, it prefers the evil which, rightly
or wrongly, it considers the less.</p>
<p>  There is one danger to themselves which the Radical politicians
of England ought to reckon with. The English idol is
respectability, and property is only a mode of respectability. In England
no one is accounted respectable who has not got a balance at
his banker's. When, therefore, the Radicals threaten, if they do
threaten, property, they are making war upon the image which
the true-born Briton bows down and worships. They therefore
run the risk of being branded with the stigma of disrepute. In
France it is ridicule which kills; in England it is the reproach of
being disreputable. Gambetta tried to extinguish Clemenceau by
calling him a disreputable politician. He never did him a greater
service; but if Gambetta and Clemenceau had both been
Englishmen, and the same language had been employed, very different
consequences might have ensued.</p>

<p>   THERE is, as I shall have now made clear, no society in London
which can be called political rather than legal, diplomatic or
sporting. For the political elements, even in the society in which they
preponderate, coalesce with others and are moulded into a tolerably
homogeneous whole. Is there any society which can be styled par
excellence literary, artistic, or theatrical? Yes, and no. Society of
the best kind does not admit of the application to it of these epithets.
Writers, painters, and players are occasionally seen by ones, twos,
and threes in society; but they do not give it its tone. On the
contrary, they derive their tone from it. They have their clubs and
coteries, their bachelor dinner-parties, and their other
entertainments, which may be called literary, theatrical, musical, artistic, as
the case may be, and which are graced by London society's
recognized representatives, perhaps by Royalty itself.  Then there are
certain inferior social circles where the gentlemen of the play, the
brush, or the buskin, instead of being, as in the fine world,
nonentities, are personages of the highest consideration.</p>
<p>  Let me explain my meaning by a few instances. Lord Tennyson
is very seldom seen in any section of London society. It is rare for
him to come up to London. When he does so, he takes a house in
the Belgravian quarter, dines with, or himself entertains, men of
such eminence as the Prime-minister and the Lord Chancellor, or,
if the weather chances to be fine, and he is in an exceptionally
goodhumor, honors the afternoon receptions of notoriety-hunting hosts

<pb n="136" id="p.136">



or hostesses with his presence. Mr. Browning, the poet of
incomprehensible mannerism, the taste for whose writing in England is
probably to be explained in the same way as the popularity of
double acrostics, is an altogether different person. He lives for
society, and in society. If he cannot be at the houses of the great,
he is satisfied to be seen at the establishments of the small. But he
must be in evidence. He is an agreeable man-full of anecdote
accommodated to his audience, profound or superficial, light or
serious, literary, scientific, poetic, historical, or what you will. He
is more than a septuagenarian; yet he enjoys the mild distractions
of the most commonplace drawing-rooms with the unsophisticated
freshness of early youth. He has the vanity, as characteristic as
irritability itself, of the race of bards. His venerable fascinations
are, as he piques himself on believing, irresistible by ladies of all
ages and all degrees. He does not trumpet forth his conquests to
miscellaneous assemblages, but he is fond of telling the favored
fair of his achievements among their number. Mr. Browning is a
professional diner-out, and has not yet satiated his appetite for
evening- parties. If peers and peeresses, plutocrats of high
degree, and others well placed in the London world, do not happen
to invite him, he condescends to shine in the firmaments of society's
minor queens.</p>
<p>  The region in which he thus finds himself is, to the social student,
the most curious imaginable. Poets, painters and players,
publicists, critics and essayists abound. The women are mostly the
wives of professional men, not a few of them lion-hunters by
calling, and assiduous in their attention to those whom they style
notabilities. They, as well as their husbands and their families,
not only admire, I doubt not, sincerely, genius for genius's sake,
but see in its representatives connecting links between their own
bourgeois orbit and the sphere of what is called society. The poet
and the artist, the actor or actress, sometimes the humble journalist
himself, are looked upon less as messengers from the region of
intellect-interpreters of divine and noble thoughts to ordinary men
and women-than as heralds from the smart and fashionable world
of which it is their privilege to have more than a glimpse, and in
some of the mysteries of which they are supposed to be initiated.</p>
<p>  Men like Mr. Browning, who are quite as much courtiers, even
parasites, by profession as they are poets or men of letters by
achievement, touch with one hand the social circles of the middle

    <pb n="137" id="p.137">

class, and with the other the very ark of the fashionable covenant
itself. From that depository of snobbery there is transmitted a
magnetic current which runs through the body of the bard, and
thrills with its agitating impulses the system of his humble
worshippers.</p>
<p>  Mr. Matthew Arnold is another orb of literary light in the social
empyrean. He is less conspicuously or aggressively the man of the
world, pure and simple, than Mr. Browning. He has more of
obvious refinement and breeding, and betrays scarcely any tendency
to parade his familiarity with London society. On the other hand,
he abounds in affectations, conceits, and vanity. But, paradox as
it may seem, these rather heighten than detract from the charm of
the man. He lets you know that he is on the best terms
conceivable with himself, but he does it in a manner so bland, polished,
and gentle, that you mentally decide that he would be difficult to
please if he were not so. How, one asks instinctively, could he
help liking such an agreeable self ? Mr. Matthew Arnold is in
every sense of the word a highly-bred, high-spirited gentleman.</p>
<p>  Over these qualities he casts the lustre of a well-stored and
disciplined intellect. He is an acute and powerful critic as well as a
charming poet. He has done more to place his countrymen en
rapport with the best of French literature than any other intellectual
teacher of his day. He is a witty and amiable talker, seldom
flippant, always entertaining, sometimes serious, never a pedant,
occasionally satirical, but rarely spiteful. He is adored by his family,
and comes under the category of spoiled fathers. Young ladies in
general worship him. He is fond of comfort, luxury, and ease, as
well as content, when necessity demands, with plain living and
high thinking. The houses which he chiefly loves to frequent are
those whose interior is so calculated to please the sense of eye,
taste, and smell as Mr. and Mrs. Cyril Flower's, Lord and Lady
Rosebery's, and other opulent or titled hosts. Curiously enough,
he seems to be better known to-day as a writer of prose than of
poetry. Fifty years hence it will be forgotten that he ever wrote
prose at all. Much of his verse has the stamp of immortality. His
essays on literature or religion are written for the day, and are
merely pieces of journalistic causerie.</p>
<p>  Mr. Lecky is another ambassador from the community of letters
well received by London society. Tall, with a bland, meek
countenance, a voice suggestive of spun silk, a manner expressive now

<pb n="138" id="p.138">



of dogmatic positiveness and now significant of dreamy abstraction,
he is a pleasant and improving rather than an enlivening
companion. His wife is Dutch, a lady of more esprit than is usually
possessed by her nation or by the wives of literary men generally.</p>
 <p> There are two other considerable English historians who are to
be seen frequently, in the English capital, outside their libraries or
studies-Froude and Kinglake. The former is the first of living
writers of English prose. As years have gone by they have brought
with them no deterioration of quality in his style. With the
exception possibly of Cardinal Newman, he is the only wielder of the
English tongue who can play upon it with the same felicity and
evoke from it the same subtle modulations of tone as the notes of a
musical instrument yield when manipulated by a performer of the
highest order. Mr. Froude's social manner is a little too gentle
and a little too feline. The eyes are somewhat too visibly busy in
their operations.  They too evidently take in everything that is
passing. There is, too, a sternness of expression, almost a cruelty,
in the neighborhood of the lips which causes one to suspect that
Mr. Froude's elaborate gentleness and studied suavity are the veil
of an implacable resentment when it is once excited, and of a
contempt for, and disbelief in, human nature at large.</p>
<p>  Mr. Kinglake's appearance is venerable and chivalrous. He has
seen the world and every sort of society, both in London and in
Europe. He has lived among politicians, great writers, and wits.
He belongs rather to the generation of Palmerston, Delane,
Thackeray, Hayward, and Bernal Osborne, than to that of to-day. He
opened up the East half a century ago to English travellers. The
volume in which he recorded his impressions of it marked an epoch
in English literature. He has known Paris-the Paris of thirty
years ago-as well as London, and one of his chief grounds of
quarrel with Napoleon III. was purely personal. With the
exception of his deafness, he is in possession of all his faculties. His
memory is as remarkable as his humor. It is the memory not of a
statistician, but of a philosophic historian. He can trust to his
generalizations from scattered experiences as implicitly as if they
were all docketed in commercial form.</p>
<p>  Mr. Laurence Oliphant can scarcely be reckoned now among the
literati of London. But he moves in a mysterious way, comes and
goes without warning, and may be on the banks of the Thames
before the season is over. Although absent, he is not forgotten.
LITTERATEURS IN SOCIETY. -JOURNALISM.   <pb n="139" id="p.139">

His fame lives in the lips of countless acquaintances, who keep up
the tradition of his friendship. He scintillates pretty constantly in
magazine articles, and recently published, in a spirit of ponderous
whim, a totally unreadable and incomprehensible volume. Nature
intended Mr. Oliphant for a publicist, a social satirist, an author of
clever sketches and stories of the world or of jeux d'esprit.  A
curious twist in his temperament and a yearning after notoriety
made him a sort of Pall Mall Messiah; the evangelist of a gospel
modishly mystical, the hierophant in drawing-rooms and boudoirs
of a religion the primary object of whose worship was Mr.
Oliphant himself.</p>
<p>  Few Englishmen are so widely known. His fame is spread
through the United States of America. He has lived in Paris and
in most other European capitals. He began life as a diplomatist,
and he discovered the famous French correspondent of the Times,
M. Blowitz. He has made several forms of superstition fashionable,
and I doubt whether the idea of esoteric Buddhism would have
occurred to any of its latter-day prophets but for his example. He
unites in himself, if I may say so without disrespect, the practical
acuteness of the Yankee and the visionary dreaminess of the
Oriental. He is always hovering between Nirvana and New York. On
the other side of the Atlantic lie has become infected with the
contagion of a Barnum. His Asiatic and European experiences have
caused him to engage in the attempt to mingle Barnumism with
Occultism.  Decidedly a droll creature, this-one of whom it is
difficult to say whether, had his nature been traversed by a less
pronounced vein of eccentricity, he would have been more famous or
more useful.</p>
<p>  Mr. Laurence Oliphant is the pattern on which several London
litrateurs seem to have modelled themselves. Some of them have
burlesqued his oddities; others have been satisfied to reproduce the
blend of society and authorship impersonated in him. To this
latter order belong Mr. Hamilton Aide, a drawing-room writer,
fond of entertaining his friends and being entertained by them;
and Mr. Augustus Hare, who writes, as in conversation he tells
stories, for a select public, chiefly composed of dowagers and
spinsters of mature years. Had this gentleman been born in a different
sphere he might have emulated the great Cook himself-without
whose aid it is said the English Government could not have planned
their Nile expedition-in the chosen path of his genius. For Mr.

<pb n="140" id="p.140">



Hare is an adept at personally conducting tourist-parties composed
of well-to-do matrons of quality on the Continent, or of showing
them the sights of Old London.</p>
<p>  I have often heard it said that the reading public in England is
almost exclusively composed of women, and certainly popularity
with ladies is indispensable to the success of young authors.
Before Mr. Oscar Wilde founded the worship of the sunflower, he
made, I am given to understand, a kind of reputation by
endeavoring, I know not with what success, to teach Mrs. Langtry Greek.
This is a very clever and long-headed young man indeed. He
always reminds me of Brutus, who, for purposes of his own and
with triumphant results, feigned idiocy.  Mr. Oscar Wilde saw
that if anything was to be done with a capital of moderate talents,
it was necessary to create a sensation. Having secured, with the
help of a few popular or well-known ladies, an audience, he
proceeded to pose as the high-priest of AEstheticism. Men laughed at
him; but it was a sort of folly that paid. Mr. Wilde presented the
appearance of a fribble, calculated his arrangements to nicety. If
he was laughed at he could afford to laugh at others, and kept his
tongue in his cheek. He has had imitators, whose names I cannot
remember, but he has never been eclipsed in the peculiar metier
of his choice.</p>
<p>  As women seem in London to have the power of creating literary
success, so they are sometimes ambitious of that success
themselves. Indeed, among the ladies of particular coteries it is nearly
the exception to encounter one who does not write.    The
truth, I suppose, is that the circulating libraries must be
supplied, and it does not probably much matter with what. Some
of these dames of the pen go a good deal into society. Mrs.
Singleton, best known by her nom de plume of " Violet Fane," is
the best representative of a numerous tribe. She has uncommon
powers of satirical description and dialogue. She is a poet, and
she has in high perfection the conversational art, possessed by
some fashionable and well-bred women, of uttering the most
audacious or pungent sentiments in a voice of resigned melancholy,
reproving naivete, or childish simplicity.</p>
<p>  I now come to an entirely different department of literature, if
literature it can be called-Journalism. The journalist, it is
customary to say, is powerful in England, and I believe that the
multitude of those who are desirous of adding journalism to their

    <pb n="141" id="p.141">

regular occupations is, as the sands of the sea-shore, innumerable.
But men who mould public opinion by their writing have seldom
the opportunity or the inclination to mix with society. Certain
it is that one only catches fleeting glimpses of them. But does
journalism in England mould public opinion, or what are the
relations in which it stands to it? If the articles one reads in the
newspapers were a fair reflection of the national mind upon any
given subject, and at any particular crisis, then it would follow
that whenever the press is excited the country must be excited too.
But is that the case? Nothing of the kind. The London
newspapers, in the morning and the evening, lash themselves into a
fury over the shortcomings of English ministers in every quarter
of the globe. Thousands and scores of thousands of Englishmen
throughout the country read those diatribes and invectives, for the
most part admirably written, with warm approval.</p>
 <p> But nothing comes of them. The public no more thinks of
acting in accordance with their precepts than it does of taking as its
rule of life the high-flown sentiments in the drama which it has
just been applauding. Journalism stimulates the people only in
theory. The leading articles, though the assertion may seem a
contradiction in terms, are absolutely ineffective because they are
so effective. The average Briton, after having read one of them,
acts precisely as the pious church-goer does who has listened to a
sermon which has kindled within his bosom a glow of emotion.
Church-goer and newspaper-reader alike do their duty. Sermon
and article equally discharge the function of a safety-valve. The
press interprets what it declares to be the deliberate conviction of
the nation, and the nation, having said " Quite so !" goes on its
way.</p>
<p>  It has been said that one of the consequences of the French
Revolution was to supersede the priesthood of the Church by the
priesthood of the pen. Exactly; and just as the tendency of
ecclesiastical sacerdotalism was to relieve individuals of any
necessity for being religious themselves, so the tendency of journalistic
sacerdotalism is to relieve them of any necessity of political
exertion, or of bringing popular pressure to bear upon those in power.
The average Briton consults his newspaper with the same
awestricken confidence as the pious Roman used to consult the entrails.
But in the former case, unlike the latter, the business begins and
ends with consultation. If the English journalist is to do anything,

<pb n="142" id="p.142">



 it must be because he can rouse his readers to act. But to
the latter it appears that their duty terminates with the perusal of
the article. The journalist, therefore, does not spur the multitude.
He rather, albeit unconsciously and with the best intent,
administers to them an anodyne or a soporific.</p>
<p>  Journalism, from the point of view from which I shall look at it
here, is interesting as affording a social link between politics and
literature. In the present House of Commons there are
exceedingly few men, as it is natural for Frenchmen to estimate them,
who have achieved anything like eminence as publicists. There
are several newspaper proprietors and, especially among the Irish,
a host of journalistic dabblers. Mr. Justin McCarthy, a
novelist as well as a writer of articles, is the one Hibernian senator of
any literary importance, and he has done himself harm by
taking to a parliamentary career. He has, that is to say, created for
himself a false position. He- has transformed himself from an
English litterateur into an Irish politician. Among English
ministers the only ex-journalist is Sir William Harcourt, of whom I
have already had occasion to speak; though Mr. Courtney, till
lately a Treasury official, was another.</p>
<p>  The House of Commons to-day contains but a single publicist
and author of real distinction, Mr. John Morley. Mr. Morley
continues to combine the profession of politics with that of literature,
and, marvellous to say, neither suffers by the union. He is,
however, the exception which proves the rule. Much of his literary
career was a political apprenticeship. Many of his best books are
political studies. Above all, he is a Radical by conviction.
Unlike many, or most, effective writers for the press, he has a natural
gift for oratory and debate. So far as I have been able to judge, I
should say the effect of his literary training upon him had been,
not, as is usually the case, to make his speeches academic, but to
imbue him with a holy hatred of commonplace. Though good
houses are open to him, he goes sparingly into society; though he
has received enough homage and flattery to spoil him, he assumes
none of the airs of the oracle. He is a quite gentlemanlike man of
the world, easy and unaffected, never straining artificially after
conversational effects, with just enough bitterness to give flavor to
his comments, and with a keen sense of humor and fun.</p>
 <p> Mr. Henry Labouchere is in every respect, save that he too is
a professed Radical, a contrast to Mr. Morley. He has never
   <pb n="143" id="p.143">

given himself to serious literary work, but he is an admirable
writer of short, sententious, pithy paragraphs, spiced with not
offensive personality, and sometimes quite delightful in their
daring. The truth is, he has taken up publicism as he has taken
up-and never, perhaps, when his real purpose is considered, quite
unsuccessfully-many other things. Long years. I am prepared to
believe, were required before he could divest himself of that native
modesty which shrinks instinctively from publicity, and recoils in
positive horror from the idea of vulgar fame. But at last he
overcame this ingenuous weakness, and, if he will forgive me for
saying so, I am persuaded that notoriety is now to him as the breath
of his nostrils.</p>
<p>  Supremely indifferent to the praise or blame of his fellow-
creatures, he cannot live without occupation, and the one occupation
lie cares for is that which, while it contributes to the moral
improvement of the human race, does not in too marked a manner
avert their glance from himself. Thus, he started some years ago
a weekly newspaper, as he had before run a theatre, and
distinguished himself as a besieged resident in Paris. As a politician it
is natural to him never quite to be satisfied with the advance made
by the leaders of his party along the path he indicates. If he
supports a ministry he is, by a law of his being, in opposition to it as
well. He is not so much a follower of Mr. Gladstone or Mr.
Chamberlain, a Liberal or a Radical--he is Henry Labouchere.</p>
  <p>Few men of the day have made their mark so plainly in so many
careers. Mere fussiness would not have enabled him to do this.
His mind is strong as well as acute. He has been pitted against
some of the hardest heads in the City of London, and has proved
himself their equal. He is a prodigious worker, though
methodically unmethodical. His faculties are always on the alert. His
mind and, so far as is necessary for the processes of his mind, his
body, is as severely in training as a prize-fighter's. He takes no
exercise. He smokes cigarettes incessantly, but he never drinks,
and he seldom eats. He is a pure Rechabite-not on principle, but
from preference. In London society he is seldom seen. He has a
capital establishment in town, and, near town, another on the
banks of the Thames. He is a great authority on all matters
theatrical. He is now quite domesticated.  Hospitable, and never
happier than when lie is entertaining parties, big or small, of the
complexion which London society designates as Bohemian, he is

<pb n="144" id="p.144">



certainly a favorite. Even those who most disagree with, and
disapprove of, the political doctrines which he affects, speak of
him almost affectionately as "Labby."</p>
<p>  His name is greeted as a household word, and is sure to raise an
appreciative laugh on any stage or platform on which it is mentioned.
He is, perhaps, the one man in England who has an unlimited
power of startling society without shocking it. This is partly
because he is never supposed to be quite in earnest, never taken quite
literally or au serieux; partly, too, because there are certain laws
of taste which he seldom violates ; partly, and perhaps principally,
because he is credited with many of those attributes which
Englishmen admire with blind loyalty. He has, that is to say, the
cachet of what can only be described as "swelldom." He was born
to social position and to fortune ;was the nephew of a highly
respectable and pious uncle, who ultimately became a peer, and who
left him a fortune, or the nucleus of a fortune. His
educational training, Eton, Cambridge, and diplomacy, were all eminently
aristocratic. London society, therefore, if it sees in him a brebis
egare, sees in him also a sheep between whom and the fold there
yet exists a certain connection. Then he has been favorably
regarded by royalty. He has, in a word, a certain breeding which,
co-operating with a shrewd, cool judgment and a wide
knowledge of the world, prevents him from being offensive. He may
regard life and all its concerns, political or social, as a game, but he
knows the laws of the game, and these laws he never violates.
Some persons may wonder how and why he is tolerated; this is
the explanation, a sufficient one.</p>
<p>  To London society the daily journal is a reality, but the
journalist scarcely a name; rather a nonentity. It is only the infusion of
the commercial and the political, the business-like and
statesmanlike elements, into the social, which occasionally acquaints London
society with the identity and patronymic of the London editor.
Since the days of Delane, there has been no conductor-in-chief of
any London newspaper who has figured as a personage in society.
Sir Algernon Borthwick, now the doyen of the London press, is
indeed an exception. But then his social position is independent
of the happy accident which makes him proprietor and
conductorin-chief-the acting editor being a worthy and genial justice of the
peace, Mr. Hardman-of the Morning Post. It is as a servant of
society first and a fellow of the press afterwards that, assisted by
   <pb n="145" id="p.145">

his gifted and popular wife, he has secured for his house the
prestige of a brilliant social centre. Every one who is any one goes to
"the Borthwicks'," and every one is proud of going there. There
are no hosts who have achieved a success more indisputable-none
who are kindlier and worthier. But one might exhaust the
vocabulary of praise and compliment over these charming people.
Society in London would not be society without them. The chief of
the editorial staff of the Times is Mr. Buckle, a gentleman in the
bloom of early manhood, an Oxford scholar, of singularly
prepossessing manner and appearance, quiet, self-possessed, with an air
of tranquil determination and unaggressive self-assurance about
him, the irreproachable embodiment of a discreet caution. The
opinions of the Times are often criticised, and its policy condemned.
This I regard as a tribute to its power. One may be sure that the
articles published in a daily broad-sheet would not excite such
animated differences of estimate unless their intrinsic importance
were felt on every side. And is it not probable that the men who
are responsible for the conduct of the Times, the sagacious, if
unsympathetic and frigid, Mr. Walter, whose experience is great and
whose insight into English feeling is not contemptible, as well as
those who are associated with him in the management of the
journal, may know their own business quite as well as those who
cavil at them?</p>
<p>  The editor of the Times occupies, and always will occupy, a
position among English journalists entirely unique. The institution
he controls is not only a great English newspaper. In the opinion
of foreigners, and in the opinion of many Englishmen too, it is
the greatest of newspapers; perhaps the only great newspaper in
the United Kingdom. After the Sovereign and the Premier comes
the Lord Mayor-so, at least, many of my compatriots think; after
the Lord Mayor comes the Times, and nothing will ever eradicate
from the Continental mind, whether in the case of politicians or of
the masses, the belief that the views expressed by the Times are
inspired by the Government of the day. This is a delusion, of
course, but it is one of those delusions which die hard, which are
almost immortal.</p>
 <p> The editor of the Standard is Mr. Mudford. He does not make
his presence in London society too cheap. He is a busy man, and
he has, quite an unusual thing for the British editor, literary
tastes. He understands his craft better than most of his contemporaries,

<pb n="146" id="p.146">



 and has the power (exceedingly rare among English
journalists, who are not, for the most part, men of the world, and
who try to acquire an importance which, as a matter-of-fact, they
never win, by professing extravagant loyalty to a party which
ignores them) of looking at any political conjuncture with
judicial impartiality, be he Mr. Mudford or any other. The
danger is lest the ablest of editors, for the very reason that he does
from time to time so successfully identify himself with public
opinion, should, when a critical emergency arises, mistake effect
for cause, and assume that what he says is, for the mere reason
that he says it, the interpretation of public opinion. So well has
he played the part of exponent, that at last he imagines there can
be nothing to be expounded apart from his own ideas. A little
more imagination, and perhaps a dash more cynicism, would help
him to avoid this error. Before one can be a political prophet one
must succeed in divesting one's self not only of all partisanship,
but, a far more difficult matter, of all conceit; the only quality to
be trusted to is that which is purely intellectual, and which, in
pronouncing on a given situation, is perfectly unbiassed, unelated
by the memory of its past successes. Mr. Mudford's social
manner at once impresses you in his favor. No one could pronounce
him anything but a strong man. When he talks, he talks wisely;
and if there is anything worth hearing, he listens well.</p>
 <p> Among other journalists known in London society as journalists
are Mr. Lawson of the <title>Daily Telegraph</title>, Mr. Hill and Mr.
Robinson of the <title>Daily News</title>, Mr. Greenwood of the <title>St. James's Gazette</title>,
and various gentlemen to whom I have, at different times, had the
honor of being presented as responsible for the Pall Mall Gazette.
Plump, well kept, exuberant, prosperous, ever smiling,
humorous and cheerful, Mr. Lawson is something more than one of the
proprietors and editors of the Daily Telegraph. He is an
exceedingly wealthy man, partly the result of business success, and
partly of the well-directed munificence of opulent relatives. He
entertains lavishly at his town house and his country house, is the
father of a son about to become a member of Parliament, and of
another in the Guards. As I have elsewhere intimated, his
newspaper is one of the authors of Mr. Gladstone's political fame; but
he is too shrewd and sagacious to indulge his vanity by dwelling
on this circumstance; and though I should think that few steps of
importance were taken in the office of his newspaper without his
   <pb n="147" id="p.147">

cognizance, or approval, or initiative, the role of which he is most
fond is that of a country squire compelled by the pressure of
political business and patriotic emotions not unfrequently to visit
London.</p>
<p>  Mr. Hill is laudably assiduous in his attendance at the social
functions of the leaders of the party to which his paper, the Daily
News, is attached. He is a man with a quiet, dry manner, who
improves on acquaintance, and who has a power, unparalleled among
his journalistic colleagues, of saying trenchant and biting things in
a quiet, even an amiable, way. He generally strikes the stranger
as too much of the philosopher and too little of the politician.
Perhaps nature meant him rather for the scholar's library and
writing-table than for the newspaper-office. Mr. Greenwood, on the
other hand, with much literary knowledge and training; as
competent a judge, I should say, as exists in London of literary finish
and efficiency; himself a writer of singular verve and incisiveness,
has, with experience, contracted many of the associations, and
imbibed many of the sentiments, of a statesman. He is reputed to
be violent, even venomous, in his literary onslaughts on politicians
and their policies. But really in journalism one must study effect,
and if Mr. Greenwood writes at a white heat of indignation, or
prompts others to do so, it does not follow that he himself can form
no estimate of men and of affairs unprejudiced and cool to
freezingpoint.</p>
<p>  There are other points of social convergence briefly to be
illustrated between periodical literature and politics. Mr. Henry Reeve,
the editor of the <title>Edinburgh Review</title>, when he is not suffering from
gout or at his country estate, is often to be met with in the
diningrooms and drawing-rooms of the hosts and hostesses of London
society. He may be likened to a highly modernized edition of Dr.
Johnson.  Tall, portly, quite elderly and almost dignified, he
utters alike paradoxes and platitudes with a volume and depth of
voice implying that there is no appeal against them. Many years
have elapsed since he was obliging enough to take French literature
and politics, in a word, everything to do with France, under his
protection. He acts, or at one time he acted, as a species of
English Consul-General for French literature, and there is perhaps
no well-known translation of a French work of importance so
unsatisfactory as Mr. Reeve's version of De Tocqueville's
<title>"Democracy in America."</title> It is a tradition with him to be on good terms

<pb n="148" id="p.148">



with the successive occupants of the French Embassy in
London.   Society, politics, history, philosophy, and letters, on
every branch of these Mr. Reeve claims to speak with oracular
authority. Then, too, lie affects to act as the interpreter of the
esoteric ideas of Whiggism, that droll political composite of
assumption and timidity.</p>
 <p> The editor of the Quarterly Review, Dr. William Smith, is,
notwithstanding his years and his responsibility, a cheery and genial
gentleman. He pretends to be nothing more than he is, a keen,
experienced impresario, with enough of varied erudition and insight
into popular feeling to be a trustworthy judge upon any ordinary
topic without being infallible. He lacks the slightly pretentious
pomposity of Mr. Reeve. If he magnifies his apostleship, it is within
narrower limits and in a less aggressive way. He does not affect
to be so deeply behind the scenes as the editor of the Edinburgh
Review, but he is, for all that, well informed, thoroughly pleasant
and instructive to talk with.</p>
<p>  Periodical literature is also represented in London society by
the conductors of one or two miscellanies who occupy a position
midway between that of the editor of a daily paper and of a
quarterly review. Mr. Knowles, the editor of the Nineteenth
Century, has the same craze for social omniscience which I have
repeatedly observed among the private secretaries of ministers or
the more aspiring of Foreign Office clerks. The world is his
oyster; society his happy hunting-ground, useful and attractive
to him mainly as offering him recruits for a magazine in which the
order of social precedence is rigidly observed. Dukes and
marquises first, then peers of inferior degree, then bishops and
philosophers, the procession being wound up by any poor devils who have
contrived to puff themselves into momentary notoriety. If you are
worth knowing from Mr. Knowles's point of view, it must be either
because you can help him with his magazine, or because you know
some person else who may be useful for that purpose. He is, as
it is his business to be, an acute, calculating little man, always, as
a look at him is enough to tell you, engaged in mentally
reckoning as to whether A. or B. or C. can forward his enterprise, and, if
so, up to what point. To Mr. Knowles, who displays, if it is
permissible to employ a vernacular expression, all his wares in his
shop-window, there could be no greater contrast than the editor of
the Fortnightly Review, Mr. Escott, who, though I suppose he must
   <pb n="149" id="p.149">

give some attention to his professional pursuits, and has the credit
of understanding them, never alludes to them in conversation, and
when talking is not easily enticed into the expression of an opinion
about them or about any other matter. This may be wise, but life
is short, and on the occasions on which I have met him it has not
seemed to me to be worth while to induce him to break his not too
conciliatory or courteous reserve.</p>
 <p> Lord Houghton is one of the most distinguished and gradually
disappearing links which exist between society and literature. His
intellectual faculties are undimmed. Age has now overtaken him,
but the glory of his younger brilliancy and his enjoyment of life
and its good things has not abated. With the exception of a
slight deafness, he is a victim to no infirmity peculiarly incidental
to his years. He is still indefatigable as an after-dinner speaker,
and can talk, whether in public or in private, in an air half
romantic, half satirical, the secret of whose charm none of his juniors
seems to have discovered. He has been the acquaintance or the
intimate friend of almost every man of distinction in politics,
literature, diplomacy, or science, who has lived during the last
halfcentury. He has, moreover, given the world much that it prizes
and will preserve in prose and poetry. If he is sometimes the
theme of merriment to his friends, his accomplishments can never
be anything but the subject of admiration. He has seen the world
in many aspects far outside the limits of his own country, has
popularized and embellished travel, and has delighted more than one
generation of wits in Continental capitals with the whimsicalities of
his wit and his paradoxical conceits.</p>
<p>  As for the novelists of London, their name is legion, but to
London society they are names only. Mr. Wilkie Collins leads
the life of a recluse. Other masters of fiction avoid the capital as
much as possible; and as for the lady novelists, they either work
too hard to have any time to spend upon society, or they limit their
appearance in it to visits paid in fashionable country houses.</p>
 <p> One editor of a weekly paper has been already presented to the
leader in the person of Mr. Labouchlere. Mr. Edmund Yates,
though not, like Mr. Labouchere, a Member of Parliament, is as
little unknown as he is to London society. Vivacious as a talker,
well equipped as a raconteur, he has the twin gift of a tenacious
memory and a quick eye. He is one of the comparatively few
men of letters in London whose memory carries them back to the

<pb n="150" id="p.150">

period when society appreciated literary sparkle in its conversation
more than it does to-day. Full of vitality and vigor, he makes his
presence felt wherever he is. His most characteristic gifts, his
pleasantry, his antitheses, his neatness of expression, are French
rather than English.</p>
  <p>The fortunes of Punch, the London Chaivari, are directed by
Mr. Burnand, a gentleman who, though so immersed in his
occupations that he has little time to spare for society, is welcomed in
many sections of it when he can be induced to lay his professional
labors aside. His appearance, with his bushy eyebrows, his hair
brushed well back from his forehead, and, above all, the black
cravat which he affects in evening dress, is Gallic rather than
British. He is a farceur of the best type, gifted, like Mr. Yates, with
a liberal allowance of histrionic power, and never more amused
than when he is amusing. But he has higher qualities. That he
is possessed of no ordinary strength of judgment as well as fertility
of resource is shown by the skill and success with which he
conducts what is one of the most remarkable papers in the world. In
England Punch has provoked many imitations; none of them has
touched or even seriously threatened its ascendency. The secret
of humorously interpreting with pen and pencil the superficial or
the deeper sentiments of the hour rests with it and with it alone.</p>
  <p>Between the editors of the Saturday Review and the Spectator
there is, at any rate as regards personal appearance, a marked
dissimilarity. Mr. Walter Pollock, the conductor of the former
journal, the gifted member of a gifted family, a model of grace and
breeding and the best fencer in England, is tall, slight, with fair
hair and beard. Mr. Hutton and Mr. Meredith Townsend, who
control the Spectator, are each of them gentlemen of middle age,
with the look of philosophers and teachers rather than of men of
pleasure or society. Yet they both of them are to be met with in
society. Mr. Hutton is the friend of Mr. Gladstone, whom he not
seldom entertains at dinner, while wherever authorities on the
Indian Empire of England are, there is Mr. Townsend likely to
be found in the midst of them.

   <p>WHILE journalists and men of letters are content to be merged
in the common crowd in London society, artists and actors stand
forth from it in prominent relief. They are personages. They
insist on making themselves seen and heard. Not, indeed, qua artists
and actors, but qua gentlemen or ladies of fashion. The odd thing
is that, assuming the airs of people of the highest social
consideration, the actors are perpetually asking themselves what their
position is. As a matter of fact, it is, with the exception of their
womankind, what it always was. The actress in society is a novel
feature. Madame Christine Nilsson, the prima donna, visits Lady
Salisbury. Mrs. Bancroft-Marie Wilton-visits Lady Hayter, to
say nothing of other ladies of social distinction, peeresses by the
score thrown in.</p>
  <p>This is exactly what might have been expected. London society
is, in a sense, stage-struck. It takes the same sort of interest in
associating with the ornaments of the stage as boys feel in making
the acquaintance of ballet-dancers. There is a certain prurient
prudishness, a salacious inquisitiveness, about London society. It
loves to hover over, or alight on, the borderland which separates
conventional respectability from downright dissoluteness. There
is nothing which it so dearly loves as a soupcon of naughtiness. I
never see that well-known picture of two young ladies peering into
a volume which they have taken down from a shelf in the paternal
library-"Forbidden Fruit," I think it is called-and reading in
it things which make them alternately smile and blush, without

<pb n="152" id="p.152">



recognizing the pictorial symbol, the engraved allegory of London
society. What, to it, is the mystery of holiness in comparison with
the mystery of sin ? Who would not sooner contemplate the lives
of the sinners than the lives of the saints ? London society is
infinitely charitable, because its curiosity knows no bounds. One of
the reasons why it welcomes actresses is that it surrounds them,
rightly or wrongly, with a halo of antecedents and environment
which leave much to the imagination.</p>
  <p>Not, indeed, that in the social demeanor of these ladies there is
anything to gratify, or to promise the gratification, of any tastes
which are other than puritanical in their severe respectability.
With the single exception that they are more demonstrative than
ordinary Englishwomen, more anxious to fix attention upon
themselves, they might be the wives of barristers or bishops. They are
the incarnation of everything that is orthodox in British
matronhood. Mrs. Kendal, one of the best artists of her sex on the
London stage, is in private life the epitome of all the domestic virtues
and graces. She has a husband, himself a worthy actor, and
bearing the same relation to a gentleman of fashion as the private in a
Yeomanry cavalry regiment does to an officer in the Blues-an
historic husband, whom she has recently immortalized, and without
whom she goes nowhere. The Kendals and the Bancrofts are at
the apex of the theatrical profession from a social point of
viewsons at Eton, houses in fashionable quarters, villas on the Thames,
shooting-boxes in Scotland, horses, carriages, visiting-lists, fine
friends, an endless round of entertainments-whatever, in fact,
lends distinction or respectability to life belongs to them.</p>
  <p>There are, I may venture to say, not a few houses in London
society into the ample bosom of which any one calling herself an
actress would be welcomed. Sometimes it happens that society is
agitated with misgivings as to the propriety of taking these ladies
of the stage to its heart. But the conscientious scruple only makes
itself felt to be effaced-appears, to disappear. The fair player, as
it discovers, is calumniated. She is confused with some one else,
oddly enough, of exactly the same name, who is or was not
everything which might be wished; or she has entirety broken with a
past which, if equivocal, was experienced under circumstances that
make her rather sinned against than sinning, rather a martyr than
a culprit. Other social critics there are who, if they are reproached
with lack of discrimination on this point, cynically ask what does
 <pb n="153" id="p.153">

it matter, and claim for the gentlemen and ladies who delight the
world behind the footlights an exemption from the prosaic
trammels of the moral law.</p>
  <p>The actress who ten or fifteen years ago was dancing a
breakdown on the burlesque stage finds herself seated to-day, between
the Premier and a prelate, at the dinner-table of a peer. The fine
ladies who affect to be the queens of London society may shrug
their shoulders, elevate their eyebrows, and say scornful things
about it, but the fact remains the same. The actress in society is
as powerful as the best substitute which London can offer for the
grande dame, and-which explains her popularity-she is infinitely
more amusing. That is the secret of the whole business. Just as
there are some gentlemen belonging to the theatrical profession
who, when they have played to the public, go into society to sing
songs at so much a piece, so actresses are taken into society, not
professionally, but upon an unreal footing of equality which makes
them the more diverting. They comport themselves with the mien
of women to whom imperial sway is a second nature. They are at
home immediately. I have never seen the young lady known as
Miss Fortescue on the stage, but I have had the honor to view her
at a discreet distance in drawing-rooms, and there could not be
more of self-consequence in her bearing if she were a duchess.</p>
  <p>Nor are the gentlemen of the stage more timid than the ladies.
The impression which they aim, quite unconsciously I really
believe, at producing, is that of being officers in crack regiments
who take, after the habit of military exquisites, an interest in the
drama. Some of them, when they are spoiled by great ladies and
made to feel almost too much at home in big houses, acquire a
habit of slanginess and familiarity which, however, to their real
admirers, seems only to add piquancy to their charm.</p>
  <p>The London theatrical hosts and hostesses are on the increase.
The most noticeable of the number are the Duke of Beaufort and
Lord and Lady Londesborough, the last being the daughter of the
first. Lord Londesborough is a typical specimen of the English
swell.  Tall, with tawny beard and mustache, at home in the
theatre or at theatrical suppers, in the hunting-field or on the box
of a four-in-hand, he is good-natured and heavy, with no definite
ideas, probably, on any subject which does not appertain to
pleasure or sport, and, as an hereditary legislator, animated by the
traditional hatred of the aristocratic Whig for the plebeian Radical.

<pb n="154" id="p.154">



 He is never more happy than when he is entertaining a
select party of histrionic artistes of both sexes at his country-seat
in Hampshire, or driving his drag, freighted with these same
ornaments of the drama, to Sandown or Epsom. He was once
mistaken by an American visitor for a popular comedian, which
he thought an excellent joke.</p>
  <p>Lord Dunraven is also a warm patron of the playhouse and of
players. This nobleman has crossed the Atlantic so frequently,
and sojourned on the other side of it so long, that he has contracted,
or affects to have contracted, something of the American accent
Seen anywhere, he would excite attention.  His face, with the
strongly defined eyebrows, the long, elaborately brushed and waxed
mustache, the dark complexion, and the slightly sinister, though
not unkind, expression, is suggestive alternately of a mediaeval
Mephistopheles and a modern conjurer. He has brains, knowledge,
and experience, is a good talker, and can write English which is
always grammatical and sometimes vigorous. He will long be
remembered as their benefactor by many bright particular stars of
the stage. He is not an ascetic, but he is too astute to be, or ever
to have been, a spendthrift libertine. Lord Rosebery and Lord Fife
can each of them pose as the Maecenas of the Thespian profession,
especially when the Prince of Wales graces the occasion by his
presence.</p>
 <p> The English drama has no warmer patron, and the English actor
or actress no more useful friend, than Mr. George Lewis, the
eminent lawyer. But his aegis covers a far wider area than that
of the stage. He is the oracle and adviser of London society.
There is scarcely any gentleman or lady whose name has been
mentioned in these pages, and who, if he or she were to become
involved in any grave trouble or compromising complication,
would not fly for aid and counsel to this most sagacious, acute,
and amiable of English solicitors. Small wonder, then, that he is
as much of an institution in London society as any of its most
conspicuous ornaments, or that his comfortable and artistically
arranged house is, under the presiding genius of his graceful and
accomplished wife, a social centre. Half the most delicate secrets
of the English aristocracy are locked up in the breast of Mr.
Lewis; and if you come to gentlemen in business, I verily believe
that he knows enough about them to send half the City of London
to penal servitude. He goes everywhere and hears everything.
 <pb n="155" id="p.155">

How could it be otherwise? There is no cause celebre in high life
every ramification of which is not in his hands.</p>
  <p>The actors and actresses reciprocate the hospitality of their hosts
in London society. Mr. Arthur Cecil entertains at little suppers,
when the play is over, many of the smart ladies of the fine world.
Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft give frequent dinners to their numerous
admirers at their residence in Berkeley Square. Mr. and Mrs.
Kendal are not less fond of seeing their friends in Harley Street.
Mr. Wilson Barrett is famous for suppers which are banquets,
and occasionally gives dinner-parties on Sundays.</p>
 <p> But the most prodigal and magnificent of theatrical hosts is Mr.
Henry Irving. Opinions differ as to the merits of this
gentleman's acting. Those who appreciate and condemn his art alike
recognize the stamp of high intelligence impressed upon it. His
mannerisms may be censured, but they are only the veil that never
quite conceals a quality closely akin to genius. Whatever
profession he might have adopted, he would have made his mark in
it. Much satire has been expended on his attitudes, many attacks
have been made on his pronunciation of the English language.
His best and conclusive answer to his critics on both these grounds
is that the public applauds him. He has won its ear, and can
always count upon his audience. He has, too, employed
successfully other expedients in conciliating the multitude. His profuse
expenditure has carried captive their imagination. His known
generosity and munificence have made him their idol. Whatever
he does is done on a great, even a grand, scale, and done without
ostentation, without violating any of the laws of good taste.
Whatever the entertainment he has devised for his friends is the
best of its kind.</p>
 <p> His figure is interesting, not, it is true, wanting in eccentricity,
but then not wanting in distinction either. His manner is
polished and gentle; his voice off the stage always agreeable, and his
smile peculiarly winning. He is also, like Mr. Wilson Barrett, a
shrewd and indefatigable man of business.  He would never
incur the remotest danger of dramatic failure by inattention to
any of those details which could promote success. The relations
he has established between himself and the Press, and every
interest or body of persons with whom he is brought into contact,
are equally calculated to help him at any critical juncture. In
general society he is reserved, and has been known to remind
<pb n="156" id="p.156">



some persons of the late Lord Beaconsfield. In the company of
his intimate friends his conversation is sometimes exceedingly
interesting, though the minuteness with which he dwells upon
comparatively trivial details is apt to be a trifle tedious. He is, I
should think, the only living actor who has been selected honoris
causa a member of the Athenaeum Club, and probably the only
actor on whom at any time a similar honor has been conferred
by the Committee of the Reform Club.</p>
<p>  There are half a dozen or a score of other gentlemen of the stage
frequently to be encountered in London society, such as Mr.
Conway, Mr. Brookfield, Mr. Hawtrey, and many more.   Most
of these are well favored to look upon, and much appreciated by
ladies who have been the architects of their social fortunes. Mr.
Hare, one of the most artistic players of character parts on the
English stage, is altogether upon a higher level, more exclusive in
his social tastes and engagements, as becomes one who has, by the
successful exercise of his art, achieved position and opulence.
He has all an Englishman's love of sport, is devoted to horses, and
can find enjoyment in games of chance. But, while cultivating
pleasure, he may be trusted to avoid rashness, and, speaking
generally, I am disposed to think that there is hardly any other
race of men so discreet and thrifty, so well acquainted with the
value of money, and so certain to secure a wise return for
everything they expend, as the prosperous and affluent English actor of
to-day.</p>
<p>  Mr. Toole does not belong to the set of players of the dandy
order, and he would, I suppose, excuse me for saying that,
whatever may have been the case once, there is little of the handsome
young ingenu left about him now. Yet he is a visitor at the
houses of the rich and great, regarded with a favorable eye, and
entertained, in common with Mr. Bancroft, Mr. Hare, Mr. Cecil,
and others of his calling, by the Prince of Wales. His life has
been that of a steady and honorable worker at his profession. He
has been the cause of much hearty and harmless laughter in public
and private to countless hundreds. Fortune has smiled upon him,
and it may be questioned whether there is in London any one who
enjoys existence more.</p>
<p>  Some years ago Mr. Gladstone introduced the innovation of
inviting the representatives of English pictorial art to the great
banquets of State. The practice was continued by Lord Beaconsfield.
      <pb n="157" id="p.157">

 Although artists of the stage have not, so far as I know,
yet received at the hands of English Premiers exactly the same
honor as the artists of the brush, Mr. Gladstone has been at special
pains to favor them with the marks of his attention. He is, as
Europe has been told more than once, a statesman of universal
sympathies. Years have passed since he made, at the house, I
think, of Mrs. Thistlethwayte, the acquaintance of a veteran
Royal Academician, Mr. Herbert. Since then his acquaintance
among painters and players has rapidly widened, and to-day, if
he were compelled to live in Bohemia, he would not need any
fresh introductions.</p>
<p>  But although Mr. Irving, Mr. Toole, and others are among the
guests at his Thursday breakfast-table, and put in an appearance
at Mrs. Gladstone's evening receptions, they have not, so far as I
know, up to the present time been summoned to take their place
at his banqueting-table among peers and knights of the Garter,
upon State occasions such as Her Majesty's birthday.</p>
  <p>The artist, however, is more fortunate, and Sir Frederick
Leighton is bidden to these feasts in his capacity of an official
personage of high degree. The Royal Academy of Arts, of which
he is president, is an institution of State, and, as in England
professions rise or fall in dignity and repute according as they are or
are not connected with the State, the Royal Academicians and
their chief have a social prestige in virtue of their official status in
which other intellectual and artistic workers do not participate.
At the Royal Academy dinner, held on the last Saturday of April,
the members of the Cabinet and the chief members of the
Government, as well as select representatives of the Bench and Bar, the
naval and military services, and other occupations, are entertained.
Moreover, the President of the Royal Academy is one of the
favored few who can obtain access to the Queen when he desires.
He is, therefore, not only an eminent painter, of course, but a
public individual of no common importance. These things have
conspired to raise the position of artists happening to be also
Royal Academicians in the estimate of the public, and, with all
charity be it said, in the estimate of themselves.</p>
 <p> Sir Frederick Leighton is, in something more than the merely
conventional sense, the pride and ornament of his profession. He
is not-how, indeed, could he be?-unconscious of the pomp and
circumstance with which he is furnished. As an artist pure and

<pb n="158" id="p.158">



simple he is a great draughtsman and a fantastic colorist. His
flesh-hues were never seen upon the inhabitant of any country or
climate, of any nationality at any period of the world's history, or
under the influence of any light whatever. As a visionary
glorification of the actual and the real they may be perfectly legitimate,
but there is nothing in them even remotely allied to reality.
That, however, is a detail, a matter which concerns Sir Frederick
Leighton and his imagination alone. It is necessary for the
President of the Royal Academy to be not only an artist but a courtier,
not only an authority in the studio but a personable figure in
society, a good public speaker, a man of urbane address and of
general information and culture.</p>
 <p> These last qualifications, so far as I have been able from
personal observation to ascertain, are not too common among
painters, who have that peculiar vice of the English specialist and
know exceedingly little about any subject to which they have not
devoted their lives.  Whether one takes city merchants and
speculators, or lawyers, or actors, makes no difference. In Paris
and in other European capitals the gentlemen of the Bourse are
politicians and diplomatists, just as the diplomatists and politicians
are gentlemen of the Bourse, while the doctors and the avocats are
desirous of repute as men of the world, and therefore necessarily
endowed with more or less miscellaneous knowledge.    But in
England the specialists (using this word in the broadest sense and
indicating by it those who are wrapped up in the concerns and
labors of a single profession) are perfectly satisfied to be in complete
ignorance of whatever lies outside the limits of their peculiar
sphere. So far from the British artist being an exception to this
rule, he is the most conclusive illustration of it. Once detach him
from his pigments and brushes, his experiences of foreign
galleries, and his sensibility to his rival's shortcomings, and he has
nothing to say. He must talk about his art and himself, or he will
talk about nothing.</p>
<p>  Sir Frederick Leighton, indeed, will discuss his art from every
conceivable aspect by the hour, and is not invincibly silent upon
the subject of himself.  But then he is, besides, a scholar, a
speaker, a linguist, a man of business, of the world, and of
appreciation of and acquaintance with everything which ministers to
the embellishment or the grace of existence. He would have been
distinguished in any career. His more enthusiastic admirers have
 <pb n="159" id="p.159">

discovered in him a strong personal resemblance to Apollo, as that
classic divinity unveils himself to their imagination, and it is not
difficult, as one looks at his elegant presence, to detect in it
something which is suggestive of a Greek god in a frock-coat. His are
the hyacinthine locks, thinned indeed by years, but still with
something celestial in their flow; his that glossy hue which, as
seen on his mustache or beard, may come from the liquid dew of
Castaly or Roland's Macassar oil. His voice is lutelike, and his
language a mosaic of sentiments not so much rare in themselves,
as set in phrases which are miracles of the aesthetic imagination,
and which can only be interpreted by the vulgar as enshrining
thoughts too exquisitely precious. It is not English, nor French,
nor Italian, nor Spanish, nor Greek which this accomplished
rhetorician pours forth in easy flow. It is rather Ambrosia in
syllables; it is Leightonese.</p>
<p>  Contrast with this finished specimen of the refinement of English
art embodied in the human form, the painter who is probably
popular and prosperous before any of his contemporaries, Mr. John
Everett Millais. It is, I believe, reported that Mr. Millais, had
he cared to press his claims, might have secured his
election over Sir Frederick Leighton to the presidential chair of
the Royal Academy. But, as he might himself say, "it was not
in his line."  Everything  he could wish he had    obtained
already-fame, fortune, friends. Millais is an undeniably
handsome man, a well-knit giant of six foot one, with a ruddy, open
countenance, frank, hearty, a ringing voice and a pealing laugh.
Like Leighton he loves beauty and comfort, but unlike
Leighton he has a native taste for simplicity; he is, although by birth
a native of Jersey, a thorough Englishman, ready to back his
race, his country, and everything characteristic of them against
the rest of the world. Imagine John Bull a painter, and you have
Jack Millais. No more cheery optimist, or one who shows more
conclusively the difference between honest pride in himself, his
possessions  and his works, and vanity or conceit, than Mr.
Millais ever lived. Most thoroughly has he apprehended the genius
of the English people. Most happily does he reflect it on his
canvases, whether they are covered with landscape or portrait.</p>
<p>  I never meet this superb type of artistic manhood, with his
breezy, boisterous manner, without experiencing a sense of
physical refreshment. It is as if there was wafted to me in Pall Mall a

<pb n="160" id="p.160">



current of air from those Scotch Highlands which he loves and
paints so well, fragrant with the heather and the fir-cones. Mr.
Millais is a keen sportsman, and one of the reasons why he toils so
incessantly during seven or eight months of every year is that he
may spend the remaining four or five in quest of grouse and
salmon. He has a moor and a river on the other side of the Tweed,
and these of course are like everything else which belongs to him,
the best in the world. Honestly is lie persuaded, and without the
slightest trace of offensive conceit will he assure you, that there is no
family so richly endowed with the gift of personal beauty as his
own, and that there is no such house as that which he has built for
himself. Ask him whether of the two painters he considers Millais
or Gainsborough the greater, and he would, I am convinced, if he
felt it permissible to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, say Millais. A chief among artists, this, and a prince
among good fellows.</p>
 <p> Sir Frederick Leighton's most confidential adviser and friend
among men is Mr. Val Prinsep-universally popular, of
inexhaustible kindness, and welcome in any society. A finished and most
courteous gentleman, notwithstanding an almost uncouth
appearance and, so far as his face is concerned, a pervading air of
shagginess. <persName key="Mr. Marcus Stone">Mr. Marcus Stone</persName> is, in each of these respects, <persName key="Mr.
Prinsep's">Mr.
Prinsep's</persName> opposite-sleek, smooth-mannered, habited with extreme
care, wonderfully well-looking, and with no more of the artist in
his appearance than is indicated by a certain picturesqueness in his
tout-ensemble. <persName key="Mr. Holman Hunt">Mr. Holman Hunt</persName> and <persName key="Mr. Burne-Jones">Mr. Burne-Jones</persName> differ from
painters of the stamp of <persName key="Mr. Stone">Mr. Stone</persName> as much as Mr. Stone himself
differs from Mr. Prinsep. These are not merely wielders of the
brush; they are also priests of mighty mysteries. Painters by
profession, they are teachers and preachers too. Art is with them a
gospel which it is given only to a select minority of initiated
votaries to understand aright.  There is a subtle symbolism in
every picture which Mr. Jones submits to the public. He is taken
by his admirers, as indeed is usually the case, at his own estimate
of himself. He is never to be met with in any ordinary circle of
London society. He deigns only to reveal himself in the drawing
rooms of a favored few, and then he expects and receives the
worship due to a deity.</p>
<p>  In this he and others like him merely illustrate the besetting
tendency of the brethren of the brush in England. They believe overmuch

 <pb n="161" id="p.161">

 in their own infallibility. They are jealous of contradiction,
contemptuous of any outside criticism. For these reasons they are
often not especially eligible as companions. To judge of art, they
hold, one must begin by being an artist, and if that condition is
not forth-coming, any opinion expressed must, they seem to think,
be an impertinence. If they are members, actual or potential, of
the Royal Academy, they constitute an aggressive guild, always
ready, with or without provocation, to assume an offensive attitude
towards the world. If they are at feud with the Academy, and
affect to despise its distinctions and its diplomas, the area of their
supercilious spleen is only enlarged, and they pose as the men of
genius whom their own generation does not understand, but for
whom an immortality of glory is hereafter reserved. To that
belief there are always some ladies in London society who are swift
to minister.</p>
<p>  There is one artist whose name may be mentioned as furnishing
a crucial instance of the service which social and, above all,
feminine assistance may render in the establishment of a professional
reputation. Mr. Whistler is, for all I know to the contrary, an
artist who has the suffrages of his brother artists, a great painter in
the judgment of those who live by painting, but if he had not
followed the example of <persName key="Mr. Oscar Wilde">Mr. Oscar Wilde</persName> his name would be
comparatively unknown. He had the wit to see that genius must in
these days wear the crown of eccentricity, even as it is the fool's
cap which frequently conceals the fool, or rather invests him with
the mantle of the wise man. The opportunity came, and he took
advantage of it. He developed a little group of characteristics
which pleased the fancy and impressed themselves on the memory
of society. First he cultivated a lock of hair sprouting from
amidst his tresses and fashioned after the model of a feather. Next
he substituted for a walking-stick a staff. Having thus appealed
to the vision, he proceeded to appeal to society's sense of hearing,
and, exaggerating his American twang, invented a species of
Yankee dialect hitherto unknown. In this he made it his business to
utter grotesque antithetical incoherences, and to ramble on in a
maundering monotone from theme to theme. Some clever things
he contrived to say, for he is undoubtedly an exceedingly clever
man. Concurrently with this he imported a novel mode of
painting.</p>
 <p> The critics were divided in their opinion.  Some said it was

<pb n="162" id="p.162">



genius, others said it was a daub. Society, being already
prejudiced in favor of the man, now welcomed the artist, and saw in
everything which came at long intervals from his studio the
transcendent gifts of a great original. " Our James" became the rage,
because, in fact, society's own James. From the artist he rose to
the oracle. Having induced many gay and lively persons in
London society to believe that he was the sole painter of the period
who had the slightest notion of the rudiments of art, it occurred to
him that he might as well explain from a public platform what
these were. So he hired a room in Piccadilly, and announced a
discourse to be delivered at the unusual hour of ten o'clock. The bait
took. It was whispered about in society that it would be the right
thing to hear "our James." He must be so entertaining.</p>
 <p> When the eventful evening arrived there was not a seat to be
had for love or money. All the smart people were there. Some of
them could not hear, others could not understand. Some
appreciated, others were simply perplexed, but they all resolved to say
that it was exceeding clever, and so, whether he did or did not
laugh at them in his sleeve, our James had his victory. If society
had been ill-natured it might, I am disposed to think, have resented
the whole business as an imposture, have exclaimed indignantly
that it had been the victim of a practical joke, and have demanded
that its money should be returned to it at the doors.</p>
 <p> Nothing is more noticeable than the intense respectability of the
artistic society of London. In France and in other countries the
artist is a Bohemian. In London he is the pink of fashion and the
flower of propriety. The curious thing is, that when a man or a
woman distinguished in art or literature perpetrates any
eccentricity, society insists upon investing it with an air of sanctity. For
instance, the English public has just been reading with delight the
autobiography of an illustrious female novelist, who lived, during
the greater part of her existence, with a man who was not her
husband, edited by a man who was. Characteristically it has seen
nothing at all odd in this. The lady had a great genius, and,
therefore, what in others less gifted might have been vice was in her
case a form of virtue.</p>
 <p> It never entered into its head to do any one of these things. I
have often heard society in London compared to that society in
Athens addressed by the apostle Paul, whose whole life was
devoted to the seeing or hearing of some new thing. But if London
      <pb n="163" id="p.163">

society is greedy of novelty, it cannot be charged with the sin of
inconstancy or caprice. It is, as I have endeavored in these pages
to show, credulous and simple in some respects even to a fault. It
is also loyal to those whom it has once taken into its service, and
who do not put off their cap and bells in its employ. It may not
be profound, witty, or wise. But it errs, when it does err, on the
side of charity. It will not tolerate idols placed up for its
adoration by some external power, but when those idols are set up by
itself it does not lightly dethrone them. If the worshippers are
mechanically gregarious, they are animated by an esprit de corps
which insures their mutual allegiance. I have made no attempt
here to conceal or gloss over the faults of London society, but,
after these have been duly allowed for, London society will remain
the most catholic, comprehensive, tolerant, amusing, the most vast
and varied in the world.</p>
 <p> One word in conclusion. Those of my readers who are not
Englishmen may be surprised that in this account of Society in
London I have said nothing of the duel as an institution, or of
affairs of honor. The explanation is that such things are in
England practically unknown. Twice within my recollection have
two gentlemen, both of them officers in the army, thought it
necessary to send challenges to friends who had been too attentive to
their wives. In each case a personal encounter followed, but no
mischief was done, and the general impression of society at the
time was that the belligerents had rendered themselves slightly
ridiculous. Public opinion in London is indeed undoubtedly hos
tile to the duel. The late Prince Consort, who, more than any man
of his time, moulded the taste and temper of the English people,
strenuously discouraged it; and though the Prince of Wales is
reported to have advocated it in a particular instance, and to be
generally not unfriendly to the principle of the duel, I see no signs
of a disposition to adopt it. This is to a large extent because there
exist in London society social tribunals before which there can be
tried questions that in France we settle in the Bois de Boulogne,
Club committees are in effect courts of honor, and the organized
public opinion of London society can visit any grave offence
against it with penalties as severe as the bullet of a pistol or the
thrust of a rapier. In France men keep their quarrels and scandals
to themselves. They are purely personal topics, matters in which
they, and they alone, are interested. In England, society being,

<pb n="164" id="p.164">

as I said at the commencement of this little work, more compactly
and elaborately organized than in any other country in the world,
makes such incidents its common concern.</p>
<p>  With these observations, I bid my readers, French or English or
of whatever nationality they may be, farewell. They will find, I
believe, in these pages some truth and no ill-nature. I am not, at
least, conscious of having written anything which is either
impertinent or spiteful. I have raked up the ashes of no scandals. I have
not divulged a single secret, or lifted the curtain of any interior
which ought not to be revealed, or profaned the sacred mysteries
of domestic hospitality. The only sins with which I can be
reproached are errors or inelegancies in literary expression.  For
these I may be pardoned, as one who, though he is now fairly
habituated to the English tongue, is painfully alive to the fact that
he has still to master many of its idioms and idiosyncrasies.</p></div1>

 <p> There is no page of the book that is not weighty with meaning.
The argument that runs through it is like a chain, strongly
welded, link on to link. * * * Prof. Sumner gives clear, pointed, and
powerful utterance to much social and political wisdom.  The
teaching of the book is just of that sort which is most needed by
the young America of to-day.-Boston Commonwealth.</p>
<p>  The conclusions he reaches are substantially unanswerable. * * *
No more important doctrine than this can well be proclaimed, and
our country owes a debt of gratitude to whoever will proclaim
it in the sturdy style of this book. We need not despair of the
Republic while our young men are fed upon such meat as this.
Whether they adopt his conclusions or not, they cannot fail to be
stimulated by his reasoning.-The Nation, N.Y.</p>
<p>  Prof. Sumner has selected a subject of great interest and
importance, and has treated it with ingenuity, penetration, and
originality, and in a plain, homely, pungent, and effective style.-Brooklyn
Union.</p>
<p>  His little book is full of excellent maxims of conduct formed on
the manly principle of doing hard work and letting everybody
have a fair chance. * * * These eleven short chapters are
undoubtedly the ablest of recent contributions to matters on which much
unprofitable ink is spent.--N.Y. Times.</p>
<p>  This volume contains a most instructive discussion of certain
economic questions which are of living interest touching upon the
duties of the State to classes or individuals embraced in it.-Boston
Globe.</p>
<p>  The style is bright and racy, and the argument is allowed to lose
none of its force by the use of technical terms. The book is
suggestive, and will be found helpful to those who desire to reach
correct conclusions on subjects of practical importance.-Christian at
Work, N. Y.</p>
  <p>Prof. Sumner has enforced in very few and very simple words
some of the most important and most neglected principles of

Or, Life in Dakota with General Custer. By Mrs. ELIZABETH B. CUSTER.       With Portrait of General Custer.
    pp. 312.    12mo, Cloth, $1 50.</p>
 <p> A book of adventure is interesting reading, especially when it is all true,
as is the case with "Boots and Saddles." * * * She does not obtrude the
fact that sunshine and solace went with her to tent and fort, but it
inheres in her narrative none the less, and as a consequence "these simple
annals of our daily life," as she calls them, are never dull nor
uninteresting.-Evangelist, N. Y.</p>
 <p> Mrs. Custer's book is in reality a bright and sunny sketch of the life
of her late husband, who fell at the battle of " Little Big Horn." * * *
After the war, when General Custer was sent to the Indian frontier, his
wife was of the party, and she is able to give the minute story of her
husband's varied career, since she was almost always near the scene of
his adventures.-Brooklyn Union.</p>
  <p>We have no hesitation in saying that no better or more satisfactory life
of General Custer could have been written.  Indeed, we may as well
speak the thought that is in us, and say plainly that we know of no
biographical work anywhere which we count better than this. * * * Surely the
record of such experiences as these will be read with that keen interest
which attaches only to strenuous human doings; as surely we are right
in saying that such a story of truth and heroism as that here told will
take a deeper hold upon the popular mind and heart than any work of
fiction can. For the rest, the narrative is as vivacious and as lightly and
trippingly given as that of any novel. It is enriched in every chapter with
illustrative anecdotes and incidents, and here and there a little life story
of pathetic interest is told as an episode.-N. Y. Commercial Advertiser.
  <p>It is a plain, straightforward story of the author's life on the plains of
Dakota.  Every member of a Western garrison will want to read this
book; every person in the East who is interested in Western life will
want to read it, too; and every girl or boy who has a healthy appetite
for adventure will be sure to get it. It is bound to have an army of
readers that few authors can expect.-Philadelphia Press.</p>
  <p>These annals of daily life in the army are simple, yet interesting, and
underneath all is discerned the love of a true woman ready for any
sacrifice. She touches on themes little canvassed by the civilian, and makes a
volume equally redolent of a loving devotion to an honored husband, and
attractive as a picture of necessary duty by the soldier.-Commonwealth,
Boston.</p>

      HOME STUDIES IN NATURE.
BY MARY TREAT, Author of "Chapters on Ants," &amp;c.
Illustrated.  pp. 244.    12mo, Ornamental Cloth, $1 50.</p>
  <p>Mrs. Treat roams through the fields in search of rare knowledge about
birds, wasps, spiders, and those wonderful plants that entrap insects and
thrive on their juices. Her originality in these researches is undoubted,
and she adds a great deal to our stock of facts for use in the
interpretation of nature. She has a pleasant style, and a winning knack of making
disagreeable things seem otherwise. The pictures are many and good.-
N.Y. Journal of Commerce.</p>
  <p>A worthy tribute from a lover of nature to the animated world about
her. It treats of birds, insects, plants that consume animals, and flowering
plants. It has nearly seventy handsome illustrations, and the story is told
in fascinating and clearly-expressed language. It is an admirable work
with which to educate a family.-Boston Commonwealth.</p>
  <p>To those who have given attention to the beauties of nature as
developed in the winged world and the insect and floral branches, this little
volume will be peculiarly grateful.-Albany Press.</p>
  <p>Books on this subject are generally regarded by every one not
professional scientists as dreadful bores. An exception must be made, however,
in favor of Mrs. Mary Treat's "Home Studies in Nature."   The only
echoes of science between the two covers are the Latin names of birds,
insects, and plants; all else are most curious and readable accounts of
the doings of some creatures so tiny that they frequently are near us, and
watching us, when we imagine ourselves alone. * * * This would be a
capital book to give a bright-eyed boy or girl who complains that about home
"there is nothing to look at."  Adults, however will also enjoy the volume,
and may make their eyesight keener by reading it.-N. Y. Herald.</p>
  <p>The public should feel glad that occasionally a man or a woman finds
highest pleasure in studying the ways and habits of nature, and publishing
the result of such study to the world. This is what Mrs. Treat has done.
* * * Her book is divided into four parts-observations on birds, habits of
insects, plants that consume animals, and flowering plants. It is, moreover,
helped by nearly seventy illustrations, which in a work of this character
are of material assistance; for the great majority of readers are
unfamiliar with the appearance of the birds, flowers, and insects, the habits of
which are described. The author shows herself to be a keen,
conscientious, and affectionate observer.--N. Y. Telegram.</p>
 <p> Mrs. Treat can always command a delightful audience; for next to the
pleasure of searching fields, woods, and streams for the beautiful or
curious, it is charming to hear from so close an observer so much that is
interesting and new, especially when all is told with vivacity and genuine
enthusiasm. * * * The volume is finely illustrated, and its contents cannot
fail to entertain the reader, young or old, who has learned, or is learning,
about the busy world out-of-doors.--Worcester Daily Spy.</p>

    FLY-RODS AND FLY-TACKLE.

Suggestions as to their Manufacture and Use.        By HENRY
   P. WELLS. Illustrated. pp. 364. Post 8vo,
Illuminated Cloth, $2 50.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wells has devoted more time and attention to the materials used in
fly-fishing than any person we know of, and his experience is well set forth
in this most valuable book. * * * The author is an amateur rod-maker who
has experimented with every wood known to rod manufacturers, as well as
with some that are not known to them, and therefore he is an undoubted
authority on the subject. This chapter and the one following, which gives
directions in rod-making, forms the most perfect treatise on rods extant.
* *  The book is one of great value, and will take its place as a standard
authority on all points of which it treats, and we cannot commend it too
highly.-Forest and Stream, N. Y.</p>
  <p>Since Izaak Walton lingered over themes piscatorial, we have learned to
expect, in all essays on the gentle art of angling, a certain daintiness and
elegance of literary form as well as technical utility. Publisher and author
have co-operated to meet these traditional requirements in "Fly-Rods and
Fly-Tackle." * * * Mr. Wells's competence to expound the somewhat
intricate principles and delicate processes of fly-fishing will be plain to any
reader who himself has some practical acquaintance with the art discussed.
The value of the author's instructions and suggestions is signally enhanced
by their minuteness and lucidity.-N.Y. Sun.</p>
 <p> A complete manual for the ambitious lover of fishing for trout. *** All
lovers of fly-fishing should have Mr. Wells's book in their outfit for the
sport that is near at hand.-Philadelphia Bulletin.</p>
 <p> Mr. Wells reveals to us the mysteries of lines, leaders, and reels, rods,
rod material, and rod-making. He lets us into the secret of making
repairs, and gives all due directions for casting the fly. * * Moreover, Mr.
Wells writes in an attractive style. There is a certain charm in the
heartiness and grace wherewith he expresses his appreciation of those beauties
of nature which the angler has so unlimited an opportunity of enjoying.
Thus what may be called not only a technical, but also a scientific,
knowledge of his subject is combined with a keen delight in hill, stream, and
forest for the sake of the varied loveliness they display.-N.Y. Telegram.</p>
  <p>A book of practical hints about the manufacture and use of anglers'
gear. Fish-hooks, lines, leaders, rods and rod-making, repairs, flies and
fly-fishing, are among the important subjects discussed with great fulness.
The essay on "Casting the Fly" and "Miscellaneous Suggestions" are
rich in points for beginners. It is to the latter, and not to the experts,
that Mr. Wells modestly dedicates his work. His object is to supply
precisely the kind of information of which he stood so much in need during
his own novitiate.-N. Y. Journal of Commerce.</p>
