<head>Degeneration
Amongst Londoners.</head>
<div2 type=section n=1>
<head>[Part I]</head>
<p>To all who live in London the
title of this lecture is calculated
to excite surprise and suspicion:
surprise, that in this, the most
healthy of all large towns, as
judged from the death-rate returns,
there should be even a question of
gradual degeneration;  suspicion,
lest false grounds, mistaken premises, and too narrow observations
have landed me in an erroneous
belief.
<p>An apology seems at first sight
<pb n=8>
necessary, but I will reserve giving
it until the end of the lecture,
when, if it is proved I am in error,
I shall be ready to grant one.
<div3 type=subsection>
<head>I.The first knotty point to be
settled is-What is, or where is
London from a hygienic standpoint?</head>
<p>It is not limited by bars or gates,
nor by high walls or entrenchments, <emph>but by the distance any
given point of it is removed from
the nearest point where really fresh
air is to be obtained</emph>. In this street,
for instance, it is many a decade
since really fresh country air has
been wafted along its length by
even a gale of wind.
<p>The next thing to occur to one
<pb n=9>
is, <emph>What is fresh air, or what is
there in fresh air</emph> to make so great
a difference between the air we
obtain in town and that which
circulates in the country ?
Most agree that it is <emph>ozone</emph>, a
gas, a modification of oxygen, to
which unsearchable vital powers
are ascribed: it is found in the
open country, at sea-in fact everywhere, where there is not too
great an aggregation of human
beings to abstract or decompose it.
This gas gives the peculiar
odour present in the neighbourhood of an electric machine; it is
present in the air in quantity
during a thunderstorm and a fall
of snow: it is borne in greater
<pb n=10>
quantity on the south-west wind
than on any other, probably because
that comes, in this country, from
off the sea, and the sea seems to be
its haven or birthplace, for it is
greater in quantity there than
elsewhere. If ozone is the health-giving spark, certain it is, none of
it is to be found in London. The
air has been tested over and over
again for this gas, and I had it
examined on <dateStruct value="1885-01-18"><month reg=01>January</month><day reg=18> 18th</day>, <year reg="1885">1885</year></dateStruct>,
once more. The day was very dull,
the wind N.E., and blowing at
the rate of only about one and a half
miles an hour. The various places
from whence I obtained information on that day were:    near
Brownswood Park, in the N.E. of
<pb n=11>
London; near Maida Vale, in the
N.W.; at Wandsworth, at Barnes,
at Chiswick, and in Bushy Park,
in the S.W.; and in Hyde Park.
With the exception of a faint, very
faint indication of ozone in the
N.E. there was no evidence of
ozone being present anywhere else.
It was from  the N.E. quarter
the wind was blowing, hence at
Bushy Park the air had travelled
all over London, and consequently
had little likelihood of containing
ozone after that. Practically there
was no ozone beyond a small
semicircle of the N.E. quarter.
<p>But supposing a gale had been
blowing, and it had been summertime when the air had been tested,
<pb n=12>
it is unlikely that ozone or fresh
air would have travelled further
than one mile nearer the centre of
London, or, say, as far as the Angel
at Islington. So it is with other
districts when the wind blows from
different quarters: if from the south,
it has to pass over Croydon, and
but little ozone then finds its way to
London.   From whatever quarter
the air is blowing, the outer circlet
of, say, half-a mile of human beings,
absorbs the fresh air, and not only
so, but adds various pollutions to it,
so that the air breathed within a
given area, centred around, for instance Charing Cross, or the Bank,
has not had fresh air supplied to it
for, say, 50 or 100 years.
<pb n=13>
<p>Hence we might define London
as a district where there is no ozone.
<div3 type=subsection>
<head>II. Did you ever get sunburnt
in London?</head>
<p>I shall answer the
question for you, and say NO. The
natural appearance of the face in
London is pale; when it is otherwise it is red; not brown or tanned,
but red.  An omnibus-driver does
not get brown, he gets red ; and you
can see the cause of the redness to
be dilated vessels in the skin of
his face.
<p>Why does one not get sunburnt
in London? Is it absence of light,
or is it the absence of fresh air-the ozone we have been speaking of?
<p>Light, as we know, develops pigment;
<pb n=14>
and it will do so in human
beings under certain conditions.
When, however, one is sickening for
an illness-say typhoid fever-it is
impossible to get sunburnt for some
weeks previously even at the sea-side.
There are varieties of consumptive
people who never get sunburnt in
the country or at sea. It is only at
a certain turning-point in convalescence that a person can get sunburnt.
Beneath a quarter-deck in the
tropics, where it is supposed the
reflection from the sea is the cause
of the sunburning (just as if the
reflection of a mirror could sunburn), you can tell the healthy
traveller from the blanched and
pale invalid returning home suffering
<pb n=15>
from Asiatic diarrhoea or dysentery
by the effect which the sun has
upon them.
<p>A convalescent on board ship,
who is kept in his cabin with only
the stream of light (and it may be
from the shaded side) which enters
through the window, gets sunburnt.
Hence, it is not altogether light;
there must be something else
present in the air: and to avoid
creating a new entity, we shall
term it ozone still, and believe
that ozone must be present in the
air before healthy people can be
sunburnt, but that no amount of
exposure to even ozonised air will
"tan" a person suffering from the
conditions mentioned above. Hence
<pb n=16>
I would limit <emph>London to the region
where sunburning is unknown</emph>.
<div3 type=subsection n=3>
<head>III.  Thirdly, I would define
London to be a region where at
any time beneficial exercise is impossible.</head>
<p>No exercise can be
beneficial in "the highest sense"
which is undertaken in polluted air.
With increased exertion, increased
respiratory processes are necessary,
and greater chemical changes are
requisite, necessitating for their
hygienic  completion  a  greater
supply of fresh air.  But as this
is absent in the air of London,
exercise taken in London cannot
do that amount of good it does
were it taken in fresh air. Far be
<pb n=17>
it from me to condemn exercise in
London, and to say, Never walk
when you can ride. I would say
rather, Walk whenever you can;
mount a horse if you have one, and
take what air and exercise you can
get even in the area mentioned.
The evils which accrue from want
of exercise, greatly outbalance the
total want of exercise in an atmosphere that may not be <emph>quite</emph> fresh.
Still, there is no doubt that were a
gymnast (<foreign lang=la>i.e.</foreign>, a man requiring an increased amount of air) trained in such
an atmosphere as that of the underground railway, he would die sooner,
than, if living in such an atmosphere
he moved about in an ordinary
way. Hence I land myself in a
<pb n=18>
dilemma: am I to condemn exercise
in London because it is bad, or am
I to say the good gained from
exercise, say walking, outbalances
the evils of sedentary life ? Whichever way we settle it, it practically
settles itself. Few people walk far in
towns; few of you walked here to
this lecture. Why do not people
walk in town as in the country?
Because they get so quickly tired;
there is no freshness in the air, even
in the parks, and what is theoretically wrong is practically borne out,
viz., that people in London walk
as little as possible simply because
they do not feel inclined to; but
if they did walk more, the good that
would come of it would be doubtful.
<pb n=19>
<p>Hence, then, I will return to my
enunciation, viz., that no exercise
can be beneficial in the highest
sense which is undertaken in
polluted air.
<div2 type=section n=2>
<head>[Part II]</head>
<p>In the next place I have to <emph>define</emph> a Londoner. A Londoner is
one whose <emph>parents</emph> were born,
brought up, and lived in the area
defined, and who himself, or herself,
was born, brought up, and lived in
London, and whose only notion
of the country or the sea-side is
an occasional run on a Bank Holiday.
<p>Some four years ago, when my
attention was first drawn to this
subject, I started with the premises
that a Londoner was one whose
<pb n=20>
<emph>grand-parents</emph>, and not the parents
only, came under the category;
but I had to stop, as I could find
no such specimens.
<p>As you may imagine, it has taken
much questioning and investigation
to obtain substantive evidence on
such a subject.
<p>The nearest approach beyond
what I have given as a definition,
are specimens of generations whose
grandfather or grandmother came
from the country. I have two men
under my observation just now,
one whose grandfather came from
the country, Somersetshire; the
other whose   grandmother was
Irish.
<p>First, I shall describe to you
<pb n=21>
the man with the Somersetshire
grandfather, but whose folks had
lived in London, commencing from
the grand-parents. Height 5 feet 1
inch; age 21 ; chest measurement
28 inches.   His head measure
around above the eyebrows is 19
inches (nearly 3 inches below the
average); measured across from tip
of ear to tip of ear, 11 inches (1 1/2
below the average).  His aspect
is pale waxy; he is very narrow
between the eyes, and with a decided squint. Solemnity intense.
<p>I shall now describe the man
with the Irish grandmother, but
the others of whose predecessors
have lived rigidly in London from
the   grand-parents  downwards.
<pb n=22>
Height 5 feet 3 inches. Age 19.
Chest measurement 29 inches.
His head measures 20 inches round
(2 inches below the average).
His face is mottled, pale, and
pimpled. He squints rather badly.
His jaws are misshapen; he cannot
bring his front teeth within half an
inch of each other; his upper jaw
is pointed, and falls within the
arch of the lower; his teeth spiculated, and must be well nigh useless
to him. Solemnity great.
<p>Again, I might describe girls of
similar pedigree. Here is one:-
height 4 feet 10 inches. Age 18.
Misshapen jaw, almost the same as
above described. Enlarged scrofulous glands all around lower jaw,
<pb n=23>
a red scrofulous aspect; slight
tendency to  squint.  Solemnity
marked.
<p>These are specimens I have come
across, as I say, after much inquiry.
I have never come across the children of any such, and I believe it is
not likely I ever shall. Nature steps
in and denies the continuance of
such; and weakness of brain-power
gives such a being but little chance
in this struggling world.
<p>Now, I know it will be said, Why
take London, why abuse its surroundings? There are many other
towns whose citizens are placed
under worse conditions; such as
Sheffield,  Bradford,  Liverpool,
Manchester, Glasgow, and, in fact
<pb n=24>
many towns where numerous manufactories pour their smoke and
chemical poisons into the air. Now,
that is just the very reason why I have
not chosen these, but prefer to study
the Londoner and London, where
manufactories do not poison the air
but to an infinitesimal extent compared with many other towns. What
I want to prove, if possible, is
that a mere collection of human
beings is enough, without manufactories' smoke, to render the air in
such a condition that the families
living in such an atmosphere dwindle
and disappear from inability of continuance.  I want to find out if
there is such a thing as "<emph>urbomorbus</emph>" or "city disease," independently
<pb n=25>
of trade disease; hence I
chose to study London. Every one
in their inner conscience knows and
believes that town air is bad, that
every one working in it must suffer
after a time in health and stamina;
and that person must be blind
indeed, who does not observe the
effect on children born and brought
up in towns, even if they belong to
the upper or middle classes.
<div2 type=section n=3>
<head>[Part III]</head>
<p>Now, in the absence of the smoke
of manufactories, what is it in towns
which causes this deterioration ? <emph>It
is the presence of non-ozonised air
air that has been pre-breathed, and
the consequent bad effects of taking
exercise therein</emph>.
<p>First, then, as to the physical
<pb n=26>
effects of want of beneficial exercise. In the earliest times of the
human race, when man's only duty
was to till the ground or follow
the chase, it was unnecessary to
prompt people to take exercise farther than what was required in the
execution of their labours. Now-
a-days, however, the multiplication
of industries is such, that but few
obtain exercise <emph>at</emph> their employment;
and consequently, if they are to have
exercise at all, it must be something
<emph>added on to</emph> and independent of
their daily employment. Such a departure from an open air or natural
employment, to one with unnatural
or cooped-up surroundings whilst at
labour, may be proof of advance of
<pb n=27>
man's intellect, but in its effect there
must be a physical retrocession, <emph>or
artificial means</emph> must be taken to
maintain that physique.
<p>This state of things obtains not
only in towns, but also in villages
and country places. This "nation
of shop-keepers"  is  becoming
more and more "townified." The
farm-labouring class is the only
large  class  of all the   community which has preserved to it
man's natural calling. For has not
the shop-keeper, the shoe-maker,
the weaver, and the butcher as close
employment in even a country
village as in a large town? Thus
have all classes, except the farm-
labourer, undertaken work which is
<pb n=28>
without a sufficiency of exercise;
and unless care is taken to provide
for such, there will, in time, be
developed a puny race unfit to
maintain themselves.  If such is
the case in villages, how much more
is it the case in large towns and
cities, where the city shop-keeper
has not the advantage of fresh air
entering his abode, and who, tied
up all the hours of sunlight, can
only take exercise after dark and
in a polluted atmosphere.
<p>Before proceeding  further,  I
should like to state once for all, that
in the present decade we have individuals amongst us who are capable
of feats of strength such as were
never dreamt of in former days.
<pb n=29>
<p>When Captain Webb swam the
Channel in <dateStruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></dateStruct>, it was a feat
unparalleled in strength and endurance. Until the year <dateStruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">1877</year></dateStruct>, no
human being had been known to
leap from the ground six feet two
inches, as happened at the Oxford
and Cambridge sports that year.
The feats of walking performed
now-500 miles in a week, and so
on-are prodigies of strength such
as we never read of in former days.
Four minutes is almost the time a
mile can be run in now-a-days.
<p>I could bring forward many
other instances to show, that,
there are individuals of the present
generation who are superior in the
performance of feats of strength
<pb n=30>
and endurance to any of our predecessors. But what is being done
to maintain this state of things ?
Are we not at the end of the
generation who lived before railways, and therefore before steam,
manufactories, large cities, and all
the modern developments which
have made our air more impure,
our <emph>necessity for walking</emph> less-
almost a waste of time, our citizens
to be attendants rather than workers
at big machines ? It is coming to
pass that we shall forget that our
hands are organs whereby to feed
ourselves with, and that our lower
extremities are meant to carry us
about to get our requirements. In
place of our hands and arms we
<pb n=31>
use machines now-a-days; and in
place of our legs we have railways,
omnibuses, cabs, etc., to supplant
the necessity for their use.
<p>Are there any signs of such
retrocession abroad ? What about
the  rowing  championship ?  It
was competed for last on an
Australian river, and the competitors were the progeny of previous
British generations, a Canadian and
anAustralian, men whose fathers had
gone forth from out of this nation
of cities and polluted air, and found
vigour and strength in the Canadian
forest or Australian bush. Depend
upon it we are at a turning-point
in our national health; our soldiers
are as brave, as stout-hearted,
<pb n=32>
steady and calm under difficulties
as ever; and shall we even say that
the events of the last few days have
proved them even better than any
who have preceded them ? Allowing all that, let not the people of
this country be blinded to the fact
of the effect of living in large
towns, of this incessant travelling
in carriages of all sorts. Muscle
now-a-days is at a discount; brain
power is what is sought for, and
there is no doubt it is forthcoming:
but as it requires a healthy heart to
give forth a normal sound, so it
requires a healthy brain to beget
wise thoughts.
<div2 type=section n=4>
<head>[Part IV]</head>
<p>It is sad to contemplate
that now-a-days honest labour
<pb n=33>
brings with it of necessity illness
and misery, instead of health and
comfort-that the close confinement and the foul air of our cities
are shortening the life of the individual, and raising up a puny and
ill-developed race. But certain it is,
and every one knows on the face of
it that it is true; and if you will bear
with me whilst I run through some
of the effects of city life and want
of beneficial exercise, I will promise
to be short.
<p>First, let us look at the surroundings of the child. In this
moist climate of ours, and with
the murky atmosphere of coal
smoke which obscures the sunlight,
where, in addition, thousands of
<pb n=34>
tall chimneys vomit forth their
impurities, how can it be otherwise
than that the child, from want of
exercise in fresh air, gets  out
of health and condition ? The
bones are imperfectly developed;
being soft and spongy they bend
beneath the body weight, nor can
they resist the muscular contractions. How few families in London
of even the better class escape
wholly what is called rickets-"the
English malady," as the French call
it, from its frequency amongst us.
As with the child, so with the growing lad; and even more pronounced
still are the effects of town life to
be seen in growing girls.  The
chest does not expand properly,
           the
<pb n=35>
the bones of the limbs may grow in
length, but being soft and spongy
knock-knees or bow-legs may be
the result. A growing out of one
shoulder (a lateral curvature) is
another common type of infirmity;
and combined with these apparent
deformities there is the wan appearance, bad digestion, want of
spirits and energy, and so forth,
but ill-calculated to develop a
healthy man or woman.
<p>As with individuals, so with
families and races. Every one
knows of families who, owing to a
sudden accession of wealth, and
possessed  only  of  democratic
methods of enjoying it, have proved
themselves unable mentally and
<pb n=36>
physically to bear the strain, and
who drift intounwise extremes of
eating and drinking, religion or
revelry, lavishness or effeminacy.
<p>Again, looking round upon many
a previous race now in decadence
bears out the same fact. Luxury
destroyed the Roman Empire.
Spain, only yesterday, as it were,
fell from being the leader of nations
to the position she holds to-day.
The Spaniards, held in bondage
by the Moor, were for centuries
condemned to slave and toil under
their hard masters; the Moor, enjoying the luxury of sloth, despised
the labouring peasant. But out of
the stout hirelings sprang men with
strong frames and indomitable
<pb n=37>
courage, and the Moor had now in
turn to succumb.   From  Spain
the sons of labour sailed forth to
the utmost ends of the earth,
civilising, conquering, and adding
to their wealth.  So monetarily
wealthy grew they that in time
labour ceased to be a necessity,
the sons of the active spirits grew
up to laugh at labour, and in no
long time degeneracy succeeded,
placitude gave place to energy, and
now the sons of the mighty Spaniard
are content to play a second-rate
part in the affairs of the world.
Thus it is that luxury in families
or nations begets sloth in the unwise, and exercise of all kinds
comes to be considered vulgar. In
<pb n=38>
this country we are blessed with an
aristocracy of long and tried standing; those whom luxury had upset
have died out, and we are blessed
for the most part, with a race of
men and women capable of resisting the effeminacy and sloth, into
which their high position and attendant wealth might delude them.
<p>As an example of what <emph>artificial
exercise</emph>, wisely conducted, and in
fresh air, will do for generations
of families, as compared with exercise obtained <emph>at</emph> work in polluted
air, consider the following. As
an example of an industrious class
who works all the hours of sunlight, who seldom stirs out of
doors, and who knows no holiday
<pb n=39>
beyond, it may be, Christmas Day,
take the Spitalfields weavers. In
them we find a stunted, puny
race, who become prematurely old,
whose grave and sorrowful countenances betray a body and mind
at variance with natural habiliments. Being an abstemious class
they continue, it may be, to a
third generation; but they are
more machines than active livers,
and, on the face of it, it is improbable that out of such a class
a healthy person could spring.
As an example of an opposite
class take  the  Royal families
of Europe at the present moment.  The sons and daughters
of our own Royal family can together
<pb n=40>
compare in physique with the
sons and daughters of any family
in the land.  Then again take
the German, Italian, Austrian, or
Russian Royal families, and it will
be found they are almost all of
them types of their races, and each
man amongst them fit to hold his
own in physique with the stoutest
peasant in his land.
<p>How is this to be explained
away ? Here we have two classes
living exactly opposite lives, one
condemned to labour incessantly
indoors, the other called upon
to do no manual labour. When
we look into it we find that the
former have departed from out-
of-door employment to sit and
<pb n=41>
watch the shuttle and the loom,
are assembled in a large town to
be near a market for their wares,
where the close employment and
polluted air bring upon them physical ruin. On the other hand we
find a class whose ancestors have
known no labour for centuries,
whose only work is compulsory
parades, but whose pastimes-
shooting, riding, drilling, yachting,
and such like-carry them out of
towns, and induce them to take
exercise of a beneficial kind.
Which of these two classes has
the better physique has been
already stated, and it forces this
conclusion on us, viz., that close
employment-<emph>i.e.</emph>, during all the
<pb n=42>
hours of sunlight, and in the polluted air of towns, is ruinous to
the individual and his progeny;
but that employment, combined
with artificial beneficial exercise,
produces a race which has a
tendency to increase in physique.
Hence there is no necessity for
wringing of hands, of lamentations
as to our national decline. It is
quite possible for us to follow
closely the city <emph>regime</emph> of to-day,
and still, by a system of beneficial
exercise, to compensate for the
apparent defiance of Nature's
laws.
<p>The instances I have given may,
by many of you, be considered to
be extreme; therefore I will take a
<pb n=43>
more familiar example. Consider
the percentage of the leading men
in almost any branch of industry
in London, and establish the fact of
whether they were born in town or
country. The boy who is to become a Lord Mayor is pictured as
invariably coming into London
from the country; and avoiding
pantomime revelation, turn up
Orridge's account of the Lord
Mayors of London, and take note of
the Mayors and Sheriffs who were
born in London. Few, very few, will
you find during the last hundred
years, and when the odd occurrence
took place, prominence is given to
the fact in a special footnote.  Of
the last thirty Mayors mentioned,
<pb n=44>
twenty-seven were born in the
country and the remaining three
of country parents.
<p>I take examples from amongst
the Lord Mayors in preference to
judges, or politicians, etc., who, if
born in towns, must of necessity
almost have spent some years of
their youth at one of our large
public schools  or  universities,
where beneficial exercise has been
obtainable, and where exercise in
manly English sport has lent vigour
to their frames and freshness to their
minds. The son of a townsman, however, who is to be trained in his
father's business, is more frequently
educated in a city school, and at
fourteen or fifteen enters an office
<pb n=45>
and pursues work. The sedentary
life inculcated, the close room, the
inevitable dyspepsia consequent on
hurried meals, the bending over
a desk, and the absence of fresh
air or any beneficial exercise, engender the belief that the lad
would be unlikely to attain eminence, and that by such up-bringing
our greatest citizens are not made.
We grieve over the fact that a
third generation of Anglo-Indians
attaining adult years is impossible;
but it may be that we have the
same non-continuance near home
without our having ever given it a
thought.
<div2 type=section n=5>
<head>[Part V]</head>
<p>Another point which is noticeable as the result of town life, it
<pb n=46>
appears to me, is <emph>that individuality
and enthusiasm  are gone</emph>.  Now
all England is becoming largely
"townified" in the sense of want
of enthusiasm. I have often been
laughed at for saying, that I could
tell which of the members of an
audience before me were town-bred
or not, by the way they take things.
The enthusiastic hearer-in other
words, the one who has sufficient
energy given him, or who has not
become two "urbanised" in his
manner-communicates in a variety
of ways that he is understanding
what one says and appreciating it.
The urbanised being is cruelly undemonstrative; he is interrogatory
and querulous in his interrogations.
<pb n=47>
If a joke is made the urbanised
person neither pretends to see it,
nor can he bother himself to signify
his disapprobation, beyond it may
be a dyspeptic sniggle; there is
nothing indicative of any mental
expression on his part.
<p>In town we are reduced, or raised
up, to a level, which is it ? And
nowhere more is this the case than
in London. A democratic negative
ness is what seems to be the aim
and goal of the rising generation;
the sinking of the individual to
be a passing show in the acquaintance of a few equally democratised
acquaintances. There is not enough
energy left in the "set" to make
<emph>friends</emph>. There is too much thought
<pb n=48>
of the community and not enough
of the individual.  There is too
much regard for what one's neighbours will say. The manly motto
of the Keiths, Earls Mareschal of
Scotland, of "They say; what say
they ? Let them say "-has given
place to-" They say. Oh, do they
say so ? Then we shan't do it."
<p>Any of you who saw a leading
article in the <bibl><title>Standard</title>,</bibl> of yesterday
morning, January 28th, upon "Our
Boys," must have been struck with
the truthfulness of it. The writer
of that article says boys are now
complete little gentlemen of the
world at fifteen. They have command long before then of their
feelings, affections, and manners.
<pb n=49>
They have lost their energy, self-assertion, and a certain amount of
what our Irish friends used to call
devilry.  The   writer of  this
article has had on his mind what
has been turning over in mine for
a long time, and I expect most
people have been thinking the
same, although many will combat
its truth, but still believe it in their
hearts.  It is the <emph>young</emph> people
now-a-days who shape manners
for their <emph>elders</emph>, and tell <emph>them</emph>
what they must do or leave undone. The generation now passing
away are taking all the enthusiasm
with them; it is the <emph>old</emph>, not the
young people who are enthusiastic.
<emph>They</emph> spread our civilisation, made
<pb n=50>
themselves rich and widened our
Empire, until now there seems not
much more to do. America now-
a-days returns many of the emigrants who used to be swallowed
up in her western maw.    The
levelling process has gone on until
foreign countries are tied to us by
bands of communication.   The
distant parts of the earth can send
news to us in an hour or two.
There is no sailing forth now-a-
days in search of unknown lands;
no facing dangers for the <emph>individual</emph>
as in the old days of discovery and
exploration.  The world in the
days of the generation passing
away was but opening up. Railways, steamboats, and telegraphs
<pb n=51>
were but developing their powers,
and disclosing their effects, and the
world seemed young, hopeful, and
full of promise. Now the work is
done, and, as it were, stagnation has
set in, and is now bearing its fruits.
Is this the cause of the apathy of
the young ? Think over it, for it
is a question which has serious
bearings.  How much better for
the future of this country were
the elders to assume the reins of
government as of old!   Instead
of the boy dictating to his father
what he ought or ought not to do,
or the boarding-school Miss telling
her mother, of whom she is rather
ashamed at times, how she ought
to behave herself, let them be
<pb n=52>
"taught" to be young before they
are old; let them honour their
fathers and mothers in the way they
ought. It was <emph>not</emph> the young who
made this Empire; it was not
good behaviour, nor fine manners,
nor apathy, nor perfect morals
which welded it together. It was
ambition, energy, enthusiasm and
love of enterprise, which sent our
fathers forth to unknown climes
and to brave perils of war and
weather.  It is beyond prophecy
to guess even what the rising
degeneration will grow into, what
this Empire will become after they
have got charge of it. The wisdom
at sixteen affects what used to be
considered sufficient for forty. Is
<pb n=53>
this modern wisdom of the proper
kind ? is this devotion, of townsfolk
especially, to their children, right ?
is this forcing and quick maturity of
thought desirable? is the placing
children on a level with their
parents what should be? is the
companionship which now-a-days
exists between father and son not
derogatory to the elder ? These
are all questions which time alone
will answer; but it may do so when
too late, and the bitter fruits will
cause children to curse their parents.
<div2 type=section n=6>
<head>[Part VI]</head>
<p>Now, I do not wish to stop without aiding in some way to allay
this monster which I have raised
This demon of want of beneficial
exercise and its results must be
<pb n=54>
combated; and how is this to be
done ? The sports and pastimes
which even thirty years ago were
sufficient for the health of the community have now become insufficient, and in consequence new
means of obtaining exercise have
been evolved. The three which
seem the most prominent, and
which have taken a real hold on
the community, are-1, Cycling;
2, Lawn tennis; 3, Gymnastics.
<div3 type=subsection n=1>
<head>I. Cycling</head>
<p>Cycling counts its devotees by
tens of thousands. From the Land's
End to John o'Groat's house,
men are familiar with the noiseless
wheels.  By the bicycle and tricycle men and women can be carried
<pb n=55>
rapidly out of town to country
lanes and open air. The exercise
is pleasant in that the motion is
rapid, and that one is sent along
by one's own exertion. Nothing in
the way of exercise could be more
calculated to do good to dwellers in
tons, and it seems a merciful interposition that such an excellent
means has been supplied. It allows
of really beneficial exercise when it
carries its rider out of an ozoneless
region.  If a cyclist is wise, he
will, when taking a short "constitutional," travel in the direction <emph>from</emph>
which the wind is blowing, as not
only is he more able when he starts
to go against the wind, than when
returning home tired after a long,
<pb n=56>
journey, but there will be more
good got from it as he more quickly
reaches fresh air, and it is possible
to get ozone to windward of the
town, but to leeward it is impossible unless a far journey be taken.
<div3 type=subsection n=2>
<head>II. Lawn Tennis</head>
<p>Lawn tennis.-Of modern inventions in the way of games, this
is one of the best. It is suitable to
young and middle-aged men and
women. It has many advantages
over other ball games, as it canbe
played at home with one's own
friends ; it may be engaged in for a
variable length of time; it can be
taken up with safety by anyone
without previous training ; it is less
likely to give rise to serious accidents
<pb n=57>
than other ball games. Lawn
tennis has more adherents than has
cricket; it includes men, women and
children among its devotees.  As
pursued in towns exercise of this
kind is not in the "highest" sense
beneficial, as it is performed in a
polluted ozoneless air.  Still, as
stated previously, exercise taken in
even such an atmosphere as that
of a London park, or a garden in a
square, is better than none at all.
Hence lawn tennis does not grant
such a beneficial exercise as does
cycling, from the fact that in but
few instances does it take people
out of town to play it.
<div3 type=subsection n=3>
<head>III. Gymnastics</head>
<p>Gymnastics have of late
<pb n=58>
years been a good deal taken up
by the youth of this country. That
this is an unmixed good is very
doubtful. The Romans had magnificent gymnasia, and in days of
hand-to-hand conflict they did, and
would do now, much good. But
the wretched dens we know of as
gymnasia are but as dog-kennels
to a palace. A few fairly good
gymnasia there are in this country;
but the majority are in cellars,
under archways, filthy, from the
products of gas which is an invariable accompaniment, the stuffiness
from overcrowding, and the sawdust on the floor. Even in the best
gymnasia in London, our youth are
condemned to go in the evening,
<pb n=59>
when the overcrowding and the
numerous gas flames render the
atmosphere filthy.  Besides, are
gymnastics real exercise? Do we
thereby exercise our lower extremities? No! Consequently they are
not a real exercise. When we exercise our arms only to the exclusion
of our lower extremities we may
then know we are wrong.    The
rowing man cannot continue in a fit
state unless he walks eight or nine
miles a day. Nor is any exercise
a real gain which does not cause us
to use our lower limbs; they were
given to carry us about to get our
food, and our hands were meant as
organs whereby to feed ourselves,
<p>Hence, of the three modern innovations
<pb n=60>
evolved, out of the necessity for some such, to counteract
the effects of town life, cycling is
the best; lawn tennis is excellent,
and when performed out of town
is purely beneficial ; but gymnastics
as practised in our gymnasia, are a
mistake, and likely to lead to
physical ruin instead of muscular
stamina. How good for our national
welfare would it be, did the future
"physical" state of those coming
after us concern us equally with
the more selfish interest in our own
"spiritual" welfare. There would
be preserved to the world more
healthy doctrines, more true Christianity.  In the words of Parkes
I will finish: <quote>"Were the laws of
<pb n=61>
health and of physiology better
understood how great would be
the effect! Let us hope that
matters of such great moment may
not always be considered of less
importance than the language of
extinct nations, or the unimportant
facts of a dead history."</quote>
