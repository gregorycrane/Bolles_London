<HEAD>History of London, from the Accession of William and Mary, to the reign of George the <num value="2">Second</num>.</HEAD>
 
<p>On the evening of the day that James II. finally departed from Whitehall, the Prince of Orange arrived at the palace of St. James's, where he received the congratulations of the nobility, and of the lord mayor, aldermen, and common council of London. Soon afterwards he assembled the spiritual and temporal lords that were in the metropolis, to the number of <num value="60">sixty</num>, who all resolved to sanction his proceedings, and coincided in his declaration to call a free parliament. They also addressed him to take upon himself the administration of public affairs till the meeting of a convention; and, by a <num value="2">second</num> address, they desired him to issue his letters missive <QUOTE>to the lords spiritual and temporal, being protestants, and to the several counties, cities, and boroughs,</QUOTE> containing directions for the chusing, within <num value="10">ten</num> days, such a number of persons to represent them, as are of right to be sent to parliament. 
<p>The convention parliament assembled at Westminster on the <num value="22">22</num>d of <datestruct VALUE="1689-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct>, when, after violent debates on successive days, it was resolved, that the abdication of James had rendered the throne <pb id="p.2" n="2"> vacant; and eventually it was determined, that the Prince and Princess of Orange <QUOTE>should be declared king and queen of England.</QUOTE> Accordingly on the <datestruct VALUE="-02-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, they were proclaimed with the accustomed ceremonies, and on the <datestruct VALUE="-04-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct> they were solemnly crowned in Westminster Abbey, under the title of William the <num value="3">Third</num> and Mary the <num value="2">Second</num>. 
<p>Sir Thomas Pilkington, the lord mayor, being re-elected for the year ensuing, in the name of the city invited the king, queen, prince and princess of Denmark, and both houses of parliament, to dine at Guildhall on the approaching lord mayor's day; at which time their majesties, accompanied by their royal highnesses, and attended by a numerous train of the nobility, repaired to Cheapside, where they beheld the gorgeous cavalcade pass; which, considering the beautiful decorations of the streets, the richness of apparel, the fine appearance of the militia and artillery company, the pomp of the royal regiment of horse volunteers, consisting of the chief citizens most sumptuously accoutred, and led by the earl of Monmouth, and the magnificence and curious embellishments of the several pageants, seems to have equalled, if not excelled, every thing of the kind hitherto seen in this city for splendour and magnificence. 
<p>The show being over, their majesties were, by the sheriffs, conducted to Guildhall, where they were entertained with a truly royal feast ; and the joyful day concluded with bonfires, ringing of bells, and general illuminations in all parts of the city. And, through the whole course of this solemnity, nothing was omitted to demonstrate the dutiful respect and hearty affection of the citizens to their majesties. Yet, a few days after, some malicious and impotent enemy spoiled the king's picture of the crown and sceptre. For the apprehending of whom the court of lord mayor and aldermen offered a reward of <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">five hundred</num> pounds</measure>.<NOTE><BIBL>Ken. Hist. England.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>Advice being brought of the defeat of the Dutch fleet in the channel, on the thirtieth of June, by that of France, after a gallant engagement for a whole day, though above <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="1">one</num>; and that this terrible blow was entirely owing to the inactivity and misbehaviour (to call it no worse) of Torrington, our admiral, who, during the action, basely lay by as a spectator; the citizens, concluding that the French, having now none to oppose them, would undoubtedly put their design of landing in execution, (to their eternal honour and praise be it remembered) like true patriots, acquainted the queen (by the lord mayor, aldermen, and lieutenancy, in the absence of the king in Ireland) in council, that they had, at that extraordinary juncture, in common council, unanimously resolved to support and defend their majesties persons and government with their lives and fortunes, to the utmost of their power; and <pb id="p.3" n="3"> represented to her, that the city trained-bands, consisting of about <num value="9000">nine thousand</num> men, were completely armed, and ready to march whither her majesty pleased; and, as an additional reinforcement to the said troops, the lieutenancy of the city had resolved to raise <num value="6">six</num> regiments of auxiliaries; and besides which, the lord mayor, aldermen, and commons of the common council, resolved, by a voluntary contribution, not only to raise a large regiment of horse and <num value="1000">one thousand</num> dragoons (wherein they had already made a considerable progress) but likewise to maintain the same for the space of a month or longer if occasion required. And prayed, that her majesty would be pleased to appoint officers to command the said regiments; when, with thanks returned for their hearty zeal and loyalty, she promised to comply with their requests. 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1692"><year reg="1692">1692</year></datestruct>, on the <datestruct VALUE="-09-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>, the shock of an earthquake was felt in the city and parts adjacent, but did no particular damage.<NOTE><BIBL>Monthly Mercury.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>About the same time, the Turkey Company, in a humble address, represented to the queen the vast losses they had lately sustained at sea by the French, for want of sufficient convoys; wherewith her majesty was so sensibly touched, that she not only appointed a committee of the privy council to examine into the cause of the late misfortune, but likewise that effectual care might be taken for preventing the like for the future. These laudable endeavours of the queen gave such a general satisfaction in the city, that the court of lord mayor and aldermen addressed her thereupon, with hearty congratulations upon the king's wonderful preservation in the battle of Landen, in Flanders; and likewise returned humble thanks for her majesty's gracious care of the merchants of this city; and withal assured her, that as they had formerly expressed their utmost zeal for their majesties' service, so they were heartily glad of the present opportunity of renewing the same, by assisting her majesty with money upon the present emergency; and humbly entreated her to be assured of their sincere and firm resolution of continuing their best endeavours upon all occasions, for the support of their majesties' authority and government, against all attempts whatsoever. And the citizens, for accomplishing their promise in the said address, immediately in common-council agreed to advance the sum of <measure value="300000l." type=currency><num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> pounds</measure>, required by her majesty, which they soon after raised and paid into the exchequer. 
<p>The year <datestruct value="1694"><year reg="1694">1694</year></datestruct> disclosed an infamous system of bribery; which, being investigated by the house of commons, it was proved that <num value="1000">1,000</num> guineas had been demanded and taken from the chamberlain of London by sir John Trevor, the speaker, for forwarding the Orphan bill; and in consequence of which, he was expelled the house; other bribes had been also taken by different persons.<NOTE><BIBL>Brayley's London, i. <num value="478">478</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The king being returned from Holland after the conclusion of the <pb id="p.4" n="4"> treaty of Ryswick, he was humbly entreated by the lord mayor and citizens of London, on that happy and joyful occasion, to make his public entry into this city; which his majesty graciously condescending to, he was pleased, on the <datestruct VALUE="-11-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, to set out from Greenwich in his coach of state, accompanied by his royal highness George, prince of Denmark, and attended by the great officers of state, together with a vast train of the nobility and gentry. On his majesty's approach to the city, he was received at St. Margaret's-hill, in Southwark, by the lord mayor, aldermen, recorder, and sheriffs, in their formalities on horseback; where the lord mayor, alighting, presented the city sword to his majesty, who returned it, with a gracious command to bear it before him. Whereupon the recorder dismounted, and, in a short, but eloquent speech, congratulated his majesty on the conclusion of the late peace, and on his safe and happy return to his dutiful and loyal people. 
<p>From thence a <num value="100">hundred</num> of the city trained bands led the way, followed by <num value="2">two</num> of the king's coaches, and <num value="1">one</num> of prince George's, the <num value="2">two</num> city marshals with their men; the sheriffs, and city officers, according to their several degrees, the latter on horseback; after whom rode the aldermen, sheriffs, and such as had fined for either of those dignities. 
<p>Then came the king's trumpets and kettle-drums, the heralds of arms, according to their distinctions, between the serjeants at arms bearing their maces, all bare-headed. Then the lord-mayor, in a crimson velvet gown, with his collar and jewel, bearing the sword between Clarencieux king at arms on his right hand, and <num value="1">one</num> of the gentleman ushers on the left. 
<p>Then the king, in a rich coach of state, accompanied by prince George, with <num value="1">one</num> gentleman of the bed-chamber in waiting, and attended on each side by his majesty's equerries, footmen, and yeomen of the guard, led by their respective officers, and followed by his majesty's life-guards, and a long train of coaches, with each <num value="6">six</num> horses, of the great officers of state, nobility, and others. The streets were all the way lined and guarded by the trained-bands. 
<p>Arriving at Whitehall, the lord mayor attended his majesty to the foot of the stairs leading to the royal apartments; where, having taken leave of his majesty, his lordship and the aldermen were conducted to the lord-steward's lodging, where they were entertained with an elegant supper. 
<p>The balconies and windows were crowded with infinite numbers of spectators; so that it was in a manner a double shew, while the cavalcade was a pleasing sight to the beholders, and they no less a delightful object to the cavalcade. 
<p>On this joyful occasion, the city was embellished with the most pompous decorations; and before St. Paul's school were placed the blue-coat-boys, <num value="1">one</num> of whom congratulated his majesty n a very handsome speech.<NOTE><BIBL>Monthly Mercury.</BIBL></NOTE>
 <pb id="p.5" n="5"> 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1697"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct>, a measure of great utility to the metropolis was carried into execution. Various places, to which, before the Reformation, the privilege of sanctuary was attached, had by the lapse of time so far degenerated from their original destination, as to become receptacles for unprincipled and lawless persons, who fled to them as places of refuge from justice and legal authority. The evils thus produced had grown so enormous as to demand the interference of the legislature; and an act of parliament was passed, by which all the following places of abused privilege were suppressed, viz. the sanctuary in the Minories; those in the neighbourhood of Fleet-street, as Salisbury-court, Whitefriars, Ram-alley, and Mitrecourt; Fulwood's-rents, in Holborn, and Baldwin's-gardens, in Gray's-inn-lane; the Savoy in the Strand; and Montague-close, Deadman's-place, the Clink, and the Mint, in Southwark. This last place, however, through the supineness of the magistracy, was suffered to re-assume its former character, and that with encreased profligacy; nor was it finally suppressed till the reign of George the <num value="1">First</num>. 
<p>On the disbanding of the army after the peace of Ryswick in the same year, many papists, and other disaffected persons, resorted to London, which occasioned a proclamation to be issued, restricting them to a distance of not less than <num value="10">ten</num> miles from the metropolis, on penalty of being punished as recusants. Similar proclamations were issued in <datestruct value="1699--"><year reg="1699">1699</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1700--"><year reg="1700">1700</year></datestruct>, and the city magistrates were strictly enjoined to prevent the opening of mass-houses and popish schools, and also empowered to seize all arms and ammunition that might be found in the possession of papists or disaffected persons. 
<p>On the death of king William, the <datestruct VALUE="1702-03-8"><day reg="8">eighth</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1702">1702</year></datestruct>, the princess Anne, eldest surviving daughter of James the <num value="2">Second</num>, who had married George, prince of Denmark, acceded to the throne, and was crowned at Westminster on the <datestruct VALUE="-04-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>. On the <datestruct VALUE="-11-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, the new queen dined with the corporation at Guildhall; and on the <num value="12">12th</num>, she went in great state to St. Paul's, accompanied by both houses of parliament, to attend a solemn thanksgiving for the success of the earl of Marlborough in the Low Countries, and of sir George Rooke at Vigo. 
<p>The year <datestruct value="1703"><year reg="1703">1703</year></datestruct> was remarkable for a dreadful storm of wind which arose about <num value="10">10</num> o'clock during the night of the <datestruct VALUE="-11-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, and continued to rage with extreme violence till <num value="7">seven</num> the next morning, when it gradually moderated. The devastation was most extensive, and every part of the kingdom experienced its ravages. The damage sustained by the city of London alone was estimated at <num value="2">two</num> millions sterling; and vast loss was also sustained in other parts of the metropolis. Upwards of <num value="2000">two thousand</num> stacks of chimnies were blown down; and the streets were covered with broken tiles and slates from the roofs of houses. The lead on the tops of several churches was rolled up like skins of parchment; and at Westminster abbey, Christ's Hospital, St. Andrew's, Holborn, and many <pb id="p.6" n="6"> other places, it was carried off from the buildings. The roof of the guard-room, at Whitehall, was carried entirely away; <num value="2">two</num> new-built turrets on the church of St. Mary Aldermary, <num value="1">one</num> of the spires of St. Saviour's, Southwark, and the <num value="4">four</num> pinnacles on the tower of St. Michael's, Crooked-lane, were wholly blown down; the vanes and spindles of the weathercocks were bent in many places; several houses near Moorfields were levelled with the ground, as were about <num value="20">twenty</num> others in the out-parts, with a great number of brick walls, and gable ends of houses innumerable. <num value="21">Twenty-one</num> persons were killed by the fall of the ruins, and about <num value="200">two hundred</num> others were greatly maimed. All the ships in the river Thames, between London-bridge and Limehouse, except <num value="4">four</num>, were broken from their moorings, and thrown on shore; upwards of <num value="400">four hundred</num> wherries were entirely lost; more than <num value="60">sixty</num> barges were driven foul of London-bridge, and as many more were either sunk or staved between the bridge and Hammersmith; these events were attended with the loss of many lives. The destruction at sea far exceeded that on the land; and in this dismal night, <num value="12">twelve</num> men of war, with upwards of eighteen <num value="100">hundred</num> men on board, perished within sight of their own shore; great numbers of merchantmen were also lost, and the whole of the damage was so great, that its amount defied computation.<NOTE><BIBL>Account of the Storm, <datestruct value="1703--"><year reg="1703">1703</year></datestruct>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The years <datestruct value="1704--"><year reg=1704>1704</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1706--"><year reg=1706>1706</year></datestruct> were distinguished by the glorious battles of Blenheim and Ramilies, obtained over the French and Bavarians by the duke of Marlborough, who, on both occasions, was splendidly entertained by the city, together with many of the principal nobility and general officers. The standards and colours taken at Blenheim were directed by the queen to be put up in Westminster-hall; those captured at Ramilies were presented by her majesty to the city, and placed in Guildhall. Another memorable event of the year <datestruct value="1706"><year reg="1706">1706</year></datestruct> was the union with Scotland, the terms of which were finally settled between the English and Scotch commissioners at the Cock-pit, Whitehall; subject, however, to the revision of the parliament, who confirmed the measure, and passed the Act of Union. On this occasion the queen went in solemn procession to St. Paul's cathedral.<NOTE><BIBL>Brayley's London, i. <num value="480">480</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>Many destructive fires having recently happened, chiefly through the inattention of servants, an act of parliament was passed in <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, by which it was enacted, <QUOTE>that every servant, by whose negligence or carelessness a fire should be occasioned, should forfeit <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">100</num>l.</measure> or in default be imprisoned and kept to hard labour during eighteen months. All churchwardens within the bills of mortality were also empowered, at the charge of their respective parishes, to fix upon the several main water-pipes in the streets, stop-blocks, or fire-cocks; and also to provide a large hand engine, with a leather pipe and socket to screw upon the fire-cock; and for the future, that all party-walls should be entirely of brick or stone.</QUOTE> <pb id="p.7" n="7"> 
<p>About the middle of August, such a prodigious quantity of flies fell in this city, that they covered many of the streets; and upon which the impressions of people's feet were as plainly seen as upon a thick snow; some hundreds of bushels were swept into the kennels.<NOTE><BIBL>Maitland's London, i. <num value="507">507</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The year <datestruct value="1709"><year reg="1709">1709</year></datestruct> was marked by a circumstance highly creditable to the humanity of the nation. The cruel depredations of the French in the Palatinate, at different periods, had reduced the inhabitants to such extreme distress, that they were at last compelled to desert their country; and as they did not think themselves so secure in any other place as in Great Britain, no less than <num value="12000">twelve thousand</num> arrived here, in the most forlorn condition, and sought refuge in the neighbourhood of London. The queen, naturally humane, supported them out of her privy purse for some time; and she was afterwards assisted by the benevolent donations of her subjects, and no less than <num value="220381">22,0381</num>. was paid into the chamber of the city of London, for the relief of these distressed fugitives; who were at length finally disposed of by being sent as colonists to Ireland and North America. 
<p>The metropolis was greatly convulsed at the commencement of the year <datestruct value="1710"><year reg="1710">1710</year></datestruct>, from the effects produced by <num value="2">two</num> sermons preached by Henry Sacheverel, D. D. and chaplain of St. Saviour's, Southwark, which were voted in the house of commons to be  <QUOTE>malicious, scandalous, and seditious libels.</QUOTE>  The <num value="1">first</num> sermon was preached at the assizes held at Derby, on the <datestruct VALUE="-08-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, and the last before the lord mayor, aldermen, and citizens of London, on the <datestruct VALUE="-11-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, in St. Paul's church. And his trial commencing on the <datestruct VALUE="-02-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, before the lords in Westminster-hall, the populace imagined, that instead of the doctor's ruin, that of the church was intended; and believing the same to be a contrivance of the presbyterians, breathed destruction to them and all other dissenters. And a great multitude returning with the doctor from Westminster, on the <num value="3">third</num> day of his trial, to his lodgings in the Temple, they ran from thence like so many enraged furies, to the meeting-house of Mr. Burgess, a presbyterian minister, in New-court, Little Lincoln's Inn-fields, which they instantly breaking open, stripped it of its doors, casements, sconces, wainscot, pews, and pulpit, which they carried into Lincoln's-inn-fields; and whilst they were erecting the same into a pile, a party was sent to surprise Burgess at his house, in order to have burnt him in his pulpit, on the top of the said pile; but Burgess providentially escaping out at a back window, luckily got off without being made a holocaust to party zeal. 
<p>The mob, being increased to an excessive multitude, divided themselves into divers parties, who, taking different routs, ran and destroyed the meeting-houses in Drury-lane, New-street, Leather-lane, Black-friars, and St. John's-square. <pb id="p.8" n="8"> 
<p>This commotion occasioning a great uneasiness in the directors of the Bank, they assembled to concert measures proper to be taken at that juncture; pursuant to the resolutions agreed upon, they sent to the principal secretary of state for a guard to prevent an attempt upon the Bank. This message was no sooner received than the earl of Sunderland acquainted the queen therewith, who, with the greatest concern, commanded his lordship forthwith to dispatch the guards, both horse and foot, to quell the tumult; but the earl; representing the danger her majesty's person might be exposed to, by being deprived of her guards in a time of such general distraction, especially by night, (it being about <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock) she generously replied that God would be her guard; therefore desired him to lose no time. 
<p>Pursuant to this command, Sunderland immediately repaired to his office at Whitehall, where the lord chancellor, duke of Newcastle, and others of the nobility, waited his return. The secretary having sent for Horsey, the commanding officer of the guard, ordered him immediately to mount, march, and disperse the mob; the captain, being upon duty for the immediate preservation of the queen's person, refused to obey the secretary's order; but being told that it was her majesty's express command, he complied upon this condition, that Sunderland should give him an order under his hand; but no time being to be lost, the earl, upon his honour, promised him such an order next morning. Whereupon the old soldier merrily asked whether he was to preach or to fight the mob? If the former, he desired a better speaker might be sent; but if the latter, fighting was his trade, and he would do his best. Sunderland replied, that must be left to his own discretion; but to forbear violent means but in case of necessity. 
<p>Matters thus agreed upon between the earl of Sunderland and the captain, he marched at the head of his guard to Drury-lane, where he easily dispersed the mob; but George Purchase, a broken trooper, but then a bailiff's follower, with a few of the most resolute of his companions, made a stand, and cried,  <QUOTE>Damn ye, who are you for, high church, or low church, or Dr. Sacheverel?</QUOTE>  And encouraging his fellows, said,  <QUOTE> Come on, boys, I'll lead you; I'm for high church and Sacheverel, and I'll lose my life in the cause.</QUOTE>  Then running resolutely with his sword, made a full pass at the captain; but being parried, was instantly apprehended, with most of his followers. Whereupon, a small detachment being sent to guard the Bank, the rest marched to Blackfriars, where, meeting with some opposition from the rabble that was rifling the meeting-house in that place, they attacked them, and by wounding some of the most desperate, they all took to their heels; but divers being taken in the pursuit, were immediately sent to prison. The news of this rough treatment had no sooner reached the other mobs, dispersed in divers parts of the city, than they immediately retired. However, the guards patrolled the streets, not only the remaining part of the night, but likewise for divers nights after. During this tumult, the <pb id="p.9" n="9"> trained-bands drums were beating to arms all over the city, and <num value="1">one</num> regiment thereof were continually kept on duty during the remaining part of Sacheverel's trial; who at last was condemned not to preach during the term of <num value="3">three</num> years, and his <num value="2">two</num> sermons to be burnt at the Royal Exchange, by the hands of the common hangman. 
<p>The number of houses and inhabitants being greatly increased in the city of London and its suburbs, the churches were thereby rendered insufficient for their accommodation; wherefore, the parliament, in <datestruct value="1710--"><year reg="1710">1710</year></datestruct>, enacted, that  <QUOTE><num value="50">fifty</num> new churches should be erected in or near the populous cities of London and Westminster, or suburbs thereof.</QUOTE>  For which purpose, they laid a duty of <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> upon every chaldron or ton of coals that should be brought into the port of London. 
<p>The city of London having been greatly injured by the number of foreigners who exercised manual operations, and retail trades, in contradiction to the laws and customs of the city, an act of common council was passed in this year, <QUOTE>That no person whatsoever, not being free of the city, shall, by any colour, way, or means whatsoever, directly or indirectly, by himself or any other, use, exercise, or occupy, any art, trade, mystery, manual occupation, or handicraft whatsoever; or keep any shop, room, or place whatsoever, inward or outward, for show, sale, or putting to sale, of any wares or merchandize whatsoever, by way of retail, within the said city or the liberties thereof, upon pain to forfeit <measure value="5l." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> pounds</measure>. And that what freeman soever does set any person that is not free, on work, knowing, and having notice given to him, that such person, so by him to be set to work, is a foreigner, shall forfeit <measure value="5l." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> pounds</measure>. And that the freeman, who employs a foreigner to sell by retail, shall also forfeit <measure value="5l." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> pounds</measure> for every offence.</QUOTE> 
<p>A rumour being spread in <datestruct value="1712--"><year reg="1712">1712</year></datestruct>, that the ministry were plotting for the pretender's accession to the crown, the trading part of the city were so intimidated at it, that a total stop was put to all commerce, and the general credit of the nation suffered greatly. In this critical juncture, the queen found it necessary for the support of credit, and to prevent the citizens from entering into associations or schemes, by which the measures of government might be impeded, to send a letter to the lord mayor, to be communicated to the aldermen and citizens,  <QUOTE>to the intent that they might all, in their several stations, contribute to discountenance and put a stop to those malicious rumours, spread by evil-disposed persons, to the prejudice of credit, and the imminent hazard of the public peace and tranquillity.</QUOTE>  
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1713"><year reg="1713">1713</year></datestruct>, a peace being made with France, it was publicly proclaimed in London on the <datestruct VALUE="-07-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>; on which occasion, both houses of parliament attended a general thanksgiving at Saint Paul's. Her majesty, being ill of the gout, was unable to be present at the solemnity. She died <datestruct VALUE="1714-08-1"><month reg="08">August</month> the <day reg=1>1st</day> <year reg=1714>1714</year></datestruct>. <pb id="p.10" n="10"> 
<p>On the death of queen Anne, George Lewis, elector of Hanover, was proclaimed king of Great Britain, &amp;c. with the usual solemnities: soon after which his majesty made his public entry into London, accompanied by his son, prince George. In a few days after, the city and lieutenancy addressed his majesty, in form, at St. James's; who, in reply, said, <QUOTE>I take these addresses very kindly. I have lately been made sensible of what consequence the city of London is, and therefore shall be sure to take all their privileges and interests into my particular protection.</QUOTE> And as an immediate mark of his favour, he conferred the honour of knighthood on John Ward, Gerard Conyers, Thomas Scawen, Peter Delme, Joseph Lawrence, and Robert Child, esquires. 
<p>His majesty having received an invitation from the city to dine at Guildhall on the approaching lord mayor's day, he was graciously pleased to accept of the same ; at which time, his majesty and their royal highnesses the prince and princess of Wales, attended by a numerous train of nobility, went to the usual place of standing, opposite Bow-church, in Cheapside, and after having beheld the pompous cavalcade, were conducted by the sheriffs to Guildhall, where they were sumptuously entertained by the citizens, who exerted the utmost of their abilities to convince them of their loyalty and affection for his majesty's person and government. And the lord mayor, having the honour to present the <num value="1">first</num> glass of wine to the king, his majesty was pleased to order a patent to be passed for creating his lordship a baronet of this kingdom, and at the same time ordered <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">one thousand</num> pounds</measure> to be paid to the sheriffs, for the relief and discharge of poor people imprisoned for debt. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1715-01-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month> <year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct>, a dreadful fire in Thames-street destroyed upwards of <num value="120">one hundred and twenty</num> houses, with an immense quantity of rich merchandize; and more than <num value="50">fifty</num> persons perished in the flames, and by other accidents. 
<p>The rebellion which had been excited in Scotland this year, in favor of the pretender, caused a great sensation in the metropolis, where many persons, supposed to be implicated in the plot, were apprehended and committed to different prisons. The city, however, was stedfast in its allegiance; and in an address to the king, engaged to  <QUOTE> endeavour the suppression of all seditious rioters and tumultuous persons,</QUOTE>  and promised a fixed  <QUOTE>adherence to the royal person and government.</QUOTE>  In the house of commons, several of the nobility and disaffected members of parliament were impeached of high treason; the earl of Oxford, lord Powis, the earl of Scarsdale, and sir William Wyndham, were sent to the Tower, and some other members were committed to the custody of different messengers. In October, <num value="3">three</num> persons were hanged at Tyburn for enlisting men for the pretender's service; and <num value="3">three</num> others were executed for high treason, at the same place, in December. 
<p>After the rebellion was suppressed by the victory obtained over the Scots near Preston, the <num value="7">seven</num> lords and principal prisoners <pb id="p.11" n="11"> who had been engaged in it, were brought to London, where, having previously been pinioned together at Barnet, they were led in that ignominious manner through the streets, when the lords were committed to the Tower, and the others to the Fleet prison, Newgate, and the Marshalsea. The earl of Derwentwater and viscount Kenmure, who, with <num value="4">four</num> other peers, had pleaded guilty to the charges exhibited against them, were beheaded on Tower-hill, on the <datestruct VALUE="1716-02-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct>; but the earl of Nithisdale, who was to have suffered at the same time, made his escape in female apparel during the preceding night.<NOTE>The large estates of the earl of Derwentwater were subsequently appropriated to the support of Greenwich Hospital.</NOTE> Many other persons were executed in the course of the year for high treason; and much severity was exercised against those, who, by their writings or deeds, expressed any sentiment favourable to the Jacobite cause.<NOTE><BIBL>Brayley, i. <num value="484">484</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The ministry, taking advantage of the unsettled state of the country at this period, caused <num value="1">one</num> of the strongest bulwarks of popular freedom which the wisdom of the nation had ever planned, to be removed; by abrogating the act for triennial parliaments, and substituting that for septennial ones. This measure received the royal assent on the <datestruct VALUE="1716-05-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct>; and from this era may be dated the commencement of that system of corruption and undue influence, which, gathering increasing strength with every year of its progress, threatens, at no very distant date, to surrender up all the liberties of the people at the footstool of the throne. 
<p>At this time, the city rabble, on most of the public festivals, (especially those of the king's birth-day, accession to the crown and coronation) assembled in a tumultuous manner; and with the most amazing assurance, by expressions and representations, publicly reflected on, and dishonoured the king, in the streets of the city; which being highly resented by the friends of the government, many of them formed themselves into societies to prevent the like practices for the future, and on all public occasions assembled in divers parts of the city and suburbs, at certain ale-houses, which, from the vessels they generally drank out of, were denominated mug-houses: at each of which were provided a great number of ashen cudgels, not unlike quarter staves; with which, upon advice of any tumultuous proceedings in the streets, they sallied out, and frequently, after a sharp engagement, dispersed the mob. This so enraged the populace, that they threatened destruction to all such houses; and, in order to accomplish the same, many thousands of the rabble assembled on the <datestruct VALUE="-07-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, and attacked <num value="1">one</num> of the said houses in Salisbury-court, in Fleet-street, with an intent to demolish the same. The landlord, in defending his property, killed <num value="1">one</num> of the assailants; but this did not prevent their breaking in and rifling the house, before they could be dispersed. However, divers <pb id="p.12" n="12"> of the rioters being taken, they were soon after tried; and <num value="5">five</num> of them being condemned, they were executed before the said house.<NOTE><BIBL>Maitland's London, i. <num value="521">521</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>Soon afterwards, the public peace was again disturbed by the Spitalfields weavers, who, finding their business affected by the preference given to the wear of foreign calicoes, tumultuously paraded the streets, and destroyed the obnoxious gown of every female they met, either by throwing over it corrosive liquids, or brutally tearing it from the back of the wearer. The attempts made to check these outrages by the police were little regarded, till the more daring rioters were fired upon, and several of them killed and wounded; others were committed to prison, where the ravages of a jail fever visited their imprudence by death. 
<p>In <datestruct VALUE="1717-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1717">1717</year></datestruct>, the trial of the earl of Oxford was commenced in Westminster-hall; but a dispute, on the very <num value="1">first</num> day, between the lords and the commons, respecting the mode of procedure, led to the acquittal of the earl on the <datestruct VALUE="-07-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>: the commons declining to go on in the way prescribed by the peers. <num value="2">Two</num> days afterwards, the earl re-assumed his place in the upper house. In <datestruct VALUE="1718-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1718">1718</year></datestruct>, a youth, named James Shepherd, was executed at Tyburn, for conspiring to assassinate the king; an act which he persisted in considering as meritorious to the very last; he suffered with great resolution. 
<p>The year <datestruct value="1720"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct> will be ever famous in the annals of London, from the destructive system of speculation and fraud, which history has denominated the South Sea Bubble; and which so completely infatuated the people, that they became the dupes of the most barefaced impositions. The notorious Mississippi scheme of a Scotchman, named John Law, by which the French nation was nearly ruined in the course of this and the preceding year, was the undoubted prototype of the many base projects that were now afloat to deceive the credulous multitude, and which eventually proved the bane of thousands. 
<p>The origin of the South Sea Bubble, Mr. Brayley says, may be trace d to an exclusive trade which the company possessed with the Spanish colonies, and which trade had been rendered extremely lucrative by the arts of smuggling. This caused a considerable increase in the price of South Sea stock; and the directors, encouraged by the prevalent spirit of avaricious enterprise, proposed to the government to take into their fund all the debts of the nation incurred before the year <datestruct value="1716"><year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct>, under the plausible pretext of lowering the interest, and rendering the capital redeemable by parliament, in a shorter time than could be then anticipated. The amount of the debts comprehended in this scheme was <measure value="31664551l." type=currency><num value="31664551">31,664,551</num>l.</measure> <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure> l <measure value="0.25d." type=currency><num value="0.25">1/4</num>d.</measure>; for the liberty of adding the whole of which to their capital stock, they offered to pay to the public use the immense sum of <num value="77238091">7,723,8091</num>. This bait was too tempting to be refused; the plan received the <pb id="p.13" n="13"> sanction of parliament, and the directors were empowered to raise the ready money necessary for so great an undertaking,  <QUOTE> by opening books of subscription, and granting annuities, to such public creditors as were willing to exchange the security of the crown for that of the South Sea company, with the advantage of sharing in the emoluments that might arise from their commerce.</QUOTE>  
<p>Before the bill had received the royal assent, which was given on the <datestruct VALUE="-04-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, so much had the public mind been impressed with the idea of rapid gain, that the company's stock rose to <measure value="319l." type=currency><num value="319">319</num>l.</measure> per cent.; during the same month it advanced to <measure value="400l." type=currency><num value="400">400</num>l.</measure> per cent. and by the <datestruct VALUE="-05-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, it had increased to <measure value="550l." type=currency><num value="550">550</num>l.</measure> per cent. This amazing rise was partly in consequence of a report which had been industriously circulated by sir John Blount, the chief projector of the scheme, that it was intended  <QUOTE> to exchange Minorca and Gibraltar for some places in Peru, by which the company's trade to the South Seas would be vastly increased;</QUOTE>  and partly, by the great advantages offered by the directors to all persons subscribing to their stock. 
<p>No further inducements, however, were now requisite. The delusion was attaining its zenith, and people of every rank, age, and sex, were eagerly crowding to partake of what they fondly hoped would prove a golden banquet. Even the more considerate classes of the community, those who had laughed at the folly and weakness of the <num value="1">first</num> adventurers, were no longer able to resist the dreams of such an easy acquisition of affluence as the bubble afforded. By the <datestruct VALUE="-06-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, the South Sea stock had advanced to <measure value="890l." type=currency><num value="890">890</num>l.</measure> per cent.; and on the eighteenth the directors opened fresh books for a subscription of <measure value="4000000l." type=currency><num value="4000000">4,000,000</num>l.</measure> at <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num>l.</measure> per cent.: and such was the popular phrenzy, that before the expiration of the month, the subscription was at <measure value="200l." type=currency><num value="200">200</num>l.</measure> per cent. premium, and the price of stock at nearly <measure value="1100l." type=currency><num value="1100">1,100</num>l.</measure> 
<p>About this time the Mississippi scheme was entirely broken up, and Law, its infamous projector, execrated by all France, was forced to secure his safety by flight.<NOTE>He was afterwards (in <datestruct VALUE="1721-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>,) brought to England by admiral sir John Norris; and having contrived to secure a full sufficiency of Mississippi plunder, and to obtain his pardon for the murder of Beau Wilson about <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> years before, when he made his escape from Newgate after conviction, he took a large house near Hanover square, and to the surprize of the honest, was admitted to associate with persons of the <num value="1">first</num> rank and <hi rend=italics>presumed</hi> respectability.</NOTE> This seems to have made some little impression on the buyers of South Sea stock ; and during the month of July, the price fluctuated from <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num>l.</measure> per cent. to <measure value="900l." type=currency><num value="900">900</num>l.</measure> Yet, by the contrivance of the directors in opening a <num value="4">fourth</num> money subscription at <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num>l.</measure> per cent in August, the stock for a short time bore a premium on that price of <measure value="40l." type=currency><num value="40">40</num>l.</measure> percent. The alarm had, however, been given: it had been whispered, that the directors and their particular friends had disposed of their own stock <pb id="p.14" n="14"> while the price was at the highest, and all confidence in the stability of their credit was now destroyed. The confusion became general; every <num value="1">one</num> was willing to sell, but no purchasers could be found, except at a vast reduction. Distraction and dismay spread through the whole city. In the <num value="2">second</num> week of September the South Sea stock had fallen to <measure value="550l." type=currency><num value="550">550</num>l.</measure>; by the <num value="19">nineteenth</num> it was reduced to <measure value="400l." type=currency><num value="400">400</num>l.</measure>, and by the <datestruct VALUE="-10-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct> to <measure value="370l." type=currency><num value="370">370</num>l.</measure> Within <num value="5">five</num> days afterwards it was as low as <measure value="180l." type=currency><num value="180">180</num>l.</measure>, and a short time after that was reduced to <num value="861">861</num>. per cent.; a price, probably, which nearly approached to its true value. 
<p>The destruction to public and private credit thus produced was excessive. All trade was at a stand; and many of the most respectable merchants, goldsmiths, and bankers of London, who had unwisely lent large sums to the company, were obliged to shut up their shops and abscond. Whole families were beggared together, and bankruptcies spread through every quarter. Numbers quitted the kingdom, never to return; and many, unable to bear the stings of remorse and poverty, which their own inconsiderateness had produced, terminated their woes by suicide.<NOTE>In <num value="1">one</num> of the periodical papers of the time, occurs this passage; <QUOTE>Ex- change Alley sounds no longer of thousands got in an instant; but, on the contrary, all corners of the town are filled with the groans of the afflicted; and they who lately rode in great state to that famous mart of money, now condescend to walk the streets on foot, and instead of adding to their equipages, have at once lost their estates: and even those of the trading rank, who talked loudly of retiring into the country, purchasing estates, there building fine houses, and in every thing imitating their betters, are now become bankrupts, and have by necessity shut up their shops, because they could not keep them open any longer.</QUOTE> </NOTE>
 
<p>The affairs of the South Sea company were soon afterwards investigated by parliament; and the villainous knavery of the directors was so apparent, that the greater part of their estates was confiscated for the benefit of those whom their chicanery had ruined. The sum thus obtained, amounted to <measure value="2014000l." type=currency><num value="2014000">2,014,000</num>l.</measure>, though an allowance was made to each director, in proportion to his greater or less concern in the iniquitous proceedings by which such numbers had suffered.<NOTE>How greatly the directors had enriched themselves may be seen from the following extract taken from the total of the value of their estates, as given upon oath:--

</NOTE>
 <pb id="p.15" n="15"> 
<p>During the inquiry before the house of commons, it was ascertained, that several members of the government were implicated in the guilt of this transaction; and John Aislabie, esq. who had recently resigned his situation as chancellor of the exchequer, was in <datestruct VALUE="1721-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>, expelled the house, and committed to the Tower, for having  <QUOTE> promoted the South Sea scheme with a view to his own exorbitant profit, and combined with the directors in their pernicious practices to the ruin of trade and public credit.</QUOTE>  The earl of Sunderland, <num value="1">first</num> lord of the treasury, and Mr. Stanhope, <num value="1">one</num> of the secretaries, who were also charged with participation, had the good fortune to obtain majorities of the house in their favour. James Craggs, esq. jun., secretary of state, and his father, the postmaster-general, both of whom had been accused, died within a month of each other, before their conduct could be investigated; but all the property of the latter, (acquired after a certain date,) who was voted a <QUOTE>notorious accomplice,</QUOTE> was ordered to be sequestered for the relief of the sufferers: the chief part of Aislabie's fortune was also seized for the like purpose. 
<p>During the continuance of the infatuation which the splendid delusions of the South Sea Bubble had inspired into all classes of society, many other visionary projects were set on float by speculators, gamblers, and sharpers; and even chartered companies of established credit and good fame, induced by the flattering prospect of immense wealth which the intoxicated credulity of the multitude seemed to promise, lent their countenance to schemes of impossible accomplishment. The popular phrenzy was so great, that subscriptions were made to the most absurd plans, without any other consideration of eventual consequence than that of gain; and the humourist who advertised proposals for raising a subscription of <measure value="2000000l." type=currency><num value="2000000">2,000,000</num>l.</measure> for the purpose of <QUOTE>melting down saw-dust and chips, and casting them into clean deal boards, without cracks or knots!</QUOTE> can hardly be said to have caricatured the undisguised chicanery of many of the schemes by which the avaricious and inconsiderate were content to be gulled. Nearly <num value="200">two hundred</num> subscription projects were on foot at the same time; and in the mania of the day, there was scarcely <num value="1">one</num> of them but what bore a great premium even upon its lowest shares. The intervention of government, conjoined with the awakened reflections of the people, at length put a period to the whole system of fraudulent speculation; yet, notwithstanding the exertions of the parliament, the shock had been so great, and the ruin so extensive, that it was a considerable time before public credit could be restored, or trade revived.<NOTE><BIBL>Brayley's Hist. of Lond. i, <num value="491">491</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The companies which had been most successful in practising the same delusive arts as the South-sea projectors, were those called the  <QUOTE>York Buildings,</QUOTE>  the  <QUOTE>Lustring,</QUOTE>  the  <QUOTE>English Copper,</QUOTE>  and the  <QUOTE>Welch Copper and Lead.</QUOTE>  The shares of the <num value="1">first</num> had advanced <pb id="p.16" n="16"> from <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>l.</measure> to <measure value="305l." type=currency><num value="305">305</num>l.</measure>; of the <num value="2">second</num>, from <measure value="5l. 2s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="5">5</num>l. <num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> to <measure value="105l." type=currency><num value="105">105</num>l.</measure>; of the <num value="3">third</num> from <measure value="5l." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>l.</measure> to <measure value="105l." type=currency><num value="105">105</num>l.</measure>; and of the last, from <measure value="4l. 2s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="4">4</num>l. <num value="2">2</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> to <measure value="95l." type=currency><num value="95">95</num>l.</measure> The attorney-general was subsequently expressly ordered by the lords justices to bring writs of <foreign lang=la>scire facias</foreign> against the patents of all the above companies. 
<p>During the height of this speculation mania, prospectusses of the following joint-stock companies were issued; some of them are evidently in ridicule of the stock-jobbing system:

<p>Besides these bubbles, innumerable were those that perished in embryo; however, the sums intended to be raised by the above-named airy projects, amounted to about <num value="300">three hundred</num> millions of pounds; yet the lowest of the shares of any of them advanced above cent. per cent.; most above <num value="400">four hundred</num> per cent. and some to <num value="20">twenty</num> times the price of the subscription.

This event excited the most lively joy throughout the metropolis; and the ringing of bells, bonfires, and illuminations, expressed the general prevalence of the popular feeling. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-05-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, a proclamation was issued for enforcing the laws against papists and nonjurors, and for expelling all the former to the distance of <num value="10">ten</num> miles from the metropolis.

<p>There being then no account taken of the number of horses in Southwark, nor any other part on that side the river Thames, within the bill of mortality, I shall therefore compute the horses in those parts, (which I imagine I may safely do) at the same number with that of the Tower-hamlets, viz. <num value="2980">two thousand nine hundred and eighty</num>; which makes the number total of all the horses within the bill of mortality, amount to <num value="20500">twenty thousand five hundred</num> and <pb id="p.24" n="24"> <num value="81">eighty-one</num>. But being told by the worthy lieutenant-colonel Ellis, that by the careless omissions of the officers belonging to his own blue regiment (which he soon after discovered) of Middlesex, within the bill of mortality, the number is very defective, it gives room to suspect that the other accounts are in the same condition ; if so, it is probable the defects may amount to some thousands; however, by a moderate computation, I shall only reckon them at a <num value="10">tenth</num>; which, added to the above number, will make the whole amount to <num value="20000">twenty-thousand</num>, <num value="639">six hundred and thirty-nine</num>.<NOTE><BIBL>Maitland, i. <num value="534">534</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>In July, captain Dennis Kelly was committed to the Tower on a charge of high treason; and in August, Francis Atterbury, bishop of Rochester, Christopher Layer, esq. Charles, earl of Orrery, and William, lord North and Grey, were also imprisoned in the same fortress for the like crime. In October, the <foreign lang=la>Habeas Corpus</foreign> act was suspended, and the duke of Norfolk and George Kelly were sent to the Tower on suspicion of their having been concerned in the conspiracy. Christopher Layer, the only person whom the ministry thought expedient to subject to any thing like a regular trial, was arraigned in the court of King's Bench for exciting his majesty's subjects to take up arms, and drawing up a plan for surprising the Tower and Bank, and seizing the king, prince of Wales, lord Cadogan, and others of the nobility. On these charges, though by no means well substantiated, he was condemned to die, and <num value="6">six</num> months after conviction, he was executed at Tyburn. The bishop of Rochester, George Kelly, and John Plunket, the latter of whom had been accused as a principal agent in the conspiracy, and committed to the Tower in <datestruct value="1723--"><year reg="1723">1723</year></datestruct>, were proceeded against by bills of pains and penalties; the bishop was adjudged to be deprived of all his offices and ecclesiastical dignities, and to be banished for life; Kelly and Plunket were sentenced to be imprisoned during the king's pleasure. The other persons who had been sent to the Tower were subsequently admitted to bail under an order of council. 
<p>The vast increase of buildings in the western suburb of London requiring a greater supply of fresh water than the existing works could furnish, an act of parliament was passed in this year, authorising a newly-erected company, called the Chelsea water-company, to dig basons, reservoirs, &amp;c. for the better supply of the city and liberties of Westminster, and parts adjacent, with water. 
<p>Various disputes having arisen among the citizens about party-walls and water spouts, application was made to parliament to put an end to these contentions, by whom it was enacted, that if any person refused or neglected to build his share of a party-wall, after due notice given him, his next neighbour may build it for him, and oblige the person so neglecting, to pay the charges of rebuilding it. And it was further enacted, that the water, falling from the tops of houses, balconies, and penthouses, <pb id="p.25" n="25"> shall be conveyed into channels or kennels, by pipes in the front or sides of the house, under the penalty of <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> pounds</measure>. 
<p>The election of lord mayor for the city of London this year coming on, as usual, at the common-hall, on the <datestruct VALUE="-09-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>, sir Gerard Conyers and sir Peter Delme, gentlemen, both of great fortune and merit, and also the <num value="2">two</num> aldermen next the chair, were put in nomination, and declared to have the majority of hands. But a poll was demanded, and granted, for sir George Mertins and sir Francis Forbes: which began on the <datestruct VALUE="-10-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, and ended on the <num value="3">3rd</num>. And next day, the sheriffs declared that they had cast up the poll, and that the majority of votes had fallen upon sir Gerard Conyers, and sir Peter Delme; who, being returned to the court of aldermen, they made choice of the former; which, in all probability, brought on the following application to parliament. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1724-12-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1724">1724</year></datestruct>, many citizens of London petitioned the house of commons, setting forth several grievances they laboured under in the said city, and praying, <QUOTE>That for promoting the welfare, for preserving the liberties, the peace and tranquillity of the said city, and for settling elections in the said city, on a just and lasting foundation, the house would take the premises into consideration, and give the petitioners such relief as the house should think fit.</QUOTE> Whereupon a bill was ordered to be brought in, for regulating elections in the city of London, and for preserving the peace, good order, and government of the said city. 
<p>This bill created a great ferment in the city, and was strongly opposed in the house of commons by <num value="3">three</num> of the city representatives, who received the thanks of the court of common-council for their strenuous endeavours to prevent it from passing into a law. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-03-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, printed papers were dispersed, inviting the citizens to assemble at Guildhall the next day, at <num value="5">five</num> o'clock in the afternoon, to consider the merits of the bill; but the lord mayor and aldermen, resenting this measure as a violation of their authority, ordered the gates of the hall to be shut as soon as the business of the common-council, which had been called on the occasion, should be finished. The lord mayor also sent information of what had passed, to the ministry; upon which, the guards at St. James's, Leicester-house, and Somerset-house, were doubled, and such other precautions were taken as kept all things quiet; the heads of the bill were also printed, that the citizens might be better informed of the law intended to be passed. 
<p>As soon as the citizens knew the contents of it, and that it was sent up to the house of lords for their determination, a great number of them petitioned the house against it, as being injurious to their liberties. After the bill was read a <num value="2">second</num> time, it was proposed by their lordships to ask the opinions of the judges, <QUOTE>whether this bill affects any of the prescriptions, privileges, customs, and liberties of the said city of London, restored to them, or preserved by the act passed in the <num value="2">second</num> year of king William and queen <pb id="p.26" n="26"> Mary, for reversing the judgment on the <foreign lang=la>quo warranto</foreign> against the city of London, and for restoring the said city to its ancient rights and privileges.</QUOTE> 
<p>Various debates arising thereupon, the question was put, <QUOTE>whether the judges shall deliver their opinions upon the said proposed question?</QUOTE> This was at length determined in the negative, in consequence of which the bill passed into a law; but the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> clause, by which a negative in passing acts of common-council was given to the lord mayor and aldermen, was afterwards repealed. 
<p>A treaty of peace having been concluded between the emperor of Germany and the king of Spain, very disadvantageous to the rights and privileges of Great Britain, and calculated to destroy the chief branches of the British trade, and to favour the pretender, the citizens of London on this occasion presented an address to the king, containing the warmest professions of attachment to his person and government, and the strongest assurances of their support against the designs of their common enemies. His majesty not only returned them his hearty thanks for this additional mark of their affection, but also entertained the lord mayor, aldermen, and common-council in a very sumptuous manner at dinner in his palace at St. James's, attended by the principal ministers of state, and a great number of the nobility. 
<p>The king died at Osnaburgh, in Germany, the <datestruct VALUE="1727-06-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1727">1727</year></datestruct>.

<p>On the demise of George I. his only son and royal highness George, prince of Wales, ascended the throne, by the name of king George II. His majesty was attended at his palace of Leicester-house, on the <datestruct VALUE="-06-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, by the lord mayor and aldermen of this city; when sir William Thompson, the recorder, complimented his majesty as followeth:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>May it please your majesty, 
<p>The court of lord mayor and aldermen of the city of London most humbly entreat your majesty's permission to declare their concern for the decease of their late sovereign, and to congratulate your majesty upon your accession to the imperial crown of these realms. 
<p>When they call to mind that intrepid valour with which your <pb id="p.27" n="27"> majesty early distinguished yourself in defence of the protestant religion and liberty of Europe; when they remember that mildness and prudence with which your majesty conducted the reins of government, when you was regent of these kingdoms, show in that short space of time your majesty obtained the hearts and affections of the people; when they consider those inherent princely virtues, which have rendered your majesty truly illustrious; these pleasing and comfortable reflections (with all their expectations agreeably confirmed by your most gracious declaration) yield the utmost joy and satisfaction to these your majesty's most dutiful and faithful subjects; it gives them a firm assurance, that your majesty will repair to them the loss of your royal predecessor, and be an indulgent father to your people; that your majesty will protect them in the enjoyment of their religion, their laws and liberties, and take delight in promoting their welfare and prosperity. 
<p>On their part, they humbly beg leave to offer their most ardent wishes for your majesty's health and long life; and your majesty may depend upon the most sincere and hearty endeavours in their sphere, for the support of your majesty and government; that they will be vigilant to confirm and establish the zeal and affections of your majesty's subjects, and do every thing in their power, that your majesty's reign may be prosperous and happy.</QUOTE>
 
<p>To which his majesty was graciously pleased to make this answer:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>I thank you for the early marks of zeal and affection you have given me on this occasion.</QUOTE>
 
<p>They afterwards had the honour of waiting upon the queen, whom the recorder likewise complimented as follows:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>May it please your majesty, 
<p>The court of lord mayor and aldermen of the city of London most humbly beg leave to express their concern for the decease of their late sovereign, and their congratulations upon the accession to the imperial crown of these realms. It is with great satisfaction they observe, that Providence bestows a crown on your majesty, instead of that you was pleased to refuse for the sake of truth and religion. And they presume to be assured, that it will be chiefly agreeable to your majesty, as it will increase your power of doing good. 
<p>They are sensible that they have already many obligations to your majesty, more especially for your care of your royal offspring, which fills even the most distant views with an agreeable prospect of felicity. They beg leave to wish your majesty health and long life; that you may be a comfort and delight to his majesty, and have the pleasure of being the author of many blessings to his people.</QUOTE>
 
<p>At a court of common council, held at Guildhall on the <num value="6">sixth</num> <pb id="p.28" n="28"> of October, it was unanimously resolved to invite their majesties, his royal highness the duke, and the <num value="3">three</num> eldest princesses to dinner at Guildhall, on the approaching lord mayor's day; pursuant to which, the lord may or elect, sheriffs, and recorder, were ordered to attend their majesties, to know their royal pleasure; at the same time a committee of <num value="4">four</num> aldermen and <num value="8">eight</num> commoners were appointed to attend his majesty, to desire leave to put up his majesty's and his royal consort's pictures in Guildhall; upon both which accounts his majesty being attended, he was graciously pleased to accept of the former, and comply with the latter; report whereof being made the next day in common council, a committee of <num value="8">eight</num> aldermen and <num value="16">sixteen</num> commoners were appointed to superintend the entertainment to be provided for their majesties. And the sheriffs having invited the duke and the princesses, their majesties, accompanied by the latter, and attended by the great officers of state, with a numerous train of the nobility, and all the foreign ministers, came into the city, and in a balcony in Cheapside, the usual place of standing, beheld the pompous procession pass; whereupon their majesties were conducted to Guildhall, at the entrance whereof the lord mayor, kneeling, presented the city sword to the king, who graciously returning the same, it was by his lordship carried before their majesties to the council chamber, where the recorder complimented his majesty in the name of the citizens, as followeth: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>May it please your majesty, 
<p>The lord mayor, aldermen, and commons of this city beg leave to offer their most humble acknowledgments for this great honour to the city, by the presence of your majesty, your royal consort, the princess royal, and her royal highness; their joy is inexpressible, to behold their sovereign condescending to accept their goodwill and affections, and in the most engaging manner, vouchsafing here to receive their homage and duty. 
<p>This day will ever be remembered by them, with the highest satisfaction; this happy day, which gave birth to their most gracious king, who is pleased thus to honour them, and who protects them in the enjoyments of all their rights and privileges; a prince, who takes pleasure in promoting their happiness, and who thinks it gives the truest lustre to his crown, to preserve the religion, the laws, and liberties of his people. 
<p>Fortunate is their present condition, and delightful is their prospect, while they have in view your majesty, their most gracious and justly admired queen, and the illustrious branches of your royal family. 
<p>Permit, sire, these your majesty's most faithful subjects, to take this opportunity of assuring your majesty of their unalterable attachment to your royal person, and the warmest zeal for the support of your government. 
<p>The best, the only security of our excellent constitution in <pb id="p.29" n="29"> church and state, and of every thing which is dear and valuable to Englishmen. Gratitude and interest make these the unanimous sentiments of this your majesty's most loyal and dutiful city of London.</QUOTE>
 
<p>From the council chamber their majesties (preceded by the lord mayor carrying the city sword) and the princesses, went to the hustings, where they were most sumptuously entertained, the ladies of the bed-chamber having the honour to dine at the royal table, while other tables were provided below in the hall for the nobility, foreign ministers, judges, ladies, and other persons of distinction, together with tables for the lord mayor, aldermen, and common councilmen. The illustrious company having seated themselves, and silence commanded, the common crier proclaimed, that his majesty drank to the health of the lord mayor, and prosperity to the city of London and the trade thereof, and that her majesty confirmed the same. Silence being again commanded, proclamation was made, that the lord mayor, aldermen, and common councilmen drank health, long life, and happiness to our most sovereign lord king George. And silence being again commanded, the lord mayor, aldermen, and common-councilmen, drank health, long life, and happiness to our most gracious queen Caroline, and all the royal family. 
<p>After dinner, their majesties, accompanied by the princesses, were graciously pleased to return to the council chamber, and thence to the long gallery, where they honoured the ball with their presence till <datestruct value="11"><year reg="11">eleven</year></datestruct> o'clock. On this occasion his majesty was graciously pleased to order the sum of <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">one thousand</num> pounds</measure> to be paid to the sheriffs, for the relief and discharge of poor insolvent prisoners. 
<p>Having mentioned their majesties being magnificently entertained by the city in Guildhall, I shall, for the satisfaction of the reader, subjoin an account of the entertainment, as recorded in the chamber of London. 
<p>For the accommodation of the illustrious company, <num value="15">fifteen</num> tables were erected in the said hall, at the <num value="1">first</num> whereof, upon the hustings, sat their majesties, the princesses, and the ladies of the bed-chamber; which, together with the other tables, were severally served with the following number of dishes:--

<p>The concert of music at this sumptuous banquet consisted of <num value="2">two</num> trumpets, <num value="1">one</num> kettle-drum, <num value="4">four</num> French horns, eighteen violins, <num value="2">two</num> violinchelloes, <num value="2">two</num> double basses, <num value="5">five</num> tenors, <num value="7">seven</num> bassoons, and <num value="6">six</num> hautboys; together <num value="47">forty-seven</num>. 
<p>The states general of the United Provinces having sent count Walderen and Mr. Silvius their ambassadors extraordinary to congratulate his majesty upon his happy accession to the crown, they made their public entry into this city on the <datestruct VALUE="-03-4"><day reg="4">fourth</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, in a very pompous and magnificent manner. 
<p>The streets of this city, and those of Westminster, having for a considerable time been grievously pestered with street-robbers, their audacious villany was got to such a height, that they formed a design to rob the queen in St. Paul's church-yard, as she privately returned from supper in the city, to the palace of St. James's, as confessed by <num value="1">one</num> of the gang, when under sentence of death. But those execrable villains being busily employed in robbing sir Gilbert Heathcote, an alderman of London, on his return in his chariot from the house of commons, her majesty luckily passed them in her coach, without being attacked. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1729-01-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1729">1729</year></datestruct>, a presentment was made by the grand jury of Westminster, against the notorious orator Henley, who, in his ranting effusions in a room over Newport-market, found means to attract a very considerable share of public attention, by mingling religion with profaneness, theology with the drama, and impudence with scurrility. The orator, however, having prudently obtained a licence under the Act of Toleration, boldly maintained his post, and continued his accustomed mode of lecturing, in open defiance of his enemies.<NOTE>The spirit and insolence of Henley may be appreciated from an extract from his next advertisement after the presentment of the grand jury had been published in the gazette. <QUOTE>At the Oratory in Newport-market, this evening, will be an oration on Elisha's bears, and the whole criticism and nature of bear hunting, and of bear gardens, to explain the text, and avoid bears, whether the bears in the text were <num value="1">one</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num>, (the number of the jury,) and who was to speak for them? and all the bear-play, rough and smooth.</QUOTE> </NOTE> In the month following, the grand jury of Middlesex made presentments, expressed in the strong language of reprobation, against  <QUOTE>the Geneva shops in and about the city,</QUOTE>  by frequenting which her majesty's subjects sustain incredible prejudice, since the constitutions of the labouring people are not only thereby weakened, but utterly destroyed; <QUOTE> against </QUOTE>  the unusual swarms of sturdy and clamorous beggars' which infest  <QUOTE> the streets, and other places, making them terrible as well as uneasy,</QUOTE>  and against  <QUOTE> the contriver and carrier--on of masquerades at the king's theatre, in the Haymarket,</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>where, under various disguises, crimes equal to bare-faced impieties are practised, and great sums of money illegally lost, which if not seasonably prevented, will, as it has already very much <pb id="p.33" n="33"> debauched, in a short time, absolutely ruin his majesty's best subjects.</QUOTE>  What effect was produced by these representations does not appear. 
<p>The close of the year <datestruct value="1729"><year reg="1729">1729</year></datestruct> was attended by a great mortality in London, arising, most probably, from the continual rains, and frequent stormy weather, through which cold and fevers became general: the numbers of persons that died within the bills of mortality, in the course of the year, amounted almost to <num value="30000">30,000</num>. During the winter, street robberies were again remarkably prevalent; people became fearful of stirring from their houses after dark, it being a practice of the robbers to knock down, and wound, before they proceeded to rifle their prey. On the evening of New Year's day, <datestruct value="1730--"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>, many lives were lost in London, through a dense fog, which rendered it so obscure, that several persons fell into the Fleet ditch, and others into the Canal, in St. James's Park, by mistaking their way; much damage was also done on the river Thames. 
<p>The month of <datestruct VALUE="1733-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>, was a very sickly time in London, almost every person being afflicted with head-ach and fever; the number of deaths in the week ending on the thirtieth, was upwards of <num value="1500">1,500</num>. 
<p>The year <datestruct value="1738"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct> is distinguished by the strenuous opposition of the citizens of London to a scheme, concerted by the ministry, for introducing a general excise, under pretence of easing the people of various taxes, and promoting the interests of the fair trader. Before the day appointed by the minister for introducing this measure into the house of commons, a court of common council being summoned, they unanimously agreed to recommend it to their representatives, to use their utmost efforts to defeat so pernicious a design; and their reasons were set forth in the following representation, which was delivered to them:-- 
<QUOTE REND=blockquote><p>This court doth apprehend, from the experience of the laws of excise now in being, that extending those laws to any commodities not yet excised, must necessarily be <hi rend=italics>very</hi> prejudicial to trade, both as it will probably diminish the consumption of the commodity to be excised, and subject the fair trader to the frequent and arbitrary visitations of officers, and judicial determination of commissioners, removeable at pleasure, and from whom there is no appeal. 
<p>That the extension of such laws must necessarily increase the number and power of officers, which will be inconsistent with those principles of liberty on which our constitution is founded, and will further deprive the subjects of England of some of those valuable privileges, which have hitherto distinguished them from the neighbouring nations. 
<p>Wherefore, this court doth earnestly recommend it to you, their representatives, to use your utmost diligence in opposing a scheme of this nature, should any such be offered in parliament, <pb id="p.34" n="34"> in any shape, or however limited in its <num value="1">first</num> appearance; being fully convinced, that an inland duty upon goods now rated at the custom-house, cannot be effectually collected, even with the extension of the powers, or the severest exercise of all the rigours of the present laws of excise.</QUOTE>
 
<p>When the outline of the proposed measure was stated to the house, and a motion was made for leave to bring in a bill, the city members opposed it with all their abilities, and were powerfully supported by many eminent independent members; but, on the question being put, it was carried in the affirmative, by a majority of <num value="61">sixty-one</num>. The success of the minister did not, however, discourage his opponents, who debated the bill, through every stage, with increasing earnestness. To prevent the contents of the bill from being known, a majority of the house determined that it should not be printed for the use of the members, as is usual: the lord mayor, however, with great difficulty, procured a copy of it, which he laid before, a court of common council, summoned to deliberate on the best means to prevent it from being passed; and it was resolved that a petition should be immediately drawn up, and presented to the house, praying to be heard by counsel. against it. The petition being presented, and a motion made for granting the prayer of it, another animated debate ensued; and on the division, it was carried in the negative, by <num value="214">214</num> against <num value="197">197</num>. 
<p>Notwithstanding this, the powerful opposition of the city, which was supported by several of the principal counties, soon convinced sir Robert Walpole of the impossibility of carrying his point, without endangering the peace of the nation, and his own safety. In consequence of which, the bill, instead of being read a <num value="2">second</num> time, on the <datestruct VALUE="-05-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, as had been appointed, was, upon a motion made by sir Robert, deferred till the <datestruct VALUE="-06-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, a day exceeding the time limited for the continuance of the session; so that the passing of the bill became impracticable, and sir Robert Walpole's scheme, by the firm and steady interposition of the citizens, proved entirely abortive. 
<p>The miscarriage of the excise bill was celebrated by public rejoicings throughout the cities of London and Westminster; and the minister who projected it was burnt in effigy. 
<p>Many great inconveniences to commerce, and frequent frauds having arisen from stock-jobbing, in the city of London, an act of parliament was passed in <datestruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></datestruct>, to prevent the infamous practice, by which heavy penalties were laid upon every fictitious bargain, for the sale or purchase of stock. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-01-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>, in the same year, a considerable tumult arose in Suffolk-street, Charing Cross, through the thoughtless conduct of some of the youthful nobility and commoners, who at a tavern there, and under the denomination of the Calveshead club, had ordered an entertainment of calves heads; some <pb id="p.35" n="35"> of which, enwrapped in bloody cloths, they exhibited from the <num value="1">first</num> floor windows to the populace, who had assembled round a large bonfire made in front of the house, into which <num value="1">one</num> of the heads dressed in a napkin cap was at last thrown, with loud huzzas. The mob, notwithstanding many of them had been plentifully regaled with beer and strong liquors, felt the indecency of the frolic so strongly, that they commenced an impetuous attack upon the house, broke all the windows, and destroyed every thing in the interior that came in their way. The imprudent members of the club were all forced to a precipitate flight to save their lives; and the entire building would have been demolished, but for the guards, whose arrival put an end to the disturbance. 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1735"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>, the inhabitants of the precinct of Black-friars claiming a privilege of exemption from the jurisdiction of the city of London, in right of the ancient monastery being dissolved there by king Henry VIII. occasioned the lord mayor and aldermen to ascertain their right thereto; which they did by a trial in the court of King's-bench, on the <datestruct VALUE="-07-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, wherein John Bosworth, Esq. chamberlain of the city of London, was plaintiff, and Daniel Watson, shalloon and drugget-seller, defendant. The action was brought against the latter, for opening a shop in Blackfriars, and retailing his goods there, without being a freeman of the city. The counsel for the plaintiff alleged, that Black-friars actually belonged to the city of London when it was a monastery, and before trades were ever occupied there; to prove which, they produced several ancient records, viz. a charter of king Edward I. and a record, <num value="2">2</num> Richard II. calling it the Friary of London; and another, <num value="21">21</num> Hen. VIII. mentioning a parliament, held at the Friars-preachers of the city of London, <datestruct VALUE="1530-11-3"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=3>3</day>, <year reg=1530>1530</year></datestruct>, and other records of this kind; they likewise cited a parallel case to this, <num value="15">15</num> Car. <num value="1">1</num>. when an action was brought against <num value="1">one</num> Philpot, a shoemaker, of Black-friars, for opening a shop and vending shoes there, without being free of the city; and, after a fair trial, by an equal and indifferent jury of the county of Hertford, a verdict was given for the plaintiff, with <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure> damages. In consequence of this decision, Black-friars became a precinct of the ward of Farringdon within, and sends <num value="2">two</num> members to represent it in the common council of this city. 
<p>An act of common-council was passed, in November, for the better regulation of bakers; in which it was enacted, that, in addition to the fine, the name and place of abode of every baker, convicted of making bread under weight, shall be published. 
<p>The streets of London being greatly infested with robbers and house-breakers, owing to the insufficiency of the lights in the night, application was made to parliament by the lord mayor and common-council, to enable them to light the streets in a more effectual manner: in compliance with which, an act was passed, empowering the lord mayor, aldermen, and commonalty, to erect <pb id="p.36" n="36"> a sufficient number of such glass lamps, and in such places as they shall judge proper, to be kept burning from the setting to the rising of the sun throughout the year; and giving them power to make a rate to defray the expence thereof. 
<p>An act of parliament was also passed in this year, to limit the number of play-houses, and to subject all writings intended for the stage to the inspection of the lord chamberlain. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-12-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, the freedom of the city of London was presented to his royal highness the prince of Wales; he had, a short time before, been complimented with the freedom of the company of saddlers. 
<p>The ancient watercourse of the Fleet rivulet, since denominated Turnmill-brook, having for divers ages cost great sums of money to keep it navigable, by frequent cleansing, which, proving very burthensome to the citizens, it was at last neglected, whereby it soon became so choked with mud and filth, as to be rendered unnavigable, (though, by an anchor found some time ago at Black Mary's Hole, it may be presumed that its navigation extended so far, if not, as commonly reported, to St. Pancras, where, according to tradition, an anchor was likewise found) on which occasion it justly received the opprobrious appellation of Fleet-ditch; in which piteous condition it continued till the great conflagration in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>. But, by an act of parliament for rebuilding the city of London, it was appointed to be restored to its ancient state of navigation as far as Holborn-bridge. And, by virtue of the said act, the work was begun in the year <datestruct value="1668"><year reg="1668">1668</year></datestruct>, and finished in <datestruct VALUE="1673-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1673">1673</year></datestruct>. The length of the canal being <num value="2100">two thousand and one hundred</num> feet; in breadth, <num value="40">forty</num>; and in depth of water, at the upper end, by a middling tide, <num value="5">five</num> feet. It was bounded on each side by a strong brick wall, wherein were built spacious vaults, as so many repositaries for sea-coals. The wharfs on each side, which were <num value="35">thirty-five</num> feet in width, were strongly supported by the said wall and vaults; and the whole charge of sinking, clearing, levelling, wharfing, planking, piling, paving, posting and railing of the said watercourse, amounted to <num value="27000">twenty-seven thousand</num>, <measure value="777l." type=currency><num value="777">seven hundred and seventy-seven</num> pounds</measure>; besides the money laid out in purchasing of ground on both sides for enlarging the said canal and wharfs. 
<p>But this new and spacious canal filling with mud and dirt as formerly, the charge of cleansing it above Fleet-bridge amounted to more than its annual produce; wherefore, it was again neglected, and the rails on each side being decayed, many persons perished by falling therein by night, and beasts by day; so that it was become a very great and dangerous nuisance, as set forth in the preamble to the act: which occasioned the city to apply to parliament (in <datestruct value="1733--"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>) for a power to arch over and level that part of it above Fleet-bridge; which was granted in this form:--<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>It shall and may be lawful to and for the said mayor, commonalty, <pb id="p.37" n="37"> and citizens of the said city of London, and their successors, and they are hereby empowered, within the space of <num value="3">three</num> years next ensuing the end of this present session of parliament, at their own expence, to fill up all <hi rend=italics>or</hi> any part of the said canal of Bridewell-dock and Fleet-ditch, lying between the <num value="2">two</num> bridges before mentioned, and to make the surface or top of the soil or new ground (wherewith such part of the said canal shall be filled up in pursuance of this act) even and level with the surface or superficies of the streets or passages now on each side of, and running parallel with that part of the said canal so intended to be filled up as aforesaid. 
<p>And be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the fee simple and inheritance of, in, and to the said ditch and ground, where the same shall be so filled, shall, from and after the filling the same, be, and hereby are, vested in the said mayor, commonalty, and citizens of the said city of London for the time being, and their successors for ever; who are hereby authorised and empowered, from time to time, to appropriate and apply the same to such uses and purposes, as they and their successors shall think proper and convenient for the benefit and advantage of the said city, any thing in the said in part recited act contained to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding. 
<p>Provided always, and it is hereby further enacted, that the said mayor, commonalty, and citizens of the said city of London, shall, at their own expence, at the time of the filling up the said canal as aforesaid, make, erect, and build a good and sufficient drain or drains, sewer or sewers, in and through the said canal, of convenient depth, and from time to time cleanse and repair the same, so that the shores and rivulets, that are discharged into the said canal, may without any obstruction be carried and conveyed into the river of Thames. 
<p>Provided always, and it is hereby further declared and enacted, by the authority aforesaid, that nothing in this act contained shall extend, or be construed to extend, to empower the mayor, commonalty, and citizens of the said city of London for the time being, or any person or persons holding, or claiming under them, at any time hereafter, to erect, or cause to be erected, any dwelling house or houses, sheds, or other buildings whatsoever, exceeding <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet in height from the level of the ground to the pitch of the roof, on that part of the said ditch so to be filled up as aforesaid; saving to the king's most excellent majesty, his heirs, and successors, and to all and every person and persons, bodies politic and corporate, his, her, and their heirs, successors, executors, and administrators, all such estate, right, title, inheritance, claims, and demands, of, in, to, and out of the premises, hereby vested in the said mayor, commonalty, and citizens of the city of London, as they, every, or any of them, had before the passing of this act, or <pb id="p.38" n="38"> might have had and enjoyed, in case this act had not been made. 
<p>And be it further enacted, by the authority aforesaid, that this act shall be taken and deemed as a public act, and shall be judicially taken notice of as such, by all judges, justices, and other persons whatsoever, without specially pleading the same.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The work was begun about the middle of <datestruct VALUE="1734-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1734">1734</year></datestruct>, and <num value="2">two</num> spacious arches of <num value="10">ten</num> feet high, and <num value="6">six</num> wide, as common sewers, were finished and levelled over by Michaelmas following. And a fine market-house, with other conveniences, being since thereon erected, the said place, by the name of the Fleet-market, was opened on the <datestruct VALUE="1737-09-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1737">1737</year></datestruct>. 
<p>Over this canal were <num value="4">four</num> handsome stone bridges; those of Holborn, the Fleet, and Bridewell remaining as common highways, whilst that of Fleet-lane was obliged to make way for the new market. 
<p><datestruct VALUE="1738-02-4"><month reg="02">February</month> the <day reg=4>4th</day>, <year reg=1738>1738</year></datestruct>, the workmen began to clear away the sheds, &amp;c. in Stocks-market, and to take up the pavement, in order to lay the foundation of a mansion-house for the lord mayor, pursuant to several resolutions taken by the common council of this city. 
<p>About <num value="5">five</num> o'clock on the <datestruct VALUE="-08-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, the city was greatly alarmed at the sight of <num value="2">two</num> large birds, which were perched on the top of St. Paul's cathedral, <num value="1">one</num> on the cross, and the other on the pine-apple; they were very large, and appeared through a telescope to be eagles, though some were of opinion they were cormorants. Be this as it will, they sat very quietly till a mall went up to the gallery and fired a gun at them, on which they flew away. Various were the sentiments of the multitude at this uncommon sight; and some, who turn every thing to omens, cried out, <QUOTE>See, see, how the Spaniards fly away at the firing of a gun; nothing else will bring the dons to reason.</QUOTE> This being observed to have such an effect to draw so numerous a multitude of people together, and the necessities of the state requiring the fleet to be suddenly manned, the press-gangs placed a live turkey on the top of the monument, which in a short time drew a prodigious number of gazers; by which means, many idle hands, proper to man his majesty's fleet, were presently picked up. 
<p>The night of the <datestruct VALUE="1739-09-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month> <year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>, was remarkable for a tremendous storm of lightning and rain, with some thunder, by which much damage was done in several parts of the town. The violence of the wind on the succeeding day did considerable injury to the shipping and small craft in the river Thames. 
<p>The winter of <datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>-<num value="40">40</num> became memorable from its uncommon severity, and the occurrence of <num value="1">one</num> of the most intense frosts that had ever been known in this country, and which, from its piercing cold and long continuance, has been recorded in our annals by the appellation of the Great Frost. It commenced on <pb id="p.39" n="39"> Christmasday, and lasted till the <num value="17">17th</num> of the following February, when it begun to break up, but was not wholly dissipated till near the end of the month. The distress which it occasioned among the poor and labouring classes of London was extreme; coals could hardly be obtained for money, and water was equally scarce. The watermen and fishermen, with a peter-boat in mourning, and the carpenters, bricklayers, &amp;c. with their tools and utensils in mourning, walked through the streets in large bodies, imploring relief for their own and families' necessities; and, to the honour of the British character, this was liberally bestowed. Subscriptions were also made in the different parishes, and great benefactions bestowed by the opulent, through which the calamities of the season were much mitigated. A few days after the frost had set in, great damage was done among the shipping in the river Thames, by a high wind, which broke many vessels from their moorings, and drove them foul of each other, whilst the large flakes of ice that floated on the stream, overwhelmed various boats and lighters, and sunk several corn and coal vessels. By these accidents, many lives were lost; and many others were also destroyed by the intenseness of the cold both on land and water. Above bridge, the Thames was completely frozen over, and tents and numerous booths were erected on it for selling liquors, &amp;c. to the multitudes that daily flocked thither for curiosity or diversion. The scene here displayed was very singular, and had more the appearance of a fair on land than of a frail exhibition, the only basis of which was congealed water. Various shops were opened for the sale of toys, cutlery, and other light articles; even a printing-press was established, and all the common sports of the populace in a wintry season were carried on with augmented spirit, in despite or forgetfulness of the distress which reigned on shore. Many of the houses, which at that time stood upon London-bridge, as well as the bridge itself, received considerable damage when the thaw commenced, by the driving of the ice. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1740-11-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct>, great devastation was made in and near London, by a dreadful hurricane, which commenced between <num value="5">five</num> and <num value="6">six</num> in the evening, and raged about <num value="5">five</num> hours; during which time a considerable part of Hyde-park wall was blown down, as well as <num value="1">one</num> of the pinnacles of Westminster abbey, and many stacks of chimnies in different parts. Several persons were killed by the falling ruins, and the roofs of many houses were stripped of their tiling, &amp;c. 
<p>The great augmentation in the population of the metropolis, rendering an increase in the magistracy necessary, the king, by his letters patent, bearing date on the <datestruct VALUE="1741-08-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1741">1741</year></datestruct>, empowered all the aldermen of London to act in future as justices of the peace within the city and its liberties. Before this, the <pb id="p.40" n="40"> privilege of acting as magistrates was possessed only by the lord mayor, the recorder, the aldermen who had passed the chair, and the <num value="9">nine</num> senior aldermen. 
<p>In the autumn of the same year, many inhabitants of London and the adjacent places, were carried off by an epidemic fever, which continued to rage for several months, and was thought to have originated in the heat and dryness of the preceding summer. In <datestruct VALUE="1744-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1744">1744</year></datestruct>, the lord mayor, aldermen, and commonalty, in answer to a letter from the king, acquainting them with his having  <QUOTE>received undoubted information of the pretender's designs to invade the kingdom with the assistance of France,</QUOTE>  presented an address to his majesty, expressive of their  <QUOTE>firm attachment to the king and government, and their determination to support both against the menaced attack.</QUOTE>  
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-02-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, a proclamation was issued, commanding all papists to depart the cities of London and Westminster, and within <num value="10">ten</num> miles of the same; for confining papists and reputed papists to their habitations; for seizing the arms and horses from such as refuse to take the oaths, &amp;c. and for putting the laws in execution against the instigators of tumultuous proceedings: and, on the <datestruct VALUE="-03-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, his majesty's declaration of war was proclaimed, against France at the usual places, and with the accustomed ceremonies on such occasions. 
<p>A great number of journeymen stay-makers and tailors having entered into a combination not to work for the wages established by law, and the same being represented to his majesty, the privy council, on the <datestruct VALUE="-09-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>, by his majesty's command, wrote a letter to the duke of Newcastle, <foreign lang=la>custos rotulorum</foreign> of the county of Middlesex, requiring his grace to recommend the justices of the peace to carry into execution the act of <num value="7">7th</num> George I. for preventing all unlawful assemblies and combinations. Letters to the same purport were sent to the constable of the Tower, and to the lord mayor of London. In consequence of which, the justices met on the <num value="26">26th</num>, and came to the following resolution:-- <QUOTE>That if any journeyman should refuse to work for the wages settled by act of parliament, he should be committed to hard labour for <num value="2">two</num> months; and that the master that paid more than the act allowed, should forfeit <measure value="5l." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> pounds</measure>.</QUOTE> 
<p>These resolutions were no sooner published than they produced the desired effect; the combination ceased, and the journeymen returned quietly to their respective employments. 
<p>The streets of the city of London were at this time so pestered with street-robbers, that it induced the lord mayor and aldermen to petition his majesty for  <QUOTE> a speedy, rigorous, and exemplary execution of the laws upon the persons of offenders, as they shall fall into the hands of justice.</QUOTE>  In consequence of this petition, on the <datestruct VALUE="-01-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct> following, his majesty issued a <pb id="p.41" n="41"> proclamation, promising a reward of <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">one hundred</num> pounds</measure> over and above all other rewards, for the apprehending of every person found guilty of robbery or murder. 
<p>The Chevalier de St. George, eldest son to the Pretender, landed in Scotland in <datestruct VALUE="1744-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1744">1744</year></datestruct>, at which time his majesty was on a visit to his German dominions. Through the indiscreet security of the regency, in refusing due credit to the intelligence at <num value="1">first</num> received, the young adventurer was enabled to make considerable progress, and after some skirmishes, to take possession of the cities of Edinburgh and Carlisle, and even to advance as far as Derby, on his route to the metropolis. Meanwhile, a courier had been dispatched for the king, who arrived in London about the beginning of September; when a letter was sent in his majesty's name to the lord mayor, informing him of the commencement of the rebellion in Scotland, and recommending his lordship to employ his utmost  <QUOTE>care and vigilance in maintaining the peace of the city.</QUOTE>  This was answered by an address, in which the citizens engaged to sacrifice all that was  <QUOTE> dear and valuable in support of the royal family and constitution.</QUOTE>  Similar addresses were carried up by the lieutenancy, merchants, &amp;c. of London; and soon afterwards, an agreement was entered into by upwards of <num value="1100">1,100</num> of the most eminent merchants, traders, and stock-holders, to take bank notes as cash, that public credit might be preserved, the run upon the bank having been uncommonly great, in consequence, as was said, of a design to furnish the rebels with gold; but which, either from finesse or necessity, had already been partially frustrated by an order of the directors, that all payments should be made in silver. 
<p>As the Scottish army advanced southward, the necessary precautions were taken for the security of London. The trained bands were kept in readiness, and the city gates strongly guarded. Military associations were formed among the more substantial citizens; and other bodies, among whom were the gentlemen of the law, agreed to form themselves into a regiment, under the command of the lord chief justice Willes, to be denominated,  <QUOTE> the association regiment of the law, for the defence of the royal family, and the preservation of the constitution in church and state.</QUOTE>  His majesty was so well pleased with this timely mark of their attachment, that the lord chief justice next day took his commission as colonel of the said regiment. 
<p>At a court of lord mayor and common council, held on the <datestruct VALUE="-12-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, it was unanimously agreed to subscribe <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num>l.</measure> out of the chamber of London, towards the relief, support, and encouragement of such soldiers, as then were, or should thereafter be employed in his majesty's service during the winter season, towards the suppression of the then unnatural rebellion. By this, and a voluntary subscription paid into the chamberlain's office at Guildhall, there was raised a sufficient stock to provide <num value="12000">twelve thousand</num> pair of breeches, <num value="12000">twelve thousand</num> shirts, <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> woollen caps, <num value="10">ten</num> <pb id="p.42" n="42"> <num value="1000">thousand</num> pair of woollen stockings, <num value="1000">one thousand</num> blankets, <num value="12000">twelve thousand</num> pair of woollen gloves, and <num value="9000">nine thousand</num> pair of woollen spatterdashes, which were immediately converted to the use of the army. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-12-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct> another proclamation was issued for discovering, apprehending, and bringing to trial, all jesuits and popish priests, who should be found after the <num value="9">9th</num> of that instant, in the cities of London and Westminster, or the borough of Southwark, or within <num value="10">ten</num> miles of the same, with a reward of <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">100</num>l.</measure> to those who should discover or apprehend any such jesuit or popish priest. 
<p>The quakers also distinguished themselves by raising a sum of money amongst their own people to purchase woollen waistcoats, which they transmitted to the army in the north, for the soldiers to wear under their cloathing, when obliged to keep the field in winter. 
<p>In consequence of the great progress made by the rebels, who had, by forced marches, and avoiding the rout of his majesty's forces under general Wade, advanced as far as Derby, in their way to London, the disaffected in and about the metropolis were so spirited up, that they publicly declared their sentiments; and several treasonable papers, called the pretender's declarations, were put under the doors of peoples' houses, and dropped on the parade in St. James's park. 
<p>Matters at last came to such a crisis, that the troops in the neighbourhood of the city were ordered to march and form a camp on Finchley-common, and the king resolved to take the field in person, accompanied by the earl of Stair; the militia of London and Middlesex was kept in readiness to march; double watches were posted at the city gates, and signals of alarm appointed. 
<p>This state of anxious suspence was, however, but of short duration; the pretender finding himself disappointed, and that no attempt was made by the French towards an invasion, called a council of war at Derby, where, after violent disputes, it was determined to retreat to Scotland with all possible expedition. 
<p>At a common council held on the <datestruct VALUE="1746-01-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct>, it was agreed to petition parliament for a repeal of the clause in the act passed in <datestruct value="1724--"><year reg="1724">1724</year></datestruct>, for regulating elections in the city of London, by which a power of negativing any question agitated in the court of common council was vested in the mayor and aldermen; and, in consequence of this application, a bill was passed for repealing the clause complained of. 
<p>The rebellion being finally suppressed by the victory of Culloden, gained on the <datestruct VALUE="-04-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, the lord mayor and aldermen, the court of common council, and the merchants, &amp;c. of the city of London, respectively addressed his majesty with their most sincere congratulations on that happy event. 
<p>Sir Richard Hoare, who was lord mayor in this troublesome year, received the particular thanks of the court of <pb id="p.43" n="43"> common-council and court of lieutenancy, for his diligence and steady attachment to his country, during the late time of imminent danger; for his constant readiness to call those courts together; and, in particular, for his personal attendance on all occasions. 
<p>The principal leaders in this rebellion were either slain or made prisoners; among the latter were the earls of Kilmarnock and Cromartie, the lords Balmerino and Lovat, and Charles Ratcliffe, Esq. younger brother to the earl of Derwentwater, who had suffered in <datestruct value="1716--"><year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct>. The <num value="2">two</num> earls and lord Balmerino having been adjudged guilty of high treason in Westminster-hall, were condemned to be beheaded; a fate from which Cromartie was spared, but which was inflicted on the others upon the same scaffold on Tower Hill, <datestruct VALUE="-08-18"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=18>18th</day></datestruct>. In the December following, Charles Ratcliffe was beheaded on Little Tower Hill, for being concerned in the rebellion of <datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct>, at which time he had preserved his life by escaping from Newgate after conviction. Lord Lovat was decapitated on the <datestruct VALUE="1747-04-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1747">1747</year></datestruct>.<NOTE>The remains of the earl of Kilmarnock, and of the lords Balmerino and Lovat, were interred within the Tower; those of Charles Ratcliffe were buried in the church yard of St. Giles's in the Fields.</NOTE> These executions were attended by an immense concourse of spectators, who crowded every part of, and avenue to Tower Hill, as well as the adjacent houses. For the convenience also of those that chose to pay for the accommodation, scaffolds were erected; <num value="1">one</num> of the largest of which, containing above <num value="400">400</num> persons, fell with a sudden crash on the heads of those beneath, on the morning of lord Lovat's execution. This accident proved the deaths of about <num value="20">twenty</num> persons, and many more had their limbs broken, or were sorely bruised. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-01-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>, the subscribers to the Guildhall subscription, for the encouragement of the soldiers employed in suppressing the late rebellion, held a general meeting, when it appeared that the surplus then remaining in the hands of the committee, amounted to <measure value="3300l." type=currency><num value="3300">3,300</num>l.</measure>, which sum was disposed of to public charities in the following manner:

<p>On the morning of the <datestruct VALUE="-03-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, a most destructive fire commenced at a peruke-maker's, named Eldridge, in Exchange Alley, Cornhill; and within <num value="12">twelve</num> hours totally destroyed between <pb id="p.44" n="44"> <num value="90">ninety</num> and a <num value="100">hundred</num> houses, besides damaging many others. The flames spread in <num value="3">three</num> directions at once, and extending into Cornhill, consumed above <num value="20">twenty</num> houses there, including the London assurance office, the Fleece, and the <num value="3">Three</num> Tuns tavern, and Torn's and the Rainbow coffee-houses. In Exchange Alley, the Swan tavern, with Garraway's, Jonathan's, and the Jerusalem coffee-houses, were burnt down; and in the contiguous avenues and Birchin-lane, the George and Vulture tavern, with several other coffee-houses, met alike fate. Mr. Eldridge, with his wife, children, and servants, all perished in the flames; and Mr. Cooke, a merchant, who lodged in the house, broke his leg in leaping from a window, and died soon after: various other persons were killed by different accidents. All the goods of the sufferers that could be removed were preserved, as well from theft as from the flames, by the judicious exertions of the city magistrates, and the assistance of parties of soldiers sent from the Tower and St. James's; notwithstanding which, the value of the effects and merchandize destroyed was computed at <measure value="200000l." type=currency><num value="200000">200,000</num>l.</measure> exclusive of that of the buildings. Upwards of <measure value="5700l." type=currency><num value="5700">5,700</num>l.</measure> was afterwards subscribed for the relief of the poorer sufferers, whose claims altogether amounted to about <measure value="8000l." type=currency><num value="8000">8000</num>l.</measure> 
<p>At a court of common council, held the <datestruct VALUE="-04-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, a bill passed for repealing all former acts of that court, touching the nomination and election of sheriffs of the city of London and county of Middlesex, and for regulating such nominations and elections for the future; in which it was ordained, that the right of electing persons to the office of sheriffalty shall be vested in the liverymen, and that the general election day shall be the <datestruct VALUE="-06-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, except it be Sunday, and then on the following day. That the person or persons elected to the said office shall take the same upon him or them on the vigil of St. Michael the archangel, next following the said election, and hold the same for and during the space of <num value="1">one</num> whole year, from thence next ensuing, and no longer, when some other persons shall be duly elected, and sworn into the same office in their stead. That at the general elections for sheriffs, all the aldermen, who have not served, shall be put in nomination, according to their seniority, before any commoner. That the lord mayor may, between the <datestruct VALUE="-04-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> day of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct> and the <datestruct VALUE="-06-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> day of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct> in every year, nominate, in the court of lord mayor and aldermen, <num value="9">nine</num> persons, free of this city, who shall be put in nomination for the said office, before any other commoner, and in the same order as nominated by the lord mayor. That if any so nominated shall, within <num value="6">six</num> days after notice, pay <measure value="400l." type=currency><num value="400">four hundred</num> pounds</measure> to the chamberlain, and <measure value="20bmark" type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> marks</measure> towards the maintenance of the ministers of the several prisons, together with the usual fees, every such person shall be discharged from serving the said office, except he shall afterwards take upon him the office of an alderman. That any <num value="2">two</num> liverymen, having a right to vote at the election of sheriffs, may nominate any person, free of the city, for the said office. That no <pb id="p.45" n="45"> freeman shall be discharged from such election or nomination, for insufficiency of wealth, unless he voluntarily swears himself not worth <measure value="15000l." type=currency><num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> pounds</measure>, in lands, goods, and separate debts, and the same be attested upon oath by <num value="6">six</num> other freemen of credit and reputation. That every person elected shall, at the next court of lord mayor and aldermen, give <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">one thousand</num> pounds</measure> bond to the chamberlain, that he will take upon him the said office on the <datestruct VALUE="-09-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct> next following. That the person elected, who does not give bond to serve, shall, if an alderman or commoner of the lord mayor's nomination, forfeit and pay <measure value="600l." type=currency><num value="600">six hundred</num> pounds</measure>; but, if nominated by liverymen, he shall forfeit and pay only <measure value="400l." type=currency><num value="400">four hundred</num> pounds</measure>, to be recovered by action of debt, in the name of the chamberlain of London, and to be applied to the use of the lord mayor, commonalty, and citizens of London, subject to the orders and resolutions of the court of common-council; except <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">one hundred</num> pounds</measure> to each of the new sheriffs, if <num value="2">two</num> fines happen to be paid, or <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> pounds</measure> to each of the said sheriffs, should there be only <num value="1">one</num> fine paid.

<p>The year <datestruct value="1749"><year reg="1749">1749</year></datestruct> was remarkable for <num value="1">one</num> of the most extraordinary impositions that credulity ever countenanced. About the middle of January, an advertisement appeared in the newspapers, informing the public, that, on the <num value="16">16th</num> instant, a person would appear in the new theatre in the Haymarket, who, after playing the music of every instrument in use, upon a cane belonging to any of the spectators, would walk into a common quart bottle, placed upon a table in the middle of the stage, in sight of the audience, and would sing in it; and, during his stay in the bottle, any person might examine it, and be satisfied that it was a common wine bottle. Some other feats were to be exhibited equally entertaining, and although it might be supposed impossible that mankind, even in a state of gross ignorance, could be so egregiously imposed upon, yet it is unquestionably true, that the scheme did take effect in the British capital, and in the middle of the eighteenth century. On the evening of the exhibition, the house was crowded with the nobility and gentry of both sexes, who sat very patiently for a considerable time, without the amusement of a single fiddle. At length, the audience grew tired and clamorous; and a fellow came from behind the curtain, and bowing, said, if the performer did not appear, the money should be returned: at the same time, some person in the pit called out, that if the ladies and gentlemen would give double price, the conjurer would get into a pint bottle. This was the signal for a riot; the greater part of the audience hurried out of the theatre, with the loss of cloaks, hats, wigs, and swords; part remained behind, who being joined by the mob from without, tore up the benches, broke the scenes, pulled down the boxes, and entirely demolished the <pb id="p.46" n="46"> inside of the theatre: all of which they carried into the street, preceded by the curtain, fastened to a pole, as a flag of triumph; where they converted them into a large bonfire. A strong party of the guards was sent for, but did not arrive in time to save any part of the property. No material injury was sustained by any of the spectators, from the confusion in the house. 
<p>The treaty of peace with France and Spain, which had been long in agitation, being concluded, it was proclaimed in London on the <datestruct VALUE="-02-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>; but so little pleasing were the conditions of it to the citizens, that their congratulations to his majesty were added to an address on the safe delivery of the princess of Wales. 
<p>The peace was celebrated on the <datestruct VALUE="-04-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, by a more magnificent display of fire-works than had ever been seen in this country. The machine which contained them was placed in the Greenpark, and represented a magnificent temple, adorned with statues, paintings, and inscriptions. With these, fireworks of every description were intermixed; the central part exhibiting a grand sun, having <num value="3">three</num> circles of rays of different coloured fire, extending to a diameter of <num value="70">seventy</num> feet, and in its orb the words <foreign lang=la><emph rend=caps>Vivat Rex</emph></foreign>, in bright fire. The playing off of the fireworks was preceded by a grand military overture composed by Handel, and a royal salute of <num value="11">one hundred and one</num> pieces of ordnance. His majesty, with his court, having previously inspected the machine, retired to the library at Buckingham-house to see the discharge of fireworks, which lasted about <num value="3">three</num> hours. During this exhibition <num value="1">one</num> of the pavilions caught fire, and was entirely consumed; but the flames were prevented from spreading to the rest of the machine. The park was thronged with an immense multitude, and some few lives were lost by different accidents. The number of fireworks played off amounted to upwards of <num value="32000">thirty-two thousand</num>. 
<p>Some sailors having been ill-treated by women of the town, in a house near the new church in the Strand, a considerable body of them assembled, on the evening of the <datestruct VALUE="-07-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, armed with cutlasses and bludgeons, and proceeded to the house, where they destroyed all the furniture and wearing apparel, and turned the women into the street. On the following night, they attacked <num value="2">two</num> more houses in the same manner, and the <num value="3">third</num> day made a similar attempt upon <num value="1">one</num> in the Old Bailey, from which the owners had previously removed the goods, from an apprehension of their design. It was at last found necessary to call in the assistance of the military, to suppress these dangerous proceedings; and several of the rioters were apprehended and committed for trial. 
<p>This was followed by a circumstance, which proves that the firmness and temper of a civil magistrate may frequently render the interposition of the military unnecessary. <num value="15">Fifteen</num> criminals were ordered for execution on the <datestruct VALUE="-10-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, among whom was <num value="1">one</num> Bosavern Penlez, a young man, convicted of being concerned in the riot in the Strand. A rescue being apprehended in favour of <pb id="p.47" n="47"> Penlez, a party of foot guards attended at Holborn-bars to guard the prisoners to Tyburn; but Mr. sheriff Janssen, for the dignity of the city and his office, mounted on horseback, when the criminals were put into the carts at Newgate; and having provided a sufficient guard of the civil power, very genteelly dismissed the officer and his men at Holborn, and conducted the malefactors to the place of execution without their assistance. A great number of sailors, armed with bludgeons and cutlasses, attended at the gallows, and became very clamorous, from an apprehension that the body of Penlez would be delivered to the surgeons; but Mr. Janssen assuring them it should not, they were pacified, and the criminals were executed without the least obstruction. 
<p>About this time, a grant passed the great seal, wherein his majesty was pleased to re-incorporate, singular, all the freemen of the art of Butchers of the city of London, and all others who then used or exercised, or should thereafter use or exercise the art within the said city, the liberties and suburbs thereof, or in any place within <num value="2">two</num> miles from the said city, by the name of the master, wardens, and commonalty of the art or mystery of butchers. 
<p>This year finished with a remarkable cause tried in the lord mayor's court, between a club of journeymen free painters, plaintiffs, and Mr. Row, citizen and master painter, defendant, for employing a person not free to work for him in the city. The defendant pleaded, and made it appear by evidence, that, from the want of free journeymen of the trade, it was not possible for the summer business of the city to be done, without the assistance of at least an equal number of non-freemen; and that no freeman was ever refused, or could sometimes be got on any terms. To which the counsel for the plaintiffs replied, with a very learned argument upon a by-law, made by the city in the reign of queen Anne. The jury went out at <num value="2">two</num> o'clock in the afternoon, and returned twice without agreeing on their verdict; and being sent out again, and continuing a long time, the court ordered them to be locked up in the room, without fire, candle, or any sustenance, by an officer sworn to observe the same, and to attend them; in which situation they continued till <num value="6">six</num> o'clock next morning, when they brought in a verdict for the plaintiffs. 
<p>The masters of the several handicraft trades, finding themselves greatly aggrieved by this verdict, petitioned the common council for liberty to employ foreigners under certain restrictions. This produced a counter-petition from the journeymen; the consideration of which was deferred till the <datestruct VALUE="-02-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, when a committee of <num value="6">six</num> aldermen and <num value="10">ten</num> commoners met to adjust these disputes. At this meeting, a day was appointed for hearing deputations from the masters and journeymen, and after several adjournments, the committee reported their opinion to the court; who, on the <datestruct VALUE="-11-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, resolved, that the court of lord mayor and aldermen be empowered to grant permission to any <pb id="p.48" n="48"> freeman, who could not procure a sufficient number of free journeymen, to employ foreigners, provided he has <num value="1">one</num> apprentice, or has had <num value="1">one</num> within <num value="12">twelve</num> months before making application for the licence; and, in case no court of lord mayor and aldermen is held, the lord mayor may, on any Tuesday, grant such licence, for a term not exceeding <num value="6">six</num> weeks. A power is, however, reserved to the court of lord mayor and aldermen to revoke any licence, though the time for which it is granted be not expired. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1750-02-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>, between <num value="12">twelve</num> and <num value="1">one</num> o'clock at noon, a smart shock of an earthquake was felt through the cities of London and Westminster, and parts adjacent; and, on the <datestruct VALUE="-03-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, between <num value="5">five</num> and <num value="6">six</num> in the morning, the town was alarmed with another shock, much more violent, and of longer continuance than the <num value="1">first</num>. Many people, awakened from their sleep by it, ran terrified into the streets without their clothes; a great number of chimnies were thrown down; several houses were considerably damaged; and, in Charter-house-square, a woman was thrown from her bed, and her arm broke. The panic of the people, in consequence of these earthquakes was greatly increased by the ridiculous prediction of a wild enthusiastic soldier in the life-guards, who boldly prophesied that as the <num value="2">second</num> earthquake had happened exactly <num value="4">four</num> weeks after the <num value="1">first</num>, there would be a <num value="3">third</num>--exactly <num value="4">four</num> weeks after the <num value="2">second</num>, which would lay the whole cities of London and Westminster in ruins. Though this prognostication appears too ridiculous to merit the least attention, yet it produced a most astonishing effect on the credulous and already terrified people. A day or <num value="2">two</num> before the expected event, multitudes of the inhabitants abandoned their houses and retired into the country; the roads were thronged with carriages of persons of fashion; and the principal places within <num value="20">twenty</num> miles of London were so crowded, that lodgings were procured at a most extravagant price. 
<p>On the evening preceding the dreaded <datestruct VALUE="-08-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, most of those who stayed in the city sat up all night; some took refuge in boats on the river, and the fields adjacent to the metropolis were crowded with people; all of whom passed the night in fearful suspense, till the light of the morning put an end to their apprehensions, by convincing them, that the prophecy they had been weak enough to credit had no other basis than that of falsehood. 
<p>Although the predicted time was now elapsed, yet the terror of the people did not thoroughly abate till after the <num value="8">8th</num> day of the month, because the earthquakes had happened on the <num value="8">8th</num> day of the <num value="2">two</num> former months. When this time also passed, their fears vanished, and they returned to their respective habitations. The false prophet, who had been the instigator of such general confusion among the people, was committed to a place of confinement. 
<p>In this year,, the lord mayor, sir Samuel Pennant, some of the aldermen, <num value="2">two</num> of the judges, the under-sheriff, and many of the lawyers, who had attended the March sessions in the Old Bailey, <pb id="p.49" n="49"> most of the Middlesex jury, and a considerable number of the spectators, died of the gaol distemper, caught from the prisoners. In consequence of this disaster, a machine was soon after put upon the top of Newgate, to supply it with fresh air; the prison was well cleansed, and every other precaution taken to preserve the health of the prisoners. 
<p>In the beginning of the year <datestruct value="1751"><year reg="1751">1751</year></datestruct>, a cause was tried at Hicks'shall, between the tin-plate workers and <num value="1">one</num> Milton, whom they indicted upon the statute of queen Elizabeth, for exercising their art and mystery, not having served a regular apprenticeship to the same. The verdict was given for Milton, because the tin-plate workers were not incorporated till many years after the enacting that statute. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-10-22"><day reg="22">22nd</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, a cause was heard before the lord mayor and court of aldermen, about laying open the port of London for bringing in foreign oats, pursuant to a statute I James II. empowering that court, in April and October, to determine the common market prices of middling English corn, by the oaths of <num value="2">two</num> substantial persons of Middlesex and Surrey, being neither merchants, corn-factors, mealmen, nor factors for importing corn, nor interested in the corn, and each having a freehold estate of <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> pounds</measure>, or a leasehold estate of <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> pounds</measure> per annum, and by such other ways as to them shall seem fit; and if the same shall appear to be above <measure value="16s." type=currency><num value="16">sixteen</num> shillings</measure> a quarter, they are to certify the same, with the <num value="2">two</num> oaths annexed, to the commissioners of the customs, to be hung up in the custom-house. The persons that made the application were several masters of livery-stables, and inn-keepers, and their opponents were the corn-factors. After a hearing which lasted <num value="10">ten</num> hours, it was decided for the corn-factors; <num value="5">five</num> aldermen being for laying open the port, and <num value="5">five</num>, with the lord mayor, who threw in his casting vote, against it. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1752-03-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1752">1752</year></datestruct>, the city and places adjacent were attacked by a violent storm of wind, by which several stacks of chimnies were blown down, and in some places the roofs beat in, whereby many people were terribly bruised, and some lost their lives; great quantities of lead were blown off Chelsea hospital, the houses on London-bridge, &amp;c.; the head of Levi and the feet of Abraham in the fine window in Westminster-abbey were blown out, as were the windows in many places; in St. James's park, and the villages about the metropolis, great numbers of trees were demolished. On the river, ships were drove from their moorings, lighters and boats sunk, and several lives lost. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-06-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct> in the same year, Thomas Winterbottom, esq. lord mayor of London, died in his mayoralty, and was succeeded by Robert Alsop, esq. 
<p>A subject of an extraordinary nature occurred in the beginning of the year <datestruct value="1753"><year reg="1753">1753</year></datestruct>. A young woman, named Elizabeth Canning, pretended that, on the <datestruct VALUE="-01-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>, as she was returning home <pb id="p.50" n="50"> at night, she was attacked under Bedlam wall by <num value="2">two</num> men, who robbed her of part of her clothes, gagged her, and dragged her along to the house of an old woman called mother Wells, near Enfield-wash, where she was confined in a cold damp room for a month, without any sustenance but a few stale crusts of bread and about a gallon of water; but that having at last made her escape out of a window, she returned almost naked to her mother, who lived near Moorfields, 
<p>The story, notwithstanding its improbability, operated so powerfully on the passions of many, even of the best informed classes, that large subscriptions were raised for the prosecution of the supposed delinquents; and the mistress of the house at Enfield, her servant, and an old gypsey woman, named Mary Squires, whom Canning charged with having robbed her of her stays, were apprehended and tried. Wells was acquitted of the felony, but was punished as a bawd. Hall, the servant, being intimidated by the magistrate who examined her, turned evidence for Canning; and Squires, the gipsey, was convicted of the robbery, though she produced the most convincing evidence that she was at Abbotsbury, in Dorsetshire, on the night it was said to have been committed. During the course of the trial, Canning and her witnesses contradicted themselves in many particulars; but the prepossession in her favour was so great, that the most palpable falsehoods advanced by her and her adherents were admitted as incontrovertible truths; while the witnesses for Squires, were either so overawed by the rabble that they durst not appear in court, or, if they had sufficient resolution to give evidence in her favour, were insulted in such a manner that their lives were sometimes endangered. 
<p>Sir Crispe Gascoigne, who was at this time lord mayor of London, conducted himself in this affair with the greatest justice and impartiality. Considering the improbability of the charge, and the heat, passion, and furious zeal with which it was prosecuted, and being convinced of the old woman's innocence by a great number of affidavits, voluntarily sent up from the country by persons of undoubted veracity, he, in conjunction with some other worthy citizens, determined to oppose the torrent of popular prejudice. Application was made to the throne for mercy. The affair was referred to the attorney and solicitor-general, who, having examined the witnesses on both sides, made their report in favour of Squires, who was <num value="1">first</num> respited, and afterwards received his majesty's free pardon. 
<p>A bill of indictment was preferred by the lord mayor against Elizabeth Canning for perjury. Her friends did the like against the witnesses from Abbotsbury in favour of Squires. The Abbotsbury people appeared; but no evidence coming against them, they were acquitted. Canning, being admitted to bail, at <num value="1">first</num> absconded, but afterwards surrendered to take her trial, which continued by <pb id="p.51" n="51"> adjournment <num value="5">five</num> days; when she was convicted of perjury, and committed to Newgate. 
<p>When she was brought up to receive sentence, a new trial was moved for on the affidavit of <num value="2">two</num> of the jurors, who swore, that although they believed her guilty of perjury, they did not believe it to be wilful and corrupt. The decision of this point was put off till the next sessions; and on the <datestruct VALUE="1754-05-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct>, it was adjudged by <num value="5">five</num> judges, then on the bench, that the verdict was good and agreeable to evidence. After which, the court passed judgment that she should suffer <num value="1">one</num> month's imprisonment, and then be transported for <num value="7">seven</num> years. 
<p>Her supporters, however, made such diligent applications in her favour, that they obtained permission for her to transport herself, and she went to America, in a private ship, with every accommodation that money could procure her, and means were used to secure her a favourable reception at her arrival. 
<p>So truly sensible were the citizens of London of the rectitude of sir Crispe Gascoigne's conduct in this affair, that, at the expiration of his mayoralty, thanks were voted to him by the common council, <QUOTE>for his steady perseverance in the cause of justice, his generous protection of the distressed, and his remarkable humanity.</QUOTE> 
<p>Sir Crispe Gascoigne was succeeded in his office of lord mayor by Edmund Ironside, esq. who was so ill with the gout at the time of his being sworn into office, that he was obliged to be carried to the exchequer in a sedan chair, and died on the <datestruct VALUE="-11-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>. He was the <num value="5">fifth</num> lord mayor who died in his mayoralty from the year <datestruct value="1740"><year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct>; and it is remarkable that, from the institution of the office until that year, a period of <num value="551">five hundred and fifty one</num> years, such an event had only occurred <num value="6">six</num> times. 
<p>On the election for sheriffs, in the year <datestruct value="1754"><year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct>, George Streatfield and Alexander Sheafe, esquires, were chosen by a considerable majority, but being called upon to give bond to serve the office, they declined it, and gave answer to the court of aldermen by their attorneys, that, being protestant dissenters, they had not, within a year of the election, taken the sacrament, according to the rites of the church of England, and therefore dared not to take upon them that office in defiance of the act <num value="13">13</num> Car. II. stat. <num value="2">2</num>. cap. <num value="1">1</num>. In consequence of this, a common hall was summoned to choose other <num value="2">two</num>; who, choosing Allen Evans, a protestant dissenter, he likewise pleaded the same excuse. The court of common-council, therefore, on the <datestruct VALUE="-09-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>, ordered that actions should be brought against all those gentlemen, for the penalties incurred by their refusing to serve the office of sheriff; and a committee was appointed to see the said prosecutions executed. 
<p>A cause was tried in Michaelmas term, in the court of King's Bench, Guildhall, on an action brought by Mr. Richard Holland, a leather-seller in Newgate-street, against the collectors of toll in Smithfield, during the time of Bartholomew-fair; when Mr. <pb id="p.52" n="52"> Holland's witnesses were examined; but no person appearing on the other side, a verdict was given in favour of Mr. Holland, on <num value="15">fifteen</num> issues, with costs of suit. By which determination, all the citizens of London are exempted from paying toll at the said fair for the future. 
<p>In support of the ancient privilege of the citizens of London, to be exempt from toll for their goods throughout all England, Mr. Holland had also applied for and obtained a certificate from the lord mayor and court of aldermen, in the mayoralty of sir William Calvert, by which the privilege of exemption was not only allowed to him, but extended to every freeman of the city of London. 
<p>The public-spirited example of this gentleman was immediately followed by the freemen residing in the several markets of the city, who determined to oppose the oppressive demands of the farmers of them in exacting toll. In consequence of this determination, <num value="12">twelve</num> different actions were brought by the farmers of Newgate-market against the housekeepers around it, for refusing to pay the toll they had been accustomed to demand and receive; and in <datestruct VALUE="1754-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct>, <num value="1">one</num> of the issues was tried in the court of Common Pleas, at Guildhall, and the plaintiffs were non-suited; ever since which, the people have continued free and unmolested. 
<p>An act of parliament was passed on the <datestruct VALUE="1755-03-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1755">1755</year></datestruct>, to prevent the holding of a market in the Borough high-street; which was soon followed by another, on the petition of the inhabitants of Southwark, to hold a market on a spot of ground west of the high-street, called the Triangle. 
<p>At a court of common-council, held the <datestruct VALUE="-12-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, the petition for a new bridge at Blackfriars, which had been prepared by the committee appointed for that purpose, was agreed to by a majority of <num value="34">thirty-four</num>; and Mr. sheriff Whitehead was ordered to present the same to the house. This petition was accordingly presented on the <datestruct VALUE="-01-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct> following, and an act of parliament was soon after passed for that purpose. By this act, the lord mayor, aldermen, and common council were directed to form the said bridge in such a manner, as that there should remain a free and open passage for the water, through the arches, of <num value="750">seven hundred and fifty</num> feet at least, within the banks of the river; and that no buildings, except the proper gates and toll-houses, be erected thereon. The said mayor, &amp;c. were empowered to make, widen, and enlarge such streets, ways, and passages, as they should think necessary, to and from the said bridge, and to agree with the owners and occupiers of such lands, tenements or hereditaments, as they should think proper to be purchased, removed, or pulled down for that purpose. The act also provided, that a proper number of lamps be fixed on the said bridge, and a number of watchmen appointed for the safety of passengers. And, to defray the expences attending the completion of this undertaking, the mayor, &amp;c. were empowered, after the bridge should be finished, to appoint a toll, not <pb id="p.53" n="53"> exceeding a rate specified, and to borrow any sum not exceeding <measure value="30000l." type=currency><num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> pounds</measure> per annum, upon the credit of the tolls, until the whole sum of <measure value="160000l." type=currency><num value="160000">one hundred and sixty thousand</num> pounds</measure> be raised, to be applied to the purposes of this act. 
<p>The king having informed both houses of parliament that he had received repeated advices of the military preparations made in the various ports of France, and that there was great reason to suspect the French intended to invade England or Ireland, the lord mayor, aldermen, and common council presented an address to his majesty, on the <datestruct VALUE="-04-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, in which they assured him of their loyal affection, and their determined resolution to exert themselves to the utmost of their abilities, in support of his person and government. 
<p>The designs of the French were soon manifested by a descent upon Minorca; the intelligence of which no sooner arrived, than war was declared, on the <datestruct VALUE="-05-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, at the usual places, and with the accustomed ceremonies. 
<p>This period produced the institution of the Marine Society, by the voluntary association of several merchants and others; at the head of whom was Mr. Jonas Hanway, a gentleman ever active in schemes for the public good. 
<p>The general discontent of the people at the loss of Minorca was greatly increased by the ministry bringing in a number of Hanoverian troops, to protect and defend the country from the French; and produced an address to his majesty from the citizens of London, in which they represent the evils brought on the state by the negligence or incapacity of his ministers, and call for justice on the authors of them. Similar addresses were presented from most of the other corporations and counties in the kingdom. 
<p>His majesty, to convince the people how desirous he was of pursuing such measures as might be satisfactory to them, as well as consistent with the government of his kingdom, ordered the Hanoverian troops to withdraw to their own country, and admitted the expediency of a national militia. He likewise appointed the right honourable Henry Bilson Legge, chancellor of the exchequer; and, on the <datestruct VALUE="1756-12-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>, he dismissed Mr. Fox, and delivered the seals to the right honourable William Pitt, making him secretary of state and prime minister. These appointments gave the highest satisfaction, not only to the citizens of London, but to all those who were well-wishers to their country; and produced such measures as entirely restored the king to the confidence of his subjects. This event produced the militia bill, which is considered as a barrier of the people's liberty against ministerial power; and the interest of the nation became the touchstone of every measure proposed by the administration. 
<p>But this satisfactory state of affairs was of short duration; the administration, finding their unwise measures opposed by the <num value="2">two</num> favourites of the nation, and dreading their integrity, prevailed on <pb id="p.54" n="54"> his majesty to dismiss them from their places, which was done on the <datestruct VALUE="1757-04-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1757">1757</year></datestruct>. 
<p>This revolution was no sooner known, than the whole nation seemed to rise up as <num value="1">one</num> man in their favour, and the people took every means they could devise to testify their respect for them. The city of London led the way, and on the <datestruct VALUE="-04-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, in a court of common council, it was proposed, and unanimously agreed, to present each of them with the freedom of the city of London, in a gold box, of the value of <num value="100">one hundred</num> guineas. An act of parliament was passed in this year to regulate the fishery in the river Thames, and for the more speedy punishment of offenders, by which the lord mayor and aldermen are empowered to make rules and ordinances, from time to time, for the government of all persons concerned in that fishery. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1758-04-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct>, between the hours of <num value="10">ten</num> and <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock at night, a temporary wooden bridge, built for the convenience of carriages and foot passengers while London-bridge was widening and repairing, was entirely consumed by fire. 
<p>His majesty having been pleased to order that the colours taken from the French at Louisburg should be hung up in St. Paul's cathedral, they were escorted from Kensington to the west door of the church, with great military pomp, on the <datestruct VALUE="-09-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> day of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>; and on the <num value="16">16th</num>, the cannon and mortars taken at Cherburgh passed through the city in grand procession, and were deposited in the Tower of London. 
<p>In <datestruct VALUE="1759-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1759">1759</year></datestruct>, in pursuance of an act of common-council, a subscription was opened at Guildhall, for the purpose of distributing bounties of <num value="5">five</num> guineas each, to such persons as should enlist into his majesty's service; and, as a further inducement, it was resolved, that  <QUOTE>every person so entering, should be entitled to the freedom of the city at the expiration of <num value="3">three</num> years, or sooner, if the war should end before that time.</QUOTE>  The amount of the subscription raised was <num value="70391">7,0391</num>. <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">7</num>s.</measure> towards which <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num>l.</measure> was paid out of the chamber of London; and the number of recruits obtained by these means was <num value="1235">1,235</num>. Similar measures were pursued in the city of Westminster, and in the county of Middlesex. 
<p>The year <datestruct value="1760"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct> offers a memorable instance of the strict impartiality of the English laws. Earl Ferrers, from motives which never clearly appeared, had murdered his steward; for which he was tried and convicted before the house of lords, and received sentence of death; and, on the <datestruct VALUE="-05-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, he was hanged at Tyburn, and his body delivered to the surgeons to be anatomized. Neither the plea of insanity, nor his rank, nor his alliance with royalty, could produce the slightest deviation from that equal justice which is administered to all ranks; and he suffered the same punishment in the same place, as a murderer of the lowest class of the community. 
<p>Several plans having been presented to the committee appointed <pb id="p.55" n="55"> for managing the new bridge to be erected at Blackfriars, they at length gave the preference to Mr. Mylne, a Scotch architect; and the <num value="1">first</num> pile for the bridge was driven in the middle of the river on the <datestruct VALUE="1760-06-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>. 
<p>At a court of common council, held the <num value="17">17th</num> of the same month, the committee of the city lands were empowered to put in execution an act of parliament passed the last sessions, for widening and improving the several streets in the city; and, at the same time, they directed an opening to be made as soon as possible, from the east end of Crutched-friars into the Minories. 
<p>Among other regulations under the said act, it was thought proper to pull down the city gates; in consequence of which, the said committee sold Aldgate for <measure value="177l." type=currency><num value="177">one hundred and seventy-seven</num> pounds</measure>, <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure>; Cripplegate for <measure value="91l." type=currency><num value="91">ninety-one</num> pounds</measure>, and Ludgate for <measure value="148l." type=currency><num value="148">one hundred and forty-eight</num> pounds</measure>; to be pulled down and taken away by the purchaser, within a limited time. The statue of queen Elizabeth, which stood on the west side of Ludgate, was purchased by alderman Gosling, and set up against the east end of St. Dunstan's church, in Fleet-street. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-10-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, the lord mayor, aldermen, and common council again waited on his majesty with a congratulatory address, on the completion of the conquest of Canada, by the reduction of Montreal. But while the people were exulting in the success of the British arms, and mutual professions of loyalty, confidence, and protection appeared between the king and his subjects, particularly the citizens of London, a gloom was thrown over their happiness, by the sudden death of the king, through apoplexy, who expired on the morning of the <datestruct VALUE="-10-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, in the <num value="77">seventy-seventh</num> year of his age, and the <num value="34">thirty-fourth</num> of his reign. 
<div1 type=chapter id="c.3" n="3">

<HEAD>History of London from the Accession of George the <num value="3">Third</num>, to the year <datestruct value="1780"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>.</HEAD>
 
<p>Perhaps no prince ever received the reins of government under more happy circumstances, or amidst more universal applause from his subjects, than his late majesty. As soon as proper notice was given of the king's death, the privy council assembled, to give orders for proclaiming his successor; and next day the new sovereign was proclaimed, before Saville House, in Leicester-fields, in presence of the great officers of state, the nobility, the lord mayor and <pb id="p.56" n="56"> aldermen of the city of London, and a great number of persons of the <num value="1">first</num> distinction; and the proclamation was repeated at the usual places in the metropolis, with the accustomed ceremonies, amidst the acclamations of a vast concourse of spectators. 
<p>On the <hi rend=italics><num value="28">28th</num></hi>, the lord mayor and aldermen of London attended the king, at Leicester-house, with compliments of condolence and congratulation; an address was presented to him by the citizens, in their corporate capacity; as also another to the princess dowager of Wales, his mother. This example was followed by the merchants and traders of the city, the clergy of London and Westminster, and all the bodies politic and corporate in the <num value="3">three</num> kingdoms. 
<p>The lord mayor's day happening this year on a Sunday, sir Matthew Blackiston, the mayor elect, was not sworn into his office till the day following; when, on account of the recent death of the king, who was not yet interred, the usual ceremonies were omitted, and he went privately in his coach, attended by the aldermen, to be sworn into his office. 
<p>In the evening of the same day, the remains of his late majesty were removed from Kensington palace, where he died, to the prince's chamber, and there lay in state till the next night, when they were interred, with great funeral pomp, in the royal vault under Henry VIIth&lsquo;s chapel, in Westminster Abbey; his youngest son, the duke of Cumberland, attending as chief mourner. 
<p>About this time, <num value="2">two</num> causes were tried in the court of King's bench, Guildhall, respecting the right of the city to take toll for provisions exposed to sale before houses in the markets. They were tried before a jury of non-freemen; and the parties in the <num value="1">first</num> were, the citizens of London, plaintiffs, and Edward Smith and Ralph Twyford, salesmen, in Newgate market, defendants. The other parties were the same plaintiffs, and John Cope, a salesman, defendant, for the sale of provisions in White-hart-street, an avenue or passage leading to Newgate market. In each of these causes, the jury gave a verdict for the city; by which the citizens ultimately established their right to the tolls, not only in the markets, but also in the avenues or passages leading thereto. 
<p>At a court of common-council, held the <datestruct VALUE="1761-02-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>, a motion was made to present the freedom of the city to sir John Philips, bart. and George Cooke, esq. members for Middlesex, for their singular service in supporting such resolutions of the city as required the aid and authority of parliament. As there had not been any previous intimation given to the members, that such a question would be moved, it was considered by many, as a motion intended to be carried by surprise, and was opposed, by some, with great warmth, as an irregular proceeding; but, on the question being put, it was carried by <num value="38">38</num> against <num value="33">33</num>. The court, however, though they were not averse to the compliment bestowed on those gentlemen, determined to guard against any such hasty measure in <pb id="p.57" n="57"> future; and therefore unanimously resolved, that no person should have the freedom of the city presented to him, unless the motion was made at a court preceding that in which the question should be put. 
<p>Among the acts of parliament passed during this session, was <num value="1">one</num> for laying an additional duty on strong beer. Loud clamours were excited by this tax among the class of labouring people, especially in the metropolis, where some few publicans attempted to raise the price double the amount of the tax; but, as they did not act in concert, those houses in which the experiment was made, were immediately abandoned by their customers. The streets resounded with the noise of vulgar discontent, which did not even respect the young sovereign; and, if the price of strong beer had been actually raised to the consumer, in all probability some dangerous tumult would have ensued. 
<p>The business of the session being brought to a close, the parliament was dissolved on the <datestruct VALUE="-03-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, and writs were issued out for the election of a new <num value="1">one</num>. Previous to this, Arthur Onslow, esq. who had filled the chair of the house of commons with great abilities and dignity, signified his intention of retiring from that station, on which occasion, the house addressed his majesty, to confer some mark of his royal favour upon him, for his great and eminent services, for the space of <num value="33">thirty-three</num> years, and upwards; which the king complied with, by settling an annual pension of <measure value="3000l." type=currency><num value="3000">3,000</num>l.</measure> upon him, for his own life and that of his son. And the court of common-council, desirous of testifying their high sense of the merits of this venerable patriot, voted him the freedom of the city: which was presented to him in a gold box, of the value of <num value="100">one hundred</num> guineas. 
<p>A treaty of marriage having been concluded between his majesty and the princess Charlotte Sophia, of Mecklenburgh Strelitz, the nuptials were solemnized by the archbishop of Canterbury, on the <datestruct VALUE="1761-09-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>, in the presence of the royal family, and the principal part of the nobility. 
<p>The whole nation united in testifying their joy on this occasion; the amiable character of the princess promising future felicity both to her royal consort and his subjects. On the <num value="14">14th</num>, the lord mayor, aldermen, and common-council, presented their congratulations to the royal pair on their nuptials; as also to the princess dowager of Wales, which were graciously received by the royal parties. It was on this occasion that the common-council appeared in mazarine blue silk gowns, agreeable to an order of that court, made a short time before; which greatly contribute to heighten the solemnity and grandeur of their public appearance. 
<p>On the <num value="22">22nd</num>, his majesty's coronation was performed in the abbey church at Westminster, with the usual solemnities. Their majesties and the princess dowager went, in the morning, through the park, from St. James's, in chairs, and their attendants in coaches, to <pb id="p.58" n="58"> Westminster-hall, from thence they walked, about <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock, in grand procession, to the abbey. After the ceremony, which lasted <num value="6">six</num> hours, they returned to the hall, where they dined most magnificently, in the presence of numberless spectators richly dressed. All the way of the procession was lined with crowded scaffolds, and the abbey also was as full and splendid as possible. On the queen's entrance into the hall, <num value="3000">three thousand</num> wax tapers were all lighted in less than <num value="5">five</num> minutes. The royal standard was hoisted at the Tower, the ships in the river displayed their flags, the streets were universally illuminated, and there was an entire stagnation of all sorts of business. 
<p>A little before the procession began, proceeded that of her royal highness the princess dowager of Wales, from the house of lords, across Old Palace-yard, on a platform erected for that purpose, to the south-cross of Westminster abbey. She was led by the hand by his royal highness prince William Henry, dressed in white and silver. Her train, which was of silk, was but short, and her hair flowed down her shoulders in hanging curls. 
<p>The rest of the princes and princesses, her highness's children, followed in this order: 
<p>His royal highness prince Henry Frederick, also in white and silver, handing his sister, the princess Louisa Anne, dressed in a slip with hanging sleeves. Then his royal highness prince Frederick William, in the same dress, handing his youngest sister, the princess Caroline Matilda, dressed also in a slip with hanging sleeves. 
<p>The other persons who made up this procession were those who had not a right to walk with their majesties. 
<p>The procession was closed by <num value="3">three</num> Mahometan ambassadors, in the proper dresses of their country, having turbans of fine muslin on their heads, and long gowns of flowered and laced silk; their sabres were crimson, and in each of them were enclosed a dagger and poniard. 
<p>The great diamond in his majesty's crown fell out in returning from the abbey to Westminster-hall, but was immediately found and restored. 
<p>The nation in general, and the corporation of London in particular, being greatly discontented at the measures of the court, and particularly at the resignation of Mr. Pitt, whose conduct in administration they highly esteemed, the court of common-council, on the <num value="22">22</num>d of October, unanimously resolved to instruct the city members on the sense of the citizens respecting the present critical conjuncture. Accordingly, instructions were drawn up and delivered to the <num value="4">four</num> members; the principal articles in which were: to endeavour at a repeal or amendment of the late act for the relief of insolvent debtors, in respect of the inconveniences arising from the compulsive clause (which was accordingly done by stat. <num value="2">2</num> Geo. III. cap. <num value="2">2</num>). To promote all necessary measures for the establishing good economy in the distribution of the national treasure: to <pb id="p.59" n="59"> oppose all attempts for giving up such places as might tend to lessen our present security, restore the naval power of France, and expose us to fresh hostilities; particularly to preserve our sole and exclusive right to our acquisitions in North America, and its fisheries; and lastly, to concur in prosecuting the war with the utmost vigour, so as to obtain a safe and honourable peace. 
<p>At the same time another motion was made, that the thanks of the court be given to the right hon. Mr. Pitt, for the many and important services rendered to his king and country. And a <num value="3">third</num> motion was made, that the committee, in their thanks to Mr. Pitt, do lament his resignation, &amp;c. These motions, with the exception of the last, on which there was a division, <num value="19">one hundred and nine</num> being for it, and only <num value="15">fifteen</num> against it, were unanimously carried in the affirmative. 
<p>According to ancient custom, the lord mayor who is <num value="1">first</num> elected to that office after a coronation, invites the king and queen, if there is <num value="1">one</num> at the time, to dine at Guildhall on lord mayor's day. Sir Samuel Fludyer, being chosen to that office, had the honour of entertaining their majesties on this occasion. The ceremonial was conducted with the greatest magnificence, all ranks striving with each other to manifest their loyalty and attachment. The pageants and decorations were more pompous than had been on any former occasion; and the entertainment was elegant, sumptuous, and well-conducted. The whole expense was <measure value="6898l. 5s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="6898">6,898</num>l. <num value="5">5</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> His majesty and all the royal family expressed their entire approbation of it; and the nobility and foreign ministers acknowledged it to have been far beyond any they had ever seen. 
<p>In the beginning of the year <datestruct value="1762"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>, the inhabitants of London and Westminster were alarmed by an imposture of a singular nature, carried on in the house of <num value="1">one</num> Parsons, clerk of the parish of St. Sepulchre, and resident in Cock-lane, West Smithfield. His daughter, a girl of <num value="10">ten</num> years of age, being tutored for the purpose, pretended to be visited by the spirit of a young woman who had formerly lived in the house, and had died about a year and a half before this period. This woman, who went by the name of Fanny, had lived with a Mr. Kent, a broker, who had been the husband of her sister, and would willingly have taken Fanny to wife, but this union being forbidden by the canon law, the parties agreed to dispense with the ceremonies of the church, and lived together until, to the great grief of her lover, she died of the small pox. Kent, it seems, had incurred the resentment of Parsons by pressing him for the payment of some money he had lent him: and this is supposed to have been the source of this diabolical contrivance. His daughter, who had been a favourite of Fanny's, pretended to see her spirit; she was seized with apparent fits and tremblings, strange noises of knocking, scratching, whispering, fluttering, &amp;c. were heard in the presence of the girl; and a woman who lived in the house and was an accomplice in the scheme, pretended to explain these different <pb id="p.60" n="60"> noises, all of which tended to show that she had been poisoned by her admirer. The circumstances of this strange visitation being reported, with many idle exaggerations, interested the public to such a degree, that nothing was talked of in all assemblies, from the highest to the lowest, but the Cock-lane ghost; to which there was a continual flux and reflux of people of all ranks: even some of the dignitaries of the church lent a countenance to the fraud by joining in the superstitious throng who daily flocked to hear it. To such a height did this silly infatuation at length arrive, that all the suggestions of reason proved ineffectual to stop it: the most glaring inconsistencies were reconciled in support of the supernatural visitation, while the unfortunate object of it was universally detested as an infamous murderer; who having robbed a poor girl of her innocence, and become satiated with her person, had consigned her to an untimely end. In vain he published the affidavits of the physician and apothecary, who attended her in her last illness; in vain he availed himself of the testimony of those who were with her in her last moments, and saw the tender parting between her and the man whom her spirit was now supposed to impeach. The more pains he took in his own justification, the more deeply were the people impressed with the conviction of his guilt. Under this dreadful persecution, he had recourse to the protection of the law, by commencing a suit against the father of the child, an ecclesiastic who had been very instrumental in promoting the imposture, and some others who had been more or less active in ruining his reputation and fortune. They were indicted for a conspiracy, and tried before lord chief justice Mansfield, who resisted an attempt that was made to prove that the visitation was supernatural. He treated such a supposition with the contempt it deserved, and pronounced the whole to be an infamous imposture, contrived and carried on to effect the ruin of an innocent person; and the jury before whom it was tried convicted all the parties of the conspiracy. Parsons was condemned to stand in the pillory <num value="3">three</num> times in <num value="1">one</num> month, and to be imprisoned for <num value="2">two</num> years; his wife was imprisoned for <num value="1">one</num> year, the woman who acted as interpreter was committed to Bridewell, to be kept to hard labour for <num value="6">six</num> months, and the clergyman and another person who had been active in the transaction were dismissed with a severe reprimand, after having compromised the affair with the prosecutor, to whom they paid a considerable sum of money, as a reparation for the injury he had sustained. 
<p>In this session of parliament an act was passed for new paving the streets, and removing the posts and signs that had long been a blemish to the principal parts of this metropolis. The pavement, before, was exceedingly inconvenient, as well to foot passengers as those who were obliged to travel in the highway; but by virtue of this act, they were both altered, and the principal parts of the cities of London and Westminster were paved in the elegant as well as convenient manner in which they now appear. <pb id="p.61" n="61"> A scheme had been projected to reduce the price of fish, by bringing it from distant ports to London and Westminster by land carriage. This scheme being laid before the parliament, an act was obtained for carrying it into execution; but, after having tried it for some years, the expenses were found to exceed the produce so greatly, that it was discontinued. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-07-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct> came on at Guildhall, a cause which had been long depending between the city and the dissenters, concerning the eligibility and obligation of the latter to serve the office of sheriff; when, after several learned pleadings, the judges gave their opinion, that dissenters were not obliged to serve that office. This determination was afterwards confirmed by the house of lords. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1762-08-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>, about <num value="7">seven</num> o'clock in the morning, her majesty was safely delivered of a prince, which event was immediately announced by a discharge of the Tower guns. Soon after her majesty was delivered, the waggons loaded with the treasure of the Hermione (a Spanish register ship, taken by the Active and Favourite, <num value="2">two</num> English frigates) entered St. James's-street, in their way to the Tower; on which his majesty and the nobility went to the windows over the palace-gate to see them, and joined their acclamations on <num value="2">two</num> such joyful events. The waggons, <num value="20">twenty</num> in number, were preceded by a company of light horse, with kettle drums, trumpets, French horns, and hautboys. Each waggon was escorted by <num value="4">four</num> marines, with bayonets fixed, and decorated with Spanish colours beneath those of England. The treasure was conveyed to the Bank, and was estimated at <num value="2">two</num> millions <num value="276716">two hundred and seventy-six thousand seven hundred and sixteen</num> dollars, besides other valuable effects. 
<p>On the <num value="14">14th</num>, the lord mayor, aldermen, and common council, waited on his majesty with a congratulatory address on the birth of a prince, who, on the <num value="17">17th</num>, was created prince of Wales, &amp;c. and on the <datestruct VALUE="-09-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct> following, was baptized by the name of George Augustus Frederic. 
<p>The negociations for peace, which had been some time in hand, having been brought to an issue, the secretary of state sent, on the <datestruct VALUE="-11-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, to inform the lord mayor, that the preliminaries of pacification were signed on the <num value="3">3</num>d instant; in consequence of which, a cessation of arms was proclaimed at London, on the <datestruct VALUE="-12-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>; and, on the <num value="22">22</num>d of <datestruct VALUE="1763-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1763">1763</year></datestruct>, the definitive treaty, which had been signed at Paris on the <datestruct VALUE="-02-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, was proclaimed at the usual places in London; but so dissatisfied were the citizens with the terms of it, that the common council could not be prevailed on to address; and that which was obtained from the aldermen, was carried up by <num value="8">eight</num> of that body, with a <foreign lang=la>locum tenens</foreign>
 at their head. 
<p>There being a bill at this time depending in the house, not only for granting additional duties on wine, cyder, and perry, but also to subject the makers of those articles to the excise laws, the court <pb id="p.62" n="62"> of common council, on the very day that peace was proclaimed, resolved to petition the house of commons against it; and the next day they prepared instructions for their members to oppose this new attempt, <QUOTE>as being inconsistent with those principles of liberty which had hitherto distinguished this nation from arbitrary governments.</QUOTE> In short, so strenuously did the citizens exert themselves to crush this destructive bill, that, on the <datestruct VALUE="-03-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, they petitioned each branch of the legislature, separately, against it; notwithstanding which, it passed into a law. The bill, however, was found to be productive of such universal disturbance, not only in the cyder counties, but also throughout the kingdom, that it was <num value="1">first</num> altered, and afterwards repealed. 
<p>We come now to an event, which, whatever heat and party rancour it might have generated at the time, was productive of the genuine spirit of British liberty. 
<p>Through various concurrent circumstances, and the anti-liberal conduct of the administration, the metropolis at this period was in a complete ferment; the members of the cabinet were lampooned and assailed with political publications, couched in strong terms of reprehension; to counteract the effects which these might produce, a periodical pamphlet, denominated  <QUOTE> The Briton,</QUOTE>  was published, under the patronage of government. This was answered by another periodical paper, called  <QUOTE> The North Briton,</QUOTE>  in allusion to the earl of Bute, who had supplanted and succeeded Mr. Pitt. The writers of the North Briton, the principal of whom was the celebrated John Wilkes, esq. M.P. for Aylesbury, were composed of those characters who considered the then administration to be wholly unworthy of the public confidence, and were therefore determined to expose its measures and their authors to the ignominy and contempt which they deserved. The <num value="45">forty-fifth</num> number of the North Briton contained such severe reflections upon the king's closing speech to the parliament in April, that the ministry, who had been sedulously lying in wait for a fit opportunity to crush their avowed enemy, thought that the time was now arrived; and Mr. Wilkes was apprehended on the <datestruct VALUE="-04-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, under an illegal warrant, signed by the principal secretary of state. Application was immediately made to the court of Common Pleas, and a writ of 
<foreign lang=la>Habeas Corpus</foreign> obtained; yet, in despite of this, Mr. Wilkes was committed to the Tower, where he continued till the <datestruct VALUE="-05-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, when his case having been solemnly argued before that firm friend to constitutional liberty, lord chief justice Pratt, the court directed him to be discharged.<NOTE>Mr. Wilkes afterwards brought an action against Robert Wood, esq. under secretary of state, for illegally seizing his papers, &amp;c. and obtained <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1000</num>l.</measure> damages, with full costs of suit.</NOTE>
 
<p>A dreadful calamity happened on Tower-hill on his majesty's birth-day, <datestruct VALUE="1763-06-4"><month reg="06">June</month> the <day reg=4>4th</day>, <year reg=1763>1763</year></datestruct>. It was usual at that time to exhibit fireworks in honour of the occasion, a practice, however, which was <pb id="p.63" n="63"> discontinued during the American war. The concourse of people that assembled to view the fireworks this year was so great, that a railing which surrounded the postern well gave way, and many fell down a precipice <num value="30">thirty</num> feet in depth; <num value="6">six</num> were instantly killed, <num value="14">fourteen</num> died of their wounds, and a vast number were bruised and maimed. 
<p>Shortly after Mr. Wilkes was released from the Tower, he established a printing press in his own house, situated in Great George-street, Westminster, and republished all the numbers of the obnoxious paper. This provoked the ministry so highly, that an information was filed against him in the court of King's Bench, at his majesty's suit; and in the house of commons,  <QUOTE> The North Briton, No. <num value="45">45</num>,</QUOTE>  was voted to be  <QUOTE> a most seditious and dangerous libel,</QUOTE>  and ordered  <QUOTE>to be burnt by the hands of the common hangman.</QUOTE>  When the appointed officers attended at the Royal Exchange to execute this order, they were violently assailed by the populace, and dispersed in different directions; and the glass of Mr. Sheriff Harley's chariot was broken by <num value="1">one</num> of the billets snatched from the fire. The pieces of the  <QUOTE> libel,</QUOTE>  which the assailants snatched from the flames, were carried away in triumph, and in the evening were displayed at Temple-bar, at which place a bonfire was made to consume a large Jack-boot, as it was called, in allusion to the prime minister. This riot being reported to the <num value="2">two</num> houses of parliament, they entered very seriously into the consideration of its consequences; and, after Mr. Alderman Harley had been examined by the lords, resolved, <QUOTE>that the rioters were perturbators of the public peace, dangerous to the liberties of the country, and obstructors of the national justice.</QUOTE> At the same time, the <num value="2">two</num> sheriffs received the thanks of both houses. 
<p>Some time afterwards Mr. Wilkes retired to France, to avoid the persecution which threatened him. For this conduct, which the house of commons adjudged to be  <QUOTE> a contempt of their authority,</QUOTE>  he was expelled on the <datestruct VALUE="1764-01-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1764">1764</year></datestruct>; in the following month, his trial, notwithstanding his absence, was brought on before lord chief justice Mansfield, in the court of King's Bench, where he was found guilty of re-publishing the libellous paper, and was subsequently outlawed. 
<p>The benevolence of the inhabitants of London was strongly excited in the course of this year, by the distresses of about <num value="800">eight hundred</num> Palatines and Wurtzburghers, men, women, and children, who had been deluded from their native homes by a German adventurer named Stumple, to form a settlement in the islands of St. John and Le Croix, in America. After they had been shipped for England, Stumple abandoned them, and they arrived in the port of London during the month of August, in the most deplorable condition, and in imminent danger of perishing for want. About <num value="600">six hundred</num>, who were able to discharge their passage, were permitted to come on shore, and they retired to the fields in the <pb id="p.64" n="64"> neighbourhood of Stepney and Bow, where they continued some days without the least shelter, and wholly destitute of the common necessaries of life: the situation of those on ship-board was almost equally deplorable. 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> intimation which the public received of the wretched state of these poor fugitives, was through the generous act of a baker, who, passing along the road, near Bow, where the distressed Germans were languishing for food, and perceiving their forlorn condition, threw his basket from his shoulder, and distributed its contents (<num value="28">twenty-eight</num> <num value="2">two</num>-penny loaves) among them, for no other return than  <QUOTE> signs of gratitude and tears of joy ;</QUOTE>  observing, whilst thus employed, that <QUOTE>his customers must fast a little longer that day.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Malc. Anec. &amp;c. of Lon. p. <num value="39">39</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>For several days afterwards the only assistance these poor people received <QUOTE>was what could be gathered from the different German churches and chapels about the metropolis; but this was far from being sufficient to relieve so great a number. At length, the Rev. Mr. Wachsel, minister of the German Lutheran church in Ayliffe-street, Goodman's fields, laid their case before the public in the newspapers, in so true and affecting a manner, that it immediately attracted the attention, not only of the great, but also of royalty itself. Before <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock on the same day, <num value="100">one hundred</num> tents were sent them from the Tower, by order of his majesty; the passage of those who were detained in the ship was defrayed, and <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">300</num>l.</measure> was sent for their immediate support. Subscriptions were opened, and considerable sums of money gathered for their relief. Physicians, surgeons, and midwives, offered their service for the sick and those in travail, for the latter of whom proper apartments were hired.</QUOTE> <NOTE>To what a dreadful situation the poor sufferers had been reduced, may be estimated from the following passage in the <num value="1">first</num> letter which Mr. Wachsel addressed to the public:-- <QUOTE>That their distresses were unutterably great, I myself have been too often a mournful witness, in my attendance on them to administer the duties of my situation: with <num value="1">one</num> instance of which I shall conclude this melancholy detail. <num value="1">One</num> of the poor women was seized with the pangs of labour in the open fields, and was delivered by the ignorant people about her in the best manner they were able; but from the injury the tender infant received in the operation, it died soon after I had baptized it; and the wretched mother, after receiving the sacrament at my hands, expired from the want of proper care and necessaries suitable to her afflicting and truly lamentable condition.</QUOTE> </NOTE> The means of immediate subsistence having been thus obtained, a plan was suggested for their permanent settlement in South Carolina; whither they were sent towards the end of the following year, with every thing necessary for their accommodation during their voyage, and proper requisites for their comfortable establishment on their arrival. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1765-02-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, Mr. John Williams, bookseller, in Fleet-street, stood on the pillory, in New Palace-yard, <pb id="p.65" n="65"> Westminster, for republishing the North Briton in volumes. A few minutes after <num value="12">twelve</num> he mounted the stage, amidst the acclamations of more than <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> people, who preserved an incessant shout during the whole time of his standing. The intention of the ignominy was greatly defeated by the populace, who testified their resentment by displaying a burlesque exhibition of a very singular, but intelligible, nature. They suspended, near the pillory, a large jack-boot, a Scots bonnet, and an axe : which having hung for some time, they chopped off the top of the boot, and, with great triumph, committed that and the bonnet to the flames : a fire having been prepared for that purpose.<NOTE><BIBL>Lambert's London, ii. p. <num value="202">202</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>In <datestruct VALUE="1765-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, considerable confusion was excited in London by the Spitalfields weavers, many thousands of whom had been thrown out of employ through the introduction of French manufactured silks, and were now with their wives and families in great distress. A petition, which they had presented to the parliament, not having been attended to as they wished, they assembled before Bedford house, in Bloomsbury-square, and denounced vengeance against the duke of Bedford, by whom they supposed the relief they petitioned for had been obstructed. Whatever mischief they had purposed, was this time prevented by a party of the military ; yet on the next day they again assembled in still greater numbers, and committed various outrages. Bedford house was much damaged, and others threatened: but the exertions of the magistrates, aided by the soldiery, and the assurances of the master weavers that the importation of French silks should be discontinued, prevented any further disorders. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-11-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, a dreadful fire broke out about <num value="3">three</num> o'clock in the morning, at the house of a peruke-maker, named Rutland, in Bishopsgate-street, adjoining to the corner of Leadenhall street. The flames quickly spread to the corner house, and, the wind being high, from thence soon communicated to the opposite corners; so that the <num value="4">four</num> were on fire at the same time, and <num value="3">three</num> of them were totally destroyed. All the houses from Cornhill to the church of St. Martin Outwich, in Bishopsgate-street, were burnt down, and the church and parsonage-house considerably damaged, as well as the back part of Merchant Taylor's hall, and various houses in Threadneedle-street. The White Lion tavern, which had been purchased only on the preceding evening for <measure value="3000l." type=currency><num value="3000">3000</num>l.</measure>, and all the houses in White Lion-court, were entirely consumed, together with <num value="5">five</num> houses in Cornhill, and several others in Leadenhall-street. Several lives were lost, not only by the fire, but by the falling of chimnies and walls; and on the following day <num value="8">eight</num> persons were killed, and some others had their limbs broken, by the sudden fall of a stack of chimnies. By <pb id="p.66" n="66"> this accident nearly <num value="100">one hundred</num> houses were destroyed or greatly damaged.<NOTE> <QUOTE>A gentleman who ventured among the ruins next day, thinking that some persons might still be among the rubbish, waved his hat to engage the attention of the spectators, and declared that he was sure many were actually under the spot on which he stood. Upon this the firemen went immediately to work with their pick-axes, and on removing the rubbish, they drew out alive <num value="2">two</num> men, <num value="3">three</num> women, a child about <num value="6">six</num> years old, <num value="2">two</num> cats, and a dog.</QUOTE> </NOTE>
 
<p>The beginnings of the years <datestruct value="1767--"><year reg=1767>1767</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1768--"><year reg=1768>1768</year></datestruct> were both distinguished by a very severe frost, through which the price of provisions was greatly enhanced. The navigation of the river Thames was stopped, and the river below bridge had all the appearance of a general wreck ; ships, boats, and small craft, lying in confusion amidst the ice, whilst others were either driven on shore or sunk by the driving shoals. Many persons perished by the severity of the weather both on the water and on shore. During the latter frost the price of butcher's meat grew so exorbitant, that the Hon. Thomas Harley, lord mayor, proposed that bounties should be given for bringing fish to Billingsgate market; and 
<hi rend=italics>this plan having been carried into effect, the distresses</hi> of the poor were greatly alleviated, by the cheap rates <hi rend=italics>at which the</hi>
 markets were supplied. 
<p>The beginning of the year <datestruct value="1768"><year reg="1768">1768</year></datestruct> was also the commencement of an era of discontent and political violence. At the election for representatives of the city of London, in March, Mr. Wilkes suddenly arrived from France, appeared on the hustings at Guildhall, and declared himself a candidate. Popular indignation having now a shrewd and bold chieftain, assumed an alarming extent of opposition to government, and though Mr. Wilkes was the last on the poll for London, he was the <num value="1">first</num> on that for the county of Middlesex; on this success his partizans committed the most extravagant outrages, and not satisfied with having destroyed the windows of such of the nobility and gentry as they deemed obnoxious to them, they also exercised their spleen in demolishing the windows, glass chandeliers, and other parts of the furniture of the Mansion-house. 
<p>In conformity to a promise given by Mr. Wilkes on his return, he made his appearance in the court of King's-bench on the <datestruct VALUE="-04-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>; but as his surrender in that manner was irregular, and not in compliance with any process issuing out of that court, the judges declined taking any cognizance of it, on which he retired. On the <num value="27">27th</num> he was taken into custody by a writ of <foreign lang=la>capias ut lagatum</foreign>, and was brought up, under a <foreign lang=la>Habeas Corpus</foreign>, to be bailed; but the court being of opinion that no person is intitled to be bailed after conviction, he was ordered to be conveyed to the King's-bench prison; but, in his way thither, <pb id="p.67" n="67"> the mob stopped the coach on Westminster-bridge, took off the horses, and drew it along the Strand, Fleet-street, &amp;c. to Spitalfields. Here they turned the <num value="2">two</num> tip-staves out of the coach, and would have treated them indecently had it not been for Mr. Wilkes, who successfully exerted his influence in their favour. They then drew the coach to the <num value="3">Three</num> Tuns tavern, where Mr. Wilkes got out, and from an upper window earnestly entreated them to retire, which they accordingly did; and when they dispersed he went privately and delivered himself to the marshal of the King's-bench prison. 
<p>The next day the prison was surrounded by a prodigious number of people, who, it was expected, would have committed some outrage; but no disturbance happened till night, when they pulled up the rails that enclosed the footway, with which they made a bonfire, and obliged the inhabitants of the Borough to illuminate their houses; but a captain's guard of <num value="100">one hundred</num> men arriving about <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock, they all dispersed. 
<p>The discontent of the populace at this time was considerably increased by the excessive price of provisions; on which account, many disturbances happened that were attended with the most disagreeable consequences. A large body of coal-heavers went on board the colliers in the river, and obliged the men immediately to quit their work. They complained of the ill usage practised by their employers, who they said curtailed their wages, and, instead of paying them with money, only gave them liquor and goods of a bad quality; and that these undertakers got fortunes, while they, who did the work, were starving. This tumult was productive of much mischief, for the rioters meeting with a strong opposition, the fray became so desperate that several lives were lost, and others were so maimed as to be ever after incapable of executing their business. 
<p>The sailors belonging to the outward bound vessels in the river, imbibed the contagion, and refused to proceed on their voyages without an increase of wages. On the <num value="2">2</num>d of May great numbers of them assembled in Stepney-fields and Deptford, from whence they proceeded, in a riotous manner, and boarded those ships in the river that were preparing to sail; they unrigged the vessels and forced away the men, declaring, that no ships should sail before the merchants had agreed to advance their wages. On the <num value="7">7th</num> they again assembled in St. George's fields, from whence they proceeded to St. James's palace with colours and music before them, and presented a petition to the king, setting forth their grievances, and praying relief. 
<p>But the event which created the strongest sensation at this time, was the following :--In the afternoon of the <datestruct VALUE="-05-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, a great body of people assembled about the King's-bench prison, in expectation that Mr. Wilkes was to go from thence to the 
<p>F<num value="2">2</num> <pb id="p.68" n="68"> parliament house (it being the <num value="1">first</num> day of opening the new parliament,) and designing to convey him thither. They demanded him at the prison, and grew very tumultuous; whereupon the Riot Act was begun to be read, but the populace threw stones and brick-bats while it was reading, when William Allen, son of Mr. Allen, master of the Horse-shoe-inn, in Blackman-street, Southwark, being singled out, was pursued by the soldiers, and shot dead on the spot. Soon after this, the crowd increasing, an additional number of the guards was sent for, who marched thither, and also a party of horse-grenadiers; when, the riot continuing, the mob was fired upon by the soldiers, and <num value="5">five</num> were killed on the spot, and about <num value="15">fifteen</num> wounded. <num value="2">Two</num> women were among the wounded, <num value="1">one</num> of whom afterwards died in St. Thomas's Hospital. The next day an inquisition was taken by the coroner for Surrey, on the body of the above William Allen, when a verdict was given by the jury that Donald Maclane was guilty of wilful murder, and Donald Maclaury, and Alexander Murray, the commanding officer, were aiding and abetting therein. This inquest was held at the house of Mr. Allen; and it appeared on the examination, that the deceased was only a spectator, and, on seeing some persons run, he ran also, but was unhappily mistaken, and followed by the soldiers <num value="500">five hundred</num> yards, into a cow-house, where he was shot. Donald Maclane was committed to prison for the murder, but his associates were admitted to bail. <num value="2">Two</num> inquisitions were afterwards taken in the Borough, on persons killed by the soldiers in quelling the above riot; <num value="1">one</num> on the body of Mary Jeffs, who, having a basket of oranges to sell, was shot dead in removing them; the other on William Bridgeman, who was shot on the top of a hay cart, as he was looking at the fray at a distance; on both these inquisitions, the jury brought in their verdict chance medley. It appeared by the evidence, that, on the justices taking down a paper that had been fixed against a wall of the prison, the mob grew riotous, and cried Out, <QUOTE>give us the paper ;</QUOTE> which the justices not regarding, stones began to be thrown, and the cry  <QUOTE>give us the paper</QUOTE>  grew louder; the drums beat to arms; the proclamation was read; the justices were pelted who read it; great pains were taken to persuade the people to disperse; the horse-guards were sent for, and it was not till the last extremity that the soldiers received orders to fire. Maclane was afterwards tried at the Surrey assizes held at Guildford, and acquitted. 
<p>The next day, the mob assembled before the house of Edward Russel, esq. distiller, in the Borough, broke open the door, staved some casks of liquor, drank it immoderately, and began pulling down the house; but the military interposing, some of the most intoxicated were seized, and the rest made their escape. At the same time the front of the house of Richard Capel, esq. in Bermondsey, was demolished, and Mr. Capel himself wounded. <pb id="p.69" n="69"> These outrages were occasioned by the activity of the above <num value="2">two</num> gentlemen, in suppressing the tumults in St. George's Fields. 
<p>The same day, upwards of <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> sailors went through the city to petition the parliament for an augmentation of their wages. When they were in Palace-yard, they were addressed by <num value="2">two</num> gentlemen, mounted on the roof of a hackney coach, and were told that they could receive no immediate answer to their petition, but that it would be considered in due time; on which they gave <num value="3">three</num> cheers and dispersed. Their chiefs afterwards waited on a committee of merchants, and matters were accommodated to their general satisfaction. 
<p>A very considerable body of coal-heavers assembled in Stepney-fields, and proceeded from thence to all the coal-wharfs from Shadwell to Essex-stairs, carrying with them a writing which they presented to the masters of the wharfs to sign, signifying their consent to raise their wages; which having accomplished, they next day waited on the lord mayor, at the Mansion-house, to obtain a confirmation of this agreement; but his lordship thought proper to decline intermeddling with their affairs. 
<p>A terrible fray happened on the <num value="25">25th</num>, between the coal-heavers and sailors belonging to the colliers in the river, in which many were killed. The sailors, having been long detained in the river by the coal-heavers refusing to work, had begun to deliver their ships themselves; upon which, a body of coal-heavers fell upon some of the sailors by surprise, and killed several of them. The sailors took the alarm, the quarrel became general, and the consequences were the loss of many lives. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-06-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, another fray happened in Stepney-fields, between the same parties, when several of the sailors were killed. The coal-heavers marched off in triumph, with colours flying, drums beating, &amp;c. offering <num value="5">five</num> guineas for a sailor's head. The ships below bridge were obliged to keep constant watch day and night; and to so great a height was this insurrection got, that the inhabitants of Wapping were perpetually under the most dreadful apprehensions. A party of guards constantly attended for some days, during which several disturbances arose, and many coal-heavers were taken up by the soldiery and carried before sir John Fielding, who, on examination, committed them to Newgate. <num value="2">Two</num> of them were afterwards tried at the Old Bailey, for the murder of <num value="1">one</num> Battie, a seaman, and being convicted, were executed at Tyburn. <num value="7">Seven</num> others were also executed in the Suntavern-fields (near where the riot was committed) for shooting at Mr. Green, the master of the Roundabout-tavern in Shadwell. These examples produced the wished--for effect; the tumults immediately ceased, and peace and industry were happily restored. 
<p>The king of Denmark being on a visit to his majesty, the citizens of London were desirous of showing their respect to him ; <pb id="p.70" n="70"> in consequence of which, it was resolved, in a court of common-council, to invite him to an entertainment at the Mansion-house, which being accepted, the <num value="23">23</num>d of September was the day appointed for receiving the royal guest, who intimated his desire of coming to the city by water. 
<p>In consequence of this a committee was chosen to conduct the entertainment, who were empowered to draw on the chamberlain for money to defray the expenses. On the appointed day, the city barge, attended by the companies' barges, proceeded to New-palace-yard, where the king embarked; and, in order to give him a more extensive view of the banks of the river, a circuit was made as high as Lambeth, and then down to the Steel-yard, after which, they returned to the Temple-stairs, and, on landing, were conducted to the Middle Temple Hall, where an elegant collation was prepared by the benchers of the <num value="2">two</num> societies. 
<p>From the Temple, his majesty was conducted to the Mansion-house in the city state coach, followed by the noblemen of his suite, and the aldermen and sheriffs in their carriages; on alighting, he was received by the committee appointed to manage the entertainment, in their mazarine gowns; and, being conducted into the great parlour, received the compliments of the city, to which his majesty returned a very polite answer. The dinner, which was exceedingly magnificent, was served in the Egyptian-hall; the galleries of which were filled with the ladies of the common-councilmen, elegantly attired, and an excellent band of music was stationed in an orchestra erected for the occasion. His majesty took leave of the corporation about <num value="8">eight</num> o'clock, having expressed his highest satisfaction at the elegance of the entertainment. And, at a court of common-council, held on the <datestruct VALUE="-10-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, the freedom of the city was unanimously voted to the king of Denmark, to be presented in a golden box of <num value="200">two hundred</num> guineas value. His majesty was admitted into the Grocers' company, and his freedom being afterwards given to his ambassador here, was by him transmitted to Copenhagen. 
<p>The death of George Cook, esq. having occasioned a vacancy for Middlesex, sir W. B. Proctor, who had been the unsuccessful candidate at the former election, and serjeant Glynn, Mr. Wilkes's leading council, were put in nomination on the <datestruct VALUE="-12-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>. The poll proceeded quietly till the afternoon, when a mob broke into the hustings, attempted to seize the poll-books, and put an entire stop to the election. Many persons were considerably hurt in the scuffle, and the remainder of the day was a scene of confusion. The poll was again proceeded in on the <num value="13">13th</num>, and, on the following day, terminated in favour of serjeant Glynn. 
<p>George Clarke, an attorney's clerk in Mary-le-bone, who had received a severe blow on the head at Brentford, on the day of the riot, died soon after, and an inquest was held on his body before the coroner for the county of Middlesex and a very respectable jury of <pb id="p.71" n="71"> neighbours, who brought in a verdict of wilful murder by some person or persons unknown. Soon after this, <num value="2">two</num> Irish chairmen were apprehended and tried for the murder; and it being proved that they had been hired for the purpose of creating a riot, and been very instrumental in it, they were both convicted; but were afterwards pardoned on an opinion of the master, wardens, and examiners of the company of surgeons, who agreed unanimously that the blow was not the cause of Mr. Clarke's death. 
<p>The last public transaction of the year <datestruct value="1768"><year reg="1768">1768</year></datestruct> was the institution of the Royal Academy of Arts, which was established on the <datestruct VALUE="-12-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, under the immediate patronage of his majesty. This society was <num value="1">first</num> held in a large house in Pall Mall ; after which, the king granted them apartments in Somerset-house. 
<p>At this period, the citizens of London eagerly seized every opportunity of showing their attachment to Mr. Wilkes. On the <datestruct VALUE="1769-01-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1769">1769</year></datestruct>, the election for alderman of the ward of Farringdon Without, came on at St. Bride's church; the candidates were Mr. Wilkes and Mr. Bromwich: but on the close of the <num value="1">first</num> day's poll, the disparity of numbers was so great, that the latter gentleman declined the contest, and the lord mayor declared Mr. Wilkes duly elected. Some doubts, however, were started respecting the legality of closing the books before the time appointed for that purpose, and a <num value="2">second</num> wardmote was held for a new election on the <num value="27">27th</num>, when no opponent appearing, Mr. Wilkes was again declared duly elected. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-02-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, the house of commons passed a resolution of expulsion against Mr. Wilkes, as the author of  <QUOTE> an insolent, scandalous, and seditious libel,</QUOTE> contained in the prefatory remarks he had published, with a letter written by lord Weymouth to the chairman of the quarter sessions of the county of Surrey; and a new writ was consequently ordered for the election of a member for Middlesex. This produced an immediate meeting of the freeholders at the Assembly-room at Mile-end, where they unanimously resolved to confirm their former choice, and to support Mr. Wilkes entirely at their own expence. 
<p>Frequent meetings were at this time held, not only by the freeholders of Middlesex, but also by the electors of Westminster, those of Southwark, and the livery of London, in order to concert proper measures for vindicating the rights of election, and instructing their particular members to support them in their parliamentary capacity. On the <datestruct VALUE="-02-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, a common hall was held for this purpose, when a string of resolutions, expressive of the desires of that court, was unanimously agreed to, and ordered to be presented to their representatives in parliament. 
<p>The most material articles in these instructions were in substance as follow:--To be particularly careful of the <hi rend=italics>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act, and to enquire into and censure any attempt to elude the force of that law. To preserve equally inviolate the privilege of parliament, <pb id="p.72" n="72"> and the rights of election in the choice of their representatives. To prevent all application of the public money to influence elections of members to serve in parliament. To use their utmost endeavours that the civil magistracy of the kingdom be put on a respectable footing, and thereby remove the pretence of calling in a military force. To use their best endeavours for having a standing committee appointed from time to time, to examine and state the public accounts. To promote a bill for limiting the number of placemen and pensioners in the house of commons, and that an oath, to prevent bribery and corruption, be taken, not only by the electors, but also by the candidates, at the opening of the poll. And, lastly, that they use their utmost endeavours to obtain an act to shorten the duration of parliaments. 
<p>The new election came on at Brentford, on the <datestruct VALUE="-02-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, when Mr. Wilkes being put in nomination, he was chosen without opposition. Notwithstanding this, when the return was made, the next day, to the house, it was resolved, <QUOTE>that Mr. Wilkes, having been expelled this session, was, and is, incapable of being elected a member of the present parliament.</QUOTE> In consequence of this resolution, the election was declared void, and a new writ was issued for another. 
<p>In the interim, a meeting of Mr. Wilkes's friends was held at the London tavern, in Bishopsgate-street, for the support of his cause; when the sum of <measure value="3340l." type=currency><num value="3340">three thousand three hundred and forty</num> pounds</measure> was immediately subscribed for that purpose; and the subscribers afterwards formed themselves into a society, under the appellation of <QUOTE>Supporters of the Bill of Rights;</QUOTE> which, they asserted, had been infringed by the proceedings against Mr. Wilkes. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-03-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, another election came on at Brentford, for a member for Middlesex; when Mr. Wilkes being the only candidate, he was again returned. The house of commons, however, persevered in their objections, and, on the same evening, declared the election null and void; and a new writ was issued for another. 
<p>Addresses were at this time presented to his majesty from almost every part of the kingdom; among which was that of the merchants of the city of London, who waited on his majesty, on the <num value="22">22</num>d; and, being introduced by the earl of Hertford, lord chamberlain of the household, they presented the same, and were most graciously received. When they set out from the Royal Exchange, in order to present the address, the populace showed their resentment by throwing of mud, &amp;c.; they shut the gates at Temple-bar, and did every thing possible to impede their progress. When some of the coaches got to Exeter-change, a hearse came out of Exeter-street, and preceded them, drawn by a black and a white horse; the driver of which was dressed in a kind of rough coat, resembling a skin, with a large cap, on <num value="1">one</num> side black, the other white, whose whole figure was very grotesque. On <num value="1">one</num> side of the hearse was <pb id="p.73" n="73"> painted, on canvas, a representation of the rioters killing Mr. Clarke, at the Brentford election; and on the other side, was a representation of the soldiers firing on young Allen in the cow-house. The populace were so outrageous, that some of the merchants were obliged to quit their carriages, and take shelter in the houses; and others, whose clothes were entirely covered with mud, retired home to shift themselves, before they could proceed with the address. 
<p>When they came to St. James's, it was discovered they had lost the address they came to present; and, while a messenger was dispatched in search of it, they began hastily to sign a copy of it. This accident was occasioned by the gentleman, in whose possession it was, being obliged to take shelter in Nando's coffee-house, in order to avoid the indignation of the populace; when, in his hurry and fright, he left the address in the coach, and ordered his coachman to return home. The address, however, being found, was forwarded to St. James's, and the addressers, at length, accomplished their wishes (though attended with such singular difficulties), of testifying their distinguished loyalty. 
<p>Several of the rioters were seized at St. James's-gate, <num value="5">five</num> of whom were detained for prosecution; and, the same evening, an extraordinary gazette was published, containing a proclamation for suppressing riots, tumults, and unlawful assemblies. 
<p>The final election for Middlesex took place on the <datestruct VALUE="-04-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>. The candidates were, Mr. Wilkes, colonel Luttrell, serjeant Whitaker, and Mr. Roche; and, at the close of the poll, the numbers were, for Mr. Wilkes, <datestruct value="1143--"><year reg="1143">1143</year></datestruct>; Colonel Luttrell, <num value="293">293</num>; Serjeant Whitaker, <num value="5">5</num>; and Mr. Roche, <num value="0">0</num>: whereupon, Mr. Wilkes was declared duly elected. On the following day, the house of commons, after considerable debates, determined, that Mr. Wilkes was still incapable of being a member of this parliament, and that colonel Luttrell should be the sitting member: in consequence of which, colonel Luttrell took the oaths and his seat, as knight of the shire for the county of Middlesex. 
<p>This decision was far from being agreeable to the nation; and, perhaps, no measure, since the accession of the present royal family, has created such universal discontent. Petitions and addresses flowed in from every part of the kingdom; in which the county of Middlesex, as being most immediately concerned, took the lead. A petition, signed by <num value="1565">one thousand five hundred and sixty-five</num> freeholders of that county, was presented to his majesty, on the <datestruct VALUE="-05-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, containing a long catalogue of grievances, relative to the infringements on the constitution, from the <num value="1">first</num> prosecution of Mr. Wilkes, to his being expelled the house of commons; and concluding thus: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p> Most Gracious Sovereign, 
<p>Such are the grievances and apprehensions, which have long <pb id="p.74" n="74"> discontented and disturbed the greatest and best part of your majesty's subjects. Unwilling, however, to interrupt your royal repose, though ready to lay down our lives and fortunes for your majesty's service, and for the constitution, as by law established, we have waited patiently, expecting a constitutional remedy by the means of our own representatives; but our loyal and free choice having been frequently rejected, and the right of election now finally taken from us, by the unprecedented seating of a candidate who was never chosen by the county, and who, even to become a candidate, was obliged fraudulently to vacate his seat in parliament, under the pretence of an insignificant place, invited thereto by the prior declaration of a minister, that, whoever opposed our choice, though but with <num value="4">four</num> votes, should be declared member for the county. We see ourselves, by this last act, deprived even of the franchises of Englishmen, reduced to the most abject state of slavery, and left without hopes or means of redress, but, from your majesty or God. 
<p>Deign, then, most gracious sovereign, to listen to the prayer of the most faithful of your majesty's subjects, and to banish from your royal favour, trust, and confidence, for ever, those evil and pernicious counsellors, who have endeavoured to alienate the affection of your majesty's most sincere and dutiful subjects, and whose suggestions tend to deprive your people of their dearest and most essential rights, and who have traitorously dared to depart from the spirit and letter of those laws, which have secured the crown of these realms to the house of Brunswick; in which, we make our most earnest prayers to God, that it may continue, untarnished, to the latest posterity.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The citizens of London were equally anxious to show their disapprobation of this proceeding, and, early in May, had requested the lord mayor to call a common-hall, for the purpose of taking the sense of the livery on the measures to be pursued in the existing circumstances; but this his lordship declined, until he could procure the opinion of the common-council upon it. A court was accordingly summoned for this purpose; when a motion was made, <QUOTE>that the right honourable the lord mayor be desired to issue a precept to assemble the livery in common-hall, pursuant to their application to his lordship;</QUOTE> which was carried in the negative, by a majority of <num value="20">twenty</num>. 
<p>But this disappointment only increased their eagerness; and, on Midsummer-day, when a common-hall was held for the choice of sheriffs, and other city officers, the hall was crowded; and so fearful were the livery of not obtaining their wishes, that they would not permit the business of the day to be entered upon, till they were assured by the lord mayor, that as soon as that was finished, he would listen to any motion they might choose to bring forward. This declaration was received with great applause, and the elections <pb id="p.75" n="75"> proceeded as usual: after which, a petition to the king being produced and read, it was unanimously agreed to, with the exception of the title, which originally stood thus: <QUOTE><hi rend=italics></hi>The humble petition of the <hi rend=italics>lord mayor, aldermen, and</hi> livery of London ;</QUOTE> but, on the suggestion of the lord mayor, the words in Italics were omitted. 
<p>In August and September, great disturbances arose among the weavers, in Spitalfields, occasioned by a body of handkerchief weavers, who, conceiving themselves not sufficiently paid, refused working, unless their masters would increase their wages. In order to support those, who were out of employment in consequence of this proceeding, they levied a contribution of <measure value="6d." type=currency><num value="6">six</num> pence</measure> a week from every loom that was at work; and if their more industrious brethren did not comply with this imposition, they destroyed their work, and cut their looms to pieces; from which they received the appellation of cutters. On the <datestruct VALUE="-09-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct> a desperate conflict took place, between a body of them and a party of the military, who were called in to assist the civil magistrate. <num value="1">One</num> of the soldiers and <num value="2">two</num> of the rioters were killed; and some of the latter being taken, <num value="2">two</num> of them, Doyle and Valline, were tried at the ensuing October sessions, and, being capitally convicted, sentence was passed upon them in the customary form. The execution of these men occasioned a curious correspondence between the lord chancellor, the secretary of state, and the sheriffs. According to the sentence passed upon them by the recorder, they were to suffer at the usual place of execution; but the warrant transmitted to the sheriffs, signified that it was his majesty's pleasure that the sentence should be executed in the most convenient place near Bethnal-green church. The sheriffs, not knowing how they ought to proceed, under the circumstances of this variation from the sentence, laid the case before serjeant Glynn, who, in his opinion, said he was unacquainted with any authority which could justify an alteration of the sentence of a court of justice, and advised them to represent their doubts to his majesty. 
<p>Upon the case being laid before the king, he ordered the prisoners to be respited till the opinion of the judges could be taken upon it; which was soon after given to the following effect: <QUOTE>that the time and place of execution are, in law, <hi rend=italics>no part</hi> of the judgment; and that the recorder's warrant was a lawful authority to the sheriffs, as to the time and place of execution.</QUOTE> In reply to this, the sheriffs wrote to the lord chancellor, to say, that, though their doubts were over-ruled, they were not satisfied: on the <datestruct VALUE="-12-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, however, a letter was received by the sheriffs, informing them, from authority, that, as the judges had determined their warrant was legal, it was his majesty's pleasure that there should be no farther respite for the <num value="2">two</num> convicts. Accordingly, on the <num value="8">8th</num>, they were executed on Bethnal-green, attended only by the peace officers, the sheriffs having refused the assistance of the military; but the mob was so outrageous, that it was found necessary <pb id="p.76" n="76"> to order the unhappy sufferers to be turned off before the usual time allowed on such occasions, to prevent a rescue. 
<p>The citizens of London not having received any answer to their petition, presented to the king, relative to the Middlesex election, determined to renew their solicitations on the subject. On the <datestruct VALUE="1770-03-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>, a committee of the livery laid a memorial before the court of common-council, in which they stated, that, though a petition had been presented by them to his majesty, no answer or redress had been obtained; they therefore applied to that court, to join in a request to the lord mayor to call another common-hall, that further measures might be taken for the re-establishment of their ancient rights and privileges. The question being put, was carried in the affirmative, and, in consequence, a common-hall was held on the <num value="6">6th</num>, when a <num value="2">second</num> application to his majesty was read, and unanimously agreed to; the title of which ran thus: <QUOTE>The humble Address, Remonstrance, and Petition, of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Livery, of the City of London, in Common-hall assembled.</QUOTE> The substance of this remonstrance was, a repetition of the grievances mentioned in their former petition, and an earnest request to his majesty to dissolve the parliament. 
<p>This address and remonstrance was presented on the <num value="14">14th</num>; and his majesty returned the following answer: <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>I shall always be ready to receive the requests, and to listen to the complaints of my subjects: but it gives me great concern to find, that any of them should have been so far misled as to offer an address and remonstrance, the contents of which I cannot but consider as disrespectful to me, injurious to parliament, and irreconcilable to the principles of the constitution. 
<p>I have ever made the law of the land the rule of my conduct, esteeming it my chief glory to reign over a free people: with this view, I have always been careful, as well to execute faithfully the trust reposed in me, as to avoid even the appearance of invading any of those powers which the constitution has placed in other hands. It is only by persevering in such a conduct that I can either discharge my own duty, or secure to my subjects the free enjoyment of those rights, which my family were called to defend; and while I act upon these principles, I shall have a right to expect, and I am confident I shall continue to receive, the steady and affectionate support of my people.</QUOTE>
 
<p>At a court of aldermen, held on the <num value="13">13th</num>, the legality of this address, and the propriety of its title, were strongly objected to, and a motion was made that it should be disavowed in that court; which occasioned a warm altercation. Next day, the following protest appeared in all the public papers. <QUOTE><p>We, the aldermen of the city of London, whose names are hereunto subscribed, observing that the address, remonstrance, and petition, agreed upon by the livery, who met at Guildhall, on Tuesday, the <num value="6">6th</num> of this inst.

<p>The example of the majority of the court of aldermen was followed by <num value="3">three</num> of the city companies, who disputed the power of the lord mayor, in calling common-halls, on any other occasion than merely for the election of city officers. At a court of assistants of the goldsmiths' company, held the <num value="22">22</num>d of March, the following resolution was agreed to: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>The right honourable the lord mayor having issued precepts for summoning the livery of this city to meet at Guildhall, on Tuesday, the <num value="6">6th</num> inst. to consider of a farther application for a redress of grievances; at which meeting, a most indecent remonstrance was ordered to be presented to his majesty; 
<p>Resolved and ordered, That, for the future, the wardens of this company do not summon the livery thereof to attend at any meeting in the Guildhall (except for the purpose of elections), without the express approbation or consent of this court.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The companies of grocers and weavers followed the example of the goldsmiths, and, at their next court days, passed resolutions of a like tendency. On the <datestruct VALUE="-04-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, a common-hall was held at Guildhall, by virtue of a precept from the lord mayor, to receive the report of his majesty's answer to the address, remonstrance, and petition, of the lord mayor, aldermen, and livery, of London; as also to hear the resolutions and addresses of the houses of lords and commons thereupon; and to take into consideration the late proceedings of the companies of goldsmiths, weavers, and grocers; and, in particular, their resolution not to obey the orders of the lord mayor, for summoning the livery of the respective companies to attend at common-halls. The last committee of the livery were appointed to consider what would be the proper mode of proceeding against these refractory companies, and to report their opinion to the court of common-council. 
<p>In the month of November, the long-contested question of the legality of general warrants was brought to a decided issue, by the result of the prosecution which Mr. Wilkes had instituted against the earl of Halifax; and which was tried in the court of common pleas, before sir John Eardley Wilmot, and a special jury, by whom <pb id="p.78" n="78"> a verdict of <measure value="4000l." type=currency><num value="4000">4,000</num>l.</measure> damages was given for the plaintiff. In <datestruct VALUE="1770-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>, Mr. Wilkes was discharged from confinement; on which occasion the metropolis was illuminated, and transparencies with No. <num value="45">45</num>, blue candles, &amp;c. were exhibited, from respect to the man whom the people regarded as the martyr of liberty. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-05-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, a court of common-council was held, to consider of a <num value="3">third</num> address, petition, and remonstrance, to his majesty, which was presented on the <num value="23">23</num>d; when his majesty was pleased to return the following answer; 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>I should have been wanting to the public, as well as to myself, if I had not expressed my dissatisfaction at the late address. 
<p>My sentiments on that subject continue the same; and I should ill deserve to be considered as the father of my people, if I could suffer myself to be prevailed upon to make such an use of my prerogative, as I cannot but think inconsistent with the interest, and dangerous to the constitution, of the kingdom.</QUOTE>
 
<p>It was on this occasion that the lord mayor, Beckford, made that reply to the king, so much spoken of at the time, for its promptitude and spirit, but which is now asserted to have been composed by Mr. Horne Tooke, and entrusted to his lordship's memory. 
<p>Her majesty having been happily delivered of a princess, on the <num value="22">22</num>d of May, the lord mayor went to St. James's, on the <num value="30">30th</num>, with the customary congratulations, and was informed, <QUOTE>that, as his lordship thought fit to speak to his majesty, after his answer to the late remonstrance, as it was unusual, his majesty desired that nothing of the kind might happen for the future.</QUOTE> 
<p>On the following day, the lord mayor, attended by the sheriffs and several of the aldermen, went in state to the Old Bailey, and laid the <num value="1">first</num> stone of the present prison of Newgate. This was the last public transaction of Mr. Beckford's life, which was terminated by a rheumatic fever, on the <datestruct VALUE="-06-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>. The high opinion in which he was held, at that time, by his fellow-citizens, was evinced by the <num value="1">first</num> common-council held after his death; in which a resolution was passed for erecting a statue to his memory, in Guildhall. 
<p>The recorder having given great offence to the corporation, by refusing to attend the presentation of the late addresses and remonstrances, <num value="2">two</num> motions were carried, in the court of common-council, on the <datestruct VALUE="-07-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, for taking the recorder's conduct into consideration at the next court, and for printing and distributing a copy of his oath to the members. 
<p>In consequence of hostilities committed by the Spaniards, by forcibly taking possession of a small British settlement on the Falkland Islands, government gave orders for immediate preparations for a war with that power; and press-warrants were issued to all the sea-ports and principal towns in England. Application being made by the lords of the admiralty to the lord mayor, to back these warrants, he refused, on the ground that this was an unusual procedure, unless when the lord mayor received intimation of its necessity <pb id="p.79" n="79"> immediately from the privy council; when the request was made through that channel, the lord mayor complied; but it produced much dissension in the corporation. 
<p>A court of common-council was held on the <datestruct VALUE="-09-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>, at which the case of the recorder was taken into consideration. That gentleman attended, and justified his conduct, declaring, that should a similar case occur, he would act as he had done: in consequence of which, the court came to a resolution, <QUOTE>that the recorder, by refusing to attend the lord mayor, aldermen, and commons of this city, with their humble address, remonstrance, and petition, acted contrary to his oath and the duty of his office,</QUOTE> and the further consideration was adjourned to the <datestruct VALUE="-10-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>; when it was resolved, that he should be no more advised with, retained, or employed, in any affairs of the corporation; he being deemed unworthy of their future trust or confidence. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-11-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, a court of common-council was held at Guildhall, when it was unanimously agreed and resolved, that the sum of <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num> shillings</measure> for every able seaman, and <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure> for every ordinary seaman, over and above the bounty granted by his majesty, be given during the pleasure of the court, and not exceeding <num value="1">one</num> month from this day, to every such seaman as shall enter at the Guildhall of this city into the service of his majesty's navy. It was also resolved and ordered, that the remembrancer do immediately wait on the right honourable sir Edward Hawke, <num value="1">first</num> lord commissioner of the admiralty, with a copy of the resolution fairly transcribed, and signed by the town-clerk, and signify the request of the court, that his lordship will, at a proper opportunity, lay the same before his majesty, as an humble testimony of their zeal and affection for his most sacred person and government. 
<p>At the same court, a motion was made and carried, that another humble address, remonstrance, and petition be presented to his majesty, touching the violated right of election, and praying for a dissolution of parliament. This address was presented on the <num value="21">21st</num>; and his majesty returned the following answer. <QUOTE>As I have seen no reason to alter the opinion expressed in my answer to your address upon this subject, I cannot comply with the prayer of your petition.</QUOTE> 
<p>The lieutenants employed in the impress service attended the lord mayor, on the <datestruct VALUE="-12-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, to have their warrants backed by his authority; but his lordship refused, and told them, that the bounty given by the city was intended to prevent such violence. The opposition to the impress service was carried to such a height in the city of London at this period, that on the <datestruct VALUE="1771-01-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1771">1771</year></datestruct>, a motion was made in the court of common-council to censure alderman Harley, for having backed the warrants; and, on the <num value="22">22nd</num>, the following resolution was carried: <QUOTE>That if any person shall be impressed within this city or liberty into his <pb id="p.80" n="80"> majesty's service, by virtue of any warrant granted or backed by any of his majesty's justices of the peace for this city, that this court will immediately direct their solicitor, at the city's expense, to prosecute, in the name of the person so impressed, if he desires it, not only the justice of the peace who granted or backed the said warrant, but the constable or peace-officer who executes the same.</QUOTE> This question, however, was put to rest by a letter from the secretary of state to the lord mayor, informing him that the dispute between the <num value="2">two</num> governments was amicably adjusted. 
<p>There seemed to be, at this period, a determination in some of the city magistrates to oppose and thwart every measure which originated with the government; and, under the plausible pretence of upholding the privileges of the corporation, they sought opportunities of counteracting all their proceedings. In <datestruct VALUE="1771-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1771">1771</year></datestruct>, complaint had been made to the house of commons, by some of its members, that their speeches had been grossly misrepresented in the public newspapers, a practice which prevailed too generally on both sides; and, as the insertion of the proceedings of the house is a direct violation of their standing orders, a motion was made, and carried by a great majority, for ordering Messrs. Wheble and Thompson, the printers of <num value="2">two</num> of the papers, to the bar. This order was not obeyed, and, in consequence, another was made for taking them into the custody of the serjeant at arms, which proved equally ineffectual. A royal proclamation was therefore issued, offering a reward for apprehending them. Soon afterwards, Mr. J. Wheble, <num value="1">one</num> of the offenders, was taken by a journeyman printer, and carried before Mr. Wilkes, who happened to be the sitting alderman at Guildhall. Finding that there was no other authority for the detention of Wheble than the proclamation, Mr. Wilkes ordered him to be discharged, and then bound him over to prosecute the man who had forcibly taken him. 
<p>Mr. Miller, the printer of the Evening Post, having been also complained against, was taken into custody by a messenger of the house of commons, at his own house, by virtue of a warrant from the Speaker. Mr. Miller sent for a constable, who carried both him and the messenger before the lord mayor, who was assisted by aldermen Wilkes and Oliver. They not only discharged the printer, but compelled the messenger to give bail to answer the assault and imprisonment of a citizen, without the order of a city magistrate. 
<p>The house of commons resented this contempt of their authority, and ordered the lord mayor and the <num value="2">two</num> aldermen to appear before them. Mr. Crosby and Mr. Oliver attended, as members of the house; but Mr. Wilkes refused to appear, except as member for Middlesex. The house, not choosing to enter again into this question, adjourned over the day appointed for his attendance; but, in the mean time, they committed the lord mayor and <pb id="p.81" n="81"> alderman Oliver to the Tower, where they remained to the end of the session. 
<p>The conduct of these magistrates, on this occasion, was so highly approved by the citizens, that a vote of thanks to them was passed in the court of common council, and a committee was appointed to assist them in their defence; and, after their committal, they were brought before every court of judicature at Westminster, by <hi rend=italics>Habeas Corpus</hi>, at the city expence, in order to procure their enlargement; but the courts refused to interfere with the privileges of the house of commons; and they were remanded to the Tower. 
<p>At length, the day arrived, when, by the prorogation of parliament, the power that detained them expired, and their liberation was the consequence. Some days previous to it, the court of common-council had resolved to attend their enlargement, accompanied by the city officers. Accordingly they assembled at Guildhall, and proceeded to the Tower in <num value="53">fifty-three</num> carriages; the procession being augmented by the artillery company, who attended in their uniform. When the lord mayor and Mr. Oliver were brought to the Tower-gate, they were saluted by <num value="21">twenty-one</num> pieces of cannon belonging to the artillery company, and from thence to the Mansion-house received the loudest acclamations of an innumerable concourse of spectators. 
<p>At a court of common-council, held the <datestruct VALUE="-05-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, it was resolved and ordered, <QUOTE>That it be referred to the committee appointed to assist the lord mayor and alderman Oliver, in the Tower, to state cases, and take opinions, whether there is any, and what, method to bring into a course of trial, the legality of an imprisonment by a vote of either house of parliament.</QUOTE> It was farther resolved, <QUOTE>That, in case the said committee should be advised that the legality of the commitment of the lord mayor and alderman Oliver can be put into a due course of trial by law, they be authorized so to do.</QUOTE> 
<p>At another court of common-council, held the <datestruct VALUE="-06-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, the opinions of the counsel, who had been consulted by the committee above-mentioned, were read to the court; when it appeared they did not think any action could be commenced on that account. At the same time, the report was made from the committee, who had been appointed to consider of a proper mode of proceeding against the Goldsmiths, Grocers, and Weavers' companies, for their disobedience to the lord mayor's precepts. The report stated, that queries had been submitted to counsel, on the following heads; namely, the power of the lord mayor to call common halls; the obligation of the masters and wardens of the several companies to obey the lord mayor's precepts; and the methods of punishment, in case of refusal. 
<p>The answers to these questions were as follow:--<QUOTE><p>We <pb id="p.82" n="82"> conceive it to be the duty of the proper officers of the several companies, to whom precepts for summoning their respective liveries have been usually directed, to execute those precepts; and that a wilful refusal on their parts is an offence punishable by disfranchisement. If it be thought proper to prosecute with that view, in the present case, we think it most advisable to proceed in the usual way, by information, to be filed by the common serjeant, in the mayor's court; which the common serjeant may file <foreign lang=la>ex officio</foreign>, if he pleases, or at the instance of either of the bodies mentioned in the query.

<p>A common-hall was held, as usual, on Midsummer-day, for the election of city officers for the year ensuing. This business being adjusted, a motion was made for presenting another humble address, remonstrance, and petition to his majesty, setting forth the many grievances already complained of, and still unredressed; together with the injurious and unconstitutional behaviour of the house of commons, during the last sessions, who had imprisoned the person of the lord mayor, their chief magistrate, and Mr. alderman Oliver, <num value="1">one</num> of their representatives. The remonstrance being read to the livery, it was unanimously approved of, and ordered to be presented by the lord mayor, aldermen, sheriffs, the city members, the common-council, and the livery of London, attended by the city officers. Another motion was made and carried, <QUOTE>That the livery of London do desire the common council to present a silver cup to the right honourable the lord mayor, of the value of <measure value="200l." type=currency><num value="200">two hundred</num> pounds</measure>, with the city arms engraved thereon; and to the aldermen Wilkes and Oliver, <num value="1">one</num> each, of the value of <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">one hundred</num> pounds</measure>, as marks of their gratitude for their upright conduct in the affair of the printers, and for supporting the city charters.</QUOTE> Though this motion was readily agreed to by the livery, it met with some obstacles in the court of common-council; and so long was it before it was carried, that the cups were not presented to the different parties till the month of January following. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-06-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, came on at Guildhall, the trial of Edward Twine Carpenter, for an assault, in seizing and taking up the person of J.

<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-07-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, the sheriffs waited on the king, to know when he would be pleased to receive the city remonstrance; when his majesty appointed the <num value="10">10th</num>, at <num value="2">two</num> o'clock. The lord mayor, therefore, issued precepts for the attendance of the aldermen, common-council, and livery; but in the evening preceding the day appointed, his lordship received the following letter: <pb id="p.83" n="83"> 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>My Lord, 
<p>As, in consequence of the notice given of the time, your lordship proposes setting out to-morrow, the livery may be induced to attend your lordship to St. James's, I have the king's commands to acquaint you, that, it being unprecedented to admit the livery upon such occasions, as well as impracticable to introduce so numerous a body, no persons, beyond the number allowed by law to present petitions to the throne, will be admitted, except your lordship, the aldermen, common-council, and city officers. I am, my lord, with the greatest respect, your lordship's most obedient, humble servant,

<p>This letter being read to the livery, who had assembled in Guildhall, a committee of <num value="10">ten</num> (the number allowed by act of parliament made in the reign of Charles II.) were appointed to attend his lordship on the occasion. When the town-clerk had done reading the remonstrance, his majesty returned the following answer: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>I shall ever be ready to exert my prerogative, as far as I can, constitutionally, in redressing any real grievances of my subjects; and the city of London will always find me disposed to listen to any of their well-founded complaints: it is, therefore, with concern that I see a part of my subjects still so far misled and deluded, as to renew, in such reprehensible terms, a request, with which I have repeatedly declared, I cannot comply.</QUOTE>
 
<p>In the beginning of October, the city solicitor filed informations of disfranchisement, in the mayor's court, against the masters and wardens of the <num value="3">three</num> refractory companies of Goldsmiths, Grocers, and Weavers, for refusing to obey the lord mayor's precept for a common hall. 
<p>The refractory city companies having removed the above informations from the mayor's court to the court of King's Bench, and the city solicitor having obtained rules for them to shew cause why the several writs of <hi rend=italics>certiorari</hi> for removing the same should not be quashed, the matter was argued in that court on the <datestruct VALUE="-06-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, when lord Mansfield gave the opinion of the court thereon; which was, that the writs had been improvidently granted; that causes of that nature had no business in Westminster-hall; that every corporation, <foreign lang=la>inter se</foreign>, was the sole judge of its own rights and franchises; and that the corporation of London had the right and power of determining the present cause solely in their own hands. In consequence of this, on the <datestruct VALUE="-06-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, the city solicitor signed judgment of disfranchisement against the masters and wardens of the <num value="3">three</num> companies, in the mayor's court; but, in the afternoon, the recorder set the 
<p>G <num value="2">2</num> <pb id="p.84" n="84"> judgment aside, in order, as he alledged, to give the parties an opportunity of trying the merits of the cause at large. 
<p>In the morning of the <datestruct VALUE="-12-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, there happened <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest fogs in London that had ever been remembered; through which great damage was done. The darkness was so great, that the carriages of the nobility and gentry were attended by lights, the same as at midnight. Many accidents occurred during the continuance of the fog, which lasted through the night; and, in the morning, several people were found dead in the fields round the metropolis, who, not being able to find their way, were supposed to have perished from the inclemency of the weather, 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1773-03-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct>, a common-hall was held, by virtue of the lord mayor's precepts for that purpose, to consider of a further application to the throne, for a redress of grievances; when an address, petition, and remonstrance was agreed to, which, by his majesty's appointment, was presented on the <num value="29">29th</num>. After it had been read by the recorder, his majesty returned the following answer: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>I have the satisfaction to think that my people don't doubt of my readiness to attend to their complaints, or of my ardent desire to promote their happiness; which I cannot more effectually do than by resisting every attempt to sow groundless jealousies among them. 
<p>Your petition is so void of foundation, and is, besides, conceived in such disrespectful terms, that I am convinced you do not seriously imagine it can be complied with.</QUOTE>
 
<p>At a court of common-council held the <datestruct VALUE="-06-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, the recorder's salary was augmented to <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">one thousand</num> pounds</measure> per annum, during the pleasure of the court, and, at the same time, an additional salary of <measure value="200l." type=currency><num value="200">two hundred</num> pounds</measure> per annum was granted to the common-serjeant. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-07-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, the cause between the common serjeant, on behalf of the city of London, and Samuel Plumbe, esq. prime warden, or master of the Goldsmiths' company, was tried at Guildhall. The suit was instituted against the defendant, for refusing to obey a precept, issued in <datestruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>, by the then lord mayor, to convene the livery of the said company to a common-hall; and, after a patient hearing, it was determined in favour of the plaintiff. 
<p>The dreadful calamities occasioned by the American war occurred about this period. This destructive contest was entered into against the wishes and interests of the people, and in defiance of every constitutional principle by which the country had ever been governed; but the public sentiment had no influence with administration; and, on the <datestruct VALUE="1775-08-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct>, the war was publicly declared at the usual places in London, by a proclamation for  <QUOTE>suppressing rebellion and sedition.</QUOTE>  The lord mayor, Mr. Sawbridge, however, being inimical to the general proceedings of the <pb id="p.85" n="85"> court, but particularly to a contest in which his brother subjects were concerned, ordered that the usual official attendances of the mace, &amp;c. should not be complied with; and further to evince his detestation of such an unnatural conflict, he refused to back the press warrants issued from the admiralty in the October following.<NOTE>The illegality of impressing freemen of the city of London proved a fertile source of discord at this period between the administration and the city magistrates. Whilst the disputes continued, several naval officers on the impress service were charged with assaults, and taken into custody by individuals whom they had seized within the city's jurisdiction. In these cases, the impressed men were immediately discharged, and the officers held to bail or committed for trial.</NOTE>
 
<p>In the beginning of the year <datestruct value="1776"><year reg="1776">1776</year></datestruct>, sir Stephen Theodore Janssen resigned his situation as chamberlain of the city; the vacant office was strongly contested between aldermen Benjamin Hopkins and Wilkes; but the election was determined in favour of the former: after whose decease in <datestruct value="1779--"><year reg="1779">1779</year></datestruct>, Mr. Wilkes was elected without opposition, and held the office till the time of his death. 
<p>In <datestruct VALUE="1779-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1779">1779</year></datestruct>, much damage was done in and near the metropolis, by a hurricane, by which most of the ships in the river were driven from their moorings, and some destroyed. Several houses were blown down, and others stripped of their roofs; the stacks of chimnies that fell were numerous. Many lives were lost, and a great number of persons considerably maimed and bruised by the fall of the buildings. 
<p>A cause was tried in the court of King's Bench, on the <datestruct VALUE="-08-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, respecting the right of a claim set up by the city of London, to a duty of <measure value="6d." type=currency><num value="6">six</num>-pence</measure> per load, on hay sold in Smithfield, not the property of freemen of London. This was disputed by the inhabitants of Finchley, who pleaded an exemption in favor of the bishop of London and his tenants, granted by king John; but as it did not appear that the manor of Finchley belonged to the bishop at the time of the grant, a verdict was given for the city of London. 
<p>The attention of all ranks of people, both in the metropolis and in the rest of the kingdom, was, in the beginning of the year <datestruct value="1780"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, strongly directed to the general misconduct of government in the administration of public affairs, to the encroachments that had been made on civil liberty, and to the wasteful and extravagant expenditure of the public money. Petitions, having for their object, not only a change of ministry, but also some very essential alterations in the constituted body of the house of commons, poured in from all parts of the country; and different committees were appointed in the cities of London and Westminster, to give due effect to the prayer of the petitioners. Mr. Burke, who, at that time, was esteemed <num value="1">one</num> of the most active of the patriotic <pb id="p.86" n="86"> band, proposed his celebrated plans of economy and efficient controul, some of which were eventually carried into effect, in opposition to ministerial influence; but the greatest triumph which the popular party attained over the premier of the day, lord North, was in the month of April, when Mr. Dunning, afterwards lord Ashburton, obtained a majority on his famous resolution, <QUOTE>that the influence of the crown had increased, was increasing, and ought to be diminished.</QUOTE> This was followed by several other motions branching out from the former, and calculated to restore the administration of affairs to a state of greater political probity; all which were carried in direct opposition to the will of the minister. A recess of <num value="10">ten</num> days, however, in the meetings of the house, on account of the indisposition of the speaker, afforded the government an opportunity to exert the acts of corruption and intrigue; by which means, when the parliament again assembled, the minister was enabled to counteract all the measures which were afterwards proposed for the public good. Mr. alderman Sawbridge, who was <num value="1">one</num> of the city representatives, publicly charged lord North with exercising such corrupt influence on some of the members, and offered to prove his charges at the bar of the house; but his lordship thought it most convenient to avoid the challenge. Though somewhat discouraged by this retardation of success, the popular leaders continued their efforts, and prepared to introduce the important motions for  <QUOTE>annual parliaments,</QUOTE>  and  <QUOTE>a more equal representation of the people in the house of commons.</QUOTE>  At this time, associations had been formed in almost every quarter of the kingdom, for the purpose of consolidating the public sentiment; and it was at least expected, that some concessions in favour of constitutional liberty would have been wrested from the arbitrary controul of the administration.<NOTE><BIBL>Brayley's Hist. of London, i. <num value="527">527</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>About this period, some very unexpected events, which chiefly took their rise from the weakest and most unenlightened men that the nation could produce, rendered nugatory all those constitutional efforts. These events were the  <QUOTE>Protestant Association,</QUOTE>  the tumultuous meetings which it occasioned, and the riots and conflagrations in the metropolis, that resulted from the attempts made to carry the object of the association into effect. 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1778"><year reg="1778">1778</year></datestruct>, it having become the general opinion of liberal-minded men, that the laws against papists were much too rigorous to be enforced in an enlightened age, an act of parliament had been passed for  <QUOTE>relieving his majesty's subjects, professing the Romish religion, from certain penalties and disabilities imposed upon them in the <num value="11">eleventh</num> and <num value="12">twelfth</num> years of the reign of king William the <num value="3">Third</num>.</QUOTE>  This act, at the time, did not appear to excite any great alarm among persons of any class; nor would it, <pb id="p.87" n="87"> perhaps, have ever given birth to such extraordinary results, had not the Catholics acted very indiscreetly, in taking more liberties in the public exercise of their religion than what they had been previously accustomed to, and in proceeding to the yet greater length of proposing to open public schools for the education of youth in the Romish faith. 
<p>The sensation produced by these occurrences, led many of the lower class of rigid protestants to express great apprehensions of the increase of popery, and to exclaim against the late act, by which they thought it was countenanced and supported. These persons, who for the most part were chiefly methodists and bigotted calvinists, at length formed themselves into a body in London, under the title of the  <QUOTE> Protestant Association,</QUOTE>  and chose for their president lord George Gordon, younger brother to the duke of Gordon, and at that time member of parliament for Ludgershall. This young man had been educated in the rigid doctrines of presbyterianism; and from imbibing a sort of hereditary repulsion to popery, was a fit head for such a community. Under his direction, a petition was framed for a repeal of the obnoxious act, and so much industry was employed to procure signatures, that the names of upwards of <num value="120000">120,000</num> persons were affixed to it; among them, however, were those of many women and children. 
<p>The petition being thus prepared, a general meeting of the Association was held on the evening of <datestruct VALUE="1780-05-29"><month reg="05">May</month> the <day reg=29>29th</day>, <year reg=1780>1780</year></datestruct>, at Coachmakers'-hall, Noble-street; when lord George, after stating his opinion,  <QUOTE>that the indulgence given to popery by the repeal of the act of William the <num value="3">Third</num>, was inconsistent with the principles of the revolution, dangerous to the Hanoverian succession, and destructive to the civil and religious liberties of the country;</QUOTE>  and stated his conviction, that  <QUOTE>the only way to stop it was by going in a firm, manly, and resolute manner to the house of commons, and shewing their representatives that they were determined to preserve their religious freedom with their lives;</QUOTE>  that,  <QUOTE>for his part, he would run all hazards with the people; and if the people were too lukewarm to run all hazards with him, when their conscience and their country called them forth, they might get another president; for he would tell them candidly, that he was not a lukewarm man himself, and that if they meant to spend their time in mock debate and idle opposition, they might get another leader.</QUOTE>  This speech was received with the loudest applause, and his lordship then moved the following resolution:  <QUOTE>That the whole body of the Protestant Association do attend in St. George's Fields, on Friday next, at <num value="10">ten</num> of the clock in the morning, to accompany his lordship to the house of commons, on the delivery of the protestant petition.</QUOTE>  This was carried unanimously. His lordship then said, that  <QUOTE>if less than <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> of his fellow-citizens attended him on that day, he would not present <pb id="p.88" n="88"> their petition;</QUOTE>  and, for the better observance of order, he moved,  <QUOTE>that they should arrange themselves into <num value="4">four</num> divisions; the protestants of the city of London on the right, those of the city of Westminster on the left, the borough of Southwark <num value="3">third</num>, and the people of Scotland resident in London and its environs to form the last division;</QUOTE>  and,  <QUOTE>that they might know their friends from their enemies,</QUOTE>  he added, that  <QUOTE> every real protestant and friend of the petition should come with a blue cockade in his hat.</QUOTE>  
<p>Accordingly, on Friday, <datestruct VALUE="-06-2"><month reg="06">June</month> the <day reg=2>2nd</day></datestruct>, the day appointed, about <num value="10">ten</num> o'clock in the morning, a vast concourse of people from all parts of the city and suburbs, assembled in St. George's Fields, near the obelisk, where they awaited the arrival of their president, who came about <num value="11">eleven</num>; and having, in a short speech, strongly recommended the necessity of a peaceable deportment, he marshalled them into ranks, and gave directions for the conduct of the different divisions. His lordship then left them, proceeding in his carriage to the house of commons over Westminster-bridge; and the committee of the association, with many other members, went the same way: but the main body, amounting to at least <num value="50000">50,000</num>, took their route over London-bridge, marching in tolerable order, <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> in a rank, through Cornhill, Fleet-street, and the Strand. Each division was preceded by its respective banner, having the words   <QUOTE>No Popery</QUOTE>  written on it, with other sentiments expressive of the business of the day; the petition itself, with the skins of parchment containing its numerous signatures, and which had been tacked together by a tailor in St. George's Fields, was carried at the head of the procession. At Charing-cross, the multitude was increased by additional numbers on foot, on horseback, and in carriages; so that, by the time the different parties had met together, all the avenues to both houses of parliament were entirely filled with the crowd. 
<p>Till this period, every thing had been conducted with proper decorum; but a most lamentable change took place as soon as the members of parliament began to assemble. Among such an immense concourse of people, it could not be imagined that every <num value="1">one</num> would be equally peaceable; yet the scenes of confusion and riot which ensued, went far beyond all possible calculation, and most forcibly impressed the reflecting mind with the never-to-be-forgotten lesson of the imminent danger that attends the expression of the 
<foreign lang=la>vox populi</foreign> from a congregated multitude. The Protestant Association appeared to recede from its avowed purpose, and to assume all the properties of a seditious mob. Both peers and commons were insulted in their progress to the parliament-house, and it was with great difficulty that some of them escaped with their lives. 
<p>The archbishop of York was the <num value="1">first</num> attacked; the bishop of Litchfield had his gown torn; the wheels were taken off the bishop of Lincoln's carriage, and his lordship narrowly escaped with life; the lord president of the council, lord Bathurst, was treated very roughly; the windows and pannels of lord Mansfield's coach were <pb id="p.89" n="89"> broken to pieces; the duke of Northumberland's pocket was picked of his watch; the lords Townshend and Hillsborough came together, and were grossly insulted; lord Stormont's coach was broken to pieces, and himself in the hands of the mob for near half an hour; lords Ashburnham and Boston were treated with the utmost indignity, particularly the latter, who was so long in their power, that it was proposed to the house, to go in a body, and endeavour, by their presence, to extricate him; but, in the interim, his lordship escaped without any material hurt. Many others of the peers were personally ill-treated; and Wellbore Ellis, esq. was obliged to take refuge in the Guildhall of Westminster, whither he was pursued, the windows broken, the doors forced, and justice Addington, with all the constables, expelled. Mr. Ellis escaped with the greatest hazard. 
<p>During these unwarrantable proceedings, lord George Gordon came several times to the top of the gallery stairs, and harangued the mob, informing them of the bad success their petition was likely to meet with, and pointing out the members who opposed it. It was considered as a mark of pusillanimity in the house of commons, that, upon the arrival of the guards at night, they did not commit <num value="1">one</num> of their own body, who had so shamefully violated their privileges, and brought them into such unequalled disgrace and danger, to the Tower: but it is doubtful whether such an attempt, on that day, would not have increased the fanatic fury of the populace to such a height, which might have overpowered every endeavour to restrain it. 
<p>Further outrage to the parliament itself was now prevented by the arrival of the guards; and the house of commons, on the motion of lord George, seconded by Mr. alderman Bull, <num value="1">one</num> of the city representatives, agreed to the bringing up of the petition; but his lordship's subsequent motion, that it should be taken into immediate consideration, was negatived by <num value="192">one hundred and ninety-two</num> against <num value="6">six</num>. It was resolved, however, that it should be debated on the Tuesday following, and the house then adjourned. These decisions were not satisfactory to the mob; yet, as the presence of the military restrained them from violence on the spot, they separated into parties, and commenced the work of destruction by partly demolishing the Romish chapels in Duke-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, and Warwick-street, Golden-square; and all the furniture, ornaments, and altars of both chapels were committed to the flames. This was effected before the guards could arrive, when <num value="13">thirteen</num> of the rioters were taken up. No further outrage of importance was committed during that night. 
<p>On the next day, Saturday, the tumult appeared to have subsided, and the rage of bigotry and lawless violence was thought to be allayed; but this expectation proved eminently fallacious. On Sunday afternoon, a mob of many thousands assembled in <pb id="p.90" n="90"> Moorfields; and with the cry of  <QUOTE> No Papists!</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>Root out Popery!</QUOTE>  they attacked the popish chapel in Ropemaker's-alley; and having demolished the inside, they carried the altars, pulpits, pictures, seats, &amp;c. into the street, and committed them to the flames. More mischief was prevented by the arrival of a party of the guards, when the rioters immediately began to disperse. Early on the following morning, however, they assembled again on the same spot, and demolished the school, and <num value="3">three</num> dwelling houses belonging to the priests, in Ropemakers'-alley, together with a valuable library. They now divided into parties; and threatening destruction to all who should oppose them, they proceeded to different quarters of the town. <num value="1">One</num> party went to Virginia-street, Wapping, and another to Nightingale-lane; Cast Smithfield, where they severally destroyed the Catholic chapels, and committed many other outrages. The house of sir George Saville, (who had introduced the obnoxious bill into parliament) in Leicester-fields, was, to use the vulgar but descriptive phrase of the mob, completely  <QUOTE>gutted</QUOTE>  by a <num value="3">third</num> party; as were also the houses of Mr. Rainsforth, tallow-chandler, of Stanhope-street, Clare market, and Mr. Maberly, of Little Queenstreet, Lincoln's-inn-fields; the latter persons having appeared as evidences against some of the rioters, who were taken up on the preceding Friday, and <num value="5">five</num> of the most active of whom had been committed to Newgate. In all these cases, the furniture and effects were burnt before the doors of the dilapidated dwellings. 
<p>On Tuesday, the day appointed for taking the petition into consideration, all the military in London were ordered on duty; yet a knowledge of this fact did not appear to intimidate the populace, and a multitude no less numerous than had assembled on the Friday, again choaked up every avenue to the parliament-house. In vain had the committee of the Protestant Association circulated a resolution, requesting  <QUOTE>all true Protestants to shew their attachment to their best interests, by a legal and peaceable deportment.</QUOTE>  The storm which they had raised, it was beyond their power to allay. As the day advanced, the mob grew more tumultuous; they demolished the carriage of lord Sandwich, and seized his person; but he was fortunately rescued from their violence by a party of horse. The residence of lord North, in Downing-street, was also attacked; but the assailants were repulsed by a body of light horse. 
<p>In the midst of this alarming state of things, the house of commons acted with firmness and decision; they declared, that  <QUOTE>no act of theirs could be legal while the house was beset with a military force, and under apprehensions from the daring spirit of the people;</QUOTE>  and on this principle they adjourned, having previously voted among other resolutions, that it was a  <QUOTE> high and dangerous breach of the privilege of parliament to insult or attack members coming to <pb id="p.91" n="91"> attend their duty in that house.</QUOTE>  The peers also adjourned after a slight conversation. 
<p>On the rising of the house, lord George Gordon acquainted the multitude with what had been done, and advised them to depart quietly; in return, they unharnessed his horses, and drew him in triumph to the house of Mr. alderman Bull. Whilst <num value="1">one</num> body of the rioters was thus employed, justice Hyde, with a party of the horse-guards, attempted to disperse the rest, and after some opposition, he succeeded; yet they only separated to re-assemble <hi rend=italics>in</hi>
 other places. The activity of the justice was highly resented by the mob, and about <num value="7">seven</num> in the evening, a detached party despoiled his house in Lisle-street of all its furniture, and burnt it before the doors: on the approach of the military, the looters immediately fled. 
<p>The prison of Newgate was the next object of attack; but the mob, like  <QUOTE> regular assailants, did not proceed to storm before they had offered terms.</QUOTE>  They demanded from the keeper, Mr. Ackerman, the release of their confined associates, as the only means to save his mansion. He refused to comply; yet, dreading the consequence, he posted to the sheriffs to know their pleasure. On his return, he found that his house was in flames; and the gaol itself was soon in a similar situation. The doors and entrances had been broken open with pick-axes and sledge-hammers; and it is scarcely to be credited with what celerity the gaol was destroyed: <QUOTE>nor is it less astonishing, that, from a prison thus in flames, a miserable crew of felons in irons, and a company of confined debtors, to the number in the whole of more than <num value="300">three hundred</num>, could all be liberated, as it were by magic, amidst flames and firebrands, without the loss of a single life; some from the gloomy cells of darkness, in which the devoted victims to public justice were confined, and others from inner apartments, to which the access in tranquil times were both intricate and difficult.</QUOTE> 
<p>The devastations of this night were now only begun. The release of the Newgate ruffians gave an increase of strength and ferocity to the mob, which despised intimidation; and the ministers of justice and law were among the <measure value="1bmark" type=currency><num value="1">first</num> mark</measure>ed out for vengeance. The public-office in Bow-street, and the house of that active magistrate, sir John Fielding, adjoining, were presently attacked by the rabble, and all their furniture and effects, books, papers, &amp;c. committed to the flames. Justice Coxe's, in Great Queen-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, was similarly treated; the <num value="2">two</num> prisons at Clerkenwell were set open, and the prisoners liberated; the houses of Mr. Lyon, in Bunhill-row, and a pawnbroker in Golden-lane, were dilapidated, the goods, &amp;c. being burnt before the doors; and to complete the melancholy catalogue, the elegant mansion of lord Mansfield, in Bloomsbury-square, was plundered and burnt to ashes, together with an invaluable collection of rare manuscripts, notes on <pb id="p.92" n="92"> law eases, pictures, books, deeds, &amp;c. Here the mob met with some resistance from a small party of the military, headed by a civil magistrate, who read the Riot Act, and afterwards ordered the detachment to fire, by which <num value="6">six</num> men and <num value="1">one</num> woman were killed,<NOTE>The case of this female was a very pitiable <num value="1">one</num>. She lived servant with a Mr. Dubois, and was going towards the street door, when she was killed by a ball which passed through it into the passage. Several bullets also entered the parlour window at the same time, yet no other person was hurt, though several were in the room.</NOTE> and several other persons wounded. Many of the mob having made their way to his lordship's cellars, suffered from intoxication. 
<p>Not content with the mischief done to lord Mansfield's property in Bloomsbury-square, a large body of the rioters marched off to his lordship's seat at Caen Wood; but here their destructive intentions were frustrated by a party of horse, which had arrived about half an hour before them; and they retired without commencing an attack. 
<p>The violence of the populace, instead of diminishing, or being glutted with the destruction, horror, and consternation they had already spread, seemed to be considerably increased on the Wednesday; which is not so much to be wondered at, when it is considered hat all the prisoners of Newgate, Clerkenwell Bridewell, and New Prison, had been let loose on the terrified inhabitants of the panic-struck metropolis. Some even had the audacity to go into public houses, and call for what provisions and drink they thought proper, without paying for any; nor dared the affrighted publicans ask for payment; on the contrary, they thought themselves happy that they had not their houses pulled down. Others still more daring, even knocked at the doors of private houses in noon-day, and extorted contributions from the inhabitants. <num value="1">One</num> man, in particular, was mounted on horseback, and refused to take any thing but gold. 
<p>Many outrages were committed in the borough of Southwark; several Popish chapels and private dwellings were burnt in various parts, particularly about Kent-street and its environs. The King's Bench prison, with <num value="3">three</num> houses adjoining, a tavern, and the New Bridewell, were also set on fire, and almost entirely consumed. An attempt was likewise made to set fire to the Marshalsea; but here the rioters were repelled by the soldiery; and another large body of the insurgents were put to flight in Tooley-street, after several had been killed and wounded, and others made prisoners, by an armed association of many of the substantial inhabitants of Southwark. 
<p>On the preceding night, the inhabitants of most parts of the town had been obliged to illuminate their windows; and, in the course of this day, they were compelled to chalk up the words  <QUOTE> No Popery!</QUOTE>  on their doors and window shutters: blue ribbons and pieces of silk, <pb id="p.93" n="93"> by way of flags, were hung out at most houses with intent to deprecate the fury of the insurgents, from whom no person thought himself wholly secure. Those whose business called them into the streets, were likewise emulous to mount a blue cockade, in order to preserve themselves from personal insult. 
<p>The outrages of this day were excessive. The rioters appeared to consider themselves as superior to all authority; and not only openly avowed their intention to destroy certain private houses of the Catholics, but also declared an intention to burn the remaining public prisons, and demolish the Bank, the Temple, Gray's-inn, Lincoln's-inn, the New-river-head, the royal palaces, and the arsenal at Woolwich. The attempt upon the Bank was made twice in the course of the day, but both attacks were feebly conducted, and the rioters easily repulsed, several of them falling by the fire of the military, and many others being wounded. An unsuccessful attempt, in which several fell, was also made upon the Pay Office. 
<p>The threats of the insurgents, with the endeavours thus made to accomplish their purposes, seem at last to have awakened the latent energies of government, and vigorous measures were now taken to repress the disorders which had raged so long without controul. The military had hitherto acted under the guidance of the civil power, but an order was this day issued by the authority of the king in council, for  <QUOTE>the military to act without waiting for directions from the civil magistrates, and to use force for dispersing the illegal and tumultuous assemblies of the people.</QUOTE>  As no man could foresee what might be the effect of a discretionary power vested in such hands, in a populous city, and in the centre of trade, the greatest alarm prevailed; all shops were shut up, and the approach of night was awaited in the most fearful suspense. 
<p>As soon as the day was drawing towards a close, <num value="1">one</num> of the most awful and dreadful spectacles this country ever beheld was exhibited. The mob had not only declared their resolution of firing the prisons, and some private houses, but had avowed their intention to destroy all the public offices. An universal stupor had seized the minds of men; they looked at <num value="1">one</num> another, and waited, with a resigned consternation, for the events which were to follow. Government, indeed, had exerted itself to the utmost, as far as their power, under the direction of the civil magistrates, would extend. Now, however, it was become necessary to make use of the royal prerogative, and give discretionary power to the military. 
<p>Nothing could convey a more awful idea of the mischief which was dreaded, than the strong guard which was placed at the Royal Exchange for the protection of the Bank, as nothing could have equalled the national desolation, had the purposes of the insurgents upon this place succeeded. Soldiers were distributed at Guildhall, in the inns of court, in almost every place tenable as a <pb id="p.94" n="94"> fortification, and in some private houses; and the cannon was disposed to the best advantage in the park. 
<p>With minds thus predisposed to terror by so many objects of devastation, and in a city which but a few days before enjoyed the most perfect tranquillity, let those who were not spectators judge what the inhabitants felt, when they beheld at the same instant of time, the flames ascending and rolling in vast voluminous clouds from the King's Bench and Fleet prisons, from New Bridewell, from the toll-gates on Blackfriars' bridge, from houses in every quarter of the town, and particularly from the bottom and middle of Holborn, where the conflagration was horrible beyond description. The houses that were <num value="1">first</num> set on fire at this last-mentioned place, both belonged to Mr. Langdale, an eminent distiller, and contained immense quantities of spirituous liquors. It is easy to conceive what fury these would add to the flames, but to form an adequate idea of the distresses of the neighbouring inhabitants, and indeed of the inhabitants in every part of the city, is perhaps impossible. Men, women, and children, were running up and down with beds, glasses, bundles, or whatever they wished most to preserve; and in streets where there were no fires, numbers were removing their goods and effects at midnight. The shouts of the rioters were heard at <num value="1">one</num> instant, and at the next the dreadful report of soldiers' muskets, as if firing in platoons, and at various places: in short, every thing which could impress the mind with ideas of universal anarchy and approaching desolation seemed to be accumulating. Sleep and rest were things not thought of; the streets were swarming with people; and uproar, confusion, and dismay, reigned in every part. <num value="6">Six</num>-and-<num value="30">thirty</num> fires were all to be seen blazing at <num value="1">one</num> time in the metropolis during the night. 
<p>These devastations, however, were no longer committed with impunity, and numbers of the rioters fell in the course of this night by the musket and the sword. Many of these misguided wretches died also with inebriation in different parts, but especially at the distilleries of Mr. Langdale, from whose vessels the liquor poured in streams down the kennels, and  <QUOTE> was taken up in pails, and held to the mouths of the besotted multitude.</QUOTE>  Others were killed with drinking non-rectified spirits; and many became so miserably intoxicated, that they were either burnt in the flames which themselves had kindled, or buried in the falling ruins. In some streets  <QUOTE>men were seen lying upon bulks and stalls, and at the doors of empty houses, drunk to a state of insensibility, and to a contempt of danger; boys and women were in the same condition, and many of the latter with infants in their arms.</QUOTE>  
<p>The numerous victims to insulted justice which military interference had thus spread before the eyes of the rioters, and the continual arrival of fresh troops from all parts of the country within <num value="50">fifty</num> or <num value="60">sixty</num> miles of the metropolis, had their full effect of intimidation. <pb id="p.95" n="95"> The riots were quelled; and many inconsiderate wretches who had engaged in them were secured on the Thursday in various parts of the town. On this day, London may be said to have borne great similarity to a city recently stormed. The Royal Exchange, the public buildings, the squares, and the principal streets, were all occupied by troops; the shops were closed, and business was entirely at a stand, whilst immense volumes of dense smoke were still rising from the ruins of consumed buildings. No disturbance occurring during the night, the alarm gradually subsided, and on Friday business was began to be transacted as usual. In the course of the day, lord George Gordon underwent a long examination before the privy council, and in the evening he was committed to the Tower, to which he was conveyed by a most numerous escort. On the following day, the secretary of the Protestant Association, an attorney, named Fisher, was also sent under a strong guard to the above fortress. Upwards of <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> soldiers were at this time supposed to have their quarters in London; the guards were afterwards encamped in St. James's park, and the marching regiments and militia in Hyde park. The idea of being governed by martial law excited much discontent, particularly among the citizens, whose rights were shamefully invaded by an order from lord Amherst to colonel Twisleton, who commanded the regular forces stationed in the city, to disarm all persons who did not belong to the militia, nor bore arms under the royal authority, and to detain their arms. This measure became the subject of parliamentary debate, and the duke of Richmond moved that it should be declared <QUOTE>expressly contrary to the fundamental laws of the constitution;</QUOTE> but this motion was negatived by the ministry. The uncontrolled ascendancy of the military force, however, was found to excite such general dissatisfaction, that the king in a speech from the throne to the parliament on the <datestruct VALUE="-06-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, judged it expedient to advert to the necessity of the measure;<NOTE> <QUOTE>The outrages committed by bands of desperate and abandoned men in various parts of the metropolis,</QUOTE> said his majesty, <QUOTE>who broke forth with such violence into felony and treason, had so far overborne all civil authority, and threatened so directly the immediate subversion of all legal power, and destruction of all property, and the confusion of every order in the state, that I found myself obliged by every tie of duty and affection to my people, to suppress in every part those rebellious insurrections, and to provide for the public safety by the most effectual and immediate application of the force intrusted to me by parliament.</QUOTE> </NOTE> and to give <QUOTE>his solemn assurances that he had no other object but to make the laws of the realm, and the principles of our excellent constitution in church and state, the rule and measure of his conduct.</QUOTE> 
<p>The number of lives that were lost during the continuance of the riots was never, perhaps, correctly ascertained. The return given of the killed and wounded by the military, was as follows: killed by the association, militia, and guards, <num value="109">109</num>; ditto by the light <pb id="p.96" n="96"> horse, <num value="101">101</num>; died in hospitals, <num value="75">75</num>; total <num value="285">285</num>. Prisoners under cure, <num value="73">73</num>. Within a few days after the suppression of the mob, a special commission was issued for trying the rioters in Southwark; but those of London were left to the regular course of the sessions at the Old Bailey, which chanced to be near. The number of persons tried for rioting in the latter court was <num value="85">eighty-five</num>, of whom <num value="35">thirty-five</num> were capitally convicted; in Southwark, <num value="50">fifty</num> persons were tried as rioters, <num value="24">twenty-four</num> of whom were adjudged guilty. Between <num value="20">twenty</num> and <num value="30">thirty</num> of the most active of the convicted rioters were executed in a few days after their trials, in different parts of town, but immediately contiguous to the scene of their respective devastations.<NOTE><BIBL>Brayley's History of London, from the New Annual Register, &amp;c. i. <num value="540">540</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The new influence which these unfortunate events threw into the grasp of the ministry was very great; and that ardour which had appeared for promoting popular meetings and associations for opposing the encroachments of government, subsided into a lukewarm indifference.

<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1780-10-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> day of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, the chamberlain was ordered by the court of common-council, to lay before them an account of the monies paid out of the chamber, on account of the lord mayor; which being produced, a motion was made and carried in the affirmative, that the sum of <measure value="814l." type=currency><num value="814">eight hundred and fourteen</num> pounds</measure> <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">one</num> shilling</measure>, paid on account of the lord mayor's view of the river, and expedition to Windsor, ought not to be defrayed by the city; being totally unnecessary and highly extravagant. 
<p>In consequence of its being mentioned that the audit-dinners were, in general, very extravagant, a motion was made, and unanimously agreed to, that, in future, the expenses of auditing the city and bridge-house accounts, do not exceed <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> pounds</measure>. 
<p>A motion was also made, that the chamberlain do not pay the lord mayor more than the sum of <measure value="352l." type=currency><num value="352">three hundred and fifty-two</num> pounds</measure> <measure value="19s." type=currency><num value="19">nineteen</num> shillings</measure>, the balance due to his lordship, out of the ample allowance given by the city. The lord mayor refused to put the question for some time, but, having consented, it was resolved in the affirmative. <pb id="p.97" n="97"> 
<p>On the <num value="26">26th</num> the court proceeded in the plan of retrenchment they had begun, and limited the expences of the conservancy to <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">three hundred</num> pounds</measure>, in every mayoralty. It was also resolved, that no money be paid out of the chamber, without the special direction of the court of common-council. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1781-02-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1781">1781</year></datestruct>, came on in the court of King's Bench, the trial of lord George Gordon, who was accused as the author of the late riots, of high treason, in <QUOTE>levying war, by assembling great multitudes together, and striving, by terror and outrage, to compel parliament to repeal a law.</QUOTE> The jury acquitted him; and <num value="1">one</num> of them afterwards told his lordship in court, in reply to some remarks on the objects of the prosecution, that  <QUOTE> their decision had turned upon a very nice point.</QUOTE>  In the month following, Benjamin Kennet, esq. the late lord mayor, was tried in Guildhall, for not using the proper means and authority for suppressing the riots in an early stage of the tumult. The jury returned a verdict of <QUOTE> guilty,</QUOTE>  in  <QUOTE>neglecting to do his duty,</QUOTE>  but not  <QUOTE>wilfully and obstinately.</QUOTE>  The court refusing to record this verdict, another of  <QUOTE> guilty,</QUOTE>  generally, was given; the decease of alderman Kennet, however, before sentence was pronounced, put a stop to further proceedings. 
<p>The ruinous progress of the public affairs, the decay of trade, and the increasing discontent of the nation at the long continuance and ill success of the American war, at length produced a change in the measures of government, which for a short time seemed to move in unison with the wishes of the people. In <datestruct VALUE="1781-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1781">1781</year></datestruct>, a very pointed remonstrance was presented by the citizens of London to the king, in which they deprecated the <QUOTE>intention</QUOTE> manifested in his majesty's speech, <QUOTE>of persevering in a system of measures, which had proved so disastrous to the country;</QUOTE> exhorted him <QUOTE>no longer to continue in a delusion from which the nation had awakened;</QUOTE> and implored him to <QUOTE>dismiss from his presence and councils all the advisers, both private and public, who had deluded him into such an unfortunate and unnatural war.</QUOTE> The city of Westminster followed the example of that of London; and similar petitions and remonstrances flowing in from most other places in the kingdom, the premier thought proper to give way; and in the course of March and <datestruct VALUE="1782-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct>, anew ministry was chosen under the auspices of that able and illustrious statesman, the marquis of Rockingham. Negociations for peace were soon afterwards commenced, and preliminaries were settled on the <datestruct VALUE="1783-01-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>: the definitive treaties were signed at Paris on the <datestruct VALUE="-09-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct> following; and on the <datestruct VALUE="-10-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, the peace was proclaimed at the accustomed places in London, with the usual ceremonies, and amidst the reiterated acclamations of an immense multitude of people. 
<p>The gleam of sunshine which these occurrences had spread over the horizon of political liberty, was soon overclouded by the death <pb id="p.98" n="98"> of the marquis of Rockingham, and the divisions which that fatal event admitted to break out among his party. Mr. Pitt, the eloquent son of the late earl of Chatham, acceded to power; and though an act of apostacy marked the outset of his career, that is, the abandonment of the cause of parliamentary reform, of which he had previously been an ardent supporter, his youth and splendid talents, but, above all, his fascinating eloquence, had such an effect upon the multitude, that for some time, he may be said to have become the  <QUOTE> idol of a people's hope.</QUOTE>  The Coalition Administration was dismissed in <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>, and Mr. Pitt became prime minister; yet, from that period to the dissolution of parliament, about the end of March, he was left in a minority on almost every question debated in the house of commons. During the elections for a new parliament, the metropolis presented an almost constant scene of uproar and confusion; but particularly in Westminster, where the struggle between the ministerial candidates and Mr. Fox was unparalleled, and the poll was kept open from <datestruct VALUE="-04-1"><month reg="04">April</month> the <day reg=1>1st</day></datestruct> till <datestruct VALUE="-05-17"><month reg="05">May</month> the <day reg=17>17th</day></datestruct>. This latter circumstance occasioned the passing of an act, by which the duration of all future elections was limited to <num value="15">fifteen</num> days.<NOTE><BIBL>Brayley's History of London, i. <num value="542">542</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The grandest musical performance ever attempted in any country, was exhibited in Westminster-abbey, in May and June of <datestruct value="1784--"><year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct>, in commemoration of Handel. It originated in a conversation between some amateurs, in which it was lamented, that no public occasion existed for collecting all the vocal and instrumental performers of eminence into <num value="1">one</num> band, which would produce a performance on so grand and magnificent a scale as no other part of the world could equal. The birth and death of Handel, the former of which was a complete century, and the latter exactly a quarter of a century, before this period, was immediately recollected as offering a desirable opportunity for making the attempt. The plan was speedily communicated to the different musical societies in the metropolis, and coming, at length, to the knowledge of the king, was honoured with his sanction and patronage. Westminster-abbey, where the remains of the great musician were deposited, was selected as the most proper place for the performance: and it was determined to appropriate all the profits arising from it to charitable purposes. No sooner was the project known, than the greater part of the practical musicians in the kingdom manifested their zeal for the enterprise; and many of the most eminent professors, waving all claim to precedence, offered to perform in any subordinate station. The <num value="1">first</num> performance took place on the <datestruct VALUE="-05-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>; the number of performers amounted to <num value="522">five hundred and twenty-two</num>, and that of the audience to nearly <num value="5000">five thousand</num>; of which, at least <num value="2">two</num> thirds were ladies; feathers, and all extraneous ornaments being forbidden, the neatness and simplicity of their dresses added charms to their <pb id="p.99" n="99"> natural beauty, and produced such an assemblage of elegant women as no other country in the universe could boast of. There were <num value="5">five</num> performances in the whole, the <num value="2">second</num> of which was at the Pantheon, in Oxford-street; and the total amount of the receipts for tickets, including <num value="2">two</num> rehearsals, was <num value="11842">eleven thousand eight hundred and forty-two</num> guineas; after payment of the expences, which amounted to upwards of <measure value="5000l." type=currency><num value="5000">five thousand</num> pounds</measure>, the remainder was given to charities, as follows: to the Musical Fund <measure value="6000l." type=currency><num value="6000">six thousand</num> pounds</measure>; to the Westminster-hospital <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">one thousand</num> pounds</measure>. 
<p>The attention of the metropolis was excited in a high degree, on the <datestruct VALUE="-09-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>, by the <num value="1">first</num> aerial voyage ever undertaken in this kingdom. Mr. Lunardi ascended from the Artillery-ground with a balloon, <num value="33">thirty-three</num> feet in diameter, amidst the admiration and dread of an immense concourse of spectators, about <num value="2">two</num> o'clock in the afternoon; and, after a voyage of <num value="3">three</num> hours, descended in a meadow, <num value="5">five</num> miles beyond Ware in Hertfordshire. 
<p>A remarkable occurrence happened in the court of King's Bench, Westminster, on the <datestruct VALUE="1785-04-22"><day reg="22">22nd</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct>. In consequence of a very high wind, some of the stones from the upper part of the building fell through the sky-light; the fragments of the glass falling among the judges on the bench, and a considerable part of the ceiling was scattered about among the barristers and officers of the court. Impressed with the idea that the whole fabric was tumbling, their lordships, and all the bar, made a precipitate retreat: but soon finding that it was a premature alarm, the court was resumed. In this confusion, several gentlemen of the bar were much hurt; particularly a Mr. Stebbing, who, being thrown backwards on <num value="1">one</num> of the benches, was trampled over by his affrighted brethren, and received several severe bruises. 
<p>The long-contested question relative to the power of the court of aldermen to remove <num value="1">one</num> of their body, was finally determined in the court of King's Bench, on the <datestruct VALUE="-06-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct> in this year. Some years before, in consequence of several accusations brought against alderman Wooldridge, repeated summonses were sent to him to attend in his place in the court of aldermen, to answer to them; all of which being unattended to, he was declared to have forfeited his seat, and a wardmote was held for the election of an alderman in his stead. At a subsequent period, he attended and claimed to be received as alderman; which being refused, he obtained a <hi rend=italics>mandamus</hi> from the court of King's Bench to be restored: the return to this mandamus had been argued in November preceding, but the court required further time to decide upon it; and, on this day the final argument was heard, when the court unanimously pronounced judgment in favour of the city, declaring their opinion that the court of aldermen had the power to remove <num value="1">one</num> of the aldermen, upon a just and reasonable cause; and that, in the present instance, their exercise of that right was perfectly legal. 
<p>H <num value="2">2</num> <pb id="p.100" n="100"> 
<p>Early in the morning of the <datestruct VALUE="1786-02-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct>, a fire broke out in a room adjoining to the chamberlain's office, in Guildhall, and, notwithstanding speedy assistance, burnt so furiously for some time, that the whole of that office was destroyed, together with all the books of accounts, several bonds, and a considerable sum in bank-notes and cash. Part of the court of King's Bench was also damaged; but the fire was at length got under, without communicating to the other offices. 
<p>A cause was tried at the Lent assizes for the county of Surrey, which lasted <num value="3">three</num> days. It was brought by the corporation of the city of London, as conservators of the river Thames, against a shipwright at Rotherhithe, for obstructing the navigation by erecting a floating dock; the jury, after <num value="5">five</num> hours' deliberation, found the defendant guilty. 
<p>In August, an attempt was made on the life of his majesty, by an insane woman, named Margaret Nicholson; who, under the pretence of presenting a petition, struck at him with a concealed knife, as he was alighting from his carriage at St. James's. The blow was warded off by a page, and the woman seized; she was afterwards sent to a mad house, where she continued till her death. On this occasion, addresses of congratulation at the king's escape were transmitted from all parts of the kingdom. The address from the corporation of London was carried by the lord mayor, and other officers, attended by a numerous body of citizens. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1788-06-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct>, a violent storm of rain and thunder arose at <num value="4">four</num> o'clock in the afternoon, and continued to rage incessantly for <num value="2">two</num> hours. The thunder was terrific; and the rain poured down so fast, that the streets were wholly impassable for foot passengers; and in places where there happened to be a descent of ground, as near Northumberland-house from St. Martin's-lane, the current run so strong, that even carriages could not be driven through it. Many kitchens and cellars were inundated in different parts of the town; and in George-street, Westminster, the windows of several houses were broken by a fire-ball, and other damage done. 
<p>The ensuing winter was very remarkable for a severe frost, which began on the <datestruct VALUE="-11-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, and lasted exactly <num value="7">seven</num> weeks. On the <datestruct VALUE="-01-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>, the thermometer stood at <num value="11">11</num>&deg; below the freezing point, in the very midst of the city. The river Thames was completely frozen over below London-bridge; and from the variety of booths, &amp;c. erected on the ice, it assumed all the appearance of a fair; even puppet-shows and wild beasts were exhibited. The thaw was sudden, and the confusion which it occasioned was extreme. The large bodies of ice that floated down the river made it necessary to moor the shipping to the shore; yet, notwithstanding every precaution, many vessels broke away by the weight and pressure of the shoals and tide. <num value="1">One</num> vessel that was lying off Rotherhithe, and partly fastened to the main beams of a house, was <pb id="p.101" n="101"> among the latter number. By this accident, the whole building gave way, and unhappily <num value="5">five</num> persons, who were sleeping in their beds, were killed. The distresses of the poor in London, during this inclement season, were very great; and though liberal subscriptions were raised for their relief, many perished through want and cold. On this occasion, the city subscribed <measure value="1500l." type=currency><num value="1500">1500</num>l.</measure> towards supporting those persons who were not in the habit of receiving alms. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1789-04-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>, (St. George's Day) the metropolis displayed a most splendid scene of festivity and show, in celebration of his majesty's recovery from the calamitous state of insanity, which had attacked him in the preceding October. This event had given birth to the celebrated question respecting a restricted regency, which, after many animated debates in both houses of parliament, was carried in the affirmative. The arrangements proposed, however, were rendered useless, by the gradual restoration of the king's health, under the judicious treatment directed by Dr. Willis. The official notification of a complete recovery was published on the <datestruct VALUE="-03-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>; and all ranks of people seemed to vie with each other in testifying their joy. In the morning the Park and Tower guns were fired, the bells were rung in the churches, and all the shipping in the river were decorated with the colours of their respective nations, streamers, devices, &amp;c. At night, the metropolis was illumined throughout, and many appropriate transparencies were exhibited by the more affluent inhabitants. Shortly afterwards, Saint George's day was appointed by authority for a general thanksgiving; and their majesties on that day went in great state to St. Paul's cathedral, accompanied by both houses of parliament, the great officers of state, and the corporation of London. The universal joy and loyalty which pervaded the cities of London and Westminster, the grandeur of the spectacle exhibited, in the more than triumphal entry of a beloved sovereign, filled the mind with the most sublime ideas. 
<p>The procession began a quarter before <num value="8">eight</num>, by the house of commons in coaches (<num value="167">167</num> members attending), followed by the speaker in his robes, seated in his state-coach, with his mace-bearer and chaplain, from Palace-yard; and, passing through the entrance at the horse-guards into St. James's park, went out at the Stableyard, and ranged along Pall Mall and Charing-cross, followed by <num value="3">three</num> knights-marshalmen, the clerk of the crown, masters in chancery, and the <num value="12">twelve</num> judges, in the capacity of assistants to the house of peers. After them, the peers in coaches, in the order of precedency, as they were marshalled by the black rod; beginning with lord Malmesbury, as youngest baron, and ending with the duke of Norfolk, the premier duke. The lord high chancellor, in his robes of office, and his state-coach, closed this part of the procession. 
<p>Soon after the members of both houses had passed, the male branches of the royal family appeared in different carriages, in due order of precedency. Their majesties set out from the queen's <pb id="p.102" n="102"> palace soon after <num value="10">ten</num>, in the order previously arranged by his majesty himself. Between <num value="11">eleven</num> and <num value="12">twelve</num>, the king's carriage arrived at Temple-bar, where the lord mayor was in waiting, attended by <num value="6">six</num> delegates from the corporation: viz. sheriffs Curtis and sir Benjamin Hammett, as aldermen, and deputies Leekey and Birch, with Messrs. Wadd and Dixon, as commoners. The lord mayor and his associates came thither in coaches soon after <num value="9">nine</num>, and were politely accommodated, by the banking-house of Mr. Child, in the great room immediately over the Bar, till, on notice of the king's approach, they all mounted their beautiful white palfreys, which were richly caparisoned, the saddles and bridles new for the occasion, silver-stitched, silver roses, and silk reins; the furniture blue and gold, with tassels of gold fringe; the front of the bridles richly embroidered with the words <QUOTE>God save the King!</QUOTE> White fur caps to the holsters, richly wrought with gold; and each horse decorated with <num value="3">three</num> dozen of favours, blue and white. The lord mayor was in a rich gown of crimson velvet; the <num value="2">two</num> aldermen in their scarlet gowns, and the <num value="4">four</num> commoners in their mazarine gowns, dressed uniformly in dark blue coats, white waistcoats and breeches, with purple roses in their shoes, and at their knees. Each of them had a walking page, carrying a hat, adorned with a beautiful cockade of purple and gold, inscribed, <QUOTE>Long live the King!</QUOTE> After they had taken horse, the lord mayor dismounting in form, surrendered the city sword to his majesty; who having graciously returned it, the lord mayor, on horseback, carried it bare-headed before the king to St. Paul's. The sheriffs and <num value="4">four</num> commoners rode also bare-headed. 
<p>Nothing could exceed the magnificence of the procession from Temple-bar. 
<p>Immediately after the lord chancellor's carriage, the arrangement of the procession was as follows:

<p>The different guards of honour in the procession were formed from the Oxford Blues; and the whole was closed by a troop of the royal regiment of horse guards. 
<p>All the charity children entered the church at the north and south doors, by <num value="7">seven</num> o'clock in the morning, and remained till the church was cleared. They had a place appropriated for their appearance, much in the same manner as at their anniversary meeting. This was at the particular desire of her majesty. 
<p>The clergy, with the minor canons, and their friends, entered the church, at the Dean's-gate, at <num value="8">eight</num> o'clock. 
<p>The aldermen, with their ladies, and the principal city officers, between <num value="8">eight</num> and <num value="9">nine</num>, proceeded from the Mansion-house, along Cheapside, to the south entrance of St. Paul's church. 
<p>The corporation were represented in the procession from Temple-bar, as we have already stated, by a deputation. The other members of the body corporate assembled at <num value="8">eight</num> o'clock, in Guildhall, whence, in about half an hour, they began to parade on foot, in their mazarine gowns, through Cheapside, Newgate-street, the Old Bailey, and Ludgate-street. They were in <num value="2">two</num> divisions, each attended with a suitable standard, and an excellent band of music. The <num value="1">first</num> division was led by Deputies Hillier, Nichols, Wrench, and Mr. Pope; the other by deputies White, Merry, Mr. Box, and Mr. Slade; all with wands, painted blue and gold, and elegant cockades of purple and gold. Entering the church at the northwest gate, they remained in the morning prayer chapel, until the king's arrival was announced; when they ushered his majesty into the choir, and immediately took their seats. 
<p>The peers and members of the house of commons soon after entered the west door of the church. 
<p>The female nobility, gentry, and others, came down Holborn, proceeded along Snow-hill and Newgate-street, down Warwicklane, along Paternoster-row, and were set down at Cannon-alley, opposite to the north door of the church, where an awning was erected; their carriages then proceeded to the end of Pater-noster row, turned round to the left into Newgate-street, down St. Martin's-le-grand, into Aldersgate-street, where they waited. <pb id="p.104" n="104"> 
<p>Their majesties were met at the west door of St. Paul's, by the bishop of London, the dean of St. Paul's (bishop of Lincoln); the canons residentiary, garter king at arms, and the rest of the heralds; the band of gentlemen pensioners and the yeomen of the guard. The sword of state was carried before his majesty by the marquis of Stafford into the choir, where the king and queen placed themselves under a canopy of state, at the west end of it, opposite to the altar. 
<p>The peers had their seats in the area, as a house of lords; and the commons were in the stalls. The upper galleries were allotted to the ladies of the bedchamber, the maids of honour, and such ladies of distinction as attended on the occasion. The foreign ministers were placed in the <num value="2">two</num> lower galleries next to the throne ; and the lord mayor and aldermen, in the lower galleries, near the altar. 
<p>Immediately on their majesties being seated, divine service commenced. The sermon was preached by the bishop of London; after which, an anthem, selected for the occasion, by the king, was sung by the gentlemen of the choir. The whole was finished about <num value="3">three</num> o'clock, when their majesties returned with the same state to Buckingham-house. 
<p>The streets through which the procession passed, were filled with rejoicing spectators. Before most of the houses were placed temporary galleries, crowded with beauty and fashion. Every precaution which prudence could suggest was taken to guard against the accidents which might have been expected from such a numerous assemblage of people, but they were unnecessary: good humour had so completely taken possession of every individual, that the military, who were stationed to keep the multitude in order, had nothing to <hi rend=italics>do</hi> but to see the procession with their fellow-citizens in the rear. 
<p>On the following evening, a general illumination took place throughout London and Westminster, which, for splendour and magnificence, surpassed all former exhibitions. All the public offices, the houses of the nobility and gentry, as well as many of those of private individuals, were decorated with transparencies, or elegant designs in coloured lamps; while, even in the humble garret of the indigent, the gleam of loyalty and affection twinkled as cheerfully, if not as brightly, as in the splendid mansion of the opulent.<NOTE><BIBL>Lambert's History of London, ii. <num value="309">309</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The repeal of the shop-tax, which was obtained in the course of this session of parliament, was celebrated on the <datestruct VALUE="-06-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, by a dinner at the London tavern, to which the <num value="10">ten</num> representatives of London, Westminster, Middlesex, and Southwark, were invited, in testimony of the respect and gratitude of the tradesmen, for their exertions to relieve them from this burthen. 
<p>A dreadful fire consumed the Opera-house, on the night of the <pb id="p.105" n="105"> <datestruct VALUE="-06-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>. The performers were rehearsing a ballet on the stage, when they were suddenly alarmed by flakes of fire falling on their heads. In a few minutes after, the whole building was in a blaze, which, from the vast quantity of combustible materials on the premises, and the calmness of the evening, ruse in a spiral column to an extraordinary height. The light was so powerful that, for a few minutes, the whole western front of St. Paul's cathedral was as minutely visible as at noon day. 
<p>On Midsummer-day, serjeant Adair resigned the office of recorder, John William Rose, esq. was elected his successor on the <num value="30">30th</num>, and his salary fixed at <measure value="600l." type=currency><num value="600">six hundred</num> pounds</measure> per annum. 
<p>The endeavours of the Protestant Dissenters to procure a repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts, having failed in the last session, by a very small majority, they were this year renewed with increased ardour; and, in the hope of strengthening their interest, the claims of the Roman Catholics were also included in their application to parliament. This junction of opposing interests, added to the violent political conduct of their leaders, induced moderate men to withhold that support, which the great body of the dissenters were, perhaps, entitled to; and induced the friends of the established church to exert a greater degree of vigour in opposing their pretensions. Among other measures calculated to give weight to this opposition, a common council met, on the <datestruct VALUE="1790-02-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>, for the especial purpose of taking into consideration the steps taken by the dissenters to obtain the repeal of these acts, and whether any and what proceedings were necessary to be taken by that court; when, after a calm and dispassionate investigation of the subject, the following resolutions were carried by a very great majority. 
<p>I. That it is the indispensable duty of this court to support the rights and privileges of the church of England, as by law established; they being essentially connected with, and forming a part of our happy constitution. 
<p>II. That a full, perfect, and free toleration in the exercise of religious duties, must be the wish and glory of every liberal mind; but to remove the <num value="2">two</num> bulwarks to our sacred constitution, in church and state, by a repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts, would tend to produce that civil anarchy, which at <num value="1">first</num> pointed out to the legislature the necessity of making such wise and salutary restrictive laws. 
<p>III. That this court do consider themselves called upon to strengthen the hands of those friends to the established church, in the house of commons, who have, twice, successfully opposed the repeal of the Corporation and Test Acts, by expressing their public thanks for such conduct; and to solicit the members of this court who have seats in parliament, strenuously to resist every attempt that shall be made to obtain that repeal. 
<p>On the discussion of the question in the house of commons, <pb id="p.106" n="106"> the motion, which last year was lost only by <num value="20">20</num>, was now negatived by <num value="189">189</num>. 
<p>About this period, the streets of the metropolis were infested by a villain of a non-descript species in this country, and, for that reason, known by the appellation of the Monster. It was his practice to follow some well-dressed lady, whom he found unaccompanied by a man; and sometimes, after gross language, sometimes without saying a word, to give her a cut with a sharp instrument concealed in his hand, either through her stays or through her petticoats behind. Several ladies had been thus attacked and wounded by this fellow, who had always the address to escape undetected; when, on the <datestruct VALUE="-06-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, a Miss Porter, who had been assaulted by him in the manner described, was walking in the Park, in company with a gentleman, and met him. She immediately exclaimed, <QUOTE>The wretch has just passed us!</QUOTE> and pointed him out to the gentleman, who followed and apprehended him. On the <datestruct VALUE="-07-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, he was brought to trial at the Old Bailey, and found guilty upon the clearest evidence; but the judge reserved the sentence upon a point of law. The decision of the judges on this point being that the indictment was defective in form, he escaped the capital part of the charge; but was afterwards tried for this, and <num value="2">two</num> other assaults, and, being convicted of the whole of them, was sentenced to <num value="6">six</num> years imprisonment. 
<p>The death of Mr. Nugent, who had held the office of common-serjeant from the year <datestruct value="1758"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct>, occasioned a vacancy for that office; the election for which came on the <datestruct VALUE="-07-22"><day reg="22">22nd</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, when Mr. Sylvester was chosen, during pleasure. But this limitation being thought inconsistent with the nature of his office, part of which is to act as judge in the <num value="1">first</num> criminal court in the kingdom, it was rescinded by the next court. 
<p>A cause was tried in the sheriffs court, at Guildhall, on the <datestruct VALUE="-10-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, in which John Wilkes, esq. as chamberlain of the city of London, was plaintiff, and John Pardoe, esq. defendant. The action was brought to recover the penalty of <measure value="600l." type=currency><num value="600">six hundred</num> pounds</measure>, which is ordained by a bye-law of the court of common-council, to be paid for declining to serve the office of sheriff, to which Mr. Pardoe had been elected in the year <datestruct value="1783"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>, but refused to serve, on the ground of his being incapacitated. As it appeared that Mr. Pardoe, when he was chosen sheriff, was <num value="69">sixty-nine</num> years of age, in an infirm state of health, and totally unfit to serve the office, the jury, which was special, gave a verdict in his favour. 
<p>The month of December was remarkable for <num value="2">two</num> violent storms of wind; the <num value="1">first</num> was on the morning of the <num value="15">15th</num>, by which considerable damage was done; and the <num value="2">second</num>, which was much more destructive, began between <num value="4">four</num> and <num value="5">five</num> o'clock in the morning of the <num value="23">23rd</num>, and was attended with successive flashes of lightning, and continued rolls of loud thunder. Part of the copper roofing of the new stone buildings, in Lincoln's-inn, was blown over the <pb id="p.107" n="107"> <num value="6">six</num> clerk's office, into Chancery-lane, and some pieces of it over the roofs of the houses on the opposite side of the lane, so that it must have been carried upwards of a <num value="100">hundred</num> feet through the air. Many houses were much damaged by stacks of chimnies falling through the roofs, and some lives were lost; and, in the country, the effects of the storm were equally violent: its severity was also felt in France. 
<p>The case of the city of London against the corporation of Lynn, came on to be argued in the court of King's-bench, on the <datestruct VALUE="1791-01-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>. It was a writ of error, from the court of Common pleas, where a trial at bar was had on a writ <foreign lang=la>de essendo quietum de Theolonio</foreign> (of being quit from toll), brought by the city of London, to assert the right of their citizens to be exempted from a toll on corn, demanded by the corporation of Lynn. The cause was tried in <datestruct VALUE="1789-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>, by a special jury of the county of Norfolk, who found a verdict in favour of the citizens of London: and the errors were now assigned on the informality of the declaration, which did not state, that the city of London had received an injury, on which an action could be maintained, the corporation of Lynn having demanded, but not received, or distrained for, the toll in question. On this defect in the declaration, the judgment was reversed ; but the rights of the citizens of London were not at all affected by this decision. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-02-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, the river Thames overflowed its banks to a greater extent than ever had been remembered. All the low grounds adjacent to the stream were inundated, and immense damage was done along the wharfs and in the warehouses on both sides of the river. In Palace Yard the water was nearly <num value="2">two</num> feet deep, and boats were rowed up from the Thames to Westminster-hall-gate. The <num value="2">two</num> Scotland Yards and the Privy Gardens were entirely under water, and many parts impassible for hours. The gardens and fields between Westminster-bridge and Blackfriar's road, were in a similar state; and Bank-side, Queenhithe, Thamesstreet, Tooley-street, Wapping High-street, &amp;c. with most of the intermediate wharfs were alike overflowed. 
<p>A general meeting of the royal academicians was held at Somerset-house, on the <datestruct VALUE="-05-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, for the election of a committee for the purpose of determining on the propriety of the subjects and situations of the monuments to be erected in St. Paul's cathedral, by order of parliament; when Messrs. West, Hamilton, Nollekins, Banks, Dance, and sir William Chambers, were chosen, who, with the president of the Royal Academy for the time being, were invested by the lord chancellor, the archbishop of Canterbury, the bishop of London, and the dean and chapter, with the sole power of adjudging situations. 
<p>On the night of the <datestruct VALUE="-05-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, there was an alarming insurrection in the King's-bench prison; an attempt being made by the greater part of the prisoners to escape. Much mischief was done to <pb id="p.108" n="108"> the inner part of the building, and the outer door would have been forced, had not a party of horse and foot arrived, very opportunely to restore order, which they effected, happily without bloodshed, before <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock. The principals in this riot were removed to Newgate on the following day. 
<p>The right of the liverymen to be exempted from the operation of press-warrants, was again discussed, on the <datestruct VALUE="-06-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, in the court of Common-pleas, in the case of <num value="2">two</num> of the livery, who, having been impressed, were brought into court by writs of <foreign lang=la>habeas corpus</foreign>. The main question, however, was not determined; the <num value="2">two</num> men being discharged by consent, on their own recognizances, to appear on the <num value="2">second</num> day of the following term, if called upon. 
<p>A court of common council was held at Guildhall on the <datestruct VALUE="-10-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, to take into consideration a question adjourned from the former court, relative to the <num value="16">16th</num> standing order, viz. <QUOTE>That no member shall be permitted to be put in nomination as a candidate for any place of emolument, in the gift of this court, unless he shall, previously thereto, have engaged to take the <num value="1">first</num> opportunity to resign his seat, in case he prove successful.</QUOTE> After a warm debate, the court divided, when the numbers appeared to be, for retaining the standing order <num value="100">100</num>, for suspending it, <num value="39">39</num>. 
<p>The long depending cause between the magistrates of Surrey and the city of London, was argued before the court of King's-bench, on the l<num value="9">9</num>th of November, on a special verdict. The facts were that a general meeting of the justices of Surrey was held on the <datestruct VALUE="-09-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>, for the purpose of granting licenses to publicans; that the magistrates of London did not attend this meeting, but met on a subsequent day, and granted licenses to certain publicans, who had been refused them by the justices of Surrey. For this conduct the magistrates of London were indicted, and the question for the decision of the court was, <QUOTE>whether the city of London had an exclusive jurisdiction to grant licenses in the borough of Southwark, or possessed only a concurrent jurisdiction with the justices of Surrey?</QUOTE> 
<p><hi rend=italics>After</hi> the case had been argued on both sides, the court determined that the city of London had not an exclusive, but a concurrent jurisdiction, and therefore had acted illegally. This question was therefore determined against the city. 
<p>Between <num value="1">one</num> and <num value="2">two</num> o'clock, on the morning of the <datestruct VALUE="1792-01-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>, the Pantheon, in Oxford-street, was discovered to be on fire; and the flames, which issued from the painter's room, spread so rapidly through the building, that not a single article could be saved. The brilliant light from the scenery, oil, and other combustible materials, illuminated all the western parts of the metropolis: and when the roof fell in, the flames rose in <num value="1">one</num> immense column to a great height, and continuing to ascend for several minutes, formed a sublime, though fearful spectacle. The thickness and elevation of the walls prevented the conflagration from spreading to the contiguous houses. The damage was estimated at about <measure value="80000l." type=currency><num value="80000">80,000</num>l.</measure> <pb id="p.109" n="109"> 
<p>An attempt was made to set the house of commons on fire on the <datestruct VALUE="-05-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, which was happily rendered abortive by the diligence of the watchman of the house. On perceiving a smell of something burning, he communicated his suspicions to Mr. Bellamy, who caused a search to be made, and found the ceiling of a water-closet, immediately under the house, had been broken, and a pair of worsted breeches, stuffed with combustible matter, burning between the joists. But for this providential discovery, it is probable that both houses of parliament, with the whole of Westminster-hall, and the court of Requests would, from the quantity and dryness of the timber contained in them, have fallen a sacrifice to this destructive element. 
<p>During the years <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>, <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>, and <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>, the metropolis was greatly agitated by political contention. The French revolution had given a new tone to popular feeling, and associations were pretty generally formed for the purpose of obtaining a more pure representation of the people in the house of commons. The <num value="2">two</num> principal of these associations, viz. the Society of the Friends of the People, and the Corresponding Society, held their meetings in London. The former was principally composed of the most distintinguished opposers of the ministry, as members of parliament, &amp;c.; the latter, and by far the most active, included an immense number of the middle and lower classes of the people. The avowed object of these societies was parliamentary reform, though the advocates of corruption stigmatized them by the appellation of Republicans and Levellers. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-05-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct> a proclamation was issued for the suppression of seditious meetings and publications. This was followed by addresses of thanks to the king from both houses of parliament, from the lord mayor and common-council of the city, and from many other public bodies; and various informations, <hi rend=italics>ex officio</hi>, were laid by the attorney-general against the writers of presumed libels. 
<p>A very dangerous riot took place on the <num value="5">5th</num> of this month, in Mount-street, Grosvenor-square, occasioned by the apprehension of a number of servants who had assembled at a public-house in the neighbourhood to make merry on the king's birth night, by a dance. On the following morning, a mob assembled in front of the watch-house, and demanded their release, which, not being complied with, they broke the windows. In the mean time some magistrates met at the watch-house, and examined the servants, all of whom were discharged, except <num value="6">six</num>, including the publican and fiddler. The mob continuing to increase, the military were sent for, and the riot act being read, the crowd dispersed. Tranquillity appearing to be restored, the soldiers were ordered away in the afternoon. In the evening the mob assembled again, and attacked the watch-house, which they broke into and began to demolish, throwing the benches and furniture into the street. A party of guards reached the spot in time to prevent the total destruction of it, but had much difficulty <pb id="p.110" n="110"> to disperse the rabble, who proceeded immediately to the attack of a house in Audley-street, belonging to <num value="1">one</num> of the constables, where it was also necessary to require the assistance of the military, to prevent mischief. Happily the tumult ended here without bloodshed; for those who assembled on the following day appeared to have no motive but curiosity, to see the devastation of the former night. 
<p>It had been long acknowledged, that some reformation in the police of Westminster was wanted, though the mode of effecting it, so as to unite general security with general liberty, had not been agreed upon. With a view to accomplish this most difficult of the labours of the legislation, a bill was introduced into parliament, early in the month of March, in pursuance of which, regular offices were to be established for the administration of that branch of justice, which falls within the jurisdiction of a justice of peace. <num value="3">Three</num> justices to be appointed to each office, with fixed salaries, and the fees taken in all the offices to be consolidated in <num value="1">one</num> fund for the payment of them; and to annihilate that reproach to the magistracy, known by the name of trading justices, no person in the commission of the peace was to receive any fees, except at the established offices. 
<p>Some opposition was made to this bill in its progress; but as it was only proposed for an experiment, being limited in its duration, and parliament would be enabled to judge of its expediency at the expiration of the term, and continue it or not, as the result should warrant, it was passed. 
<p>The act was carried into execution on the <datestruct VALUE="-08-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, being extended to the other suburbs of the metropolis, and the following offices were appointed; viz. Queen-square, Westminster; Great Marlborough-street; Hatton-garden; Worship-street, Shoreditch; Lambeth-street, Whitechapel; High-street, Shadwell; and Union-street, Southwark. 
<p>The numerous atrocities committed in France during the progress of the Revolution, particularly in the months of August and September this year, and the total abolition of the French monarchy by a decree of the National Convention, had a vast effect on the public mind in this country. These causes led to the establishment of the famous  <QUOTE>Crown and Anchor Association:</QUOTE> <NOTE>So called from the place of its meetings, the Crown and Anchor Tavern, in the Strand.</NOTE> the avowed purpose of which was the protection of  <QUOTE>liberty and property, against the daring attempts of republicans and levellers.</QUOTE>  This society <num value="1">first</num> met on the <datestruct VALUE="-11-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, and assuming as facts, that the clubs associated for obtaining a more equal representation of the people, were, by the forms of their associations,  <QUOTE>always seditious, and very often treasonable ;</QUOTE>  and that the <QUOTE>equality of rights</QUOTE> contended for was only a pretext to cover an intended criminal  <QUOTE>equalization <pb id="p.111" n="111"> of property,</QUOTE>  proceeded to decry any alteration in the existing state of Government, and to impede the circulation of all political writings, that bore the character of free inquiry. 
<p>The means employed by the Crown and Anchor Association were not always the most honorable; yet, aided as it covertly was, by the support of administration, it quickly obtained great influence, and similar associations were formed under its patronage in many parts of the country. 
<p>Among the methods resorted to by the supporters of popular liberty, was that of propagating their opinions through the medium of debating societies, political lectures, &amp;c. wherein, although the nominal subject might relate to some event in the ancient history of Greece or Rome, or the more recent transactions of France, the deductions were generally allusive to the actual state of affairs in Great Britain. Such a meeting was publicly announced to be held at the King's Arms tavern, in Cornhill, on the evening of the <datestruct VALUE="-11-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>; yet, when the orators and their auditory assembled, they found the staircase in the occupation of a number of peace-officers, who refused them admission into the debating-room. This occasioned some slight tumult; but, by the exertions of the lord mayor, sir James Sanderson, who attended with the city marshals, the crowd was prevailed on to depart. At a full meeting of the common council, held a few days afterwards, sir James received the thanks of the court for his conduct on this occasion; though it was thought by many to be an arbitrary stretch of magisterial power. 
<p>At the same court was also passed the following resolutions:-- 
<p>I. That it is the duty of all corporations to preserve their fidelity to their sovereign, to be watchful for the safety of the sacred constitution of the country, and to maintain, to the utmost of their power, the peace, the property, and the personal security of every freeman living under its protection; as it is equally the duty of every freeman to bear true allegiance to the king, and be obedient to the existing laws of the land. 
<p>II. That this corporation, regarding the blessings which the subjects of the British empire enjoy, under the present mild and happy government, as inestimable, will strengthen its exertions by every possible means, to suppress all unlawful and seditious assemblies within this city, and to bring to justice every disturber of the public tranquillity. 
<p>III. That this corporation, in the most solemn manner, doth hereby call upon every good citizen to co-operate with them to the same salutary end; to discourage every attempt which may be made to excite the fears of the metropolis, by weak and designing men; and each in his own person, to be ready at all times to accompany and assist the magistrates of the city in the suppression of every tumult. 
<p>IV. That this court doth remind their constituents, the freemen <pb id="p.112" n="112"> of London, of the oath by which they are bound, to this purpose; viz. the <num value="1">first</num>, <num value="2">second</num>, and last clauses of a freeman's oath. <QUOTE>Ye shall swear that ye shall be good and true to our sovereign lord king George. Obeysant and obedient ye shall be to the mayor and ministers of the city. Ye shall also keep the king's peace in your own person. Ye shall know no gatherings, conventicles, nor conspiracies, made against the king's peace, but ye shall warn the mayor thereof, or let it to your power.</QUOTE> 
<p>V. That it be recommended to the aldermen and common-council, in their respective wards, to consider of the best means of preserving tranquillity, and of securing obedience to the laws. 
<p>VI. That these resolutions be printed in all the public papers of the united kingdoms, signed by the town-clerk. 
<p>The apprehensions of some sudden insurrection was at this time so strong among the friends of administration, that it was thought expedient to make great preparations for the defence of the Tower, by opening entrenchments, raising parapets, and mounting cannon on the walls. All the breaches were filled up; and, on the west side of the Tower, some hundreds of old rum-puncheons, filled with earth, were placed as a barricade. At the same time the Bank was double guarded; the villages, in the environs of the capital, were filled with soldiery, sufficient to protect the lives and property of the inhabitants of the metropolis, in case of a sudden alarm; and the court of lieutenancy of the city ordered a company of the London militia to be constantly on duty at the Artillery-house, night and day, to be ready at a moment's notice, in case of a disturbance. 
<p>In this ferment , the merchants, bankers, traders, and other inhabitants of London, thought it necessary to come forward, with a public declaration of their firm attachment to the constitution, and of their resolution to support the same. A meeting, for this purpose, was accordingly held, on the <datestruct VALUE="-12-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, at Merchant Taylors'-hall, which was attended by upwards of <num value="3000">three thousand</num> persons; when, the declaration being twice read, and unanimously agreed to, was left at the hall, for receiving the signatures of all the above descriptions who should approve of it. In a few days it was signed by upwards of <num value="8000">eight thousand</num> persons of the <num value="1">first</num> consequence in the metropolis. 
<p>This declaration, and similar resolutions entered into by the capitalists and principal corporate bodies in the kingdom, mainly contributed to plunge the country into that ruinous and expensive war, the fatal effects of which are felt to the present time. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-12-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, the trial of Thomas Paine, for sedition, in writing and publishing the <num value="2">second</num> part of the <QUOTE>Rights of Man,</QUOTE> was brought on before lord Kenyon and a special jury, at Guildhall; and a verdict of guilty having been given, the defendant was subsequently outlawed, he having recently left the country to go to France, where he had been elected a member of the National Convention. <pb id="p.113" n="113"> 
<p>Early in <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>, the Alien Act was passed; in <num value="1">one</num> of the debates on which, in the house of commons, much effect was produced by the theatrical oratory of Mr. Burke, who drew a concealed dagger from his coat, and threw it with great violence on the floor; falsely affirming, that <num value="3000">three thousand</num> of those weapons had been ordered at Birmingham, for the purpose of assassination. 
<p>During the months of December and January, several attempts were made by Monsieur Chauvelin to renew the political intercourse between Great Britain and France, which had been suspended from the preceding August, when the French king, Louis the Sixteenth, was imprisoned by his subjects. The administration, however, refused to acknowledge him in his new character of minister plenipotentiary from the republic of France; and on the <datestruct VALUE="-01-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>, <num value="3">three</num> days after the decapitation of Louis, Chauvelin was ordered to quit the kingdom. On the very eve of his departure, Monsieur Marat, under secretary for foreign affairs in France, arrived in England, with enlarged powers, but he also was hastily ordered to leave the kingdom, without being permitted to open the object of his mission. These circumstances, with the warlike preparations in the British ports, &amp;c. leaving no doubt as to the intentions of the British ministry, the French republic, on the <datestruct VALUE="-02-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, declared itself  <QUOTE>at war with the king of England.</QUOTE>  
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-02-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, the court of common council presented an address to his majesty, <QUOTE>thanking him for his paternal care in the preservation of the public tranquility, and assuring him of the readiness and determination of his faithful citizens to support the honor of his crown and the welfare of his kingdoms, against the ambitious designs of France,</QUOTE> &amp;c. Previous to this, a bounty of <measure value="50s." type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> shillings</measure> to every able seaman, and <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure> to every able landsman who should enter the navy at Guildhall was voted out of the city chamber, in addition to the bounties given by the king. 
<p>The commencement of the war was marked by great distress in the commercial world, and the number of bankruptcies which took place within a few months, as well in the other principal trading towns as in the metropolis itself, was unprecedented. Through the general stagnation of trade and credit, a vast number of families were reduced to beggary, and the consequences would have been still more deplorable, had not the legislature interfered, and enabled his majesty to institute a commission, under which  <QUOTE> exchequer bills, to the amount of <num value="5">five</num> millions, were directed to be issued, for the assistance and accommodation of such persons as might apply to the commissioners, and give proper security for the sums to be advanced for a time to be limited.</QUOTE>  This measure was chiefly founded on the recommendation of a committee of <num value="11">eleven</num> of the principal merchants of London, who met at the Mansion-house on the <datestruct VALUE="-04-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>. <pb id="p.114" n="114"> 
<p>During the progress of this year, numerous prosecutions were carried on, under the direction of the Attorney General, against divers persons in the metropolis and elsewhere, for seditious libels and expressions; yet the issue was not always favourable to the government, and more dissatisfaction, perhaps, was excited by the attempts made to fetter the liberty of the press and the right of free discussion, than could have resulted from the licence complained of in these proceedings. In the month of November, the city voted <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">500</num>l.</measure> towards supplying the British troops on the continent with warm clothing and other necessaries, during the winter; and ward committees were also appointed to receive subscriptions for the same humane purpose. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-12-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, the whole range of warehouses, at Hawley's-wharf, near Hermitage-bridge, Wapping, was destroyed by fire, together with several adjoining houses, and <num value="3">three</num> vessels, with other small craft, that were lying in the dock; great quantities of sugar, rum, and hemp were destroyed; of the sugar, nearly <datestruct value="1400--"><year reg="1400">1400</year></datestruct> casks were melted by the intense heat, into <num value="1">one</num> mass, and flowed through the streets in a bright stream of liquid fire. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1794-02-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>, a dreadful accident happened at the little theatre, in the Haymarket, through the pressure of the crowd, who had assembled in great numbers, in consequense of the play on that night having been commanded by their majesties. On opening the pit-door, the rush was so strong, that a number of persons were thrown down, and those that immediately followed were carried over them, by the irresistible pressure from behind; so that many, who were literally trampling their fellow-creatures to death, had it not in their power to avoid the mischief they were doing. The cries of the dying and the maimed were truly shocking; and before the confusion could be remedied, <num value="15">fifteen</num> persons were deprived of life, and upwards of <num value="20">twenty</num> others materially injured, by bruises and broken limbs. Most of the sufferers were respectable characters; among the dead were Benjamin Pingo, esq. York Herald, and J. C. Brooke, esq. Somerset Herald. 
<p>The alarm which had been so zealously spread by the ministry and their partizans, in the latter end of the year <datestruct value="1792"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>, concerning the traitorous conspiracies of the democratic societies in England, had for some time been suffered to subside; but in the spring and summer of <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>, they were again excited into new consistency and strength. Government, indeed, seemed now determined to try its power, and to check the influence of adverse opinion by the edge of the sword.<NOTE><BIBL>Brayley's History of London, i. <num value="555">555</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-05-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, Mr. William Stone, a coal-merchant of Rutland-place, Thames-street, was apprehended, and, after several examinations before the privy-council, he was committed to <pb id="p.115" n="115"> Newgate, on a charge of high treason. On the <num value="12">12th</num>, Mr. Daniel Adams, formerly clerk in the auditor's office, secretary to the Society for Constitutional Information; and Mr. Thomas Hardy, a shoemaker in Piccadilly, who had acted as secretary to the London Corresponding Society, were apprehended for treasonable practices, and had all their books and papers seized. On the same day, a message from the king was brought down to the house of commons, stating that <QUOTE>seditious practices had been carried on by certain societies in London, in correspondence with other societies; that they had lately been pursued with increasing activity and boldness, and been avowedly directed to the assembling of a pretended general convention of the people, in contempt and defiance of the authority of parliament, on principles subversive of the existing law and constitution, and tending to introduce that system of anarchy prevailing in France; that his majesty had given orders for seizing the books and papers of these societies, which were to be laid before the house; and that it was recommended to the house to consider them, and to pursue such measures as were necessary, in order to prevent their pernicious tendency.</QUOTE> On the following day, the voluminous papers which had been seized, but which chiefly consisted of the original copies of resolutions and proceedings that had long been known to the public, were referred to a committee of secresy, which, on the <num value="16">16th</num>, made their <num value="1">first</num> report, wherein it was stated, generally, that <QUOTE>It had appeared to the committee, that a plan had been digested and acted upon, and was then in forwardness for its execution, the object of which was to assemble a pretended convention of the people, for the purposes of assuming the character of a general representation of the nation, superseding the representative capacity of the house, and arrogating the legislative power of the country at large.</QUOTE> On these, and other grounds specified in the report, the premier, Mr. Pitt, recommended the suspension of the 
<foreign lang=la>Habeas Corpus</foreign> act, and moved for leave to bring in a bill for that purpose. This was vehemently opposed by the leading members of opposition, who ridiculed the idea of a treasonable conspiracy; and Mr. Sheridan expressly declared his belief,  <QUOTE>not only that no treasonable practices existed in the country, and that ministers and their friends knew this to be the case;</QUOTE>  but that the measures they were now pursuing, <QUOTE>was to create some new cause f panic, to gain a continuation of power over the people.</QUOTE>  It was determined, however, that the suspension should take place, and the ministry, having thus freed themselves from the principal bar to despotic rule, proceeded with their arrests. In the course of the week, the celebrated John Horne Tooke, esq. the Rev. Jeremiah Joyce, private secretary to lord Stanhope, Mr. John Thelwall, a political lecturer, and Messrs. Bonney, Richter, and Lovett were all apprehended on charges of high treason, and conveyed to <pb id="p.116" n="116"> the Tower, strongly guarded. Various other persons were also arrested, and were confined in different prisons. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-05-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, the French colours which had been taken on the surrender of Martinique, and had been previously brought to St. James's palace, were, by the command of the king, deposited in St. Paul's cathedral, to which they were carried, in a military procession, by <num value="29">twenty-nine</num> serjeants, escorted by detachments of the horse and foot guards. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-06-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, intelligence arrived of the memorable victory obtained by lord Howe, on the <num value="1">1st</num>, over the French fleet, and, on the <num value="3">three</num> following nights, the metropolis was illuminated with great splendour. Almost immediately afterwards, a subscription was opened at Lloyd's Coffee-house, for the relief of the wounded on board the British fleet, and for the widows and children of those who had fallen in the battle. The subscriptions soon amounted to a vast sum, towards which, the proprietors of Drury lane theatre, gave a clear benefit, producing upwards of <measure value="1200l." type=currency><num value="1200">1200</num>l.</measure> and the city <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">500</num>l.</measure> The freedom of the city, in a gold box of <num value="100">one hundred</num> guineas value, was also voted to the gallant Howe by the court of common council. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-07-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, about <num value="3">three</num> o'clock in the afternoon, a dreadful fire broke out at Cock-hill, Ratcliffe, which, in its progress, consumed more houses than any <num value="1">one</num> conflagration since the great fire of London, in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>. It was occasioned by the boiling over of a pitch kettle, at a barge-builder's, from whose warehouses it communicated to a large barge laden with salt-petre, and from that to the salt-petre warehouses belonging to the East India company. The scene now became dreadful; the wind blowing strong from the south directed the flames towards Ratcliffe High-street; which being narrow, took fire on both sides, which prevented the engines from being of any service. From hence, it extended towards Stepney, until, having reached an open space of ground, it stopped for want of materials to consume. About <num value="10">ten</num> o'clock at night, its devastations on the side next Limehouse were checked by the great exertions of the firemen and inhabitants. It was a very remarkable circumstance, that an extensive building, the dwelling-house of a Mr. Bere, standing almost in the centre of the conflagration, remained uninjured, not even a single pane of glass being cracked. On making a survey of the extent of the damage, it appeared that, out of <num value="1200">one thousand two hundred</num> houses of which the hamlet consisted, not more than <num value="570">five hundred and seventy</num> were preserved from the destructive element. About <num value="400">four hundred</num> families were deprived of their all, and thrown on the public benevolence. In this distress, government sent <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> tents from the Tower, which were pitched in an enclosed piece of ground, adjoining to Stepney church-yard, for the reception of <pb id="p.117" n="117"> the sufferers, and provisions were distributed among them from the vestry. A subscription was also immediately opened at Lloyd's coffee-house for their relief; and some of the gentlemen in the neighbourhood attended at the avenues leading to the desolated scene, for the purpose of solicting the benevolence of those whom curiosity might lead to witness the distresses of their fellow-creatures; and it may be recorded among the instances of universal charity peculiar to this nation, that the collection from the visitants on the Sunday following, amounted to upwards of <measure value="800l." type=currency><num value="800">eight hundred</num> pounds</measure>; <measure value="426l." type=currency><num value="426">four hundred and twenty-six</num> pounds</measure> of which was in copper, and <measure value="38l." type=currency><num value="38">thirty-eight</num> pounds</measure> <measure value="14s." type=currency><num value="14">fourteen</num> shillings</measure> in farthings. The total sum collected was upwards of <measure value="16000l." type=currency><num value="16000">sixteen thousand</num> pounds</measure>. 
<p>The oldest inhabitant of London never witnessed so dreadful a storm as that which took place on the <datestruct VALUE="-08-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, about <num value="4">four</num> o'clock in the afternoon. The rain fell in torrents, and was accompanied by long and tremendous peals of thunder, and vivid flashes of lightning. <num value="1">One</num> of these was seen to come down and strike the street on the east side of Temple-bar, producing an effect similar to an explosion of gunpowder; every particle of straw, mud, and even the water, being completely swept from the pavement, while the houses on both sides of the street were violently shaken, and the doors of some of them forced open: fortunately, the rain had driven every person from the street. Among other damage done by the violence of this storm, the centre beam of the roof of Lloyd's coffee-house was split, and great part of the ceiling fell into the coffee-room, followed by a torrent of rain, which in a few minutes covered the whole floor. Many balls of fire fell in the streets, particularly at the west end of the town, by which several people were thrown down, but only <num value="1">one</num> person was killed. 
<p>About the middle of August, the metropolis was, for several days, a scene of great confusion, in consequence of the accidental death of an unfortunate man, who had been inveigled into a house in Johnson's court, Charing-cross, kept for the double purpose of debauchery and recruiting. This house had communications by secret avenues with <num value="5">five</num> others, all of which were in the occupation of a wretched female, called Mrs. Hanna, whose inmates frequently alarmed the neighbourhood by the cries of violence and murder. On the morning of the <num value="15">15th</num>, a young man, named George Howe, who had before been heard to cry out for mercy, <QUOTE>was seen on the roof of the house in his shirt, in apparent great agony, as if closely pursued from within; and, upon the approach of his pursuers, he threw himself in despair from the tiles, and was dashed to pieces on the flags of the court.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Plowden, Short. Hist. p. <num value="255">255</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> This event raised the indignation of the people, and a great mob began to assemble <pb id="p.118" n="118"> in the vicinity; but their threatened vengeance was for a few hours appeased by the exertions of Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Grey,<NOTE>Now Earl Grey.</NOTE> whom curiosity had attracted to the spot. The former being in the commission of the peace for Westminster, signed a warrant to search the residence of a notorious crimp, called Jaques, where a poor wretch, the son of a farmer near Maidstone, was found smothering in the height of the small-pox, in a loathsome cellar. In the evening, the crowd was, with some difficulty, dispersed by the military; but, on the next morning, the populace re-assembled, and completely gutted all the crimping houses in the court, with loud cries for vengeance against all crimps and kidnappers. They were at length driven off by a detachment of the horse guards, and in the course of the day the coroner's inquest returned a verdict on the body of Howe, of  <QUOTE>accidental death in endeavouring to escape from illegal confinement in a house of ill-fame.</QUOTE>  This was so little satisfactory to the lower classes, that, on the <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> following days, different mobs collected, and various recruiting offices in different parts of the town were assailed, and more or less demolished, accordingly as the people met with interruption from the soldiers, large bodies of whom, both of horse and foot, were now constantly patrolling the streets. At last, by the prudent exertions of the lord mayor and other magistrates, and the firm but temperate conduct of the military, the disturbance gradually subsided; and though some shots were fired, no person appears to have been particularly hurt. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-09-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>, a special commission of Oyer and Terminer was issued for the trial of the prisoners charged with high treason in May, and it was opened on the <datestruct VALUE="-10-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, at the Sessions-house, Clerkenwell. In the course of the proceedings, the grand jury found true bills against Thomas Hardy, John Horne Tooke, J. A. Bonney, Stewart Kydd, Jeremiah Joyce, Thomas Wardell, Thomas Holcroft,<NOTE>This gentleman, who had heard from public report that he was to be included in the charges for high treason, voluntarily surrendered himself whilst the grand jury was sitting.-<BIBL><hi rend=italics>Brayley's Hist. of London, i.</hi> <num value="560">560</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> John Richter, Matthew Moore, John Thelwall, R. Hodson, John Baxter, and John Martin. 
<p>Whilst these affairs were in progress, a new alarm was excited by the rumours of a base conspiracy to assassinate the king by means of a poisoned arrow, which, according to the information of an infamous and perjured wretch, named Upton, was to have been blown through a hollow brass tube, inserted in a walking-stick. The poison with which the dart was to have been envenomed was to be of such a subtile and powerful nature, that the slightest wound would occasion death. John Peter Le Maitre, a watchmaker's apprentice; William Higgins, an apprentice to a chemist; and <num value="1">one</num> Smith, who kept a book-stall, were the <num value="3">three</num> <pb id="p.119" n="119"> persons implicated by Upton, (who was also a watchmaker, and a very ingenious though vicious man) and after a long investigation before the privy council, they were committed to prison. That some idle conversation in respect to public affairs had passed among the persons thus charged, there is reason to believe; but that there was the slightest attempt made to fabricate a plot of this kind, unless by the informer himself, was never proved. Certainly nothing appeared in evidence to justify the tale; for when Le Maitre was to have been tried, Upton could not be found, and it was said that he was accidentally drowned in the Thames a day or <num value="2">two</num> previous; but the greater probability is, that he did not dare to appear. After a close confinement for some months, the <num value="3">three</num> prisoners were liberated; and thus ended the <num value="1">first</num> part of the famous Pop-gun plot.<NOTE><BIBL>Brayley's London, i. <num value="561">561</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-10-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, <num value="9">nine</num> of the persons against whom bills for high treason had been found, were arraigned at the Old Bailey; and, on the <num value="3">third</num> day following, the trial of Thomas Hardy was commenced. After a laborious investigation of <num value="8">eight</num> days, in which all the eloquence of the attorney and solicitor-generals,<NOTE>Sir John Scott (now Lord Eldon) and sir John Mitford.</NOTE> aided by a vast mass of papers, and strengthened by the testimony of hired spies, was exhausted to criminate the prisoners, the jury pronounced a verdict of Not Guilty. The effect of this verdict in removing the gloom which had spread over the country at the continued efforts of government to govern by despotic power, was most remarkable. In the metropolis, the news flew with a sort of electric rapidity, and all ranks seemed to participate in the sentiment, that the liberties of Britain could never be effectually destroyed, whilst the invaluable privilege of <QUOTE> trial by jury</QUOTE>  was still maintained inviolable. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-11-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, John Horne Tooke was brought to trial. The proceedings lasted nearly <num value="6">six</num> days: the evidence was similar to what had been offered against Hardy, and the issue was the same. These defeats led to the liberation, on <datestruct VALUE="-12-1"><month reg="12">December</month> the <day reg=1>first</day></datestruct>, of Bonney, Joyce, Kydd, and Holcroft; yet the ministry determined on making <num value="1">one</num> more attempt to secure a victim, and on the same day was begun the trial of John Thelwall, who, in his political lectures, had been known to employ some very strong language against the measures of government. Here, however, they were again foiled; and a <num value="3">third</num> verdict of  <QUOTE>not guilty</QUOTE>  shamed them into a feeling of the moral turpitude which must accompany any further attempts to sacrifice men's lives on charges so repeatedly proved to be ill-founded. Those in custody for treasonable practices were therefore discharged on different days, and the commission itself was finally dissolved in January. 
<p>During the continuance of the proceedings on these trials, the <pb id="p.120" n="120"> strongest agitation prevailed among the people, yet by the judicious conduct of the city magistracy, tranquillity was effectually preserved through the exertions of the civil power alone. Every day the vicinity of the Old Bailey was crowded by a countless multitude, and the counsel on the popular side, Messrs. Erskine<NOTE>The late lord Erskine.</NOTE> and Gibbs<NOTE>The late sir Vicary Gibbs, and attorney-general.</NOTE> were drawn to their homes in triumph. The popular joy on the acquittal of the prisoners was displayed by loud and reiterated acclamations, and even the interior of the court itself partook of the general feeling. 
<p>In the course of the <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> preceding years, the minds of the credulous part of the public had been much disturbed by the prophecies of <num value="1">one</num> Richard Brothers, who had been a lieutenant in the navy, and whose writings, founded on erroneous explanations of the scriptures, had made so much noise, that government judged it expedient to interfere, and on the <datestruct VALUE="1795-03-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>, he was apprehended at his lodgings in Paddington-street, under a warrant from the secretary of state, grounded on the <num value="15">15th</num> of Elizabeth, in which he stood charged with  <QUOTE>unlawfully, maliciously, and wickedly writing, printing, and publishing various fantastical prophecies, with intent to create dissentions and other disturbances within this realm, and other of the king's dominions, contrary to the statute,</QUOTE>  &amp;c. Among other extravagancies promulgated by Mr. Brothers, he styled himself the  <QUOTE>nephew of God,</QUOTE>  and predicted the destruction of all sovereigns, the downfall of the naval power of Great Britain, and the restoration of the Jews, who, under him as their prince and deliverer, were to be re-seated at Jerusalem. All these events were to be accomplished by the year <datestruct value="1798"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>. After a long examination before the privy council, in which Mr. Brothers persisted in the divinity of his legation, he was committed into the custody of a state messenger. On the <num value="27">27th</num>, he was declared a lunatic, by a jury appointed under a commission, on a writ <foreign lang=la>de Lunatico inquirendo</foreign>, and assembled at the King's Arms, in Palace-yard. He was subsequently removed to a private mad-house at Islington, where he was kept till the year <datestruct value="1806"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, when he was discharged by the authority of the lord chancellor Erskine. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1795-01-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>, <num value="2">two</num> vessels, cut from their moorings by the large bodies of ice drifting in the river, were driven with such force against London-bridge by the tide, that <num value="1">one</num> of them, a large West Indiaman, carried away all her masts against the balustrades of the bridge, knocked down <num value="2">two</num> of the lamps, bending the irons in an astonishing manner; and, with a crash that shook the whole fabric, passed through the centre arch with incredible velocity, and drifted up the river to Blackfriar's bridge, which she also went through, and continued her course till she came above Somerset-house, where she drove on shore, and was <pb id="p.121" n="121"> secured. The crew, perceiving their danger, took to the boat a few minutes before she reached the bridge. The other vessel struck against the starlings of <num value="1">one</num> of the smaller arches, and did not go through. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-04-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, the marriage of his royal highness the prince of Wales with the princess Caroline of Brunswick, was solemnized at the chapel-royal, St. James's, in the presence of their majesties, the princes and princesses, the state officers, &amp;c. In the evening the metropolis was partially illuminated. 
<p>On the <num value="23">23rd</num> of this month, the long depending trial, in Westminster-hall, of Warren Hastings, esq. who had been impeached by the house of commons for  <QUOTE> high crimes and misdemeanours,</QUOTE>  whilst governor-general of India, was brought to a conclusion; and he was declared  <QUOTE>not guilty</QUOTE>  by a considerable majority of the few peers (only <num value="29">twenty-nine</num>) that voted. The proceedings had began on the <datestruct VALUE="1788-02-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct>, and continued by successive adjournments through every sessions of parliament to the above time; so that upwards of <num value="7">seven</num> years and <num value="2">two</num> months had elapsed before the end of the trial; a circumstance unparallelled in the annals of judicature. 
<p>About the middle of July, fresh tumults were excited in the metropolis by the rashness of a fifer, named John Lewis, who, having been refused liquor at the King's Arms, Charing-cross, (then deprived of its licence) and turned out of the house for his insulting behaviour, raised an immense crowd round the door, by falsely asserting, that  <QUOTE>his companion had just been kidnapped, and was then chained down in the cellar, with <num value="3">three</num> others; whence they were to be conveyed away by a secret door, that communicated with the Thames.</QUOTE>  This tale was so fully credited by the mob, that, notwithstanding the house was submitted to search, and nothing of the kind discovered, all the furniture was destroyed or carried off, before the military could disperse the rioters. Lewis, however, was taken into custody by some persons who had witnessed his improper conduct. 
<p>On the <num value="2">two</num> following days, a mob again assembled at Charing-cross and in St. George's fields, where they partly demolished the recruiting offices, and made bonfires of the furniture. They were at last dispersed by the horse guards, who, after enduring a great deal of insult, were forced to ride their horses among them, by which several were trampled on and severely wounded; and some of the more active rioters were apprehended. On the succeeding morning, another great multitude collected, and several parts of the town were threatened with disturbances; but the judicious distribution of the soldiery had the effect of intimidation, and the tumult ceased without the necessity of using particular violence. The unfortunate instigator of these disorders was afterwards capitally convicted for the offence, and was hanged at Newgate <pb id="p.122" n="122"> in November: some other persons also suffered for participating in them. 
<p>In the afternoon of the <datestruct VALUE="-09-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>, the beautiful church of St. Paul, Covent-garden, was destroyed by fire. The neighbouring buildings were with difficulty preserved, as the heat thrown out by the flames, which arose from the interior of the building in a vast pyramid, was most intense. Nothing was saved but the communion plate. This accident was occasioned by the negligence of some plumbers, who had been employed in finishing the lead work of the new cupola, the whole edifice having just undergone a complete repair. 
<p>The general dearness of provisions, and particularly of bread in the summer and autumn of this year, occasioned various meetings of the privy council, and of corporate and other bodies, through whose recommendations the consumption of the finer sorts of flour was somewhat reduced. Subscriptions for the relief of the necessitous were also opened; and the court of common council gave <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1000</num>l.</measure> to be distributed among the industrious poor in the different wards of the city. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-10-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, an assemblage of the people was convened in a field between Pancras church and Copenhagen-house, by the London Corresponding Society, for the purpose of preparing an address and remonstrance to his majesty on the subjects of peace and parliamentary reform. The meeting consisted of between <num value="40">forty</num> and <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> persons, and every thing was conducted with propriety and good order; yet the effervescence thus excited among the populace was most probably the immediate cause of a most daring attack upon the king's person, made <num value="3">three</num> days afterwards, when the sovereign went, as customary, to open the parliament. A strange rumour, that a riot was likely to take place, had been industriously circulated, and this contributed greatly to increase the multitude of spectators; so much so, indeed, that the numbers assembled in St. James's park, and its leading avenues, were computed at about <num value="200000">200,000</num>. Instead of the loud huzzas which generally greeted the king in his way to the parliament-house, the predominant exclamations on this day were <QUOTE>Peace! Peace!-Give us bread!-No Pitt!-No Famine!-no war!</QUOTE> --and a few voices were heard to exclaim, <QUOTE>Down with George!</QUOTE> or words to that effect. As the procession advanced along the park, and in Parliament-street, the clamours of the mob were mingled with indecent hissings and hootings, and several stones were thrown at the royal carriage, <num value="1">one</num> of the glass pannels of which was at length perforated by a stone or bullet, near the ordnance office, in St. Margaret-street. Similar outrages attended the king's return from the house of lords; and though the gates of the Horse Guards had been shut to exclude the mob, great numbers had procured access by the other passages, and by them <pb id="p.123" n="123"> the insults and reviling were kept up till his majesty alighted at St. James's. The state coach was afterwards attacked by the populace with stones and bludgeons, on its way through Pall Mall to the Mews, and almost demolished. 
<p>After the king had remained a little time at St. James's palace, he proceeded in his private carriage to Buckingham-house, without any military escort, and attended only by <num value="2">two</num> footmen. In this unprotected state, he was again beset by a gang of ruffians, who, before the carriage could get through the Mall, attempted to force open the door; but the king's footmen having beckoned to a party of the horse guards, which was fortunately in sight, the guards galloped up, relieved the sovereign from his new danger, and conducted him in safety to the queen's palace. 
<p>This atrocious attack, whether it was really the consequence of a premeditated design, or whether, as the greater probability is, it merely resulted from the ebullition of the moment, awakened the strongest feelings of abhorrence throughout the country; and his majesty received addresses on the occasion from both houses of parliament, from the city of London, and from numerous other bodies in all parts of the kingdom. <num value="3">Three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> persons who had been most active in hooting the sovereign, were taken into custody on the day of the tumult; but the proffered reward of <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1000</num>l.</measure> offered by a royal proclamation, failed in bringing to justice any of the rabble who had personally insulted the king. 
<p>The trial of Kyd Wake, <num value="1">one</num> of the gang who followed his majesty's coach on the <num value="1">first</num> day of the sessions, hissing and otherwise insulting him, came on in the court of king's-bench, on the <datestruct VALUE="1796-02-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>, when the facts charged in the indictment being fully proved, the jury, without hesitation, returned a verdict of guilty. The judgment of the court, which was pronounced on the <num value="1">first</num> day of the next term, was, to be imprisoned and kept to hard labour in Gloucester gaol for <num value="5">five</num> years, and to stand on the pillory in <num value="1">one</num> of the public streets of Gloucester, on a market-day, within the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="3">three</num> months of his imprisonment, at the expiration of which, he was to find security for <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">one thousand</num> pounds</measure>, for his good behaviour for <num value="10">ten</num> years. 
<p>At a court of common council, held on the <datestruct VALUE="-04-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, the sum of <measure value="200l." type=currency><num value="200">two hundred</num> pounds</measure> was voted to that excellent institution, the Humane Society. 
<p>On the <num value="29">29th</num> and <datestruct VALUE="1796-01-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>, Mr. William Stone, coal-merchant, was tried in the court of King's Bench, for high treason, in corresponding with his brother in France, &amp;c. when a verdict of not guilty was returned, to the complete satisfaction of a crowded assembly. 
<p>In the course of May, this year, the last part of the Pop-gun plot was played off, by the trial of Richard Thomas Crossfield, a surgeon, who had been implicated in the charge of intending to <pb id="p.124" n="124"> assassinate the king; but after an investigation of <num value="2">two</num> days at the sessions-house, in the Old Bailey, he was declared not guilty. Le Maitre, Smith, and Higgins, who, after the apprehension of Crossfield, had been re-committed to prison in rather an unprecedented manner, were finally liberated, without trial, on the <num value="19">19th</num> of this month. 
<p>At a court of common council held on the <datestruct VALUE="-09-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>, a committee was appointed <QUOTE>to take into consideration the high price of flour, whilst grain was cheap, and to make a speedy return of the best means of removing so oppressive an evil.</QUOTE> This measure was founded on the relative prices of wheat and flour in London, at different periods, viz. in <datestruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct>, when wheat was <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">40</num>s.</measure> <num value="9.75">9 3/4</num>d a quarter, and flour <measure value="36s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="36">36</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure>; in <datestruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></datestruct>, when wheat was sold at at <measure value="41s." type=currency><num value="41">41</num>s.</measure> <measure value="1.25d." type=currency><num value="1.25">1 1/4</num> d.</measure> and flour at <measure value="32s." type=currency><num value="32">32</num>s.</measure> <measure value="11.50d." type=currency><num value="11.50">11 1/2</num>d.</measure>; and in <datestruct VALUE="1796-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>, when wheat was <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">40</num>s.</measure> <measure value="3.75d." type=currency><num value="3.75">3 3/4</num>d.</measure> and the price charged for flour <measure value="50s." type=currency><num value="50">50</num>s.</measure> 
<p>Among the measures resorted to by the ministers to meet the increasing exigences of the government, toward the close of this year, was that of a voluntary loan of <measure value="18000000l." type=currency><num value="18000000">18,000,000</num>l.</measure> sterling; and such was the success of this scheme, that though it was only communicated on the <datestruct VALUE="-12-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct> to the lord mayor, with a request that he would make it known to the corporation and public companies, the subscriptions were made with such eagerness, that the books, which had been opened at the Bank<NOTE><measure value="100000l." type=currency><num value="100000">One hundred thousand</num> pounds</measure> towards the loan was subscribed by the Bank, in its corporate capacity.</NOTE> were closed within <num value="4">four</num> days; and though <measure value="100000l." type=currency><num value="100000">100,000</num>l.</measure> was voted by the court of common council on the <num value="5">5th</num>, in the afternoon, it was only by  <QUOTE>especial indulgence</QUOTE>  that this subscription was admitted. At this period, the sentiments of the livery and of the common council were decidedly hostile; and whilst the former, on the <num value="14">14th</num>, assembled in Guildhall, and instructed their representatives to vote  <QUOTE>a censure upon ministers, for sending money to the emperor of Germany, during the sitting, and without the consent of parliament ;</QUOTE>  the latter, on the <num value="21">21st</num>, resolved, that <QUOTE>the pecuniary aid so furnished to the emperor had been productive of great advantage to Great Britain, and given a decided and favourable turn to the war!</QUOTE> 
<p>The beginning of the year <datestruct value="1797"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct> was distinguished by the extraordinary circumstance of the stoppage of Bank payments in 
<hi rend=italics>specie</hi>, a measure rendered necessary by the alarming state of public affairs, which had caused such a demand for cash that it was feared a sufficiency would not be left for the emergencies of government, unless further issues were restricted. 
<p>The leading causes of this unprecedented event originated in the great advances that had been made to government, during the years <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg=1795>1795</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1796--"><year reg=1796>1796</year></datestruct>, on the security of Treasury bills, and which fluctuated from about <measure value="800000l." type=currency><num value="800000">eight hundred thousand</num> pounds</measure> to upwards <pb id="p.125" n="125"> of <num value="2">two</num> millions and a half sterling, besides other advances under different heads, which made the entire sum amount to more than <measure value="10672000l." type=currency><num value="10672000">10,672,000</num>l.</measure> The remittances that had been sent during the war to the emperor of Germany, and other foreign powers, were found to press so heavily upon the Bank, that as early as <datestruct VALUE="1796-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>, the court of directors informed the chancellor of the exchequer that it was their wish  <QUOTE> that he would arrange his finances for the year in such a manner, as not to depend on any further assistance from them.</QUOTE>  Similar remonstrances were made in April and June, and on the <datestruct VALUE="-10-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, the directors addressed a written paper to the minister, which concluded by stating  <QUOTE>the absolute necessity which they conceived to exist for diminishing the sum of their present advances to government, the last having been granted with great reluctance on their part, on his pressing solicitations.</QUOTE>  On the <num value="23">23rd</num> of the same month, in an interview which took place with the chancellor of the exchequer, on the loans to the emperor being mentioned, the governor of the Bank assured Mr. Pitt,  <QUOTE> that another loan of that sort would go nigh to ruin the country.</QUOTE>  In <datestruct VALUE="1796-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>, on the strong representation of the minister that without the accommodation of <measure value="800000l." type=currency><num value="800000">800,000</num>l.</measure>  <QUOTE>it would be impossible to avoid the most serious and distressing embarrassments to the public service,</QUOTE>  the Bank directors agreed to advance that sum, towards the end of August; at the same time, they expressly stated that  <QUOTE>the court granted this accommodation with great reluctance, and contrary to their wishes;</QUOTE>  and that  <QUOTE>nothing could induce them, under the present circumstances, to comply with the demand now made upon them, but the dread that their refusal might be productive of a greater evil, and nothing but the extreme pressure and emergency of the case, can in any shape justify them for acceding to this measure.</QUOTE>  On the <datestruct VALUE="1797-02-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>, Mr. Pitt hinted that it would be necessary for him to negociate a loan for Ireland in this country; and, in a subsequent conversation, on the <num value="18">18th</num>, he stated, that the sum wanted would be about <num value="1">one</num> million and a half. The governor immediately replied, that such a scheme would  <QUOTE>cause the ruin of the Bank,</QUOTE>  by the drain which it would occasion in the specie; and, on the next day, he further informed him, on the authority of the court of directors, that,  <QUOTE> under the present state of the Bank's advances to government, such a measure would threaten ruin to the house, and most probably reduce them to the necessity of shutting up its doors!</QUOTE>  
<p>During these conferences, the cash in the Bank was very rapidly lowering, partly through dread of the threatened invasion from 
<p>France which had induced the farmers and others resident in the parts distant from the metropolis, to withdraw their money from the different banking-houses in which it had been deposited. 
<p>The run, therefore (to employ the technical language of the money market) commenced upon the country banks, and the increasing <pb id="p.126" n="126"> demand for specie soon. reaching the capital, it became evident to the court of directors that, without some essential expedient, the Bank would be wholly unable to withstand the shock. In this critical moment, also, the expected invasion seemed about to take place, by the appearance of some French shipping in Cardigan Bay, and the landing, at Fishguard, of about <datestruct value="1400--"><year reg="1400">1400</year></datestruct> men, all of whom, however, surrendered at discretion, to lord Cawder, without blood-shed. 
<p>At this alarming conjuncture a message was sent to his majesty, at Windsor, to request his immediate attendance in town, to assist at a privy council, which was accordingly held at St. James's, on Sunday, <datestruct VALUE="-02-26"><month reg="02">February</month> the <day reg=26>26th</day></datestruct>, when an order was made to prohibit the directors of the Bank from <QUOTE>issuing any cash, in payment, until the sense of parliament can be taken on that subject, and the proper measures adopted thereupon for maintaining the means of circulation, and supporting the public and commercial credit of the kingdom.</QUOTE> This order was promulgated on the next morning, annexed to a notice from the Bank, stating that <QUOTE>the directors meant to continue their discounts, for the accommodation of the commercial interest, paying the amount in Bank notes, and the dividend warrants in the same manner ;</QUOTE> and further, <QUOTE>that the general concerns of the Bank were in a most affluent and prosperous situation, and such as to preclude every doubt as to the security of its notes.</QUOTE> 
<p>Notwithstanding these assurances, the metropolis, and indeed the whole kingdom, was for some days in a state of the greatest agitation, and the stoppage must have had the most fatal consequences, but for the judicious steps that were immediately taken. The merchants, bankers, &amp;c. of London, as in the year <datestruct value="1745"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct> declared their unanimous resolution to receive bank notes as cash, and to make their payments in the same manner; and many of the lords and other members of the privy council signed a similar declaration. The parliament also, which was fortunately sitting at this period, immediately proceeded to investigate the affairs of the Bank, and a secret committee was appointed by each house for that purpose. The discussions as to the policy of the measure, were particularly animated, and especially in the house of commons; but the majorities in favour of administration were always considerable. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-03-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, Mr. Pitt introduced a bill for empowering the Bank to issue notes for sums lower than <measure value="5l." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> pounds</measure>, to which amount they had hitherto been restricted; and this was passed into a law with such rapidity as to receive the royal assent on the <num value="2">second</num> day afterwards. On the same day the committee made their <num value="1">first</num> report, in which they stated, that they had examined the outstanding claims against the Bank, with the corresponding assets, and found, that on the <datestruct VALUE="-02-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, the day to which the accounts could be made up with accuracy, the total amount of demands on <pb id="p.127" n="127"> the Bank, was <measure value="13770390l." type=currency><num value="13770390">13,770,390</num>l.</measure>; and that the assets (not including the sum of <measure value="11686800l." type=currency><num value="11686800">11,686,800</num>l.</measure> of permanent debt due by government) amounted to <measure value="17597280l." type=currency><num value="17597280">17,597,280</num>l.</measure>; so that the surplus in favour of the Bank was <measure value="3826890l." type=currency><num value="3826890">3,826,890</num>l.</measure><NOTE>From a table which was given in to the house of commons, professing to show the scale of cash and bullion in the Bank, from <datestruct value="1782--"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>, it appears, that the quantity of specie remaining on <datestruct VALUE="-02-25"><month reg="02">February</month> the <day reg=25>25th</day></datestruct>, in the latter year, was less than at any former period since <datestruct VALUE="1783-12--"><month reg="12">December</month> <year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>. What the exact sum was remained hidden from the public, under certain arbitrary numbers, at least for some time; but it was at length discovered that the mean number <num value="660">660</num>, denoted <num value="4">four</num> millions; and by pursuing the calculations, and comparing the different accounts, that when the order of council was issued, the amount of the cash and bullion did not exceed <measure value="1272000l." type=currency><num value="1272000">1,272,000</num>l.</measure></NOTE> A <num value="2">second</num> report was made on the <datestruct VALUE="-03-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, in which the committee recommended that the  <QUOTE> order of council should be continued and confirmed for a time to be limited;</QUOTE>  and on this recommendation, &amp;c. an act was passed confirming the restriction, and making Bank notes a legal tender in every case, except the payment of the navy and army, which was to be continued in specie. This bill received the royal assent on the <num value="3">3</num>d of May.<NOTE><BIBL>Brayley's Hist. of London, i. <num value="573">573</num></BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>In <datestruct VALUE="1797-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>, an attempt was made by the lord mayor, Brook Watson, esq. to subject the power of convening the livery in common hall, to the authority of the court of common council; and in this manifest endeavour to violate the rights and privileges of the livery, he was assisted by <num value="3">three</num> of the city representatives, viz. sir James Sanderson, and the aldermen Curtis and Lushington. The <num value="43">forty-three</num> liverymen who signed the requisition for a meeting which led to this event, immediately addressed a paper to the mayor, stating various unanswerable arguments in defence of their inherent right; and so little was the court of common council itself inclined to invade it, that when the question came to be argued, the following motion, made by Mr. Waithman, <QUOTE>That it would be highly improper in this court to give any opinion respecting the propriety or expediency of convening a common hall,</QUOTE> was carried by a great majority. About a week afterwards, <datestruct VALUE="-03-23"><month reg="03">March</month> the <day reg=23>23</day></datestruct>d, at a very full meeting of the livery in Guildhall, it was resolved, that <QUOTE>An humble address and petition should be presented to his majesty, upon the present alarming state of public affairs, and praying him to dismiss his present ministers from his councils for ever, as the <num value="1">first</num> step towards obtaining a speedy, honourable, and permanent peace.</QUOTE> Only <num value="7">seven</num> voices opposed this resolution, out of a body of <num value="3000">three thousand</num> persons; and the petition was ordered to be presented <QUOTE>to his majesty, sitting on his throne,</QUOTE> by the lord mayor, the <num value="2">two</num> sheriffs, and the <num value="4">four</num> parliamentary representatives. When the sheriffs attended at St. James's, to know when his majesty would receive the address, they were informed by the duke of Portland, that  <QUOTE> the king would receive it at any levee, in the common form; but that his majesty received addresses on the throne from the city of London as a corporate body only.</QUOTE>  <pb id="p.128" n="128"> 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-04-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, at another common hall, the livery after hearing this answer, directed the sheriffs, attended by the city remembrancer, to wait upon the king personally, agreeably to their undoubted right as sheriffs of London, and to enquire of him when he would be pleased to  <QUOTE>receive the said address, upon the throne :</QUOTE>  they were also instructed to inform his majesty, if necessary, <QUOTE>that the lord mayor, aldermen, and livery of London cannot deliver their address in any other manner than to the king on his throne.</QUOTE> His majesty's reply was similar to that given by the duke of Portland; and he professed his readiness to receive it, provided it  <QUOTE>was presented at the levee by no more than <num value="10">ten</num> persons.</QUOTE>  When the sheriffs made their report at another common hall, held on the <num value="12">12th</num>, the livery came to the unanimous resolution, <QUOTE>That the lord mayor, aldermen, and livery of London, have from time immemorial enjoyed the right and privilege of addressing the king upon the throne, and have never before been denied that right, except under the corrupt administration which occasioned and persisted in the American war.</QUOTE> They likewise proceeded to discuss another resolution, strongly reprehensive of the measures of government; but after much altercation, the lord mayor refused to submit it to the livery, as being contrary to the precept by which the meeting had been convened, and at last, he formally dissolved the assembly. Another common hall on this subject was convened on the <datestruct VALUE="-05-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, when several strong resolutions were entered into, declaratory of the rights of the livery, and of the profligate and wanton conduct of his majesty's ministers, <QUOTE>who had evinced a disposition to sacrifice the blood, treasure, and liberties of the kingdom, in support of measures repugnant to the principles of the constitution, derogatory to the dignity and safety of the king, and inconsistent with the happiness of the people.</QUOTE> The late conduct of the lord mayor was also highly censured; but some days afterwards, a counter declaration was signed by <num value="2096">2096</num> liverymen, expressive of their disapprobation of the proceedings in the <num value="3">three</num> last common halls, &amp;c. and of their approval of the measures of government. 
<p>The war about this period had become extremely unpopular, excepting with the monied men; and on the <num value="3">3</num>d of April, a crowded assembly of the inhabitants of Westminster was held in Palace-yard, and a strong address and petition to the king unanimously voted, on the subject of the war, and the conduct of administration. <QUOTE>Your ministers,</QUOTE> said the address, <QUOTE>have tarnished the national honour and glory. They have oppressed the poor with almost intolerable burthens. They have poisoned the intercourse of private life. They have given a fatal blow to public credit. They have divided the empire, and subverted the constitution.-We humbly pray your majesty, therefore, to dismiss them from your presence and councils for ever.</QUOTE> Several peers and members of parliament attended at this meeting; and many similar ones were held in the course of the spring in various parts of the kingdom. <pb id="p.129" n="129"> 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-06-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct> a message was delivered from his majesty to both houses of parliament, on the mutiny among the seamen at the Nore, which at this time had raged for <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> days, and threatened the most serious consequences. The commerce of London was particularly obstructed by the mutineers, who acted with a boldness and determination, unparallelled in the naval history of Great Britain. Their whole force amounted to between <num value="20">twenty</num> and <num value="30">thirty</num> ships of war, mostly line of battle ships, and their proceedings were directed by a committee of delegates, <num value="2">two</num> from each ship, of which <num value="1">one</num> Richard Parker, a brave seaman, and as appears from his conduct, a man of strong natural talents, but with little education, was appointed president. Some of their demands were similar to what had been recently granted to the seamen of lord Howe's fleet at Portsmouth, but others were of a description wholly incompatible with the discipline of the navy. After a fruitless attempt, therefore, to persuade the fleet to submission, made by a deputation of the lords of the admiralty, it was determined to reduce them by force; to this end, a proclamation was issued, declaring certain ships in a state of mutiny, and an act was passed, imposing death upon any person having  <QUOTE>any wilful and advised communication</QUOTE>  with the ships' crews so declared to be mutinous. In this desperate situation, the seamen thought proper to concentrate their forces, which they did at the great Nore, where they drew up the squadron in a line. The men of war being ranged at about half a mile from each other, with their broadsides abreast. To enforce compliance with their demands, they stopped all shipping trading to and from the port of London, except colliers, neutral vessels, and a few small craft; those which were detained were obliged to cast anchor in the intervals between the line of battle ships. The appearance of such a multitude of shipping, the London trade included, under the orders of a body of mutinous seamen, formed a singular and awful spectacle. In the mean time, government made the most vigorous preparations to reduce them to a state of duty, and lest they should form the desperate scheme of standing out to sea, all the buoys from the mouth of the Thames and the adjacent coasts were removed. Both shores opposite the fleet were lined with batteries, the forts at Sheerness, Tilbury, and Gravesend were furnished with furnaces for red-hot shot, and the Neptune of <num value="98">ninety-eight</num> guns, partly manned by volunteers, raised by a subscription among the merchants of London, with other vessels and gun-boats, dropped down to Long-reach, with a view to act offensively against the mutineers. Happily, however, this last resource was unnecessary; the seamen began to feel the hopelessness of their situation, and on the night of the <datestruct VALUE="-06-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, the Repulse, the Leopard, and the Ardent separated from the rebel fleet, and submitted. Between that and the <num value="12">12th</num>, several other ships struck the red flag and hoisted the union; and the detained merchantmen were allowed to proceed on their respective destinations. On the following day, <num value="5">five</num> more <pb id="p.130" n="130"> quitted the rebel lines, and ran for protection under the forts of Sheerness; and lastly, the Sandwich surrendered: in this ship the delegates had held their meetings, and Parker, the president, with about <num value="30">thirty</num> others, was now delivered up to justice. On the <num value="22">22nd</num>, the trials of the mutineers commenced with that of Parker, before a court martial, on board the Neptune, off Greenhithe; on the <num value="4">fourth</num> day he was solemnly adjudged guilty, and a few days afterwards, he met his death with great fortitude, on board the Sandwich. He was at <num value="1">first</num> buried at Sheerness, but his wife, with some other women, having found means to obtain the body, had it conveyed to London, where the curiosity of the public leading them in crowds to view it, the magistrates were at last obliged to interfere, and by their orders it was finally deposited in Whitechapel church-yard. Many others of the mutineers were condemned to die, and all the principal ringleaders were executed; yet a considerable number remained under sentence, confined in a prison-ship in the river, till after the signal victory obtained by admiral Duncan in October, when they received his majesty's pardon.<NOTE><BIBL>Brayley's History of London, i. <num value="578">578</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The election for sheriffs on Midsummer-day, in this year, was marked by the singular circumstance of a peer offering himself a candidate for that office. From what has been said above, it will be seen that party politics ran high in the city: this election was considered, by both sides, as a criterion to judge of their comparative strength. The popular party were strengthened by the addition of the earl of Lauderdale, who had purchased his freedom a few days before, and had become a member of the Needlemakers' company, in order to qualify him to become a candidate. Mr. S. F. Waddington joined his lordship, and their pretensions were supported by those who had led the resolutions of censure against administration, and against the lord mayor, at the late common halls; but the show of hands gave them so little hope of success that no poll was demanded. 
<p>On the night of <datestruct VALUE="-07-16"><month reg="07">July</month> the <day reg=16>16th</day></datestruct>, occurred <num value="1">one</num> of the most tremendous storms of thunder, lightning and rain, ever remembered in this metropolis. The lightning commenced about <num value="9">nine</num> o'clock in the evening, and continued without intermission till <datestruct value="12"><year reg="12">twelve</year></datestruct>, illuminating with its corruscations and vivid flames of scarlet and blue light every quarter of the heavens. The thunder came on about <num value="12">twelve</num>, and continued till about half past <num value="3">three</num>, with incessant and most loud and awful peals, so near as seemingly to burst over the head, and accompanied the whole time with the heaviest and most uninterrupted falls of rain: at <num value="4">four</num> o'clock the storm had passed over, but its fury was felt in many other parts of the country, as well as on the continent. 
<p>On the <num value="31">31st</num> of this month, <num value="1">one</num> of the last public meetings of <pb id="p.131" n="131"> the London Corresponding Society, was held in the fields behind Somers-town, for the purpose of proposing a petition to the king. The multitude was extremely numerous, and <num value="3">three</num> tribunes had been erected for the accommodation of the speakers, who had called the meeting under the provisions of the late acts. The district magistrates, however, had thought proper to declare, that the assembly had not been legally convened; and though the crowd was perfectly peaceable, sir William Addington, who had surrounded the principal tribune with a large body of police officers, announced that the riot act had been read, and gave orders that several persons should be taken into custody. This was immediately done, the tribunes were knocked down, and the people began rapidly to disperse: a measure that was accelerated by the appearance of a troop of horse, which was ordered to enter the field, and galloped up and down for some time. Several other military detachments had been drawn round the neighbourhood; the West London militia were stationed in the Veterinary College, and the London and Westminster light-horse volunteers in the Foundling fields. In the evening, the persons who had been taken into custody were admitted to bail. An action was afterwards brought against sir William Addington for his conduct, but it failed through an informality in the process. 
<p>Soon after the commencement of the session of parliament in November, the emergencies of the government occasioned the minister to resort to a new mode of raising the supplies, viz. by direct contribution, and it was proposed to increase the assessed taxes to nearly a triple amount. This was strongly opposed in a common hall, held at Guildhall, on the <datestruct VALUE="-12-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, and the city representatives were instructed to prevent it passing into a law, as being  <QUOTE>partial, oppressive, arbitrary, and unconstitutional;</QUOTE>  and in its principle  <QUOTE>destructive of the dearest interests of the people, and subversive of social order.</QUOTE>  The city of Westminster, and the principal wards and parishes of the metropolis, held meetings about the same time, and came to similar resolutions. By this plan and its modifications, on which income was made the basis of taxation, a double weight was imposed upon the industrious, whilst the spendthrift and the idle were almost exempted from its effects; yet, Mr. Pitt persisted in the measure, and the bill was finally passed. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-12-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, the day appointed for a national thanksgiving, for the <num value="3">three</num> great victories obtained by lord Howe over the French, in <datestruct VALUE="1794-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>; by sir John Jarvis over the Spaniards, in <datestruct VALUE="1797-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>; and by admiral Duncan over the Dutch, in <datestruct VALUE="1797-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>; their majesties, with most of the royal family, officers of state, principal nobility, &amp;c. attended divine service at St. Paul's cathedral. The procession was extremely splendid, and was conducted with great order, notwithstanding the pressure of an immense multitude of spectators which lined the 
<p>K<num value="2">2</num> <pb id="p.132" n="132"> streets, and thronged every avenue. It began with the naval colours taken from the enemies of Britain, viz. <num value="2">two</num> from the French, <num value="3">three</num> from the Spaniards, and <num value="4">four</num> from the Dutch, mounted on artillery waggons, each attended by a party of lieutenants, who had fought in the respective engagements in which they were won. A large detachment of marines, with music followed; and after them a number of gallant admirals in carriages. Next came the speaker of the house of commons, with many of its members; the clerks of the crown, the masters in chancery, the <num value="12">twelve</num> judges, and the house of peers ranged according to etiquette, and followed by the lord chancellor; after came the royal family, in carriages drawn by caparisoned horses. At Temple-bar, the procession was joined by the lord mayor, with the sheriffs, and city deputation, gorgeously attired, who, after the ceremony of delivering up the city sword to the sovereign, rode bare-headed before the royal carriage to the cathedral church. 
<p>When the procession reached St. Paul's, the lieutenants taking the flags from the waggons, attended by the seamen and marines, divided themselves for their superiors to pass up the body of the church; and the colours were next carried in under loud huzzas, and grand martial music, to the middle of the area below the dome, where they were ranged in a circle. The princesses, with the dukes of York and Clarence, prince Ernest, and the duke of Gloucester, and their respective suites, on their alighting, remained near the great west door, within the church, to receive their majesties; the lord mayor, sheriffs, aldermen, and admirals standing opposite. The king was received by the bishops of London and Lincoln, who walked on each side his majesty, preceded by the heralds at arms, and the prebendaries of the cathedral. Her majesty, led by earl Morton, followed with her suite; and next the princes, princesses, &amp;c. in procession. On the arrival of the royal family within the circle, the colours were lowered, and their majesties were greeted with the loudest shouts and acclamations. The company then took their seats, the common council, with their ladies, being accommodated with <num value="2">two</num> spacious galleries, under the circle of the dome, and the service was began. At the end of the <num value="1">first</num> lesson, the flag officers entered in <num value="2">two</num> divisions, right and left of the king's chair, bearing the captured trophies, which were deposited in succession upon the altar. At half past <num value="2">two</num>, on a signal being given from St. Paul's, that the service was concluded, the Park guns were fired. In returning the royal cortege went <num value="1">first</num>, and fortunately the day closed without any particular accident. The military behaved with much propriety, notwithstanding the pressure of the crowd, and the whole business of the day reflected great credit on those who superintended its arrangements. The <num value="3">three</num> brigades of foot guards, with parties of the horse-guards, were stationed in a double line from St. James's to Temple-bar; within the bar to St. Paul's, the streets were lined with the <num value="2">two</num> regiments of the city militia, the East India volunteers, <pb id="p.133" n="133"> and several other parochial corps of the same description, whilst the light horse volunteers of London and Westminster paraded as occasion required. 
<p>The death of alderman Wilkes, which happened on the <datestruct VALUE="-12-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, occasioned a vacancy for the office of chamberlain. A common hall, for the election of his successor, was held on the <datestruct VALUE="1798-01-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>, when the candidates were sir Watkin Lewes and alderman Clark. On the show of hands, there was a great majority in favour of Mr. Clark; but a poll was demanded in favour of sir Watkin; which began at half-past <num value="2">two</num>, and closed for the day, at <num value="4">four</num>, when sir Watkin Lewes declined giving the livery any further trouble; the numbers being <num value="393">393</num> to <num value="48">48</num>. The unusually great number polled in this short space is an ample testimony of the high esteem in which the unobtrusive merits of the present venerable and highly respected chamberlain are held by his fellow-citizens; there being, perhaps, no instance of so many liverymen having voted in the same time, on any other occasion. 
<p>A meeting of the most respectable merchants and traders of London, was held at the Royal Exchange, on the <datestruct VALUE="1798-02-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>, for the purpose of entering into a voluntary subscription for the service of the country. The lord mayor, accompanied by a considerable number of the principal bankers, merchants, &amp;c. appeared on a temporary hustings, about <num value="1">one</num> o'clock, and in a short speech, stated the object of the meeting. He was followed by Mr. Bosanquet, who entered more fully into the propriety and necessity of the measure, and proposed that books should be opened at the Exchange, for receiving subscriptions, which was unanimously agreed to. <num value="4">Four</num> separate books were then opened on the hustings, and, at the close of the day, the exact sum subscribed was <num value="465341">46,5341</num>. <measure value="14s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="14">14</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> <num value="4">Four</num> days afterwards, <measure value="10000l." type=currency><num value="10000">10,000</num>l.</measure> was subscribed by the court of common council; and several of the members, also gave large sums as individuals, as soon as the court broke up. <measure value="200000l." type=currency><num value="200000">Two hundred thousand</num> pounds</measure> were subscribed by the Bank, and considerable sums were given by other public companies. The gifts of many noblemen and gentlemen increased the contributions, and <measure value="20000l." type=currency><num value="20000">20,000</num>l.</measure> was subscribed by his majesty.<NOTE>In the summary of ways and means for the year, the minister estimated the voluntary subscription at a million and a half; its total produce, however, was upwards of <num value="2">two</num> millions.-<BIBL>Brayley.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The continued threats of invasion from France, and the distracted state of Ireland, rendering a great increase of the military force expedient, government, in the beginning of this year, devised a plan for a more powerful defence of the kingdom than had ever yet been called into action. This occasioned the passing of several acts of parliament, tending to this end, and various armed associations were, in consequence, organized in different parts of the country. On the <datestruct VALUE="-04-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, the lord mayor informed the common council, that he had received a letter from the secretary of state, and had also had a <pb id="p.134" n="134"> conference with the duke of York, at that time commander-in-chief of the British army, respecting the formation of armed associations, in the several wards of the city. At the next meeting of the court, the committee of aldermen, to which the business had been referred, made their report, and, on the <datestruct VALUE="-05-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, the inhabitant householders met in the respective wards, when the following propositions were generally adopted, viz.  <QUOTE>that the inhabitant house-holders of each ward should choose a committee to form regulations, and recommend officers; that the more able men should learn the use of arms, and those not capable to bear arms, be sworn in as special constables; and that the whole force thus raised should, in case of necessity, be united into <num value="1">one</num> body, under the direction of the lord mayor and court of aldermen.</QUOTE>  
<p>Whilst these measures were in agitation in the city, parochial, and other meetings, for the same purpose, were general throughout the metropolis; and, in the course of a few months, a very considerable volunteer force was established, and the protection of the capital, by that means, pretty effectually secured.<NOTE>Mr. Brayley justly remarks, that <QUOTE>the cause for hastening on the formation of volunteer corps at this period, was doubtless, that the regulars and militia might be more at liberty to leave this country to oppose the projected insurrection in Ireland, which, as afterwards appeared from the confession of ministers themselves, was purposely accelerated by the measures of the Irish government! How much more to the interests of humanity and of the British empire, would it have been had the same pains been taken to remove the grounds of complaint, as were thus exercised to goad disaffection into rebellion.</QUOTE> </NOTE>
 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-05-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, a bill, which particularly affected the seamen, &amp;c. belonging to the port of London, was brought into parliament, and carried through both houses; and, on the next day, it received the royal assent. This was the very era of the insurrection in Ireland, and was founded on the evident necessity of having a numerous fleet in readiness, to prevent the insurgents receiving succour from France. It was intituled, a bill for  <QUOTE> the more effectually and speedily manning the navy;</QUOTE>  and the principle of the measure was to supersede the force of all protections, for a certain time. During the discussions in the house of commons, whilst the bill was in progress, the minister accused Mr. Tierney, the popular representative for Southwark, of opposing this measure from  <QUOTE>a desire to obstruct the defence of the country,</QUOTE>  and he afterwards refused either to explain or retract his expressions. This led to a duel between the parties on the following Sunday, which terminated without injury to either; Mr. Pitt having fired his last pistol in the air. The meeting took place on Putney heath. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-06-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, James O&lsquo;Coigley, alias Fever, who had been recently condemned at Maidstone for high treason, in maintaining a treasonable correspondence with the French Directory, was exeon Pennenden-heath. He had been apprehended about the end of <pb id="p.135" n="135"> February, at Margate, whilst endeavouring to obtain a passage to France, together with the celebrated Arthur O&lsquo;Connor, esq. nephew to lord Longueville, John Binns, secretary to a division of the London Corresponding Society, John Allen, and Jeremiah Leary: the latter was O&lsquo;Connor's servant. On the <datestruct VALUE="-03-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, the prisoners were brought to London: and several other persons, suspected of being connected with them, but who were afterwards discharged, were taken up in the course of the week. On the <num value="7">7th</num>, they were examined before the privy council, and on the following morning, O&lsquo;Connor, O&lsquo;Coigley, Binns, and Allen were committed to separate apartments in the Tower. In April, a special commission for their trial was opened at Maidstone; and the grand jury having found a true bill, they were tried on the <num value="21">21st</num> and <datestruct VALUE="-05-22"><day reg="22">22nd</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, when O&lsquo;Coigley only was found guilty; an absurd but treasonable paper having been discovered in his possession, purporting to be  <QUOTE>an address from the secret committee of England to the executive directory of France.</QUOTE>  O&lsquo;Connor and Binns were detained in custody on other charges. During these proceedings, Roger O&lsquo;Conner, esq. was arrested at his apartments in Craven-street, and. remanded to Dublin, under a warrant from the secretary of state; and <num value="2">two</num> divisions of members of the London Corresponding Society, which still continued its meetings, though not so openly as formerly, were apprehended in different parts of the town. These arrests, however, led to no particular discoveries: they appear to have been made more to keep up the spirit of alarm than for the sake of substantial justice, 
<p>On the night of the <datestruct VALUE="-09-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>, the metropolis was visited by a most tremendous storm of wind, which did considerable damage in various parts of the town and its vicinity, as well as on the river. In some of the streets, the current of air was so violent as to break the lamps; in Hyde-park and Kensington-gardens many trees were torn up by the roots, and shattered branches were carried through the air to remote distances; at Lambeth, several houses were unroofed, and chimnies blown down. On the river, at the turn of the tide, the greatest confusion ensued, the wind being directly contrary, and many boats were dashed to pieces and sunk. Below bridge several ships were driven from their moorings, and much damaged; and the Castor, West Indiaman, having a cargo on board, valued at <measure value="15000l." type=currency><num value="15000">15,000</num>l.</measure> parted her anchor, and drove on shore at Limehouse-reach, where she received considerable damage and filled with water. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-10-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, intelligence arrived of the ever-memorable victory obtained over the French fleet by sir Horatio Nelson, off the mouth of the Nile; and, on the same day, a subscription was opened at Lloyd's coffee-house, for the relief of the wounded, and of the widows and orphans of those who had fallen. <num value="2">Two</num> days afterwards, the hon. captain Capel waited on the lord mayor, with the sword of the surviving French admiral, Monsieur Blanquet, which was surrendered in the naval action at the Nile, admiral Brueys <pb id="p.136" n="136"> having been blown up in the l&lsquo;Orient, and intended by sir Horatio Nelson as a present to the city of London, accompanied by the following letter. 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Vanguard, Mouth of the Nile, <datestruct VALUE="-08-8"><month reg="08">Aug.</month> <day reg=8>8</day></datestruct>. 
<p>My Lord, 
<p>Having the honour of being a freeman of the city of London, I take the liberty of sending to your lordship the sword of the commanding French admiral (M. Blanquet), who survived after the battle of the <num value="1">1st</num>, off the Nile; and request that the city of London will honour me with the acceptance of it, as a remembrance that Brittannia still rules the waves; which, that she may ever do, is the fervent wish of your lordship's most obedient servant, 
<p>H. NELSON.</QUOTE>
 
<p>This letter, and the sword, were laid before a court of common council, on the <num value="10">10th</num>, who referred it to a committee, to consider the best manner of disposing of the sword, and report to the next court. It was then unanimously resolved to address his majesty on the glorious victory over the French, off the Nile, on the <datestruct VALUE="-08-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, by his majesty's fleet, under the command of sir Horatio, now baron Nelson, of the Nile; which was presented on the <num value="24">24th</num>, and very graciously received. 
<p>The report from the committee was laid before the court on the <num value="16">16th</num>, and unanimously agreed to. It was, that they had come to the following resolution:--<QUOTE><p>That the sword, delivered up to our gallant hero, lord Nelson, by the French admiral, M.

Rear Admiral Lord Nelson.</QUOTE></QUOTE>
 
<p>The lord mayor was then requested to communicate to lord Nelson the high sense which the court entertain of this invaluable present. After which, the thanks of the court, with a sword of <num value="200">two hundred</num> guineas value, were voted to lord Nelson; and also the thanks of the court to captain Berry, the captains, officers, and seamen, for their important services; and the freedom of the city was voted to captain Berry, to be presented in a box of <num value="100">one hundred</num> guineas value. 
<p>The night of the <datestruct VALUE="1799-02-11"><day reg="11">eleventh</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>, was distinguished by a dreadful storm, from which great injury was sustained by the <pb id="p.137" n="137"> shipping in the river Thames. Many vessels were driven from their moorings, and run foul of each other, and great numbers of small craft, boats, &amp;c. were sunk or dashed to pieces. 
<p>His majesty's birth-day, <datestruct VALUE="-06-4"><month reg="06">June</month> the <day reg=4>fourth</day></datestruct>, was this year celebrated with more than customary splendour, the common ceremonies of rejoicing being increased by a grand review of the associated volunteers of London and its environs, who assembled in Hyde-park about <num value="8">eight</num> o'clock in the morning, and were formed into <num value="3">three</num> lines, with the exception of part of the cavalry, which was employed to keep the ground. At <num value="9">nine</num>, his majesty entered the park, accompanied by the prince of Wales, and the dukes of Kent and Cumberland, and the review commenced; the queen and the princesses beholding the spectacle from the houses of lady Holderness and lord Cathcart, in Park-lane. The whole of the evolutions having been gone through, a royal salute of <num value="21">twenty-one</num> guns was fired, and his majesty, after expressing the highest satisfaction at the martial appearance, patriotism, and conduct of the gallant bands, whom the threatened violation of their country's independence had thus associated in arms, left the ground about <num value="1">one</num> o'clock, amidst the joyous shouts of a concourse of spectators, supposed to amount to nearly <num value="150000">150,000</num>. The day was extremely unfavourable, through the fall of a heavy rain, with much wind; yet the display of female beauty was not inconsiderable. The walls, trees, and contiguous houses, were all loaded with people, and the interest of the scene was much increased by the patriotic sentiments which seemed to prevail in every bosom. The total number of volunteers under arms on this day was <num value="8989">8989</num>, of which <datestruct value="1008--"><year reg="1008">1008</year></datestruct> were cavalry. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-06-21"><day reg="21">twenty-first</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, a yet greater body of volunteers was assembled about the metropolis, for the purpose of undergoing a royal inspection at different stations, previously fixed on as being near their accustomed places of exercise. His majesty, accompanied by the prince of Wales, and the royal dukes, and a numerous suite of general and other officers, left the queen's house at <num value="9">nine</num> o'clock, and proceeded towards St. George's fields, where, between the Asylum and the Obelisk, the Surrey volunteers, amounting to <datestruct value="1596--"><year reg="1596">1596</year></datestruct>, were drawn up. Thence going to Blackfriar's, he was received on the bridge by the lord-mayor, sheriffs, &amp;c., who preceded him in his subsequent progress through the city. In Bridge-street, <datestruct value="1054--"><year reg="1054">1054</year></datestruct> volunteers were assembled; in St. Paul's Church-yard, <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct>; at the Royal Exchange and Bank, <datestruct value="1011--"><year reg="1011">1011</year></datestruct>; at the East India-house, <num value="500">500</num>; on Tower-hill, <datestruct value="1038--"><year reg="1038">1038</year></datestruct>; in Finsbury-square, <num value="862">862</num>; and at Islington, <num value="394">394</num>. After inspecting the latter corps, his majesty proceeded to the lord chancellor Loughborough's, where he waited for the arrival of the queen and <num value="5">five</num> princesses, who came about <num value="2">two</num> o'clock, attended by the duke of Clarence, and with them, and his own suite, he partook of an elegant collation. About <num value="3">three</num> his majesty again mounted, and with the whole of the royal family, proceeded down Guildford-street, where <num value="823">823</num> of the Tower hamlet and Mile-end volunteers <pb id="p.138" n="138"> were drawn up, to the Foundling-hospital, in front of which were the Bloomsbury, St. Martin's, Somerset-place, Hampstead, and other corps, amounting to <datestruct value="1230--"><year reg="1230">1230</year></datestruct>, drawn up in parallel lines. During the inspection here, the queen and princesses entered the hospital, and viewed the children's apartments, &amp;c., and were soon joined by his majesty, with the royal brothers: the  <QUOTE>Children's Hymn,</QUOTE>  and  <QUOTE>God save the King,</QUOTE>  were afterwards sung in the chapel, before the whole family. On his departure from the Foundling, the king went onward to Hyde-park, where the Westminster cavalry, St. George's volunteers, &amp;c. were assembled, to the number of <num value="2700">2700</num>; and having passed these, he rode down Constitution-hill to the queen's palace, where he arrived about <num value="5">five</num> o'clock. The whole number of volunteers inspected on this day, was <num value="12208">12,208</num>. His majesty expressed himself highly gratified at the impressive display of loyalty and public spirit, which this day had afforded him: and the city received his particular thanks for the attention and order with which his progress had been attended. Vast numbers of spectators filled the streets on this occasion, and the windows and house-tops were every where crowded with people. On the <datestruct VALUE="-07-13"><day reg="13">thirteenth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, a dreadful fire broke out within the King's Bench prison, in the north wing, and for some hours raged with the utmost violence. The prisoners themselves made every exertion to extinguish the flames, without attempting to escape; and at length, by the assistance of the engines, the fire was subdued, yet not till between <num value="80">eighty</num> and a <num value="100">hundred</num> of the lodging rooms were entirely consumed, and other considerable damage done. 
<p>The severity of the season, and the great distresses of the poor from want of employment, and the growing dearness of provisions and coals, occasioned a meeting to be held at the London Tavern, on the <datestruct VALUE="-12-9"><day reg="9">ninth</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, to take into consideration the best means of giving them assistance during the continuance of the pressure. It was then resolved to open a general subscription for the relief of the industrious poor, in all parts of the metropolis, &amp;c.; and that the most effectual way of aiding the distressed would be, by selling provisions at reduced prices, as had been done in the year <datestruct value="1795"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>; through which measure great benefits had resulted. It was also resolved to increase the number of soup-houses, the erection of which had particularly contributed to extend the advantages of a former subscription; insomuch, that in the course of the winter and spring months of <datestruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>, about <num value="8400">8400</num> families had been supplied with <num value="481336">481,336</num> meals, at the <num value="3">three</num> soup-houses in Spitalfields, at an expence of only <measure value="895l." type=currency><num value="895">895</num>l.</measure> <measure value="12s." type=currency><num value="12">12</num>s.</measure> to the funds subscribed, exclusive of the <num value="1">first</num> costs of the erection and repairs; and in the winter and spring months of <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>, the number of persons who received benefit from the fund was <num value="40000">40,000</num>, and the number of meals distributed <num value="750918">750,918</num>, at the aggregate expence of only <measure value="3476l. 8s. 10d." type=Currency><num value="3476">3,476</num>l. <num value="8">8</num>s. <num value="10">10</num>d.</measure> 
<p>The dearness of corn at this period was in a great degree occasioned by the unfavourable state of the seasons, and particularly by <pb id="p.139" n="139"> the heavy rains, and continuance of wet weather for many weeks together; yet it was the opinion of many well-informed persons, that the alarm of scarcity, which had been very industriously propagated, had its full share in advancing the price. It was thought, also, that a circular letter, sent by the duke of Portland to the lord lieutenants of counties, in which, after adverting to the various means used in the metropolis for relieving the poor, it was strongly recommended to enforce the statute of the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> of George the <num value="3">Third</num>, empowering the justices in quarter sessions to  <QUOTE>direct, that no finer bread shall be made than such as is called by the name of standard wheaten bread,</QUOTE>  &amp;c. had very much contributed to extend the alarm. However this might be, the increasing dearth engaged much of the attention of parliament in the beginning of the year <datestruct value="1800"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>; and in consequence of a previous report, a bill was passed with unexampled rapidity through both houses, and received the royal assent on the same day, <datestruct VALUE="-02-20"><month reg="02">February</month> the <day reg=20>twentieth</day></datestruct>, to prohibit, for a limited time, any bakers in the cities of London or Westminster, or within <num value="10">ten</num> miles of the Royal Exchange, from selling bread till it had been removed from the oven at least <num value="24">twenty-four</num> hours, under a penalty of <measure value="5l." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> pounds</measure> for every loaf sold. On the same day, the archbishop of Canterbury moved in the house of lords,  <QUOTE>That their lordships should oblige themselves, by a voluntary engagement, not to suffer more than a quartern loaf of bread a week, for each person, to be consumed in their families, from the <datestruct VALUE="-02-24"><day reg="24">twenty-fourth</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct> till the <datestruct VALUE="-10-24"><day reg="24">twenty-fourth</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct> next;</QUOTE>  and after the substitute of  <QUOTE>recommendation</QUOTE>  for  <QUOTE>engagement,</QUOTE>  this measure was adopted. The average price of wheat in Middlesex, at this time, was <measure value="5l. 12s. 3d." type=Currency><num value="5">5</num>l. <num value="12">12</num>s. <num value="3">3</num>d.</measure> per quarter; and of rye <measure value="3l." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>l.</measure><NOTE><BIBL>Brayley's Hist. of London, i. <num value="591">591</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The great importance of the subject induced the house of commons to pursue their investigation into the causes, extent, and means of supply; and on there port of a committee, recommending  <QUOTE>the allowance of a bounty on corn imported from the Mediterranean and America; the substitution of a new assize of bread, with new regulations respecting the millers; the stoppage of the distilleries; the encouragement of the importation of rice and fish, and the culture of potatoes; the prohibition of manufacturing starch from wheat,</QUOTE>  &amp;c. those measures were successively adopted, and passed into laws. In March, also, a committee was appointed to enquire into the state of the coal trade. The price of wheat in London markets on the <num value="24">twenty-fourth</num> of this month, was from <num value="41">41</num>. <measure value="8s." type=currency><num value="8">8</num>s.</measure> to <measure value="5l." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>l.</measure> <measure value="12s." type=currency><num value="12">12</num>s.</measure> a quarter; the price of rye, from <num value="31">31</num>. <measure value="16s." type=currency><num value="16">16</num>s.</measure> to <num value="41">41</num>. a quarter; and the price of barley, from <measure value="1l." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>l.</measure> <measure value="16s." type=currency><num value="16">16</num>s.</measure> to <measure value="3l. 12s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>l. <num value="12">12</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> 
<p>On the evening of the <datestruct VALUE="-05-15"><day reg="15">fifteenth</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, an attempt was made by <num value="1">one</num> James Hatfield, a lunatic, to assassinate the king, in the Theatre-royal Drury-lane. At the moment when his majesty entered the box, a man in the pit stood up, and fired a pistol at him. The <pb id="p.140" n="140"> house was immediately in an uproar, and the cry of  <QUOTE> seize him</QUOTE>  burst from every part of the theatre, The king, apparently not the least disconcerted, came forward in the box; and the man who committed the crime was conveyed from the pit. The indignation of the audience could not be tranquillized until after repeated assurances that the culprit was in custody. On his examination he proved to be insane. He had been a soldier in the <num value="15">15th</num> light dragoons, and had received <num value="8">eight</num> wounds in his head, from which it was believed his malady arose. He was tried for the offence on the <datestruct VALUE="-06-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, and acquitted on the ground of insanity, after which he was conveyed to a mad-house to be taken care of. 
<p>The celebration of his majesty's birth was again commenced with a review of the volunteer force of the metropolis and its vicinity, which differed in nothing from that of the preceding year, except in an increase of numbers, nearly <num value="12000">twelve thousand</num> being under arms on this day. 
<p>Soon after the prorogation of parliament, which took place on the <datestruct VALUE="-07-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, apprehensions of tumult and riot alarmed many of the inhabitants of London. About the middle of August a refractory spirit had manifested itself among the felons in the prison in Cold Bath-fields. This was attributed to various publications on the state of this prison, which had appeared a short time before. But, however this may be, the keepers began to entertain serious apprehensions; and the prisoners' turbulence at length assumed a serious aspect; for on the evening of the <num value="15">15th</num>, when the bell rung as the signal for locking up, instead of retiring to their cells, they collected together, appearing to have some design in agitation. However, after a trifling resistance, they were compelled to separate, and submit to being locked up. Immediately they began the most dismal exclamations of <QUOTE>Murder! Starving,</QUOTE> &amp;c. which collected a considerable mob round the prison, who answered them with loud shouts. Thus encouraged, they continued their cries, beseeching the mob to force the gates, and pull down the walls to release them. In this dilemma, it was found necessary to apply for assistance from the civil magistrates and the military associations in the neighbourhood, by whose exertions tranquillity was again restored. 
<p>The attempts of the disaffected to incite the populace to outrage were but too successful in the month of September. Written handbills were thrown about at this time, provoking the people to rise, and, in particular, <num value="2">two</num> large ones, of the above tendency, were stuck on the Monument, on Sunday, the <num value="14">14th</num>, inviting them, <QUOTE>as they valued their rights as Englishmen, to attend at the Corn-market on Monday, which would soon reduce the price of bread to <measure value="6d." type=currency><num value="6">six</num>-pence</measure> the quartern loaf.</QUOTE> These incitements to popular outrage induced the lord-mayor to take the necessary precautions to secure the public peace; he collected the civil officers, and applied to the volunteer corps, from whom he received assurances of support, and that they would await his orders. In the morning of Monday the mob assembled <pb id="p.141" n="141"> at the Corn-market, to which the lord-mayor immediately repaired, and persuaded them to disperse, which they did; but as soon as he quitted the spot, they returned. Several of the dealers in corn were ill-treated by them, and the windows of some houses in the neighbourhood were broke; and when, in the end, they were driven off by the volunteers, they attacked the houses of some bakers and corn-factors, at Shoreditch, Whitechapel, and Blackfriar's-road. This spirit of riot and discontent continued during the whole week; but the vigour and promptitude of the magistrates, seconded by the firmness and humanity of the volunteers, prevented the mistaken multitude from effecting any greater mischief, than the breaking of windows and lamps; which was happily accomplished without bloodshed. 
<p>At a full meeting of the livery of London, in common hall, held on the <num value="3">3</num>d of October, an address and petition to his majesty was resolved on praying him to convene the parliament, for the purpose of considering of the most salutary measures for remedying the sufferings of the poor, in consequence of the exorbitant price of every article of life. This petition the king refused to receive, excepting at the levee; on which, at a subsequent common hall, it was voted, <QUOTE>That whoever advised his majesty to persist in refusing to his faithful subjects free access, in these times of peculiar difficulty and distress, is equally unworthy of his majesty's confidence, and an enemy to the rights and privileges of the city of London.</QUOTE> A few days afterwards, an address and petition of similar import to that of the livery, was agreed to by the court of common council; though in the intermediate time the parliament had been summoned to meet for the dispatch of business. 
<p>On <datestruct VALUE="-10-6"><month reg="10">October</month> the <day reg=6>6th</day></datestruct>, a great fire, occasioned by the boiling over of a pitch kettle, destroyed upwards of <num value="60">sixty</num> private houses and other buildings at Wapping, and several persons were killed by the explosion of some barrels of gunpowder. The damage was estimated at upwards of <measure value="200000l." type=currency><num value="200000">200,000</num>l.</measure> 
<p>The parliament assembled on the <datestruct VALUE="-11-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, and immediately proceeded to pass different acts to prevent the scarcity from merging into famine; and on the <num value="3">3</num>d of December his majesty, at the request of both houses, issued a proclamation, exhorting,  <QUOTE>all persons to employ the strictest economy in the use of all kinds of grain, to abstain from the use of pastry, and to reduce the consumption of bread in their respective families, as far as possible.</QUOTE>  During the summer and autumn of this year great quantities of corn were imported from foreign countries; and, though a temporary reduction in price took place in August, it was almost immediately followed by a considerable advance, and in the last week of this year the average price of wheat in Mark-lane, was <measure value="7l. 1s. 5d." type=Currency><num value="7">7</num>l. <num value="1">1</num>s. <num value="5">5</num>d.</measure> per quarter. <pb id="p.142" n="142">

<p>The commencement of the new century, <datestruct value="1801--"><year reg="1801">1801</year></datestruct>, was distinguished by the union of the kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland, which had been resolved on by the <num value="2">two</num> parliaments in the course of the preceding year. On this occasion new standards were hoisted, and the Park and Tower guns were fired: a meeting of the privy council was held, and the new oaths taken by all the members that were in town. The style and titles of the king were now altered, and a royal proclamation of this day, ordered them to be expressed in Latin, as follows: <QUOTE><foreign lang=la>Georgius Tertius, Dei Gratia Britanniarum Rex, Fidei Defensor.</foreign></QUOTE> 
<p>The excessive dearness of corn still continuing, it was judged expedient to prohibit the use of fine wheat flour after the <datestruct VALUE="-02-2"><day reg="2">second</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>; and all loaves were in consequence made of the brown, or household kind. Notwithstanding this, the prices of corn continued to advance, and in the <num value="3">three</num> last weeks of March the quartern loaf in London was as high as <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure> <measure value="10.50d." type=currency><num value="10.50">10 1/2</num>d.</measure> The average prices of wheat in Mark-lane, was about <measure value="7l." type=currency><num value="7">7</num>l.</measure> <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> per quarter; and the average in all Middlesex, <measure value="8l. 8s. 10d." type=Currency><num value="8">8</num>l. <num value="8">8</num>s. <num value="10">10</num>d.</measure> per quarter. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-06-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, in the afternoon, the metropolis and its vicinity experienced <num value="1">one</num> of the most violent storms of thunder, lightning, and wind, that was ever remembered, accompanied with rain, which fell in such quantities for half an hour, that the streets were almost impassable, In the midst of the storm, the wind and rain forced in part of the sky-light of the court of Common Pleas, and for a time, totally impeded all business, the counsellors, &amp;c. hurrying into Westminster-hall, to avoid the descending torrents. The hurricane did great damage also in many parts of the kingdom. 
<p>The Paddingdon canal was opened on the morning of the <datestruct VALUE="-07-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, with a grand procession of boats, to Bull's bridge, near Uxbridge, where they arrived about noon, and, being joined by the city shallop, with the sub-committee of the Thames, and several pleasure boats, the procession returned to the great dock at Paddington. 
<p>Intelligence having been received, of the adjustment of the differences between Great Britain and Russia, on the <datestruct VALUE="-07-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, lord Hawkesbury immediately transmitted the pleasing information to the lord mayor. 
<p>Preliminaries of peace, between his majesty and the French government, were signed at lord Hawkesbury's office, in Downing-street, on the <num value="2">2</num>d of October, and on the <num value="10">10th</num>, general Lauriston, Bonaparte's <num value="1">first</num> aide-de-camp, arrived with the ratification. In his passage through the town to M. Otto's residence, his carriage was followed by a numerous concourse of people, who afterwards <pb id="p.143" n="143"> took the horses from it, and drew him and M. Otto to Downing-street, with expressions of the most tumultuous joy. On the ratifications being exchanged, the Park and Tower guns were fired, and at night there was a general illumination through the metropolis, which was repeated on the following evening. 
<p>A memorable example of English justice was displayed on the <datestruct VALUE="1802-01-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, by the execution, before Newgate, of John Wall, once governor of Goree, in Africa, for the murder of a serjeant, named Armstrong, whom he had caused to be tied to a gun carriage and flogged with such severity that the unfortunate victim died on the <num value="5">fifth</num> day afterwards. This was as far back as the year <datestruct value="1782"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct>: some time after which Wall returned to England, and was apprehended for the crime, but made his escape from the officers on the road from Bath, and had lived upon the continent till the year <datestruct value="1797"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>. He then, most fatally for his safety returned to this country, and lived in privacy till a short time before his trial, when, apparently induced by perturbation of mind, and deluded by the hope that the witnesses of his guilt were no more, he wrote to the secretary of state that he was ready to surrender to take his trial. The evidence against him was conclusive, and though an attempt was made to rebut it by witnesses, who stated the garrison at Goree to have been in a state of mutiny when the punishment was inflicted on Armstrong, the jury pronounced a verdict of  <QUOTE>Guilty:</QUOTE>  various inconsistencies in their testimony being evident. Great interest was made to preserve his life, and a short reprieve was twice granted to the importunity of his friends <num value="1">One</num> whole day is said to have been occupied by the great law officers of the crown in considering his case, and the judges conferred together for <num value="3">three</num> hours, at the lord chancellor's, on the same subject. The result was against him; in the then state of the public mind, to have pardoned him might have been dangerous, even if his guilt had been questionable. On the morning of his execution a vast crowd surrounded the scaffold, and far, very far, contrary to the usual conduct of the multitude on these occasions, his ascending it became the signal for the utterance of <num value="3">three</num> distinct huzzas; and again, when the rope was affixed to his neck, the brutal exultation of the populace was evinced by another very loud shout. Under this extreme pressure of ignominy the criminal bowed his head, as if the detestation of his fellow-creatures had penetrated to his soul; but his sufferings were not yet ended: at the moment the platform dropped, the knot of the cord shifted to the back of his neck, and he remained suspended in convulsive agony nearly <num value="20">twenty</num> minutes. His body was afterwards dissected, as customary in all cases of execution for murder. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1802-03-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, a common hall was held for the purpose of taking into consideration the propriety of applying to parliament for the repeal of the Income tax; when a petition being prepared and agreed to, it was ordered to be presented by alderman Combe, the other representatives of the city having offended the livery by voting for the tax. <pb id="p.144" n="144"> 
<p>The Easter dinner at the Mansion-house was remarkable for the absence of the sheriffs, in consequence of a conceived omission of attention from the lord mayor, to their official situation. The prince of Wales having honoured the dinner with his presence, they thought it their duty to apologize to his royal highness by letter, in which, after stating the lord mayor's neglect of that respect towards them which custom had established, and which from their high office they had a right to demand, they conclude <QUOTE>Under this impression your royal highness will not be surprised, that we resented what we considered indignity to our station ; that we refused to be mere puppets, in what he presumed to be his private pageant; that we consented to sacrifice the unbounded pleasure we ought to have enjoyed, in humbly receiving, and dutifully waiting upon your royal person, to the feelings of public propriety.</QUOTE> 
<p>Peace was proclaimed in the cities of London and Westminster, on the <datestruct VALUE="-04-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, and, notwithstanding the ardour with which the preliminary articles had been received was considerably abated by the insidious conduct of France, during the interval that had elapsed since that period, yet, generally speaking, the most lively sensations of joy were excited on the present occasion. The streets were crowded at a very early hour, by persons of almost every rank, impatiently waiting for the procession; and the vast number of strangers from the country, whom curiosity had attracted, added much to the bustle of the scene. The procession was formed at St. James's palace, and the ceremony commenced at <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock, by Windsor herald reading the proclamation of peace for the <num value="1">first</num> time, after which the procession moved forward along Pall Mall, in the following order:

The procession then passed along <pb id="p.146" n="146"> Cornhill, and Leadenhall-street, to Aldgate,, and returned back along Fenchurch-street, Gracechurch-street, and Cornhill to the Mansion-house, from whence the horse guards escorted the heralds to their college in Doctors' Commons, and afterwards proceeded to St. James's, with the knight marshal and his men. 
<p>Illuminations of the most splendid nature succeeded the ceremonial of the day. The Mansion-house, the Bank, the India-house, the public offices, and theatres, as well as the houses of many individuals, were particularly distinguished for the taste and splendour of their decorations; but the object of universal attraction, was the French minister, M. Otto's house, in Portman-square, which was most brilliantly illuminated with coloured lamps, disposed in the form of a temple of the Ionic order, having the entablature divided in the centre by the word AMITY,<NOTE>Whilst the preparations for this magnificent display were going on, a circumstance or <num value="2">two</num> occurred most highly characteristic of the national feelings. The entablature was at <num value="1">first</num> surmounted by the word CONCORD; this was mistaken by the populace for <hi rend=italics>Conquered</hi>, and, with true John Bull spirit, they insisted that it should be removed, as being intended to convey the inference that the  <QUOTE>English had been conquered by the French.</QUOTE>  M. Otto, after some fruitless attempts at explanation, very prudently gave way, and the word Amity was substituted. It was next discovered by some sailors, that the letters G. R. were not distinguished by a crown; this was next stipulated for, and put up accordingly.</NOTE> in brilliant light; and above it, beneath an arch, a large transparency, representing England and France, with their various attributes, in the act of uniting their hands before an altar dedicated to Humanity; this was surmounted by the word <hi rend=italics>Peace</hi>: the letters G. R. surmounted by a royal, and F. R. by a civic crown, also appeared issuing from between trees of laurel, formed by green lamps; and the whole was terminated above by a large and most brilliant star. The excessive brilliancy of this illumination was probably never exceeded; the sight could hardly sustain the radiance, even at the distance of many yards. The crowd was so immense, that, for a long time, those who had reached the square, could find no avenue for retreat; and many carriages were jammed in for hours. 
<p>During the elections for a new parliament, in July, the metropolis was thrown into great confusion by the tumultuary assemblies of people which accompanied the choosing of the members for Westminster and Middlesex. In Westminster, Mr. Fox and sir Alan Gardiner were opposed by <num value="1">one</num> Graham, an auctioneer; and though the latter scarcely possessed a single necessary qualification for a statesman, he polled <num value="3207">3207</num> votes. In Middlesex, the popular candidate was sir Francis Burdett, who obtained his election against Mr. Justice Mainwaring, through the extraordinary circumstance of the sheriffs, R. A. Cox, esq. and sir William Rawlins, knt. receiving the votes of <num value="372">372</num> persons, by whom, and a few others, a company had been formed for erecting a flour-mill at Isleworth, on about a <pb id="p.147" n="147"> quarter of an acre of ground; which had been bargained for just a <num value="12">twelve</num>-month before. The original shares in this concern were only of the value of <num value="2">two</num> guineas each; the purchase money was unpaid, no regular conveyance had been made, the mill was unfinished, and not a farthing of profit had been derived from it by any of the proprietors, yet it was sworn by each of them, that he possessed a freehold of the clear yearly value of <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num> shillings</measure>! Every day during the election, the road to Brentford was the scene of great disorders, and many acts of personal violence, menace, and insult were committed by both parties; but chiefly by the opposers of Mainwaring, who had highly displeased the populace by his conduct as chairman of the county magistrates, when the enquiry respecting the Cold Bath Fields prison was going on. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-11-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, the day appointed for the meeting of the new parliament, colonel Edward Marcus Despard, and <num value="30">thirty</num> other persons were apprehended at the Oakley-arms, Oakley-street, Lambeth, on a charge of treasonable practices; and after several examinations, <num value="12">twelve</num> of them, with the colonel, were committed to different gaols for trial. They were accused of forming a conspiracy to overturn the constitution, and destroy the king and other branches of the royal family; and the associations to which they belonged were stated to consist of several divisions of about tens persons each, which assembled in various public-houses about town. On the <datestruct VALUE="1803-01-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, a special commission was appointed for their trials, which came on in the following month, at the New Sessions house, Horsemonger-lane, Southwark. Despard, with <num value="9">nine</num> others, was adjudged guilty; but <num value="3">three</num> of them were recommended to mercy, and afterwards pardoned. In his opening speech, the attorney-general stated the conspirators to consist  <QUOTE>of the lowest order of the people, as journeymen, day-labourers, and common soldiers;</QUOTE>  and <num value="3">three</num> of those convicted were privates in the guards. The execution took place on the <datestruct VALUE="-02-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, on the top of the county gaol; but that part of the sentence on traitors, which directs the bowels to be taken out, &amp;c. and the body to be quartered, was remitted, The head, however, of each sufferer, was afterwards cut off, and exhibited to the crowd, which <hi rend=italics>was</hi> considerable and very orderly; though some confusion had been expected, and a strong military force was provided to resist any attempt that might have been made by the populace to rescue the prisoners. Colonel Despard strongly asserted his innocence on the scaffold; and it does not appear that any of his associates made any other confession inferring guilt, than that they had done wrong in attending the meeting. 
<p>At a court of common council, held on the <datestruct VALUE="-03-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct> it was unanimously resolved to subscribe <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">five hundred</num> pounds</measure> to the royal Jennerian Society, which had been instituted a short time before for the purpose of exterminating the smallpox by the introduction of the vaccine inoculation. <pb id="p.148" n="148"> 
<p>The <num value="21">21st</num> being the anniversary of the memorable battle of Alexandria, the Turkish piece of ordnance taken on that day, was placed opposite the gunner's house, in St. James's park. It is <num value="16">16</num> feet in length, but was originally <num value="20">20</num> feet. The carriage was made for it in London. 
<p>A most extraordinary forgery was practised in the city on the <datestruct VALUE="-05-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>. At an early hour in the morning, a man delivered a letter at the Mansion-house, which he said he had brought from the secretary of state, and requested it might be delivered immediately; it was accordingly given to the lord mayor, and soon after the following literal copy appeared in front of the Mansion-house; <QUOTE>Lord Hawkesbury presents his compliments to the lord mayor, and has the honor to acquaint his lordship that the negociation between this country and the French republic is brought to an amicable conclusion. Downing-street, <num value="8">8</num> o'clock, <datestruct VALUE="1803-05-5"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=5>5</day>, <year reg=1803>1803</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE> Printed notices were then posted round the Custom-house, declaring the embargo to be taken off saltpetre, &amp;c. In consequence of this delusion, the consols experienced an immediate rise from <num value="63.75">63 3/4</num> to <num value="71.25">71 1/4</num>. A real treasury messenger soon arrived, however, to announce the deception, on which the genuine communication was read in the public streets by the city marshal. The confusion which ensued was beyond all description; the Stock Exchange was immediately shut, and the committee came to a resolution that all bargains made that morning should be void; and the consequence of the detection of this artifice was a rapid fall in the funds to their <num value="1">first</num> price in the morning. 
<p>A similar attempt was made <num value="2">two</num> days after, through the medium of a morning paper, notoriously in the interest of the government, in which a paragraph appeared, stating the amicable termination of the differences with France. The committee for managing the Stock Exchange, however, in order to guard against a <num value="2">second</num> imposition, would not allow the doors to be opened until the truth of the report could be officially ascertained. At their instance, the lord mayor addressed a note to lord Hawkesbury, soliciting information, and stating the occasion of his application. To this note, the chancellor of the exchequer, in the absence of lord Hawkesbury, returned an answer, signifying that no information had been received by government which could be the subject of a public communication, and cautioning the lord mayor against receiving reports through unauthorised channels. An extract of this answer being made public, the Stock Exchange was opened, and business went on as usual. 
<p>The differences which very soon after the signing of the definitive treaty at Amiens, had arisen between the governments of Great Britain and France, most unhappily terminated in war; and, after an interval of less than <num value="13">thirteen</num> months, the rival nations were again involved in inveterate hostility. His majesty's declaration on this subject was laid before parliament on the <datestruct VALUE="1803-05-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>; and <pb id="p.149" n="149"> the strong discussions which arose upon it were, as usual, decided in favor of administration. 
<p>About the middle of June, the minister signified his intention to impose a property tax, on the principle of that so lately repealed on income, but only to the amount of <num value="5">five</num> per cent.; and this measure was, in the course of the session, passed into a law, notwithstanding the opposition of the livery of London, and other considerable public bodies. 
<p>The commencement of the war with France was attended on the part of the <num value="1">first</num> consul with strong threats of invasion; to provide effectually against which, the parliament passed an act to enable his majesty to arm the people <foreign lang=fr>en masse</foreign>; every man from the age of <num value="17">seventeen</num> to <num value="55">fifty-five</num> being rendered liable to enrolment and military duty. Several other acts for increasing the military force of the country were also passed; and, in consequence of these and other measures, the people began to form volunteer associations in every part of the kingdom; yet, no where were greater zeal and ardour displayed than in the metropolis itself. The city of London took the lead; and, on the <datestruct VALUE="-07-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, a special court of aldermen was held at Guildhall, for the purpose of considering of the best plan for arming the citizens at large; and subsequently, meetings were held in all the wards to carry the resolutions of the aldermen into effect. Almost every parish and public office had also its distinct meeting, and many thousands were quickly enrolled as volunteers to defend the independence of Britain. The squares, gardens, and even church-yards of London and its vicinity, soon became places of military exercise; and within little more than <num value="3">three</num> months from this time, viz. on the <num value="26">26th</num> and <datestruct VALUE="-10-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, the number of effective volunteers alone, within the cities of London and Westminster, and the parishes immediately adjacent, amounted to <num value="27077">27,077</num>, as appears by the general orders issued from the horse guards, after the volunteer reviews on those days, by his majesty in Hyde Park.<NOTE>The following are the numbers of each corps mustered on the above occasion.

<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-07-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, a general fund, under the name of the patriotic fund, was established at Lloyd's coffee-house, on an enlarged scale, for the reward of those individuals who should distinguish themselves in the service of their country; for assisting the relations <pb id="p.150" n="150"> of those who might fall in battle, and for relieving the wounded.

<p>In consequence of the negligence of some of those whose duty it was to see the lights put out, Astley's amphitheatre, near Westminster-bridge, was destroyed by fire, early in the morning of the <datestruct VALUE="-09-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>. The immense quantity of inflammable materials it contained, caused the flames to rage with such fury, that nearly <num value="40">forty</num> houses were consumed before the fire could be got under.

<p>In <datestruct VALUE="1804-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct>, a committee of the house of commons was appointed to investigate the proceedings at the recent contested election for Middlesex; and, on their report, made <datestruct VALUE="-07-9"><month reg="07">July</month> the <day reg=9>9th</day></datestruct>, it was resolved,  <QUOTE>that sir Francis Burdett had not been duly elected; that William Mainwaring, esq. was duly elected ; but that he, having by his agents, violated the Treating Act, was thereby incapacitated from sitting in parliament.</QUOTE>  In consequence of this decision, a new writ was issued, and the younger Mainwaring was put in nomination against sir Francis.

The numbers admitted on the poll for Burdett exceeded those for Mainwaring by <num value="1">one</num>; yet the examination into the legality of some of these votes having been deferred by the sheriffs to the day after the election, it was then found that the power of the sheriffs had ceased; and the undecided votes having been deducted, Mainwaring had a majority of <num value="5">five</num>, and he was therefore returned. On a petition of sir Francis, the house resolved,  <QUOTE>that though the questionable votes had been improperly added, it was the prerogative of the house of commons alone to strike them off again; and, therefore, that the return should have been made in conformity to the numbers oon the poll.</QUOTE>  Through this decision, sir Francis became the nominal sitting member, yet the business was not brought to a final issue till the <datestruct VALUE="-02-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, when Mainwaring was declared to have been duly elected. <pb id="p.151" n="151"> 
<p>About the middle of May, a new change took place in the administration, and Mr. Pitt resumed his former office of prime minister; the temporary retirement of Mr. Addington was, in the following January, rewarded by his return to power, with the title of viscount Sidmouth, and the place of lord president of the council. 
<p>Spanish dollars, re-stamped at Mr. Bolton's mint, at Soho, near Birmingham, with his majesty's head, and the inscription, <QUOTE lang=la>Georgius III.

<p>The London docks were opened on the <datestruct VALUE="-01-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>. The vessel appointed for this service was called the London Packet, a fine <num value="2">two</num>-masted vessel from Oporto, laden with wine. Early in the forenoon, she displayed the flags of the different trading nations expected to use the docks, and about noon, she was committed to the charge of the Dock-masters, who conducted her safely across the entrance bason into the great dock, at the north east corner of which she was moored, for the purpose of unloading her cargo. 
<p>The directors of the West India Dock company served originally without any remuneration, and when, towards the end of the last year, it was proposed to give them a salary, the corporation of London came to an unanimous resolution, that it would be highly unbecoming, and inconsistent with the dignity of the city, that the <num value="4">four</num> aldermen, and <num value="4">four</num> common councilmen, who were part of that body, should receive any pecuniary emolument for the execution of a public trust, confided, in so material a degree, to the corporation of London. This resolution was, however, ineffectual, for which reason a motion was submitted to the court of common council, on the <datestruct VALUE="-02-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, to declare such members of that court, as accepted a salary for their duty of directors of the West India Dock Company, ineligible to be elected on any commission or committee of the court, so long as they continue directors with a salary, but upon a division it was carried in the negative by a majority of <num value="15">15</num>.

<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-03-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, the court of common council agreed on a petition to parliament, to enable the corporation to raise a further sum of <measure value="60000l." type=currency><num value="60000">sixty thousand</num> pounds</measure>, for finishing the canal at the Isle of Dogs, which was presented the same day, and an act of parliament was afterwards passed in conformity to the prayer of it. <pb id="p.152" n="152">

These docks, though not so large as either the London or West India Docks, are capable of admitting ships of greater burthen, by having deeper water, and locks of larger dimensions. They consist of <num value="2">two</num> docks and an entrance bason. The dock for discharging inwards covers eighteen acres; that for loading outwards <num value="9">nine</num> acres; the entrance bason is about <num value="3">three</num> acres.

<p>In the spring of <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>, the parliament increased the duties on property <num value="1">one</num> <num value="4">fourth</num>; and, under this advance, the minister estimated its produce at <measure value="6302000l." type=currency><num value="6302000">6,302,000</num>l.</measure> On the <datestruct VALUE="-03-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, the house of commons ordered the speaker's warrant to be issued for the commitment to Newgate of the late sheriffs of Middlesex, for their conduct in respect to the Isleworth millers, &amp;c. during the contest between Burdett and Mainwaring. They were afterwards reprimanded at the bar of the house, and discharged on paying the customary fees. 
<p>A dreadful fire destroyed the whole of the water-mills, at the northern extremity of the cut from the Thames to the Lea, on the <datestruct VALUE="-04-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>; some granaries and dwelling-houses were also burnt, with upwards of <num value="1000">1,000</num> sacks of corn and flour. <num value="2">Two</num> barges afloat were consumed to the water's edge, and all the inflammable materials on the adjacent road and bridge, and even the piles, to a distance of <num value="8">eight</num> feet in the stream, were in a blaze, and presented a spectacle not less singular than terrific.

<p>About this period, the delinquency of lord Melville, whilst treasurer of the Navy, in making use of the public money for his own emolument, through his agent, Alexander Trotter, occupied a very enlarged share of popular attention; and, on the <datestruct VALUE="-04-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, the house of commons, on the motion of Mr. Whitbread, and in despite of every effort of the minister to screen his old associate, came to a series of resolutions, in which it was declared, that lord Melville  <QUOTE>had been guilty of a gross violation of the law, and a high breach of duty.</QUOTE>  On this momentous question, the speaker, Mr. Abbot, gave the casting vote, the numbers on each side, viz. <num value="216">216</num>, being equal.

<p>An address of congratulation on this occasion was presented to his majesty, by the corporation of London, on the <datestruct VALUE="-11-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>; and on the <num value="26">26th</num>, the court of common council came to a resolution to erect a monument in Guildhall, to the memory of lord Nelson, and voted a sword of the value of <num value="200">two hundred</num> guineas to admiral Collingwood, his <num value="2">second</num> in command, and swords of the value of <num value="100">one hundred</num> guineas to admirals lord Northesk, the <num value="3">third</num> in command, and sir Richard Strachan, who, with a small squadron of observation, stationed off Ferrol, had been so fortunate as to fall in with and capture <num value="4">four</num> ships of the line, which escaped from the action off Cape Trafalgar. At the same court, a letter was read from the honourable Mrs. Damer, offering to execute and present to the court a bust of lord Nelson, either in bronze or marble; which were accepted, and the thanks of the court unanimously voted for her liberal proposal. 
<p>But great as were these testimonies of civic gratitude, greater still awaited the remains of the departed hero. A national tribute of respect was paid to him by a public funeral, the ceremonial of which, so immediately connected with the city of London, is here inserted entire: 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-01-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>, the heralds and naval officers, who were to assist in the procession by water, assembled at the governor's house in Greenwich hospital, where they were met by the lord mayor, aldermen, and committee appointed by the corporation of London, and proceeded to their several barges. 
<p>The body was then carried from the saloon, where it had lain in state, through the great hall, out at the eastern portal, round <pb id="p.154" n="154"> the Royal Charlotte ward, to the north gate, and placed on board the state barge. The coffin was covered with a velvet pall, adorned with escutcheons.

<p>Immediately after the great banner, near the entrance of the church, the dean and chapter fell into the procession, attended by the minor canons and vicars choral, &amp;c. of St. Paul's Cathedral, assisted by the priests and gentlemen of his majesty's chapels royal, and the minor canons and vicars choral of the collegiate church of St. Peter, Westminster, and others, who sang the <num value="1">first</num> part of the burial service, set to music by Dr. Croft. 
<p>The Body was borne into the church and choir, preceded by Richmond herald; the great banner borne by a captain; and the gauntlet and spurs, helm and crest, target and sword, and surcoat, by <num value="4">four</num> heralds as before. 
<p>The Coronet by Norroy King of Arms. 
<p>THE BODY, with the supporters of the pall and canopy. 
<p>Garter King of Arms. 
<p>Chief mourner, and assistant mourners. 
<p>Windsor herald. 
<p>The banner of emblems. 
<p>Relations of the deceased; viz. 
<p>Horatio Nelson, esq. commonly called viscount Merton, nephew; G. Matcham, esq. nephew; G. Matcham, esq. brother-in-law; <pb id="p.162" n="162"> William Earl Nelson, sole brother and heir; T. Bolton, esq. nephew; T. Bolton, esq. brother-in-law. Rev. R. Rolfe, T. T. Berney, esq., hon. H. Walpole, hon. G. Walpole, cousins. 
<p>The remainder of the procession followed in the order as before marshalled. 
<p>The officers of arms, and the bearers of the banners, with their supporters, entered the choir, and stood within, near the door; and all above and including the rank of knights bachelors, as well as the staff officers, and the naval officers who attended the procession, had seats assigned to them in the choir. 
<p>The chief mourner, his <num value="2">two</num> supporters, and train bearer, were seated on chairs near the body, on the side next the altar; and the <num value="6">six</num> assistant mourners, <num value="4">four</num> supporters of the pall, and <num value="6">six</num> supporters of the canopy, on stools on each side. 
<p>The relations also near them in the choir; and garter was seated near the chief mourner. 
<p>The prince of Wales, and his <num value="6">six</num> royal brothers, were at the east end of the prebendal stalls, on the south side of the choir. 
<p>The duchess of York was also seated in the choir; her royal highness was conducted to her seat by the bishop of Lincoln. 
<p>The officers of the navy, and the staff officers commanding the troops were seated near the altar. 
<p>The lord mayor, aldermen, recorder, and sheriffs, were in their accustomed seats (the prebend stalls), at the east end of the north side of the choir; their ladies in the closets over them; and the deputation of the common council in the seats immediately under the aldermen. 
<p>The carpet and cushion (on which the trophies were afterwards to be deposited) were laid by the gentleman usher who carried them, on a table placed near the grave, which was under the centre of the dome, and behind the place which was to be there occupied by the chief mourner. 
<p>The coronet and cushion, borne by Norroy, king of arms (in the absence of Clarencieux), was laid on the body. 
<p>The gentlemen of the <num value="3">three</num> choirs ascended into a gallery on the east side of the organ, from which the evening service was performed. 
<p>At the conclusion of the service in the choir, a procession was made thence to the grave, with the banners and bannerolls as before; during which was performed on the organ a grand solemn dirge, composed and played by Mr. Attwood; the officers of arms preceded with the trophies; the gentlemen of the choir of St. Paul's accompanying the body; the gentlemen of the chapels royal and Westminster stationing themselves in a gallery on the west side of the organ; the body borne and attended as before. 
<p>The chief mourner, with his supporters, and near them garter, had seats at the east end of the grave; the train bearer stood behind the chief mourner, and near him the relations of the <pb id="p.163" n="163"> deceased. At the opposite end sat the right reverend the lord bishop of Lincoln, dean of the cathedral, attended by the <num value="3">three</num> canons residentiaries. A supporter of the pall stood at each angle; the assistant mourners, the supporters of the canopy, and bearers of the bannerolls, on either side. On the right of the dean were the chaplains; on the left the officers of the household of the deceased. The great banner was borne on the north, the banner of the deceased, as a knight of the Bath, on the south of the grave; the standard and guidon behind the chief mourner; the trophies in the angles. 
<p>The royal dukes, foreign ambassadors, and naval officers, had seats reserved for them in the front of the south side of the dome. 
<p>At the grave was sung: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Man that is born of a woman, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The remainder of the burial service was then read by the dean; and after the <num value="1">first</num> collect an anthem was sung, selected from Handel's grand funeral anthem. 
<p>There was an excellent contrivance for letting down the body into the grave. A bier was raised from the oblong aperture under the dome, for the purpose of supporting the coffin, by invisible machinery; the apparatus being totally concealed below the pavement. This contrivance prevented all those disagreeable circumstances which too often occur at the funerals of the great. 
<p>Upon a signal given from St. Paul's that the body was deposited, the troops being drawn up in Moorfields, the artillery fired their guns, and the infantry gave vollies, by corps, <num value="3">three</num> times repeated. 
<p>The service of the interment being over, garter proclaimed the style; and the comptroller, treasurer, and steward of the deceased, breaking their staves, gave the pieces to garter, who threw them into the grave. 
<p>The interment thus ended, the standard, banners, bannerolls, and trophies, were deposited on the table behind the chief mourner; and the procession, arranged by the officers of arms, returned. 
<p>The vast space under the dome of St. Paul's cathedral was illuminated by a temporary lanthorn, the contrivance of Mr. Wyatt, consisting of an octagonal framing of wood, painted black, and finished at top by <num value="8">eight</num> angles, and at bottom by a smaller octagon. On it were disposed about <num value="200">200</num> patent lamps; and it was suspended by a rope from the centre of the lanthorn. When drawn up, it illuminated the whole church, and had a most impressive and grand effect, contributing greatly to the magnificence of the spectacle. 
<p>During the whole of this solemn ceremony, the greatest order prevailed throughout the metropolis; and, as the remains of the much-lamented hero proceeded along, every possible testimony <pb id="p.164" n="164"> of sorrow and of respect was manifested by an immense concourse of spectators of all ranks. From the admiralty to the cathedral, the streets were lined with the several volunteer corps of London and Westminster, the militia, and many other military bodies, both cavalry and infantry. 
<p>The lord mayor and corporation of London were entitled to the grateful acknowledgments of the public (who profited by their attention throughout every department), not only for the exemplary manner in which they provided for the peace of the city, but for the comfortable access afforded, under their direction, to all who entered it. 
<p>Upon this celebration it seems hardly necessary to offer a word more, when we consider the general feeling of the nation on the subject. The funeral of a hero, who had achieved, in the service of his country, the greatest naval exploits that were ever performed by any conqueror that has yet existed, was attended by the <num value="7">seven</num> sons of his sovereign, by the chief nobility, gentry, and merchants of the empire, and by many thousands of subjects of all classes, with an universal, an unmixed, and a heartfelt sense of grief for his loss; but at the same time, with a glorious exultation in the deeds by which his life had been adorned, and his death consecrated to immortal honours. 
<p>In the course of the year <datestruct value="1806"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, the obsequies of <num value="2">two</num> other distinguished personages, the right hon. William Pitt, and the right hon. Charles James Fox, were also celebrated in London with great solemnity and funeral pomp. The former died on the <num value="23">23</num>d of January, and was buried on the <num value="22">22</num>d of February; the latter died on the <datestruct VALUE="-09-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>, and was interred on the <datestruct VALUE="-10-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>. These eminent statesmen were both deposited within a few yards of each other in Westminster abbey. 
<p>The decease of Mr. Pitt led to a total change of administration, and the country began to entertain strong hopes that some of its many grievances would be ameliorated; yet the emergencies of government were so great, that <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> measures of lord Henry Petty, the new chancellor of the exchequer, was to increase the imposition upon property to <num value="10">ten</num> per cent.! Measures, however, were taken, in the course of the summer, to open a negociation for peace, under the direction of Mr. Fox, who had been appointed secretary of state for foreign affairs; and had it not been for his lamented death, whilst the discussions were pending, it is more than probable that the sword of destruction would have been once more sheathed. 
<p>A motion was made in the court of common council, on the <datestruct VALUE="-02-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, <QUOTE>That this court, deeply impressed with a sense of the inflexible integrity, transcendant ability, and splendid virtue of the late illustrious minister, the right hon. W. Pitt, do cause a monument to be erected within the Guildhall of this city, to perpetuate his memory, with a suitable incription, expressive <pb id="p.165" n="165"> of their veneration for so pre-eminent a character, and of the irreparable loss this nation has sustained by the death of so exalted and disinterested a statesman.</QUOTE> After a very animated debate, the question was determined in the affirmative by a majority of <num value="6">six</num>. 
<p>At the elections for a new parliament in May, the city of Westminster was the scene of a singular contest, between <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> different interests; and the result most unequivocally demonstrated that the cause of reform was gaining ground. It had been proposed to put in nomination a former candidate, Mr. Paull, who had much distinguished himself in parliament, by urging an inquiry into the conduct of marquis Wellesley, whilst governor of India; yet the intemperate conduct of this gentleman, on several occasions, and more particularly in forcing sir Francis Burdett to fight a duel, in which both parties were wounded, led to another decision, and sir Francis Burdett himself was proposed as a candidate, and placed at the head of the poll. This was effected by a committee of the electors, without any expence to the baronet, and even without his knowledge; his wound having obliged him to be confined to his house, and kept free from agitation. 
<p>On the evening of Thursday, <datestruct VALUE="-10-15"><month reg="10">October</month> the <day reg=15>15th</day></datestruct>, a dreadful accident happened at Sadler's Wells, through a mistaken alarm of fire. The audience were thrown into the greatest confusion, and in the sudden effort made to quit the house by the people in the gallery, many were thrown down whilst descending the staircase, and the pressure from above preventing all possibility of aid, eighteen hapless beings, male and female, were totally deprived of life. Many others were greatly bruised and hurt, and several were restored from a state of apparent death, by medical assistance. 
<p>The public attention in London, during the latter part of <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>, and beginning of the following year, was much engaged by the proceedings against general Whitelocke, for his conduct at Buenos Ayres, in South America; and after a trial of <num value="8">eight</num> weeks before a court martial, assembled at Chelsea-hospital, he was declared unfit and unworthy to serve his majesty in any military capacity whatsoever.<NOTE><BIBL>Brayley's History of London, i. <num value="607">607</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>On the morning of the <datestruct VALUE="1808-09-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>, the whole of Covent-garden theatre was destroyed by fire, together with several adjoining houses. But the destruction of the theatre itself formed but a small part of the calamity; an engine had been introduced within the avenue opening from the piazza, when, dreadful to relate, the covering of the passage fell in, and involved all beneath in the burning rubbish. The remains of <num value="14">fourteen</num> unfortunate sufferers were afterwards dug out in a most shocking <pb id="p.166" n="166"> state; and <num value="16">sixteen</num> others, in whom life remained, were sent to the hospital most miserably mangled and burnt. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-12-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, a numerous meeting of the merchants, bankers, &amp;c. of London was held at the City of London tavern, Bishopsgate-street, for raising a subscription to defray the expence of clothing, &amp;c. the Spanish army, and books having been opened for the purpose, upwards of <measure value="50000l." type=currency><num value="50000">50,000</num>l.</measure> was subscribed within a few weeks afterwards. 
<p>About <num value="2">two</num> o'clock, on the morning of the <datestruct VALUE="1809-01-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, an accidental fire broke out in the king's palace, St. James's, and destroyed a considerable part of the building before it could be got under. The damage in the destruction of property, &amp;c. was estimated at <measure value="100000l." type=currency><num value="100000">100,000</num>l.</measure> 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-02-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, about <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock at night, the superb theatre of Drury-lane was discovered to be on fire, and, though such a vast building, it was entirely consumed by <num value="4">four</num> o'clock on the following morning. 
<p>The entrance of his majesty into the <num value="50">50th</num> year of his reign, on <datestruct VALUE="-10-25"><month reg="10">October</month> the <day reg=25>25th</day></datestruct>, was celebrated as a Jubilee; and every part of the kingdom, but more particularly the metropolis, partook in the festive rejoicings which this event produced. 
<p>At an early hour, the day was ushered in by the ringing of bells in the different churches; and at half past <num value="10">ten</num>, the lord mayor proceeded from the Mansion-house to Guildhall, in the city state coach, drawn by his set of <num value="6">six</num> beautiful grey horses, preceded by the trumpets sounding, and the band of the West London militia playing  <QUOTE> God save the king.</QUOTE>  At Guildhall, his lordship being joined by the members of the corporation, at half-past <num value="11">eleven</num>, the procession moved from thence to St. Paul's church. In the large space between the iron gates and the west door, the West London militia received his lordship with presented arms; and on entering the west door of the cathedral, he was received by the dean and chapter. The centre aisle to the choir was lined on each side by the river fencibles, in full uniform. A most excellent and appropriate sermon was preached by his lordship's chaplain, from the <num value="8">8th</num> of the <num value="2">second</num> of Kings, and the <num value="66">66th</num> verse. <QUOTE>And they blessed the king, and went into their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness the Lord had done for David, his servant, and for Israel, his people.</QUOTE> 
<p>The coronation anthem was performed previous to the sermon, by the full choir, with great effect. The procession returned about <num value="3">three</num> o'clock in the same order. At <num value="5">five</num> o'clock, the corporation were introduced up the grand stair-case in front of the Mansion-house, the trumpets sounding their entrance into the vestibule. The building had been previously decorated with a splendid illumination, consisting of elegant devices of the oak, the shamrock, and the thistle, in coloured lamps. In the centre was a radiant display of G. R. and the crown, with  <QUOTE> Long may <pb id="p.167" n="167"> he reign.</QUOTE>  On entering the grand saloon, lined by the band of the West London militia, playing  <QUOTE>God save the king,</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>Rule Britannia,</QUOTE>  &amp;c. the company were individually received by the lord mayor, in his robes of state. The saloon was brilliantly lighted with several large Grecian lamps, beautifully painted; and, at half-past <num value="5">five</num>, the doors of the magnificent Egyptian-hall were thrown open, illuminated by the blaze of innumerable lamps, arranged round the pillars, and the elegant lustres and chandeliers suspended from the roof. The tables were laid out with the greatest taste, and covered with an elegant and hospitable dinner, the whole of it served in plate; and there was a plentiful supply of excellent wines, of superior quality and flavour. The band continued during the dinner to play several military and other airs. After the cloth was removed, <foreign lang=la>Non nobis Domine</foreign> was sung by several professional gentlemen. The lord mayor then gave  <QUOTE>The king, God bless him, and long may he reign over a free and united people,</QUOTE>  drunk with <num value="3">three</num> times <num value="3">three</num>. When this effusion of loyal feeling had subsided, the grand national anthem of  <QUOTE> God save the king</QUOTE>  was performed by the professional gentlemen present, with appropriate additional verses on the occasion, accompanied by the military band. The toasts which were select and loyal, were followed by  <QUOTE>Rule Britannia</QUOTE>  sung in full chorus by the band and the company present. The illuminations of the public buildings and offices were unusually tasteful and splendid on the occasion; to heighten the public joy, a proclamation was also issued for pardoning all deserters from the fleet, whether they returned to their duty or not. Another proclamation announced the pardon of all deserters from the land forces, provided they surrendered in <num value="2">two</num> months. The lords of the admiralty ordered an extra allowance of <measure value="4l." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> pounds</measure> of beef, <measure value="3l." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> pounds</measure> of flour, and <num value="1">one</num> of raisins to every <num value="8">eight</num> men in his majesty's ships in port, or half a pint of rum each man. <num value="11">Eleven</num> crown debtors were also on this occasion discharged from prison, by the society for the relief of persons confined for small debts. The city of London had recently subscribed <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1000</num>l.</measure> to this useful institution. A form of prayer was likewise composed and ordered by authority to be read in the churches on this occasion. 
<p>Another benevolent trait in the Jubilee transpired through Mr. Percival, who sent a letter to the Society for the Relief of Persons confined for Small Debts, to say, that his majesty had graciously given orders to present them with <measure value="2000l." type=currency><num value="2000">2000</num>l.</measure> from his private purse. In addition to this, his majesty gave <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1000</num>l.</measure> for the liberation of persons confined for small debts in Scotland; and the same sum for those under similar circumstances in Ireland. The merchants of London, pursuant to the example set by the corporation, also gave <measure value="2000l." type=currency><num value="2000">2000</num>l.</measure> for the same charitable purposes.

<p>Towards the latter end of the year <datestruct value="1809"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, the celebrated O. P. 
<hi rend=italics>riots</hi> occupied the public attention. The opening of the theatre 
<hi rend=italics>royal</hi>, Covent-garden, having been protracted till the <datestruct VALUE="-12-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, the managers, in consequence of the great expence attending its building, thought proper to make an advance in the prices of admission; but though the whole rise was <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">one</num> shilling</measure> on the boxes, and sixpence on the pit, this, with the circumstance of having fitted up a number of private boxes, which were thought to infringe upon the room of the galleries, excited a spirit of resistance in the audience which had never before been equalled by its pertinacity and continued duration. As this rise of the prices had necessarily been announced in the papers previous to the opening of the house, the opponents of the managers were prepared to act their parts. Accordingly, on the opening as before mentioned, it appeared that a number of persons were collected in all parts of the house, who, by their noise and riotous behaviour, by barking, shouting, groaning, cat-calls, cries of off! off! old prices, &amp;c. interrupted the performances, or rendered them totally inaudible. A crowd of people also assembled on the outside, actuated with like feelings and designs. This noise and riot having continued with increased violence for <num value="5">five</num> successive nights, Mr. Kemble came forward, and announced the intention of the proprietors to shut up the house; having resolved to submit their accounts and concerns to the inspection of a committee of gentlemen of the <num value="1">first</num> respectability, who should report their true state to the public. This committee consisted of alderman sir Charles Price, bart. M. P.; sir Thomas Plomer, knt. the solicitor-general; John Sylvester, esq. recorder of the city of London; John Whitmore, esq. governor of the bank of England, and John Julius Angerstein, esq. The report of the committee was, that the rate of profit actually received by the proprietors upon an average of the last <num value="6">six</num> years, upon the capital embarked, amounted to <num value="6">6</num> <num value="3">3</num>/<num value="8">8</num> per cent. per annum, charging the concern with only the sum actually paid for insurance on such part of the capital as was insured; and that if the whole capital had been insured, the profit would have been reduced to little more than <num value="5">five</num> per cent.; further stating the opinion of the committee, that the future profits of the new theatre at the proposed advance, would amount to no more than <num value="3">three</num> and a half per cent. per annum, upon the capital expended in the theatre. However, notwithstanding the character of the committee, and the perspicuity of their statements, on re-opening the theatre, much to the surprise and mortification of the managers, the same discordant and hideous noises <pb id="p.169" n="169"> were resumed, with cries of  <QUOTE>Old prices!</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>No garbled extracts to humbug John Bull!</QUOTE>  &amp;c. 
<p>Bills also of this nature were not only renewed every night, but the noisy performances of the rioters were related in such a manner in most of the daily newspapers, as to give them confidence, and even add to their numbers. For the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> nights after the re-opening, these disturbances began at the commencement of the play; but when the rioters were tired of paying the full price, they reserved their opposition till the half price commenced after <num value="9">nine</num> o'clock; and there seemed at last to have been a conspiracy for the attainment of the end in view. The instruments of noise and uproar were now varied and multiplied; for in addition to laughing, singing, and groaning, there was an accompaniment of coachmen's horns and trumpets, dustman's bells and watchmen's rattles. Many persons came with the symbolical characters of O. P. or <hi rend=italics>old prices</hi>
 in their hats, and upon their clothes, forming rings, and making mock-fights in the pit, and sometimes pushing together in a mass; or otherwise joining in the notable O. P. dance, as it was called, which consisted in the alternate stamping of the feet, accompanied with the regular cry of O. P. in noisy and monotonous cadence. The performances of the house all the while consisted in mere dumb shew and pantomimical representation. The proprietors at length, wearied out with this conduct on the part of the auditors, very improperly sanctioned the introduction of several pugilists and prize-fighters in the house, in order to check the refractory; and among these, a Jew, nick-named Dutch Sam. For a while, on the <num value="1">first</num> night the experiment was tried, there was a kind of calm; but no sooner had the curtain been drawn up than the actors were saluted with the customary hisses and groans. The constables and fighting men immediately began to act the parts assigned them, and till the half-pay auditors came in, they had the advantage; but when the pit began to fill, the yell of defiance was renewed, and in <num value="5">five</num> minutes hundreds of fists were clenched in savage hostility. The people were exasperated almost to phrenzy at the idea that brutal force was thus employed to compel them to submission, and the evening closed in disgraceful confusion. 
<p>Whether these tumults would have subsided if Mr. Clifford, a barrister of distinction, had not made his appearance at Covent Garden theatre, is hard to say; but coming into the pit with the letters O. P. in his hat, he was saluted by the familiar and commendatory address:  <QUOTE> Here comes the honest counsellor.</QUOTE>  The people again gave free scope to their clamour, and  <QUOTE> old prices,</QUOTE>  and  <QUOTE>Clifford for ever,</QUOTE>  became the rallying words of the night. Brandon, the box-keeper, got Mr. Clifford apprehended as a rioter, and carried before a magistrate at Bow-street; but he was immediately discharged. Mr. Clifford now indicted Brandon for an assault and false imprisonment, in which indictment Brandon was cast. <pb id="p.170" n="170"> When the jury came in with their verdict for the plaintiff, a shout of universal approbation was heard; and the applauses of the multitude within the hall, were echoed by those without. 
<p>At a public dinner at the Crown and Anchor tavern, a committee had been appointed to defend the persons under prosecution for riot; when the proprietors, thus foiled in their attempt at coercion, thought proper to compromise the dispute between themselves and the public; and Mr. Kemble at length agreed, notwithstanding the losing concern made out by the <num value="1">first</num> committee of reference, <QUOTE>that the boxes should continue at <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">7</num>s.</measure>; that the pit should be lowered to the old price, <measure value="3s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure>; and that the new tier of private boxes in the front of the house should be thrown open and restored to the public at the end of the present season; and that all prosecutions on both sides should be stopped.</QUOTE> <NOTE>Continuation of <BIBL>Brayley's History of London, forming Vol. x, Part II. of the Beauties of England and Wales, edited by the Rev.

<p>A meeting of the court of common council to consider of an address to his majesty respecting the expedition to the island of Walcheren, gave rise to a numerous meeting of the livery in Guildhall, and a <num value="2">second</num> meeting of the common council to reconsider the address voted before, which, when ultimately presented to his majesty on the <datestruct VALUE="-12-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, drew forth a reply from the throne as to the Walcheren business, and other subjects of complaint connected with it in the address, that his majesty was the best judge of the propriety or impropriety of the measures adopted by the executive; and, in fact, that parliament only had a right to make inquiry. But, notwithstanding the high language used on this occasion, and the strenuous wishes expressed by a member of the cabinet for the retention of Walcheren, this important island was evacuated by the British forces on the <num value="23">23</num>d of <datestruct VALUE="1809-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, after they had kept possession of it, with Flushing, and several other strong posts, nearly <num value="6">six</num> months. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1810-01-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, the livery assembled in Guildhall for the purpose of receiving the report of the sheriffs, relative to the presentation of an address and petition lately voted to his majesty. The lord mayor opened the business of the meeting, after which the crier read the report of the committee ; stating in substance, that it was his majesty's pleasure that their petition should be delivered at the secretary of state's office, in consequence of the public levees having been discontinued for the last <num value="4">four</num> years, owing to the defective condition of his majesty's eye sight; and that the liberty to present it at the private levee had been refused. Messrs. Favell and Waithman animadverted in severe terms on the conduct of ministers, and read a series of resolutions, <num value="1">one</num> of which was to instruct their representatives in parliament to support all motions of inquiry, and also the reform in parliamentary representation. The whole were carried unanimously. <pb id="p.171" n="171"> 
<p>The city, about this time, received an augmentation of its numerous commercial facilities in the opening of the navigation of the canal from the river Thames to the town of Croydon, in Surrey. 
<p>After the investigation of the Walcheren expedition had been nearly brought to a close, Mr. Yorke, on the <datestruct VALUE="-02-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, gave notice of his intention to enforce the standing order of the house for the exclusion of strangers. This rule, which is settled at the commencement of every session of parliament, led to a train of events which very materially endangered the peace of the city of London. 
<p>Mr. Yorke, on the <datestruct VALUE="-02-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, complained of a breach of privilege, his conduct in that assembly having been made the subject of discussion in a society called the British Forum; and, on the <num value="21">twenty-first</num>, John Gale Jones, the manager of the society, was summoned to the bar, and committed to Newgate. Though several members expressed their doubts of the policy of his commitment, the power of the house to do so was denied by Sir Francis Burdett alone, who, not having been present at the former debate, moved, on the <datestruct VALUE="-03-12"><day reg="12">twelfth</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, for the discharge of Jones, on the ground that the house had exceeded its authority, which was negatived by <num value="153">one hundred and fifty-three</num> against <num value="14">fourteen</num>. The speech delivered on this occasion, Sir Francis published in a periodical paper on the <num value="24">twenty-fourth</num>, with a letter prefixed, addressed to his constituents, <QUOTE>denying the power of the house of commons to imprison the people of England.</QUOTE> In consequence of this publication, it was moved by sir T. Lethbridge, and decided by a majority, that he had been guilty of publishing a scandalous and libellous paper, reflecting upon their just rights and privileges; and a motion for his commitment to the Tower was made by Sir Robert Salisbury, and carried, after a long and animated debate, by a majority of <num value="190">one hundred and ninety</num> to <num value="152">one hundred and fifty-two</num> voices. The division did not take place till <num value="7">seven</num> o'clock on the morning of Friday, the <datestruct VALUE="-04-6"><day reg="6">sixth</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, when the speaker signed the warrant, and delivered it to the serjeant-at-arms. That officer was informed by Sir Francis that he would be ready to receive him on the next morning, which being viewed by the serjeant as implying that he would go peaceably to the Tower, he retired. Sir Francis, however, alleging the illegality of the warrant, refused to go, unless constrained by actual force, which he was determined to resist. After taking the opinion of the attorney-general, the serjeant, accompanied by a number of police officers, and a detachment of the guards, forced an entry into his house, and conveyed him in a close carriage by Albemarle-street, Bond-street, into the Newroad down the City-road, through Finsbury to the Tower, where it arrived at <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock. <num value="2">Two</num> troops of the life-guards preceded, and the <num value="15">15th</num> light dragoons followed the carriage; the <pb id="p.172" n="172"> latter, having been in Spain, were repeatedly cheered by the people, <hi rend=italics>who</hi>, on the other hand, were considerably irritated by the behaviour of the life-guards, in striking at a number of persons standing up at their own doors and windows. As the military returned, they were assailed with showers of stones, brick-bats, &amp;c. when charging the multitude, several carbines were fired; by which <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> lives were lost, and several persons wounded. 
<p>The mob, assembled round the house of sir Francis, also committed many outrages in the neighbourhood. On the <num value="10">10th</num>, a spirited letter sent by sir Francis to the speaker, after the receipt of his warrant, became a topic of debate, and a resolution was unanimously passed, declaring it a high and flagrant breach of the privileges of the house. 
<p>Sir Francis Burdett commenced actions against the speaker of the house of commons, for issuing the warrant of his arrest and imprisonment; against the serjeant at arms, for executing the warrant generally, and for breaking open the outer door of his house in its execution; and against earl Moira, the governor of the Tower, for illegal imprisonment; the object of sir Francis being to ascertain whether an appeal lay to a court of law, against proceedings of the house of commons acting as accuser and judge, and affecting the liberty of the subject,--if the punishment could be remitted by a court of law, the privilege claimed would be restricted, if not destroyed; in all which he failed, the plea that the warrant being issued by the authority of the house of commons was a legal instrument, and that therefore the arrest and imprisonment were legal, being admitted. Thus the attempt to overthrow this branch of the privilege of parliament served to confirm it, and gave to the claims of the house of commons a solemn judicial recognition. 
<p>A numerous and highly respectable meeting of the livery of London soon after took place at Guildhall, <QUOTE>to take into consideration the alarming assumption of privilege by the hon. the house of commons, of arresting and imprisoning, during pleasure, the people of England, for offences cognisable in the usual courts of law.</QUOTE> Mr. Favell opened the business, and after an animated speech, voted resolutions to the following effect: <QUOTE>That the livery of London were impressed with sentiments of regret and indignation at the extraordinary and unconstitutional proceedings of the house of commons, who, by the arrest of a British subject, had superseded the laws of the land, and set up a capricious and arbitrary power; that the livery were called upon, at this important crisis, to express their unqualified disapprobation of a measure contrary to the principles of the constitution, derogatory to the dignity of the house of commons, and to the glory and happiness of the sovereign and the people of these realms; that the house of commons, by the arbitrary imprisonment of Mr. G. Jones and <pb id="p.173" n="173"> Sir Francis Burdett, had made themselves accusers, judges, and executioners in their own cause; and that the assumption of such a power was a violation of the bill of rights, which declares that the privileges of the house of commons were for the benefit of the people, and ought not to be converted into instruments for their own annoyance and destruction.</QUOTE> Thanks were also voted to sir Francis Burdett for his constitutional opposition to the power unjustly claimed by the house of commons. Subsequently, an attempt was made to get up a counter-resolution at a meeting of various members of the corporation, friends of the ministry, at the London-tavern, Bishopsgate-street; but Mr. Waithman and some of his friends having obtained access to the room, so discomposed the gentlemen, that they retired to a private room, and there moved, seconded, and agreed to certain resolutions in opposition to those of the common hall. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-04-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, lord Cochrane presented a petition from a meeting at Westminster, held that day in Palace-yard, in which the house was called upon to restore to the inhabitants of Westminster, their beloved representative. It contrasted, among other contemptuous expressions, the refusal of the house to enquire into the conduct of lord Castlereagh and Mr. Percival, when distinctly charged with the sale of a seat in that house, with the committal of sir Francis Burdett to prison, enforced by military power. This petition, after some debate, being ordered to lie on the table, on the <datestruct VALUE="-05-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, another was presented by Mr. Byng from Middlesex, which Mr. Perceval looked upon to be a kind of experiment to try how far the forbearance of the house would go in the sufferance of language such as it contained. This petition was rejected, as was also another from the livery of London for the release of sir Francis Burdett and Mr. Gale Jones. Petitions of a similar nature afterwards came in from Berkshire, Reading, Nottingham, Kingston-upon-Hull, Rochester, Southwark, and Sheffield. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1810-01-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, colonel Wardle attended at Guildhall, to receive the thanks and the freedom of the city, in consequence of the part which he took in prosecuting the inquiry into the conduct of the duke of York, and his unfortunate connection with Mrs. Mary Anne Clarke. 
<p>The trial of Mr. Cobbett, in the court of King's Bench, in <datestruct VALUE="1810-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, for a libel on the German legion, excited a great deal of interest. Some of the Cambridgeshire militia having been mutinous, were flogged by these foreigners; and being found guilty of a libel, he was sentenced to <num value="2">two</num> years imprisonment in Newgate, and to pay <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1000</num>l.</measure> to the king. 
<p>During sir Francis Burdett's confinement in the Tower, a deputation from the livery of London, to the number of a <num value="120">hundred and twenty</num>, proceeded from Guildhall in their civic costume, and <pb id="p.174" n="174"> in several carriages, preceded by the city marshalls, other city officers, and Mr. sheriff Wood, colonel Bosville, &amp;c. went to the Tower, where they were met by lord Moira, who complimented them as they passed, and introduced them to sir Francis Burdett, who thanked them for the honour they had done him; after which, they returned in the same order as they came. But as the parliament adjourned for the usual recess in June, the liberation of sir Francis Burdett followed as a matter of course, an event which his friends could not pass over without shewing every public mark of approbation of his conduct in their power. Perhaps on no previous occasion had there ever been a greater\number of people assembled in all the streets leading from Piccadilly to the Tower, than on this, exclusive of carriages, horse and foot, mostly decorated with blue ribbands and mottoes, and escorted with music. Besides the crowds that lined the streets, an immense multitude was collected on Tower-hill, waiting the great event with the utmost impatience, till near <num value="4">four</num> in the afternoon; when it was discovered, that sir Francis had left the Tower quite privately, going down the river a little distance, and then landing, and taking horse to his house at Wimbledon. In the evening, an illumination to a very considerable extent took place; and it was a great satisfaction to all reflecting minds, that the peace of the metropolis was not on this occasion at all disturbed; and that no military force was wanting to preserve public order. 
<p>The last business of importance which occupied the attention of the common council, at the close of this year, was the regulations proposed for the city militia, or rather the abuses connected with this establishment. The report of a committee appointed to examine the subject being brought forward, it appeared they had agreed that it was expedient to petition parliament to enable them to do away the militia acts altogether. The militia system in the city had been carried on at an enormous expence, and no practical benefits arose from it; the actual expenditure being <measure value="5000l." type=currency><num value="5000">5000</num>l.</measure> independent of the trophy tax. The committee further stated, that the information required was peremptorily refused by the colonel, sir John Eamer, and alderman Hunter, who said that they were only responsible to the court of lieutenancy, which was appointed by the crown and of which they were the members! The situation of those gentlemen had become more lucrative than that of any other colonels of militia, or even of the regular regiments. In the West London regiment, there was a balance of more than <measure value="2000l." type=currency><num value="2000">2000</num>l.</measure> in a stock-purse, which the lieutenant-colonel offered to hand over, if sir John Eamer would, in like manner, hand over the balance for his regiment of East London. The sole and entire controul of this stock-purse, was exercised by sir John Eamer himself, who neither allowed the lieutenant-colonel or the major to interfere. The committee could not conceive any reason for sir John Eamer refusing to give them the information <pb id="p.175" n="175"> required, but a wish to conceal from the citizens of London, who paid the tax, the manner in which it was applied. They stated, as the result of their enquiries, that there was then above <measure value="8000l." type=currency><num value="8000">8000</num>l.</measure> in the hands of the colonels of the <num value="2">two</num> regiments, which ought to be handed over to the city treasurer. They believed that the city of London militia was of no use either to the city or county; that the civil power had been gradually found sufficient for its protection; and that the ancient force of trained-bands, or volunteers, was sufficient in any extraordinary emergency. They therefore recommended to parliament to repeal the laws respecting the militia of the city of London, and to make this force more available to the good of the country, by extending its services in common with other regiments of militia.<NOTE><BIBL>History of London continued by the Rev.

<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1811-01-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, Mr. Lyon Levy, a diamond merchant, precipitated himself from the east side of the gallery of the monument, and was killed on the spot; he cleared the rails, but struck against the pedestal. The fall from the top of the gallery enclosure to the ground is about <num value="175">175</num> feet. This was the <num value="3">third</num> instance of the kind that had happened within the last <num value="60">sixty</num> years. On the <datestruct VALUE="1750-06-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>, about <num value="4">four</num> o'clock in the afternoon, a man, supposed to be a weaver, fell from the top. He struck the pedestal, and pitched on a post, which laid open his skull, and he was otherwise most terribly shattered. The next instance was in <datestruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct>, <datestruct VALUE="-07-7"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=7>7</day></datestruct>, when John Cradock, a baker, threw himself over the north side of the monument; he cleared the pediment and iron railing, by falling just on the outside of them, near the north-west corner. 
<p>An extraordinary circumstance took place in the night of the <datestruct VALUE="-05-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, or rather, early in the morning of that day, when an attempt was made to assassinate his royal highness, the duke of Cumberland. On the Wednesday, the day before, the duke had been dining at Greenwich, and returned to town in the evening. He came home to his apartments in St. James's palace about half-past <num value="12">twelve</num>, and went to bed about <num value="1">one</num>. About half-past <num value="2">two</num>, he received <num value="2">two</num> violent blows and cuts on the head. The <num value="1">first</num> impression upon his mind was, that a bat had got into the room, and was beating about his head: he was soon convinced to the contrary by receiving a <num value="3">third</num> blow; he jumped out of bed, when he received a number of other blows: from the glimmering light, reflected from a dull lamp in the fire-place, playing on the moving instrument that inflicted the wounds, they appeared like flashes of lightning before his eyes. He hastened toward a door, near the head of his bed, leading to a small room, to which the assassin followed him, and cut him across his thighs. His royal highness, not being able to find his alarm bells, which there is no doubt the villain had concealed, called with a loud voice for Neale, his valet in waiting, several times, who came <pb id="p.176" n="176"> to his assistance, and together with his royal highness, alarmed the house. The duke desired Neale not to leave him, as he feared there were others in the room. His royal highness shortly after went to the porter's room, and Neale went to awaken Sellis (a Piedmontese, another of the duke's valets). The door of Sellis's room was locked, and Neale called out to him, saying, <QUOTE>the duke is murdered.</QUOTE> No answer being given, the door was broke open, and Sellis was found dead in his bed, with his throat cut from ear to ear. It was supposed that Sellis, conscious of his guilt, imagined when the alarm was given at his door, that they were about to take him in custody, and immediately cut his throat. His blue coat was found folded up in a chair, at <num value="1">one</num> corner of the room, the inside of which was stained with blood. A pair of his slippers were also found in the closet adjoining the duke's chamber. The sword used was a large military sabre of the duke's, and had been lately sharpened. The whole edge appeared hacked and blunted. His royal highness, it was understood, received <num value="6">six</num> distinct wounds: <num value="1">one</num> upon the forehead towards the top of the head; <num value="1">one</num> upon the cheek, another down the cheek, <num value="1">one</num> upon the arm, another by which his little finger was nearly severed from the hand, and another on the thigh, besides several punctures in different parts with the point of the sabre. Mr. Home, the surgeon, being sent for, immediately pronounced that none of the wounds were mortal. A coroner's inquest that sate upon the body of Sellis, returned a verdict <hi rend=italics>offelo de se.</hi> During this examination, the foreman of the jury asked a witness if he thought the deceased had any reason to be dissatisfied with the duke. He replied, on the contrary, he thought Sellis had more reason to be satisfied than any other of his servants; his royal highness had stood godfather for <num value="1">one</num> of his children; the princess Augusta, godmother. The duke had shewn him a very particular favour, by giving him apartments for his wife and family, with coals and candles. He was a little sallow man, whose features retained some regularity, even amid the convulsion into which they had been distorted. The body of Sellis was buried at the corner of Scotland-yard. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-07-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, the earl of Northesk and sir Richard Strachan received at the Mansion-house the swords voted them by the city of London. They were accompanied by the earl of St. Vincent. Appropriate speeches were made by the chamberlain, and answered by the admirals. After this ceremony, they staid and dined with the lord mayor. 
<p>An accident, rather alarming to the commercial interest, occurred on the <datestruct VALUE="-10-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>; the coffer-dam at the Limehouse entrance of the West India docks, erected for the purpose of keeping out the water, while the building of the wing wall of the lock was going on, gave way. At nearly high water, in the afternoon, the workmen employed in excavating the earth for the foundation, having observed the water to burst underneath the piles, were ordered to remove immediately from the dam. The confidence, however, <pb id="p.177" n="177"> reposed in its security, from the immense strength of the braces, &amp;c. was such, that hopes were entertained that it would not entirely give way. But in a few minutes, the piles, which were upwards of <num value="30">thirty</num> feet long, were forced perpendicularly into the air, the water of course filled the dam, and the effects were immediately felt in the bason, though not to the extent that might have been expected. The situation of the dam was so much exposed, that not less than from <num value="30">thirty</num> to <num value="40">forty</num> vessels passed every tide. Many of these in passing, notwithstanding every exertion of the dock-master, came with a severe crash against the dam, and from this circumstance, and the pressure of about <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> tons of water, the blowing up of the whole was not to be wondered at. Fortunately, no lives were lost. 
<p>Early in the month of November, the malady which had fixed upon his majesty in October, could no longer be concealed. After the unwelcome intelligence had been announced to the public, in terms as delicate as possible, preparations were made for issuing daily bulletins at St. James's and the Mansion-house. So early as the <datestruct VALUE="-11-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, it had also been announced by the secretary of state to the lord mayor, that in consequence of the continuing indisposition of his majesty, no chief magistrate of the city could be submitted for the royal approbation, and that his lordship would, of course, be expected to continue in the discharge of the duties of his high office, until his majesty's pleasure could be taken on the appointment of his successor. 
<p>On the meeting of both houses of parliament, on the <datestruct VALUE="-11-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, a report of the physicians on the state of the king's health was brought in, and laid before the members. The final issue of all the debates that followed was, that the prince of Wales should be regent, under certain restrictions; and that the queen should have the care of the king's person; her majesty being assisted by a council. <num value="1">One</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> acts of the regent, after his being sworn in in due form before the privy council, was to receive the address of the lord mayor and common council of the city of London on the occasion: and as he on the same day held a council, all the ministers of state were present, when it was read in a very solemn manner. The address of the city was partly condoling and partly congratulatory. Among the grievances was specified  <QUOTE>the present representation in the commons house of parliament, a reform in which was necessary for the safety of the crown, the happiness of the people, and the independence of the country.</QUOTE>  To this the regent returned a kind and dignified answer, assuring the city that he should esteem it as the happiest moment of his life, when he could resign the powers delegated to him into the hands of his sovereign, and that he should always listen to the complaints of those who thought themselves aggrieved. 
<p>The conclusion of <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct> was marked by an act of sacrilege and robbery in the cathedral of St. Paul's, scarcely parallelled in the <pb id="p.178" n="178"> annals of atrocity. On Saturday night, or early on Sunday morning, <datestruct VALUE="-12-24"><month reg="12">December</month> the <day reg=24>24th</day></datestruct>, this edifice was deprived of the whole of its rich service of plate. The difficulty and ingenuity required to get at the property prove the depredators to have been complete masters of their profession. The articles carried off were as follow:

</TABLE>
 
<p>Several of these articles were used but a few days before at a private ordination, by the bishop of London, and after they were done with were locked up in the plate room, immediately over the vestry, in iron chests, which had on them padlocks, as well as other locks. There are <num value="2">two</num> doors to the room, an inner and an outer <num value="1">one</num>; the former is entirely iron, the other plated and of uncommon strength. To these principal doors, there are several passages leading, all of which have doors always locked, through which persons must pass before they enter the plate-room; and it was only known to a few persons to what apartment these passages led. All these doors remained locked, and it was not till Sunday morning, when the plate was wanted for the church service, that the robbery was discovered. The person who had the plate under his care, opened the passage doors with the keys belonging to them, but the lock of the main door he could not open until he had procured the master-key. He then found that the chests containing the plate had been broken open with an iron crow, or some such instrument, the padlocks haying been opened in the usual way. When the police-officers came from Bow-street to examine the premises, they were of opinion, that the quantity and value of the plate were all previously known, and the crime committed by persons perfectly acquainted with the place. The weight of the whole was <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct> ounces. It had been doubly gilt but a very short time before, which gave it the appearance of gold. The robbers must have passed <num value="9">nine</num> doors or gates, before they could get at the property, The master-key was kept in a closet, where <num value="1">one</num> of the vergers usually placed his silver staff; but that was stolen, although it is probable the key was used to effect the robbery. An attempt to steal the plate from this cathedral had <pb id="p.179" n="179"> been made about <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> years before. The robbers then got as far as a closet where the keys were kept; but whether they were prevented from proceeding, by being alarmed, or by their light going out was never ascertained. 
<p>The state of the currency having rendered some alterations in it necessary, on the <datestruct VALUE="1811-03-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, a rise of <num value="10">ten</num> per cent. in the value of the stamped dollars took place. The increase in the price of silver had become so great, that the dollars, or tokens issued by the bank, had sold for more as bullion, than they would pass for as coin. The directors of the bank, consequently, gave notice that they would in future receive in payment all bank-dollar-tokens at the rate of <measure value="5s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings and <num value="6">six</num>-pence</measure> each; and that all such tokens would in future be issued at the same increased rate, About this time, a new dock was opened at Rotherhithe, near the king's victualling-office, called the east country dock, capable of holding about <num value="80">eighty</num> ships, intended for those from America, the Baltic, the fisheries, and others, containing naval stores. At a common council, holden on the <datestruct VALUE="-04-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct> this year, the recommendation of the Committee of General Purposes for adding <measure value="1500l." type=currency><num value="1500">1500</num>l.</measure> per annum, to the allowance of the late, present, and future lord mayors, was agreed to. The annual expences of the chief magistrates were ascertained to be <measure value="12000l." type=currency><num value="12000">12,000</num>l.</measure> and the receipts about <measure value="6500l." type=currency><num value="6500">6500</num>l.</measure> In another court of common council, Mr. Quin, after paying some high compliments to the prince regent, moved that the freedom of the city should be presented to his royal highness, in a box of heart of oak, which was agreed to unanimously; but, at a subsequent meeting, the deputation that had waited on his royal highness, informed them, that after expressing very sincere gratification from the proofs of the corporation's attachment, he had, on account of the high situation he was placed in, declined accepting the freedom. A singular circumstance relative to the arrest of a dead body occurred this year in the neighbourhood of Hoxton, where a writ of arrest was served upon a dead body by a sheriffs officer and his assistants, as the friends of the deceased were conveying it to Shoreditch burial ground. The officer and his assistants presenting the writ, forcibly removed the body into a shell, and conveyed it away. However, as the friends of the deceased did not come forward to pay the debt, the officer the next day applied to the minister of Shoreditch to inter the corpse, which he very properly refused, unless service was read over it, which would ensure the security of the body in holy ground. The sheriffs of London soon after, caused an enquiry to be made into the circumstances of the case; and finding, that though the officer did not disturb the body himself, he improperly left it with the plaintiff, without having made any communication at the sheriff's office, they therefore dismissed him from his employment. In fact, an action of this <pb id="p.180" n="180"> nature could not be otherwise than revolting to the feelings of the community at large, though it tended to determine a point till then subject to a doubt, as it occasioned lord Ellenborough to declare, the arrest of a dead body was manifestly unauthorised by the laws of England. 
<p>The committee of the corporation of London for carrying into execution the acts of parliament for the improvement of the entrance at Temple-bar and Snow-hill, having come to a resolution that the new street, leading northwards from Picket-street, should, as a memento of respect to their chairman, the alderman, be called Domville-street; he having declined the honour, it was agreed it should be called Pickett-place. 
<p>After nearly <num value="12">twelve</num> months experiment on his majesty's health, about the latter end of October, the report from the queen's council almost extinguished the last hope entertained in favor of his recovery. It was then stated that his majesty's health was not such as to enable him to resume the exercise of his royal authority. His bodily health did not appear to be essentially altered since the date of the last report; but, from the protraction of the disorder, the duration of its accessions, and the peculiar character it had assumed, <num value="1">one</num> of his majesty's physicians thought his recovery improbable, and the other very much so; yet, from his majesty's health and powers of mind, from his memory and perception, from the remaining vigor of his constitution and his bodily health, some of the medical persons in attendance did not entirely despair of his recovery. 
<p>A high breach of private trust was about this time committed by Mr. Walsh, a member of the British parliament, and a stock-broker, who absconded with <measure value="15000l." type=currency><num value="15000">15000</num>l.</measure> the property of the solicitor-general, for which he was apprehended and committed for trial. The affair, however, owing to some informality, was not followed by any punishment, except that of his being expelled the house of commons. 
<p>The session of parliament was opened on the <datestruct VALUE="1812-01-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, by commissioners from the prince regent. The address from the throne, after lamenting the disappointment of the hopes so confidently entertained of his majesty's speedy recovery, congratulated parliament on the skill and valour displayed by the British army in the peninsula of Spain and Portugal, as well as upon the extinction of the colonial power of the enemy in the east; and concluded with an assurance, on the part of the regent, that he would continue to employ all such means of conciliation, for adjusting the existing differences between Great Britain and America, as might be consistent with the honour and dignity of his majesty's crown. 
<p>The king's symptoms had gradually become more discouraging, until, in the beginning of the present year, there remained little hope of his restoration. As separate establishments for the regent and the king were now necessary, the chancellor of the exchequer proposed that an addition of <measure value="70000l." type=currency><num value="70000">seventy thousand</num> pounds</measure> per annum should be made to the civil list out of the consolidated fund; that <pb id="p.181" n="181"> the king's establishment, the annual expence of which was estimated at <measure value="100000l." type=currency><num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> pounds</measure>, should be placed under the control of the queen, who would have the care of his person; that <measure value="10000l." type=currency><num value="10000">ten thousand</num> pounds</measure> per annum be added to her majesty's income; and that a commission of <num value="3">three</num> persons should be appointed for the management of the king's private property. These propositions were agreed to, as was a bill, by which the sum of <measure value="100000l." type=currency><num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> pounds</measure> was voted to the prince regent to meet the expences consequent on his assumption of the royal authority. A grant of <measure value="9000l." type=currency><num value="9000">nine thousand</num> pounds</measure> per annum was likewise voted to each of the princesses, in addition to <measure value="4000l." type=currency><num value="4000">four thousand</num> pounds</measure> payable from the civil list. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-02-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, when the regency restrictions were on the eve of their termination, the prince addressed a letter to the duke of York, expressing his approbation of the conduct of ministers, but intimating a wish that some of those persons with whom the early habits of his public life were formed would strengthen his hands, and constitute a part of his government. <num value="2">Two</num> days after the date of this letter, lords Grey and Grenville, to whom the duke of York had, in compliance with the request of the prince regent, communicated his sentiments, addressed a reply to his royal highness, in which they expressed on public grounds alone, the impossibility of their uniting with the existing government, their differences of opinion embracing almost all the leading features of the actual policy of the empire. On <num value="1">one</num> subject their sentiments were especially at variance : they were so firmly persuaded of the necessity of a total change in the system of governing Ireland, and of the immediate repeal of those civil disabilities under which so large a portion of the people laboured, on account of their religious opinions, that to recommend to parliament that repeal would be the <num value="1">first</num> advice which they would feel it their duty to offer to his royal highness. All hope of forming an extended administration was therefore at an end. 
<p>The ministry now consisted of <num value="2">two</num> parties; at the head of <num value="1">one</num> of which was Mr. Perceval, and of the other the marquis of Wellesley. The differences between these statesmen were partly personal, and partly political: the high and aspiring views of the marquis would not permit him to serve under Mr. Perceval, though he had no objection to serve with him, or to serve under either the earl of Moira or lord Holland; and when it appeared that the regent intended to continue Mr. Perceval at the head of his councils, the marquis resigned his office, and the seals of the foreign department were transferred to lord Castlereagh. On the <datestruct VALUE="-03-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct> lord Borington moved an address to the prince regent, beseeching him to form such an administration as might most effectually call forth the entire confidence and energies of the united kingdom, and afford to his royal highness additional means of conducting to a successful termination, a war, in which were involved the safety, honour, and <pb id="p.182" n="182"> prosperity of the country. Earl Grey stated the points on which lord Grenville and himself had declined a union with the existing administration, which, he said, was formed on the express principle of resistance to the catholic claims; a principle loudly proclaimed by the person at its head, from the moment he quitted the bar to take a share in political life; and where he led, the rest were obliged to follow. With respect to the disputes with America, he wished to bear in mind the principle so well expressed by the late Mr. Burke, that, <QUOTE>as we ought never to go to war for a profitable wrong, so we ought never to go to war for an unprofitable right.</QUOTE> On making bank notes a legal tender, an impassable line of separation existed between him and the present ministry; and as to the war in the peninsula, it was his wish that we should not proceed on the present expensive scale, without having some military authority as to its probable result. He complained of an unseen and separate influence behind the throne; the existence of which was denied by lord Mulgrave, who avowed the hostility of ministers to the catholic claims, which was assumed, by the earl of Moira, as a sufficient reason why they ought to be removed. The motion was negatived. 
<p>The power of the administration appeared now more firmly established than ever, when it was deprived of its leader by a tragical and extraordinary event. On the <datestruct VALUE="-05-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, as Mr. Perceval, chancellor of the exchequer, was entering the lobby of the house of commons, a man, named John Bellingham, shot him through the heart. He staggered, fell, and in a few minutes expired. The assassin, who made no attempt to escape, was examined at the bar of the house of commons, where it was apprehended that this was only the <num value="1">first</num> act of a deep and extensive conspiracy; but it soon appeared that the act was merely in revenge of a supposed private injury. Bellingham having, in a commercial visit to Russia, undergone imprisonment for debt unjustly, as he asserted, and for which he thought the British government was bound to procure him redress, its refusal to take any cognizance of his case made such an impression on his mind, constitutionally disposed to dark melancholy, that he resolved to make a sacrifice of some conspicuous member of the government. On his trial, which took place <num value="4">four</num> days after the commission of the deed, he displayed great self-possession, yet his sanity was involved in doubt; he discovered intellectual powers capable of discerning all the tendencies of human actions; he was found guilty, and was executed opposite Newgate, <datestruct VALUE="1812-05-18"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=18>18th</day>, <year reg=1812>1812</year></datestruct>. 
<p>The day after the assassination of Mr. Perceval a message was sent down to parliament by the prince regent, expressing the wish of his royal highness that a suitable provision should be made for his family. A grant of <measure value="2000l." type=currency><num value="2000">two thousand</num> pounds</measure> a year was accordingly conferred on his widow, and the sum of <measure value="50000l." type=currency><num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> pounds</measure> voted to her <num value="12">twelve</num> children. It was afterwards proposed, and agreed to, <pb id="p.183" n="183"> that the annuity of Mrs. Perceval should, at her demise, descend to her eldest son. 
<p>On <datestruct VALUE="-04-28"><month reg="04">April</month> the <day reg=28>28th</day></datestruct>, the lord mayor, aldermen, sheriffs, and common council of the city of London, waited upon his royal highness at Carlton-house, with the following address and petition; which was read by the recorder: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>May it please your royal highness, 
<p>We, the lord mayor, aldermen, and commons of the city of London, in common council assembled, humbly approach your royal highness, dutifully to represent our deep sense of the difficulties and dangers impending over the country, and anxiously to invite your beneficent attention to the complaints and grievances of your afflicted but faithful subjects. <num value="14">Fourteen</num> months have elapsed since your royal highness acceded to the regency of these kingdoms; at which time, we felt it our duty to submit to you a statement of abuses, which had taken root in the various departments of the government, the speedy correction and removal of which we deemed essential to the prosperity and safety of the empire; and we now again present ourselves before your royal highness, to express our unfeigned sorrow, that during this interval, no efficient measures have been adopted by your ministers, calculated to satisfy the wishes and wants of your people; but that, on the contrary, the same mal-practices and the same false principles of government have been tenaciously pursued and enforced, thereby adding contumely to injury, and extinguishing the spring of public energy in a free nation. We have continued to witness the same system of profligacy in the expenditure of the public money; the same system of governing by undue influence and corruption; the same system of delusion in regard to the circulating medium and finances of the country; the same system of arbitrary and grievous assessment and collection of taxes, by which industry is thwarted, and liberty violated; the same system of introducing into the heart of the country foreign troops; the same system of persecuting the press, by which the value of free discussion on national topics is lost to prince and people; and finally, the same system of coercive restrictions on the freedom of commerce, by which many of our merchants and manufacturers have been involved in ruin, and flourishing districts reduced to beggary. As faithful and loyal subjects, and as the representatives of the <num value="1">first</num> city in your empire, we feel the deepest affliction in being thus compelled to reiterate this enumeration of the mal-practices and mistaken principles of your ministry: we should, however, compromise that sense of public duty, and that character of frankness, which appertains to us as freemen and Britons, were we to disguise the truth, and forbear to express our conviction that your confidential advisers have plunged this great and once flourishing empire into an abyss, from which we can be rescued only by radical reforms, and a total change in our domestic government and <pb id="p.184" n="184"> foreign policy. In a crisis, therefore, which involves the destiny of the greatest empire of these or past times, and of an empire which is blessed by Providence with unequalled natural advantages, and which possesses a people that in all ages have bravely secured their prosperity on the solid basis of public liberty, we feel that we should justly merit the reproaches of our country and of posterity, if, at such a crisis, we were to refrain from laying before your royal highness a faithful representation of the public grievances, and expressing our painful apprehensions for the welfare and the very existence of the nation. We therefore pray, that your royal highness will be graciously pleased to dismiss from your councils those ministers, who have proved themselves so undeserving of the confidence of your people, and call to the administration of the government men of public character and patriotic principles, whose enlarged and liberal policy, if suited to the enlightened character of the nation, whose wisdom and energy would prove equal to the exigencies of the times; whose inclinations would lead them to secure the affections of the people; and whose public spirit would stimulate them to effect those reforms in the commons house of parliament, and in the various branches of the state, which, at this perilous crisis, are absolutely necessary to the restoration of national prosperity, and not less essential to the honour and true interest of the crown, than to the greatness and true glory of the empire.</QUOTE>
 
<p>To which his royal highness was pleased to return the following gracious answer: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>It must always be my inclination to listen with attention to the petitions of any part of his majesty's subjects. For the redress of any grievances of which they can reasonably complain, I have full confidence in the wisdom of parliament, the great council of the nation. 
<p>Being firmly of opinion that the total change in the domestic government and foreign policy of the country, the declared object of your petition to accomplish, would only serve to increase the dangers against which we have to contend, I should be wanting to myself, and to the great interests committed to my charge, if I did not steadily persevere in those endeavours which appear to me best calculated to support the just rights of the nation abroad, and to preserve inviolate the constitution at home. These endeavours can only be attended with success, when seconded by the zeal and loyalty of his majesty's people, upon which I shall continue to place the strongest reliance.</QUOTE>
 
<p>A dreadful high wind occurred on the <datestruct VALUE="-10-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct> this year, by which a lamplighter was blown over the balustrades of Blackfriar's-bridge, and was unfortunately drowned. About <num value="7">seven</num> in the morning, the large iron pipe, affixed on the chimney of colonel <pb id="p.185" n="185"> Calvert's apartments in the Horse Guards, was blown into the front of the building in Whitehall, fortunately doing no injury. A woman and child were killed in Blackfriar's-road, several persons were wounded in the Borough, and many other accidents of the same sort happened throughout the metropolis and in the environs. 
<p>The prosperous state of affairs at home in the year <datestruct value="1812"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, was closed by the official publication of a treaty of peace between Great Britain and Russia, in which it was agreed that the relations of amity and commerce between the <num value="2">two</num> countries should be re-established on each side on the footing of the most favoured nations, the perpetuity of which was now rising in probability every day, from the reiterated defeats and distresses of the French army in Russia, accounts and confirmations of which arrived almost with every post. And if any event served to cast a degree of shade on the brightening prospect, it was on the opening of parliament in December, when, with the deepest concern, the prince regent announced the continuance of his majesty's lamented indisposition, and the diminution of the hopes he had most anxiously entertained for his recovery. The speech also noticed the relations of peace and friendship, restored between his majesty and the courts of St. Petersburgh and Stockholm, and the additional proof of the confidence which the regent had received from his imperial majesty, in the measure which he had adopted of sending his fleets to the ports of this country: a tacit acknowledgement that Britain was almost the only point in Europe invulnerable to the common enemy. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1813-03-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, the monument erected by the corporation of London to the memory of the right honorable William Pitt, in Guildhall, was opened to public view, placed on the south side of that edifice, exactly facing that of his father, the great earl of Chatham. Mr. Canning, attended by lord George Leveson Gower, attended the corporation committee, and, after viewing it, expressed his satisfaction with its design and execution. 
<p>In the course of the spring, as a number of gross and unfounded calumnies had been disseminated against the princess of Wales, the spouse of his royal highness the prince regent, the city thought proper to present an address to her on the <datestruct VALUE="-04-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, expressing that the sentiments of profound veneration and ardent affection which they entertained for her, had never experienced diminution or change, and assuring her that they should always feel, and be ready to give proof of their most anxious solicitude for her health, prosperity, and happiness. To this, her royal highness replied, that it was a great consolation for her to learn, that during so many years of unmerited persecution, the kind and favourable sentiments with which the city of London had at <num value="1">first</num> received her, had undergone no change. Their sense of abhorrence against the foul and detestable conspiracy which perjured and suborned traducers had carried on against her life and honour, she said, was worthy of them. The consciousness of her innocence had supported her through her long, <pb id="p.186" n="186"> severe, and unmerited trials. She added, that she would not lose any opportunity she might be permitted to enjoy of encouraging the talents and virtues of her dear daughter, the princess Charlotte, who would clearly perceive the value of that free constitution, over which, in the natural course of events, it would be her high destiny to preside. This distinguished proceeding, she said, adopted by the <num value="1">first</num> city in this great empire, would be considered by posterity as a proud memorial of her vindicated honour. This address the city presented to her royal highness at Kensington palace, was not, as usual, inserted in the London Gazette. 
<p>This year, vaccine inoculation, the practice of which had met with some obstacles, from a disagreement of opinion in a number of individuals belonging to the faculty, received the unqualified sanction of the Royal College of Surgeons, who entered into an engagement between themselves and with the public, not to inoculate for the small-pox, unless for some special reason, after vaccination; but to pursue, and to the utmost of their power promote, the practice of vaccination, concluding with their recommendation to all the members of the college of correspondent opinions and sentiments of duty, to enter into similar engagements. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-07-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, the city of London, feeling in common with the country at large, the benefits acquired by the successes obtained by marquis Wellington, determined upon an address to his royal highness the prince regent, in which they offered their heart-felt congratulations on the brilliant and decisive victory obtained over the French forces in the neighbourhood of Vittoria, on the <datestruct VALUE="-06-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>; a victory, they observed, so complete and decisive, that it could not fail to produce the happiest effects on the liberties and independence of Europe; and concluding with their earnest hope that it might promote, and finally secure an honourable and lasting peace. To this loyal and patriotic address, his royal highness gave the following answer: 
<p> <QUOTE>I return you my warmest thanks for your dutiful and loyal address. The victory with which it has pleased Almighty God to bless the operations of the allied army under its illustrious commander, field-marshal Wellington, cannot fail to have excited, in every part of the united kingdom, the strongest emotions of exultation and gratitude; and it is with the utmost satisfaction that I receive such a testimony of feelings which animate the metropolis of the empire, on this most interesting and important occasion. Success so splendid and decisive, so glorious in all respects to the arms of his majesty and his allies, is calculated to contribute most essentially to the establishment of the independence of the peninsula on a firm and lasting foundation, and to the improvement of our prospects in all other parts of the world.</QUOTE> 
<p>About this time, the foundation of the new prison in Whitecross street, near Cripplegate, was laid. This extensive building is <pb id="p.187" n="187"> solely appropriated to the imprisonment of London and Middlesex debtors, instead of confining those unfortunate persons, as before, in the criminal prisons of the metropolis. Mr. alderman Wood, as chairman of the committee appointed to superintend the building, laid the <num value="1">first</num> stone, attended by the dukes of Kent and Sussex, and several other persons of distinction. 
<p>The expression of the public mind on the subject of the recent victories was not confined to addresses. The metropolis was illuminated, more or less, on the nights of the <num value="5">5th</num>, <num value="6">6th</num>, and <datestruct VALUE="-07-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>. The fronts of Carlton-house and Somerset-house, exhibited each a blaze of light, with the name of Wellington formed with lamps, and allusions to the hero's exploits. The India-house, the Mansion-house, Apsley-house, (marquis Wellesley's, Piccadilly,) with the houses of the Spanish ambassador, and the Spanish consul, were illuminated with much spirit and elegance: and many individuals made displays not less honourable to their patriotism, than to their taste and judgment. 
<p>At a common-hall on the <datestruct VALUE="-09-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>, Mr. alderman Domville and Mr. alderman Wood being returned by the livery of London as proper persons to fill the important office of lord mayor of London, the court of aldermen having proceeded to a scrutiny, Mr. Domville was declared duly and unanimously elected. 
<p>In the beginning of October Dr. Howley's election to the bishopric of London, was confirmed at Bow church, Cheapside, being the oldest church in the diocese, by sir William Scott, the vicar-general of the province of Canterbury, with, the usual ceremonies. On the morning of the <num value="3">3</num>d, Dr. Howley was consecrated bishop of London at Lambeth chapel. At half past <num value="10">ten</num> the queen, (who had expressed a wish to be present,) with <num value="2">two</num> of the princesses, were received at Lambeth palace by the archbishop, who conducted them into the drawing-room, where Dr. Howley, the bishop elect, the bishops of Oxford, Gloucester, and Salisbury, the vicar-general, in their full robes, and other distinguished characters, paid their respects to them, after which they proceeded to his grace's chapel. The queen and princesses were conducted into Mrs. Sutton's family gallery. No person was admitted into the body of the chapel except those engaged in the ceremony.. Dr. Howley took his seat the last on the right of the altar. The morning service was read by <num value="1">one</num> of the archbishop's chaplains the bishop of Gloucester read the epistle; the bishop of Oxford the gospel: the sermon was preached by the Rev. Dr. Goddard, who took a general view of the established church from the period of the reformation; and dwelt upon the divine institution and expediency of the episcopal order. 
<p>On Saturday, <datestruct VALUE="-11-21"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=21>21</day></datestruct>, the whole city of London was thrown, as it were, into a state of temporary delirium; the heart cheering news of a counter-revolution in Holland, in which the French were every where ejected, while the allies were marching in to the assistance of the natives, reached town this afternoon. This <pb id="p.188" n="188"> gave birth to an extraordinary gazette, and the firing of the Park and Tower guns on Sunday evening. From the gazette, and by the arrival of baron Perponcher and M. Fazel, it appeared that a counter-revolution had broke out in part of the United Provinces on the preceding Monday, the <datestruct VALUE="1813-11-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, when the people of Amsterdam rose in a body, proclaiming the house of Orange, with the old cry of  <QUOTE>Orange Boven</QUOTE>  and universally putting up the Orange colours. This example was immediately followed by other towns of the provinces of Holland, as Haerlem, Leyden, Utrecht, the Hague, Rotterdam, &amp;c. where the French government was dismissed, and a temporary government proclaimed in the name of the prince of Orange, until his serene highness's arrival. In fact, the proclamation issued by the new governor of the Hague, excited as much joy here as it was possible even for the Dutch to feel, as in a commercial view, it seemed equally as applicable to us as themselves. 
<p>That no time might be lost, on Thursday the <datestruct VALUE="-11-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, his serene highness the prince of Orange left London, and embarked with the earl of Clancarty, and was joyfully received by his ancient and faithful subjects. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-12-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct> a proclamation for a general thanksgiving was issued from Carlton-house, to be observed in England, Ireland, and Scotland, on the <datestruct VALUE="-01-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct> following, for the series of signal and glorious victories over the enemy, and the inestimable benefits which this kingdom had received at the hands of Almighty God, &amp;c. This drew forth an ardent and loyal address from the city of London to the prince regent on the late glorious events; highly congratulating him on his recent declaration on the opening of parliament, <QUOTE>that no disposition to require from France sacrifices inconsistent with her honour, or just pretensions as a nation, would ever on the part of his royal highness or his allies, be an obstacle to peace.</QUOTE> In the answer returned to this address, the prince, after expressing his satisfaction with the dutifulness and loyalty of the sentiments, added that great and unremitted exertions were still necessary; but that he was persuaded that any further sacrifices required would be made by the citizens of London, and by all descriptions of his majesty's subjects, with the same fortitude and perseverance which had distinguished the country throughout the whole of the present contest; the expected reward of which would be an honourable and lasting peace. 
<p>This year, <datestruct value="1814"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, had scarcely commenced, when it became generally known that the prince regent and his ministers, acting up to the spirit of those pacific professions so recently made, had dispatched lord Castlereagh to the head quarters of the allies at Chatillon-sur-Seine, in France, which country he never quitted till he had happily completed the object of his mission. If any thing ominous had, as usual in the darker ages, been attached to the appearances of the weather when his lordship set out from London, <pb id="p.189" n="189"> the happy issue of his embassy would have sufficiently exposed the futility of such auguries: perhaps his lordship's departure from London on Monday, <datestruct VALUE="1813-12-27"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=27>27</day>, <year reg=1813>1813</year></datestruct>, about <num value="7">seven</num> in the evening, was attended by a fog, which, for its density and duration might have been equalled, but could not possibly have been exceeded at any time. Fortunately, his lordship proceeded on the Essex road towards Harwich without interruption; it was not so with the prince regent, who intending to pay a visit to the marquis of Salisbury, at Hatfield house, Herts, was obliged to return to Carlton house, after <num value="1">one</num> of his out-riders had fallen into a ditch on this side Kentish town. 
<p>It was remarked that the winter of <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>, in several particulars, resembled the present: but there was nothing in the memory of man to equal the continued fall of snow for nearly <num value="8">eight</num> days, in the beginning of the winter of <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>-<num value="14">14</num>. Almost <num value="12">twelve</num> weeks the wind blew continually from the north and north-east, and was intensely cold. A short thaw also, which scarcely lasted <num value="1">one</num> day, only rendered the state of the streets <num value="10">ten</num> times worse. Hence the masses of snow and water became so thick that it was with difficulty that hackney coaches with an additional horse, could plough their way through. In some streets in the city men were employed on the Sundays to remove the snow. Almost all trades and callings carried on in the streets were stopped, which considerably increased the distresses of the lower orders. Few carriages, even stages, could travel on the roads, which even about town seemed deserted. From many buildings, icicles full a yard and a half long, were seen suspended. The house water pipes were mostly frozen, whence it became necessary to have plugs in the streets for the supply of all ranks of people. <num value="1">One</num> fall of snow continued <num value="48">forty-eight</num> hours incessantly, after the ground had been covered with a condensation, the result nearly of <num value="4">four</num> weeks' continued frost. 
<p>In the meanwhile, the river Thames, in consequence of the continuance of the severe weather, began to assume a singular appearance: vast quantities of snow were seen almost every where on the surface, and being carried up and down by the tide and the stream, or collected where the banks or the bridges supported the accumulation, a sort of glaciers were formed, united <num value="1">one</num> moment, and crashing, cracking, and dashing away the next. At times too, when the flood became elevated by the spring tides, and the current ran strongly, the small ice islands floated away, passing through the arches with a rapidity scarcely to be conceived, according as the wind or tide prevailed. In fact, the conglomeration upon the whole, presented more of the appearance of the rudeness of the desert, than that of a broad surface, to which the eye of the observer had been mostly accustomed. 
<p>Paths were formed by strewing ashes, &amp;c. direct and diagonal from shore to shore, and frequent cautions were given to those heroines whose curiosity induced them to venture on the glassy plain, <pb id="p.190" n="190"> to be careful not to slip off the kirb. Booths of all kinds for constituting what might be called frost fair, were erected in great numbers. Many of these were distinguished by appropriate signs, as the Waterman's Arms, the Crown, the Mag Pye, the Eel-pot, &amp;c.; and <num value="1">one</num> wag had a notice appended to his tent, signifying <QUOTE>that several feet adjoining his premises were to be let on a building lease.</QUOTE> 
<p>Among the most rational of the oddities collected on the Thames on this occasion were a number of printers, who, with their presses, pulled off various impressions of names, verses, &amp;c. which they sold for a trifle. 
<p>On Saturday, <datestruct VALUE="-02-5"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=5>5</day></datestruct>, notwithstanding there were evident signs of the breaking of the ice, and even very early on the Sunday morning some imprudent persons passed over from Queenhithe to Bankside. About <num value="2">two</num> in the morning also some persons carousing in a booth opposite Brooke's wharf, were very near losing their lives; the tide beginning to flow at London bridge, and being assisted by the thaw, the booth was hurried along with the quickness of lightning. The men in their alarm neglected the fire and candle, which communicating with the covering, set it in a flame. In this singular situation they succeeded in getting into a lighter, which had broken from its moorings; but this was dashed to pieces against <num value="1">one</num> of the piers of Blackfriars bridge; upon this some of the men got out, and were taken off safely; the rest had thrown themselves into a barge while passing Puddle dock. Long before noon, on Sunday, the whole mass of the ice had given way, and forcing itself through the bridges, carried every thing before it. Numbers of boats were now busily employed saving rafts of timber, and towing drifted barges, &amp;c. on shore. The passage of the river at length became quite free, though the coldness of the weather, and the snow was not clear off the surface of the ground in the environs of the city before Sunday, <datestruct VALUE="-03-20"><month reg="03">March</month> the <day reg=20>20th</day></datestruct>, when the wind finally changed from the north-east.<NOTE><BIBL>Frostiana; or, a History of the River Thames in a Frozen State, &amp;c. &amp;c.</BIBL> Printed and published on the Ice on the River Thames.</NOTE>
 
<p>Upon the whole, it did not appear that the late winter, notwithstanding its length, was remarkable for intensity of cold. Fahrenheit's thermometer had been frequently observed at <num value="20">20</num>, several times at <num value="15">15</num>, more than once at <num value="10">10</num>, once at <num value="6">6</num>, and once so low as <num value="2">2</num> below <num value="0">0</num>, that is--to say <num value="34">34</num> degrees below the freezing point. This happened on the morning of Christmas day, <datestruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>, supposed to have been the most intense degree of cold ever known in England. 
<p>On Saturday morning, <datestruct VALUE="-02-12"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=12>12</day></datestruct>, about a quarter past <num value="6">six</num> o'clock, a fire began to issue from the Custom-house, and to burn with such violence, as to threaten the most destructive consequences. Numerous engines soon arrived; but about <num value="7">seven</num> o'clock, the flames had made so rapid a spread, that little hope was entertained of saving <pb id="p.191" n="191"> any of the building. The exertions of the firemen and others were then directed to the warehouses and other buildings on both sides Thames-street, when a report that a great quantity of gunpowder was deposited in the vaults, caused all the spectators, as well as the firemen, to withdraw to a distance. At half-past <num value="9">nine</num>, this rumour was proved not to have been an idle <num value="1">one</num>. The explosion which then took place was heard and felt for several miles; burnt paper, leaves of books, &amp;c. were scattered as far as Hackney, Low Leighton, &amp;c. Numbers of persons, soon after the breaking out of this fire, were seen running about Thames-street, almost naked, and some were severely scorched. At <num value="1">one</num> o'clock, the whole of the Custom-house and the adjoining warehouses were reduced to ashes; but, about <num value="3">three</num>, all fear of the further extension of the flames had subsided. <num value="10">Ten</num> houses opposite were burnt down by <num value="2">two</num> o'clock; and among them Holland's coffee-house; the Rose and Crown, and Yorkshire Grey public houses; the King's Arms was much damaged. A man standing close to <num value="1">one</num> of the persons employed in holding a branch pipe, was killed by the explosion of the gunpowder before mentioned; but the branch-holder did not sustain the least injury. The fire is thought to have originated in a fire-flue in <num value="1">one</num> of the offices of business adjoining a closet in the housekeeper's room, all upon the <num value="2">two</num> pair of stairs. Miss Kelly, the house-keeper and her sister, had a narrow escape, bursting in a manner, through the flames with her brother, captain Hinton Kelly, who had returned from Brighton only the day before. It was but too soon ascertained that <num value="2">two</num> poor orphan girls in her service had perished in the flames, it being impossible for Miss Kelly to awaken them, or to get to the chamber where they slept. The rest of the servants had the good fortune to get to the top of the building, from whence, by the help of ladders, they were soon removed. The books and papers of the searcher's office on the quay were saved, being conveyed out of a window and put into a lighter lying along side; but, in the secretary's office, documents nearly <num value="100">100</num> years old, with the bonds in the Coast Bond Office, were lost. This Custom-house was erected in <datestruct value="1718--"><year reg="1718">1718</year></datestruct>, upon the ruins of the <num value="1">first</num> of this kind in London, built in <datestruct value="1559--"><year reg="1559">1559</year></datestruct>. 
<p>A fraud of a most extraordinary kind was played off in the metropolis on Monday, the <datestruct VALUE="-02-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, when between <num value="11">eleven</num> and <num value="12">twelve</num> in the forenoon, a person wearing a white cockade passed rapidly by the Royal Exchange in a post chaise, drawn by <num value="4">four</num> horses, and decorated with sprigs of laurel. Much about the same time, a chaise similarly decorated, and a person of the same description within, was seen in the vicinity of Downing-street; not proceeding directly thither, but wandering about, apparently in want of a guide. All the city and all the west end of the town were in a tumult of joy. The approaches to the public offices were crowded with persons anxiously intent upon learning the cause of this <pb id="p.192" n="192"> extraordinary arrival. Thousands of persons supposing the guns would fire, collected about the west end of the town chiding the delay, it being supposed an absolute fact, that the Tower guns had already fired; although, it was at the same time made matter of surprise and blame in the city that the Tower guns did not open their mouths, hundreds were quite certain that those in the park had been blazing away long before. Down till <num value="5">five</num> o'clock, the crowd was still waiting in the park for the firing of the guns; but in the city, the business was long before that time suspected. Omnium fell back from its previous high and sudden elevation, in proportion as the delusion vanished, leaving multitudes of cheated speculators cursing the deception practised on them. In the course of the evening, an attempt was made to revive the trick. It was asserted by the authors of this story, that the mission of the man with the white cockade was not to the British government, but to the French princes here; and that he had certainly arrived at the residences of the prince of Conde and the duke of Bourbon. Inquiry in this quarter, also proved the whole trick, and nothing remained but to set down and ruminate upon the consequences. 
<p>It appeared certain that a chaise and <num value="4">four</num> decorated as before related, came <num value="1">first</num> towards Whitehall from Westminster bridge; afterwards got back over that bridge again, as it is sometimes done on the return after landing the fare; then went round by the Borough over London bridge, as if to gratify the city with the sight in passing to the westward. At length being set down at the Marsh gate, Lambeth, the pretended messenger, whose name was De Berenger, stepped into a hackney coach, and was traced to a house then recently taken by lord Cochrane, in Green street, Grosvenor square. 
<p>On Wednesday, <datestruct VALUE="-06-8"><month reg="06">June</month> the <day reg=8>8th</day></datestruct>, as lord Cochrane and others had been implicated in this popular deception, in consequence of the investigations of the committee appointed by the Stock Exchange, their trial came on for conspiring to defraud that body, by circulating false news of Bonaparte's defeat, his being killed by the Cossacks, &amp;c. to raise the funds to a higher price than they would otherwise have borne, to the injury of the public, and to the benefit of the conspirators. Mr. Gurney called witnesses to prove that colonel de Bourg, who pretended to have been conveyed in an open boat from France, and landed at Dover, was Random de Berenger, that he wrote to admiral Foley, who but for the haziness of the weather, would have telegraphed the intelligence to the Admiralty. The effects of this news in town was proved to have raised the premium on omnium from <num value="27.50">27 1/2</num> to <num value="30">30</num> per cent. But no confirmation having been received at the Admiralty, omnium began again to get down, when an important auxiliary to this fraudulent contrivance appeared. This was the arrival of <num value="3">three</num> apparently military officers in a post chaise and <num value="4">four</num> from Northfleet, having the drivers and horses decorated with laurel. These persons were named Sandon, M&lsquo;Rae, <pb id="p.193" n="193"> and Knight. To spread the news they drove over Blackfriars bridge, through the city; but when they were ultimately set down near the Marsh gate they tied up their cocked hats, put on round ones, and walked away. This last contrivance raised omnium to <num value="32">32</num> per cent. Much evidence was adduced by the counsel to connect the parties, and to shew that the <num value="2">two</num> arrivals were branches of the same conspiracy. The amount of the stock in the possession of lord Cochrane and Messrs. Cochrane Johnstone and Butt was nearly <num value="1">one</num> million. Mr. serjeant Best for the defendant, called lord Yarmouth, colonel Torrens, and admiral Beresford, to prove that lord Cochrane was acquainted with De Berenger on honourable grounds, not arising from stock jobbing transactions, having exerted himself to get him into the navy; likewise that lord Cochrane had authorized his broker to sell his stock whenever he could get a profit of <num value="1">one</num> per cent. An <hi rend=italics>alibi</hi> was set up on the part of De Berenger, and his servant, Smith, and his wife, were called to prove that he slept at home on the night of Sunday, <datestruct VALUE="-02-20"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=20>20</day></datestruct>; and M&lsquo;Guire, a servant at a livery stable, deposed that he saw him at Chelsea that evening; but they varied as to the dress she wore. The court sat till <num value="3">three</num> next morning, and then adjourned; but meeting again at <num value="10">ten</num>, Mr. Gurney having replied, lord Ellenborough took <num value="2">two</num> hours to sum up. The jury then retired <num value="2">two</num> hours and a half: on their return, they found all the persons indicted guilty! Monday, <datestruct VALUE="-06-13"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=13>13th</day></datestruct>, lord Cochrane appeared in person in court, and earnestly solicited a new trial, declaring that he had affidavits in his hand on which he founded his application. When refused to be heard, his lordship observed it was indeed hard that he should be denied the opportunity of doing justice to his character, because the guilty dared not appear in the place in which he then stood. On Monday, <datestruct VALUE="-06-19"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=19>19</day></datestruct>, lord Cochrane and the others being brought up for judgment, he was sentenced to pay a fine of <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">one thousand</num> pounds</measure> to the king; to be set upon the pillory in front of the Royal Exchange, and to be imprisoned <num value="12">12</num> calendar months; Richard Gawthorne Butt received the same judgment, and John Peter Holloway, Charles Random De Berenger, Henry Lyte, and Ralph Sandom were also sentenced to a year's imprisonment in the Marshalsea.<NOTE><BIBL>Rev. J. Nightingale's Hist. of Lond. ii. <num value="89">89</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The war which had been carried on in France by the allies after the breaking up of the negociations opened at Chatillon, with unexampled success, having excited a general expectation of its conclusion in the overthrow of Bonaparte; on Tuesday, <datestruct VALUE="-04-5"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=5>5</day></datestruct>, the news that the allies had entered Paris, burst upon the citizens of London from all quarters; and on Friday, <datestruct VALUE="-04-8"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=8>8</day></datestruct>, the intelligence of Bonaparte's resignation was received, when a notice being given by lord Bathurst that the public offices would be illuminated during <num value="3">three</num> successive nights, this became general on the Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday evenings, following. The principal streets <pb id="p.194" n="194"> were crowded to excess by persons of all ranks, in whose hats and bosoms the white cockade and sprigs of laurel were conspicuous. Many carriages of the nobility and gentry also paraded up and down, their servants and horses wearing white ribbons and laurel branches. The colours of England and France, united, were displayed from many houses. The illuminations at Carlton house were among the most splendid, The columns in the front were encircled with spiral lines of lamps; and the cornices and other parts studded with them. Along the front were the words-Russia. Austria. <foreign>Vivent les Bourbons.</foreign> Prussia. England. Transparencies of all descriptions were very numerous, and some of them extremely fanciful. At Carlton house, on the night of the <num value="13">13th</num>, the great gates on the east and west were thrown open, and <num value="6">six</num> hogsheads of strong ale were trundled into Pall-Mall for the populace. In a moment the heads of each cask were stowed; and, for want of proper vessels, the mob used their hats to drink out of. The screaming of the women, the huzzaing of the men, and the firing of guns and pistols, seemed to rend the skies. Drums, trumpets, hand-bells, marrow bones and cleavers, added to a confusion of sounds of which scarcely any conception can be formed. 
<p>During the interval occupied by these rejoicings, as Louis the Eighteenth, who had long resided at Hartwell, in Buckinghamshire, had been invited to London by the prince regent, it was observed, that upwards of <num value="400">four hundred</num> years had elapsed since the metropolis of the British empire had beheld an acknowledged king of France within its walls. The French king having been indisposed, on Monday, <datestruct VALUE="-04-18"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=18>18</day></datestruct>, found himself so much recovered, that he sent an express to the prince regent and his own relatives that he would undertake the journey on Wednesday the <num value="20">20th</num>. Every court arrangement was made to suit his convenience in coming to London. The duchess of Oldenburgh, who had been some time in town, postponed her intended journey to Windsor; and the queen and princesses, on receiving notice of the king of France's intention to be in town, also signified their royal pleasure to have the honour of meeting him in London. 
<p>Louis was received with every mark of respect, and on his arrival at Grillon's hotel in Albemarle street, he invested the prince regent, who had accompanied him from Stanmore, with the order of 
<foreign>St. Esprit.</foreign> On the succeeding Saturday he departed in a private travelling carriage, escorted by a detachment of horse from the <num value="23">23</num>d regiment; he was received at Dover by the prince regent, who, after seeing him on board, returned to London. 
<p>The restoration of peace, after so long and arduous a struggle, was hailed in London, and the empire generally, with the most lively satisfaction; and the metropolis was converted into a scene of gaiety never surpassed on any other occasion, by the arrival, on <datestruct VALUE="-06-6"><month reg="06">June</month> the <day reg=6>6th</day></datestruct>, of the emperor of Russia and the king of Prussia; the latter, accompanied by his <num value="2">two</num> eldest sons, prince <pb id="p.195" n="195"> William, his brother, prince Frederic, his nephew, prince Augustus, his cousin, marshal Blucher, and baron Humbodlt, with a number of attendants. Counts Platoff, Barclay de Tolli, and Tostoi, accompanied the emperor. They arrived in London quite <hi rend=italics>incog.</hi> The emperor entered London about half-past <num value="2">two</num>, in the carriage and <num value="4">four</num> of count Lieven, without a single attendant; lords Yarmouth and Bentinck preceding him in a post-chaise: the king of Prussia, his sons, and their numerous suite, also arrived at Clarence-house, which had been fitted up for them in a very private manner; and, when the emperor came to the Pulteney hotel, in Piccadilly, he ascended the <num value="1">first</num> flight of stairs, before prince Gazarin announced his arrival. But though the public felt rather mortified at being cheated of a sight, when his imperial majesty appeared at the balcony, and bowed, he was always received with a hearty welcome. About <num value="6">six</num> in the evening, when marshal Blucher arrived at Carlton house, all attempts to keep the populace out of the court-yard were in vain: the <num value="2">two</num> sentinels at the gate, with their muskets, were laid on the ground; and the porter was overpowered. To indulge the public, the doors of the great hall were thrown open on the occasion; and here the <num value="1">first</num> interview of the general with the prince took place. 
<p>It was soon apparent that the pursuits of the emperor Alexander were similar to those of his sister, the duchess of Oldenburgh, having a perfect indifference to show and parade; and that, to observe him well, it would be necessary to be as early a riser as himself. On Tuesday morning, the <num value="7">7th</num>, he breakfasted by <num value="8">eight</num>, and walked in Kensington-gardens with his sister. He returned to the Pulteney Hotel at <num value="10">ten</num>, and then proceeded in <num value="1">one</num> of the prince regent's carriages to view Westminster-hall and the abbey. His sister and himself next visited the British Museum. At <num value="1">one</num>, he held a levee at Cumberland-house, and was visited by the prince regent. Between <num value="5">five</num> and <num value="6">six</num>, he attended her majesty's court; and at <num value="7">seven</num>, her majesty, the princesses, the allied sovereigns, their families, &amp;c. dined with the prince regent at Carlton house. 
<p>On Wednesday, <datestruct VALUE="-06-8"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=8>8</day></datestruct>, the emperor Alexander rode in Hyde park, between <num value="7">seven</num> and <num value="8">eight</num> o'clock in the morning, accompanied by lord Yarmouth and colonel Bloomfield. From thence they rode to Westminster, crossed the bridge, passing through the Borough into the city. They passed the Mansion-house and the Exchange before <num value="9">nine</num> in the morning, and turning round by the Bank and the Excise-office, proceeded through Finsbury-square, along the City-road, and the New-road towards Paddington, and returned down the Edgeware-road and Hyde-park, to the Pulteney Hotel. After breakfasting, the emperor, the duchess of Oldenburgh, and a party of distinction, left the hotel in their carriages, without military escort, and proceeded along the Strand and Fleet-street to St. Paul's cathedral. After viewing this, they proceeded to the London docks, and returned through the Strand. <pb id="p.196" n="196"> 
<p>On Thursday, the <num value="9">9th</num>, the allied sovereigns breakfasted together at <num value="7">seven</num>, at the Pulteney hotel, with the grand duchess of Oldenburgh, and afterwards set out, accompanied by marshal Blucher, general Platoff, and a numerous suite, for Ascot-heath races; and, arriving at Richmond-hill at <num value="9">nine</num>, the whole party walked on the terrace, and expressed themselves quite delighted with the beauty of the scene. They afterwards visited Hampton-court, with as much attention as the shortness of the time would admit, assuming no character of pomp, but conversing familiarly with all. 
<p>On Saturday, the <num value="11">11th</num>, about <num value="11">eleven</num>, the emperor and his sister again rode through the Strand into the city, to visit the Bank. They entered by the Lothbury-gate, and attended by the governor, deputy-governor, and court of directors, were conducted through the various departments of that extensive building, and afterwards partook of a cold collation. The emperor, returning to his state apartments, in the duke of Cumberland's house at St. James's, was waited on about <num value="6">six</num> by the lord mayor, recorder, sheriffs, and the whole of the aldermen and common council, in their civic robes. On the same evening, the emperor of Russia and the king of Prussia visited the king's theatre, as before mentioned; and on Sunday attended Hyde-park. Here the sovereigns, the princes, with the venerable Blucher, making their appearance on the ride, it seemed as if every horse in the metropolis had been furnished with a rider to meet them. The pressure was intolerable; the horses were so jammed together, that many noblemen and gentlemen had their knees crushed, and their boots torn. Blucher was so cruelly persecuted with kindness, that he alighted and took refuge in Kensington gardens, declaring this to be more formidable to him than all the enemies he ever encountered. In the confusion and pressure which occasioned it, all sense of courtesy was abandoned, and each individual was, in a manner, compelled to fight his own battle. Many were of course seriously injured. In <num value="1">one</num> place was seen a lady in hysterics; in another, a beautiful female torn from her protector, entreating mercy from the overwhelming throng; in a <num value="3">third</num> place, were parents who had lost their children, and again, children who had lost their parents. It was in this state of things, the approach of the emperor of Russia and his suite was announced. That crowd which had before almost reached the acme of alarm and apprehension, had now new evils to endure. The horse-guards being constrained to obtain a passage for the approaching cavalcade, many were the severe contusions which the shins and toes of the populace received from their horses' hoofs; when, in order to avoid this, many were obliged to take refuge under the carriages, and there, in trembling anxiety, await the moment of their liberation. 
<p>An aquatic excursion being planned for Monday, the <datestruct VALUE="-06-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, by <num value="7">seven</num> in the morning, the admiralty, navy, and ordnance barges, were collected at Whitehall-stairs, gaily dressed with <pb id="p.197" n="197"> banners, and a band of music in <num value="1">one</num> of them. The admiralty barge hoisted the royal standard; others, the Russian and Prussian flags. A gun being fired at <num value="9">nine</num>, the regent was escorted by a party of horse-guards to Whitehall-stairs: and the emperor of Russia, the king of Prussia, and the grand duchess, by detachments of the blues. As soon as the illustrious visitors got on board, the band struck up  <QUOTE> God save the king,</QUOTE>  and the fleet moved off, gliding gently down, greeted with the acclamations of the thousands assembled on the wharfs and shores. Off London-bridge, the city barges, with the lord mayor, aldermen, &amp;c.joined the procession. On the arrival of the royal visitors off Woolwich, the Thisbe frigate, bearing the flag of vice-admiral Legge, and other vessels, fired a salute, and manned their yards. The party then proceeded to the arsenal and laboratory; and, in addition to a discharge of great guns, a quantity of Congreve's rockets were discharged. In the evening, about <num value="8">eight</num>, the whole party dined at the marquis of Stafford's, Cleveland-row, St. James's. 
<p>On Tuesday the <num value="14">14th</num>, the royal party left London for Oxford, where they were received with all possible distinction. Here, with his characteristic activity, Alexander, after looking at his apartments at Merton-college, and the gardens behind it, was walking in the public streets before <num value="3">three</num> o'clock, accompanied by several noblemen, with whom he made a tour to the most distinguished colleges and public edifices. 
<p>Early next morning, the royal party returned to London; the emperor, before he went to bed, attended a ball at lady Jersey's. At <num value="11">eleven</num>, he repaired to St. Paul's cathedral, where he witnessed the annual assemblage of the charity children, belonging to the different parishes of the metropolis. His Prussian majesty and his <num value="2">two</num> sons were also present; and the august party were every where greeted, both in going and returning, with cheers and acclamations. 
<p>In the evening, after dining with lord Castlereagh, the <num value="2">two</num> sovereigns visited Drury-lane theatre; and, when the play was over, went to the marchioness of Hertford's. At <num value="11">eleven</num>, on Friday the <num value="17">17th</num>, they set out to visit the military asylum, commonly called the duke of York's school. The emperor afterwards accompanied his sister to see Greenwich Hospital and the Royal Observatory. 
<p>On the evening of the same day, the allied sovereigns did the Merchant-taylors' company the honour of dining at their hall in Threadneedle-street. Almost the whole of the afternoon, every avenue to the place was thronged, so that a regiment of the London militia, under sir John Eamer, could scarcely keep the ground. Before <num value="3">three</num> o'clock, nearly <num value="100">one hundred</num> ladies of rank and distinction had assembled at the house of Mr. Teasdale, the clerk, who had fitted up a kind of platform in the court-yard, to enable them to see the great visitors as they passed. The appointed dinner-hour was <num value="6">six</num>; but, <pb id="p.198" n="198"> from the multiplicity of previous engagements, it was after <num value="8">eight</num> o'clock before a part of the royal carriages drove to the door. As usual, they were received with loud acclamations; and the military presented arms, while the band played  <QUOTE>God save the king.</QUOTE>  In about a quarter of an hour, a buz was heard, and then the shout of the people: this was a sufficient announcement of the approach of the remainder of the guests, as, in less than a minute after, <num value="4">four</num> more carriages, filled with them and their suite, dashed up the street with the utmost rapidity. Other halls having contributed to the shew of plate exhibited on this occasion, it must have given the royal strangers high ideas of the opulence of the citizens of London. The dinner consisted of the most exquisite viands: being ended, the duke of York gave the <num value="1">first</num> toast,  <QUOTE>the king;</QUOTE>  this was followed by great applause, and the visitors seemed much amused at the hearty manner in which the English receive their toasts.  <QUOTE> The emperor of Russia</QUOTE>  was the next toast, at which he rose and bowed; his sister, the duchess, rose and acknowledged the compliment at the same time.  <QUOTE>The king of Prussia</QUOTE>  was next given; and the company hailed it with equal congratulations. He bowed in return.  <QUOTE>The prince regent</QUOTE>  and the <QUOTE>emperor of Austria</QUOTE> then followed.  <QUOTE>Lord Castlereagh, and thanks to him for his exertions in concluding a safe and honourable peace,</QUOTE>  was the next. His lordship, then, in a short speech, ascribed the chief merit of the peace to the valour of the allies, and begged to propose as a toast,  <QUOTE>the allied sovereigns, and their brave generals.</QUOTE>   <QUOTE> The duchess of Oldenburgh</QUOTE>  followed, and about <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock, the illustrious visitants withdrew, and after leaving Merchant-taylors' hall, paid a visit to Covent-garden theatre. 
<p>A court of common council was held on the <datestruct VALUE="-06-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, to vote addresses to the emperor of Russia and the king of Prussia, and subsequently to invite them and the prince regent to a sumptuous entertainment in the Guildhall, which was graciously accepted; and, on the <num value="18">18th</num>, a banquet was given by the corporation that must have equally surprised and delighted the noble visitants.

<p>In consequence of the grand duchess of Oldenberg and several Russian ladies of distinction having been included in the list sent by order of the emperor of Russia, it was thought proper that the lady mayoress should be present, to receive the grand duchess and the other Russian ladies; and her ladyship was accordingly present, as also the countess of Liverpool, the viscountess Castlereagh, and Miss Elizabeth Domville, sister of the lady mayoress, who were invited on the occasion.

<p>The lord mayor and sheriffs, in state carriages, with the aldermen and city officers, had previously arrived at Temple bar; and, until the approach of the procession, they were accommodated in the house of Messrs. Child and Co. bankers. On its arrival they mounted horses, which were decorated for the occasion with crimson ribbons. The <num value="1">first</num> part of the cavalcade having entered the city; on the carriage of his royal highness the prince regent drawing up, the lord mayor, aldermen, sheriffs, &amp;c. advanced; and the lord mayor presented the sword of state to his royal highness, who was graciously pleased to return the same to his lordship. They then joined the procession, immediately preceding his royal highness's carriage, in the following order: 
<p>Sheriff's Officers. 
<p>The City Marshals. 
<p>The Lord Mayor's Footmen. 
<p>The Band of the London Militia, playing  <QUOTE>God save the King.</QUOTE>  
<p>The City Officers. 
<p><num value="16">Sixteen</num> Aldermen, in their Robes, bare-headed. 
<p>The Common Crier bearing the City Mace, and the 
<p>Sword Bearer wearing the Cap of Maintenance, 
<p>The Lord Mayor, bare-headed, carrying the Sword of State, and dressed in a rich Crimson Velvet Robe, trimmed with Ermine. 
<p>In this order the procession moved on to Guildhall, cheered as they went, by the spectators in the houses and streets. 
<p>In order to insure the convenient and safe conveyance of the company, the whole carriage way from Temple bar was spread over with bright gravel; and to prevent any interruption, the ends of the several streets and carriage ways leading thereto, were, by order of the court of lord mayor and aldermen, secured with posts and bars: a measure which not only enabled the <pb id="p.205" n="205"> illustrious visitors to pass with ease and security, but afforded to the public a most gratifying, because uninterrupted, view of this grand and imposing spectacle. 
<p>Your committee, also, with a view to prevent the possibility of interruption to the line of procession, directed the admission of the ladies into the galleries to take place between the hours of <num value="12">twelve</num> and <num value="3">three</num>, through a passage made for that purpose, from the principal entrance of the hall, to the comptroller's house. By these means, and the attendance of some of the members of your committee, not only to receive the ladies, but to conduct them to the galleries, they were all seated, and their carriages drawn off, long previous to the arrival of the royal and illustrious guests. 
<p>A temporary passage was erected from the principal entrance of the hall to the middle of Guildhall-yard, in order that the carriages might readily pass from thence through Blackwell-hall. This passage, lined with green cloth, and the flooring covered with matting, was illuminated by a profusion of lamps, and led to the porch of the hall, which was also lined with green cloth, and converted into a temporary arbour, in which were displayed the most costly exotics, with flowering and aromatic shrubs, fancifully arranged, and ornamented with moss. This arbour extended into the hall, and being illuminated with variegated lamps, had a most beautiful and pleasing effect. 
<p>The grand gothic hall, with its <num value="2">two</num> superbly painted windows, suggested to the architect the appropriate decorations of the interior, and within the short space of time allowed, an effect was produced, highly creditable to his taste and exertions. The simplicity of the design, the magnitude of the parts, and, above all, the harmony of the colour, diffused a lustre over the whole, upon which the eye reposed with the most satisfied delight; the combination had an unity, a character of strength, and a breadth and tone, the most attractive. The painted windows were externally illuminated, so as to throw into the hall the rich and warm influence of the immense body of light, by which all the Gothic divisions of the <num value="2">two</num> windows were articulated, and which, striking on the brilliant circle of ladies in the galleries, produced an effect as enchanting as novel. 
<p>The walls of the hall to the underside of the capitals of the clustered columns, and the fronts of the galleries, were covered with bright crimson cloth, elegantly and boldly fluted throughout, and so formed and festooned as to represent grand arcades; in the recesses of which were placed tables, illuminated with cut glass chandeliers; reflected by handsome mirrors at the back, giving to the whole a most finished appearance. Above the range of galleries, were suspended large superb cut-glass chandeliers, and over the great cornice, and resting thereon, was a beautiful cordon of uncoloured lamps, by which the entire length of the <pb id="p.206" n="206"> hall, on each side, was illuminated; and the royal banner, and the banners of the city, with those of the <num value="12">twelve</num> principal companies, were displayed underneath. The galleries terminating by circular ends at the monuments of the late earl of Chatham and Mr. Pitt, those monuments were left open to view and the most magnificent cut glass chandeliers that could be procured were suspended from the roof over the royal table, and down the cent tre of the hall; and a great number of gold and silver candelabra with wax lights were most tastefully disposed on every table. 
<p>In order to increase the effect of the illuminations, the windows in the upper part of the hall, above the great cornice, were darkened; and some of them were made to open, that full and complete ventilation might be obtained, which was most amply afforded as occasion required, by men stationed on the roofs for the purpose; and means were adopted for an abundant supply of water to various parts of the hall. 
<p>The committee having been under the necessity of directing the music gallery from the Irish chamber to be removed, forthe more convenient accommodation of the ladies, and that the line of the fronts of their galleries might not lose its effect, by being broken or interrupted; other galleries were erected for <num value="2">two</num> full military bands over the entrance leading to the council chamber, and above the ladies' galleries. This was effected by removing the great clock, and had this advantage, that from the height of the bands, the effect was more imposing; and the ladies' gallery on this side of the hall corresponded with the opposite, and was not interfered with by the arrangements, as the access to the music galleries was obtained from the roof. 
<p>Orchestras for the vocal performers were erected at the upper end of the hall, under the ladies' galleries, which, projecting in a small degree beyond them, rather relieved than interrupted the uniformity of the fronts of the galleries. 
<p>Immediately adjoining these orchestras, at the circular returns of the galleries, fronting the royal table, were affixed white satin banners, with the arms of England, Russia, and Prussia united: these banners your committee have since directed to be suspended in the Guildhall, to convey to posterity the circumstance of this glorious union of great nations. At the upper or eastern end of the Hall, on a platform elevated above the level of the floor, covered with Turkey carpeting, was placed a very large table, at which stood <num value="3">three</num> massive carved and gilt chairs covered with crimson velvet, decorated with gold fringes, under a lofty canopy of rich crimson velvet, lined with crimson sarsnet, and rich velvet draperies reaching to the floor, tied back with gold ropes. In front of the dome of the canopy were placed the sword and sceptre; and on the top the royal crown of the united kingdom, boldly carved on a large scale, and gilt; over which hovered a dove with the olive branch in <pb id="p.207" n="207"> proper colours as in the act of alighting, in allusion to the leading happy circumstance of the times, and in compliment to the <num value="3">three</num> great personages,--the whole producing an effect of simple grandeur, consistent with the object of this magnificent entertainment. 
<p>The members of the common council, in their mazarine gowns, arranged themselves in <num value="2">two</num> lines across the <hi rend=italics>hall</hi>, and from thence to the common council and new council chambers, which were richly fitted up as drawing rooms for the occasion; and the whole of the floor, from the entrance into the great hall to these rooms, was covered with crimson carpeting. 
<p>The court of King's Bench was also fitted up as a drawing-room, the end of which was filled with a beautiful transparent painting, by the late James Barry, R.A. In the centre opening, between <num value="2">two</num> naval and military trophies, was a portrait of his most gracious majesty, in stained and painted glass; on the right and left, whole length figures, representing Britannia and Fame; in the frieze of the entablature, the words <foreign lang=la>Gloria, Deo</foreign>, and over the whole, the figure of Peace descending upon the terrestrial globe. 
<p>The royal procession began to arrive at Guildhall about <num value="5">five</num> o'clock. The lord mayor and aldermen, having dismounted, preceded his royal highness, the prince regent, the lord mayor carrying the sword of state immediately before him. On the entrance of the royal and illustrious personages, they were severally announced and conducted through the hall, attended by the aldermen, the chairman and gentlemen of the committee, to the common council and new council chambers, between the lines formed by the members of the corporation, and with shouts of welcome and appropriate music: our own princes of the blood royal with the national air of  <QUOTE>God save the king,</QUOTE>  and the illustrious warriors with the air of  <QUOTE>See the conquering hero comes.</QUOTE>  The other great personages, princes, ambassadors, marshals, ministers, peers, judges, &amp;c.. &amp;c. continued to arrive in quick succession, and were all received with the most cordial shouts of applause. 
<p>The prince regent and the <num value="2">two</num> sovereigns being received in the common council chamber by the lord mayor, were conducted to the state chairs placed at the upper end. The lady mayoress received the grand duchess and those ladies who were to dine in the hall, as they entered the room. When the prince regent <hi rend=italics>was</hi>
 seated, the lord mayor, having laid aside his crimson velvet robes, and put on his embroidered state or entertaining gown, advanced with the aldermen and Mr. recorder, who addressed his royal highness as follows: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>May your royal highness be pleased to accept our heartfelt thanks for the honour conferred by this royal visit; and to receive the sincere welcome of his majesty's most faithful and loyal citizens, into the ancient metropolis of these realms. <pb id="p.208" n="208"> 
<p>The gracious condescension of your royal highness, and of the high and illustrious sovereigns, your visitors, in receiving at our hands such entertainments as the time has permitted us to provide, makes this a proud and glorious day for the city. It is an unparallelled honour, which will sit close and dear for ever to our hearts. 
<p>Britons, sir, boast, that their energies were cheerfully combined with your royal highness's wisdom and perseverance, to inspirit the continental powers to force Europe into peace, and that they gave effect to the arms and valour of the mighty potentates, whose auspicious presence we this day hail. After England's example, the glorious victories achieved by them put the finishing stroke to the dreadful scourge of war; and the world, blessed by a long reign of peace, will transmit your united names with thanksgiving, with honour, and with glory, to ages yet unborn. 
<p>Permit me, sir, in the name of the corporation of London, thus highly distinguished, to entreat of your royal highness, and of your royal and illustrious visitors, that whatever you shall find of defect in preparing things worthy of your reception, may be imputed not to neglect, not to insensibility; for the heart that would not be overcome by such gracious condescension, or would forbear to exert its every power humbly to acknowledge it, could not inhabit, as we believe, an English bosom: our heads alone, and our means must be in fault, our loyalty and love can never fail.</QUOTE>
 
<p>His royal highness was pleased to make a most gracious reply; and then addressed himself to the lord mayor to the following effect: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>It has always been the custom, when the sovereign paid a visit to his faithful city of London, to confer a mark of favour on its chief magistrate. At no period could this be more properly done, than on an occasion so advantageous to the country as the present, when the long desired return of peace, which was the sole object of all our efforts, has been so gloriously achieved by the valour of his majesty's arms, in conjunction with those of his illustrious allies nor could it be conferred on a person more truly worthy of it, by every public and private virtue than your lordship; and I have great satisfaction in having the power to confer a signal mark of the royal favour upon you.</QUOTE>
 
<p>His royal highness was then graciously pleased to order letters patent to be prepared, for granting the dignity of a baronet to the lord mayor, who kissed hands on the occasion. 
<p>At <num value="7">seven</num> o'clock dinner was announced, and the royal and illustrious company passed from the drawing rooms into the hall in regular state procession, the bands of their royal highnesses the prince regent and the duke of York, in the music galleries, playing national and appropriate airs. The city officers, the <pb id="p.209" n="209"> aldermen, and the lord mayor carrying the state sword, preceded his royal highness, the prince regent, who, with the emperor and grand duchess, the king of Prussia, and the princes of his family, followed by the distinguished guests, walked round the hall, turning as they entered to the right, and going round the tables at the west end, proceeded to the east, by which means, the ladies in the galleries, all standing, and waving their handkerchiefs, were gratified with a full view of the illustrious visitors. The royal party then ascended the steps leading to the elevated platform, on which the royal table was placed, and there seated themselves. This table, being <num value="12">twelve</num> feet wide, was most sumptuous in its display of gold plate ; its richness, indeed, was unparalleled; magnificent ornaments in candelabra, epergnes, tureens, ewers, cups, dishes, glaciers, &amp;c. being selected for the purpose; and the great body of light thereon, produced a most striking and brilliant effect. In the front of the royal table were placed on the floors, and upon the stages, a profusion of the most rare and costly aromatic and decorative shrubs, which entirely lined the space from the steps to the table. 
<p>The gentlemen pensioners and yeomen of the guard were stationed on the elevated platform, and on the steps leading threreto, in regular order, and at proper distances. The royal party were seated in the following order: 
<p><hi rend=italics>Under the Canopy</hi>.-The prince regent, with the emperor of Russia on his right hand and the king of Prussia on his left. 
<p><hi rend=italics>To the right of the Canopy.</hi> The duke of York, prince Henry of Prussia, the duke of Cambridge, the duke of Orleans, the duke of Saxe Weimer, prince Augustus of Prussia, the duke of Oldenburg, count de Merveldt, prince of Hardenberg, count Fernan Nunez, duke of Montellano. 
<p><hi rend=italics>To the left of the Canopy</hi>.-The grand duchess of Oldenburg, the hereditary prince of Wirtemberg the countess of Lieven, the duke of Kent, the prince of Bavaria, prince Metternich, the prince de Cobourg, the duke of Glocester, the prince William of Prussia, the prince of Orange, princess Volkonske. 
<p>This table was so formed, that all the royal party had a full view of the company in the hall. The lord mayor stood behind the chair of the prince regent, with the marquis of Winchester, lord Boston, and other state attendants of his royal highness, and continued there, until graciously desired by his royal highness to take his seat; when he retired to the right hand of the central table, immediately below the royal table, against the upper end of which the city sword and mace were placed. The lady mayoress sat on the left hand, opposite to the lord mayor; and at the same table were placed the countess of Liverpool, the viscountess Castlereagh, and Miss Elizabeth Domville, the lady mayoress's sister; which table, together with those on <pb id="p.210" n="210"> each side, and the upper parts of the tables westward of the entrance, were appropriated for the remainder of the illustrious guests and aldermen; the aldermen being placed in various parts of the tables, at a short distance from each other, to enable them to see that every proper attention was shown to the visitors, particularly the foreigners. 
<p>The residue of the tables to the westward of the entrance, were appropriated by lot to the members of this court and principal city officers; in consequence of which, each member knew the place allotted to him, and the inconveniences which frequently arise from the want of such arrangement were altogether prevented. 
<p>The dinner was as sumptuous as expence or skill could make it, and wholly served on plate, which the committee were enabled to do, by using the city plate from the Mansion-house, the plate of several distinguished noblemen and gentlemen, and some of the companies of this city, who very handsomely and voluntarily offered the same for the occasion, and by procuring other massive services, sufficient for the purpose. 
<p>Samuel Turner, esq. a West India merchant, and <num value="1">one</num> of the directors of the Bank of England, very handsomely presented a fine turtle for the occasion, which was the only <num value="1">one</num> that could be procured, and was the <num value="1">first</num> imported in the season, and arrived in time to be served at the royal table. 
<p>A large baron of beef, with the royal standard, was placed on a stage at the upper end of the hall, in view of the royal table, attended by the serjeant carvers, and <num value="1">one</num> of the principal cooks, in proper costume. 
<p>After dinner, <foreign lang=la>Non Nobis Domine</foreign>, was finely sung by the vocal performers in the Orchestras, the whole of the company in the hall, and the whole of the company standing. Mr. common crier then advanced, by the directions of the lord mayor, to his station on the elevated platform, in front of the royal table; and, after a flourish of trumpets, from the royal trumpeters stationed at each end of the hall, proposed, in the name of the lord mayor, as the <num value="1">first</num> toast, 
<QUOTE rend=center>THE KING,</QUOTE>
 which was received with reverential silence. 
<p>The succeeding toasts were,  <QUOTE>His royal highness, the prince regent;</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>her majesty, the queen, and the royal family ;</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>his imperial majesty, the emperor of all the Russias;</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>his majesty, the king of Prussia;</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>his imperial majesty, the emperor of Austria;</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>her imperial highness, the grand duchess Catherina, princess of Oldenburg;</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>his most Christian majesty, Louis the Eighteenth, king of France and Navarre;</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>his catholic majesty, Ferdinand the <num value="7">Seventh</num>, king of Spain ;</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>the sovereign prince of the Netherlands;</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>his serene highness, the hereditary prince of Orange.</QUOTE>  <pb id="p.211" n="211"> 
<p>All of which were announced by a previous flourish of trumpets, and were received with shouts of applause. 
<p>The next toast was given by command of his royal highness the prince regent,  <QUOTE>Our brave heroes by sea and land, who have so nobly fought for their country ;</QUOTE>  and was followed by  <QUOTE> the generals of the allied armies and the illustrious foreign heroes, who have contributed so much to the glory of their respective countries.</QUOTE>  The latter of which produced a torrent of applause; and the heroes Barclay de Tolly, Blucher, Platoff, De York, &amp;c. &amp;c. rose and bowed thanks to the company. 
<p>His royal highness the prince regent also commanded the following toast to be given, <QUOTE>The right honourable the lord mayor, and thanks to his lordship and the city of London for their magnificent entertainment.</QUOTE>  
<p>In the course of the evening, various songs and glees, amongst which, were the national songs of  <QUOTE>God save the king,</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>Rule Britannia,</QUOTE>  and  <QUOTE>Britons strike home,</QUOTE>  and that admirable glee  <QUOTE>Hail Star of Brunswick,</QUOTE>  were sung with fine effect from the orchestras, by the vocal performers, who were selected from the most eminent in their profession; and, on their singing the stanza of  <QUOTE> Blest isle, with matchless beauty crowned,</QUOTE>  in the song of  <QUOTE>Rule Britannia,</QUOTE>  the appearance of the ladies in the galleries, struck as by electricity every heart in the hall. A burst of acclamation was the consequence. 
<p>His royal highness the prince regent happily seized the opportunity, and proposed as a toast  <QUOTE> The lady mayoress and the ladies in the hall,</QUOTE>  which was received with enthusiasm. 
<p>About <num value="10">ten</num> o'clock, his royal highness the prince regent, with the emperor of Russia and the king of Prussia, rose from the table, and were conducted to the common council chamber, by the lord mayor as before; his lordship immediately preceding the prince regent with the sword of state; and his royal highness was pleased, when about to take his departure, to address himself to Mr. recorder as follows : 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>My reception has given me great pleasure; every thing that has been done, merits my entire approbation; indeed, I must command you to express to the corporation, the high gratification I have experienced this day.</QUOTE>
 
<p>About <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock, the prince regent, and the other royal and illustrious personages, were accompanied by the lord mayor and aldermen to their respective carriages, and returned in state to St. James's palace, before <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock. All the knights marshalmen and attendants, except the coachmen and postillions, bearing large flambeaux in their hands, added to the grandeur of the procession, and produced a novel and most brilliant effect. 
<p>After his royal highness the prince regent had retired, the ladies <pb id="p.212" n="212"> were admitted from the galleries into the hall, provision having been previously made for that purpose, by the erection of a staircase of communication at the west end. 
<p><hi rend=italics>In addition to</hi> the <hi rend=italics>entertainment in</hi> the <hi rend=italics>hall, dinners were provided</hi>
 by order of your committee, at the New London tavern, for the general of the district, and the field-officers of the regiments and corps on duty, and the heralds and officers of arms; at the Guildhall coffee-house, for the lord chancellor's and judges' suites, and the officers of the lord mayor's household; likewise for the vocal performers and the royal military bands, previous to their attendance in the hall, Provisions were also made in the various taverns and inns in the neighbourhood, for the band of gentlemen pensioners, the yeomen of the guard, and other persons in attendance upon the royal personages, as well as for their horses and carriages; and the great room in Cateaton-street, belonging to the late Paul's Head tavern, was appropriated to the livery servants, where they were furnished with every proper refreshment. 
<p>The principal attendants upon the company in the hall were not hired waiters, but composed of citizens and other gentlemen of respectability, dressed alike, in black with white waistcoats, who gratuitously offered their services upon the occasion, and not only acted as waiters, but superintended and took care of the great quantity of plate that was used, the value of which was estimated to exceed <measure value="200000l." type=currency><num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> pounds</measure>; and to whom, we, your committee, have to express our acknowledgements for the able assistance they afforded, which greatly contributed to the order and regularity that prevailed throughout the day. 
<p>The magnificence and splendour of the entertainment on this glorious occasion having greatly excited the public curiosity to view the decorations and fittings up of the hall; the numerous applications for that purpose induced your committee, as far as they consistently could, to comply with their wishes. They therefore directed that the plate and ornaments should remain on the various tables, and every convenient facility of ingress and egress<NOTE>The public were admitted through Mr. Comptroller's house, in the front of the hall, into the galleries, and went out at the back of the hall into Basinghall-street, by the means of temporary stairs erected at each of the upper ends of the galleries those on the north side leading to the passage by the office of works, and those on the south side to the passage by the hall-keeper's house.</NOTE> through the galleries to be afforded; by which means, thousands of persons, (many of whom were of high distinction and great respectability,) were gratified with a view of the magnificent decorations, during the <num value="3">three</num> days your committee were enabled to continue the accommodation, without materially interrupting public business. 
<p>The committee appointed to conduct this magnificent entertainment, made a report as to the expences, to the court of common council, on the <datestruct VALUE="1817-03-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>; which was ordered to be <pb id="p.213" n="213"> printed, and a copy thereof to be sent to every member of the court. From this official document, the following extracts are taken: from which it appears <QUOTE>the expences of altering and fitting--up the Guildhall, together with the entertainment to his royal highness the prince regent, amounted to the sum of <measure value="20038l. 7s. 10d." type=Currency><num value="20038">twenty thousand and thirty-eight</num> pounds <num value="7">seven</num> shillings and <num value="10">ten</num>-pence</measure>, independent of the sum of <measure value="38l. 17s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="38">three hundred and eight</num> pounds <num value="17">seventeen</num> shillings and <num value="4">four</num>-pence</measure> paid in pursuance of sundry orders of the court of aldermen for bills and expences incurred in placing bars, &amp;c. at the end of streets to prevent interruptions to the processions; for providing a crimson velvet robe for sir William Domville, bart. (the then lord mayor); and for decorations, &amp;c. for horses; which being added to the aforementioned sum, makes the whole expence for that entertainment <measure value="20347l. 5s. 2d." type=Currency><num value="20347">twenty thousand three hundred and forty seven</num> pounds <num value="5">five</num> shillings and <num value="2">two</num>-pence</measure>.</QUOTE>

<p>The time between this and Wednesday, <datestruct VALUE="-06-22"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=22>22</day></datestruct>, the day appointed for the departure of the sovereigns, was occupied by excursions, and some entertainments of less importance; <num value="1">one</num> of these was on Sunday the <num value="19">19th</num>, to see the Quaker's meeting in Peter's court, St. Martin's lane; and another to the duchess of York at Oatland; and a <num value="3">third</num> to Chiswick to see the duke of Devonshire. 
<p>Monday, <datestruct VALUE="-06-20"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=20>20</day></datestruct>, was, however, a day of no small importance: a review of troops in Hyde Park was uncommonly splendid, and better attended than any other had been for a number of years. This day was also chosen for the formal proclamation of peace between Great Britain and France; but a poorer procession was never witnessed. This being an event long anticipated, all its importance was worn off, and therefore it was the less surprising that not a single sound of joy, vocal or instrumental, was heard on this occasion. As no persons of any eminence attended this ceremony, it was not till <num value="4">four</num> in the afternoon that the heralds and the military left St. James's; and it was <num value="6">six</num> before they reached the Royal Exchange. Even the lord mayor was kept waiting at Temple-bar for several hours. The princess Charlotte of Wales, the only person of distinction that condescended to look at the procession, viewed it as a private person from the window of Mr. Child, the banker, near Temple-bar. Under an idea of the magnificence of this spectacle, however, a number of persons paid considerable sums for window room; and many others, who had been standing in the streets several hours, were completely disappointed. 
<p>On the evening the peace was proclaimed, both the sovereigns, with the prince regent, attended White's fete at Burlington house, Piccadilly, where, about <num value="2">two</num> in the morning, nearly <num value="2500">2500</num> persons sat down to a dinner. On the same evening, the king of Prussia and his <num value="2">two</num> sons had been a short time in the house of lords; and the emperor and his sister were likewise in the gallery of the house of commons.

<p>On Tuesday morning, <datestruct VALUE="-06-21"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=21>21</day></datestruct>, a deputation from the Quakers waited upon the emperor of Russia at the Pulteney hotel, and presented him an address, with some books. This day the king of Prussia visited the India house and the company's warehouses. About <num value="8">eight</num> on Wednesday morning, when the emperor rose to prepare for his <pb id="p.219" n="219"> departure from town, people were no longer admitted into the hotel as spectators; and all the visitors were in the prince regent's carriage by <num value="9">nine</num> o'clock: as they were entering, a woman presented the emperor of Russia with a book; another offered him a fine rose, which he presented to his sister. The carriage then drove off to the Tower of London; and, lastly, to Turner's patent rope manufactory at Limehouse. About <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock they passed over London bridge on their way to Portsmouth, where having been entertained with a grand naval review in the presence of the duke of Wellington and the prince regent, they left Portsmouth to visit the duke of Norfolk at Arundel castle: from thence to the prince's pavilion at Brighton; and afterwards continuing their journey to Dover, they embarked for the continent. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-07-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct> a splendid entertainment was given by the corporation to the duke of Wellington in the Guildhall; the duke of York, several of his royal brothers, and numerous distinguished officers having accepted the invitation, on their arrival they were severally conducted by the members of the common council through the hall, the military bands of music in the galleries playing the national air of  <QUOTE> God save the King,</QUOTE>  to the common council room, which was fitted up as a drawing-room, where they were received by the lord mayor. And on the arrival of his grace the duke of Wellington at the porch of the Guildhall, he was received by the chairman and members of the committee, and, preceded by them, entered the hall, where he was greeted by long and loud shouts of applause, the ladies in the galleries waving their handkerchiefs, and the bands striking up,  <QUOTE> See the conquering Hero comes.</QUOTE>  From thence his grace was conducted through the passage, formed by the members of the court of common council in their mazarine gowns, to the common council-room, and presented to the lord mayor at the upper end, who immediately rose, and, in the name of the corporation, welcomed his grace to the entertainment. His lordship then, taking his seat, and having several of the distinguished characters who had been invited, and the aldermen, standing on both sides of him, and the members of the court of common council forming themselves into a body in front, Mr. Chamberlain advanced, and having administered the usual oaths of a freeman, admitted his grace the duke of Wellington in the freedom of the city of London, in the accustomed manner, with the sign of fraternity, and giving joy: and, on presenting the sword and gold box to his grace, addressed him in the following words: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Although the subjects of these resolutions are confined to the events which have recently taken place in Europe, the citizens of London can never forget the many signal victories obtained by your grace in those regions which have been dignified by the triumphs of an Alexander, an Aurengzebe, and a Clive. By the exertions of your grace the British empire in India has been placed in a state <pb id="p.220" n="220"> of security which promises felicity to millions in that country, and an extension of commerce to Great Britain. 
<p>To enumerate the brilliant actions of your grace in Europe, would require more time than the present occasion will permit, and would trespass too much upon your grace's delicacy; but it is a truth, which I cannot refrain from declaring, that, during the war in Spain and Portugal, which terminated in the complete emancipation of those kingdoms, a more illustrious instance is not recorded in history of the caution of Fabius most happily combined with the celerity of Caesar ; and when your grace had planted the British standard in the heart of the enemy's country, you gave a great example to the world of the practicability of that lesson which the great Roman poet taught his countrymen, 
<QUOTE rend=center><foreign lang=la>Parcere subjectis, et debellare superbos.</foreign></QUOTE>
 
<p>I am conscious, my lord, how inadequately I express the sense of my fellow citizens of your grace's merits ; but they will recollect, that where I have failed, no <num value="1">one</num> has succeeded. The most eloquent in the British senate, and the <num value="1">first</num> authorities in the <num value="2">two</num> houses of parliament, have confessed themselves unequal to the task; but ample justice will be done to your grace by the world at large, who will frequently and attentively peruse with admiration and delight those inimitable dispatches, which, like the commentataries of Caesar, will hand down with honour the name of their illustrious author to the latest posterity. 
<p>Your grace has been a chosen instrument in the hands of Providence during war.-May you long enjoy in peace the love of your country, and the admiration of mankind: and in the discharge of that honourable office to which his royal highness the prince regent has recently appointed you, may you cement and perpetuate union and good--will between Great Britain and France, so essential to the peace and happiness of Europe!</QUOTE>
 
<p>His grace the duke of Wellington then, bowing to the lord mayor and chamberlain, took from his side his own sword, and giving it to <num value="1">one</num> of his aides-de-camp, put on the sword which had been presented to him, and expressing his high sense of the honour conferred upon him by the corporation of London, attributed, under Divine Providence, the success of all his enterprizes to the ability with which he was supported by his brother officers, and to the valour and discipline of the allies. His grace then declared his readiness to employ the sword he had just received in the service of his sovereign and his country, should it unfortunately happen, that the general wish of the nation and of Europe for a permanent peace should be disappointed. 
<p>The members of the common council then retired; soon after which, dinner being announced, a procession was formed from the common council-room into the hall, in the following order: <pb id="p.221" n="221"> 
<p>Trumpeters. 
<p><num value="2">Two</num> City Marshals. 
<p>The Committee, with wands. 
<p>Officers of the Lord Mayor's Household.

<p>The Members of the Court of Common Council. 
<p>On entering the hall the procession turned to the right, and, going round the tables at the west end, the ladies in the galleries had an opportunity of seeing the illustrious hero, and the other distinguished characters accompanying him. The procession was received with reiterated shouts of applause; and the band the whole time played,  <QUOTE> See the conquering Hero comes!</QUOTE>  then, proceeding to the eastern end of the hall, the company took their seats at their respective tables. The city officers returning to the table under the gallery on the right hand of the entrance into the hall, and next to the platform at the upper end; the members of the court of common council to the several tables appropriated to them by lot; and the officers of the lord mayor's household to the Guildhall coffee-house, where a dinner was provided for them, as also for the suites of the lord chancellor and the judges. 
<p>At the principal table, at the upper end of the hall, the party were seated in the following order:

 <pb id="p.222" n="222"> 
<p>The ministers of state, nobility, particular friends of the duke of Wellington, aldermen, and distinguished parties invited, taking their seats as had been appropriated for them at the tables on the platform. 
<p>The dinner was as sumptuous as possible, and consisted of <num value="2">two</num> distinct courses, the principal table being served on plate. 
<p>After dinner,  <QUOTE> <foreign lang=la>Non nobis Domine,</foreign></QUOTE>  was sung by the vocal performers in the orchestra; and, after a flourish of trumpets, the right honourable the lord mayor proposed as the <num value="1">first</num> toast, 
<QUOTE rend=center>THE KING ;</QUOTE>
 which was received with reverential silence. 
<p>The succeeding toasts were severally announced by a toast-master, stationed at the back of his lordship, after a flourish of trumpets, and were received with the loudest applause. 
<p>His lordship, in proposing the health of the illustrious hero field marshal the duke of Wellington, addressed him, nearly in the following words: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>The highly gratifying visit of his royal highness the prince regent to this festive hall, accompanied by mighty sovereigns and renowned warriors of foreign nations, is still fresh in our recollections. Many, perhaps all of us, regretted the British hero was not seen amidst the laurelled conquerors upon that memorable occasion. The regret was natural, but perhaps unseasonable; for who can doubt but the invincible commander of our own brave armies deserved a civic triumph to himself. It would be ingratitude not to celebrate distinctly the splendid victories achieved by our own brave illustrious general, which accelerated the restoration of peace. Victories not bestowed by the capricious favour of fortune, but won by noble perseverance, through adverse circumstances, and by hard-contested struggles with rival generals of consummate skill, and veteran troops of acknowledged valour; and though every tribute of praise is due to the native bravery of our own soldiers, of what avail would it have proved, if it had not been directed, and raised even to enthusiasm, by the military genius, the personal valour, and the indefatigable vigilance of their great commander. His grace will allow me, in the name of my fellow citizens, to assure him, it is not in his presence that we praise him most; and that in the entertainment given to him this day, they do not pretend to do more than testify their gratitude for services rendered to his country, which, in their estimation, not any honour from the people can more than adequately reward.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Which was received with continued cheerings and plaudits. 
<p>And his grace, in reply, totally disclaimed any particular merits attaching to himself; but attributed it, under Divine Providence, to the perseverance of the nation, the wisdom of his majesty's councils, the care and attention of his royal highness the commander in chief, and the brave co-operating exertions of his fellows in arms, so many of whom he felt highly gratified in seeing <pb id="p.223" n="223"> surrounding him upon this occasion; and, above all, he had the honour of commanding an army of Englishmen, who lost not an atom of the spirit of their country, and behaved as Englishmen should do. 
<p>After dinner, in the course of the evening, the temporary staircase was opened from the galleries, in like manner as at the entertainment to his royal highness the prince regent, and the ladies descended and mixed with the company in the body of the hall. 
<p>Soon after, the lord mayor rose, and, with his grace the duke of Wellington, the royal dukes, the aldermen, and others of the company, retired to the common council room, where refreshments of tea and coffee were provided for them; and which refreshments were also provided for the remainder of the company in other rooms of the Guildhall. 
<p>At half past <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock his grace the duke of Wellington departed, having been conducted to his carriage by the members of the committee; and shortly afterwards the royal dukes, and the principal part of the company took their leave.<NOTE>From  <QUOTE>the account</QUOTE>  published  <QUOTE>by order of and for the corporation,</QUOTE>  <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>.</NOTE>
 
<p>The grand fete, which had long been preparing for the celebration of the peace, was fixed for the <datestruct VALUE="-08-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, and an official programme was issued, in which the public were informed that a beautiful Chinese bridge had been thrown over the canal, upon the centre of which had been constructed an elegant and lofty pagoda, consisting of <num value="7">seven</num> pyramidal stories. <QUOTE><p>The pagoda to be illuminated with gas lights; and brilliant fire-works both fixed and missile, to be displayed from every division of the lofty Chinese structure. Copious and splendid girandoles of rockets to be occasionally displayed from the summit, and from other parts of this towering edifice, so covered with jerbs, Roman candles, and pots de brin, as to become in appearance <num value="1">one</num> column of brilliant fire. Various smaller temples and columns on the bridge to be vividly illuminated; and fixed fire-works of different devices on the balustrade of the bridge to contribute to heighten the general effect. 
<p>The canal in St. James's park to be well provided with handsomely decorated boats at the disposal of those who wish to add to this amusement, to the numerous pleasures of the entertainment. The whole margin of the lawn to be surrounded with booths for refreshment, open marquees with seats, &amp;c. The malls to be illuminated with Chinese lanterns. Bands of music at various distances and spaces for dancing; the whole forming a Vauxhall, on the most magnificent scale. A full view of the royal booth in the Green Park, and of the grand fire-works there displayed from a fortress or castle, the ramparts being a <num value="100">hundred</num> feet square, surmounted by a round tower in the centre, about <num value="60">sixty</num> feet in diameter, and rising about <num value="50">fifty</num> feet above the ramparts. 
<p>To secure every <num value="1">one</num> a complete view this edifice was made to <pb id="p.224" n="224"> revolve on its centre, so that each side would be successively presented to the company. The castle thus exhibiting the appearance of a grand military fortification, was intended allegorically to represent war; and the discharges of artillery, small arms, maroons, &amp;c. may be regarded as descriptive of the terrors of a siege. On a sudden this was to cease, and the lofty fortress, the emblem of war, be transformed into a beautiful temple, the type of a glorious peace. The lower and quadrangular compartment of the temple is embellished with doric columns of porphyry, and the circular edifice which surrounds it with the lighter Ionic columns, are of Sienne marble. The whole beautifully illuminated, &amp;c. 
<p>In point of variety and extent the amusements in Hyde-park will exceed all others, including the <foreign lang=la>Naumachia</foreign>, in which will be shewn the celebrated manoeuvre practised by the immortal Nelson at Trafalgar, of advancing in <num value="2">two</num> lines to break the enemy's line drawn up in the form of a crescent, and the destruction of the fleet by fire ships in the evening; independent of large flights of girandoles, or rockets, consisting of some thousands in a flight, in Kensington-gardens; while the moon being at the full will add splendour and cheerfulness to the scene, and insure universal decorum and good manners.</QUOTE>
 
<p>On the arrival of the <datestruct VALUE="-08-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, all the parks were filled with curious spectators; the lawn in front of Buckingham-house was enclosed for the purpose of filling and sending up a balloon, which about <num value="5">five</num> o'clock ascended with Mr. Sadler, who safely arrived on Macking marshes, Essex. About <num value="10">ten</num> o'clock the pagoda and bridge were brilliantly illuminated, and made a very beautiful appearance, unfortunately it soon after caught fire, by which <num value="2">two</num> persons were severely hurt, and died soon after. The fire works in the Green park were of the most splendid kind, and the temple of concord, with its allegorical paintings, had an elegant appearance. In Hyde park was a fair and the <foreign lang=la>Naumachia</foreign>, or sea-fight, on the Serpentine, with fire works on the water. No disturbance of any consequence occurred, and the metropolis soon regained its usual appearance of business, though the fair was not suppressed till the <datestruct VALUE="-08-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>. 
<p>THE session of parliament was opened on the <datestruct VALUE="-11-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, by a speech from the prince regent, of which the leading topics were the pending negotiations at Ghent, and the intended congress at Vienna. Adverting to the supplies for the ensuing year, his royal highness regretted the necessity of so large an expenditure, and concluded by recommending that parliament should proceed with due caution in the adoption of such regulations as might be necessary for extending the trade of Great Britain, and securing her commercial advantages. The usual address was carried without a division. 
<p>The last and most important event of the year was the conclusion of the American war, the plenipotentiaries assembled at Ghent, and a treaty of peace and amity was signed on the <datestruct VALUE="-12-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, which was afterwards ratified by both governments. The treaty, <pb id="p.225" n="225"> which was negotiated on the part of America by Messrs. Adams, Bayard, Clay, Russel, and Gallatin, and of Great Britain by lord Gambier, and Messrs. Goulburn, and Adams, was silent on the grand cause of the war and primary object of dispute--the right of search; but, as America abandoned her claim of compensation for the captures made under the British orders in council, and omitted all mention of her original pretensions, her resistance to the maritime claims of England must be considered as tacitly abandoned. All conquests, on either side, were to be restored, Britain retaining the islands in Passamaquoddy bay, which were hers by the treaty of <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>. Under this article the Americans had only the defenceless shore of the Detroit, on the frontier of the <num value="2">two</num> provinces, to offering exchange for their fortress of Niagara and the important post of Michilimackinac, both of which were still in possession of the British. The Indians were to be restored to their rights and possessions which they held in <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>; it was reciprocally agreed that commissioners should be appointed for settling disputes respecting boundaries; and both parties engaged to continue their efforts for the entire abolition of the slave trade. 
<p>The interval between the actual conclusion of the treaty, and the circulation of that important intelligence, enabled the English navy to obtain another triumph. The President, <num value="1">one</num> of the largest frigates yet sent to sea by the United States, commanded by captain Decatur, accompanied by the Macedonian, armed brig, laden with provisions, sailed from New York during <num value="1">one</num> of those gales in which the blockading squadron was driven out to sea. After a long chase the Endymion, captain Hope, came up with the former, when a severe action ensued in which the President, having crippled her adversary in the rigging, was enabled to get a-head. The British frigate Pomona now coming up, the President surrendered, after exchanging a few broadsides. The mutual advantages of a free interchange of commercial communication between <num value="2">two</num> countries, whose interest it is at all times to cherish the relations of peace, were resumed shortly after this event; and in both was the termination of the war hailed with unfeigned satisfaction. 
<p>On <datestruct VALUE="1815-05-23"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=23>23</day>, <year reg=1815>1815</year></datestruct>, the <num value="1">first</num> stone of the Southwark bridge was laid by admiral lord viscount Keith, K.B. attended by sir J. Jackson, bart. M. P. chairman, and the rest of the committee of management. The company afterwards repaired to the temporary bridge erected on the works, and partook of a cold collation. 
<p>At this period a long litigated question as to the rental upon which the Mansion-house ought to be assessed for the poor's rate between the city and the parish of St. Mary Woolnoth, was terminated in favour of the latter. Serjeant Runnington, who was appointed arbitrator, having awarded that all the rates were fair <pb id="p.226" n="226"> and equal, and that the Mansion-house should continue to be rated and assessed upon a rental of <measure value="1500l." type=currency><num value="1500">1,500</num>l.</measure> per annum.<NOTE><BIBL>Gents.

<p>The foundation stone of the college of the London Institution in Moorfields, was laid by the lord mayor, in the presence of the aldermen, sheriffs, lord Carrington, president of the institution, and a very numerous body of the proprietors, on the <datestruct VALUE="-11-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="11">Nov.</month></datestruct> in this year. An address was delivered by Mr. Butler, the standing counsel of the establishment, on the return of the company to the City of London tavern, where a sumptuous entertainment was served up. 
<p>On <datestruct VALUE="-11-23"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=23>23</day></datestruct>, Mr. Planta arrived from Paris with the definitive treaty of peace. The event was communicated by earl Bathurst to the lord mayor; and the government offices and the public buildings, were splendidly illuminated on the evening of the <num value="28">28th</num>. 
<p><datestruct VALUE="1816-01-18"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=18>18</day>, <year reg=1816>1816</year></datestruct>, was the day appointed for a general thanksgiving, the <num value="2">two</num> eagles taken at Waterloo was solemnly deposited in Whitehall chapel in the presence of the duke of York, a great number of military officers, and a large assemblage of ladies and gentlemen. The <num value="3">three</num> regiments of foot guards were inspected by the commander-in-chief, accompanied by the dukes of Kent and Gloucester. 
<p>Parliament re-assembled on the <datestruct VALUE="1816-02-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, when the state of the corn laws occupied the attention of the house of commons. On the <num value="17">17th</num>, <num value="9">nine</num> resolutions were moved in a committee, which, after allowing the free warehousing of grain for re-exportation, or to be taken for home consumption when the price should permit, fixed the average at <measure value="80s." type=currency><num value="80">eighty</num> shillings</measure> per quarter for wheat, and proportionally for corn; that is to say, when British corn should not be below that price, foreign might be admitted duty free. A bill framed on the resolutions was introduced on the <datestruct VALUE="-03-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, and, after encountering a strong opposition in both houses from the manufacturing and commercial interest, was passed on the <num value="20">20th</num> by the lords. The apprehension of dearth, as the immediate consequence of this law, occasioned several riots in various parts of the country, which were not quelled without military aid. 
<p>In the metropolis, on <datestruct VALUE="-03-6"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=6>6</day></datestruct>, various persons assembled in the neighbourhood of the house of commons, and as the members <pb id="p.227" n="227"> appeared, either cheered or hooted them, as they supported or opposed the corn-bill. Several members were stopped, and ultimately the civil power being found insufficient to repress the riot, the horse-guards were called, and succeeded in clearing the street; the populace in the evening broke the windows of lord Eldon's house in Bedford-square, Mr. Robinson's in Burlington-street, and forced the doors and destroyed part of the furniture of lord Darnley's in Berkeley-square, and Mr. Yorke's in Bruton-street; they also attacked and destroyed several other mansions. On the next day they attacked the house of lord Castlereagh in St. James's-square, and the house of Mr. Robinson a <num value="2">second</num> time, from the parlour window of which shots were fired, which proved fatal to <num value="2">two</num> innocent persons; the cavalry appearing, the rioters desisted and retired, to vent their fury by damaging the mansions of lord Bathurst, lord King, Mr. Meuxs', &amp;c. The riots continued more or less to the latter end of the week. 
<p>Among the several petitions to parliament, that of the city of London to the house of commons, presented an extraordinary number of signatures, <num value="40571">40,571</num> persons having signed within <num value="10">ten</num> hours. 
<p>A message from the prince regent to both houses of parliament, on the <datestruct VALUE="-03-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, announced the marriage contract of his daughter, the princess Charlotte Augusta, with his serene highness the prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg; and, on the motion of the chancellor of the exchequer, an annual sum of <measure value="60000l." type=currency><num value="60000">60,000</num>l.</measure> was voted to the illustrious pair during their joint lives; of which <measure value="10000l." type=currency><num value="10000">10,000</num>l.</measure> was to form a sort of privy purse for her royal highness- If the prince should die <num value="1">first</num>, the whole sum was to be continued to her royal highness; if he should be the survivor, the sum of <measure value="50000l." type=currency><num value="50000">50,000</num>l.</measure> was to be continued to him; the sum of <measure value="6000l." type=currency><num value="6000">60,00</num>l.</measure> was also granted by way of outfit. 
<p>On <datestruct VALUE="-05-2"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=2>2</day></datestruct>, the ceremony was solemnized by the archbishop of Canterbury in the presence of the queen, the prince regent, the dukes of York, Clarence, and Kent, the princesses Augusta, Sophia, Elizabeth, and Mary, and other branches of the royal family; after the ceremony, the bride and bridegroom left town for Oatlands, the seat of the duke of York. Immediately after the conclusion of the ceremony, the Park and Tower guns were fired, and the evening concluded with other public demonstrations of joy throughout the metropolis. 
<p>The distress of the lower classes throughout the kingdom was excessive towards the latter end of this year. Numerous meetings were holden to consider the means of alleviating the general distress, and large subscriptions were raised; but at several of the assemblies ostensibly convened for the most benevolent purposes, persons of seditious principles came forward to inflame the minds of the people, by asserting that the abolition of places and pensions, and a reform in parliament, would prove a remedy for every evil. Of the meetings of this nature, those which were <pb id="p.228" n="228"> holden in Spa-fields, near London, are the most remarkable. On the <datestruct VALUE="-11-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct> many <num value="1000">thousand</num> artizans and others, assembled for the alleged purpose of petitioning for relief under their distress, were addressed by a person named Hunt in a long and violent harangue, and it was determined that a petition to the prince regent should be presented by him, accompanied by sir Francis Burdett; but the latter did not choose to appear in the business, and Mr. Hunt was informed that it could only be presented at a levee, or through the medium of the home secretary. On the <datestruct VALUE="-12-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct> another meeting was convened to receive the answer to the petition, when an alarming breach of the peace took place. A young man, named Watson, after uttering an inflammatory harangue, seized a flag from <num value="1">one</num> of the bystanders, and, heading a party of the populace, led them into the city, and attempted to plunder the shop of a gun-smith on Snowhill. He fired a pistol at a gentleman, named Platt, who was remonstrating with him, and for this offence was apprehended, but in the confusion that ensued he escaped; and the riot, which might have produced incalculable mischief, was checked by the spirited conduct of the magistrates, and entirely quelled by the appearance of a military force. During this disturbance, the principal part of the assemblage remained in Spa-fields, where another petition was determined upon, and another meeting appointed. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1817-01-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>, parliament was opened by the prince regent in person, when the chief topics of the speech were, the continued assurances of amity received from foreign powers; the splendid success of the bombardment of Algiers, with the consequent renunciation of the practice of Christian slavery ; and the successful termination of the campaign in India. The annual estimates had been formed under an anxious desire to make every reduction in the public establishments which the safety of the empire and true policy would allow; but his royal highness regretted to state that there had been a deficiency in the produce of the last year's revenue; he trusted, however, that it was to be ascribed to temporary causes; and he had the consolation to believe that it would be found practicable to provide for the service without making any additions to the burdens of the people. 
<p>The riotous spirit which had lately displayed itself again broke out on this occasion; and the prince regent, on his way to the house, was assailed by tumultuous expressions of disapprobation from an unusually large concourse of people, whose conduct, on the return of the procession, became more violent, the royal carriage being attacked with stones and other missiles in an alarming manner. This outrage was communicated to the house of peers by lord Sidmouth, when the consideration of the usual address in answer to the speech was postponed till the following day, and a conference was held with the house of commons, at <pb id="p.229" n="229"> which a joint address, congratulating his royal highness on his escape, was agreed upon. A proclamation was issued, offering a reward of <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">one thousand</num> pounds</measure> for the apprehension of the offenders, but they were never discovered. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-01-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct> the master and wardens of the company of ironmongers presented lord Exmouth and sir D. Milne to the chamberlain in his outer office at Guildhall, as freemen of that company in the presence of the lord mayor and several naval and military officers, who served under his lordship at Algiers; when the chamberlain having perused the certificates from the company administered the usual oaths; and agreeably to resolutions of the court of common council admitted them into the freedom of the city of London; after which he presented to each a superb sword. 
<p>About this period a new silver coinage was issued from the Mint to the amount of <measure value="1125630l." type=currency><num value="1125630">1,125,630</num>l.</measure> in half-crowns; <measure value="2455566l." type=currency><num value="2455566">2,455,566</num>l.</measure> in shillings; and <measure value="657162l." type=currency><num value="657162">657,162</num>l.</measure> in sixpences. 
<p>The report of the secret committee of the house of lords was presented on the <datestruct VALUE="-02-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, and commenced by stating that the committee found that there was no doubt that treasonable conspiracies had been formed in the metropolis and elsewhere, which had for their object the total overthrow of the laws and government, and the indiscriminate plunder and division of property. That in August last, different meetings had been held in the metropolis, arms were purchased, and other measures of the like kind resorted to. At subsequent consultations it was resolved to call a public meeting in Spa-fields, which was fixed for the <datestruct VALUE="-11-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>. The conspirators had prepared addresses, and circulated them in gaols, informing the prisoners they would shortly be liberated, when they would be armed by the provisional government. They were also desired to prepare themselves with tri-coloured cockades, emblematic of the approaching revolution. Plans were also formed for an attack upon the Tower, pikes were manufactured to arm the people, leaders were appointed to conduct the assaults in different districts, and fire-arms were distributed amongst those who were considered most worthy of confidence. While these arrangements were forming, the leaders of the conspiracy were found, night after night, in public houses, working up the minds of the people whom they might meet there, so as to render them ready instruments to execute any project, however desperate. Exertions were also made to win over the soldiers to their cause. Tri-coloured flags were prepared, together with a banner, on which was inscribed,  <QUOTE> The brave soldiers are our friends-treat them kindly ;</QUOTE>  and it appeared that, down to the <num value="2">2</num>d of December, they had the fullest confidence of success. Communications regularly took place between the conspirators in the metropolis, and persons actuated by similar feelings in other parts of the <pb id="p.230" n="230"> country; and matters were so regulated as that their efforts should be devoted to the same purpose in different quarters at <num value="1">one</num> time: for which end it was agreed that they should all hold meetings on the same day, and thereby effect a general rising at once; and this was to be done under the pretence that they were to petition the prince regent, the real object being to promote a spirit of insubordination; a contempt of all laws, whether religious or otherwise, an equal division of all property, and a restoration to what was termed natural rights. The next point upon which the report touched, was the existence of societies in different parts of the kingdom, under the titles of Hampden clubs, Spencean philanthropists, &amp;c. the intent of which was, under the disguise of constitutional proceedings, to extend the plans of devastation and destruction already described. A reference was then had to the administration of secret oaths, and to the extraordinary measures which were taken by the conspirators to prevent a discovery of their plots-plots which were found to have existence in all the great manufacturing towns throughout the country, Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham, &amp;c. The last topic alluded to was the publication of inflammatory and seditious works at a cheap rate, the object of which was to root out all feelings of religion and morality, and to excite hatred and contempt for the existing state of things. The committee, in fine, attributed the late attack upon the prince regent to the effect produced by those publications; and expressed it as their decided opinion, that the civil power, as at present constituted, under all the circumstances stated, was insufficient for the preservation of the public peace. On the following evening a report similar in object and effect, was presented from the committee of the house of commons. 
<p>In consequence of the circumstances developed by the secret committee of parliament, <num value="4">four</num> persons, of the names of Watson, Preston, Hooper, and Keene, were apprehended, and committed to the Tower on a charge of high treason. A reward of <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">five hundred</num> pounds</measure> was also offered for the apprehension of a person of the name of Thistlewood; and a further reward of <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">five hundred</num> pounds</measure> for the junior Watson. The metropolis, indeed, as well as several other parts of the kingdom, was for some time in a state of great alarm. 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> parliamentary consequence of the reports of the secret committees was a motion by lord Sidmouth, in the upper house, for the suspension of the <foreign lang=la>habeas corpus</foreign> act, until the <datestruct VALUE="-07-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, then next ensuing. A bill to this effect was passed, and ordered to the commons, where it went through its different stages with rapidity; and, on the <datestruct VALUE="-03-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, received the royal assent. In the lords, a protest against the measure was signed by eighteen peers, on the ground that the existing laws were adequate to the danger. Lord Castlereagh gave notice of farther measures for <pb id="p.231" n="231"> the protection of the country against the machinations of the disaffected. These were, <num value="1">first</num>, the extending of the act of <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>, for the security of his majesty's person, to that of the prince regent; secondly, the embodying into <num value="1">one</num> act the provisions of the act of <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>, relative to tumultuous meetings and debating societies, and the provisions of the act of the <num value="39">39th</num> of the king, which declared the illegality of all societies bound together by secret oaths, and of such as extended themselves by fraternized branches over the kingdom; and lastly, the making of enactments to punish with the utmost rigour any attempt to gain over soldiers or sailors to act with any association or set of men, or to withdraw them from their allegiance. Numerous petitions against these proposed restrictions on public liberty, particularly against the suspension of the <foreign lang=la>habeas corpus</foreign> act, were presented to parliament; and in the respective houses they were opposed, in every stage of their rapid progress, by such members as usually stood forward to advocate the privileges of the people: they, however, finally received the sanction of the legislature. 
<p>On <datestruct VALUE="-06-18"><month reg="06">June</month> the <day reg=18>18th</day></datestruct>, being the anniversary of the battle of Waterloo, the magnificent bridge, which crosses the Thames from the Strand, was opened with a grand procession; his royal highness, the prince regent, the dukes of York and Wellington, in the uniform of field marshals, followed by a concourse of nobility and gentry, repaired in state barges from Whitehall to the Surrey side of the bridge, which they ascended, and crossing the bridge, descended the Middlesex side, and returned to Whitehall. On the arrival of the prince regent, <num value="102">102</num> guns were fired; being the number of cannons taken at Waterloo. 
<p>In the month of June, the senior Watson was, with Thistlewood and some others, put upon his trial, on a charge of high treason, in the court of King's Bench; but chiefly from the discredit thrown on the testimony of the principal witness, named Castles, an accomplice or spy, and a man of base character, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. 
<p>On <datestruct VALUE="-07-1"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=1>1st</day></datestruct>, a proclamation was issued, announcing the delivery of a new gold coinage, called  <QUOTE> sovereigns,</QUOTE>  of the value of <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure>; the amount issued was <num value="32240251">3,224,0251</num>. in sovereigns, and <num value="10572951">1,057,2951</num>. in half-sovereigns; total <measure value="4261320l." type=currency><num value="4261320">4,261,320</num>l.</measure> 
<p>The latter part of the year <datestruct value="1817"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct> was marked by an event that filled the nation with mourning. The princess Charlotte of Wales, whose nuptials had, in the preceding year, afforded so much satisfaction to the country, was in a situation likely to afford an eventual heir to the British throne. Seldom, perhaps, had the hopes and wishes of a whole people been so deeply interested on a similar occasion. At <num value="9">nine</num> o'clock, however, on the night of the <datestruct VALUE="-11-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, her royal highness was delivered of a still-born male child; and at half-past <num value="2">two</num>, on the morning of the <num value="6">6th</num>, she expired, to the inexpressible grief of the royal family; and <pb id="p.232" n="232"> throughout the metropolis, and the country in general, the indications of sorrow were unusually general and sincere. 
<p>In consequence of the queen's declining health, <num value="2">two</num> amendments had been made in the regency bill, during the last session of parliament; the <num value="1">first</num>, empowering her majesty to add <num value="6">six</num> new members, resident at Windsor, to her council, in the event of her absence from the palace; and the <num value="2">second</num> repealing the clause which rendered necessary the immediate assembling of a new parliament in the event of the queen's death. These amendments were very opportunely made; as, after a lingering illness of <num value="6">six</num> months, which was sustained with great fortitude and resignation, her majesty expired at Kew palace, on the <datestruct VALUE="-11-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, in the <num value="75">75th</num> year of her age. She had been blest by nature with a sound and vigorous frame, having, until within <num value="2">two</num> years of her decease, enjoyed an almost uninterrupted state of health. Her remains were interred in the royal vault at Windsor, on the <datestruct VALUE="-12-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>. 
<p>In the early part of <datestruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></datestruct>, a party which had received the appellation of  <QUOTE>radical reformers,</QUOTE>  obtained much notice by their active exertions among the lower orders, chiefly of the manufacturing classes. <num value="1">One</num> of their <num value="1">first</num> steps was an application to the magistrates of Manchester, to convoke a meeting, for the alleged purpose of petitioning against the corn-bill, which was refused; and, in consequence, the meeting was summoned by an anonymous advertisement. Mr. Hunt, who had been selected as the leader of the day, was conducted to the place of meeting by an immense multitude, in a sort of triumphal procession, and a strong remonstrance to the prince regent was adopted: the assemblage, however, dispersed without tumult. This meeting was followed by many others of a similar nature, at Glasgow, Leeds, Stockport, and other manufacturing neighbourhoods; the strong measures of precaution, however, that were taken by the respective local authorities, had, in most instances, the effect of preserving order and tranquillity, though there was a marked contrast between the peaceable demeanour of the auditors, and the inflammatory character of the language in which they were addressed. On these occasions, the want of a true representation of the people was pronounced to be the grand source of all our evils; for which, annual parliaments, universal suffrage, and election by ballot, were pointed out as the only cure. At <num value="1">one</num> meeting, there was a discussion whether the people had a right to destroy the Bank of England; and some suggestions were thrown out, as to the expediency of a division of landed property, and a recurrence to physical force. By some, however, it was contended that these suggestions, which happily produced no practical results, were made by spies; and it is not improbable, that the agents of government, whose duty could not legitimately extend beyond the <pb id="p.233" n="233"> office of observing, and faithfully reporting the proceedings which took place, might, and there can be no doubt, did, occasionally exceed their instructions. On <datestruct VALUE="-03-24"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=24>24th</day></datestruct>, the Southwark bridge was opened for passengers; there was no ceremony observed on the occasion, but as St. Paul's clock struck <num value="12">twelve</num> the toll of <num value="1">one</num> penny commenced. In Smithfield a meeting took place on the <datestruct VALUE="-07-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>. Some degree of alarm was naturally felt by the inhabitants of the metropolis on this occasion; and, for the purpose of preventing riot or disorder, very extensive and judicious precautions were taken, both by the government and the police. Mr. Hunt was elected to the chair, and a number of strong resolutions were passed, to the effect that, as the persons at present composing the house of commons had not been fairly chosen, the meeting could not consider themselves bound in equity by any of their enactments, after the ensuing January. Towards the conclusion, several police officers arrived, and took a Mr. Harrison, an itinerant preacher, into custody, for using seditious language at a similar meeting, held at Stockport, in Cheshire, a few days before. When the officers seized him, a few voices proposed resistance, on which Mr. Hunt requested them to let him go quietly.  <QUOTE>If they apprehend me,</QUOTE>  said he,  <QUOTE> I am ready with bail, and will try the question with them. Let me subpoena all of you here; and then, though they may get <num value="3">three</num> villains to swear away my life, I shall not be afraid when I have <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> witnesses to contradict them. If only <num value="30">thirty</num> of you should come day by day, the trial will last for <num value="3">three</num> years!</QUOTE>  The remonstrance to the prince regent, which had been agreed to at a meeting in Palace-yard, Westminster, on the <datestruct VALUE="1818-09-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>, was adopted, and numerous speeches followed; in the course of which Mr. Hunt stated, that the penny subscriptions to promote the cause of reform, which had been calculated to create, in a year, a fund of <measure value="256000l." type=currency><num value="256000">two hundred and fifty-six thousand</num> pounds</measure>, amounted, at the expiration of <num value="10">ten</num> months, to only <measure value="4l." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> pounds</measure> <measure value="14s." type=currency><num value="14">fourteen</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence. This enormous assemblage finally separated without tumult. The Manchester reformers, who had posted up notices of a meeting to be holden on the <datestruct VALUE="-08-9"><day reg="9">ninth</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, for the purpose of proceeding to the election of a representative, as at Birmingham, was informed by the magistrates that, as the object of the proposed assemblage was unquestionably illegal, it would not be suffered to take place. In consequence of this determination, they relinquished their design, and issued notices of a meeting, for the avowed legal object of petitioning for a reform in parliament, on the <datestruct VALUE="-08-16"><day reg="16">sixteenth</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>. An open space in the town, called St. Peter's field, was selected as the place of assembly; and never, upon any former occasion of a similar nature, was so great a number of persons known to be present. Some hours before the proceedings were to commence, large bodies began to march in from <pb id="p.234" n="234"> the neighbouring towns and villages, formed <num value="5">five</num> deep, many of them armed with stout staves, and preserving a military regularity of step. Each body had its own banner, bearing a motto; and, under a white silk flag, <num value="2">two</num> clubs of female reformers appeared. The number collected were estimated at <num value="60000">sixty thousand</num>. A band of special constables, stationed on the ground, disposed themselves so as to form a line of communication from a house where the magistrates were sitting to the stage or waggon fixed for the orators. Soon after the business of the meeting had been opened, a body of yeomanry cavalry entered the ground, and advanced with drawn swords to the stage: their commanding officer called to Mr. Hunt, who was speaking, and told him that he was his prisoner. Mr. Hunt, after enjoining the people to be tranquil, and offering to surrender to any civil officer who should exhibit his warrant, was taken into custody by a constable, and several other persons were also apprehended. Some of the yeomanry now cried out,  <QUOTE>Have at their flags!</QUOTE>  and they began to strike down the banners which were raised in various parts of the field-when a scene of dreadful confusion arose; numbers were trampled under the feet of men and horses; many persons, even females, were cut down by sabres; some were killed, and the maimed and wounded amounted to between <num value="3">three</num> and <num value="400">four hundred</num>. In a very short time the ground was cleared of its former occupants, and military patroles were stationed in the principal streets of the town to preserve tranquillity. 
<p>Much difference of opinion has ever since prevailed on this subject; and it has been justly observed by a late historian, that the Manchester meeting is <num value="1">one</num> of those events, upon which, in all its variety of details, historians will never be found to agree. Whether the riot act was actually read is still a moot point: the reformers and their friends insist that it was not; the magistrates and their adherents contend that it was. And certainly if it was read, the affirmative of the proposition would have been more easily established than its negative. The whole appears to have taken place within <num value="10">ten</num> minutes, by which time the field was entirely cleared of its recent occupiers, and filled with different corps of infantry and cavalry. Hunt and his colleagues were, after a short examination, conducted to solitary cells, on a charge of high treason. On the following day notices were issued by the magistrates, by which the practice of military training, alleged to have been carried on in secret, by large bodies of men, for treasonable purposes, was declared to be illegal. Public thanks were, by the same authority, returned to the officers and men of the respective corps engaged in the attack; and, on the arrival in London of a despatch from the local authorities, a cabinet council was held, the result of which was the return of official letters of thanks to the magistrates, for their prompt, decisive, and efficient measures for the preservation of the public tranquillity, and to all the <pb id="p.235" n="235"> mili-tary engaged, for the support and assistance afforded by them to the civil power. 
<p>For some days the town of Manchester and its neighbourhood were in a state of constrained quietness, although some further disturbances, in which <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> lives were lost, had taken place. At a meeting held at the Crown and Anchor, in London, a string of resolutions, strongly censuring the conduct of the magistrates and military, and returning thanks to Mr. Hunt and his colleagues, were unanimously adopted; as was also a resolution to raise a subscription for defraying the expences of counsel, &amp;c. in defence of the prisoners. In the same spirit a meeting was likewise holden in Smithfield; and a spirited letter was also addressed to the electors of Westminster by sir Francis Burdett, for the writing of which, as a libel, he was afterwards tried and convicted. In pursuance of this letter, an immense multitude assembled in Palace yard, Westminster, on the <datestruct VALUE="-09-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>, for the purpose of declaring an opinion on the conduct of the magistrates and yeomanry of Manchester. After speeches which occupied <num value="3">three</num> hours in their delivery, by sir Francis Burdett, and Mr. Hobhouse, his colleague in the representation of Westminster, several resolutions were adopted, declaring the assemblage at Manchester a lawful meeting; that the outrage on that occasion was an attempt to destroy by the sword the few remaining liberties of Englishmen, and that it was another lamentable consequence of the want of a real representation; an address to the prince regent, founded thereon, was unanimously agreed to. 
<p>On <datestruct VALUE="-09-9"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=9>9th</day></datestruct>, a court of common council was held at Guildhall to take into consideration the conduct of the magistrates and yeomanry cavalry of Manchester, on the <datestruct VALUE="-08-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>. The court was <num value="1">one</num> of the most crowded ever known. The lord mayor took the chair at <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock, and opened the business by stating that he held the court with great reluctance, because, whenever crimes were alleged to be committed, they ought to be referred to the proper tribunal before whom the necessary evidence would be laid, instead of discussing them elsewhere. Alderman Waithman addressed the court at great length, and urged the necessity of calling for a full inquiry into the atrocities committed, which he considered not only unequalled in our history, but a great public outrage committed on the constitution. He concluded by moving a series of resolutions which were supported by Messrs. Hurcomb, Patten, Crook, Pearsall, and Taylor; and opposed by aldermen sir W. Curtis, and Rothwell, Messrs. Browne, Dickson, and Jackson. Upon the question being put by the common serjeant, the lord mayor declared the resolutions carried by considerable majority. 
<p>The circumstances of the Manchester case turned out to be such, that government found it expedient to abandon the threatened prosecution of Mr. Hunt and his colleagues for high treason, and <pb id="p.236" n="236"> those persons were accordingly informed that they would be proceeded against for a conspiracy only, which might be bailed; but Mr. Hunt refused to give bail, even, as he said, to the amount of a single farthing; some of his friends, however, liberated him. His return from London to Manchester was <num value="1">one</num> long triumphal procession, waited upon by thousands, on horse, on foot, and in carriages, who hailed him with continued shouts of applause. 
<p>On <datestruct VALUE="-09-13"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=13>13</day></datestruct>, Mr. Hunt triumphantly entered the metropolis through Islington, Finsbury-square, Sun-street, Bishopsgate-street, Cheapside, round St. Paul's, Ludgate-hill, Fleet-street, to the Crown and Anchor tavern, Strand, where a dinner was provided at <num value="7">seven</num> o'clock. Mr. Hunt was seated in a landaulet drawn by <num value="6">six</num> horses, decorated with scarlet ribbons, and preceded by a flag, having inscribed on it,  <QUOTE> Hunt, the heroic champion of liberty.</QUOTE>  It was supposed that not less than <num value="200000">200,000</num> persons of either sex accompanied him; after a short speech from Mr. Hunt, the whole dispersed without accident or disorder. 
<p>On <datestruct VALUE="-09-17"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=17>17</day></datestruct>, the corporation presented the address voted in the common hall to the prince regent at Carlton-house, when his royal highness was pleased to return the following answer:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>I receive with feelings of deep regret this address and petition of the lord mayor, aldermen, and commons, of the city of London in common council assembled. 
<p>At a time when ill-designing and turbulent men are actively engaged in influencing the minds of their fellow subjects, and endeavouring by means the most daring and insidious, to alienate them from their allegiance to his majesty and the established constitution of the realm, it is on the vigilance and conduct of the magistrates that the preservation of the public tranquillity must depend; and a firm, faithful, and active discharge of their duty, cannot but give them the strongest claim to the support and approbation of their sovereign and their country. 
<p>With the circumstances which preceded the last meeting at Manchester, you must be unacquainted; and of those which attended it, you appear to have been incorrectly informed. 
<p>If, however, the laws were really violated on that occasion, by those to whom it immediately belonged to assist in the execution of them, the tribunals of this country are open to afford redress; but to institute an extra-judicial inquiry, under such circumstances as the present, would be manifestly inconsistent with the clearest principles of public justice.</QUOTE>
 
<p>His royal highness having delivered his answer, the deputation took their leave of the royal presence, and returned in the same order of procession to the city. 
<p>The lord mayor having refused to convene a common hall on the subject of the Manchester meeting, the livery, on <datestruct VALUE="-09-29"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=29>29</day></datestruct>, before commencing the regular business of the election of a chief magistrate, entered into several resolutions, condemning the <pb id="p.237" n="237"> course pursued by the magistrates, and censuring the conduct of the lord mayor. 
<p>Amidst the general ferment which had been produced by these circumstances, the meeting of parliament was impatiently waited by all parties, and it assembled on the <datestruct VALUE="-11-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>.  <QUOTE>I regret to have been under the necessity,</QUOTE>  observed the prince regent in the opening speech,  <QUOTE>of calling you together at this period of the year; but the seditious practices so long prevalent in some of the manufacturing districts of the country, have been continued, with increased activity, since you were last assembled in parliament. They have led to proceedings incompatible with the public tranquillity, and with the peaceful habits of the industrious classes of the community; and a spirit is now fully manifested, utterly hostile to the constitution of this kingdom, and aiming not only at the change of those political institutions which have hitherto constituted the pride and security of this country, but at the subversion of the rights of property and of all order in society. I have given directions that the necessary information on this subject shall be laid before you; and I feel it to be my indispensable duty to press on your immediate attention the consideration of such measures as may be requisite for the counteraction and suppression of a system, which, if not effectually checked, must bring confusion and ruin on the nation.</QUOTE>  
<p>On the succeeding day the promised documents respecting the state of popular feeling were produced: they consisted, in part, of the correspondence of official persons with the home secretary; and, in part, of communications to such persons, made by individuals whose names were withheld. Such of the letters of the Manchester magistrates as had been written previously to the <datestruct VALUE="-08-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct> expressed apprehensions that a formidable insurrection was in contemplation: at the same time they bore testimony to the deep distresses of the manufacturing classes, and assigned hunger as the natural cause of the willingness of the poor to listen to any project for the melioration of those sufferings. 
<p>On the <num value="29">29th</num> of the same month, the lord chancellor introduced a bill, which he said he had long contemplated. It had been the practice of the courts to allow defendants, in cases of informations or indictments, to imparle or traverse. As great inconveniences had arisen from this practice, as trials were sometimes delayed till a very remote period, and as the ends of justice might thus be defeated, the bill would take away from the defendant the right of traversing; allowing the court, however, to postpone his trial, upon his showing ground for the delay. Earl Grey at once entered his protest against the whole of the measures, which, as it appeared, were in preparation, as calculated to bring the greatest misery, if not ruin upon the country. On the <num value="2">second</num> reading, earl Grosvenor contended that, whilst the attorney-general was allowed to hold informations over the heads of <pb id="p.238" n="238"> defendants for an indefinite length of time, to abolish the right of traverse was greatly enhancing the grievance. Lord Erskine also objected to the measure, as depriving the people of an ancient and important privilege. On the other hand, the earl of Liverpool contended, that if their lordships did not pass this bill, they had better at once declare that every description of sedition and blasphemy should be invested with full toleration. Lord Holland urged that, in fairness, the measure ought to be so ordered as to legislate on both sides, by preventing the delays which occurred by prosecutions on <foreign lang=la>ex officio</foreign> informations, as well as by those of indictment; and, agreeably to this suggestion, the lord chancellor, on the <num value="3">third</num> reading, proposed an additional clause, compelling the attorney general to bring a defendant to trial within a year, or to enter a <foreign lang=la>noli prosequi.</foreign> The bill, thus amended, was agreed to without opposition. 
<p>The other bills introduced by administration were to the following effect:--An act to render the publication of a blasphemous or seditious libel-punishable, on a <num value="2">second</num> conviction, at the discretion of the court, by fine, imprisonment, banishment, or transportation; and to give power, in cases of a <num value="2">second</num> conviction, to seize the copies of the libel in possession of the publisher; a stamp duty equal to that paid by newspapers, on all publications of less than a given number of sheets, with an obligation on all publishers of such pieces, to enter into recognizances for the payment of such penalties, as might in future be inflicted on them. 
<p>The liberty of the press being thus restrained, meetings were to be controlled by the following provisions :--That a requisition for the holding of any meeting, other than those regularly called by a sheriff, boroughreeve, or other magistrate, should be signed by <num value="7">seven</num> householders; and that it should be illegal for any persons, not inhabitants of the place in which such meetings was hold, to attend it: also, that magistrates should be empowered, within certain limitations, to appoint the time and place of meeting. To repel danger from the mustering of an illegal force, it was proposed to prohibit military training, except under the authority of a magistrate or lieutenant of a county; and, in the disturbed districts, to magistrates the power of seizing arms believed to be collected for unlawful purposes, and also to apprehend and detain persons so carrying arms. The only <num value="1">one</num> of these bills which passed without opposition was that for the prevention of secret military training. The bill for the seizure of arms, which, under certain circumstances, and in particular districts, authorized search to be made in private houses, by day or night, was strenuously resisted in both houses: and, upon an amendment for omitting the words  <QUOTE>or night</QUOTE>  the house of commons divided-Ayes <num value="46">46</num>; Noes, <num value="148">148</num>. A clause of the blasphemous and seditious libel bill, by which offenders were, upon <pb id="p.239" n="239"> a <num value="2">second</num> conviction, subjected to the punishment of transportation, passed the house of lords, but ministers found it expedient to withdraw it in the commons. The penalty of banishment, however, which had been previously unknown to the English law, was allowed to be enacted. In its progress the seditious meeting bill was subjected to a modification, by which all meetings held in any room or building were exempted from its operation. Several limitations of the bill for subjecting small publications to the newspaper stamp-duty were also introduced. 
<p>The protracted existence of the venerable monarch who had so long swayed the British sceptre was now drawing to a close. In the month of November the hitherto firm health of his majesty underwent a sudden alteration; and, although the dangerous symptoms were for a time removed, a general feebleness and decay ensued, which portended no very distant dissolution. In the midst of the anxiety caused by this change, the public regret was excited by the loss of the duke of Kent, who was seized with an inflammation on the lungs, and expired, after a short illness, on the <datestruct VALUE="1820-01-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> <month reg="01">Jan.</month> <year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>, in the <num value="53">53rd</num> year of his age. In person his royal highness was manly and noble, in stature tall, in manners dignified, yet affable. He was easy of access, temperate in habits, and in the army acquired the reputation of personal courage. In politics he took no very active part, but attached himself to the whig or popular party; and, whenever any charitable object was to be promoted, his name and presence needed little solicitation. He left an infant daughter, named Alexandrina Victoria. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-01-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>, <num value="8">eight</num> days after the death of the duke of Kent, his venerable father expired without a struggle, in the sixtieth year of his reign and the <num value="82">eighty-second</num> of his age. Over the last <num value="9">nine</num> years of his life an awful veil had been drawn. In the periods of the deepest national solicitude his mind had felt no interest; in the hour of the most acute domestic feeling his eye had been tearless; almost the last time that this venerable sovereign appeared in public, was on the day when his people, with <num value="1">one</num> accord, devoted themselves to rejoicing in honour of his completion of the fiftieth year of his reign, a period far beyond the common term of dominion. He was buried in the royal vault at Windsor <datestruct VALUE="-02-16"><month reg="02">Feb.</month> <day reg=16>16th</day></datestruct>. 
<p>In pursuance of established usage, the cabinet ministers assembled on the morning subsequent to the demise of the late king. When his present majesty held his <num value="1">first</num> court at Carlton house, which was numerously and brilliantly attended by all ranks and parties, who eagerly offered their homage to the reigning monarch, the re-appointment of the lord chancellor, and several ministers, was the <num value="1">first</num> exercise of sovereign power, the oaths of allegiance being administered to those present. A council was, in compliance with the royal ordinance, immediately holden; and all his late majesty's privy councillors then in attendance were sworn as members of his <pb id="p.240" n="240"> present majesty's council, and took their seats at the board accordingly. 
<p>The <hi rend=italics>proclamation</hi> of his majesty took place publicly in the metropolis on Monday, <datestruct VALUE="-01-31"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=31>31st</day></datestruct>. To account for this apparent 
<hi rend=italics>delay</hi>, it is only necessary to call to attention, that the late king expired on the Saturday evening, the following morning being Sunday, <datestruct VALUE="-01-30"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=30>30th</day></datestruct>, the anniversary of the martyrdom of Charles I., a solemn fast is appointed by our church, and consequently this pageant would have been inadmissible. 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> proclamation was made on the steps of Carlton palace, in the presence of his majesty, his royal brothers, and the principal officers of state. The procession then formed in the following order, and proceeded to Charing-cross:--

<p>On arriving at Charing-cross, the proclamation was again read, and the procession proceeded to Temple-bar, where the usual formalities of closing the gates, and admitting <num value="1">one</num> of the heralds to shew his authority, having been gone through, the cavalcade entered the city, and were joined by the lord mayor, sheriffs, and several of the aldermen; the proclamation was read at the end of Chancery-lane, at the end of Wood-street, Cheapside, and at the Royal Exchange, when the heralds and the military returned. 
<div1 type=chapter id="c.8" n="8"><pb id="p.241" n="241"> 
<HEAD>Account of the Civil Government of the City by Portreves, Bailiffs, and Mayors, with a list of the latter-Ceremonies to be observed by the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriffs, on particular occasions.</HEAD>
 
<p>No authentic documents are in existence to show what was the nature of the government of London, during the time it was under the dominion of the Romans and Saxons; and as, when it was brought under the Danish yoke, they made no other use of it but as a place of security to fly to, in case of necessity, for shelter and defence; there is, therefore, no probability that a regular government existed during that period. In <num value="886">886</num>, Alfred having dislodged these freebooters, and restored London to its former splendour, committed the government thereof to Ethelred, earl of Mercia, who had married Elfleda, his daughter; but as to the government exercised therein by Ethelred nothing is known, for we have not the least account transmitted to us, whereby we can form an idea of the government of this city, before the Norman conquest, other than a few scraps taken from a charter addressed to the portgrave, and said to be granted by Edward the Confessor to the city of London, whereby all her ancient customs and usages were confirmed; and by an additional grant, every servant or vassal, repairing to London, and residing therein during a year and a day, without being claimed by the lord or master, became in all respects a freeman of this city, as if he had been born and bred therein. 
<p>By this charter it appears, that the chief officer of the city before the Norman conquest, was denominated portreve, or portgrave. Various are the derivations of this epithet, some taking port to signify a town, whereas in truth it means an haven or harbour; and grave, an intendant, governor, or collector, is derived from the Saxon Grau, that is, gray or hoary-head; such were, by the ancient Saxons, for their age and experience, chosen judges, as the Roman senators and aldermen of England were on the same account; but this appellation at last becoming general, it was indifferently applied to a judge, governor, magistrate, warden, keeper, and receiver; as is manifest by the following ancient German titles, viz. margrave, a warden of the marches; landgrave, an itinerant judge; burgrave, a governor, or chief magistrate of a city; and portgrave, a collector, or general receiver of the public duties of a commercial port; such a <num value="1">one</num> was the portgrave of London under the Saxons, who was likewise at the head of the civil government of the city. 
<p>In the survey, commonly called the Domesday-Book, made in <pb id="p.242" n="242"> the <num value="20">twentieth</num> of William the Conqueror, anno <datestruct value="1086"><year reg="1086">1086</year></datestruct>, it appears, that many cities and boroughs in England were held of the Saxon kings, nobility, and clergy, in demesne or vassalage; and whose several properties being cantoned out into sokes and liberties in the said cities and boroughs, at <num value="1">first</num> gave rise to the appellation of ward, to each of the said divisions; this is not only in some measure corroborated by the wards of Baynard's-castle, Coleman-street and Portsoken, but likewise by several wards of London being anciently alienable.<NOTE><BIBL>Maitland, i.-<datestruct value="1192--"><year reg="1192">1192</year></datestruct></BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>In the reign of Henry I. an additional magistrate was added to the government of this city, by the name of provost: but what his office was, is not mentioned, though probably either that of sheriff or bailiff. 
<p>The chief officer of this city under the Saxons (as before mentioned) was the portgrave; but the Normans having by conquest reduced the English, they were in all things forced to submit to the conqueror; wherefore the appellation of portgrave was obliged to make way for the exotic <num value="1">one</num> of mayor; from the French word 
<foreign lang=fr>meire</foreign> (a Latin derivative from <foreign lang=la>major</foreign>) wherewith the chief magistrate of the city of Rouen, the capital of the province of Normandy, was then dignified. 
<p>The earliest mention of the appellation of mayor, is towards the close of the reign of Henry II. 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1213"><year reg="1213">1213</year></datestruct>, the citizens of London obtained the privilege of chosing their own mayor, but with a condition that he should be presented annually to the king, or in his absence to his justices, to be sworn into his office. 
<p>The elections for the mayor and city officers, were at <num value="1">first</num> made tumultuously by all the citizens, without distinction; but this giving rise to great disturbances and commotions in the city, the magistrates were afterwards chosen by a select number out of each ward, and these were called the commonalty. This mode of election by delegates continued from the reign of Edward I. or perhaps earlier, to that of Edward IV., in whose reign the elections were made by the liverymen of the respective companies, which method has continued ever since, and is established by act of parliament. 
<p>The necessary qualifications for the office of lord mayor, are that the nominee shall be free of <num value="1">one</num> of the city companies;<NOTE>It was formerly considered necessary for the lord mayor to be free of <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="12">twelve</num> principal city companies.</NOTE> have served the office of sheriff, and be, at the time of election, an alderman of <num value="1">one</num> of the wards of the city. When a citizen has gone through this gradation of honours, he is presumed to be possessed of wealth and talent enough to fill, with credit to the city and himself, the post of its chief magistrate; and it is only where <pb id="p.243" n="243"> notorious misfortunes have reduced an individual from affluence to poverty, that he ever loses his chance of succession to this highest of civic dignities. 
<p>The election takes place on Michaelmas day, at a court of hustings held in Guildhall, under the presidency of the sheriffs. All the aldermen who have not passed the chair, but have served the office of sheriff, are proposed successively in the order of their seniority, and the livery testify, by a show of hands, the degree of favour in which each is held. The sheriffs make a return to the court of aldermen, of the <num value="2">two</num> members of their body, who have united the greatest number of suffrages; and it remains with that court to determine on which of the <num value="2">two</num> the election has fallen. The candidates are not, however, absolutely bound by the show of hands; for it is open to any of them or their friends to demand a poll, a privilege which has of late years been frequently exercised. 
<p>The lord mayor, though elected by the citizens, must be approved by the king, or as has been invariably the case since Henry III., in the <num value="7">7th</num> of his charters to the city, permitted the alternative by the lord chancellor on his majesty's behalf. Although the crown, however, does possess this power, there is no instance of its having exercised it, since the revolution at least, and it may be now regarded as a matter of formal observance entirely. 
<p>The royal approbation having been obtained, the mayor elect, on the <datestruct VALUE="-11-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, takes the oath of faithful administration, in presence of the citizens assembled in the Guildhall; and next day he is finally installed into office, by the barons of the exchequer at Westminster. 
<p>This day is the carnival of London, but within the last few years it has been sadly curtailed. Of its splendour of the former appearance of the lord mayor's procession, or show, little remains. 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> account of this annual expedition known to have been published, was written by George Peele, for the inauguration of sir Wolstone Dixie, knight, on the <datestruct VALUE="1585-10-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1585">1585</year></datestruct>. On that occasion, as was customary to the times, there were dramatic representations in the procession--of an allegorical character. Children were dressed to personify the city, magnanimity, loyalty, science, the country, and the river Thames. They also represented a soldier, a sailor, and nymphs, with appropriate speeches. The show opened with a moor on the back of a lynx. On sir Thomas Middleton's mayoralty, in <datestruct value="1613--"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct>, the solemnity is described as unparalleled for the cost, art, and magnificence of the shows, pageants, chariots, morning, noon, and night triumphs. In <datestruct value="1655--"><year reg="1655">1655</year></datestruct>, the city pageants, after a discontinuance of about <num value="14">fourteen</num> years, were revived. Edmund Gayton, the author of the description for that year, says, that <QUOTE>our metropolis for these planetary pageants, was as famous and renowned in foreign nations, as for their faith, wealth, and valour.</QUOTE> In the show of <datestruct value="1659--"><year reg="1659">1659</year></datestruct>, an European, an Egyptian, and a Persian, were personated. On lord mayor's day, <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>, <pb id="p.244" n="244"> the king, queen, and duke of York, and most of the nobility being present, there were <QUOTE>sundry shows, shapes, scenes, speeches, and songs in parts;</QUOTE> and the like, in <datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>, and <datestruct value="1673--"><year reg="1673">1673</year></datestruct>, when the king <QUOTE>graced the triumphs.</QUOTE> The king, queen, duke, and duchess of York, prince Rupert, the duke of Monmouth, foreign ambassadors, the chief nobility, and secretary of state, were at the celebration of lord mayor's day, in <datestruct value="1674--"><year reg="1674">1674</year></datestruct>, when there were <QUOTE>emblematical figures, artful pieces of architecture, and rural dancing, with pieces spoken on each pageant.</QUOTE> 
<p>The printed description of these processions are usually entitled <QUOTE>Triumphs,</QUOTE> though they are more commonly called the <QUOTE>London Pageants ;</QUOTE> all of them are scarce, and some of such extreme rarity as to bear a price at the rate of <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="3">three</num> guineas a leaf. The description of sir Patience Ward's show, on the <datestruct VALUE="1680-10-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>, composed by Thomas Jordan, is an interesting specimen of the setting out and pageantry of this procession. The lord mayor being of the livery of the merchant-tailors' company, at <num value="7">seven</num> o'clock in the morning, liverymen of the <num value="1">first</num> rank, appointed to conduct the business of the day, assembled at merchant-tailor's-hall, to meet the masters, wardens, and assistants, in their gowns, faced with foyns (the skin of the martin.) In the <num value="2">second</num> rank, others in gowns faced with budge (lambs'-skin, with the wool dressed outwards,) and livery-hoods. In the <num value="3">third</num> rank, a number of foyn-bachelors, and <num value="40">forty</num> budge-bachelors, both attired in scarlet-hoods and gowns. <num value="60">Sixty</num> gentlemen-ushers, in velvet coats and chains of gold, bearing white staves. <num value="30">Thirty</num> more in plush and buff, bearing colours and banners. <num value="36">Thirty-six</num> of the king's trumpeters, with silver trumpets, headed by the serjeant-trumpeter, he wearing <num value="2">two</num> scarfs, <num value="1">one</num> the lord mayor's, and the other the company's colours. The king's drum-major, followed by <num value="4">four</num> of the king's drums and fifes. <num value="7">Seven</num> other drums and <num value="2">two</num> fifes, wearing vests of buff, with black breeches and waste scarfs. <num value="2">Two</num> city marshals on horseback, with attendants. The foot-marshal, with a rich broad shoulder-scarf, to put them in rank and file, attended by <num value="6">six</num> others. The fence-master, with attendants, bearing bright broadswords drawn. Poor pensioners, with gowns and caps, bearing standards and banners. A troop of poor persons, in azure gowns and caps. <num value="100">One hundred</num> more with javelins and targets, bearing the arms of their benefactors. Being all assembled, they are by the foot-marshal's judgment, arranged into <num value="6">six</num> divisions, ranked out by <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="2">two</num>. The <num value="1">first</num> division contains the ensigns of the company, followed by the poor company of pensioners. <num value="4">Four</num> drums and <num value="1">one</num> fife. Pensioners in coats as before described. Persons of worth, each bearing a standard or banner. <num value="4">Four</num> trumpets. <num value="2">Two</num> merchant-taylors' ensigns, bearing their supporters and crests. <num value="6">Six</num> gentlemen-ushers. The budge-bachelors, marching in measured order. <num value="2">Second</num> division. <num value="6">Six</num> trumpets. <num value="2">Two</num> gentlemen, bearing the coats of arms of the city, and the merchant-tailors' company. <num value="8">Eight</num> gentlemen, <pb id="p.245" n="245"> wearing gold chains. The foyns-bachelors. <num value="3">Third</num> division. <num value="2">Two</num> gentlemen in velvet coats with banners. <num value="10">Ten</num> gentlemen-ushers in coats and chains of gold, as before described. A large body of the livery in their gowns and livery-hoods, followed by <QUOTE>all lord mayors in the potential mood.</QUOTE> In their rear divers of the city trumpets. <num value="2">Two</num> gentlemen bearing the arms of the city and the lord mayor. Gentlemen-ushers. The court of assistants. <num value="4">Four</num> drums. <num value="6">Six</num> trumpets. <num value="3">Three</num> gallants bearing the banners of the diadem. The king's, queen's, and city's ensigns, attended by <num value="6">six</num> gentlemen as pages. The master and wardens of the merchant-taylors' company. Thus formed, they march from merchant-tailors' hall to the lord mayor's house, where his lordship and the aldermen take horse, according to their degree, and the whole body proceed in state to Guildhall. Being met at the gate by the old lord mayor, and there attired with the gown, fur hood, and scarf, and guarded by knights, esquires, and gentlemen, they all march through King-street down to <num value="3">Three</num>-Crane-wharf, where the lord mayor and aldermen, discharging some of the attendants, take barge at the west end of the wharf; the court of assistants' livery, and the rest of the gentlemen-ushers, taking barge at the east-end. The rest of the ushers, with the foyns and the budge-bachelors, remain ashore, with others, to await the return of his lordship, who proceeds with several city companies by water, and is rowed all along by the strand to Westminster; a pleasure boat with great guns on board saluting him all the way. At New Palace stairs they disembark, and making a lane to the hall, the lord mayor passes along to take the oath and go through the usual ceremonies. These being completed, he makes a liberal donation to the poor of Westminster, re-embarks with all his retinue, and being rowed back to Blackfriars stairs, he lands there under beat of drum and a salute of <num value="3">three</num> volleys from the artillery company, in their martial ornaments, some in buff, with head-pieces, many being of massy silver. From Blackfriars they march before the lord mayor and aldermen through Cheapside to Guildhall. The pensioners and banners who went not to Westminster, being set in order to march, the foot-marshal in the rear of the artillery company, leads the way along by the channel up Ludgate-hill, through Ludgate, into St. Paul's churchyard, and so into Cheapside, where his lordship is entertained by the <num value="1">first</num> pageant, consisting of a large stage, with the coat armour of the merchant-tailors' company, eminently erected, consisting of a large tent royal, 
<hi rend=italics>gules</hi>, fringed and richly garnished, <hi rend=italics>or</hi>, lined, faced, and doubled, 
<hi rend=italics>ermine.</hi> This stage is winged or flanked by <num value="2">two</num> other stages, bearing <num value="2">two</num> excellent figures of lively carved camels, the supporters to the company's coat. On the back of <num value="1">one</num> camel, a black native Indian, in a golden robe, a purple mantle fringed with gold, pearl pendants in his ears, coronet of gold with feathers, and golden buskins laced with scarlet ribbons, holds a golden bridle in his left, and a banner of the company, representing Treasure, in his right hand. <pb id="p.246" n="246"> On the other camel, a West Indian, in a robe of silver, scarlet mantle, diamonds pendant from his ears, buskins of silver, laced with purple ribbons, a golden crown feathered, holds a silver bridle in his left, and a banner of the lord mayor representing,  <QUOTE>Traffic,</QUOTE>  in his right hand. On <num value="1">one</num> of the camel stages <num value="4">four</num> figures sit on pedestals, <num value="1">one</num> at each corner, representing  <QUOTE> Diligence,</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>Industry,</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>Ingenuity,</QUOTE>  and  <QUOTE>Success;</QUOTE>  on the other camel-stage, in like manner,  <QUOTE>Mediocrity,</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>Amity,</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>Verity,</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>Variety,</QUOTE>  all richly habited in silk or sarsenet, bear splendid emblems and banners. The royal tent, or imperial pavilion, between these <num value="2">two</num> stages, is supported on <num value="1">one</num> side by a minister of state, representing  <QUOTE>Royalty,</QUOTE>  and on the other side by another representing  <QUOTE>Loyalty;</QUOTE>  each in rich robes of honour <hi rend=italics>gules</hi>, wearing on their left arms shields <hi rend=italics>azure</hi>, with this motto in gold,  <QUOTE> For the king and kingdom,</QUOTE>  <num value="1">one</num> bearing a banner of the king's, and the other <num value="1">one</num> of the city's banners. On a high and eminent seat of throne-like ascension is seated  <QUOTE>Sovereignty,</QUOTE>  in royal posture and alone, with black curled hair, wearing an imperial crown, a robe of purple velvet, lined, faced, and caped with ermine, a collar of SS, with a George pendant; bearing in <num value="1">one</num> hand a golden globe, in the other a royal sceptre. On a seat beneath, are  <QUOTE>Principality,</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>Nobility,</QUOTE>  and  <QUOTE>Honour,</QUOTE>  all richly habited.

On the lowest seat, an  <QUOTE>ancient English hero,</QUOTE>  with brown curling hair, in ancient armour, as worn by chief commanders, the coat of mail richly <hi rend=italics>gilt</hi>, crimson and velvet scarf fringed with gold, a quiver of arrows in a gold belt on <num value="1">one</num> side, a sword at the other, buskins laced with silver and gold, a silver helmet with red and white plume, in <num value="1">one</num> hand a large long bow, and a spear in the other. This personage, representing  <QUOTE> sir John Hawkwood,</QUOTE>  a merchant-tailor of martial renown under Edward III. when he conquered France, as soon as he perceives the lord mayor prepared, with attention riseth up, and with a martial bow exhibiteth a speech in verse of <num value="37">thirty-seven</num> lines, in compliment to the merchant-tailors and the lord mayor. His lordship testifying his approbation, rideth with all his brethren through the throng of spectators, till at Milk-street end, he is intercepted by the <num value="2">second</num> pageant, which is a chariot of ovation, or peaceful triumph, adorned with delightful pieces of curious painting, and drawn by a golden lion and a lamb. On the lion is mounted a young negro prince, richly habited, according to the royal mode in India, holding a golden bridle, and in the other hand St. George's banner, representing  <QUOTE>Power.</QUOTE>  On the lamb is mounted a white beautiful seraphim-like creature, with long bright flaxen <pb id="p.247" n="247"> curled hair, and on it a golden coronet of cherubims, heads and wings, a carnation sarsenet robe, with a silver mantle, and wings of gold, silver, purple, and scarlet, reining the lamb by a silver bridle in his left hand, and with his right bearing an angelical staff, charged with a red cross representing  <QUOTE>Clemency.</QUOTE>  In the chariot sitteth <num value="7">seven</num> persons, <num value="1">1</num>. <foreign lang=la>Concordia</foreign>. <num value="2">2</num>. <foreign lang=la>Unanimia.</foreign> <num value="3">3</num>. <foreign lang=la>Pacifica</foreign>. <num value="4">4</num>. <foreign lang=la>Consentania</foreign>. <num value="5">5</num>. <foreign lang=la>Melodea</foreign>. <num value="6">6</num>. <foreign lang=la>Benevolentia</foreign>, (whose habits, and those of other characters already and hereafter mentioned, are not described here for want of room) and <num value="7">7</num>. <foreign lang=la>Harmonia</foreign>, a lady of great gravity, with masculine aspect, wearing a lovely dark brown peruke, curiously curled, on which is planted a crown imperial; she wears a robe of French green velvet, pleasantly embroidered with gold, a crimson-coloured silk and silver mantle, and sitting majestically alone in front, upon the approach and fixation of my lord mayor, improves the opportunity, riseth up and delivereth an oration. This consists of <num value="44">forty-four</num> lines in verse, wherein she acquaints his lordship that the other characters are her attributes, recommends unity, because division is the policy of the pope and the jesuits, expresses her belief that if the lion and the lamb fall out she should run to ruin, descants upon magistrate-like virtues, and in the end tells his lordship, 
<p>You have done all things fair, no action foul; 
<p>Your sherevalty gave relish of good rule; 
<p>Nor need they doubt your mayoralty, therefore, 
<p>Begging your pardon, I shall say no more. 
<p>This speech being concluded, his lordship exhibiting a gracious aspect of favourable acceptation, advanceth further toward Guildhall, but is civilly obstructed by another scene, and in regard his lordship is a merchant, and his company merchant-tailors, the <num value="3">third</num> triumphal scene, or pageant, is a ship called the  <QUOTE> Patience,</QUOTE>  with masts and sails, fully rigged and manned, the captain whereof addresseth to my lord a speech beginning,-- 
<p>What cheer, my lord? I am return'd from sea, 
<p>To amplifie your day of Jubilee,

His lordship having surveyed the ship, and the trumpets sounding, he continueth his determined course toward Guildhall, but by the way is once more obstructed by another scene, called the  <QUOTE>Palace of Pleasure,</QUOTE>  which is a triumphal ionic arch of excellent structure, where in distinct and perspicuous situations, sitteth <num value="9">nine</num> beautiful and pleasant ladies, whose names, natures, and ornaments are consentaneous.

<p>This song, containing <num value="5">five</num> more verses, being ended, the foot-marshal places the assistants, livery, and the companies on both sides of King-street, and the pensioners with their targets hung on the tops of the javelins; in the rear of them the ensign bearers; drums and fifes in front; he then hastens the foins and budge-batchelors, together with the gentlemen ushers, to Guildhall, where his lordship is again saluted by the artillerymen with <num value="3">three</num> volleys more, which concludes their duty. His land attendants pass through the gallery or lane so made into Guildhall; after which, the company repairs to dinner in the hall, and the several silk-works and triumphs are likewise conveyed into Blackwell hall; and the officers aforesaid, and the children that sit in the pageants, there refresh themselves until his lordship hath dined.

 <P>The present arrangement of the civic pageant is as follows: 
<p>On the morning of the <datestruct VALUE="-11-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, being the day on which the lord mayor elect enters upon his office, the aldermen and sheriffs repair to his residence, from whence they attend him to Guildhall, in a procession formed by coaches, which, about noon, proceed to Blackfriars-bridge, where the lord mayor, aldermen, recorder, and sheriffs, go on board the city barge, attended by several corporations of the citizens, in their formalities, and stately barges, elegantly adorned with a great number and variety of flags and pendants; and thence proceed to Westminster. 
<p>The lord mayor, sheriffs, aldermen, recorder, &amp;c. go in procession to the court of exchequer, where the lord mayor is sworn in, and solemnly addressed by the chief baron. The procession afterwards proceeds to all the other courts, the recorder inviting the judges, &amp;c. to dinner. On returning to their barges the whole of the splendid regatta return to Blackfriars-bridge; here the lord mayor is received by the company to which his lordship belongs; and the procession returns, preceded by several persons on horseback, dressed in polished armour. Next march the lord mayor's officers and servants, followed by his lordship in the city state-coach; and after him come the aldermen, recorder, sheriffs, chamberlain, common-serjeant, town clerk, &amp;c. in their several carriages and splendid equipages; and in this manner they proceed to Guildhall, where an elegant entertainment is provided. The procession being over, the several companies repair to their respective halls, where they are sumptuously entertained. 
<p>The exact time when the title of right honourable was <num value="1">first</num> given to the chief magistrate of this city cannot be ascertained, though it is extremely probable it was conferred by the great patron of London, Edward III. in the year <datestruct value="1354"><year reg="1354">1354</year></datestruct>. At the return of Henry VI. from his being crowned King of France at Paris, Anno <datestruct value="1442"><year reg="1442">1442</year></datestruct>, the mayor was <num value="1">first</num> apparelled in a gown of crimson velvet, a furred cap, with a girdle of gold and a golden chain about his neck; and the aldermen in scarlet gowns and sanguine hoods. 
<p>The wear of robes being established, and the various colours agreed upon, a regulation was published by the court of lord mayor and aldermen, in <datestruct value="1562--"><year reg="1562">1562</year></datestruct>, for fixing the days whereon their several coloured robes should be worn, and a small tract was published by John Day, containing the customs and orders for meeting on particular days, and for wearing the habits. On account of its extreme scarcity and curiosity, it is here introduced.<NOTE>To show how far the customs of the city have varied since the publication <pb n="p.250"> of the above tract, we have appended the modern manner in which the same ceremonies are observed, with others which have been created since that period. Our authority is a pamphlet, entitled <CIT><QUOTE>The names and address of the several officers of the city of London, the dates of their appointments, and an abstract of their respective duties; and also a state of the customs on elections, and other public occasions, prepared by the direction of the court of common council.</QUOTE><BIBL><num value="12">12</num>mo, <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>.</BIBL></CIT></NOTE>
 <pb id="p.250" n="250"> 
<p>Upon Midsummer day, for the election of the sheriffs of London, &amp;c. my lord mayor and the aldermen, with the sheriffs, meet at the Guildhall, at <num value="8">eight</num> o'clock in the morning, apparelled in their violet <hi rend=italics>gowns</hi> lined, and their cloaks of scarlet lined, without their 
<hi rend=italics>horses.</hi>
 
<p>And when they have been together in the council-chamber a certain time, concerning the nomination of certain persons to be elected, my lord and the aldermen come out, and put on their cloaks in the orphans'-court, and then go down in order to the hustings-court; and there being set, Mr. recorder standeth up and maketh his obedience, <num value="1">first</num> to my lord, and then unto the commons, and declareth unto them wherefore they are assembled together, showing unto them that it is for the election of <num value="1">one</num> of the sheriffs of London and the sheriff of Middlesex for the year next ensuing, and the confirmation of the other sheriff nominated by my lord mayor, according to his prerogative, and also for Mr. chamberlain and other officers. Of late years, however, the election is for both sheriffs. 
<p>But my lord and the alderman go up to my lord's court, and there remain until the sheriff be named and chosen, the door shut to them. 
<p>Then the sheriffs, Mr. chamberlain, Mr. common-sergeant, Mr. town-clerk, and the counsellors of the city, and other officers remain still in the hustings-court to take and receive the name of him that shall seem by their judgments freely and with <num value="1">one</num> consent to be nominated and elected, and justly tried out, not only by voice, but also by hands, to be sheriff for the year following. 
<p>Then the commons go to the election of Mr. chamberlain, the <num value="2">two</num> bridgemasters, the auditors of the city and bridge-house accounts, and the surveyors of beer and ale, according to the accustomed manner. 
<p>That done, the sheriffs, master chamberlain, master common serjeant, master town-clerk, the counsellors of the city, the <num value="2">two</num> secondaries, the wardens of the head companies, master common-crier going before them with his mace, carry up the report to my lord and the aldermen of their said election. 
<p>Which report received, my lord and the aldermen come down again to the hustings-court, and there being set in order and placed, master recorder standeth up as he did before, and maketh rehearsal of the names of those whom they have nominated and chosen, asking them whether it be their free election, yea or no?

<p>Though the office of lord mayor is only elective, yet it may in some measure be said to be perpetual; for his authority ceases, neither on the demise, or abdication of the king, as that of all commission officers do. When such circumstance happens, the lord mayor is the principal officer in the kingdom, and takes his place accordingly in the privy council, until the new king is proclaimed ; in proof of which, when James I. was invited to come and take possession of the throne of England, Robert Lee, the then lord mayor, signed the invitation before all the great officers of state and the nobility. His power is very considerable; for he is not only the king's representative in the civil government of the city, but also <num value="1">first</num> commissioner of the lieutenancy, perpetual coroner, and escheator, within the city and liberties of London, and the borough of Southwark, chief justice of Oyer and Terminer and gaol delivery of Newgate, judge of the court of wardmote at the election of an alderman, conservator of the rivers Thames and Medway, perpetual commissioner in all affairs relating to the river Lea, and chief butler of the kingdom at all coronations, his fee being for that service a golden cup and cover with a golden ewer. He also sits every morning at the Mansion-house, to determine any differences that may happen among the citizens, and to do the other business incident to his office of chief magistrate. 
<p>The person of the lord mayor is inviolable, and it is a high crime to assault or resist him. Thus, in the year <datestruct value="1339"><year reg="1339">1339</year></datestruct>, in the mayoralty of Andrew Aubrey, he, with some of his servants, being assaulted in a popular tumult, headed by <num value="2">two</num> persons of the names of Haunsart and Brewere, these <num value="2">two</num> ringleaders were apprehended and tried for that offence, at Guildhall, and, being convicted, were immediately beheaded in Cheapside. 
<p>As by the Norman conquest the appellation of sheriff was obliged to make way for the more modern appellation of bailiff; so was that of portreve to that of provost; this title being soon after converted into that of mayor. <pb id="p.263" n="263"> 
<p>It will be observed, in several instances, that <num value="2">two</num> lord mayors are set down for <num value="1">one</num> year; this circumstance has occurred in consequence of the death of the <num value="1">first</num> elected. In such case, if the event happens in term, the <num value="2">second</num> lord mayor is sworn in as usual by the barons of the Exchequer; but if a vacation, he is sworn in by the constable of the town as his deputy.

<p>When or on what occasion a sword was at <num value="1">first</num> carried before this magistrate, we cannot ascertain. Mr. Maitland considers it was not before the reign of Henry VIII. for Pope Leo the <num value="10">tenth</num>, anno <datestruct value="1513"><year reg="1513">1513</year></datestruct>, presented that prince with a consecrated sword, and a cap of maintenance, the former being an offensive weapon to destroy the enemies of the church, and the latter armour to defend the head. This being the <num value="1">first</num> cap of maintenance we read of in England, it was regarded by Henry as the greatest favour Leo could confer upon him; therefore the king, as an additional honour to the metropolis of his kingdom, might grant the citizens a privilege to use both the sword and cap of maintenance. 
<div1 type=chapter id="c.9" n="9">

<HEAD>An account of the Aldermen and Sheriffs, with a list of the latter.</HEAD>
 
<p>The aldermen of this city are of far more remote antiquity than the mayors; and their office was unquestionably of Saxon institution. The title of <hi rend=italics>ealdermen</hi>, or aldermen, among the ancient Saxons, appears to have been <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest dignity (though it is now no where to be found but in chartered societies;) and was synonimous with the title of  <QUOTE>earl.</QUOTE>  This probably gave rise to the honorable title of barons, whereby the aldermen and commonalty of London were for a long period denominated. 
<p>Whether the city of London at <num value="1">first</num> was divided into wards by king Alfred, (after his rebuilding the same, as already mentioned,) or by arbitrary lords, whose demesnes in the city were held in vassalage by the citizens, or by others, is unknown. However, the latter seems the more probable, from the known fact, that, during the Saxon government, most of the cities and towns in this kingdom were held in demesne or vassalage; which is strongly corroborated by the wards of this city being anciently hereditary, and alienable at the will of the alderman. 
<p>And it is observable, that the wards or aldermanries of this city were denominated from the aldermen, and anciently changed their names as often as their masters; and that the division of the city into wards or aldermanries, appears to be of great antiquity; for it is manifest, that London had both wards and aldermen in the reign of king Richard the <num value="1">First</num>.<NOTE><BIBL>Fitz-Stephen's Description of London.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The abuses which necessarily arose from this proprietary system, <pb id="p.269" n="269"> led to repeated efforts on the part of the citizens to change the tenure of the office; and at length, from <num value="1">one</num> of those coalitions between the crown and the people, which are not uncommon in the history of revolutions, the right of property was, in the reign of Edward II. wrested from the aldermen, and the citizens of each ward were declared to have the power of electing annually the alderman who was to preside over it. So frequent an exercise, however, of the elective privilege, had also its peculiar inconveniences; and in <datestruct value="1394--"><year reg="1394">1394</year></datestruct>, it was ordered by parliament that in future the aldermen should  <QUOTE>continue in office during life or good behaviour.</QUOTE>  
<p>At present it is regulated by an act of parliament passed in the <num value="12">12th</num> Geo. I. and the person so elected is to be returned by the lord mayor (or other returning officer in his stead, duly qualified to hold a court of wardmote) to the lord mayor and aldermen, by whom the person so returned must be admitted and sworn into the office of alderman before he can act. 
<p>It is not necessary that the person elected should be a resident of the ward. Citizens of eminence often become candidates for the aldermanship of wards, with which they have previously had no particular connexion. Should a person decline the office of alderman, (which is, however, rarely the case,) he may be fined; there is even a precedent for imprisonment. 
<p>In elections for aldermen, the right of voting is confined to freemen who are resident householders of the ward paying scot and lot, and an annual rent of not less than <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>l.</measure> a year. 
<p>Each alderman has the active direction or wardenship of the affairs of his ward, under the general superintendance of the lord mayor; and is assisted by <num value="1">one</num> or more deputies, appointed by himself from among the common-councilmen of the ward. Every ward, too, has its court of wardmote, or common-hall, with which the alderman may advise on all matters touching the common welfare. 
<p>The privilege of acting as magistrates in the city was formerly confined to the lord mayor, the recorder, the aldermen who had passed the chair, and the <num value="9">nine</num> senior aldermen below it; but in the year <datestruct value="1741"><year reg="1741">1741</year></datestruct>, George II., by letters patent, empowered all the aldermen of London, without distinction, to act in future as justices of the peace within the city and its liberties. 
<p>It was anciently the custom for the magistrates of the city of London, to have posts painted and ornamented, set up at their doors, on which the royal proclamations were fixed. Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and several others of our old dramatists, notice this practice. These posts were usually newly-painted on entering into office, a custom which is alluded to by the satirical bishop of Salisbury, when in his <title>Microcosmographia</title>, he says of an alderman,  <QUOTE>his discourse, is commonly the annals of his mayoralty, and what good government there was in the days of his gold chain, <pb id="p.270" n="270"> though the door posts were the only things that suffered reformation.</QUOTE>  
<p><hi rend=italics>Prior</hi> to the reformation the city, in imitation of the national parliament, had its spiritual alderman; the prior of the Holy Trinity, without Aldgate, for the time being, having always been the alderman of Portsoken ward. 
<p>The dignity of alderman, like that of the lord mayor, had once more than ordinary protection; and in those turbulent times, when personal feelings and resentment usurped the place of law and justice, it is recorded that a citizen was imprisoned, and his right hand cut off for assaulting an alderman. Resistance to the authority of an alderman was commonly punishable with the loss of freedom, and imprisonment for a year and a day. 
<p>The costume of the aldermen is a cloth gown of violet or scarlet, lined with silk, or furred according to the season. On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, an alderman who neglected to line his cloak according to the established mode, was condemned by his brethren to a summary punishment, amusingly characteristic of the claims of this respectable body to the character which Shakespeare has given of them, as being  <QUOTE>with fat capon lined.</QUOTE>  They decreed that the whole court should go and breakfast with him. 
<p>The office of sheriff, (<hi rend=italics>shire-reve</hi>, or governor of the shire, or county), is an office of great antiquity, trust, and authority. The lord mayor and citizens of London have the shrievalty of London and Middlesex in fee by charter; and the <num value="2">two</num> sheriffs are by the livery annually elected. 
<p>Any person being a freeman of London is eligible to the office; and whoever is elected is bound to serve, unless he can swear that he is not worth <measure value="20000l." type=currency><num value="20000">20,000</num>l.</measure> The penalties for refusal are <measure value="400l." type=currency><num value="400">400</num>l.</measure> to be paid into the city chamber, and <measure value="20bmark" type=currency><num value="20">20</num> marks</measure>, or <num value="131">131</num>. <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> to the ministers of the city prisons. A citizen, after payment of these fines, is exempted for <num value="3">three</num> years, but an alderman only for <num value="1">one</num>: no person, however, after being once drank to by the lord mayor, can be drank to again by any subsequent mayor, unless he becomes an alderman. Whoever serves is obliged to give a bond to the corporation of <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1000</num>l.</measure> 
<p>Although many pay the forfeit rather than serve the office, yet it is sometimes contested for; in which case, the poll is held at Guildhall, and adjourned from day to day, in the same manner as in elections for members of parliament. 
<p>The election of sheriffs takes place annually on Midsummer-day, and they come into office at Michaelmas, When chosen, they are sworn into office at Guildhall, and <num value="2">two</num> days afterwards in the court of exchequer at Westminster-hall. The order of the procession upon this occasion is similar to that on presenting the lord mayor, with the exception of not walking round Westminster-hall, but going immediately to the court of exchequer, and being preceded by <num value="16">sixteen</num> of the court of assistants of each of the companies <pb id="p.271" n="271"> of which the sheriffs are members, who attend in their barges and are landed <num value="1">first</num>; upon entering the court of exchequer, the recorder, sheriffs, and aldermen make <num value="3">three</num> obeisances to the cursitor baron, which he returns, the lord mayor keeping his hat on; Mr. recorder then presents the new sheriffs for his majesty's approbation, the lord mayor and junior sheriff standing at his right hand, and the senior at his left; his majesty's approbation is usually expressed in the following words:  <QUOTE>I approve of the <num value="2">two</num> sheriffs on the part of the crown.</QUOTE>  The recorder then states to the court, that the sheriffs attend to account, and a warrant to this effect is read, and Mr. recorder moves that it may be recorded, which is granted. A <num value="2">second</num> warrant is in like manner read, to record the appearance of the late sheriffs to render their accounts, which upon motion is also recorded; the late sheriffs are then sworn by the cursitor baron to account, and a warrant of attorney is then read of the appointment of the under-sheriffs, who are sworn by the cursitor baron, to account, &amp;c. which upon motion is also recorded; the tenants or occupiers of certain lands are then called, when the junior alderman present cuts a stick with a hatchet at <num value="2">two</num> strokes, which is held by <num value="1">one</num> of the officers of the court; the tenants and occupiers of a house called the forge, are then called, when the officer counts the horse-shoes and nails; being asked how many shoes, answers <num value="6">six</num>; another officer then proclaims, a good number: he is then asked how many nails, and answers <num value="61">sixty-one</num>; the other officer in like manner proclaims, a good number. The business being over, Mr. recorder invites the cursitor baron, in the name of the sheriffs, to dine with them; this ceremony being finished, the procession returns in the same manner as upon presenting the lord mayor.<NOTE><BIBL>Pamphlet before quoted, p <num value="110">110</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The duties of the sheriffs are multifarious; they have to serve the king's writs of process; and, in this, are armed with such authority, that where the king is party, they may break open doors, or untile houses, in order to obtain admittance, if it be denied. It is also the sheriffs' duty to impannel or summon juries composed of men of  <QUOTE> honest repute and of good ability, to consider of, and deliver their verdicts according to justice and the merits of the cause;</QUOTE>  to attend the judges on all commissions of oyer and terminer, and gaol delivery; to levy and pay into the exchequer all fines to the crown; to raise the <foreign lang=la>posse comitatus</foreign>, or power of the county, in cases of riot, when every person called upon by the sheriff, above the age of <num value="15">fifteen</num>, is subject to fine and imprisonment, if he refuses to comply with the summons; to attend on the lord mayor, on all state occasions, and to discharge the orders of the court of common council in all cases of petition to parliament, and of address, or even remonstrance to his majesty. The most painful part of the office of sheriff is that of seeing criminals executed; and in a metropolis so <pb id="p.272" n="272"> large as London, it is a duty they are frequently called on to perform. 
<p>In the execution of writs and processes, summoning juries, &amp;c. the sheriffs delegate their trust. In the city, this duty is performed 
<hi rend=italics>by</hi> secondaries, who purchase their appointments from the corporation, and are permanent under-sheriffs. In the county, in which department alone between <num value="20">twenty</num> and <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> writs are annually issued, the sheriffs appoint their own deputy, or undersheriff, and have besides a considerable number of bailiffs, or officers, who give security to a large amount for the faithful discharge of their office. 
<p>If either of the sheriffs die, while in office, the survivor cannot act till another is chosen. 
<p>In all elections of members of parliament, either for the city of London or the county of Middlesex, the sheriffs, to whom the writs are directed, are the returning officers; they convene the voters, preside at the poll, and adjourn it from day to day as they deem expedient. Their power in this respect, however, does not extend to the city of Westminster. 
<p>Formerly, sheriffs were disqualified from being members of parliament; but this gave the crown a power which has sometimes been rendered subversive of liberty. The resistance made by sir Edward Coke, sir Robert Phillips, and sir Thomas Wentworth, to the arbitrary measures of Charles I., induced that monarch, previous to the new parliament of <datestruct value="1623--"><year reg="1623">1623</year></datestruct>, to make them sheriffs of Buckinghamshire, Somersetshire, and Yorkshire, which at that time prevented them from sitting in parliament. Sir Edward Coke, however, still thwarted the crown; for, on being called upon to be sworn into office, he objected to the following part of the oath that was tendered to him:  <QUOTE> you shall do all your pain and diligence to destroy, and make to cease, all manner of heresies and errors, commonly called </QUOTE> Lollardies, <QUOTE> within your bailiwick from time to time, and assist all ordinaries and commissioners of the holy church, and favour and maintain them as you shall be rewarded.</QUOTE>  In consequence of the refusal of sir Edward to take this oath, it was not only dispensed with at the time, but ever afterwards omitted in the swearing--in of sheriffs. 
<p>On the revolution of <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>, the law which prevented sheriffs from sitting in parliament was modified, and by an act passed in the <num value="5">5th</num> of William and Mary, it was declared, that sheriffs, mayors, and bailiffs of boroughs are only disqualified in their respective jurisdictions, as being returning officers. Thus, though a sheriff of London cannot represent London or Middlesex during the time he is in office, yet he may be elected for any other place. 
<p> <QUOTE>The list of the sheriffs of London being carried no higher,</QUOTE>  says Mr. Maitland,  <QUOTE> by any author hitherto published, than the <num value="1">first</num> of Richard I. in the year <datestruct value="1189"><year reg="1189">1189</year></datestruct>, I shall supply that defect from a manuscript in the king's library, wherein the names of the said officers <pb id="p.273" n="273"> are carried up to the time of king Edward the Confessor; but the years of their respective governments not being ascertained, the dates of such offices of this city are only recorded from the year <datestruct value="1188"><year reg="1188">1188</year></datestruct>, as will appear by the following account of the said officers, taken from the most ancient record in the archives of Guildhall, intitled, <foreign lang=la>De Antiquis Legibus Liber</foreign>; by which I am not only enabled to rectify the mistakes and misnomers in Fabian, Arnold, and Stow, till the year <datestruct value="1266"><year reg="1266">1266</year></datestruct>, but likewise the dates of the several governments, and spelling the names of the said officers, which the said authors have unwarrantably modernized.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Maitland's London, vol. ii. p. <datestruct value="1202--"><year reg="1202">1202</year></datestruct>.</BIBL></NOTE>

<div1 type=chapter id="c.10" n="10"><HEAD>Lists and brief Accounts of the various Officers and Courts within the City.</HEAD>
 
<p>Besides the mayor, sheriffs, and aldermen, there are several other eminent officers belonging to the city.<NOTE>For the several natures and duties of the following officers, the author is indebted to a pamphlet printed by order of the court of common council, <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>.</NOTE>
 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.1"><HEAD>The Recorder.</HEAD>
 
<p>It is requisite that he should be a grave and learned lawyer, skilful in the customs of the city; he sits with and advises the lord mayor and aldermen, and is a judge of their court, and attends the court of common council, and when especially required, the several committees by them appointed, likewise the sessions of the peace and gaol delivery. He takes place in councils and in courts before any man that hath not been mayor, and learnedly delivers the sentences of the whole court. 
<p>The qualifications of the recorder of the city are thus set down in <num value="1">one</num> of the books of the chamber: that <QUOTE>he shall be, and is wont to be, <num value="1">one</num> of the most skilful and virtuous apprentices of the law of the whole kingdom; whose office is always to sit on the right hand of the mayor, in recording pleas, and passing judgments; and by whom records and processes, had before the lord mayor and aldermen at Great St. Martin's, ought to be recorded by word of mouth before the judges assigned there to correct errors. The mayor and aldermen have therefore used commonly to set forth all other businesses, touching the city, before the king and his council, as also in certain of the king's courts, by Mr. recorder, as a chief man endued with wisdom, and eminent for eloquence.</QUOTE> 
<p>The fee of the recorder was sometimes more, and sometimes less, according to time and merit, as appears in the <num value="4">fourth</num> book of <hi rend=italics>Liber Albus.</hi> In the reign of Edward I. it was only <QUOTE><measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure> sterling by the year, and <measure value="20d." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> pence</measure> for each charter written, and each testament enrolled.</QUOTE> It was afterwards raised to an <measure value="100bmark" type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> marks</measure>. And he was to have of the chamber such vesture <hi rend=italics>(Lineatam velpenulatam</hi>) lined or faced, and as often as the mayor and aldermen take every year. And his clerk, such as the serjeants of the chamber. The recorder, and his clerk, are wont to sit at the mayor's table.<NOTE><BIBL>Maitland, vol. ii. p. <datestruct value="1205--"><year reg="1205">1205</year></datestruct>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>His present allowance is <measure value="2500l." type=currency><num value="2500">2,500</num>l.</measure> a year. 
<p>What the recorder's office was long ago demanded to be, to wit, in the year <datestruct value="1304"><year reg="1304">1304</year></datestruct>, may be worthy to be read out of a record, <pb id="p.282" n="282"> viz. <foreign lang=la>Die lunae</foreign>, &amp;c. <QUOTE>On Monday after the feast of the Conversion of St. Paul, in the <num value="32">32nd</num> of king Edward, before the lords, John Le Blund, mayor, John de Burresorch, sheriff, William de Beton, Walter de Fynchingfield, William de Leyre, Thomas Romeyn, Adam de Folham, John of Canterbury, Simon de Paris, John de Dunstable, Richard de Gloucestre, Henry de Loucestre, Adam de Rokesle, &amp;c. aldermen, meeting together, John de Wengrave, alderman and recorder, was sworn, well and faithfully to render all the judgments of the hustings, after the mayor and aldermen should meet concerning their pleas, and agreed together; and also all other judgments touching the city of London, &amp;c. And that he shall do justice as well to poor as rich. And that all the pleas of the hustings, presently after the hustings is finished, he shall oversee, order, and cause to be enrolled, according to the things pleaded, &amp;c. And that he shall come prepared to dispatch the business of the city, &amp;c. when he shall be lawfully warned by the mayor and bailiffs.

<div2 type=section id="c.10.8"><HEAD>The Coroner of London.</HEAD>
 
<p>Called so from <foreign lang=la>Corona</foreign>, i. e. a crown, because he deals principally with the crown, or in matters appertaining to the imperial crown of England. As to the antiquity of this office, it appears there were coroners in the time of king Alfred, by the book, intituled 
<title>The Miroir</title>. The lord mayor for the time being is coroner, but hath his deputy for the management of the office. In ancient time this office was of such great esteem, that none could execute it under the degree of a knight. As the sheriff may inquire of all felonies, so the coroner is to inquire of all sudden deaths; and to that end he impannels a jury, takes evidence upon oath, and gives the charge to the jury. 
<p>In former times this officer was nominated and appointed by the king. In <num value="51">51</num> Edward III. the citizens prayed, that they might place and displace a coroner among themselves, answering unto the king what belongs thereunto. It was answered, the king will not depart with his ancient right. The present coroner is Thomas Shelton, esq. <pb id="p.287" n="287"> 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.9"><HEAD>The Comptroller.</HEAD>
 
<p>Has the care of the city's estates, under the direction of the committee for letting the city lands, the custody of the title deeds, and the preparation of all conveyances, leases, deeds, contracts, agreements, rentals, journals and proceedings relating thereto. 
<p>He is also the under chamberlain, and has equal power with the chamberlain in the admission of freemen and the enrolment and correction of apprentices, &amp;c. 
<p>The present comptroller is Joseph Bushnan, esq, 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.10"><HEAD>The City Remembrancer.</HEAD>
 
<p>Is employed in the business of the corporation in parliament. He attends with the sheriffs at the bar of the house of commons with all petitions from the corporation, and in the king's closet with the sheriffs, to know his majesty's pleasure when the corporation shall wait on him with their addresses, &amp;c.; and from time to time waits upon different officers of the state in matters depending between government and the corporation. He attends the house of commons during their session, and the courts of common council and all committees. The present remembrancer is Timothy Tyrrell, esq. 
<p>Besides the officers enumerated above, there are <num value="2">two</num> judges of the sheriffs' court, <num value="4">four</num> common pleaders, secondary of Giltspur-street Compter, secondary of the Poultry Compter, a solicitor, <num value="8">eight</num> attornies in the sheriffs' court, <num value="2">two</num> bridge-masters, and a hall-keeper. 
<p>There are also officers peculiarly belonging to the lord mayor's house. The <num value="1">first</num> are, the <num value="4">four</num> esquires of the lord mayor's house.<NOTE>The writer of an ingenious Essay in the <num value="1">first</num> volume of the <BIBL><TITLE>Every Day Book</TITLE>, p. <datestruct value="1331--"><year reg="1331">1331</year></datestruct></BIBL>, who appears to be in possession of great information upon the affairs of the lord mayor's household, judiciously observes: <QUOTE>To some it may appear very unimportant whether the lord mayor has on a violet or a scarlet gown, or whether the mace is always carried before him or not, and strictly speaking it is so; but while old customs are harmless, and tend to preserve dignity and good order, why should they not be observed?</QUOTE> A sufficient reason for not allowing such customs as these to be destroyed is the evidence they afford of the high estimation in which the person of the chief magistrate was held in ancient times. The citizens are above all interested in their preservation, for the same revolution which would deprive the lord mayor of his insignia would inevitably involve the corporation itself in the same ruin.</NOTE>
 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.11"><HEAD>The Sword-bearer.</HEAD>
 
<p>This officer is to attend the lord mayor and execute his orders for summoning courts of aldermen and common council, and to carry the sword before him, being the emblem of justice. He is also to see that all ancient customs are preserved. He is the <pb id="p.288" n="288"> principal officer of the lord mayor's household; he has his table at the lord mayor's mansion-house; for the support of which, there was formerly <measure value="1500l." type=currency><num value="1500">1,500</num>l.</measure> a year allowed. The dinners at this table are now reduced to about <num value="14">fourteen</num>. His dwelling, allowed him by the city, is at Justice-hall, in the Old Bailey. The gentleman that bears this office is Thomas Smith, esq. 
<p>The sword-bearer's place is honourable; inasmuch as the sword is needful to be borne before head officers of boroughs, or other corporate towns, to represent the state and princely office of the king's most excellent majesty, the chief governor. To the right of bearing which sword, in the chamber of London, this observation is to be made, according to an ancient writer of armoury *  <QUOTE> That the bearer must carry it upright, the hilts being holden under his bulk, and the blade directly up the midst of his breast, and so forth between the sword-bearer's brows. This, in distinction from bearing the sword in any town for a duke, or an earl, or a baron. If a duke, the blade thereof must lean from the head between the neck and the right shoulder, nearer to the head than the shoulder. And for an earl, the bearer must carry the same between the point of the shoulder and elbow: and so there is another different bearing of the sword for a baron.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Maitland ii. p. <datestruct value="1207--"><year reg="1207">1207</year></datestruct>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.12"><HEAD>The Common-hunt.</HEAD>
 
<p>The chief business of this office was to take care of the pack of hounds formerly belonging to the mayor and citizens, and to attend them in hunting, when they pleased. This officer's house, allowed him, was in Finsbury-fields.<NOTE>At present the Finsbury charity school in Tabernacle-row, City road, at a place formerly called Dog-house-bar.</NOTE> He had a yearly allowance, besides perquisites. He was to attend the lord mayor on set days, and was also master of the ceremonies. This office was abolished on the death of Mr. Charles Cotterell in <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>. 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.13"><HEAD>The Common-crier.</HEAD>

He had his dwelling allowed him in Aldersgate. This office is executed by Samuel Beddome, esq. <pb id="p.289" n="289"> 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.14"><HEAD>The Water bailiff.</HEAD>
 
<p>This officer is empowered by the lord mayor to act as sub-conservator of the Thames and Medway. In such capacity he is to look after the preservation of the river Thames, against all encroachments; and to look after the fishermen, for the preservation of the young fry, to prevent the destroying them by unlawful nets. For that end there are juries for each county that hath any part of it lying on the sides or shores of the said river. Which juries, summoned by the water-bailiff at certain times, make inquiry of all offences relating to the river and the fish; and make their presentments accordingly. He is also bound to attend the lord mayor on certain days in the week: and had his house in Cripplegate. The present water-bailiff is Nathaniel Saunders, jun. esq. 
<p>The <num value="4">four</num> esquires of the household wear damask gowns on state days; and the sword-bearer, in addition, a cap of maintenance of fur.

In the year <datestruct value="1471"><year reg="1471">1471</year></datestruct>, they were appointed each of them to have <num value="16">sixteen</num> serjeants, every serjeant to have his yeoman. And <num value="6">six</num> clerks, viz. a secondary, a clerk of the papers, and <num value="4">four</num> other clerks; besides the under-sheriffs' clerks, their stewards, butlers, porters, and others in the household. 
<hi rend=italics>An Account of the several Courts within the City and Liberties of London.</hi>
  The various opinions concerning the antiquity of the commonalty of this city having a share in the government thereof, have occasioned warm disputes between the advocates for the aldermen and commons, but seemingly to very little purpose; for instead of determining on either side, matters are as much embarrassed as ever. 
<p>That the government of London by aldermen is of Saxon origin, is almost demonstrable, by the charter of Henry I. granted to the city about <num value="35">thirty-five</num> years after the conquest; wherein all strangers are expressly commanded to pay no custom to any person, save to the owner of the soke, or his deputy: that the <pb id="p.291" n="291"> owner of the soke or ward, was the alderman, we think, is beyond dispute. But that the government of the city was not vested in the aldermen exclusive of the commons, does in some measure appear by the said charter; for as the latter were thereby empowered to chuse their own sheriff and justiciary, it is not to be questioned, but they were a part of the city legislature. 
<p>The common-councilmen at <num value="1">first</num> returned being only <num value="2">two</num> for each ward, the city commons thought it a number very insufficient to represent their numerous body; wherefore, in the year <datestruct value="1347"><year reg="1347">1347</year></datestruct>, it was agreed that each ward of the city should choose a number of common councilmen according to its dimensions, but none to exceed <num value="12">twelve</num>, nor any to have less than <num value="6">six</num>; which has been since increased to the present number. 
<p>The city of London being divided into <num value="25">twenty-five</num> wards, and they into <num value="236">two hundred and thirty-six</num> precincts, each thereof send a representative to the common council, who is elected after the same manner as an alderman, only with this difference, that as the lord mayor presides in the wardmote, and is judge of the poll at the election of an alderman, so are the aldermen of the several wards in all respects the same at the choice of common councilmen. 
<p>The several parts which compose the city legislature, very much resemble those which constitute that of the kingdom; for as the king is the chief estate of parliament, so is the lord mayor of the common council; and as the house of lords and commons are subordinate to the former, so are the aldermen and common councilmen to the latter; but the <num value="3">three</num> estates of the national representative enjoying separately the rights of the negative, that belonging to the common council of the city is only vested in <num value="2">two</num>, viz. the aldermen and common councilmen. 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.17"><HEAD>The Court of Lord Mayor and Aldermen.</HEAD>
 
<p>The court of lord mayor and aldermen is a court of record, wherein is lodged a great part of the executive power, whereby all leases and other instruments that pass the city seal are executed, contests relating to water-courses, rights, and party-walls, adjusted, and the city officers suspended and punished according to the notoriety of their several offences. 
<p>The said court has not only a power of electing annually <num value="11">eleven</num> overseers, or rulers of the fraternity of watermen, but likewise a right of fixing their several taxes, with the approbation of the privy council: and also a right of disposing of most of the following places belonging to the city, viz. the recorder, steward of Southwark, justice of the bridge-yard, clerk to the lord mayor, and assistant, clerk to the sitting justices, and assistant clerk to the sitting magistrate for the borough of Southwark, the district 
<p>U <num value="2">2</num> <pb id="p.292" n="292"> surveyors, keeper and ordinary of Newgate, keeper of the debtors prison and of the Borough Compter, surgeon of Newgate and house of correction, and of the debtors' prison, barge-master, and the beadles of the court of requests. 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.18"><HEAD>The Court of Common Council.</HEAD>
 
<p>This court, as already observed, consists of the lord mayor, aldermen, and representatives of the several wards; and being the city legislature, make bye-laws for the good government thereof; they assemble in Guildhall, as often as the lord mayor by his summons thinks proper to convene them; they annually select from among themselves a committee of <num value="12">twelve</num> aldermen and <num value="30">thirty</num> commoners, for letting the city lands. They likewise appoint the following committees, viz. <num value="10">ten</num> aldermen and <num value="30">thirty</num> commoners, for letting the bridge-house estates; <num value="4">four</num> aldermen and <num value="8">eight</num> commoners, for transacting the affairs belonging to the benefactions of sir Thomas Gresham, the lord mayor being always <num value="1">one</num> of the number; <num value="16">sixteen</num> aldermen and <num value="30">thirty</num> commoners for improving the navigation of the river Thames; <num value="16">sixteen</num> aldermen and <num value="30">thirty</num> commoners as a committee of control over the coal and corn meters; <num value="16">sixteen</num> aldermen and <num value="30">thirty</num> commoners as a committee for general purposes; the lord mayor and certain of the aldermen, together with <num value="30">thirty</num> commoners, as a committee for improvements within the city, and the same for improving the port of London. They also, by virtue of a royal grant, yearly appoint a governor, deputy, and assistants, for managing the city lands in Ireland. They have also a right of disposing of the offices of town-clerk, common-serjeant, judges of the sheriffs' court, common pleader, common crier, coroner, bailiff of the borough of Southwark, comptroller, remembrancer, solicitor, clerk of the peace, registrar of the mayor's court, clerks of the court of requests, comptroller of the bridge-house, water-bailiff, clerk of the works, coal meters, keeper of Guildhall and assistants, clerk at the bridge-house, collector of the city dues, <num value="3">three</num> clerks of the coal market, and keeper of the Green-yard. 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.19"><HEAD>The Court of Husting.</HEAD>
 
<p>This court is of Saxon origin, and is the most ancient in the kingdom; its name is a Saxon compound of <hi rend=italics>Hus</hi> and 
<hi rend=italics>Ding</hi>, the former implying a house, and the latter a thing, cause, suit, or plea; whereby it is manifest that <hi rend=italics>husding</hi> imports a house or hall, wherein causes are heard and determined; which is farther evinced by the Saxon <hi rend=italics>dingere</hi> or <hi rend=italics>thingere</hi>, an advocate or lawyer. 
<p>This, which is a court of record, and the supreme judicature of the city of London, and weekly held on Tuesdays, was originally <pb id="p.293" n="293"> established for the preservation of the laws, franchises, and customs of the city, and wherein presided as judges the principal magistrates, as at present do the lord mayor and sheriffs, who are assisted by the recorder upon all causes of consequence. In this court <num value="2">two</num> sorts of causes are pleadable, viz. pleas of land, and common pleas, which are held distinctly; for <num value="1">one</num> week pleas merely real are held, and the next, mixed actions are decided. Here deeds are enrolled, recoveries passed, writs of right, waste, partition, dower, and replevins, determined.<NOTE>This court is regularly adjourned, but no cause has been tried in it for several years past.</NOTE>
 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.20"><HEAD>The Lord Mayor's Court.</HEAD>
 
<p>This is a court of record held before the lord mayor and aldermen, but substantially the recorder is the judge, wherein actions of debt, trespass, attachments, &amp;c. arising within the city and liberties of any value may be tried, and actions from the sheriffs' court removed hither, before the jury be sworn. 
<p>This is also a court of chancery or equity, respecting affairs transacted in the city and liberties; and gives relief when judgment is obtained in the sheriffs' court, for more than the just debt. This court has an office peculiar to itself, held at present in the west wing of the Royal Exchange, consisting of <num value="4">four</num> attorneys, by whom all actions cognizable therein are entered, for the execution whereof there are <num value="6">six</num> serjeants at mace, who daily attend in the said office. 
<p>.To this court and that of the sheriffs is confined the peculiar privilege attached to the city of London (in common only with a few ancient trading cities in England) of foreign attachment, a process anomalous to the common law of the land, but of great benefit to the citizens of London and the community at large, inasmuch as large sums are daily received by such means, which in consequence of the absence of the debtors from the kingdom, would be otherwise lost. The custom is this, if a creditor finds within the city of London, goods or money belonging to his debtor, in the hands of a factor or banker, or that any person is indebted to such debtor, he can attach such goods, money, or debts, and if the debtor does not give bail for his appearance before judgment is obtained in the attachment, the plaintiff recovers the thing attached. But as this might work an injustice to the debtor, in consequence of his absence from the country at the time judgment is given against his property, the plaintiff in the attachment gives security to restore the money, if the debtor comes into court within a year and a day after the judgment, and shews that the debt of the party attaching, is not a just <num value="1">one</num>. The costs of proceedings in the cause are so low, when compared <pb id="p.294" n="294"> with the courts at Westminster, as to render proceedings here, when they can be adopted, very desirable to the party sueing. In addition to the peculiar practices of the court, all actions which are maintainable in the superior courts, can be maintained and tried in the lord mayor's court; and as the stat. of <num value="7">7th</num> and <num value="8">8th</num> Geo. IV. c. <num value="17">17</num>, s. <num value="6">6</num>, confines debts under <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">20</num>l.</measure> to this court, great advantages are derived to the parties sueing, inasmuch as a just debt must be recovered in a space of little more than <num value="6">six</num> weeks, which is in general the utmost time a defendant can gain, at a comparatively trifling expense. The advantages attending the commencement of actions in this court are so great, as to account for the quantity of business and the large sums which are constantly recovered there. 
<p>The juries for trying causes in this, and the sheriffs' courts, are by the several courts of wardmote annually returned at Christmas, when each ward, according to custom, appoint a sufficient number of persons to serve on the said juries for every month of the year, as follows: 
<p>January.-Aldgate, Portsoken, and Cornhill. 
<p>February.-Cheap Ward. 
<p>March.-Bassishaw and Cripplegate within and without. 
<p>April.-Vintry and Bread-street. 
<p>May.-Tower and Billingsgate. 
<p>June.-Farringdon without. 
<p>July.-Bridge. 
<p>August.-Aldersgate, Coleman-street, and Broad-street. 
<p>September.-Farringdon within and Castle Baynard. 
<p>October.-Queenhithe, Dowgate, and Walbrook. 
<p>November.-Langbourn and Lime-street. 
<p>December.-Candlewick, Cordwainer, and Bishopsgate. 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.21"><HEAD>The Sheriffs' Courts.</HEAD>
 
<p>These are courts of record, held in Guildhall, of which the sheriffs being judges, each has his assistant or deputy, who are commonly called judges of these courts, before whom are tried actions of debt, trespass, covenant, &amp;c. To each of these courts belong <num value="4">four</num> attornies, who upon their being admitted by the court of aldermen, have the following oath administered to them:-- 
<TEXT><BODY><HEAD>The Oath. 
<p>Ye shall swear, that ye shall well and lawfully do your office of attorney, and well and lawfully examine your clients, and their quarrels, without champarty, and without procuring of any juries, or any inquest embracing. And that ye shall change no quarrel out of his nature, after your understanding. Also ye shall plead, <pb id="p.295" n="295"> 
<hi rend=italics>ne ley</hi>, nor suffer to be pleaded or leyed by your assent, no foreign release, acquittance, payment, arbitration, plain account, whatsoever it be, to put the court out of his jurisdiction, nor none other matter; but it be such as ye may find rightful and true by the information of your client, whose information and saying upon your oath and conscience ye shall think to be true. 
<p>And ye shall not inform ne inforce any man to sue falsely against any person by false or forged action. Ready ye shall be at all times to come and attend at the warning of the said maior, and of the sheriffs of the said city, unless ye be letted about the business of this city, or for some other reasonable cause. The franchises, laws, and ordinances of this city, you shall keep, and due to be kept to your power. And that well and lawfully ye shall do all things that to the office of attorney pertaineth to do. As God help you.</TEXT>
 
<p>To each of these courts likewise belong a secondary, a clerk of the papers, a prothonotary, and <num value="4">four</num> clerks sitters. The secondary's office is to allow and return all writs brought to remove causes out of the said courts; the clerk of the papers files and copies all declarations upon actions: the prothonotary draws and engrosses all declarations; the clerks sitters enter actions and attachments, and take bail and verdicts. To each of the compters or prisons belonging to these courts, appertain <num value="16">sixteen</num> serjeants at mace, with a yeoman to each, besides inferior officers, and the prison keeper. 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.22"><HEAD>The Court of Orphans.</HEAD>
 
<p>This court was formerly held by the lord mayor and aldermen, who were guardians to children that were under the age of <num value="21">twenty-one</num> years, at the decease of their fathers; and who took upon them not only the care and management of their goods and chattels, but likewise that of their persons, by committing them to careful and faithful tutors, to prevent disposing of themselves during their minority, without their approbation. 
<p>The common serjeant was authorized by the said court to take exact accounts and inventories of all deceased freemen's estates; and the youngest attorney of the mayor's court, being clerk to that of the orphans, was appointed to take securities for their several portions, in the name of the chamberlain of London, who is a sole corporation of himself, for the service of the said orphans; and to whom a recognizance or bond, made upon the account of an orphan, shall, by the custom of London, descend to his successor; which is hardly known elsewhere. 
<p>When a freeman of London dies, and leaves children in their minority, the clerks of the several parishes were to give in their names to the common crier, who was thereupon immediately to <pb id="p.296" n="296"> summon the widow, or executor, to appear before the court of lord mayor and aldermen, to bring in an inventory of, and give security for the testator's estate; for which, <num value="2">two</num> months time was commonly allowed; and in case of non-appearance, or refusal of security, the lord mayor might commit the contumacious executor to Newgate.<NOTE>This court has become obsolete.</NOTE>
 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.23"><HEAD>Justice-Hall Court.</HEAD>
 
<p>This court is held by the king's commission of <foreign lang=la>oyer</foreign> and <foreign lang=la>terminer</foreign>, at justice-hall in the Old Bailey, <num value="8">eight</num> times a year, for trying of criminals, for crimes committed within the city of London and county of Middlesex; the judges of the court are, the lord mayor, aldermen that are past the chair, and the recorder, who on all such occasions are attended by both the sheriffs, and generally by <num value="1">one</num> or more of the <num value="12">twelve</num> judges. All offences committed in the city are tried by a jury of citizens; and those committed in the county, by <num value="1">one</num> of that. The crimes and misdemeanours tried in this court, are high and petty treason, murder, felony, perjury, forgery, petty larceny, cheating, libelling, false weights and measures, &amp;c. the penalties incurred by which, are the loss of life, corporal punishment, transportation, amerciaments, &amp;c. 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.24"><HEAD>The Coroner's Court.</HEAD>
 
<p>The lord mayor being perpetual coroner of the city, this court is held before him, or his deputy, who is to inquire into the cause of the death of any person, who, upon sight of the body, is supposed to have come to an untimely end, as he is likewise into the escape of the murderer; and also concerning found treasure, deodands, and wrecks at sea. 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.25"><HEAD>The Court of Escheator.</HEAD>
 
<p>The lord mayor of London being perpetual escheator within the city, this court is also held before him or his deputy, to whom all original writs of <foreign lang=la>Diem clausit extremum, Mandamus, Devenerunt, Melius inquirend, &amp;c.</foreign> are directed to find an office for the king, after the death of his tenant who held by knight's service. The escheator may also find an office for treason, felony, &amp;c. 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.26"><HEAD>The Court of Conservacy.</HEAD>
 
<p>This court is yearly held <num value="8">eight</num> times before the lord mayor, at <pb id="p.297" n="297"> such places and times as his lordship shall think fit to appoint within the respective counties of Middlesex, Essex, Kent, and Surrey; in which several counties he has a power of summoning juries, who for the better preservation of the fishery of the river Thames, and regulation of the fishermen that fish therein, are upon oath to make inquisition of all offences committed in and upon the said river from Staines-bridge in the west, to Yenfleet in the east; and to present all persons that are found guilty of a breach of the articles. 
<p>And for the more effectual preservation of the navigation and fish in the river Thames, the lord mayor, as conservator thereof, has his assistant or deputy, the water-bailiff; who, together with his substitutes, detect and bring to justice all such persons as shall presume to destroy either the current or fish of the said river. 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.27"><HEAD>The Court of Requests.</HEAD>
 
<p>This excellent court, from its reasonable and equitable proceedings, is commonly called the court of conscience, and which had its beginning in the <num value="9">ninth</num> of Henry VIII. anno <datestruct value="1518"><year reg="1518">1518</year></datestruct>, by act of common council, whereby it was ordained, that the court of lord mayor and aldermen should monthly appoint <num value="2">two</num> aldermen and <num value="4">four</num> commoners to be commissioners thereof, who were to sit weekly in Guildhall on Wednesdays and Saturdays, to hear and decide all causes brought before them for the recovery of debts not exceeding <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num> shillings</measure>. 
<p>This being an experimental act, was only made for <num value="2">two</num> years; but upon its being found to be of great use and benefit to the poor, it was renewed and continued by divers acts of common council, and the number of commissioners increased to <num value="14">fourteen</num>; in which state it continued till the <num value="3">3rd</num> of king James I. <datestruct value="1606--"><year reg="1606">1606</year></datestruct>, at which time divers cruel and inexorable creditors, despising the authority of the same, commenced suits in superior courts against several citizens for trifling debts, to the ruin of them and their poor families; wherefore the city in the year aforesaid, applied to parliament for redress of this grievance, by which it was enacted, that all the citizens, and others inhabiting within the city of 
<p>London, and liberties thereof, who then had, or thereafter shall have any debt or debts due, or becoming due to him or them, by any citizens, &amp;c. as aforesaid, not amounting to the sum of <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num> shillings</measure>, that he or they should, or might cause such debtor or debtors, to be summoned to appear before the commissioners of the court of requests at Guildhall, by the officer thereunto belonging; where they, or any <num value="3">three</num> thereof, are empowered to hear and determine all matters between citizen and citizen, &amp;c. touching debts not amounting to <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num> shillings</measure>; and in a judicial manner to administer oaths to plaintiffs, defendants, and witnesses. And for the more effectual preventing all litigious and merciless creditors from ruining their poor debtors, it was ordained, that if <pb id="p.298" n="298"> by any action of debt, brought against a citizen of London, in any of the courts of Westminster, or elsewhere (out of the said court of requests) it shall appear to the judge or judges where such action shall be prosecuted, that the debt sued for does not amount to <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num> shillings</measure>, in such case, the said judge or judges, instead of allowing the plaintiff or plaintiffs any costs of suit, they shall adjudge the said plaintiff to pay to the defendant all such costs as he shall make appear to have been by him disbursed in defending the said suit. 
<p>It was also ordained, by the authority aforesaid, that if either plaintiff or defendant, after having been duly summoned, shall refuse to appear before the said commissioners in the court of requests, or shall refuse to obey the orders or decisions of the said court; in both such cases, the commissioners are empowered to commit such person or persons to either of the compters, till he, she, or they shall submit to the rules and determinations of the said court. 
<p>Perhaps never a court of justice was better adapted than this, for the ease and relief both of debtor and creditor; for here the <num value="1">first</num> is not exposed to the payment of exorbitant charges, and the latter may recover his debt with the greatest expedition, at a trifling expense.<NOTE><BIBL>Maitland, ii. p. <datestruct value="1211--"><year reg="1211">1211</year></datestruct>.</BIBL></NOTE> The amount has been since extended by the stat. <num value="39">39</num> and <num value="40">40</num> Geo. <num value="3">3</num>, c. <num value="104">104</num>, to debts amounting to <measure value="5l." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>l.</measure> If the defendant do not appear the <num value="2">second</num> court day, after being regularly summoned, an attachment is awarded against him; which compelling him to appear, the charge is thereby enhanced. 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.28"><HEAD>The Court of Wardmote.</HEAD>
 
<p>This court is so denominated from the words ward and mote, that is, the ward court; for in London parishes are as towns, and wards as hundreds; wherefore this court resembles that of the leet in the county: for, as the latter derives its authority from the county court, so does the former from that of the lord mayor; as is manifest by the annual precept issued by the lord mayor to the several aldermen, for holding their respective leets, for the election of proper officers in each ward; the tenor whereof is as follows: 
<p>To the alderman of the ward of---- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>We charge and command you, that upon St. Thomas's day, the apostle, next coming, you do hold your wardmote; and that you have afore us, at our general court of aldermen, to be holden the Monday next after the feast of the Epiphany next coming, all the defaults that shall be presented afore you by inquest in the said wardmote; and the said inquest shall have full power and authority, by <num value="1">one</num> whole year, to inquire and present all such <pb id="p.299" n="299"> defaults as shall be found within your said ward, as oftentimes as shall be thought to you expedient and needful; which we will shall be once every month at least.

And if it happen any of your said inquest do die, or depart out of the said ward within the said year, that then in place of him or them so dying, or departing out of your said ward, you cause to be chosen <num value="1">one</num> able person in his stead, to inquire and present with the other, in manner and form above-said. 
<p><num value="3">3</num>. And that at the said general court, you give afore us the names and sirnames of all of them of your said ward that come not to your said wardmote, if they be duly warned, so that due redress and punishment of them may be had, as the case shall require, according to the law. 
<p><num value="4">4</num>. And that you do provide, that at all times convenient a sufficient watch be kept: and that lanterns with light by nightertail, in old manner accustomed, be hanged forth; and that no man go by nightertail without light, nor with vizard, on the peril that belongeth thereto. 
<p><num value="5">5</num>. And also, that you do cause to be chosen men, of the most sufficient, honest, and discreet men, of your said ward, to be for your said ward of the common council of this city for the year ensuing, according to the custom in that behalf yearly used. And also, that you do cause the said men, so to be chosen to be of the common council, to be sworn before you, and in your presence, according to the oath by them used, and of old time accustomed. 
<p><num value="6">6</num>. And that also in the said wardmote you cause to be chosen certain other honest persons, to be constables and scavengers, and a common beadle, and a raker to make clean the streets and lanes of all your said ward, according to the custom yearly used in that behalf; which constables have, and shall have full power and authority to distrain for the salary and quarterage of the said beadle and raker, as oftentimes as it shall be behind or unpaid. 
<p><num value="7">7</num>. Also, that you keep a roll of the names, sirnames, dwelling-places, professions and trades of all persons dwelling within your ward, and within what constable's precinct they dwell; wherein the place is to be specially noted by street, lane, alley or sign. 
<p><num value="8">8</num>. Also, that you cause every constable, from time to time to certify unto you the name, sirname, dwelling-place, profession and trade of every person who shall newly come to dwell within his precinct, whereby you may make and keep your roll perfect; and that you cause every constable for his precinct, to that purpose, to make and keep a perfect roll in like manner. 
<p><num value="9">9</num>. Also, that you give special charge to every innholder, and other persons within your ward, who shall receive any person to sojourn in his house above <num value="2">two</num> days, shall, before the <num value="3">third</num> day after his coming thither, give knowledge to the constable of the precinct where he shall be so received, of the name, sirname, <pb id="p.300" n="300"> dwelling-place, profession and trade of life, or place of service of such person, and for what cause he shall come to reside there. And that the said innholder lodge no suspected person, or men or women of evil name. 
<p><num value="10">10</num>. Also, that you cause every constable within his precinct, once every month at the farthest, and oftener if need require, to make diligent search and inquiry what persons be newly come into his precinct to dwell, sojourn or lodge; and that you give special charge, that no innholder or person shall resist, or deny any constable in making such search or inquiry, but shall do his best endeavour to aid and assist him therein. 
<p><num value="11">11</num>. And for that of late there is more resort to the city, of persons evil-affected in religion and otherwise, than in former times hath been; you shall diligently inquire if any man be received to dwell or abide within your ward, that is not put under frank-pledge, as he ought to be by the custom of the city: and whether any person hath continued in the said ward by the space of <num value="1">one</num> year, being above the age of <num value="12">twelve</num> years, and not sworn to be faithful and loyal to the king's majesty, in such sort as by the law and custom of this city he ought to be. 
<p><num value="12">12</num>. To all these purposes, the beadle of every ward shall employ his diligence, and give his best furtherance. 
<p><num value="13">13</num>. Also you are to take order, that there be provided and set up a pair of stocks, and a whipping-post, in some convenient place in every parish within your ward, for the punishing of vagrants and other offenders. 
<p><num value="14">14</num>. Also, that you have special regard that from time to time there be convenient provision for hooks, ladders, buckets, spouts and engines in meet places, within the several parishes of your ward, for avoiding the peril of fire. 
<p><num value="15">15</num>. Also, that the streets and lanes of this city be from time to time kept clean before every church, house, shop, warehouse, door, deadwall, and in all other common passages and streets of the said ward. 
<p><num value="16">16</num>. And whereas by divers acts of common council aforetime made and established for the common-weal of this city, among other things it is ordained and enacted, as hereafter ensueth.

<p><FIGURE id="Fig.305"><HEAD>Arms of the see of London</HEAD></FIGURE> 
<p>It is certain that not long after the <num value="1">first</num> introduction of Christianity into Britain, London was erected into a bishop's see; but at what particular period, or by whom, is involved in obscurity. <pb id="p.306" n="306"> In the list of ecclesiastics, who formed the <num value="2">second</num> general council held at Aries, in France, in <num value="326">326</num>, we have the presence of a bishop of London recorded in these terms: <QUOTE lang=la>Ex Provincia Britanniae Civitate Londinensi Restitutus Episcopus.</QUOTE> Joceline of Furnes, in his book of British bishops, says, that this Restitutus was the <num value="12">twelfth</num> bishop of London; but no dependence can be placed on the accuracy of his list. 
<p>It was not till the time of Pope Gregory the Great, that Augustine, who had been called the apostle of the English, restored the light of the gospel. Among the <num value="1">first</num> converts was Ethelbert, king of Kent, who, about <num value="610">610</num>, erected London of new into a bishop's see, and founded St. Paul's cathedral. 
<p>This diocese, which has never experienced any alteration, being formed of the ancient kingdom of the East Saxons, is in the province of Canterbury, and is composed of the counties of Middlesex, Essex, and part of Hertfordshire, and latterly the British plantations in America. The following parishes in the city are, however, exempt from the bishop's jurisdiction, being peculiars, under the immediate government of the archbishop of Canterbury: viz. Allhallows, Bread-street; Allhallows, Lombard-street; St. Dionis, Back-church; St. Dunstan in the East; St. John the Baptist; St. Leonard, Eastcheap; St. Mary Aldermary; St. Mary Bothaw; St. Mary-le-bow; St. Michael Royal; St. Pancras, Soper-lane; and St. Vedast, Foster-lane. It is governed by a bishop, who is assisted by a dean, precentor, chancellor, treasurer, <num value="5">five</num> archdeacons, <num value="30">thirty</num> canons or prebendaries, <num value="12">twelve</num> petty or minor canons, <num value="6">six</num> vicars choral, a sub-dean, and other inferior officers. 
<p>In common with all the bishops of the realm, the bishop of London has the power of holding a court in his own diocese, for the trial and punishment of spiritual offences, in which he may either sit as judge himself, or depute his power to a chancellor, suffragan, or other officer. The bishops' court, therefore, though held by the king's authority, are not properly to be accounted the king's courts, since none of the judges possess this privilege, neither are writs from them issued in the name of the king, but of the bishop. 
<p>In precedence, the bishop of London ranks next after the <num value="2">two</num> archbishops, and is stiled, in some of the old statutes, <foreign lang=la>Primus Baro Regni</foreign>, the ecclesiastical barons taking precedence of all the temporal barons. It is also the privilege of this diocese, not to be subject to the visitation of the archbishop of Canterbury. 
<p>The dean is to assist the bishop in ordinations, deprivations, and other affairs of the church; and on the king's writ of <foreign lang=fr>Cong&eacute; d&lsquo;elire</foreign>, the dean and prebendaries elect the bishop; but this election is now a mere matter of form, since the person recommended by the king is always chosen. The dean is also elected by the chapter, on letters missive from the king, whose assent must be obtained before the bishop can confirm and give power to instal him. <pb id="p.307" n="307"> 
<p>The sum at which the see is entered in the king's books, is <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num>l.</measure>, but it is estimated to be worth at least <measure value="12000l." type=currency><num value="12000">12,000</num>l.</measure> per annum. 
<p>The precentor, or chanter, is to superintend the church music; under him is a sub-chanter, who officiates in his absence. The <num value="2">second</num> stall, on the north side of the choir, belongs to this officer, whose corps is in the church of Stortford, of which he is proprietor and perpetual rector, and patron of the vicarage. 
<p>The chancellor was anciently called <foreign lang=la>Magister scholarum</foreign>, from having had the charge of literature within the city of London, whereby he was empowered to license all the schoolmasters in the city, except those of St. Mary-le-Bow, and St. Martin-le-Grand; but at present, he is only secretary to the chapter. He has the <num value="3">third</num> stall on the north side of the choir, and his corps is in the church of Boreham and Yelling. 
<p>The treasurer has the custody of the valuables belonging to the cathedral church of St. Paul; for the faithful keeping of which he is sworn before the dean and chapter. He has the <num value="3">third</num> stall on the south side of the choir, and his corps is in the church of Pelham and Aldebri. Under him is the sacrist, who is also sworn to the faithful discharge of his office, <num value="3">three</num> vergers, and the inferior servants of the church. 
<p>The <num value="5">five</num> archdeaconries are those of London, Essex, Middlesex, Colchester, and St. Alban's. Their office is to visit the several cures within their respective archdeaconries, and to inquire into the reparations and moveables belonging to them; to reform slight abuses in ecclesiastical matters, and to bring affairs of moment before the bishop. It is also the office of the archdeacon to induct clerks into their benefices upon the bishop's mandate. 
<p>The <num value="30">thirty</num> canons, or prebendaries, with the bishop, compose the chapter, by which the affairs of the church are managed. All the prebends are in the collation of the bishop, and out of them there are <num value="3">three</num> residentiaries, besides the dean: so called from their continual residence in the church. 
<p>The prebends belonging to this cathedral are as follows; viz.

<p>With respect to the ancient state of the parish priests of London, it is to be observed that their revenues did not arise from a glebe, or from tythe of lands, but from customary payments issuing out of the houses of their parishioners according to the value of the rents, which were called <hi rend=italics>oblations</hi>, because they were small pieces of money offered by each parishioner to God and the church, on certain holidays. 
<p>This custom had been used for many ages, but the earliest document on record for regulating the amount of the payments, is the constitution of Roger Niger, bishop of London, from <datestruct value="1229--"><year reg="1229">1229</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1241--"><year reg="1241">1241</year></datestruct>, whereby the citizens were enjoined to pay to their respective parish priests on all Sundays and: festivals, the vigils of which <pb id="p.310" n="310"> were to be observed as feasts, <num value="1">one</num> farthing for every house at <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure> a year rent; a halfpenny for <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="20">twenty</num>, and for those of <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num> shillings</measure> <num value="1">one</num> penny each: all which amounted to about <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence in the pound; for there were but <num value="8">eight</num> apostle's days on which these payments were to be made, and if any of these chanced to fall on a Sunday, there was only <num value="1">one</num> payment made for that day. 
<p>This mode of payment continued, until the <num value="13">13th</num> Richard II. when Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, published  <QUOTE>An Explanation</QUOTE>  of the constitution made by Niger, in which he added <num value="22">twenty-two</num> other saint's days, by which the payments were increased to <measure value="3s. 5d." type=Currency><num value="3">three</num> shillings and <num value="5">five</num> pence</measure> in the pound; but this having occasioned contests between the inhabitants and their pastors, a bull of confirmation was issued by Pope Innocent, in the <num value="5">5th</num> year of Henry IV. Still the citizens were dissatisfied, and notwithstanding a <num value="2">second</num> bull of confirmation by pope Nicholas, in the <num value="31">31st</num> of Henry VI. they caused a record or protest to be made, in which they asserted, that the order of explanation by the archbishop of Canterbury, was surreptitiously obtained, without the knowledge and consent of the citizens of London, and was to be considered rather as a destructive, than a declaratory law. 
<p>Notwithstanding this opposition of the citizens, they were constrained to pay on the additional saint's days, until the <num value="17">17th</num> of Henry VIII. when the matter in dispute being referred to the lord chancellor and privy council, an act of parliament, founded upon their report, was passed, by which the rate was reduced to <measure value="2s. 9d." type=Currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings and <num value="9">nine</num> pence</measure> in the pound. 
<p>But although the citizens obtained this diminution of the rate, they remained equally unwilling to pay it, and sought to reduce it by various stratagems, particularly by taking their houses at low nominal rents, and making up the difference to the landlord by yearly or quarterly fines, annuities, new year's gifts, &amp;c. whereby the clergy were defrauded of their just demands, which occasioned repeated applications to parliament, and to the king and council, but no effectual redress was obtained, until after the fire of London. 
<p>By this event, <num value="84">eighty four</num> of the <num value="97">ninety seven</num> parish churches within the walls were destroyed, and their number being greatly reduced by the uniting of several parishes into <num value="1">one</num>, in pursuance of the act for rebuilding the city, it was found necessary to make a more certain provision for the incumbents of the several livings; in consequence of which an act was passed in <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>, for providing a fixed annual revenue for the maintenance of the parsons, vicars, and curates, of the respective single or united parishes, to be raised by an equal assessment.

<div1 type=chapter id="c.12" n="12"><HEAD>Some Account of the Military Government of London, and the Artillery Company.</HEAD>
 
<p>Though the origin of the military government of London cannot be ascertained, it nevertheless must be of great antiquity; for in the year <datestruct value="896"><year reg="896">896</year></datestruct>, the London auxiliaries, having joined Alfred, marched to dislodge the Danes from a place in Hertfordshire, supposed to have been the town of Hertford. Therefore it is highly probable, that if a military government was not at <num value="1">first</num> settled in this city by that great prince, yet that the same was established by him after the reduction thereof from the Danes, in the year <datestruct value="883"><year reg="883">883</year></datestruct>, we think, may reasonably be presumed; since which time, by the many gallant actions performed by the citizens, in the most dangerous enterprizes, we may reasonably conclude, that they have always had the greatest regard to the support of the military art, seeing their lives and fortunes so often depended thereon. 
<p>In the reign of Ethelred, the Londoners bravely resisted <num value="3">three</num> attacks by the Danes; and thrice also was Canute repulsed when he laid siege to the city, nor did he ultimately gain possession of it, until, by a compromise with his rival, a division of territory was agreed upon. With equal spirit did the citizens refuse to admit William the Conqueror, when his arms had been victorious over Harold's army, until the clergy and the men of rank set the example of submission. It is true that Domesday-book, the oldest record of military service extant, does not mention the Londoners, but the reason of this is to be found in the peculiar nature of their civic privileges. The citizens did not, like other persons under the feudal system, hold their possessions by the tenure of military service; London was the  <QUOTE> king's own chamber,</QUOTE>  where all were free, and all service was spontaneous. But though not bound to furnish any particular quota of fighting men, the Londoners always mustered in great force, when an enemy was in the field; indeed it would seem from their numerous arrays, and the indiscriminate manner in which they turned out at every call to arms, that in early times every citizen was a soldier. It appears that playing at bucklers, and practising feats of arms, was <num value="1">one</num> of the most ancient and favorite amusements of the London apprentices. 
<p> <QUOTE>Every Sunday in Lent,</QUOTE>  says Fitzstephen,  <QUOTE>immediately after dinner, it was customary for great crowds of young Londoners mounted on war horses, well trained, to perform the requisite turnings and evolutions, to ride into the fields in distinct bands, armed with shields and headless lances, where they exhibited the representation of battles, and went through a variety of warlike exercises.</QUOTE>  He adds, that young noblemen from the king's court, and from the houses of the barons, often joined the citizens in the trial <pb id="p.319" n="319"> of their skill in arms. Numerous exploits are recorded, which attest the spirit and promptness with which the skill thus acquired, was, in maturer life, exerted in the defence of the city and kingdom. During what are called the barons' wars, in the reigns of Stephen, John, and Henry III., Fitzstephen says, that there went out of the city to a general muster no less than <num value="20000">20,000</num> horsemen and <num value="60000">60,000</num> foot; and though unquestionably there must have been included in these numbers many vassals of the noblemen, who had then castles and inns within the city, and of others who had sought the protection of its walls, yet it is clear, from the preponderance which the Londoners invariably gave to the party, whose cause they espoused at this period, that they must have constituted a very considerable portion of the force. 
<p>Often did the citizens contend in arms against the power that sought to oppress them in the reign of Henry III., and on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, Stowe relates, they  <QUOTE>fortified the city with iron chains, drawne overthwarte their streets, munited the citie, and did marvellous things.</QUOTE>  
<p>The manufacture of armour must, at this period, have been very considerable, for when Louis the Dauphin contended for the crown of England against Henry III, in the year <datestruct value="1216"><year reg="1216">1216</year></datestruct>, the city of London sent him <num value="600">six hundred</num> knights and <num value="60000">60,000</num> coats of mail. In the time of Edward II. the queen having been refused admittance into Leeds castle, in Kent, the king called to him  <QUOTE>the commons of Essex and London,</QUOTE>  by whose assistance it was speedily reduced; but that this demand on the Londoners for military service might not be construed into an admission of their ordinary liability to such requisitions, the king, by his letters patent, declared  <QUOTE>that the circumstance should not be prejudicial to them, nor drawn into precedent for time to come.</QUOTE>  
<p>In <datestruct value="1326--"><year reg="1326">1326</year></datestruct>, when the queen had taken part with the barons, the king demanded from the citizens a supply of men and money. The answer they made was, that  <QUOTE>they would not go out of their city to fight, except they might, according to their liberties, return home again the same day before the sunset.</QUOTE>  
<p>During the French wars in the reign of Edward III., the quota of troops contributed by London was comparatively small. In <datestruct value="1346--"><year reg="1346">1346</year></datestruct>, they furnished only <num value="100">100</num> men at arms, and <num value="500">500</num> foot soldiers, and in <datestruct value="1355--"><year reg="1355">1355</year></datestruct>, <num value="25">25</num> men at arms and <num value="500">500</num> archers. Probably more were not required, for these wars were popular; and on the triumphal entry of the Black Prince into London with the king of France, we are told that the citizens displayed with peculiar exultation from their windows and balconies, the implements and ornaments of war. 
<p>During the contest between the rival houses of York and Lancaster, the military defence of the capital became an object of great importance, and appears to have been duly appreciated. When the leaders of each party met in London in <datestruct value="1458--"><year reg="1458">1458</year></datestruct>, attended by a <pb id="p.320" n="320"> great number of their followers, in order to attempt a reconciliation, sir Godfrey Boleyn, the lord mayor, kept watch daily with a guard of <num value="5000">5,000</num> citizens completely armed; while <num value="3">three</num> aldermen, with another body of <num value="2000">2,000</num>, continued the watch during the night. 
<p>Henry VII. having been very partial to archery in his youth, gave it every encouragement when he ascended the throne, in preference to the cross bow, although he sometimes amused himself with it, as we find by the following memoranda, in an account of his expenditure preserved in the remembrancer's office. <QUOTE>Lost to my lord Morging, at the buttes, <measure value="6s." type=currency><num value="6">six</num> shillings</measure> and eightpence,</QUOTE> and <QUOTE>paid to sir Edward Boroughe, <measure value="13s." type=currency><num value="13">thirteen</num> shillings</measure> and fourpence, which the kynge lost at buttes with his cross bow.</QUOTE> From these entries it would appear that the king was not so skilful a bowman as his sons, particularly the eldest, prince Arthur, who frequently exercised with the society of London bowmen at Mile End, and was so expert, that the captain, and every expert shooter, was called by his name. 
<p>The military art still continued to be cultivated. At a general muster of <QUOTE>the most able men between the ages of <num value="16">sixteen</num> and <num value="60">sixty</num>,</QUOTE> which took place twice by order of Henry VIII. in <datestruct value="1532--"><year reg="1532">1532</year></datestruct>, and again on the <datestruct VALUE="1539-05-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1539">1539</year></datestruct>, when there appeared no less than <num value="15000">15,000</num>, <QUOTE>all in bright harness;</QUOTE>  <QUOTE>Most of the citizens of any quality or office,</QUOTE> Strype says, <QUOTE>were clad in white satin or white silk coats, with chains of gold, and some had rich jewels.</QUOTE> The king expressed himself highly pleased with their martial appearance. 
<p>From this period, archery fell into disuse, principally, no doubt, from the introduction of muskets. Hollinshed bewails, that in his time, we had <QUOTE>given over that kind of artillery,</QUOTE> the long bow, in which in times past, the chief force of England consisted; and bishop Latimer equally laments the change that had taken place. In his <num value="6">sixth</num> sermon, he says, <QUOTE>The art of shutynge hath been in times past much esteemed in this realme, it is a gyft of God, and he hath given us to excell all other nations wythall. It hath bene Godde's instrumente whereby he hath gyven us manye victories agaynste our enemyes.</QUOTE> He then points out the necessity of calling upon the justices, and charging them <QUOTE>upon their allegiance, that thys singular benefit of God may be practised.</QUOTE> That it had been practised, and that successfully, we learn by a fact recorded in the journal of Edward VI., which shows the force with which arrows were discharged. A <num value="100">hundred</num> archers belonging to the guard of this king shot at an inch board, singly, <num value="2">two</num> arrows each, when some of the arrows pierced through the board, and entered another placed behind it, although the wood was extremely hard. At what distance the arrows were discharged, does not appear, but Pere Daniel says, an ancient bow could carry <num value="400">four hundred</num> yards, or nearly a quarter of a mile. <pb id="p.321" n="321"> 
<p>A strong instance of the military character of the British in this reign is furnished by Etienne de Perlin, who, in a narrative of his tour through England in the year <datestruct value="1558"><year reg="1558">1558</year></datestruct>, speaking of the quarter sessions, says, <QUOTE>The servants carry pointed bucklers, even those of bishops and prelates, and the men commonly exercise them with the bow. The husbandmen, when they till the ground, leave their bucklers and swords, or sometimes their bow, in the corner of the field, so that in this land every body bears arms.</QUOTE> 
<p>In the <num value="2">second</num> year of Elizabeth's reign, there was a muster of the citizens before her majesty, and the French and imperial ambassadors in Greenwich park; but it seems from the comparatively small number assembled, to have consisted of some select companies only. There were <num value="1400">1,400</num> men, whereof <num value="800">800</num> were pikemen, all in fine corselets, <num value="400">400</num> harquebuts in shirts of mail with merins, and <num value="200">200</num> halberdiers in almayne rivets; they had to every <num value="100">hundred</num>, <num value="2">two</num> whifflers  <QUOTE>richly apparelled, and <num value="12">twelve</num> wardens of the best companies, riding in coats of black velvet, to conduct them, with drums and fifes, and <num value="6">six</num> ensigns, all in jerkins of white Bruges satin, cut and lined with black sarsnet, with caps, hozen, and scarfs according. The </QUOTE> <num value="6">six</num> ensigns' here mentioned, seem to denote that the city had thus early made that sextuple division of its forces into the regiments of the blue, green, yellow, orange, white, and red, which subsisted till the recent introduction of the militia system.<NOTE><BIBL>Percy Histories-London, vol. ii. p. <num value="189">189</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>When in the year <datestruct value="1572"><year reg="1572">1572</year></datestruct>, Elizabeth began to be disturbed in her government by machinations, foreign and domestic, she sent an order to the lord mayor, sheriffs, and aldermen, recommending to them renewed diligence in training up the young citizens to the use of arms for the defence of the capital; and particularly to the use of musketry, which was now beginning to supersede the bow and arrow. The order was obeyed with so much alacrity, that, within <num value="2">two</num> months after, a choice body of <num value="8000">8,000</num> pikemen and gunners, completely armed and disciplined, mustered before the queen in Greenwich park; and these were independently of the city archers who were estimated to amount to <num value="4000">4,000</num> more. 
<p>The preparation in the ports of Spain of the boasted Armada, which was to effect the conquest of England and the re-establishment of the catholic religion called for still greater exertions on the part of the loyal citizens of London. From a report of the arrangements made for the defence of the kingdom on that occasion, recently compiled from the records in the Tower, it appears, that London then contained <num value="20696">20,696</num> able householders within the wards, besides <num value="933">933</num> strangers fit for service; and that of this number, no less than <num value="10000">10,000</num> were actually embodied. 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1585"><year reg="1585">1585</year></datestruct>, the storm which had so long threatened the entire destruction of this kingdom assumed a formidable aspect; <pb id="p.322" n="322"> divers citizens of London, of great experience in military affairs, were by order of the government taken out of the artillery company, and, to their great honour, were appointed officers in several parts of the kingdom; by whose care and indefatigable application, the militia in most parts were put into a good state of defence. 
<p>The citizens of London the more effectually to prevent all sudden attempts that might be made by the enemies of government in favour of the Spaniards, in the year <datestruct value="1586"><year reg="1586">1586</year></datestruct>, drew up the following regulations, intituled,

<p>The lords of the council ordered Edmund York, a brave officer who had served in the Low Countries, to point out the best means of putting the city in a good state of defence; he recommended that it should be divided into sections, containing <datestruct value="1500--"><year reg="1500">1500</year></datestruct> men,  <QUOTE>all inhabitants, which shall be either the householder, his sonne, or continued servant.</QUOTE>  Every night, at <num value="6">six</num> o'clock, <num value="5">five</num> companies of different regiments were to assemble in the Exchange,  <QUOTE> and there stand in battell a quarter of an hour.</QUOTE>  After the countersign was given to every officer, says York,  <QUOTE>a prayer for her majesty's estate and kingdome, and the Lord's prayer, shall be said.</QUOTE>  <num value="5">Five</num> billets were next to be put into a hat, which the captains were to draw, to determine their respective stations for the night. 
<p>The queen placed so much reliance on the courage and attachment of the citizens, that she selected <num value="9000">9000</num> of them to be her body guard. The remaining <num value="1000">1,000</num> were sent to the grand camp at Tilbury Fort. 
<p>The usual place of training the city bands at this period, was the old Artillery garden or ground, the site of which is commemorated by the names of several streets and lanes on the east side of Bishopsgate-street, as Artillery-street, Artillery-lane, Fort-street, &amp;c. <num value="500">Five hundred</num> of the most expert, who had  <QUOTE> experience both abroad and at home,</QUOTE>  were selected to drill the rest, and we are told, that  <QUOTE>very sufficient and skilful they were to train and teach common soldiers the managing of their muskets, pikes, and halberds, march, counter-march, and ring.</QUOTE>  These masters of the art <pb id="p.325" n="325"> military formed a company by themselves, of which  <QUOTE> every man by turn bore orderly office, from the corporal to the captain.</QUOTE>  Some of these were sent to the camp at Tilbury, to assist in drilling the new levies, and were then known by the name of the captains of the Artillery garden. 
<p>The military ardour which the Spanish Armada called forth, was succeeded by a long period of inglorious ease. The whole of the city corps were disembodied, and the exercises in the Artillery garden entirely discontinued; so that, when the queen wanted an aid of men from the city, to send to the relief of Calais in <datestruct value="1596--"><year reg="1596">1596</year></datestruct>, she was obliged to resort to the mode of impressment, and that in a way not attempted perhaps either before or since. On the forenoon of Easter Monday, the lord mayor and aldermen received orders to provide instantly, for the queen's service, a <num value="1000">thousand</num> able bodied men. The day and hour were conveniently chosen; the churches, as is usual on this festival, were filled ; and thither the magistrates immediately repaired with their proper officers, made fast all the doors, and in a few minutes executed the required levy on the assembled congregations.  <QUOTE> The men were forthwith furnished with armour, weapons, and all things necessary,</QUOTE>  and marched off to Dover before night. This system of pressing, though not in the same indecorous manner, was afterwards repeatedly resorted to during the reign of Elizabeth. 
<p>A material change in the military exercises of the London citizens took place at the close of Elizabeth's reign, with which the use of the sword and buckler seems to have ended. Stowe relates that in his time,  <QUOTE> the art of defence and use of weapons was taught by professed masters,</QUOTE>  and that the young Londoners, after the evening prayer on holidays, were permitted to exercise themselves with their wafters and bucklers before their masters' doors. The wafters here mentioned, were swords with the flat part placed in the direction of the edge. Shakspeare and all the writers of his time mention schools for teaching the use of weapons as common in London; but when the alarm of outward danger had been dissipated, and the pusillanimous reign of James had commenced, military exercises were naturally discountenanced by a king, who had an instinctive horror at the sight of a naked sword; and who praised armour, rather because, as he said, it prevented the wearer from hurting others, than for the protection it gave him. 
<p>The danger which might arise from such an habitual neglect of military exercises, at length roused some patriotic individuals to exert themselves, to revive the ancient trainings in the Artillery garden. In <datestruct value="1610--"><year reg="1610">1610</year></datestruct>, Philip Hudson, lieutenant of the artillery company, and divers other gentlemen and citizens of London, considering the inconveniences which had been suffered by many  <QUOTE>late populous and flourishing neighbour cities, principally by reason of their neglect of that most noble exercise of arms and martiall discipline <pb id="p.326" n="326"> in times of wealth and peace; they, like loving sons to so glorious a city, </QUOTE> undertook,  <QUOTE>at their own private or particular charge, a weekly exercise of arms and military discipline after the modern and best fashion, and construction then in use ;</QUOTE>  and for their better ease and more convenience,  <QUOTE>they erected a strong and well furnished armory in the said ground, in which are arms of several sorts; and of such extraordinary fashion and goodness for service, as are hard to be matched elsewhere.</QUOTE>  
<p><num value="4">Four</num> years after, James I. commanded a general muster of all the horse and foot soldiers throughout England; and such was the progress which the citizens of London had by that time made in their military re-organization, that no less than <num value="6000">6000</num> of them assembled on the occasion. They were commanded by <num value="20">twenty</num> captains selected of the most active and forward citizens, and unto every <num value="1">one</num> of them were allotted <num value="300">300</num> shot and pikes, being, for the most part, all householders bravely furnished; and such of them as were not formerly of the Martial society, and practice of the Artillery garden, became then admitted of that warlike company. 
<p>During the disputes between the king and the parliament, in the time of Charles I. the regular forces of the city, which were, at that period, distinguished by the appellation of the Trained Bands, were <num value="1">first</num> embodied, or, as the phrase was, <QUOTE>drawn forth in arms</QUOTE> on the side of the monarch; yet in the subsequent war, the citizens supported the popular cause, and it was principally by their aid that the house of commons obtained its decided preponderancy. So early as <datestruct VALUE="1642-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct>, within <num value="3">three</num> months after Charles had erected his standard at Nottingham, the trained bands were marched out to join the earl of Essex, on  <QUOTE> the heath near Brentford,</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>where,</QUOTE>  says Clarendon,  <QUOTE> they had indeed a full army of horse and foot, fit to have decided the title of a crown with an equal adversary.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Hist. of the Reb. Vol. ii. p, <num value="75">75</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> In the further progress of the war, several auxiliary regiments, both of foot and horse, were raised by the city; and, to a part of these forces, joined to <num value="2">two</num> regiments of the trained bands,  <QUOTE>of whose inexperience of danger,</QUOTE>  remarks the historian just quoted,  <QUOTE>or any kind of service beyond the easy practice of their postures in the Artillery garden, men had till then too cheap an estimation;</QUOTE>  the parliament army was indebted for its preservation in the <num value="1">first</num> battle of Newbury,  <QUOTE>for they stood as a bulwark and rampire to defend the rest; and when their wings of horse were scattered and dispersed, kept their ground so steadily,</QUOTE>  that prince Rupert himself, who charged them at the head of the choice royal horse,  <QUOTE>could make no impression upon their stand of pikes, but was forced to wheel about.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Ibid. p. <num value="347">347</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> The same noble historian designates London, as  <QUOTE>the devoted city</QUOTE>  of the commons, and their  <QUOTE>inexhaustible magazine of men.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Ibid. p. <num value="348">348</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 <pb id="p.327" n="327"> 
<p>In the subsequent affair at Cheriton Downs, the citizens acquired fresh laurels. <num value="2">Two</num> of their strongest auxiliary regiments fought under sir William Waller, on that occasion, and, as Whitelock tells us,  <QUOTE> did very brave service; they drove the enemy from the hedges, which they had lined with musketeers, and gained the passage to a wood, which stood the parliamentary forces in great stead, and shortly after put the enemy to a rout; which was so total, that scarcely <num value="10">ten</num> of them were left together.</QUOTE>  
<p>The city shortly after increased the number of troops they had in the field against the king to <num value="8400">8,400</num>; <num value="4">four</num> regiments were under the earl of Essex, and <num value="3">three</num> under sir William Waller. 
<p>The Londoners continued foremost in the struggle between the crown and the people, till the success of the latter was complete; but when the parliament and the army quarrelled, and Cromwell rose on the bucklers of the latter to supreme power, they fell into the back ground, and suffered but too many affronts and hardships at the hands of those, whom they had been the principal means of placing in the seat of royalty. The works about the city were ordered to be demolished ; the trained bands were discharged; the treasuries of different city companies were robbed, in order to pay arrears due to Cromwell's soldiers; particularly that of the Weaver's company, from which <measure value="2000l." type=currency><num value="2000">20,00</num>l.</measure> were carried off; and when these were found insufficient for the purpose, bands of these satellites were quartered on the city, not only in the inns, but in private houses, till the deficiency was made up. 
<p>During the quarrel between the army and the parliament, the services of the London trained bands were frequently called on to suppress those tumults which are common to a state of anarchy; nor were those of a political nature the most dangerous to the existing government. In <datestruct VALUE="1648-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct>, a riot was begun in Moorfields, on account of the infraction of the parliamentary ordinance against tippling and gaming on the Sabbath, which required all the energy of Fairfax to suppress. The <num value="1">first</num> party of the trained bands sent to quell the tumult were overpowered by the rioters, who seized their arms, drums, and colours, and daringly beat up for recruits. The prisons of Newgate and Ludgate were surprised during the night; and next day they attempted to seize Whitehall, but were repelled by the soldiers. They, however, were more successful in the city, where they attacked the Mansion-house, and carried off a piece of artillery, called a drake. Ammunition was obtained from the magazine, in Leadenhall-street, where they made a stand against the only <num value="2">two</num> regiments then in London, nor did they give way until several of them were wounded, and others taken prisoners.<NOTE><BIBL>Percy Histories-London, ii. p. <num value="199">199</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 <pb id="p.328" n="328"> 
<p>In <datestruct VALUE="1660-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, about <num value="6">six</num> weeks before the restoration of Charles the <num value="2">Second</num>, and when the artful management of general Monk had disposed the citizens to countenance the measures he was pursuing in favour of royalty, a muster of the city forces was held in Hyde Park, and the number of men then assembled amounted to about <num value="18600">18,600</num>; viz. <num value="6">six</num> regiments of trained bands, <num value="6">six</num> auxiliary regiments, and <num value="1">one</num> regiment of horse: the foot regiments were composed of <num value="80">eighty</num> companies of <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num> men each, and the regiments of cavalry of <num value="6">six</num> troops, each of <num value="100">one hundred</num> men. The assembling of this force was judged to have been highly instrumental to the success of the plan for restoring the monarchy. 
<p>Within a few months afterwards, the king granted a commission of lieutenancy for the city of London, which invested the commissioners with similar powers to those possessed by the lords lieutenants of counties; and by them the trained bands were new-modelled, and increased to <num value="20000">20,000</num> men; the cavalry was also increased to <num value="800">800</num>, and divided into <num value="2">two</num> regiments of <num value="5">five</num> troops, with <num value="80">eighty</num> men in each. The whole of this force was, in the same year, reviewed by the king in Hyde Park.<NOTE><BIBL>Strype's Stow, ii. p. <num value="572">572</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>After the state of public affairs had become more composed, and the better stability of the government ensured, the <num value="6">six</num> auxiliary regiments, and the regiments of horse, were reduced, and the permanent military force of the city was settled in the <num value="6">six</num> trained bands. These regiments consisted of citizens and freemen, and each was composed of <num value="8">eight</num> companies: their entire effective strength, in <datestruct value="1728--"><year reg="1728">1728</year></datestruct>, as given by Maitland from the muster rolls, was as follows :

<p>The rebellion of <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct> again roused the military spirit of the metropolis: the trained bands were kept in readiness, and the militia embodied; <num value="2">two</num> regiments were raised at the expence of the merchants, and corps of volunteers incorporated. The lawyers exchanged their briefs for muskets, and the judges their wigs for helmets; the weavers of Spitalfields laid aside their shuttle and distaff for the pike and the bayonet; and even the managers of the theatres offered to form a corps of  <QUOTE>his majesty's servants,</QUOTE>  ready to quit the mimic combats of the stage for the tented field. Large subscriptions were raised for supplying the troops with the necessary clothing and the munitions of war, towards which the corporation of the city gave <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num>l.</measure> and several of the city companies contributed liberally. Even the Quakers so far overcame their religious scruples, as to raise a considerable sum for the purchase of woollen waistcoats for the soldiers; and had the danger been more imminent, it is probable they might have been induced to go farther, and, like the Quakers of America at the commencement of the revolution, have subscribed for gunpowder, under the equivocal denomination of grain, or for muskets, under the name of fire irons.<NOTE><BIBL>Percy Histories-London, vol. ii. p. <num value="202">202</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The approach of the rebels to Derby increased preparations in the metropolis: the city gates were guarded; and a large train of artillery was sent from the Tower to a camp formed on Finchley-common.<NOTE> This circumstance gave rise to Hogarth's admirable picture,  <QUOTE>The March to Finchley,</QUOTE>  for which he sought the royal patronage; but the king, who saw nothing in the picture but that his soldiers were ridiculed, expressed great displeasure; and the print was dedicated to the king of Prussia.</NOTE>
 
<p>The continued tranquillity of the capital in the times subsequent to the above period, having rendered any call on the military power of the city unnecessary, excepting for mere holiday <pb id="p.330" n="330"> purposes, the trained bands were gradually disorganized, though they were still nominally kept up, and the commissions filled by the chief citizens; each regiment having an alderman for its colonel, who also was usually a knight. After the breaking out of the revolution in France, however, and the strong demonstrations made by that country to invade England, the extreme insufficiency of such a force for any adequate resistance became so apparent, that a new system was resorted to, and in the year <datestruct value="1794"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>, an act of parliament was passed for raising <num value="2">two</num> regiments of militia for the defence of the city, to be trained and exercised under the superintendance of the commissioners of lieutenancy. By that act the men were proposed to be raised by ballot, in the following manner: that every person or corporation within the city, possessed of a tenement of the annual value of <measure value="15l." type=currency><num value="15">15</num>l.</measure> and less than <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">100</num>l.</measure> and under <measure value="200l." type=currency><num value="200">200</num>l.</measure> to find <num value="2">two</num> men as substitutes; and if it exceeded the latter sum to supply <num value="3">three</num> substitutes. 
<p>This mode of raising the men by ballot having been found on trial to be attended with many inconveniences, another act was passed in <datestruct VALUE="1796-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>, by which it was enacted that <datestruct value="1200--"><year reg="1200">1200</year></datestruct> men (exclusive of officers) should be raised within the city and its liberties, to be formed into <num value="2">two</num> regiments, each consisting of <num value="8">eight</num> companies, besides a grenadier and a light infantry company; the expences to be defrayed by an equal assessment upon the different wards. 
<p>Under the above act, the numbers raised and maintained by the respective wards are as follow: for the East regiment, Algate ward, <num value="60">60</num>; Bassishaw, <num value="12">12</num>; Billingsgate, <num value="41">41</num>; Bishopsgate-within, <num value="44">44</num>; Bishopsgate-without, <num value="50">50</num>; Bridge, <num value="26">26</num>; Broad-street, <num value="60">60</num>; Candlewick, <num value="20">20</num>; Coleman-street, <num value="36">36</num>; Cornhill, <num value="36">36</num>; Dowgate, <num value="27">27</num>; Langbourn, <num value="67">67</num>; Lime-street, <num value="20">20</num>; Portsoken, <num value="45">45</num>; Tower, <num value="66">66</num>; total <num value="600">600</num>.

All <pb id="p.331" n="331"> the officers above the rank of lieutenants must be freemen; but the sons of freemen are eligible to the offices of lieutenant and ensign. When embodied for service, his majesty is authorized to put <num value="1">one</num> regiment under the command of such general officer as he may appoint, and to direct it to march to any place not exceeding <num value="12">twelve</num> miles from the city, or to the nearest encampment beyond that distance; but the other is to remain within the city or its liberties, to defend the same. By an express enactment it is also declared,  <QUOTE>the said militia shall possess and enjoy all and singular the rights and privileges which were possessed and enjoyed by the ancient trained bands of the city of London.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Brayley's Hist. of London, ii. <num value="178">178</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The volunteer regiments had their origin during the late destructive war; and were chiefly formed in the year <datestruct value="1798"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, when the repeated threats of invasion from France, conjoined with other circumstances, rendered it expedient to increase the military force in every part of the kingdom. The primary associations consisted of inhabitant householders of each ward, acting under the general superintendence of local committees, and eventually liable to be united into <num value="1">one</num> body, and placed under the direction of the lord mayor and court of aldermen. In the subsequent arrangements made in <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, other persons, not citizens, nor inhabitants, but residing contiguous to the city, were permitted to associate; and the whole of the infantry was then distributed into <num value="11">eleven</num> regiments, having authority to elect their own officers, and generally speaking, defraying all the expences of arms, accoutrements, &amp;c. out of their own subscriptions, aided by some inconsiderable funds collected in the different wards. The city volunteer cavalry, which never exceeded <num value="160">one hundred and sixty</num>, was formed into <num value="1">one</num> regiment. 
<p>Whilst the alarm of invasion continued to exist, the volunteers exhibited a most commendable activity in assembling at their respective quarters, and they very quickly attained an advanced degree of discipline; but when the course of continental affairs had assumed another direction, the attendance of individuals was gradually lessened, and, with little exception, the city volunteers are at present in a dormant state, so far as regards military concerns. The returns of late, have not been regular; yet should the presumed necessity again arrive, there cannot be a doubt but that these regiments will attain as great a degree of effective strength as at any former period. In the returns laid before the house of commons in <datestruct VALUE="1806-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, after the general inspection of the volunteer force of Great Britain made in the preceding month, the numbers of each regiment are stated thus: <pb id="p.332" n="332">

<p>In addition to the above forces, there were several other volunteer regiments of infantry, raised for the purpose of protecting the immense property of different corporate bodies within the city; as well under circumstances of internal commotion, as in case of invasion. 
<div2 type=section id="c.12.1"><HEAD>The Honourable Artillery Company.</HEAD>
 
<p>The artillery company of London had its origin in the reign of Henry VIII. This monarch, who was fond of archery, and saw with much pleasure that it was a favourite exercise with the citizens, thought that if the archers were organized into a regular company, they might be rendered much more effective. With this view, and in order to encourage archery, he issued his royal letters patent for the formation of the honourable artillery company. 
<p>This royal ordinance, which is dated the <datestruct VALUE="1537-08-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1537">1537</year></datestruct>, grants to  <QUOTE> Sir Crystofer Morres, knt. master of the ordnance, Anthony Knevett and Peter Mewtes, gentlemen of the privy chamber, and overseers of the fraternity or guild of St. George, that they shall be overseers of the science of artillery, namely, of long bows, cross-bows, and hand guns; and that the said Sir Crystofer Morres, Cornelys Johnson, Anthony Knevett, and Henry Johnson, shall be masters and rulers of the said science of artillery, during their lives.</QUOTE>  The patent grants authority to them and their successors, being Englishmen or denizens,  <QUOTE> to begyn, founde, edefye, make, ordeygn, gadre, knytte, and establyshe, a certeyn perpetuall fraternytye of Saint George.</QUOTE>  Power was given <pb id="p.333" n="333"> them to admit all manner of honest persons, strangers as well as others, into a body corporate, having perpertual succession, by the name of the  <QUOTE> maysters, and rulers, and commynaltye, of the fraternytye or guylde of artyllary, of long bowes, cross bowes, and hand gonnes.</QUOTE>  The society might elect <num value="4">four</num> under masters or rulers, either English or strangers, of good character, to oversee and govern the company, and to have the custody of their property, real and personal, and had the usual power granted to corporations, that of purchasing lands and using a common seal, with some peculiar privileges. 
<p>The fraternity was empowered to form their own laws for their governance, and change them at their pleasure. They were authorized to exercise themselves with shooting at all manner of marks and butts, and at the game of the popynjaye, an artificial parrot, frequently set up as a mark to be shot at; nor did their privileges terminate here. The fraternity of St. George had a full letterof licence to shoot at the fowl or fowls in the city of London and its suburbs, and in all other places in England, Ireland, Calais, and the marches of Wales, with the exception of the royal forests, chases, and parks. They were also precluded from shooting at herons and pheasants, within a circuit of <num value="2">two</num> miles of the royal residence for the time being. 
<p>The privileges of this fraternity afforded a great protection for bad marksmen, for if any of them, shooting at a known and accustomed butt, should kill any passenger, he should not be impeached, or troubled for it, if he had, previous to his shooting, spoken the usual word  <QUOTE>Fast.</QUOTE>  
<p>The fraternity were exempted from the usual laws for regulating costume, and might use any sort of embroidery, or any cognizance of silver they should think properon their gowns and jackets, coats, or doublets, and to use them in any kind of silk or velvet, satin or damask, of any colour except scarlet and purple; all sorts of furs, not above that of martyns, were also free for their use. The masters and wardens were exempted from serving on any inquest within the city of London, or any where else within the realm, their servants were allowed to carry their weapons, but were deprived of the privilege of their masters, that of shooting at the fowl. 
<p>The old Artillery-ground, which, in the time of the Romans, was their <hi rend=italics>Campus Martius</hi>, and had long been used by the London archers to exercise their skill in arms, had become a part of the land attached to the convent of St. Mary Spital, and on the suppression of the monasteries, William Major, the last prior, on <datestruct VALUE="1530-01-3"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=3>3</day>, <year reg=1530>1530</year></datestruct>, leased it to the  <QUOTE>fraternity of artillery in great and small ordnance,</QUOTE>  (or gunners of the Tower,) who erected a mound of earth for a butt, and every Thursday practised in firing brass cannon. 
<p><num value="1">One</num> of the most important advantages derived from the <pb id="p.334" n="334"> establishment of the artillery company, was, that it formed a sort of school where military exercises were taught. 
<p>Stow says, <QUOTE>About <num value="3">three</num> years before, (<datestruct value="1586--"><year reg="1586">1586</year></datestruct>) certaine gallant, active, and forward citizens, having had experience both abroad and at home, voluntarily exercised themselves, and trayned uppe others, for the ready use of warre, so as within <num value="2">two</num> years there was almost <num value="3">three</num> hundreth marchants, and others of like quality, very sufficient and skilfull to traine and teach common souldiers the managing of their peeces, pikes, and holbards, to march, countermarch, and ring; which said marchants, for their owne perfection in military affayres and discipline, met every Tuesday in the year, practicing all usuall poynts of warre, and every man by turn bare orderly office, from the corporal to the captain; some of them this yeare had charge of men in the great Campe [at Tilbury] and were generally called  <Q>captaines of the Artillery Garden.</Q> </QUOTE> The whole number of soldiers funished by the city to repel the invasion in <datestruct value="1588--"><year reg="1588">1588</year></datestruct> was <num value="10000">10,000</num>; and it is somewhat remarkable, that <num value="9">nine</num>-tenths of that body, together with <num value="1000">1,000</num> men that had been supplied by the county, were all included in the army appointed to guard her majesty's person; the other <num value="1000">1,000</num> of the city troops were sent to the camp at Tilbury. 
<p>In the subsequent reign, the Artillery-ground became still more a military academy, where an armoury was erected,<NOTE>Towards this, the chamber of London gave them <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure>.</NOTE> in which <num value="500">five hundred</num> stand of arms of beautiful workmanship were deposited, which were all lost, during the civil wars. Their captain, during a part of those affrighted times, was a Mr. Manby, who irrecoverably detained, for his own purposes, the arms, plate, money, books, and other goods of the company. The protector was in vain solicited to enforce their being restored.<NOTE><BIBL>Ellis's History of Shoreditch, p. <num value="349">349</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> Citizens unconnected with the artillery company, repaired to this place, to learn how to defend themselves and their country: and several country gentlemen, as already stated, here learnt the <num value="1">first</num> rudiments of the military art, in order to qualify themselves to train the levies in the country. 
<p>The artillery company, though acting under a patent of Henry the <num value="8">Eighth</num>, had now become more regularly incorporated by a charter of James the <num value="1">First</num>, dated the <datestruct VALUE="1606-02-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1606">1606</year></datestruct>, in which he states, that the artillery company  <QUOTE>had not only bred and increased a great force and strength, towards the maintenance, defence and safety of the realm,</QUOTE>  but also  <QUOTE> a fear and terror to all other realms and foreign enemies, in times of war and hostility.</QUOTE>  
<p>The principal object of the charter of king James, was to protect to the company the free exercise of arms, in the grounds appointed for that purpose, which had been invaded, and even the shooting <pb id="p.335" n="335"> marks removed. A commission was therefore appointed to inquire into the subject, and to give to the company the privileges they had formerly enjoyed. The charter of James was long enforced, even so late as the year <datestruct value="1746"><year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct> it was in operation, when a cowkeeper of the name of Pitfield, who had removed <num value="1">one</num> of the shooting marks, was compelled to replace it; and the company, in order to perpetuate the circumstance, had  <QUOTE>Pitfield's Repentance</QUOTE>  inscribed on the stone. 
<p>When the Artillery Garden was found too small for exercising the numerous bands of citizens who resorted there, a plot of ground was selected near Moorfields, which Mr Leate, <num value="1">one</num> of the officers of the company, prepared for the purpose; and towards the close of the reign of James <num value="1">1</num>. it was determined that the artillery company, which now amounted to <num value="6000">6,000</num> men, should remove to the New Artillery-garden, as it was called, and now known by the name of the Artillery-ground, where the company have for <num value="2">two</num> centuries mustered. 
<p>Charles <num value="1">1</num>. who in his youth had frequently honoured the artillery-company with joining in its exercises, appointed a commission, in <datestruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>, similar to that of his father, which was to prevent the fields from being so inclosed as to interrupt the  <QUOTE>necessary and profitable exercise of shooting.</QUOTE>  
<p>The corporation of the city of London seconded the patronage of his majesty; and in <datestruct value="1638--"><year reg="1638">1638</year></datestruct>, after the artillery company had performed their exercises in Merchant-taylors' hall, before the lord mayor and aldermen, presented them with the Artillery-ground, as a field for their exercise; to which, <num value="2">two</num> years afterwards, was added, on a long lease, for the rent of <num value="6">six</num> and eightpence, <num value="11">eleven</num> acres of Bunhill Field. 
<p>Charles, whose early attachment to the company never forsook him, caused his sons to become members; and, in <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>, the prince of Wales and duke of York, together with the count Palatine, enlisted into the honourable artillery company, without assuming any share of its government. 
<p>During the civil wars, the artillery company was much disorganized; but on a petition to Cromwell, in <datestruct value="1655--"><year reg="1655">1655</year></datestruct>, it was revived, and for several years a festival was held at <num value="1">one</num> of the city halls, to celebrate its restoration. On these occasions the company had a field day, and then marched in procession to St. Paul's cathedral, where divine service was performed, and a sermon preached. These field days and festivals were kept up after the restoration, and frequently attended by the duke of York, who, in <datestruct value="1644--"><year reg="1644">1644</year></datestruct>, was appointed captain-general of the company. 
<p>The Artillery Company was frequently augmented, and sometimes large numbers of the trained bands, the city auxiliaries, and the Tower-hamlets militia, were admitted without paying any fine; the society of archers was incorporated with the archers' division of the artillery company. <pb id="p.336" n="336"> 
<p>In the political dissensions which took place during the latter part of the reign of Charles <num value="1">1</num>. and the reign of James II. the artillery company could not entirely keep aloof, but they refused to abet the arbitrary designs of the monarch, and maintained the honour of the corps. 
<p>During the reign of William III. this company declined considerably, although the king honoured them with filling the office of captain-general himself; but the clamour at that time raised against standing armies, made the party even jealous of the artillery company. 
<p>From this period they have always enjoyed the favour of the sovereign, from their unshaken loyalty, and alacrity in lending their services on all occasions. His late majesty manifested a strong partiality to the company, and in <datestruct value="1786--"><year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct> ordered the commissioned officers of the trained bands to be incorporated with it, appointing at the same time the young prince of Wales captain-general, a rank which his majesty still continues to hold. 
<p>In all the momentary ebullitions of popular feeling during the late reign, the hon. artillery company were always found at their post, ready to maintain the peace of the metropolis; and although some misunderstanding at <num value="1">one</num> time occurred with the London militia, relative to the right of the latter to exercise in the Artillery-ground, yet it was soon settled by an honourable arrangement. In all the military preparations which have been noticed in a preceding article, the hon. artillery company took the lead; and in all reviews of volunteers by his majesty or his staff officers, the company takes the <num value="1">first</num> place on the right of the line. 
<p>The honourable artillery company is governed by a court of assistants, consisting of a president, vice-president, treasurer, colonel, lieutenant-colonel, and major; the lord mayor, aldermen, and sheriffs, for the time being, with <num value="24">twenty-four</num> elective assistants. 
<p>The company possesses the power of censuring, fining, or expelling members for gaming, swearing, being refractory, or for any offence which may be deemed derogatory to their character as citizens and soldiers. A register is kept of the acts and proceedings of the company; and the <num value="1">first</num> entry on record of a member being expelled is that of <num value="1">one</num> James Coney, for the singular and  <QUOTE>unmanly action of biting off his wife's nose.</QUOTE>  
<p>The costume of the artillery company has frequently varied, as well as their armour; but until the last <num value="40">forty</num> years the pioneers carried a singular weapon, which it is probable was used by them from their <num value="1">first</num> establishment, and much resembled the  <QUOTE> morning star,</QUOTE>  which was much in use in Italy and in Wales in the <num value="11">eleventh</num> century. 
<p>This company, at present, forms a regular battalion of infantry, consisting of a grenadier, light infantry, and hat divisions; <pb id="p.337" n="337"> together with the matross division for the use of <num value="2">two</num> field pieces, presented in the year <datestruct value="1780"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, by the city.

<div1 type=chapter id="c.13" n="13"><HEAD>An Account of the <num value="12">twelve</num> principal Companies of the City of London.</HEAD>
 
<p>The city of London, like many other corporate towns at the present day, had originally but <num value="1">one</num> collective trading company or fraternity, called the <foreign lang=la>guilda mercatoria</foreign>; but when the population increased, and trades became more numerous, the citizens began to associate in distinct companies, according to their respective occupations, and to seek charters of incorporation and protection for the purpose of excluding non-freemen from exercising the same trade within the precincts of the city. 
<p>Merchant guilds do not appear to have been known to the Anglo Saxons, nor does it appear very certain that they were introduced into this country on the arrival of the Normans, although it is extremely probable that this was the case. The <num value="1">first</num> mention we find of a guild or fraternity of tradesmen occurs in a record in the Exchequer, during the reign of Henry I. in which a sum of <measure value="16l." type=currency><num value="16">sixteen</num> pounds</measure> is entered as having been paid by Robert the son of Leuestan, as the rent or ferme for the guild of weavers of London.<NOTE><BIBL>Madox. Fir Bur. p. <num value="191">191</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> It is probable that the various fraternities were now rapidly augmenting by royal privilege. The oldest patents or charters of incorporation, however, that have been preserved, are those of the skinners and goldsmiths, which were granted by Edward III. in the year <datestruct value="1327"><year reg="1327">1327</year></datestruct>. Several fictitious or self-constituted guilds had, however, been set up a century and a half before this time, but being without the royal licence they were fined. Indeed, so early <pb id="p.338" n="338"> as the year <datestruct value="1180"><year reg="1180">1180</year></datestruct>, we find <num value="16">sixteen</num> of these <hi rend=italics>adulterine</hi> guilds as they were called, fined by Henry II. in various sums of from <measure value="1bmark" type=currency><num value="1">one</num> mark</measure> to <measure value="45bmark" type=currency><num value="45">forty-five</num> marks</measure> each.<NOTE>See <BIBL>vol. i. p. <num value="61">61</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 The city companies, though branches of the general corporation, have each a distinct government and peculiar liberties and immunities granted to them by their respective charters. Most of the companies have separate halls for their place of meeting, either to transact business or for their banquets. Each company has a master, or prime warden, wardens, assistants, clerks, and other subordinate officers, for the general management and government of its affairs. The following are the names of all the companies arranged in their order of precedency.

<p>The Mercers' Company existed by prescription long previous to its regular incorporation, which did not take place till the year <datestruct value="1393"><year reg="1393">1393</year></datestruct> (<num value="17">17th</num> of Richard II.) when the members received their charter under the title of  <QUOTE> the wardens and commonalty of the mystery of the mercers of the city of London,</QUOTE>  and were empowered to purchase lands in mortmain to the value of <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> pounds</measure> annually. The company was affluent at that period, and its property has continued to accumulate to the present time, through the various grants, donations, trusts, &amp;c. that have been progressively made to it, or otherwise committed to the guidance of its members. This increase, however, has not taken place without some intervention, particularly during a considerable part of the last century, when the company's affairs were much involved, through the members having engaged about the end of the year <datestruct value="1698"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>, in a scheme <pb id="p.340" n="340"> of granting annuities, for the benefit of widows, which had been at <num value="1">first</num> suggested by the rev. William Asheton, D. D. rector of Beckenham in Kent. For every <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">100</num>l.</measure> subscribed, the annuitants were to receive <measure value="30l." type=currency><num value="30">30</num>l.</measure> during life; yet that sum having been found too large, it was lowered at different times to <measure value="25l." type=currency><num value="25">25</num>l.</measure> <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">20</num>l.</measure> and <measure value="15l." type=currency><num value="15">15</num>l.</measure> per annum, but the payments were still so numerous, that the company was at last obliged to make a complete stop in <datestruct VALUE="1745-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct>; its bond and other debts, then amounting to about <measure value="87000l." type=currency><num value="87000">87,000</num>l.</measure> besides the annual charge of <measure value="510l." type=currency><num value="510">510</num>l.</measure> <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>s.</measure> on account of legacies for charitable purposes. Parliamentary aid was afterwards obtained for the relief of the annuitants, and the rents and profits of the company's estates having much increased, a new act was passed in <datestruct value="1764--"><year reg="1764">1764</year></datestruct>, empowering the company to consolidate their debts (which made together <measure value="146687l. 5s. 3d." type=Currency><num value="146687">146,687</num>l. <num value="5">5</num>s. <num value="3">3</num>d.</measure>) into <num value="1">one</num> sum, subject to <num value="31">31</num>. per cent. interest per annum; to issue new bonds of <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">100</num>l.</measure> or under; and to draw a lottery in their own hall, for the progressive payment of the said bonds, whenever there was a surplus of <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num>l.</measure> or upwards. Since that period, the company's affairs have become so flourishing, partly through the great increase in the value of estates, and partly in consequence of the deaths of all the annuitants, that for many years they have gone on drawing their lottery about a week before Christmas--and since the year <datestruct value="1796"><year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>, have annually paid off bonds amounting to the sum of <measure value="7000l." type=currency><num value="7000">7,000</num>l.</measure> or more.<NOTE><BIBL>Mal. Lond. Red. vol. iv. p. <num value="543">543</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> The present clear income of the company is stated to exceed <measure value="8000l." type=currency><num value="8000">8,000</num>l.</measure> annually; and independent of this sum, it is said to distribute upwards of <measure value="3000l." type=currency><num value="3000">3,000</num>l.</measure> every year, for purposes of benevolence and charity. 
<p>The mercers are recorded to have been seated near the spot where their present hall and chapel stand, in Cheapside, as early as the period of the <num value="1">first</num> introduction of their trade into this kingdom, and their congregated dwellings were, in former ages, distinguished by the general appellation of The Mercery. About the centre of this cluster stood the house of Gilbert Becket, a citizen of London, and most probably a mercer, who was father to the celebrated Thomas Becket, archbishop of Canterbury, and whose wife Matilda, the mother of Thomas, was, according to traditionary lore, a fair Saracen, the daughter of a Pagan prince, to whose custody Gilbert had been assigned, after having been made prisoner when travelling in the Holy Land. The legend states, that after a confinement of a year and a half, he effected an escape by the assistance of Matilda, who had fallen in love with him, and been converted to Christianity by his persuasions. She next, urged on by unconquerable affection, deserted her friends, and followed him home to England, where finding him in London, she was married to him, and had issue Thomas, the archbishop, (afterwards called Thomas of Acons, or Acres, the ancient Ptolemais, from the presumed birth-place of his <pb id="p.341" n="341"> mother,) and a daughter named Agnes. The latter was married to Thomas Fitz-Theobald de Heili, or Helles, who, within a few years after the assassination of Becket, founded, in conjunction with his wife, a chapel and hospital, upon the very spot where the dwelling of Becket's father had stood, and where the archbishop himself was born. 
<p>In the times of Catholic superstition, it was customary for the new lord mayor, on the afternoon of the day when sworn in at the Exchequer, to meet the aldermen, and go from this hospital in solemn procession to St. Paul's Cathedral, whence, having prayed for the soul of the Norman bishop, William, they proceeded to the grave and chapel of Becket's parents in the church-yard, and there prayed for  <QUOTE> all faithful souls departed ;</QUOTE>  after which they returned to the hospital of St. Thomas of Acons, where the mayor and aldermen each offered  <QUOTE> <num value="1">one</num> penny.</QUOTE>  
<p>On the suppression of the hospital, in the <num value="13">13th</num> of Henry VIII. its annual expenditure was stated at <measure value="277l. 3s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="277">277</num>l. <num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> About <num value="3">three</num> years afterwards, it was granted, under the appellation of the  <QUOTE>College of Acon,</QUOTE>  to the Mercers' company, together with sundry premises in the neighbourhood, and was again  <QUOTE> set open,</QUOTE>  says Stow, (who also states, that the mercers purchased it through the means of sir Richard Gresham)  <QUOTE> the eve of St. Michael, <datestruct value="1541--"><year reg="1541">1541</year></datestruct>. It is now called the Mercers' chappel, and therein is kept a free grammar school as of olde time had been accustomed, and had been commanded by parliament: there is also a preaching in the Italian tongue, to the Italians and others, on the Sundaies.</QUOTE> <NOTE>It was in the Mercers' chapel that Marc Antonio de Dominis, archbishop of Spalatro, who came to England in the reign of James I. preached his <num value="1">first</num> sermon in <datestruct value="1617--"><year reg="1617">1617</year></datestruct>, in Italian, before the archbishop of Canterbury, and a splendid audience, after his conversion to the Protestant religion; and he also continued his discourses in the same place. The king gave him the deanery of Windsor, the mastership of Savoy, and the rich living of West Ildesley in Berkshire; but he afterwards returned to Italy, where, notwithstanding his relapse to the church of Rome, he was imprisoned by the inquisition, and died in confinement in <datestruct value="1625--"><year reg="1625">1625</year></datestruct>, in the <num value="64">64th</num> year of his age. Granger says, we are indebted to him for father Paul's excellent  <QUOTE>History of the Council of Trent,</QUOTE>  the manuscript of which he procured for archbishop Abbott; and that he was the <num value="1">first</num> that accounted for the phaenomena of the rainbow, in his book <title lang=la>de Radiis Visus et Lucis</title>.</NOTE>
 
<p>In the hall, not only the ordinary business of the company is transacted, but the meetings also of the Gresham committee are regularly held. This committee, to whom the important trusts attendant on the magnificent bounties of sir Thomas Gresham are delegated, consists of <num value="4">four</num> aldermen (of whom the lord mayor for the time being is constantly <num value="1">one</num>) and <num value="8">eight</num> other members of the corporation of London, with whom, for this purpose, are associated a select number of the court of assistants of the mercers' company. 
<p>In the long list of members whose names have been enrolled in this fraternity, are included various sovereigns and other princes, a great number of nobility and gentry, and upwards of <num value="80">eighty</num> lord <pb id="p.342" n="342"> mayors. In regard to the latter, it was formerly the custom, whenever any member of this company was elected to the civic chair, says Stow, that  <QUOTE>a most beautiful virgin is carried through the streets in a chariot in all the majesty and glory possible, with her hair all dishevelled about her shoulders; to represent the maidenhead which the company give for their arms. And this lady is plentifully gratified for her pains, besides the gift of all the rich attire she wears.</QUOTE>  
<p>Such a pageant formed part of the procession in the year <datestruct value="1701"><year reg="1701">1701</year></datestruct>, when sir William Gore came into the important office of lord mayor, and is said to have been of remote origin; but whether displayed in allusion to the  <QUOTE> Blessed Virgin,</QUOTE>  the chosen patroness of the company, or to the  <QUOTE> maiden's head,</QUOTE>  which constitutes the company's arms, is not exactly known. 
<p>Among many eminent men that have been masters of this company, occur sir Richard Whittington, mayor in <datestruct value="1397--"><year reg="1397">1397</year></datestruct>, <datestruct value="1406--"><year reg="1406">1406</year></datestruct>, and <datestruct value="1419--"><year reg="1419">1419</year></datestruct>; he founded the college that bears his name. Sir Godfrey Boleyn, ancestor of queen Anne Boleyn, the mother of queen Elizabeth. Sir Henry Colet, the father of Dr. Colet, dean of St. Paul's, and founder of St. Paul's school. Sir John Allen, <num value="1">one</num> of the privy council, and mayor in <datestruct value="1525--"><year reg="1525">1525</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1535--"><year reg="1535">1535</year></datestruct>; and sir Richard Gresham, the father of the founder of the Royal Exchange and Gresham college. 
<p>This company consists of a principal,<NOTE>The list of the masters of this company is printed at length in <BIBL>Strype's Stow, vol. ii. ed. <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, p. <num value="175">175</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> and <num value="3">three</num> other wardens, a court of assistants, and a livery, altogether forming a body of about <num value="110">110</num> members; yet it is a singular fact, that there is not a single person of the profession which gives name to the company, at present belonging to it. Besides having the general management of St. Paul's school, this company supports another seminary, called the mercers' school, which originated in the petition to parliament of <num value="4">four</num> benevolent clergymen, in the <num value="25">25th</num> of Henry the <num value="6">Sixth</num>, <num value="1">one</num> of whom, John Neel, or Neil, was master of the hospital of St. Thomas of Acres, and the same who petitioned for the incorporation of the brethren, as mentioned above.<NOTE><BIBL>See p. <num value="159">159</num>, vol. i.</BIBL></NOTE> This was the grammar school noticed by Stow, it having been continued by the mercers' company after purchase of the suppressed hospital. For many years it was kept in the Old Jewry, but it has recently been removed to College-hill, Upper Thames-street. <num value="25">Twenty-five</num> boys are here instructed in grammatical learning, &amp;c. and the master is allowed a dwelling, in addition to his annual salary. Among the learned men who have been masters of this school, was Mr. William Baxter, a native of Shropshire, nephew to the famous Richard Baxter, and author of the Dictionary of British Antiquities, published under the title of <title lang=la>Glossarium Antiquitatum Britannicarum.</title> He resigned but a short time previous to his death, which <pb id="p.343" n="343"> occurred in <datestruct VALUE="1723-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1723">1723</year></datestruct>. <num value="2">Two</num> other schools, several alms-houses, and various lectures, &amp;c. in different parts of England, are also supported by this company. 
<p>Respecting the state of this and several other companies a curious record has been kindly communicated by J. Caley, esq. F. R. S. F. S. A., &amp;c. It is a list of the freemen of the various companies resident in London and Westminster; from Thomas Lewyn being mentioned as sheriff, it appears it was made in the year <datestruct value="1537"><year reg="1537">1537</year></datestruct>.

<p>This company was incorporated by Edward the <num value="3">Third</num>, in the year <datestruct value="1345"><year reg="1345">1345</year></datestruct>, under the title of  <QUOTE>The Wardens and Commonalty of the Mystery of the Grocery of the City of London.</QUOTE>  The grocers, however, under their primitive name of Pepperers, existed as a company long previous to that period, perhaps for centuries; and so early as the <num value="17">17th</num> of Henry the <num value="3">Third</num>, (anno <datestruct value="1232"><year reg="1232">1232</year></datestruct>); a pepperer, named Andrew Buckerell, was chosen to fill the civic chair, and he retained his seat during <num value="6">six</num> years. Several other pepperers were afterwards advanced to the same dignity, previous to the year <datestruct value="1328"><year reg="1328">1328</year></datestruct>, when John Grauntham, another member of this company, was elected to the praetorian office, under the then modern appellation of grocer. 
<p>A pepperer was still, however, not unfrequently a distinct business; and continued so till as late a period as <datestruct value="1559--"><year reg="1559">1559</year></datestruct>. In that year a quantity of pepper, having been taken in a Spanish carrack, was purchased from the queen at a good price by certain exclusive dealers in that article. The grocers, however, endeavoured to undersell the pepperers by making other importations of their own, which caused the latter to petition her majesty, that no pepper might be imported for <num value="3">three</num> years, which would enable them to keep their engagement with her majesty; and to induce her to do so, they promised not to raises the price of pepper above <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> shillings</measure> in the pound. <pb id="p.345" n="345"> 
<p>Starch was <num value="1">first</num> sold by this company, which Stow says came into fashion about the latter end of the reign of Elizabeth. 
<p>The charter granted by Edward has been several times confirmed, with additional privileges; particularly by Henry VI. and Charles <num value="1">1</num>. Among their other privileges was the management of the king's beam, an office which appears to have been vested in the company time immemorially; they  <QUOTE> having had all along,</QUOTE>  says Ravenhill, the historian of the company,<NOTE>Who published an account of this company in <datestruct value="1689--"><year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct>, in which he refers the origin of the society of grocers to Romans!</NOTE>  <QUOTE>the naming of the weight-master, and the naming, placing, removing, and governing, of the <num value="4">four</num> porters attending that office, all to be elected out of their own company, and to be sworn at their own hall, a privilege allowed to them, as their undoubted and inseparable right, as ancient as that office itself used in the city. Amongst other privileges and ancient usages of this company, I find recorded also, that even as high as Edward the <num value="4">fourth</num>'s days, they had the power of inspection and correction of abuses and irregularities of all persons in the city or suburbs, any way using or exercising any kind of grocery, and also to assay the weights they bought or sold by; and to take notice of all defaults, and to return such to be fined at the discretion of this fellowship; and to take <measure value="4d." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> of every person for their labour herein: which usage was always continued; and, in the charter renewed to the company, the <num value="15">15th</num> of Charles I. this privilege is confirmed and expressed to extend to the distance of <num value="3">three</num> miles from the city, as well within the liberties as without.</QUOTE>  
<p>This company has had the honour to enrol in its fraternity no fewer than <num value="5">five</num> monarchs, besides many princes, dukes, earls, viscounts, and barons; and so highly was it once regarded in the estimation of the citizens, that in the reign of Henry IV. <num value="12">twelve</num> aldermen were members at the same time. It consists of a master, <num value="3">three</num> wardens, <num value="52">fifty-two</num> assistants, and an extensive livery; formerly the master was always an alderman. Stow says, that about the year <datestruct value="1429"><year reg="1429">1429</year></datestruct>, this company had licence to purchase lands to the value of <measure value="500bmark" type=currency><num value="500">500</num> marks</measure>. 
<p>Though the committee of parliament fixed upon Grocers' Hall for their place of sitting at the commencement of the unhappy disputes with Charles I. the company itself was distinguished for its steady attachment to that unfortunate sovereign; and it was probably on this account that Charles II. his profligate successor, became a member of it, when he accepted the freedom of the city in the year <datestruct value="1675"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, after having been sumptuously banquetted in Guildhall at the inauguration feast of sir Robert Vyner, goldsmith. In the <num value="2">two</num> preceding years also, the civic dinner was honoured by the presence of the king; in <datestruct value="1673--"><year reg="1673">1673</year></datestruct>, when sir Robert Hanson, grocer, and in <datestruct value="1674--"><year reg="1674">1674</year></datestruct>, when sir William Hooker, grocer, took possession of the <pb id="p.346" n="346"> mayoralty. On all these occasions, the general splendour of the processional show was increased by much pageantry, &amp;c. at the charge of the respective companies in which the lord mayors had taken up their freedoms. 
<p>Various free schools, alms-houses, exhibitions, &amp;c. are supported by this company in different parts of England, and their expenditure for charitable purposes is upwards of <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num>l.</measure> yearly. 
<p>The hall of this company is situated on the north side of the Poultry, within an inclosed court. The site of this edifice with the  <QUOTE>building thereupon,</QUOTE>  was originally purchased by the company in the year <datestruct value="1411"><year reg="1411">1411</year></datestruct>, for the sum of <measure value="320bmark" type=currency><num value="320">320</num> marks</measure>, of the baron Robert Fitzwalter, hereditary castellan banneret, or standard bearer to the city of London.<NOTE><BIBL>Brayley's London, ii. p. <num value="359">359</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>

<p>This Company, as it now exists, was formed by the junction of the <num value="2">two</num> guilds or brotherhoods of salt-fishmongers and stock-fishmongers, and was incorporated by Henry VIII. by the name of  <QUOTE>the wardens and commonalty of the mystery of Fishmongers,</QUOTE>  &amp;c. in the year <datestruct value="1536"><year reg="1536">1536</year></datestruct>. The salt-fishmongers had been <num value="1">first</num> incorporated so early as <datestruct value="1433"><year reg="1433">1433</year></datestruct>, the stock-fishmongers not till <datestruct value="1509"><year reg="1509">1509</year></datestruct>; yet long before either of those dates, the fishmongers were united as a brotherhood, and from the great extent of their trade during the prevalence of the catholic religion, they had obtained great sway and affluence. In the reign of Edward I. (anno <datestruct value="1290"><year reg="1290">1290</year></datestruct>,) they were fined <measure value="500bmark" type=currency><num value="500">500</num> marks</measure> for being guilty of forestalling, contrary to the laws and constitutions of the city; and during the following century, so strong a prejudice had been excited against them from charges of fraudulent dealing, that in <datestruct value="1382--"><year reg="1382">1382</year></datestruct>, the parliament enacted, <QUOTE>that no fishmonger should for the future be admitted mayor of this city;</QUOTE>  this prohibition, however, was removed in the following year. About that time, there seems to have been a very strong prejudice existing against these traders, and in the parliament then held, Nicholas Exton, speaker for the fishmongers, particularly  <QUOTE> prayed the king to receive him and the company under the immediate <pb id="p.350" n="350"> royal protection, lest they might receive corporeal hurt.</QUOTE>  This request originated from the various street tumults, wherein the fishmongers were the objects of popular indignation and insult; for a considerable period also, there were continual disputes between this company and the goldsmiths in regard to precedence. 
<p>The ancient statutes of this company are to be found in the 
<title>Liber Horn</title>, still kept in Guildhall; according to which, no fishmonger was to buy fish beyond the bounds appointed; which were the chapel on London-bridge, Baynard's castle, and Jordan's Key. No fish were to be bought in any boat, unless <num value="1">first</num> brought to land. No fishmonger was to buy a fresh fish before mass was ended at the chapel upon the bridge; and was to sell fresh fish only after mass, and salt fish after prime. About the same time, viz. A. D. <datestruct value="1320"><year reg="1320">1320</year></datestruct>, the fishmongers, who kept shops upon Fish-wharf, used to sell herrings and other fish brought by land and by water, to the inhabitants, and to hawkers who carried them through the streets; but the other fishmongers having entered into a combination to prevent the sale of fish by retail at that wharf, those belonging to the wharf obtained the king's order to the mayor and sheriffs, to permit them to continue to sell herrings and other fish, either in wholesale or retail, to all who chose to buy. 
<p>Before the union of the <num value="2">two</num> companies we learn from Stow, that the fishmongers had  <QUOTE><num value="6">six</num> several halls,</QUOTE>   <QUOTE> in Thames-street twain, New Fish-street twain, and in Old Fish-street twain;</QUOTE>  but after their joint incorporation they agreed to have but <num value="1">one</num>, namely,  <QUOTE> in the house given unto them by lord Fanhope (sir John Cornewell) in the parish of St. Michael, Crooked-lane.</QUOTE>  The fabric here mentioned was destroyed by the great fire in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, after which the hall (recently pulled down by the side of the Thames,) was erected from the designs of Sir Christopher Wren.

<p>The <emph rend=caps>Goldsmiths' Company</emph> is of very remote institution, as already noticed, it having been fined as adulterine so early as the year <datestruct value="1180"><year reg="1180">1180</year></datestruct>; yet it was not incorporated till <datestruct value="1327"><year reg="1327">1327</year></datestruct>, when Edward the <num value="3">Third</num>, in consideration of the sum of <measure value="10bmark" type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> marks</measure>, granted the members his letters patent, under the title of  <QUOTE>The Wardens and Commonalty of the Mystery of Goldsmiths,</QUOTE>  &amp;c. with power to purchase estates to the value of <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">20</num>l.</measure> annually, for the support of their indigent and superannuated brethren.

These grants were afterwards confirmed by Edward IV. in the year <datestruct value="1462"><year reg="1462">1462</year></datestruct>, who also constituted this society a body politic and <pb id="p.353" n="353"> corporate, to have a perpetual succession, and a common seal. By the said grant they had likewise the privilege of inspecting, trying, and regulating all gold and silver wares, not only in this city, but in other parts of this kingdom; and this privilege has been since so materially enlarged, that they have the power of inspecting all gold and silver wares, in the following particular places, viz. Birmingham, Sheffield, Chester, Newcastle, Norwich, and Exeter; with the power of punishing all offenders concerned in working adulterated gold and silver; and of making bye-laws for their better government. 
<p>This was evidently an extension of a statute made in the <num value="23">twenty-third</num> of Edward the <num value="1">First</num>, which empowered the warden to  <QUOTE>assay gold and silver manufactures;</QUOTE>  which  <QUOTE>shall be of good and true alloy, and be marked.</QUOTE>  The privileges of the goldsmiths have since been confirmed under various acts of parliament, and many judicious enactments made to support their authority.

Before the business of banking became a regular trade, about the middle of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, and also for many years afterwards, the goldsmiths were the chief bankers, their general opulence occasioning them to be regarded as the most trustworthy of the various classes of tradesmen, that inhabited the city.

<p>The <emph rend=caps>Skinners' company</emph> was incorporated by Edward the <num value="3">Third</num>, in the year <datestruct value="1327"><year reg="1327">1327</year></datestruct>, by the appellation of  <QUOTE> the master and wardens of the Guild or Fraternity of Brothers and Sisters of the skinners of London, to the honour of God and the precious body of our Lord Jesus Christ.</QUOTE>  At that period, the skinners, who had long formed a very affluent and respectable class of citizens,.were divided into <num value="2">two</num> brotherhoods, <num value="1">one</num> at St. Mary Spital, the other at St. Mary Bethlehem, but Richard the <num value="2">Second</num>, in his eighteenth year, consolidated the <num value="2">two</num> bodies, and Henry the <num value="6">Sixth</num>, in <datestruct value="1438--"><year reg="1438">1438</year></datestruct>, confirmed their former grants, and directed that every person when admitted to the freedom of the company, should in future be presented to the lord mayor; this custom is still observed.<NOTE>In the times of Catholic superstition, it was customary for the company of Skinners, to make a grand procession through the principal streets of the city on Corpus Christi day in the afternoon, in which, says Stow's continuator, Munday,  <QUOTE>were borne more than <num value="100">one hundred</num> torches of wax (costly garnished, burning light,) and above <num value="200">two hundred</num> clerks and priests in surplices aud copes, singing: after which came the sheriffs' servants, the clerks of the computers, chaplain for the sheriffs, the mayor's serjeants, the councell of the city, the mayor and aldermen in scarlet, and then the skinners in their best liveries.</QUOTE> --<BIBL>Stow's Sur. p. <num value="248">248</num>. Edit. <datestruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 <pb id="p.356" n="356"> 
<p>The Skinner's company particularly flourished when sables, lucerns, and other rich furs were accustomed to be worn for tippets by the monarchs and nobility of England; but as commerce extended in the reign of queen Elizabeth, other garments came into use, and the trade declined. Henry Lane, a correspondent of Hackluit, the collector of voyages, in aletter written in <datestruct value="1567--"><year reg="1567">1567</year></datestruct>, remarks, that it was <QUOTE>a great pity but it (the wearing of furs) should be renewed; especially in courts and among magistrates, not only for the restoring of an old worshipful art and company, but also because they are for our climate, wholesome, delicate, grave, and comely, expressing dignity, comforting age, and of long continuance; and better with small cost to be preserved than those new silks, shags, and rags, wherein a great part of the wealth of the land is hastily consumed.</QUOTE> 
<p>The fur trade continuing to decline, particularly after the incorporation of the Eastland merchants in <datestruct value="1579--"><year reg="1579">1579</year></datestruct>, who purchased skins from pedlars and others for the purpose of exportation, a controversy arose between those merchants and the Skinners' company, and the latter in consequence petitioned queen Elizabeth, that <QUOTE>no pedlars or petty chapmen might gather or engross any skins or furs of the breed of England, but under licence of the justices of the peace; that those who were thus licensed should not make sale of any such skins or furs so gathered by them, except to some persons known to be of the trade of skinners, and that all others might be restrained to buy and transport them.</QUOTE> The petition was opposed by the Eastland company, who, on the other hand, required  <QUOTE> to have free licence to buy, provide, and engross, in any place whatsoever, all manner of coney-skins, raw, or tawed [that is, prepared as white leather, by artizans hence called tawers] and at their pleasure to transport them in any bottom whatsoever, unto any place, yielding the ordinary custom.</QUOTE>  
<p>The claims of the Skinners' company were also powerfully resisted by the corporation, who in the height of the dispute wrote a letter to the lord treasurer, urging,  <QUOTE>that this practice of the skinners, that all the skins of the breed of England must <num value="1">first</num> pass through the hands and property of some freeman of that company, before they should be transported, would be to the exceeding great prejudice, not only of the city, but of all other traders into foreign ports within the whole realm,</QUOTE>  they therefore prayed, that the intended new patent to the skinners, which was then nearly ready to be signed by the queen,  <QUOTE> might be stayed, till such time as he should be better informed, touching the great inconvenience which would grow thereby, and for which purpose they had appointed a deputation of aldermen and others to attend upon him.</QUOTE>  Through this application, the petition of the Skinners' company was rendered ineffectual, and the fur trade got into fresh channels, as commercial rights were extended, and became better understood. These results lowered the influence of the company, as a trading <pb id="p.357" n="357"> society, though in all other respects it still <num value="1">one</num> of the most respectable and affluent belonging to the city. 
<p>The original Skinners'-hall, which Stow describes as  <QUOTE>a very fayre house, sometimes called Copped-hall,</QUOTE>  was purchased by the company, together with several small tenements adjacent, as early as the reign of Henry III. and the skinners afterwards held it under a licence of mortmain granted by that king. It was afterwards alienated, though by what means is uncertain; and in the <num value="19">19th</num> of Edward II. was possessed by Ralph de Cobham, the brave Kentish warrior, who having made Edward III. his heir, was thus the cause of the skinners being reinstated in their ancient purchase, which the monarch restored about the time of the legal incorporation of the company. 
<p>The present Skinners'-hall, is a very handsome and convenient structure, standing on Dowgate-hill, on the site of the ancient building.

<p>This company arose from an ancient guild or fraternity, dedicated to St. John Baptist, and called  <QUOTE>time out of mind,</QUOTE>  says Stow,  <QUOTE>of taylors and linen armourers of London.</QUOTE>  This guild received a confirmation from Edward I. in his <num value="28">28th</num> year, with power to  <QUOTE> hold a feast, at Midsummer, to choose a master,</QUOTE>  &amp;c. At that period, and during a long succession of years, the master was denominated  <QUOTE> the pilgrim--as <num value="1">one</num> that travelled for the whole companie, and the foure wardens were then called purveyors of alms.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Stow's Sur. p. <num value="142">142</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> In the year <datestruct value="1466"><year reg="1466">1466</year></datestruct>, a more regular incorporation of this company took place, under the authority of the letters patent of Edward IV. who was himself a freeman, as all his predecessors in the sovereignty had also been, from the time of Edward III. Henry VII. who was likewise a member, re-incorporated the company in the year <datestruct value="1503"><year reg="1503">1503</year></datestruct>, by the new description of  <QUOTE>the master and wardens of the merchant taylors, of the fraternity of St. John Baptist, in the city of London.</QUOTE>  This was done, according to the above historian,  <QUOTE>for <pb id="p.360" n="360"> that divers of that fraternitie had beene great marchants, and had frequented all sorts of marchandizes into most partes of the world, to the honour of the king's realme, and to the great profit of his subjectes, and of his progenitors; and the men of the said mistirie, had, during the time aforesaid, exercised the buying and selling of all wares and marchandises, especially of woolen clothe, as well in grosse, as by retayle, throughout all the realme of England, and chiefly within the said city.</QUOTE>  
<p>The members of this company consist principally of merchants, mercers, drapers, taylors, &amp;c. to the amount of upwards of <num value="500">500</num> in number. They are governed by a master, <num value="4">four</num> wardens, and about <num value="40">forty</num> assistants. In the long list of distinguished characters, who have been enrolled among the freemen of this most respectable community, are included <num value="11">eleven</num> sovereigns, about as many princes of the blood royal, <num value="13">thirteen</num> dukes, <num value="2">two</num> duchesses, nearly <num value="30">thirty</num> archbishops and bishops, <num value="50">fifty</num> earls, <num value="5">five</num> countesses, between <num value="70">seventy</num> and <num value="80">eighty</num> lords and barons, upwards of <num value="20">twenty</num> lord mayors, <num value="15">fifteen</num> abbots and priors, many knights, &amp;c. 
<p><num value="1">One</num> of the most eminent taylors (professionally so) on record was sir John Hawkwood, a native of Essex.<NOTE>He was the son of Gilbert de Hawkwood, a tanner of Sible Hedingham; after his decease a monument was erected in the church there to his memory, by his executors.</NOTE> He was usually styled,  <QUOTE>Johannes Acutes,</QUOTE>  and is stated, in the jocular language of Fuller, to have  <QUOTE> turned his needle into a sword, and his thimble into a shield.</QUOTE>  During his apprenticeship to a taylor in the city, he was pressed, and sent into France, where, through his valour and talents, he was promoted from the station of a private soldier to the rank of captain, and was also honoured with knighthood. After the peace made in <datestruct value="1360--"><year reg="1360">1360</year></datestruct>, he became a leader among the military adventurers, or companies, called the  <QUOTE> late-commers,</QUOTE>  and having greatly signalized himself as commandant of the white bands, his aid was solicited by Barnabas, (brother to the duke of Milan,) who was then at war with the state of Mantua. In this new service, his prowess and gallantry gave so much satisfaction, that Barnabas bestowed on him his daughter in marriage, together with an estate of considerable value. He afterwards assisted pope Gregory the <num value="12">twelfth</num>, in recovering the revolted cities of Provence, and was rewarded with dominion over <num value="5">five</num> towns. He next entered into the pay of the Florentines, and served them with such great success and fidelity, that on his decease,  <QUOTE> after infinite victories obtained, and an incomparable renown amongst all men for the same,</QUOTE>  he was most honourably buried in the Great Church at Florence, where a noble monument was raised to his memory, agreeably to a vote of the senate. He died full of years and glory, in <datestruct value="1394--"><year reg="1394">1394</year></datestruct>. Sir Ralph Blackwell, who is stated to have been his fellow apprentice, and was also knighted for his valour by Edward III. was a member <pb id="p.361" n="361"> of this company. Pennant says,  <QUOTE> he founded the hall which bears his name,</QUOTE>  but this assertion appears to have been made without sufficient authority.<NOTE>In the year <datestruct value="1668"><year reg="1668">1668</year></datestruct>, Winstanley published a small octavo, now very scarce, with the following title,  <QUOTE>The Honour of the Merchant Taylors; wherein is set forth the noble acts, valiant deeds, and heroic performances of merchant taylors in former ages; their honourable loves, and knightly adventures, their  combatting with foreign enemies, and glorious successes in honour of the English nation; together with their pious acts and large benevolences,</QUOTE>  &amp;c. The head of sir Ralph Blackwell, with city arms on the right, and those of the merchant taylors on the left, was prefixed.</NOTE> Among the other eminent persons enrolled as merchant taylors, were the celebrated historians, Speed, and Stow; both of whom, likewise, were taylors by profession. 
<p>In Stow's Annals, under the date <datestruct value="1607"><year reg="1607">1607</year></datestruct>, is an account of a splendid entertainment given to James I. his son Henry, and  <QUOTE>very many of the nobility, and other honourable personages,</QUOTE>  by the merchant taylors, on the day of their annual feast, (<datestruct VALUE="-07-16"><month reg="07">July</month> the <day reg=16>16th</day></datestruct>) and election of master and wardens.  <QUOTE>Against their coming,</QUOTE>  says our author,  <QUOTE> the lord mayor gave his attendance there, and at the hall gate presented his majestie with the sword, who presently gave it him againe, who bare it before the king into the upper large dining roome, anciently called the king's chamber,</QUOTE>  &amp;c. Here the king was feasted, <QUOTE> very royally and joyfully,</QUOTE>  and afterwards presented with a  <QUOTE>purse of golde,</QUOTE>  by the master; the  <QUOTE>clerk of the hall,</QUOTE>  shewing him, at the same time, a roll of all the dignified members that had ever belonged to this company. The purse was  <QUOTE>graciously received</QUOTE>  by the monarch, who in return stated, that  <QUOTE>he was himself free of another company, but that the prince, his eldest son, should become a merchant taylor,</QUOTE>  and that  <QUOTE>he would see, and be a witness, when the garland should be put on his head.</QUOTE>  Then all  <QUOTE> descended into the great hall, where the prince dined,</QUOTE>  and he also, having <num value="1">first</num> been presented with a.  <QUOTE>purse of golde,</QUOTE>  and shewed the roll, declared that he would become a freeman,  <QUOTE> and therewithal commanded <num value="1">one</num> of his gentlemen, and the clerk, to go to all the lords there present, and to require all of them that loved him, and were not free of other companies, to be free of his company</QUOTE> ; this was of course acceded to, and James, during the whole ceremony,  <QUOTE>stood in a new window, made for the purpose,</QUOTE>  and beheld all  <QUOTE> with gracious kingly aspect.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Howe's Stow, p. <num value="890">890</num>, <num value="891">891</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The hall of this company is situated in Threadneedle-street, on an extensive site, originally occupied by the  <QUOTE>principal messuage</QUOTE>  of a  <QUOTE>worshipful gentleman,</QUOTE>  named Edmund Crepin, who in the year <datestruct value="1331"><year reg="1331">1331</year></datestruct> (<num value="6">sixth</num> of Edward III.)  <QUOTE> for a certain sum of money,</QUOTE>  made it over in trust for the company, to John de Yakesley, the king's pavillion-maker.<NOTE><BIBL>Stow's Sur. p. <num value="143">143</num>, edit. <datestruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></datestruct>.</BIBL></NOTE> This messuage was afterwards called the New Hall, or Taylors' Inn, to distinguish it from the ancient hall <pb id="p.362" n="362"> which stood in Basing-lane.<NOTE><BIBL>Stow's Sur. p. <num value="198">198</num>, edit. <datestruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>.</BIBL></NOTE><!>THIS FOOTNOTE HAS A DOUBLE DAGGER MARKER, INSTEAD OF AN ASTERISK, BOTH IN THE TEXT AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE</!> The present structure was erected soon after the fire of London, and is a large but irregular structure of brick.

The more ancient name of these traders was hurriers and milainers, the <num value="1">first</num> from dealing in hats and caps, the latter from their dealing in merchandize chiefly imported from the city of Milan in Italy. 
<p>The business of the haberdashers made but little progress in London, till after the extension of commerce in the reign of queen Elizabeth. In the time of her immediate predecessor, there were scarcely more than a dozen of their shops in the whole city; yet within <num value="40">forty</num> years after (about <datestruct value="1580--"><year reg="1580">1580</year></datestruct>) they had greatly increased, and we are told, though doubtless with some considerable exaggeration, that  <QUOTE> the whole street from Westminster, was crowded with them.</QUOTE>  The haberdashers of that age appear to have been dealers in most of the minor articles of foreign manufacture, and their shops made such a  <QUOTE> gay appearance,</QUOTE>  that many persons were thence induced to commence an extravagant expenditure.  <QUOTE> marvel no man taketh heed to it,</QUOTE>  said a writer in Elizabeth's days, in reference to the circumstance just stated,  <QUOTE> what number of trifles cometh hither from beyond the seas, that we might either clean spare, or else make them within our own realm; for which we either pay inestimable treasure every year, or else exchange substantial wares and necessaries for them, for the which we might receive great treasure.</QUOTE>  
<p>Among the wares which constituted a part of the haberdashery of that period, were,  <QUOTE>daggers, swords, owches, broaches, aiglets, Spanish girdles, French cloths, Milan caps, glasses, painted cruises, dials, tables, cards, balls, puppets, ink-horns, tooth-picks, fine earthern pots, pins and points, hawk's bells, salt-cellars, spoons, knives, and tin dishes.</QUOTE>  A yet more curious enumeration of goods vended by the  <QUOTE> milloners, or haberdashers,</QUOTE>  who dwelt at the Royal Exchange, within <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> years after it had been built by sir Thomas Gresham, occurs in Howe, who says, they  <QUOTE> sould mouse-trappes, bird-cages, shooing-hornes, lanthorns, and Jew's trumpes.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Howe's Stow's Ann. p. <num value="869">869</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> The article pins, before the introduction of which, the English ladies are stated to have used points or skewers made of thorns, &amp;c. to fasten their garments with, formed a very lucrative branch of trade; and <measure value="60000l." type=currency><num value="60000">60,000</num>l.</measure> annually, is said to have been paid for them to foreigners in the early years of queen Elizabeth; yet long before the decease of that princess, they were manufactured in great quantities in this country, and in the time of James the <num value="1">First</num>, the English artizan  <QUOTE> exceeded every foreign competitor in the production of this diminutive, though useful article of dress.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Brayley's London, ii. p. <num value="385">385</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>

During the middle ages, they seem to have united the professions, both of merchant and factor, &rsquo;for while they had large warehouses and yards, whence they exported and sold bar iron, and iron rods, they had also shops, wherein they displayed abundance of manufactured articles, which they purchased of the workmen in town and country,  <QUOTE> and of which they afterwards became the general retailers.</QUOTE>  
<p>Their hall is a stately, modern edifice, standing on the north side of Fenchurch-street; and is either the <num value="3">third</num> or <num value="4">fourth</num> that has been raised on the same site. 
<p>The affairs of this company are conducted by a master and <num value="2">two</num> wardens, assisted by a court of the whole livery, who are about <num value="100">100</num> in number.

<p>In the court books of this company, which have been preserved from the time of queen Mary, are many curious entries respecting supplies for the exigencies of the state; as well as various particulars regarding the providing of men, arms, and ammunition; the purchase of corn for the city; the ceremonies and expences attendant on processional pageants, &c, Among the former, is the following singular precept, directed to the company  <QUOTE>by the maior.</QUOTE>

<p>The armourers were formerly employed in making coats of mail, helmets, and the rest of the defensive furniture of ancient warfare; but, after the use of fire-arms became generally prevalent, their business fell into complete disuse. So little, indeed, is the manufacture of plate armour now understood, that the making of <num value="2">two</num> suits, the <num value="1">one</num> of brass, the other of steel, for a place of public amusement, was regarded as a matter of much interest and ability. In the reign of Henry VIII. the armourers of London derived so much useful instruction from some German artificers, who had been sent to England at the request of the king himself, that they soon undersold the foreigners. In queen Elizabeth's time, there were <num value="35">thirty-five</num> armourers resident in the metropolis, who kept servants and shops; yet so rapidly did their trade decay, that in the reign of James I. that number was reduced to <num value="5">five</num> only, with <num value="1">one</num> servant each. The company is now chiefly composed of braziers, founders, and coppersmiths. 
<p>The hall of this company is a plain brick edifice, standing at the north end of Coleman-street. <pb id="p.378" n="378"> 
<p>To this company is united that of the braziers, who are jointly governed by a master, <num value="2">two</num> wardens, and <num value="21">twenty-one</num> assistants. It is a livery company.

<p>There was an estimate made about this time as to what quantity of beer was exported yearly to the Low Countries and other places; from which it appeared that there were <num value="20">twenty</num> great brewhouses, or more, situated on the Thames side, from Milford stairs to below St. Katherines, which brewed yearly the quantity of <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> brewings of sweet beer or strong beer, that passed to Embden, the Low Countries, Calais, Dieppe, and thereabouts.

<p>The demand for beer from foreign countries increased greatly during the whole of the reign of Elizabeth, and the liberty of exporting it was only checked, by proclamation, during the occasional occurrence of dearth and scarcity. <num value="1">One</num> record states, that <num value="500">500</num> tuns were exported at once  <QUOTE>for the queen's use;</QUOTE>  or, as it has been explained, for the service of her army in the Low Countries; considerable quantities, also, were sent to Embden and Amsterdam. 
<p>During the succeeding reigns, to the present time, the prices of ale and beer have been highly augmented through the operation of the successive imposts that have been laid on malt and hops, the duties on which now form an important branch of the public revenue. So great, indeed, has the consumption become, that in the year ending on <datestruct VALUE="1812-01-5"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=5>5th</day>, <year reg=1812>1812</year></datestruct>, the duties on malt alone, produced the vast sum of <measure value="3315389l." type=currency><num value="3315389">3,315,389</num>l.</measure> The most rapid increase in price took place in the course of the last reign, at the commencement of which, in <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>, ale was sold at <measure value="5d." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>d.</measure> the quart, and strong beer, or porter (which had <num value="1">first</num> come into general use in the time of George I.) at <measure value="3d." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>d.</measure> the quart. Since then the prices have been progressively advanced, and ale is now retailed at eightpence the quart; and porter at <measure value="5d." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> pence</measure> the quart; the former price at a <num value="1">first</num> view appears to be equal to the sum for which <num value="8">eight</num> gallons of ale could have been obtained in the reign of Henry III. yet, when the increase in the value of money is properly estimated, it will be found that the augmentation has not been greater than in the proportion of <num value="1">one</num> and a half to <num value="1">one</num>.<NOTE>The quantity of porter brewed in London, by the <num value="10">ten</num> principal houses from the <datestruct VALUE="1826-07-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month> <year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct>, to the <datestruct VALUE="1827-07-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month> <year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, was as follows:

<p>In the <num value="2">second</num> year of Elizabeth, the stationers had the grant of a livery, and were directed  <QUOTE>to prepare and make ready the same liverys with speed, so that they may from henceforth attend and wait upon the lord mayor of this city at all common shews,</QUOTE>  &amp;c. <num value="30">Thirty</num> years afterwards, namely, in <datestruct VALUE="1588-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1588">1588</year></datestruct>-<num value="9">9</num>, a precept was sent by the lord mayor, requiring the master and wardens, and <num value="6">six</num> of the comeliest personages of the company, to attend him at the Park corner, above St. James's, on horseback, in velvet coats, chains of gold, and with staff torches, to wait on the queen  <QUOTE>for the recreating of her majesty</QUOTE>  in her progress from Chelsea to Whitehall.<NOTE>See the Precept at large in <BIBL>queen Elizabeth's Progresses, vol. iii. p. xv.</BIBL></NOTE> Similar precepts for the attendance of the most  <QUOTE>graceful</QUOTE>  men of the company have also since been directed to the masters and wardens in different reigns. 
<p>James the <num value="1">First</num>, by his letters patent, dated at Harfield, <datestruct VALUE="1603-10-29"><month reg="10">October</month> the <day reg=29>29th</day>, <year reg=1603>1603</year></datestruct>, granted to the stationers' company the privilege of the sole printing of  <QUOTE>all manner of bookes and bookes of Prymers, Psalters, and Psalms, in meter, or prose, with musycall notes or without notes, both in great volumes and in small, in the English tonge,</QUOTE>  as well as all manner of  <QUOTE>almanackes and prognostycacions whatsoever in the English tonge, and all manner of bookes <pb id="p.419" n="419"> and pamphletts tendynge to the same purpose.</QUOTE>  By another charter dated at Westminster, <datestruct VALUE="1615-03-8"><month reg="03">March</month> the <day reg=8>8th</day>, <year reg=1615>1615</year></datestruct>, the same monarch confirmed his former grant to the stationers, and established them in the sole right of printing  <QUOTE> the Psalms of David in English meetre, and notes to singe them; the A, B, C, with the little catechisme, and the catechisme in English and Latine, by Alexander Nowell,</QUOTE>  all which had been already transferred to the company under a grant made by queen Elizabeth: he also gave them liberty to make the necessary laws and ordinances for the due maintenance of their privileges. 
<p>The sole right of printing almanacks was long maintained by this company; but in the early part of the last reign, after a strenuously-contested litigation in the courts of law, a Mr. Thomas Carnan, bookseller, in St Paul's church-yard, obtained a legal decision against the exclusive privilege of the stationers; and the printing of almanacks was in consequence left open to the public at large. The prior possession of the trade, however, the holding of all the popular copyrights, and the low rates at which their almanacks are retailed, have contributed to secure to the company almost as general a sale as if their previous monopoly had been established; and the publication of these annual calendars forms a very productive branch of the revenue. 
<p>The entry of printed books on the registers of the stationers' company, which is attended by the payment of a small sum, and the deposit of <num value="9">nine</num> copies of the work entered, secures protection from piracy, under pain of certain specific penalties.<NOTE><BIBL>Brayley's Hist. of London ii. p. <num value="433">433</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>

<p>The watermen do not appear to have had any charter of incorporation before the reign of Philip and Mary, when they were established by parliament, <datestruct value="1556--"><year reg="1556">1556</year></datestruct>, and it was enacted in the <num value="2">2nd</num> and <num value="3">3rd</num> of that reign, cap. <num value="16">16</num>, that, out of the watermen between Gravesend and Windsor, <num value="8">eight</num> overseers shall be chosen by the court of aldermen of the city of London, to keep order over the whole body. Besides it is ordained, that their wherries are to be <num value="12">twelve</num> feet and a half long, and <num value="4">four</num> feet and a half broad in the midship, or be liable to forfeiture; watermen's names were to be registered by the overseers, and their fares appointed by the court of aldermen, &amp;c. and the lord mayor and aldermen of London, and the justices of the peace of the counties adjoining to the Thames, have power to determine offences. 
<p>By an act passed in the <num value="2">second</num> year of the reign of king George II. no waterman on the Thames shall take any apprentice or servant, unless he registers the place of his known habitation with the clerk of the company, on pain of <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure>, and if any person, not having served <num value="7">seven</num> years to a waterman, shall row any boat for hire, he incurs the like penalty; but gardeners' boats, dungboats, lighters, &amp;c. are excepted. 
<p>By an act passed in the <num value="7">7th</num> and <num value="8">8th</num> Geo.

<p>The common concerns of this company are regulated by a general court, consisting of a master, <num value="4">four</num> wardens, and <num value="21">twenty-one</num> assistants. All the boats belonging to this fraternity must be numbered and registered, and any exaction or extortion beyond the proper rates fixed by the lord mayor and court of aldermen (a list of which rates or fares is always hung up in the passage to the court rooms at Guildhall,) or any abuse or misbehaviour, subjects the offender to a fine or imprisonment for a stated time. The application for redress should be made generally to the clerk of the <pb id="p.425" n="425"> watermens'-hall, and the number of the boat given; the offender is then summoned to answer the complaint, and the cause is heard, and summarily decided. Among the offences punishable by fine, are  <QUOTE> immodest and lewd expressions,</QUOTE>  if uttered while rowing on the river, or at any of the plying places between Gravesend and Windsor.

<p>This fraternity is very ancient, and were originally called <foreign lang=la>Thellarii</foreign>; and, in the reign of king Henry I. they paid <measure value="16l." type=currency><num value="16">sixteen</num> pounds</measure> annually to the crown, for their immunities. It is supposed they were the <num value="1">first</num> incorporated of all the city companies; and this conjecture is corroborated by a passage in Cotton's Records of Parliament, which states, that in the <num value="8">eighth</num> of Henry the <num value="4">Fourth</num>, the weavers of London prayed the king that  <QUOTE>their charter granted by Henry, son of Maud the empress, for <measure value="20bmark" type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> marks</measure> <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> of fee farm,</QUOTE>  may be confirmed, so as the weavers, strangers, may be under their governance. In the charter referred to, which has been given in English by Stow,<NOTE><BIBL>Survey of London, p. <num value="266">266</num>. ed. <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>.</BIBL></NOTE> it was ordained, that  <QUOTE>no person either in the city, or in Southwark, or any other place appertaining to London, should exercise the weavers' craft, unless he belonged to their guild; and that no man should injure them under a penalty of <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>l.</measure>: by the same instrument the weavers were ordered to pay to the king <measure value="2bmark" type=currency><num value="2">two</num> marks</measure> of gold, annually, at Michaelmas.</QUOTE>  Henry the <num value="2">Second</num> again confirmed the franchises of the company in his <num value="31">thirty-first</num> year, but decreed also, that  <QUOTE>if any man made cloth of Spanish wool, mixed with English wool, the port-grave ought to burn it.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The tenacity with which the weavers maintained their chartered <pb id="p.427" n="427"> rights gave such offence, and occasioned so much contention, that, about the year <datestruct value="1200"><year reg="1200">1200</year></datestruct>, the city offered king John a gratuity of <measure value="60bmark" type=currency><num value="60">60</num> marks</measure> to dissolve the company. The result is differently stated: but the probability is, that the weavers were only at that time subjected to an increase of rent; but by an act of parliament passed in the reign of king Henry IV. they were put under the management and authority of the lord mayor and aldermen of the city. This company originally consisted of tapestry and cloth weavers; at present, however, it chiefly consists of worsted, cotton, and silk-weavers. It is a livery company, governed by <num value="2">two</num> bailiffs, <num value="2">two</num> wardens, and <num value="16">sixteen</num> assistants.

<div1 type=chapter id="c.15" n="15"><HEAD>An Account of the River Thames.</HEAD>
 
<p>The river Thames, the principal source of the wealth of the British metropolis, though certainly not the largest, yet, in respect of its navigation and produce, is the chief river in the world. The limits of an island are a natural bar to that extent of course, which is considered the boast of many continental rivers, but, in utility and commercial convenience, the Thames is <num value="2">second</num> to none. 
<p>This <QUOTE>king of floods</QUOTE> rises from a copious spring, called Thameshead, <num value="2">two</num> miles south-west of Cirencester, in Gloucestershire. It has been erroneously said, that its name is Isis, till it arrives at Dorchester, <num value="15">fifteen</num> miles below Oxford, when, being joined by the Thame, or Tame, it assumes the name of the Thames, which, it has been observed, is formed from the combination of the words Thame and Isis. The origin of this popular error cannot now be traced; poetical fiction has, however, perpetuated and invested it with a kind of classical sanctity. Camden says,  <QUOTE>It plainly appears, that the river was always called Thames or Tems, before it came near the Thame; and in several ancient charters granted to the abbey of Malmsbury, as well as that of Ensham, and in the old deeds relating to Cricklade, it is never considered under any other name than that of Thames.</QUOTE>  He likewise says, that it no where occurs under the name of Isis. All the historians who mention the incursions of Ethelwold into Wiltshire, in the year <datestruct value="905"><year reg="905">905</year></datestruct>, or that of Canute, in <datestruct value="1016--"><year reg="1016">1016</year></datestruct>, concur likewise in the same opinion, by declaring that they passed the Thames at Cricklade, in Wiltshire. Neither is it probable that Thames-head, an appellation by which the source has usually been distinguished, should give rise to a river of the name of Isis; which river after having run half its course, should re-assume the name of Thames, the appellation of its present spring. 
<p>About a mile below the source of the river is the <num value="1">first</num> corn-mill, which is called Kemble Mill. Here the river may properly be said to form a constant current; which, though not more than <num value="9">nine</num> feet wide in the summer, yet in the winter becomes such a torrent, as to overflow the meadows for many miles around. But insummer the Thames-head is so dry as to appear nothing but a large dell, interspersed with stones and weeds. 
<p>From Somerford the stream winds to Cricklade, where it unites with many other rivulets. Approaching Kernsford, it again enters its native county, dividing it from Berkshire, at Ingleshem. It widens considerably in its way to Lechlade; and being there joined by the Lech and Coln, at the distance of <num value="138">one hundred and thirty-eight</num> miles from London, it becomes navigable for vessels of <num value="90">ninety</num> tons. <FIGURE id="Fig.430"><HEAD>Plan of the River Thames, From the best authorities.</HEAD></FIGURE>

<pb id="p.431" n="431"> 
<p>At Ensham, in its course north-east to Oxford, is the <num value="1">first</num> stone bridge, a handsome <num value="1">one</num>, of <num value="3">three</num> arches, built by the earl of Abingdon. Passing the ruins of Godstow nunnery, celebrated as the place of interment of Fair Rosamond, the river reaches Oxford, in whose academic groves its poetical name of Isis has been so often invoked. Being there joined by the Charwell, it proceeds southeast to Abingdon, and thence to Dorchester, where it receives the Thame. Continuing its course south-east, by Wallingford, to Reading, and forming a boundary to the counties of Berks, Bucks, Surrey, Middlesex, Essex, and Kent, it washes the towns of Henley, Marlow, Maidenhead, Windsor, Eton, Egham, Staines, and Chertsey. Here the stream flows with much grandeur through an elegant stone bridge. 
<p>Advancing to Weybridge, the river is increased by the waters of the Wey from Surrey and Hampshire, and flowing onward through the luxuriant meadows between Shepperton and Oatlands, is crossed by the high arches of Walton bridge, which is a bold structure of brick with stone facings. At Sunbury are several splendid mansions and ornamented grounds; but the Surrey border is for some distance destitute of picturesque scenery. 
<p>Between Hampton and Kingston, the Thames makes another bold curve round the park and gardens of Hampton Court, and passing East Moulsey, where it receives an accession of waters from the Mole, which, rising near the southern borders of Surrey, in the forest of Tilgate, intersects that county nearly in the middle. 
<p>Kingston, anciently the residence of various Saxon monarchs, is next visited by the Thames, which here flows under a new stone bridge of <num value="5">five</num> arches; (here was formerly a woodenbridge of great antiquity ;) the Thames is now joined by a small rivulet from the neighbourhood of Epsom. Hence, passing Teddington (said to be a corruption from Tide-end town), the majestic stream rolls onward in a northerly course to Twickenham, Richmond, and Kew; its banks being skirted by magnificent villas, seats, and palaces. Near Teddington, appear the Gothic turrets of Strawberry-hill, the tasteful erection of the late earl of Orford; and at a little distance beyond that, was once the elegant seat of the poet on whom the muses lavished all their softer graces; Alexander Pope, esq. now, alas! levelled with the ground in the very wantonness of innovation.<NOTE><BIBL>Brayley's History, i. <num value="59">59</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> Still further, on the Middlesex side, are Marble-hall and Twickenham-park, and on the opposite shores are the well wooded precincts and villas of Petersham, Ham, and Richmond. The prospects from the latter spot are well known to fame, and poetry has not been wanting to display their charms. Thomson who lived at Rossdale house between Richmond and Kew, and lies buried in Richmond church, has thus celebrated its beauties in his Seasons: <pb id="p.432" n="432">

<p>From the well-finished and elegantly-shaped bridge at Richmond,<NOTE>The weedy shallows and small islands about Richmond and Twickenham, are famous for their eels, and many parties are formed in the metropolis in the summer months, for the purpose of making excursions up the river, to partake of the luxury of feeding on this fish, when newly caught.</NOTE> the Thames makes a bold sweep, passes Isleworth and Sion-house, to Brentford and Kew-bridge. On the Surrey borders, the gardens of Richmond and Kew extend their delightful walks. On the Middlesex side, at Isleworth, the river is augmented by the Cran, or Crane; and further on are the demesnes of Sion-house, the stately seat of the duke of Northumberland. The busy and irregular town of Brentford next presents itself; here the river, contracted by a line of islands overgrown with oziers, loses for some distance its dignified character; though, at the same time, its stream is enlarged by the Brent, which gives name to the county-town; here also the Grand Junction canal has its union with the Thames. 
<p>From Kew-bridge the river flows proudly on in sweeping curves between <num value="2">two</num> populous shores, skirted with villages and fine seats. Mortlake, Barnes, Chiswick, and Hammersmith, with their elegant villas and pleasure grounds, successively meet the eye. At Chiswick, is the pleasant seat of the duke of Devonshire, the grounds of which were <num value="1">first</num> laid out in the Italian <pb id="p.433" n="433"> style, and the villa built after a design of Palladio, by the late earl of Burlington, and at Barnes Elms, an elegant new suspension bridge. 
<p>The villages of Putney and Fulham, which are connected with each other by a long wooden bridge, next arrest the attention; and here begins that bustle of population and frequency of building, which for many miles from this point, accompany the windings of the stream. Putney, on the Surrey shore, is associated with our historical remembrances, from being the native place of the eloquent Gibbon, and of Thomas Cromwell, earl of Essex, and vicar-general, the once highly cherished favourite of Henry the <num value="8">eighth</num>, but afterwards the victim of that sanguinary tyrant. At Fulham, on the Middlesex side, is the venerable palace of the bishops of London; a brick edifice, surrounded by a moat. 
<p>Opposite to Wandsworth, the little river Wandle falls into the Thames; this stream is formed by <num value="2">two</num> small rivulets, that rise in the neighbourhood of Banstead Downs and the town of Croydon, and is famous for its bleaching mills and printing grounds. As the river proceeds, it swells into an extensive reach beyond Battersea bridge, a substantial wooden fabric, that connects Battersea with the populous village of Chelsea; where among various other objects of interest, is the college, or hospital, for disabled and superannuated soldiers, and the botanical garden belonging to the company of apothecaries of London. 
<p>The reach between Chelsea and Lambeth, presents fewer subjects for remark than its direct vicinity to the metropolis would lead <num value="1">one</num> to expect; and the bordering scenery has mostly a rural character and appropriation. On passing through Vauxhall bridge, a light and elegant structure of cast iron, the archiepiscopal palace of Canterbury, on the Surrey side, and the lofty piles of Westminster-hall and abbey, on the Middlesex shore, with the intervening bridge, and the numerous edifices that rise in proud succession beyond, break the sameness of the views, and assert the contiguity of an extensive city.  <QUOTE> The well known residence of the archbishop of Canterbury,</QUOTE>  says Mr. Noble,  <QUOTE> is far from being distinguished by architectural magnificence, yet the venerable air of antiquity presented by its towers, and the avenues of trees bordering the river beyond it, afford no unpleasing approach to the splendid scenes that succeed; the meanness of the irregular line of houses between the palace and bridge, cannot, however, but offend every lover of congruity.</QUOTE>  The commencement of the city of Westminster on the other bank, is more ornamental, though not adequate to the situation. The abbey, indeed, detains the eye by a solemn grandeur, not unworthy of the sentiments which its name and destination inspire; and the majesty of the bridge which bestrides and seems to exercise dominion over the <pb id="p.434" n="434"> broad stream that flows beneath, renders it a suitable entrance to the splendour of the commercial metropolis of Europe. 
<p>Between the bridges of Westminster, Waterloo, and Blackfriars, the Thames moves majestically along in a bold sweep; its banks on the Middlesex side are crowded with buildings, some of them of considerable interest; and on the Surrey shore, with a numerous but very irregular assemblage of private wharfs, timber-yards, and other repositories, devoted to the purposes of trade and manufactures. The effect of the whole scene is highly increased by the vast cathedral of St. Paul, which rises with impressive grandeur and in all the pride of Grecian architecture, from the most elevated part of the city. At Blackfriars, the width of the river is about <num value="230">230</num> feet less than at Westminster. 
<p>The London shore, between Blackfriars, Southwark, and London bridges, is occupied by a continued range of wharfs, yards, warehouses, &amp;c.  <QUOTE> for the accommodation of that immense trade which supplies the metropolis with the necessaries and luxuries of life, and the materials of commerce.</QUOTE>  The Surrey side is partly covered with wharfs, glass-houses, warehouses, dye-houses, and iron founderies, and partly forms an open street, called Bank-side, which is the only uninterrupted walk of any length on the immediate bank of the Thames, during its whole course through the cities of London and Westminster. 
<p>London bridge forms the partition between the river navigation, and the sea navigation, of the Thames; immediately below it commences the port of London, and the forest of masts that rises in direct view, and stretches beyond the reach of sight, announces the prodigious magnitude of that commerce which supplies the wants of an immense metropolis, and extends its arms to the remotest part of the globe. The limits of the port reach from London bridge, to the North Foreland in Kent, and to the Naze in Essex; but the ships trading to London, usually moor from the bridge to Limehouse, in which space it is computed that about <num value="800">800</num> sail can lie afloat, at the moorings, at low water. This space is called the Pool; the part near the bridge, on account of the shallowness of the water, is occupied by the smaller vessels, and the lower part by the larger. The very crowded and inconvenient state in which the merchant vessels used formerly to be moored in the pool, has been remedied of late years by the formation of several large docks at different distances on the river, between the Tower and Bow Creek. 
<p>Below London bridge, on the Middlesex side, the shore presents a series of wharfs and warehouses for a considerable distance, with the exception of the Custom house and the Tower. The opposite, or Southwark shore, from London-bridge downwards, is occupied nearly in the same manner by a succession of buildings, yards, &amp;c. all appropriated to, or connected with, maritime concerns. <pb id="p.435" n="435"> 
<p>From the entrance of Limehouse-reach, the river flows in a remarkable bend, of a horse-shoe form, round the Isle of Dogs; in a commodious part of which, adjoining to Poplar, the West India docks, and a canal have been formed. Beyond these are the Blackwall and East India docks, and about half a mile further is Bow Creek, where the river Lea falls into the Thames, and the latter river quits the shores of Middlesex. On the Kent side, which faces the Isle of Dogs, the Greenland-docks, with various buildings for the boiling and preparation of oil, the dock-yards and victualling-office at Deptford, and the magnificent hospital for disabled seamen at Greenwich, with Greenwich-park, the royal observatory, and the Kentish hills in the distance, form a 
<foreign lang=fr>coup d&lsquo;oeil</foreign> of considerable beauty. 
<p>As the Thames rolls onward to the sea between the shores of Kent and Essex, its reaches become more expansive, and its depth increases; whilst upon its bosom, the bulwarks of Britain's glory spread their sails in full security, and in their every variety of burthen.<NOTE><BIBL>Brayley's London, i. <num value="65">65</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> The Essex side, for several miles below the mouth of the Lea, presents only a level of marshes, broken by the creeks of Barking and Dagenham; further on, the vast magazines for gunpowder at Purfleet, the little town of Gray's Thurrock, and the fortifications at Tilbury-fort, enliven the prospect, though the line of coast still continues low and marshy. 
<p>On the Kentish side, below the Isle of Dogs, the river makes another sweep to reach Woolwich, which, besides the interest it excites as a dock-yard, is the principal arsenal for warlike stores in England, and now the head quarters of the royal artillery. The various important buildings belonging to this town, with the new Military Academy, and Shooter's hill in the distance, afford a striking contrast to the marshy grounds which succeed, and skirt the river for several miles, till the woody heights of Lesnes and Erith again give variety to the prospect. Near Erith commences that part of the river called Long-reach, where the homeward-bound East Indiamen generally anchor for a few days, to be lightened of some portion of their cargoes, and where the Darent silently mingles its waters with the Thames. 
<p>Another remarkable bend in the river, called, in its respective divisions, St. Clement's reach, and the South Hope, leads on to Northfleet, where the chalk rocks are excavated to a vast extent, and where many curious fossils have been found. At this place commences Gravesend-reach, so named from the corporate town of Gravesend, which lies directly opposite to Tilbury Fort, and communicates with the Essex shore by a horse ferry: the river is here about a mile in breadth. Many vessels are continually at anchor off Gravesend, as all outward-bound ships are obliged to <pb id="p.436" n="436"> stop here till visited by the Custom-house officers; and most of them take in their supply of live stock and vegetables from this town. 
<p>The river now rolls onward in a northerly course, bordered by an increasing tract of marshes, round the point of land at East Tilbury; but soon winding once more to the east, it forms the widened channel called the South Hope. Here the shores rapidly recede, and the majestic stream, flowing past the Isle of Canvey, and Shoebury Ness, on the Essex side, mingles its waters with the ocean at the Nore.<NOTE>The Nore is a sand bank lying in mid-channel, on which a floating light is constantly kept for the safety of the navigation of the river.</NOTE> On the Kentish side, between the extreme point of the Isle of Graine, and the fortress and dock-yard at Sheerness, the Medway pours forth its tributary flood, which is the last that the Thames receives before its junction with the sea; the distance between the opposite shores at the Nore is about <num value="7">seven</num> miles. 
<p>The tides flow up the Thames to the distance of between <num value="70">seventy</num> and <num value="80">eighty</num> miles from its mouth; and occur twice in every <num value="24">twenty-four</num> hours. 
<p>The fall of water in the Thames, from Oxford to Maidenhead, is about <num value="25">twenty-five</num> feet every <num value="10">ten</num> miles; from Maidenhead to Chertsey-bridge, <num value="22">twenty-two</num> feet every <num value="10">ten</num> miles; from Chertsey bridge to Mortlake, <num value="16">sixteen</num> feet every <num value="10">ten</num> miles; and from Mortlake to London, about <num value="1">one</num> foot per mile; afterwards the fall diminishes more gradually till the river unites with the sea. 
<p>The Thames westward has several locks, without which, owing to the great number of shoals, it would not be navigable in summer. The locks within the city's jurisdiction, according to a return made by order of the house of commons, yielded to the city a revenue of <measure value="13506l. 7s. 1d." type=Currency><num value="13506">13,506</num>l. <num value="7">7</num>s. <num value="1">1</num>d.</measure> for the year ending the <datestruct VALUE="1822-09-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>. Upwards of <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1000</num>l.</measure> had, however, to be deducted for incidental repairs. The profits of the locks have been a good deal injured by canals, yet the interests of the city have been protected; since we find in the same parliamentary return, that the Grand Junction Canal company paid to the city <measure value="600l." type=currency><num value="600">600</num>l.</measure> for compensation for loss of toll that year; and the Regent's Canal company <measure value="450l." type=currency><num value="450">450</num>l.</measure> 
<p>The plan of new cuts has been adopted in some places, to shorten and facilitate the navigation. There is <num value="1">one</num> near Lechlade, which runs nearly parallel to the old river, and contiguous to St. John's bridge; and there is another, a mile from Abingdon, which has rendered the old stream, towards Culham-bridge, useless. 
<p>A canal was made, in <datestruct value="1730--"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>, from the Severn to Wallbridge, near Stroud. A new canal now ascends by Stroud, <pb id="p.437" n="437"> through the vale of Chalford, to the height of <num value="343">three hundred and forty-three</num> feet, by means of <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> locks; and thence to the entrance of the tunnel, near Sapperton, a distance of nearly <num value="8">eight</num> miles, the canal is <num value="42">forty-two</num> feet in width at the top, and <num value="30">thirty</num> at the bottom. The tunnel, which passes under Sapperton-hill, and that part of earl Bathurst's grounds, called Haleywood, a distance of <num value="2">two</num> miles and <num value="3">three</num> furlongs, is <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet in width, and navigable with barges of <num value="70">seventy</num> tons. Descending hence by <num value="14">fourteen</num> locks, the canal joins the Thames at Lechlade, the level of which is <num value="134">one hundred and thirty-four</num> feet below the tunnel, and the distance upwards of <num value="20">twenty</num> miles. The whole extent of this vast undertaking is more than <num value="30">thirty</num> miles, and the expence of it exceeded the sum of <measure value="200000l." type=currency><num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> pounds</measure>. This canal was completed in <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>. 
<p>A similar communication with the northern and eastern parts of the island has been effected by means of the Grand Junction canal, extending from the Thames at Brentford, to a canal which unites the Trent and Mersey, with which it communicates at Braunston; and a branch from this canal has been lately opened from Bull's-bridge to Paddington, and from thence skirting the suburbs of the metropolis to Limehouse, where it enters the Thames. 
<p>To enumerate the many advantages which necessarily result from these artificial navigations between the metropolis and the ports of Bristol, Liverpool, Hull, &amp;c. as well as the principal manufacturing towns in the inland parts of the kingdom, would extend this digression from the immediate subject in question too far: it will, therefore, be sufficient to observe here, that as the promoting of commerce is the principal intention in making canals, their frequency in a nation must bear a proportion to the trade carried on in it. 
<p>The principal fish caught in this river, are sturgeon, (occasionally,) salmon, salmon-trout, tench, barbel, roach, dace, chub, bream, gudgeon, ruffe, smelts, eels, and flounders; the <num value="3">three</num> latter kinds are particularly good. 
<p>The bed of this fine river is either of gravel or clay, according to the nature of the soil through which it flows, and it produces, in different parts of its course, every species of fish found in the other rivers of Britain, except <num value="3">three</num>, viz. the burbot, the loach, and the samlet. 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1405"><year reg="1405">1405</year></datestruct>, sir John Woodcock, mayor, being informed that a great number of wears had been erected in the river, to the destruction of the young fry, and the damage of the navigation, caused all the wears, from Staines bridge to the river Medway, to be destroyed, and the nets burnt; which, by virtue of the city charter, was judged lawful, against the opposition made thereto by the archbishop of Canterbury. <pb id="p.438" n="438"> 
<p>In <datestruct value="1584--"><year reg="1584">1584</year></datestruct> the following orders were set forth during the mayoralty of sir Thomas Pullington.

<p>After all these laws, orders, and precautions for the preservation of the river Thames from annoyances, it has been frequently objected that they are deficient, or at least suspended, in regard to the many stops, dams, or locks, which are very numerous above bridge, as high as the Thames is navigable. But those locks are of great use to the public, without which, tradesmen and farmers, whose markets depend on water-carriage to and from the west of London could not carry on their business. 
<p>The Thames sometimes overflows its banks considerably in the metropolis. The most memorable instance of this sort was on the <datestruct VALUE="1555-09-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1555">1555</year></datestruct>, when in consequence of heavy rains and a <pb id="p.451" n="451"> high wind, the river was forced into the king's palace at Westminster, and into Westminster-hall, a circumstance particularly unfortunate, as it was the day on which the lord mayor of London had to present the sheriffs to the barons of the exchequer. Stow says,  <QUOTE>all Westminster-hall was full of water;</QUOTE>  but he does not inform us whether the city magistrates presented the sheriffs in a boat or not, though he informs us by report that morning, that <QUOTE>a wherrie-man rowed with his boate over Westminster-bridge<NOTE>The landing stairs at Old Palace-yard were so called</NOTE> into the palace court, and so through the staple-gate, and all the wooll staple into the king's streete.</QUOTE> All the marshes on the Lambeth side were also so overflowed, that  <QUOTE> the people from Newington church could not pass on foote, but were carried by boates from the said church to the Pinfold, neere to St. George's in Southwark.</QUOTE>  
<p>In <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct> there was another great overflow; and again on the <num value="2">2</num>d of <datestruct VALUE="1791-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>, when considerable damage was done to the wharfs along both sides of the river. Westminster, which always suffered most from an inundation of the Thames, saw boats plying, instead of hackney coaches, in Palace-yard and Privy-gardens. 
<p>In the winter of <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct> the Thames again burst its bounds; though neither promoted by an easterly wind, nor a sudden thaw. It appears by an official report presented by officers appointed to make a survey of the river, that the flood rose <num value="4">four</num> inches higher than it did in <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>, as recorded by a stone let into a wall at Shepperton. Considerable damage was done above Westminster bridge, yet the navigation of the river in the city district was never an hour impeded. 
<p>In <datestruct VALUE="1827-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, the tide rose several feet higher than usual, and entered the excavations forming for St. Katherine's dock, which it quickly filled; no particular damage was sustained. 
<p>Various amusements have, at different times, taken place on the Thames, adapted to the taste and character of the age. The water quintain has already been noticed; it has, however, ceased, and at present rowing and sailing matches seem the only sports with which it is occupied. Of these, <num value="1">one</num> of the most remarkable is the competition for a coat and silver badge, which Dogget the player appointed to be rowed for, annually, by <num value="6">six</num> watermen, on the <datestruct VALUE="-08-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, being the anniversary of the accession of the house of Hanover to the throne. The competitors set out on a signal given, at that time of the tide when the current is strongest against them, and row from the Old Swan, near London bridge, to the White Swan, in Chelsea. 
<p>A curious discovery was made by a fisherman, near Lambeth, about a century ago; on drawing in his net he found the great seal of England, which had been thrown into the Thames by James II. on his flight from Whitehall. 
<p>About <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct> or <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, another seal was drawn from the bed of <pb id="p.452" n="452"> the river, opposite Queenhithe; it was of silver and very thick, beautifully executed, and in fine condition.<NOTE>Engraved on the plan of the river Thames, p. <num value="430">430</num>. ante. An engraving of it is in Laing's plans of the Custom House and another in <BIBL>Hone's Every Day Book, vol. ii. col. <num value="881">881</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> It appears to have been the official seal of the port of London. 
<p>The jurisdiction of the lord mayor and corporation of London, over the Thames, extends from Colne-ditch, above Staines-bridge, in the west, to the Yenlet, or, as it is called in old deeds, Yenland versus mare, in the east, and includes part of the rivers Lea and Medway. 
<p>On the banks of the river, at Colne-ditch, not far from the church of Staines, stands what is called London mark-stone, which is the ancient boundary to the city jurisdiction on the Thames. On a moulding, round the upper part of the stone (which is much decayed by age) is inscribed  <QUOTE> God preserve the city of London. A. D. <datestruct value="1280"><year reg="1280">1280</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE>  This stone was, during the mayoralty of sir Watkin Lewes, knt. in <datestruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></datestruct>, placed on a new pedestal, on which is inscribed, that it was erected exactly over the spot where the old <num value="1">one</num> formerly stood.<NOTE>It is engraved in the plan of the river Thames, p. <num value="430">430</num>, <hi rend=italics>ante.</hi></NOTE>
 
<p>Not only the water of the Thames, with the fish therein, belongs to the city, but also the soil and ground of it, as appears from the following memorandum found among the manuscripts of Burleigh, lord treasurer in the reign of queen Elizabeth.  <QUOTE> Also, for proof of the prince's interest in rivers flowing from the sea, the Thames, and conservation thereof, was not only given to the city of London, but, by their special suit, the king gave therewithal the ground and soil under the same: whereupon, if any that hath a house or land adjoining, do make a strand, stairs, or such like, they pay, forthwith, a rent to the city of London, how high soever they be above the low-water mark.</QUOTE>  
<p>The lord mayor has a deputy, or substitute, called the water-bailiff, whose office is to search for, and punish such offenders as may be found infringing the laws made for the preservation of the river. He also holds <num value="4">four</num> courts of conservancy yearly, in the <num value="4">four</num> counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, and Kent, and impannels a jury of each county, to make inquisition of all offences committed on the said river, in order to proceed against those who may be found offending. 
<p>The account of the Thames cannot be better closed than with sir John Denham's admirable description of this river.

<p>At what period a bridge was <num value="1">first</num> erected over the Thames, between London and Southwark, seems doubtful. The <num value="1">first</num> notice of the existence of a bridge occurs in the laws of Ethelred II. which fix the tolls to be paid on all vessels coming up to the bridge. William of Malmsbury also mentions this bridge, in his account of the sieges which the city sustained on the invasion of England, by the Danes under Sweyn and Canute. That the bridge was erected between the years <datestruct value="993--"><year reg=993>993</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1016--"><year reg=1016>1016</year></datestruct>, may safely be inferred from the circumstance, that in the former year, Unlaf or Olaf, the Dane, is said to have sailed much higher up the river; and that, in the latter year, Canute's progress was impeded by it. <pb id="p.454" n="454"> 
<p>In the  <QUOTE> Chronicles of London bridge</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>P. <num value="21">21</num>, <num value="12">12</num> mo. <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>.</BIBL></NOTE> is an extract from the 
<title>Antiquitates Celto Scandiae</title>, referring to London bridge at so early a period as <datestruct value="1008--"><year reg="1008">1008</year></datestruct>.  <QUOTE>There was, at that time,</QUOTE>  says Suorro Sturlesonius, an icelandic writer of the <num value="13">13th</num> century,  <QUOTE>a bridge erected over the river between the city and Southwark, so wide, that if <num value="2">two</num> carriages met they could pass each other. At the sides of the bridge, at those parts which looked upon the river, were erected ramparts and castles that were defended on the top by pent-house bulwarks and sheltered turrets, covering to the breast those who were fighting in them; the bridge itself was also sustained by piles which were fixed in the bed of the river.</QUOTE>  
<p>Stow the historian attributes the building of this bridge to the brethren of the college of priests of St. Mary Overie; his account, which he received from Linstend, the last prior, is as follows: 
<p> <QUOTE>A ferrie being kept in a place where now the bridge is builded; at length the ferriman and his wife deceasing, left the same ferrie to their only daughter, a maiden, named Marie (Audery), which, with the goods left by her parents, as also with the profits arising of the said ferrie, builded a house of sisters, in a place where now standeth the east part of St. Marie Overie's church, above the queere, where she was buried; unto the which house she gave the oversight and profits of the ferrie: but afterwards the said house of sisters being converted into a college of priests, the priests builded the bridge of timber, as all other the great bridges of this land were; and from time to time kept the same in good reparations; till at length, considering the great charges of repairing the same, there was by ayd of the citizens of London, and others, a bridge builded with arches and stone.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Stow's Survey of London.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>There can be no doubt that prior Linstead exceeded the truth, by ascribing all the credit of so important a public benefaction to a small house of religious; who, with greater probability, only consented to the building of the bridge, upon sufficient consideration being made to them for the pecuniary loss of their ferry from which they received a considerable revenue. 
<p>Besides, it is evident beyond dispute, that so early as the <num value="22">22nd</num> Henry I. there were certain lands appropriated for the repairs of this bridge, as appears by a gift of <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure> per annum, out of the same, to the monks of Bermondsey, by Thomas Arden: nor could any such society, or petty monastery or college, ever be supposed capable of supporting such a bridge, which, besides other accidents, was burnt in <datestruct value="1136--"><year reg="1136">1136</year></datestruct>,<NOTE>See <BIBL>vol. i. p. <num value="54">54</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> though not totally destroyed; it was repaired, but decayed so rapidly, that in <datestruct value="1163--"><year reg="1163">1163</year></datestruct> it was so ruinous that it was obliged to be new built under the inspection of Peter an eminent architect, and chaplain or curate of St. Mary Colechurch,<NOTE>This church, previous to the great fire in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, stood on the north side of the Poultry.</NOTE> in London. <pb id="p.455" n="455"> 
<p>These continual and large expences in maintaining and repairing a wooden bridge becoming burthensome to the people, who, upon extraordinary occasions, when the lands appropriated for that use fell short in their produce, were taxed to make up the deficiencies: it was resolved to build a stone bridge, a little to the west of that wooden fabric, whose head, in the days of William I. pointed ashore at Botolph's wharf; and the management thereof was given to the abovementioned Peter, as all our historians agree.<NOTE><BIBL>Ann Waverl, <datestruct value="1176--"><year reg="1176">1176</year></datestruct>.</BIBL></NOTE> But this architect did not live to finish so great an undertaking, which, with great encouragement from the king, and Richard, archbishop of Canterbury, who gave <measure value="1000bmark" type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num> marks</measure> towards it, began to be erected in the <num value="22">22nd</num> Hen.

<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>John, by the grace of God, king of England, &amp;c. To his faithful and beloved the mayor and citizens of London, greeting- 
<p>Considering how the Lord in a short time has wrought, in regard to the bridges of Xainctes and Rochelle, by the great care and pains of our faithful, learned, and worthy clerk, Isenbert, master of the schools of Xainctes; we therefore, by the advice of our reverend father in Christ, Hubert, archbishop of Canterbury, and that of others, have desired, directed, and enjoined him to use his best endeavour in building your bridge, for your benefit, and that of the public; for we trust in the Lord, that this bridge, so necessary for you, and all who shall pass the same, will, through his industry, and the Divine blessing, soon be finished: wherefore, without prejudice to our right, or that of the city of London, we will and grant, that the rents and profits of the several houses that the said master of the schools shall cause to be erected upon the bridge aforesaid, be for ever appropriated to repair, maintain and uphold the same. 
<p>And seeing that the necessary works of the said bridge cannot be accomplished without your aid, and that of others; we charge and exhort you kindly to receive and honour the above-named Isenbert, and those employed by him, who will perform every thing to your advantage and credit, according to his directions, you affording him your joint advice and assistance in the premises; for whatever good office or honour you shall do to him, you ought to esteem the same as done to us. But, should any injury be offered to the said Isenbert, or the persons employed by him (which we do

 not believe there will) see that the same be redressed, as soon as it comes to your knowledge. 
<p>Witness myself at Molinel,<NOTE>In the province of Bourbon, France.</NOTE> the eighteenth day of April. 
</QUOTE>
 
<p>By this royal letter of recommendation of Isenbert to be architect or surveyor of the works of London-bridge, it appears that Peter of Colechurch must either have died in the year <datestruct value="1202"><year reg="1202">1202</year></datestruct>, or by age or incapacity was rendered unfit to superintend the direction of the bridge. <QUOTE>For I think,</QUOTE> says Maitland,  <QUOTE><p>it is not to be questioned but the mayor and citizens duly complied, and chose the said Isenbert surveyor of their bridge, pursuant to the said royal recommendation. Though I am apt to suspect, that the citizens were not altogether so complaisant; because it appears the same king, in the <num value="7">seventh</num> year of his reign, and <num value="3">three</num> years before the finishing of the stone bridge, taking the custody of London-bridge from the lord mayor, and granting it to <num value="1">one</num> Friar West,<NOTE>This ought to be brother Wasce, the king's almoner.</NOTE> and obliging the city to apply certain void places within its walls to be built on, and applied to the support thereof. Besides, there is not the least mention of any such surveyor in all our historians; who unanimously declare that the completing of the work was at Peter's death committed to the care of Serle Mercer, William Almaine, and Benedict Botewrite, merchants of London, who finished the <num value="1">first</num> stone bridge at London in the year <datestruct value="1209"><year reg="1209">1209</year></datestruct>. 
<p>The new bridge was erected a little westward of the former, <num value="926">926</num> feet long, <num value="40">40</num> in width, and about <num value="60">60</num> feet above the level of the water. It contained a drawbridge, and <num value="19">19</num> broad pointed arches, with massive piers, varying from <num value="25">25</num> to <num value="34">34</num> feet in solidity, raised upon strong elm piles, covered by thick planks bolted together.</QUOTE><NOTE><title>Chronicles</title>, p. <num value="75">75</num>.</NOTE>

<p>While Peter of Colechurch had the superintendence of the work, he at his own expence erected a chapel on the east side of the <num value="9">ninth</num> pier from the north end, and endowed the same for <num value="2">two</num> priests, <num value="4">four</num> clerks, &amp;c.

<p>This edifice, which was dedicated to St. Thomas a Becket, was a beautiful gothic structure, <num value="65">sixty-five</num> feet long, <num value="20">twenty</num> feet broad, and <num value="40">forty</num> feet in height.

The roof was originally formed of lofty pointed arches; though when it was transferred into a warehouse, a wooden ceiling of strong beams crossing each other in squares, was erected.<NOTE><BIBL><title>Chronicles</title>, p. <num value="84">84</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>The lower chapel was of the same chaste and correct order of architecture, it was paved with black and white marble, and in the middle was a sepulchral monument, under which it was supposed Peter of Colechurch was buried. Clusters of small pillars arose at equal distances on the sides, and bending over the roof, met in the centre of the arch, where they were bound together by large flowers cut in the same stone; between these pillars were the windows, which were arched, and afforded a view of the Thames on each side. It had an entrance from the river, as well as from the street, from which last there was a descent by a circular flight of stone steps. This venerable edifice remained nearly in its original form till the <pb id="p.458" n="458"> total demolition of the houses on the bridge, at which time it belonged to the occupiers of a dwelling-house erected above it, by whom it had been converted into a warehouse.<NOTE>The erection of chapels on bridges is of the highest antiquity, and, no doubt, originated from the custom of making sacrifices on bridges, whence Plutarch has derived the word Pontifex. The most remarkable bridge of this sort was at Droitwich, in Cheshire, where the high road passed through the chapel and divided the congregation from the reading-desk and pulpit.  The priests attached to the chapels were commissioned, as an indispensable part of their office, to keep the bridge in repair.</NOTE>
 
<p>This chapel, with its appurtenances, was in the year <datestruct value="1266"><year reg="1266">1266</year></datestruct>, given by Henry III. to the master, brethren, and sisters of St. Katherine, near the Tower of London, for the term of <num value="5">five</num> years.<NOTE><BIBL>Rec.

<p>In <datestruct value="1276--"><year reg="1276">1276</year></datestruct>, an order of the common council was made, by which it was ordained that there should not be kept a market on London bridge, nor in any other place, except those appointed for that purpose; also that no person should go out of the city to Southwark to buy cattle, or any wares which might be bought in the city, under the penalty of the forfeiture of the thing bought.<NOTE><BIBL>Liber Albus, fol. <num value="130">130</num>, a.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>Stow was of opinion, that, when this bridge was erected, the river Thames was turned into a large trench or canal made for that purpose; which he imagined had its outflux near Rotherhithe, and its influx near Battersea. But this conjecture has not the least foundation for its support; for that which led the author into this <pb id="p.459" n="459"> idea, are the vestigia of the canal supposed to have been made by Canute, when he laid siege to London.<NOTE>See <BIBL>p. <num value="44">44</num>, vol. i.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>Yet, after all the art and charge used and expended in the building of the stone bridge, the citizens did not find themselves so much eased as might have been expected; for in <datestruct value="1280--"><year reg="1280">1280</year></datestruct>, about <num value="70">seventy</num> years after its completion, it was so ruinous, that they were obliged to apply for relief and assistance to king Edward I. for its repairs; who in the <num value="9">ninth</num> year of his reign granted to the bridge keeper a brief or licence to ask and receive the charity of his well-disposed subjects throughout the kingdom towards repairing the same, in this form: 
<p><QUOTE lang=la>Rex omnibus Ballivis & Fidelibus suis, ad quos, &amp;c. Salutem. Dolentibus nobis</QUOTE>, &amp;c. Which is translated by Mr. Maitland, as follows: 
<p> <QUOTE>The king, to all his bailiffs, and liege subjects, to whom these presents shall come, greeting. It hath been lately represented unto us, and it grieves us to see, that London-bridge is in so ruinous a condition, that, unless it be speedily repaired, it must inevitably fall down; and the great number of inhabitants dwelling thereon are in great danger of being destroyed; and that the work, which taken in time, may now be prevented from falling, shall for want of sufficient help be reduced to so wretched a condition, as not to be recovered out of its ruins. Wherefore we, who are bound to take care of, and by all gentle means to provide for, both the public and private good, and affectionately to embrace those whom we perceive to be in need of our assistance, and to receive them under our royal protection. We command and require you, that, when the keepers of the said costly bridge aforesaid, or their messenger, or agent, shall come to you, authorized by our special licence and protection, to collect every where throughout the realm the assistance of our pious and well-disposed subjects, you do admit them friendly at the contemplation of God, and in regard of charity, and for shew of devotion, on this behalf; not bringing on them, or permitting to be brought, wrongs, molestations, lost hindrance, or evance; and if any damage be done them, that ye make them amends without delay; and that when the said keepers, or their messengers, shall apply for your assistance in the repairs of the said bridge, ye shall cheerfully contribute thereto, according to your respective abilities. And let each of you strive to out-run the other in such great works of charity; for which ye must needs merit of God, and have our thanks. In witness whereof, &amp;c. Witness the king at Walsingham, the <datestruct VALUE="-01-8"><day reg="8">eighth</day> day of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>.</QUOTE>  
<p>Besides these general letters patent, we find others recorded in particular to the clergy of all degrees, earnestly pressing their contribution to so laudable and necessary a work, and to exhort the people thereto. But, not finding this method effectual to raise a <pb id="p.460" n="460"> sufficient fund for so expensive a work, his majesty, the next year, issued out other letters patent for taking customs or toll of all commodities in London, to be applied to the repairs of the bridge, in this form: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote lang=la>Rex Majori suo London. Cum nuper propter subitum, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 
<p>In English thus: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Whereas lately, by reason of the sudden ruin of London-bridge we commanded, that, associating to you <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of the most discreet and loyal men of the city aforesaid, ye should take, until our parliament after Easter next past, for the supply of the reparation of the aforesaid bridge, a certain custom; as in these letters patents, which we have caused to be made from that time to you, more fully is contained; we, being willing that the taking of the said customs be continued longer, command you, that from the feast of Margaret the virgin next coming, unto the end of <num value="3">three</num> years next following, to be completed, ye take the under-written custom of the aforesaid bridge: to wit, of every man on foot bringing merchandize, or other things saleable, and passing over the said bridge, and he taking himself to other parts, <num value="1">one</num> farthing; of every horseman passing that bridge, and he taking himself to other parts, as aforesaid, with merchandize, or other saleable things, <num value="1">one</num> penny; of every saleable pack, carried and passing over the bridge, <num value="1">one</num> halfpenny. Nor will we, in the mean time, that any thing be taken there on this occasion, but in the subsidy of the reparation of the bridge: and our will is, that the foresaid custom shall cease, and become void at the full end and term of <num value="3">three</num> years. Witness the king at Chester, the <datestruct VALUE="-07-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> day of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>.<NOTE><BIBL>Pat. <num value="9">9</num> Edw.

<p>And to prevent any evasion of this royal grant and command, his majesty issued a further order to the mayor, and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of the most discreet and loyal citizens associated with him, to take the same custom of a penny for every horseman, and a halfpenny for every pack, as above, which should pass between London and Southwark, on either side of the said bridge, towards the expence of its reparation. 
<p>The same toll or customs, it appears, were continued for the repairs of the bridge in the <num value="27">27th</num> and <num value="30">30th</num> years of Edward I. And the briefs or letters patents for gathering contributions for the same purpose were again issued, both to the people in general, and to the clergy in particular, in the <num value="14">14th</num> of Edward II. 
<p>In <datestruct value="1305--"><year reg="1305">1305</year></datestruct>, the <num value="34">34th</num> year of the reign of Edward I. the king granted a patent of pontage or bridge tax,  <QUOTE>in aid of repairing and sustaining the bridge of London</QUOTE>  for <num value="3">three</num> years. It is a long but comprehensive charter, and mentions many commodities of the present day, viz. for every <hi rend=italics>poise</hi>,<NOTE><BIBL><num value="2561">2561</num>b.</BIBL></NOTE> or weight of cheese, fat of tallow, and butter for sale, <measure value="1d." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>d.</measure>; of every <num value="100">hundred</num> of barley, <measure value="1d." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>d.</measure>; for every <num value="100">100</num> weight of sugar, or liquorice, <measure value="1d." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>d.</measure>; for every pound of dates, <pb id="p.461" n="461"> saffron and cotton, <num value="1">one</num> farthing; for every <num value="100">100</num> weight of copper, brass, and tin, <measure value="1d." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>d.</measure>; for every <num value="100">100</num> ells of linen coming from ports beyond the sea, <measure value="1d." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>d.</measure>; for every horse of a price of <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num> shillings</measure> or more, <measure value="1d." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>d.</measure>; if less, an halfpenny, for <num value="10">ten</num> sheep, an halfpenny, for every cart freighted with fish, <measure value="1d." type=currency><num value="1">1</num>d.</measure> &amp;c.<NOTE><BIBL>Chron. of London, Br. p. <num value="157">157</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>In the <num value="10">10th</num> Edward I. a grant was made to Henry de Walleis, mayor, and the citizens, of a waste piece of ground on the north side of the church yard of St. Mary Woolchurch; as also another piece, on which now stand those buildings, called the Old Change, near the east end of St. Paul's Churchyard; and a piece of ground, near the convent of the Friars Minors, in Grey-Friars, was granted to the same mayor and citizens by Edward III. for the repairs of this bridge: which several grants confirm the opinion, that the city had then recovered and maintained its ancient right to the custody of the bridge, and management of its revenues and repairs. 
<p>The tower, at the north side of the drawbridge, contrived to give passage for ships with provision to Queenhithe, and to resist the attempts of an enemy, was begun to be built in the year <datestruct value="1426"><year reg="1426">1426</year></datestruct>, in the mayoralty of John Reinwell. 
<p>About <num value="10">ten</num> years after, <num value="2">two</num> of the arches at the south end, together with the bridge-gate, fell down, and the ruins being suffered to remain, <num value="1">one</num> of the locks, or passages for the water, was almost rendered useless; whence it received the name of the rock-lock, and is frequently taken for natural rock. The other buildings on the bridge increased very slowly, for in <datestruct value="1471--"><year reg="1471">1471</year></datestruct>, when Thos. Falconbridge, the bastard, besieged it, there were no more than <num value="13">thirteen</num> houses, besides the gate, and a few other small buildings. In Stow's time, both sides were built up; so that the whole length had the appearance of a large well-built street; there being left on purpose only <num value="3">three</num> openings, with stone walls, and iron gates over them, for a prospect, east and west, on the Thames. 
<p>The property belonging to this bridge must have been considerable. Among the Harleian MSS. is a book entitled,  <QUOTE> A repertory by way of survey, of all the forren landes belonging to London bridge, together with all the quitt rents due to, and after rents due from the same.</QUOTE>  It is in Latin, and appears to have been written in the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century.<NOTE>Considerable extracts from this volume are printed in the <BIBL><title>Chronicles of London bridge</title>, p. <num value="252">252</num>-<num value="256">256</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> In the same volume is an account of the  <QUOTE>Quit rents of London bridge, arising from divers tenements of London and Southwark,</QUOTE>  from which it appears that the gross amount of the latter was <measure value="30l. 8s. 2d." type=Currency><num value="30">30</num>l. <num value="8">8</num>s. <num value="2">2</num>d.</measure> <hi rend=italics>per annum</hi>, a considerable sum at the period of taking the survey, which the ingenious author of the <title>Chronicles</title> conceives was about the middle of the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century.<NOTE>Also printed in the <BIBL><title>Chronicles</title>, p. <num value="256">256</num>-<num value="267">267</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> The disbursements of London bridge, were, however <pb id="p.462" n="462"> considerable, and the offices of bridge-keepers were situations of considerable note and profit. 
<p>In the <num value="5">5th</num> year of Edward IV. <datestruct value="1465--"><year reg="1465">1465</year></datestruct>, Peter Alford and Peter Caldecote, wardens of London-bridge, paid, on account of the same, the sum of <measure value="731l." type=currency><num value="731">seven hundred and thirty-one</num> pounds</measure>, <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure> and <num value="3">three</num> half-pence.

<p>In <datestruct VALUE="1579-09--"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1579">1579</year></datestruct>, a new tower was erected on the Southwark side of the bridge, in addition to the <num value="1">first</num> gate or tower, called the traitor's gate, from the heads of state delinquents being set up on the top of it.

And the citizens, soon experiencing the benefit of this invention, granted him a like lease <num value="2">two</num> years after for another arch. By which means he grew very wealthy; and it continued in his family, under various improvements, until the year <datestruct value="1701"><year reg="1701">1701</year></datestruct>, when the property was sold to Richard Soams, citizen and goldsmith Moris having <num value="1">first</num>, at the purchaser's request, obtained another lease of the <num value="4">fourth</num> arch, for the further improvement of the said works, after selling the whole property thereof for <measure value="36000l." type=currency><num value="36000">36,000</num>l.</measure> Mr. Soams, to prevent all disputes with the citizens, then applied to the city for a confirmation of his bargain with Moris, and obtained a fresh lease from them for the term unexpired of Moris's lease, at the yearly rent of <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure>, and <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">300</num>l.</measure> fine.

<p>In <datestruct VALUE="1817-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>, the managers of the waterworks gave notice they were going to rebuild their largest water wheel; but on <datestruct VALUE="1822-07-26"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=26>26</day>, <year reg=1822>1822</year></datestruct>, an act was passed for their entire removal, with a view of improving London-bridge, or erecting a new <num value="1">one</num>.

<p>Stow's account of this fire is as follows:  <QUOTE> At the latter end of the year <datestruct value="1632"><year reg="1632">1632</year></datestruct>, viz on the <datestruct VALUE="-02-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> <month reg="02">Feb.</month></datestruct> between <num value="11">eleven</num> and <num value="12">twelve</num> at night, there happened, in the house of <num value="1">one</num> Briggs, a needle-maker, near St. Magnus church, at the north end of the bridge, by the carelessness of a maid servant, setting a tub of hot sea-coal ashes under a pair of stairs, a sad and lamentable fire, which consumed all the buildings before <num value="8">eight</num> of the clock the next morning, from the north end of the bridge, to the <num value="1">first</num> vacancy on both sides, containing <num value="42">forty-two</num> houses; water being then very scarce, the Thames being almost frozen over. Beneath, in the vaults, and cellars, the fire remained burning and glowing a whole week after. After which fire, the north end of the bridge lay unbuilt for many years; only deal boards were set up on both sides, to prevent people's falling into the Thames, many of which deals were, by high winds, blown down, which made it very dangerous in the nights, although there were lanthorns and candles hung upon all the cross beams that held the pales together.</QUOTE>  
<p>In the Gentleman's Magazine for <datestruct VALUE="1824-11--"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>, is a communication from Mr. Upcott of the London Institution, containing an extract from an original manuscript journal of remarkable providences, from <datestruct value="1618--"><year reg="1618">1618</year></datestruct> to about <datestruct value="1636--"><year reg="1636">1636</year></datestruct>, kept by <num value="1">one</num> Nehemiah Wallington, a puritan, citizen and turner, of London, who lived in Little Eastcheap, and who was evidently a friend of Prynn and Bastwick, having been examined concerning them before the Star Chamber.  <QUOTE>This MS. which is in my possession,</QUOTE>  says Mr. Upcott, <QUOTE>is a <num value="4">4</num>to. volume, of <num value="517">517</num> pages, written in the small print hand of the <num value="17">17th</num> century, and is entitled  <Q>A Record of the Mercies of God, or a Thankfull Remembrance.</Q> </QUOTE> 
<p>The account of this fire is particularly curious. <QUOTE><p>On the XI of February (being Monday) <datestruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>, began by God's iust hand a fearefull fire in the house of <num value="1">one</num> Mr. John Brigges neere tenn of the clocke att night; it burnt doun his house and the next house, with all the goods that were in them, and as I heere that Briggs, his wife, childe, and maid, escaped with their lives. The fire burned so fearcely, that it could not be quenched till it had consumed all the houses on both sides of the way from St. Magnus church to the <num value="1">first</num> open place. And although there was water enough very neere, yet they could not safely come at it; but all the conduittes neere were opened, and the pipes that carried the water through the streets were cut open, and ye water swept doun with broomes with help enough, but it was the will of God it should not prevaile. For the <num value="3">three</num> engines, which are such excellent things, that nothing that ever was devised could do so much good; yet none of these did prosper, for they were all broken, and the tide was verie low, <pb id="p.469" n="469"> that they could get no water, and the pipes that were cut yielded but littel. Some ladders were broke to the hurt of many: for several had their legges broke, some their armes, and some their ribes, and many lost their lives. This fire burnt fiercely all night and part of the next day, till all was destroyed and pulled down to the ground; yet the timber, wood, and coales in the sellers could not be quenched all that weeke, till the Tuesday following in the afternoone the xix of February; for I was then there my selfe, and a live cole of fire in my hand which burnt my fingers. Notwithstanding there were as many night and day as could labour <num value="1">one</num> by another to carry away timber, and brickes, and tiles, and rubbish cast doune into the liters [lighters.] So that on Wednesday the bridge was cleared that passengers might goe over. 
<p>At the beginning of this fire as I lay in my bed and heard ye sweeping of the channels and crying for  <Q> water-water.</Q>  I arose about <num value="1">one</num> of the clocke and looked downe Fish-street-Hill, and did behold such a fearefull and dreadfull fire, vaunting it selfe over the tops of houses like a captaine florishing and displaying his banner, and seeing so much means and little good it did, it made me think of that fire which the Lord threteneth against Jerusalem for the breach of his sabbath-day. Jeremiah xvii, verse <num value="27">27</num>. 
<p>I did heer that on the other side of the bridge the brewers brought abundance of water in vessels on their draies, which did much good. Had the wind been as high as it was a weeke before, I think it would have indangered ye most part of the Citie: for in Thamesstreet there is much pitch, tarre, rosen, and oyle in their houses. Therefore as God remembers mercy in justice, let us remember thankfullnesse in sorrow.

<p>In <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>, there was a most extraordinary phenomena, viz. <num value="2">two</num> tides at London-bridge within an hour and a half. From a rare tract of <num value="4">four</num> leaves, a copy of which is in the British Museum,<NOTE><BIBL>Vol. <num value="43">43</num>, collection of Tracts presented to the British Museum, by George III.</BIBL></NOTE> the following is extracted:-- 
<p> <QUOTE>Fryday, Februarie <num value="4">4</num>, <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>, it was high water at <num value="1">one</num> of the clocke at noone--a time by reason so accommodated for all imployments by water or land-very fit to afford witnesse of a strange and notorious accident. After it was full high water, and that it flowed its full due time, as all almanacks set downe; and watermen, the unquestionable prognosticators in that affaire, with confidence mainetaine it stood a quiet still dead water a full houre and a halfe, without moving or returning in any way never so little: yea, the watermen flung in stickes to the streme, as near as they could guesse, which lay in the water as upon the earth, without moving this way or that. Dishes, likewise, and wodden buckets, they set a swimming, but it proved a stilling, for move they would not, any way, by force of stream or water, so that it seemed the water was indeed asleepe or dead, or had <pb id="p.471" n="471"> changed or borrowed the stability of the earth. The watermen, not content with this evidence, would needs make the utmost of the tryall, that they might report with the more boldnesse, the truth of the matter; and with more credible confidence they tooke their boates, and lanched into the streame or very channell; but the boates that lay hailed up on the shore, moved as much, except when they used their oares; nay--a thing worthy the admiration of all men--they rowed under the very arches, tooke up their oares, and slept there, or, at least, lay still an houre very neare, their boates not so much as moved through any way, either upward or downward; the water seeming as plaine, quiet, even, and stable as a pavement under the arch, where, if any where in the Thames, there must be moving, by reason of the narrownesse of the place. In this posture stood the water a whole houre and halfe, or rather above, by the testimony of above <num value="500">five hundred</num> watermen on either side the Thames, whom not to believe in this case were stupiditie, not discretion. At last, when all men expected its ebb, being filled with amazement that it stood so long as hath been delivered, behold a greater wonder--a new tyde comes in! A new tyde with a witnesse, you might easily take notice of him; so lowde he roared, that the noise was guessed to be about Greenwich, when it was heard so, not onely clearly, but fearfully to the bridge; and up he comes, tumbling, roaring and foaming in that furious manner, that it was horror unto all that beheld it.. And as it gave sufficient notice to the eare of its comming, so it left sufficient satisfaction to the eye, that it was now come, having raised the water foure foote higher than the <num value="1">first</num> tyde had done, foure foote by rule! as by evident measure did appear, and presently ebbed in as hasty, confused, unaccustomed manner. See here, reader! a wonder, that-all things considered--the oldest man never saw or heard of the like.</QUOTE>  
<p>The next curious item respecting the bridge is a  <QUOTE>proposition</QUOTE>  to shoot, as out of a gun, boats with a man or boy in them, from <num value="1">one</num> side of the bridge to the other, without injury to boat or person. This the projector states in manner following; and heads his project with  <QUOTE>Propositions in the office of assurance, London, for the blowing up of a boat and man over London-bridge.</QUOTE>  
<p> <QUOTE>In the name of God, amen. John Bulmer, of London, esquire, master and surveior-generall of the king's majestie's mines royall, and engines for water-workes, propoundeth-by God's assistance --that he, the said John Bulmer, shall and will, at, and in a flowing water, set out a boat or vessell, with an engine, floating with a man or boy in and aboard the said boat, in the river of Thames, over against the Tower-wharfe, or lower, which said boat, with the said man or boy in or aboard her, shall the same tide, before low water againe, by art of the said John Bulmer, and helpe of the said engine, be advanced and elevated so high, as that the same shall passe and be delivered over London-bridge, together <pb id="p.472" n="472"> with the said man or boy in and aboard her, and floate againe in the said river, on the other side of the said bridge in safety.</QUOTE>  
<p>He then solicits an ample subscription to enable him to exemplify his project, but, it appears, without success; for in <datestruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></datestruct>, he proposes the following modification of his scheme, namely, 
<p> <QUOTE>The blowing up of a gun from under the water, by the breath of a man's mouth, shall occasion the raising of such boate or vessell; which said gun shall then forthwith after be discharged by fire given thereunto, and presently sink againe; after the sinking whereof, another gunne shall be raised by such means as aforesaid, which shall be discharged also forthwith upon the floating of the said boat or vessel on the other side of the said bridge,</QUOTE>  
<p>Nobody, it seems, was willing to be exploded in any such manner, and the end of the project was an appeal to the public, including a certificate of his ability to perform several of his projects, from Emanuel college, Cambridge, and ending with a copy of most lamentable verses, vindicating himself from his detractors. 
<p> <QUOTE>In the years <datestruct value="1645--"><year reg=1645>1645</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1646--"><year reg=1646>1646</year></datestruct>,</QUOTE>  says Mr. Maitland,  <QUOTE> several houses were rebuilt of timber, in a very substantial and beautiful manner, some of <num value="3">three</num> stories high, besides cellars, contrived within and between the piers; and stately platforms, leaded, and railed with ballasters, over the houses. But Mr. Howell, in the </QUOTE>  Londonopolis'  <QUOTE>bewails that the whole ruins were not then rebuilt, there being no object, as he writes, (after the church of St. Paul, then in a ruinous condition) that would conduce more to the glory and ornament of this renowned city. Forasmuch as this bridge may be called the bridge of the world, taken together in all its parts and appendages.</QUOTE>  
<p>Nor had this ornament and glory of the city recovered from its ruinous condition in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, when again it suffered in the general conflagration. Most of the buildings thereon being totally consumed, except a few at the south end, and the chapel: and the very stone-work, upon which they stood, was so battered and weakened thereby, that it cost the bridge-house <measure value="1500l." type=currency><num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> pounds</measure> to make good the damage of the piers and arches, before the leaseholders could attempt to rebuild the premises destroyed by the fire. 
<p>But the stone-work was no sooner secured, than a sufficient number of tenants offered; who conditioned with the bridgehouse for building-leases of <num value="61">sixty-one</num> years, at the rate of <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure> per foot running, yearly, and to build after such a form and substantial manner, as was prescribed: which was carried into execution so vigorously, that in <num value="5">five</num> years the north end was all completely finished, with houses <num value="4">four</num> stories high, and a street of <num value="20">twenty</num> feet broad between side and side. And then, in order to make the south end answerable thereto, the lord mayor, aldermen, and commoners, appointed for the letting of the city and <pb id="p.473" n="473"> bridge-house lands, measuring how many feet every proprietor had in the front of his house, considering what annual rent he paid to the bridge-house, and what number of years his lease had yet to run; then calling over those whose leases were expired, and those whose leases were near expiring; they treated with the proprietors to engage them to rebuild in the same form as the houses were finished at the north end of the bridge; purchasing at avaluable consideration such of the premises, as the tenants were not able to build; and allowing to those who agreed to build, not only a longer time to some of their leases, but an abatement of the rent, answerable to the cost of their rebuilding; besides laying out <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">one thousand</num> pounds</measure> on the repairs of the piers and arches, on which the new houses were to be erected. In which state, completed in about <num value="5">five</num> years more, Mr. Maitland says <QUOTE>this bridge was the admiration of all that beheld it; and, if considered in its houses, <reg orig=nhabitant>inhabitants</reg>, and the trade carried on amongst them, we may pronounce it the most stately bridge in the whole world, and justly deserving the following encomium:

</TABLE>
 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1746"><year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct> the lord mayor, aldermen, and common council, considering the many lives that were lost through the narrowness' of the arches, and the enormous size of the sterlings, which took up <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4">fourth</num> of the water-way, and occasioned the fall, at low water, to be no less than <num value="5">five</num> feet, as well as the great expence of repairing the bridge, which for several years had amounted to <measure value="2000l." type=currency><num value="2000">two thousand</num> pounds</measure> per annum, came to a resolution to take down the houses entirely, and to widen <num value="1">one</num> or more of the arches. 
<p>An act of parliament for the above purposes being obtained, in the year <datestruct value="1756"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>, orders were immediately given for taking down the houses on both sides of the bridge, and a temporary wooden bridge was erected upon the western sterlings, for the passage of carriages as well as persons on foot, till the intended alterations were completed. This was opened in <datestruct value="1757--"><year reg="1757">1757</year></datestruct>. This temporary bridge was destroyed by fire, <datestruct VALUE="1758-04-11"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=11>11</day>, <year reg=1758>1758</year></datestruct>, but the interruption to the communication was not of long continuance, the damage being <pb id="p.479" n="479"> repaired in less than <num value="3">three</num> weeks. Another act of parliament was shortly after passed, for granting the city <measure value="15000l." type=currency><num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> pounds</measure> towards carrying on the work, which was completed in a short time, as it now appears; the <num value="2">two</num> center arches of the old bridge having been thrown into <num value="1">one</num>, for the convenience of vessels passing through. This alteration was carried into effect by sir Robert Taylor, architect to the Bank of England, and Mr. Dance, surveyor of the Board of Works. 
<p>On the opening of the great arch, the excavation around and under the sterlings was so considerable, that the bridge was thought to be in great danger of falling. Mr. Smeaton, the engineer, was then in Yorkshire, but an express was sent for him and he arrived with the utmost despatch; when the apprehensions of the bridge falling were so general, that few persons would pass over or under it. Mr. Smeaton having ascertained the state of the sterlings, and called the committee together, recommended that they should re-purchase the stones that had been taken from the middle pier, then lying in Moorfields, and throw them into the river to guard the sterlings. Nothing shews the fears entertained for the stability of the bridge more than the alacrity with which his advice was adopted. The stones were repurchased that day, and on the following morning, though Sunday, the work commenced; which, in all probability, preserved the bridge from falling, and secured it until more effectual methods could be taken. 
<p>By a survey of the bridge, made in the year <datestruct value="1730"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>, it appeared, that the exterior part of the foundation, on which the stone piers are laid, consisted of huge piles of timber, driven close together, on the top of which were laid large planks, <num value="10">ten</num> inches in thickness, whereupon the bases of the stone piers were laid, <num value="3">three</num> feet below the sterlings, and <num value="9">nine</num> feet above the bed of the river. 
<p>It likewise appeared, that the lowermost layers of the original stones were bedded in pitch, instead of mortar, which appears to have been done with a view of preventing the water from damaging the work, till it was advanced above the high water mark; for the modern method of building within a caissoon, as was successively practised at the erecting of the bridges at Westminster and Blackfriars, was then totally unknown. 
<p>The income of the bridge-masters, in <datestruct value="1786--"><year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct>, appears to have been as follows: for the senior <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">100</num>l.</measure> <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure>--the junior <num value="861">861</num>. <measure value="7s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="7">7</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure>, and the rental at Christmas, <datestruct value="1785--"><year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct>, was <measure value="8280l." type=currency><num value="8280">8280</num>l.</measure> Is. <measure value="4d." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>d.</measure>  In <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct> London bridge again became the subject of considerable inquiry and speculation. From the report made by the select committee upon the improvement of the port of London, it appears that after a minute survey of the bridge by Mr. Dance, the clerk of the works, that gentleman was convinced that provided the sterlings were kept in repair the structure was likely to stand for ages. The average cost of its repairs had exceeded <measure value="4200l." type=currency><num value="4200">4200</num>l.</measure> annually for the last <num value="6">six</num> years, and the wardens account for the same period varied <pb id="p.480" n="480"> from <measure value="9772l." type=currency><num value="9772">9772</num>l.</measure> <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>s.</measure> <hi rend=italics>l <measure value="0.50d." type=currency><num value="0.50">1/2</num>d.</measure></hi> to <measure value="24848l." type=currency><num value="24848">24,848</num>l.</measure> <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> <hi rend=italics><measure value="4.50d." type=currency><num value="4.50">4 1/2</num>d.</measure></hi> Attached to this report is an interesting plan of London bridge, taken <datestruct VALUE="1799-07-2"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=2>2</day>, <year reg=1799>1799</year></datestruct>; a reduced copy of which is engraved in the plate.<NOTE><BIBL>P. <num value="467">467</num> <hi rend=italics>ante.</hi></BIBL></NOTE>

A design by the same engineer for a stone bridge, to be erected about <num value="40">40</num> yards above the ancient bridge, on the east side of Fishmongers'-hall, to consist of <num value="5">five</num> elliptical arches, the centre being <num value="160">160</num> feet span, and <num value="80">80</num> feet high, the succeeding <num value="2">two</num> <num value="140">140</num> feet span, and <num value="75">75</num> feet high, and the outer <num value="2">two</num> <num value="120">120</num> feet span, and <num value="70">70</num> in height. The whole was to be adorned with statues, columns, &amp;c. and the estimated expence was <measure value="350000l." type=currency><num value="350000">350,000</num>l.</measure><NOTE><BIBL>Ibid. plate iii.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p><num value="3">3</num>. Design for a large centre arch constructed of cast iron, with granite piers by Mr. S. Wyatt.<NOTE>Neither drawing nor estimate was sent in by this architect.</NOTE>
 
<p><num value="4">4</num>. This design was furnished by Mr. Robert Mylne (afterwards architect of Blackfriars-bridge,) who proposed a bridge of <num value="5">five</num> arches, the centre being <num value="60">60</num> feet above high high water mark, and <num value="150">150</num> feet wide.<NOTE>Ibid.</NOTE>
 
<p><num value="5">5</num>. Mr. Thomas Wilson, architect of the celebrated bridge at Bishops Wearmouth, near Sunderland, made a design of a bridge of cast iron, of <num value="3">three</num> arches; the centre <num value="1">one</num> being <num value="240">240</num> feet span, and <num value="65">65</num> feet high, and the <num value="2">two</num> others of <num value="220">220</num> feet, breadth of roadway <num value="45">45</num> feet, and estimate for the iron work alone <measure value="55061l." type=currency><num value="55061">55,061</num>l.</measure><NOTE>Engravings of his plan. sections, &amp;c. are in plate viii. of the work before referred to.</NOTE>
 
<p>Designs Nos. <num value="6">6</num>, <num value="7">7</num>, and <num value="8">8</num>, were furnished by Mr. Telford and Mr. James Douglas; the <num value="1">first</num> idea was <hi rend=italics>to</hi> diminish the ascent by increasing the length of the bridge on the Surrey side, and by placing the largest arch nearest the city shore. Their estimate, including some important improvements along the banks of the river, amounted to <num value="9881541">988,1541</num>.; in a subsequent design they placed the great arch in the centre, the other design being particularly objectionable on account of its awkward appearance, and the inconvenience of its navigation. 
<p><num value="9">9</num>. This design was by the <num value="2">two</num> last architects, and proposed a bridge of cast iron, to consist of <num value="5">five</num> arches decorated with statues, trophies, &amp;c. The principal arch to be l<num value="80">80</num> feet span, and <num value="65">65</num> feet <pb id="p.481" n="481"> high. The estimates for this bridge and approaches to the wharfs on either side was <num value="10548041">1,054,8041</num>. 
<p>The last design was sent in by Mr. George Dance, architect to the city, and professor of architecture, in the Royal Academy. His design was to erect <num value="2">two</num> parallel bridges, with drawbridges for the passage of vessels, the space between the bridge was to be <num value="300">300</num> feet, furnished with mooring chains for securing the ships in tiers. Each end of the edifice was to be formed into a semicircular area, and the estimate, including the approaches, was <measure value="1279714l." type=currency><num value="1279714">1,279,714</num>l.</measure> 
<p>The committee ultimately recommended the re-building the bridge of iron, with acentre arch of at least <num value="65">65</num> feet above high water. Subsequently the committee considered the propriety of erecting an iron bridge of <num value="1">one</num> arch, <num value="600">600</num> feet span and <num value="65">65</num> feet in height, but from the diversity and contrary opinions given by many mathematicians and engineers, on the practicability of erecting such a structure, this design was ultimately abandoned. 
<p>On the conclusion of the great frost of <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, which did considerable damage to London bridge, the inquiry as to erecting a new bridge was recommenced. Messrs. Dance, Chapman, Alexander, and Montague, proposed substituting <num value="4">four</num> arches for <num value="8">eight</num> of the present, the expence of which they estimated at <measure value="92000l." type=currency><num value="92000">92,000</num>l.</measure>; but upon examining <num value="1">one</num> of the piers it was found to be impracticable. 
<p>In <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct> a select committee of the house of commons was appointed to inquire into the propriety of erecting a new bridge as near as conveniently to the old <num value="1">one</num>; and after a laborious investigation and a survey of the river from the present bridge to Old Swan Stairs, a bill was introduced into parliament to erect a new bridge and provide for approaches, which, on <datestruct VALUE="1823-07-4"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=4>4th</day>, <year reg=1823>1823</year></datestruct>, received the royal assent. By this act the corporation were to receive the sum of <measure value="150000l." type=currency><num value="150000">150,000</num>l.</measure> from the treasury, additional funds being raised on credit of the bridge-house estates by mortgages, annuities, bonds, &amp;c. The <num value="1">first</num> pile was driven near the southern end of the old bridge, <datestruct VALUE="1824-03-15"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=15>15</day>, <year reg=1824>1824</year></datestruct>. 
<p>The works are carried on by Mr. Rennie, the son of the eminent architect, who erected Waterloo bridge and made the design for the new London bridge; the contract for building the bridge is <measure value="506000l." type=currency><num value="506000">506,000</num>l.</measure> of which sum <measure value="42000l." type=currency><num value="42000">42,000</num>l.</measure> was given by the treasury in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, for making the bridge <num value="6">six</num> feet wider than the original design. The form of the bridge is a flat segment, with <num value="5">five</num> elliptical arches, having plain rectangular buttresses standing upon plinths and <num value="2">two</num> straight flights of stairs, <num value="22">twenty-two</num> feet wide at each end.

<p>It was expected that, in excavating the new foundation, several interesting antiquities would be discovered, but, exclusive of the silver statue of Harpocrates mentioned before,<NOTE><BIBL>Vol. i. p. <num value="32">32</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> little of value has been discovered. The most numerous have been defaced. brass and copper coins of Augustus, Vespasian, and later Roman emperors, Nuremburgh counters, ancient iron keys, and silver spoons; also a spear head engraven on the shaft, and a dagger, which had once been gilt. The principal of these antiquities are in the possession of R. F. Newman, esq. and some curious dates are in the city library. 
<p>On Wednesday, the <datestruct VALUE="1825-06-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, the <num value="1">first</num> stone of the new bridge was laid; as the ceremonial was of an interesting description, a full and circumstantial account is presented. 
<p>At an early hour of the morning of <datestruct VALUE="-06-15"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=15>15th</day></datestruct>, the vicinity of the new and old bridges presented an extraordinary appearance of activity and preparation. 
<p>So early as <datestruct value="12"><year reg="12">twelve</year></datestruct> o'clock, the avenues leading to the old bridge were filled with individuals, anxious to behold the approaching ceremony, and shortly afterwards the various houses, which form the streets through which the procession was to pass, had their windows graced with numerous parties of well-dressed people. St. Magnus' church on the bridge, St. Saviour's church in the Borough, Fishmongers'-hall, and the different warehouses in the vicinity, had their roofs covered with spectators; platforms were erected in every nook from whence a sight could be obtained. 
<p>The wharfs on the banks of the river, between London bridge and Southwark bridge, were occupied by an immense multitude. Southwark bridge was crowded, and the river from thence to London bridge presented the appearance of an immense dock covered with vessels of various descriptions.<NOTE><BIBL>Hone's Ever Day Book, vol. i. col. <num value="779">779</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 <pb id="p.483" n="483"> 
<p>At <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock London bridge was wholly closed, and at the same hour Southwark bridge was thrown open, free of toll. At each end of London bridge barriers were formed, and no persons were allowed to pass, unless provided with tickets, and these only were used for the purpose of arriving at the cofferdam. 
<p>At <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock, the barrier at the foot of the bridge on the city side of the river was thrown open, and the company, who were provided with tickets' for the coffer-dam, were admitted within it, and kept arriving till <num value="2">two</num> o'clock in quick succession. At that time the barriers were again closed, and no person was admitted till the arrival of the chief procession. By <num value="1">one</num> o'clock, however, most of the seats within the coffer-dam were occupied, with the exception of those reserved for the persons connected with the procession. 
<p>The interior of the works was highly creditable to the bridge committee. Not only were the timbers, whether horizontal or upright, of immense thickness, but they were so securely and judiciously bolted and pinned together, that the liability of any danger or accident was entirely done away with.  <QUOTE> The very awning,</QUOTE>  says Mr. Hone, who was present at this interesting ceremony,  <QUOTE>which covered the whole coffer-dam, to ensure protection from the sun or rain, had there been any, was raised on a little forest of scaffolding poles, which, any where but by the side of the huge blocks of timber introduced immediately beneath, would have appeared of an unusual stability. In fact, the whole was arranged as securely and as comfortably as though it had been intended to. serve the time of all the lord mayors for the next century to come, while on the outside, in the river, every necessary precaution was taken to keep off boats, by stationing officers there for that purpose.</QUOTE>  
<p>The interior of the coffer-dam was ornamented with as much taste and beauty as the purposes for which it was intended would possibly admit. The entrance to the platform from the bridge, was fitted up with crimson drapery, tastefully festooned. The coffer-dam itself was divided into <num value="4">four</num> tiers of galleries, along which several rows of benches, covered with scarlet cloth, were arranged for the benefit of the spectators. It was covered with canvass to keep out the rays of the sun, and from the transverse beams erected to support it, which were decked with rosettes of different colours, were suspended flags and ensigns of various descriptions, brought from Woolwich yard; which by the constant motion in which they were kept, created a current of air, which was very refreshing. The floor of the dam, which is <num value="45">45</num> feet below the high water mark, was covered, like the galleries, with scarlet cloth, except in that part of it where the <num value="1">first</num> stone was to be laid. The floor is <num value="95">95</num> feet in length, and <num value="36">36</num> in breadth; is formed of beech planks, <num value="4">four</num> inches in thickness, and rests <pb id="p.484" n="484"> upon a mass of piles, which are shod at the top with iron, and are crossed by immense beams of solid timber. By <num value="2">two</num> o'clock all the galleries were completely filled with well-dressed company, and an eager impatience for the arrival of the procession was visible in every countenance. The bands of the horse guards, red and blue, and also that of the artillery company, played different tunes, to render the interval of expectation as little tedious as possible. In the mean time the arrangements at Guildhall being completed, the procession moved from the court-yard, in the following order:--

<p>The procession moved up Cornhill, and down Gracechurchstreet, to London-bridge, where they arrived at about a quarter past <num value="4">four</num> o'clock. Soon afterwards, several aldermen were seen winding in their scarlet robes through the mazes of the staircase, and in a very few minutes a great portion of these dignified elders of the city made their appearance on the floor below, the band above having previously struck up the <title>Hunters' Chorus</title> from 
<title lang=de>Der Freischutz.</title> Next in order entered a strong body of the common-councilmen, who had gone to meet the procession on its arrival at the barriers. Independently of those that made their appearance on the lower platform, glimpses of their purple robes with fur trimmings were to be caught on every stage of the scaffolding, where many of them had been stationed throughout the day. After these entered the recorder, the common sergeant, the city solicitor, the clerk, the chamberlain, and other officers. These were followed by the duke of York and the lord mayor, advancing together, the duke being on his lordship's right hand. His royal highness was dressed in a plain blue coat with a star, and wore at his knee the garter. They were received with great cheering, and proceeded immediately up the floor of the platform, till they arrived opposite the place where the <num value="1">first</num> stone was suspended by a tackle, ready to be swung into the place that it was destined to occupy for centuries. Opposite the stone, an elbowed seat had been introducedinto the line of bench, so as to afford a marked place for the chief magistrate, without breaking in upon the direct course of the seats. His lordship, who was in his full robes, offered the chair to his royal highness, which was positively declined on his part. The lord mayor, therefore, declined seating himself, and stood supported on the right by his royal highness, and on the left by Mr. alderman Wood. The lady mayoress, with her daughters in elegant dresses, sat near his lordship, accompanied by <num value="2">two</num> fine-looking intelligent boys, her sons; near them were the <num value="2">two</num> lovely daughters of lord Suffolk, and many other fashionable and elegantly dressed ladies. In the train which arrived with the lord mayor and his royal highness, were the earl of Darnley, lord J. Stewart, the right hon. C. W. Wynn, M. P., sir G. Warrender, M.P., sir I. Coffin, M. P., sir G. Cockburn, M. P., sir R. Wilson, M. P., Mr. T. Wilson, M. P., Mr. W. Williams, M. P., Mr. Davies Gilbert, M. P., Mr. W. Smith, M. P., Mr. Holme Sumner, M. P., with several other persons of distinction, and the common-sergeant, the city pleaders, and other city officers. 
<p>The lord mayor took his station by the side of the stone, attended by <num value="4">four</num> gentlemen of the committee, bearing, <num value="1">one</num> the glass-cut bottle to contain the coins of the present reign, the <pb id="p.486" n="486"> <num value="2">second</num> an English inscription incrusted in glass; the <num value="3">third</num> the mallet, and the <num value="4">fourth</num> the level. 
<p>The sub-chairman of the committee, bearing the trowel, took his station on the side of the stone, opposite the lord mayor. 
<p>The engineer, John Rennie, esq. took his place on another side of the stone, and exhibited to the lord mayor the plans and drawings of the bridge. 
<p>The members of the committee of management presented to the lord mayor the cut-glass bottle which was intended to contain the several coins. 
<p>The ceremony commenced by the children belonging to the ward's schools of Candlewick, Bridge, and Dowgate, singing  <QUOTE>God save the king.</QUOTE>  They were stationed in the highest eastern gallery for that purpose; the effect produced by their voices stealing through the windings caused by the intervening timbers to the depth below was very striking and peculiar. The duke of York joined in the national air with great enthusiasm. 
<p>The chamberlain delivered to his lordship the several pieces of coin; his lordship put them into the bottle, and deposited the bottle in the place whereon the foundation stone was to be laid. 
<p>The members of the committee bearing the English inscription on glasses, presented it to the lord mayor. His lordship deposited it in the subjacent stone. 
<p>Mr. Jones, sub-chairman of the Bridge Committee, who attended in purple gowns and with staves, presented the .lord mayor, on behalf of the committee, with an elegant silver-gilt trowel,<NOTE>Engraved in the <BIBL>Chronicles of London bridge, p. <num value="651">651</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> embossed with the combined arms of the  <QUOTE>Bridge-house estate and the City of London,</QUOTE>  and bearing on the reverse an inscription of the date, and design of its presentation to the right honourable the lord mayor, who was born in the ward, and is a member of the guild wherein the new bridge is situated. This trowel was designed by Mr. John Green, of Ludgate-hill, and executed by Messrs. Green, Ward, and Green, in which firm he is partner. Mr. Jones, on presenting it to the lord mayor, thus addressed his lordship: 
<p> <QUOTE>My lord; I have the honour to inform you that the committee of management has appointed your lordship, in your character of lord mayor of London, to lay the <num value="1">first</num> stone of the new London bridge, and that they have directed me to present to your lordship this trowel, as a means of assistance to your lordship in accomplishing that object.</QUOTE>  
<p>The lord mayor having signified his consent to perform the ceremony, Henry Woodthorpe, esq. the town-clerk, who had lately obtained the degree of LL.D., held the copper plate about to be placed beneath the stone, with the following inscription upon it, composed by Dr. Coplestone, master of Oriel-college, Oxford; and late professor of poetry in that university. <pb id="p.487" n="487">

<p> <QUOTE>It is unnecessary for me to say much upon the purpose for which. we are assembled this day, for its importance to this great commercial city must be evident; but I cannot refrain from offering a few observations, feeling as I do more than ordinary interest in the accomplishment of the undertaking, of which this day's ceremony is the primary step. I should not consider the <pb id="p.489" n="489"> present a favourable moment to enter into the chronology or detailed history of the present venerable structure, which is now, from the increased commerce of the country, and the rapid strides made by the sciences in this kingdom, found inadequate to its purposes, but would rather advert to the great advantages which will necessarily result from the execution of this national work. Whether there be taken into consideration the rapid, and consequently dangerous, currents arising from the obstructions occasioned by the defects of this ancient edifice, which has proved destructive to human life and to property, or its difficult and incommodious approaches and acclivity, it must be a matter of sincere congratulation that we are living in times when the resources of this highly favoured country are competent to a work of such great public utility. If ever there was a period more suitable than another for embarking in national improvements, it must be the present, governed as we are by a sovereign, patron of the arts, under whose mild and paternal sway (by the blessing of divine providence) we now enjoy profound peace; living under a government, by whose enlightened and liberal policy our trade and manufactures are in a flourishing state; represented by a parliament, whose acts of munificence shed a lustre upon their proceedings : thus happily situated, it is impossible not to hail such advantages with other feelings than those of gratitude and delight. I cannot conclude these remarks without acknowledging how highly complimentary I feel it to the honourable office I now fill, to view such an auditory as surrounds me; among whom are the illustrious prince, heir presumptive to the throne of this kingdom, many of his majesty's ministers, several distinguished nobles of the land, the magistrates and commonalty of this ancient and loyal city, and above all (that which must ever enlighten and give splendor to any scene) a brilliant assembly of the other sex, all of whom, I feel assured, will concur with me in expressing an earnest wish that the new London-bridge, when completed, may reflect credit upon the architects, prove an ornament to the metropolis, and redound to the honour of its corporation. I offer up a sincere and fervent prayer, that in executing this great work there may occur no calamity; that in performing that which is most particularly intended as a prevention of future danger, no mischief may occur with the general admiration of the undertaking.</QUOTE>  
<p>The lord mayor's address was received with cheers. His lordship then spread the mortar, and the stone was gradually lowered by <num value="2">two</num> men at a windlass. When finally adjusted, the lord mayor struck it on the surface several times with a long-handled mallet, and proceeded to ascertain the accuracy of its position, by placing a level on the top of the east end, and then to the north, west and south; his lordship passing to each side of the stone for that purpose, and in that order. The city sword and mace were then placed on it in saltier; the foundation of the new London-bridge was declared to be laid; the music struck up the national <pb id="p.490" n="490"> anthem; and <num value="3">three</num> times <num value="3">three</num> excessive cheers broke forth from the company; the guns of the honourable artillery company, on the Old Swan wharf, fired a salute by signal, and every face wore smiles of gratulation. <num value="3">Three</num> cheers were afterwards given for the duke of York; <num value="3">three</num> for old England; and <num value="3">three</num> for the architect, Mr. Rennie. 
<p>It was observed in the coffer-dam as a remarkable circumstance, that as the day advanced, a splendid sun-beam, which had penetrated through an accidental space in the awning above, gradually approached towards the stone as the hour for laying it advanced, and during the ceremony shone upon it with dazzling lustre. 
<p>The lord mayor, with the duke of York, then retired in the same form as he arrived, and returned to the Mansion-house, where he gave agrand dinner in the Egyptian-hall, to <num value="376">376</num> guests; the duke of York being engaged to dine with the king, could not attend. 
<div2 type=section id="c.16.1"><HEAD>Westminster Bridge.</HEAD>
 
<p>An act of parliament was passed in the year <datestruct value="1736"><year reg="1736">1736</year></datestruct>, for building a bridge across the Thames, from New Palace-yard Westminster, to the opposite shore in the county of Surrey. This act was not obtained without great opposition from some of the inhabitants of the city of London and the borough, and also from the watermen of the Thames; but private interest was obliged to give way to public advantage, and this great undertaking was carried into effect under the sanction of the legislature. 
<p>The ballast-men of the Trinity-house were employed to open a large hole for the foundation of the <num value="1">first</num> pier, to the depth of <num value="5">five</num> feet under the bed of the river; and this being finished and levelled at the bottom, it was kept clear by a proper enclosure of strong piles. In the mean time, a strong case of oak, called a caissoon, was prepared, of the form and dimensions of the intended pier in the clear: this was made water-proof, and, being brought over the place, was secured within the piles. 
<p>In this wooden case the <num value="1">first</num> stone was laid on the <datestruct VALUE="1738-01-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct>-<num value="9">9</num>, by the earl of Pembroke. The caissoon was above the high-water mark, and sinking gradually by the weight of the prodigious blocks of stone, the men could work below the level of the water, as conveniently as on dry ground. Thus the middle pier was <num value="1">first</num> formed, as were all the rest in the same manner, and when finished, the sides of the caissoon being taken asunder, the stone work appeared entire. 
<p>The last stone of the bridge was laid on the <datestruct VALUE="1750-11-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>, by Thomas Lediard, esq. in presence of several of the commissioners; and on the <num value="17">17th</num> of the same month, about <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock at night, it was opened by a procession of several <pb id="p.491" n="491"> gentlemen of the city of Westminster, the chief artificers of the work, and a great number of spectators, preceded by trumpets, kettledrums, &amp;c. 
<p>Westminster-bridge is generally allowed to be <num value="1">one</num> of the finest in the world. It was built by Mr. Charles Labelye, a native of Switzerland, but a naturalized subject of England, and consists of <num value="13">thirteen</num> semicircular arches, besides a small <num value="1">one</num> at each end. The ascent to <hi rend=italics>it</hi> is very easy, and there is a semi-octangular recess over every pier, with benches in them for the accommodation of passengers.<NOTE> <QUOTE>The alcoves on this bridge have another convenience,</QUOTE>  says the author of the <BIBL>Percy History of London,</BIBL>  <QUOTE>besides that of affording a shelter from the rain. When a person whispers against the wall of <num value="1">one</num> of them, the sound is very distinctly conveyed across to the corresponding alcove on the opposite side. <num value="2">Two</num> friends may thus carry on a very pleasant <foreign lang=fr>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;--t&ecirc;te</foreign>, at <num value="40">forty</num> feet distance from each other.</QUOTE> </NOTE> <num value="12">Twelve</num> of them are covered over head with semi-domes, viz. the <num value="2">two</num> middle and <num value="2">two</num> extreme ones on each side. These recesses are supported by solid buttresses rising from the foundations, which form the angular extremities of the piers below. Over the central arch are pedestals in the balustrades, intended for groups of ornamental figures, which were never carried into execution. The dimensions of this noble structure are as follow:

</TABLE>
 
<p>At the sides of each abutment, there are large flights of steps down to the river, for the embarking and landing of goods and passengers. 
<p>The foundation of this bridge is laid on a solid and firm mass of gravel, which lies at the bottom of the bed of the river, but at a much greater depth on the Surrey than on the Westminster side; and this inequality of the ground required the heights of the several piers to be very different, as some have their foundations laid at <num value="5">five</num> feet, and others at <num value="14">fourteen</num> feet under the bed of the river. The piers are all <num value="4">four</num> feet wider at their foundation than at the top, and are founded on the bottoms of the before-mentioned caissoons. 
<p>The materials of the piers are much superior to those commonly used on such occasions; the inside is generally filled up with <pb id="p.492" n="492"> chalk, small stones, or rubbish ; but here, the piers are the same within as without, and consist of solid blocks of Portland-stone, many of which are <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> tons weight, and none less than a ton, except the closers, or small ones, intended for fastening the others, <num value="1">one</num> of which is placed between every <num value="4">four</num> of the larger ones. These blocks are perfectly well wrought for uniting; they are laid in Dutch terrace, and fastened together with iron cramps run in with lead. All the iron-work is, however, entirely concealed, and so situated as not to be in the least affected by the water.<NOTE><BIBL>Lambert's London, vol. iii, p. <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">20</num>l.</measure></BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The soffit of every arch is turned and built quite through, the same as the fronts, with large Portland blocks, over which is built, bounded in by the Portland, another arch of Purbeck stone, <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> times thicker on the reins than over the key; so calculated, that, by the help of this secondary arch, together with the incumbent load of materials, all the parts of every arch are in equilibrio. Thus each arch can stand singly, without affecting or being affected by any of the others. Between every <num value="2">two</num> arches, there is also a drain, so contrived as to carry off the water and filth, which in time might penetrate, and accumulate, in those places, to the great detriment of the building. 
<p>Though the greatest care was taken of laying the foundation deep in the gravel, and using every probable method to prevent the sinking of the piers, yet all this was in some degree ineffectual; for <num value="1">one</num> of them sunk so considerably, when the work was near completed, as to retard the <hi rend=italics>finishing</hi> it a considerable time. <hi rend=italics>This</hi>
 gave <hi rend=italics>the highest satisfaction to those who had opposed the</hi> work; but the commissioners immediately ordered the arch, on the side where it had been sunk, to be taken down; and then caused the base of the pier to be loaded with an incredible weight of iron cannon, till all the settlement that could be forced was made. After this the arch was rebuilt, and has ever since been equally secure with the rest. The whole expence of erecting this bridge amounted to <num value="389000">three hundred and eighty-nine thousand</num>, <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">five hundred</num> pounds</measure>; which was raised as follows:

<p>This bridge was built in pursuance of an act of parliament passed in the beginning of the year <datestruct value="1756"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>, by which the lord mayor, aldermen, and council were empowered to erect a bridge, and to levy a toll on all carriages, horses, and foot passengers, crossing it, for defraying the expence. 
<p>A committee was shortly after appointed to receive plans and proposals for the undertaking, and to superintend its execution, who, after examining several designs, gave the preference to that produced by Mr. Mylne; and the <num value="1">first</num> pile was driven in the middle of the river on the <datestruct VALUE="1760-06-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>.

 Over each pier of the bridge is a recess, or balcony, supported below by <num value="2">two</num> Ionic pillars, and <num value="2">two</num> pilasters, which stand on a semicircular projection of the pier, above high-water mark. These pillars give an agreeable lightness to the appearance of the bridge on either side. The bridge spreads open at the extremities, the footways rounding off on each side, by which an agreeable and useful access is formed on the approach of it. At each end are <num value="2">two</num> flights of stone steps, defended by iron rails, for the conveniency of taking water. 
<p>The wooden frames on which the arches of this bridge were turned, were very ingeniously contrived for strength and lightness, <pb id="p.495" n="495"> allowing a free passage for boats under them while standing. A curious model of <num value="1">one</num> of the arches of Blackfriars bridge, in mahogany, showing the construction of the wood-work under it, with the foundations of the piers below, is preserved in the British Museum. 
<p>The total expence of erecting this bridge was <measure value="260000l." type=currency><num value="260000">260,000</num>l.</measure> a small sum when compared with Westminster, and still more with other bridges erected at a later period. 
<p>During the time employed in erecting this bridge, a temporary wooden <num value="1">one</num> was laid over the river, for the accommodation of passengers, as well as for the sake of the toll, by which a considerable sum was raised while the work was carrying on, and a great accumulation of debt prevented. This prudent measure, with the care and attention of the bridge committee, in the management of the revenues arising from the toll, enabled them to pay the whole expence of the building in less than <num value="20">twenty</num> years after it was finished, with a toll less than half what they were allowed to take by act of parliament. 
<p>As the opening of this bridge entirely ruined a Sunday ferry, established at this place for the benefit of the poor of the fraternity of watermen, the bridge committee agreed to transfer <measure value="13650l." type=currency><num value="13650">13,650</num>l.</measure> consolidated <num value="3">3</num> <hi rend=italics>per cents.</hi> to the rulers of the company by way of recompence for the loss; the interest of which is now appropriated to the same uses as the profits which were derived from the ferry. To defray the expence of lighting, watching, cleansing, and repairing this bridge, there is a particular fund set apart consisting of a small balance of consolidated <num value="3">3</num> <hi rend=italics>per cent</hi>, annuities, left after payment of the expence of erecting the bridge, the rent of some premises, and <measure value="15000l." type=currency><num value="15000">15,000</num>l.</measure> raised by bonds on the credit of the Orphan's fund, by virtue of an act passed in the <num value="52">52</num> George III. and assigned to the chamberlain for this special purpose. 
<p><hi rend=italics>Waterloo Bridge.</hi>
  This bridge, which is unquestionably the noblest in Europe, was originally projected by Mr. George Dodd, an eminent engineer. The original plan was to erect a temporary bridge of wood, which would have been accomplished for a comparatively small sum ;and from the profit, which would have been immense, to erect a stone bridge; but the city of London opposed that plan in parliament for <num value="3">three</num> successive sessions at an enormous expence to the company, who were finally compelled to abandon their project of a temporary wooden bridge, and to undertake the building <num value="1">one</num> of stone. For this purpose they increased their capital from <num value="1">one</num> to <measure value="500000l." type=currency><num value="500000">five hundred thousand</num> pounds</measure>. So sanguine was the company of ample remuneration from the toll for their advance of capital, that the additional sum of <measure value="400000l." type=currency><num value="400000">four hundred thousand</num> pounds</measure> was immediately raised among themselves, and the shares were at a guinea premium next day. <pb id="p.496" n="496"> 
<p>Accordingly in <datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct> an act of parliament was passed, incorporating a company to be called  <QUOTE> The Company of Proprietors of the Strand<NOTE>By an act of parliament, in <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, the name was changed to Waterloo.</NOTE> Bridge,</QUOTE>  and to enable them to build a stone bridge from some part of the precinct of the Savoy, to the opposite shore at Cuper's bridge in Lambeth. Before commencing the purchase of houses or land, <measure value="60000l." type=currency><num value="60000">60,000</num>l.</measure> was to be invested in <num value="3">three</num> per cent. stock, and <measure value="300000l." type=currency><num value="300000">300,000</num>l.</measure> was to be actually subscribed. 
<p>Mr. Dodd having been dismissed the company's service, they employed the late lamented John Rennie, the ablest engineer of the day, who, with much skill and unremitting attention, brought to a conclusion a work which will remain a monument to his ability, and of the liberality and public spirit of the proprietors.

<p>Waterloo, or Strand Bridge, as it was <num value="1">first</num> called, consists of <num value="9">nine</num> elliptical arches, each of <num value="120">120</num> feet span, and <num value="35">35</num> feet elevation. 
<p>The whole of the outside courses of the bridge is Cornish granite, except the balustrades which are of Aberdeen granite; and the stones, like those of the temple of Solomon, were cut to their form before they were brought to the spot. 
<p>There are <num value="320">320</num> piles driven into the bed of the river under each pier; the length of each pile was from <num value="19">19</num> to <num value="22">22</num> feet, and the diameter about <num value="13">13</num> inches; there is <num value="1">one</num> pile to every yard square. 
<p>The scientific manner in which the centres were constructed was admirable; and as all the arches are of the same size, the centres were removed from those that were finished, and placed on the piers where the arches were not yet thrown; this was an operation that required great skill and care, and was ably executed. 
<p>When the centres were removed, so solidly and well was the masonry constructed, that in the middle they only sunk about <num value="1">one</num> inch. Those of the Pont le Neuilly in France, <num value="6">six</num> miles from Paris, which are nearly similar, sunk about <num value="18">18</num> inches in the middle, after the centres were taken away. 
<p>In circular arches, such as those of Westminster and Blackfriars bridges, the pressure on the centres before the key stones are put in place, is not near so great as in elliptical arches like those of Waterloo. 
<p>The toll-lodges, <num value="2">two</num> at each end of the bridge, are neat buildings <pb id="p.498" n="498"> in the Doric style. There are turn-stiles attached to each (intended to admit the passage of <num value="1">one</num> person only at a time), at every movement of which some machinery, connected with an index in the toll-house, is worked, and, the index being secured in a locked box, the number of persons who have passed may be known by those in possession of the key, at any period of the day. 
<p>The rapidity with which this great work was erected is not the least remarkable feature in its history. The foundation stone was laid on old Michaelmas day, in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, and on the <datestruct VALUE="1816-06-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, the <num value="1">first</num> anniversary of the battle of Waterloo, the glorious memory of which it is designed to commemorate, it was opened with great pomp by the prince Regent in person, accompanied by his royal brother, the duke of Wellington, and along train of persons of the <num value="1">first</num> distinction. 
<p><hi rend=italics>Southwark Bridge.</hi>
  The great extension of buildings in the borough of Southwark, St. George's Fields, and other parts on the south of the river bearing immediately on London bridge and Blackfriars, and consequent increase in the thoroughfare over these bridges, suggested the expediency of erecting an intermediate <num value="1">one</num> from the bottom of Queen-street, Cheapside.<NOTE>The projectors of the undertaking were at the pains to obtain an accurate account of the persons, vehicles, and horses, that passed over these <num value="2">two</num> bridges in the course of a day, and the following were the returns; the <num value="1">first</num> taken on the <datestruct VALUE="-10-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, and the <num value="2">second</num> on the <num value="22">22</num>d of <datestruct VALUE="1810-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>.

<p>The proprietors of this bridge conceived that a small toll would make an ample return for the capital required for its erection. A toll of <num value="1">one</num> penny from that proportion of foot-passengers alone would produce upwards of <measure value="60000l." type=currency><num value="60000">60,000</num>l.</measure>, which would be more than sufficient to pay <num value="15">fifteen</num> per cent on a capital of <measure value="400000l." type=currency><num value="400000">400,000</num>l.</measure>, for which sum Mr. Rennie estimated that a bridge of cast-iron with stone piers might be executed, which though of less costly materials, would. rival in magnificence and splendour that of Waterloo itself. 
<p>An act of parliament was accordingly obtained in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, for the erection of the proposed bridge; but a provision was inserted, that operations should not be commenced until <measure value="300000l." type=currency><num value="300000">300,000</num>l.</measure> of the <measure value="400000l." type=currency><num value="400000">400,000</num>l.</measure> admitted to be required were subscribed. The unexpected calls which had been made on the Waterloo bridge company had however so far damped the ardour for such speculations, that <num value="3">three</num> <pb id="p.499" n="499"> years elapsed before the requisite sum was made up, and the work actually began. 
<p>The Southwark bridge consists of <num value="3">three</num> immense arches of cast iron; the span of the centre <num value="1">one</num> is <num value="240">two hundred and forty</num> feet,<NOTE>Exceeding the celebrated arch of Sunderland by <num value="4">four</num> feet.</NOTE> and of the <num value="2">two</num> side ones <num value="210">two hundred and ten</num>. The weight of iron work is more than <num value="5308">5,308</num> tons. The abutment is of fine masonry connected by dowels to prevent its sliding; and rests on gratings of timber supported by oblique piles. The piers stand on foundations <num value="9">nine</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> feet below the present bed of the river, and are abundantly secured by a flooring of timber, <num value="2">two</num> feet and a half thick, placed on piles. 
<p>The subscribers are allowed by their act of incorporation to receive <num value="10">ten</num> per cent. annually on their shares; and the remainder of the receipts is to be laid by and to accumulate until it shall become sufficient to pay each proprietor double the sum he subscribed, after which the bridge is to be made free to the public. 
<p><hi rend=italics>Thames Tunnel.</hi>
  An attempt was made in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct> to excavate a passage under the Thames a little below Rotherhithe, upon a very small scale, and was what, in the language of miners, is called a driftway. Its capacity was <num value="5">five</num> feet high by <num value="2">two</num> feet <num value="9">nine</num> inches wide, supported by timber only. No serious difficulty was met with for nearly the whole breadth of the river. They proceeded <num value="945">nine hundred and forty-five</num> feet without any obstacle of importance. Then indeed a considerable body of quicksand came in. This obstruction however was soon overcome; and the work proceeded <num value="81">eighty-one</num> feet farther, when it was impeded by a <num value="2">second</num> irruption of sand, within <num value="130">one hundred and thirty</num> feet of the termination of their distance. This <num value="2">second</num> obstruction was surmounted also, and the work was resumed; but the time allowed for the operation being nearly expired, besides which, the ground where it was to commence having been appropriated to the Commercial dock, and a misunderstanding having arisen among the proprietors, it was determined to abandon the undertaking. 
<p>Nothing occurred in this attempt calculated to throw a damp on the work; for, even supposing a quicksand were to have been met with, it was clear (from the slender means which proved effectual to stop it then,) that it would soon be overcome. 
<p>In the present undertaking, there is very little analogy with the excavation attempted to be formed in <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>. Instead of an excavation <num value="5">five</num> feet by <num value="2">two</num> feet <num value="9">nine</num> inches, the excavation is <pb id="p.500" n="500"> <num value="37">thirty-seven</num> feet by <num value="22">twenty-two</num>; no wooden props are used, and a strong brick waterproof arch closely follows the excavation. 
<p>In <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, the formation of the tunnel became an object of deep consideration with Mr. Brunel, the engineer, well known as the inventor of the block machinery at Portsmouth, and many other important works; and his inventive faculty, so ably displayed elsewhere, at last discovered and constructed a machine, where the mechanic powers were so combined as to promise complete success, in the <num value="2">two</num> great objects of supporting the ground, and protecting the men while at work. 
<p>He communicated his invention to his friends; and in the beginning of <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>, a number of gentlemen were convened to consider and examine the plans; and all agreed they were not only practicable, but very likely to be crowned with success. 
<p>It was resolved to form a Company, to carry the same into execution under Mr. Brunel's superintendence. An Act of Parliament was applied for to incorporate the Company, which was granted without opposition; and on the <num value="2">2</num>d of <datestruct VALUE="1825-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, accompanied by many scientific gentlemen, laid the foundation stone, with appropriate ceremony. 
<p>The foundation was laid on a wooden horizontal curb, shod with strong cast iron; and on reaching the top, at the height of <num value="40">forty</num> feet, there was also placed a wooden curb; and the <num value="2">two</num> curbs were connected and fastened together by iron rods passing through the brick work. The ground within was then removed, and this immense structure or tower was found to sink regularly for about <num value="33">thirty-three</num> feet, when it came to a bed of clay, where it stuck fast; thus the tower became a shaft.--The interior of it was further deepened as much as was thought necessary, and it was underpinned for a foundation. The shaft sunk in this manner may be truly said to be the greatest work of the kind ever attempted. 
<p>The shield constructed for protecting the workmen, by supporting the ground in all directions, consists of <num value="12">twelve</num> frames of strong cast iron, each independent of its neighbour, and altogether weighing upwards of <num value="120">120</num> tons; they are <num value="3">three</num> feet wide, and <num value="20">twenty</num> feet high, occupying the whole space from the bottom to the top of the excavation. Each frame is divided into <num value="3">three</num> floors or stories; in each of which a man is placed, to excavate the ground immediately opposed to him; so that they are calculated to contain <num value="36">thirty-six</num> men. All the <num value="3">three</num> men will proceed at nearly the same rate, and their task may be finished at the same time. The frames are then either all at once, or separately, moved forward; for doing which, screws are attached to them, bearing on the brickwork. 
<p>The frames being raised and lowered at pleasure, by screws. press against the top, and support the ground there: and being provided in front with small moveable boards, kept tight by screws pressing them forward, the pressure of the ground in that <pb id="p.501" n="501"> quarter is resisted, except just at the spot where the workman is cutting. When they have cut away the breadth of <num value="1">one</num> board, they put it up again in its place, and screw it tight and remove another, where they again operate until all the ground opposed to their division of the frame is removed; the frames are thus moved forward, and the bricklayers build the tunnel close up to them. 
<p>The tunnel consists of a square mass of brick work <num value="37">thirty-seven</num> feet by <num value="22">twenty-two</num>, containing in it <num value="2">two</num> archways or passages, each of the width of <num value="16">sixteen</num> feet <num value="4">four</num> inches; each carriage road is <num value="13">thirteen</num> feet <num value="6">six</num> inches wide, and <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet <num value="6">six</num> inches high: and each has a foot-path <num value="3">three</num> feet wide. There is a central line of arches to separate the <num value="2">two</num> passages, some of them so wide that carriages may go from <num value="1">one</num> line of the tunnel to the other. The length of the tunnel will be about <num value="1300">one thousand three hundred</num> feet. 
<p>The works had proceeded a considerable distance under the river, viz <num value="420">420</num> feet, when a dreadful alarm was created on the evening of <datestruct VALUE="-05-18"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=18>18</day></datestruct>, in consequence of the water bursting into the Tunnel from above, while upwards of <num value="120">120</num> workmen were engaged below. For some days previous, the earth through which the miners were boring, was of such a description as to admit a leakage from the river of <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> gallons a minute; but as they were approaching a more favourable soil, no apprehensions of any danger were entertained until about <num value="6">six</num> in the evening, when the men engaged at the extremity of the excavation, observed the leakage to increase rapidly; and in a few moments afterwards a portion of the earth gave way, and the water rushed down in a torrent. The workmen fled towards the shaft in the greatest terror, while the water rushed after them with great rapidity. They ascended the ladder <num value="5">five</num> at a time, and succeeded in reaching the top in safety, all but <num value="1">one</num> individual, who was missing for a few minutes; he was soon, however, observed struggling in the shaft, where it had by this time risen to a considerable height. Mr. Brunel, jun. quickly descended to his aid, and succeeded in rescuing him from his perilous situation, at the moment that his strength was almost exhausted. From calculations made by the engineer, from the progress of the water in the shaft, it is supposed that about a cubical foot of the earth under the river must have fallen into the tunnel, where it had been recently excavated, and before the brick work had been raised to support it. It was attributed to what miners call  <QUOTE>a fault</QUOTE>  in the soil; that is, the meeting of the <num value="2">two</num> layers of earth where the water has always the least difficulty in insinuating itself. This accident delayed the progress of the work, but the hole has been completely stopped, and the cavity filled up chiefly by bags of clay. The works recommenced in September, with every prospect of a successful termination. <pb id="p.502" n="502"> 
<div1 type=chapter id="c.17" n="17"><HEAD>Topographical and Historical Account of the Tower of London.</HEAD>
 
<p>The Tower of London is situated on the east side of the city, adjoining the Thames, and is surrounded by a broad and deep ditch, in some places an <num value="120">hundred and twenty</num> feet wide, supplied with water from the Thames, which washes its south bounds; within which is a strong and lofty wall. 
<p>The contents of the plot, within the walls, measure <num value="12">twelve</num> acres and <num value="5">five</num> rods. And the circumference, on the outside of the ditch, measures <num value="3156">three thousand one hundred and fifty-six</num> feet: in the inner ward stand the following towers, commonly known by the following names, the White Tower, Bloody, Constable, Lanthorn, Brick, Salt, Broad Arrow, Bowyers, Flint, Devereux, Beauchamp, Record, the Bell, and the Jewel Tower, and a spacious wharf next the river. 
<p>Maitland says,  <QUOTE>it has been a matter of great debate, whether this royal fortress be within the city of London: but that was finally determined, upon a view and strict examination, in Michaelmas Term, <num value="13">13</num> James I, in the trial of the murderers of sir Thomas Overbury, who was poisoned in a chamber situate on the west part of the ancient wall of London, which is yet discoverable, and extendeth through the Tower; when it was adjudged, that all that portion of the Tower which is environed within the said wall, or on the west part thereof, is within the city of London, within the ward of the Tower, and parish of All Saints, Barking; and that the residue of this fortress, lying on the east of the said ancient wall, is within the county of Middlesex. And accordingly the murderers were tried in London.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Maitland, i. <num value="147">147</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>There can be no doubt as to the fact of the Romans having erected a fort on the site of the Tower, the discoveries of their remains made in <datestruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></datestruct> fully support this assertion, and it is certainly probable that they fortified the banks of the river on this spot as the situation was so particularly desirable. The <num value="1">first</num> building known to have been erected here is the White Tower, which was built about <datestruct value="1180--"><year reg="1180">1180</year></datestruct> by Gundulph, bishop of Rochester. This fortress or keep, stands upon the spot where the <num value="2">second</num> bulwark once stood, in the east part of the wall from the Thames. It was greatly shaken in the year <datestruct value="1090"><year reg="1090">1090</year></datestruct>, by a violent tempest of wind, which, amongst other damages, blew down <num value="600">six hundred</num> houses in the city: which misfortune was repaired, and a castle was built under the same tower, on the south side, which was incastellated round about, at a great expence. <pb id="p.503" n="503"> These repairs and additions were not finished till the reign of king Henry I. And yet this tower stood in need of further help in <datestruct value="1155--"><year reg="1155">1155</year></datestruct>, when Thomas a Becket, archbishop of Canterbury, and chancellor to king Henry II. caused it to be repaired again. In <datestruct value="1190--"><year reg="1190">1190</year></datestruct> lord chancellor Longchamp, bishop of Ely, encompassed the premises with a wall and ditch; and in this work, in a very arbitrary manner, broke into and deprived both the church of the Holy Trinity, the hospital of St. Catharine, and the city of London, of some of their lands: for, after he had enclosed the Tower and Castle with an outward wall of stone embattled, he caused a deep ditch to be dug round, from the south-east point by the north side to the south-west corner of the said wall, in order to environ it with the river Thames: in which work the mill belonging to the brethren of the hospital of St. Catharine's, and standing on the site of Iron-gate, as at present called, was removed, and part of a garden, which they had let to the king at <measure value="6bmark" type=currency><num value="6">six</num> marks</measure> per ann. was rooted up, and, for the most part, laid waste; and another piece of ground next Smithfield, belonging to the priory of the Holy Trinity without Aldgate, worth half a mark per annum, was taken from it; and the city was deprived of all the ground from the White Tower to the Postern Gate. 
<p>In <datestruct value="1239--"><year reg="1239">1239</year></datestruct> king Henry III. in order to overawe the citizens, and to make them the more readily submit to his exactions, added several bulwarks to the foregoing: but they were so much damaged by an earthquake in the following year, that his majesty commanded them to be restored and augmented; which, when finished, consisted of a stone gate, bulwark, &amp;c. on the west side or entrance. But this new work, which is recorded to have cost upwards of <measure value="12000bmark" type=currency><num value="12000">twelve thousand</num> marks</measure>, fell down in the same manner a few years after. 
<p>The same king also commanded the keepers of the tower work to repair the garner within the said Tower, and to amend it well throughout, wherever it stood in need; and so to lengthen the leaden gutters of the great tower, from the top, for the conveyance of rain water, that they should reach to the ground, to prevent the dripping of the rain water upon the new plaister work, to the great detriment and decay thereof; and to make upon the said tower, on the south side above, deep alures, of good and strong timber, and to be well leaded all over; by which people might see even to the foot of the said tower, and, if needful, to ascend and descend the better: also to whiten the whole chapel of St. John the Evangelist in the same tower; and also the old wall about the same tower; from whence it is probable this building took the name of the White Tower. 
<p>King Edward I. so highly approved of the improvements made to this fortress by king Henry, that he, in the <num value="2">second</num> year of his reign, commanded his treasurer and chamberlain to take certain sums of money out of his exchequer for finishing the work of the <pb id="p.504" n="504"> ditch, then new made about the said bulwark, now called the Lion Tower; so called from the lions and other wild beasts lodged therein by the king's command, supposed to be the fancy of Henry I. who greatly delighted in those foreign animals. Henry III. received a present from the emperor Frederic in <datestruct value="1235--"><year reg="1235">1235</year></datestruct>, of <num value="3">three</num> leopards, [which were committed to the same place under proper keepers; and king Edward II. commanded the sheriffs of London to pay out of the fee-farm of the city sixpence per day to the keeper of the leopards for their maintenance, and <num value="3">three</num> halfpence for the diet of their keeper. In the <num value="16">16th</num> of Edward III. there remained in this Tower only <num value="1">one</num> leopard; but <num value="1">one</num> Robert Bowre was charged with the custody of <num value="1">one</num> lion, <num value="1">one</num> lioness, and <num value="2">two</num> cattes lions. This bulwark is still continued in the same use, as will be noticed hereafter. 
<p>King Edward IV. added to the fortifications of the Tower of London, and inclosed with a brick wall a piece of ground, taken out of Tower-hill, west from the Lions'-Tower, now called the bulwark. In the <num value="5">5th</num> year of this reign, the king's officers erected a scaffold and gallows for the execution of offenders: of which, when the city complained, the king commanded the following proclamation to be published:

<p>From which time the city had until of late years always a large scaffold and gallows of timber, prepared at their expence, for the execution of such as are ordered to be hanged or beheaded on Tower-hill. 
<p>There are other repairs recorded to have been done to this fortress, particularly in the year <datestruct value="1484"><year reg="1484">1484</year></datestruct>, when masons, bricklayers, and other workmen were pressed by the surveyor of the king's works to expedite the buildings therein, commanded by king Richard III. In <datestruct value="1532--"><year reg="1532">1532</year></datestruct> Henry VIII. repaired the White Tower, and some other parts. And in the next reign a Frenchman, who lodged in the round bulwark, between the west-gate and the postern or drawbridge, called the Warder's-gate, blew up the said bulwark, and <pb id="p.505" n="505"> himself therewith, without further damage; which bulwark was immediately rebuilt.<NOTE><BIBL>Maitland i. p. <num value="148">148</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The encroachments on the soil of this royal fortress, in the reign of queen Elizabeth, by a great number of tenements erected over the ditch, and upon the waste ground within its liberty, became such a nuisance, incumbrance, and weakening to the Tower, that, after a strict inquiry into its present state, there issued an order from the privy council for the pulling of them all down; which was accordingly executed, to the great improvement and advantage of the fortification. 
<p>But the most thorough repairs were made after the restoration: in <datestruct value="1663--"><year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct> the ditch was scoured, all the wharfing about it was new built of brick and stone, and sluices contrived for letting in and retaining the Thames water, as occasion might require. The walls and windows of the White Tower, being very much decayed, were mended, <num value="2">two</num> of the turrets were wholly taken down, and new funds set up, with the king's arms and imperial crowns over them; all which were made entirely new, the old having been defaced by the garrison in the time of the commonwealth. 
<p>Since that period measures have been taken for strengthening the city fortress, as was the case so late as <datestruct value="1792"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>, when the garrison was increased;  <QUOTE>several <num value="100">hundred</num> men,</QUOTE>  says Bayley, in his history of the Tower,  <QUOTE> were employed in repairing the fortifications, opening embrasures, and mounting cannon; and on the western side of the fortress, a strong barrier was formed with old casks, filled with earth and rubble; the gates were closed at an early hour, and no <num value="1">one</num> but the military allowed to go upon the ramparts.</QUOTE>  
<p>From the time that the Tower was <num value="1">first</num> erected, until the reign of queen Elizabeth, it was frequently used as a palace where our monarchs  <QUOTE>kept open household and frank resort,</QUOTE>  and where the royal court, and even parliaments, were held. From the Tower all processions and pageants generally proceeded, whether it was to a tournament or a coronation; and the kings of England, from the time of Richard II. to the accession of James II., always proceeded from the Tower to Westminster to be crowned, in grand procession, with the exception of Charles I. who was prevented by the plague. 
<p>The buildings at present within the walls, exclusive of the towers mentioned before, are, the Church, the offices of Ordnance, of the keepers of the Records, the Jewel office, the Horse Armoury, the Grand Storehouse, the New or Small Armoury, handsome brick houses for the chief officers residing in the Tower, with many lesser houses for other officers, barracks for soldiers on duty, besides prisons for prisoners of state, &amp;c. In digging the foundations of those large store-houses, which are situate on the south side of the White Tower, the workmen (in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, or <pb id="p.506" n="506"> thereabouts) met with old foundations of stone, above <num value="3">three</num> yards in breadth, supposed to be the remains of some ancient tower on that spot, of which history gives no account ; and so cemented together, that it was with much difficulty they were forced up by beetle and wedges.<NOTE><BIBL>Maitland i. p. <num value="148">148</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The Tower stands on the north side of the river Thames, from which it is separated by a convenient wharf and narrow ditch, over which is a draw-bridge, for the more easy receiving or sending out ammunition, and naval and military stores. On this wharf is a long and beautiful platform, whereon were placed <num value="61">sixty-one</num> pieces of cannon, <num value="9">nine</num> pounders, mounted on very handsome carriages, and which were fired on days of state or public rejoicings; small pieces are now used for those purposes. 
<p>Within the walls, on a line with this wharf, is a platform <num value="70">seventy</num> yards long, called the Ladies' Line, because much frequented by the ladies in the summer. It is shaded within by a row of lofty trees, and without, commands a most delightful prospect of the shipping in the river. The ascent to this line is by stone steps, and being once upon it, a person may walk almost round the walls of the Tower; in the course of which there are <num value="3">three</num> batteries. The <num value="1">first</num> of these is called the Devil's Battery, where is also a platform, on which are mounted <num value="7">seven</num> pieces of cannon, though on the battery itself are only <num value="5">five</num>. The <num value="2">second</num> is called the Stone Battery, and is defended by <num value="8">eight</num> pieces of cannon : and the last is called the Wooden Battery, mounted with <num value="6">six</num> pieces of cannon, all <num value="9">nine</num> pounders. 
<p>The Tower-wharf is enclosed at each end by gates, which are opened every morning for the convenience of a free intercourse between the respective inhabitants of the Tower, the city, and its Suburbs. 
<p>Under this wharf is a water-gate, through the Tower-wall, commonly called the Traitor's-gate; because it was customary in former times to convey traitors, and other state prisoners, to and from the Tower by water, through this gate; but, at this time, such persons are publicly admitted at the main entrance. 
<p>Over the water-gate is a regular building, terminated at each end by a round tower, on which are embrasures for cannon. The infirmary for the afflicted military was formerly in this building, but now it is converted into regular apartments for persons employed in the ordnance department, also a mill, and the water-works for supplying the garrison with water from the Thames, by means of a steam-engine. 
<p>The principal entrance into the Tower is by <num value="3">three</num> gates to the west. The <num value="1">first</num> of these opens to a court, on the right hand of which is the Lion's Tower. The <num value="2">second</num> gate opens to a stone bridge built over the ditch; at the inter end of which is the <num value="3">third</num> gate, <pb id="p.507" n="507"> much stronger than the <num value="2">two</num> former, having a portcullis to let down upon occasion, and being guarded, not only by soldiers, but by the warders of the Tower. Within this gate, on the right hand, is the draw-bridge for foot passengers, to and from the Tower-wharf. 
<p>The principal officer, to whom the government of this fortress is committed, is called the Constable of the Tower, and is usually of distinguished quality, as his post at all coronations, and other state ceremonies, is of the utmost importance, having the crown and other regalia in his custody. 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> upon record that enjoyed this important post was Othowenus, in the reign of king Stephen, who was succeeded by Acolivillus, Otho, and Godfrey Magnaville, earl of Essex, in the same reign. We afterwards find John Holland, duke of Exeter, in the reign of Henry VI. the earl of Oxford in <datestruct value="1485--"><year reg="1485">1485</year></datestruct>, and the earl of Lincoln in the reign of Edward VI. amongst these constables, of whom history does not afford any perfect list. 
<p>King Richard III. appointed Robert Brackenbury, esq. constable of the Tower in <datestruct value="1483--"><year reg="1483">1483</year></datestruct>, as <num value="1">one</num> well attached to his interest, and ready to obey all his commands; and, to keep him more attached to him, his majesty gave him also the office of master and operator of monies; the office of keeper of the exchange within the Tower of London; the office of keeping the lions as mentioned before; the constableship of Tunbridge-castle in Kent, with a fee of <measure value="10bmark" type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> marks</measure>; the stewardship of the lordship of Ware, with a fee of a <measure value="100s." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> shillings</measure>; the manors of Mote, Morden, Delhing, and Newingdon, in Kent, and all the other lands late the earl Rivers's, to the value of <num value="261">261</num>. <measure value="13s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="13">13</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> yearly; the manors of Crawthory and Coherede, and other tenements and lands in Romney-marsh, of the yearly value of <measure value="50l. 18s. 9d." type=Currency><num value="50">50</num>l. <num value="18">18</num>s. <num value="9">9</num>d.</measure>; the manor of Glastonbury, and all other lands and tenements in the counties of Kent, Surry, and Sussex, which were Walter Roberts's, value <measure value="40l." type=currency><num value="40">40</num>l.</measure> per annum, besides a yearly salary of <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">100</num>l.</measure> to be paid him out of the revenues of Writtle, &amp;c. But all these favours were not sufficient to engage him to perpetrate the dark designs of Richard against his nephews; wherefore he was, by a special warrant from the king, commanded to surrender up the keys of the Tower, which, in effect, was all his power in that fortress, to sir James Tyrrel, for the space of <num value="1">one</num> night, under the pretence of ordering some special matters therein; in which night, Tyrrel, a man of a profligate conscience, and loaded with great promises of advantage, being constituted constable, during that short sequestration of the office, undertook and executed the treason upon the <num value="2">two</num> princes. Richard, having by this bloody means secured the crown to himself, shewed his liberality to the traitor and murderer, by conferring on him great favours. But the scrupulous Brackenbury, notwithstanding his patent of constable of <pb id="p.508" n="508"> the Tower was granted for the term of his life, was discharged from that honourable post in the year <datestruct value="1485"><year reg="1485">1485</year></datestruct>. 
<p>This officer had many great privileges due to him from the ships of the merchants of London; as more particularly is set forth by the instruments granted by king Richard II. and his parliament, to sir Thomas Murrieux. 
<p>He was enjoined in <num value="10">10</num> and <num value="11">11</num> Henry III. to compel those who brought fish in ships to sell at London, to deliver the said fish at Queenhithe. 
<p>The power of the constable of the Tower extended to the <num value="5">five</num> ports, and to arrest ships in the Thames, if there were occasion. A precept was sent to him in the <num value="9">9th</num> of Henry III. to arrest certain ships in time of dearth of corn, to prevent the transportation of it. 
<p>In the <num value="52">52nd</num> of Henry III. the king commanded the abbot of Westminster, <foreign lang=la>carriare buscam, blada, et alia victualia, tam per terr. quam per aquam, usq. ad abbiam predict. ita quod nulla indefiat priza ad opus regis.</foreign> That is, to carry brush or underwood, corn, or other victuals, as well by land as by water, to the said abbey, so that no prizal be made to the king's use. 
<p>In the <num value="14">14th</num> of Edward III. there were letters patent issued for making allowances to the constables of the Tower for the wages of the king's prisoners there, viz. for a knight <measure value="2d." type=currency><num value="2">two</num>-pence</measure> a day, and for an esquire <num value="1">one</num> penny. 
<p>In the <num value="38">38th</num> of the same king there were orders for the constable of the Tower to repair the defects in the water, [the river Lea] or the banks thereof, running from Ware to Waltham, and so to London. 
<p>These fees were ordered by Philip and Mary, in the <num value="2">second</num> and <num value="3">third</num> years of their reign ; that the constable shall have of their majesties, at the receipt of the exchequer, for his entertainment, the yearly fee or wages of a <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> pounds</measure>, and an <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> pounds</measure> by the year for the diet of poor prisoners, who have not wherewithal to pay for their diets. So that the said poor prisoners may be examined within <num value="7">seven</num> days after their coming into his custody, and be discharged again within <num value="7">seven</num> days after they have been examined. 
<p>The said constable shall have of every duke, if there be any committed by their majesties to the said Tower, for the suit of his irons, <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> pounds</measure>; and for a marquis <measure value="16l." type=currency><num value="16">sixteen</num> pounds</measure>; and for the board of every such duke or marquis, weekly, <measure value="3l." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> pounds</measure> <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure>; and for the chaplain's board of every such duke or marquis, every week <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">six</num> shillings and <num value="8">eight</num>-pence</measure>; and for every of his gentlemen <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">six</num> shillings and <num value="8">eight</num>-pence</measure>; and for every of his yeomen waiting upon him <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> shillings</measure> before his attainder, and after his attainder as their majesties shall appoint

<p>Item, the said constable shall have for every baron and lord, of the degree, as the younger son of a duke or marquis; and for a knight of the garter, for the suit of irons, <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure>; and for his board weekly <measure value="35s." type=currency><num value="35">thirty-five</num> shillings</measure>, and for his gentlemen and yeomen as before.

<p>Item, the said constable shall have of every gentleman of the estate of an <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> pounds</measure> by the year, and under, for the suit of his irons, <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num> shillings</measure>; and his board weekly <measure value="17s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="17">seventeen</num> shillings and <num value="6">six</num>-pence</measure>. And other men, not having lands and possessions, and yet having goods sufficient to find themselves, for suit of irons, <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure>; and for their week's board <measure value="13s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="13">thirteen</num> shillings and <num value="4">four</num>-pence</measure>. 
<p>Item, all other to live of the house, except their majesties appoint the same a better diet by warrant. 
<p>The present constable of the Tower is the duke of Wellington. 
<p>The constable has under him a lieutenant and deputy-lieutenant, whose offices are of great consequence ; a major, (commonly called governor,) a chaplain, a physician, an apothecary, gentleman porter,<NOTE>This office is at least as old as the time of Edward III.; for, in the Tower records, mention is made of the custody of the Tower-gate being granted to John de London.--<BIBL><hi rend=italics>Maitland's London</hi>, i, <num value="175">175</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> gentleman gaoler, a master and <num value="4">four</num> quarter gunners, and <num value="40">forty</num> warders; whose uniform is like the king's yeomen of the guard. Their coats are of a very singular form, being made with large sleeves and flowing skirts; they are of fine scarlet cloth, laced round the edges and seams with several rows of gold lace, and girt round their waists with a broad laced girdle. On their breasts and backs they wear the king's silver badge representing the rose, thistle, and shamrock; as also the letters G. R. in capitals. And, instead of a hat, they wear on their heads round flat-crowned caps, tied with bands of party-coloured ribbands. 
<div2 type=section id="c.17.1"><HEAD>The Church of St. Peter <foreign lang=la>ad Vincula</foreign>.</HEAD>
 
<p>Within the Tower is a small church which was erected by king Edward I. and dedicated in the name of St. Peter in chains, commonly called St. Peter <foreign lang=la>ad Vincula</foreign> within the Tower; who, as appears by the Tower records, in the <num value="28">twenty-eighth</num> year of his reign, granted certain rents, at a certain custom of stabotes or <pb id="p.510" n="510"> stalbotes, a kind of fisher-boats, for the maintenance of a rector and <num value="3">three</num> chaplains, settled here by his royal appointment. To these he added <num value="2">two</num> more chaplains in his thirtieth year; and, for the maintenance of these <num value="5">five</num> chaplains and a rector, he granted also certain allowances, to be paid for some tenements in London, and at Tower-Hill, and Petty-Wales; and ordained certain fees to be paid by the constable, officers, and moneyers, for the same purpose,, which is further explained by an old record of <num value="8">8</num> Henry V. of a grant to John Salmonby, rector of the chapel in the Tower; whereby is granted to him <measure value="60s." type=currency><num value="60">sixty</num> shillings</measure> rent, and the appurtenances in Candlewick-street, London, for and towards his subsistence; <measure value="38s." type=currency><num value="38">thirty-eight</num> shillings</measure> and eightpence for a tenement on Tower-Hill, and Little-Wales; <measure value="58s." type=currency><num value="58">fifty-eight</num> shillings</measure> per annum from the hospital of St. Catherine; <measure value="10bmark" type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> marks</measure> per annum to be paid by the constable of the Tower, <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure> per annum of his good-will; <measure value="13s." type=currency><num value="13">thirteen</num> shillings</measure> per annum from the master of the Mint; and of every artificer and stipendiary a certain tithe out of their wages and stipends. 
<p>From which and other records it has been collected, that the bounds of this rectory are all the compass of the Tower; and it hath some territories without, as Little Tower-Hill, which was therefore called the king's soil of Little Tower-Hill, adjoining unto which was a. place called the king's waste of Rosemary Lane, or Hog Lane. But these boundaries, as well as the precinct of the Tower, which contains all the soil or liberty between Barking church and Crutched Friars, St. Mary Grace's, and St. Catherine's, have been an old controversy between the magistrates of the city, and the officers of the Tower. 
<p>This church was formerly a large and spacious building, frequented by the kings themselves for their devotion, and adorned with chancels, shrines, and images; as more particularly appears. from a letter mandatory of the king to the keeper of the Tower works, in the <num value="25">25th</num> of Henry III.

<p>This church is not remarkable as a fine specimen of the pointed style, and no part of it is apparently older than the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century. It appears to have undergone considerable alteration since the period of its foundation. It was much injured by fire in the reign of Henry the <num value="8">Eighth</num>, and it is probable, from the style of architecture at present displayed, that the alterations were made at that period.<NOTE>For the ensuing particulars, as well as for other valuable information, I am indented to a friend, whose long acquaintance with the metropolis, joined to great accuracy of observation and correct taste, enables me to give any observation he may make with perfect confidence in its correctness. T.A.</NOTE> It consists of a nave and north aisle of equal breadth, with a small tower at the west end of the latter, and a chancel at the east end of the nave. The exterior has been covered by some tasteful improver, with rough cast and oyster shells. In the walls of the tower are many flints, but the angles have been coped with stone, and the oyster shells not forgotten in modern times. The south front has <num value="5">five</num> windows with low pointed arches, each made by mullions into <num value="3">three</num> lights; the stone work, together with <num value="2">two</num> of the windows which had been walled up, were restored a few years since; the mullions have arched heads enclosing sweeps; under <num value="1">one</num> of the windows is an entrance which internally has a pointed arch, but the exterior has been altered to a lintel; this doorway is now fronted by a small porch. The east end of the chancel and aisle have each a window of <num value="5">five</num> lights, made by mullions and circumscribed by a low pointed arch. On the north side of the chancel was formerly a window, which has been walled up; the south side is entirely hid by buildings, and has no windows; and the west front is also partially concealed. The interior is divided longitudinally by <num value="4">four</num> arches resting upon <num value="3">three</num> clusters, consisting of <num value="4">four</num> columns surrounding an octangular pier, and <num value="2">two</num> half clusters attached to the extreme walls; the arches are obtusely pointed; the ceiling rests on beams which divide it into compartments, the spaces being plastered. The aisle and the west end of the nave are occupied by galleries, supported on Tuscan columns, for the accommodation of the military <pb id="p.512" n="512"> attached to the garrison. The pulpit is situated against a pier on the south side of the church, between <num value="2">two</num> of the windows. The altar is plain, there is no organ or font.<NOTE>The writer of this not long since saw the rite of baptism administered in this church from a slop basin!</NOTE>
 
<p>The fittings up of the church are of the meanest order; it appears to have received but little favour from the hands of government, in occasional white-washing, which is executed in a manner which shews that churchwardens are not the only persons who  <QUOTE>daub and smear</QUOTE>  ecclesiastical buildings. The north and east walls have suffered greatly from damp occasioned by the accumulation of earth against them, and the congregation cannot be much benefitted by this circumstance. The church is in length <num value="66">66</num> feet, breadth <num value="54">54</num> feet, and <num value="24">24</num> feet high. There is not a vestige of painted glass remaining in any of the windows. Several ancient monuments in the church are deserving of attention. The handsomest is an altar tomb with <num value="2">two</num> recumbent alabaster figures to the memory of sir Richard Cholmondeley, knt. lieutenant of the Tower, in the reign of Henry VIII. and his lady; it is now placed in the north nich under the gallery, having been removed from its original station: the sides of the tomb are enriched with lozenges, enclosing shields and <num value="6">six</num> foil and other tracery; the angles, adorned with twisted columns. Round the verge of the slab is the following inscription : 
<QUOTE lang=la rend=center>Jacent corpora Ricardi Cholmondeley, militis et 
<LB>dn~e Elizabethe consortis sue, qui<gap>
 
<LB><gap>quorum animabus Deus propitietur. Amen.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The knight is attired in a suit of plate armour, with sword and dagger; his head and hands bare; the former rests on a helmet, his hands are clasped in prayer, his gauntlets lying by his side near his feet, which rest on a lion; his lady lays at his left side, her head reclining on a cushion. Much it is to be regretted that this fine monument should be neglected and exposed as it is to every wilful and accidental injury. On the north side of the chancel are <num value="2">two</num> monuments affixed to the wall, shewing kneeling figures within Corinthian niches, richly adorned with coats of arms. <num value="1">One</num> is to the memory of sir Richard Blount, knight, who died <datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>, and has statues of sir Richard, and <num value="2">two</num> sons, and his lady, and <num value="2">two</num> daughters; the other commemorates sir Richard Blount, son of the above, and has statues of the knight and <num value="3">three</num> sons, and his lady, and a daughter. Both these gentlemen were successively lieutenants of the Tower. Near the pulpit is a singular monument, consisting of <num value="4">four</num> circles disposed on a cross, containing the bust of the parents, in <num value="2">two</num>, and the effigies of <num value="3">three</num> children, reclining in the circles. A plain stone on the floor records the name of the courageous Talbot Edwards, who resisted the infamous col. Blood, <pb id="p.513" n="513"> in his daring attempt to steal the crown. There are numerous other monuments, ancient and modern, which our limits will not permit us to particularize.

<p>This church is remarkable for being the burial place of numerous royal and noble personages, who were either executed in the Tower, or on the hill adjoining, and deposited here as a place of obscurity.

<p>The uppermost story of the White Tower exhibits a massive timber roof and supporters of great antiquity.

<p>In the lieutenant's house a large and inconvenient old building, usually occupied by the major or resident governor, there is a monument recording the gunpowder plot conspiracy. 
<p>The Bell Tower is of a circular form, with a curious vaulted roof. It was in this tower that the amiable Fisher, bishop of Rochester, was confined; and tradition, without any good ground, also marks it as the place of queen Elizabeth's confinement by her bigotted sister Mary. It is now used as <num value="1">one</num> of the domestic offices of the governor. 
<p>A short distance from the Bell Tower, northward, is the Beauchamp, or Cobham Tower, which has always been <num value="1">one</num> of the principal state prisons. It takes its double name from Thomas de Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, who was imprisoned here in <datestruct value="1397--"><year reg="1397">1397</year></datestruct>, previous to his banishment to the Isle of Man, and from the Cobhams, who were certainly confined here in the reign of queen Mary, for Wyat's conspiracy. The Beauchamp Tower was formerly embattled, and consists of <num value="2">two</num> stories, whose walls bear numerous records of the misery of those who were confined within them, and, destitute of books or paper, beguiled the time in inscribing memorials of their sufferings on the walls. 
<p>The chief prison-room is a spacious apartment on the <num value="1">first</num> floor; and adjoining to it are <num value="2">two</num> small cells, probably, says Mr. Bayley,  <QUOTE>intended for the better securing of prisoners by night.

 to the Tower. Being subsequently banished the realm, he entered the service of Don John of Austria, when he was accused of attempting to poison that prince with the connivance of Walsingham, secretary to queen Elizabeth, for which he was condemned and executed before Namur. 
<p>There are several inscriptions in the lower apartment of this tower, but none particularly worthy notice. 
<p>The Beauchamp tower is traditionally said to have been the prison of Anne Boleyn; but, though there is no evidence to support it, it is by no means improbable, as it was long more used as a prison than any of the towers. Some of the state prisoners of <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct> were confined here. 
<p>The Devereux Tower, so called after the surname of the celebrated earl of Essex, is of older date than the tower last noticed. It consists of <num value="2">two</num> stories, the walls at the base being <num value="11">eleven</num> feet in thickness. 
<p>The Flint Tower was taken down about <num value="30">thirty</num> years ago. 
<p>The Bowyer's Tower took its name from having, in early times, been the residence of the master and provider of the king's bows. The basement floor, which is the only part of the original building, is here represented. 
 
<p>It is vaulted and groined; and in the walls, which are about <num value="10">ten</num> feet thick, are <num value="3">three</num> recesses, in each of which was a narrow embrasure; but these have been enlarged and modernized. There is a tradition that it was in this room that George, duke of Clarence, brother to Edward IV., was secretly put to death, by drowning in a butt of malmsey. 
<p>The next tower is the Brick Tower, which was probably erected as early as the reign of Edward IV. or Richard III. 
<p>The Jewel Tower, where the regalia are now kept, was 
<pb id="p.522" n="522"><FIGURE id="Fig.522"><HEAD>Gateway of the Bloody Tower</HEAD></FIGURE>
 formerly known by the name of the Martin Tower. Little remains of the primitive structure. 
<p>The Constable Tower, in form and style of architecture, closely corresponds with the Beauchamp Tower, but is of smaller dimensions. 
<p>The Broad Arrow Tower is also similar to the Beauchamp Tower, and, like it, has been much used as a prison, and its walls contain numerous inscriptions, few of which are of interest. 
<p>The Salt Tower contains a very singular and hieroglyphical device,<NOTE>Engraved in <BIBL>Bayley's Tower of London, p. <num value="210">210</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> by <num value="1">one</num>  <QUOTE>Hew Draper, a tavern keeper at Bristol,</QUOTE>  who was committed here on the <datestruct VALUE="1560-03-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>, on the accusation of  <QUOTE><num value="1">one</num> John Man, an astronomer, as a suspect of a conjurer or sorcerer, and thereby to practise matter against sir William Lowe and my ladie;</QUOTE>  a lamentable instance of the facility with which life and liberty could, in those days, be sacrificed. 
<p>There are also a host of inscriptions in this prison, but none worthy notice, either on account of composition, or from their having been executed by persons of note. 
 
<p>The Bloody Tower is thought to have derived its appellation from the circumstances of the <num value="2">two</num> princes, Edward V., and his brother, Richard, duke of York, who are supposed to have been put to death here, by order of their uncle, the duke of Gloucester Mr. Bayley, who doubts whether the royal brothers were <pb id="p.523" n="523"> murdered in the Tower, and ridicules the idea of calling it bloody when the children were smothered, infers, that if they were put to death in this fortress at all, it must have been at a different part of it; as the bones discovered in the time of Charles the <num value="2">Second</num>, which, on account of their appearing to be those of children, had afterwards royal interment in Henry VII.&lsquo;s chapel, were found on the south side of the White Tower, which is at a considerable distance from the place where the deed is supposed to have been perpetrated. 
<p>The gateway represented above, is of the style of architecture of the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century; it is about <num value="34">thirty-four</num> feet in length and <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet in width. The roof is groined, and each end of this entrance was originally secured by gates and a strong portcullis; at the south end this still remains, and the gate in particular has a very venerable appearance. On the eastern side, between these defences, was a small circular stone staircase leading to the superstructure, which formed the lodging of the porter or warden, and consisted of <num value="2">two</num> gloomy apartments <num value="1">one</num> above the other, and a space for working the portcullis. 
<p>The Lanthorn Tower was of considerable antiquity, and formerly contained the king's bed chamber. It communicated with the great hall, the scene of many a royal banquet in the reigns of our Henries and our Edwards. The Lanthorn Tower was considerably damaged by fire in <datestruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct>, and soon after its remains were taken down. The site of this tower, and of several other parts of the ancient palace, are now occupied by the buildings of the Ordnance office. 
<p>The Record or Wakefield Tower is a large circular building of great antiquity. Mr. Bayley says  <QUOTE> with the exception of the White Tower it is unquestionably the oldest part of the fortress now extant.</QUOTE>  This tower consists of only a basement and a <num value="1">first</num> story, each forming an octagonal apartment; the former about <num value="23">twenty-three</num> and the latter <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> feet in diameter. On the ground floor the walls are about <num value="13">thirteen</num> feet in thickness. 
<p>In addition to the towers thus described, there were several others, of some of which nothing but the foundation remains; nor is the history of them interesting even in their ancient state. 
<p>The principal towers in the outer ward are the Develin, the Well, the Cradle, Traitors Gate, and the Byward. The interior of the Well Tower exhibits a curious specimen of the architecture of the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century; the roof is groined in an elegant manner. The Cradle Tower also exhibits in the interior some elegant architecture of the latter part of the reign of Henry III. Traitors Gate, which is a large square building, with <num value="2">two</num> circular towers, having a passage under for the conveying of state prisoners by water into the Tower, retains much of its original appearance, and the interior displays some interesting specimens of the early pointed style of architecture. 
<pb id="p.524" n="524"><FIGURE id="Fig.524"><HEAD>The Byward Tower</HEAD></FIGURE>

<p>The last fortification of the outer ward is the Byward Tower; it is the principal entrance to the exterior line of fortifications. It consists of a strong tower flanked with bastions, and the gateway was originally defended by gates and a portcullis. The interior is in a perfect state, particularly an octagonal apartment, about <num value="16">sixteen</num> feet in diameter, on each side of the gateway; the roof of each is groined, and they receive light through narrow embrasures. 
<p>Opposite this building is another tower, on the outer side of the ditch called the Martin Tower; it corresponds in almost every particular with the <num value="1">one</num> last described, except that the upper part is of comparatively modern erection. 
<p>The office of Ordnance is a modern building, a little to the N. E. of the White Tower; to which all other offices for supplying artillery, arms, ammunition, or other warlike stores, to any part of the British dominions, are accountable; and from which office all orders for the disposition of warlike materials for every kind of service are issued. 
<p>When the principal arms consisted in the bow, and before the introduction of gunpowder, we find this office supplied by officers under the following names; the bowyer, the cross-bowyer, the galeator, the armourer, and the keeper of the tents. Thus in the <num value="22">22</num>d of Richard II. Robert Bridford was by patent appointed the officer for keeping and making the bows, and allowed certain houses belonging to his office; and in the <num value="13">13th</num> of <pb id="p.525" n="525"> Edw. IV. a like patent passed to Thomas Masburgh, with the grant of a house situate between Wakefield Tower and the Tower called West Smithfield, for the exercise of the foresaid office. 
<p>The officer belonging to the cross-bows, called in the records 
<foreign lang=la>Attiliator Ballistarum</foreign>, seems to have provided harness and accoutrements for those bows, and was allowed <measure value="7d." type=currency><num value="7">seven</num> pence</measure> half-penny per day in the reign of Edw. I. 
<p><num value="1">One</num> Richard Glover, esq. was the galeator, or purveyor of helmets or head-pieces, in the <num value="5">5th</num> of Henry IV. 
<p>In the <num value="1">1st</num> of Richard II. William Snell, and in the <num value="12">12th</num> of Edward III. John Fleet, were appointed the keepers of the king's armour in the Tower, with the fee of <measure value="12d." type=currency><num value="12">twelve</num> pence</measure> per day. And in the <num value="19">19th</num> of Henry VI. we read of the tent-keeper's place granted to Richard Lound for term of life, with a messuage appropriated to his office, and situate upon the wharf near St. Catherine's hospital. 
<p>Besides these were other patent-officers; as, the master smith, whose fee in <num value="1">1st</num> of Edward I. was <measure value="4d." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> pence</measure> halfpenny per day from the crown, and <measure value="3d." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> pence</measure> per day from the warders or Tower-guards. He also had an appointment of <num value="2">two</num> messuages on Wharfham, i. e. on Tower-wharf, and a parcel of land within the palace of Westminster, in the <num value="24">24th</num> of Henry VI. 
<p>The master mason and master carpenter; for in the <num value="10">10th</num> of Edw. III. William de Ramsay was made chief mason of the king at the Tower, and chief overseer of all the king's works in all his castles on this side the river Trent, with an appointment of <num value="1">one</num> robe yearly, and <measure value="12d." type=currency><num value="12">twelve</num> pence</measure> per day paid at the Exchequer. And at the same time and manner William Hurle was made chief carpenter. 
<p>In this state continued the office of ordnance, till Henry VIII. placed it under the management of a master, a lieutenant, surveyor, &amp;c.<NOTE><p>The principal officer at this time is called the master-general of the ordnance, under whom is a lieutenant-general, surveyor-general, clerk of the ordnance, storekeeper, clerk of the deliveries, treasurer, and paymaster; who all hold their places by patent from the crown, under the great seal of England, and are allowed clerks, for the better execution of the duty in each respective office. 
<p>The master-general is invested with a peculiar jurisdiction over all his majesty's engineers employed in the several fortifications of this kingdom; to whom they are all accountable, and from whom they receive their particular orders and instructions, according to the directions and commands given by his majesty and council. 
<p>The lieutenant-general receives all orders and warrants signed by the master, and from the other principal officers, and sees them duly executed; makes orders, as the occasions of the state may require; and gives orders for discharging the great guns, when required at coronations, on birth days, festivals, and other solemn occasions.  And it is his particular office to see the train of artillery and all its equipage fitted for motion, when ordered to be drawn into the field. </NOTE>

<p>These are all comprised under the title of records of the court of chancery, and it is truly observed by Mr. Bayley, the learned and elegant historian of the Tower, that  <QUOTE> they form a collection of memorials of the highest national importance: indeed, they are the ground work of the constitution; the basis of the laws; and a source, without the aid of which no history of the nation can be written or proved.</QUOTE>  
<p>The public records of Scotland, which Oliver Cromwell seized on, were placed in the Tower, where they remained until the restoration, when Charles II., intending to return them to Edinburgh Castle, sent them in a vessel, which was wrecked near Holy island, and the whole the valuable documents were lost. 
<p>In the <num value="1">first</num> year of Edward III. Robert de Hoton was commanded to arrange and set in order the charters, writings and muniments in <num value="2">two</num> chests in the White Chamber, contiguous to a hall, called the White Hall, whose roofs, doors and windows were ordered to be repaired in the <num value="36">36th</num> year of the same reign; and is probably the same little house mentioned in another record of the <num value="14">14th</num> of Henry VI. in these words: <foreign lang=la>Joannes Malpas habuit officium custodis armature infra turrim London. Una cum una parva domo tunc vacant. Infra dictam turrim, juxta turrim infra quam rotuli cancellariae regis continentur</foreign>; i.e.  <QUOTE>John Malpas, possessed the office of keeper of the armory in the Tower <pb id="p.529" n="529"> of London, together with <num value="1">one</num> little house then empty within the said tower, near to the tower, within which are kept the rolls of the king's chancery.</QUOTE>  
<p>We also learn its antiquity from the mention of the keepers of those records, <num value="1">one</num> of whom was Walter Reginald, the king's treasurer, who was commanded by Edward II. to deliver to <num value="1">one</num> Bensted all the writings and instruments touching the negociation of peace between king Edward his father, and the king of France, which were in his custody in the Tower, An. Reg. <num value="2">2</num>. Robert de Hoton, above-mentioned, seems to have been another keeper of the records in the <num value="1">1st</num> of Edward III. who by writ was directed to bring into the exchequer all the writs, muniments, &amp;c. belonging to Thomas earl of Lancaster, deceased, and in his custody. In the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> year of the same reign, William de Kildesby, keeper of the privy-seal, seems also to have been keeper of the records; for John de St. Paul, master or custos of the rolls of chancery, was commanded to send all the rolls, bundles, and memoranda of chancery to the Tower, and to deliver them there to the said William de Kildesby. <num value="1">One</num> John Burton, clerk, enjoyed the same office in the <num value="10">10th</num> of Richard II. And in the reign of Henry VI. Thomas Smith, clerk, after a prosecution and conviction in the Star-chamber, for the razing of a record of the chancery in his custody in the Tower of London in the reign of Edw.. III. was discharged his office, and was probably succeeded by John Malpas above-mentioned. Ralph Pexall, keeper of the records in the <num value="20">20th</num> of Henry VIII. erazed, by command of the said king, certain words negligently written long before in the rolls of the chancery of the <num value="22">22</num>d of Edward IV. then being in the Tower, viz. in a levy granted to Edmund Church; he was succeeded by Richard Eton. 
<p>In the <num value="3">3</num>d of Edward VI. Edward Hales was keeper of the records: in whose time <num value="1">one</num> Hoby, an officer in the Ordnance, gave notice to him, that he had accidentally discovered a great quantity of records in an old empty house in the Tower, as he searched for a convenient place to lay up gunpowder; which, by laying damp, and many of them against the walls, were much damaged and eaten with the lime. 
<p>In the reign of queen Elizabeth, an inquiry was instituted and some salutary measures adopted for the preservation of the records, and about this time the custody of them was committed to Mr. William Bowyer, a man of great talents and industry; he devoted upwards of <num value="8">eight</num> years, and a considerable fortune, in collecting and arranging those valuable muniments: he formed with his own hand, <num value="6">six</num> folio volumes of repertories. Subsequently the learned John Selden and the celebrated Prynne, (author of the <title>Histrio Mastrix</title>), both eminent antiquaries, were appointed keepers, and did much to the arranging and forming proper indexes to the objects of their charge; but it appears that, either <pb id="p.530" n="530"> previous to the appointment of those great men, or more probably after, the records fell into as bad a state of confusion as before they were placed under Mr. Bowyer's hands. 
<p>Lord Halifax, about <datestruct value="1703--"><year reg="1703">1703</year></datestruct>, called the attention of parliament to this subject, and a committee was appointed to inquire into the state of the national records. By order of this commission much was done; the record chambers were new fitted up, under the direction of sir C. Wren; and about <datestruct value="1742--"><year reg="1742">1742</year></datestruct> a calendar of the Gascoigne, Norman, and French rolls was published, and was very well received, both at home and abroad. The printing of the records still continues, under the direction of the commission. On the death of Mr. Astle, who was keeper of the records for near <num value="30">thirty</num> years, the late S. Lysons, esq. F. S. A. was immediately appointed to the situation: the talents of this gentleman, and his profound knowledge of the history and antiquities of his country, fitted him for so important an office, and no keeper ever exerted himself with such enthusiasm and success. On the death of this amiable man in <datestruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></datestruct>, he was succeeded in the office by Henry Petrie, esq., the present keeper, under whom is John Bayley, esq. the author of the History of the Tower before noticed. 
<div2 type=section id="c.17.4"><HEAD>The Jewel Office.</HEAD>
 
<p>Is a dark strong stone room, about <num value="20">twenty</num> yards to the eastward of the grand store-house. It is not certain whether this was always the identical repository of the crown jewels, but it is highly probable, that from the moment the Tower became a royal residence, it was the place where the regalia was deposited, though the <num value="1">first</num> evidence on record, of its being used as a jewel office, is in an order made in the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> year of Henry III., to the bishop of Carlisle, directing that the <num value="4">four</num> coffers of the king's jewels should be  <QUOTE>laid up in the Tower.</QUOTE>  From this time, the regalia appears to have been kept in the White Tower until about the middle of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, when it was removed to a stone room near the grand store-house, which has since been known by the name of the Jewel Office.

Hen. vi. p. <num value="1">1</num>, m. <num value="27">27</num>, &amp;c.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The situation of keeper of the regalia was formerly considered an office of great honour and dignity, as well as trust. In the reign of Edward III. John Flete, the <num value="1">first</num> keeper of the jewels, whose name <pb id="p.531" n="531"> has been preserved, had an allowance of <measure value="12d." type=currency><num value="12">twelve</num>-pence</measure> per day, which was in succeeding reigns, gradually increased, so that, in the time of Henry VIII. it was <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">50</num>l.</measure> per annum. The smallness of this salary might induce an opinion, that the office was not of much importance, did we not find it held by persons of consideration, among whom was Thomas Cromwell, the favourite and victim of Henry VIII. 
<p>The keeper of the regalia was formerly styled  <QUOTE>master and treasurer of the jewel-house;</QUOTE>  and, in addition to the care of the crown jewels in the Tower, he had the purchasing and custody of the royal plate; the appointment of the king's goldsmiths and jewellers; the supplying of plate to ambassadors, &amp;c. If the emoluments arising from such extensive patronage and authority were not very considerable, offices of this sort must have been differently managed in former times to what they are at present; but that the perquisites of the keeper of the regalia were very great, is evident from their amounting to <measure value="1300l." type=currency><num value="1300">1300</num>l.</measure> a year in the reign of Charles II. although they had then undergone considerable reduction. 
<p>Previous to the restoration, the keeper of the regalia was allowed a table of <num value="14">fourteen</num> dishes, with beer, wine, &amp;c., or <measure value="38s." type=currency><num value="38">thirty-eight</num> shillings</measure> daily for board wages; his new-year's gifts amounted to <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">300</num>l.</measure> more, for formerly such things were frequent at court, and queen Elizabeth impoverished more than <num value="1">one</num> of her courtiers, by receiving presents from them ill-suited to their fortune to bestow. The keeper got about <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">300</num>l.</measure> more, by conveying presents to the ambassadors, and he had an allowance of <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> ounces of gilt plate every year. The small presents sent to the king fell to the share of the keeper, and produced him some <num value="30">thirty</num> or <measure value="40l." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num> pounds</measure> annually; and the purses, in which donations of gold from the peers were handed to her majesty, were also given to him. These purses were very splendid, and generally worth <num value="30">thirty</num> or <measure value="40l." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num> pounds</measure> each. 
<p>These emoluments were much cut down on the restoration, when sir Henry Mildmay, who had been keeper during the interregnum. was attainted, and the office given to sir Gilbert Talbot; but, in order to augment the reduced salary, Charles II. allowed the regalia, for the <num value="1">first</num> time, to be exhibited to the public; a custom that has been continued ever since. Sir Gilbert appointed to the office of shewing the jewels Talbot Edwards, an old servant of his father's, who had the profit arising from the exhibition, for his salary. It was during the time that Mr. Edwards held this office, that colonel Blood made the daring attempt to carry off the crown of England, in which he so nearly succeeded. 
<p>The projector of this daring theft (colonel Blood) was an Irishman, who, having spent his substance in following the fortune of king Charles II. while in adversity, thought himself hardly used by being neglected when that prince was restored to his throne; and therefore having engaged in several very desperate, <pb id="p.532" n="532"> though unsuccessful, plots, thought of a scheme to make himself amends, by seizing the crown, globe, sceptre, and dove, and carrying them all off together. 
<p>To effect this, he put himself into the habit of a doctor of divinity, as most proper for his design. Thus habited, he, with a woman whom he called his wife, went to see the curiosities in the Tower; and while they were viewing the regalia, the supposed Mrs. Blood pretended to be taken suddenly ill, and desired Mr. Edwards, (the keeper of the regalia) to assist her with some refreshment. 
<p>Mr. Edwards not only complied with this request, but also invited her to repose herself on a bed, which she did; and, after a pretended recovery, took her leave, together with Blood, with many expressions of gratitude. 
<p>A few days after Blood returned, and presented Mrs. Edwards, the keeper's wife, with <num value="4">four</num> pair of white gloves, in return for her kindness. This brought on an acquaintance, which being soon improved into a strict intimacy, a marriage was proposed between a son of Edwards and a supposed daughter of colonel Blood; but Edwards's son being at sea, the pretended daughter was under no necessity of making her appearance. 
<p>The night before the fact was to be done, the doctor told the old man that he had some friends at his house that wanted to see the regalia, but that they were to go out of town early in the morning; and therefore hoped he would gratify them with a sight although they might come a little before the usual hour. (In this enterprize, Blood engaged <num value="3">three</num> accomplices, named Desborough, Kelsy, and Perrot.) Accordingly, <num value="2">two</num> of them came, accompanied by the doctor, about <num value="8">eight</num> in the morning, and the <num value="3">third</num> held their horses, that waited for them at the outer gate of the Tower, ready saddled; they had no other apparatus but a wallet, and a wooden mallet, which there was no great difficulty to secrete. 
<p>Edwards received them with great civility, and immediately admitted them into his office; but, as it is usual for the keeper of the regalia, when he shows them, to lock himself up in a kind of grate, with open bars, that those things of considerable value may be seen but not soiled, the old man had no sooner opened the door of this place, but the doctor and his companions were in at his heels, and, without giving him time to ask questions, silenced him by knocking him down with a wooden mallet. Blood instantly made flat the bows of the crown, which he put under his cloak; Perrot, <num value="1">one</num> of his associates, put the orb in his breeches: and the <num value="3">third</num> accomplice began to cut the sceptre in <num value="2">two</num> with a file, when the son of Mr. Edwards unexpectedly arrived at the Tower from Flanders: and being told that his father was with some friends that would be very glad to see him, at the Jewel office, he posted thither immediately, and met Blood and his companions just as they were coming out; who, instead of returning and securing him, as in good policy they <pb id="p.533" n="533"> should have done, hurried away with the crown and globe, leaving the sceptre behind. 
<p>Old Edwards, who was not so much hurt as the villains had apprehended, by this time recovered his legs, and cried out  <QUOTE>Treason! Murder!</QUOTE>  which being heard by his daughter, she ran out, and gave an alarm; and Blood and Perrot, making uncommon haste, were observed to jog each other's elbows as they went, which gave great reason for suspecting them. 
<p>Blood and his accomplices were now advanced beyond the main-guard; but the alarm being given to the warder at the draw-bridge, he put himself in a posture to stop their progress. Blood discharged a pistol at the warder, who, though unhurt, fell to the ground through fear; by which they got safe to the little ward-house gate, where the sentinel, although he saw the warder, to all appearance, shot, made no resistance against Blood and his associates, who now got over the draw-bridge, and through the outer gate, upon the wharf. 
<p>At this place they were overtaken by <num value="1">one</num> captain Beckman, who had pursued them from Edwards' house. Blood immediately discharged a pistol at Beckman's head; but he stooping down at the instant, the shot missed him, and he seized Blood, who had the crown under his cloak. Blood struggled a long while to preserve his prize; and when it was at length wrested from him, he said,  <QUOTE> It was a gallant attempt, how unsuccessful soever; for it was for a crown!</QUOTE>  
<p>Before Blood was taken, Perrot had been seized by another person; and young Edwards, observing a man that was bloody, in the scuffle, was going to run him through the body, but was prevented by captain Beckman. 
<p>When his majesty was informed of these circumstances, and the apprehension of the villains, he desired to examine Blood himself; and while most people thought that some new punishment would be devised, to torture so daring an offender, the king thought proper not only to pardon him and his accomplices, but to grant Blood a pension of <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">500</num>l.</measure> a year during his life. It is believed, that Charles's fear for his own safety induced him to pardon Blood, as he had threatened the king that he was connected with a formidable band, who would revenge any act done towards himself. 
<p>The arrangements of the jewel room have recently been entirely changed. The space for the visitors is greatly enlarged; and the elegant, but inconvenient iron-work in front is replaced by a smaller and lighter railing. Upon the entrance of a visitor a crimson curtain is drawn aside, and the numerous regalia are displayed at <num value="1">one</num> view within enclosures, lined with white cloth, and fronted with large squares of plate glass. The apartment is lighted by <num value="6">six</num> argand lamps, with the power of <num value="48">forty-eight</num> candles, throwing their full lustre on the jewels. <pb id="p.534" n="534"> 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> object is the Golden Wine Fountain, which is nearly <num value="3">three</num> feet high, and of the same circumference. At the coronation and other state banquets, it pours out <num value="4">four</num> <foreign lang=fr>jets du vin</foreign> in several divisions. 
<p>The Ancient Imperial Crown, which was only laid aside at the crowning of his present majesty. Its arches, flowers and fillets, are covered with large jewels of every colour, surrounding a cap of purple velvet, faced with treble rows of ermine. 
<p>The Golden Orb is about <num value="6">six</num> inches in diameter, edged with pearls, and girded with precious stones. Under its cross is a remarkably large amethyst. This orb is placed in the king's left hand at the coronation. 
<p>The Queen's Crown is composed entirely of diamonds of the largest size. It was made for Mary of Modena, the consort of James II. In Sandford's account of the coronation of that sovereign, its cost is stated at <measure value="111000l." type=currency><num value="111000">one hundred and eleven thousand</num> pounds</measure>. 
<p>The Prince of Wales's Crown is of plain gold, without any jewels. When there is an heir apparent to the throne, it is placed before his seat in the house of lords, on a velvet cushion. During the regency of the present king, it was placed at the left of the regal crown when he went to the parliament house. 
<p>The Queen's Orb is somewhat smaller than that of the king's, but composed of the same splendid materials and ornaments. 
<p>The Queen's Diadem, composed entirely of pearls and diamonds; differing in shape from her crown, as having no arches. It was made for the consort of William III. 
<p>The Ampulla or Golden Eagle; from which, our sovereigns are anointed with the holy oil at their coronation. This ancient piece was brought by the celebrated Thomas a Becket from the abbey of Sens, in France, where it had long been venerated as the actual gift of an angel from heaven! 
<p>The Golden Spoon, into which the oil is poured for anointing the king's bosom. It is of equal antiquity with the eagle. 
<p>The Golden Sacramental Dishes, which are used at the coronation. On <num value="1">one</num> of them is engraven in remarkably bold altorelievo,  <QUOTE>The Last Supper ;</QUOTE>  on the other, the royal arms of Great Britain. The Golden Chalice, which is used at the same august ceremony. These are also used at Easter, Whitsuntide, and Christmas in the royal chapel of the Tower. 
<p>On each side of the enclosure are the <num value="2">two</num> Swords of Justice, ecclesiastical and temporal; and in the front, the Curtana, or Sword of Mercy; in their embroidered velvet scabbards. 
<p>The Golden Tankards. Out of <num value="1">one</num> of these massive and richly chased vessels (that on the right hand), his present majesty drank to the health of his good people at the coronation. 
<p>The Golden Salt Cellars of State, which were placed on the table at the coronation banquet. <pb id="p.535" n="535"> 
<p>Interspersed with these splendid utensils, are several of the Golden Plate and Spoons which were displayed at that festival. 
<p>In the centre of the <num value="2">second</num> shelf, and reaching above the <num value="3">third</num>, which is cut through to receive it, is the Golden Baptismal Font; wherein the issue of the royal family are christened. It is upwards of <num value="4">four</num> feet in height. 
<p><num value="10">Ten</num> Golden Salt Cellars. These ancient ornaments, which are of exquisite workmanship, were also used at the coronation banquet. 
<p>In a sloping frame, lined also with white cloth, and covered with plate glass, are exhibited the <num value="6">six</num> golden sceptres of our kings and queens. 
<p>The King's Sceptre with .the Cross, which is placed in his majesty's right hand at the coronation. Beneath the cross, which is covered with precious stones, is a very large and fine amethyst. The pommel is ornamented in the like manner; as is also the head, which is composed of triple leaves of jewellery, representing in their form and colour the emblems of the imperial union. 
<p>The King's Sceptre with the Dove. The cross, whereon this symbol of peace reposes, is, together with the centre and pommel, richly covered with jewels. 
<p>An Ancient Sceptre, discovered in this office in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>. It is adorned with several valuable jewels, and antique enamel of peculiarly brilliant colour. This sceptre is presumed to have belonged to William III. 
<p>The Queen's Sceptre with the Cross is fancifully ornamented with large diamonds. It was made for the coronation of queen Mary, the consort of the above monarch. 
<p>The Queen's Ivory Sceptre, which belonged to the consort of James II. is mounted in gold, and bears on its top a dove of white onyx. This sceptre has no jewels, and is only remarkable for its elegant simplicity. 
<p>The Staff of St. Edward, the King and Confessor, who reigned in the year <datestruct value="1041"><year reg="1041">1041</year></datestruct>. It is made of pure gold, <num value="4">4</num> feet <num value="7">7</num> inches and a half in length, and weighs <num value="8">8</num> lbs. <num value="9">9</num> ounces. On the top is a cross, and an orb, wherein a fragment of the real cross is said to be deposited. 
<p>On each side of the frame are the King's Golden Spurs, which were buckled on the king's heel at the coronation; and the Queen's Enamelled Bracelets. 
<p>On the right hand, standing on a pedestal, and enclosed within a large bell of plate glass, is the Golden Salt Cellar of State, which was set on the king's table at the coronation. It is the model of the White Tower, but fancifully set with jewels, and adorned with cannons, serpents, and other grotesque figures at its base. The spectator is agreeably surprised by the apparently spontaneous movement of this curious piece; which slowly revolves, displaying to the view all its parts in succession. <pb id="p.536" n="536"> 
<p>On the left hand of the spectator is the New Imperial Crown, which was made for the coronation of his present majesty in <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>. The cap of this crown is of crimson velvet, and it is lined with the finest ermine. A double fillet of large pearls are set round the lower rim, and between each row is placed a magnificent band of jewels. <num value="4">Four</num> crosses pattee, frosted with the richest brilliants, are placed at equal distances above the fillet of pearls. Under the front cross is the largest and the most beautiful azure-coloured sapphire that is known; and the ruby under the back cross, which is as large as the sapphire, is equally unique. It is in its natural state, and has received no polish from art. This beautiful gem, which is semi-transparent, and of a dark red colour, was brought by Edward the Black Prince from Spain, when this gallant hero assisted Peter the Cruel to recover his kingdom, and defeated the hitherto invincible Du Guesclin. This ruby is said to have been worn by the prince at the battle of Cressy, and afterwards by Henry V. in the equally memorable victory of Agincourt. 
<p>The arches of the crown are of the imperial form; and the orb, or mound, on which the cross pattee, surmounting the cap rests, is formed of several hoops.of gold, studded with the finest brilliants. The diamond flowers between the arches are of the shape of the emblem of Gallic sovereignty, the <foreign lang=fr>fleur de lis.</foreign>
 This splendid crown, which is unrivalled in value and elegance, is enclosed in a glass globe, which is made to revolve by some ingenious machinery, invented by Mr. March, the resident officer of the board of works in the Tower. By this means, the spectators see every part of it, while <num value="6">six</num> powerful argand lamps are so disposed, as to throw upon the jewels every hue their prisms can exhibit. 
<p>To the north of the White Tower is the grand store-house, a noble building, extending <num value="345">three hundred and forty-five</num> feet in length, by <num value="60">sixty</num> feet in breadth. It was begun by king James II. who built it to the <num value="1">first</num> floor; but king William III. erected that magnificent room, called the new, or small, armoury; in which, when finished, he and his queen, Mary, dined in great form, having all the warrant workmen and labourers to attend them, dressed in new aprons and white gloves. 
<p>This noble structure is of brick and stone, and on the north side is a stately door case, adorned with <num value="4">four</num> columns, an entablature and triangular pediment of the Doric order. Under the pediment are the king's arms, with enrichments of ornamental trophy-work, by the celebrated artist Gibbons. 
<p>The next objects of attention in the Tower are the armouries, of which descriptions have been confidently given, assigning much higher antiquity than is correct. The learned Dr. Meyrick, in his valuable  <QUOTE>Inquiry into the Origin of Armour,</QUOTE>  satisfactorily proves,  <QUOTE>that although in private families a few suits of <pb id="p.537" n="537"> earlier date had been preserved in Italy, that of Maximilian, with its steel lamboys, and that of Henry VII., resembling it, are the oldest specimens in Germany and England.</QUOTE>  
<p>It appears from a survey made by order of Charles II. in <datestruct VALUE="1660-10--"><month reg="10">October</month> <year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, that the principal armour now in the Tower was then at Greenwich, whence it has subsequently been removed. During the civil distractions of the preceding reign, the armoury in the Green Gallery, at Greenwich, was despoiled by the soldiers, and that which remained was afterwards transferred to the Tower. In this survey, which is signed by sir John Robinson, lieutenant of the Tower, and other officers appointed to make the investigation, there is not the slightest mention of the Spanish armoury, or the thumbscrews, racks, &amp;c. which now form so attractive a feature in this exhibition; and yet the surveyors give a very minute list of every thing found in the armouries of the Tower and Greenwich. The Spanish armoury must therefore have been made up subsequent to the reign of Charles II. In Burghley's State Papers, a lottery of foreign armour, probably that of the Armada, is said to have been drawn in the <num value="29">29th</num> year of Elizabeth, and if the instruments of torture, and the Catholic banner, now exhibited, are really spoils of the Armada, they must have been collected at least a century after they were dispersed by the lottery. There is, however, so little reason to believe, that any portion of the armour, called Spanish, is really so, that little faith can be placed in the authenticity of the instruments of torture, which the growing enmity to the Roman Catholics would readily ascribe to them.<NOTE><BIBL>Percy Histories, London, i. <num value="245">245</num></BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The charges that are made for admission to these  <QUOTE>shews,</QUOTE>  added to the demands of those persons who conduct strangers to view them, form a ground for loud and universal complaint, and are justly looked upon by foreigners as a scandal and disgrace to the nation. 
<p>After having noticed the doubts entertained as to the accuracy of the exhibitions in the Tower, a brief survey of the armouries will suffice: 
<p>Near the south-west angle of the White Tower is the 
<div2 type=section id="c.17.5">

<HEAD>Spanish Armada.</HEAD>
 
<p>In this room are <num value="2">two</num> large and lofty racks, furnished with the Spanish spoils, and ingeniously displayed, interspersed with a diversity of swords, bayonets, sword-blades, and pistols; <num value="2">two</num> Spanish brass musketoons, also a pair of brass wall pieces, with swivels--they are nearly <num value="5">five</num> feet long; <num value="2">two</num> very large serpents, ingeniously formed with the points of bayonets; <num value="2">two</num> military <pb id="p.538" n="538"> fans, and a variety of other remarkable devices, composed of sword-blades, &amp;c. 
<p>At each end of the above racks are fluted pillars, composed of pikes, <num value="13">13</num> feet in length, and over them are Highlanders' pistols, entirely manufactured of iron and steel, forming a cornice. Above these cornices, very ancient breast-plates and helmets are placed, as also <num value="12">twelve</num> curious figures affixed to the girders; they are composed of Spanish spears, heads of Maltese halberts, &amp;c. 
<p>At the south end of the room is a fine representation of the sun, his rays being composed of sword and bayonet blades. 
<p>At the same part of the room is a figure representing queen Elizabeth, in the attitude of reviewing her troops at Tilbury camp. The figures, which are well executed, being nearly as large and as natural as life, represent the queen, her page, and her horse. The upper robe of the queen's dress is of rich crimson velvet, vandyked, trimmed with a broad gold lace, and lined with silk of the same colour; also a broad cape, which is edged round with gold lace, and has a neat crown at each corner. Her inner dress is green velvet, ingeniously embroidered and trimmed round with broad gold lace; her petticoat is rich white silk, ornamented with a profusion of flowers, spangles, pearls, &amp;c., also trimmed with a broad gold lace and green velvet; her stomacher is superbly set with diamonds, pearls, &amp;c. She has rich rings on her fingers, and ruffles round her wrists, also a large ruff round her neck; her head is adorned with a fine crown, pearls, spangles, &amp;c. She wears white silk stockings, and green satin shoes on her feet, ornamented with gold lace, &amp;c. Her majesty is standing a little without the entrance of an elegant tent, hung with purple drapery, fluted, together with curtains of the same colour, (and others of green) appearing in front, ornamented with a gilt cornice, handsome tassels, roses, and rich fringe. 
<p>At each side of the tent are <num value="2">two</num> standards, taken at St. Eustatia, by admiral Rodney and general Vaughan, in the American war; that with the Moor's head in the middle was the negroes' colours; the other was taken from the top of the fort. 
<p>The whole is enclosed with a fine representation of Tilbury Fort, in imitation of bricks and hewn stones, on which are placed <num value="10">ten</num> pieces of brass cannon, neatly mounted on proper carriages. These cannon were presented to Charles II. when about <num value="9">nine</num> years of age, to assist him in learning the art of war, by the brass foundry of London. The inscriptions on them are, C. P., a plume of feathers, <foreign lang=de><emph rend=caps>Ich dien</emph></foreign>, <datestruct value="1638--"><year reg="1638">1638</year></datestruct>-<num value="9">9</num>, and the artists' names, John Brown and Thomas Pitt, which altogether has a very grand and striking effect. 
<p>A wooden cannon, called Policy, because, when Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, besieged Boulogne by the command of king Henry VIII. being aware that the roads were impassable for heavy cannon, he caused a number of wooden ones to be 
<pb id="p.539" n="539"><FIGURE id="Fig.539"><HEAD>Ancient Axe</HEAD></FIGURE>
 made, and mounted on proper batteries before the town in the night, as if real cannon; which so terrified the French commandant in the morning, that he gave up the place without firing a shot. 
<p>An Indian suit of armour, sent as a present to king Charles II. from the great Mogul. It is made of iron quills about <num value="2">two</num> inches long, finely japanned and ranged in rows, <num value="1">one</num> row easily slipping over another; these are bound very strong together with silk twist, and are used in that country as a defence against darts and arrows. 
<p>The Spanish General's Shield, not worn by, but carried before him, as an ensign of honour. Upon it are depicted, in very curious workmanship, some of the labours of Hercules, and other expressive allegories, which seem to throw a shade upon the boasted skill of modern artists. This was made near an <num value="100">hundred</num> years before the art of printing was known in England; and upon it is the following inscription in Roman characters: <foreign lang=la><emph rend=caps>Advlterio Deianira conspurcans occidite Cacvs ab Hercvl opprimitvr</emph></foreign>, <datestruct value="1379--"><year reg="1379">1379</year></datestruct>, alluding to Hercules killing of Cacus, for adultery with his wife Dejanira. 
<p>The Axe by which Queen Anne Boleyn, and many of the nobility, were beheaded. 
<p>Spanish Cravats and Bilboes; the <num value="1">first</num> are engines of torture made of iron, intended to lock the feet, arms, and hands together. The last are also made of iron, and were intended, as the warder informs you, to yoke the English prisoners, <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="2">two</num>. 
<p>Spanish Thumb-Screws; of which there were several chests full on board the Armada. The use they were intended for is said to have been to extort confession from the English where their money was kept, had they prevailed. 
<p>A Tomahawk, and <num value="6">six</num> clubs, brought from Copenhagen. 
<p>Pistols, fixed in the centre of shields, so contrived that the pistols might be fired, and the persons who used them covered at the same time. They were fired by match-locks, and the aim taken through a little grate in the shield, which was at that time pistol-proof. <pb id="p.540" n="540"> 
<p>A Danish and Saxon club, as also a Saxon Sword; said to have been used by those violent invaders, when they attempted to conquer this country. These are, perhaps, the greatest curiosities in the Tower. 
<p>Spanish Ranceurs; made in different forms, and intended either to kill men on horseback, to cut the horses' reins, or to pull men off their horses. 
<p>Spanish Spears and Lances, finely engraved; on <num value="1">one</num> of these are <num value="3">three</num> heads, supposed to be the pope's, Philip II.&lsquo;s, and queen Mary's; and on another is fixed a piece of gold, representing the sun in full splendour; some of them are also ornamented with a silk fringe. 
<p>King Henry VII.&lsquo;s Walking-Staff; which has <num value="3">three</num> match lock pistols in it, with coverings to keep the charges dry, and a short bayonet, or dagger, in the center of the barrels. With this staff, we are informed, the king walked sometimes round the city to see that the constables and watchmen did their duty. 
<p>A Spanish Boarding-Pike; it has <num value="6">six</num> spikes and a spear at <num value="1">one</num> end, and a match-lock pistol at the other. 
<p>Spanish Spadas, or long swords, poisoned at the points at that time; so that if a man received ever so slight a wound, it would prove certain death. 
<p>A piece of a Scythe, placed on a pole; being a specimen of weapons taken at the battle of Sedgmoor, in the reign of king James II. 
<p>The Spanish General's Halbert; covered with velvet: the nails were double gilt, and on the top is the pope's head, curiously engraven. 
<p>A Spanish Battle-axe; so contrived as to cut <num value="4">four</num> holes in a man's skull at once. It has also a pistol, with a match-lock at <num value="1">one</num> end, and a spear with a lance at the other. 
<p>Medusa's Head, commonly called the Witch of Endor; it is ornamented with Spanish pikes, &amp;c. fixed to the ceiling, and several other devices similarly ornamented. 
<p>The Invincible Banner; so stiled by the pope, with a crucifix upon it; for his holiness, it is said, came to the water-side when the Spanish Armada was about to weigh anchor, viewed it, and sent his banner on board with his approbation and blessing, pronouncing the whole to be invincible. 
<div2 type=section id="c.17.6"><HEAD>The New Horse Armoury.<NOTE>It cannot be regretted too much that government should have allowed a paltry building like that containing the New Horse Armoury to have been erected against the venerable and noble White Tower; it totally destroys the fine effect of that ancient edifice from the only situation where it could be seen with advantage, viz., the open square in which it is situated. Surely there were other places to have built upon without defacing the most perfect specimen of Norman military architecture in the kingdom T. A.</NOTE></HEAD>
 
<p>This is a spacious room, <num value="149">149</num> feet by <num value="33">33</num>, in which are arranged <pb id="p.541" n="541"> in regular and chronological order, <num value="22">twenty-two</num> equestrian figures, comprising many of the most celebrated kings of England, accompanied by their favorite lords of the highest rank, all of them, together with their horses, in the armour of the respective periods when they flourished; many, indeed, in the identical suits in which they appeared while living. Along the center of the ceiling, immediately over each figure, is a Gothic arch, on the columns of which, on the right-hand side of the effigies represented, and on the left of the spectator, when he stands before the horses' heads, is fixed a crimson banner, which, in letters of gold, on both sides, expresses the name, rank, and date of existence of the personage on its left. The horses stand, mounted by their riders, almost without any visible support, on a floor of brick, raised a little from the adjoining boarded flooring, which is appropriated to the spectators, and fenced off, both before and behind, by a light iron railing. This judicious arrangement converts the remaining part of the room into an extensive promenade; between which and the walls, there has, notwithstanding, been found sufficient space to insert many interesting and appropriate curiosities. The walls of the building are also decorated with a profusion of pieces of armour, military instruments, &amp;c. with the dates of the time when they were in use, neatly inscribed on the spot.<NOTE>The date in every instance is correct, but as only <num value="10">ten</num> suits can positively be identified, these are printed in italic.</NOTE>
 
<p>In the left corner of the building, as you enter, standing a little backward in the line of equestrian figures, is the effigy of 
<p><num value="1">1</num>. Edward I. king of England, A. D. <datestruct value="1272"><year reg="1272">1272</year></datestruct>. The armour of this figure consists of the hawberk and its sleeves of mail, the hood and chausses of the same material; and on the body is the sarcoat, emblazoned with the royal arms before and behind. This monarch is represented in the act of sheathing his sword. 
<p><num value="2">2</num>. Henry VI. king of England, A. D. <datestruct value="1450"><year reg="1450">1450</year></datestruct>. This plate armour is of the most beautiful form, particularly the back plate, which, like that of the breast, is made of several pieces, to be flexible, The battle-axe of the period, the long pointed toes of the sollerets, and the great spurs, cannot fail to attract notice. The horse is caparisoned with the arms of France and England; and the king wears on his head the salade, on which is the knight's cap, surmounted by the crest. The saddle of bone-work is particularly curious. 
<p><num value="3">3</num>. Edward IV. king of England, A.D. <datestruct value="1465"><year reg="1465">1465</year></datestruct>. This is a complete suit of tournament armour, furnished with additional pieces termed grand-guard, volant piece, and gard-de-bras. The vamplate of the lance is of a very rare form, and the horse is in a housing, powdered with the king's badges, the white rose and sun. 
<p><num value="4">4</num>. Henry VII. king of England, A. D. <datestruct value="1508"><year reg="1508">1508</year></datestruct>. This is a fluted suit of elegant form, probably of German manufacture.

<p><hi rend=italics><num value="6">6</num>. Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk</hi>, A. D. <datestruct value="1520"><year reg="1520">1520</year></datestruct>. He also is represented in plate armour, and in the act of saluting with his sword the before mentioned sovereign. 
<p><num value="7">7</num>. Edward Clinton, earl of Lincoln, A. D. <datestruct value="1535"><year reg="1535">1535</year></datestruct>. This nobleman's armour is very elegantly gilt, and his right hand rests on a mace. He wears a long fluted sword. 
<p><num value="8">8</num>. Edward VI. king of England, A. D. <datestruct value="1552"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct>. This figure is particularly deserving of notice, both on account of its armour, which is what was termed russet, and gilt in the most curious manner throughout, and also for the fine attitude in which it is placed. The youthful monarch stands firmly in the left stirrup, with his face and body inclined to the right, and while with his left hand he points to some distant object, his right grasps a curiously engraved and ornamented mace. 
<p><num value="9">9</num>. Francis Hastings, earl of Huntingdon, A. D. <datestruct value="1555"><year reg="1555">1555</year></datestruct>. This is a suit of plate armour, richly gilt ; its wearer is resting the blade of his drawn sword on his left arm. 
<p><num value="10">10</num>. <hi rend=italics>Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester</hi>, <datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>. The earl of Leicester's suit is covered with his initials R. D. in some places, with the collar of the garter in others; as also with the figure of St. Michael, and the earl's badge of the ragged staff: it was originally gilt. He holds a sword in his right hand, with which he is pointing. 
<p><num value="11">11</num>. Sir Henry Lea, master of the armoury, A. D. <datestruct value="1570"><year reg="1570">1570</year></datestruct>. He holds in his right hand a battle-axe, the head of which rests upon his shoulder. Sir Henry Lea was of Ditchley in Oxfordshire, where is preserved his portrait, with that of his faithful dog. He was champion to queen Elizabeth, and master of the armouries. 
<p><num value="12">12</num>. Robert Devereux, earl of Essex, A. D. <datestruct value="1585"><year reg="1585">1585</year></datestruct>. This is a fine suit of armour, inlaid with gold. The cantle of the saddle is very beautifully engraved and gilt. In his right hand he holds a short sword, of curious workmanship. 
<p><num value="13">13</num>. James I. king of England, A.D. <datestruct value="1605"><year reg="1605">1605</year></datestruct>. This monarch who, it will be remembered, was also James VI. of Scotland, wears a plain suit of armour. He holds, in a perpendicular direction, with his right hand, a tilting-lance, <num value="14">fourteen</num> feet long, and <num value="2">two</num> feet <num value="3">three</num> inches in circumference in the thickest part, with which it was customary to run at the ring. 
<p><num value="14">14</num>. Sir Horace Vere, captain-general, A. D. <datestruct value="1606"><year reg="1606">1606</year></datestruct>. This nobleman is, as it were, in attendance upon his sovereign, and holds in his right hand a small mace. 
<p><num value="15">15</num>. Thomas Howard, earl of Arundel, A.D. <datestruct value="1608"><year reg="1608">1608</year></datestruct>. This figure, like the foregoing, has his eye towards his sovereign. He supports a mace on his right shoulder. 
<p><num value="16">16</num>. <hi rend=italics>Henry, Prince of Wales</hi>, son of James I., A. D. <datestruct value="1612"><year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct>. This most beautiful suit of armour is highly deserving the attention of <pb id="p.543" n="543"> the curious. It is engraved throughout with subjects relating to battles, sieges, the burning of cities, &amp;c.; and is richly gilt. The point of his sword rests on his right stirrup; a mace depends from his saddle-bow. 
<p><num value="17">17</num>. George Villiers, duke of Buckingham, A. D. <datestruct value="1618"><year reg="1618">1618</year></datestruct>. This, it will be recollected, was the unfortunate favourite of Charles I. who was assassinated by Felton. Lord Clarendon, in his History of the Rebellion, relates a very remarkable communication which was made to the duke in private, by a stranger, a short time previous to his death; and which in substance predicted the near approach of that fatal event. He is in the act of spanning a wheel-lock pistol. 
<p><num value="18">18</num>. <hi rend=italics>Charles, Prince of Wales</hi>, afterwards Charles I. A. D. <datestruct value="1620"><year reg="1620">1620</year></datestruct>. This figure represents him when apparently about <num value="12">twelve</num> years of age. He wears a suit of ornamental armour. 
<p><num value="19">19</num>. Thomas Wentworth, earl of Stafford, A.D. <datestruct value="1635"><year reg="1635">1635</year></datestruct>. The armour of this nobleman descends no lower than his knees, the use of leg pieces having been discontinued about this period. 
<p><num value="20">20</num>. <hi rend=italics>Charles I. king of England</hi>, A. D. <datestruct value="1640"><year reg="1640">1640</year></datestruct>. The surface of this suit of armour is entirely gilt. It is very curiously wrought, and was presented to him by the city of London, when he was prince of Wales. This armour was laid on the coffin of the great duke of Marlborough, at his funeral procession, on which occasion a collar of SS&lsquo;s was placed around it. The king holds in his right hand a truncheon, and the chanfron, or head armour of his horse, is furnished with a pointed spear between the eyes of the animal. 
<p><num value="21">21</num>. James II. king of England, A. D. <datestruct value="1685"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>. This remarkable figure is the last in the very superior collection which we have been describing. The circumstances of his present position somewhat appropriately correspond with his well known abdication of the throne and flight from the kingdom: he has left the company of his brother sovereigns and the enclosures assigned to them, and appears to be stealing cautiously along, close to the wall, and in a corner of the building, with his horse's head towards the door. His dress consists of a drab-coloured velvet coat, with large covered buttons, laced with silver, worn over a bright blue velvet waistcoat, ornamented with gold lace; a long and curling black wig encircles his face, and falls down upon his shoulders, above which appears a capacious white neckcloth, tied in a large bow; and a pair of very large jack-boots, with gilt spurs, completes the description of his wearing apparel. His only armour is a cuirass, a gauntlet for the left hand, extending to his elbow as a protection; and a helmet, with ornamented bars of brass, the grating of which represent the form of the king's arms, and has on it the letters  <QUOTE> I. R. H.</QUOTE>  On each side of the horse are the pistol-holsters, made of velvet, and richly embroidered with the crown and the initials I. R. in gold lace, &amp;c.; these letters are also repeated in a double flourish, on a <pb id="p.544" n="544"> larger scale, at the extremities of the saddle-cloth. He wears a sword by his side, and has a baton in his hand; and the striking contrast which his appearance affords, when compared with the rest of the equestrian figures, is well worthy of observation. 
<p>From hence we enter a small room or recess opposite, in which is situated <num value="1">one</num> of the outer doors of the building. The centre of the ceiling here is inscribed with the word  <QUOTE>Waterloo,</QUOTE>  in gold letters, irradiated on its sides with a border of bright bayonets, and covered with cuirasses formerly belonging to the French army under Napoleon. On each side is a glass case, containing many very curious articles; amongst these are a couple of cross-bows of the time of Henry VIII. with the iron windlasses used for winding up; a Spanish collar of torture; a Florentine dagger and poniard of the period of Elizabeth, with stains of blood still upon it: a combined weapon of the reign of James I. in form resembling a small battle axe, but which contains <num value="6">six</num> pistol-barrels, a wheel-lock, a matchlock, &amp;c. ; and some beautiful specimens of pistols, carbines, muskets, fowling pieces, &amp;c. of the respective times of James I., Charles I. and William III. 
<p>In this small room, is a well carved and painted horse, on which is an elegant saddle covered with crimson velvet, richly embroidered with gold, and very curious stirrups; also a Turkish bridle and breast-plate for a horse, with gilt furniture, from Grand Cairo. 
<p>Returning and passing the inner door of this recess, and again entering the long room, we proceed, by the front wall, to the other extremity of the building. In our progress we observe various figures, of the size of life, illustrative of the armour, costume, &amp;c. of various classes of the military at the periods to which they have reference. These stand on pedestals, on which is inscribed their description and date. The <num value="1">first</num> on the right is 
<p>A Pikeman of the reign of Charles I. His armour is of a brown colour, studded with brass headed nails. The defence for his thighs consists of long flaps, called tassets, made of the same material as the body armour, to which they are attached by hinges, so as to lift up or let down. He holds in his right hand a pike about <num value="12">twelve</num> feet long. 
<p>An archer of the year <datestruct value="1590"><year reg="1590">1590</year></datestruct>. This figure is dressed in green; he wears, however, a brigandine jacket, which is a kind of doublet, containing pieces of iron, and curiously quilted. He is furnished with a bow and quiver. 
<p>We are now arrived opposite the centre recess in the front wall; but, before we begin to describe its contents, we must notice the <num value="2">two</num> figures on foot and in armour, which are stationed on each side of it. They represent <num value="2">two</num> suits of armour, actually made for Henry VIII. The armour of the <num value="1">first</num>, dated <datestruct value="1509--"><year reg="1509">1509</year></datestruct>, is rough from the hammer, and is the most complete in the collection. The date of the <num value="2">second</num> is <datestruct value="1512--"><year reg="1512">1512</year></datestruct>, and this suit was made for combats on foot. <pb id="p.545" n="545"> 
<p>Just beyond the figures last described, are <num value="2">two</num> pieces of ordnance, mounted, taken by general Wolfe at Quebec. 
<p>Our attention is now irresistibly attracted by the equestrian figure (No. <num value="22">22</num>) of <hi rend=italics>king Henry VIII.</hi> in the recess. The highly curious suit of armour in which this monarch is habited, was a present from the emperor Maximilian the <num value="1">First</num>, to the king of England, on his marriage in <datestruct value="1509--"><year reg="1509">1509</year></datestruct>, with Katherine of Arragon, and has on it the congratulatory word, <QUOTE>gluck,</QUOTE> <gloss>prosperity.</gloss> It is covered with engravings, representing the legends of saints, interspersed with the king's badges, and is washed over with silver. The attitudes both of the horse and his rider are exceedingly spirited; the animal rears up on his hind legs, while the king leans forward, in the act of elevating a drawn sword. Above the head of the king is the following inscription:

<p>In this recess, on each side, is a small figure in armour, standing in a niche, and on a pedestal. They represent <num value="2">two</num> sons of monarchs; the left figure being prince Henry, son of James I. dated <datestruct value="1604--"><year reg="1604">1604</year></datestruct>; and that on the right, Charles, prince of Wales, <datestruct value="1636--"><year reg="1636">1636</year></datestruct>, afterwards Charles II. Above and around the recess are many curious pieces of armour, head and breast-plates, together with the halberts, pikes, &amp;c. of the period in which Henry VIII. flourished. 
<p>Leaving the recess, the next object on our right is 
<p>A Foot Soldier, <datestruct value="1540--"><year reg="1540">1540</year></datestruct>. This is an interesting figure, with a <num value="2">two</num>-handed sword; and his long beard, black dress, and dark armour, forms a striking contrast with the soldiers of the present day. 
<p>A Swordsman, <datestruct value="1506--"><year reg="1506">1506</year></datestruct>. He is encased in half armour, with a puckered velvet skirt, which reaches from his loins to his knees, and gradually widens as it descends. <pb id="p.546" n="546"> 
<p>A very curious crimson helmet, richly embroidered, and a quilted belt, also embroidered: they formerly belonged to Tippoo Saib. 
<p>A straight Sword, with a broad blade, the hilt of which is iron, inlaid with gold, originally belonging to Tippoo Sultan. 
<p>These and several other curious articles in this and in the Small Armoury, were purchased at the sale of the collection of H. R. H. the late duke of York. 
<p>In the recess which we passed through upon our <num value="1">first</num> entrance is contained a stirrup and cross-bow of the time of Henry V., parts of a jazarine jacket, some curious helmets, breast-plates, a chanfron, a collar of bandalies for charges of powder, &amp;c. &amp;c. 
<p>The wall before the equestrian figures forms an extensive recess of about <num value="3">three</num>-fourths of the length of the building, the bottom of which is about <num value="4">four</num> feet higher than the floor of the building. From the initials  <QUOTE> C. R.</QUOTE>  on the banners, and a nearer inspection, we perceive that the whole forms a most extensive collection of specimens of the armour, pikes, accoutrements, ensigns, &amp;c. of the adherents to the royal cause in the time of Charles I. The centre consists of a body of pikemen, with their weapons; on the right and left of these appear the curassiers, and its <num value="2">two</num> wings are formed of cavaliers, in their more complete armour, each supporting a lance. At the back of the recess, in the centre, are arranged trumpets and banners of the period, smaller specimens of armour, <num value="2">two</num> Highland swords, with pistols and targets, &amp;c. The whole forms a most striking memento of the unhappy intestine commotions which distracted this kingdom in the reign of the unfortunate Charles. 
<p>A Man at Arms, <datestruct value="1530--"><year reg="1530">1530</year></datestruct>, guards the left extremity of this recess. He is raised on a pedestal from the floor of the building. His height is upwards of <num value="6">six</num> feet; he wears a large suit of complete armour, and supports himself with a reversed mace, the head of which touches the ground. 
<p>A Demi-Launcer, <datestruct value="1555--"><year reg="1555">1555</year></datestruct>, is also posted at the right-hand end of the recess to correspond. 
<p>Underneath the recess, and along the whole length of the wall, in which it is formed, are arranged, in regular order, various specimens of ordnance of different periods. 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> on the left is the most ancient: it is a very long and rudely-formed cannon; it has on it the <foreign lang=fr>fleurs-de-lis</foreign>: the barrel is encompassed with iron hoops, and furnished with rings, instead of a carriage. It is assigned to the time of Henry VI. 
<p>Henry VII. A very large piece of brass ordnance of this period, marked with the king's arms, the portcullis, and the <foreign lang=la>fleur-de-lis.</foreign>
  Henry VIII. The largest piece of ordnance in the collection, with the date <datestruct value="1542"><year reg="1542">1542</year></datestruct>; it is ornamented with the rose and garter, surmounted by the French crown; and weighs upwards of <num value="5">five</num> tons. <pb id="p.547" n="547"> <num value="2">Two</num> other small pieces, the <num value="1">first</num> containing <num value="7">seven</num> barrels, and the other, <num value="3">three</num>, with grooves instead of touch-holes. 
<p>Specimens of ordnance in the reigns of Edwards VI., Mary I., and Elizabeth succeed in order. 
<p>Next to these is a very beautiful specimen, dated <datestruct value="1608--"><year reg="1608">1608</year></datestruct>. It is covered with rich carved work, and ornamented with the prince of Wales's plume. This cannon was manufactured for Henry, eldest son of James I., by the celebrated artists, Thomas and Richard Pitt. 
<p>Another, by the same makers, for Charles, prince of Wales, <datestruct value="1621--"><year reg="1621">1621</year></datestruct>, is well worthy of notice: it is embellished with the representation of Hercules's club, the lion's skin, an eagle in the clouds, &amp;c. 
<p>A well-finished piece, of the time of Charles II. <datestruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>. 
<p>James II. A very curious French piece of ordnance, of a triple description, having <num value="2">two</num> barrels abreast, and <num value="1">one</num> at top. 
<p><num value="2">Two</num> Pavoises, of the time of James I., a kind of shield suspended from the wall, concludes our description. 
<p>The <num value="2">two</num> beautiful painted glass windows, exhibiting the arms and badges of Henry VIII. and George IV. were executed by that clever artist, Mr. Willement, of Green-street, Grosvernor-square. 
<p>A couple of ancient Broad Swords, each about <num value="5">five</num> feet long, are displayed over the stained glass window, at the east end of the building. 
<p>The articles in this armoury marked thus (P) were taken from the Central Depot and the Museum of Artillery in Paris, at the capture of that city, in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, and formed a part of the share of the British army. 
<p>The next armoury is in the White Tower; it is called 
<div2 type=section id="c.17.7"><HEAD>The Volunteer Armoury.</HEAD>
 
<p>This room contains more than <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> stands of arms, curiously and conveniently arranged in racks, all bright, clean flinted, and fit for service at <num value="5">five</num> minutes notice; as also, pistols, swords, &amp;c. ingeniously displayed, and forming different devices. Here is also a fine figure of Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, wearing a curious suit of bright steel armour, holding a tilting lance in his right hand, about <num value="6">six</num> yards in length, said to be the very weapon with which he performed many of his signal exploits. This general was the most comely personage of his time, and the most accomplished in all the exercises which were then thought estimable in a courtier and soldier. On the <num value="2">second</num> floor of is building is, 
<div2 type=section id="c.17.8"><HEAD>The Sea Armoury.</HEAD>
 
<p>Here are arms for near <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> sailors and marines; a <pb id="p.548" n="548"> short and curious suit of bright steel armour, invented by the earl of Dartmouth for the light cavalry in the reign of James II., <num value="2">two</num> very handsome brass cannon, presented by the city of London to the young duke of Gloucester, queen Anne's son, to assist him in learning the art of war; several curious suits of ancient armour; also military trophies, iron caps, breast-plates, pistols, swords, spears, and abundance of bayonets, curiously displayed. 
<div2 type=section id="c.17.9"><HEAD>The Royal Train of Artillery</HEAD>
 
<p>Is on the ground-floor of the grand store-house, north of the White Tower; it is a large room, supported by <num value="42">forty-two</num> pillars, <num value="24">twenty-four</num> feet high. On each side of this room a great variety of artillery was formerly placed; many of these instruments of destruction have, during the late wars, been removed from thence, and employed in active service. 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> object is <num value="2">two</num> beautiful brass cannons, <num value="24">twenty-four</num> pounders, <num value="10">ten</num> feet long, re-cast out of some old cannon taken from the French, at the battle of Cherbourg, in the year <datestruct value="1758"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct>, and the admirable engraving upon them is said to have cost <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">500</num>l.</measure> The weight of <num value="1">one</num> of them is <num value="54">54</num>cwt. <num value="2">2</num> qrs. <num value="8">8</num>lbs., the other is <num value="52">52</num> cwt. <num value="3">3</num> qrs. <num value="10">10</num> lbs. On <num value="1">one</num> of them lord Ligonier's coat of arms is engraven in a very masterly manner, and the names of the then principal officers of the ordnance; on the other is lord Townsend's coat of arms, &amp;c. Here are also <num value="2">two</num> fine brass mortars, taken from the French at the siege of Acre, by sir Sidney Smith; they are <num value="13">thirteen</num> inches in diameter, and will throw a shell of <num value="300">300</num>lbs. weight. 
<p><num value="2">Two</num> fine brass cannons, taken from the walls of Vigo, by lord Cobham, <datestruct value="1704--"><year reg="1704">1704</year></datestruct>. Their breeches represent lions <hi rend=italics>couchant</hi>, with the effigy of St. Barbara, to whom they were dedicated. 
<p><num value="2">Two</num> famous brass field-pieces, taken from the French, which are curiously carved and decorated. 
<p><num value="2">Two</num> brass mortars, taken from the French, at the battle of Cherbourg, in the year <datestruct value="1758"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct>: each weighs <num value="2840">2,840</num>lbs. 
<p>A very ingenious engine, that throws <num value="30">thirty</num> hand grenadoes at once, and is fired by the means of a train. 
<p>A small piece of ordnance, on a travelling carriage, curiously ornamented. 
<p>A fine brass mortar, that will throw <num value="9">nine</num> shells at a time, out of which the balloons were cast at the grand fire-works in <datestruct value="1748--"><year reg="1748">1748</year></datestruct>. 
<p>An immense large iron cannon, brought from Edinburgh castle, called Mount's Mag; it is about <num value="14">fourteen</num> feet in length, and of such amazing dimensions, that a man may go into its mouth. 
<p>A very curious brass cannon, with <num value="3">three</num> bores, <num value="6">six</num>-pounder, taken by the duke of Marlborough, at the memorable battle of Ramelies. 
<p>The drum-major's chariot of state, with the kettle-drums fixed, <pb id="p.549" n="549"> which was formerly drawn by <num value="4">four</num> white horses at the head of a train, when upon a march. 
<p>An immense large mortar, weighing upwards of <num value="6000">6,000</num> lbs. and it is said, will throw a shell, of <num value="500">500</num>lb. weight, <num value="2">two</num> miles. This mortar, we are informed, was fired so often at the siege of Namur, in king William's reign, that the very touch-hole was melted, for want of giving it time to cool. The siege <hi rend=italics>of</hi> Namur is <num value="1">one</num> of the most memorable and desperate ever recorded in history. The place was thought to be impregnable, and yet it was taken from a complete army within, headed by a marshal of French, in the sight of <num value="100000">100,000</num> men without, who came to relieve it. Lord Cutts commanded the British at the general assault of the castle, where he acquired the name of the English Salamander. The greater part of his corps fell in the action: scarcely an officer or soldier came off unhurt. 
<p>Here are a number of other brass and iron cannon, as also abundance of cannon-balls of different sizes, and shells for mortars of various sizes, &amp;c. &amp;c. Ascending a noble staircase of <num value="49">forty-nine</num> steps, we enter 
<div2 type=section id="c.17.10"><HEAD>The Small Armoury.</HEAD>
 
<p>In this magnificent room, we behold arms for about <num value="150000">150,000</num> men, all new, flinted, and fit for service at <num value="5">five</num> minutes notice: a sight which it is impossible to view without astonishment. Of the dispositions of the arms, no description can give the reader a complete idea; but the following account may enable the spectator to view them to great advantage. 
<p>The arms were originally disposed in this beautiful order by Mr. Harris, a common gun-smith, who, after he had performed this wonderful work, which is the admiration of people of all nations, was allowed a pension for his ingenuity. On each side of the door is a beautiful representation of the sun; that on the east side represents him as rising, and that on the west as setting: they are irradiated with <num value="2">two</num> regular ellipses of pistols in a chequered frame of marine hangers, of a peculiar make, having brass handles, and the form of a dog's head on their pommels. 
<p><num value="4">Four</num> handsome pillars, entwined with pistols in a serpentine direction up to the top of the room, which is about <num value="22">twenty-two</num> feet high, and placed at right-angles, with the representation of a falling star on the ceiling, exactly in the middle of them, being the centre of this noble armoury, which is <num value="345">345</num> feet in length, and <num value="60">60</num> feet in breadth. 
<p>In the centre of this room is a glass case on a table, which contains the sword, sash, &amp;c. of his late royal highness the duke of York and Albany, which he wore as field marshal of the British army. They were deposited in the Tower by command of his majesty, <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>. 
<p>Here are likewise <num value="4">four</num> fluted pillars, composed of Spanish spikes, standing <num value="18">18</num> feet high, and round their tops pistols are <pb id="p.550" n="550"> placed to represent gilded cornices, as also all round the top of the room, opposite to which are <num value="300">300</num> curious suits of mail and military trophies. 
<p>On the south side of this armoury, facing the folding doors, is a very curious cannon, a <num value="2">two</num>-pounder, taken by the French at Malta, in <datestruct VALUE="1798-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>, which, with the <num value="8">eight</num> flags that are exhibited in this room, were sent, with other trophies, to the French directory by the La Sensible frigate, in which ship they were taken by the English Sea Horse, commanded by captain Foote. The cannon is made of a mixture of metal, which very much resembles gold. On it is the head of the grand master of Malta, supported by <num value="2">two</num> genii of that place, in bas relief; it is also highly ornamented with eagles, a crown, the alcoran, &amp;c. all of very exquisite workmanship. The inscriptions on it are <foreign lang=la><emph rend=caps>Horatius Antonius Alberghettus Pub. Fus. Ven. An. MDCLXXXIV. et pompa, et usa, scintilla sufficitena: terreni fulmina Martis. le Cde Boyerd Argens com. Philip Lattarellus Rom Delinet Scue</emph>, <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct></foreign>. The carriage is likewise a great curiosity; on it are the carved figures of <num value="2">two</num> furies, whose features are strongly expressive of rage. <num value="1">One</num> arm of each of them being entwined together, grasps a large snake, and in the other hand each holds a torch. From the head of <num value="1">one</num> of them issues a cluster of small snakes: those which were on the other are broken off. The centres of the wheels represent the face of the sun, and the spokes its rays. 
<p><num value="4">Four</num> of the Maltese colours hang as you enter, and the other <num value="4">four</num> at the <num value="4">four</num> corners of the room. 
<p>On each side of the above-mentioned matchless cannon, is a fine representation, in carved work, of the star and garter, thistle, rose, and crown, ornamented with pistols, swords, &amp;c. and elegantly enriched with birds, fruit, &amp;c. 
<p>Under these curious figures, some carbines, of a peculiar make, are placed, having <num value="2">two</num> fine brown barrels; <num value="1">one</num> of them is a rifle bore, and the other plain; they were invented by the duke of Richmond for the flying artillery. 
<p>A silver-mounted gun, formerly belonging to Tippoo Sultan's guard; the bayonet is made to go into the butt-end of the gun: from the collection of H. R. H. the late duke of York. 
<p>Proceeding round the room towards the west-end, on the north side, bayonets and sword-bayonets, in the form of half-moons and fans, and set in carved scollop shells. The sword-bayonet is made like the old bayonet, and differs from it only in being longer. 
<p>These bayonets, of which several other military fans are composed, are of the <num value="1">first</num> invention; they have plug handles, which go into the muzzle of the gun instead of over it, and thereby prevent the firing of the piece without shooting away the bayonet. These were invented at Bayonne, in Spain, from whence they derive their name. <pb id="p.551" n="551"> 
<p>A camp-counterpane, composed of pistols, bayonets, swords, &amp;c. with the imitation of a target in the centre, made of bayonet blades, and very curiously ornamented. 
<p>Some arms taken at Bath, in the year <datestruct value="1715"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct>, distinguished from all others in the Tower, by having what is called dog-locks, that is, a kind of lock with a catch to prevent their going off at half-cock. At the west-end of the armoury is 
<p>A beautiful eagle in the middle of a square of pistols, holding the rose and crown. 
<p>A curious figure of an ancient warrior, in a fine suit of foot armour; he has a sword in his right hand, and stands upon a pedestal, about <num value="6">six</num> feet high. 
<p><num value="2">Two</num> handsome figures of a lion and unicorn, in <num value="2">two</num> circles of pistols; they are also curiously decorated with carbines, bayonets, ancient swords, &amp;c. 
<p>A representation of a swordsman, in a suit of bright steel armour, placed upon a pedestal. 
<p>A fine eagle, holding the thistle and crown in her claws, facing the fore-mentioned, and is curiously ornamented. 
<p>We now proceed to the south side of the room, where we are shown the earl of Mar's elegant shield, in the middle of an ellipses of ancient marine hangers; they have brass handles, with a guard, and are kept very bright; over which .is the representation of <num value="3">three</num> cherubs, with a crown over their heads. 
<p>Some very curious carbines, taken from the Highlanders, in <datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct>. Here are likewise the sword of justice, with a sharp point, and the sword of mercy with a blunt <num value="1">one</num>, carried before the Pretender on his being proclaimed king of Scotland, in <datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct>. 
<p><num value="5">Five</num> brass musketoons, Spanish carbines, pistols, &amp;c. ingeniously displayed. 
<p>The arms taken from sir William Perkins, sir John Friend, Charnock, and others, concerned in the assassination plot, in <datestruct value="1696--"><year reg="1696">1696</year></datestruct>; among them is the brass blunderbuss, with which they intended to shoot king William, near Turnham Green, in his way to Hampton Court; also the carbine that Charnock engaged to shoot his majesty with as he rode a hunting. 
<p>The form of <num value="2">two</num> large pair of folding gates, made of ancient halberts, the archways of which are composed of pistols and original bayonets, and in their centre hang bandeliers, as also ancient cartouch-boxes, &amp;c. 
<p>Horsemen's carbines, hanging very artificially in furbeloes and flounces, which was the original arrangement. 
<p>A fine figure of Jupiter riding in a fiery chariot, drawn by eagles, as if in the clouds, holding a thunderbolt in his left hand, and over his head is a rainbow; it is curiously carved, and decorated with ancient bayonets and <num value="6">six</num> military fans. 
<p>Having arrived at the east end of the room, we observe <num value="2">two</num> suits of fine foot armour, <num value="1">one</num> of which holds a flaming sword <pb id="p.552" n="552"> in his right hand, and the other made for an ancient warrior. Over each of these is a semicircle of pistols, and on each side, as also beneath each of them, are placed fine brass musketoons, which represent <num value="2">two</num> handsome organs, with elegant brass pipes. 
<p>A very curious representation of an hydra, whose <num value="7">seven</num> heads are artfully carved and combined by links of pistols, and original bayonets. 
<p>A fine figure of a fiery serpent, the head and tail of which are curiously carved, and its body is decorated with ancient pistols, carved scollop shells, &amp;c. winding round in the form of a snake. 
<p>On the north side, as we return to the centre, the <num value="1">first</num> figure that attracts attention, is Medusa's head, vulgarly called the Witch of Endor, within <num value="3">three</num> regular ellipses of pistols, and <num value="4">four</num> military fans, with snakes represented as stinging her. The features are finely carved, and the whole figure contrived with curious art. 
<div2 type=section id="c.17.11"><HEAD>The Royal Menagerie</HEAD>
 
<p>Is at the west entrance, a few yards within the outer gate: over this exhibition has been appointed a keeper from very early time, as may be learned from the records; and more particularly from the appointment of Robert Marsfield, esq. to that office by king Henry VI. And it further appears by the said records in the Tower, that this office was continued by letters patent by succeeding kings to some person of distinction and quality, with an allowance of sixpence a day, and an apartment for himself, conveniencies for the wild beasts, and sixpence a day for the maintenance of every lion and leopard; which seem to have been the only beasts kept here for many ages, except a white bear and an elephant in the days of king Henry III., who, in the <num value="36">thirty-sixth</num> year of his reign, issued orders to the sheriffs of London, dated at St. Edmund's, <datestruct VALUE="-09-13"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=13>13</day></datestruct>, and again at Windsor, <datestruct VALUE="-09-29"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=29>29</day></datestruct>, for them to allow <measure value="4d." type=currency><num value="4">four</num>-pence</measure> a day for the maintenance of a white bear and his keeper in the Tower of London; whom also he next year commanded to provide a muzzle and an iron chain to hold the bear out of the water, and a long and strong cord to hold the same bear fishing (or washing) himself in the river Thames; which command was dated at Windsor, on the <datestruct VALUE="-10-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>. And in the years <datestruct value="1255--"><year reg=1255>1255</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1256--"><year reg=1256>1256</year></datestruct> came out the following precepts: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>The king to the sheriffs of London greeting; 
<p>We command you, that of the farm of our city ye cause (without delay) to be built at our Tower of London <num value="1">one</num> house, of <num value="40">forty</num> feet long and <num value="20">twenty</num> feet deep, for our elephant. 
<p>Dated <datestruct VALUE="-02-26"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=26>26</day></datestruct>.<NOTE><BIBL>Liberat. <num value="39">39</num> lien. III.</BIBL></NOTE></QUOTE>
 
<p>Again, the next year the king, on the <datestruct VALUE="-10-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, commanded the said elephant and his keeper such  <QUOTE>necessaries as should be reasonably needful.</QUOTE>  <pb id="p.553" n="553"> 
<p><datestruct VALUE="1604-06-3"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=3>3</day>, <year reg=1604>1604</year></datestruct>, king James II taking with him the duke of Lenox (with divers earls and lords) went to see the lions at the Tower. And here he caused <num value="2">two</num> of them, a lion and lioness, to be put forth; and then a live cock was cast to them, which being their natural enemy, they presently killed it, and sucked the blood. Then the king caused a live lamb to be put to them; which the lions, out of their generosity, (as having respect to its innocence) never offered to touch, although the lamb was so bold as to go close to them. Then the king caused the lions to be taken away, and another lion to be put forth, and <num value="2">two</num> mastiffs to be turned to him. The mastiffs presently flew upon the lion, and turned him upon his back; and though the lion was superior to them in strength, yet it seems they were his match in courage.<NOTE><BIBL>Maitland.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>There was a spaniel dog, for some offence or other, cast into the lion's den; but the lion did not attempt to hurt him: and this dog continued in the den with the lion several years, and there died. 
<p>In the month of <datestruct VALUE="1609-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1609">1609</year></datestruct>, a resolution was taken to make trial of the valour of the lion, which was by turning him loose to a bear. The bear was brought into an open yard, and the lion was turned out of his den to him; but he would not assault him, but fled from him: and so it was done with other lions, <num value="1">one</num> after another. And, lastly, <num value="2">two</num> together were turned to him; but none set upon him, but rather sought to return to their dens. A stone-horse soon after being put into the yard with the <num value="1">first</num> lion and the bear, the horse fell to grazing between them. After he had gazed a little upon them, <num value="2">two</num> mastiff dogs were let in, who boldly fought with the lion. Afterwards <num value="6">six</num> dogs more were let in, who flew upon the horse, being most in sight, at their entrance, and would soon have worried him to death, had not <num value="3">three</num> stout bear-herds entered, and rescued the horse, and brought away the dogs, while the lion and bear stood staring upon them. At this sight were present king James I., the queen, the prince, and divers great lords. 
<p>Great improvements and additions to this exhibition have recently been made. The larger animals, of which there is a noble collection, are confined in dens, disposed in the form of a half-moon, in order that a full and comprehensive view may be at once afforded. The construction of the dens is also deserving attention, inasmuch as they present every facility for cleanliness, being divided into <num value="2">two</num> apartments, the upper and the lower, in the latter of which the beasts may be made to retire at the will of the keeper. The whole are judiciously fronted with large iron gates, for the <num value="2">two</num>-fold purpose of exhibition and security. The collection of wild beasts, birds, reptiles, &amp;c. are extensive and kept in excellent order, and this exhibition, perhaps, is the most respectable in the Tower. 
<p>Exclusive of the buildings mentioned and described, there are several handsome houses for the chief and inferior officers, the <pb id="p.554" n="554"> mess-house for the officers of the garrison, and the barracks for the soldiers. In addition to these, there is a street called the Mint, which includes nearly <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3">third</num> part of the Tower. The principal part of the houses were formerly inhabited by the officers employed in the coinage; but now by the military, as government have erected a very extensive and majestic structure to the north of Little Tower-hill, for the business of the Mint department, with houses for the said officers. 
<p>The military jurisdiction of the constable of the Tower extends greatly beyond the liberties of that fortress, and includes a considerable part of the county of Middlesex, under the denomination of the Tower Hamlets; the names of which are as follow:
