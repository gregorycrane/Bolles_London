<p>Can I better take a motto for my essay,
than by reviving my memory of Academic Latin, and making <name type="person" key="Horace">Horace</name>, courtly
and laurel-crowned, say for me <foreign lang="la">"Collegisse
juvat"</foreign>? For you may translate these words,
"It is delightful to have been a Collector";
and although the graceful Roman only
applied them to "Olympian dust," their
philosophy is broader than this. Among
the keenest pleasures of life in hope, in
acquisition, memory, there is hardly one to
surpass the Collector's joy. His field is the
world; the objects of his desire range indifferently from blackened postage stamps to
Greek vases and diamonds;- if he be a
Christian, immortality suggests to him the
glorious possibility of unending explorations
in the star-sown depths of space.
<p>And yet it grieves me that there is no
more dignified and sonorous name to apply
<pb n="12" id="p.12">
to the subject of this eulogy. Many separate
species of the vast genus Collector possess
learned or satirical titles. Thus a Collector
of Insects is an Entomologist or a Bug-Hunter
- a Book-Collector, a Bibliophile, a Biblio-maniac or a Book-Worm -while the man
who tries to enrich his cabinet with fossil
forms of life and who would not disdain to
be styled a Palaeontologist is described in
Philistine circles as a Stone-Smasher. But
there is no one generous and noble term in
which center all these separate characters
and tastes; so I must simply call him "The
Collector," although I know that in doing so,
I employ a title which in practical life is too
closely associated with bad debts, water-rates,
taxes, pew-rents and assessments to touch
any nerve of poetry in the common mind.
<p>And since, as you may have suspected,
like <name type="person" key="Henry Thoreau">Thoreau</name> in his "Walden," <quote lang="en
">"I do not
propose to write an Ode to Dejection, but
crow as lustily as Chanticleer on his perch,"</quote>
there are certain misconceptions of the place
and value of the Collector in modern society,
which, first of all, I must correct. I shall
never be able to rouse you to a proper
enthusiasm till this is done. You have
<pb n="13" id="p.13">
never begun to live until you have begun to
collect; and if you have already flung away
half of your earthly span without feeling the
thrill and zest of the Collector's art, my
missionary labors become all the more imperative for me and necessary to you.
<p> I am well aware that to sing the Collector's
praises in any large American city may appear
to a purely critical mind as superfluous a
charity as sending ice to Labrador or fashion-plates to <placeName key="Paris">Paris</placeName>. For many years the French
have had a world-wide reputation as the
most enthusiastic and universal collectors on
the earth.<note place="foot" n="*"><name type="person" key="J. J. Osborne">J. J. Osborne</name> in Oddities of Paris, (Scribner,
December, <date value="1879">1879</date>), says:
<quote lang="en">"There is nothing odder in Paris than the private
collections, especially the cabinets of pictures. Had
<name type="person" key="Raphael">Raphael</name> lived a thousand years, and painted day and
night, he could not have covered the canvas shown in
Paris as his works. Some of these collections contain
the clothes of eminent people; others have buttons;
others still have shoes; here are snuff-boxes; there
are wigs; yonder are fire-irons. All sorts of trash
have their idolaters, as I discover when I visit these
queer nooks. I come away convinced there is nothing
lost in this world. The earnest look, the important
air, and the pride these people take in showing their
collection, though it be only chessmen, is amusing."</quote></note> But I think that if the geographers
<pb n="14" id="p.14">
and census-makers were to publish

population would probably fall on <placeName key="Boston">Boston</placeName>

<placeName key="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</placeName>
or most likely of all, <placeName key="Manhattan Island">Manhattan

Ives and other large <placeName key="New York">New York</placeName>
 collections,
is already ancient history; but aside from
these splendid examples, almost every intelligent acquaintance of mine and possibly of
yours has some hobby in this direction. We
can perhaps call to mind some people whose
otherwise unpleasant characteristics are in
part redeemed by their persistent alacrity
in collecting; -like that low-bred wretched
sharper in Stevenson's story "The Wrong
Box," toward whom our hearts grow perceptibly warmer as we follow his endeavors to
increase what he brags about as "the best
collection of Seal Rings in all London."
<name type="person" key="Ian Maclaren">Ian Maclaren</name>, in his kindly praise of our
country, grew pathetic when he said that if
any rare book came into the English market,
some precious example of the 'incunabula,'
some unique copy, some book resplendent
with the choicest binding and enriched with
a king's heraldry embossed in gold, it was
certain to be for no English purchaser, but
<pb n="15" id="p.15">
for some <placeName key="United States">United States</placeName>
 collector. <placeName key="New York">New York</placeName>
may not be the best mousing-place for the
Collector, but it is surely drawing into its
possession more of the Collector's treasures
than any other city of the world.
<p> Without further preface, let me address
myself to your general good sense, and begin
by clearing away some of the misconceptions
at which I have hinted.
<p> First: there is the sneer of the materialist
and utilitarian (they call themselves practical
men) that the only true collecting is the
collecting of that which is the real power of
the world and the solid basis of human life,
i.e. money. There are people everywhere to
whom the various hobbies and fancies which
imply or induce the Collector's art appear
not only worthless but injurious. They dissipate precious time. They absorb productive
energy. They weaken the fiber of business
pursuits. So such critics talk; and the serene
assurance with which they press the fable of
the Grasshopper and the Ant into their argument against the Collector causes Plutus to
rejoice that in their day his altars will never
lack a savory and sufficient sacrifice, and
Pluto to smile at the victims who are daily
<pb n="16" id="p.16">
drawing nearer to the outer darkness of his
realm. The Collector need not, however,
disparage these men to answer them. No
one knows better than he the real uses of
money; and enough unchastened human
nature is left in him sometimes to envy for
his own purposes the hoards whose steady
growth is their possessor's only joy. For
the Collector ought to be a man who is doing
a man's work in the world, outside this special
function, and doing it all the better for the
relief or intellectual excitement which his
hobby gives. In fact, some of the best
collectors in the world are business men,
who have found a corner in their lives for
the orderly accumulation of those things
which have come from some harvest-field of
nature or art. I have in mind such a man,
filling a high place in one of the great corporations of the business world, busy, useful,
rich; -and he collects little ancient, time-stained, flimsy scraps of literature bearing
on a subject which rules his leisure hours.
He is more proud of his case-full of these
treasures than of his bank account; and he
is right.
<pb n="17" id="p.17">
<p> Again: scientific men of a certain grade
are very fond of saying that a Collector is
never a Student. They look down on those
who gather and arrange, and complete in
series perhaps the very objects to which
they themselves give the most exhaustive
investigation, as men of an inferior capacity and aim. But I think that a Collector
can hardly fail to become a Student, unless
his collecting is the mere result of a vaccination for a fashionable craze or popular fancy,
and depends more on his loose purse-strings
than his personal application. "Original
research" is not the only thing in Science,
Art or Literature. At the lowest estimate
of his value, the Collector needs much
acquired knowledge to supply intelligently
the materials whose collocation furnishes
the high and severe scientist with food for
thought. And sometimes the Collector
thinks for himself with the most valuable
results. <name type="person" key="John Hunter">John Hunter</name> and <name type="person" key="Louis Agassiz">Louis Agassiz</name>
were indefatigable collectors; and let no
man, perhaps unworthy to loose the latchet
of their shoes, essay to pluck the laurels from
their heads.
<pb n="18" id="p.18">
<p> But time forbids me to linger in apologies.
The noble art of Collecting appeals to several
sentiments which no one will maintain to be
less than useful, not to say indispensable, to
the world.
<p> There is the principle of Order, for one.
The rows of shining coins, in sequence of
their dates-herbarium-sheets of flowers,
in the natural links of their chains of beauty
-pamphlets in their historical connection-prints marshalled by schools of engravers or
the technique of their execution-shells as
their spire or valves or lips direct their places
in the cabinet -prehistoric arrowheads pointing in the line of their development-all
these things suggest the presence and value
of "Heaven's First Law." Some men can
live in confusion, chance-medley and clutter.
Their thread of life is a snarl, and their destiny
chaos. Such men could never become true
Collectors; or, becoming such, the tangle of
their existence would grow clear. For a
collector must be orderly or be smothered
by his riches. Without order, he can never
know the extent and worth of his treasures
nor labor intelligently for their increase. Sir
Walter Scott has pictured his Antiquary
<pb n="19" id="p.19">
otherwise, and has given a vivid sketch of
the profusion and confusion of his books,
vases and rusty scraps of a by-gone age.
But, as you follow the story, you see that
everything was in order for him, if only the
"careless order" of <name type="person" key="Tennyson">Tennyson's</name> garden on
the down.
<p>Then again, there is the love and struggle
for Completeness.<note place="foot" n="*">An essay on "A Noble Art" (Bookbinding), in
The House Beautiful for <date value="1897-01">January, 1897</date>, speaks thus of
Collecting in that line:
<lb><quote lang="en">"Like a few other pursuits which seem to thrall men
with peculiar charms, it has the virtue of infinite possibilities. Perfection is unattainable. The field is limitless. He never can, nor does he really hope, to possess
the fully rounded and complete collection, but there is
always the glorious vista, and by " hitching his wagon
to a star," he has the range and movement of celestial
travel. He lies of nights and dreams of having on his
oaken shelves Grolier and Maioli, and sees himself the
object of the gloating eyes of the whole world of amateurs. He thinks of himself sometime in an indefinite
and beatific future, the proud possessor of the perfect
book, the crown of all the ages, with leaves of vellum,
blackest ink and richest rubrication, its covers gilt, with
cunning handiwork, and on its inner cover the significant "Ex Libris," that betokens it his own."</quote>
</note> <p> The collector always
has gaps to be filled, links to be supplied,
series to be finished; and as soon as one
<pb n="20" id="p.20">
work is done, another is begun, to be carried
to perfection. He always, when he looks
over his treasures and notes the vacant places
in their arrangement, feels that what he needs
is in existence somewhere, and he has been
born to find it. And if he is a true collector,
he does find it. It is in some out-of-the-way
corner in an old book-store, or in a garret, an
ash-heap, a paper-mill; perhaps masquerading
under a false face or in company where you
would least of all suspect it to be;- but the
collector who needs it is sure to discover it
at last. I heard of a collector of old English
household chests, who had searched long and
vainly for a peculiar type, which he believed
to have been among the domestic goods
brought to this country in that most famous
and capacious of all emigrant ships, the Mayflower. One day he detected it doing duty
as a hen-coop in a farm yard of a country
town in <placeName key="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</placeName>. Freed from feathers
and fertilizers, waxed and restored to its original beauty, it is now the pride of his heart
and the joy of his eyes.
<p> Two other examples rise to my mind, as I
am writing this, to exemplify the way in which
many things work together for the collector's
<pb n="21" id="p.21">
profit. Some years ago I picked up at Washington a vellum bound History of Italy, a
dumpy duodecimo, chiefly valuable for the
engraved heads of all the sovereigns from
<name type="person" key="Attila">Attila</name> down to 1500. I never saw a copy
before, and I have seen but one since.
Getting interested in books on London, I
exchanged, somewhat reluctantly, this History
for a coveted work in that line. I am a
frequenter of paper-mills, a snapper-up of
unconsidered trifles from the great bales of
old books and papers brought from over-sea
to be converted into clean American stationery; and on a visit to one of my mill-haunts,
the first book which tumbled out of a bale
there opened was a History of Italy in finer
condition than the one I had exchanged.
The other illustration is of more recent date.
One of my legal friends has long had it in
mind to purchase a certain standard law-book written by the chief English authority
on the subject which it discusses. But in his
many visits to the city, he has never seemed
to accomplish this; and probably he could
not tell why he has entered dozens of bookstores and left them with the purchase still
unmade. A few days ago, he saw a copy of

<pb n="22">this book lying on an old book-stall at a shop-door. To examine it was the work of a moment; to buy it required only a few seconds, for his quick eye detected that it was a presentation copy, charmingly bound, of a first edition, and that it had been sent from its eminent English author to the highest legal authority of the day in New England, whose autograph still attested his appreciation of the gift.
<p>Once more: the Collector learns the immense value which trifling things, almost useless as individuals, assume when studied in large, orderly and complete series. Nothing would seem more worthless than scraps of pottery, -not the perfect jugs and vases, but such potsherds as served Job in his cutaneous misery, or furnished the Hebrew prophets with effective symbols of contempt. Yet a collector of these from the rubbish heaps and the dust-bins of the world could assist in demonstrating a law which is just being worked out, the Evolution of Ornament, a remarkable example of Mr. Darwin's theory; while the investigation of their materials. firing and glazing might add another chapter to the keramic art. And Paleaographists
<pb n="23">are well aware that many ancient examples of writing are to be found on bits of crockery used exactly as scraps of paper are with us. In fact, many interesting and precious specimens in these vast series

<pb n="24" id="p.24">

all civilized men in the most perfect state of
security and order. And I know that a collection of the types of those buttons would
illustrate, better than most histories, the affairs
of fashion, civic and police establishments, the
importation of foreign fancies, the organization of railroads and the steps of the art of
design in America. A soul above buttons"
may not be the best thing, after all.
<p> Still again; until you become a collector,
you can never know in its full force the fact
of the richness and fullness of even the narrowest corner of creation in which you may
exercise your art. The microscope sees an
ocean in a drop and a world in a pinch of
dust; and the eye at the lens will grow old
before their marvels are exhausted. So, in
the most limited sphere, the Collector grows
into astonishment at its ever widening possibilities. The new is found to be old; all
published catalogues and manuals are seen
to be incomplete, and every collector must
be his own authority. Then too, he discovers
that what he had supposed to be made in a
few ways or on a few types, has, in reality,
in the ever active inventiveness of man,
received a kaleidoscopic complexity. The
<pb n="25" id="p.25">
most famous hammer-maker of this country,
an old Welshman, who died only a few years
ago, conceived the idea of a museum of
hammers, from the vine-handled stone of the
savage to the productions of his contemporaries and rivals; and many were the hammers,
rough and polished, clumsy and effective,
which he had to show. It was hard to
believe that so many forms, each representing somebody's idea of improvement on an
ancestral hammer, had been evolved from
the inner consciousness of the race. Try
once to collect anything, if only pins or
visiting-cards, and it will seem to you as if
the intellect of universal man had been employed to produce only the exact thing on
which you concentrate your attention.
<p> The fervor of the Collector not unfrequently reaches a height which deserves to
be called heroic. Twenty-one years ago, a
pleasant gossipy volume The Bric-a-Brac
Hunter was published by Major H. Byng
Hall, who spent most of his life in the service
of the English Crown as a "Silver Greyhound" or King's Messenger. His duties,
of course, carried him all over the world;
and in every country, all his leisure seems to
<pb n="26" id="p.26">
have been given to gathering in examples of
old pottery and porcelain. For the frontispiece of his book we have his own photograph
taken in his "den," an elegant apartment
overflowing with his treasures. He was a
descendant of Admiral Byng, and was especially proud of his pedigree, -not the least
reason being that his ancestor, like the more
famous Nelson, was an ardent and insatiable
Collector. He even repeats the story that
when Admiral Byng was at Majorca, an
officer rushed into his presence, crying out
that the French war-ships, with which a battle
was expected, were in the offing. Byng was
just then bargaining for a rare dish, and
answered: "Look here, this rare specimen is
worth all the French fleet -tell Captain
to prepare for action, and the French to wait
till I have secured it." And to show how
ecclesiastical, as well as naval circles are
invaded by an all-conquering passion, he
adds: "I have known a dignitary of the
Church, a man of high attainments, a Christian in all the attributes of life, to go home
from a sale with a bilious attack, because he
had failed to secure a group bearing the
monogram of Carl Theodore, for which
<pb n="27" id="p.27">
porcelain--and I fully sympathized with
him,-he had an intense liking."
<p> I draw from my memory a few examples,
out of hundreds which I might give, of the
whims and fancies of Collectors. The mother
of the present Czar of Russia collected perfume-bottles, and the last King of Portugal
left a shady library of books suppressed by
the Public Censor. Gladstone had a fancy
for enamels, especially on snuff-boxes; and his
treasures were exhibited at South Kensington
some years ago. A letter has just been published in fac-simile by Bernard Quaritch,
which Gladstone wrote September 9, 1896,
regarding the rare books which he had drawn
into his library. Sarah Bernhardt collects
men's head-wear or hats, from the Spanish
sombrero to the Indian's crown of feathers;
and also women's belts, in which she has the
foundation of a fortune in the gold and gems
which decorate many of them. Lady Malet
has a cabinet of 1ooo pairs of shoes; and
she can illustrate the gamut of foot-wear
from dancing-slippers to snow-shoes. A New
York lady possesses a similar and rival collection. George Godwin of London has a
house-full of historic chairs; and the visitor
<pb n="28" id="p.28">
can sit in them, where Anne Boleyn, Raleigh,
Napoleon I, Thackeray, Bulwer, Byron, and
many of the famous of all ages have rested
before. Nothing is too gruesome for some
collectors. One Mr. Urquhart has a large
and fine assortment of halters which have
interrupted the breath of many criminals;
and Lawrence Hutton collects death-masks,
-a pleasant adornment for the library or
dining-room of a realistic age.
<p>Looking at the great world of Collectors,
we see that they may be divided into several
classes, according to the means which they
employ in the accumulation of their treasures.
There is, especially at the great centers of
human life, one sort of Collectors, privileged
by fortune to be the aristocracy of the craft.
For them are Raphaels and Correggios,
Caxtons and first folios of Shakespeare,
engraved gems, cut crystal and jade, classical
marbles and mediaeval manuscripts. They
are the gods and sit above the thunder.
Sometimes they are benefactors, opening
their collections to the public eye, or letting
them flow at last into the great reservoirs of
museums or libraries. Sometimes they are
merely the selfish purchasers of the best
<pb n="29" id="p.29">
things in the world, and their collections are
their coffins.
<p>At the other end of the scale, are the collectors who by stealthy and secretive ways,
keen eyes, a natural gift of dissimulation and
an inexplicable favoritism of fortune, get all
things without money and without price.
Such was Snuffy Davie of Jonathan Oldbuck's tradition; such are the men who discover prizes in the book-boxes of the Paris
Quais or the dirty rubbish of the Seven Dials.
They are as inimitable to the ordinary collector as the millionaires who gratify their
fancies without stint or hindrance. Common
mortals can neither descend to these depths
nor climb successfully to those heights.
<p>But by far the largest class of collectors is
of those who combine a reasonable expenditure with sagacity, careful study and much
personal exertion; and it must be said that
as the more of the last element enters into
the combination, the better it is for their
collections and themselves. The best artist
still mixes his colors with brains. A collection
ought to take a personal character from its
owner, and the details of its richness and
order should be the details of his own life.
<pb n="30" id="p.30">
Several years ago, I visited the library of old
Sam. Pepys, the gossip and diarist of the
Restoration. It is at Magdalene College,
Cambridge, enshrined in its own Bibliotheca
Pepysiana, as the inscription on the building
reads. Pepys was a genuine collector,-of
books, manuscripts, ballads, broadsides, mezzotint portraits and London views. You
may still read the man in the selection and
arrangement of the whole; for it all remains
as he left it, 193 years ago. The official
order and formalism, the love of beauty, the
strange hankering after the vulgar, which, as
otherwise we know from Pepys himself, since
he wore his heart upon his sleeve, were the
great collector's characteristics, appear in
every department, even page of his collection.
He mounted every ballad and print with his
own hands, he drew around them the red
and black lines, he wrote the index in each
sumptuous scrap-book. How lovingly he
must have lingered over the pretty face of
Lady Castlemaine, the purchase of which
engraving he notes in his Diary, comparing
her with the graceful La Belle Stewart, her
rival in Pepys' admiration. His three thousand books are in the old cases, drawn up in
<pb n="31" id="p.31">
dress-parade; for Pepys made the size and
bindings of the volumes contribute to the
fine appearance of the shelves.
<p>So there have been collectors to whom
London, their home, was the world: and
they reappear in their collections, sometimes
gigantic, always characteristic, relating to
their greater self. The Guildhall, the Soane
and British Museums have absorbed and still
preserve much of this work. A collection
illustrating Pennant's book on London, which
I have studied in the British Museum, was
made by an antiquarian named Crowle at a
cost of thirty-five thousand dollars. The
same national institution has obtained a similar collection, exhibited at South Kensington
in 1880, and which was accumulated by a
man who, during a long life was a hard-working official of the city, and who, little by little,
gathered an almost incredible number of
maps, plans, drawings and views of the
metropolis. Its price is a secret, but must
have much exceeded Crowle's. The largest
collection of this kind to-day in private hands
is said to be the property of a lamp-seller in
the Strand.
<pb n="32" id="p.32">
<p>The most famous objects of collection,
and among the noblest too, are books. In
every country and language, still, books.
And I do not here speak merely of their
collection as the working materials of a literary life, but of books collected as books.
Innumerable are the whims and lines and
varieties among book-collectors; and very
cordial is the scorn with which these specialists in print and paper sometimes regard their
neighbors of a different type. You must read
the many pleasant volumes written now-a-days about books, to learn the names and
hobbies of these men. There are "Caxton
men, and tall-copy men, and first edition men,
and Russia leather and Levant morocco men."
There are those who affect black-letter, or 16th
century vignettes, or books from the Aldine
or Elzevir presses. There are others who
never touch a folio, and others still who would
not collect the choicest duodecimo to save it
from the paper-mill. Some give their lives
and libraries to editions of Shakespeare,
Dante, Boccaccio. Bindings or book-plates
give their value to volumes in the eyes of
certain collectors; and one distinct variety
of the tribe collects books which bear the
<pb n="33" id="p.33">
autographs of distinguished or notorious
people.<note n="*" place="foot">"There is a book in the British Museum, which
would have to many people a greater value than any
other single volume in the world; it is a copy of
Florio's translation of Montaigue, and it bears Shakespeare's autograph on a fly-leaf."-Hamilton W. Mabie's
Books and Culture.
</note> There are also collectors who are
anatomists of books; and as the Biologist
bottles up the livers and lungs and eyes and
hearts of animals, so they collect initials, title
pages, tail-pieces, printers' marks, vignettes.
Some are eager for Bewick's wood-cuts, others
for Cruickshank's etchings. As of making
books, so of book-collectors there is no end;
and, as even book-collectors must die, great
deposits of literary rarities are continually
thrown into the general circulation of the
world; while the catalogue-maker flourishes,
and the voice of the auctioneer is heard in
the land.
<p>The Collector's work in connection with
books takes still another and most interesting
form. For more than a hundred years there
have been bookish men who have sought to
make collections to illustrate some particular
book or favorite author. For this purpose,
<pb n="34" id="p.34">
engravings, views, maps, portraits, autograhps
are drawn from every source,-sometimes
by the ruin of other costly volumes-and
then bound with the work or kept by themselves as a carefully collated and growing
collection. Extra-illustrated books, as they
are called, made for a market, sometimes
deftly, sometimes clumsily, can be had in the
shops of all great cities. Your essayist confesses to a mild but chronic form of this
collector's mania; but he has to say that it
is perhaps the method of collecting which
requires most judgment and common sense.
It is a sin to spoil a good and perfect book
to enrich another; and the extravagant and
foolish way in which this is sometimes done
deserves condemnation. A common book,
thus 'extended,' as the phrase sometimes
runs, commands not unfrequently an enormous price. A Chicago lawyer owns a copy
of Longfellow's Dante which cost him $1000
in its extended shape,- a Philadelphia book-collector paid, a while ago, $1200 for three
volumes of Grammont's Memoirs, - the failure of a New York broker threw into the
market in 1885 an extra-illustrated Shakespeare on which he had expended $22,000. An
<pb n="35" id="p.35">
elegant volume published some years since on
this branch of book-collecting, and giving a
list of the treasures of this kind in New York
and vicinity, would astonish you by the revelations which it makes of the zeal and
extravagance of metropolitan collectors.<note n="*" place="foot">A Monograph on Privately-Illustrated Books. A

<p> As I have said, Americans have earned
abroad the reputation of being the most
miscellaneous and money-scattering of all
collectors; and already much lamentation is
heard in England and on the Continent at
the irreplaceable treasures of art and literature which the new wealth of the United
States is drawing to itself. When we are as
old as our foreign cousins are to-day, we shall
no doubt have done as great things in book-collecting; -in some respects we have perhaps reached their level now-but I have
never heard of an extended book in American
hands like the copy of Clarendon and Burnet
made by Mr. Sutherland of London at an
expense of $60,000, and now in the Bodleian
Library at Oxford. Mr. Rees, who mentions
<pb n="36" id="p.36">
it in his charming Diversions of a Book-Worm,
says: " It is in 67 large volumes, (the original
could not have exceeded 6 or 8) and contains
19,000 prints and drawings. There are 731
portraits of Charles I, 518 of Charles II, 352
of Cromwell, 273 of James II and 420 of
William III. Forty years were spent in its
compilation." After this, you will not be
surprised to learn, on the same authority, of
the foreign ecclesiastic who has got together
12,000 portraits of the Virgin Mary, and of
the daring collector, who so confidently counts
on repeating the vital persistence of Methuselah that he has chosen Rees' Cyclopaedia
as a work for extra-illustration!
<p> And this leads me to say what may best
perhaps be put in the form of a digression
here, that however high may be the pulse of
the collector's zeal, there are many circles in
which he must walk circumspectly and moderate to others' eyes the fever which he feels.
For collecting, like sovereignty, has its unscrupulous ambitions. If Russia longs for
Bulgaria or Turkey, who would leave her
alone with the unguarded object of her desire ?
She is likely to steal it anyway, even before
the face of all Europe. So the collector,
<pb n="37" id="p.37">
literary, artistic, scientific, is held by his
brother collectors, by librarians, by the dealers
in whose clientage he is to be found, as not
unfrequently long-armed and light-fingered.
No army forager ever appropriated a pig or
chicken in a more serenely unprincipled way
than will some collectors slyly convey to the
gaps of their own cabinets the possessions of
other men. The enmity toward France which
Innocent X. manifested during his pontificate
was ascribed to his having been detected and
punished, when only a priest, for the attempt
to steal a desirable volume from a Frenchman's collection. I visited, several years ago,
the finest private collection in Great Britain
of English gold and silver coins. The glittering store was exhibited freely and without
reserve, - drawer after drawer was taken from
the cabinets and passed under review. I
noticed what at last I ventured to speak
about, that every place for a coin in every
drawer was occupied. "Yes," said the owner,
"I keep them all full, and then I can see if
any coin is missing when I put them back."<note place="foot" n="*">See also Grant Allen's story, The Gold Wulfric.</note>
Sam. Pepys' collection which I have described,
<pb n="38" id="p.38">
can only be seen by the visitor in the company
of a Fellow of Magdalene College; because
it is held on the singular tenure that if the
least object, if only a ballad or a leaf from a
book comes to be missing, it all passes at
once to another college of the University,
which again can only keep it from reverting to
Magdalene, so long as it is rigidly preserved
from loss. When I inspected the collection,
I turned from the index to a particular portrait which I wished to see. Its place was
vacant! I looked significantly at the gentleman who was escort and guard. He answered
with a laugh, " Yes, it's gone ! - Stolen! but
luckily before we got it."<note n="*" place="foot">The essay, A Noble Art, already alluded to in a
note, exaggerates, it is to be hoped, the kleptomaniac
tendencies of the Book Collector, when it says of him;
<lb>"He is altogether conscienceless, and would use the
most questionable of methods to obtain his sinister
ends. For one must know that 'all is fair in love and
war and book-collecting,' provided only that he gains
the end in view. Many a man of tried and serious virtue would barter soul and country, if only there were
proper recompense in shape of incunabula or monk-made missal."</note>
<p>All this is preliminary to the remark that
of all thievish book-collectors the meanest
<pb n="39" id="p.39">
are those who steal for book-illustration.
Every librarian will show you precious books
robbed of title-page, abridged of prints or
maps, or possibly lacking some special leaf
of text; and these bits, the want of which
does so much to destroy the value of the
whole, are inserted in some rascal's extra-illustrated History or Biography. A wet
string, a keen knife, a sharpened finger-nail
are the implements of this robbery; and the
Judas-like deed is done under cover of consulting the volume which is left plundered
and impoverished. How great in general is
the temptation which sometimes ends in
such baseness, only a collector understands.
Andrew Lang in his Ballade of the Unattainable, after apostrophizing "The books I cannot hope to buy, The books that never can
be mine," ends his rhymes thus plaintively;
<lb>"Prince, hear a hopeless Bard's appeal;
<lb>" Reverse the rules of Mine and Thine;
<lb>"Make it legitimate to steal
<lb>" The books that never can be mine! "
<p>To return for a moment to the subject of
collecting, let me repeat that here especially
a shadow always seems to rest on whatever
does not show the collector incorporated
<pb n="40" id="p.40">
with his work. All that merely represents
the power of the purchaser's purse and the
toil of hirelings cannot escape the suspicion
of vulgarity. It is therefore especially pleasant to remember one collection to which have
been given the labor and love of many years,
and which is, I believe, unique. Some of you
may have seen it, but no public description
of it has, to my knowledge, ever been given.
<p> A gentleman of French descent, a fine
linguist and artist, bred in an atmosphere of
books, was, all his life, a student and admirer
of the old chronicler Froissart. He gathered
a valuable library of editions of this author,
his commentators and the literary illustrations
of his works. His own copy of Froissart was
extended to more than a dozen times its
original size by everything of portrait, print,
map or autograph which could supply pictorial
or verbal elucidation of the text. Separate
title-pages were illuminated in the highest
style of the art, and, from prolonged study,
made correct in every detail of color, ornament or costume, to correspond with the
exact chronology of their places in the book.
All this was the work of the possessor's own
hand. Such a collection was not sealed from
<pb n="41" id="p.41">
increase by binding, but kept in drawers, each
chapter by itself, and under a crystal tablet
of plate-glass.
<p>Let me turn away, however, from the
Collector's field in human history, art and
literature,--for, grand as these things are,
they have their limits,-to the boundless
spaces and uncounted forms of Nature. Let
me, as introduction, venture on a quotation
from an essay by an old Autograph-Hunter.
He says:
<lb>"My attention was once called to a boy
<lb>"just able to walk, and scarcely old enough
<lb>"to talk who possessed (to use an oft-heard
<lb>"phrase) 'a perfect mania for collecting.'
<lb>"He would watch closely every attempt made
<lb>"to light a lamp or a cigar, and would eagerly
<lb>"search for the match that was thrown aside.
<lb>"Such as he found, he carefully hoarded
<lb>"and arranged. In his infantile mind there
<lb>"seemed to be some idea of classification.
<lb>"Some of the burnt matches in his possession
<lb>"were 'rare specimens,' as was shown by the
<lb>"care with which he guarded them. Others
<lb>"were more common and not so highly prized.
<lb>"By his actions he showed that there was in
<lb>"his mind an ideal burnt match - a very rare
<pb n="42" id="p.42">
<lb>"specimen, toward the attainment of which
<lb>"he was continually striving.
<lb>"My close observation of this boy confirmed me in the opinion that the passion
<lb>"for collecting was inherent in man. The
<lb>"case above referred to was the earliest manifestation ever brought to my attention."
<p>I believe this last statement too; and I
think that our science of education shows its
own infantile condition that it does not yet
insist upon what should be one of its foundation principles that every boy and girl should
be trained as a collector. See how the collector's instinct reveals itself so extensively
in the passion for postage stamps and coins,
and think what this might become if directed
toward the infinite multitude of wonderful
creations, surely waiting, if there can be any
expression of desire and hope in nature, for
the collector's touch and study! How many
of us were told in childhood of the numbers
and beauty of the tiny shells under the forest
leaves, or taught to gather and compare and
arrange in order the tender and delicate
mosses and ferns? How many were intelligently trained to discriminate the sea-weeds
and the Spring flowers? How many learned
<pb n="43" id="p.43">
of fungi good or bad, of minerals or crystals
or birds or trees or leaves or seeds? True,
we made some studies on the fishes on holiday afternoons, and some small collections,
not scientific, with the aid of a hook and
worm. And we did collect birds' eggs, though
we should not have followed that pursuit with
half the zest, if we had not been solemnly
assured that it was a sin! Our education
was neglected, even if we did learn to wear
good clothes, and dance, and flirt, and play
billiards and read Greek; and we have suffered all our life, though we may not know it,
on account of that neglect. Douglass Jerrold, in his Chronicles of Clovernook, has a
clever scheme of compensation and regeneration reported by the old hermit as in force
in the wonderful kingdom of dreams which
he had visited. Every one who had been
violent or selfish or proud or covetous in this
world became an infant there; and on his
meekly accepting the situation and conduct ing himself as a good child in his nurse's
arms, depended his growth and re-establish ment in man's estate. It would not be
altogether out of place, could we command
the conditions to send hard and worldly souls
<pb n="44" id="p.44">
to such a regenerating acquaintance, juvenile
and scientific, with nature; where those whose
acquaintance with zoology was limited to
bulls and bears could come to know something more of the animal creation, and the
selfish dames of fashion should be forced to
study, as children, the flowers they have only
known in counterfeit upon their hats!
<p>The literature of Collecting would form a
large and interesting library, in which almost
every hobby would have its practical manuals,
its eulogies, and even its poetry. It would
include two American essays of widely differing style and fame. Mark Twain's paper on
Collecting is perhaps his most irreverent
production, lacerating with its shameless wit
those tender sensibilities of the human heart
by which, as I have tried to show you to-night
the Collector is allied to the noblest of his
race. Hawthorne's wonderful chapter on
A Virtuoso's Collection exhibits indeed an
unattainable ideal, but blends a lofty inspiration with the charms of the great master'
style. Following this on a lower level, a
charming English writer has sketched a collection of books such as might, but never will
be made;-books which have the tenderest
<pb n="45" id="p.45">
or most tragic associations with the great
souls of earth; like the prayer-book which
Mary Queen of Scots carried in her hand to
the scaffold at Fotheringay, and the crumpled
volume which was taken from Shelley's
pocket when his body lay stiff and cold on
the Italian shore.<note place="foot" n="*">The Pleasures of a Book- Worm, by J. Rogers Rees,
[New York, Geo. J. Coombes, 1886], p. 47 to p. 81.</note>
<p>But I must take a text from the Roll-Call
of Faith in the Epistle to the Hebrews. For
the time would fail me to tell of the collectors
of pottery and porcelain, lacquers and enamels, curios and bronzes, miniatures and rings,
snuff-boxes and fans, lace and paper, Venice
glass and Continental currency, Apostle
spoons and Egyptian scarabaei, coins and
medals, walking-sticks and prehistoric implements, eggs and sea-weeds, microscopic preparations and meteorites, minerals and cameos,
carved ivories and missals. I could fairly
exhaust the substantives of the dictionary
before my catalogue was at an end. Of one
and all of these fields for the collector, it may
be said that there is in them much intellectual
profit and more pleasure; and one must be
<pb n="46" id="p.46">
an indifferent collector indeed, if he does not
find out, even in the apprenticeship to his
calling, how Columbus felt when he discovered a new world.
<p>I have, however, to set up one finger-post
of warning, before I close. The fact-shall
I call it Law or Original Sin?-of Supply
and Demand operates here. The Collector
is a known and recognized element in the
commercial as in the intellectual world. And
so the subtle art of fraudulent men lies in
wait for him at every turn. Birmingham
makes Egyptian gods in blue glaze and
scarabaei by the thousand for him. The
potter of the nineteenth century simulates
the ware of the fifteenth and sixteenth-cracks it, crazes it, begrimes it, to sell it to
him as a genuine antique. In garrets all over
Europe, hungry canvas-daubers are painting
Rembrandts and Claudes to hang upon his
walls. The silver and gold vessels of the
middle ages and the cameos of the Augustan
period are counterfeited in his behalf. Alexander and the Caesars never minted so many
coins as spring, with the ancient images and
superscriptions, from the worshops of modern
Italy. You may well refuse to buy a mummy
<pb n="47" id="p.47">
without its pedigree, or a sphinx without the
autograph guarantee of Pharaoh. The white
man can make wampum better than his red
forerunner, and chip flint implements into
the exact lines of the prehistoric stone. The
furniture dealers of London and Paris can
work miracles, multiplying an ancient carved
chair or chest or footstool into a hundred,
each fit to deceive the medieval elect. And
but lately the ingenious Dusseldorfers have
shamelessly patented a process for the imitation of old books, -dying with aniline, aging
and moulding the paper, firing the edges-a
process so atrociously successful as to cast
suspicion on the Book of Time itself!<note place="foot" n="*">Those who are planning a trip to Europe will do
well to read, and those who have already journeyed in
foreign lands will preserve their peace of mind, if they
do not read, two articles:
1. Spurious Works of Art by J. C. Robinson in
Nineteenth Century for November, 1891, and
2. Fashions and Counterfeits in Bric-a-Brac, by
Sarah Cooper Hewitt, in the Cosmopolitan Magazine
of June, 1892.</note>
<p>If I have spoken to any ripe collectors and
adepts here to-night, I can foresee the immediate result of my words. They will go home,
unlock some precious repository, and gloat a
<pb n="48" id="p.48">
little over its hoarded treasures before they
go to bed, with the reflection to soothe and
cheer them, how weakly the essayist has
praised their craft, and how much better he
would have written had he known what they
know about Collecting. But for the rest,
whose powers are yet untried, may I have
turned some steps and thoughts toward our
noble art! Dear friends, begin to collect,
and collecting, persevere! Be honest, but
assiduous; and be ready to face what is
sometimes worse than the fagots or axe, the
jeers of an unregenerate, uncollecting world!
Collect; -even if your foes are of your own
household; although the wife of your bosom
calls your acquisitions 'rubbish,' and your
daughters spurn them with their dainty slippered feet, and the Celtic Princess in the
kitchen shows her aristocratic instincts by
consigning them, with the shattered idols of
your china-closet, to the ash-barrel;-persevere, although the cyclone of "house-cleaning" rage, and all the winds of Eolus roar
against them; and, for your cheer, I will tell
you what a poet, antiquarian and collector
has sung of one department of our work.
<pb n="49" id="p.49">
<lb>"The days decay as flower of grass,
<lb>The years as silent waters flow;
<lb>All things that are, depart, alas I
<lb> As leaves the winnowing breezes strow;
<lb>And still, while yet, full-orbed and slow,
<lb> New suns the old horizon climb,
<lb>Old Time must reap, as others sow;
<lb> We are the gleaners after Time
<lb>"We garner all the things that pass,
<lb> We harbor all the winds may blow;
<lb> As misers, we upstore, amass
<lb> All gifts the hurrying fates bestow;
<lb> Old chronicles of feast and show,
<lb> Old waifs of bygone rune and rhyme,
<lb> Old jests that made old banquets glow;
<lb> We are the gleaners after Time !
<lb>"We hoard old love of lad and lass,
<lb> Old flowers that in old gardens grow,
<lb> Old records writ in tomb and brass,
<lb> Old spoils of arrow-head and bow,
<lb> Old wrecks of old worlds' overthrow,
<lb> Old relics of Earth's primal slime,
<lb> All drift that wanders to and fro;
<lb> We are the gleaners after Time! "
<pb n="52" id="p.52">
<div1 type="part" n="2"><head>"Collegisee Juvat"</head><head type="sub"> A Few Remarks by a Collector's Wife"</>
<pb n="53" id="p.53">
<p>It is undoubtedly delightful to be an enthusiast in the noble art which the essayist
has praised. But it presents a different aspect
to the members of his own family. Too often
the dust (not Olympian) falls to the care of
his wife; and of that there is always enough
to collect-for removal. It is not true that
she is a natural foe to collecting, for she looks
with unqualified pleasure on the collections
of her friends and neighbors, deriving great
comfort from the multitude of their afflictions.
Her own enthusiasm is very properly modified
by the nature of the objects collected;-
whether large or small, antique gems or musty
pamphlets, ormolu clocks or high-flavored
pipes--and somewhat also by the dimensions of her house. Then it makes a difference to her whether the craze takes a mild
<pb n="54" id="p.54">
form, such as that to which the essayist confesses, or whether his "field is the world,"
and the disease is chronic and the taste is
omnivorous. The essayist quotes the old
saying, "A man's foes are those of his own
household." Allow a word in palliation of
this domestic offence; and consider, as
another side to the picture, when he says
" You have never begun to live till you have
begun to collect," how, under these home
conditions, "the other half lives."
<p>Judge also if in your opinion, the hope of
immortality would be brighter to the dear
ones of the family, if they had the confident
assurance of an endless extension of the
Collector's art. I have no doubt that the
destitution of the family of Palissy the potter
who sacrificed everything to his ambition,
and even threw the last piece of his furniture
into the kiln for firing his beloved clay, finds
some parallel in the home of the Collector
of the present day. They who must live
with the Collector deserve our sympathy if
they are not in haste to take up their cross
in cheerful faith, and look with unclouded
satisfaction at the irony of fate which leaves
a family to starve while posterity exalts the
<pb n="55" id="p.55">
Collector to fame. We hear that Stow, the
London antiquary of Elizabeth's day, spent
all his life and substance on his researches,
only to become at last the "King's bedesman" and to die in poverty. His family, if
he had one, must have found little comfort
in musing over the many details of city
annals and the numberless quaint epitaphs
which he accumulated. To them a little
contemporaneous "taffy" would have been
more acceptable than this wealth of ancient
"epi-taphy."
<p>The Collector's family may be very depraved in taste to prefer bonnets or bicycles,
fine linen or china, house decorations or
furniture, to the treasures of the junk-shop
or the paper-mill. But early in their united
life they learn that their desires must be held
in check, and that the self-denial of woman
is not a virtue of a bygone age. If the house
be small, they must be contented with the
least possible space for themselves and their
belongings, to make room for these expanding and delightful "collections." May they
not be pardoned if they do not always welcome
with an unforced smile the little surprises of
boxes and bundles of rarities creeping into
<pb n="56" id="p.56">
the house with Mephistophelian subtlety, and
demanding new cabinets and shelves in the
overcrowded rooms? No objection must be
made to giving the new-comers the place of
honor, upstairs, downstairs, or even in my
lady's chamber. Is there anything more
expressive of child-like trust and innocence
than the Collector's faith in space! He is
never chilled in his enthusiasm by the size of
his abode. If he lives in a cabin, he collects
for a palace. And like Artemus Ward in the
Civil War he is zealous and patriotic enough
to sacrifice to his principles his wife and all
her relatives! If a Collector's family is so
heartless as to be unsympathetic to his
absorbing craze, let the members of it accept
the fact, first, last, and all the time, that they
have no rights of domestic occupation which
he is bound to respect!
<p>Again, the essayist has referred to the
beautiful Law of Order which his art inspires
and obeys. You must bear in mind that this
only applies to the show collection. What of
the vast store of material in the attic, the
cellar, the closets and every available corner,
awaiting the owner's leisure and attention.
"Ah! mum," said my own Bridget once,
<pb n="57" id="p.57">
"this house is jist crawlin' with books and
things, and I don't know what to do wid 'em!
Cudden't some of these trashes be burnt
up?" What wife, though in her heart she
agreed with Bridget, would ever dare, while
divorce laws exist, to propose such a house-cleaning? She has no difficulty in believing
that "the intellect of universal man has been
devoted to the manufacture of the exact thing
in question." How these " books and things "
multiply, with a fecundity only symbolized
by the reptilian collections of Egypt, in
Pharaoh's day!
Moreover, after long experience and blasted
hopes, the Collector's family may be pardoned
if at last it loses faith in the mercantile value
of these wonderful accumulations. But then,
a true collector is never mercenary or utilitarian. He works for an art, not for a profit,
which might tempt his wife and daughters
into extravagance. No one knows better
than he the value of money--to buy more
of his darling "treasures." Fortunes may
have been made in postage-stamps and autographs and rare books, and Lord Timothy
Dexter did become rich by sending warming-pans to the tropics. Is there any such golden
<pb n="58" id="p.58">
goal for the average collector? Woman's
feeble brain cannot understand how there
can be, since she is told that articles of such
great value are invariably picked up "almost
for a song." According to her husband's
own claim, he is a more successful patron of
the bargain-counter than she is herself. Such
treasures for a trifle put Moses and the green
spectacles to the blush. As the spider for
the fly, so does the wary dealer lie in wait
for the innocent victims of the collecting
craze. He is so fortunate in finding something unique in their line, so interested to
complete their special set of specimens at so
slight a cost! And the deluded man believes
that the world will esteem these things as
highly as he does, and pay its own hardly-
earned money to obtain them! Sir Isaac
Newton Gale, whom visitors to <placeName key="Bethlehem, New Hampshire">Bethlehem,
N. H.</placeName>, will remember for his unique collection
of broken bottles and tin cans, was always
fond of discoursing on the enormous sums
which had been offered for it, and which he
had refused. The noble admiral at Majorca,
who thought his specimen worth the whole
French fleet, is not exceptional in his color-blindness to values. As a speck before the
<pb n="59" id="p.59">
eye may obscure the sun, so does the concentration of the Collector's mind on his
peculiar hobby destroy his view of every
other thing. We may not refuse to commiserate the clergyman who had the bilious
attack because he did not secure his prize;
but shall we forget the nervous prostration
and heart failure which would probably have
come upon his family if he had succeeded ?
<p>There is nothing more to say of the ethical
relations of Collecting, since the essayist has
confessed its inevitable tendency to kleptomania. The wife of one whose honesty has
never been questioned, will not soon forget
the base suspicion cast upon her in London,
when she was examining the old Herbarium
of Linnaeus, kept at Burlington House. The
Curator had gone out of the room for a
moment, leaving her alone with her husband
and the sacred plants. It was with a high
moral tone that the good man exhorted her
not to yield to a passion which he knew she
felt, and refrain from stealing a specimen as
a relic!
<p>But Collecting is even worse than immoral
-it is untidy! Who ever knew a Collector
who did not war to the death against a dustbrush
<pb n="60" id="p.60">
or a broom ? In his eyes the dust of
ages is to be preferred to the decent work of
house-cleaning; while moths and book-worms
are the associates which he cultivates in practice, if not in principle.
<p>One advantage of Collecting, which the
essayist has forgotten to mention, may receive
a word of allusion. This is the convenience
of moving collections, when one changes
place of residence or when a fire breaks out
in the immediate neighborhood. This, with
other particulars which have been mentioned,
determine the conditions on which only the
true non-utilitarian Collector should be
allowed to exist. He must be a bachelor
with a large and certain income, and must
occupy an elastic and permanent abode.
Then, with an unbounded faith in Providence, a Methuselah life, and the fire department always on call, he may attain success.
Otherwise let any would-be Collector and his
impedimenta be consigned to their appropriate place -the nearest museum.
<p>After a long experience with Collector's
hobbies (not my own) I can truly say, that if
the disease cannot be entirely cured, the
department of Microscopy seems to me the
<pb n="61" id="p.61">
best, on account of the minuteness of its
objects, into which its ravages can be turned.
Or an accumulation of rare gold and silver
coins may be allowed, if a sound Savings
Bank be adopted as a cabinet in which to
deposit them.
<p> While you stand in admiration at the
energy, enthusiasm, self-sacrifice and persistence which Collecting inspires, do not fail
to give a passing thought to the many great
and varied virtues which it has encouraged
in A Collector's Wife.
P.S.- A woman must have a postscript.
This is mine: "DON'T!"
