Pepys mentions the Exchequer money being removed to Nonesuch, and describes the park and house as they then appeared. The building was subsequently pulled down, and its contents dispersed. A modern structure has been raised on its site.</note>
whither the office of the Exchequer was transferred during the plague, at my good friend's Mr. Packer's, and took an exact view of the plaster statues and bass-relievos inserted betwixt the timbers and puncheons of the outside walls of the Court; which must needs have been the work of some celebrated Italian. I much admired how they had lasted so well and entire since the time of Henry VIII., exposed as they are to the air; and pity it is they are not taken out and preserved in some dry place; a gallery would become them. There are some mezzo-relievos as big as the life; the story is of the Heathen Gods, emblems, compartments, &amp;c. The palace consists of <num value="2">two</num> courts, of which the <num value="1">first</num> is of stone, castle like, by the Lord Lumleys (of whom it was purchased), the other of timber, a Gothic fabric, but these walls incomparably beautified. I observed that the appearing timber-puncheons, entrelices, &amp;c., were all so covered with scales of slate, that it seemed carved in the wood and painted, the slate fastened on the timber in pretty figures, <pb id="p.2" n="2"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
that has, like a coat of armour, preserved it from rotting. There stand in the garden <num value="2">two</num> handsome stone pyramids, and the avenue planted with rows of fair elms, but the rest of these goodly trees, both of this and of Worcester Park adjoining, were felled by those destructive and avaricious rebels in the late war, which defaced <num value="1">one</num> of the stateliest seats his Majesty had. 
<p><num value="12">12</num><hi rend=italics>th January.</hi> After much, and indeed extraordinary mirth and cheer, all my brothers, our wives, and children, being together, and after much sorrow and trouble during this contagion, which separated our families as well as others, I returned to my house, but my wife went back to Wotton. I not as yet willing to adventure her, the contagion, though exceedingly abated, not as yet wholly extinguished amongst us. 
<p><num value="29">29</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> I went to wait on his Majesty, now returned from Oxford to Hampton-Court, where the Duke of Albemarle presented me to him; he ran towards me, and in a most gracious manner gave me his hand to kiss, with many thanks for my care and faithfulness in his service in a time of such great danger, when every body fled their employments; he told me he was much obliged to me, and said he was several times concerned for me, and the peril I underwent, and did receive my service most acceptably (though in truth I did but do my duty, and O that I had performed it as I ought!) After this, his Majesty was pleased to talk with me alone, near an hour, of several particulars of my employment, and ordered me to attend him again on the Thursday following at Whitehall. Then the Duke came towards me, and embraced me with much kindness, telling me if he had thought my danger would have been so great, he would not have suffered his Majesty to employ me in that station. Then came to salute me my Lord of St. Albans, Lord Arlington, Sir William Coventry, and several great persons; after which, I got home, not being very well in health. 
<p>The Court was now in deep mourning for the French Queen-Mother. 
<p><num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>nd February.</hi> To London; his Majesty now come to Whitehall, where I heard and saw my Lord Mayor (and brethren) make his speech of welcome, and the <num value="2">two</num> Sheriffs were knighted. <pb id="p.3" n="3"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>.</note>

<p><num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>th February.</hi><hi rend=sup><num value="4">4</num></hi> My wife and family returned to me from the country, where they had been since August, by reason of the contagion, now almost universally ceasing. Blessed be God for His infinite mercy in preserving us! I, having gone through so much danger, and lost so many of my poor officers, escaping still myself that I might live to recount and magnify His goodness to me. 
<p><num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> I had another gracious reception by his Majesty, who called me into his bed-chamber, to lay before and describe to him my project of an Infirmary, which I read to him, who, with great approbation, recommended it to his Royal Highness. 
<p><num value="20">20</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> To the Commissioners of the Navy who, having seen the project of the Infirmary, encouraged the work, and were very earnest it should be set about immediately; but I saw no money, though a very moderate expense would have saved thousands to his Majesty, and been much more commodious for the cure and quartering of our sick and wounded, than the dispersing them into private houses, where many more chirurgeons and attendants were necessary, and the people tempted to debauchery. 
<p><num value="21">21</num><hi rend=italics>st.</hi> Went to my Lord Treasurer for an assignment of <num value="40000">40,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> upon the <num value="2">two</num> last quarters for support of the next year's charge. Next day, to Duke of Albemarle and Secretary of State, to desire them to propose it to the Council. 
<p><num value="1">1</num><hi rend=italics>st March.</hi> To London, and presented his Majesty my book intituled, &ldquo;The pernicious Consequences of the new Heresy of the Jesuits against Kings and States.&rdquo;<note><hi rend=italics>Ante</hi>, vol. i. p. <num value="410">410</num>.</note>

<p><num value="7">7</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Dr. Sancroft, since Archbishop of Canterbury, preached before the King about the identity and immutability of God, on Psalm cii. <num value="27">27</num>. 
<p><num value="13">13</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> To Chatham, to view a place designed for an Infirmary. 
<p><num value="15">15</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> My charge now amounted to near <num value="7000">7000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> [weekly]. 
<p><num value="22">22</num><hi rend=italics>nd.</hi> The Royal Society re-assembled, after the dispersion from the contagion. 
<p><num value="24">24</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Sent <num value="2000">2000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> to Chatham. 
<p><num value="1">1</num><hi rend=italics>st April.</hi> To London, to consult about ordering the natural rarities belonging to the repository of the Royal Society; referred to a Committee. <pb id="p.4" n="4"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>

<p><num value="10">10</num><hi rend=italics>th April.</hi> Visited Sir William D&lsquo;Oyly,<note><p><num value="1">One</num> of the Commissioners for the Sick and Wounded. Pepys records a wager which Sir William laid with him, of &ldquo;a poll of ling, a brace of carps, and a pottle of wine, and Sir W. Pen, and Mr. Scowen to be at the eating of them.&rdquo;</note> surprised with a fit of apoplexy, and in extreme danger. 
<p><num value="11">11</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Dr. Bathurst preached before the King, from &ldquo;I say unto you all, watch&rdquo;&mdash;a seasonable and most excellent discourse. When his Majesty came from chapel, he called to me in the lobby, and told me he must now have me sworn for a Justice of Peace (having long since made me of the Commission); which I declined as inconsistent with the other service I was engaged in, and humbly desired to be excused. After dinner, waiting on him, I gave him the <num value="1">first</num> notice of the Spaniards referring the umpirage of the peace betwixt them and Portugal to the French King, which came to me in a letter from France before the Secretaries of State had any news of it. After this, his Majesty again asked me if I had found out any able person about our parts that might supply my place of Justice of Peace (the office in the world I had most industriously avoided, in regard of the perpetual trouble thereof in these numerous parishes); on which I nominated <num value="1">one</num>, whom the King commanded me to give immediate notice of to my Lord Chancellor, and I should be excused; for which I rendered his Majesty many thanks.&mdash;From thence, I went to the Royal Society, where I was chosen by <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> voices to be <num value="1">one</num> of their Council for the ensuing year; but, upon my earnest suit in respect of my other affairs, I got to be excused&mdash;and so home. 
<p><num value="15">15</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Our parish was now more infected with the plague than ever, and so was all the country about, though almost quite ceased at London. 
<p><num value="24">24</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> To London about our Mint-Commission, and sat in the inner Court of Wards. 
<p><num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>th May.</hi> To Queenborough, where finding the Richmond frigate, I sailed to the buoy of the Nore to my Lord-General and Prince Rupert, where was the Rendezvous of the most glorious fleet in the world, now preparing to meet the Hollander.&mdash;Went to visit my cousin, Hales, at a sweetlywatered place at Chilston, near Bockton. The next morning, <pb id="p.5" n="5"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>.</note>
to Leeds Castle, once a famous hold, now hired by me of my Lord Culpeper for a prison. Here I flowed the dry moat, made a new drawbridge, brought spring water into the court of the Castle to an old fountain, and took order for the repairs. 
<p><num value="22">22</num><hi rend=italics>nd May.</hi> Waited on my Lord Chancellor at his new palace; and Lord Berkeley's<note><p>John, created Baron Berkeley, of Stratton, in <datestruct value="1658--"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>. He was Lord- Lieutenant of Ireland in <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>, and Ambassador to France in <datestruct value="1674--"><year reg="1674">1674</year></datestruct>. He died in <datestruct value="1678--"><year reg="1678">1678</year></datestruct>. His new house, next to the Lord Chancellor's, was wellknown as Berkeley House&mdash;the neighbourhood of Piccadilly being the then favourite locality for what Evelyn styles &ldquo;new palaces.&rdquo;</note> built next to it. 
<p><num value="24">24</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Dined with Lord Cornbury, now made Lord Chamberlain to the Queen; who kept a very honourable table. 
<p><num value="1">1</num><hi rend=italics>st June.</hi> Being in my garden at <num value="6">six</num> o'clock in the evening, and hearing the great guns go thick off, I took horse and rode that night to Rochester; thence, next day towards the Downs and sea-coast, but meeting the Lieutenant of the Hampshire frigate, who told me what passed, or rather what had not passed, I returned to London, there being no noise, or appearance, at Deal, or on that coast of any engagement. Recounting this to his Majesty, whom I found at St. James's Park, impatiently expecting, and knowing that Prince Rupert was loose about <num value="3">three</num> at St. Helen's Point at N. of the Isle of Wight, it greatly rejoiced him; but he was astonished when I assured him they heard nothing of the guns in the Downs, nor did the Lieutenant who landed there by <num value="5">five</num> that morning. 
<p><num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>rd.</hi> Whit-Sunday. After sermon came news that the Duke of Albemarle was still in fight, and had been all Saturday, and that Captain Harman's ship (the Henry) was like to be burnt. Then a letter from Mr. Bertie that Prince Rupert was come up with his squadron (according to my former advice of his being loose and in the way), and put new courage into our fleet, now in a manner yielding ground; so that now we were chasing the chasers; that the Duke of Albemarle was slightly wounded, and the rest still in great danger. So, having been much wearied with my journey, I slipped home, the guns still roaring very fiercely. <pb id="p.6" n="6"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>

<p><num value="5">5</num><hi rend=italics>th June.</hi> I went this morning to London, where came several particulars of the fight. 
<p><num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Came Sir Daniel Harvey from the General, and related the dreadful encounter, on which his Majesty commanded me to despatch an extraordinary physician and more chirurgeons. It was on the solemn Fast-day when the news came; his Majesty being in the chapel made a sudden stop to hear the relation, which being with much advantage on our side, his Majesty commanded that public thanks should immediately be given as for a victory. The Dean of the chapel going down to give notice of it to the other Dean officiating; and notice was likewise sent to St. Paul's and Westminster-Abbey. But this was no sooner over, than news came that our loss was very great both in ships and men; that the Prince frigate was burnt, and as noble a vessel of <num value="90">90</num> brass guns lost; and the taking of Sir George Ayscue, and exceeding shattering of both fleets; so as both being obstinate, both parted rather for want of ammunition and tackle than courage; our General retreating like a lion; which exceedingly abated of our former joy. There was, however, orders given for bonfires and bells; but, God knows, it was rather a deliverance than a triumph. So much it pleased God to humble our late over-confidence that nothing could withstand the Duke of Albemarle, who, in good truth, made too forward a reckoning of his success now, because he had once beaten the Dutch in another quarrel; and being ambitious to outdo the Earl of Sandwich, whom he had prejudicated as deficient in courage. 
<p><num value="7">7</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> I sent more chirurgeons, linen, medicaments, &amp;c., to the several ports in my district. 
<p><num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Dined with me Sir Alexander Fraser, prime physician to his Majesty; afterwards, went on board his Majesty's pleasure-boat, when I saw the London frigate launched, a most stately ship, built by the City to supply that which was burnt by accident some time since; the King, Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, being there with great banquet. 
<p><num value="11">11</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Trinity Monday, after a sermon, applied to the remeeting of the Corporation of the Trinity-House, after the late raging and wasting pestilence: I dined with them in their new room in Deptford, the <num value="1">first</num> time since it was rebuilt. <pb id="p.7" n="7"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>.</note>

<p><num value="15">15</num><hi rend=italics>th June.</hi> I went to Chatham.&mdash;<num value="16">16</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> In the Jemmy yacht (an incomparable sailer) to sea, arrived by noon at the fleet at the Buoy at the Nore, dined with Prince Rupert and the General. 
<p><num value="17">17</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Came his Majesty, the Duke, and many Noblemen. After Council, we went to prayers. My business being despatched, I returned to Chatham, having lain but <num value="1">one</num> night in the Royal Charles; we had a tempestuous sea. I went on shore at Sheerness, where they were building an arsenal for the fleet, and designing a royal fort with a receptacle for great ships to ride at anchor; but here I beheld the sad spectacle, more than half that gallant bulwark of the kingdom miserably shattered, hardly a vessel entire, but appearing rather so many wrecks and hulls, so cruelly had the Dutch mangled us. The loss of the Prince, that gallant vessel, had been a loss to be universally deplored, none knowing for what reason we <num value="1">first</num> engaged in this ungrateful war; we lost besides <num value="9">nine</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> more, and near <num value="600">600</num> men slain and <datestruct value="1100--"><year reg="1100">1100</year></datestruct> wounded, <num value="2000">2000</num> prisoners; to balance which, perhaps we might destroy eighteen or <num value="20">twenty</num> of the enemy's ships, and <num value="700">700</num> or <num value="800">800</num> poor men. 
<p><num value="18">18</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Weary of this sad sight, I returned home. 
<p><num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>nd July.</hi> Came Sir John Duncomb<note><p>&ldquo;Duncomb was a judicious man, but very haughty, and apt to raise enemies against himself. He was an able Parliament-man, but could not go into all the designs of the Court; for he had a sense of religion, and a zeal for the liberty of his country.&rdquo;&mdash;Bishop Burnet's <hi rend=italics>Hist. of his own Times.</hi></note> and Mr. Thomas Chicheley,<note><p>Afterwards knighted. Pepys mentions him as <num value="1">one</num> of the Masters of the Ordnance. He was also, as Evelyn tells us, a Member of the Privy Council.</note> both Privy Councillors and Commissioners of His Majesty's Ordnance, to visit me, and let me know that his Majesty had in Council, nominated me to be <num value="1">one</num> of the Commissioners for regulating the farming and making of saltpetre through the whole kingdom, and that we were to sit in the Tower the next day. When they were gone, came to see me Sir John Cotton, heir to the famous antiquary, Sir Robert Cotton: a pretended great Grecian, but had by no means the parts, or genius of his grandfather. 
<p><num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>rd.</hi> I went to sit with the Commissioners at the Tower, where our commission being read, we made some progress <pb id="p.8" n="8"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
in business, our Secretary being Sir George Wharton, that famous mathematician who wrote the yearly Almanack during his Majesty's troubles. Thence, to Painters' Hall, to our other commission, and dined at my Lord Mayor's. 
<p><num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>th July.</hi> The solemn Fast-day. Dr. Meggot preached an excellent discourse before the King on the terrors of God's judgments. After sermon, I waited on my Lord Archbishop of Canterbury and Bishop of Winchester, where the Dean of Westminster spoke to me about putting into my hands the disposal of <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> pounds</measure>, which the charitable people of Oxford had sent to be distributed among the sick and wounded seamen since the battle. Hence, I went to the Lord Chancellor's to joy him of his Royal Highness's <num value="2">second</num> son, now born at St. James's; and to desire the use of the Star-chamber for our Commissioners to meet in, Painters' Hall not being so convenient. 
<p><num value="12">12</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> We sat the <num value="1">first</num> time in the Star-chamber. There was now added to our commission Sir George Downing<note><p>Secretary to the Treasury, and Commissioner of the Customs. He had been recently made a baronet, and was now a zealous courtier; though, during the Commonwealth, as Cromwell's Resident in Holland, he had been no less zealous a republican. He subsequently went to Holland as Ambassador from the King. To him belongs the credit of having engaged Pepys about the year <datestruct value="1659"><year reg="1659">1659</year></datestruct>, as <num value="1">one</num> of the clerks in a department of the Exchequer then under his management. For his character, of which Evelyn speaks as we see, and Pepys leaves a somewhat doubtful impression, see Lord Clarendon's <hi rend=italics>Life.</hi></note>
(<num value="1">one</num> that had been a great . . . against his Majesty, but now insinuated into his favour; and, from a pedagogue and fanatic preacher, not worth a groat, had become excessively rich), to inspect the hospitals and treat about prisons. 
<p><num value="14">14</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Sat at the Tower with Sir J. Duncomb and Lord Berkeley, to sign deputations for undertakers to furnish their proportions of saltpetre. 
<p><num value="17">17</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> To London, to prepare for the next engagement of the fleets, now gotten to sea again. 
<p><num value="22">22</num><hi rend=italics>nd.</hi> Our parish still infected with the contagion. 
<p><num value="25">25</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> The fleets engaged. I dined at Lord Berkeley's, at St. James's, where dined my Lady Harrietta Hyde, Lord Arlington, and Sir John Duncomb. 
<p><num value="29">29</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> The pestilence now fresh increasing in our parish, I forbore going to church. In the afternoon came tidings <pb id="p.9" n="9"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>.</note>
of our victory over the Dutch, sinking some, and driving others aground, and into their ports. 
<p><num value="1">1</num><hi rend=italics>st August.</hi> I went to Dr. Keffler, who married the daughter of the famous chymist, Drebbell,<note><p>Cornelius Van Drebbell, born at Alkmaar, in Holland, in <datestruct value="1572--"><year reg="1572">1572</year></datestruct>; but in the reign of Charles I. settled in London, where he died in <datestruct value="1634--"><year reg="1634">1634</year></datestruct>. He was famous for other discoveries in science besides that mentioned by Evelyn&mdash;the most important of which was the thermometer. He also made improvements in microscopes and telescopes; and though, like many of his scientific contemporaries, something of an empiric, possessed a considerable knowledge of chemistry and of different branches of natural philosophy.</note> inventor of the bodied scarlet. I went to see his iron ovens, made portable (formerly) for the Prince of Orange's army: supped at the Rhenish Wine-House with divers Scots gentlemen. 
<p><num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Dined with Mr. Povey, and then went with him to see a country house he had bought near Brentford;<note><p>This country house, situated near Hounslow, was called the Priory. There were <num value="3">three</num> brothers of this name; sons of Justinian Povey, Auditor-General to Queen Anne of Denmark. The <num value="1">one</num> mentioned by Evelyn was Thomas Povey, a Member of Parliament, Treasurer to the Commissioners for the affairs of Tangier, and Surveyor-General of the Victualling Department, in which offices he was succeeded by Pepys. He had previously held office under Cromwell, and was Treasurer and Receiver-General of the rents and revenues of the Duke of York. Pepys of course mentions him frequently.</note> returning by Kensington; which house stands to a very graceful avenue of trees, but it is an ordinary building, especially <num value="1">one</num> part. 
<p><num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Dined at Sir Stephen Fox's<note><p><num value="1">One</num> of the most celebrated statesmen of the period comprised in the Diary. He was knighted in <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>, made Clerk of the Green Cloth, and Paymaster of the Forces by Charles II. He lost the favour of his successor by opposing the bill for a standing army, but was again employed in the reign of Queen Anne. Evelyn gives an interesting account of him at p. <num value="156">156</num> of this volume. He was father of the <num value="1">first</num> Earl of 
<*>chester, and of the <num value="1">first</num> Baron Holland. He projected Chelsea College&mdash;the honour of which has generally been attributed to Nell Gwynne. He also founded a new church and a set of alms-houses at his seat, Farley, in Wilts. He was born in <datestruct value="1627--"><year reg="1627">1627</year></datestruct>, and died in <datestruct value="1716--"><year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct>.</note> with several friends and, on the <num value="10">10th</num>, with Mr. Odart, Secretary of the Latin tongue. 
<p><num value="17">17</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Dined with the Lord Chancellor, whom I intreated to visit the Hospital of the Savoy, and reduce it (after the great abuse that had been continued) to its original institution for the benefit of the poor, which he promised to do. 
<p><num value="25">25</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Waited on Sir William D&lsquo;Oyly, now recovered, as <pb id="p.10" n="10"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
it were, miraculously. In the afternoon, visited the Savoy Hospital, where I stayed to see the miserably dismembered and wounded men dressed, and gave some necessary orders. Then to my Lord Chancellor, who had, with the Bishop of London and others in the commission, chosen me <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="3">three</num> surveyors of the repairs of Paul's, and to consider of a model for the new building, or, if it might be, repairing of the steeple, which was most decayed. 
<p><num value="26">26</num><hi rend=italics>th August.</hi> The contagion still continuing, we had the Church-service at home. 
<p><num value="27">27</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> I went to St. Paul's church, where, with Dr. Wren, Mr. Pratt, Mr. May, Mr. Thomas Chicheley, Mr. Slingsby,<note><p>He held the office of Master of the Mint. Other members of the family were employed about the Court. Arthur, son of Sir Guildford, was knighted, and subsequently made a baronet; and Sir Robert Slingsby was Comptroller of the Navy&mdash;a man much respected by Pepys.</note>
the Bishop of London, the Dean of St. Paul's,<note><p>Dr. Sancroft, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury.</note> and several expert workmen, we went about to survey the general decays of that ancient and venerable church, and to set down in writing the particulars of what was fit to be done, with the charge thereof, giving our opinion from article to article. Finding the main building to recede outwards, it was the opinion of Chicheley and Mr. Pratt that it had been so built

When we came to the steeple, it was deliberated whether it were not well enough to repair it only on its old foundation, with reservation to the <num value="4">four</num> pillars; this Mr. Chicheley and Mr. Pratt were also for, but we totally rejected it, and persisted that it required a new foundation, not only in regard of the necessity, but for that the shape of what stood was very mean, and we had a mind to build it with a noble cupola, a form of church-building not as yet known in England, but of wonderful grace. For this purpose, we offered to bring in a plan and estimate, which, after much contest, was at last assented to, and that we should nominate a committee of able workmen to examine the present foundation. This concluded, we drew all up in writing, and so went with my Lord Bishop to the Dean's. <pb id="p.11" n="11">

<p><num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>nd September.</hi> This fatal night, about <num value="10">ten</num>, began the deplorable fire, near Fish-street, in London. 
<p><num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>rd.</hi> I had public prayers at home. The fire continuing, after dinner, I took coach with my wife and son, and went to the Bankside in Southwark, where we beheld that dismal spectacle, the whole city in dreadful flames near the waterside; all the houses from the Bridge, all Thames-street, and upwards towards Cheapside, down to the <num value="3">Three</num> Cranes, were now consumed; and so returned, exceeding astonished what would become of the rest. 
<p>The fire having continued all this night (if I may call that night which was light as day for <num value="10">ten</num> miles round about, after a dreadful manner), when conspiring with a fierce eastern wind in a very dry season, I went on foot to the same place; and saw the whole south part of the City burning from Cheapside to the Thames, and all along Cornhill (for it likewise kindled back against the wind as well as forward), Tower-street, Fenchurch-street, Gracious-street,<note><p>Now Gracechurch-street.</note> and so along to Baynard's Castle, and was now taking hold of St. Paul's church, to which the scaffolds contributed exceedingly. The conflagration was so universal, and the people so astonished, that, from the beginning, I know not by what despondency, or fate, they hardly stirred to quench it; so that there was nothing heard, or seen, but crying out and lamentation, running about like distracted creatures, without at all attempting to save even their goods; such a strange consternation there was upon them, so as it burned <pb id="p.12" n="12"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
both in breadth and length, the churches, public halls, Exchange, hospitals, monuments, and ornaments; leaping after a prodigious manner, from house to house, and street to street, at great distances <num value="1">one</num> from the other. For the heat, with a long set of fair and warm weather, had even ignited the air, and prepared the materials to conceive the fire, which devoured, after an incredible manner, houses, furniture, and every thing. Here, we saw the Thames covered with goods floating, all the barges and boats laden with what some had time and courage to save, as, on the other side, the carts, &amp;c., carrying out to the fields, which for many miles were strewed with moveables of all sorts, and tents erecting to shelter both people and what goods they could get away. Oh, the miserable and calamitous spectacle! such as haply the world had not seen since the foundation of it, nor can be outdone till the universal conflagration thereof. All the sky was of a fiery aspect, like the top of a burning oven, and the light seen above <num value="40">forty</num> miles round--about for many nights. God grant mine eyes may never behold the like, who now saw above <num value="10000">10,000</num> houses all in <num value="1">one</num> flame! The noise and cracking and thunder of the impetuous flames, the shrieking of women and children, the hurry of people, the fall of towers, houses, and churches, was like a hideous storm; and the air all about so hot and inflamed, that at the last <num value="1">one</num> was not able to approach it, so that they were forced to stand still, and let the flames burn on, which they did, for near <num value="2">two</num> miles in length and <num value="1">one</num> in breadth. The clouds also of smoke were dismal, and reached, upon computation, near <num value="50">fifty</num> miles in length. Thus, I left it this afternoon burning, a resemblance of Sodom, or the last day. It forcibly called to my mind that passage&mdash;<hi rend=italics>non enim hic habemus stabilem civitatem:</hi> the ruins resembling the picture of Troy. London was, but is no more! Thus, I returned. 
<p><num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>th September.</hi> The burning still rages, and it is now gotten as far as the Inner Temple. All Fleet-street, the Old Bailey, Ludgate-hill, Warwick-lane, Newgate, Paul's-chain, Watling-street, now flaming, and most of it reduced to ashes; the stones of Paul's flew like grenados, the melting lead running down the streets in a stream, and the very pavements glowing with fiery redness, so as no horse, nor man, was able to tread on them, and the demolition had <pb id="p.13" n="13"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>.</note>
stopped all the passages, so that no help could be applied. The eastern wind still more impetuously driving the flames forward. Nothing but the Almighty power of God was able to stop them; for vain was the help of man. 
<p><num value="5">5</num><hi rend=italics>th September.</hi> It crossed towards Whitehall; but oh! the confusion there was then at that Court! It pleased his Majesty to command me, among the rest, to look after the quenching of Fetter-lane end, to preserve (if possible) that part of Holborn, whilst the rest of the gentlemen took their several posts, some at <num value="1">one</num> part, and some at another (for now they began to bestir themselves, and not till now, who hitherto had stood as men intoxicated, with their hands across), and began to consider that nothing was likely to put a stop but the blowing up of so many houses as might make a wider gap than any had yet been made by the ordinary method of pulling them down with engines. This some stout seamen proposed early enough to have saved near the whole City, but this some tenacious and avaricious men, aldermen, &amp;c., would not permit, because their houses must have been of the <num value="1">first</num>. It was, therefore, now commended to be practised; and my concern being particularly for the Hospital of St. Bartholomew, near Smithfield, where I had many wounded and sick men, made me the more diligent to promote it; nor was my care for the Savoy less. It now pleased God, by abating the wind, and by the industry of the people, when almost all was lost infusing a new spirit into them, that the fury of it began sensibly to abate about noon, so as it came no farther than the Temple westward, nor than the entrance of Smithfield, north: but continued all this day and night so impetuous towards Cripplegate and the Tower, as made us all despair. It also brake out again in the Temple; but the courage of the multitude persisting, and many houses being blown up, such gaps and desolations were soon made, as, with the former <num value="3">three</num> days' consumption, the back fire did not so vehemently urge upon the rest as formerly. There was yet no standing near the burning and glowing ruins by near a furlong's space. 
<p>The coal and wood-wharfs, and magazines of oil, rosin, &amp;c., did infinite mischief, so as the invective which a little before I had dedicated to his Majesty and published,<note><p>The 
<hi rend=italics>Fumifugium.</hi> See <hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, i. <num value="374">374</num>.</note> giving warn- <pb id="p.14" n="14"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
ing what probably might be the issue of suffering those shops to be in the City was looked upon as a prophecy. 
<p>The poor inhabitants were dispersed about St. George's Fields, and Moorfields, as far as Highgate, and several miles in circle, some under tents, some under miserable huts and hovels, many without a rag, or any necessary utensils, bed or board, who from delicateness, riches, and easy accommodations in stately and well-furnished houses, were now reduced to extremest misery and powerty. 
<p>In this calamitous condition, I returned with a sad heart to my house, blessing and adoring the distinguishing mercy of God to me and mine, who, in the midst of all this ruin, was like Lot, in my little Zoar, safe and sound. 
<p><num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>th September.</hi> Thursday. I represented to his Majesty the case of the French prisoners at war in my custody, and besought him that there might be still the same care of watching at all places contiguous to unseized houses. It is not indeed imaginable how extraordinary the vigilance and activity of the King and the Duke was, even labouring in person, and being present to command, order, reward, or encourage workmen; by which he showed his affection to his people, and gained theirs. Having, then, disposed of some under cure at the Savoy, I returned to Whitehall, where I dined at Mr. Offley's,<note><p>Dr. Offley was rector of Abinger, and has left traces of himself as donor of farms to Okewood Chapel, at Wotton, in the patronage of the Evelyn family.</note> the groom-porter, who was my relation. 
<p><num value="7">7</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> I went this morning on foot from Whitehall as far as London Bridge, through the late Fleet-street, Ludgate-hill by St. Paul's, Cheapside, Exchange, Bishopsgate, Aldersgate, and out to Moorfields, thence through Cornhill, &amp;c., with extraordinary difficulty, clambering over heaps of yet smoking rubbish, and frequently mistaking where I was: the ground under my feet so hot, that it even burnt the soles of my shoes. In the meantime, his Majesty got to the Tower by water, to demolish the houses about the graff, which, being built entirely about it, had they taken fire and attacked the White Tower, where the magazine of powder lay, would undoubtedly not only have beaten down and destroyed all the bridge, but sunk and torn the vessels <pb id="p.15" n="15"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>.</note>
in the river, and rendered the demolition beyond all expression for several miles about the country. 
<p>At my return, I was infinitely concerned to find that goodly Church, St. Paul's&mdash;now a sad ruin, and that beautiful portico (for structure comparable to any in Europe, as not long before repaired by the late King) now rent in pieces, flakes of large stones split asunder, and nothing remaining entire but the inscription in the architrave, showing by whom it was built, which had not <num value="1">one</num> letter of it defaced! It was astonishing to see what immense stones the heat had in a manner calcined, so that all the ornaments, columns, friezes, capitals, and projectures of massy Portland stone, flew off, even to the very roof, where a sheet of lead covering a great space (no less than <num value="6">six</num> acres by measure) was totally melted. The ruins of the vaulted roof falling, broke into St. Faith's, which being filled with the magazines of books belonging to the Stationers, and carried thither for safety, they were all consumed, burning for a week following. It is also observable that the lead over the altar at the east end was untouched, and among the divers monuments the body of <num value="1">one</num> bishop remained entire. Thus lay in ashes that most venerable church, <num value="1">one</num> of the most ancient pieces of early piety in the Christian world, besides near <num value="100">one hundred</num> more. The lead, iron-work, bells, plate, &amp;c., melted, the exquisitely wrought Mercers' Chapel, the sumptuous Exchange, the august fabric of Christ Church, all the rest of the Compamies' Halls, splendid buildings, arches, entries, all in dust; the fountains dried up and ruined, whilst the very waters remained boiling; the voragos of subterranean cellars, wells, and dungeons, formerly warehouses, still burning in stench and dark clouds of smoke; so that in <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> miles traversing about I did not see <num value="1">one</num> load of timber unconsumed, nor many stones but what were calcined white as snow. 
<p>The people, who now walked about the ruins, appeared like men in some dismal desert, or rather, in some great city laid waste by a cruel enemy; to which was added the stench that came from some poor creatures' bodies, beds, and other combustible goods. Sir Thomas Gresham's statue, though fallen from its niche in the Royal Exchange, remained entire, when all those of the Kings since the Con- <pb id="p.16" n="16"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
quest were broken to pieces. Also the standard in Cornhill, and Queen Elizabeth's effigies, with some arms on Ludgate, continued with but little detriment, whilst the vast iron chains of the City-streets, hinges, bars, and gates of prisons, were many of them melted and reduced to cinders by the vehement heat. Nor was I yet able to pass through any of the narrow streets, but kept the widest; the ground and air, smoke and fiery vapour, continued so intense, that my hair was almost singed, and my feet unsufferably surbated. The bye-lanes and narrow streets were quite filled up with rubbish; nor could <num value="1">one</num> have possibly known where he was, but by the ruins of some Church, or Hall, that had some remarkable tower, or pinnacle remaining. 
<p>I then went towards Islington and Highgate, where <num value="1">one</num> might have seen <num value="200000">200,000</num> people of all ranks and degrees dispersed, and lying along by their heaps of what they could save from the fire, deploring their loss; and, though ready to perish for hunger and destitution, yet not asking <num value="1">one</num> penny for relief, which to me appeared a stranger sight than any I had yet beheld. His Majesty and Council indeed took all imaginable care for their relief, by proclamation for the country to come in, and refresh them with provisions. 
<p>In the midst of all this calamity and confusion, there was, I know not how, an alarm begun that the French and Dutch, with whom we were now in hostility, were not only landed, but even entering the City. There was, in truth, some days before, great suspicion of those <num value="2">two</num> nations joining; and now that they had been the occasion of firing the town. This report did so terrify, that on a sudden there was such an uproar and tumult that they run from their goods, and, taking what weapons they could come at, they could not be stopped from falling on some of those nations whom they casually met, without sense or reason. The clamour and peril grew so excessive, that it made the whole Court amazed, and they did with infinite pains and great difficulty, reduce and appease the people, sending troops of soldiers and guards, to cause them to retire into the fields again, where they were watched all this night. I left them pretty quiet, and came home sufficiently weary and broken. Their spirits thus a little calmed, and the affright abated, they now began <pb id="p.17" n="17"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>.</note>
to repair into the suburbs about the City, where such as had friends, or opportunity, got shelter for the present; to which his Majesty's proclamation also invited them.<note><p>Subjoined is the Ordinance to which Evelyn alludes, reprinted from the original half-sheet in black letter: 
<p>CHARLES R. 
<p>His Majesty, in his princely compassion and very tender care, taking into consideration the distressed condition of many of his good subjects, whom the late dreadful and dismal fire hath made destitute of habitations, and exposed to many exigencies and necessities; for present remedy and redress whereof, his Majesty intending to give further testimony and evidences of his grace and favour towards them, as occasion shall arise, hath thought fit to declare and publish his Royal pleasure: That, as great proportions of bread, and all other provisions as can possibly be furnished, shall be daily and constantly brought, not only to the markets formerly in use, but also to such markets as by his Majesty's late order and declaration to the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs of London and Middlesex have been appointed and ordained, <hi rend=italics>viz.</hi>, Clerkenwell, Islington, Finsbury-fields, Mile-end Green, and Ratcliff; his Majesty being sensible that this will be for the benefit also of the towns and places adjoining, as being the best expedient to prevent the resort of such persons thereunto as may pilfer and disturb them. And whereas, also, divers of the said distressed persons have saved and preserved their goods, which nevertheless they know not how to dispose of, it is his Majesty's pleasure, that all Churches, Chapels, Schools, and other like public places, shall be free and open to receive the said goods, when they shall be brought to be there laid. And all Justices of the Peace within the several Counties of Middlesex, Essex and Surrey, are to see the same to be done accordingly. And likewise that all cities and towns whatsoever shall, without any contradiction, receive the said distressed persons, and permit them to the free exercise of their manual trades; his majesty resolving and promising that, when the present exigence shall be passed over, he will take such care and order, that the said persons shall be no burthen to their towns, or parishes And it is his Majesty's pleasure, that this his declaration be forthwith published, not only by the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex, but also by all other Sheriffs, Mayors, and other chief officers in their respective precincts and limits, and by the constables in every parish. And of this his Majesty's pleasure all persons concerned are to take notice, and thereunto to give due obedience to the utmost of their power, as they will answer the contrary at their peril.

They examined each particular, and discoursed on them for near an hour, seeming to be extremely pleased with what I had so early thought on. The Queen was now in her cavalier riding-habit, hat and feather, and horseman's coat, going to take the air.

This made me resolve to go to our parish assembly, where our Doctor <pb id="p.19" n="19">

It being the <num value="1">first</num> time his Majesty put himself solemnly into the Eastern fashion of vest, changing doublet, stiff collar, bands and cloak, into a comely dress, after the Persian mode, with girdles or straps, and shoestrings and garters into buckles, of which some were set with precious stones,<note><p>This costume was shortly after abandoned, and laid aside; nor does any existing portrait exhibit the King so accoutred.</note> resolving never to alter it, and to leave the French mode, which had hitherto obtained to our great expense and reproach. Upon which, divers courtiers and gentlemen gave his Majesty gold by way of wager that he would not persist in this resolution. I had sometime before presented an invective against that unconstancy, and our so much affecting the French fashion, to his Majesty; in which I took occasion to describe the comeliness and usefulness of the Persian clothing, in the very same manner his Majesty now clad himself. This pamphlet I entitled <hi rend=italics>Tyrannus, or the Mode</hi>, and gave it to the King to read. I do not impute to this discourse the change which soon happened, but it was an identity that I could not but take notice of.

<p><num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>nd December.</hi> Dined with me Monsieur Kiviet, a Dutch gentleman-pensioner of Rotterdam, who came over for protection, being of the Prince of Orange's party, now not welcome in Holland. The King knighted him for some merit in the Prince's behalf. He should, if caught, have been beheaded with Monsieur Buat, and was brotherin- law to Van Tromp, the sea-general.

<p><num value="22">22</num><hi rend=italics>nd.</hi> Saw the sumptuous supper in the banquetinghouse at Whitehall, on the eve of St. George's day, where were all the companions of the Order of the Garter. 
<p><num value="23">23</num><hi rend=italics>rd.</hi> In the morning, his Majesty went to chapel with the Knights of the Garter, all in their habits and robes, ushered by the heralds; after the <num value="1">first</num> service, they went in procession, the youngest <num value="1">first</num>, the Sovereign last, with the Prelate of the Order and Dean, who had about his neck the <pb id="p.25" n="25">

But before the Prelate and Dean of Windsor went the gentlemen of the chapel and choristers, singing as they marched; behind them <num value="2">two</num> doctors of music in damask robes; this procession was about the courts at Whitehall. Then, returning to their stalls and seats in the chapel, placed under each knight's coat-armour and titles, the <num value="2">second</num> service began. Then, the King offered at the altar, an anthem was sung; then, the rest of the Knights offered, and lastly proceeded to the banqueting-house to a great feast. The King sat on an elevated throne at the upper end at a table alone; the Knights at a table on the right hand, reaching all the length of the room; over-against them a cupboard of rich gilded plate; at the lower end, the music; on the balusters above, wind music, trumpets, and kettle-drums. The King was served by the lords and pensioners who brought up the dishes. About the middle of the dinner, the Knights drank the King's health, then the King, theirs, when the trumpets and music played and sounded, the guns going off at the Tower. At the Banquet, came in the Queen, and stood by the King's left hand, but did not sit. Then was the banqueting-stuff flung about the room profusely. In truth, the crowd was so great, that though I stayed all the supper the day before, I now stayed no longer than this sport began, for fear of disorder. The cheer was extraordinary, each Knight having <num value="40">forty</num> dishes to his mess, piled up <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> high; the room hung with the richest tapestry.

<p><num value="1">1</num><hi rend=italics>st June.</hi> I went to Greenwich, where his Majesty was trying divers grenadoes shot out of cannon at the Castlehill, from the house in the Park; they brake not till they hit the mark, the forged ones brake not at all, but the cast ones very well. The inventor was a German there present. At the same time, a ring was showed to the King, pretended to be a projection of mercury, and malleable, and said by the gentlemen to be fixed by the juice of a plant. 
<p><num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> To London, alarmed by the Dutch, who were fallen on our fleet at Chatham, by a most audacious enterprise entering the very river with part of their fleet, doing us <pb id="p.27" n="27">

not only disgrace, but incredible mischief in burning several of our best men-of-war lying at anchor and moored there, and all this through our unaccountable negligence in not setting out our fleet in due time. This alarm caused me, fearing the enemy might venture up the Thames even to London (which they might have done with ease, and fired all the vessels in the River, too), to send away my best goods, plate, &amp;c., from my house to another place. The alarm was so great that it put both Country and City into fear, a panic, and consternation, such as I hope I shall never see more; everybody was flying, none knew why or whither. Now, there were land-forces despatched with the Duke of Albemarle, Lord Middleton,<note><p>John Middleton was <num value="1">first</num> a Parliamentary general, but subsequently fought for Charles II. at Worcester, and otherwise distinguished himself as a Royalist officer till the Restoration, when he was created Earl of Middleton.

<p><num value="14">14</num><hi rend=italics>th June.</hi> I went to see the work at Woolwich, a battery to prevent them coming up to London, which Prince Rupert commanded, and sunk some ships in the river. 
<p><num value="17">17</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> This night, about <num value="2">two</num> o'clock, some chips and combustible matter prepared for some fire-ships, taking flame in Deptford-yard, made such a blaze, and caused such an uproar in the Tower (it being given out that the Dutch fleet was come up, and had landed their men and fired the Tower), as had liked to have done more mischief before people would be persuaded to the contrary and believe the accident. Everybody went to their arms. These were sad and troublesome times.

be any peat, or turf, found fit for use. The next day, I went and discovered enough, and made my report that there might be found a great deal; but nothing further was done in it. 
<p><num value="28">28</num><hi rend=italics>th June.</hi> I went to Chatham, and thence to view not only what mischief the Dutch had done; but how triumphantly their whole fleet lay within the very mouth of the Thames, all from the North Fore-land, Margate, even to the buoy of the Nore&mdash;a dreadful spectacle as ever Englishmen saw, and a dishonour never to be wiped off!

The Parliament had accused him, and he had enemies at Court, especially the buffoons and ladies of pleasure, because he thwarted some of them, and stood in their way; I could name some of the chief. The truth is, he made few friends during his grandeur among the royal sufferers, but advanced the old rebels. He was, however, though no considerable lawyer, <num value="1">one</num> who kept up the form and substance of things in the Nation with more solemnity than some would have had. He was my particular kind friend, on all occasions. The Cabal, however, prevailed, and that party in Parliament. Great division at Court concerning him, and divers great persons interceding for him.

When I saw these precious monuments miserably neglected, and scattered up and down about the garden, and other parts of Arundel House, and how exceedingly the corrosive air of London impaired them, I procured him to bestow them on the University of Oxford. This he was pleased to grant me; and now gave me the key of the gallery, with leave to mark all those stones, urns, altars, &amp;c., and whatever I found had inscriptions on them, that were not statues. This I did; and getting them removed and piled together, with those which were incrusted in the garden walls, I sent immediately letters to the Vice- Chancellor of what I had procured, and that if they esteemed it a service to the University (of which I had been a member), they should take order for their transportation.

<p>The Vice-Chancellor's letter to the same effect were too vainglorious to insert, with divers copies of verses that were also sent me. Their mentioning me in the inscription I totally declined, when I directed the titles of Mr. Howard, now made Lord, upon his Ambassage to Morocco. 
<p>These <num value="4">four</num> doctors, having made me this compliment, desired me to carry and introduce them to Mr. Howard, at Arundel-House: which I did, Dr. Barlow (Provost of Queen's) after a short speech, delivering a larger letter of the University's thanks, which was written in Latin, expressing the great sense they had of the honour done them. After this compliment handsomely performed and as nobly received, Mr. Howard accompanied the Doctors to their coach. That evening, I supped with them.

After some while deploring his condition to me, I took my leave. Next morning, I heard he was gone; though I am persuaded that, had he gone sooner, though but to Cornbury, and there lain quiet, it would have satisfied the Parliament. That which exasperated them was his presuming to stay and contest the accusation as long as it was possible: and they were on the point of sending him to the Tower.

He gives also there a list of Portraits which he recommended to be added, a little different from the list contained in the letter above-quoted; and he adds, that &ldquo;when Lord Clarendon's design of making this collection was known, everybody who had any of the portraits, or could purchase them at any price, strove to make their court by presenting them. By this means he got many excellent pieces of Vandyke, and other originals by Lely and other the best of our modern masters.&rdquo;</note>

<p><num value="7">7</num><hi rend=italics>th July.</hi> I went towards Oxford; lay at Little Wycomb. 
<p><num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Oxford. 
<p><num value="9">9</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> In the morning, was celebrated the Enc&aelig;nia of the New Theatre, so magnificently built by the munificence of Dr. Gilbert Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury, in which was spent <measure value="25000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="25000">25,000</num></measure>, as Sir Christopher Wren, the architect (as I remember), told me; and yet it was never seen by the benefactor, my Lord Archbishop having told me that he never did or ever would see it. It is, in truth, a fabric comparable to any of this kind of former ages, and doubtless exceeding any of the present, as this University does for colleges, libraries, schools, students, and order, all the Universities in the world. To the theatre is added the famous Sheldonian printing-house. This being at the Act and the <num value="1">first</num> time of opening the Theatre (Acts being formerly kept in St. Mary's church, which might be thought indecent, that being a place set apart for the immediate worship of God, and was the inducement for building this noble pile), it was now resolved to keep the present Act in it, and celebrate its dedication with the greatest splendour and formality that might be; and, therefore, drew a world of strangers, and other company, to the University, from all parts of the nation. 
<p>The Vice-Chancellor, Heads of Houses, and Doctors, being seated in magisterial seats, the Vice-Chancellor's chair and desk, Proctors, &amp;c. covered with brocatelle (a kind of brocade) and cloth of gold; the University Registrar read the founder's grant and gift of it to the University for their scholastic exercises upon these solemn occasions. Then <pb id="p.44" n="44"> 
<note place=marg>OXFORD,</note>
followed Dr. South,<note><p>Robert South, D. D., prebendary of Westminster and Canon of Christ-church, <num value="1">one</num> of the most eloquent preachers of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century. Pepys alludes to his having been seized with a fainting fit in the pulpit while preaching before the King. He nevertheless lived to the age of <num value="83">eighty-three</num>.</note> the University's orator, in an eloquent speech, which was very long, and not without some malicious and indecent reflections on the Royal Society, as underminers of the University; which was very foolish and untrue, as well as unseasonable. But, to let that pass from an illnatured man, the rest was in praise of the Archbishop and the ingenious architect. This ended, after loud music from the corridor above, where an organ was placed, there followed divers panegyric speeches, both in prose and verse, interchangeably pronounced by the young students placed in the rostrums, in Pindarics, Eclogues, Heroics, &amp;c., mingled with excellent music, vocal and instrumental, to entertain the ladies and the rest of the company. A speech was then made in praise of academical learning. This lasted from <num value="11">eleven</num> in the morning till <num value="7">seven</num> at night, which was concluded with ringing of bells, and universal joy and feasting. 
<p><num value="10">10</num><hi rend=italics>th July.</hi> The next day began the more solemn lectures in all the faculties, which were performed in the several schools, where all the Inceptor-Doctors did their exercises, the Professors having <num value="1">first</num> ended their reading. The assembly now returned to the Theatre, where the <hi rend=italics>Terr&oelig; filius</hi>
(the <hi rend=italics>University Buffoon</hi>) entertained the auditory with a tedious, abusive, sarcastical rhapsody, most unbecoming the gravity of the University, and that so grossly, that unless it be suppressed, it will be of ill consequence, as I afterwards plainly expressed my sense of it both to the Vice-Chancellor and several Heads of Houses, who were perfectly ashamed of it, and resolved to take care of it in future. The old facetious way of rallying upon the questions was left off, falling wholly upon persons, so that it was rather licentious lying and railing than genuine and noble wit. In my life, I was never witness of so shameful entertainment. 
<p>After this ribaldry, the Proctors made their speeches. Then began the music art, vocal and instrumental, above in the balustrade corridor opposite to the Vice-Chancellor's seat. Then, Dr. Wallis, the mathematical Professor, made <pb id="p.45" n="45"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1669--"><year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct>.</note>
his oration, and created <num value="1">one</num> Doctor of music according to the usual ceremonies of gown (which was of white damask), cap, ring, kiss, &amp;c. Next followed the disputations of the Inceptor-Doctors in Medicine, the speech of their Professor, Dr. Hyde, and so in course their respective creations. Then disputed the Inceptors of Law, the speech of their Professor, and creation. Lastly, Inceptors of Theology: Dr. Compton (brother to the Earl of Northampton) being junior, began with great modesty and applause; so the rest. After which, Dr. Tillotson, Dr. Sprat, &amp;c., and then Dr. Allestree's speech, the King's Professor, and their respective creations.<note><p>Thomas Hyde, D.D., Hebrew Reader, Keeper of the Bodleian Library, Prebend of Salisbury Cathedral, Regius Professor of Hebrew, and canon of Christchurch, Oxford; author of a Latin History of the Ancient Persians and Medes, and <num value="1">one</num> of Walton's coadjutors in the great polyglot Bible.

He was a zealous Protestant during the reign of James II., and not only was instrumental in bringing over William of Orange to this country, but placed the crown upon his head, on Archbishop Sancroft refusing to assist at the coronation. He wrote several works of a religious character, and a translation of the life of Donna Olympia Maldachina, from the Italian.

<p>Thus was the Theatre dedicated by the scholastic exercises in all the Faculties with great solemnity; and the night, as the former, entertaining the new Doctor's friends in feasting and music. I was invited by Dr. Barlow, the worthy and learned Professor of Queen's College. 
<p><num value="11">11</num><hi rend=italics>th July.</hi> The Act sermon was this forenoon preached by Dr. Hall, in St. Mary's, in an honest practical discourse against Atheism. In the afternoon, the church was so crowded, that not coming early I could not approach to hear. <pb id="p.46" n="46">

<p><num value="12">12</num><hi rend=italics>th July.</hi> Monday. Was held the Divinity Act in the Theatre again, when proceeded <num value="17">seventeen</num> Doctors, in all Faculties some. 
<p><num value="13">13</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> I dined at the Vice-Chancellor's, and spent the afternoon in seeing the rarities of the public libraries, and visiting the noble marbles and inscriptions, now inserted in the walls that compass the area of the Theatre, which were <num value="150">150</num> of the most ancient and worthy treasures of that kind in the learned world. Now, observing that people approach them too near, some idle persons began to scratch and injure them, I advised that a hedge of holly should be planted at the foot of the wall, to be kept breast-high only to protect them; which the Vice-Chancellor promised to do the next season. 
<p><num value="14">14</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Dr. Fell,<note><p>Afterwards Bishop of Oxford.</note> Dean of Christ-church and ViceChan- cellor, with Dr. Allestree, Professor, with beadles and maces before them, came to visit me at my lodging.&mdash;I went to visit Lord Howard's sons at Magdalen College. 
<p><num value="15">15</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Having <num value="2">two</num> days before had notice that the University intended me the honour of Doctorship, I was this morning attended by the beadles belonging to the Law, who conducted me to the Theatre, where I found the Duke of Ormond (now Chancellor of the University) with the Earl of Chesterfield and Mr. Spencer (brother to the late Earl of Sunderland). Thence, we marched to the Convocation- House, a convocation having been called on purpose; here, being all of us robed in the porch, in scarlet with caps and hoods, we were led in by the Professor of Laws, and presented respectively by name, with a short eulogy, to the Vice-Chancellor, who sate in the chair, with all the Doctors and Heads of Houses and masters about the room, which was exceeding full. Then, began the Public Orator his speech, directed chiefly to the Duke of Ormond, the Chancellor; but in which I had my compliment, in course. This ended, we were called up, and created Doctors according to the form, and seated by the Vice-Chancellor amongst the Doctors, on his right hand; then, the Vice-Chancellor made a short speech, and so, saluting our brother Doctors, the pageantry concluded, and the convocation was dissolved. So <pb id="p.47" n="47"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1669--"><year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct>.</note>
formal a creation of honorary Doctors had seldom been seen, that a convocation should be called on purpose, and speeches made by the Orator; but they could do no less, their Chancellor being to receive, or rather do them, this honour. I should have been made Doctor with the rest at the public Act, but their expectation of their Chancellor made them defer it. I was then led with my brother Doctors to an extraordinary entertainment at Doctor Mewes', head of St. John's College, and, after abundance of feasting and compliments, having visited the Vice-Chancellor and other Doctors, and given them thanks for the honour done me, I went towards home the <num value="16">16th</num>, and got as far as Windsor, and so to my house the next day.

After dinner, my Lord communicated to me his Majesty's desire that I would engage to write the History of our late War with the Hollanders, which I had hitherto declined; this I found was ill taken, and that I should disoblige his Majesty, who had made choice of me to do him this service, and, if I would undertake it, I should have all the assistance the Secretary's office and others could give me, with other encouragements, which I could not decently refuse. 
<p>Lord Stafford rose from table, in some disorder, because there were roses stuck about the fruit when the dessert was set on the table; such an antipathy, it seems, he had to them as once Lady Selenger<note><p>St. Leger.</note> also had, and to that degree that, as Sir Kenelm Digby tells us, laying but a rose upon her cheek when she was asleep, it raised a blister: but Sir Kenelm was a teller of strange things.

The old house large and ample, and built for ancient hospitality, ready to fall down with age, placed in a dirty hole, a stiff clay, no water, next an adjoining church-yard, and with other inconveniences. We pitched on a spot of rising ground, adorned with venerable woods, a dry and sweet prospect east and west, and fit for a park, but no running water; at a mile distance from the old house.

<p><num value="22">22</num><hi rend=italics>nd.</hi> We rode out to see the great mere, or level, of recovered fen land, not far off. In the way, we met Lord Arlington going to his house in Suffolk, accompanied with Count Ogniati, the Spanish minister, and Sir Bernard Gascoigne; he was very importunate with me to go with him to Euston, being but <num value="15">fifteen</num> miles distant; but, in regard of my company, I could not. So, passing through Newmarket, we alighted to see his Majesty's house there, now newbuild- ing; the arches of the cellars beneath are well turned by Mr. Samuel, the architect, the rest mean enough, and hardly fit for a hunting-house. Many of the rooms above had the <pb id="p.53" n="53">

chimneys in the angles and corners, a mode now introduced by his Majesty, which I do at no hand approve of. I predict it will spoil many noble houses and rooms, if followed. It does only well in very small and trifling rooms, but takes from the state of greater. Besides, this house is placed in a dirty street, without any court or avenue, like a common <num value="1">one</num>, whereas it might, and ought to have been built at either end of the town, upon the very carpet where the sports are celebrated; but, it being the purchase of an old wretched house of my Lord Thomond's, his Majesty was persuaded to set it on that foundation, the most improper imaginable for a house of sport and pleasure.<note><p>Sold by the Crown in <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>.</note>

<p>We went to see the stables and fine horses, of which many were here kept at a vast expense, with all the art and tenderness imaginable. 
<p>Being arrived at some meres, we found Lord Wotton and Sir John Kiviet<note><hi rend=italics>Ante</hi>, pp. <num value="22">22</num>, <num value="21">21</num>, <num value="32">32</num>.</note> about their draining-engines, having, it seems, undertaken to do wonders on a vast piece of marshground they had hired of Sir Thomas Chicheley, (Master of the Ordnance). They much pleased themselves with the hopes of a rich harvest of hemp and cole-seed, which was the crop expected. 
<p>Here we visited the engines and mills both for wind and water, draining it through <num value="2">two</num> rivers, or graffs, cut by hand, and capable of carrying considerable barges, which went thwart <num value="1">one</num> the other, discharging the water into the sea Such this spot had been the former winter; it was astonishing to see it now dry, and so rich that weeds grew on the banks, almost as high as a man and horse. Here, my Lord and his partner had built <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> rooms, with Flanders white bricks, very hard. <num value="1">One</num> of the great engines was in the kitchen, where I saw the fish swim up, even to the very chimney-hearth, by a small cut through the room, and running within a foot of the very fire. 
<p>Having, after dinner, ridden about that vast level, pestered with heat and swarms of gnats, we returned over Newmarket Heath, the way being mostly a sweet turf and down, like Salisbury Plain, the jockeys breathing their fine barbs and racers, and giving them their heats. <pb id="p.54" n="54">

<p><num value="23">23</num><hi rend=italics>rd July.</hi> We returned from Burrow-green to London, staying some time at Audley End. to see that fine palace. It is indeed a cheerful piece of Gothic building, or rather 
<hi rend=italics>antico moderno</hi>, but placed in an obscure bottom. The cellars and galleries are very stately. It has a river by it, a pretty avenue of limes, and in a park. 
<p>This is in Saffron Walden parish, famous for that useful plant, with which all the country is covered. 
<p>Dining at Bishop-Stortford, we came late to London. 
<p><num value="5">5</num><hi rend=italics>th August.</hi> There was sent me by a neighbour a servantmaid, who, in the last month, as she was sitting before her mistress at work, felt a stroke on her arm a little above the wrist for some height, the smart of which, as if struck by another hand, caused her to hold her arm awhile till somewhat mitigated; but it put her into a kind of convulsion, or rather hysteric fit. A gentleman coming casually in, looking on her arm, found that part powdered with red crosses, set in most exact and wonderful order, neither swelled nor depressed, about this shape, 
<FIGURE id="Fig.054"><HEAD>ZZZ</HEAD></FIGURE>
not seeming to be any way made by artifice, of a reddish colour, not so red as blood, the skin over them smooth, the rest of the arm livid and of a mortified hue, with certain prints as it were of the stroke of fingers. This had happened <num value="3">three</num> several times in July, at about <num value="10">ten</num> days' interval, the crosses beginning to wear out, but the successive ones set in other different, yet uniform order. The maid seemed very modest, and came from London to Deptford with her mistress, to avoid the discourse and importunity of curious people. She made no gain by it, pretended no religious fancies; but seemed to be a plain, ordinary, silent, working wench, somewhat fat, short, and high-coloured. She told me divers divines and physicians had seen her, but were unsatisfied; that she had taken some remedies against her fits, but they did her no good; she had never before had <pb id="p.55" n="55"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>.</note>
any fits; once since, she seemed in her sleep to hear <num value="1">one</num> say to her that she should tamper no more with them, nor trouble herself with any thing that happened, but put her trust in the merits of Christ only. 
<p>This is the substance of what she told me, and what I saw and curiously examined. I was formerly acquainted with the impostorious nuns of Loudun, in France, which made such noise amongst the Papists; I therefore thought this worth the notice. I remember Monsieur Monconys<note><p>Balthasar de Monconys, a Frenchman, celebrated for his travels in the East, which he published in <num value="3">three</num> volumes. His object was to discover vestiges of the philosophy of Trismegistus and Zoroaster; in which, it is hardly necessary to add, he was not very successful.</note> (that curious traveller and a Roman Catholic) was by no means satisfied with the <hi rend=italics>stigmata</hi> of those nuns, because they were so shy of letting him scrape the letters, which were Jesus, Maria, Joseph, (as I think,) observing they began to scale off with it, whereas this poor wench was willing to submit to any trial; so that I profess I know not what to think of it, nor dare I pronounce it anything supernatural. 
<p><num value="26">26</num><hi rend=italics>th August.</hi> At Windsor I supped with the Duke of Monmouth; and, the next day, invited by Lord Arlington, dined with the same Duke, and divers Lords. After dinner, my Lord and I had a conference of more than an hour alone in his bed-chamber, to engage me in the History. I showed him something that I had drawn up, to his great satisfaction, and he desired me to show it to the Treasurer.

<p>I dined with the Treasurer, and consulted with him what pieces I was to add; in the afternoon, the King took me aside into the balcony over the terrace, extremely pleased with what had been told him I had begun, in order to his commands, and enjoining me to proceed vigorously in it. He told me he had ordered the Secretaries of State to give me all necessary assistance of papers and particulars relating to it <pb id="p.56" n="56">

and enjoining me to make it a <hi rend=italics>little keen</hi>, for that the Hollanders had very unhandsomely abused him in their pictures, books, and libels. 
<p>Windsor was now going to be repaired, being exceedingly ragged and ruinous. Prince Rupert, the Constable, had begun to trim up the keep or high round Tower, and handsomely adorned his hall with furniture of arms, which was very singular, by so disposing the pikes, muskets, pistols, bandoleers, holsters, drums, back, breast, and headpieces, as was very extraordinary. Thus, those huge steep stairs ascending to it had the walls invested with this martial furniture, all new and bright, so disposing the bandoleers, holsters, and drums, as to represent festoons, and that without any confusion, trophy-like. From the hall we went into his bed-chamber, and ample rooms hung with tapestry, curious and effeminate pictures, so extremely different from the other, which presented nothing but war and horror. 
<p>The King passed most of his time in hunting the stag, and walking in the park, which he was now planting with rows of trees.

<p><QUOTE rend=blockquote><p><QUOTE rend=blockquote><hi rend=italics>Grinling Gibbon.</hi>&mdash;An original genius, a citizen of nature. There is no instance before him of a man who gave to wood the loose and airy lightness of flowers, and chained together the various productions of the elements with the free disorder natural to each species. It is uncertain whether he was born in Holland, or in England; it is said that he lived in Bell-Savage Court, Ludgate Hill, and was employed by Betterton, in decorating the Theatre, in Dorset Gardens. He lived afterwards at Deptford, in the same house with a musician, where the beneficent and curious Mr. Evelyn found and patronized both. This gentleman, Sir P. Lely, and Bap. May, who was something of an architeet himself, recommended Gibbon to Charles II., who was too indolent to search for genius, and too indiscriminate in his bounty to confine it to merit; but was always pleased when it was brought home to him. He gave the artist a place in the Board of Works, and employed his hand on ornaments of most taste in his palaces, particularly at Windsor. Gibbon, in gratitude, made a present of his own bast in wood to Mr. Evelyn, who kept it at his house in Dover-street. The piece that had struck so good a judge was a large carving, in wood, of St. Stephen stoned, long preserved in the sculptor's own house, and afterwards purchased and placed by the Duke of Chandos at Cannons.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Walpole is not quite correct, however, in such portions of this account as relate to Evelyn. Gibbon, when young, was found by Evelyn in a small house at Deptford, working on that famous piece from Tintoret here said to represent the stoning of St. Stephen, and which seems, from Evelyn's account, to have been his <num value="1">first</num> performance of consequence. But it must have been afterwards that he lived in Belle- Sauvage Yard, and that he worked on the Theatre in Dorset Gardens Evelyn does not mention a musician, and says there was only an old woman with him in the house at Deptford. It was Evelyn who recommended him to the King, to May the architect, and to Sir Christopher Wren. Of the bust nothing is known at Wotton.

near Sayes Court. I found him shut in; but looking in at the window, I perceived him carving that large cartoon, or crucifix, of Tintoretto, a copy of which I had myself brought from Venice, where the original painting remains. I asked if I might enter; he opened the door civilly to me, and I saw him about such a work as for the curiosity of handling, drawing, and studious exactness, I never had before seen in all my travels. I questioned him why he worked in such an obscure and lonesome place; he told me it was that he might apply himself to his profession without interruption, and wondered not a little how I found him out. I asked if he was unwilling to be made known to some great man, for that I believed it might turn to his profit; he answered, he was yet but a beginner, but would not be sorry to sell off that piece; on demanding the price, he said <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>. In good earnest, the very frame was worth the money, there being nothing in nature so tender and delicate as the flowers and festoons about it, and yet the work was very strong; in the piece was more than <num value="100">one hundred</num> figures of men, &amp;c. I found he was likewise musical, and very civil, sober, and discreet in his discourse. There was only an old woman in the house. So, desiring leave to visit him sometimes, I went away. 
<p>Of this young artist, together with my manner of finding him out, I acquainted the King, and begged that he would give me leave to bring him and his work to Whitehall, for that I would adventure my reputation with his Majesty that he had never seen anything approach it, and that he would be exceedingly pleased, and employ him.

was he entered and cast his eye on the work, but he was astonished at the curiosity of it; and having considered it a long time, and discoursed with Mr. Gibbon, whom I brought to kiss his hand, he commanded it should be immediately carried to the Queen's side to show her. It was carried up into her bed-chamber, where she and the King looked on and admired it again; the King, being called away, left us with the Queen, believing she would have bought it, it being a crucifix; but, when his Majesty was gone, a French peddling woman, <num value="1">one</num> Madame de Boord, who used to bring petticoats and fans, and baubles, out of France to the ladies, began to find fault with several things in the work, which she understood no more than an ass, or a monkey, so as in a kind of indignation, I caused the person who brought it to carry it back to the chamber, finding the Queen so much governed by an ignorant Frenchwoman, and this incomparable artist had his labour only for his pains, which not a little displeased me; and he was fain to send it down to his cottage again; he not long after sold it for <num value="80">80</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>, though well worth <num value="100">100</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>, without the frame, to Sir George Viner.

I thence walked with him through St. James's Park to the garden, where I both saw and heard a very familiar discourse between . . . . . and Mrs. Nelly,<note><p>Nell Gwynne: there can be no doubt as to the name with which we are to fill up these blanks.

This is another of the passages to which frequent reference has been made, and which are explained in the advertisement to the present edition of the Diary. The Monsieur de Grammont, who was <num value="1">one</num> of the party at the Treasurer's, was Philebert, Comte de Grammont, so well known by the Memoirs he dictated to his brother-in-law, Anthony, Count Hamilton. He died in <datestruct value="1707--"><year reg="1707">1707</year></datestruct>.</note> in company with Monsieur De Grammont and several French noblemen, and <num value="1">one</num> Blood, that impudent bold fellow who had not long before attempted to steal the imperial crown itself out of the Tower, pretending only curiosity of seeing the regalia there, when stabbing the keeper, though not mortally, he boldly went away with it through all the guards, taken only by the accident of his horse falling down. How he came to be pardoned, and even received into favour, not only after this, but several other exploits almost as daring both in Ireland and here, I could never come to anderstand. Some believed he became a spy of several parties, being well with the Sectaries and Enthusiasts, and did his Majesty services that way, which none alive could do so well as he; but it was <pb id="p.63" n="63"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>.</note>
certainly the boldest attempt, so the only treason of this sort that was ever pardoned. This man had not only a daring but a villanous unmerciful look, a false countenance, but very well-spoken, and dangerously insinuating. 
<p><num value="11">11</num><hi rend=italics>th May.</hi> I went to Eltham, to sit as <num value="1">one</num> of the Commissioners about the Subsidy now given by Parliament to his Majesty.

It was a good and charitable work and gift, but would have been better bestowed on the poor of that parish, than on the seamen's widows, the Trinity Company being very rich, and the rest of the poor of the parish exceedingly indigent. 
<p><num value="26">26</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> The Earl of Bristol's house in Queen's Street [Lincoln's Inn Fields) was taken for the Commissioners of Trade and Plantations, and furnished with rich hangings of the King's.

This day we met the Duke of Buckingham, Earl of Lauderdale, Lord Culpeper, Sir George Carteret, Vice-Chamberlain, and myself, had the oaths given us by the Earl of Sandwich, our President. It was to advise and counsel his Majesty, to the best of our abilities, for the well-governing of his Foreign Plantations, &amp;c., the form very little differing from that given to the Privy Council. We then took our places at the Board in the Council-Chamber, a very large room furnished with atlases, maps, charts, globes, &amp;c. Then came the Lord Keeper, Sir Orlando Bridgeman, Earl of Arlington, Secretary of State, Lord Ashley, Mr. Treasurer, Sir John Trevor, the other Secretary, Sir John Duncomb, Lord Allington, Mr. Grey,

Being all set, our Patent was read, and then the additional Patent, in which was recited this new establishment; then, was delivered to each a copy of the Patent, and of instructions: after which, we proceeded to business. 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> thing we did was, to settle the form of a circular letter to the Governors of all his Majesty's Plantations and Territories in the West Indies and Islands thereof, to give them notice to whom they should apply themselves on all occasions, and to render us an account of their present state and government; but, what we most insisted on was, to know the condition of New England, which appearing to be very independent as to their regard to Old England, or his Majesty, rich and strong as they now were, there were great debates in what style to write to them; for the condition of that Colony was such, that they were able to contest with all other Plantations about them, and there was fear of their breaking from all dependence on this nation; his Majesty, therefore, commended this affair more expressly. We, therefore, thought fit, in the <num value="1">first</num> place, to acquaint ourselves as well as we could of the state of that place, by some whom we heard of that were newly come from thence, and to be informed of their present posture and condition; some of our Council were for sending them a menacing letter, which those who better understood the peevish and touchy humour of that Colony, were utterly against. 
<p>A letter was then read from Sir Thomas Modiford, Governor of Jamaica; and then the Council brake up. 
<p>Having brought an action against <num value="1">one</num> Cocke, for money which he had received for me, it had been referred to an arbitration by the recommendation of that excellent good man, the Chief-Justice Hales;<note><p>Sir Matthew Hale, so famous as <num value="1">one</num> of the justices of the bench in Cromwell's time.

The matter in debate was, whether we should send a deputy to New England, requiring them of the Massachusets to restore such to their limits and respective possessions, as had petitioned the Council; this to be the open commission only; but, in truth, with secret instructions to inform us of the condition of those Colonies, and whether they were of such power, as to be able to resist his Majesty and declare for themselves as independent of the Crown, which we were told, and which of late years made them refractory. Colonel Middleton, being called in, assured us they might be curbed by a few of his Majesty's <num value="1">first</num>-rate frigates, to spoil their trade with the islands; but, though my Lord President was not satisfied, the rest were, and we did resolve to advise his Majesty to send Commissioners with a formal commission for adjusting boundaries, &amp;c., with some other instructions. 
<p><num value="19">19</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> To Council. The letters of Sir Thomas Modiford were read, giving relation of the exploit at Panama, which <pb id="p.67" n="67">

was very brave; they took, burnt, and pillaged the town of vast treasures, but the best of the booty had been shipped off, and lay at anchor in the South Sea, so that, after our men had ranged the country <num value="60">sixty</num> miles about, they went back to Nombre de Dies, and embarked for Jamaica. Such an action had not been done since the famous Drake. 
<p>I dined at the Hamburgh Resident's, and, after dinner, went to the christening of Sir Samuel Tuke's son, Charles, at Somerset-House, by a Popish priest, and many odd ceremonies. The godfathers were the King, and Lord Arundel of Wardour, and godmother, the Countess of Huntingdon.

<p><num value="9">9</num><hi rend=italics>th</hi> and <num value="10">10</num><hi rend=italics>th October.</hi> I went, after evening-service, to London, in order to a journey of refreshment with Mr. Treasurer, to Newmarket, where the King then was, in his coach with <num value="6">six</num> brave horses, which we changed thrice, <num value="1">first</num>, at Bishop-Stortford, and last, at Chesterford; so, by night, we got to Newmarket, where Mr. Henry Jermain (nephew to the Earl of St. Alban's) lodged me very civilly. We proceeded immediately to Court, the King and all the English gallants being there at their autumnal sports. Supped at the Lord Chamberlain's; and, the next day, after dinner, I was on the heath, where I saw the great match run between Woodcock and Flatfoot, belonging to the King, and to Mr. Eliot, of the Bedehamber, many thousands being spectators; a more signal race had not been run for many years. 
<p>This over, I went that night with Mr. Treasurer to Euston, a palace of Lord Arlington's, where we found Monsieur Colbert (the French Ambassador), and the famous new French Maid of Honour, Mademoiselle Querouaille,<note><hi rend=italics>Ante</hi>, p. <num value="57">57</num>.</note> now coming to be in great favour with the King. Here was also the Countess of Sunderland, and several lords and ladies, who lodged in the house. 
<p>During my stay here with Lord Arlington, near a fortnight, his Majesty came almost every <num value="2">second</num> day with the Duke, who commonly returned to Newmarket, but the King often lay here, during which time I had twice the honour to sit at dinner with him, with all freedom. It was universally reported that the fair lady &mdash;&mdash; was bedded <num value="1">one</num> of these nights, and the stocking flung, after the manner of a married bride; I acknowledge she was for the most part in her undress all day, and that there was fondness and toying with that young wanton; nay, it was said, I was at <pb id="p.69" n="69"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>.</note>
the former ceremony; but it is utterly false; I neither saw nor heard of any such thing whilst I was there, though I had been in her chamber, and all over that apartment late enough, and was myself observing all passages with much curiosity. However, it was with confidence believed she was <num value="1">first</num> made <hi rend=italics>a Miss</hi>, as they call these unhappy creatures, with solemnity at this time. 
<p>On Sunday, a young Cambridge Divine preached an excellent sermon in the chapel, the King and the Duke of York being present.

<p>In the morning, we went hunting and hawking; in the afternoon, till almost morning, to cards and dice, yet I must say without noise, swearing, quarrel, or confusion of any sort. I, who was no gamester, had often discourse with the French Ambassador, Colbert, and went sometimes abroad on horseback with the ladies to take the air, and now and then to hunting; thus idly passing the time, but not without more often recess to my pretty apartment, where I was quite out of all this hurry, and had leisure when I would, to converse with books, for there is no man more hospitably easy to be withal than my Lord Arlington, of whose particular friendship and kindness I had ever a more than ordinary share. His house is a very noble pile, consisting of <num value="4">four</num> pavilions after the French, beside a body of a large house, and, though not built altogether, but formed of additions to an old house (purchased by his Lordship of <num value="1">one</num> Sir T. Rookwood) yet with a vast expense made not only capable and roomsome, but very magnificent and commodious, as well within as without, nor less splendidly furnished. The stairease is very elegant, the garden handsome, the canal beautiful, but the soil dry, barren, and miserably sandy, which flies in drifts as the wind sits. Here my Lord was pleased to advise with me about ordering <pb id="p.70" n="70"> 
<note place=marg>NORWICH,</note>
his plantations of fins, elms, limes, &amp;c., up his park, and in all other places and avenues. I persuaded him to bring his park so near as to comprehend his house within it; which he resolved upon, it being now near a mile to it. The water furnishing the fountains, is raised by a pretty engine, or very slight plain wheels, which likewise serve to grind his corn, from a small cascade of the canal, the invention of Sir Samuel Morland.

He also told me that, though he kept that idle creature, Mrs. B &mdash;&mdash;, and would leave <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure> a year to the son he had by her, he would never marry her,<note><p>For the manner in which my Lord Howard, when Duke of Norfolk, kept his word in the matter of Mrs. B[ickerton], see <hi rend=italics>post</hi>, p. <num value="125">125</num>; also, p. <num value="128">128</num>.

illustrious friend of mine, his grandfather, should dishonour and pollute them both with those base and vicious courses he of late had taken since the death of Sir Samuel Tuke, and that of his own virtuous lady (my Lady Anne Somerset, sister to the Marquis); who, whilst they lived, preserved this gentleman by their example and advice from those many extravagances that impaired both his fortune and reputation. 
<p>Being come to the Ducal Palace, my Lord made very much of me; but I had little rest, so exceedingly desirous he was to show me the contrivance he had made for the entertainment of their Majesties, and the whole Court not long before, and which, though much of it was but temporary, apparently framed of boards only, was yet standing. As to the palace, it is an old wretched building, and that part of it newly built of brick, is very ill understood; so as I was of opinion it had been much better to have demolished all, and set it up in a better place, than to proceed any farther; for it stands in the very market-place, and though near a river, yet a very narrow muddy <num value="1">one</num>, without any extent. 
<p>Next morning, I went to see Sir Thomas Browne (with whom I had some time corresponded by letter, though I had never seen him before); his whole house and garden being a paradise and cabinet of rarities, and that of the best collection, especially medals, books, plants, and natural things. Amongst other curiosities, Sir Thomas had a collection of the eggs of all the fowl and birds he could procure, that country (especially the promontory of Norfolk) being frequented, as he said, by several kinds which seldom or never go farther into the land, as cranes, storks, eagles, and variety of water-fowl. He led me to see all the remarkable places of this ancient city, being <num value="1">one</num> of the largest, and certainly, after London, <num value="1">one</num> of the noblest of England, for its venerable cathedral, number of stately churches, cleanness of the streets, and buildings of flint so exquisitely headed and squared, as I was much astonished at; but he told me they had lost the art of squaring the flints, in which they so much excelled, and of which the churches, best houses, and walls, are built. The Castle is an antique extent of ground. which now they call Marsfield, and would <pb id="p.72" n="72"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
have been a fitting area to have placed the Ducal Palace in The suburbs are large, the prospects sweet, with other amenities, not omitting the flower-gardens, in which all the inhabitants excel. The fabric of stuffs brings a vast trade to this populous town. 
<p>Being returned to my Lord's, who had been with me all this morning, he advised with me concerning a plot to rebuild his house, having already, as he said, erected a front next the street, and a left wing, and now resolving to set up another wing and pavilion next the garden, and to convert the bowling-green into stables. My advice was, to desist from all, and to meditate wholly on rebuilding a handsome palace at Arundel House, in the Strand, before he proceeded farther here, and then to place this in the Castle, that ground belonging to his Lordship. 
<p>I observed that most of the church-yards (though some of them large enough) were filled up with earth, or rather the congestion of dead bodies <num value="1">one</num> upon another, for want of earth, even to the very top of the walls, and some above the walls, so as the churches seemed to be built in pits. 
<p><num value="18">18</num><hi rend=italics>th October.</hi> I returned to Euston, in Lord Henry Howard's coach, leaving him at Norwich, in company with a very ingenious gentleman, Mr. White, whose father and mother (daughter to the late Lord Treasurer Weston, Earl of Portland) I knew at Rome, where this gentleman was born, and where his parents lived and died with much reputation, during their banishment in our civil broils. 
<p><num value="21">21</num><hi rend=italics>st.</hi> Quitting Euston, I lodged this night at Newmarket, where I found the jolly blades racing, dancing, feasting, and revelling, more resembling a luxurious and abandoned rout, than a Christian Court.

<p><num value="12">12</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Now was the <num value="1">first</num> blow given by us to the Dutch convoy of the Smyrna fleet, by Sir Robert Holmes and Lord Ossory, in which we received little save blows, and a worthy reproach for attacking our neighbours &lsquo;ere any war was proclaimed, and then pretending the occasion to be, that some time before, the Merlin yacht chancing to sail through the whole Dutch fleet, their Admiral did not strike to that trifling vessel. Surely, this was a quarrel slenderly grounded, and not becoming Christian neighbours. We are like to thrive, accordingly. Lord Ossory several times deplored to me his being engaged in it; he had more justice and honour than in the least to approve of it, though he had been over-persuaded to the expedition. There is no doubt but we should have surprised this exceeding rich fleet, had not the avarice and ambition of Holmes and Spragge separated themselves, and wilfully divided our fleet, on presumption that either of them was strong enough to deal with the Dutch convoy without joining and mutual help; but they so warmly plied our divided fleets, that whilst in conflict the merchants sailed away, and got safe into Holland. 
<p>A few days before this, the Treasurer of the Household, Sir Thomas Clifford,<note><p>&ldquo;On the King's intention to have a Lord Treasurer (<datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>), instead of putting the Seals into Commission, the Duke of York desired Lord Arlington to join with him in proposing to the King the Lord Clifford for that considerable employment; but he found Lord Arlington very cold in it, and endeavouring to persuade the Duke that the King did not intend the alteration; and, the next day, he employed a friend to press the Duke to endeavour to get Sir Robert Car to be Commissioner in the room of Lord Shaftesbury (then appointed Lord Chancellor). 
<p>&ldquo;Some few days after, the Duke proposed to his Majesty the Lord Clifford as Treasurer, which was well received, and he said he would do it, as thinking nobody fitter; he also told the Duke that Lord Arlington had a mind to have that Staff but he answered him that he had too much kindness for him to let him have it, for he knew he was not fit for the office; and should he give it him, it would be his ruin. A little after, the King told the Duke that he found Lord Arlington was angry with Lord Clifford, on knowing that he was to have the place; and desired the Duke to persuade Lord Arlington not to let the world see his discontent, and to endeavour to make them continue friends. They promised the Duke to live friendly together; but Lord Arlington kept not his word, and was ever after cold, if not worse, towards him. 
<p>&ldquo;Christmas coming on, the King spake to Lord Clifford and Lord Arundel of Wardour, to persuade the Duke to receive the Sacrament with him at that time (which the Duke had forborne for several months before). They urged the King not to press it, and he then seemed satisfied: but the day before Christmas Eve, the King spoke again to Lord Clifford to represent to the Duke what he had before said, which the Lord Clifford did, but found the Duke was not to be moved in his resolution of not going against his conscience.&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend=italics>King James's Life, by himself.</hi></note> hinted to me, as a confidant, that his <pb id="p.76" n="76"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
Majesty would <hi rend=italics>snut up the Exchequer</hi> (and, accordingly, his Majesty made use of infinite treasure there, to prepare for an intended rupture); but, says he, it will soon be open again, and everybody satisfied; for this bold man, who had been the sole adviser of the King to invade that sacred stock (though some pretend it was Lord Ashley's counsel, then Chancellor of the Exchequer), was so over-confident of the success of this unworthy design against the Smyrna merchants, as to put his Majesty on an action which not only lost the hearts of his subjects, and ruined many widows and orphans, whose stocks were lent him, but the reputation of his Exchequer for ever, it being before in such credit, that he might have commanded half the wealth of the nation. 
<p>The credit of this bank being thus broken, did exceedingly discontent the people, and never did his Majesty's affairs prosper to any purpose after it, for as it did not supply the expense of the meditated war, so it melted away, I know not how. 
<p>To this succeeded the King's Declaration for an universal toleration; Papists, and swarms of Sectaries, now boldly showing themselves in their public meetings. This was imputed to the same council, Clifford warping to Rome as was believed, nor was Lord Arlington clear of suspicion, to gratify that party, but as since it has proved, and was <pb id="p.77" n="77">

then evidently foreseen, to the extreme weakening the Church of England and its Episcopal Government, as it was projected. I speak not this as my own sense, but what was the discourse and thoughts of others, who were lookers-on; for I think there might be some relaxations without the least prejudice to the present Establishment, discreetly limited, but to let go the reins in this manner, and then to imagine they could take them up again as easily, was a false policy, and greatly destructive. The truth is, our Bishops slipped the occasion; for, had they held a steady hand upon his Majesty's restoration, as they might easily have done, the Church of England had emerged and flourished, without interruption; but they were then remiss, and covetous after advantages of another kind, whilst his Majesty suffered them to come into a harvest, with which, without any injustice, he might have remunerated innumerable gallant gentlemen for their services, who had ruined themselves in the late rebellion.<note><p>Evelyn here alludes to the fines for renewals of leases not filled up during the interregnum, and now to be immediately applied for.

Having taken order for the accommodation of the wounded, I came back through a country the best cultivated of any that in my life I had anywhere seen, every field lying as even as a bowling-green, and the fences, plantations, and husbandry, in such admirable order, as infinitely delighted me, after the sad and afflicting spectacles and objects I was come from. Observing almost every tall tree to have a weathercock on the top bough, and some trees half-a-dozen, I learned that, on a certain holyday, the farmers feast their servants; at which solemnity, they set up these cocks, in a kind of triumph.

Lord, whom they honoured and loved above their own lives. 
<p>Here, I cannot but make some reflections on things past. It was not above a day or <num value="2">two</num> that going to Whitehall to take leave of his Lordship, who had his lodgings in the Privy-Garden, shaking me by the hand he bid me good-bye, and said he thought he should see me no more, and I saw, to my thinking, something boding in his countenance: &ldquo;No,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;they will not have me live. Had I lost a fleet (meaning on his return from Bergen when he took the East India prize) I should have fared better; but, be as it pleases God&mdash;I must do something, I know not what, to save my reputation. Something to this effect, he had hinted to me; thus I took my leave. I well remember that the Duke of Albemarle, and my now Lord Clifford, had, I know not why, no great opinion of his courage, because, in former conflicts, being an able and experienced seaman (which neither of them were), he always brought off his Majesty's ships without loss, though not without as many marks of true courage as the stoutest of them; and I am a witness that, in the late war, his own ship was pierced like a colander. But the business was, he was utterly against this war from the beginning, and abhorred the attacking of the Smyrna fleet; he did not favour the heady expedition of Clifford at Bergen, nor was he so furious and confident as was the Duke of Albemarle, who believed he could vanquish the Hollanders with <num value="1">one</num> squadron. My Lord Sandwich was prudent as well as valiant, and always governed his affairs with success and little loss; he was for deliberation and reason, they for action and slaughter without either; and for this, whispered as if my Lord Sandwich was not so gallant, because he was not so rash, and knew how fatal it was to lose a fleet, such as was that under his conduct, and for which these very persons would have censured him on the other side. This it was, I am confident, grieved him, and made him enter like a lion, and fight like <num value="1">one</num>, too, in the midst of the hottest service, where the stoutest of the rest seeing him engaged, and so many ships upon him, durst not, or would not, come to his succour, as some of them, whom I know, might have done. Thus, this gallant person perished, to gratify the pride and envy of some I named. <pb id="p.82" n="82">

<p>Deplorable was the loss of <num value="1">one</num> of the best accomplished persons, not only of this nation but of any other. He was learned in sea-affairs, in politics, in mathematics, and in music: he had been on divers embassies, was of a sweet and obliging temper, sober, chaste, very ingenious, a true nobleman, an ornament to the Court and his Prince; nor has he left any behind him who approach his many virtues. 
<p>He had, I confess, served the tyrant Cromwell, when a young man, but it was without malice, as a soldier of fortune; and he readily submitted, and that with joy, bringing an entire fleet with him from the Sound, at the <num value="1">first</num> tidings of his Majesty's restoration. I verily believe him as faithful a subject as any that were not his friends. I am yet heartily grieved at this mighty loss, nor do I call it to my thoughts without emotion. 
<p><num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>nd June.</hi> Trinity-Sunday, I passed at Rochester; and, on the <num value="5">5th</num>, there was buried in the Cathedral Monsieur Rabini&eacute;re, Rear-Admiral of the French squadron, a gallant person, who died of the wounds he received in the fight. This ceremony lay on me, which I performed with all the decency I could, inviting the Mayor and Aldermen to come in their formalities. Sir Jonas Atkins was there with his guards; and the Dean and Prebendaries: <num value="1">one</num> of his countrymen pronouncing a funeral oration at the brink of his grave, which I caused to be dug in the choir. This is more at large described in the Gazette of that day; Colonel Reymes, my colleague in commission, assisting, who was so kind as to accompany me from London, though it was not his district; for indeed the stress of both these wars lay more on me by far than on any of my brethren, who had littleto do in theirs.&mdash;I went to see Upnore Castle, which I found pretty well defended, but of no great moment. 
<p>Next day, I sailed to the fleet, now riding at the buoy of the Nore, where I met his Majesty, the Duke, Lord Arlington, and all the great men, in the Charles, lying miserably shattered; but the miss of Lord Sandwich redoubled the loss to me, and showed the folly of hazarding so brave a fleet, and losing so many good men, for no provocation but that the Hollanders exceeded us in industry, and in all things but envy.

Then, he melted pitch and wax with sulphur, which he drank down, as it flamed; I saw it flaming in his mouth, a good while; he also took up a thick piece of iron, such as laundresses use to put in their smoothing boxes, when it was fiery hot, held it between his teeth, then in his hand, and threw it about like a stone; but this I observed, he cared not to hold very long; then, he stood on a small pot; and, bending his body, took a glowing iron with his mouth from between his feet, without touching the pot, or ground, with his hands; with divers other prodigious feats.

I found him in his study, and restored to him several papers of state, and others of importance, which he had furnished me with, on engaging me to write the History of the Holland War, with other private letters of his acknowledgments to my Lord Arlington, who from a private gentleman of a very noble family, but inconsiderable fortune, had advanced him from almost nothing. The <num value="1">first</num> thing was his being in Parlia- <pb id="p.92" n="92"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
ment, then knighted, then made <num value="1">one</num> of the Commissioners of sick and wounded, on which occasion, we sate long together; then, on the death of Hugh Pollard, he was made Comptroller of the Household and Privy Councillor, yet still my brother Commissioner; after the death of Lord Fitz-Harding, Treasurer of the Household, he, by letters to Lord Arlington, which that Lord showed me, begged of his Lordship to obtain it for him as the very height of his ambition. These were written with such submissions and professions of his patronage, as I had never seen any more acknowledging. The Earl of Southampton then dying, he was made <num value="1">one</num> of the Commissioners of the Treasury. His Majesty inclining to put it into <num value="1">one</num> hand, my Lord Clifford, under pretence of making all his interest for his patron, my Lord Arlington, cut the grass under his feet, and procured it for himself, assuring the King that Lord Arlington did not desire it. Indeed, my Lord Arlington protested to me that his confidence in Lord Clifford made him so remiss, and his affection to him was so particular, that he was absolutely minded to devolve it on Lord Clifford, all the world knowing how he himself affected ease and quiet, now growing into years, yet little thinking of this go-by. This was the only great ingratitude Lord Clifford showed, keeping my Lord Arlington in ignorance, continually assuring him he was pursuing his interest, which was the Duke's, into whose great favour Lord Clifford was now gotten; but which certainly cost him the loss of all, namely, his going so irrevocably far in his interest. 
<p>For the rest, my Lord Clifford was a valiant incorrupt gentleman, ambitious, not covetous; generous, passionate, a most constant sincere friend, to me in particular, so as when he laid down his office, I was at the end of all my hopes and endeavours. These were not for high matters, but to obtain what his Majesty was really indebted to my father-in-law, which was the utmost of my ambition, and which I had undoubtedly obtained, if this friend had stood. Sir Thomas Osborn, who succeeded him, though much more obliged to my father-in-law and his family, and my long and old acquaintance, being of a more haughty and far less obliging nature, I could hope for little; a man of excellent natural parts; but nothing of generous or grateful. <pb id="p.93" n="93"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1673--"><year reg="1673">1673</year></datestruct>.</note>

<p>Taking leave of my Lord Clifford, he wrung me by the hand, and, looking earnestly on me, bid me God-b'ye, adding, &ldquo;Mr. Evelyn, I shall never see thee more.&rdquo; &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;my Lord, what's the meaning of this? I hope I shall see you often, and as great a person again.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, Mr. Evelyn, do not expect it, I will never see this place, this City, or Court again,&rdquo; or words of this sound. In this manner, not without almost mutual tears, I parted from him; nor was it long after, but the news was that he was dead, and I have heard from some who I believe knew, he made himself away, after an extraordinary melancholy. This is not confidently affirmed, but a servant who lived in the house, and afterwards with Sir Robert Clayton, Lord Mayor, did, as well as others, report it; and when I hinted some such thing to Mr. Prideaux, <num value="1">one</num> of his trustees, he was not willing to enter into that discourse. 
<p>It was reported with these particulars, that, causing his servant to leave him unusually <num value="1">one</num> morning, locking himself in, he strangled himself with his cravat upon the bed-tester; his servant, not liking the manner of dismissing him, and looking through the key-hole, (as I remember), and seeing his master hanging, brake in before he was quite dead, and taking him down, vomiting a great deal of blood, he was heard to utter these words, &ldquo;Well; let men say what they will, there is a God, a just God above;&rdquo; after which he spake no more. This, if true, is dismal. Really, he was the chief occasion of the Dutch war, and of all that blood which was lost at Bergen in attacking the Smyrna fleet, and that whole quarrel. 
<p>This leads me to call to mind what my Lord Chancellor Shaftesbury affirmed, not to me only, but to all my brethren the Council of Foreign Plantations, when not long after, this accident being mentioned as we were <num value="1">one</num> day sitting in Council, his Lordship told us this remarkable passage: that, being <num value="1">one</num> day discoursing with him when he was only Sir Thomas Clifford, speaking of men's advancement to great charges in the nation, &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;my Lord, I shall be <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest men in England. Don't impute what I say either to fancy, or vanity; I am certain that I shall be a mighty man; but it will not last long; I shall not hold it, but die a bloody death.&rdquo; &ldquo;What,&rdquo; says my Lord, <pb id="p.94" n="94"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
&ldquo;your horoscope tells you so?&rdquo; &ldquo;No matter for that, it will be as I tell you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says my Lord Chancellor Shaftesbury, &ldquo;if I were of that opinion, I either would not be a great man, but decline preferment, or prevent my danger.&rdquo; 
<p>This my Lord affirmed in my hearing, before several gentlemen and noblemen sitting in council at Whitehall. And I the rather am confident of it, remembering what Sir Edward Walker (Garter King-at-Arms)<note><p>Celebrated for his knowledge of heraldry. He attended Charles II. into exile, and after the Restoration he became <num value="1">first</num> Clerk of the Privy Council, and subsequently Garter King-at-Arms. Author, among other works, of <hi rend=italics>Iter Carolinum</hi>, or an account of the Marches, &amp;c, of King Charles I., <hi rend=italics>Military Discoveries, Historical Discoveries</hi>, &amp;c. He died in <datestruct value="1677--"><year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>. Pepys describes his bringing the Garter to the Earl of Sandwich, and his officiating at the coronation of Charles II.</note> had likewise affirmed to me a long time before, even when he was <num value="1">first</num> made a Lord; that carrying his pedigree to Lord Clifford on his being created a peer, and, finding him busy, he bade him go into his study, and divert himself there till he was at leisure to discourse with him about some things relating to his family; there lay, said Sir Edward, on his table, his horoscope and nativity calculated, with some writing under it, where he read that he should be advanced to the highest degree in the state that could be conferred upon him, but that he should not long enjoy it, but should die, or expressions to that sense; and I think, (but cannot confidently say) a bloody death. This Sir Edward affirmed both to me and Sir Richard Browne; nor could I forbear to note this extraordinary passage in these memoirs.

I returned in the evening with Sir Joseph Williamson, now declared Secretary of State. He was son of a poor clergyman somewhere in Cumberland, brought up at Queen's College, Oxford, of which he came to <pb id="p.97" n="97">

be a fellow; then travelled with . . . . . and returning when the King was restored, was received as a Clerk under Mr. Secretary Nicholas. Sir Henry Bennett (now Lord Arlington) succeeding, Williamson is transferred to him, who loving his ease more than business (though sufficiently able had he applied himself to it) remitted all to his man Williamson; and, in a short time, let him so into the secret of affairs, that (as his Lordship himself told me) there was a kind of necessity to advance him; and so, by his subtlety, dexterity, and insinuation, he got now to be principal Secretary; absolutely Lord Arlington's creature, and ungrateful enough. It has been the fate of this obliging favourite to advance those who soon forgot their original. Sir Joseph was a musician, could play at <hi rend=italics>Jeu de Goblets</hi>, exceeding formal, a severe master to his servants, but so inward with my Lord O&lsquo;Brien, that after a few months of that gentleman's death, he married his widow,<note><p>Lady Catherine Stuart, sister and heir to Charles Stuart, Duke of Richmond and Lennox, the husband of Mrs. Frances Stuart, <num value="1">one</num> of the most admired beauties of the Court, with whom Charles the <num value="2">Second</num> was so deeply in love that he never forgave the Duke for marrying her, having already, it is thought, formed some similar intention himself. He took the <num value="1">first</num> opportunity of sending the Duke into an honourable exile, as Ambassador to Denmark, where he shortly after died, leaving no issue by the Duchess.</note> who, being sister and heir of the Duke of Richmond, brought him a noble fortune.

that the Holland Ambassador had complained to him of what I had touched of the Flags and Fishery, &amp;c., and desired the book might be called in; whilst, on the other side, he assured me he was exceedingly pleased with what I had done, and gave me many thanks. However, it being just upon conclusion of the treaty of Breda (indeed it was designed to have been published some months before and when we were at defiance), his Majesty told me he must recall it formally; but gave order that what copies should be publicly seized to pacify the Ambassador, should immediately be restored to the printer, and that neither he nor the vender should be molested. The truth is, that which touched the Hollander was much less than what the King himself furnished me with, and obliged me to publish, having caused it to be read to him before it went to the press; but the error was, it should have been published before the peace was proclaimed. The noise of this book's suppression made it presently be bought up, and turned much to the stationer's advantage. It was no other than the Preface prepared to be prefixed to my History of the whole War; which I now pursued no further.

It was attacked by the Duke of Monmouth (newly come from the real siege) and the Duke of York, with a little army, to show their skill in tactics. On Saturday night, they made their approaches, opened trenches, raised batteries, took the counterscarp and ravelin, after a stout defence; great guns fired on both sides, grenadoes shot, mines sprung, parties sent out, attempts of raising the siege, <pb id="p.99" n="99">

<p>Sir William, amongst other inventions, was author of the double-bottomed ship,<note><p>See 
<hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, vol. i. pp. <num value="400">400</num>, <num value="409">409</num>.</note> which perished, and he was censured for rashness, being lost in the Bay of Biscay in a storm, when, I think, <num value="15">fifteen</num> other vessels miscarried. This vessel was flat-bottomed, of exceeding use to put into shallow ports, and ride over small depths of water. It consisted of <num value="2">two</num> distinct keels cramped together with huge timbers, &amp;c., so as that a violent stream ran between; it bare a monstrous broad sail, and he still persists that it is practicable, and of exceeding use; and he has often told me he would adventure himself in such another, could he procure sailors, and his Majesty's permission to make a <num value="2">second</num> Experiment; which name the King gave the vessel at the launching. 
<p>The Map of Ireland made by Sir William Petty is believed to be the most exact that ever yet was made of any country. He did promise to publish it; and I am told it has cost him near <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct></measure> to have it engraved at Amsterdam. There is not a better Latin poet living, when he gives himself that diversion; nor is his excellence less in Council and prudent matters of state; but he is so exceeding nice in sifting and examining all possible contingencies, that he adventures at nothing which is not demonstration. There was not in the whole world his equal for a superintendent of manufacture and improvement of trade, or to govern a plantation. If I were a Prince, I should make him my <num value="2">second</num> Counsellor, at least. There is nothing difficult to him. He is, besides, courageous; on which account, I cannot but note a true story of him, that when Sir Aleyn Brodrick sent him a challenge upon a difference betwixt <pb id="p.103" n="103"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>.</note>
there in Ireland, Sir William, though exceedingly purblind, accepted the challenge, and it being his part to propound the weapon, desired his antagonist to meet him with a hatchet, or axe, in a dark cellar; which the other, of course, refused. 
<p>Sir William was, with all this, facetious and of easy conversation, friendly and courteous, and had such a faculty of imitating others, that he would take a text and preach, now like a grave orthodox divine, then falling into the Presbyterian way, then to the fanatical, the Quaker, the monk and friar, the Popish priest, with such admirable action, and alteration of voice and tone, as it was not possible to abstain from wonder, and <num value="1">one</num> would swear to hear several persons, or forbear to think he was not in good earnest an enthusiast and almost beside himself; then, he would fall out of it into a serious discourse; but it was very rarely he would be prevailed on to oblige the company with this faculty, and that only amongst most intimate friends. My Lord Duke of Ormond once obtained it of him, and was almost ravished with admiration; but by-and-bye, he fell upon a serious reprimand of the faults and miscarriages of some Princes and Governors, which, though he named none, did so sensibly touch the Duke, who was then Lieutenant of Ireland, that he began to be very uneasy, and wished the spirit laid which he had raised, for he was neither able to endure such truths, nor could he but be delighted. At last, he melted his discourse to a ridiculous subject, and came down from the joint stool on which he had stood; but my lord would not have him preach any more. He never could get favour at Court, because he outwitted all the projectors that came near him. Having never known such another genius, I cannot but mention these particulars, amongst a multitude of others which I could produce. When I, who knew him in mean circumstances, have been in his splendid palace, he would himself be in admiration how he arrived at it; nor was it his value or inclination for splendid furniture and the curiosities of the age, but his elegant lady could endure nothing mean, or that was not magnificent. He was very negligent himself, and rather so of his person, and of a philosophic temper. &ldquo;What a to-do is here!&rdquo; would he say, &ldquo;I can lie in straw with as much satisfaction.&rdquo; <pb id="p.104" n="104">

This gentleman's house was not a mile from Brest; Sir Richard made an acquaintance there, and, being used very civilly, was obliged to return it here, which we did. He seemed a soldierly person and a good fellow, as the Bretons generally are; his lady had been very handsome, and seemed a shrewd understanding woman. Conversing with him in our garden, I found several words of the Breton language the same with our Welch. His daughter was now made Duchess of Portsmouth, and in the height of favour; but he never made any use of it. 
<p><num value="27">27</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> At Ely House, I went to the consecration of my worthy friend, the learned Dr. Barlow, Warden of Queen's College, Oxford, now made Bishop of Lincoln.

Next day, dining at Shotover, at Sir Timothy Tyrill's, a sweet place, we lay at Oxford, where it was the time of the Act.

<p><num value="11">11</num><hi rend=italics>th July.</hi> We heard the speeches, and saw the ceremony of creating Doctors in Divinity, Law, and Physic. I had, early in the morning, heard Dr. Morison, Botanic Professor, read on divers plants in the Physic Garden: and saw that rare collection of natural curiosities of Dr. Plot's, of Magdalen Hall, author of <hi rend=italics>The Natural History of Oxfordshire</hi>, all of them collected in that shire, and indeed extraordinary, that in <num value="1">one</num> county there should be found such variety of plants, shells, stones, minerals, marcasites, fowls, insects, models of works, crystals, agates and marbles. He was now intending to visit Staffordshire, and, as he had of Oxfordshire, to give us the natural, topical, political, and mechanical history.

<p>I visited also the Bodleian Library, and my old friend, the learned Obadiah Walker, head of University College, which he had now almost re-built, or repaired. We then proceeded to Northampton, where we arrived the next day. 
<p>In this journey, went part of the way Mr. James Graham (since Privy Purse to the Duke), a young gentleman exceedingly in love with Mrs. Dorothy Howard, <num value="1">one</num> of the Maids of Honour in our company.<note><p>He afterwards married her. See the next note.</note> I could not but pity them both, the mother not much favouring it. This lady was not only a great beauty, but a most virtuous and excellent creature, and worthy to have been wife to the best of men. My advice was required, and I spake to the advantage of the young gentleman, more out of pity than <pb id="p.107" n="107">

that she deserved no better match; for, though he was a gentleman of good family, yet there was great inequality. 
<p><num value="14">14</num><hi rend=italics>th July.</hi> I went to see my Lord Sunderland's Seat at Althorpe, <num value="4">four</num> miles from the ragged town of Northampton (since burnt, and well re-built). It is placed in a pretty open bottom, very finely watered and flanked with stately woods and groves in a park, with a canal, but the water is not running, which is a defect. The house, a kind of modern building, of freestone, within most nobly furnished; the apartments very commodious, a gallery and noble hall; but the kitchen being in the body of the house, and chapel too small, were defects. There is an old yet honourable gate-house standing awry, and out-housing mean, but designed to be taken away. It was moated round, after the old manner, but it is now dry, and turfed with a beautiful carpet. Above all, are admirable and magnificent the several ample gardens furnished with the choicest fruit, and exquisitely kept. Great plenty of oranges, and other curiosities. The park full of fowl, especially herns, and from it a prospect to Holmby House, which being demolished in the late civil wars, shows like a Roman ruin, shaded by the trees about it, a stately, solemn, and pleasing view. 
<p><num value="15">15</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Our cause was pleaded in behalf of the mother, Mrs. Howard<note><p>Mrs. Howard was widow of William, <num value="4">fourth</num> son of the <num value="1">first</num> Earl of Berkshire, being the daughter of Lord Dundas, a Scottish peer. They had <num value="1">one</num> son, Craven Howard, and <num value="2">two</num> daughters, Dorothy, who married Colonel James Graham, of Levens, in Westmoreland; and Anne, who married Sir Gabriel Sylvius, Knt. Craven married <num value="2">two</num> wives, the <num value="1">first</num> of whom was Anne Ogle, of the family of the Ogles of Pinchbeck, in the county of Lincoln. She was Maid of honour to Queen Catherine at the time. The <num value="2">two</num> daughters are the ladies mentioned by Evelyn in the text; but he is not correct in calling Craven heir-apparent of the Earl of Berks, since, besides the uncle then in possession of the title, there was another uncle before him, who in fact inherited it, and did not die till many years after.</note> and her daughters, before Baron Thurland, who had formerly been steward of Courts for me; we carried our cause, as there was reason, for here was an imprudent as well as disobedient son against his mother, by instigation, doubtless, of his wife, <num value="1">one</num> Mrs. Ogle, (an ancient maid), whom he had clandestinely married, and who brought <pb id="p.108" n="108"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
him no fortune, he being heir-apparent to the Earl of Berkshire. We lay at Brickhill, in Bedfordshire, and came late the next day to our journey's end. 
<p>This was a journey of adventures and knight-errantry. <num value="1">One</num> of the lady's servants being as desperately in love with Mrs. Howard's woman, as Mr. Graham was with her daughter, and she riding on horseback behind his rival, the amorous and jealous youth having a little drink in his pate, had here killed himself had he not been prevented; for, alighting from his horse, and drawing his sword, he endeavoured twice or thrice to fall on it, but was interrupted by our coachman, and a stranger passing by. After this, running to his rival, and snatching his sword from his side (for we had beaten his own out of his hand), and on the sudden pulling down his mistress, would have run both of them through; we parted them, not without some blood. This miserable creature poisoned himself for her not many days after they came to London.

<p><num value="9">9</num><hi rend=italics>th August.</hi> Dr. Sprat, prebend of Westminster, and Chaplain to the Duke of Buckingham, preached on the <num value="3">3rd</num> Epistle of Jude, showing what the primitive faith was, how near it and how excellent that of the Church of England, also the danger of departing from it.

<p><num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>nd September.</hi> I went to see Dulwich College, being the pious foundation of <num value="1">one</num> Alleyn, a famous comedian, in King James's time. The chapel is pretty, the rest of the hospital very ill contrived; it yet maintains divers poor of both sexes. It is in a melancholy part of Camberwell parish. I came back by certain medicinal Spa waters, at a place called Sydenham Wells, in Lewisham parish, much frequented in summer. 
<p><num value="10">10</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> I was casually showed the Duchess of Portsmouth's splendid apartment at Whitehall, luxuriously furnished, and with <num value="10">ten</num> times the richness and glory beyond the Queen's; such massy pieces of plate, whole tables, and stands of incredible value.

<p><num value="15">15</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> I got an extreme cold, such as was afterwards so epidemical, as not only to afflict us in this island, but was rife over all Europe, like a plague. It was after an exceeding dry summer and autumn.

It was almost a miraculous restoration. The next day he was carried to Berkeley-House. This stopped his journey for the present, and caused my stay in town. He had put all his affairs and his whole estate in England into my hands during his intended absence, which though I was very unfit to undertake, in regard of many businesses which then took me up. yet, upon the great importunity of my lady and Mr. Godolphin (to whom I could refuse nothing) I did take it on me.

There were with him my Lady his wife, and my dear friend, Mrs. Godolphin, who, out of an extraordinary friendship, would needs accompany my lady to Paris, and stay with her some time, which was the chief inducement for permitting my Son to travel, but I knew him safe under her inspection, and in regard my Lord himself had promised to take him into his special favour, he having intrusted all he had to my care. 
<p>Thus, we set out, <num value="3">three</num> coaches (besides mine), <num value="3">three</num> waggons, and about <num value="40">forty</num> horse. It being late, and my Lord as yet but valetudinary, we got but to Dartford, the <num value="1">first</num> day, the next to Sittingbourne.

<p><num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>th September.</hi> I went to visit my Lord Crofts, now dying at St. Edmunds Bury, and took the opportunity to see this ancient town, and the remains of that famous monastery and abbey. There is little standing entire, save the gatehouse; it has been a vast and magnificent Gothic structure, and of great extent. The gates are wood, but quite plated over with iron. There are also <num value="2">two</num> stately churches, <num value="1">one</num> especially. 
<p><num value="5">5</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> I went to Thetford, to the borough-town, where stand the ruins of a religious house: there is a round mountain artificially raised, either for some castle, or monument, which makes a pretty landscape. As we went and returned, a tumbler showed his extraordinary address in the Warren. I also saw the Decoy; much pleased with the stratagem. 
<p><num value="7">7</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> There dined this day at my Lord's <num value="1">one</num> Sir John Gaudy, a very handsome person, but quite dumb, yet very intelligent by signs, and a very fine painter; he was so civil and well bred, as it was not possible to discern any imperfection in him.

<p><num value="9">9</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> A stranger preached at Euston Church, and fell into a handsome panegyric on my Lord's new building the church, which indeed for its elegance and cheerfulness, is <num value="1">one</num> of the prettiest country churches in England. My Lord told me his heart smote him that, after he had bestowed so much on his magnificent palace there, he should see God's House in the ruin it lay in. He has also re-built the parsonage-house, all of stone, very neat and ample. 
<p><num value="10">10</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> To divert me, my Lord would needs carry me to see Ipswich, when we dined with <num value="1">one</num> Mr. Mann by the way, who was Recorder of the town.

After dinner, came the Bailiff and Magistrates in their formalities with their maces to compliment my Lord, and invite him to the town-house, where they presented us a collation of dried sweetmeats and wine, the bells ringing, &amp;c. Then, we went to see the town, and <num value="1">first</num>, the Lord Viscount <pb id="p.119" n="119"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1677--"><year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>.</note>
Hereford's house, which stands in a park near the town, like that at Brussels, in Flanders; the house not great, yet pretty, especially the hall. The stews for fish succeed <num value="1">one</num> another, and feed <num value="1">one</num> the other, all paved at bottom. There is a good picture of the Blessed Virgin in <num value="1">one</num> of the parlours, seeming to be of Holbein or some good master. Then we saw the Haven, <num value="7">seven</num> miles from Harwich. The tide runs out every day, but the bedding being soft mud, it is safe for shipping and a station. The trade of Ipswich is for the most part Newcastle coals, with which they supply London; but it was formerly a clothing town. There is not any beggar asks alms in the whole place, a thing very extraordinary, so ordered by the prudence of the Magistrates. It has in it <num value="14">fourteen</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> beautiful churches: in a word, it is for building, cleanness, and good order, <num value="1">one</num> of the best towns in England. Cardinal Wolsey was a butcher's son of Ipswich, but there is little of that magnificent Prelate's foundation here, besides a school and I think a library, which I did not see. His intentions were to build some great thing. We returned late to Euston, having travelled about <num value="50">fifty</num> miles this day. 
<p>Since <num value="1">first</num> I was at this place, I found things exceedingly improved. It is seated in a bottom between <num value="2">two</num> graceful swellings, the main building being now in the figure of a Greek II with <num value="4">four</num> pavilions, <num value="2">two</num> at each corner, and a break in the front, railed and balustred at the top, where I caused huge jars to be placed full of earth to keep them steady upon their pedestals between the statues, which make as good a show as if they were of stone, and, though the building be of brick, and but <num value="2">two</num> stories besides cellars, and garrets covered with blue slate, yet there is room enough for a full court, the offices and outhouses being so ample and well disposed. The King's apartment is painted 
<hi rend=italics>a fresco</hi>, and magnificently furnished. There are many excellent pictures of the great masters. The gallery is a pleasant, noble room: in the break, or middle, is a billiardtable, but the wainscot, being of fir, and painted, does not please me so well as Spanish oak without paint. The chapel is pretty, the porch descending to the gardens. The orangegarden is very fine, and leads into the green-house, at the end of which is a hall to eat in, and the conservatory some <pb id="p.120" n="120"> 
<note place=marg>EUSTON,</note>
<num value="100">hundred</num> feet long, adorned with maps, as the other side is with the heads of the C&aelig;sars, ill cut in alabaster; above, are several apartments for my Lord, Lady, and Duchess,<note><p>His daughter, wife of the Duke of Grafton.</note>
with kitchens and other offices below, in a lesser form; lodgings for servants, all distinct, for them to retire to when they please, and would be in private, and have no communication with the palace, which he tells me he will wholly resign to his son-in-law and daughter, that charming young creature. 
<p>The canal running under my lady's dressing-room chamber window, is full of carps and fowl, which come and are fed there. The cascade at the end of the canal turns a cornmill, that provides the family, and raises water for the fountains and offices. To pass this canal into the opposite meadows. Sir Samuel Morland has invented a screw-bridge, which, being turned with a key, lands you <num value="50">fifty</num> feet distant at the entrance of an ascending walk of trees, a mile in length, as it is also on the front into the park, of <num value="4">four</num> rows of ash-trees, and reaches to the park-pale, which is <num value="9">nine</num> miles in compass, and the best for riding and meeting the game that I ever saw. There were now of red and fallow deer almost a <num value="1000">thousand</num>, with good covert, but the soil barren and flying sand, in which nothing will grow kindly. The tufts of fir, and much of the other wood, were planted by my direction, some years before. This seat is admirably placed for field-sports, hawking, hunting, or racing. The mutton is small, but sweet. The stables hold <num value="30">thirty</num> horses and <num value="4">four</num> coaches. The out-offices make <num value="2">two</num> large quadrangles, so as servants never lived with more ease and convenience; never master more civil. Strangers are attended and accommodated as at their home, in pretty apartments furnished with all manner of conveniences and privacy. 
<p>There is a library full of excellent books; bathing-rooms, elaboratory, dispensary, a decoy, and places to keep and fat fowl in. He had now in his new church (near the garden) built a dormitory, or vault, with several repositories, in which to bury his family. 
<p>In the expense of this pious structure, the church is most laudable, most of the Houses of God in this country resembling rather stables and thatched cottages than temples <pb id="p.121" n="121"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1677--"><year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>.</note>
in which to serve the Most High. He has built a lodge in the park for the keeper, which is a neat dwelling, and might become any gentleman. The same has he done for the parson, little deserving it for murmuring that my Lord put him some time out of his wretched hovel, whilst it was building. He has also erected a fair inn at some distance from his palace, with a bridge of stone over a river near it, and repaired all the tenants' houses, so as there is nothing but neatness and accommodations about his estate, which I yet think is not above <datestruct value="1500--"><year reg="1500">1500</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> a year. I believe he had now in his family <num value="100">one hundred</num> domestic servants. 
<p>His lady (being <num value="1">one</num> of the Brederode's daughters, grandchild to a natural son of Henry Frederick, Prince of Orange) is a good-natured and obliging woman. They love fine things, and to live easily, pompously, and hospitably; but, with so vast expense, as plunges my Lord into debts exceedingly. My Lord himself is given into no expensive vice but building, and to have all things rich, polite, and princely. He never plays, but reads much, having the Latin, French, and Spanish tongues in perfection. He has travelled much, and is the best-bred and courtly person his Majesty has about him, so as the public Ministers more frequent him than any of the rest of the Nobility. Whilst he was Secretary of State and Prime Minister, he had gotten vastly, but spent it as hastily, even before he had established a fund to maintain his greatness; and now beginning to decline in favour (the Duke being no great friend of his), he knows not how to retrench. He was son of a Doctor of Laws, whom I have seen, and, being sent from Westminster School to Oxford, with intention to be a divine, and parson of Arlington,<note><p>In Lord Clarendon's <hi rend=italics>Continuation of his Life</hi> will be found the mention of a curious circumstance relating to Sir Henry Bennett's taking his title, when <num value="1">first</num> created a Baron, from this place.</note> a village near Brentford, when Master of Arts, the Rebellion falling out, he followed the King's Army, and receiving an <hi rend=italics>honourable wound in the face</hi>,<note><p>A deep cut across his nose.

<note place=marg>RUSTON,</note>
time, during which the King married his natural son, the Duke of Grafton, to his only daughter and heiress, as before mentioned, worthy for her beauty and virtue of the greatest Prince in Christendom. My Lord is, besides this, a prudent and understanding person in business, and speaks well; unfortunate yet in those he has advanced, most of them proving ungrateful. The many obligations and civilities I have received from this noble gentleman, extracts from me this character, and I am sorry he is in no better circumstances. 
<p>Having now passed near <num value="3">three</num> weeks at Euston, to my great satisfaction, with much difficulty he suffered me to look homeward, being very earnest with me to stay longer; and, to engage me, would himself have carried me to Lynn- Regis, a town of important traffic, about <num value="20">twenty</num> miles beyond, which I had never seen; as also the Travelling Sands, about <num value="10">ten</num> miles wide of Euston, that have so damaged the country, rolling from place to place, and, like the Sands in the Deserts of Lybia, quite overwhelmed some gentlemen's whole estates, as the relation extant in print, and brought to our Society, describes at large. 
<p><num value="13">13</num><hi rend=italics>th September.</hi> My Lord's coach conveyed me to Bury, and thence baiting at Newmarket, stepping in at Audley- End to see that house again, I slept at Bishop-Stortford; and, the next day, home.

There are some good pictures, especially that incomparable painting of Holbein's, where the Duke of Norfolk, Charles Brandon, and Henry VIII., are dancing with the <num value="3">three</num> ladies, with most amorous countenances, and sprightly motion exquisitely expressed.

My Lord leading me about the house made no scruple of showing me all the hiding-places for the Popish priests, and where they said mass, for he was no bigoted Papist. He told me he never trusted them with any secret, and used Protestants only in all businesses of importance. 
<p>I went this evening with my Lord Duke to Windsor, where was a magnificent Court, it being the <num value="1">first</num> time of his Majesty removing thither since it was repaired. 
<p><num value="27">27</num><hi rend=italics>th August.</hi> I took leave of the Duke, and dined at Mr. Henry Bruncker's, at the Abbey of Sheene, formerly a Monastery of Carthusians, there yet remaining <num value="1">one</num> of their solitary cells with a cross. Within this ample enclosure are several pretty villas and fine gardens of the most excellent fruits, especially Sir William Temple's (lately Ambassador into Holland), and the Lord Lisle's, son to the Earl of Leicester, who has divers rare pictures, above all, that of Sir Brian Tuke's, by Holbein. 
<p>After dinner, I walked to Ham, to see the house and garden of the Duke of Lauderdale, which is indeed inferior to few of the best villas in Italy itself; the house furnished like a great Prince's; the parterres, flower-gardens, orangeries, groves, avenues, courts, statues, perspectives, fountains, aviaries, and all this at the banks of the sweetest river in the world, must needs be admirable. 
<p>Hence, I went to my worthy friend, Sir Henry Capel, [at Kew] brother to the Earl of Essex; it is an old timber-house; but his garden has the choicest fruit of any plantation in England, as he is the most industrious and understanding in it.

lating that I would suffer the Herald's chief officer, Sir William Dugdale, to have such of them as concerned Heraldry and the Marshal's office, books of Armory and Genealogies, the Duke being Earl Marshal of England. I procured for our Society, besides printed books, near <num value="100">one hundred</num> MSS., some in Greek of great concernment. The printed books being of the oldest impressions, are not the less valuable; I esteem them almost equal to MSS. Amongst them, are most of the Fathers, printed at Basil, before the Jesuits abused them with their expurgatory Indexes; there is a noble MS. of Vitruvius. Many of these books had been presented by Popes, Cardinals, and great persons, to the Earls of Arundel and Dukes of Norfolk; and the late magnificent Earl of Arundel bought a noble library in Germany, which is in this collection. I should not, for the honour I bear the family, have persuaded the Duke to part with these, had I not seen how negligent he was of them, suffering the priests and everybody to carry away and dispose of what they pleased; so that abundance of rare things are irrecoverably gone. 
<p>Having taken order here, I went to the Royal Society to give them an account of what I had procured, that they might call a Council and appoint a day to wait on the Duke to thank him for this munificent gift.

but of none in the world more than of myself, who lost the most excellent and inestimable friend that ever lived. Never was a more virtuous and inviolable friendship; never a more religious, discreet, and admirable creature, beloved of all, admired of all, for all possible perfections of her sex. She is gone to receive the reward of her signal charity, and all other her Christian graces, too blessed a creature to converse with mortals, fitted as she was, by a most holy life, to be received into the mansions above. She was for wit, beauty, goodnature, fidelity, discretion, and all accomplishments, the most incomparable person. How shall I ever repay the obligations to her for the infinite good offices she did my soul by so often engaging me to make religion the terms and tie of the friendship there was between us! She was the best wife, the best mistress, the best friend, that ever husband had. But it is not here that I pretend to give her character,

<p>Her husband, struck with unspeakable affliction, fell down as dead. The King himself, and all the Court, expressed their sorrow. To the poor and miserable, her loss was irreparable; for there was no degree but had some obligation to her memory. So careful and provident was she to be prepared for all possible accidents, that (as if she foresaw her end) she received the heavenly viaticum but the Sunday before, after a most solemn recollection. She put all her domestic concerns into the exactest order, and left a letter directed to her husband, to be opened in case she died in child-bed, in which with the most pathetic and endearing expressions of the most loyal and virtuous wife, she begs his kindness to her memory might be continued by his care and esteem of those she left behind, even to her domestic servants, to the meanest of which she left considerable legacies, as well as to the poor. It was now <num value="7">seven</num> years since she was Maid of Honour to the Queen, that she regarded me as a father, a brother, and what is more, a friend. We often prayed, visited the sick and miserable, received, read, discoursed, and communicated in all holy offices together. She was most dear to my wife, and affectionate to my children. But she is gone! This only is my comfort, that she is happy in Christ, and I shall shortly behold <pb id="p.132" n="132">

So afflicted was her husband at this severe loss, that the entire care of her funeral was committed to me. Having closed the eyes, and dropped a tear upon the cheek of my dear departed friend, lovely even in death, I caused her corpse to be embalmed and wrapped in lead, a plate of brass soldered thereon, with an inscription, and other circumstances due to her worth, with as much diligence and care as my grieved heart would permit me; I then retired home for <num value="2">two</num> days, which were spent in solitude and sad reflection.

I went as far as Hounslow with a sad heart; but was obliged to return upon some indispensable affairs. The corpse was ordered to be taken out of the hearse every night, and decently placed in the house, with tapers about it, and her servants attending, to Cornwall; and then was honourably interred in the parish church of Godolphin.

(Wood's <hi rend=italics>Athen. Oxon.</hi> vol. ii. p. <num value="502">502</num>.) Evelyn speaks of the last of these translations as having been executed by his desire: and it figures in a notable passage of Oates's testimony. Oates said, for example, &ldquo;that Thomas Whitbread, a priest, on <datestruct VALUE="-06-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, <num value="16">16</num> . . did tell the rector of St. Omer's that a Minister of the Church of England had scandalously put out the <hi rend=italics>Jesuits' Morals</hi> in English, and had endeavoured to render them odious, and had asked the Rector whether he thought Oates might know him? and the Rector called the deponent, who heard these words as he stood at the chamberdoor, and when he went into the chamber of the Provincial, he asked him &lsquo;If he knew the author of the Jesuits' Morals?&rsquo; deponent answered, &lsquo;His person, but not his name.&rsquo; Whitbread then demanded, whether he would undertake to poison, or assassinate the author; which deponent undertook, having <measure value="50l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50">50</num></measure> reward promised him, and appointed to return to England.&rdquo;</note> <hi rend=italics>which last I knew, being the translator of the &ldquo;Jesuits' Morals;&rdquo;</hi> I went to see and converse with him at Whitehall, with Mr. Oates, <num value="1">one</num> that was lately an apostate to the church of Rome, and now returned again with this discovery. He seemed to be a bold man, and, in my thoughts, furiously indiscreet; but everybody believed what he said; and it quite changed the genius and motions of the Parliament, growing now corrupt and interested with long sitting and court practices; but, with all this, Popery would not go down. This discovery turned them all as <num value="1">one</num> man against it, and nothing was done but to find out the depth of this. Oates was encouraged, and everything he affirmed taken for gospel;&mdash;the truth is, the Roman Catholics were exceeding bold and busy everywhere, since the Duke forbore to go any longer to the chapel. <pb id="p.134" n="134">

He probably thought to gratify some who would have been glad his Majesty should have married a fruitful lady; but the King was too kind a husband to let any of these make impression on him. However, divers of the Popish peers were sent to the Tower, accused by Oates; and all the Roman Catholic lords were by a new Act for ever excluded the Parliament; which was a mighty blow.

<p>There was now brought up to London a child, son of <num value="1">one</num> Mr. Wotton,<note><p>The Rev. Henry Wotton, minister of Wrentham, in Suffolk. This son was afterwards the celebrated William Wotton, the friend and defender of Dr. Bentley, and the antagonist of Sir William Temple, in the great Controversy about Ancient and Modern Learning. His early and extraordinary proficiency in letters, and general knowledge of every kind, was commemorated by his father in a pamphlet &ldquo;On the Education of Children,&rdquo; addressed to King Charles II., and reprinted in <datestruct value="1753--"><year reg="1753">1753</year></datestruct>, with the attestations of several learned men who had examined him, to the truth of his uncommon abilities and wonderful acquisitions in the different languages, both ancient and modern. Nevertheless these eminent qualifications did not advance him in the line of his profession beyond a Fellowship at Cambridge, and the country parsonage of Milton, in Buckhinghamshire, which was given him by the Earl of Nottingham, to whom he had been chaplain. Sir Philip Skippon, who lived at Wrentham, in Suffolk, in a letter to Mr. John Ray, <datestruct VALUE="1671-09-18"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=18>18</day>, <year reg=1671>1671</year></datestruct>, writes: &ldquo;I shall somewhat surprise you with what I have seen in a little boy, William Wotton, <num value="5">five</num> years old last month, son of Mr. Wotton, minister of this parish, who hath instructed his child within the last <num value="3">three</num> quarters of a year in the reading the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages, which he can read almost as well as English, and that tongue he could read at <num value="4">four</num> years and <num value="3">three</num> months old, as well as most lads of twice his age.&rdquo; Sir Philip left also a draft of a longer letter to Mr. Ray, in which he adds, &ldquo;He is not yet able to parse any language, but what he performs in turning the <num value="3">three</num> learned tongues into English is done by strength of memory, so that he is ready to mistake when some words of different signification have near the same sound.

Dr. Burnet, Bishop of Sarum, recommended him to Dr. Lloyd, Bishop of St. Asaph, who took him as an assistant in making a catalogue of his books, and carried him to St. Asaph, and gave him the sinecure of Llandrillo, in Denbighshire. Swift laughed at him, but this he drew upon himself by having attacked the author of the <hi rend=italics>Tale of a Tub.</hi> He published, as is well known, an answer to that great satire.

of Winton, who both read and perfectly understood Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Arabie, Syriac, and most of the modern languages; disputed in divinity, law, and all the sciences; was skilful in history, both ecclesiastical and profane; in politics; in a word, so universally and solidly learned at <num value="11">eleven</num> years of age, that he was looked on as a miracle. Dr. Lloyd, <num value="1">one</num> of the most deep learned divines of this nation in all sorts of literature, with Dr. Burnet, who had severely examined him, came away astonished, and they told me they did not believe there had the like appeared in the world. He had only been instructed by his father, who being himself a learned person, confessed that his son knew all that he himself knew. But, what was more admirable than his vast memory, was his judgment and invention, he being tried with divers hard questions, which required maturity of thought and experience. He was also dexterous in chronology, antiquities, mathematics. In sum, an <hi rend=italics>intellectus universalis</hi>, beyond all that we read of Picus Mirandula, and other precocious wits, and yet withal a very humble child.

The Bench was crowded with the Judges, Lord Mayor Justices, and <pb id="p.140" n="140"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
innumerable spectators. The chief accusers, Dr. Oates (as he called himself), and <num value="1">one</num> Bedlow, a man of inferior note. Their testimonies were not so pregnant, and I fear much of it from hearsay, but swearing positively to some particulars, which drew suspicion upon their truth; nor did circumstances so agree, as to give either the Bench, or Jury, so entire satisfaction as was expected. After, therefore, a long and tedious trial of <num value="9">nine</num> hours, the Jury brought them in not guilty, to the extraordinary triumph of the Papists, and without sufficient disadvantage and reflections on witnesses, especially Oates and Bedlow. 
<p>This was a happy day for the Lords in the Tower, who expecting their trial, had this gone against the prisoners at the bar, would all have been in the utmost hazard. For my part, I look on Oates as a vain, insolent man, puffed up with the favour of the Commons for having discovered something really true, more especially as detecting the dangerous intrigue of Coleman, proved out of his own letters, and of a general design which the Jesuited party of the Papists ever had and still have, to ruin the Church of England; but that he was trusted with those great secrets he pretended, or had any solid ground for what he accused divers noblemen of, I have many reasons to induce my contrary belief. That among so many commissions as he affirmed to have delivered to them from P. Oliva<note><p>Padr&egrave; Oliva, General of the Order of Jesuits.</note> and the Pope,&mdash;he who made no scruple of opening all other papers, letters, and secrets, should not only not open any of those pretended commissions, but not so much as take any copy or witness of any <num value="1">one</num> of them, is almost miraculous. But the commons (some leading persons I mean of them) had so exalted him, that they took all he said for Gospel, and without more ado ruined all whom he named to be conspirators; nor did he spare whoever came in his way. But indeed the murder of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey, suspected to have been compassed by the Jesuits' party for his intimacy with Coleman (a busy person whom I also knew), and the fear they had that he was able to have discovered things to their prejudice, did so exasperate not only the Commons but all the nation, that much of these sharpnesses against the more <pb id="p.141" n="141">

Though it was not my custom or delight to be often present at any capital trials, we having them commonly so exactly published by those who take them in short-hand, yet I was inclined to be at this signal <num value="1">one</num>, that by the ocular view of the carriages and other circumstances of the managers and parties concerned, I might inform myself, and regulate my opinion of a cause that had so alarmed the whole nation.

The grots in the chalky rocks are pretty: it is a romantic object, and the place altogether answers the most poetical description that can be made of solitude, precipice, prospect, or whatever can contribute to a thing so very like their imaginations. The stand, somewhat like Frascati as to its front, and on the platform is a circular view to the utmost verge of the horizon, which, with the serpenting of the Thames, is admirable. The staircase is for its materials singular; the cloisters, descents, gardens, and avenue through the wood, august and <pb id="p.142" n="142">

stately; but the land all about wretchedly barren, and producing nothing but fern. Indeed, as I told his Majesty that evening (asking me how I liked Clifden) without flattery, that it did not please me so well as Windsor for the prospect and park, which is without compare; there being but <num value="1">one</num> only opening, and that narrow, which led <num value="1">one</num> to any variety, whereas that of Windsor is everywhere great and unconfined. 
<p>Returning, I called at my cousin Evelyn's, who has a very pretty seat in the forest, <num value="2">two</num> miles by hither Clifden, on a flat, with gardens exquisitely kept, though large, and the house a staunch good old building, and what was singular, some of the rooms floored dove-tail-wise without a nail, exactly close. <num value="1">One</num> of the closets is pargetted with plain deal, set in diamond, exceeding staunch and pretty.

<p><num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Dined at the Countess of Sunderland's, and was this evening at the re-marriage of the Duchess of Grafton to the Duke (his Majesty's natural son), she being now <num value="12">twelve</num> years old. The ceremony was performed in my Lord Chamberlain's (her father's) lodgings at Whitehall by the Bishop of Rochester, his Majesty being present. A sudden and unexpected thing, when everybody believed the <num value="1">first</num> marriage would have come to nothing; but, the measure being determined, I was privately invited by my Lady, her mother, to be present. I confess I could give her little joy, and so I plainly told her, but she said the King would have it so, and there was no going back. This sweetest, hopefullest, most beautiful child, and most virtuous too, was sacrificed to a boy that had been rudely bred, without anything to encourage them but his Majesty's pleasure. I pray <pb id="p.144" n="144"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
God the sweet child find it to her advantage, who, it my augury deceive me not, will in few years be such a paragon as were fit to make the wife of the greatest Prince in Europe! I staid supper, where his Majesty sat between the Duchess of Cleveland (the mother of the Duke of Grafton) and the sweet Duchess the bride; there were several great persons and ladies, without pomp. My love to my Lord Arlington's family and the sweet child made me behold all this with regret, though as the Duke of Grafton affects the sea, to which I find his father intends to use him, he may emerge a plain, useful and robust officer; and, were he polished, a tolerable person; for he is exceeding handsome, by far surpassing any of the King's other natural issue.

This Lord Mayor's acquaintance had been from the time of his being apprentice to <num value="1">one</num> Mr. Abbot, his uncle,<note><p>The Lord Mayor was now Sir Robert Clayton. See <hi rend=italics>an<*></hi>, pp. <num value="115">115</num>, <num value="116">116</num>, and <hi rend=italics>note.</hi></note> who being a scrivener, and an honest worthy man, <num value="1">one</num> who was condemned to die at the beginning of the troubles <num value="40">forty</num> years past, as concerned in the commission of array for King Charles I. had escaped with his life; I often used his assistance in money-matters. Robert Clayton, then a boy, his nephew, became, after his uncle Abbot's death, so prodigiously rich and opulent, that he was reckoned <num value="1">one</num> of the wealthiest citizens. He married a free-hearted woman, who became his hospitable disposition; and, having no children, with the accession of his partner and fellow apprentice,<note><p>Mr. Morris.</note> who also left him his estate, he grew excessively rich. He was a discreet magistrate, and though envied, I think without much cause. Some believed him guilty of hard dealing, especially with the Duke of Buckingham, much of whose estate he had swallowed, but I never saw any ill by him, considering the trade he was of. The reputation and known integrity of his uncle, Abbot, brought <pb id="p.145" n="145"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1679--"><year reg="1679">1679</year></datestruct>.</note>
all the royal party to him, by which he got not only great credit, but vast wealth, so as he passed this office with infinite magnificence and honour. 
<p><num value="20">20</num><hi rend=italics>th November.</hi> I dined with Mr. Slingsby, Master of the Mint, with my wife, invited to hear music, which was exquisitely performed by <num value="4">four</num> of the most renowned masters: Du Prue, a Frenchman, on the lute; Signor Bartholomeo, an Italian, on the harpsichord; Nicholao on the violin; but, above all, for its sweetness and novelty, the <hi rend=italics>viol d&lsquo;amore</hi> of <num value="5">five</num> wire strings played on with a bow, being but an ordinary violin, played on lyre way, by a German. There was also a <hi rend=italics>flute douce</hi>, now in much request for accompanying the voice. Mr. Slingsby, whose son and daughter played skilfully, had these meetings frequently in his house. 
<p><num value="21">21</num><hi rend=italics>st.</hi> I dined at my Lord Mayor's, to accompany my worthiest and generous friend, the Earl of Ossory; it was on a Friday, a private day, but the feast and entertainment might have become a King. Such an hospitable costume and splendid magistrature does no city in the world show, as I believe. 
<p><num value="23">23</num><hi rend=italics>rd.</hi> Dr. Allestree preached before the household on St. Luke, xi. <num value="2">2</num>; Dr. Lloyd on Matt. xxiii. <num value="20">20</num>, before the King, showing with how little reason the Papists applied those words of our blessed Saviour to maintain the pretended infallibility they boast of. I never heard a more Christian and excellent discourse; yet were some offended that he seemed to say the Church of Rome was a true church; but it was a captious mistake; for he never affirmed anything that could be more to their reproach, and that such was the present Church of Rome, showing how much it had erred. There was not in this sermon so much as a shadow for censure, no person of all the clergy having testified greater zeal against the errors of the Papists than this pious and most learned person. I dined at the Bishop of Rochester's, and then went to St. Paul's, to hear that great wit, Dr. Sprat, now newly succeeding Dr. Outram, in the cure of St. Margaret's. His talent was, a great memory, never making use of notes, a readiness of expression in a most pure and plain style of words, full of matter, easily delivered.

This Duke, whom for distinction they called the Protestant Duke (though the son of an abandoned woman), the people made their idol. 
<p><num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>th December.</hi> I dined, together with Lord Ossory and the Earl of Chesterfield, at the Portugal Ambassador's, now newly come, at Cleveland House, a noble palace, too good for that infamous . . . . . The staircase is sumptuous, and the gallery and garden; but, above all, the costly furniture belonging to the Ambassador, especially the rich Japan cabinets, of which I think there were a dozen. There was a billiard table, with as many more hazards as ours commonly have; the game being only to prosecute the ball till hazarded, without passing the port, or touching the pin; if <num value="1">one</num> miss hitting the ball every time, the game is lost, or if hazarded. It is more difficult to hazard a ball, though so many, than in our table, by reason the bound is made so exactly even, and the edges not stuffed; the balls are also bigger, and they for the most part use the sharp and small end of the billiardstick, which is shod with brass, or silver. The entertainment was exceeding civil; but, besides a good olio, the dishes were trifling, hashed and condited after their way, not at all fit for an English stomach, which is for solid meat. There was yet good fowls, but roasted to coal, nor were the sweetmeats good.

<p><num value="18">18</num><hi rend=italics>th April.</hi> On the earnest invitation of the Earl of Essex, I went with him to his house at Cashiobury, in Hertfordshire. It was on Sunday, but going early from his house in the square of St. James, we arrived by <num value="10">ten</num> o'clock; this he thought too late to go to church, and we had prayers in his chapel. The house is new, a plain fabric, built by my friend, Mr. Hugh May. There are divers fair and good rooms, and excellent earving by Gibbon, especially the chimney-piece of the library. There is in the porch, or entrance, a painting by Verrio, of Apollo and the Liberal Arts. <num value="1">One</num> room pargetted with yew, which I liked well. Some of the chimney mantels are of Irish marble, brought by my Lord from Ireland, when he was Lord Lieutenant, and not much inferior to Italian. The tympanum, or gable, at the front is a bass-relievo of Diana hunting, cut in Portland stone, handsomely enough. I do not approve of the middle doors being round: but, when the hall is finished as designed, it being an oval with a cupola, together with the other wing, it will be a very noble palace. The library is large, and very nobly furnished, and all the books are richly bound and gilded; but there are no MSS., except the Parliament Rolls and Journals, the transcribing and binding of which cost him, as he assured me, <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure>. 
<p>No man has been more industrious than this noble Lord in planting about his seat, adorned with walks, ponds, and other rural elegancies; but the soil is stony, churlish, and uneven, nor is the water near enough to the house, though a very swift and clear stream run within a flight-shot from it in the valley, which may fitly be called Coldbrook, it being indeed excessive cold, yet producing fair trouts. It is pity the house was not situated to more advantage: but it seems it was built just where the old <num value="1">one</num> was, which I believe he only meant to repair; this leads men into irremediable errors, and saves but a little. 
<p>The land about is exceedingly addicted to wood, but the coldness of the place hinders the growth. Black cherrytrees prosper even to considerable timber, some being <num value="80">eighty</num> feet long; they make also very handsome avenues. There is a pretty oval at the end of a fair walk, set about with treble rows of Spanish chesnut-trees. 
<p>The gardens are very rare, and cannot be otherwise, <pb id="p.149" n="149">

<p>As for my Lord, he is a sober, wise, judicious, and ponder ing person, not illiterate beyond the rate of most noblemen in this age, very well versed in English History and affairs, industrious, frugal, methodical, and every way accomplished. His Lady (being sister of the late Earl of Northumberland) is a wise, yet somewhat melancholy woman, setting her heart too much on the little lady, her daughter, of whom she is over fond. They have a hopeful son at the Academy. 
<p>My Lord was not long since come from his Lord- Lieutenancy of Ireland, where he showed his abilities in administration and government, as well as prudence in considerably augmenting his estate without reproach. He had been Ambassador Extraordinary in Denmark, and, in a word, such a person as became the son of that worthy hero his father to be, the late Lord Capel, who lost his life for King Charles I. 
<p>We spent our time in the mornings in walking, or riding, and contriving [alterations], and the afternoons in the library, so as I passed my time for <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> days with much satisfaction.

I held up the pall with <num value="3">three</num> knights, who did him that honour, and he was worthy of it. It was the custom of this good man to rise in the night, and to pray, kneeling in his own coffin, which he had lying by him for many years.

He is very simple, ignorant, but honest and loyal creature. 
<p>We all dined at the Countess of Sunderland's, afterwards to see Signor Verrio's garden, thence to Eton College, to salute the Provost, and heard a Latin speech of <num value="1">one</num> of the Alumni (it being at the election) and were invited to supper; but took our leave, and got to London that night in good time.

privy gallery, calling to me, told me he was now going his journey (meaning to Tangier, whither he was designed Governor, and General of the forces, to regain the losses we had lately sustained from the Moors, when Inchiquin was Governor). I asked if he would not call at my house (as he always did whenever he went out of England on any exploit). He said he must embark at Portsmouth, &ldquo;wherefore let you and I dine together to-day; I am quite alone, and have something to impart to you; I am not well, shall be private, and desire your company.&rdquo; 
<p>Being retired to his lodgings, and set down on a couch, he sent to his secretary for the copy of a letter which he had written to Lord Sunderland (Secretary of State), wishing me to read it; it was to take notice how ill he resented it, that he should tell the King before Lord Ossory's face, that Tangier was not to be kept, but would certainly be lost, and yet added that it was fit Lord Ossory should be sent, that they might give some account of it to the world, meaning (as supposed) the next Parliament, when all such miscarriages would probably be examined; this Lord Ossory took very ill of Lord Sunderland, and not kindly of the King, who resolving to send him with an incompetent force, seemed, as his Lordship took it, to be willing to cast him away, not only on a hazardous adventure, but in most men's opinion, an impossibility, seeing there was not to be above <num value="300">300</num> or <num value="400">400</num> horse, and <num value="4000">4000</num> foot for the garrison and all, both to defend the town, form a camp, repulse the enemy, and fortify what ground they should get in. This touched my Lord deeply, that he should be so little considered as to put him on a business in which he should probably not only lose his reputation, but be charged with all the miscarriage and ill success; whereas, at <num value="1">first</num> they promised <num value="6000">6000</num> foot and <num value="600">600</num> horse effective. 
<p>My Lord, being an exceeding brave and valiant person, and who had so approved himself in divers signal battles, both at sea and land; so beloved and so esteemed by the people, as <num value="1">one</num> they depended on, upon all occasions worthy of such a captain;&mdash;he looked on this as too great an indifference in his Majesty, after all his services, and the merits of his father, the Duke of Ormond, and a design of some who envied his virtue. It certainly took so deep root <pb id="p.152" n="152"> 
<note place=marg>DEPTFORD,</note>
in his mind, that he who was the most void of fear in the world (and assured me he would go to Tangier with <num value="10">ten</num> men if his Majesty commanded him) could not bear up against this unkindness. Having disburdened himself of this to me after dinner, he went with his Majesty to the Sheriffs at a great supper in Fishmongers' Hall; but, finding himself ill, took his leave immediately of his Majesty, and came back to his lodging. Not resting well this night, he was persuaded to remove to Arlington House, for better accommodation. His disorder turned to a malignant fever, which increasing, after all that <num value="6">six</num> of the most able physicians could do, he became delirious, with intervals of sense, during which Dr. Lloyd (after Bishop of St. Asaph) administered the Holy Sacrament, of which I also participated. He died the Friday following, the <datestruct VALUE="-07-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, to the universal grief of all that knew or heard of his great worth, nor had any a greater loss than myself. Oft would he say I was the oldest acquaintance he had in England (when his father was in Ireland), it being now of about <num value="30">thirty</num> years, contracted abroad, when he rode in the Academy in Paris, and when we were seldom asunder. 
<p>His Majesty never lost a worthier subject, nor father a better or more dutiful son; a loving, generous, good-natured, and perfectly obliging friend; <num value="1">one</num> who had done innumerable kindnesses to several before they knew it; nor did he ever advance any that were not worthy; no <num value="1">one</num> more brave, more modest; none more humble, sober, and every way virtuous. Unhappy England in this illustrious person's loss! Universal was the mourning for him, and the eulogies on him; I staid night and day by his bedside to his last gasp, to close his dear eyes! O sad father, mother, wife, and children! What shall I add? He deserved all that a sincere friend, a brave soldier, a virtuous courtier, a loyal subject, an honest man, a bountiful master, and good Christian, could deserve of his prince and country. <num value="1">One</num> thing more let me note, that he often expressed to me the abhorrence he had of that base and unworthy action which he was put upon, of engaging the Smyrna fleet in time of peace, in which though he behaved himself like a great captain, yet he told me it was the only blot in his life, and troubled him exceedingly. Though he was commanded, <pb id="p.153" n="153">

Sir Joseph Hoskins and Sir Christopher Wren accompanied me. We found him at his lodgings in his Eastern habit, a very handsome person, extremely affable, a modest, well-bred man, not inclined to talk wonders. He spake Latin, and understood Greek, Arabic, and Persian, from <num value="11">eleven</num> years' travels in those parts, whither he went in search of jewels, and was become very rich. He seemed about <num value="36">36</num> years of age. After the usual civilities, we asked some account of the extraordinary things he must have seen in travelling over land to those places where few, if any, northern Europeans, used to go, as the Black and Caspian Sea, Mingrelia, Bagdat, Nineveh, Persepolis, &amp;c. He told us that the things most worthy of our sight would be, the draughts he had caused to be made of some noble ruins, &amp;c.; for that, besides his own little talent that way, he had carried <num value="2">two</num> good painters with him, to draw landscapes, measure and design the remains of the palace which Alexander burnt in his frolic at Persepolis, with divers temples, columns, relievos, and statues, yet extant, which he affirmed to be sculpture far exceeding anything he had observed either at Rome, in Greece, or in any other part of the world where magnificence was in estimation. He said there was an inscription in letters not intelligible, though entire. He was sorry he could not gratify the curiosity of the Society at present, his things not being yet out of the ship; but would wait on them with them on his return from Paris, <pb id="p.154" n="154"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
whither he was going the next day, but with intention to return suddenly, and stay longer here, the persecution in France not suffering Protestants, and he was <num value="1">one</num>, to be quiet. 
<p>He told us that Nineveh was a vast city, now all buried in her ruins, the inhabitants building on the subterranean vaults, which were, as appeared, the <num value="1">first</num> stories of the old city;<note><p>See 
<hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, pp. <num value="95">95</num>, <num value="96">96</num>.</note> that there were frequently found huge vases of fine earth, columns, and other antiquities; that the straw which the Egyptians required of the Israelites, was not to burn, or cover the rows of bricks as we use, but being chopped small to mingle with the clay, which being dried in the sun (for they bake not in the furnaces) would else cleave asunder; that in Persia are yet a race of Ignicol&aelig;, who worship the sun and the fire as Gods; that the women of Georgia and Mingrelia were universally, and without any compare, the most beautiful creatures for shape, features, and figure, in the world, and therefore the Grand Seignor and Bashaws had had from thence most of their wives and concubines; that there had within these <num value="100">hundred</num> years been Amazons amongst them, that is to say, a sort or race of valiant women, given to war; that Persia was extremely fertile; he spoke also of Japan and China, and of the many great errors of our late geographers, as we suggested matter for discourse. We then took our leaves, failing of seeing his papers; but it was told us by others that indeed he durst not open, or show them, till he had <num value="1">first</num> showed them to the French King; but of this he himself said nothing. 
<p><num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>nd September.</hi> I had an opportunity, his Majesty being still at Windsor, of seeing his private library at Whitehall, at my full ease. I went with expectation of finding some curiosities, but, though there were about <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct> volumes, there were few of importance which I had not perused before. They consisted chiefly of such books as had from time to time been dedicated, or presented to him; a few histories, some Travels and French books, abundance of maps and sea charts, entertainments and pomps, buildings and pieces relating to the Navy, some mathematical instruments; but what was most rare, were <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> <pb id="p.155" n="155">

Romish breviaries, with a great deal of miniature and monkish painting and gilding, <num value="1">one</num> of which is most exquisitely done, both as to the figures, grotesques, and compartments, to the utmost of that curious art. There is another in which I find written by the hand of King Henry VII., his giving it to his dear daughter, Margaret, afterwards Queen of Scots, in which he desires her to pray for his soul, subscribing his name at length. There is also the process of the philosophers' great elixir, represented in divers pieces of excellent miniature, but the discourse is in high Dutch, a MS. There is another MS. in quarto, of above <num value="300">300</num> years old, in French, being an institution of physic, and in the botanical part the plants are curiously painted in miniature; also a folio MS. of good thickness, being the several exercises, as Themes, Orations, Translations, &amp;c., of King Edward VI., all written and subscribed by his own hand, and with his name very legible, and divers of the Greek interleaved and corrected after the manner of schoolboys' exercises, and that exceedingly well and proper; with some epistles to his preceptor, which show that young Prince to have been extraordinarily advanced in learning, and as Cardan, who had been in England affirmed, stupendously knowing for his age. There is likewise his Journal,<note><p>Several extracts from this journal are made by Burnet in his <hi rend=italics>History of the Reformation.</hi></note>
no less testifying his early ripeness and care about the affairs of state. 
<p>There are besides many pompous volumes, some embossed with gold, and intaglios on agates, medals, &amp;c. I spent <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> entire days, locked up, and alone, among these books and curiosities. In the rest of the private lodgings contiguous to this, are divers of the best pictures of the great masters, Raphael, Titian, &amp;c., and, in my esteem, above all, the <hi rend=italics>Noli me tangere</hi> of our Blessed Saviour to Mary Magdalen after his Resurrection, of Hans Holbein; than which I never saw so much reverence and kind of heavenly astonishment expressed in a picture.<note><p>Now, with other pictures mentioned in the course of this Diary, in the gallery at Hampton Court.</note>

<p><num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>th September.</hi> I dined with Sir Stephen Fox, now <num value="1">one</num> of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury. This gentleman came <num value="1">first</num> a poor boy from the choir of Salisbury, then he was taken notice of by Bishop Duppa, and afterwards waited on my Lord Perey (brother to Algernon Earl of Northumberland), who procured for him an inferior place amongst the Clerks of the Kitchen and Green-Cloth side, where he was found so humble, diligent, industrious, and prudent in his behaviour, that his Majesty being in exile, and Mr. Fox waiting, both the King and Lords about him frequently employed him about their affairs, and trusted him both with receiving and paying the little money they had. Returning with his Majesty to England, after great wants and great sufferings, his Majesty found him so honest and industrious, and withal so capable and ready, that, being advanced from Clerk of the Kitchen to that of the Green- Cloth, he procured to be Paymaster to the whole Army, and by his dexterity and punctual dealing he obtained such credit among the bankers, that he was in a short time able to borrow vast sums of them upon any exigence. The continual turning thus of money, and the soldiers' moderate allowance to him for keeping touch with them, did so enrich him, that he is believed to be worth at least <measure value="200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200000">200,000</num></measure>, honestly got and unenvied; which is next to a miracle. With all this he continues as humble and ready to do a courtesy as ever he was. 
<p>He is generous, and lives very honourably, of a sweet nature, well-spoken, well-bred, and is so highly in his Majesty's esteem, and so useful, that being long since made a knight, he is also advanced to be <num value="1">one</num> of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, and has the reversion of the Cofferer's place after Harry Brouncker. He has married his eldest daughter to my Lord Cornwallis, and gave her <measure value="12000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="12000">12,000</num></measure>, and restored that entangled family besides. He matched his son to Mrs. Trollop, who brings with her (besides a great sum) near, if not altogether, <measure value="2000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="2000">2000</num></measure> per annum. Sir Stephen's lady (an excellent woman) is sister to Mr. Whittle, <num value="1">one</num> of the King's chirurgeons. In a word, never was man <pb id="p.157" n="157"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>.</note>
more fortunate than Sir Stephen; he is a handsome person, virtuous, and very religious.<note><p>This notice of the founder of the peerages of Ilchester and Holland contains much that, quite apart from the nice details of genealogy, might sufficiently prove his kinship with the remarkable and genial representatives of those families in later times.</note>

<p><num value="23">23</num><hi rend=italics>rd September.</hi> Came to my house some German strangers and Signor Pietro, a famous musician, who had been long in Sweden in Queen Christina's Court; he sung admirably to a guitar, and had a perfect good tenor and base, and had set to Italian composure many of Abraham Cowley's pieces which showed extremely well. He told me that in Sweden the heat in some part of summer was as excessive as the cold in winter; so cold, he affirmed, that the streets of all the towns are desolate, no creatures stirring in them for many months, all the inhabitants retiring to their stoves. He spake high things of that romantic Queen's learning and skill in languages, the majesty of her behaviour, her exceeding wit, and that the histories she had read of other countries, especially of Italy and Rome, had made her despise her own. That the real occasion of her resigning her crown was the nobleman's importuning her to marry, and the promise which the Pope had made her of procuring her to be Queen of Naples, which also caused her to change her religion; but she was cheated by his crafty Holiness,<note><p>Pope Alexander VII. of the family of Chighi, at Sienna.</note> working on her ambition; that the reason of her killing her secretary at Fontainebleau, was, his revealing that intrigue with the Pope. But, after all this, I rather believe it was her mad prodigality and extreme vanity, which had consumed those vast treasures the great Adolphus, her father, had brought out of Germany during his [campaigns] there and wonderful successes; and that, if she had not voluntarily resigned, as foreseeing the event, the Estates of her kingdom would have compelled her to do so. 
<p><num value="30">30</num><hi rend=italics>th October.</hi> I went to London to be private, my birthday being the next day, and I now arrived at my sixtieth year; on which I began a more solemn survey of my whole life, in order to the making and confirming my peace with God, by an accurate scrutiny of all my actions past, as far as I was able to call them to mind. How difficult and un- <pb id="p.158" n="158">

certain, yet how necessary a work! The Lord be merciful to me, and accept me! Who can tell how oft he offendeth? Teach me, therefore, so to number my days, that I may apply my heart unto wisdom, and make my calling and election sure. Amen, Lord Jesus! 
<p><num value="31">31</num><hi rend=italics>st October.</hi> I spent this whole day in exercises. A stranger preached at Whitehall<note><p>Probably to the King's household, very early in the morning, as the custom was.</note> on Luke xvi. <num value="30">30</num>, <num value="31">31</num>. I then went to St. Martin's, where the Bishop of St. Asaph preached on <num value="1">1</num> Peter, iii. <num value="15">15</num>; the holy Communion followed, at which I participated, humbly imploring God's assistance in the great work I was entering into. In the afternoon, I heard Dr. Sprat, at St. Margaret's, on Acts, xvii. <num value="11">11</num>. 
<p>I began and spent the whole week in examining my life, begging pardon for my faults, assistance and blessing for the future, that I might, in some sort, be prepared for the time that now drew near, and not have the great work to begin, when <num value="1">one</num> can work no longer. The Lord Jesus help and assist me! I therefore stirred little abroad till the <datestruct VALUE="-11-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, when I heard Dr. Tenison, the now vicar of St. Martin's; Dr. Lloyd, the former incumbent, being made Bishop of St. Asaph. 
<p><num value="7">7</num><hi rend=italics>th November.</hi> I participated of the Blessed Communion, finishing and confirming my resolutions of giving myself up more entirely to God, to whom I had now most solemnly devoted the rest of the poor remainder of life in this world; the Lord enabling me, who am an unprofitable servant, a miserable sinner, yet depending on his infinite goodness and mercy accepting my endeavours. 
<p><num value="15">15</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Came to dine with us Sir Richard Anderson, his lady, son, and wife, sister to my daughter-in-law. 
<p><num value="30">30</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> The anniversary election at the Royal Society, brought me to London, where was chosen President that excellent person and great philosopher, Mr. Robert Boyle, who indeed ought to have been the very <num value="1">first</num>; but neither his infirmity nor his modesty could now any longer excuse him. I desired I might for this year be left out of the Council, by reason my dwelling was in the country. The Society according to custom dined together. 
<p>The signal day begun the trial (at which I was present) <pb id="p.159" n="159"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>.</note>
of my Lord Viscount Stafford, for conspiring the death of the King; <num value="2">second</num> son to my Lord Thomas Howard Earl of Arundel and Surrey, Earl Marshal of England, and grandfather to the present Duke of Norfolk, whom I so well knew, and from which excellent person I received so many favours. It was likewise his birthday. The trial was in Westminster-Hall, before the King, Lords, and Commons; just in the same manner as, <num value="40">forty</num> years past, the great and wise Earl of Strafford (there being but <num value="1">one</num> letter differing their names) received his trial for pretended ill government in Ireland, in the very same place, this Lord Stafford's father being then High-Steward. The place of sitting was now exalted some considerable height from the paved floor of the Hall, with a stage of boards. The throne, woolpacks for the Judges, long forms for the Peers, chair for the Lord Steward, exactly ranged, as in the House of Lords. The sides on both hands scaffolded to the very roof for the members of the House of Commons. At the upper end, and on the right side of the King's state, was a box for his Majesty, and on the left, others for the great ladies, and over head a gallery for ambassadors and public ministers. At the lower end, or entrance, was a bar, and place for the prisoner, the Lieutenant of the Tower of London, the axe-bearer and guards, my Lord Stafford's <num value="2">two</num> daughters, the Marchioness of Winchester being <num value="1">one</num>; there was likewise a box for my Lord to retire into. At the right hand, in another box, somewhat higher, stood the witnesses; at the left, the managers, in the name of the Commons of England, namely, Serjeant Maynard (the great lawyer, the same who prosecuted the cause against the Earl of Strafford <num value="40">forty</num> years before, being now near <num value="80">eighty</num> years of age), Sir William Jones, late Attorney-General, Sir Francis Winnington, a famous pleader, and Mr. Treby, now Recorder of London,<note><p>Afterwards Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and knighted. Sir George Treby was also member of Parliament for Plympton, in Devonshire, where he was born. He died in <datestruct value="1702--"><year reg="1702">1702</year></datestruct>.</note> not appearing in their gowns as lawyers, but in their cloaks and swords, as representing the Commons of England: to these were joined Mr. Hampden, Dr. Sacheverell, Mr. Poule, Colonel Titus, Sir Thomas Lee, all gentlemen of quality, and noted parliamentary men. The <num value="2">two</num> <num value="1">first</num> days, in which <pb id="p.160" n="160"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
were read the commission and impeachment, were but a tedious entrance into matter of fact, at which I was but little present. But, on Thursday, I was commodiously seated amongst the Commons, when the witnesses were sworn and examined. The principal witnesses were Mr. Oates (who called himself Dr.) Mr. Dugdale, and Turberville. Oates swore that he delivered a commission to Viscount Stafford from the Pope, to be Paymaster-General to an army intended to be raised;&mdash;Dugdale, that being at Lord Aston's, the prisoner dealt with him plainly to murder his Majesty; and Turberville, that at Paris he also proposed the same to him. 
<p><num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>rd December.</hi> The depositions of my Lord's witnesses were taken, to invalidate the King's witnesses; they were very slight persons, but, being <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="16">sixteen</num>, they took up all that day, and in truth they rather did my Lord injury than service. 
<p><num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Came other witnesses of the Commons to corroborate the King's, some being Peers, some Commons, with others of good quality, who took off all the former day's objections, and set the King's witnesses <hi rend=italics>recti in Curid.</hi>

<p><num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Sir William Jones summoned up the evidence; to him succeeded all the rest of the managers, and then Mr. Henry Poule made a vehement oration. After this my Lord, as on all occasions, and often during the trial, spoke in his own defence, denying the charge altogether, and that he had never seen Oates, or Turberville, at the time and manner affirmed: in truth, their testimony did little weigh with me; Dugdale's only seemed to press hardest, to which my Lord spake a great while, but confusedly, without any method. 
<p><num value="1">One</num> thing my Lord said as to Oates, which I confess did exceedingly affect me: That a person who during his depositions should so vauntingly brag that though he went over to the Church of Rome, yet he was never a Papist, nor of their religion, all the time that he seemed to apostatise from the Protestant, but only as a spy; though he confessed he took their sacrament, worshipped images, went through all their oaths, and discipline of their proselytes, swearing secrecy and to be faithful, but with intent <pb id="p.161" n="161"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>.</note>
to come over again and betray them;&mdash;that such an hypocrite, that had so deeply prevaricated as even to turn idolater (for so we of the Church of England termed it), attesting God so solemnly that he was entirely theirs and devoted to their interest, and consequently (as he pretended) trusted;&mdash;I say, that the witness of such a profligate wretch should be admitted against the life of a peer,&mdash; this my Lord looked upon as a monstrous thing, and such as must needs redound to the dishonour of our religion and nation. And verily I am of his Lordship's opinion: such a man's testimony should not be taken against the life of a dog. But the merit of something material which he discovered against Coleman, put him in such esteem with the Parliament, that now, I fancy, he stuck at nothing, and thought everybody was to take what he said for gospel. The consideration of this, and some other circumstances, began to stagger me; particularly how it was possible that <num value="1">one</num> who went among the Papists on such a design, and pretended to be intrusted with so many letters and commissions from the Pope and the party, nay and delivered them to so many great persons, should not reserve <num value="1">one</num> of them to show, nor so much as <num value="1">one</num> copy of any commission, which he who had such dexterity in opening letters might certainly have done, to the undeniable conviction of those whom he accused; but, as I said, he gained credit on Coleman. But, as to others whom he so madly flew upon, I am little inclined to believe his testimony, he being so slight a person, so passionate, ill-bred, and of such impudent behaviour; nor is it likely that such piercing politicians as the Jesuits should trust him with so high and so dangerous secrets. 
<p><num value="7">7</num><hi rend=italics>th December.</hi> On Tuesday, I was again at the trial, when judgment was demanded; and, after my Lord had spoken what he could in denying the fact, the managers answering the objections, the Peers adjourned to their House, and within <num value="2">two</num> hours returned again. There was, in the meantime, this question put to the judges, &ldquo;whether there being but <num value="1">one</num> witness to any single crime, or act, it could amount to convict a man of treason.&rdquo; They gave an unanimous opinion that in case of treason they all were overt acts, for though no man should be condemned by <num value="1">one</num> witness for any <num value="1">one</num> act, yet for several acts to the same intent, it was <pb id="p.162" n="162"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
valid; which was my Lord's case. This being past, and the Peers in their seats again, the Lord Chancellor Finch (this day the Lord High-Steward) removing to the woolsack next his Majesty's state, after summoning the Lieutenant of the Tower to bring forth his prisoner, and proclamation made for silence, demanded of every peer (who were in all <num value="86">eighty-six</num>) whether William, Lord Viscount Stafford, were guilty of the treason laid to his charge, or not guilty. 
<p>Then the Peer spoken to, standing up, and laying his right hand upon his breast, said Guilty, or Not guilty, upon my honour, and then sat down, the Lord Steward noting their suffrages as they answered upon a paper: when all had done, the number of Not guilty being but <num value="31">31</num>, the Guilty <num value="55">55</num>: and then, after proclamation for silence again, the Lord Steward directing his speech to the prisoner, against whom the axe was turned edgeways and not before, in aggravation of his crime, he being ennobled by the King's father, and since received many favours from his present Majesty: after enlarging on his offence, deploring <num value="1">first</num> his own unhappiness that he who had never condemned any man before should now be necessitated to begin with him, he then pronounced sentence of death by hanging, drawing, and quartering, according to form, with great solemnity and dreadful gravity; and, after a short pause, told the prisoner that he believed the Lords would intercede for the omission of some circumstances of his sentence, beheading only excepted; and then breaking his white staff, the Court was dissolved. My Lord Stafford during all this latter part spake but little, and only gave their Lordships thanks after the sentence was pronounced; and indeed behaved himself modestly, and as became him. 
<p>It was observed that all his own relations of his name and family condemned him, except his nephew, the Earl of Arundel, son to the Duke of Norfolk. And it must be acknowledged that the whole trial was carried on with exceeding gravity: so stately and august an appearance I had never seen before; for, besides the innumerable spectators of gentlemen and foreign ministers, who saw and heard all the proceedings, the prisoner had the consciences of all the Commons of England for his accusers, and all the <pb id="p.163" n="163"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>.</note>
Peers to be his Judges and Jury. He had likewise the assistance of what counsel he would, to direct him in his plea, who stood by him. And yet I can hardly think that a person of his age and experience should engage men whom he never saw before (and <num value="1">one</num> of them that came to visit him as a stranger at Paris) <hi rend=italics>point blank</hi> to murder the King: God only who searches hearts, can discover the truth. Lord Stafford was not a man beloved, especially of his own family. 
<p><num value="12">12</num><hi rend=italics>th December.</hi> This evening, looking out of my chamberwindow towards the west, I saw a meteor of an obscure bright colour, very much in shape like the blade of a sword, the rest of the sky very serene and clear.

I pray God avert his judgments! We have had of late several comets, which though I believe appear from natural causes, and of themselves operate not, yet I cannot despise them. They may be warnings from God, as they commonly are forerunners of his animadversions. After many days and nights of snow, cloudy and dark weather, the comet was very much wasted.

Though he was a learned man in polities, and an advocate, he was very ignorant in religion, and unable to defend any point of controversy; he was, however, far from being fierce. At parting, he earnestly wished me to apply humbly to the Blessed Virgin to direct me, assuring me that he had known divers who had been averse from the Roman Catholic religion, wonderfully enlightened and convinced by her intercession.

propose a match to Sir Stephen Fox for her son, Lord Spencer, to marry Mrs. Jane, Sir Stephen's daughter. I excused myself all I was able; for the truth is, I was afraid he would prove an extravagant man: for, though a youth of extraordinary parts, and had an excellent education to render him a worthy man, yet his early inclinations to extravagance made me apprehensive, that I should not serve Sir Stephen by proposing it, like a friend; this being now his only daughter, well-bred, and likely to receive a large share of her father's opulence. Lord Sunderland was much sunk in his estate by gaming and other prodigalities, and was now no longer Secretary of State, having fallen into displeasure of the King for siding with the Commons about the succession; but which, I am assured, he did not do out of his own inclination, or for the preservation of the Protestant religion; but by mistaking the ability of the party to carry it. However, so earnest and importunate was the Countess, that I did mention it to Sir Stephen, who said that it was too great an honour, that his daughter was very young as well as my Lord, and he was resolved never to marry her without the parties' mutual liking; with other objections which I neither would nor could contradict. He desired me to express to the Countess the great sense he had of the honour done him, that his daughter and her son were too young; that he would do nothing without her liking, which he did not think her capable of expressing judiciously, till she was <num value="16">sixteen</num> or <num value="17">seventeen</num> years of age, of which she now wanted <num value="4">four</num> years, and that I would put it off as civilly as I could.

What made it more remarkable was, that there was not anything save what his estate about it did afford; as venison, rabbits, hares, pheasants, partridges, pigeons, quails, poultry, all sorts of fowl in season from his own decoy near his house, and all sorts of fresh fish. After dinner, we went to see sport at the decoy, where I never saw so many herons. 
<p>The seat stands on a flat, the ground pasture, rarely watered, and exceedingly improved since Mr. Onslow bought it of Sir Robert Parkhurst, who spent a fair estate.

Methought, I saw old Cato, or Varro, in him; all substantial, all in exact order. The sole inconvenience he lies under, is the great quantity of sand which the stream brings along with it, and fills his canals and receptacles for fish too soon. The rest of my time of stay at Wotton was spent in walking about the grounds and goodly woods, where I have in my youth so often entertained my solitude; and so, on the <datestruct VALUE="-09-2"><day reg="2">2nd</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>, I once more returned to my home.

He acquainted me also with the whole story of that unfortunate lady being betrayed by her grandmother, the Countess of Northumberland, and Colonel Bret, for money; and that though, upon the importunity of the Duke of Monmouth, he had delivered to the grandmother a particular of the jointure which Mr. Thynn pretended he would settle on the lady, yet he totally discouraged the proceeding, as by no means a competent match for <num value="1">one</num> that both by birth and fortune might have pretended to the greatest prince in Christendom; that he also proposed the Earl of Kingston, or the Lord Cranburn, but was by no means for Mr. Thynn.<note><p>Thomas Thynne, Esq., of Longleat Hall, Wilts. He had married the young widow of Lord Ogle, but the marriage was never consummated; and he had previously seduced, under a promise of marriage, a young lady, who is said to have been in some way instrumental to his murder. Hence the burlesque epitaph: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Here lies Tom Thynne of Longleat Hall,

<p>Assuming the truth of what Lord Essex conveyed to Evelyn in the text, the inclinations of the wealthy heiress were not consulted in her union; and this may have given rise to the suspicion that she encouraged Count K&ouml;nigsmarke's addresses, and was privy to his murderous designs upon her husband.</note>

in the Banqueting-house, both their Majesties being present He came up to the throne without making any sort of reverence, not bowing his head, or body. He spake by a renegado Englishman, for whose safe return there was a promise. They were all clad in the Moorish habit, cassocks of coloured cloth, or silk, with buttons and loops, over this an <hi rend=italics>alhaga</hi>, or white woollen mantle, so large as to wrap both head and body, a sash, or small turban, naked-legged and armed, but with leather socks like the Turks, rich scymitar, and large calico sleeved shirts. The Ambassador had a string of pearls oddly woven in his turban. I fancy the old Roman habit was little different as to the mantle and naked limbs. He was a handsome person, well-featured, of a wise look, subtle, and extremely civil. Their presents were lions and ostriches;<note><p>Sir John Reresby informs us in his <hi rend=italics>Memoirs</hi>, &ldquo;that the Ambassador's present consisted of <num value="2">two</num> lions and <num value="30">thirty</num> ostriches; at which his Majesty laughed, and said he knew nothing more proper to send by way of return than a flock of geese.&rdquo;</note> their errand about a peace at Tangier.

and reason was, that Fox's credit was so over-great with the bankers and monied men, that he could procure none but by his means; &ldquo;for that reason,&rdquo; replied the Bishop, &ldquo;I would have made him my friend, Sir Stephen being a person both honest and of credit.&rdquo; He told him likewise of his stateliness and difficulty of access, and several other miscarriages, and which indeed made him hated.

<p>This evening, I was at the entertainment of the Morocco Ambassador at the Duchess of Portsmouth's glorious apartments at Whitehall, where was a great banquet of sweetmeats and music; but at which both the Ambassador and his retinue behaved themselves with extraordinary moderation and modesty, though placed about a long table, a lady between <num value="2">two</num> Moors, and amongst these were the King's natural children, namely, Lady Lichfield and Sussex, the Duchess of Portsmouth, Nelly, &amp;c., concubines, and cattle of that sort, as splendid as jewels and excess of bravery could make them; the Moors neither admiring nor seeming to regard anything, furniture or the like, with any earnestness, and but decently tasting of the banquet. They drank a little milk and water, but not a drop of wine; they also drank of a sorbet and jacolatt;<note><p>Sherbet and chocolate.</note> did not look about, or stare on the ladies, or express the least surprise, but with a courtly negligence in pace, countenance, and whole behaviour, answering only to such questions as were asked with a great deal of wit and gallantry, and so gravely took leave with this compliment, that God would bless the Duchess of Portsmouth and the Prince, her son, meaning the little Duke of Richmond. The King came in at the latter end, just as the Ambassador was going away. In this manner was this slave (for he was no more at home) entertained by most of the nobility in town, and went often to Hyde Park on horseback, where he and his retinue showed their extra- <pb id="p.172" n="172">

ordmary activity in horsemanship, and flinging and catching their lances at full speed; they rode very short, and could stand upright at full speed, managing their spears with incredible agility. He went sometimes to the theatres, where, upon any foolish or fantastical action, he could not forbear laughing, but he endeavoured to hide it with extraordinary modesty and gravity. In a word, the Russian Ambassador, still at Court, behaved himself like a clown, compared to this civil heathen. 
<p><num value="27">27</num><hi rend=italics>th January.</hi> This evening, Sir Stephen Fox acquainted me again with his Majesty's resolution of proceeding in the erection of a Royal Hospital for emerited soldiers on that spot of ground which the Royal Society had sold to his Majesty for <datestruct value="1300--"><year reg="1300">1300</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>, and that he would settle <num value="5000">5000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> per annum on it, and build to the value of <num value="20000">20,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> for the relief and reception of <num value="4">four</num> companies, namely, <num value="400">400</num> men, to be as in a college, or monastery. I was therefore desired by Sir Stephen (who had not only the whole managing of this, but was, as I perceived, himself to be a grand benefactor, as well it became him who had gotten so vast an estate by the soldiers) to assist him, and consult what method to cast it in, as to the government. So, in his study we arranged the governor, chaplain, steward, house-keeper, chirurgeon, cook, butler, gardener, porter, and other officers, with their several salaries and entertainments. I would needs have a library, and mentioned several books, since some soldiers might possibly be studious, when they were at leisure to recollect. Thus we made the <num value="1">first</num> calculations, and set down our thoughts to be considered and digested better, to show his Majesty and the Archbishop. He also engaged me to consider of what laws and orders were fit for the government, which was to be in every respect as strict as in any religious convent. 
<p>After supper, came in the famous treble, Mr. Abel, newly returned from Italy; I never heard a more excellent voice; <num value="1">one</num> would have sworn it had been a woman's, it was so high, and so well and skilfully managed, being accompanied by Signor Francesco on the harpsichord.

<p>After this warning and admonition, I now began to look over and methodise all my writings, accompts, letters, papers; inventoried the goods, and other articles of the house, and put things into the best order I could, and made my will; that now, growing in years, I might have none of these secular things and concerns to distract me, when it should please Almighty God to call me from this transitory life.

Their garments were rich Indian silks, flowered with gold, <hi rend=italics>viz.</hi> a close waistcoat to their knees, drawers, naked legs, and on their heads caps made like fruitbaskets. They wore poisioned daggers at their bosoms, the hafts carved with some ugly serpents' or devils' heads, exceeding keen, and of Damascus metal. They wore no sword. The <num value="2">second</num> Ambassador (sent it seems to succeed in case the <num value="1">first</num> should die by the way in so tedious a journey), having been at Mecca, wore a Turkish or Arab sash, a little part of the linen hanging down behind his neck, with <pb id="p.177" n="177">

They sate crossed-legged like Turks, and sometimes in the posture of apes and monkeys; their nails and teeth as black as jet, and shining, which being the effect, as to their teeth, of perpetually chewing betel to preserve them from the tooth-ache, much raging in their country, is esteemed beautiful. 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> ambassador was of an olive hue, a flat face, narrow eyes, squat nose, and Moorish lips, no hair appeared; they wore several rings of silver, gold, and copper on their fingers, which was a token of knighthood, or nobility. They were of Java Major, whose princes have been turned Mahomedans not above <num value="50">fifty</num> years since; the inhabitants are still pagans and idolaters. They seemed of a dull and heavy constitution, not wondering at any thing they saw; but exceedingly astonished how our law gave us propriety in our estates, and so thinking we were all kings, for they could not be made to comprehend how subjects could possess any thing but at the pleasure of their Prince, they being all slaves; they were pleased with the notion, and admired our happiness. They were very sober, and I believe subtle in their way. Their meat was cooked, carried up, and they attended by several fat slaves, who had no covering save drawers, which appeared very uncouth and loathsome. They eat their pilaw, and other spoon-meat, without spoons, taking up their pottage in the hollow of their fingers, and very dexterously flung it into their mouths without spilling a drop.

of the Trinity Company, of which he had been Master, and others of the country. The vicar preached a short but proper discourse on Psalm xxxix. <num value="10">10</num>, on the frailty of our mortal condition, concluding with an ample and wellde- served enlogy on the defunct, relating to his honourable birth and ancestors, education, learning in Greek and Latin, modern languages, travels, public employments, signal loyalty, character abroad, and particularly the honour of supporting the Church of England in its public worship during its persecution by the late rebels' usurpation and regicide, by the suffrages of divers Bishops, Doctors of the church, and others, who found such an asylum in his house and family at Paris, that in their disputes with the Papists (then triumphing over it as utterly lost) they used to argue for its visibility and existence from Sir R. Browne's chapel and assembly there. Then he spake of his great and loyal sufferings during <num value="13">thirteen</num> years' exile with his present Majesty, his return with him in the signal year <datestruct value="1660"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>; his honourable employment at home, his timely recess to recollect himself, his great age, infirmities, and death. 
<p>He gave to the Trinity-Corporation that land in Deptford on which are built those alms-honses for <num value="24">twenty-four</num> widows of emerited seamen. He was born the famous year of the Gunpowder Treason, in <datestruct value="1605--"><year reg="1605">1605</year></datestruct>, and being the last [male] of his family, left my wife, his only daughter, heir. His grandfather, Sir Richard Browne, was the great instrument under the great Earl of Leicester (favourite to Queen Elizabeth) in his government of the Netherland. He was Master of the Household to King James, and Cofferer; I think was the <num value="1">first</num> who regulated the compositions through England for the King's Household, provisions, progresses,<note><p>Notice was taken of this in a previous passage of the Diary.

<p>By a special clause in his will, he ordered that his body should be buried in the church-yard under the south-east window of the chancel, adjoining to the burying places of his ancestors, since they came out of Essex into Sayes Court, he being much offended at the novel custom of burying every <num value="1">one</num> within the body of the church and chancel; that being a favour heretofore granted to martyrs and great persons; this excess of making churches charnelhouses being of ill and irreverend example, and prejudicial to the health of the living, besides the continual disturbance of the pavement and seats, and several other indecencies. Dr. Hall, the pious Bishop of Norwich, would also be so interred,<note><p>As was afterwards, at Fulham, Dr. Compton, Bishop of London, who used to say, &ldquo;The church-yard for the dead, the church for the living.&rdquo;</note> as may be read in his testament.

<p>That which was new at Windsor since I was last there, and was surprising to me, was the incomparable fresco painting in St. George's Hall, representing the legend of St. George, and triumph of the Black Prince, and his reception by Edward III.; the volto, or roof, not totally finished; then the Resurrection in the Chapel, where the figure of the Ascension is, in my opinion, comparable to any paintings of the most famous Roman masters; the Last Supper, also over the altar. I liked the contrivance of the unseen organ behind the altar, nor less the stupendous and beyond all description the incomparable carving of our Gibbon, who is, without controversy, the greatest master both for invention and rareness of work, that the world ever had in any age; nor doubt I at all that he will prove as great a master in the statuary art. 
<p>Verrio's invention is admirable, his ordnance full and flowing, antique and heroical; his figures move; and, if the walls hold (which is the only doubt by reason of the salts which in time and in this moist climate prejudice, the work will preserve his name to ages. 
<p>There was now the terrace brought almost round the old Castle; the grass made clean, even, and curiously turfed; the avenues to the new park, and other walks, planted with elms and limes, and a pretty canal, and receptacle for fowl; nor less observable and famous is the throwing so huge a quantity of excellent water to the enormous height of the Castle, for the use of the whole house, by an extraordinary invention of Sir Samuel Morland.<note><p>See

Dr. Durell, late Dean of Windsor, being dead, Dr. Turner, <num value="1">one</num> of the Duke's chaplains was made dean. 
<p>I visited my Lady Arlington, Groom of the Stole to her Majesty, who being hardly set down to supper, word was brought her that the Queen was going into the park to walk, it being now near <num value="11">eleven</num> at night; the alarm caused the Countess to rise in all haste, and leave her supper to us. 
<p>By this <num value="1">one</num> may take an estimate of the extreme slavery and subjection that courtiers live in, who have not time to eat and drink at their pleasure. It put me in mind of Horace's <hi rend=italics>Mouse</hi>, and to bless God for my own private condition.

It was delivered kneeling, and then the King and Council went into the council-chamber, the Mayor and his brethren attending still in the presence-chamber. After a short space, they were called in, and my Lord Keeper made a speech to them, exaggerating the disorderly and riotous behaviour in the late election, and polling for Papillon and Du Bois after the Common-hall had been formally dissolved: with other misdemeanours, libels on the government, &amp;c., by which they had incurred his Majesty's high displeasure: and that but for this submission, and under such articles as the King should require their obedience to, he would certainly enter judgment against them, which hitherto he had suspended. The things required were as follows: that they should neither elect Mayor, Sheriffs, Aldermen, Recorder, Common Serjeant, Town-Clerk, Coroner, nor Steward of Southwark, without his Majesty's approbation; and that <pb id="p.187" n="187"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1683--"><year reg="1683">1683</year></datestruct>.</note>
if they presented any his Majesty did not like, they should proceed in wonted manner to a <num value="2">second</num> choice; if that was disapproved, his Majesty to nominate them; and if within <num value="5">five</num> days they thought good to assent to this, all former miscarriages should be forgotten. And so they tamely parted with their so ancient privileges after they had dined and been treated by the King. This was a signal and most remarkable period. What the consequences will prove, time will show. Divers of the old and most learned lawyers and judges were of opinion that they could not forfeit their charter, but might be personally punished for their misdemeanours; but the plurality of the younger judges and rising men judged it otherwise. 
<p>The Popish Plot also, which had hitherto made such a noise, began now sensibly to dwindle, through the folly, knavery, impudence, and giddiness of Oates, so as the Papists began to hold up their heads higher than ever, and those who had fled, flocked to London from abroad. Such sudden changes and eager doings there had been, without anything steady or prudent, for these last <num value="7">seven</num> years.

<p><num value="28">28</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> After the Popish Plot, there was now a new and (as they called it) a Protestant Plot discovered, that certain Lords and others should design the assassination of the King and the Duke as they were to come from Newmarket, with a general rising of the nation, and especially of the City of London, disaffected to the present Government. Upon which were committed to the Tower, the Lord Russell, eldest son of the Earl of Bedford, the Earl of Essex, Mr. Algernon Sidney, son to the old Earl of Leicester, Mr. Trenchard, Hampden, Lord Howard of Escrick, and others. <pb id="p.188" n="188"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
A proclamation was issued against my Lord Grey, the Duke of Monmouth, Sir Thomas Armstrong, and <num value="1">one</num> Ferguson, who had escaped beyond sea; of these some were said to be for killing the King, others for only seizing on him, and persuading him to new counsels, on the pretence of the danger of Popery, should the Duke live to succeed, who was now again admitted to the councils and cabinet secrets. The Lords Essex and Russell were much deplored, for believing they had any evil intention against the King, or the Church; some thought they were cunningly drawn in by their enemies for not approving some late counsels and management relating to France, to Popery, to the persecution of the Dissenters, &amp;c. They were discovered by the Lord Howard of Escrick and some false brethren of the club, and the design happily broken; had it taken effect, it would, to all appearance, have exposed the Government to unknown and dangerous events; which God avert! 
<p>Was born my grand-daughter at Sayes Court, and christened by the name of Martha Maria, our Vicar officiating. I pray God bless her, and may she choose the better part! 
<p><num value="13">13</num><hi rend=italics>th July.</hi> As I was visiting Sir Thomas Yarborough and his Lady<note><p>The lady was Mary Blagg, of whom Count Hamilton says so much; and sister of Mr. Blagg, of whom Evelyn speaks so much</note> in Covent Garden, the astonishing news was brought to us of the Earl of Essex having cut his throat, having been but <num value="3">three</num> days a prisoner in the Tower, and this happening on the very day and instant that Lord Russell was on his trial, and had sentence of death. This accident exceedingly amazed me, my Lord Essex being so well known by me to be a person of such sober and religious deportment, so well at his ease, and so much obliged to the King. It is certain the King and Duke were at the Tower, and passed by his window about the same time this morning, when my Lord asking for a razor, shut himself into a closet, and perpetrated the horrid act. Yet it was wondered by some how it was possible he should do it in the manner he was found, for the wound was so deep and wide, that being cut through the gullet, wind-pipe, and both the jugulars, it reached to the very vertebr&aelig; of the neck, so that the head held to it by a very little skin as it were; the gapping too of the razor, and cutting his own fingers, was a <pb id="p.189" n="189"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1683--"><year reg="1683">1683</year></datestruct>.</note>
little strange; but more, that having passed the jugulars he should have strength to proceed so far, that an executioner could hardly have done more with an axe. There were odd reflections upon it.<note><p>Bishop Burnet, after making inquiry, by desire of the Countess, declares that he does not believe that Essex was murdered. <hi rend=italics>Own Times</hi>, vol. i. p. <num value="569">569</num>.</note>

<p>The fatal news coming to Hicks's Hall upon the article of my Lord Russell's trial, was said to have had no little influence on the Jury and all the Bench to his prejudice. Others said that he had himself on some occasions hinted that in case he should be in danger of having his life taken from him by any public misfortune, those who thirsted for his estate should miss of their aim; and that he should speak favourably of that Earl of Northumberland,<note><p>Henry Percy, <num value="8">eighth</num> Earl of Northumberland, shot himself in the Tower, to which he had been committed on a charge of high treason, in <datestruct VALUE="1585-06--"><month reg="06">June</month> <year reg="1585">1585</year></datestruct>.</note> and some others, who made away with themselves; but these are discourses so unlike his sober and prudent conversation, that I have no inclination to credit them. What might instigate him to this devilish act, I am not able to conjecture. My Lord Clarendon, his brother-in-law, who was with him but the day before, assured me he was then very cheerful, and declared it to be the effect of his innocence and loyalty; and most believe that his Majesty had no severe intentions against him, though he was altogether inexorable as to Lord Russell and some of the rest. For my part, I believe the crafty and ambitious Earl of Shaftesbury had brought them into some dislike of the present carriage of matters at Court, not with any design of destroying the monarchy (which Shaftesbury had in confidence and for unanswerable reasons told me he would support to his last breath, as having seen and felt the misery of being under mechanic tyranny), but perhaps of setting up some other whom he might govern, and frame to his own platonic fancy, without much regard to the religion established under the hierarchy, for which he had no esteem; but when he perceived those whom he had engaged to rise, fail of his expectations, and the day past, reproaching his accomplices that a <num value="2">second</num> day for an exploit of this nature was never <pb id="p.190" n="190"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
successful, he gave them the slip, and got into Holland, where the fox died, <num value="3">three</num> months before these unhappy Lords and others were discovered or suspected. Every <num value="1">one</num> deplored Essex and Russell, especially the last, as being thought to have been drawn in on pretence only of endeavouring to rescue the King from his present councillors, and secure religion from Popery, and the nation from arbitrary government, now so much apprehended; whilst the rest of those who were fled, especially Ferguson and his gang, had doubtless some bloody design to get up a Commonwealth, and turn all things topsy-turvy. Of the same tragical principles is Sydney. 
<p>I had this day much discourse with Monsieur Pontaq, son to the famous and wise prime President of Bordeaux. This gentleman was owner of that excellent vignoble of Pontaq and O&lsquo;Brien, from whence come the choicest of our Bourdeaux wines; and I think I may truly say of him, what was not so truly said of St. Paul, that much learning had made him mad. He had studied well in philosophy, but chiefly the Rabbins, and was exceedingly addicted to cabalistical fancies, an eternal hablador [romancer], and half distracted by reading abundance of the extravagant Eastern Jews. He spake all languages, was very rich, had a handsome person, and was well-bred, about <num value="45">forty-five</num> years of age.<note><p>In a later page of the Diary (<hi rend=italics>post</hi>, p. <num value="339">339</num>) Evelyn describes himself and certain members of the Royal Society all dining &ldquo;at Pontae's as usual.&rdquo; Pontae's was a famous French eating-house, now existing only in the verse of Dryden, the prose of Swift and Defoe, and other such imperishable records. Defoe describes its name as derived from the owner of the most celebrated claret vintage of France; the president of the parliament of Bourdeaux; the &ldquo;M. Pontaq&rdquo; above referred to, established it; and Swift, who dined at it <num value="17">seventeen</num> years after the dinner mentioned by Evelyn, tells Stella that the wine was charged <measure value="7s." type=currency><num value="7">seven</num> shillings</measure> a flask. &ldquo;Are not these pretty rates?&rdquo;</note>

<p><num value="14">14</num><hi rend=italics>th July.</hi> I visited Mr. Fraser, a learned Scots gentleman, whom I had formerly recommended to Lord Berkeley for the instruction and government of his son, since dead at sea. He had now been in Holland at the sale of the learned Heinsius's library, and showed me some very rare and curious books, and some MSS., which he had purchased to good value. There were <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> Herbals in miniature, <pb id="p.191" n="191">

<p><num value="15">15</num><hi rend=italics>th July.</hi> A stranger, and old man, preached on Jerem. vi. <num value="8">8</num>, the not hearkening to instruction, portentous of desolation to a people; much after Bishop Andrews's method, full of logical divisions, in short and broken periods, and Latin sentences, now quite out of fashion in the pulpit, which is grown into a far more profitable way, of plain and practical discourses, of which sort this nation, or any other, never had greater plenty or more profitable (I am confident); so much has it to answer for thriving no better on it. 
<p>The public was now in great consternation on the late plot and conspiracy; his Majesty very melancholy, and not stirring without double guards; all the avenues and private doors about Whitehall and the Park shut up, few admitted to walk in it. The Papists, in the mean time, very jocund; and indeed with reason, seeing their own plot brought to nothing, and turned to ridicule, and now a conspiracy of Protestants, as they called them. 
<p>The Turks were likewise in hostility against the German Emperor, almost masters of the Upper Hungary, and drawing towards Vienna. On the other side, the French King (who it is believed brought in the infidels) disturbing his Spanish and Dutch neighbours, having swallowed up almost all Flanders, pursuing his ambition of a <num value="5">fifth</num> universal monarchy; and all this blood and disorder in Christendom had evidently its rise from our defections at home, in a wanton peace, minding nothing but luxury, ambition, and to procure money for our vices. To this add our irreligion and atheism, great ingratitude, and self-interest; the apostacy of some, and the suffering the French to grow so great, and the Hollanders so weak. In a word, we were wanton, mad, and surfeiting with prosperity; every moment unsettling the old foundations, and never constant to any thing. The Lord in mercy avert the sad omen, and that we do not provoke him till he bear it no longer! 
<p>This summer did we suffer <num value="20">twenty</num> French men-of-war to pass our Channel towards the Sound, to help the Danes against the Swedes, who had abandoned the French interest, we not having ready sufficient to guard our coasts, or take cognizance of what they did; though the nation never had <pb id="p.192" n="192">

<p>Saw the Countess of Monte Feltre, whose husband I had formerly known; he was a subject of the Pope's, but becoming a Protestant he resided in England, and married into the family of the Savilles, of Yorkshire. The Count, her late husband, was a very learned gentleman, a great politician, and a goodly man.

<p><num value="18">18</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> I went to London, to visit the Duchess of Grafton, now great with child, a most virtuous and beautiful lady.

take his meat. He has lived a most easy life, in plenty even abroad, whilst his Majesty was a sufferer; he has lost immense sums at play, which yet, at about <num value="80">eighty</num> years old, he continues, having <num value="1">one</num> that sits by him to name the spots on the cards. He eat and drank with extraordinary appetite. He is a prudent old courtier, and much enriched since his Majesty's return. 
<p>After dinner, I walked to survey the sad demolition of Clarendon-House, that costly and only sumptuous palace of the late Lord Chancellor Hyde, where I have often been so cheerful with him, and sometimes so sad:<note><p>An engraving of the south or principal front of this noble mansion, copied from an extremely rare print, is given in Smith's <num value="62">Sixty-two</num> Additional Plates to his Antiquities of Westminster, <num value="4">4</num>to., <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>.</note> happening to make him a visit but the day before he fled from the angry Parliament, accusing him of mal-administration, and being envious at his grandeur, who from a private lawyer came to be fatherin-law to the Duke of York, and as some would suggest, designing his Majesty's marriage with the Infanta of Portugal, not apt to breed. To this they imputed much of our unhappiness; and that he, being sole minister and favourite at his Majesty's restoration, neglected to gratify the King's suffering party, preferring those who were the cause of our troubles. But perhaps as many of these things were injuriously laid to his charge, so he kept the government far steadier than it has proved since. I could name some who I think contributed greatly to his ruin,&mdash;the buffoons and the 
<hi rend=italics>misses</hi>, to whom he was an eye-sore. It is true he was of a jolly temper, after the old English fashion; but France had now the ascendant, and we were become quite another nation. The Chancellor gone, and dying in exile, the Earl his successor sold that which cost <measure value="50000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="50000">50,000</num></measure> building, to the young Duke of Albemarle for <measure value="25000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="25000">25,000</num></measure>, to pay debts which how contracted remains yet a mystery, his son being no way a prodigal. Some imagine the Duchess his daughter had been chargeable to him. However it were, this stately palace is decreed to ruin, to support the prodigious waste the Duke of Albemarle had made of his estate, since the old man died. He sold it to the highest bidder, and it fell to certain rich bankers and mechanics, who gave for it and the ground about it, <measure value="35000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="35000">35,000</num></measure>; they design a new town, as it <pb id="p.195" n="195">

were, and a most magnificent piazza [square]. It is said they have already materials towards it with what they sold of the house alone, more worth than what they paid for it. See the vicissitudes of earthly things! I was astonished at this demolition, nor less at the little army of labourers and artificers levelling the ground, laying foundations, and contriving great buildings at an expense of <measure value="200000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200000">200,000</num></measure>, if they perfect their design.<note><p>In a letter to Lord Cornbury, dated Sayes Court, <datestruct VALUE="1665-01-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>-<num value="6">6</num>, Evelyn having then just returned from a visit to Clarendon House, says: &ldquo;I went with prejudice and a critical spirit, incident to those who fancy they know anything in art; I acknowledge that I have never seen a nobler pile. My old friend and fellow-traveller (inhabitants and contemporaries at Rome) has perfectly acquitted himself. It is, without hyperbole, the best contrived, the most useful, graceful, and magnificent house in England; I except not Audley-End, which though larger and full of gaudy barbarous ornaments, does not gratify judicious spectators. Here is state and use, solidity and beauty, most symmetrically combined together. Nothing abroad pleases me better, nothing at home approaches it. I have no design to gratify the architect beyond what I am obliged as a professed honourer of virtue wheresoever it is conspicuous; but when I had seriously contemplated every room (for I went into them all, from the cellar to the platform on the roof), seen how well and judiciously the walls were erected, the arches cut and turned, the timber braced, their scantlings and contignations disposed, I was most highly satisfied, and do acknowledge myself to have much improved by what I observed.&rdquo;</note>

<p><num value="19">19</num><hi rend=italics>th September.</hi> In my walks I stepped into a goldbeater's workhouse, where he showed me the wonderful ductility of that spreading and oily metal.

<p><num value="23">23</num><hi rend=italics>rd.</hi> We had now the welcome tidings of the King of Poland raising the siege of Vienna. which had given terror to all Europe, and utmost reproach to the French, who it is believed brought in the Turks for diversion, that the French King might the more easily swallow Flanders, and pursue his unjust conquest on, the empire, whilst we sat unconcerned and under a deadly charm from somebody. 
<p>There was this day a collection for rebuilding Newmarket, <pb id="p.196" n="196"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
consumed by an accidental fire, which removing his Majesty thence sooner than was intended, put by the assassins, who were disappointed of their rendezvous and expectation by a wonderful providence. This made the King more earnest to render Winchester the seat of his autumnal field-diversions for the future, designing a palace there, where the ancient castle stood; infinitely indeed preferable to Newmarket for prospects, air, pleasure, and provisions. The surveyor has already begun the foundation for a palace, estimated to cost <measure value="35000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="35000">35,000</num></measure>, and his Majesty is purchasing ground about it to make a park, &amp;c. 
<p><num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>th October.</hi> I went to London, on receiving a note from the Countess of Arlington, of some considerable charge or advantage I might obtain by applying myself to his Majesty on this signal conjuncture of his Majesty entering--up judgment against the City-charter; the proposal made me I wholly declined, not being well satisfied with these violent transactions, and not a little sorry that his Majesty was so often put upon things of this nature against so great a City, the consequence whereof may be so much to his prejudice; so I returned home. At this time, the Lord Chief-Justice Pemberton was displaced. He was held to be the most learned of the judges, and an honest man. Sir George Jeffreys was advanced, reputed to be most ignorant, but most daring. Sir George Treby, Recorder of London, was also put by, and <num value="1">one</num> Genner, an obscure lawyer, set in his place. <num value="8">Eight</num> of the richest and chief aldermen were removed, and all the rest made only justices of the peace, and no more wearing of gowns, or chains of gold; the Lord Mayor and <num value="2">two</num> Sheriffs holding their places by new grants as <hi rend=italics>custodes</hi>, at the King's pleasure. The pomp and grandeur of the most august City in the world thus changed face in a moment; which gave great occasion of discourse and thoughts of hearts, what all this would end in. Prudent men were for the old foundations. 
<p>Following his Majesty this morning through the gallery, I went with the few who attended him, into the Duchess of Portsmouth's <hi rend=italics>dressing-room</hi> within her bed-chamber, where she was in her morning loose garment, her maids combing her, newly out of her bed, his Majesty and the gallants standing about her; but that which engaged my <pb id="p.197" n="197"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1683--"><year reg="1683">1683</year></datestruct>.</note>
curiosity, was the rich and splendid furniture of this woman's apartment, now twice or thrice pulled down and rebuilt to satisfy her prodigal and expensive pleasures, whilst her Majesty's does not exceed some gentlemen's ladies in furniture and accommodation. Here I saw the new fabric of French tapestry, for design, tenderness of work, and incomparable imitation of the best paintings, beyond any thing I had ever beheld. Some pieces had Versailles, St. Germains, and other palaces of the French King, with huntings, figures, and landscapes, exotic fowls, and all to the life rarely done. Then for Japan cabinets, skreens, pendule clocks, great vases of wrought plate, tables, stands, chimney-furniture, sconces, branches, braseras, &amp;c., all of massy silver and out of number, besides some of her Majesty's best paintings. 
<p>Surfeiting of this, I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's and went contented home to my poor, but quiet villa. What contentment can there be in the riches and splendour of this world, purchased with vice and dishonour?

In the rest of the chamber are some excellent paintings of Holbein, and other masters. The garden is large, and in good air, but the fronts of the house not answerable to the inside. The court at entry, and wings <pb id="p.198" n="198"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
for offices seem too near the street, and that so very narrow and meanly built, that the corridor is not in proportion to the rest, to hide the court from being overlooked by neighbours; all which might have been prevented, had they placed the house further into the ground, of which there was enough to spare. But on the whole it is a fine palace, built after the French pavilion-way, by Mr. Hooke, the Curator of the Royal Society.

Coaches plied from Westminster to the Temple, and from several other stairs to and fro, as in the streets, sleds, sliding with skates, a bull-baiting, horse and coach-races, puppet-plays and interludes, cooks, tippling, and other lewd places, so that it seemed to be a bacchanalian triumph, or carnival on the water, whilst it was a severe judgment on the land, the trees not only splitting as if lightningstruck, but men and cattle perishing in divers places, and the very seas so locked up with ice, that no vessels could stir out or come in. The fowls, fish, and birds, and all our exotic plants and greens, universally perishing. Many parks of deer were destroyed, and all sorts of fuel so dear, that there were great contributions to preserve the poor alive. Nor was this severe weather much less intense in most parts of Europe, even as far as Spain and the most southern tracts. London, by reason of the excessive coldness of the air hindering the ascent of the smoke, was so filled with the fuliginous steam of the sea-coal, that hardly could <num value="1">one</num> see across the streets, and this filling the lungs with its gross particles, exceedingly obstructed the breast, so as <num value="1">one</num> could scarcely breathe.

<p>At this time the Earl of Rochester was removed from the Treasury to the Presidentship of the Council; Lord Godolphin was made <num value="1">first</num> Commissioner of the Treasury in his place; Lord Middleton (a Scot) made Secretary of State, in the room of Lord Godolphin. These alterations being very unexpected and mysterious, gave great occasion of discourse. 
<p>There was now an Ambassador from the King of Siam, in the East Indies, to his Majesty.

At the same time, I went to see a crocodile, brought from some of the West India Islands, resembling the Egyptian crocodile. 
<p><num value="24">24</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> I dined at Sir Stephen Fox's with the Duke of Northumberland. He seemed to be a young gentleman of good capacity, well-bred, civil, and modest: newly come from travel, and had made his campaign at the siege of Luxemburg. Of all his Majesty's children (of which he had now <num value="6">six</num> Dukes) this seemed the most accomplished and worth the owning. He is extraordinary handsome and well-shaped.

all the squibs and bacchanalia of the Lord Mayor's show, to the Royal Society, where he was proposed a member; and then treated him at dinner. 
<p>I went to St. Clement's, that pretty built and contrived church, where a young divine gave us an eloquent sermon on <num value="1">1</num> Cor. vi. <num value="20">20</num>, inciting to gratitude and glorifying God for the fabric of our bodies and the dignity of our nature.

He challenged the producing but of <num value="5">five</num> clergymen who forsook our Church and went over to that of Rome, during all the troubles and rebellion in England, which lasted near <num value="20">twenty</num> years; and this was to my certain observation a great truth. 
<p><num value="15">15</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Being the Queen's birth-day, there were fireworks on the Thames before Whitehall, with pageants of castles, forts, and other devices of girandolas, serpents, the King and Queen's arms and mottoes, all represented in fire, such as had not been seen here. But the most remarkable was the several fires and skirmishes in the very water, which actually moved a long way, burning under the water, now and then appearing above it, giving reports like muskets and cannon, with grenados and innumerable other devices. It is said it cost <measure value="1500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1500">1,500</num></measure>. It was concluded with a ball, where all the young ladies and gallants danced in the great hall. The court had not been seen so brave and rich in apparel since his Majesty's Restoration.

The series of Popes was rare, and so were several amongst the moderns, especially that of John Huss's martyrdom at Constance; of the Roman Emperors, Consulars; <pb id="p.211" n="211"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1684--"><year reg="1684">1684</year></datestruct>.</note>
some Greek, &amp;c., in copper, gold, and silver; not many truly antique; a medallion of Otho Paulus &AElig;milius, &amp;c., ancient. They were held at a price of <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="1000">1,000</num></measure>; but not worth, I judge, above <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure>. 
<p><num value="7">7</num><hi rend=italics>th December.</hi> I went to see the new church at St. James's, elegantly built; the altar was especially adorned, the white marble enclosure curiously and richly carved, the flowers and garlands about the walls by Mr. Gibbons, in wood: a pelican with her young at her breast; just over the altar in the carved compartment and border environing the purple velvet fringed with I. H. S. richly embroidered, and most noble plate, were given by Sir R. Geere, to the value (as was said) of <num value="200">200</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> There was no altar anywhere in England, nor has there been any abroad, more handsomely adorned. 
<p><num value="17">17</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Early in the morning I went into St. James's Park to see <num value="3">three</num> Turkish, or Asian horses, newly brought over, and now <num value="1">first</num> showed to his Majesty. There were <num value="4">four</num>, but <num value="1">one</num> of them died at sea, being <num value="3">three</num> weeks coming from Hamburgh. They were taken from a Bashaw at the siege of Vienna, at the late famous raising that leaguer. I never beheld so delicate a creature as <num value="1">one</num> of them was, of somewhat a bright bay, <num value="2">two</num> white feet, a blaze; such a head, eyes, ears, neck, breast, belly, haunches, legs, pasterns, and feet, in all regards, beautiful, and proportioned to admiration; spirited, proud, nimble, making halt, turning with that swiftness, and in so small a compass, as was admirable. With all this so gentle and tractable as called to mind what I remember Busbequius speaks of them, to the reproach of our grooms in Europe, who bring up their horses so churlishly, as makes most of them retain their ill habits. They trotted like does, as if they did not feel the ground. <num value="500">Five hundred</num> guineas was demanded for the <num value="1">first</num>; <num value="300">300</num> for the <num value="2">second</num>; and <num value="200">200</num> for the <num value="3">third</num>, which was brown. All of them were choicely shaped, but the <num value="2">two</num> last not altogether so perfect as the <num value="1">first</num>. 
<p>It was judged by the spectators, among whom was the King, Prince of Denmark, Duke of York, and several of the Court, noble persons skilled in horses, especially Monsieur Faubert and his son (provost masters of the Academy, and esteemed of the best in Europe), that there were never seen <pb id="p.212" n="212"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
any horses in these parts to be compared with them. Add to all this, the furniture, consisting of embroidery on the saddle, housings, quiver, bow, arrows, scymitar, sword, mace, or battle-axe, <hi rend=italics>&agrave; la Turcisq;</hi> the Bashaw's velvet mantle furred with the most perfect ermine I ever beheld; all which, ironwork in common furniture being here of silver, curiously wrought and double gilt, to an incredible value. Such and so extraordinary was the embroidery, that I never saw any thing approaching it. The reins and headstall were of crimson silk, covered with chains of silver gilt. There was also a Turkish royal standard of a horse's tail, together with all sorts of other caparisons belonging to a general's horse, by which <num value="1">one</num> may estimate how gallantly and magnificently those infidels appear in the field; for nothing could be seen more glorious. The gentleman (a German) who rid the horse, was in all this garb. They were shod with iron made round and closed at the heel, with a hole in the middle about as wide as a shilling. The hoofs most entire. 
<p><num value="18">18</num><hi rend=italics>th December.</hi> I went with Lord Cornwallis to see the young gallants do their exercise, Mr. Faubert having newly railed in a manage, and fitted it for the academy. There were the Dukes of Norfolk and Northumberland, Lord Newburgh, and a nephew of (Duras) Earl of Feversham. The exercises were, <num value="1">1</num>, running at the ring; <num value="2">2</num>, flinging a javelin at a Moor's head; <num value="3">3</num>, discharging a pistol at a mark; lastly, taking up a gauntlet with the point of a sword; all these performed in full speed. The Duke of Northumberland hardly missed of succeeding in every <num value="1">one</num>, a dozen times, as I think. The Duke of Norfolk did exceeding bravely. Lords Newburgh and Duras seemed nothing so dexterous. Here I saw the difference of what the French call &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>bel homme &agrave; cheval</hi>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>bon homme &agrave; cheval</hi>;&rdquo; the Duke of Norfolk being the <num value="1">first</num>, that is rather a fine person on a horse, the Duke of Northumberland being both in perfection, namely, a graceful person and an excellent rider. But the Duke of Norfolk told me he had not been at this exercise these <num value="12">twelve</num> years before. There were in the field the Prince of Denmark, and the Lord Lansdowne, son of the Earl of Bath, who had been made a Count of the Empire last summer for his service before Vienna.

My daughter Mary being with us, she also sung to the great satisfaction of both the masters, and a world of people of quality present. 
<p>She did so also at my Lord Rochester's the evening following, where we had the French boy so famed for his singing, and indeed he had a delicate voice, and had been well taught. I also heard Mrs. Packer (daughter to my old friend) sing before his Majesty and the Duke, privately, that stupendous bass, Gosling, accompanying her, but hers was so loud as took away much of the sweetness. Certainly never woman had a stronger or better ear, could she possibly have governed it. She would do rarely in a large church among the nuns.

It was a mark of the extraordinary dexterity, resolution, and presence of mind in the Doctor, to let him blood in the very paroxysm, without staying the coming of other physicians, which regularly should have been done, and for want of which he must have a regular pardon, as they tell me.<note><p>Burnet tells us that the Privy Council approved of what he ha I done, and ordered him <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>, but it was never paid him.

Majesty for the instant, but it was only a short reprieve He still complained, and was relapsing, often fainting, with sometimes epileptic symptoms, till Wednesday, for which he was cupped, let blood in both jugulars, and both vomit and purges, which so relieved him, that on Thursday hopes of recovery were signified in the public Gazette, but that day about noon, the physicians thought him feverish. This they seemed glad of, as being more easily allayed and methodically dealt with than his former fits; so as they prescribed the famous Jesuit's powder; but it made him worse, and some very able doctors who were present did not think it a fever, but the effect of his frequent bleeding and other sharp operations used by them about his head, so that probably the powder might stop the circulation, and renew his former its, which now made him very weak. Thus he passed Thursday night with great difficulty, when complaining of a pain in his side, they drew <num value="12">twelve</num> ounces more of blood from him; this was by <num value="6">six</num> in the morning on Friday, and it gave him relief, but it did not continue, for being now in much pain, and struggling for breath, he lay dozing, and, after some conflicts, the physicians despairing of him, he gave up the ghost a half an hour after <num value="11">eleven</num> in the morning, being the <datestruct VALUE="1685-02-6"><day reg="6">sixth</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>, in the <num value="36">36th</num> year of his reign, and <num value="54">54th</num> of his age. 
<p>Prayers were solemnly made in all the churches, especially <*>n both the Court Chapels, where the chaplains relieved <num value="1">one</num> another every half quarter of an hour from the time he began to be in danger till he expired, according to the form prescribed in the Church-offices. Those who assisted his Majesty's devotions were, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishops of London, Durham, and Ely, but more especially Dr. Ken, the Bishop of Bath and Wells.<note><p>The account given of this by Charles's brother and successor, is, that when the King's life was wholly despaired of and it was time to prepare for another world, <num value="2">two</num> Bishops came to do their function, who reading the prayers appointed in the Common Prayer-Book on that occasion, when they came to the place where usually they exhort a sick person to make a confession of his sins, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, who was <num value="1">one</num> of them, advertised him, <hi rend=italics>It was not of obligation;</hi> and after a short exhortation, asked him if he was sorry for his sins? which the King saying he was, the Bishop pronounced the absolution, and then, asked him if he pleased to receive the Sacrament? to which the King made no reply; and being pressed by the Bishop several times, gave no other answer but that it was time enough, or that he would think of it. 
<p>King James adds, that he stood all the while by the bed-side, and seeing the King would not receive the sacrament from them, and knowing his sentiments, he desired the company to stand a little from the bed, and then asked the King whether he should sent for a priest, to which the King replied, &ldquo;For God's sake, brother, do, and lose no time.&rdquo; The Duke said he would bring <num value="1">one</num> to him; but none could be found except father Huddleston, who had been so assistant in the King's escape from Worcester; he was brought up a back staircase, and the company were desired to withdraw, but he (the Duke of York) not thinking fit that he should be left alone with the King, desired the Earl of Bath, a Lord of the Bedchamber, and the Earl of Feversham, Captain of the Guard, should stay; the rest being gone, father Huddleston was introduced, and administered the sacrament.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Life of James II.</hi></note> It is said <pb id="p.216" n="216"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
they exceedingly urged the receiving Holy Sacrament, but his Majesty told them he would consider of it, which he did so long till it was too late. Others whispered that the Bishops and Lords, except the Earls of Bath and Feversham, being ordered to withdraw the night before, Huddleston, the priest, had presumed to administer the Popish offices. He gave his breeches and keys to the Duke, who was almost continually kneeling by his bed side, and in tears. He also recommended to him the care of his natural children, all except the Duke of Monmouth, now in Holland, and in his displeasure. He entreated the Queen to pardon him (not without cause); who a little before had sent a bishop to excuse her not more frequently visiting him, in regard of her excessive grief, and withal that his Majesty would forgive it if at any time she had offended him. He spake to the Duke to be kind to the Duchess of Cleveland, and especially Portsmouth, and that Nelly might not starve. 
<p>Thus died King Charles II., of a vigorous and robust constitution, and in all appearance promising a long life. He was a prince of many virtues, and many great imperfections; debonaire, easy of access, not bloody nor cruel; his countenance fierce, his voice great, proper of person, every motion became him; a lover of the sea, and skilful in shipping; not affecting other studies, yet he had a aboratory, and knew of many empirical medicines, and the easier <pb id="p.217" n="217"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>.</note>
mechanical mathematics; he loved lanting and building, and brought in a politer way of living, which passed to luxury and intolerable expense. He had a particular talent in telling a story, and facetious passages, of which he had innumerable; this made some buffoons and vicious wretches too presumptuous and familiar, not worthy the favour they abused. He took delight in having a number of little spaniels follow him and lie in his bed-chamber, where he often suffered the bitches to puppy and give suck, which rendered it very offensive, and indeed made the whole court nasty and stinking. He would doubtless have been an excellent prince, had he been less addicted to women, who made him uneasy, and always in want to supply their unmeasurable profusion, to the detriment of many indigent persons who had signally served both him and his father. He frequently and easily changed favourites to his great prejudice. 
<p>As to other public transactions, and unhappy miscarriages, &lsquo;tis not here I intend to number them; but certainly never had King more glorious opportunities to have made himself, his people, and all Europe happy, and prevented innumerable mischiefs, had not his too easy nature resigned him to be managed by crafty men, and some abandoned and profane wretches who corrupted his otherwise sufficient parts, disciplined as he had been by many afflictions during his banishment, which gave him much experience and knowledge of men and things; but those wicked creatures took him from off all application becoming so great a King. The history of his reign will certainly be the most wonderful for the variety of matter and accidents, above any extant in former ages: the sad tragical death of his father, his banishment and hardships, his miraculous restoration, conspiracies against him, parliaments, wars, plagues, fires, comets, revolutions abroad happening in his time, with a <num value="1000">thousand</num> other particulars. He was ever kind to me, and very gracious upon all occasions, and therefore I cannot without ingratitude but deplore his loss, which for many respects, as well as duty, I do with all my soul. 
<p>His Majesty being dead, the Duke, now King James II., went immediately to Council, and before entering into any business, passionately declaring his sorrow, told their Lordships, that since the succession had fallen to him, he would <pb id="p.218" n="218"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
endeavour to follow the example of his predecessor in his clemency and tenderness to his people; that, however he had been misrepresented as affecting arbitrary power, they should find the contrary; for that the laws of England had made the King as great a monarch as he could desire; that he would endeavour to maintain the Government both in Church and State, as by law established, its principles being so firm for monarchy, and the members of it showing themselves so good and loyal subjects;<note><p>This is the substance (and very nearly the words employed) of what is stated by King James II. in the MS. printed in his life; but in that MS. are some words which Evelyn has omitted. For example, after speaking of the members of the Church of England as good and loyal subjects, the King adds, <hi rend=italics>and therefore I shall always take care to defend and support it.</hi> James then goes on to say, that being desired by some present to allow copies to be taken, he said he had not committed it to writing; on which Mr. Finch (then Solicitor-General and afterwards Earl of Aylesford) replied, that what his Majesty had said had made so deep an impression on him, that he believed he could repeat the very words, and if his Majesty would permit him, he would write them down; which the King agreeing to, he went to a table and wrote them down, and this being shown to the King, he approved of it, and it was immediately published. The King afterwards proceeds to say: No <num value="1">one</num> can wonder that Mr. Finch should word the speech as strong as he could in favour of the Established Religion, nor that the King in such a hurry should pass it over without reflection; for though his Majesty intended to promise both security to their religion and protection to their persons, he was afterwards convinced it had been better expressed by assuring them he never would endeavour to alter the Established Religion, than that he would endeavour to preserve it, and that he would rather support and defend the professors of it, than the religion itself; they could not expect he should make a conscience of supporting what in his conscience he thought erroneous: his engaging not to molest the professors of it, nor to deprive them or their successors of any spiritual dignity, revenue, or employment, but to suffer the ecclesiastical affairs to go on in the track they were in, was all they could wish or desire from a Prince of a different persuasion; but having once approved that way of expressing it which Mr. Finch had made choice of, he thought it necessary not to vary from it in the declarations or speeches he made afterwards, not doubting but the world would understand it in the meaning he intended.&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;Tis true, afterwards <hi rend=italics>it was</hi> pretended he kept not up to this engagement; but had they deviated no further from the duty and allegiance which both nature and repeated oath obliged them to, <hi rend=italics>than he did from his word</hi>, they had still remained as happy a people as they really were during his short reign in England.&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Life of James the <num value="2">Second</num></hi>, ii. <num value="435">435</num>. The words printed in italics in this extract are from the interlineations of the son of King James the <num value="2">Second</num>.</note> and that, as he would never depart <pb id="p.219" n="219">

from the just rights and prerogatives of the Crown, so he would never invade any man's property; but as he had often adventured his life in defence of the nation, so he would still proceed, and preserve it in all its lawful rights and liberties. 
<p>This being the substance of what he said, the Lords desired it might be published, as containing matter of great satisfaction to a jealous people upon this change, which his Majesty consented to. Then were the Council sworn, and a Proclamation ordered to be published that all officers should continue in their stations, that there might be no failure of public justice, till his further pleasure should be known. Then the King rose, the Lords accompanying him to his bedchamber, where, whilst he reposed himself, tired indeed as he was with grief and watching, they returned again into the Council-chamber to take order for the <hi rend=italics>proclaiming</hi> his Majesty, which (after some debate) they consented should be in the very form his grandfather, King James I., was, after the death of Queen Elizabeth; as likewise that the Lords, &amp;c., should proceed in their coaches through the city for the more solemnity of it. Upon this was I, and several other Gentlemen waiting in the Privy-gallery, admitted into the Council-chamber to be witness of what was resolved on. Thence with the Lords, the Lord Marshal and Heralds, and other Crown-officers being ready, we <num value="1">first</num> went to Whitehallgate, where the Lords stood on foot bare-headed, whilst the Herald proclaimed his Majesty's title to the Imperial Crown and succession according to the form, the trumpets and kettle-drums having <num value="1">first</num> sounded <num value="3">three</num> times, which ended with the people's acclamations. Then a herald called the Lords' coaches according to rank, myself accompanying the solemnity in my Lord Cornwallis's coach, <num value="1">first</num> to Temple Bar, where the Lord Mayor and his brethren met us on horseback, in all their formalities, and proclaimed the King; hence to the Exchange in Cornhill, and so we returned in the order we set forth. Being come to Whitehall, we all went and kissed the King and Queen's hands. He had been on the bed, but was now risen and in his undress. The Queen was in bed in her apartment, but put forth her hand, seeming to be much afflicted, as I believe she was, having deported herself so decently upon all occasions since she came into England, which made her universally beloved <pb id="p.220" n="220">

<p>Thus concluded this sad and not joyful day. 
<p>I can never forget the inexpressible luxury and profaneness, gaming, and all dissoluteness, and as it were total forgetfulness of God (it being Sunday evening), which this day se'nnight I was witness of, the King sitting and toying with his concubines, Portsmouth, Cleveland, and Mazarine, &amp;c., a French boy singing love-songs,<note><hi rend=italics>Ante</hi>, p. <num value="214">214</num>.</note> in that glorious gallery, whilst about <num value="20">twenty</num> of the great courtiers and other dissolute persons were at Basset round a large table, a bank of at least <num value="2000">2000</num> in gold before them; upon which <num value="2">two</num> gentlemen who were with me made reflections with astonishment. <num value="6">Six</num> days after, was all in the dust 
<p>It was enjoined that those who put on mourning should wear it as for a father, in the most solemn manner. 
<p><num value="10">10</num><hi rend=italics>th February.</hi> Being sent to by the Sheriff of the County to appear and assist in proclaiming the King, I went the next day to Bromley, where I met the Sheriff and the Commander of the Kentish Troop, with an appearance, I suppose, of above <num value="500">500</num> horse, and innumerable people, <num value="2">two</num> of his Majesty's trumpets, and a Serjeant with other officers, who having drawn up the horse in a large field near the town, marched thence, with swords drawn, to the market-place, where, making a ring, after sound of trumpets and silence made, the High Sheriff read the proclaiming titles to his bailiff, who repeated them aloud, and then, after many shouts of the people, his Majesty's health being drunk in a flint glass of a yard long, by the Sheriff, Commander, Officers, and chief Gentlemen, they all dispersed, and I returned. 
<p><num value="13">13</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> I passed a fine on selling of Honson Grange in Staffordshire, being about <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> per annum, which lying so great a distance, I thought fit to part with it to <num value="1">one</num> Burton, a farmer there. It came to me as part of my daughterin- law's portion, this being but a <num value="4">fourth</num> part of what was divided between the mother and <num value="3">three</num> sisters.

All the Privy Council, all the household, and all the Lords about town attended at the funeral.&rdquo;</note>

in a vault under Henry the <num value="7">Seventh</num>'s Chapel at Westminster, without any manner of pomp, and soon forgotten after all this vanity, and the face of the whole Court was exceedingly changed into a more solemn and moral behaviour; the new King affecting neither profaneness nor buffoonery. All the great officers broke their staves over the grave, according to form. 
<p><num value="15">15</num><hi rend=italics>th February.</hi> Dr. Tenison preached to the Household. The <num value="2">second</num> sermon should have been before the King; but he, to the great grief of his subjects, did now, for the <num value="1">first</num> time, go to mass publicly in the little Oratory at the Duke's lodgings, the doors being set wide open. 
<p><num value="16">16</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> I dined at Sir Robert Howard's, Auditor of the Exchequer, a gentleman pretending to all manner of arts and sciences, for which he had been the subject of comedy, under the name of Sir Positive;<note><p>Evelyn here means Sir Positive At-All, in Shadwell's comedy of the <hi rend=italics>Sullen Lovers</hi>, which Pepys also tells us was meant for Sir Robert Howard, Dryden's brother-in-law.</note> not ill-natured, but insufferably boasting. He was son to the late Earl of Berkshire.

<p>The Clerk of the Closet had shut up the late King's private oratory next the Privy-chamber above, but the King caused it to be opened again, and that prayers should be said as formerly.

<p><num value="5">5</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> To my grief, I saw the new pulpit set up in the Popish Oratory at Whitehall for the Lent preaching, mass being publicly said, and the Romanists swarming at Court with greater confidence than had ever been seen in England since the Reformation, so that everybody grew jealous as to what this would tend. 
<p>A Parliament was now summoned, and great industry used to obtain elections which might promote the Courtinterest, most of the Corporations being now, by their new charters, empowered to make what returns of members they pleased. 
<p>There came over divers envoys and great persons to condole the death of the late King, who were received by the Queen-Dowager on a bed of mourning, the whole chamber, ceiling and floor, hung with black, and tapers were lighted, so as nothing could be more lugubrious and solemn. The Queen-Consort sate under a state on a black foot-cloth, to entertain the circle (as the Queen used to do), and that very decently.

<note place=marg><datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct></note>
and there soon was found no hope of her recovery. A great affliction to me: but God's holy will be done! 
<p><num value="10">10</num><hi rend=italics>th March.</hi> She received the blessed Sacrament; after which, disposing herself to suffer what God should determine to inflict, she bore the remainder of her sickness with extraordinary patience and piety, and more than ordinary resignation and blessed frame of mind. She died the <num value="14">14th</num>, to our unspeakable sorrow and affliction, and not to our's only, but that of all who knew her, who were many of the best quality, greatest and most virtuous persons. The justness of her stature, person, comeliness of countenance, gracefulness of motion, unaffected, though more than ordinary beautiful, were the least of her ornaments compared with those of her mind. Of early piety, singularly religious, spending a part of every day in private devotion, reading, and other virtuous exercises; she had collected and written out many of the most useful and judicious periods of the books she read in a kind of common-place, as out of Dr. Hammond on the New Testament, and most of the best practical treatises. She had read and digested a considerable deal of history, and of places. The French tongue was as familiar to her as English; she understood Italian, and was able to render a laudable account of what she read and observed, to which assisted a most faithful memory and discernment; and she did make very prudent and discreet reflections upon what she had observed of the conversations among which she had at any time been, which being continually of persons of the best quality, she thereby improved. She had an excellent voice, to which she played a thorough-bass on the harpsichord, in both which she arrived to that perfection, that of the scholars of those <num value="2">two</num> famous masters, Signors Pietro and Bartholomeo, she was esteemed the best; for the sweetness of her voice and management of it added such an agreeableness to her countenance, without any constraint or concern, that when she sung, it was as charming to the eye as to the ear; this I rather note, because it was a universal remark, and for which so many noble and judicious persons in music desired to hear her, the last being at Lord Arundel's, of Wardour. 
<p>What shall I say, or rather not say, of the cheerfulness and agreeableness of her humour? condescending to the <pb id="p.224" n="224"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
meanest servant in the family, or others, she still kept up respect, without the least pride. She would often read to them, examine, instruct, and pray with them if they were sick, so as she was exceedingly beloved of everybody. Piety was so prevalent an ingredient in her constitution (as I may say), that even amongst equals and superiors she no sooner became intimately acquainted, but she would endeavour to improve them, by insinuating something religious, and that tended to bring them to a love of devotion; she had <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> confidants with whom she used to pass whole days in fasting, reading, and prayers, especially before the monthly communion, and other solemn occasions. She abhorred flattery, and, though she had abundance of wit, the raillery was so innocent and ingenious that it was most agreeable; she sometimes would see a play, but since the stage grew licentious, expressed herself weary of them, and the time spent at the theatre was an unaccountable vanity. She never played at cards without extreme importunity and for the company; but this was so very seldom, that I cannot number it among anything she could name a fault. 
<p>No <num value="1">one</num> could read prose or verse better or with more judgment; and as she read, so she wrote, not only most correct orthography, with that maturity of judgment and exactness of the periods, choice of expressions, and familiarity of style, that some letters of hers have astonished me and others, to whom she has occasionally written. She had a talent of rehearsing any comical part or poem, as to them she might be decently free with; was more pleasing than heard on the theatre; she danced with the greatest grace I had ever seen, and so would her master say, who was Monsieur Isaac; but she seldom showed that perfection, save in the gracefulness of her carriage, which was with an air of sprightly modesty not easily to be described. Nothing affected, but natural and easy as well in her deportment as in her discourse, which was always material, not trifling, and to which the extraordinary sweetness of her tone, even in familiar speaking, was very charming. Nothing was so pretty as her descending to play with little children, whom she would caress and humour with great delight. But she most affected to be with grave and sober men, of <pb id="p.225" n="225"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>.</note>
whom she might learn something, and improve herself. I have been assisted by her in reading and praying by me; comprehensive of uncommon notions, curious of knowing everything to some excess, had I not sometimes repressed it. 
<p>Nothing was so delightful to her as to go into my Study, where she would willingly have spent whole days<*>
for as I said she had read abundance of history, and all the best poets, even Terence, Plautus, Homer, Virgil, Horace, Ovid; all the best romances and modern poems; she could compose happily, and put in pretty symbols, as in the <hi rend=italics>Mundus Muliebris</hi>, wherein is an enumeration of the immense variety of the modes and ornaments belonging to the sex. But all these are vain trifles to the virtues which adorned her soul; she was sincerely religious, most dutiful to her parents, whom she loved with an affection tempered with great esteem, so as we were easy and free, and never were so well pleased as when she was with us, nor needed we other conversation; she was kind to her sisters, and was still improving them by her constant course of piety. Oh, dear, sweet, and desirable child, how shall I part with all this goodness and virtue without the bitterness of sorrow and reluctancy of a tender parent! Thy affection, duty, and love to me was that of a friend as well as a child. Nor less dear to thy mother, whose example and tender care of thee was unparalleled, nor was thy return to her less conspicuous; Oh! how she mourns thy loss! how desolate hast thou left us! To the grave shall we both carry thy memory! God alone (in whose bosom thou art at rest and happy!) give us to resign thee and all our contentments (for thou indeed wert all in this world) to His blessed pleasure! Let Him be glorified by our submission, and give us grace to bless Him for the graces he implanted in thee, thy virtuous life, pious and holy death, which is indeed the only comfort of our souls, hastening through the infinite love and mercy of the Lord Jesus to be shortly with thee, dear child, and with thee and those blessed saints like thee, glorify the Redeerner of the world to all eternity! Amen. 
<p>It was in the <num value="19">19th</num> year of her age that this sickness <pb id="p.226" n="226"> 
<note place=marg>SAYES COURT,</note>
happened to her. An accident contributed to this disease; she had an apprehension of it in particular, which struck her but <num value="2">two</num> days before she came home, by an imprudent gentlewoman whom she went with Lady Falkland to visit, who, after they had been a good while in the house, told them she had a servant sick of the small pox (who indeed died the next day); this my poor child acknowledged made an impression on her spirits. There were <num value="4">four</num> gentlemen of quality offering to treat with me about marriage, and I freely gave her her own choice, knowing her discretion. She showed great indifference to marrying at all, for truly, says she to her mother (the other day), were I assured of your life and my dear father's, never would I part from you; I love you and this home, where we serve God, above all things, nor ever shall I be so happy; I know and consider the vicissitudes of the world, I have some experience of its vanities, and but for decency more than inclination, and that you judge it expedient for me, I would not change my condition, but rather add the fortune you design me to my sisters, and keep up the reputation of our family. This was so discreetly and sincerely uttered that it could not but proceed from an extraordinary child, and <num value="1">one</num> who loved her parents beyond example. 
<p>At London, she took this fatal disease, and the occasion of her being there was this: my Lord Viscount Falkland's Lady having been our neighbour (as he was Treasurer of the Navy), she took so great an affection to my daughter, that when they went back in the autumn to the City, nothing would satisfy their incessant importunity but letting her accompany my Lady, and staying sometime with her; it was with the greatest reluctance I complied. Whilst she was there, my Lord being musical, when I saw my Lady would not part with her till Christmas, I was not unwilling she should improve the opportunity of learning of Signor Pietro, who had an admirable way both of composure and teaching. It was the end of February before I could prevail with my Lady to part with her; but my Lord going into Oxfordshire to stand for Knight of the Shire there, she expressed her wish to come home, being tired of the vain and empty conversation of the town, the theatres, the court and trifling visits which consumed so much precious time <pb id="p.227" n="227"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>.</note>
and made her sometimes miss of that regular course of piety that gave her the greatest satisfaction. She was weary of this life, and I think went not thrice to Court all this time, except when her mother or I carried her. She did not affect showing herself, she knew the Court well, and passed <num value="1">one</num> summer in it at Windsor with Lady Tuke, <num value="1">one</num> of the Queen's women of the bed-chamber (a most virtuous relation of hers); she was not fond of that glittering scene, now become abominably licentious, though there was a design of Lady Rochester and Lady Clarendon to have made her a maid of honour to the Queen as soon as there was a vacancy. But this she did not set her heart upon, nor indeed on any thing so much as the service of God, a quiet and regular life, and how she might improve herself in the most necessary accomplishments, and to which she was arrived at so great a measure. 
<p>This is the little history and imperfect character of my dear child, whose piety, virtue, and incomparable endowments deserve a monument more durable than brass and marble. Precious is the memorial of the just. Much I could enlarge on every period of this hasty account, but that I ease and discharge my overcoming passion for the present, so many things worthy an excellent Christian and dutiful child crowding upon me. Never can I say enough, oh dear, my dear child, whose memory is so precious to me! 
<p>This dear child was born at Wotton, in the same house and chamber in which I <num value="1">first</num> drew my breath, my wife having retired to my brother there in the great sickness that year upon the <num value="1">first</num> of that month, and the very hour that I was born, upon the last: viz. October. 
<p><num value="16">16</num><hi rend=italics>th March.</hi> She was interred in the south-east end of the church at Deptford, near her grandmother and several of my younger children and relations. My desire was she should have been carried and laid among my own parents and relations at Wotton, where I desire to be interred myself, when God shall call me out of this uncertain transitory life, but some circumstances did not permit it. Our vicar, Dr. Holden, preached her funeral sermon on Phil. i. <num value="21">21</num>. &ldquo;For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain,&rdquo; upon which he made an apposite discourse, as those who heard it <pb id="p.228" n="228"> 
<note place=marg>SAYES COURT,</note>
assured me (for grief suffered me not to be present), concluding with a modest recital of her many virtues and signal piety, so as to draw both tears and admiration from the hearers. I was not altogether unwilling that something of this sort should be spoken, for the edification and encouragement of other young people. 
<p>Divers noble persons honoured her funeral, some in person, others sending their coaches, of which there were <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num> with <num value="6">six</num> horses, viz., the Countess of Sunderland, Earl of Clarendon, Lord Godolphin, Sir Stephen Fox, Sir William Godolphin, Viscount Falkland, and others. There were distributed amongst her friends about <num value="60">sixty</num> rings. 
<p>Thus lived, died, and was buried the joy of my life, and ornament of her sex and of my poor family! God Almighty of His infinite mercy grant me the grace thankfully to resign myself and all I have, or had, to His divine pleasure, and in His good time, restoring health and comfort to my family: &ldquo;teach me so to number my days, that I may apply my heart to wisdom,&rdquo; be prepared for my dissolution, and that into the hands of my blessed Saviour I may recommend my spirit! Amen! 
<p>On looking into her closet, it is incredible what a number of collections she had made from historians, poets, travellers, &amp;c., but, above all, devotions, contemplations, and resolutions on these contemplations, found under her hand in a book most methodically disposed; prayers, meditations, and devotions on particular occasions, with many pretty letters to her confidants; <num value="1">one</num> to a divine (not named) to whom she writes that he would be her ghostly father, and would not despise her for her many errors and the imperfections of her youth, but beg of God to give her courage to acquaint him with all her faults, imploring his assistance and spiritual directions. I well remember she had often desired me to recommend her to such a person; but I did not think fit to do it as yet, seeing her apt to be scrupulous, and knowing the great innocency and integrity of her life. 
<p>It is astonishing how <num value="1">one</num> who had acquired such substantial and practical knowledge in other ornamental parts of education, especially music, both vocal and instrumental, in dancing, paying and receiving visits, and necessary conversation, could accomplish half of what she has left; but, <pb id="p.229" n="229"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>.</note>
as she never affected play or cards, which consume a world of precious time, so she was in continual exercise, which yet abated nothing of her most agreeable conversation. But she was a little miracle while she lived, and so she died! 
<p><num value="26">26</num><hi rend=italics>th March.</hi> I was invited to the funeral of Captain Gunman, that excellent pilot and seaman, who had behaved himself so gallantly in the Dutch war. He died of a gangrene, occasioned by his fall from the pier of Calais. This was the Captain of the yacht carrying the Duke (now King) to Scotland, and was accused for not giving timely warning when she split on the sands, where so many perished; but I am most confident he was no ways guilty, either of negligence, or design, as he made appear not only at the examination of the matter of fact, but in the Vindication he showed me, and which must needs give any man of reason satisfaction. He was a sober, frugal, cheerful, and temperate man; we have few such seamen left. 
<p><num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>th April.</hi> Being now somewhat composed after my great affliction, I went to London to hear Dr. Tenison (it being on a Wednesday in Lent) at Whitehall. I observed that though the King was not in his seat above in the chapel, the Doctor made his <num value="3">three</num> congees, which they were not used to do when the late King was absent, making then <num value="1">one</num> bowing only. I asked the reason; it was said he had a special order so to do. The Princess of Denmark was in the King's closet, but sate on the left hand of the chair, the Clerk of the Closet standing by his Majesty's chair, as if he had been present. 
<p>I met the Queen-Dowager going now <num value="1">first</num> from White hall to dwell at Somerset-house. 
<p>This day my brother of Wotton and Mr. Onslow were candidates for Surrey against Sir Adam Brown and my cousin Sir Edward Evelyn, and were circumvented in their election by a trick of the Sheriff's,<note><p>Mr. Samuel Lewen. His name does not appear in the History of Surrey among the land-owners of the county, but it is stated that in <datestruct value="1709--"><year reg="1709">1709</year></datestruct> Sir William Lewen purchased the Rectory of Ewell, and that he was Lord Mayor of London in <datestruct value="1717--"><year reg="1717">1717</year></datestruct>.</note> taking advantage of my brother's party going out of the small village of Leatherhead to seek shelter and lodging, the afternoon being tempestuous, proceeding to the election when they were gone; they ex- <pb id="p.230" n="230"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON</note>
pecting the next morning; whereas before and then they exceeded the other party by many hundreds, as I am assured. The Duke of Norfolk led Sir Edward Evelyn's and Sir Adam Brown's party. For this parliament, very mean and slight persons (some of them gentlemen's servants, clerks, and persons neither of reputation nor interest) were set up; but the country would choose my brother whether he would or no, and he missed it by the trick above-mentioned. Sir Adam Brown was so deaf, that he could not hear <num value="1">one</num> word. Sir Edward Evelyn<note><p>His seat was at Long Ditton, near Kingston, which town had surrendered its charter to King Charles II. about a month before his death. King James appointed Sir Edward Evelyn <num value="1">one</num> of the new corporation.</note> was an honest gentleman, much in favour with his Majesty. 
<p><num value="10">10</num><hi rend=italics>th April.</hi> I went early to Whitehall to hear Dr. Tillotson, Dean of Canterbury, preaching on Eccles. ix. <num value="18">18</num>. I returned in the evening, and visited Lady Tuke, and found with her Sir George Wakeman, the physician, whom I had seen tried and acquitted,<note><hi rend=italics>Ante</hi>, p. <num value="139">139</num>.</note> amongst the plotters for poisoning the late King, on the accusation of the famous Oates; and surely I believed him guiltless. 
<p><num value="14">14</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> According to my custom, I went to London to pass the holy week. 
<p><num value="17">17</num><hi rend=italics>th. Good Friday.</hi> Dr. Tenison preached at the new church at St. James's, on <num value="1">1</num> Cor. xvi. <num value="22">22</num>, upon the infinite love of God to us, which he illustrated in many instances. The Holy Sacrament followed, at which I participated. The Lord make me thankful! In the afternoon, Dr. Sprat, Bishop of Rochester, preached in Whitehall chapel, the auditory very full of Lords, the <num value="2">two</num> Archbishops, and many others, now drawn to town upon occasion of the coronation and ensuing parliament. I supped with the Countess of Sunderland and Lord Godolphin, and returned home. 
<p><num value="23">23</num><hi rend=italics>rd.</hi> Was the coronation of the King and Queen. The solemnity was magnificent as is set forth in print.<note><p>By Francis Sandford, illustrated with engravings, folio.</note> The Bishop of Ely preached; but, to the sorrow of the people, no Sacrament, as ought to have been. However, the King <pb id="p.231" n="231"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>.</note>
begins his reign with great expectations, and hopes of much reformation as to the late vices and profaneness of both Court and country. Having been present at the late King's coronation, I was not ambitious of seeing this ceremony. 
<p><num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>rd May.</hi> A young man preached, going chaplain with Sir J. Wiburn, Governor of Bombay, in the East Indies. 
<p><num value="7">7</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> I was in Westminster Hall when Oates, who had made such a stir in the kingdom, on his revealing a plot of the Papists, and alarmed several parliaments, and had occasioned the execution of divers priests, noblemen,<note><hi rend=italics>Ante</hi>, p. <num value="140">140</num>.</note> &amp;c., was tried for perjury at the King's Bench; but, being very tedious, I did not endeavour to see the issue, considering that it would be published. Abundance of Roman Catholics were in the Hall in expectation of the most grateful conviction and ruin of a person who had been so obnoxious to them, and, as I verily believe, had done much mischief and great injury to several by his violent and ill-grounded proceedings; whilst he was at <num value="1">first</num> so unreasonably blown up and encouraged, that his insolence was no longer sufferable. 
<p>Mr. Roger L&lsquo;Estrange (a gentleman whom I had long known, and a person of excellent parts, abating some affectations) appearing <num value="1">first</num> against the Dissenters in several Tracts, had now for some years turned his style against those whom (by way of hateful distinction) they called Whigs and Trimmers, under the title of Observator, which came out <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> days every week, in which sheets, under pretence to serve the Church of England, he gave suspicion of gratifying another party, by several passages which rather kept up animosities than appeased them, especially now that nobody gave the least occasion.<note><p>In the <num value="1">first</num> Dutch war, while Evelyn was <num value="1">one</num> of the Commissioners for sick and wounded, L&lsquo;Estrange in his Gazette mentioned the barbarous usage of the Dutch prisoners of war: whereupon Evelyn wrote him a very spirited letter, desiring that the Dutch Ambassador (who was then in England) and his friends would visit the prisoners, and examine their provisions; and he required L&lsquo;Estrange to publish that vindication in his next number.</note>

In the meantime, elections for the ensuing parliament in England were thought to be very indirectly carried on in most places. God grant a better issue of it than some expect!

<p><num value="21">21</num><hi rend=italics>st.</hi> I dined at my Lord Privy Seal's with Sir William Dugdale, Garter King-at-Arms, author of the <hi rend=italics>Monasticon</hi>

<p><num value="22">22</num><hi rend=italics>nd.</hi> In the morning, I went with a French gentleman, and my Lord Privy Seal, to the House of Lords, where we were placed by his Lordship next the Bar, just below the Bishops, very commodiously both for hearing and seeing. After a short space, came in the Queen and Princess of Denmark, and stood next above the Archbishops, at the side of the House on the right hand of the throne. In the interim, divers of the Lords, who had not finished before, took the test and usual oaths, so that her Majesty, the Spanish and other Ambassadors, who stood behind the throne, heard the Pope and the worship of the Virgin Mary, &amp;c., renounced very decently, as likewise the prayers which followed, standing all the while. Then came in the King, the crown on his head, and being seated, the Commons were introduced, and the House being full, he drew forth a paper containing his speech, which he read distinctly enough, to this effect: &ldquo;That he resolved to call a Parliament from the moment of his brother's decease, as the best means to settle all the concerns of the nation, so as to be most easy and happy to himself and his subjects; <pb id="p.233" n="233"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>.</note>
that he would confirm whatever he had said in his declaration at the <num value="1">first</num> Council concerning his opinion of the principles of the Church of England, for their loyalty, and would defend and support it, and preserve its government as by law now established; that, as he would invade no man's property, so he would never depart from his own prerogative; and, as he had ventured his life in defence of the nation, so he would proceed to do still; that, having given this assurance of his care of our religion (his word was <hi rend=italics>your</hi> religion) and property (which he had not said by chance, but solemnly), so he doubted not of suitable returns of his subjects' duty and kindness, especially as to settling his revenue for life, for the many weighty necessities of government, which he would not suffer to be precarious; that some might possibly suggest that it were better to feed and supply him from time to time only, out of their inclination to frequent parliaments; but that that would be a very improper method to take with him, since the best way to engage him to meet oftener would be always to use him well, and therefore he expected their compliance speedily, that this session being but short, they might meet again to satisfaction.&rdquo; 
<p>At every period of this, the House gave loud shouts. Then he acquainted them with that morning's news of Argyle's being landed in the West Highlands of Scotland from Holland, and the treasonous Declaration he had published, which he would communicate to them, and that he should take the best care he could it should meet with the reward it deserved, not questioning the parliament's zeal and readiness to assist him as he desired; at which there followed another <hi rend=italics>Vive le Roi</hi>, and so his Majesty retired. 
<p>So soon as the Commons were returned and had put themselves into a grand committee, they immediately put the question, and unanimously voted the revenue to his Majesty for life. Mr. Seymour made a bold speech against many elections, and would have had those members who (he pretended) were obnoxious, to withdraw, till they had cleared the matter of their being legally returned; but no <num value="1">one</num> seconded him. The truth is, there were many of the new members whose elections and returns were universally <pb id="p.234" n="234"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
censured, many of them being persons of no condition, or interest, in the nation, or places for which they served, especially in Devon, Cornwall, Norfolk, &amp;c., said to have been recommended by the Court, and from the effect of the new charters changing the electors. It was reported that Lord Bath carried down with him [into Cornwall] no fewer than <num value="15">fifteen</num> charters, so that some called him the Prince Elector: whence Seymour told the House in his speech that if this was digested, they might introduce what religion and laws they pleased, and that though he never gave heed to the fears and jealousies of the people before, he was now really apprehensive of Popery. By the printed list of members of <num value="505">505</num>, there did not appear to be above <num value="135">135</num> who had been in former Parliaments, especially that lately held at Oxford. 
<p>In the Lords' House, Lord Newport made an exception against <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> young Peers, who wanted some months, and some only <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> days, of being of age. 
<p>The Popish Lords, who had been sometime before released from their confinement about the plot, were now discharged of their impeachment, of which I gave Lord Arundel of Wardour joy. 
<p>Oates, who had but <num value="2">two</num> days before been pilloried at several places and whipped at the cart's tail from Newgate to Aldgate, was this day placed on a sledge, being not able to go by reason of so late scourging, and dragged from prison to Tyburn, and whipped again all the way, which some thought to be severe and extraordinary; but, if he was guilty of the perjuries, and so of the death of many innocents, (as I fear he was,) his punishment was but what he deserved. I chanced to pass just as execution was doing on him. A strange revolution! 
<p>Note: there was no speech made by the Lord Keeper [Bridgman] after his Majesty, as usual. 
<p>It was whispered he would not be long in that situation, and many believe the bold Chief Justice Jefferies, who was made Baron of Wem, in Shropshire, and who went thorough stitch in that tribunal, stands fair for that office. I gave him joy the morning before of his new honour, he having always been very civil to me.

In some places, they were <num value="30">thirty</num> leagues from any minister, or opportunity of worship. This persecution had displeased the most industrious part of the nation, and dispersed those into Switzerland, Burgundy, Holland, Germany, Denmark, England, and the Plantations. There were with Sir Gabriel, his lady, Sir William Godolphin and sisters, and my Lord Godolphin's little son, my charge. I brought them to the water-side where Sir Gabriel embarked, and the rest returned to London. 
<p><num value="14">14</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> There was now certain intelligence of the Duke of Monmouth landing at Lyme, in Dorsetshire, and of his having set up his standard as King of England. I pray God deliver us from the confusion which these beginnings threaten!

<p><num value="17">17</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> The Duke landed with but <num value="150">150</num> men; but the whole kingdom was alarmed, fearing that the disaffected would join them, many of the trained bands flocking to him.

This declaration was ordered to be burnt by the hangman, the Duke proclaimed a traitor, and a reward of <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5000</num></measure> to any who should kill him.

It seems the Horse, commanded by Lord Grey, being newly raised and undisciplined, were not to be brought in so short a time to endure the fire, which exposed the Foot to the King's, so as when Monmouth had led the Foot in great silence and order, thinking to surprise Lieutenant-General Lord Feversham newly encamped, and given him a smart charge, interchanging both great and small shot, the Horse, breaking their own ranks, Monmouth gave it over, and fled with Grey, leaving their party to be cut in pieces to the number of <num value="2000">2000</num>. The whole number reported to be above <num value="8000">8000</num>; the King's but <num value="2700">2700</num>. The slain were most of them 
<hi rend=italics>Mendip-miners</hi>, who did great execution with their tools, and sold their lives very dearly, whilst their leaders flying were pursued and taken the next morning, not far from <num value="1">one</num> another. Monmouth had gone <num value="16">sixteen</num> miles on foot, changing his habit for a poor coat, and was found by Lord Lumley in a dry ditch covered with fern-brakes, but without sword, pistol, or any weapon, and so might have passed for some countryman, his beard being grown so long and so gray as hardly to be known, had not his George discovered him, which was found in his pocket. It is said he trembled exceedingly all over, not able to speak. Grey was taken not far from him. Most of his party were Anabaptists and poor cloth-workers of the country, no gentlemen of account being come in to him. The arch-<hi rend=italics>boutefeu</hi>, Ferguson, Matthews, &amp;c., were not yet found.

The battle ended, some words, <num value="1">first</num> in jest, then in passion, passed between Sherrington Talbot (a worthy gentleman, son to Sir John Talbot, and who had behaved himself very handsomely) and <num value="1">one</num> Captain Love, both commanders of the militia, as to whose soldiers fought best, both drawing their swords and passing at <num value="1">one</num> another. Sherrington was wounded to death on the spot, to the great regret of those who knew him. He was Sir John's only son. 
<p><num value="9">9</num><hi rend=italics>th July.</hi> Just as I was coming into the lodgings at Whitehall, a little before dinner, my Lord of Devonshire standing very near His Majesty's bedchamber-door in the lobby, came Colonel Culpeper, and in a rude manner looking at my Lord in the face, asked whether this was a time and place for excluders to appear; my Lord at <num value="1">first</num> took little notice of what he said, knowing him to be a hotheaded fellow, but he reiterating it, my Lord asked Culpeper whether he meant him; he said yes, he meant his Lordship. My Lord told him he was no excluder (as indeed he was not); the other affirming it again, my Lord told him he lied; on which Culpeper struck him a box on the ear, which my Lord returned, and felled him. They were soon parted, Culpeper was seized, and his Majesty, who was all the while in his bedchamber, ordered him to be carried to the Green-Cloth Officer, who sent him to the Marshalsea, as he deserved. My Lord Devon had nothing said to him. 
<p>I supped this night at Lambeth at my old friend's Mr. Elias Ashmole's, with my Lady Clarendon, the Bishop of St. Asaph, and Dr. Tenison, when we were treated at a great feast.

<p><num value="15">15</num><hi rend=italics>th July.</hi> I went to see Dr. Tenison's library [in St. Martin's]. 
<p>Monmouth was this day brought to London and examined before the King, to whom he made great submission, acknowledged his seduction by Ferguson, the Scot, whom he named the bloody villain. He was sent to the Tower, had an interview with his late Duchess, whom he received coldly, having lived dishonestly with the Lady Henrietta Wentworth for <num value="2">two</num> years. He obstinately asserted his conversation with that debauched woman to be no sin; whereupon, seeing he could not be persuaded to his last breath, the divines who were sent to assist him thought not fit to administer the Holy Communion to him. For the rest of his faults he professed great sorrow, and so died without any apparent fear. He would not make use of a cap or other circumstance, but lying down, bid the fellow to do his office better than to the late Lord Russell, and gave him gold; but the wretch made <num value="5">five</num> chops before he had his head off; which so incensed the people, that had he not been guarded and got away, they would have torn him to pieces. 
<p>The Duke made no speech on the scaffold (which was on Tower-Hill), but gave a paper containing not above <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> lines, for the King, in which he disclaims all title to the Crown, acknowledges that the late King, his father, had indeed told him he was but his base son, and so desired his Majesty to be kind to his wife and children. This relation I had from Dr. Tenison (Rector of St. Martin's), who, with the Bishops of Ely and Bath and Wells, were sent to him by his Majesty, and were at the execution. 
<p>Thus ended this quondam Duke, darling of his father and the ladies, being extremely handsome and adroit; an <pb id="p.239" n="239">

excellent soldier and dancer, a favourite of the people, of an easy nature, debauched by lust; seduced by crafty knaves, who would have set him up only to make a property, and taken the opportunity of the King being of another religion, to gather a party of discontented men. He failed, and perished. 
<p>He was a lovely person, had a virtuous and excellent lady that brought him great riches, and a <num value="2">second</num> dukedom in Scotland. He was Master of the Horse, General of the King his father's army, Gentleman of the Bed-chamber, Knight of the Garter, Chancellor of Cambridge; in a word, had accumulations without end. See what ambition and want of principles brought him to! He was beheaded on Tuesday, <datestruct VALUE="-07-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>. His mother, whose name was Barlow, daughter of some very mean creatures, was a beautiful strumpet, whom I had often seen at Paris; she died miserably without anything to bury her; yet this Perkin had been made to believe that the King had married her, a monstrous and ridiculous forgery! And to satisfy the world of the iniquity of the report, the King his father (if his father he really was, for he most resembled <num value="1">one</num> Sidney<note><p>Mr. Robert Sydney, commonly called handsome Sydney, related to the Earl of Leicester of that name.</note> who was familiar with his mother) publicly and most solemnly renounced it, to be so entered in the Council Book some years since, with all the Privy Councillors' attestation.<note><p>The 
<hi rend=italics>Life of James the <num value="2">Second</num></hi> contains an account of the circumstances of the Duke of Monmouth's birth, which may be given in illustration of the statements of the text. Ross, tutor to the Duke of Monmouth, is there said to have proposed to Bishop Cosins to sign a certificate of the king's marriage to Mrs. Barlow, though her own name was Walters: but this the Bishop refused. She was born of a gentleman's family in Wales, but having little means and less grace, came to London to make her fortune. Algernon Sydney, then a Colonel in Cromwell's army, had agreed to give her <num value="50">fifty</num> broad pieces (as he told the Duke of York); but being ordered hastily away with his regiment, he missed his bargain. She went into Holland, where she fell into the hands of his brother, Colonel Robert Sydney, who kept her for some time, till the king hearing of her, got her from him. On which the Colonel was heard to say, Let who will have her, she is already sped; and, after being with the king, she was so soon with child, that the world had no cause to doubt whose child it was, and the rather that when he grew to be a man, he very much resembled the colonel both in stature and countenance, even to a wart on his face. However, the king owned the child. In the king's absence, she behaved so loosely, that on his return from his escape at Worcester he would have no further commerce with her, and she became a common prostitute at Paris.</note>

<p>Had it not pleased God to dissipate this attempt in the beginning, there would in all appearance have gathered an irresistible force which would have desperately proceeded to the ruin of the Church and Government; so general was the discontent and expectation of the opportunity. For my own part, I looked upon this deliverance as most signal. Such an inundation of fanatics and men of impious principles must needs have caused universal disorder, cruelty, injustice, rapine, sacrilege, and confusion, an unavoidable civil war, and misery without end. Blessed be God, the knot was happily broken, and a fair prospect of tranquillity for the future, if we reform, be thankful, and make a right use of this mercy!

<p>By a gross mistake of the Secretary of his Majesty's Forces, it had been ordered that they should be quartered in private houses, contrary to an Act of Parliament, but, on my informing his Majesty timely of it, it was prevented.

What was very ingenious was the subterranean heat, conveyed by a stove under the conservatory, all vaulted with brick, so as he has the doors and windows open in the hardest frosts, secluding only the snow.

I told him how sensible I was of his Majesty's gracious favour to me, that I would endeavour to serve him with all sincerity, diligence, and loyalty, not more out of my duty than inclination. He said he doubted not of it, and was glad he had the opportunity to show me the kindness he had for me. After this, came abundance of great men to give me joy.

Dr. Standish.

Then I went to hear a Frenchman who preached before the King and Queen in that splendid chapel next St. George's Hall. Their Majesties going to mass, I withdrew to consider the stupendous painting of the Hall, which, both for the art and invention, deserve the inscription in honour of the painter, Signor Verrio. The history is Edward the <num value="3">Third</num> receiving the Black Prince, coming towards him in a Roman triumph. The whole roof is the history of St. George. The throne, the carvings, &amp;c. are incomparable, and I think equal to any, and in many circumstances exceeding any, I have seen abroad. 
<p>I dined at Lord Sunderland's, with (amongst others) Sir William Soames, designed Ambassador to Constantinople. 
<p>About <num value="6">6</num> o'clock, came Sir Dudley and his brother Roger North, and brought the Great Seal from my Lord Keeper, who died the day before at his house in Oxfordshire. The King went immediately to council; everybody guessing who was most likely to succeed this great officer; most believing it could be no other than my Lord Chief Justice Jefferies, who had so vigorously prosecuted the late rebels, and was now gone the Western Circuit, to punish the rest that were secured in the several counties, and was now near upon his return. I took my leave of his Majesty, who spake very graciously to me, and supping that night at Sir Stephen Fox's, I promised to dine there the next day.

panion, I returned to our inn, after she had showed me her house, which was very commodious, and well-furnished, as she was an excellent house-wife, a prudent and virtuous lady. There is a park full of red deer about it. Her eldest son was now sick there of the small-pox, but in a likely way of recovery, and other of her children run about, and among the infected, which she said she let them do on purpose that they might whilst young pass that fatal disease she fancied they were to undergo <num value="1">one</num> time or other, and that this would be the best: the severity of this cruel distemper so lately in my poor family confirming much of what she affirmed. 
<p><num value="16">16</num><hi rend=italics>th September.</hi> The next morning, setting out early, we arrived soon enough at Winchester to wait on the King, who was lodged at the Dean's (Dr. Meggot). I found very few with him besides my Lords Feversham, Arran, Newport, and the Bishop of Bath and Wells. His Majesty was discoursing with the Bishops concerning miracles, and what strange things the Saludadors<note><p>Evelyn subjoins this note:&mdash;&ldquo;As to that of the Saludador (of which likewise I remember Sir Arthur Hopton, formerly Ambassador at Madrid, had told me many like wonders), Mr. Pepys passing through Spain, and being extremely inquisitive of the truth of these pretended miracles of the Saludadors, found a very famous <num value="1">one</num> at last, to whom he offered a considerable reward if he would make a trial of the oven, or any other thing of that kind, before him; the fellow ingenuously told him, that finding he was a more than ordinary curious person, he would not deceive him, and so acknowledged that he could do none of the feats really, but that what they pretended was all a cheat, which 
<*>e would easily discover, though the poor superstitious people were easily imposed upon; yet have these impostors an allowance of the Bishops to practice their jugglings. This Mr. Pepys affirmed to me; out, said he, I did not conceive it fit to interrupt his Majesty, who so solemnly told what they pretended to do. J.E.&rdquo;</note> would do in Spain, as by creeping into heated ovens without hurt, and that they had a black cross in the roof of their mouths, but yet were commonly notorious and profane wretches; upon which his Majesty further said, that he was so extremely difficult of miracles, for fear of being imposed upon, that if he should chance to see <num value="1">one</num> himself, without some other witness, he should apprehend it a delusion of his senses. Then they spake of the boy who was pretended to have a wanting leg restored him, so confidently asserted by Fr. de Santa Clara <pb id="p.244" n="244"> 
<note place=marg>WINCHESTER,</note>
and others. To all which the Bishop added a great miracle happening in Winchester to his certain knowledge, of a poor miserably sick and decrepit child (as I remember long kept unbaptized), who, immediately on his baptism, recovered; as also of the salutary effect of King Charles his Majesty's father's blood, in healing <num value="1">one</num> that was blind. 
<p>There was something said of the <num value="2">second</num> sight<note><p>Several very curious letters on this subject are printed in <hi rend=italics>Pepys' Diary</hi>, edited by Lord Braybrooke, published by Mr. Bohn.</note> happening to some persons, especially Scotch; upon which his Majesty, and I think Lord Arran, told us that Monsieur . . . . . . a French nobleman, lately here in England, seeing the late Duke of Monmouth come into the playhouse at London, suddenly cried out to somebody sitting in the same box, 
<hi rend=italics>Voil&agrave; Monsieur comme il entre sans t&ecirc;te!</hi> Afterwards his Majesty spoke of some relies that had effected strange cures, particularly a piece of our blessed Saviour's cross, that healed a gentleman's rotten nose by only touching. And speaking of the golden cross and chain taken out of the coffin of St. Edward the Confessor at Westminster,<note><p>See a Narrative on the same subject among the Illustrations at the and of this volume.</note> by <num value="1">one</num> of the singing-men, who, as the scaffolds were taken down after his Majesty's coronation, espying a hole in the tomb, and something glisten, put his hand in, and brought it to the dean, and he to the King; his Majesty began to put the Bishop in mind how earnestly the late King (his brother) called upon him during his agony, to take out what he had in his pocket. I had thought, said the King, it had been for some keys, which might lead to some cabinet that his Majesty would have me secure; but, says he, you well remember that I found nothing in any of his pockets but a cross of gold, and a few insignificant papers; and thereupon he showed us the cross, and was pleased to put it into my hand. It was of gold, about <num value="3">three</num> inches long, having on <num value="1">one</num> side a crucifix enamelled and embossed, the rest was graved and garnished with goldsmiths' work, and <num value="2">two</num> pretty broad table amethysts (as I conceived), and at the bottom a pendant pearl; within was enchased a little fragment, as was thought, of the true cross, and a Latin inscription in <pb id="p.245" n="245">

gold and Roman Letters.<note><p>There is a pamphlet giving an account of this finding and presenting to the King, under the name of George Taylour; but the writer's name was Henry Keepe. See <hi rend=italics>Gough's Topography.</hi></note> More company coming in, this discourse ended. I may not forget a resolution which his Majesty made, and had a little before entered upon it at the Council Board at Windsor or Whitehall, that the negroes in the Plantations should all be baptized, exceedingly declaiming against that impiety of their masters prohibiting it, out of a mistaken opinion that they would be <hi rend=italics>ipso facto</hi> free; but his Majesty persists in his resolution to have them christened, which piety the Bishop blessed him for. 
<p>I went out to see the new palace the late King had begun, and brought almost to the covering. It is placed on the side of the hill, where formerly stood the old Castle. It is a stately fabrie, of <num value="3">three</num> sides and a corridor, all built of brick, and cornished, windows and columns at the break and entrance of free-stone.<note><p>The <num value="1">first</num> stone of this palace was laid by <datestruct VALUE="1683-03-23"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=23>23</day>, <year reg=1683>1683</year></datestruct>, by King Charles in person, who, during the remainder of his reign, spent most of his time at Winchester, for the purpose of inspecting and forwarding the work. Upon Charles's death, an immediate stop was put to the building by James II. It was equally neglected by King William; but Queen Anne, after surveying it herself, intended to complete it in favour of her husband, George, Prince of Denmark, upon whom it was settled, had he lived until she could afford the sums necessary for this purpose. The <num value="1">first</num> public use to which it appears to have been applied, was that of a place of confinement for French prisoners in the war of <datestruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>, during which <num value="5000">5,000</num> of them, at a time, were occasionally detained in it. In the year <datestruct value="1792"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>, it was occupied by a certain number of French clergy banished from their native soil; and, in <datestruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>, it was fitted up as barracks for the residence of troops, to which purpose it is still applied.</note> It was intended for a huntinghouse when his Majesty should come to these parts, and has an incomparable prospect. I believe there had already been <measure value="20000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure> and more expended; but his now Majesty did not seem to encourage the finishing it at least for a while. 
<p>Hence to see the Cathedral, a reverend pile, and in good repair. There are still the coffins of the <num value="6">six</num> Saxon Kings, whose bones had been seattered by the sacrilegious rebels of <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>, in expectation, I suppose, of finding some valuable relies, and afterwards gathered up again and put into new chests, which stand above the stalls of the choir. <pb id="p.246" n="246"> 
<note place=marg>PORTSMOUTH,</note>

<p><num value="17">17</num><hi rend=italics>th September.</hi> Early next morning, we went to Portsmouth, something before his Majesty arrived. We found all the road full of people, the women in their best dress, in expectation of seeing the King pass by, which he did, riding on horseback a good part of the way. The Mayor and Aldermen with their mace, and in their formalities, were standing at the entrance of the fort, a mile on this side of the town, where the Mayor made a speech to the King, and then the guns of the fort were fired, as were those of the garrison, as soon as the King was come into Portsmouth. All the soldiers (near <num value="3000">3,000</num>) were drawn up, and lining the streets and platform to God's-house (the name of the Governor's residence), where, after he had viewed the new fortifications and ship-yard, his Majesty was entertained at a magnificent dinner by Sir . . . . . . . Slingsby, the Lieutenant-Governor, all the gentlemen in his train sitting down at table with him, which I also had done had I not been before engaged to Sir Robert Holmes, Governor of the Isle of Wight, to dine with him at a private house, where likewise we had a very sumptuous and plentiful repast of excellent venison, fowl, fish, and fruit. 
<p>After dinner, I went to wait on his Majesty again, who was pulling on his boots in the Town-hall adjoing the house where he dined, and then having saluted some ladies, who came to kiss his hand, he took horse for Winchester, whither he returned that night. This hall is artificially hung round with arms of all sorts, like the hall and keep at Windsor. Hence, to see the ship-yard and dock, the fortifications, and other things. 
<p>Portsmouth, when finished, will be very strong, and a noble quay. There were now <num value="32">thirty-two</num> men-of-war in the harbour. I was invited by Sir R. Beach, the Commissioner, where, after a great supper, Mr. Secretary and myself lay that night, and the next morning set out for Guildford, where we arrived in good hour, and so the day after to London. 
<p>I had twice before been at Portsmouth, the Isle of Wight, &amp;c., many years since. I found this part of Hampshire bravely wooded, especially about the house and estate of Colonel Norton, who though now in being, having formerly made his peace by means of Colonel Legg, was formerly a <pb id="p.247" n="247"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>.</note>
very fierce commander in the <num value="1">first</num> Rebellion. His house is large, and standing low, on the road from Winchester to Portsmouth. 
<p>By what I observed in this journey, is that infinite industry, sedulity, gravity, and great understanding and experience of affairs, in his Majesty, that I cannot but predict much happiness to the nation, as to its political government; and, if he so persist, there could be nothing more desired to accomplish our prosperity, but that he was of the national religion. 
<p><num value="30">30</num><hi rend=italics>th September.</hi> Lord Clarendon's commission for Lieutenant of Ireland was sealed this day. 
<p><num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>nd October.</hi> Having a letter sent me by Mr. Pepys with this expression at the foot of it, &ldquo;I have something to show you that I may not have another time,&rdquo; and that I would not fail to dine with him, I accordingly went. After dinner, he had me and Mr. Houblon (a rich and considerable merchant, whose father had fled out of Flanders on the persecution of the Duke of Alva) into a private room, and told us that being lately alone with his Majesty, and upon some occasion of speaking concerning my late Lord Arlington dying a Roman Catholic, who had all along seemed to profess himself a Protestant, taken all the tests, &amp;c., till the day (I think) of his death, his Majesty said that as to his inclinations he had known them long wavering, but from fear of losing his places, he did not think it convenient to declare himself. There are, says the King, those who believe the Church of Rome gives dispensations for going to church, and many like things, but that is not so; for if that might have been had, he himself had most reason to make use of it. <hi rend=italics>Indeed,</hi> he said, as to <hi rend=italics>some matrimonial cases, there are now and then dispensations</hi>, but hardly in any cases else. 
<p>This familiar discourse encouraged Mr. Pepys to beg of his Majesty, if he might ask it without offence, and for that his Majesty could not but observe how it was whispered among many whether his late Majesty had been reconciled to the Church of Rome; he again humbly besought his Majesty to pardon his presumption, if he had touched upon a thing which did not befit him to look into. The King ingenuously told him that he both was and died a Roman <pb id="p.248" n="248"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
Catholic, and that he had not long since declared it was upon some politic and state reasons, best known to himself (meaning the King his brother), but that he was of that persuasion: he bid him follow him into his closet, where opening a cabinet, he showed him <num value="2">two</num> papers, containing about a quarter of a sheet, on both sides written, in the late King's own hand, several arguments opposite to the doctrine of the Church of England, charging her with heresy, novelty, and the fanaticism of other Protestants, the chief whereof was, as I remember, our refusing to acknowledge the primacy and infallibility of the Church of Rome; how impossible it was that so many ages should never dispute it, till of late; how unlikely our Saviour would leave his Church without a visible Head and guide to resort to, during his absence; with the like usual topic; so well penned as to the discourse as did by no means seem to me to have been put together by the late King, yet written all with his own hand, blotted and interlined, so as, if indeed it was not given him by some priest, they might be such arguments and reasons as had been inculcated from time to time, and here recollected; and, in the conclusion, showing his looking on the Protestant religion (and by name the Church of England) to be without foundation, and consequently false and unsafe. When his Majesty had shown him these originals, he was pleased to lend him the copies of these <num value="2">two</num> papers, attested at the bottom in <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> lines under his own hand. 
<p>These were the papers I saw and read. This nice and curious passage I thought fit to set down. Though all the arguments and objections were altogether weak, and have a <num value="1000">thousand</num> times been answered by our divines; they are such as their priests insinuate among their proselytes, as if nothing were Catholic but the Church of Rome, no salvation out of that, no reformation sufferable, bottoming all their errors on St. Peter's successors' unerrable dictatorship, but proving nothing with any reason, or taking notice of any objection which could be made against it. Here all was taken for granted, and upon it a resolution and preference implied. 
<p>I was heartily sorry to see all this, though it was no other than was to be suspected, by his late Majesty's too great indif- <pb id="p.249" n="249"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>.</note>
ference, neglect, and course of life, that he had been perverted, and for secular respects only professed to be of another belief, and thereby giving great advantage to our adversaries, both the Court and generally the youth and great persons of the nation becoming dissolute and highly profane. God was incensed to make his reign very troublesome and uprosperous, by wars, plagues, fires, loss of reputation by an universal neglect of the public for the love of a voluptuous and sensual life, which a vicious Court had brought into credit. I think of it with sorrow and pity, when I consider how good and debonair a nature that unhappy Prince was; what opportunities he had to have made himself the most renowned King that ever swayed the British seeptre, had he been firm to that Church for which his martyred and blessed father suffered; and had he been grateful to Almighty God, who so miraculously restored him, with so excellent a religion; had he endeavoured to own and propagate it as he should have done, not only for the good of his Kingdom, but of all the Reformed Churches in Christendom, now weakened and near ruined through our remissness and suffering them to be supplanted, persecuted, and destroyed, as in France, which we took no notice of. The consequence of this, time will show, and I wish it may proceed no further. The emissaries and instruments of the Church of Rome will never rest till they have crushed the Church of England, as knowing that alone to be able to cope with them, and that they can never answer her fairly, but lie abundantly open to the irresistible force of her arguments, antiquity and purity of her doctrine, so that albeit it may move God, for the punishment of a nation so unworthy, to eclipse again the profession of her here, and darkness and superstition prevail, I am most confident the doctrine of the Church of England will never be extinguished, but remain visible, if not eminent, to the consummation of the world. I have innumerable reasons that confirm me in this opinion, which I forbear to mention here. 
<p>In the mean time, as to the discourse of his Majesty with Mr. Pepys, and those papers, as I do exceedingly prefer his Majesty's free and ingenuous profession of what his own religion is, beyond concealment upon any politic accounts, so I think him of a most sincere and honest <pb id="p.250" n="250"> 
<note place=marg>SWALLOWFIELD,</note>
nature, <num value="1">one</num> on whose word <num value="1">one</num> may rely, and that he makes a conscience of what he promises, to perform it. In this confidence, I hope that the Church of England may yet subsist, and when it shall please God to open his eyes and turn his heart (for that is peculiarly in the Lord's hands) to flourish also. In all events, whatever do become of the Church of England, it is certainly, of all the Christian professions on the earth, the most primitive, apostolical, and excellent.

I returned home, next morning, to London. 
<p><num value="22">22</num><hi rend=italics>nd.</hi> I accompanied my Lady Clarendon to her house at Swallowfield,<note><p>Sir William Backhouse died seised of the manor of Swallowfield, in <datestruct value="1669--"><year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct>. His widow, daughter and heiress of Mr. William Backhouse, married Henry, Earl of Clarendon, who became possessed of this estate.

<p>Hence, we went to Swallowfield; this house is after the ancient building of honourable gentlemen's houses, when they kept up ancient hospitality, but the gardens and waters as elegant as it is possible to make a flat by art and industry, and no mean expense, my lady being so extraordinarily skilled in the flowery part, and my lord, in diligence of planting; <pb id="p.251" n="251">

so that I have hardly seen a seat which shows more tokens of it than what is to be found here, not only in the delicious and rarest fruits of a garden, but in those innumerable timber trees in the ground about the seat, to the greatest ornament and benefit of the place. There is <num value="1">one</num> orchard of <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct> golden, and other cider pippins; walks and groves of elms, limes, oaks, and other trees. The garden is so beset with all manner of sweet shrubs, that it perfumes the air. The distribution also of the quarters, walks, and parterres, is excellent. The nurseries, kitchen-garden full of the most desirable plants; <num value="2">two</num> very noble orangeries well furnished; but, above all, the canal and fish ponds, the <num value="1">one</num> fed with a white, the other with a black running water, fed by a quick and swift river, so well and plentifully stored with fish, that for pike, carp, bream, and tench, I never saw anything approaching it. We had at every meal carp and pike of a size fit for the table of a Prince, and what added to the delight was, to see the hundreds taken by the drag, out of which, the cook standing by, we pointed out what we had most mind to, and had carp that would have been worth at London <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure> a piece. The waters are flagged about with <hi rend=italics>Calamus aromaticus</hi>, with which my lady has hung a closet, that retains the smell very perfectly. There is also a certain sweet willow and other exotics: also a very fine bowling-green, meadow, pasture, and wood; in a word, all that can render a country-seat delightful. There is besides a well furnished library in the house. 
<p><num value="26">26</num><hi rend=italics>th October.</hi> We returned to London, having been treated with all sorts of cheer and noble freedom by that most religious and virtuous lady. She was now preparing to go for Ireland with her husband, made Lord-Deputy, and went to this country-house and ancient seat of her father and family, to set things in order during her absence; but never were good people and neighbours more concerned than all the country (the poor especially) for the departure of this charitable woman; every <num value="1">one</num> was in tears, and she as unwilling to part from them. There was amongst them a maiden of primitive life, the daughter of a poor labouring man, who had sustained her parents (some time since dead) by her labour, and has for many years refused marriage, or to receive any assistance from the parish, besides the little <pb id="p.252" n="252">

In sum, she appears a saint of an extraordinary sort, in so religious a life, as is seldom met with in villages now-a-days.

There also dined my Lord Ossory and Lady (the Duke of Beaufort's daughter), my Lady Treasurer, Lord Cornbury, and other visitors.

<p>Sir Richard Bulkeley described to us a model of a chariot he had invented, which it was not possible to overthrow in whatever uneven way it was drawn, giving us a wonderful relation of what it had performed in that kind, for ease, expedition, and safety; there were some inconveniences yet to be remedied&mdash;it would not contain more than <num value="1">one</num> person; was ready to take fire every <num value="10">ten</num> miles; and being placed and playing on no fewer than <num value="10">ten</num> rollers, it made a most prodigious noise, almost intolerable.

<p><num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>rd November.</hi> The French persecution of the Protestants raging with the utmost barbarity, exceeded even what the very heathens used: innumerable persons of the greatest birth and riches leaving all their earthly substance, and hardly escaping with their lives, dispersed through all the countries of Enrope. The French tyrant abrogated the Edict of Nantes which had been made in favour of them, and without any cause; on a sudden demolishing all their churches, banishing, imprisoning, and sending to the galleys all the ministers; plundering the common people, and exposing them to all sorts of barbarous usage by soldiers sent to ruin and prey on them; taking away their children; forcing people to the Mass, and then executing them as relapsers; they burnt their libraries, pillaged their goods, eat up their fields and substance, banished or sent the people to the galleys, and seized on their estates. There had now been numbered to pass through Geneva only (and that by stealth, for all the usual passages were strictly guarded by sea and land) <num value="40000">40,000</num> towards Switzerland. In Holland, Denmark, and all about Germany, were dispersed some <num value="100">hundred</num> thousands; besides those in England, where, though multitudes of all degree sought for shelter and welcome as distressed Christians and confessors, they found least encouragement, by a fatality of the times we were fallen into, and the uncharitable indifference of such as should have embraced them; and I pray it be not laid to our charge.

London, a<*> persons of great estates came over, who had forsaken all. France was almost dispeopled, the bankers so broken, that the tyrant's revenue was exceedingly diminished, manufactures ceased, and everybody there, save the Jesuits, abhorred what was done, nor did the Papists themselves approve it. What the further intention is, time will show; but doubtless portending some revolution. 
<p>I was showed the harangue which the Bishop of Valentia on Rhone made in the name of the Clergy, celebrating the French King, as if he was a God, for persecuting the poor Protestants, with this expression in it, &ldquo;That as his victory over heresy was greater than all the conquests of Alexander and C&aelig;sar, it was but what was wished in England; and that God seemed to raise the French King to this power and magnanimous action, that he might be in capacity to assist in doing the same here.&rdquo; This paragraph is very bold and remarkable; several reflecting on Archbishop Usher's prophecy as now begun in France, and approaching the orthodox in all other reformed churches. <num value="1">One</num> thing was much taken notice of, that the Gazettes which were still constantly printed twice a week, informing us what was done all over Europe, never spake of this wonderful proceeding in France; nor was any relation of it published by any, save what private letters and the persecuted fugitives brought. Whence this silence, I list not to conjecture; but it appeared very extraordinary in a Protestant country that we should know nothing of what Protestants suffered, whilst great collections were made for them in foreign places, more hospitable and Christian to appearance.

<p>Dining at Mr. Pepys's, Dr. Slayer showed us an experiment of a wonderful nature, pouring <num value="1">first</num> a very cold liquor into a glass, and super-fusing on it another, to appearance cold and clear liquor also; it <num value="1">first</num> produced a white cloud, then boiling, divers coruscations and actual flames of fire mingled with the liquor, which being a little shaken together, fixed divers suns and stars of real fire, perfectly globular, on the sides of the glass, and which there stuck like so many constellations, burning most vehemently, and resembling stars and heavenly bodies, and that for a long space. It seemed to exhibit a theory of the eduction of light out of the chaos, and the fixing or gathering of the universal light into luminous bodies. This matter, or phosphorus, was made out of human blood and urine, elucidating the vital flame, or heat, in animal bodies. A very noble experiment!

The dinner was most magnificent and plentiful, at <num value="4">four</num> tables, with music, kettle-drums, and trumpets, which sounded upon a whistle at every health. The banquet [dessert] was <num value="12">twelve</num> vast chargers piled up so high that those who sat <num value="1">one</num> against another could hardly see each other. Of these sweetmeats, which doubtless were some days piling up in that exquisite manner, the Ambassadors touched not, but leaving them to the spectators who came out of curiosity to see the dinner, were exceedingly pleased to see in what a moment of time all that curious work was demolished, the comfitures voided, and the tables cleared.

Thence, I went to the audience which they had in the Queen's presencechamber, the Banqueting-house being full of goods and furniture till the galleries on the garden--side, councilchamber, and new chapel, now in building, were finished. They went to their audience in those plain black gowns and caps which they constantly wear in the city of Venice. I was invited to have accompanied the <num value="2">two</num> Ambassadors in their coach to supper that night, returning now to their own lodgings, as no longer at the King's expense; but, being weary, I excused myself.

<p>Dryden, the famous play-writer, and his <num value="2">two</num> sons, and Mrs. Nelly (miss to the late &mdash;&mdash;), were said to go to mass; such proselytes were no great loss to the Church. 
<p>This night was burnt to the ground my Lord Montague's palace in Bloomsbury, than which for painting and furniture there was nothing more glorious in England.

preached at Whitehall on Numb. xi. <num value="12">12</num>; a Court oration upon the Regal Office. It was much wondered at, that this day, which was that of his late Majesty's death, should be kept as a festival, and not the day of the present King's coronation.

This sermon was the more acceptable, as it was unexpected from a Bishop who had undergone the censure of being inclined to Popery, the contrary whereof no man could show more. This indeed did all our Bishops, to the disabusing and reproach of all their delators: for none were more zealous against Popery than they were.

<p><num value="18">18</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> In the afternoon, I went to Camberwell, to visit Dr. Parr. After sermon, I accompanied him to his house, where he showed me the Life and Letters of the late learned Primate of Armagh (Usher), and among them that letter of Bishop Bramhall's to the Primate, giving notice of the Popish practices to pervert this nation, by sending a <num value="100">hundred</num> priests into England, who were to conform themselves to all sectaries and conditions for the more easily dispersing <pb id="p.263" n="263">

their doctrine amongst us. This letter was the cause of the whole impression being seized, upon pretence that it was a political or historical account of things not relating to theology, though it had been licensed by the Bishop; which plainly showed what an interest the Papists now had,&mdash;that a Protestant book, containing the life and letters of so eminent a man, was not to be published. There were also many letters to and from most of the learned persons his correspondents in Europe. The book will, I doubt not, struggle through this unjust impediment. 
<p>Several Judges were put out, and new complying ones put in.

<p>This Walker was a learned person, of a monkish life, to whose tuition I had more than <num value="30">thirty</num> years since recommended the sons of my worthy friend, Mr. Hyldyard, of Horsley in Surrey,<note><p>See

<p>This day was burnt in the old Exchange, by the common hangman, a translation of a book written by the famous Monsieur Claude, relating only matters of fact concerning the horrid massacres and barbarous proceedings of the French King against his Protestant subjects, without any refutation of any facts therein; so mighty a power and ascendant here had the French Ambassador, who was doubtless in great indignation at the pious and truly generous charity of all the nation, for the relief of those miserable sufferers who came over for shelter. 
<p>About this time also, the Duke of Savoy, instigated by the French King to extirpate the Protestants of Piedmont, slew many thousands of those innocent people, so that there seemed to be an universal design to destroy all that would not go to mass, throughout Europe. <hi rend=italics>Quod Avertat D.

My Lord of Canterbury's<note><p>Dr. Sancroft.

<p>A seal this day; mostly pardons and discharges of Knight- Baronets' fees, which having been passed over for so many years, did greatly disoblige several families who had served his Majesty. Lord Tyrconnel gone to Ireland, with great powers and commissions, giving as much cause of talk as the camp, especially <num value="19">nineteen</num> new Privy-Councillors and Judges being now made, amongst which but <num value="3">three</num> Protestants, and Tyrconnell made General. 
<p>New Judges also here, among which was Milton, a Papist (brother to that Milton who wrote for the Regicides), who presumed to take his place without passing the Test.<note><p>Christopher Milton, made a Baron of the Exchequer. He did not hold his office long. From weakness of constitution, Dr. Johnson remarks, he retired before he had done any disreputable act.</note> Scotland refused to grant liberty of mass to the Papists there. 
<p>The French persecution more inhuman than ever. The Protestants in Savoy successfully resist the French dragoons sent to murder them. 
<p>The King's chief physician in Scotland apostatizing from the Protestant religion, does of his own accord publish his recantation at Edinburgh.<note><p>Burnet informs us in his <hi rend=italics>Own Times</hi>, that this Sir Robert Sibbald, the most learned antiquary in Scotland, who had lived in a course of philosophical virtue, but in great doubt as to revealed religion, was prevailed upon by the Earl of Perth to turn Papist; but he soon became ashamed of having done so, on so little inquiry. Upon this he proceeded to London for some months, retiring from all company, and underwent a deep course of study, by which he came to a conviction of the errors of Popery.

<p>The new very young Lord Chief-Justice Herbert declared on the bench, that the government of England was entirely in the King; that the Crown was absolute; that penal laws were powers lodged in the Crown to enable the King to force the execution of the law, but were not bars to bind the King's power; that he could pardon all offences against the law, and forgive the penalties, and why could he not dispense with them; by which the Test was abolished?

I could not have believed I should ever have seen such things in the King of England's palace, after it had pleased God to enlighten this nation; but our great sin has, for the present, eclipsed the blessing, which I hope He will in mercy and His good time restore to its purity.

It was by all the world both hoped and expected, that he would have restored it to my Lord Clarendon; but they were astonished to see it given to Lord Arundel, of Wardour, a zealous Roman Catholic. Indeed it was very hard, and looked very unkindly, his Majesty (as my Lord Clarendon protested to me, on my going to visit him and long discoursing with him about the affairs of Ireland) finding not the least failure of duty in him during his government of that kingdom, so that his recall plainly appeared to be from the stronger influence of the Papists, who now got all the preferments. 
<p>Most of the great officers, both in the court and country, Lords and others, were dismissed, as they would not promise his Majesty their consent to the repeal of the test and penal statutes against Popish Recusants.

He exhorted his audience to adhere to the written Word, and to persevere in the Faith taught in the Church of England, whose doctrine for Catholic and soundness he preferred to all the communities and churches of Christians in the world; concluding with a kind of prophecy, that whatever it suffered, it should after a short trial emerge to the confusion of her adversaries and the glory of God.

There was a wonderful concourse of people at the Dissenters' meeting-house in this parish, and the parishchurch [Deptford] left exceeding thin. What this will end in, God Almighty only knows; but it looks like confusion, which I pray God avert.

sensions and animosities, which would not only unite them in bonds of Christian charity, but exceedingly encourage their future industry, to the improvement of trade, and spreading his Majesty's glory throughout the world; and that now he had given to God his empire, God would establish his; with expressions of great loyalty and submission; and so he gave the roll to the King, which being returned to him again, his Majesty caused him to read. The address was short, but much to the substance of the speech of their foreman, to whom the King, pulling off his hat, said that what he had done in giving liberty of conscience, was, what was ever his judgment ought to be done; and that, as he would preserve them in their enjoyment of it during his reign, so he would endeavour to settle it by law, that it should never be altered by his successors.

<p>The French <hi rend=italics>Tyrant</hi> now finding he could make no proselytes amongst those Protestants of quality, and others, whom he had caused to be shut up in dungeons, and confined to nunneries and monasteries, gave them, after so long trial, a general releasement, and leave to go out of the kingdom, but utterly taking their estates and their children; so that great numbers came daily into England and other places, where they were received and relieved with very considerate Christian charity. This Providence and goodness of God to those who thus constantly held out, did so work upon those miserable poor souls who to avoid the persecution signed their renunciation, and to save their estates went to mass, that reflecting on what they had done, they grew so affected in their conscience, that not being able to support it, they in great numbers through all the French provinces, acquainted the magistrates and lieutenants that being sorry for their apostacy, they were resolved to return to their old religion; that they would go no more to mass, but peaceably assemble when they could, to beg pardon and worship God, but so without weapons as not to give the least umbrage of rebel- <pb id="p.283" n="283">

lion or sedition, imploring their pity and commiseration; and, accordingly, meeting so from time to time, the dragoon-missioners, Popish officers and priests, fell upon them, murdered and put them to death, whoever they could lay hold on; they without the least resistance embraced death, torture, or hanging, with singing psalms and praying for their persecutors to the last breath, yet still continuing the former assembling of themselves in desolate places, suffering with incredible constancy, that through God's mercy they might obtain pardon for this lapse. Such examples of Christian behaviour have not been seen since the primitive persecutions; and doubtless God will do some signal work in the end, if we can with patience and resignation hold out, and depend on His Providence.

Coming to die, he bequeathed all his land, house, furniture, &amp;c. to Sir Charles, to whom he had no manner of relation, but an ancient friendship contracted at the famous siege of Colehester, <num value="40">forty</num> years before. It is a pretty place, with fine gardens, and well-planted, and given--to <num value="1">one</num> worthy of them, Sir Charles being an honest gentleman and soldier.

They are descendants of the great lawyer of that name, and give the same Arms and motto. He is married to <num value="1">one</num> Mrs. Temple, formerly Maid of Honour to the late Queen, a beautiful lady, and he has many fine children, so that none envy his good fortune. 
<p>After dinner, we went to see Sir William Temple's near to it; the most remarkable things are his orangery and gardens, where the wall-fruit-trees are most exquisitely nailed and trained, far better than I ever noted.

When this was heard, there was great rejoicing; and there was a lane of people from the King's Bench to the waterside, on their knees, as the Bishops passed and repassed, to beg their blessing.

tive in the amplitude of his sermon, he had supplied in the largeness and convenience of the parsonage-house, which the Doctor (who had at least <measure value="600l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="600">600</num></measure> a year in spiritual advancement) had new built, and made fit for a person of quality to live in, with gardens and all accommodation according therewith. 
<p>My lady carried us to see Lord Northampton's Seat, a very strong large house, built with stone, not altogether modern. They were enlarging the garden, in which was nothing extraordinary, except the iron gate opening into the park, which indeed was very good work, wrought in flowers, painted with blue and gilded. There is a noble walk of elms towards the front of the house by the bowling-green. I was not in any room of the house besides a lobby looking into the garden, where my Lord and his new Countess (Sir Stephen Fox's daughter, whom I had known from a child) entertained the Countess and her daughter the Countess of Arran (newly married to the son of the Duke of Hamilton), with so little good grace, and so dully, that our visit was very short, and so we returned to Althorpe, <num value="12">twelve</num> miles distant. 
<p>The house, or rather palace, at Althorpe, is a noble uniform pile in form of a half H, built of brick and freestone, balustred and <hi rend=italics>&agrave; la moderne;</hi> the hall is well, the staircase excellent; the rooms of state, galleries, offices and furniture, such as may become a great prince. It is situate in the midst of a garden, exquisitely planted and kept and all this in a park walled in with hewn stone, planted with rows and walks of trees, canals and fish-ponds, and stored with game. And, what is above all this, governed by a lady, who without any show of solicitude, keeps everything in such admirable order, both within and without, from the garret to the cellar, that I do not believe there is any in this nation, or in any other, that exceeds her in such exact order, without ostentation, but substantially great and noble. The meanest servant is lodged so neat and cleanly; the service at the several tables, the good order and decency&mdash;in a word, the entire economy is perfectly becoming a wise and noble person. She is <num value="1">one</num> who for her distinguished esteem of me from a long and worthy friendship, I must ever honour and celebrate. I wish from my soul the Lord her husband <pb id="p.290" n="290">

(whose parts and abilities are otherwise conspicuous) was as worthy of her, as by a fatal apostasy and court-ambition he has made himself unworthy! This is what she deplores, and it renders her as much affliction as a lady of great soul and much prudence is capable of. The Countess of Bristol, her mother, a grave and honourable lady, has the comfort of seeing her daughter and grandchildren under the same economy, especially Mr. Charles Spencer,<note><p>The eldest son dying without issue, this Charles succeeded to the title and estate, and marrying to his <num value="2">second</num> wife <num value="1">one</num> of the daughters and at length coheiress to John Duke of Marlborough, his son by her succeeded to that title.</note> a youth of extraordinary hopes, very learned for his age, and ingenious, and under a governor of great worth. Happy were it, could as much be said of the elder brother, the Lord Spencer, who, rambling about the world, dishonours both his name and his family, adding sorrow to sorrow to a mother, who has taken all imaginable care of his education. There is a daughter very young married to the Earl of Clancarty, who has a great and fair estate in Ireland, but who yet gives no great presage of worth,&mdash;so universally contaminated is the youth of this corrupt and abandoned age! But this is again recompensed by my Lord Arran, a sober and worthy gentleman, who has espoused the Lady Ann Spencer, a young lady of admirable accomplishments and virtue. 
<p><num value="23">23</num><hi rend=italics>rd August.</hi> I left this noble place and conversation, my lady having provided carriages to convey us back in the same manner as we went, and a dinner being prepared at Dunstable against our arrival. Northampton, having been lately burnt and re-edified, is now become a town that for the beauty of the buildings, especially the church and townhouse, may compare with the neatest in Italy itself. 
<p>Dr. Sprat, Bishop of Rochester, wrote a very honest and handsome letter to the Commissioners Ecclesiastical, excusing himself from sitting any longer among them, he by no means approving of their prosecuting the Clergy who refused to read the Declaration for liberty of conscience, in prejudice of the Church of England.

<p><num value="18">18</num><hi rend=italics>th September.</hi> I went to London, where I found the Court in the utmost consternation on report of the Prince of Orange's landing; which put Whitehall into so panic a fear, that I could hardly believe it possible to find such a change. 
<p>Writs were issued in order to a Parliament, and a declaration to back the good order of elections, with great professions of maintaining the Church of England, but without giving any sort of satisfaction to the people, who showed their high discontent at several things in the Government. 
<p>Earthquakes had utterly demolished the ancient Smyrna, and several other places in Greece, Italy, and even in the Spanish Indies, forerunners of greater calamities. God Almighty preserve His Church and all who put themselves under the shadow of His wings, till these things be overpast! 
<p><num value="30">30</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> The Court in so extraordincry a consternation, on assurance of the Prince of Orange's intention to land, that the writs sent forth for a Parliament were recalled. 
<p><num value="7">7</num><hi rend=italics>th October.</hi> Dr. Tenison preached at St Martin's on <num value="2">2</num> Tim. iii. <num value="16">16</num>, showing the Scriptures to be our only rule of faith, and its perfection above all traditions. After which, near <num value="1000">1,000</num> devout persons partook of the Communion. The sermon was chiefly occasioned by a Jesuit, who in the Masshouse on the Sunday before had disparaged the Scripture and railed at our translation, which some present contradicting, they pulled him out of the pulpit, and treated him very coarsely, insomuch that it was like to create a great disturbance in the City. 
<p>Hourly expectation of the Prince of Orange's invasion heightened to that degree, that his Majesty thought fit to abrogate the Commission for the dispensing Power (but retaining his own right still to dispense with all laws) and restore the ejected Fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford. <pb id="p.292" n="292"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
In the mean time, he called over <num value="5000">5,000</num> Irish, and <num value="4000">4,000</num> Scots, and continued to remove Protestants and put in Papists at Portsmouth and other places of trust, and retained the Jesuits about him, increasing the universal discontent. It brought people to so desperate a pass, that they seemed passionately to long for and desire the landing of that Prince, whom they looked on to be their deliverer from Popish tyranny, praying incessantly for an east wind, which was said to be the only hindrance of his expedition with a numerous army ready to make a descent. To such a strange temper, and unheard--of in former times, was this poor nation reduced, and of which I was an eye-witness. The apprehension was (and with reason) that his Majesty's forces would neither at land nor sea oppose them with that vigour requisite to repel invaders. 
<p>The late imprisoned Bishops were now called to reconcile matters, and the Jesuits hard at work to foment confusion among the Protestants by their usual tricks. A letter was sent to the Archbishop of Canterbury,<note><p>By Evelyn himself. The letter was as follows: 
<p>&ldquo;My Lord, The honour and reputation which your Grace's piety, prudence, and signal courage, have justly merited and obtained, not only from the sons of the Church of England, but even universally from those Protestants amongst us who are Dissenters from her discipline; God Almighty's providence and blessing upon your Grace's vigilancy and extraordinary endeavours will not suffer to be diminished in this conjuncture. The conversation I now and then have with some in place, who have the opportunity of knowing what is doing in the most secret recesses and cabals of our Church's adversaries, obliges me to acquaint you, that the calling of your Grace and the rest of the Lords Bishops to Court, and what has there of late been required of you, is only to create a jealousy and suspicion amongst well-meaning people of such compliances, as it is certain they have no cause to apprehend. The plan of this and of all that which is to follow of seeming favour thence, is wholly drawn by the Jesuits, who are at this time more than ever busy to make divisions amongst us, all other arts and mechanisms having hitherto failed them. They have, with other things, contrived that your Lordships the Bishops should give his Majesty advice separately, without calling any of the rest of the Peers, which, though maliciously suggested, spreads generally about the town. I do not at all question but your Grace will speedily prevent the operation of this venom, and that you will think it highly necessary so to do, that your Grace is also injoined to compose a form of prayer, wherein the Prince of Orange is expressly to be named the Invader: of this I presume not to say anything; but for as much as in all the Declarations, &amp;c. which have hitherto been published in pretended favour of the Church of England, there is not once the least mention of the 
<hi rend=italics>Reformed</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Protestant Religion</hi>, but only of the <hi rend=italics>Church of England as by Law established</hi>, which Church the Papists tell us is the <hi rend=italics>Church of Rome</hi>, which is (say they) the Catholic Church of England&mdash;that only is established by Law; the Church of England in the <hi rend=italics>Reformed</hi> sense so established, is but by an usurped authority. The antiquity of <hi rend=italics>that</hi>
would by these words be explained, and utterly defeat this false and subdolous construction, and take off all exceptions whatsoever; if, in all extraordinary offices, upon these occasions, the words <hi rend=italics>Reformed</hi> and 
<hi rend=italics>Protestant</hi> were added to that of the <hi rend=italics>Church of England by Law established.</hi> And whosoever threatens to invade or come against us, to the prejudice of that Church, in God's name, be they Dutch or Irish, let us heartily pray and fight against them. My Lord, this is, I confess, a bold, but honest period: and, though I am well assured that your Grace is perfectly acquainted with all this before, and therefore may blame my impertinence, as that does <foreign lang=Greek>allotrioepiskopei_n</foreign>; yet I am confident you will not reprove the zeal of <num value="1">one</num> who most humbly begs your Grace's pardon, with your blessing.

<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
The Queen Dowager, and all the ladies and lords who were present at the Queen Consort's labour, were to give their testimony upon oath of the Prince of Wales's birth, recorded both at the Council-Board and at the Chancery a day or <num value="2">two</num> after. This procedure was censured by some as below his Majesty to condescend to, on the talk of the people. It was remarkable that on this occasion the Archbishop, Marquis of Halifax, the Earls of Clarendon and Nottingham, refused to sit at the Council-table amongst Papists, and their bold telling his Majesty that whatever was done whilst such sat amongst them was unlawful and incurred <hi rend=italics>pr&aelig;munire;</hi>&mdash;at least, if what I heard be true.

Reports of his great losses of horse in the storm, but without any assurance. A man was taken with divers papers and printed manifestoes, and carried to Newgate, after examination at the Cabinet- Council. There was likewise a Declaration of the States for satisfaction of all Public Ministers at the Hague, except to the English and the French. There was in that of the Prince's an expression, as if the Lords both Spiritual and Temporal had invited him over, with a deduction of the causes of his enterprise. This made his Majesty convene my Lord of Canterbury and the other Bishops now in town, <pb id="p.295" n="295"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>.</note>
to give an account of what was in the manifesto, and to enjoin them to clear themselves by some public writing of this disloyal charge. 
<p><num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>nd November.</hi> It was now certainly reported by some who saw the fleet, and the Prince embark, that they sailed from the Brill on Wednesday morning, and that the Princess of Orange was there to take leave of her husband.

This put the King and Court into great consternation, they were now employed in forming an army to stop their further progress, for they were got into Exeter, and the season and ways very improper for his Majesty's forces to march so great a distance. 
<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury and some few of the other Bishops and Lords in London, were sent for to Whitehall, and required to set forth their abhorrence of this invasion. They assured his Majesty they had never invited any of the Prince's party, or were in the least privy to it, and would be ready to show all testimony of their loyalty; but, as to a public declaration, being so few, they desired that his Majesty would call the rest of their brethren and Peers, that they might consult what was fit to be done on this occasion, not thinking it right to publish any thing without them, and till they had themselves seen the Prince's Manifesto, in which it was pretended he was invited in by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal. This did not please the King; so they departed. 
<p>A Declaration was published, prohibiting all persons to see or read the Prince's Manifesto, in which was set forth at large the cause of his expedition, as there had been <num value="1">one</num> before from the States. 
<p>These are the beginnings of sorrow, unless God in His mercy prevent it by some happy reconciliation of all dissensions among us. This, in all likelihood, nothing can <pb id="p.296" n="296">

effect except a free Parliament; but this we cannot hope to see, whilst there are any forces on either side. I pray God to protect and direct the King for the best and truest interest of his people!&mdash;I saw his Majesty touch for the evil, Piten the Jesuit, and Warner officiating. 
<p><num value="14">14</num><hi rend=italics>th November.</hi> The Prince increases every day in force. Several Lords go in to him. Lord Cornbury carries some regiments, and marches to Honiton, the Prince's head-quarters.

Bath, York, Hull, Bristol, and all the eminent nobility and persons of quality through England, declare for the Protestant religion and laws, and go to meet the Prince, who every day sets forth new Declarations against the Papists. The great favourites at Court, Priests and Jesuits, fly or abscond. Every thing, till now concealed, flies abroad in public print, and is cried about the streets.

This is taken heinously, and the King goes privately to Rochester; is persuaded to come back; comes on the Sunday; goes to mass, and dines in public, a Jesuit saying grace (I was present).

<p>All the world go to see the Prince at St. James's, where there is a great Court. There I saw him, and several of my acquaintance who came over with him. He is very stately, serious, and reserved. The English soldiers sent out of town to disband them; not well pleased.

After prayers and dinner, divers serious matters were discoursed, concerning the present state of the Public, and sorry I was to find there was as yet no accord in the judgments of those of the Lords and Commons who were to convene; some would have the Princess made Queen without any more dispute, others were for a Regency; there was a Tory party (then so called), who were for inviting his Majesty again upon conditions; and there were Republicans who would make the Prince of Orange like a Stadtholder. The Romanists were busy among these several parties to bring them into confusion: most for ambition or other interest, few for conscience and moderate resolutions. I found nothing of all this in this assembly of Bishops, who were pleased to admit me into their discourses; they were all for a Regency, thereby to salve their oaths, and so all public matters to proceed in his Majesty's name, by that to facilitate the calling of a Parliament, according to the laws in being. Such was the result of this meeting. 
<p>My Lord of Canterbury gave me great thanks for the advertisement I sent him in October,<note><hi rend=italics>Ante</hi>, p. <num value="292">292</num>.</note> and assured me they took my counsel in that particular, and that it came very seasonably. <pb id="p.299" n="299">

<p>I found by the Lord-Advocate that the Bishops of Scotland (who were indeed little worthy of that character, and had done much mischief in that Church) were now coming about to the true interest, in this conjuncture which threatened to abolish the whole hierarchy in that kingdom; and therefore the Scottish Archbishop and Lord-Advocate requested the Archbishop of Canterbury to use his best endeavours with the Prince to maintain the Church there in the same state, as by law at present settled. 
<p>It now growing late, after some private discourse with his Grace, I took my leave, most of the Lords being gone. 
<p>The trial of the bishops was now printed. 
<p>The great convention being assembled the day before, falling upon the question about the Government, resolved that King James having by the advice of the Jesuits and other wicked persons endeavoured to subvert the laws of Church and State, and deserted the kingdom, carrying away the seals, &amp;c., without any care for the management of the government, had by demise abdicated himself and wholly vacated his right; they did therefore desire the Lords' concurrence to their vote, to place the crown on the next heir, the Prince of Orange, for his life, then to the Princess, his wife, and if she died without issue, to the Princess of Denmark, and she failing, to the heirs of the Prince, excluding for ever all possibility of admitting a Roman Catholic.

There was not any thing in chronology, history, geography, the several systems of astronomy, courses of the stars, longitude, latitude, doctrine of the spheres, courses and sources of rivers, creeks, harbours, eminent cities, boundaries and bearings of countries, not only in Europe, but in any other part of the earth, which he did not readily <pb id="p.300" n="300"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
resolve and demonstrate his knowledge of, readily drawing out with a pen anything he would describe. He was able not only to repeat the most famous things which are left us in any of the Greek or Roman histories, monarchies, republies, wars, colonies, exploits by sea and land, but all the sacred stories of the Old and New Testament; the succession of all the monarchies, Babylonian, Persian, Greek, Roman, with all the lower Emperors, Popes, Heresiarchs, and Councils, what they were called about, what they determined, or in the controversy about Easter, the tenets of the Gnostics, Sabellians, Arians, Nestorians; the difference between St. Cyprian and Stephen about re-baptization; the schisms. We leaped from that to other things totally different, to Olympic years, and synchronisms; we asked him questions which could not be resolved without considerable meditation and judgment, nay of some particulars of the Civil Laws, of the Digest and Code. He gave a stupendous account of both natural and moral philosophy, and even in metaphysics. 
<p>Having thus exhausted ourselves rather than this wonderful child, or angel rather, for he was as beautiful and lovely in countenance as in knowledge, we concluded with asking him if, in all he had read or heard of, he had ever met with anything which was like this expedition of the Prince of Orange, with so small a force to obtain <num value="3">three</num> great kingdoms without any contest. After a little thought, he told us that he knew of nothing which did more resemble it than the coming of Constantine the Great out of Britain, through France and Italy, so tedious a march, to meet Maxentius, whom he overthrew at Pons Milvius with very little conflict, and at the very gates of Rome, which he entered and was received with triumph, and obtained the empire, not of <num value="3">three</num> kingdoms only, but of all the then known world. He was perfect in the Latin authors, spake French naturally, and gave us a description of France, Italy, Savoy, Spain, ancient and modernly divided; as also of ancient Greece, Scythia, and northern countries and tracts: we left questioning further. He did this without any set or formal repetitions, as <num value="1">one</num> who had learned things without book, but as if he minded other things, going about the room, and toying with a parrot there, and as he was at dinner (<hi rend=italics>tanquam aliua agens</hi>, <pb id="p.301" n="301">

<p>His father assured us he never imposed anything to charge his memory by causing him to get things by heart, not ever the rules of grammar; but his tutor (who was a Frenchman) read to him, <num value="1">first</num> in French, then in Latin; that he usually played amongst other boys <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> hours every day, and that he was as earnest at his play as at his study. He was perfect in arithmetic, and now newly entered into Greek. In sum (<hi rend=italics>horresco referens</hi>), I had read of divers forward and precocious youths, and some I have known, but I never did either hear or read of anything like to this sweet child, if it be right to call him child who has more knowledge than most men in the world. I counselled his father not to set his heart too much on this jewel,

<p><num value="29">29</num><hi rend=italics>th January.</hi> The votes of the House of Commons being carried up by Mr. Hampden, their chairman, to the Lords, I got a station by the Prince's lodgings at the door of the lobby to the House, and heard much of the debate, which lasted very long. Lord Derby was in the chair (for the House was resolved into a grand committee of the whole House); after all had spoken, it came to the question, which was carried by <num value="3">three</num> voices against a Regency, which <num value="51">51</num> were for, <num value="54">54</num> against; the minority alleging the danger of dethroning Kings, and scrupling many passages and expressions in the vote of the Commons, too long to set down particularly. Some were for sending to his Majesty with conditions: others that the King could do no wrong, and that the mal-administration was chargeable on his ministers. There were not more than <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="9">nine</num> bishops, and but <num value="2">two</num> against the Regency; the archbishop was absent, and the clergy now began to change their note, both in pulpit <pb id="p.302" n="302"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
and discourse, on their old passive obedience, so as people began to talk of the bishops being cast out of the House. In short, things tended to dissatisfaction on both sides; add to this, the morose temper of the Prince of Orange, who showed little countenance to the noblemen and others, who expected a more gracious and cheerful reception when they made their court. The English army also was not so in order, and firm to his interest, nor so weakened but that it might give interruption. Ireland was in an ill posture as well as Scotland. Nothing was yet done towards a settlement. God of His infinite mercy compose these things, that we may be at last a Nation and a Church under some fixed and sober establishment!

<p>The Convention of the Lords and Commons now declare the Prince and Princess of Orange King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland (Scotland being an independent kingdom), the Prince and Princess being to enjoy it jointly during their lives; but the executive authority to be vested in the Prince during life, though all proceedings to run in both names, and that it should descend to their issue, and for want of such, to the Princess Anne of Denmark and her issue, and in want of such, to the heirs of the body of the Prince, if he survive, and that failing, to devolve to the Parliament, as they should think fit. These produced a conference with the Lords, when also there was presented heads of such new laws as were to be enacted. It is thought on these conditions they will be proclaimed. 
<p>There was much contest about the King's abdication, and <pb id="p.303" n="303">

whether he had vacated the government. The Earl of Nottingham and about <num value="20">twenty</num> Lords, and many Bishops, entered their protests, but the concurrence was great against them. 
<p>The Princess hourly expected. Forces sending to Ireland, that kingdom being in great danger by the Earl of Tyrconnel's army, and expectations from France coming to assist them, but that King was busy in invading Flanders, and encountering the German Princes. It is likely that this will be the most remarkable summer for action, which has happened in many years. 
<p><num value="21">21</num><hi rend=italics>st February.</hi> Dr. Burnet preached at St. James's on the obligation to walk worthy of God's particular and signal deliverance of the Nation and Church. 
<p>I saw the <hi rend=italics>new Queen</hi> and <hi rend=italics>King</hi> proclaimed the very next day after her coming to Whitehall, Wednesday, <datestruct VALUE="-02-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, with great acclamation and general good reception. Bonfires, bells, guns, &amp;c. It was believed that both, especially the Princess, would have showed some (seeming) reluctance at least, of assuming her father's Crown, and made some apology, testifying by her regret that he should by his mismanagement necessitate the Nation to so extraordinary a proceeding, which would have showed very handsomely to the world, and according to the character given of her piety; consonant also to her husband's <num value="1">first</num> declaration, that there was no intention of deposing the King, but of succouring the Nation; but nothing of all this appeared; she came into Whitehall laughing and jolly, as to a wedding, so as to seem quite transported. She rose early the next morning, and in her undress, as it was reported, before her women were up, went about from room to room to see the convenience of Whitehall; lay in the same bed and apartment where the late Queen lay, and within a night or <num value="2">two</num> sat down to play at basset, as the Queen her predecessor used to do. She smiled upon and talked to everybody, so that no change seemed to have taken place at Court since her last going away, save that infinite crowds of people thronged to see her, and that she went to our prayers. This carriage was censured by many. She seems to be of a good nature, and that she takes nothing to heart: whilst the Prince her husband has a thoughtful countenance, is wonderful serious and <pb id="p.304" n="304"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
silent, and seems to treat all persons alike gravely, and to be very intent on affairs: Holland, Ireland, and France calling for his care. 
<p>Divers Bishops and Noblemen are not at all satisfied with this so sudden assumption of the Crown, without any previous sending, and offering some conditions to the absent King; or, on his not returning, or not assenting to those conditions, to have proclaimed him Regent; but the major part of both Houses prevailed to make them King and Queen immediately, and a crown was tempting. This was opposed and spoken against with such vehemence by Lord Clarendon (her own uncle), that it put him by all preferment, which must doubtless have been as great as could have been given him. My Lord of Rochester his brother, overshot himself, by the same carriage and stiffness, which their friends thought they might have well spared when they saw how it was like to be overruled, and that it had been sufficient to have declared their dissent with less passion, acquiescing in due time. 
<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury and some of the rest, on scruple of conscience and to salve the oaths they had taken, entered their protests and hung off, especially the Archbishop, who had not all this while so much as appeared out of Lambeth. This occasioned the wonder of many who observed with what zeal they contributed to the Prince's expedition, and all the while also rejecting any proposals of sending again to the absent King; that they should now raise scruples, and such as created much division among the people, greatly rejoicing the old courtiers, and especially the Papists. 
<p>Another objection was, the invalidity of what was done by a Convention only, and the as yet unabrogated laws; this drew them to make themselves on the <num value="22">22nd</num> [February] a Parliament, the new King passing the Act with the crown on his head. The lawyers disputed, but necessity prevailed, the Government requiring a speedy settlement. 
<p>Innumerable were the crowds, who solicited for, and expected offices; most of the old ones were turned out. <num value="2">Two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> white staves were disposed of some days before, as Lord Steward, to the Earl of Devonshire; Trea- <pb id="p.305" n="305">

surer of the Household, to Lord Newport; Lord Chamberlain to the King, to my Lord of Dorset; but there were as yet none in offices of the Civil Government save the Marquis of Halifax as Privy Seal. A council of <num value="30">thirty</num> was chosen, Lord Derby president, but neither Chancellor nor Judges were yet declared, the new Great Seal not yet finished. 
<p><num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>th March.</hi> Dr. Tillotson, Dean of Canterbury, made an excellent discourse on Matt. v. <num value="44">44</num>, exhorting to charity and forgiveness of enemies; I suppose purposely, the new Parliament being furious about impeaching those who were obnoxious, and as their custom has ever been, going on violently, without reserve, or moderation, whilst wise men were of opinion the most notorious offenders being named and excepted, an Act of Amnesty would be more seasonable, to pacify the minds of men in so general a discontent of the nation, especially of those who did not expect to see the government assumed without any regard to the absent King, or proving a spontaneous abdication, or that the birth of the Prince of Wales was an imposture; <num value="5">five</num> of the Bishops also still refusing to take the new oath. 
<p>In the mean time, to gratify the people, the Hearth-Tax was remitted for ever; but what was intended to supply it, besides present great taxes on land, is not named. 
<p>The King abroad was now furnished by the French King with money and officers for an expedition to Ireland. The great neglect in not more timely preventing that from hence, and the disturbances in Scotland, give apprehensions of great difficulties, before any settlement can be perfected here, whilst the Parliament dispose of the great offices amongst themselves. The Great Seal, Treasury and Admiralty put into commission of many unexpected persons, to gratify the more; so that by the present appearance of things (unless God Almighty graciously interpose and give success in Ireland and settle Scotland) more trouble seems to threaten the nation than could be expected. In the interim, the new King refers all to the Parliament in the most popular manner, but is very slow in providing against all these menaces, besides finding difficulties in raising men to send abroad; the former army, which had never seen any service hitherto, receiving their pay and passing their summer in an <pb id="p.306" n="306">

Wonderful uncertainty where King James was, whether in France or Ireland. The Scots seem as yet to favour King William, rejecting King James's letter to them, yet declaring nothing positively. Soldiers in England discontented. Parliament preparing the coronation-oath.

<p>Court-offices distributed amongst Parliament-men. No considerable fleet as yet sent forth. Things far from settled as was expected, by reason of the slothful, sickly temper of the new King, and the Parliament's unmindfulness of Ireland, which is likely to prove a sad omission.

<p><num value="11">11</num><hi rend=italics>th April.</hi> I saw the procession to and from the Abbey- Church of Westminster, with the great feast in Westminster-Hall, at the coronation of King William and Queen Mary. What was different from former coronations, was some alteration in the coronation-oath. Dr. Burnet, now made Bishop of Sarum, preached with great applause. The Parliament-men had scaffolds and places which took up the <num value="1">one</num> whole side of the Hail. When the King and Queen <pb id="p.307" n="307"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1689--"><year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct>.</note>
had dined, the ceremony of the Champion, and other services by tenure were performed. The Parliament-men were feasted in the Exchequer-chamber, and had each of them a gold medal given them, worth <num value="5">five</num>-and-<measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num> shillings</measure>. On <num value="1">one</num> side were the effigies of the King and Queen inclining <num value="1">one</num> to the other; on the reverse was Jupiter throwing a bolt at Ph&auml;eton, the words, &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Ne totus absumatur:</hi>&rdquo; which was but dull, seeing they might have had out of the poet something as apposite. The sculpture was very mean. 
<p>Much of the splendour of the proceeding was abated by the absence of divers who should have contributed to it, there being but <num value="5">five</num> Bishops, <num value="4">four</num> Judges (no more being yet sworn), and several noblemen and great ladies wanting; the feast, however, was magnificent. The next day the House of Commons went and kissed their new Majesties' hands in the Banqueting-house. 
<p><num value="12">12</num><hi rend=italics>th April.</hi> I went with the Bishop of St. Asaph to visit my Lord of Canterbury at Lambeth, who had excused himself from officiating at the coronation, which was performed by the Bishop of London, assisted by the Archbishop of York. We had much private and free discourse with his Grace concerning several things relating to the Church. there being now a bill of comprehension to be brought from the Lords to the Commons. I urged that when they went about to reform some particulars in the Liturgy, Church discipline, Canons, &amp;c., the baptizing in private houses without necessity might be reformed, as likewise so frequent burials in churches; the <num value="1">one</num> proceeding much from the pride of women, bringing that into custom which was only indulged in case of imminent danger, and out of necessity during the rebellion, and persecution of the clergy in our late civil wars; the other from the avarice of ministers, who, in some opulent parishes, made almost as much of permission to bury in the chancel and the church, as of their livings, and were paid with considerable advantage and gifts for baptising in chambers. To this they heartily assented, and promised their endeavour to get it reformed, utterly disliking both practices as novel and indecent. 
<p>We discoursed likewise of the great disturbance and prejudice it might cause, should the new oath, now on the anvil, be imposed on any, save such as were in new office <pb id="p.308" n="308"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
without any retrospect to such as either had no office, or had been long in office, who it was likely would have some scruples about taking a new oath, having already sworn fidelity to the government as established by law. This we all knew to be the case of my Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, and some other persons who were not so fully satisfied with the Convention making it an abdication of King James, to whom they had sworn allegiance. 
<p>King James was now certainly in Ireland with the Marshal d&lsquo;Estrades, whom he made a Privy Councillor; and who caused the King to remove the Protestant Councillors, some whereof, it seems, had continued to sit, telling him that the King of France his master would never assist him if he did not immediately do it; by which it is apparent how the poor Prince is managed by the French. 
<p>Scotland declares for King William and Queen Mary, with the reasons of their setting aside King James, not as abdicating, but forfeiting his right by mal-administration; they proceeded with much more caution and prudence than we did, who precipitated all things to the great reproach of the nation, all which had been managed by some crafty illprincipled men. The new Privy Council have a Republican spirit, manifestly undermining all future succession of the crown and prosperity of the Church of England, which yet I hope they will not be able to accomplish so soon as they expect, though they get into all places of trust and profit. 
<p><num value="21">21</num><hi rend=italics>st April.</hi> This was <num value="1">one</num> of the most seasonable springs, freefrom the usual sharp east winds that I have observed since the year <datestruct value="1660"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct> (the year of the Restoration), which was much such an <num value="1">one</num>. 
<p><num value="26">26</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> I heard the lawyers plead before the Lords the writ of error in the judgment of Oates, as to the charge against him of perjury, which after debate they referred to the answer of Holloway, &amp;c., who were his Judges. I then went with the Bishop of St. Asaph to the Archbishop at Lambeth, where they entered into discourse concerning the final destruction of Antichrist, both concluding that the <num value="3">third</num> trumpet and vial were now pouring out. My Lord St. Asaph considered the killing of the <num value="2">two</num> witnesses, to be the utter destruction of the Cevennes Protestants by the French and Duke of Savoy, and the other the Waldenses and Pyrenean Christians, <pb id="p.309" n="309"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1689--"><year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct>.</note>
who by all appearance from good history had kept the primitive faith from the very Apostles' time till now. The doubt his Grace suggested was, whether it could be made evident that the present persecution had made so great a havoc of those faithful people as of the other, and whether there were not yet some among them in being who met together, it being stated from the text, Apoc. xi., that they should both be slain together. They both much approved of Mr. Mede's way of interpretation, and that he only failed in resolving too hastily on the King of Sweden's (Gustavus Adolphus) success in Germany. They agreed that it would be good to employ some intelligent French minister<note><p>They sent <num value="2">two</num>, See afterwards.</note> to travel as far as the Pyrenees to understand the present state of the Church there, it being a country where hardly any <num value="1">one</num> travels. 
<p>There now came certain news that King James had not only landed in Ireland, but that he had surprised Londonderry, and was become master of that kingdom, to the great shame of our Government, who had been so often solicited to provide against it by timely succour, and which they might so easily have done. This is a terrible beginning of more troubles, especially should an army come thence into Scotland, people being generally disaffected here and every where else, so that the sea and land-men would scarce serve without compulsion. 
<p>A new oath was now fabricating for all the clergy to take, of obedience to the present Government, in abrogation of the former oaths of allegiance, which it is foreseen many of the Bishops and others of the clergy will not take. The penalty is to be the loss of their dignity and spiritual preferment. This is thought to have been driven on by the Presbyterians, our new governors. God in mercy send us help, and direct the counsels to His glory and good of His Church! 
<p>Public matters went very ill in Ireland: confusion and dissension amongst ourselves, stupidity, inconstancy, emulation, the governors employing unskilful men in greatest offices, no person of public spirit and ability appearing,&mdash; threaten us with a very sad prospect of what may be the conclusion, without God's infinite mercy. <pb id="p.310" n="310">

<p><num value="7">7</num><hi rend=italics>th March.</hi> I dined with Mr. Pepys, late Secretary to the Admiralty, where was that excellent shipwright and seaman (for so he had been, and also a Commission of the Navy), Sir Anthony Deane. Amongst other discourse, and deploring the sad condition of our navy, as now governed by inexperienced men since this Revolution, he mentioned what exceeding advantage we of this nation had by being the <num value="1">first</num> who built frigates, the <num value="1">first</num> of which ever built was that vessel which was afterwards called &ldquo;The Constant Warwick,&rdquo; and was the work of Pett<note><hi rend=italics>Ante</hi>, vol. i. p. <num value="398">398</num>.</note> of Chatham, for a trial of making a vessel that would sail swiftly; it was built with low decks, the guns lying near the water, and was so light and swift of sailing, that in a short time he told us she had, ere the Dutch war was ended, taken as much money from privateers as would have laden her; and that more such being built, did in a year or <num value="2">two</num> scour the Channel from those of Dunkirk and others which had exceedingly infested it. He added that it would be the best and only infallible expedient to be masters of the sea, and able to destroy the greatest navy of any enemy if, instead of building huge great ships and <num value="2">second</num> and <num value="3">third</num> rates, they would leave off building such high decks, which were for nothing but to gratify gentlemen-commanders, who must have all their effeminate accommodations, and for pomp; that it would be the ruin of our fleets, if such persons were continued in command, they neither having experience nor being capable of learning, because they would not submit to the fatigue and inconvenience which those who were bred seamen would undergo, in those so otherwise useful swift frigates. These being to encounter the greatest ships would <pb id="p.316" n="316"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
be able to protect, set on, and bring off, those who should manage the fire-ships, and the Prince who should <num value="1">first</num> store himself with numbers of such fire-ships would, through the help and countenance of such frigates, be able to ruin the greatest force of such vast ships as could be sent to sea, by the dexterity of working those light, swift ships to guard the fire-ships. He concluded there would shortly be no other method of sea-fight; and that great ships and men-of-war, however stored with guns and men, must submit to those who should encounter them with far less number. He represented to us the dreadful effect of these fire-ships; that he continually observed in our late maritime war with the Dutch that, when an enemy's fire-ship approached, the most valiant commander and common sailors were in such consternation, that though then, of all times, there was most need of the guns, bombs, &amp;c., to keep the mischief off, they grew pale and astonished, as if of a quite other mean soul, that they slunk about, forsook their guns and work as if in despair, every <num value="1">one</num> looking about to see which way they might get out of their ship, though sure to be drowned if they did so. This he said was likely to prove hereafter the method of sea-fight, likely to be the misfortune of England if they continued to put gentlemen-commanders over experienced seamen, on account of their ignorance, effeminacy, and insolence. 
<p><num value="9">9</num><hi rend=italics>th March.</hi> Preached at Whitehall Dr. Burnet, late Bishop of Sarum, on Heb. iv. <num value="13">13</num>, anatomically describing the texture of the eye; and that, as it received such innumerable sorts of spies through so very small a passage to the brain, and that without the least confusion or trouble, and accordingly judged and reflected on them; so God who made this sensory, did with the greatest ease and at once see all that was done through the vast universe, even to the very thought as well as action. This similitude he continued with much perspicuity and aptness; and applied it accordingly, for the admonishing us how uprightly we ought to live and behave ourselves before such an allseeing Deity; and how we were to conceive of other His attributes, which we could have no idea of than by comparing them by what we were able to conceive of the nature and power of things, which were the objects of our senses; and therefore it was <pb id="p.317" n="317"> 
<note place=marg><datestruct value="1690--"><year reg="1690">1690</year></datestruct>.</note>
that in Scripture we attribute those actions and affections of God by the same of man, not as adequately or in any proportion like them, but as the only expedient to make some resemblance of His divine perfections; as when the Scripture says, &ldquo;God will remember the sins of the penitent no more:&rdquo; not as if God could forget anything, but as intimating he would pass by such penitents and receive them to mercy. 
<p>I dined at the Bishop of St. Asaph's, Almoner to the new Queen, with the famous lawyer Sir George Mackenzie (late Lord Advocate of Scotland), against whom both the Bishop and myself had written and published books, but now most friendly reconciled.<note><p>Sir George, as we have seen (<hi rend=italics>ante</hi>, p. <num value="23">23</num>), had written in praise of a Private Life, which Mr. Evelyn answered by a book in praise of Public Life and Active Employment.

He observed that the <num value="1">first</num> Presbyterdissents from our discipline were introduced by the Jesuits' order, about the <num value="20">20</num> of Queen Eliz., a famous Jesuit amongst them feigning himself a Protestant, and who was the <num value="1">first</num> who began to pray extempore, and brought in that which they since called, and are still so fond of, praying by the Spirit.

<p><num value="18">18</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> Fast day. Visited the Bishop of St. Asaph; his conversation was on the Vaudois in Savoy, who had been thought so near destruction and final extirpation by the French, being totally given up to slaughter, so that there were no hopes for them; but now it pleased God that the Duke of Savoy, who had hitherto joined with the French in their persecution, being now pressed by them to deliver up Saluzzo and Turin as cautionary towns, on suspicion that he might at last come into the Confederacy of the German Princes, did secretly concert measures with, and afterwards declared for, them. He then invited these poor people from their dispersion amongst the mountains whither they had fled, and restored them to their country, their dwellings, and the exercise of their religion, and begged pardon for the illusage they had received, charging it on the cruelty of the French who forced him to it. These being the remainder of those persecuted Christians which the Bishop of St. Asaph had so long affirmed to be the <num value="2">two</num> witnesses spoken of in the Revelation, who should be killed and brought to life again, it was looked on as an extraordinary thing that this prophesying Bishop should persuade <num value="2">two</num> fugitive ministers of the Vaudois<note><hi rend=italics>Ante</hi>, p. <num value="308">308</num>.</note> to return to their country, and furnish them with <num value="20">20</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> towards their journey, at that very time when nothing but universal destruction was to be expected, assuring them and showing them from the Apocalypse, that their countrymen should be returned safely to their country before they arrived.

confidence how that prophecy of the witnesses should come to pass, just at the time, and the very month, he had spoken of some years before. 
<p>I afterwards went with him to Mr. Boyle and Lady Rane lagh his sister, to whom he explained the necessity of it s<*>
fully, and so learnedly made out, with what events were immediately to follow, viz. the French King's ruin, the calling of the Jews to be near at hand, but that the Kingdom of Antichrist would not yet be utterly destroyed till <datestruct value="30"><year reg="30">30</year></datestruct> years, when Christ should begin the Millenium, not as personally and visibly reigning on earth, but that the true religion and universal peace should obtain through all the world. He showed how Mr. Brightman, Mr. Mede, and other interpreters of these events failed, by mistaking and reckoning the year as the Latins and others did, to consist of the present calculation, so many days to the year, whereas the Apocalypse reckons after the Persian account, as Daniel did, whose visions St. John all along explains as meaning only the Christian Church.

King William having vanquished King James in Ireland, there was much public rejoicing.

Schomberg was slain, and Dr. Walker,<note><p>George Walker, an Irish clergyman, who distinguished himself more in the camp than in the pulpit, and after successfully defending Protestant Londonderry against the Popish army under James II, accompanied William III. during his decisive campaign against his fatherin- law, till he was slain at the battle of the Boyne.</note> who so bravely defended Londonderry. King William received a slight wound by the grazing of a cannon bullet on his shoulder, which he endured with very little interruption of his pursuit.

This stout demeanour of the few Bishops who refused to take the oaths to King William, animated a great party to forsake the churches, so as to threaten a schism; though those who looked further into the ancient practice, found that when (as formerly) there were Bishops displaced on secular accounts, the people never refused to acknowledge the new Bishops, provided they were not hereties. The truth is, the whole clergy had till now stretched the duty of passive obedience, so that the proceedings against these Bishops gave no little occasion of exceptions; but this not amounting to heresy, there was a necessity of receiving the new Bishops, to prevent a failure of that order in the Church.&mdash;I went to visit Lord Clarendon in the <pb id="p.326" n="326">

This church, formerly built of timber on Hounslow-Heath by King James for the mass-priests, being begged by Dr. Tenison, rector of St. Martin's, was set up by that publicminded, charitable, and pious man near my son's dwelling in Dover Street, chiefly at the charge of the Doctor. I know him to be an excellent preacher and a fit person. This church, though erected in St. Martin's, which is the Doctor's parish, he was not only content, but was the sole industrious mover, that it should be made a separate parish, in regard of the neighbourhood having become so populous. Wherefore to countenance and introduce the new minister, and take possession of a gallery designed for my son's family, I went to London, where, 
<p><num value="19">19</num><hi rend=italics>th</hi>, in the morning Dr. Tenison preached the <num value="1">first</num> sermon, taking his text from Psalm xxvi. <num value="8">8</num>. &ldquo;Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.&rdquo; In concluding, he gave that this should be made a parish-church so soon as the Parliament sate, and was to be dedicated to the Holy Trinity,<note><p>This was never made a parish-church, but still remains a chapel, and is private property.

heard a sermon more apposite to the occasion. He modestly insinuated the obligation they had to that person who should be the author and promoter of such public works for the benefit of mankind, especially to the advantage of religion, such as building and endowing churches, hospitals, libraries, schools, procuring the best editions of useful books, by which he handsomely intimated who it was that had been so exemplary for his benefaction to that place. Indeed, that excellent person, Dr. Tenison, had also erected and furnished a public library,<note><hi rend=italics>Ante</hi>, p. <num value="204">204</num>.</note> [in St. Martin's]; and set up <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> free-schools at his own charges.

He spake of his civility to strangers, the great good which he did by his experience in medicine and chemistry, and to what noble ends he applied himself to his darling studies; the works both pious and useful which he published; the exact life he led, and the happy end he made. Something was touched of his sister, the Lady Ranelagh, who died but a few days before him. And truly all this was but his due, without any grain of flattery.

Being asked by this Lord why they would not prescribe it, Dr. Lower said it would spoil their practice, or some such expression, and at last confessed it was a remedy fit only for kings.&mdash;Exception was taken that the late Archbishop did not cause any of his Chaplains to use any office for the sick during his illness.

This paper was not found in time to be observed. There were other excellent things under her own hand, to the very least of her debts, which were very small, and every thing in that exact method, as seldom is found in any private person. In sum, she was such an admirable woman, abating for taking the Crown without a more due apology, as does, if possible, outdo the renowned Queen Elizabeth.

<p><num value="26">26</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> There was now a conspiracy of about <num value="30">thirty</num> knights, gentlemen, captains, many of them Irish and English Papists, and Nonjurors or Jacobites (so called), to murder King William on the <num value="1">first</num> opportunity of his going either from Kensington, or to hunting, or to the chapel; and, upon signal of fire to be given from Dover Cliff to Calais, an invasion was designed. In order to it there was a great army in readiness, men-of-war and transports, to join a general insurrection here, the Duke of Berwick having secretly come to London to head them, King James attending at Calais with the French army. It was discovered by some of their own party. <measure value="1000l." type=currency>&pound; <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct></measure> reward was offered to whoever could apprehend any of the <num value="30">thirty</num> named. Most of those who were engaged in it, were taken and secured. The Parliament, City, and all the nation, congratulate the discovery; and votes and resolutions were passed that, if King William should ever be assassinated, it should be revenged on the Papists and party through the nation; an Act of Association drawing up to empower the Parliament to sit on any such accident, till the Crown should be disposed of according to the late settlement at the Revolution. All Papists, in the mean time, to be banished <num value="10">ten</num> miles from London. This put the nation into an incredible disturbance and general animosity against the French King and King James. The militia of the nation was raised, several regiments were sent for out of Flanders, and all things put in a posture to encounter a descent. This was so timed by the enemy, that whilst we were already much discontented by the greatness of the taxes, and corruption of the money, &amp;c., we had like to have had very few menof-war near our coasts; but so it pleased God that Admiral Rooke wanting a wind to pursue his voyage to the Straits, that squadron, with others at Portsmouth and other places, were still in the Channel, and were soon brought up to join with the rest of the ships which could be got together, so that there is hope this plot may be broken. I look on it as a very great deliverance and prevention by the providence of God. Though many did formerly pity King James's condition, this design of assassination and bringing over a French army, alienated many of his friends, and was <pb id="p.353" n="353">

<emph>(Here a leaf of the MS. is lost.)<note><p>In a letter to Dr. Bohun, dated Wotton, <datestruct VALUE="1696-01-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1696">1696</year></datestruct>-<num value="7">7</num>, Evelyn gives a minute and agreeable account of his domestic life and circumstances at this time: 
<p>&ldquo;Having been told that you have lately inquired what is become of your now old friends of Sayes Court, the date hereof will acquaint you where they are, and the sequel much of what they do and think. I believe I need not tell you that, after the marriage of my daughter, and the so kind offer of my good brother here, my then circumstances and times considered, I had reason to embrace it, not merely out of inclination to the place where I was born and have now an interest. 
<p>&ldquo;Amongst other things, I had paid <measure value="300l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="300">300</num></measure> for the renewing of my lease [at Deptford] with some augmentation of what I hold from the Crown, which the Duke of Leeds was supplanting me of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;but I am not here on free cost. 
<p>&ldquo;My Lord Godolphin (my ever noble patron and steady friend, now retired from a fatiguing station) got me to be named Treasurer to the Marine College erecting at Greenwich, with the salary of <measure value="200l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="200">200</num></measure> per annum, of which I have never yet received <num value="1">one</num> penny of the tallies assigned for it, now <num value="2">two</num> years at our Lady-day; my son-in-law, Draper, is my substitute. I have only had this opportunity to place my old (indeed faithful) servant J. Strd. in an employment at Greenwich, which with my other business, not small, among so many beggarly tenants as you know I have at Deptford [is some provision for him]. I have let my house to Captain Benbow, and have the mortification of seeing every day much of my former labours and expense there impairing, for want of a more polite tenant. 
<p>&ldquo;My grandson is so delighted in books, that he professes a library is to him the greatest recreation, so I give him free scope here, where I have near upon <num value="22000">22,000</num> [qu. <num value="2000">2000</num>?] (with my brother's), and whither I would bring the rest had I any room, which I have not, to my great regret; having here so little conversation with the learned, unless it be when Mr. Wotton [Dr. Bentley's friend] comes now and then to visit me, he being tutor to Mr. Finch's son at Albury, but which he is now leaving to go to his living, that without books, and the best wife and brother in the world, I were to be pitied; but, with these subsidiaries, and the revising some of my old impertinences, to which I am adding a Discourse I made on Medals (lying by me long before Obadiah Walker's Treatise appeared), I pass some of my Attic nights, if I may be so vain as to name them, with the author of those Criticisms. For the rest, I am planting an evergreen grove here to an old house ready to drop, the economy and hospitality of which my good old brother will not depart from, but <hi rend=italics>more veterum</hi> kept a Christmas, in which we had not fewer than <num value="300">three hundred</num> bumpkins every holy-day. 
<p>&ldquo;We have here a very convenient apartment of <num value="5">five</num> rooms together besides a pretty closet, which we have furnished with the spoils of Sayes Court, and is the raree-show of the whole neighbourhood, and in truth we live easy as to all domestic cares. Wednesday and Saturday nights we call Lecture-nights, when my wife and myself take our turns to read the packets of all the news sent constantly from London, which serves us for discourse till fresh news comes; and so you have the history of a very old man and his no young companion, whose society I have enjoyed more to my satisfaction these <num value="3">three</num> years here, than in almost <num value="50">fifty</num> before, but am now every day trussing up to be gone, I hope to a better place. 
<p>&ldquo;My daughter, Draper, being brought to bed in the Christmasholi- days of a fine boy, has given an heir to a most deserving husband, a prudent, well-natured gentlemen, a man of bussiness, like to be very rich, and deserving to be so, among the happiest pairs I think in England, and to my daughter's and our hearts' desire. She has also a fine girl, and a mother-in-law exceedingly fond of my daughter, and a most excellent woman, charitable and of a very sweet disposition. They all live together, keep each their coach, and with as suitable an equipage as any in town.&rdquo;</note></emph>

<p>The Czar of Muscovy being come to England, and having a mind to see the building of ships, hired my house at Sayes Court, and made it his court and palace, new furnished for him by the King.<note><p>While the Czar was in his house, Evelyn's servant writes to him: &ldquo;There is a house full of people, and right nasty.

He was religious, sober, and temperate, and of so hospitable a nature, that no family in the county maintained that ancient custom of keeping, as it were, open house the whole year in the same manner, or gave more noble or free entertainment to the county on all occasions, so that his house was never free. There were sometimes <num value="20">twenty</num> persons more than his family, and some that stayed there all the summer, to his no small expense; by this he gained the universal love of the county. He was born at Wotton, went from the free-school at Guildford to Trinity College, Oxford, thence to the Middle Temple, as gentlemen of the best quality did, but without intention to study the law as a profession. He married the daughter of Colwall,<note><p>Mary, daughter and co-heiress of Daniel Caldwell, of Horndon, in Essex.

He was a young man of good understanding, but, overindulg- ing his ease and pleasure, grew so very corpulent, contrary to the constitution of the rest of his father's relations, that he died.

<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>
he had several children of both sexes. This lady died, leaving only <num value="2">two</num> daughters and a son. The younger daughter died before marriage; the other afterwards married Sir Cyril Wych, a noble and learned gentleman (son of Sir &mdash;&mdash; Wych), who had been Ambassador at Constantinople, and was afterwards made <num value="1">one</num> of the Lords Justices of Ireland. Before this marriage, her only brother married the daughter of &mdash;&mdash; Eversfield, of Sussex, of an honourable family, but left a widow without any child living; he died about <datestruct value="1691--"><year reg="1691">1691</year></datestruct>, and his wife not many years after, and my brother resettled the whole estate on me.

My brother died on the <datestruct VALUE="-10-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, in a good old age and great reputation, making his beloved daughter, Lady Wych, sole executrix, leaving me only his library and some pictures of my father, mother, &amp;c. She buried him with extraordinary solemnity, rather as a nobleman than as a private gentleman. There were, as I computed, above <num value="2000">2000</num> persons at the funeral, all the gentlemen of the county doing him the last honours. I returned to London, till my lady should dispose of herself and family.

She died in childbed a few days before, to the excessive sorrow of her husband, who ordered the preacher to declare that it was on her exemplary life, exhortations and persuasion, that he totally changed the course of his life, which was before in great danger of being perverted; following the mode of this dissolute age. Her devotion, early piety, charity, fastings, economy, disposition of her time in reading, praying, recollections in her own hand-writing of what she heard and read, and her conversation were most exemplary.

This was so resented that, though it was usual to desire these anniversary-sermons to be printed, they refused thanks to him, and ordered that in future no <num value="1">one</num> should preach before them, who was not either a Dean or a Doctor of Divinity.

The now Duke their uncle is a Protestant. <pb id="p.372" n="372"> 
<note place=marg>LONDON,</note>

<p>The Parliament nominated <num value="14">fourteen</num> persons to go into Ireland as Commissioners to dispose of the forfeited estates there, towards payment of the debts incurred by the late war, but which the King had in great measure given to some of his favourites of both sexes, Dutch and others of little merit, and very unseasonably. That this might be done without suspicion of interest in the Parliament, it was ordered that no member of either House should be in the Commission.&mdash;The great contest between the Lords and Commons concerning the Lords' power of amendments and rejecting bills tacked to the money-bill, carried for the Commons. However, this tacking of bills is a novel practice, suffered by King Charles II., who, being continually in want of money, let anything pass rather than not have wherewith to feed his extravagance. This was carried but by <num value="1">one</num> voice in the Lords, all the Bishops following the Court, save <num value="1">one</num>; so that near <num value="60">sixty</num> bills passed, to the great triumph of the Commons and Country-party, but high regret of the Court, and those to whom the King had given large estates in Ireland. Pity it is, that things should be brought to this extremity, the government of this nation being so equally poised between King and subject; but we are satisfied with nothing: and, whilst there is no perfection on this side Heaven, methinks both might be contented without straining things too far. Amongst the rest, there passed a law as to Papists' estates, that if <num value="1">one</num> turned not Protestant before eighteen years of age, it should pass to his next Protestant heir. This indeed seemed a hard law, but not only the usage of the French King to his Protestant subjects, but the indiscreet insolence of the Papists here, going in triumphant and public processions with their Bishops, with banners and trumpets in divers places (as is said) in the northern counties, has brought it on their party.

But the Commons had now so mortified the Court-party, and property and liberty were so much invaded in all the neighbouring kingdoms, that their jealousy made them cautious, and every day strengthened the law which protected the people from tyranny.

Besides what he published of an account of the navy, as he found and left it, he had for divers years under his hand the History of the Navy, or <hi rend=italics>Navalia</hi>, as he called it; but how far advanced, and what will follow of his, is left, I suppose, to his sister's son, Mr. Jackson, a young gentleman, whom Mr. Pepys had educated in all sorts of useful learning, sending him to travel abroad, from whence he returned with extraordinary accomplishments, and worthy to be heir. Mr. Pepys had been for near <num value="40">forty</num> years so much my particular friend, that Mr. Jackson sent me complete mourning, desiring me to be <num value="1">one</num> to hold up the pall at his magnificent obsequies; but my indisposition hindered me from doing him this last office.

<p><num value="26">26</num>-<num value="7">7</num><hi rend=italics>th.</hi> The effects of the hurricane and tempest of wind, rain, and lightning, through all the nation, especially London, were very dismal.

As to my own losses, the subversion of woods and timber, both ornamental and valuable, through my whole estate, and about my house the woods crowning the garden-mount, and growing along the park-meadow, the damage to my own dwelling, farms, and outhouses, is almost tragical, not to be paralleled with any thing happening in our age. I am not able to describe it; but submit to the pleasure of Almighty God.

The day before was wet and stormy, but this was <num value="1">one</num> of the most serene and calm days that had been all the year. 
<p><hi rend=italics>October.</hi> The year has been very plentiful. 
<p><num value="31">31</num><hi rend=italics>st.</hi> Being my birthday and the <num value="84">84th</num> year of my life, after particular reflections on my concerns and passages of the year, I set some considerable time of this day apart, to recollect and examine my state and condition, giving God thanks, and acknowledging His infinite mercies to me and mine, begging His blessing, and imploring His protection for the year following. 
<p><hi rend=italics>December.</hi> Lord Clarendon presented me with the <num value="3">three</num> volumes of his father's History of the Rebellion. 
<p>My Lord of Canterbury wrote to me for suffrage for Mr. Clarke's continuance this year in the Boyle Lecture, which I willingly gave for his excellent performance of this year. 
<p><num value="9">9</num><hi rend=italics>th February.</hi> I went to wait on my Lord Treasurer, where was the victorious Duke of Marlborough, who came to me and took me by the hand with extraordinary familiarity and civility, as formerly he was used to do, without any alteration of his good-nature. He had a most rich George in a sardonyx set with diamonds of very great value; for the rest, very plain. I had not seen him for some years, and believed he might have forgotten me.

<p><num value="11">11</num><hi rend=italics>th March.</hi> An exceeding dry season.&mdash;Great loss by fire, burning the outhouses and famous stable of the Earl of Nottingham, at Burleigh [Rutlandshire], full of rich goods and furniture, by the carelessness of a servant. A little before, the same happened at Lord Pembroke's, at Wilton. The old Countess of Northumberland, Dowager of Algernon Percy, Admiral of the Fleet to King Charles I., died in the <num value="83">83rd</num> year of her age.

He was living in Westminster, in <datestruct value="1692--"><year reg="1692">1692</year></datestruct>, in good repute for his practice in the faculty of physic. He published several things. Wood's <hi rend=italics>Fasti Oxon.</hi>, p. <num value="741">741</num>.</note> the famous chemist. We had long conversation about the philosopher's elixir, which he believed attainable, and had seen projection himself by <num value="1">one</num> who went under the name of Mundanus, who sometimes came among the adepts, but was unknown as to his country, or abode; of this the Doctor has written a treatise in Latin, full of very astonishing relations. He is a very learned person, formerly a Fellow of St. John's College, Oxford,<note><p>He was afterwards a Fellow of Morton. He died in <datestruct value="1707--"><year reg="1707">1707</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="84">84</num>. Campbell, in his edition of the <hi rend=italics>Biog. Brit.</hi>, speaks very highly of him; but Kippis, in the new edition of that Work, differs much from the Doctor's opinions, though he allows him to have been a very learned man. Evelyn must have mistaken Dr. Dickinson as to his not knowing who Mundanus was, for in <datestruct value="1686--"><year reg="1686">1686</year></datestruct> the Doctor printed a letter to him with his answer from Paris; and in the latter, Mundanus says he made <num value="2">two</num> projections in his presence <hi rend=italics>Biog.

<p><datestruct VALUE="1687-02--"><month reg="02">Feb.</month> <year reg="1687">1687</year></datestruct>-<num value="8">8</num>, there was printed what was called &ldquo;A true and perfect narrative of the strange and unexpected finding the Crucifix and Goldchain of that pious Prince, St. Edward the King and Confessor, which was found after <num value="630">six hundred and thirty</num> years' interment, and presented to his most Sacred Majesty, King James the <num value="2">Second</num>. By Charles Taylour, Gent. London, printed by J. B., and are to be sold by Randal Taylor, near Stationers' Hall, <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>.&rdquo; 
<p>He says, that &ldquo;on St. Barnaby's Day (<datestruct VALUE="-06-11"><day reg="11">11</day> <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>), <datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>, between <num value="11">11</num> and <num value="12">12</num> at noon, he went with <num value="2">two</num> friends to see the coffin of Edward the Confessor, having heard that it was broke; fetched a ladder, looked on the coffin and found a hole as reported, put his hand into the hole, and turning the bones which he felt there, drew from under the shoulderbones a crucifix richly adorned and enamelled, and a golden chain of <num value="24">twenty-four</num> inches long to which it was fixed; showed them to his <num value="2">two</num> friends; was afraid to take them away, till he had acquainted the Dean; put them into the coffin again. But the Dean not being to be spoke with then, and fearing this treasure might be taken by some other, he went <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> hours afterward to <num value="1">one</num> of the choir, acquainted him with what he had found, who accompanied him to the monument, from whence he again drew the crucifix and chain; his friend advised him to keep th<*>n, until he could show them to the Dean (the Bishop of Rochester): kept them <num value="3">three</num> weeks before he could speak to the Bishop; went to the Archbishop of York, and showed them; next morning, the Archbishop of York carried him to the Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth, and showed them. After this, he procured an exact drawing to be made of them; showed them to Sir William Dugdale.&mdash;<datestruct VALUE="-07-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, the Archbishop of Canterbury told the Bishop of Rochester, who, about <num value="4">four</num> that afternoon, sent for him, and took him to Whitehall, that he might present them to the King; which he did accordingly. The King ordered a new strong wooden coffin to be made to inclose the broken <num value="1">one</num>. The links of the chain oblong, and curiously wrought; the upper <pb id="p.391" n="391"> part joined by a locket, composed of a large round knob of gold, massy, in circumference as big as a milled shilling, half an inch thick; round this went a wire and half a dozen little beads, hanging loose, running to and again on the same, all of pure gold, finely wrought; on each side of the locket were set <num value="2">two</num> large square stones (supposed to be rubies). From each side of this locket, fixed to <num value="2">two</num> rings of gold, the chain descends, and, meeting below, passes through a square piece of gold, of a convenient bigness, made hollow for the same purpose. This gold, wrought into several angles, was painted with divers colours, resembling gems or precious stones, to which the crucifix was joined, yet to be taken off by help of a screw. The form of the cross nearest that of an humett&eacute;e flory (among the heralds), or rather the botany [boton&eacute;e]; yet the pieces not of equal length, the perpendicular beam being near <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4">fourth</num> part longer than the traverse, as being <num value="4">four</num> inches to the extremity, whilst the other scarce exceeds <num value="3">three</num>; yet all neatly turned at the ends, and the botons enamelled with figures thereon. The cross of the same gold as the chain, but exceeds it by its rich enamel, having on <num value="1">one</num> side the picture of our Saviour Christ in his passion wrought thereon, and an eye from above easting a kind of beam on him; on the reverse, picture of a Benedictine monk in his habit, and on each side of him these capital Roman letters:&mdash;

<p>And on the left, 
<p>This cross is hollow, to be opened by <num value="2">two</num> little screws towards the top, wherein it is presumed some relic might have been conserved. William I. commanded the coffin to be enshrined, and the shrine covered with plates of gold and silver, adorned with pearls and precious stones. About <num value="136">one hundred and thirty-six</num> years after, the Abbot resolved to inspect the body, said to be incorruptible, and, on opening, found it to be so, being perfect, the limbs flexible: the face covered; Gundolph, Bishop of Rochester, withdrew the cover, but, with great reverence, covered it again, changing the former vestments, and putting on others of equal price. In <datestruct value="1163--"><year reg="1163">1163</year></datestruct>, Thomas &agrave; Becket procured a canonisation of the King, and in the ceremony the Abbot opened the coffin, found the body lying in rich vestments of cloth of gold, having on his feet buskins of purple, and shoes of great price; the body uncorrupted; removed the whole body from the stone repository to another of wood, some assisting at the head, others at the arms and legs; they lifted it gently, and laid the corpse <num value="1">first</num> on tapestry spread on the floor, and then wrapping the same in silken cloths of great value, they put it into the wooden chest, <hi rend=italics>with all those things that were found in the former</hi>, except the gold ring which was on the King's finger, which the Abbot, 
<hi rend=italics>out of devotion, retained</hi>, and ordered it to be kept in the Treasury of the Abbey. 
<p>&ldquo;In <datestruct value="1226--"><year reg="1226">1226</year></datestruct>, King Henry III. again removed the coffin to a chapel built for the purpose.&rdquo; <pb id="p.392" n="392">

There is at Wotton a copy of that on Manu scripts in <num value="13">thirteen</num> leaves, <num value="4">4</num>to., which seems to contain all he intended ou this subject. There is also a chapter of an essay, entitled, &ldquo;De Baculis,&rdquo; which from the proem seems to have been intended as jocular, but it begins with great gravity.</note></LIST>
 
<p>In a letter to Dr. BEALE, <datestruct VALUE="1679-07-11"><day reg="11">11</day> <month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1679">1679</year></datestruct>, Evelyn says, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>I have sometimes thought of publishing a Treatise of <hi rend=italics>Acetaria</hi>, which (though but <num value="1">one</num> of the chapters of <hi rend=italics>Elysium Britannicum</hi>) would make a competent <pb id="p.393" n="393"> volume, accompanied with other necessaries, according to my manner; but whilst I as often think of performing my so long-since promised (more universal) Hortulan work, I know not how to take that chapter out, and single it for the press, without some blemish to the rest. When again I consider into what an ocean I am plunged, how much I have written and collected for above these <num value="20">twenty</num> years upon this fruitful and inexhaustible subject (I mean Horticulture) not yet fully digested to my mind, and what insuperable pains it will require to insert the (daily increasing) particulars into what I have already in some measure prepared, and which must of necessity be done by my own hand, I am almost out of hope, that I shall ever have strength and leisure to bring it to maturity, having for the last <num value="10">ten</num> years of my life been in perpetual motion, and hardly <num value="2">two</num> months in a year at my own habitation, or conversant with my family. 
<p>You know what my charge and care has been during the late un happy war with the Hollanders; and what it has cost me as to avocations, and for the procuring money, and attending the Lord Treasurer, &amp;c., to discharge the quarters of many thousands. 
<p>Since that, I have upon me no fewer than <num value="3">three</num> executorships, besides other domestic concerns, either of them enough to distract a more steady and composed genius than is mine. 
<p>Superadd to these the public confusions in church and kingdom (never to be sufficiently deplored), and which cannot but most sensibly touch every sober and honest man. 
<p>In the midst of these disturbances, who but Dr. Beale (that stands upon the tower, looks down unconcernedly on all those tempests) can think of gardens and fish-ponds, and the <hi rend=italics>delices</hi> and ornaments of peace and tranquility? With no little conflict and force on my other business, I have yet at last, and as I was able, published a <num value="3">third</num> edition of my &lsquo;Sylva,&rsquo; and with such additions as occurred; and this in truth only to pacify the importunity of very many (besides the printer), who quite tired me with calling on me for it, and above all, threatening to reprint it with all its former defects, if I did not speedily prevent it. I am only vexed that it proving so popular as in so few years to pass so many impressions, and (as I hear) gratify the avaricious printer with some hundreds of pounds, there had not been some course taken in it for the benefit of our Society. It is apparent, that near <measure value="500l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="500">500</num></measure> has been already gotten by it; but we are not yet economists. 
<p>You know what pillars we have lost: Palmer, Moray,<note><p>Dudley Palmer, Esq., born in <datestruct value="1602--"><year reg="1602">1602</year></datestruct>, and died in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, and Sir Robert Moray, Knt., who died <datestruct VALUE="1673-07-4"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=4>4</day>, <year reg=1673>1673</year></datestruct>, <num value="2">two</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> Council of the Royal Society.</note> Chester,<note><p>John Wilkins, D.D., Bishop of Chester. He died <datestruct VALUE="1672-11-19"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=19>19</day>, <year reg=1672>1672</year></datestruct>.</note>
Oldenburg,<note><p>Secretary to the Royal Society who died in <datestruct VALUE="1677-09--"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>.</note> &amp;c.; and through what other discouragements we still labour; and therefore you will excuse the zeal and fervour of what I have added in my Epistle to the Reader, if at length it be possible to <pb id="p.394" n="394"> raise up some generous soul to free us, or emerge out of our difficulties. In all events you will see where my inclinations are fixed, and that love is stronger than death; and secular affairs, which is the burial of all philosophical speculations and improvements; though they can never in the least diminish the great esteem I have of your friendship, and the infinite obligations I daily receive from your favours.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Of Books which he had designed to publish, we find various Memoranda in his letters, &amp;c. 
<p>In a letter to Mr. BOYLE, <datestruct VALUE="1659-08-8"><day reg="8">8</day> <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1659">1659</year></datestruct>, he says he had intended to write a <hi rend=italics>History of Trades;</hi> but had given it up, from the great difficulty he found in the attempt. 
<p>In another, <datestruct VALUE="1664-11-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> <month reg="11">Nov.</month>, <year reg="1664">1664</year></datestruct>, he says, &ldquo;<num value="1">One</num> Rhea [qu. Ray?] has published a very useful book concerning the Culture of Flowers; but it does nothing reach my long-since attempted design on that entire subject, with all its ornaments and circumstances, but God only knows when my opportunities will permit me to bring it to maturity.&rdquo; 
<p>In the Preface to the &ldquo;Acetaria,&rdquo; published in <datestruct value="1669--"><year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct>, he mentions a Work in which he had spent upwards of <num value="40">forty</num> years, and his collections for which had in that time filled several <num value="1000">thousand</num> pages. The author of the &ldquo;Biographia Britannica&rdquo; believes that this was the work, part of which he had showed to his friends under the title of &ldquo;Elysium Britannicum,&rdquo; but which in that Preface he calls &ldquo;The Plan of a Royal Garden,&rdquo; &amp;c.; and that his &ldquo;Acetaria&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gardener's Kalendar&rdquo; were parts of it. This is confirmed by the preceding letter to Dr. Beale. 
<p>Amongst the MSS. at Wotton there are parts of <num value="2">two</num> volumes with the running title of &ldquo;Elysium Britannicum,&rdquo; consisting of miscellaneous observations on a great variety of subjects, but nothing digested, except a printed sheet of the contents of the intended Work, as follows:
