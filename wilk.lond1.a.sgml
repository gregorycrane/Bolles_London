<P>On the city side of the Thames are views of the <num value="3">Three</num> Cranes, Queen Hythe, Baynard's Castle, Bridewell, &amp;c. &amp;c.; all which were destroyed by the great fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, and have been since rebuilt, in a manner very dissimilar to the representations here given. <pb id="p.3" n="3">

<P>London from its earliest foundation has been peculiarly fated to suffer by the calamity of fire. 
<P>During the time of the Emperor Nero, A. D. <datestruct value="61"><year reg="61">61</year></datestruct>, the enraged Boadicea ravaged and burnt the city in revenge for the insults offered to her and her daughters by the Romans, in whose possession London then was. 
<P>The years <num value="764">764</num>, <num value="798">798</num>, and <num value="801">801</num>, were very calamitous, particularly the year <datestruct value="798"><year reg="798">798</year></datestruct>, in which the city was nearly destroyed, and many of the inhabitants perished. 
<P>The Danes almost consumed it in A. D. <datestruct value="852"><year reg="852">852</year></datestruct>. A like fatality attended it in the years <num value="982">982</num>, and <datestruct value="1077--"><year reg="1077">1077</year></datestruct>; the latter of which, according to the Saxon Chronicle, was the most terrible casual fire that had ever happened in the metropolis, &ldquo;the greatest part being laid in ashes.&rdquo; 
<P>In the year <datestruct value="1086"><year reg="1086">1086</year></datestruct>, a fire commenced at the west gate, and burnt the city, including St. Paul's Cathedral, to the east gate, laying the whole in ruins. A similar calamity occured in <datestruct value="1092--"><year reg="1092">1092</year></datestruct>. 
<P>A great fire, in <datestruct value="1136--"><year reg="1136">1136</year></datestruct>, commenced at London Stone, and consumed eastward to Aldgate, and westward to St. Erkenwald's shrine St. Paul's Cathedral. In this tremendous destruction was included London Bridge, then of wood, St. Mary Overy's Church, and great part of Southwark. It again experienced destruction by the fiery element in the years <datestruct value="1212--"><year reg=1212>1212</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1232--"><year reg=1232>1232</year></datestruct>, in the latter of which the city was nearly destroyed. 
<P>The conflagration in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, of which we have given a representation, is usually called &ldquo;THE GREAT FIRE,&rdquo; on account of its extent, and the vastness of the damage. As there is not existing a more copious or more interesting account than that by the great Earl of Clarendon, at the same period, it cannot be uninteresting to subjoin it in his Lordship's own words: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><P>It was upon the <num value="1">first</num> day of that September, in the dismal year of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct> (in which many prodigies were expected, and so many really fell out), that the memorable and terrible fire brake out in London, which begun about midnight, or nearer the morning of Sunday, in a baker's shop, at the end of Thames Street, next the Tower, there being many little narrow alleys, and very poor houses, about the place where it <num value="1">first</num> appeared; and then finding such store of combustible materials, as that street is always furnished with in timber houses, the fire prevailed so powerfully, that that whole street and the neighbourhood was in so short a time turned to ashes, that few persons had time to save and preserve any of their goods; but were a heap of people almost as dead with the sudden distraction, as the ruins were which they sustained. The magistrates of the city assembled quickly together, and with the usual remedies of buckets, which they were provided with: but the fire was too ravenous to be extinguished with such quantities of water as those instruments conld apply to it, and fastened still upon new materials before it had destroyed the old. And though it raged furiously all that day, to that degree that all men stood amazed, as spectators only, no man knowing what remedy to apply, nor the magistrates what orders to give: yet it kept within some compass, burned what was next, and laid hold only on both sides; and the greatest apprehension was of the Tower, and all considerations entered upon how to secure that place. 
<P>But in the night the wind changed, and carried the danger from thence, but with so great and irresistible violence, that it scattered the fire from pursuing the line it was in with all its force, and spread it over the city; so that they, who went late to bed at a great distance from any place where the fire prevailed, were awakened before morning with their own houses being in a flame; and whilst endeavour was made to quench that, other houses were discovered to be burning, which were near no place from whence they could imagine the fire could come; all which kindled another fire in the breasts of men, almost as dangerous as that within their houses. 
<P>Monday morning produced <num value="1">first</num> a jealousy, and then an universal conclusion, that this fire came not by chance, nor did they care where it began; but the breaking out in several places at so great distance from each other, made it evident that it was by conspiracy and combination. And this determination could not hold long without discovery of the wicked authors, who were concluded to be all the Dutch and all the French in the town, though they had inhabited the same places above <num value="20">twenty</num> years. All of that kind, or, if they were strangers, of what nation soever, were laid hold of; and after all the ill usage that can consist in words, and some blows and kicks, they were thrown into prison. And shortly after, the same conclusion comprehended all the Roman Catholics, who were in the same predicament of guilt and danger, and quickly found that their only safety consisted in keeping within doors; and yet some of them, and of quality, were taken by force out of their houses and carried to prison. 
<P>When this rage spread as far as the fire, and every hour brought reports of some bloody effects of it, worse than in truth there were, the King distributed many of the Privy Council into several quarters of the city, to prevent, by their authorities, those inhumanities which he heard were committed. In the mean time, even they, or any other person thought it not safe to declare, &lsquo;that they believed that the fire came by accident,&rsquo; &lsquo;or that it was not a plot of the Dutch and the French, and Papists, to burn the city;&rsquo; which was so generally believed, and in the best company, that he who said the contrary was suspected for a conspirator, or at best a favourer of them. It could not be conceived, how a house that was distant a mile from any part of the fire could suddenly be in a flame, without some particular malice; and this case fell out every hour. When a man at the farthest end of Bread Street had made a shift to get out of his house his best and most portable goods because the fire had approached near them, he no sooner had secured them, as he thought, in some friend's house in Holborn, which was believed a safe distance, but he saw that very house, and none else near it, in a sudden flame: nor did there want, in this woful distemper, the testimony of witnesses who saw this villany committed, and apprehended men who they were ready to swear threw fire-balls into houses, which were presently burning. <pb id="p.4" n="4"> 
<P>The fire and the wind continued in the same excess all Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, till afternoon, and flung and scattered brands burning into all quarters; the nights more terrible than the days, and the light the same, the light of the fire supplying that of the sun. And indeed whoever was an eye-witness of that terrible prospect, can never have so lively an image of the last conflagration till he beholds it; the faces of all people in a wonderful dejection and discomposure, not knowing where they could repose themselves for <num value="1">one</num> hour's sleep, and no distance thought secure from the fire, which suddenly started up, before it was suspected; so that people left their houses, and carried away their goods from many places which received no hurt, and whither they afterwards returned again; all the fields full of women and children, who had made a shift to bring thither some goods and conveniences to rest upon, as safer than any houses, where yet they felt such intolerable heat and drought, as if they had been in the middle of the fire. The King and the Duke, who rode from <num value="1">one</num> place to another, and put themselves into greater dangers amongst the burning and falling houses, to give advice and direction what was to be done, underwent as much fatigue as the meanest, and had as little sleep or rest; and the faces of all men appeared ghastly, and in the highest confusion. The country sent in carts to help those miserable people who had saved any goods: and by this means, and the help of coaches, all the neighbour villages were filled with more people than they could contain, and more goods than they could find room for; so that those fields became likewise as full as the other about London and Westminster. 
<P>It was observed, that where the fire prevailed most, when it met with brick buildings, if it was not repulsed, it was so well resisted that it made a much slower progress; and when it had done its worst, that the timber and all the combustible matter fell, it fell down to the bottom within the house, and the walls stood and enclosed the fire, and it was burned out without making a farther progress in many of those places; and then the vacancy so interrupted the fury of it, that many times the <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> next houses stood without much damage. Besides the spreading, insomuch as all London seemed but <num value="1">one</num> fire in the breadth of it, it seemed to continue in its full fury a direct line to the Thames side, all Cheapside from beyond the Exchange, through Fleet Street; insomuch as for that breadth, taking in both sides as far as the Thames, there was scarce a house or church standing from the bridge to Dorset House, which was burned on Tuesday night after Baynard's Castle. 
<P>On Wednesday morning, when the King saw that neither the fire decreased nor the wind lessened, he even despaired of preserving Whitehall, but was more afraid of Westminster Abbey. But having observed by his having visited all places, that where there was any vacant place between the houses, there the progress of the fire was much less, changed its course and went to the water-side, he gave order for pulling down many houses about Whitehall, some whereof were newly built and hardly finished, and sent many of his choice goods by water to Hampton Court; as most of the persons of quality in the Strand, who had the benefit of the river, got barges and other vessels, and sent their furniture for their houses to some houses some miles out of the town. And very many on both sides of the Strand, who knew not whither to go, and scarce what they did, fled with their families out of their houses into the streets, that they might not be within when the fire fell upon their houses. 
<P>But it pleased God, contrary to all expectation, that on Wednesday, about <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> of the clock in the afternoon, the wind fell; and as in an instant the fire decreased, having burned all on the Thames side to the new buildings of the Inner Temple, next to Whitefriars, and having consumed them, was stopped by that vacancy from proceeding farther into that house, but laid hold on some old buildings which joined to Ram Alley, and swept all those into Fleet Street. And the other side being likewise destroyed to Fetter Lane, it advanced no farther; but left the other part of Fleet Street to the Temple Bar, and all the Strand, unhurt, but what the damage the owners of the houses had done to themselves by endeavouring to remove; and it ceased in all other parts of the town near the same time. 
<P>When the night, though far from being a quiet <num value="1">one</num>, had somewhat lessened the consternation, the <num value="1">first</num> care the King took was, that the country might speedily supply markets in all places, that they who had saved themselves from burning might not be in danger of starving: and if there had not been extraordinary care and diligence used, many would have perished that way. The vast destruction of corn, and all other sorts of provisions, in those parts where the fire had prevailed, had not only left all that people destitute of all that was to be eat or drank; but the bakers and brewers which inhabited the other parts which were unhurt, had forsaken their houses, and carried away all that was portable; insomuch as many days passed before they were enough in their wits and in their houses to fall to their occupations; and those parts of the town which God had spared and preserved were many hours without any thing to eat, as well as those who were in the fields. And yet it can hardly be conceived, how great a supply of all kinds was brought from all places within <num value="4">four</num> and <num value="20">twenty</num> hours. And which was more miraculous, in <num value="4">four</num> days, in all the fields about the town, which had seemed covered with those whose habitations were burned, and with the goods which they had saved, there was scarce a man to be seen: all found shelter in so short a time, either in those parts which remained of the city and in the suburbs, or in the neighbour villages; all kind of people expressing a marvellous charity towards those who appeared to be undone. And very many, with more expedition than can be conceived, set up little sheds of brick and timber upon the ruins of their own houses, where they chose rather to inhabit than in more convenient places, though they knew they could not long reside in those new buildings. 
<P>There was a very odd accident that confirmed many in what they were inclined to believe, and startled others, who thought the conspiracy impossible, since no combination not very discernible and discovered could have effected that mischief, in which the immediate hand of God was so visible. Amongst many Frenchmen who had been sent to Newgate, there was <num value="1">one</num> Hubert, a young man of <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> and <num value="20">twenty</num> years of age, the <pb id="p.5" n="5"> son of a famous watchmaker in the city of Roan; and this fellow had wrought in the same profession with several men in London, and had for many years both in Roan and in London, been looked upon as distracted. This man confessed &lsquo;that he had set the <num value="1">first</num> house on fire, and that he had been hired in Paris a year before to do &lsquo;it: that there were <num value="3">three</num> more combined with him to do the same thing, and that they came over together into &lsquo;England to put it in execution in the time of the plague; but when they were in London, he and <num value="2">two</num> of his &lsquo;companions went into Sweden, and returned from thence in the latter end of August, and he resolved to &lsquo;undertake it; and that the <num value="2">two</num> others went away into France.&rsquo; 
<P>The whole examination was so senseless, that the Chief Justice, who was not looked upon as a man who wanted rigour, did not believe any thing he said. He was asked, &lsquo;who it was in Paris that suborned him to this &lsquo;action?&rsquo; to which he answered, &lsquo;that he did not know, having never seen him before;&rsquo; and in the enlarging upon that point he contradicted himself in many particulars. Being asked &lsquo;what money he had received to &lsquo;perform a service of so much hazard,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;he had received but a pistole, but was promised <num value="5">five</num> pistoles &lsquo;more when he should have done his work;&rsquo; and many such unreasonable things, that nobody present credited any thing he said. However, they durst not slight the evidence, but put him to a particular, in which he so fully confirmed all that he had said before, that they were surprised with wonder, and knew not afterwards what to say or think. They asked him, &lsquo;if he knew the place where he <num value="1">first</num> put fire;&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;that he knew &lsquo;it very well, and would show it to any body.&rsquo; Upon this the Chief Justice, and many Aldermen who sate with him, sent a guard of substantial citizens with the prisoner, that he might show them the house; and they <num value="1">first</num> led him to a place at some distance from it, and asked him &lsquo;if that were it;&rsquo; to which he answered presently &lsquo;no, it was lower, nearer to the Thames.&rsquo; The house and all which were near it were so covered and buried in ruins, that the owners themselves, without some infallible mark, could very hardly have said where their own houses had stood; but this man led them directly to the place, described how it stood, the shape of the little yard, the fashion of the door and windows, and where he <num value="1">first</num> put the fire; and all this with such exactness, that they who had dwelt long near it could not so particularly have described all particulars. 
<P>This silenced all farther doubts. And though the Chief Justice told the King, &lsquo;that all his discourse was &lsquo;so disjointed that he did not believe him guilty;&rsquo; nor was there <num value="1">one</num> man who prosecuted or accused him: yet upon his own confession, and so sensible a relation of all that he had done, accompanied with so many circumstances (though without the least show of compunction or sorrow for what he said he had done, nor yet seeming to justify or to take delight in it; but being asked whether he was not sorry for the wickedness, and whether he intended to do so much, he gave no answer at all, or made reply to what was said: and with the same temper died), the Jury found him guilty, and he was executed accordingly. And though no man could imagine any reason why a man should so desperately throw away his life, which he might have saved, though he had been guilty, since he was only accused upon his own confession; yet neither the Judges nor any present at the trial did believe him guilty, but that he was a poor distracted wretch weary of his life, and chose to part with it this way. Certain it is, that upon the strictest examination that could be afterwards made by the King's command, and then by the diligence of the House, that upon the jealousy and rumour made a committee, that was very diligent and solicitous to make that discovery, there was never any probable evidence (that poor creature's only excepted) that there was any other cause of that woful fire, than the displeasure of God Almighty: the <num value="1">first</num> accident of the beginning in a baker's house, where there was so great a stock of faggots, and the neighbourhood of much combustible matter, of pitch and rosin and the like, led it in an instant from house to house through Thames Street, with the agitation of so terrible a wind to scatter and disperse it. 
<P>Let the cause be what it would, the effect was very terrible; for above <num value="2">two</num> parts of <num value="3">three</num> of that great city were burned to ashes, and those the most rich and wealthy parts of the city, where the greatest warehouses and best shops stood. The Royal Exchange with all the streets about it, Lombard Street, Cheapside, Paternoster Row, St. Paul's Church, and almost all the other churches in the city, with the Old Bailey, Ludgate, all Paul's Churchyard even to the Thames, and the greatest part of Fleet Street, all which were places the best inhabited, were all burned without <num value="1">one</num> house remaining. 
<P>The value or estimate of what that devouring fire consumed, over and above the houses, could never be computed in any degree: for, besides that the <num value="1">first</num> night (which in a moment swept away the vast wealth of Thames Street) there was not anything that could be preserved in respect of the suddenness and amazement (all people being in their beds till the fire was in their houses, and so could save nothing but themselves), the next day with the violence of the wind increased the distraction; nor did many believe that the fire was near them, or that they had reason to remove their goods, till it was upon them and rendered it impossible. Then it fell out at a season in the year, the beginning of September, when very many of the substantial citizens and other wealthy men were in the country, whereof many had not left a servant in their houses, thinking themselves upon all ordinary accidents more secure in the goodness and kindness of their neighbours, than they could be in the fidelity of a servant; and whatsoever was in such houses was entirely consumed by the fire, or lost as to the owners. And of this classis of absent men, when the fire came where the lawyers had houses, as they had in many places, especially Serjeant's Inn in Fleet Street, with that part of the Inner Temple that was next it and Whitefriars, there was scarce a man to whom those lodgings appertained who was in town: so that whatsoever was there, their money, books, and papers, besides the evidences of many men's estates deposited in their hands, were all burned or lost, to a very great value. But of particular men's losses could never be made any computation. 
<P>It was an incredible damage that was and might rationally be computed to be sustained by <num value="1">one</num> small company, the company of Stationers, in books, paper, and the other lesser commodities which are vendible in that corporation, which amounted to no less than <measure value="200000l." type=currency><num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> pounds</measure>; in which prodigious loss there <pb id="p.6" n="6"> was <num value="1">one</num> circumstance very lamentable: all those who dweit near Paul's carried their goods, books, paper, and the like, as others of greater trades did their commodities, into the large vaults which were under St. Paul's Church, before the fire came thither; which vaults, though all the church above the ground was afterwards burned with all the houses round about, still stood firm and supported the foundation, and preserved all that was within them: until the impatience of those who had lost their houses, and whatsoever they had else, in the fire, made them very desirous to see what they had saved, upon which all their hopes were founded to repair the rest. 
<P>It was the <num value="4">fourth</num> day after the fire ceased to flame, though it still burned in the ruins, from whence there was still an intolerable heat, when the booksellers especially, and some other tradesmen, who had deposited all they had preserved in the greatest and most spacious vault, came to behold all their wealth, which to that moment was safe: but the doors were no sooner opened, and the air from without fanned the strong heat within, but <num value="1">first</num> the dryest and most combustible matters broke into a flame, which consumed all, of what kind soever that till then had been unhurt there. Yet they who had committed their goods to some lesser vaults, at a distance from that greater, had better fortune; and having learned from the <num value="2">second</num> ruin of their friends to have more patience, attended till the rain fell, and extinguished the fire in all places, and cooled the air; and then they securely opened the doors, and received all from thence that they had there. 
<P>If so vast a damage as <measure value="200000l." type=currency><num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> pounds</measure> befell that little company of Stationers in books and paper and the like, what shall we conceive was lost in cloth (of which the country clothiers lost all that they had brought up to Blackwell Hall against Michaelmas, which was all burned with that fair structure) in silks of all kinds, in linen, and those richer manufactures? Not to speak of money, plate, and jewels, whereof some were recovered out of the ruins of those houses which the owners took care to watch, as containing somewhat that was worth the looking for, and in which deluge there were men ready enough to fish. 
<P>The Lord Mayor (Sir Thomas Bludworth), though a very honest man, was much blamed for want of sagacity in the <num value="1">first</num> night of the fire, before the wind gave it much advancement: for, though he came with great diligence as soon as he had notice of it, and was present with the <num value="1">first</num>, yet having never been used to such spectacles, his consternation was equal to that of other men, nor did he know how to apply his authority to the remedying the present distress; and when men who were less terrified with the object pressed him very earnestly, &lsquo;that he would give order for the present pulling down those houses which were nearest, and by which the fire &lsquo;climbed to go farther&rsquo; (the doing whereof, at that time, might probably have prevented much of the mischief that succeeded), he thought it not safe counsel, and made no other answer, than &lsquo;that he durst not do it without &lsquo;the consent of the owners.&rsquo; His want of skill was the less wondered at, when it was known afterwards, that some gentlemen in the Inner Temple would not endeavour to preserve the goods which were in the lodgings of absent persons, nor suffer others to do it, &lsquo;because,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;it was against the law to break up any man's chamber.&rsquo; 
<P>The so sudden repair of those formidable ruins, and the giving so great beauty to all deformity (a beauty and a lustre that city had never before been acquainted with), is little less wonderful than the fire that consumed it.</QUOTE>
<P>Of this last great conflagration many pictures have been painted, representing it in various points of view, some of which have been engraved. That at Painter-stainers' Hall is drawn on the largest scale, and contains, perhaps, the most comprehensive view, as well as the best, showing the whole city, from the Thames, in the very height of the calamity; but it is wretchedly copied in Pennant's London, and scarcely affords an idea of the original. Gough, in his British Topography, says Mr. Granger saw in Berkshire a very excellent view of Lon don on fire, by Thomas Wyck, not yet engraved. And he himself met with a very good print in some book, which he did not recollect, entitled, &ldquo;The Picture of the most famous City of London, as it appeared in the Night, in the Height of its most ruinous Condition.&rdquo; To them may be added Hollar's View of the Fire, among the engravings in the Pepysian collection, and his View after the Fire, which affords a minute and perfect detail of the whole mass of buildings left or destroyed by that calamity; besides many lesser prints, all of which, most probably, form but a small part of the numerous representations which have been left of this remarkable event. 
<P>The accompanying Print, though it represents the Fire of London on a comparatively small scale, is not excelled by any engraving hitherto published, for correctness in the detail of the various buildings shown, and the point of view in which the picture has been taken. The Painting, whence it was copied, belonged to Mr. Lawrence, a publican in High Timber Street, Queenhithe, an ingenious and judicious collector of paintings, &amp;c. It is of a moderate size, and extremely well executed; and was evidently made from an actual inspection of the spot at that period.

<P>The city of London, as reported by Simeon of Durham, was <num value="1">first</num> inwalled by Helen, the mother of Constantine the Great, about the year of our Lord <num value="360">360</num>. The City having been destroyed and burnt by the Danes in <num value="839">839</num>, was repaired and restored by King Alfred, in <num value="886">886</num>. About the year <datestruct value="994"><year reg="994">994</year></datestruct>, the Londoners being besieged by the Danes, shut up their gates, and defended their King Ethelred within their walls. Fitzstephen, who wrote in the reign of King Henry the <num value="2">Second</num>, speaking of the Walls of the City, says: &ldquo;The Wall is high and great, well toured on the north side, with due distances between the toures; on the south side also the Citie was walled and toured, but the fishfull river of Thames, with his ebbing and flowing, hath long since subverted them.&rdquo; In the <num value="6">sixth</num> year of King John's reign, A.D. <datestruct value="1215"><year reg="1215">1215</year></datestruct>, the Barons repaired the walls and gates with stones taken from the Jews' houses; and in <datestruct value="1257--"><year reg="1257">1257</year></datestruct>, Henry the <num value="3">Third</num> caused the walls which were then decayed, to be again repaired. For the reparation of those walls, tolls and customs were at subsequent periods granted by the Crown. In <datestruct value="1477--"><year reg="1477">1477</year></datestruct>, Ralf Joselene, then Mayor, caused part of the Wall between Aldgate and Aldersgate to be repaired.<NOTE N="*"><P>&ldquo;In a record which I have seen,&rdquo; says Strype, &ldquo;and affirmed also by John Rouse, and after him by Ralph Hollingshed, I find thus written: &lsquo;Anno MCCCCLXXVII. by the diligence of Ralph Joceline, Maior of London, the wall about London was new made betwixt Aldgate and Cripplegate. He caused the Moorefields to be searched for clay and brick, to be made and burnt there. He caused chalk also to be brought out of Kent, and in the same Moorefields to be burnt into lime, only for the furtherance of that work.&rsquo;&rdquo;</NOTE> The Company of Skinners completed that part between Aldgate and Bevis Marks; the Drapers, between Bishopsgate and Allhallows, and the Wall towards the postern at Moorgate. A great part also was repaired by the executors of Alderman Sir John Crosby; and other companies repaired the rest of the Wall to the postern at Cripplegate; and the Goldsmiths from Cripplegate to Aldersgate. The circuit of the Wall on the land side, from the Tower of London east to Aldgate, was <num value="82">82</num> perches; from Aldgate to Bishopsgate, <num value="86">86</num> perches; from Bishopsgate to Cripplegate, <num value="162">162</num> perches; from Cripplegate to Aldersgate, <num value="75">75</num> perches; from Aldersgate to Newgate, <num value="66">66</num> perches; from Newgate to Ludgate, <num value="12">12</num> perches; in all <num value="513">513</num> perches: from Ludgate to the Fleet Ditch, <num value="60">60</num> perches; and from Fleet Bridge (south) to the river Thames, <num value="70">70</num> perches; making the total <num value="643">643</num> perches, every perch consisting of <num value="5">5</num> yards and a half, the number of yards being <num value="3536">3536</num> and a half, or <num value="10608">10,608</num> feet, or <num value="2">2</num> miles and <num value="608">608</num> feet in circuit. 
<P>The Wall was formerly continued, from the remains described on the Plate, through the Tower to the Thames; vestiges whereof are still to be discovered: and that part of the Tower which is on the west side of the line of the Wall, is in the parish of Allhallows Barking, in the City of London, and is referred to by Lord Coke in his Institutes, where he says: &ldquo;The ancient wall of London extendeth through the Tower; all that part on the west is within the city and parish of All Saints, Barking. Therefore, Weston, the principal, and Sir Gervas Elweys, the accessary in the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury, committed in the Tower, on the west of the City Wall, were tried in the City of London;&rdquo; and in <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>, <num value="1">one</num> Turnbull for a robbery of the Mint, situate on the west of the said Wall, was also tried in the City of London. 
<P>The late learned Dr. Woodward, <num value="1">one</num> of the Gresham professors, had an opportunity, in the year <datestruct value="1707"><year reg="1707">1707</year></datestruct>, of making several discoveries as to the manner and matter of building the ancient Walls of London, owing to the circumstance of certain foundations being dug for new houses near Bishopsgate; an account of which he afterwards published. On this occasion, the Wall was broke up, and part of the materials applied to the raising of the new buildings. The foundations of the Wall, on this spot, lay <num value="8">eight</num> feet below the present surface of the ground; and from that almost up to <num value="10">ten</num> feet in height, it was composed of free-stone, with single layers of broad tiles interposed, each layer at <num value="2">two</num> feet distance. To this height the workmanship was after the Roman manner, and there was the remains of the ancient Wall, supposed to be that completed or built by Constantine the Great. In this it was very observable, that the mortar was (as usual in the Roman works) so very firm and hard, that the stone itself as easily brake and gave way. 
<P>It was thus far from the foundation upwards, <num value="9">nine</num> feet in thickness, and yet so vast a strength and bulk had not been able to secure it from being beat down, and nearly levelled with the ground. 
<P>The broad tiles, mentioned above, were all of Roman make. The Romans used commonly <num value="2">two</num> sorts of tiles, viz. Tegul&aelig; bipedales &amp; sesquipedales, i.e. <num value="2">two</num> feet tiles and tiles a foot and a half. Those of this Wall were of the latter sort. Each of them was in English measures, <num value="1">one</num> foot and a half in thickness, <num value="11">eleven</num> inches <num value="6">6</num>/<num value="13">13</num> in breadth, and <num value="17">seventeen</num> inches <num value="4">4</num>/<num value="13">13</num> in length. 
<P>The old Wall having been demolished as above, was afterwards repaired again, and carried up the thickness of the former underneath, to <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="9">nine</num> feet in height, or if higher, there was no more of that work then standing. All this was apparently additional, and of a make later than the other part underneath. It was composed chiefly of ragstone; only in the sides were interposed a few bricks uncertainly, and without any regular method. On the outside the stone was squared, and wrought into layers of <num value="5">five</num> inches in thickness. Between these were alternately interposed <num value="2">two</num> courses of brick, of the same form with those inside. These were very large and of the modern shape, but <num value="11">eleven</num> inches in length and <num value="5">five</num> in breadth, and <num value="2">two</num> and a half in thickness. There was not <num value="1">one</num> of the abovemen- tioned tiles in all this part; nor was the mortar here near so hard as that lower down. 
<P>As the ground within the City, by rubbish and the ruin of houses, was successively raised and heightened from age to age, it was requisite the Wall without should rise likewise in proportion; and by reason thereof in course of time, upon the before-mentioned additional work, it was found needful to build the after Wall. This was made of brick, of the statutable size, and the model now in use, and topped battlement-ways, with copings of stone. This latter was <num value="2">two</num> feet in thickness, and <num value="6">six</num> in height; and was without doubt the same that was built in the mayoralty of Ralph Jocelyn. Bishopsgate itself was built <num value="2">two</num> years afterwards (<datestruct value="1479--"><year reg="1479">1479</year></datestruct>), in the way it appeared until pulled down. And the <pb id="p.8" n="8"> workmen employed then, as the same writer (Dr. Woodward) affirms, sunk considerably lower than the foundations of this gate, and by that means found out, that they lay not so deep as the old City Wall, by <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> feet. 
<P>The <num value="1">first</num> gate eastward through the City Wall, was that which adjoined the fragment we have delineated in the Plate, viz. the Postern Gate next the Tower. This, according to Stowe, fell down in <datestruct value="1440--"><year reg="1440">1440</year></datestruct>, and was never again built of stone, but its place supplied by a sort of humble lath and plaster erection, through which was an entry or passage. The former gate, he adds, from the remains of it standing in his time, appeared to have been a fair arched gate, partly built of Kentish stone, and of Caen stone from Normandy. The <num value="1">first</num> cause of this gate's going to ruin, he states, was the impolicy of William Longchamp, Bishop of Ely, Chancellor of England, in <datestruct value="1190--"><year reg="1190">1190</year></datestruct>, who caused a part of the City Wall, &ldquo;to wit, from the said gate <hi rend=italics>towards the river Thames to the White Tower</hi>, to be broken down for enlarging of the said Tower; which he then compassed far wide about with a wall, embattled, and which is now the outward wall of the Tower: this loosed and weakened the foundations of the gate, which <num value="200">200</num> years after fell down, as mentioned.&rdquo; To this account of Stowe, his editor Strype (<datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>) adds:&mdash;&ldquo;This postern gate is now all taken down, and in the room thereof a few posts are set to keep off carts and coaches; there being only a narrow passage left for foot passengers there.&mdash;This wall here was about <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num> feet in breadth, and cemented together with irregular pieces of stone like rock.&rdquo; 
<P>The following is his description of the exact piece of Wall here drawn:&mdash;&ldquo;There is a yard hard by called George Alley, built on each side with dwelling houses, and is a passage to Tower Hill, through the wall that was beat down since the <num value="1">first</num> Fire of London. This passage through the Wall, sometime since remained in the fashion of an arch, through which carts might pass; but now also the arch is demolished, and all that piece of Wall taken away. Here&rdquo; (northwards) &ldquo;<num value="1">one</num> may take a view of the inside of the breadth of <hi rend=italics>London Wall:</hi> it appears like a natural rock, with the stones so cemented into the work, that nothing but the greatest violence can separate them. On the west side, about <num value="14">fourteen</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet high, are seen several old Roman bricks put into the work, between the stones.&rdquo;

<P>DOWN to the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century the inhapitants of the City of London appear to have depended for a supply of water, upon the rivers, brooks, and wells, by which they were surrounded, in their natural state; without attempting to collect, preserve, or distribute, those streams by an artificial contrivance, or even to bring them nearer to the metropolis: the utmost improvement of them being probably only a square wall or basin of stone erected about the wells. With the increase of the population and buildings of London, however, the natural supplies of water were diminished; and the streams of the River of Flete, or Wells, the Old Bourne, and Wall-Brook, and the Lang Bourne, became deficient and decayed, by their courses being reduced or covered over in the erection of houses, the formation of streets, and other alterations which raised the ground. &ldquo;The citizens were, therefore,&rdquo; says Stow, &ldquo;forced to seek sweet waters abroad; whereof some&mdash;at the request of King Henry III. in the <num value="21">21st</num> year of his reign, <datestruct value="1236--"><year reg="1236">1236</year></datestruct>, were,&mdash;for the profit of the City and good of the whole realm, thither repairing; to wit, for the poor to drink, and for the rich to dress their meat,&mdash; granted to the citizens and their successors by <num value="1">one</num> Gilbert Sanford; with liberty to convey water from the town of Tyburn by pipes of lead into the City&rdquo;<NOTE N="a"><P>Stow's

<P>The situation of this aqueduct was about the centre of Cheapside, opposite Mercers Hall and Chapel; and in appearance it was a long and low stone building with battlements on the top, enclosing a large leaden cistern, the water of which issued from a cock into a square stone bason at the eastern end. At the upper end of Cheapside, the eastern end of that pile of buildings separating Pater-Noster-Row and Blow-bladder-street, or the present Newgate Street, was, previously to the Great Fire, terminated by the Church of St. Michael-le-Quern; to the east of which was erected another public reservoir, called &ldquo;the Little Conduit in West-Cheap by Paul's Gate.&rdquo; It was erected by order of William Eastfield, Lord Mayor, about <datestruct value="1441--"><year reg="1441">1441</year></datestruct>, the <num value="19">19th</num> year of Henry VI., in the place of an old cross, at the solicitation of several Common-Councils; the Corporation then granting <num value="1000">1,000</num> Marks, <num value="666">666</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="13">13</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>

The plan also exhibits the direction of the pipes laid for the supply of both the reservoirs in West-Cheap; the Little Conduit being probably also furnished from the same springs at Paddington. The tower at the north-west corner of this building was perhaps intended for raising the water to the height of its original level, whence it fell down again into the cistern in the larger building, and ran through the cocks fixed on <num value="3">three</num> sides of it. Round the base of the structure are represented several of the ancient London water-tankards; some particulars of which are given in the account of Lambe's Chapel and Conduit contained in this work, page <num value="6">6</num>, note b, which vessels contained about <num value="3">three</num> gallons. They appear to have been inserted in the present plan as an appropriate emblem, to express the purpose of the Conduit; as it will be observed that coin is drawn against some of the houses of the street of Old &lsquo;Change, to signify that the King's Exchange for the receipt of bullion to be coined, had been originally held there. In the large Plan of London, executed by Radulphus Aggas about <datestruct value="1562--"><year reg="1562">1562</year></datestruct>, the site of the Great Conduit in West-Cheap is also indicated only by the figures of <num value="2">two</num> tankards. 
<P>Both of the Conduits in West-Cheap were nearly destroyed in the Great Fire of London, as well as all the other City Aqueducts; which were never entirely restored again to their original state.<NOTE N="e"><P>In addition to the Great and Little Conduits in West-Cheap, the other public reservoirs of London consisted of the following. The Tun upon Cornhill, furnished with a cistern in <datestruct value="1401--"><year reg="1401">1401</year></datestruct>: the Standard in West-Cheap, supplied with water <datestruct value="1431--"><year reg="1431">1431</year></datestruct>: the Conduit in Aldermanbury, and the Standard in Fleet-Street, made and finished by the executors of Sir William Eastfield in <datestruct value="1471--"><year reg="1471">1471</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>:</hi> the Cisterns erected at the Standard in Fleet-Street, Fleet-Bridge, and without Cripplegate, in <datestruct value="1478--"><year reg="1478">1478</year></datestruct>: the Conduit in Grass-Street, made in <datestruct value="1491--"><year reg="1491">1491</year></datestruct>: the Conduit at Holborn Cross, erected about <datestruct value="1491--"><year reg="1491">1491</year></datestruct>, and rebuilt by William Lambe, in <datestruct value="1577--"><year reg="1577">1577</year></datestruct>, whence it was called Lambe's Conduit: the Little Conduit at the Stocks Market, built about <datestruct value="1500--"><year reg="1500">1500</year></datestruct>: the Conduit at Bishopsgate, about <datestruct value="1513--"><year reg="1513">1513</year></datestruct>: the Conduit at London Wall against Coleman-street, about <datestruct value="1528--"><year reg="1528">1528</year></datestruct>: the Conduit without Aldgate, supplied with water from Hackney, about <datestruct value="1535--"><year reg="1535">1535</year></datestruct>: the Conduit in Lothbury and Coleman-street, near the Church, about <datestruct value="1546--"><year reg="1546">1546</year></datestruct>: the Conduit of Thames water at Dowgate, in <datestruct value="1568--"><year reg="1568">1568</year></datestruct>.&mdash;&ldquo;Of the fore-mentioned conduits of fresh water that serve the City,&rdquo; adds Richard Blome, in reference to their state after the Great Fire, &ldquo;the greater part of them do still continue where <num value="1">first</num> erected; but some, by reason of the great quantity of ground they took up, standing in the midst of the City, were a great hindrance, not only to foot-passengers, but to porters, coaches, and cars; and were therefore thought fit to be taken down and to be removed to places more convenient and not of that resort of people: so that the water is still the same. The Conduits taken away and removed with their cisterns, are the Great Conduit at the east-end of Cheapside; the Great Conduit called the Tun in Cornhill; the Standard in Cheapside; the Little Conduit at the west end of Cheapside; the Conduit in Fleet-Street; the Great Conduit in Grass-Church-Street; the Conduit without Aldgate; the Conduit at Dowgate.&rdquo; In the account of Lambe's Conduit contained in this work, page <num value="7">7</num>, note b, will be found some notices concerning the final disuse of these aqueducts about <datestruct value="1701--"><year reg="1701">1701</year></datestruct>. The Conduit at the Stocks-Market after its re-erection, appears to have been celebrated principally for the fine statue placed over it by Sir Robert Viner, the whole of which was removed for the building of the present Mansion-House in <datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>. Whilst the Conduits of London continued to be kept up, their springs were occasionally visited by the Corporation. &ldquo;And particularly,&rdquo; says Stow, &ldquo;on the <datestruct VALUE="1562-09-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1562">1562</year></datestruct>, the Lord Mayor, Sir William Harper, the Aldermen, and many worshipful persons and divers of the Masters and Wardens of the <num value="12">Twelve</num> Companies, rid to the Conduit-heads for to see them, after the old custom. And afore dinner they hunted the hare, and killed her; and thence to dinner at the head of the Conduit. There was a good number entertained with good cheer by the Chamberlain; and after dinner they went to hunting the fox. There was a great cry for a mile; and at length the hounds killed him at the end of St. Giles's: Great hallowing at his death, and blowing of horns. And thence the Lord Mayor, with at his company, rode through London to his place in Lombard-Street.&rdquo; Strype's Stow's <hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, Vol. I. book i. chap. v. pp. <num value="24">24</num>, <num value="28">28</num>.</NOTE> &ldquo;As this street,&rdquo; says Strype, in his account of Cheapside in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, &ldquo;is yet esteemed the principal high street in the City, so it was formerly graced with a Great Conduit, a Standard, and a stately Cross; which last was pulled down in the Civil Wars.<NOTE N="f"><P>This destruction took place <datestruct VALUE="1643-05-2"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=2>2nd</day>, <year reg=1643>1643</year></datestruct>, and a particular account of it, together with a fac-simile engraving of a very rare contemporaneous print of the ceremony, will be found iu another part of the present work.</NOTE> In the last part, almost over against Mercers Chapel, stood a Great Conduit; but this Conduit standing almost in the middle of the street, being incommodious for coaches and carts, was thought fit by the magistracy, after the Great Fire, to be taken down and built no more.&rdquo;<NOTE N="g"><P>Strype's Stow's <hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, Vol. I. book iii. chap. iii. p. <num value="49">49</num>.</NOTE> The Little Conduit at the upper end of Cheapside, was partly re-erected or preserved: since the same authority, when stating that the Church of St. Michael-le-Quern was not rebuilt after it was consumed, the Parish being united to that of St. Vedast, Foster-Lane,&mdash;adds, that &ldquo;where that Church stood, against which is the passage into <pb id="p.10" n="10"> St. Paul's Churchyard, is a Conduit, not yet finished, but designed for some magnificent structure and statue; the place having a very fair prospect on Cheapside.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;This Church,&rdquo; says Strype, in another place, &ldquo;was burnt down in the Great Fire, and remains unbuilt and laid into the street: but the Conduit, which was at the east end of the Church still remains.&rdquo;<NOTE N="a"><P>Strype's Stow's <hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, Vol. I. book iii. chap. viii. pp. <num value="196">196</num>, <num value="191">191</num>.</NOTE> The following farther notice of this building appears in the <hi rend=italics>Magn&aelig; Britanni&aelig; Notitia, or the Present State of Britain</hi>, by John Chamberlayne, <num value="29">29th</num> Edition, London: <datestruct value="1728--"><year reg="1728">1728</year></datestruct>, <num value="8">8</num>vo. part <num value="1">1</num>, book iii, page <num value="251">251</num>. &ldquo;The Obelisk in Cheapside, is a piece of work designed and begun to be erected by the City, at the west end of Cheapside, where, before the Fire of London, stood the Church of St. Michael-le-Quern.

It may be seen in page <num value="4">4</num>, of the account of the Monument of London, contained in the present work, that the site of the Little Conduit in Cheapside, has been always a favourite situation for placing the Memorial of the Great Fire; and in the <hi rend=italics>Sloanian MSS.</hi> in the British Museum, No. <num value="5238">5238</num>, Article <num value="103">103</num>, Nos. <num value="69">69</num>, <num value="70">70</num>, there are yet extant <num value="2">two</num> original designs for the Cheapside Obelisk, which agree with the notices of it preserved by Strype and Chamberlayne.

The other drawing consists of an urn standing upon a circular base, surmounted by a figure of the City, holding a sword in the right hand, and resting the left upon an oval shield of the arms of London: the base is surrounded by an ornamental railing, and contains a door. 
<P>Of the Church of St. Michael-le-Quern, also represented in the annexed ancient Plan, it will be sufficient in this place to observe that it appears to have been originally erected about the reign of Edward III., and that the name was a corrupt translation of the Latin title of St. Michael <hi rend=italics>ad Bladum</hi>, or at the Corn; because the site was <num value="1">one</num> occupied by a Corn-Market, stretching up to the western shambles of Newgate-Market.<NOTE N="b"><P>The word <hi rend=italics>Quern</hi> is an ancient provincial term for a corn-mill; derived from the Saxon <hi rend=italics>Cveorn</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>Cvyrn</hi>, the Icelandic <hi rend=italics>Kuerna</hi>, and the Gothic <hi rend=italics>Cwairn.</hi></NOTE> At the eastern end of the original Church was a Cross, called &ldquo;the Old Cross in West- Cheap,&rdquo; which was removed in <datestruct value="1390--"><year reg="1390">1390</year></datestruct>, the <num value="13">13th</num> year of Richard II., and the Church itself was taken down and rebuilt in <datestruct value="1430--"><year reg="1430">1430</year></datestruct>, the <num value="8">8th</num> year of the reign of Henry VI.

<P>Beside the <num value="2">two</num> Conduits in West-Cheap, there was also a <num value="3">third</num> public reservoir in the same street called the Standard: the site of which was in the centre of the road nearly opposite the end of Honey-Lane, as it is indicated in the Plan of Cheapside inserted in this work, to shew the situation of Cheapside-Cross, above the ancient representation of its destruction. The original use of the Standard appears to have been a monument erected at the place for public executions; of which Stow gives several instances between <datestruct value="1293--"><year reg="1293">1293</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1461--"><year reg="1461">1461</year></datestruct>.<NOTE N="d"><P><hi rend=italics>Ibid.</hi>

But whatever were the more ancient Standard, it was certainly a fixed erection in <datestruct value="1430--"><year reg="1430">1430</year></datestruct>, when John Wells, Lord Mayor, caused it to be furnished &ldquo;with a small cistern of fresh water, having <num value="1">one</num> small cock continually running; when the same was not turned or locked.&rdquo; His design was finished by his executors, Thomas Knowles, John Chicheley, and others, who bought a license of Henry VI. to convey water to it. It appears almost unquestionable that the Standard of that period was of wood: since the King's Patent for the work issued in <datestruct value="1442--"><year reg="1442">1442</year></datestruct>, the <num value="21">21st</num> year of his reign, states that the Standard in Cheap, where divers executions of the law had been aforetime performed, was at that present very ruinous with age: that it contained a conduit; that it should be taken down; and that another competent <hi rend=italics>Standard of Stone</hi>, together with a Conduit in the same, of new work, should be strongly builded for the honour of the City, with the goods of the testator without interruption. The appearance of this Standard in the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, is shewn in another Plate of this work representing the procession of Maria De&rsquo; Medicis, through Cheapside, when she came to visit her daughter Henrietta-Maria Queen of Charles I., in <datestruct value="1638--"><year reg="1638">1638</year></datestruct>. It is impossible that the figures with which the Standard is decorated, especially that on the dome, were erected for the occasion; since the Cross and Conduits of West-Cheap were always anciently employed as stations for pageants in the triumphs, shows, and royal processions, of the City.<NOTE N="e"><P>Numerous instances of these pageants, with references to the original authorities, will be found in Mr. Nichols' <hi rend=italics>Account of <num value="55">Fifty-five</num> Royal Processions and Entertainments in the City of London.</hi> Lond. <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>. <num value="8">8</num>vo. The roofs of the Conduits, which were generally either castellated or enclosed by an ornamental gallery, like that appearing in the annexed representation of the Little Conduit in West-Cheap,&mdash;were usually filled with choristers or minstrels in a tower.</NOTE> Upon such occasions also the City Conduits alternately ran with wine for a certain space of time; the vessels containing it being placed over the water-cisterns, and a small pipe brought down from them and passed through the usual spout, from which issued a very slender stream. 
<P>The use of Cheapside-Cross a Water Conduit, has been already mentioned in the account of that erection contained in the present work; and the remainder of this article is therefore devoted to some notices and illustrations of the <num value="2">two</num> other Plates, annexed, exhibiting the buildings and appearance of Bishopsgate and Cornhill, in the year <datestruct value="1599"><year reg="1599">1599</year></datestruct>.

The Standard in Cornhill, however, continued to exist until the Great Fire of London in an imperfect state; being at some times dry and at others overflowing; for which last condition it was frequently presented as a nuisance by the Inquest of Cornhill Ward, under the names of &ldquo;the Carrefour&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Foure Spowts.&rdquo; 
<P>It appears from <num value="1">one</num> of the accounts of the Conflagration in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, that none of the City Conduits were entirely destroyed by it;<NOTE N="d"><P>&ldquo;Methinks these several Conduits of London stood like so many little, bnt strong, forts, to confront and give check to the grea tenemy, fire; as any occasion should be. There methinks, the water was, as it were, intrenched and ingarrisoned. The several pipes, and vehicles of water, that were within these Conduits, all of them charged with water, till, by the turning of the cock, they were discharged again,&mdash;were as so many soldiers in these forts, with their musquetry charged, ready to keep and defend these places. And look how enemies are wont to deal with those castles which they take to be impregnable and despair of ever getting at them, that is to attempt the storming of them by a close siege;&mdash;so went the fire to work with those little castles of stone, which it were not easy for it to burn down, (<hi rend=italics>witness their standing to this day</hi>): spoiled them, or almost spoiled them, it hath for the present, by cutting off those supplies of water which had vent to flow to them, melting those leaden channels in which it had been conveyed, and, thereby, as it were, starving those garrisons which it could not take by storm.&rdquo; Dr. Samuel Rolle's <hi rend=italics>Relation of the late dreadful Fire of London in the Year</hi> <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, <hi rend=italics>Commemorated and Improved in <num value="110">One Hundred and Ten</num> Discourses, Meditations, and Contemplations.</hi> Lond. <datestruct value="1667--"><year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>. <num value="8">8</num>vo.

and, therefore, as this fountain stood on the very verge of the north-eastern extremity of the destruction, it was only damaged at the same time that the opposite Church of St. Peter upon Cornhill was not quite burned down. This was probably on Monday, <datestruct VALUE="-09-3"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=3>3rd</day></datestruct>, when the fire spread up Grace-Church Street, broke in upon Cornhill, and there rapidly crossed the way; being fearfully aided by a train of wood taken down from the houses to prevent the flames spreading, and which had not been removed.<NOTE N="e"><P><hi rend=italics>God's Terrible Advice to the City by Plague and Fire</hi>, by the Rev.

<P>The Water-works which supplied this Standard remained established at the Old London Bridge for about a century and a half afterwards; and a lofty building for the same purpose as that in Cornhill, appears to have been erected on the bank of the river close to the north-west corner of the Bridge itself so early as the reign of Elizabeth. With various improvements the property continued in the family of Moris until the time of the Great Fire; and <num value="1">one</num> of the controverted causes afterwards decided concerning possessions therein destroyed, was upon the re-erection of those works: which shews that a considerable profit was then derived from them. The cause was heard at &ldquo;a Court of Judicature for Determination of Differences touching houses burned or demolished, by reason of the late Fire happening in London; held in Clifford's Inn Hall, on Saturday, the <datestruct VALUE="1667-04-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>:&rdquo; Sir Matthew Hale, Mr. Justice Archer, Mr. Baron Raynsford, and Mr. Justice Morton, being the Judges. To this Court a petition was presented by Mary Moris, Relict of John Moris, against Thomas Moris, his brother and heir, Lettice Moris, Widow, and Elizabeth, Ursula, Thomasine, Anne, and Lettice, Moris, her daughters; and against Sir Martin Lister, Sir William Hartop, Michael Lister, and Richard Downton, the surviving trustees of John Moris. The petition stated that Peter Moris, the grandfather of the deceased, had received a lease for <num value="500">500</num> years, with a license from the Corporation of London under the common-seal to build <num value="1">one</num> engine or water-work in the river Thames, and to take such plot and ground in the said River as he and they should think convenient: that he had selected a place at London Bridge, and had there constructed such works as supplied the Cornhill Conduit, and by means of wooden and leaden pipes the houses of the Citizens, to their comfort and his own particular gain: that this property had in the course of time very much enriched the descendants and heirs of the said Peter Moris; insomuch that, with others of the family, the petitioner enjoyed the sum of <num value="300">300</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> per annum, by way of jointure, regularly paid to her out of the profits of the water-works, by appointed trustees,&mdash;until the time that the engine was destroyed by fire: and that Thomas Moris, the brother and heir of the deceased, refused to build the same, under pretence of the heavy charges to which it would put him; though rather, as it was believed, with a view to induce the petitioner to be satisfied with a reduction of her annuity; nor would he even give permission to the trustees to re-erect it. The petition was therefore brought to enforce some settlement as to the payment of the annuity; and the Court accordingly decreed that the petitioner should, with all convenient speed and with substantial materials, rebuild the same; where the former engine, and water-work, and house, did stand before <pb id="p.12" n="12"> the Fire: and that Thomas Moris should, upon demand, deliver to the petitioner all the materials which were, by him or his direction, taken therefrom, and saved from the Fire. This decision secured the annuity to the petitioner, and the sum of <num value="200">200</num><hi rend=italics>l</hi> yearly to Lettice Moris, and to each of her <num value="5">five</num> daughters; Thomas Moris receiving the residuary produce.&mdash;The year <datestruct value="1701"><year reg="1701">1701</year></datestruct>, however, may be considered as the period when these Water-works made the greatest advance towards their subsequent extent and power.

It spread in <num value="3">three</num> different directions, communicating chiefly by the tops of the houses over the party-walls; and thus consumed almost all the buildings in the Alley itself, Birchin Lane, and thence along the stately line of houses in Cornhill, about <num value="20">twenty</num> in number, to George Yard and St. Michael's Alley : including several eminent Coffee-houses and Taverns, <num value="5">five</num> booksellers, and many other valuable shops; though there were <num value="50">fifty</num> engines at the fire, and a good supply of water. By the care and activity of the Lord Mayor and several other Magistrates who were present, the diligence and dexterity of the firemen and officers, and the assistance of the foot-guards from the Tower and St. James's,&mdash;the greater part of the most valuable effects of the sufferers was preserved: and the wind also being south-south-west, the houses of the bankers in Lombard Street were saved, and the only public office destroyed was that of the London Assurance; from which, however, there was time sufficient to remove the goods. The houses burned down were at <num value="1">first</num> estimated at <num value="160">160</num>, but were subsequently found to be only about <num value="80">80</num>; the principal being Garraway's, the Jerusalem, and Jonathan's, Coffee-houses; the residence of Mr. Young, a woollen-draper, and the whole of &lsquo;Change Alley, excepting Baker's and Sams's Coffee houses, which were greatly damaged. In Cornhill were destroyed the shops and dwellings of Messrs. Astley, Meadows, Strahan, Walthoe and Brotherton, booksellers; Deputy Cleve, pewterer; Warner, stationer ; Tom's and the Rainbow Coffee-houses; the Fleece and the <num value="3">Three</num> Tuns Taverns, with a milliner's next door to the latter; a cabinet-maker's, and Legg's a woollen draper's, at the <num value="2">two</num> corners of Birchin Lane; those of a shoemaker and woollen-draper adjoining; the Widow Harrison; Mr. Vaughan, haberdasher; and Mrs. Sarrazin, at the corner of St. Michael's Alley. In St. Michael's Alley itself, were burned Knight's shoe-warehouse; the Cock and Lion Public-house; and the houses of Guyther, a peruke maker, and Olde's a saddler: the Jamaica Coffee-House, and St. Michael's Church were only slightly damaged. In Castle Court, and White Lion Court, Birchin Lane, all the buildings were consumed; the back part of the George and Vulture Tavern, Helford's Coffee house, and the dwelling of Willmore, a hosier, in George Yard, with considerable damage to others in the same place. Cole's, the Pensylvania, the Marine, the Sword-blade, and the Carolina and Georgia Coffee houses, the houses of Shaw, a shoemaker, Wilson, a stationer, and all the others in Birchin Lane, excepting only <num value="8">eight</num> towards Lombard Street.&mdash;Mr. Eldridge, his wife, and <num value="2">two</num> daughters, perished in the flames, his <num value="2">two</num> apprentices and maid-servant only escaping; whilst Mr. Cooke, a merchant, who lodged in the house, broke his back in leaping from the <num value="2">second</num> story window, and died soon after.&mdash;A public subscription was opened for the sufferers by this fire, for which by <datestruct VALUE="-04-11"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=11>11th</day></datestruct>, <num value="3320">3320</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> had been collected; the claims for relief, however, then amounted to <num value="8000">8000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> and the subscription was continued.

<P>This terrific Fire <num value="1">first</num> broke out soon after <num value="3">three</num> o'clock in the morning of Thursday, <datestruct VALUE="1765-11-7"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=7>7th</day>, <year reg=1765>1765</year></datestruct>, at the house of William Rutland, Peruke-maker, marked A on the Plan, situate the <num value="2">second</num> building on the east side of Bishopsgate Street Within, opposite the White Lion Tavern. At this time the wind was high in the south-west, and the flames soon spread across the way, and set fire to the residence of Mrs. Thomson, a milliner; and as it was some time before assistance could be procured, they extended to the corner house kept by Burkuit Fenn, a hosier, whence the other <num value="3">three</num> angles of Cornhill, Grace Church Street, and Leadenhall Street, soon caught the blaze, and were all on fire at the same time. The New River turncock had been summoned immediately on the <num value="1">first</num> alarm, but after having turned off the water in Leadenhall Street, in order to make it flow higher in Cornhill, the <num value="2">two</num> streets being then supplied by <num value="1">one</num> main,&mdash;he found that the pipes in Cornhill had been already cut open by the crowd, and that none would rise at the plug where it would have been most serviceable.<NOTE N="c"><P><hi rend=italics>Lloyd's Evening Post</hi>, Mond. <datestruct VALUE="-11-11"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=11>11th</day></datestruct>, to Wednesd. <num value="13">13th</num>, p. <num value="470">470</num>.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Public Ledger</hi>, Saturd. <datestruct VALUE="-11-16"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=16>16th</day></datestruct>.</NOTE> There was also some delay in the arrival of the office fire engines; the want of which was at <num value="1">first</num> supplied by a large <num value="1">one</num> belonging to Mr. Ephraim Brookes, of Long-Acre, which had been sent to Grocers' Hall in the Poultry, until he completed <num value="2">two</num> for the Company. This was <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest at the spot, and was ordered thither by the Lord Mayor, who sent his own horses to fetch it, immediately on being informed of the fire. It is represented in the papers of the time as having been greatly instrumental in checking the progress of the flames: which is corroborated by a subsequent public advertisement of thanks from the inhabitants of the neighbourhood.<NOTE N="d"><P><hi rend=italics>Lloyd's Evening Post</hi>, Wednesd. <datestruct VALUE="-11-6"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=6>6th</day></datestruct> to <num value="8">8th</num>, p. <num value="455">455</num>. <hi rend=italics>Gazetteer</hi>, Frid. <datestruct VALUE="-11-13"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=13>13th</day></datestruct>.</NOTE>

<P>The fire, however, continued still to spread in the most alarming manner. It soon reached the Church of St. Martin Outwich, at the corner of Threadneedle Street, the interior, and much of the walls of which it destroyed; and wholly consumed the steeple, whence the great bell fell down with a prodigious noise. The south and east sides of Merchant-Taylors' Hall also caught fire, and the whole building was saved with great difficulty; but about <num value="7">seven</num> in the morning, the wind shifted to the west, and drove the flames back from the part where they were then raging, otherwise the whole of Great St. Helen's must have been destroyed, and their course was changed to the north side of Leadenhall Street, in which upwards of <num value="20">twenty</num> houses were consumed. At <num value="9">nine</num> o'clock several parties of guards arrived from the Tower, and soon after Sir William Stephenson, the Lord Mayor, who gave orders for lodging such goods as could be saved in the Royal Exchange, and was otherwise particularly active in affording assistance. From the advertisements of the several sufferers and others, which were published immediately after the fire, it appears that much energetic aid was given to them all, and that many of their goods were saved; but the loss was still immense, and, from the rapidity of the flames, numbers escaped with little more than their lives. The accidents, both at the fire itself and subsequently in the ruins, were very melancholy and numerous, but several of those at <num value="1">first</num> related in the newspapers of the time <pb id="p.14" n="14"> were afterwards contradicted;<NOTE N="a"><P>The most fatal and remarkable of these accidents was the following, related in the <hi rend=italics>London Chronicle</hi> from Saturday <datestruct VALUE="-12-7"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=7>7th</day></datestruct> to Tuesday <num value="10">10th</num>, p. <num value="556">556</num>. About a quarter past <num value="3">three</num> o'clock, on Monday afternoon, (<num value="9">9th</num>,) a number of labourers employed by Mr. Wicks, a bricklayer, to clear away the rubbish from the ruins, were standing on the Western side of Bishopsgate Street, in a cellar at the spot whereon the house of Mr. John Burdon, tobacconist, formerly stood; when a large stack of chimneys behind suddenly fell down upon them. Not only almost all the labourers were killed, but as many of the bricks fell quite across the street, several persons passing by were severely wounded. <num value="8">Eight</num> bodies were carried into the Church of Peter upon Cornhill, including those of a female and Robert Clarkson, foreman to Mr. Burden, who attended the labourers to receive any of his employer's goods which might be found in the ruins. <num value="3">Three</num> other persons were carried to the hospital with broken limbs, and a passenger was taken back to his home in a similar state. During the removal of the bodies St. Peter's church-yard was crowded to excess, and many robberies were committed there. The compassion excited by this accident, was scarcely less than that occasioned by the fire itself: a liberal portion of the Lord Mayor's donation to the sufferers at the former, was ordered to be given to the widows and families of the persons killed in the ruins; and the money paid to the Jurors of Aldersgate and Cornhill Wards, for their sittings after Michaelmas term in the Court of King's Bench, Guildhall, amounting to <num value="26">26</num><hi rend=italics>l</hi> <num value="16">16</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> was also unanimously presented. <hi rend=italics>Lloyd's Evening Post</hi>, Mond. <datestruct VALUE="-12-9"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=9>9th</day></datestruct> to <num value="11">11th</num>, p. <num value="566">566</num>, and <datestruct VALUE="-12-11"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=11>11th</day></datestruct> to <num value="13">13th</num>, p. <num value="574">574</num>. On <datestruct VALUE="-12-10"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=10>10th</day></datestruct> the Court of Aldermen ordered the remaining stacks of chimneys in the ruins to be surveyed, when they were reported dangerous, and the day following they were all removed. <hi rend=italics>Ibid.&mdash;Public Ledger</hi>, Frid. <datestruct VALUE="-12-13"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=13>13th</day></datestruct>.</NOTE> and notwithstanding the many reports of loss of life during the conflagration, they generally were believed to be all uutrue. The fire continued to rage with fury until after <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock at noon on Thursday, but was at length stopped in Bishopsgate Street, at the house of Mr. Nesbit, a merchant, and at the Rectory, nearly opposite; at Sun Court in Cornhill; at the old edifice of Leaden-Hall; and at the eastern side of the Black Bull Inn, Leadenhall Street. In the <num value="1">first</num> alarm it was computed that about an <num value="100">hundred</num> houses were consumed, which, however, afterwards proved to be <num value="51">fifty-one</num>, or under; though the claim on the Sun Fire Office alone amounted to <measure value="40000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="40000">40,000</num></measure>.

<P>The original cause of this conflagration was of course variously stated. It was asserted by some that the workshop of Marjerum, the tinman, on the east side of Bishopsgate Street, was immediately under the house of Rutland where the flames broke out; and that the workmen in the former sat up very late on the night of the fire, having an order to complete which required great expedition, during which time a boy going to a jar for a supply of oil for their lamps let the snuff of a candle fall into it.<NOTE N="c"><P><hi rend=italics>Annual Register</hi>, <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, Vol. viii. p. <num value="144">144</num>, (Chronicle).</NOTE> From the remarkable coincidence, however, that the fire in Cornhill of <datestruct value="1748--"><year reg="1748">1748</year></datestruct> and the present, both began at a peruke-maker's, the most general report attributed its commencement to Rutland's own house; where it was affirmed the boy was sitting <emph>up</emph> late to let in a lodger, and falling asleep, the light caught some of the wig-boxes and rapidly spread from the combustible nature of the surrounding articles. This very general belief occasioned some strong remarks in the public prints on the danger of permitting hair-dressers to have their apprentices sleep in their shops, and it especially appears to have excited so hostile a feeling against Rutland himself, that the <hi rend=italics>Public Ledger</hi> of Friday, <datestruct VALUE="-11-15"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=15>15th</day></datestruct>, contains his declaration of the mischief done to him by the report, and his entire ignorance of the place or manner in which the fire began.<NOTE N="d"><P>In 
<hi rend=italics>Lloyd's Evening Post</hi> of <datestruct VALUE="-11-15"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=15>15th</day></datestruct> to <num value="18">18th</num>, p. <num value="486">486</num>, it is recommended that it should be made penal for hair-dressers to lodge their servants in their shops which have proved so combustible. The <hi rend=italics>Public Ledger</hi>, of Friday, <datestruct VALUE="-11-15"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=15>15th</day></datestruct>, contains the following declaration. &ldquo;William Rutland, Peruke-maker and Hair-dresser, burned out from Bishopsgate Street, is removed into Finch Lane, the <num value="1">first</num> door from Cornhill on the left hand; where he most humbly entreats the favours of his friends and customers. Whereas some evil-minded persons have currently and maliciously spread a report that I set fire to my house in Bishopsgate Street, giving out that I was not at home that night; the reason of which mistake, I suppose, might arise from the manner of my escape, and their not knowing that I had no part of the house in front over my shop. And as such a report has already so far prevailed as to hurt me in my character, and injure me in my business, it is therefore at the request of some of my fellowsufferers in the late dreadful fire, who have willingly subscribed their names, that, if called upon, they are ready to make an answer in my defence against such an aspersion. I therefore take this opportunity to inform the public that I am ready to make oath, before <num value="1">one</num> or more magistrates, that I am totally ignorant, either in the whole, or in part, how, where, or after what manner, this unhappy accident began; for myself and wife made our escape out of a <num value="1">one</num> pair of stairs window; my <num value="2">two</num> &lsquo;prentices, maidservant, and <num value="2">two</num> lodgers, made their escape over the tops of the houses; and all of us very narrowly escaped with our lives, but with the loss of my accompt-books. It is therefore hoped that this advertisement will be a sufficient satisfaction to all my customers and the public in general, that me and mine are in no ways concerned in so wicked and base an action, utterly abhorred and detested by us all. William Rutland. John Grantham, C. Thomson, John Merry, William Cannon.&rdquo;</NOTE>

The Exhibitor takes the liberty to conclude the Lecture of this evening with an address to his audience on the occasion of this their meeting. How amiable must that assembly appear, which is formed for the relief of distress! It adds dignity to titles, and loveliness to beauty. The gate of wealth is too often barred against necessity; and whilst the rich are crowded with proffered services, who extends compassion's arm to the wretched? Behold here glorious examples! By such liberalities the so-lately-undone sufferers will, from the ruins of that dreadful conflagration, re-assume domestic happiness. What inexpressible satisfaction must they feel who bestow such felicity on their fellow-creatures? Even your enemies, when in captivity, were supported by your generosities! But it is not throughout Europe only that misfortune addresses you with supplications: from Canada affliction has implored your assistance. Thus we find that compassion and valour are twin-virtues; and the world acknowledges that the <hi rend=italics>Courage of the English</hi> can be equalled only by <hi rend=italics>English Humanity.</hi>&rdquo; The price of admission to this very popular Lecture was <num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi>; and in <hi rend=italics>Lloyd's Evening Post</hi> of Frid. <datestruct VALUE="-11-15"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=15>15th</day></datestruct> to <num value="18">18th</num>, p. <num value="486">486</num>, it is stated that on Saturday Mr. Stephens paid <num value="15">15</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> into Sir George Amyand's as the produce of this benefit</NOTE> The most munificent donation, however, came from the Sovereign, the particulars of which are related in the same paper, page <num value="471">471</num>.

After the fire of <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct> Sir Robert mentioned this act of royal benevolence to some of his friends, and the circumstances fortunately reached the Most Hon. the Marquis of Rockingham, who immediately acquainted his Majesty with it, in consequence of which Alderman Ladbroke and the late Lord Mayor received a message from the Minister requesting an interview. They attended him accordingly, and the former being asked to whom it would be proper to pay a donation for the benefit of the sufferers by the week's fire, answered to Sir William Stephenson, as it <pb id="p.16" n="16"> happened during his Mayoralty.

of Tuesday, <datestruct VALUE="-11-12"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=12>12th</day></datestruct>, that yesterday <num value="3">three</num> men were taken alive out of the ruins of the White Lion Tavern in Bishopsgate Street. They went down to secure them when the house <num value="1">first</num> took fire on Thursday morning, and soon after the building fell in upon them.&rdquo; The day following some gentlemen informed the Lord Mayor that there was reason for suspecting that others lay beneath the ruins; on which he sent Cook, the City-Marshal, with them, to prevent strangers approaching the place, and to direct the workmen to make the strictest search around the supposed spot: but after unceasing digging there from about noon until <num value="10">ten</num> at night, there appeared no cause for their suspicion. Other persons, however, still remained doubtful, and again applied to the Lord Mayor on the subject, stating that they believed they could even hear sounds and knocking under the ruins; on which he again sent the City-Marshal to order a farther search, which has continued in his presence during the whole night in vain. To give complete public satisfaction a reward of <num value="100">100</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> was then offered to any person who should discover any human being alive under the ruins.<NOTE N="a"><P><hi rend=italics>Gazetteer</hi>, Friday, <datestruct VALUE="-11-15"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=15>15th</day></datestruct>.</NOTE> The <hi rend=italics>Public Ledger</hi> of <datestruct VALUE="-11-15"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=15>15th</day></datestruct>, page <datestruct value="1096--"><year reg="1096">1096</year></datestruct>, nevertheless contains an extraordinary narrative, that &ldquo;yesterday afternoon as a person was standing upon the ruins where the White Lion Tavern stood, he heard a noise beneath him which he imagined might proceed from some persons in the vaults lately belonging to the said tavern; and immediately several people were employed to clear away the rubbish: when to their great surprise there were dug out <num value="2">two</num> men and a woman, a dog, and <num value="2">two</num> cats, alive.

<P>The deficiency of water at the commencement of this fire, and the fearful rapidity with which the flames spread, were the cause of several schemes being projected for the better supply and protection of London upon such occasions, and of some prudent regulations being adopted and published. The principal of the former was a proposal by Mr. Thomas Long, a merchant, who addressed a memorial to the Corporation, for the remainder of the then existing lease of <num value="17">seventeen</num> years and a half, of the unoccupied ground call Upper and Middle Mutton Fields, or more commonly Upper and Middle Moorfields, belonging to the City, for the erection of houses, and a reservoir of water to supply London in case of fire. The Rev. Christopher Wilson, D.D., Prebend of Finsbury, had already agreed to grant a lease to Mr. Long; but his memorial was rejected by the Court of Common Council on Wednesday, <datestruct VALUE="-12-18"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=18>18th</day></datestruct>, the same day that it was presented.<NOTE N="d"><P><hi rend=italics>Lloyd's Evening Post</hi>, <datestruct VALUE="-12-18"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=18>18th</day></datestruct> to <num value="20">20th</num>.</NOTE> Another design was that proposed by Mr. Yoeman for improving the distribution of the waters of the River Lea, so as to require only a <num value="15">fifteenth</num> part of the quantity then used for its navigation and mills, leaving the remainder to be employed for other purposes or retained in a reservoir.<NOTE N="e"><P><hi rend=italics>Annual Register</hi>, <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, Vol. viii. p. <num value="145">145</num> (Chronicle). Mr. Yoeman also proposed that, as there were always at every fire more engines than can be used, such as could not find room to work should be disposed in a line to the nearest place where water could be prepared in plenty. The deficiency of water in London is in this article attributed to the very great increase of buildings in the suburbs; but the <hi rend=italics>Gazetteer</hi> of <datestruct VALUE="-12-21"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=21>21st</day></datestruct> states, that &ldquo;the cellars of a considerable number of houses in Broad Street, London Wall, and the parts adjacent, have been lately overflowed with water from the leaden pipes running to waste belonging to the houses burned down in Bishopsgate Street.&rdquo; Beside the schemes above mentioned, the <hi rend=italics>Public Ledger</hi> of <datestruct VALUE="-11-8"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=8>8th</day></datestruct> contains a hint for preventing coals and timber from rekinding after a fire, by forming channels into them from the bason of the fire-plug: and in the <hi rend=italics>Gazetteer</hi> of <datestruct VALUE="-12-4"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=4>4th</day></datestruct> a plan is mentioned by Dr. Hales for restraining fires where water cannot be immediately procured, by digging up gravel, sand, or earth, or the dirt and rubbish of the streets, and throwing it <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> inches deep over the floors and staircases of the houses: upon the fire arriving at this covering it will be almost smothered by the density of the mass.&mdash;Directly after the fire in Bishopsgate Street, &ldquo;the Parish-Officers of St. Paul, Covent-Garden, distributed to every housekeeper, and affixed in most public places, a list of the names and residences of the several turncocks belonging to the respective water-companies which served the parish; that in case of accident by fire recourse might be had to them immediately;&rdquo; subjoined to which was an abstract of the Act <num value="7">7th</num> Anne, <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, for preventing fires by carelessness of servants. <hi rend=italics>Lloyd's Evening Post</hi>, <datestruct VALUE="-12-8"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=8>8th</day></datestruct> to <num value="11">11th</num>.

Efford, stating that since the preceding Christmas <num value="300">300</num> houses had been burned in London, partly from the deficient supply of water; when perhaps an <num value="8">eight</num> part of their value, or about <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> would have paid for bringing a branch of the river Coln to the City to a reservoir. It is added, that about <num value="3">three</num> years previous, a scheme was proposed to erect such a reservoir in Upper Moorfields. A design for a similar reservoir, to be built on Upper Windmill-hill, Moorfields, high enough to throw the water up to the highest street in London, is brought forward in the <hi rend=italics>Public Advertiser</hi> of Saturday, <datestruct VALUE="-11-16"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=16>16th</day></datestruct>. 
<P>As the great cross formed by the <num value="4">four</num> streets where this fire took place, was in the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> and <num value="16">sixteenth</num> centuries distinguished by a stone conduit standing in the centre, so it was proposed in the same paper for Thursday, <datestruct VALUE="-11-21"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=21>21st</day></datestruct>, that a grand pillar should be erected on the same spot, as a columna milliaria or standard for measuring distances out from London.

<P>THE custom of engaging in various sports upon the Ice, is certainly of great antiquity in England. It is mentioned as an ordinary winter-amusement of the youth of London in the <num value="12">twelfth</num> century by William Fitz-Stephen,<NOTE N="a"><P>&ldquo;When that vast lake, which waters the City towards the north, is hard frozen, the youth in great numbers go to divert themselves on the ice. Some taking a small run for an increment of velocity, place their feet at the proper distance and are carried sliding sideways a great way: others will make a large cake of ice, and seating <num value="1">one</num> of their companions upon it, they take hold of each other's hands and draw him along; when it sometimes happens that, moving so swiftly on so slippery a plain, they all fall headlong. Others there are who are still more expert in these amusements on the ice: they place certain bones, the leg-bones of some animal, under the soles of their feet, by tying them round their ankles, and then taking a staff shod with iron into their hands, they push themselves forward by striking it against the ice, and are carried along with a velocity equal to the flight of a bird, or a bolt discharged from a cross-bow. Sometimes <num value="2">two</num> of them thus furnished, agree to start opposite <num value="1">one</num> to another at a great distance: they meet, elevate their poles, attack and strike each other, when <num value="1">one</num> or both of them fall and not without some bodily hurt; and even after their fall they will be carried a good distance from each other by the rapidity of the motion; and whatever part of your head comes upon the ice is sure to be laid bare to the skull. Very often the leg or arm is broken of the party that falls if he chance to light upon them.&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Fitz-Stephen's Description of the City of London;</hi> Translated with a Commentary, &amp;c. by the Rev.

But though there be numerous particulars extant of almost all the Great Frosts which anciently congealed the River Thames so as to render it a solid passage, the more remote notices do not appear to allude to any fair or festivity held upon it; and though there have been several such at later periods, the present account is devoted to that remarkable Frost represented in the annexed Engraving, in the reign of King Charles the <num value="2">Second</num>.

A very violent frost began which lasted till the <datestruct VALUE="-02-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, in soe great extremity that the pooles were frozen <num value="18">18</num> inches thick at the least; and the Thames was so frozen that a great street from the Temple to Southwark was built with shops, and all manner of things sold: here coaches plyed as in the streets. There were also shews, bull-baiting, and a great many other shews and tricks to be seen.&mdash;This day the frost broke: in the morning I saw a coach and <num value="6">six</num> horses driven from Whitehall almost to the Bridge; yet by <num value="3">3</num> o'clock that day next to Southwark the ice was gone, so as boats did now row to and fro, and the day after all the frost was gone. On Candlemas-day, <datestruct VALUE="-02-2"><month reg="02">Febr.</month> <day reg=2>2nd</day></datestruct>, I went to Croyden market, and led my horse over the ice at the ferry at Lambeth; as I came back I led him from Lambeth upon the middle of the Thames to Whitefriars-stairs, and soe led him up them; and this day an Ox was roasted whole over against Whitehall King Charles II. with the Queene eate part of it.&rdquo;</NOTE> it is stated that in <datestruct VALUE="1683-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1683">1683</year></datestruct>, began &ldquo;<num value="1">one</num> of the severest frosts in England that had happen'd of many years;&rdquo; and that by the <num value="23">23rd</num> of the month the Thames was frozen.

On <datestruct VALUE="-01-23"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=23>23rd</day></datestruct>, the <num value="1">first</num> day of Hilary Term, they were regularly employed in going between the Temple-stairs and Westminster-Hall on the ice, at each of which places they stood for hire, where the watermen were accustomed to be found: and this was far from being only for the gratification of curiosity, or novelty of the circumstance, since it should be remembered that at this period London Bridge was the only connection between the shores of Surrey and Middlesex; and that the use of boats was very general, on account of the rough paving of the streets which rendered riding in coaches very uneasy. By the <num value="16">16th</num> the number of persons keeping shops on the ice had so increased, that Evelyn says &ldquo;The Thames was fill'd with people and tents selling all sorts of wares as in the Citty;&rdquo; and by the <num value="24">24th</num> the varieties and festivities of a fair appear to have been fully established. &ldquo;The frost,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;continuing more and more severe, the Thames before London was still planted with boothes in formal streetes, all sorts of trades and shops furnish'd and full of commodities, even to a printing-presse, where the people and ladyes tooke a fancy to have their names printed, and the day and yeare set down when printed on the Thames: this humour tooke so universally that &lsquo;twas estimated the printer gain'd <measure value="5l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5">5</num></measure>. a day for printing a line onely at sixpence a name,<NOTE N="c"><P>In a poem Printed on the Ice in this Frost, hereafter mentioned, there is the following passage relating to these printers; the last <num value="4">four</num> lines of which have been used in some of the verses commemorative of various Frost-Fairs, from that in <datestruct value="1684--"><year reg="1684">1684</year></datestruct> to the last in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>.

<P>It consists of a spirited, though unfinished, sketch on stout coarse paper, in pencil, slightly shaded with Indian-ink, the wellknown style of an artist particularly eminent for his views in the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, Thomas Wyck, commonly called Old Wyck, to distinguish him from his son John, who spent the greater part of his life in England.

It is preserved in the Illustrated Pennant's London, formerly belonging to J. C. Crowle, Esq. in the Print Room of the British Museum, Volume viii. after page <num value="262">262</num>.&mdash;The View is taken from the western side of the Temple-stairs, which appear on the left, and extends to London Bridge, which is faintly shewn in the centre at the back, with all the various buildings standing upon it during the frost. On the right is an oblique view of that double line of tents which extended across the centre of the river, called at the time Temple Street, consisting of taverns, toy-shops, &amp;c., generally distinguished by some title or sign; as the Duke of York's Coffee-House, the Tory-Booth, &ldquo;the Booth with a phenix on it, and ensured to last as long as the foundation stands,&rdquo; the Halfway House, the Bear-Gardenshire Booth, the Roast-Beef Booth, the Music Booth, the Printing Booth, the Lottery Booth, the Horn Tavern Booth, which is indicated about the centre of the present View by the antlers of a stag raised above it. On the outsides of this street were pursued the various spots of the Fair, some of which are represented in the annexed Plate; but in the nearer and larger figures of them in the Map mentioned by Evelyn, there appear extensive circles of spectators surrounding a bull-bait, and the rapid revolution of a whirling-chair or car drawn by several men by a long rope fastened to a stake fixed in the ice. Large boats, covered with tilts, capable of containing a number of passengers, and decorated with sails and steamers, were also used as sledges, some being drawn by watermen in want of their usual employment, and others by horses: <num value="1">one</num> of these had a drummer placed in the prow, and was called &ldquo;the Drum Boat.&rdquo; Another sort of boat was mounted upon wheels. The pastimes of throwing at a cock, sliding and skating, walking on stilts, roasting an Ox, foot-ball, skittles, pigeon-holes, cups and balls, &amp;c. <pb id="p.20" n="20"> are represented in the larger print as being carried on in various parts of the river; a sliding-hutch propelled by a stick, a chariot with <num value="3">three</num> wheels moved by a screw, and stately coaches, filled with visitors, are rapidly moving in different directions; whilst sledges with coals and wood are passing between the London and Southwark banks. As in the present view, the gardens of the Temple and the river itself are drawn full of numerous other spectators; but the annexed representation is perhaps more pictorially interesting than the print in the general scene, from the view being considerably more spacious and carefully executed: since the former embraces the whole line of the Bankside to St. Saviour's Church, the Tower, the Monument finished in <datestruct value="1677--"><year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>, the windmill near Queenhythe, the new Bow Church, and some others of the New Churches, the vacant site and ruins of Bridewell Palace, and Old London Bridge. Having thus laid before the reader some notices of the establishment and general appearance of this remarkable scene, a descriptive list is added of the various views, separate sheets, and books, concerning it, which are known to be at present extant, with the names of the several collections in which those slight but curious reliques are still preserved.

<p><figure id="fig.1.20.1" n="2000.65.0010"><head>The Strand preparatory to its improvement in the year <date value="1810">1810</date>.</head></figure>
<P>No part of London required improvement more than this of the Strand, prior to the time of taking down the old houses, to widen and enlarge the street, in the year <datestruct value="1810"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>. The foot-path in many places being scarcely <num value="2">two</num> feet in width, passengers were frequently driven into the street, at the imminent hazard of being run-over by the great number of coaches and carts that were continually passing and repassing; the distance of the churchyard railing from the houses was so inconsiderable, that the carriages could scarcely clear themselves in passing each other; and if a waggon or cart of more than ordinary dimension, came in contact with almost any other vehicle, it rarely failed occasioning a stoppage for a considerable length of time, to the great danger and annoyance of all persons who might happen to be on the spot. The Strand being the principal and leading line thoroughfare to the city, made it a scene of continued resort and bustle throughout the day; and during <num value="9">nine</num> months in the year there was scarcely any difference in cleanliness or safety between the flag-stone pavement and the highway road. The line of houses charactered in the view, was erected on the site of the house and grounds of the celebrated Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, the unfortunate favourite of Queen Elizabeth; who, in <datestruct value="1600--"><year reg="1600">1600</year></datestruct>, sallied from Essex House, at the head of a few desperate and mad adherents (among whom was the Earl of Southampton), endeavouring to excite the city to arm in his behalf against its Sovereign the Queen; but finding little or no encouragement in his rebellion, forced his way back, barricaded the house, and stood upon his defence; but a piece of artillery being placed on the tower of St. Clement's Church, which commanded <hi rend=italics>Essex House</hi>, the Earl, after a short siege, submitted, and was shortly after beheaded. Essex House was originally founded by Walter Stapleton, Bishop of Exeter, and afterwards continued to be the habitation of the Bishops of that see, until the dissolution of the religious houses, when it was granted to the <num value="1">first</num> Lord Paget; it afterwards came into the possession of the great Duke of Somerset, and in the reign of Queen Elizabeth passed into the hands of Dudley, Earl of Leicester, who changed its name to Leicester House. The Earl left it by will to his son-in-law, the Earl of Essex, and it was afterwards called by his name; the memory of which is still retained in the name of <hi rend=italics>Essex Street</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Devereux Court:</hi> in the last, on the outside of the Grecian Coffeehouse, is placed a bust of the Parliament General, son of the favourite. 
<P>Arundel Street is seen in the distance, founded on the site of the spacious house and extensive gardens belonging to the celebrated Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel, famed for the magnificent collection of antique statues, vases, &amp;c. he formed when abroad, many of which are still preserved in the Arundelian Collection at Oxford. The Earl was employed in several embassies in the reigns of James I. and his successor; and acquired in Italy an elegant taste for painting and architecture; and, above all, for ancient statues, of which he was passionately fond. He employed collectors in most parts of Europe, and sent even into Greece, from whence he received several curious fragments of antiquity. He loved the company of antiquaries and virtuosi, and was the distinguished patron of the celebrated engraver Hollar, who drew and engraved many fine subjects from the Arundel Collection. Arundel House was pulled down in the <num value="17">17th</num> century, but the family name and titles are retained in the streets which rose on its site, viz. that of Howard, Norfolk, Arundel, and Surry. This part of the Strand, in the early time of Elizabeth's reign, was the scene of frequent disturbances, occasioned by the young students belonging to the Inns of Chancery, who were so riotous and unruly at night, parading the streets to the danger of peaceable passengers and annoyance of the neighbourhood, that the inhabitants were fain to keep watches. 
<P>In the year <datestruct value="1582"><year reg="1582">1582</year></datestruct>, the Recorder himself, with <num value="6">six</num> more of the honest inhabitants, stood by <hi rend=italics>St. Clement's</hi> Church, to see the lantern hanged out, and to observe if he could meet with any of these outrageous dealers. About <num value="7">seven</num> at night they saw young Mr. <hi rend=italics>Robert Cecil</hi>, the Lord Treasurer's son (who was after Secretary of State to the Queen) pass by the church, and as he passed, gave them a civil salute; at which they said, <hi rend=italics>Lo! you may see how a nobleman's son can use himself, and how he putteth off his cap to poor men. Our Lord bless him.</hi> This passage the Recorder wrote in a letter to his father, adding, &ldquo;Your Lordship hath cause to thank God for so virtuous a child.&rdquo; 
<P>Adjoining St. Clement's Church, in the upper churchyard, were <num value="2">two</num> charity-schools, <num value="1">one</num> for <num value="50">fifty</num> boys, who have clothes, learning, and each <num value="5">5</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> to put them out apprentice, by subscription. The <num value="2">second</num> school was for <num value="30">thirty</num> girls, who had learning and clothes by subscription. Many years prior to the improvements suggested by Alderman Pickett, the old school-houses were taken down, and the schools held in St. Clement's Lane, at the back of Clement's Inn. 
<P>In St. Clement's Churchyard were also <num value="15">fifteen</num> almshouses for <num value="30">thirty</num> poor women; and <num value="6">six</num> more, nearer the church, for <num value="12">twelve</num> poor women; but these latter, the churchwarden informed the Editor of the New View of London (Anno <datestruct value="1708"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>), were given to the poor of their parish in general, and that the inhabitants were only parish pensioners, though the people who resided there told the same person they were maintained and paid out of the rents of some houses in Holborn, appropriated for that purpose. At the demolition of these almshouses, to widen the street, <num value="6">six</num> new ones, consisting of <num value="12">twelve</num> rooms, were substituted in their stead, which are situated in a private court adjoining St. Clement's Inn gateway, St. Clement's Lane; where <num value="12">twelve</num> poor widows, parishioners, receive each <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure> weekly, and <num value="1">one</num> chaldron of coals annually to each house.

<div1 type="chapter" n="9" id="c.9"><HEAD>Antient Structure 
<LB>In 
<LB>Ship Yard, Temple Bar.</HEAD>
<p><figure id="fig.1.22.1" n="2000.65.0011"><head>South West View of an Antient Structure in Ship Yard Temple Bar, supposed to have been the residence of Elias Ashmole, Esq. the celebrated antiquary.</head></figure>

<P>Previous to the Fire of London, almost every street throughout the metropolis exhibited an appearance similar to that of Ship Yard, and in very few instances could boast of greater width, air, or accommodation. The Strand, in its immediate vicinity, was not completed as a street, until the year <datestruct value="1533"><year reg="1533">1533</year></datestruct>; before that time, it entirely cut off Westminster from London, and nothing intervened, except a few scattered houses, more resembling a country village, than any thing like the neighbourhood of the <num value="1">first</num> city in the world. All the houses on the south side had great gardens to the river, and were called by their owners' names, and in after-times gave title to the several streets that succeeded them, leading down to the Thames; each of them had stairs for the conveniency of taking boat, many of which remain in use to the present time. The architecture of the antient houses in Ship Yard is precisely that of the old buildings near Chancery Lane, <num value="1">one</num> of which was inhabited by the celebrated Isaac Walton, author of the Complete Angler, and greatly resembles many still remaining in Leadenhall and Bishopsgate Streets, Smithfield, Whitechapel, High Street Borough, Westminster, &amp;c. That many of these antiquated, and at present dilapidated and decayed dwellings, were once the residence of persons of rank, opulence, and consequence, is past all doubt: and we have higher authority than traditionary information to establish the facts. The great Duc de Sully was lodged, during his embassy to England, on the accession of James I. in Arundel House, formerly Bath's Inn, the buildings of which, though extensive, were both low and mean; the well-known Queen of Bohemia condescended to inhabit Craven House, afterwards converted to an inn; Sir Philip Sidney had his abode in the Old Bailey; and the great Sir Walter Raleigh's mansion is at present a rendezvous and house of accommodation for country graziers, drovers, &amp;c. at Islington, known by the sign of the Pyed Bull. 
<P>The principal building exhibited in the view, might originally have formed but <num value="1">one</num> establishment, though, from the visible alterations on the ground-floor, for the convenience of shops, it has been divided into separate tenements, for the purpose of easier accommodation to speculating tradesmen. Elias Ashmole, who is supposed to have resided here, had occasion for still larger premises than these appear, being the greatest collector of curiosities of any man in England, independent of the room required for the various apparatus, he must necessarily have had for his different pursuits and studies in astrology, botany, chemistry, heraldry, and antiquities; in all of which he was a great proficient. In addition to his Diary, which is a very curious and interesting work, he published, under the feigned name of James Hasolle, Esq. his &ldquo;Fasciculus Chemicus; or, Chemical Collections, expressing the Ingress, Progress, and Egress of the Secret Hermetic Science,&rdquo; &amp;c. <num value="12">12</num>mo. His &ldquo;Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum,&rdquo; published in <num value="4">4</num>to. <datestruct value="1652--"><year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct>, contains many pieces of our old Hermetic philosophers. This work gained him a considerable reputation, which was very much increased by his laborious and accurate &ldquo;History of the Order of the Garter,&rdquo; published in folio, <datestruct value="1672--"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>. Mr. Ashmole enjoyed several lucrative places under the government in the reign of Charles II. the emoluments of which greatly forwarded the establishment of the Museum at Oxford,<NOTE N="*"><P>John Tradescant, gardener to Charles I. was the <num value="1">first</num> man that distinguished himself as a collector of natural and artificial curiosities, and was followed by his son in the same pursuit, who with his wife joined in a deed of gift, by which their friend Mr. Ashmole was entitled to their collection after the decease of the former. It was accordingly claimed by him; but the widow Tradescant refusing to deliver it, was compelled by a decree of the Court of Chancery. She was soon after found drowned in a pond in her own garden.</NOTE> which bears his name, and was founded in his lifetime.

<P>The original Painting of this extremely curious historical picture, is <num value="1">one</num> of a series of <num value="3">three</num>, designed as a lively supplication and prophecy, to call the attention of the Sovereign to the dilapidated and degraded state of St. Paul's Cathedral; invented by Henry Farley, and executed by John Gipkyn in <datestruct value="1616--"><year reg="1616">1616</year></datestruct>. They are painted upon <num value="2">two</num> leaves of wood, shaped at the top like a pediment, and made to fold together with hinges at the back, in the manner of the ancient <hi rend=italics>Diptycha</hi>, or folding tables; or the ordinary representations of the Tables of the Decalogue. Each of the leaves measures <num value="4">4</num> feet <num value="2">2</num> inches to the point of the pediment, by <num value="3">3</num> feet <num value="4">4</num> inches in breadth; and each painting is surrounded by a black frame, with an inscription upon it in gold capital letters. The <num value="1">first</num> painting is on the outside of the right-hand leaf, and represents a view of London, Southwark, and the river. On the Surrey side of the Thames appear <num value="5">five</num> churches, St. Saviour's being the principal; and before it is the Palace of the Bishop of Winchester, in the gate of which are <num value="2">two</num> men in gowns with white sleeves, following a long procession of trumpeters, chaplains in black gowns with white sleeves, &amp;c. over London Bridge. This edifice appears lined with houses, and secured by a gate surmounted with a pediment and cross; and the right-hand terminates in perspective, with the massive tower of the old church of St. Magnus. Beyond the Bridge, in Watling Street, the procession is continued by the Corporation of London; the Common- Council walking last in black gowns, <num value="3">three</num> and <num value="3">three</num>, then <num value="9">nine</num> Aldermen in red, with chains, in the same order, and then the Sword-bearer and the Lord Mayor. Before these appear <num value="12">twelve</num> clergymen in black, following as many Bishops in their rochets, with the Archbishop of Canterbury at their head, holding his cap in his hand. He is preceded by <num value="9">nine</num> noblemen, some in black, and others in red, doublets; before whom are <num value="12">twelve</num> ladies in black, and red gowns, and stiff ruffs, with <num value="5">five</num> pages in cloaks walking before them. This part of the procession has arrived at the west door of St. Paul's Cathedral, under which appears the King, in a red dress faced with ermine, wearing his crown. On <num value="1">one</num> side of the gate stands a boy of Christ's Hospital, holding his cap in his left hand, and presenting the usual address to the Sovereign with his right; and on the opposite side is a girl of the same charity. On the left hand, without the door, is the Bishop of London, in the ordinary place for meeting the Sovereign at his entrance into the Church; over the gate of which is inscribed in capitals &ldquo;Behold the King cometh with great joy!&rdquo; The View of London comprises <num value="20">twenty</num> churches in the City, Baynard's Castle, and the Tower; the latter appearing like a square fort surrounded by an embattled wall, with round turrets at the corners and a gate to the water. In the centre of the south side of the building is a circular tower of several stages, with a lofty cross upon it; probably intended for that called the Hall Tower at the inner gate. The Thames is covered with ships, bearing the union flag introduced by King James I.; and beyond London is the usual prospect of hills, especially that of Highgate, on the right, which is found in all the ancient views of the metropolis. From the sky proceed these <num value="2">two</num> lines in capital letters:&mdash;

<P>The deviser of this extraordinary picture appears to have been a pious, disinterested, and zealous person, named Henry Farley, who for <num value="8">eight</num> years importuned both the King and the nation with schemes and entreaties for the reparation of St. Paul's Cathedral; which had remained defaced and without a spire, ever since the latter was destroyed <datestruct VALUE="1561-06-4"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=4>4th</day>, <year reg=1561>1561</year></datestruct>.

It is called &ldquo;St. Pavl's Chvrch, her Bill for the Parliament, as it was presented to the King's Majestie on Midlent-Sunday last, and intended for the view of that most high and honourable Court, and generally for all such as bear good will to the reflourishing estate of the said Chvrch: Partly in Verse, Partly in Prose. Penned and published for her good by Hen. Farley, Author of her Complaint.&rdquo; As the contents of this very singular collection are especially connected with the Painting engraven for the present work, and are also of great curiosity, some account of the tract shall now be given. 
<P>It commences with a dedication to the High Court of Parliament, and Verses between St. Paul's and the Book; which are followed by &ldquo;a Posie of sundry flowers and herbes, gathered out of the Garden of God's Word, knit vp together, and set in the Frontispice of this worke, for the smell of every good Reader, as a sweet odour to the rest that followes:&rdquo; these are, as might be supposed, a collection of texts of Scripture concerning the rebuilding of the Temple at Jerusalem, with quaint marginal comments. Next succeeds &ldquo;a Parallel of present time with time past: or of a good King liuing, with a faithfull good King (Josiah) long since deceased;&rdquo; and after this comes a series of prayers or petitions on behalf of the Cathedral. The <num value="1">first</num> is in metre, entitled, &ldquo;This Prayer or Petition is for the King, Prince, &amp;c. and directed to the King of Kings:&rdquo; <num value="2">Second</num>, an Acrostic &ldquo;Carolus Princeps,&rdquo; directed to the Prince of Princes:&rdquo; <num value="3">third</num> in Prose, &ldquo;this a Petition to the King's Majestie onely;&rdquo; it is written in the name of the Church, and mentions the author as &ldquo;this poore man, who hath been my voluntary seruant these <num value="8">eight</num> years, by books, petitions and other deuises, even to his owne dilapidations;&rdquo; at the end of it is &ldquo;St. Paule's her Conceipt after this Petition:&rdquo; <num value="4">fourth</num>, a petition also written in the name of the Church, &ldquo;and Presented to the King <num value="2">two</num> dayes before his Majestie came to visit me, viz. on Friday the <datestruct VALUE="1619-03-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1619">1619</year></datestruct>. But the Master of Requests then attending, tooke it away from his Highnesse before he could reade it, as many things had beene so taken before, to the great hindrance and grief of the poore author.&rdquo; This address commences in the following curious manmer:&mdash;&ldquo;To the King's most Sacred Majesty. Whereas to the exceeding great ioy of all my deare friends, there is certaine intelligence giuen that Your Highnesse will visit me on Sunday next: And the rather I beleeue it, for that I haue had more sweeping, brushing, and cleansing, than in <num value="40">40</num> years before;&rdquo; to which the margin adds &ldquo;My workmen lookt like him they called Mull'd-Sacke, after sweeping of a chimney.&rdquo;<NOTE N="a"><P>For a full account of this notorious person, see the Rev.

<P>as they have been given to the King at sundry times, but not till now published.&rdquo; The narrative is conducted in a Dialogue between the Church and the Author, which thus commences. &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>St. Pavles.</hi> <num value="1">First</num>, recite to me in briefe, the Dreame or Vision thou hadst, after thou didst publish my Complaint, which thou didst present to his Majesty by a Picture, and which Picture thou intendedst to hane giuen to his Majestie if thy petition had not failed thee.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Farley.</hi> It was a dream in <num value="3">Three</num> Parts;&rdquo; and he then proceeds to give the preceding description of the triform Painting he had executed as a pictorial delineation of his vision. It seems, however, to have been &ldquo;a dream which was not all a dream;&rdquo; since he states in a metrical Prologue, also delivered to the King, that it begun on the Eve of St. James the Apostle, but continued long after. At the request of the Cathedral Farley goes on to repeat his other labours on her behalf, as follow: a Conceipt presented with the Cathedral's Complaint to the Lord Mayor of London, Sir John Jolles, Knight, with a Petition, a little after Christmas, <datestruct value="1615--"><year reg="1615">1615</year></datestruct>, to which, he observes, the &ldquo;answer was honourable and worthy at that time:&rdquo; a Letter devised in the name of St. Paul's &ldquo;to the Reuerend Preachers that come to my Crosse:&rdquo; a Carol given to the King the Christmas-day before his departure for Scotland: Verses to the King when he took coach at Theobald's in his progress to Scotland: &ldquo;a Welcome to his Majestie, as I intended to present the same at Windsor, but was hindered of my purpose:&rdquo; another Christmas Carol given to the King on the Christmas-day after his return from Scotland. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; says the author to the Church, with much ludicrous pathos, &ldquo;my candle was cleane burnt out, and this last Carol was the last thing I presented to his Majestie, vntill <num value="2">two</num> dayes before his coming to visit you, (which was the petition before recited). In this interim I grew much dismayed, for that I saw little hope of your helpe: many rubs I ranne through, many scoffes and scornes I did vndergo; forsaken by my butterfiie-friends, laught at and derided by your enemies; pursued after by wolves of Wood Street, and foxes of the Poultrey; sometimes strongly <hi rend=italics>in-countered</hi>, and sometimes at the point of death and despaire. Instead of seruing my Prince (which I humbly desired, thou gh bu as a doore-keeper, in you), I was presst for the service of King Lud; when all the comfort I had was that I could see you, salute you, and condole with your miseries; my poore clothes and ragges I could not compare to anything better than to your west end, and my seruice to you nothing lesse than bondage. So as I was troubled in my sleepes, and dreamed I heard fearfull voyces sounding in and about you, which were as follow.&rdquo;&mdash;The voices are cries from the spirits in the tombs and different parts of the building, complaining of its dilapidation in verse; to which the author answers, also in metre, that he will forsake England and go to Virginia. &ldquo;So going to the Treasurer for Virginia,&rdquo; continues he, &ldquo;with resolution to depart the land with speed, hee being not then at leisure (vpon a Saturday in Lent), appointed me to come the Wednesday following: and at my returne from Aldersgate to your presence againe, there came newes, by a sweet western gale of winde, that his Majestie would certainly come to visit you on Mid-Lent Sunday in great solemnity. At which most ioyfull tidings I forgott Virginia againe, and attended with hope of some happie successe to my hearty desires towards your reparation; which, I thanke the Lord, was performed to the full of my expectation for that time.&rdquo; The tract concludes with St. Paul's thanking the author in rhyme, promising that he shall be buried within her walls, and reciting an odd epitaph upon him; to which Farley adds that ever upon Mid-Lent Sunday, or the <datestruct VALUE="-03-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, he will present something to his Sovereign on the behalf of the Cathedral. &ldquo;A Postscript to the Courteous and Charitable Reader,&rdquo; occupies the recto of the last leaf.

<P>AFTER the Romans had quitted this country, and left the inhabitants to the irruptions and spoliage of the Saxons, the latter, more civilized as they became settlers, sought to improve themselves in arts and sciences. They found that civilization induced rational religious principles; therefore the benevolent dictates of the Christian doctrines superseded pagan worship, and its votaries considered that too much honour could not be offered to a religion which informed them of the only way to the mansions of bliss. 
<P>We are not, however, to consider but that Christianity flourished among the Britons long before the Saxons had infested the country. Helen, the mother of Constantine the Great, as well as her son, were both Christians; and afterwards the kingdom was divided into the ecclesiastical provinces of York, Caerleon, and London, the Archbishops of which had jurisdiction over <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> episcopacies. 
<P>The case was then very different among the Saxons. They had driven the Britons into the remote parts of the kingdom, without having profited by any previous intercourse. The consequence resulting from such measures, was the most debased state of barbarism, the concomitant of which was slavery. When the country became too full of inhabitants, it was the custom of that people to sell their youth for slaves in foreign markets to the highest bidders. 
<P>A lot of <num value="3">three</num> youths were exposed for sale in the Forum at Rome: St. Gregory, called the Great, then Bishop, in passing observed them, and enquiring their country, was answered, &ldquo;Angli.&rdquo; The good pastor, from the symmetry of their limbs and the beauty of their countenances, exclaimed &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Quasi Angeli!</hi>&rdquo; and from the benevolent consideration that Christianity should be preached among their countrymen, appointed Augustine, <num value="1">one</num> who had received his education from St. Gregory, and was a monk in the Convent of St. Andrew at Rome, to undertake a mission to England, about the year <datestruct value="596"><year reg="596">596</year></datestruct>, to convert the English to the Christian faith; some other monks were chosen to be under Augustine's direction, and every mode was adopted to confer authenticity on his sacred embassy. 
<P>At this period Brunehaute, a pious woman, was queen of Austrasia and Burgundy. The mission had arrived at Provence, when the missionaries began to entertain great doubts and fears respecting the fierce people they were about to reduce to humanity and religion: they deputed their superior to return to Gregory, with a request that he would recall them. The Pontiff was resolute, and refused; but at the same time dispatched letters to the then courts of France, that they would not only succour the missionaries, but do all in their power to assist their object. Brunehaute instantly commenced her good offices, and used her interest with the other potentates; so that the mission, now increased to <num value="40">forty</num> persons, landed in the Isle of Thanet, over which, as part of the kingdom of Kent, Ethelbert reigned at that period. 
<P>His Queen was Bertha, daughter of Caribert, King of Paris, and cousin-german not only to Childebert, late King of Austrasia, but to Clotaire, King of Soissons, who embraced the Christian faith; the education of Queen Bertha had been therefore truly orthodox, and being herself piously inclined, it had been stipulated at her marriage with King Ethelbert, that not only her religious principles should be uninvaded, but that she should be allowed a minister of her own profession to assist her in her devotions. His name was Lindhard, a venerable prelate, equally exemplary for his learning as his holiness of life; he officiated at the Church of St. Martin, which had been built by the Roman Christians, without the walls of Dorovernum, and by his conversation and practice he had induced many of the courtiers and nobility openly to profess themselves proselytes to his faith. The zeal and benevolence of the Queen also, joined to her uncommon learning, had prepossessed Ethelbert to think very favourably of Christianity; so that Augustine and his followers were very liberally accommodated, and having obtained an audience, so wrought upon the King's mind, that ultimately they obtained every license they wished to proclaim their mission, and Augustine having fixed his residence at Dorovernum, which he called Canterbury, became the <num value="1">first</num> Romish Archbishop of that diocese. 
<P>The powerful influence of Ethelbert, and the celebrity of the new doctrines, spread <pb id="p.28" n="28"> throughout all the provinces of the Heptarchy; and among others, Sebert, King of the East Angles, was desirous that <num value="1">one</num> of the missionaries might be selected to inculcate his religious principles among Sebert's subjects. For this purpose Augustine appointed Mellitus, who on his arrival in the kingdom of Essex, fixed his residence and episcopacy at London; and as an encouragement to the new Bishop, King Ethelbert erected a Church on the foundation of a temple to the worship of Diana, and dedicated the new fabric to St. Paul the Apostie, about the year <datestruct value="610"><year reg="610">610</year></datestruct>.<NOTE N="*"><P>Camden, in his Britannia, informs us that Augustine, contrary to the advice and express orders of Pope Gregory, had previously transferred the metropolitical see from London to Canterbury.</NOTE>

<P>To support Bishop Mellitus in his new dignity, the King bestowed on the Church the manor of Tillingham. At this period Sebert governed this territory as a tributary King to Ethelbert, and he was converted by Mellitus to Christianity; he is said also to have been the founder of Westminster Abbey. 
<P>St. Paul's Cathedral received no further benefit till Erkenwald, the <num value="4">fourth</num> Bishop, in <num value="675">675</num> bestowed on it vast repairs; and not only augmented its privileges from the Pope, but prevailed on the Saxon Kings to grant additional privileges. Indeed, the interest which this devout prelate took in rendering the revenues of his Cathedral equal to the pious purpose for which it was constructed, was so extraordinary, that after his decease every honour was conferred on his remains; he was also canonized, and a stately shrine was erected at the east end of the church, to which his body was translated; but the whole was destroyed by fire, in the year <datestruct value="961"><year reg="961">961</year></datestruct>, during the reign of King Edgar, and rebuilt in the same year. 
<P>The new Church, which however could not have been a very considerable structure at this period, flourished during the reigns of the Saxon Kings, some of whom declared it &ldquo;as free in all its rights, as they themselves desired to be at the Day of Judgment.&rdquo; 
<P>In this state it continued till the year <datestruct value="1086"><year reg="1086">1086</year></datestruct>, when a <num value="2">second</num> calamity by fire reduced the Cathedral, and the greater part of the City, to a heap of ruins. The destruction occasioned by this dreadful conflagration, served to inspire Bishop Maurice with the benevolent intention of erecting a more magnificent building than had yet been applied to the purposes of devotion in this kingdom; and to increase his means for this vast undertaking, he obtained of William I, a grant of all the stone-work of a spacious fortification near the river Fleet, called the Palatine Tower, towards finishing his Cathedral. This munificent prelate prosecuted the building with great earnestness during the remainder of his life, but left it in an unfinished state, though he had governed the see for the space of <num value="20">twenty</num> years. He obtained of his Sovereign the grant of the castle of Stortford, in Hertfordshire, with all its appurtenances, to this Cathedral for ever; hence the town obtained the denomination of Bishop's Stortford. 
<P>His successor, Richard de Belmeis, prosecuted the work with ardour, and expended the whole revenue of his see upon this fabric, yet left it unfinished. 
<P>Henry III. in <num value="1">one</num> of his charters to the citizens of London, granted for him and his heirs, that out of the farm of the City of London there should be allowed yearly to the Sheriff of that City, in his account at the Exchequer, the sum of <num value="7">7</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> for the Liberty of St. Paul's. 
<P>But the Cathedral was not consecrated till <datestruct VALUE="1235-10--"><month reg="10">October</month> <year reg="1235">1235</year></datestruct>, by Roger, surnamed Niger, Bishop of London; and it continued to be an object of admiration till <datestruct value="1444"><year reg="1444">1444</year></datestruct>, when, on the <datestruct VALUE="-02-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, the steeple was fired by lightning, but by timely assistance was imagined to be extinguished; the latent flame, however, again burst forth about <num value="9">nine</num> at night, and the greater part of the wooden frame was consumed. 
<P>This damage having been repaired, the Cathedral continued uninjured till Wednesday, <datestruct VALUE="1561-06-4"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=4>4</day>, <year reg=1561>1561</year></datestruct>, when it having rained incessantly, a thunder-storm commenced about <num value="4">four</num> in the afternoon; and the lightning having struck the steeple within a yard of the top, &ldquo;a little fire appeared at <num value="1">first</num> like to the light of a torch, which increased so much towards the weather-cock, that it fell down within half a quarter of an hour; and, blown up with a high wind, the fire within an hour burnt the whole steeple down to the very battlements: which also, receiving the timber that fell from the spire, began to burn so vehemently that all the timber took fire, and the iron and bells melted and fell down upon the stairs in the Church in a short space; and the east and west roofs of the Cathedral catching fire, burnt so furiously, that these ends and the north and south were consumed before <num value="1">one</num> o'clock after midnight; when there was not a piece of timber left, nor lead unmolten upon any of the higher and cross roofs and battlements. The side isles were a little scorched, but not ruined; neither did the damage end here: divers houses were pulled down in the Churchyard, <pb id="p.29" n="29"> near the north door: a pinnacle at the east end fell and demolished a house&mdash;a sad sight. But,&rdquo; says the writer, &ldquo;the French here (in London) were not sorry to see it.&rdquo;<NOTE N="*"><P>Jones's MSS. This person was a witness of the catastrophe. In some curious manuscript notes, collected by Mr. Martin Masters, of monastic remains, the following remarkable circumstance is mentioned: <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Hopton, in his &lsquo;Concordancie enlarged,&rsquo; printed <datestruct value="1635--"><year reg="1635">1635</year></datestruct>, p. <num value="227">227</num>, sayeth that Ann. <datestruct value="1561--"><year reg="1561">1561</year></datestruct>, <datestruct VALUE="-04-6"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=6>6th</day></datestruct>.

For the truth of the occasion of the firing of it, I shall give this relation upon my owne knowledge. Anno <datestruct value="1622"><year reg="1622">1622</year></datestruct>, I was put an apprentis upon London Bridge unto a wholesale tradesman, who was a Common Counselman of the Bridge Ward; after that I had served him <num value="2">2</num> or <num value="3">3</num> yeares the Deputie of the same Warde, <num value="1">one</num> afternoone, desired my master to bear him company to see an ancient citizenne, about <num value="100">100</num> yeares of age or upwards, that lay bed-rid and cumbered in mind; he had related the truth of the occasion of the fiering of Paules steeple, whose relation unto them (as I did heere them relate it at severall times unto severall people), was, &lsquo;That hee being a servant unto a workman that belonged unto the Deane and Chapter &lsquo;of St. Paules, was sent by his master to make search for some plase where the raine came in at the spiere; he &lsquo;having a candle with him, snuffing it, the snuff fell into some crack in the timber-worke; he not minding of it, he &lsquo;came downe again, and went about his other occasions; and shortly after, when there was neither tempest or &lsquo;lightning, the steeple fiered.&rsquo; This doe I very well remember, having several times repeated it. 
<P>Per me Martin Masters, aged <num value="69">69</num> yearez, <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE></NOTE>

<P>Such an accident to this stately structure was deemed a national concern; and Queen Elizabeth directed her letters to the Lord Mayor, requiring him to take speedy order for its repair, and, to further the work, gave out of her privy purse <measure value="1000bmark" type=currency><datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct> marks</measure> in gold, and a warrant for <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct> loads of timber, to be taken from her woods or elsewhere.

<P>The zeal exhibited by all ranks to promote this work of benevolence, produced such a good effect, that in the space of <num value="5">five</num> years, the timber roofs (the <num value="2">two</num> largest of which where framed in Yorkshire, and brought by sea), were entirely finished and covered with lead. Some difference of opinion, however, having arisen, concerning the model of the steeple, that part of the work was unattempted, and was never rebuilt; for, upon raising the roofs, the walls were found to be so much decayed in consequence of the corrosive quality of the coal smoke, that a general repair of the whole building was judged absolutely necessary. This was delayed till the reign of James I. when, in the year <datestruct value="1612"><year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct>, and for <num value="8">eight</num> years afterwards, the solicitations of Mr. Henry Farley, a private gentlemen, so far prevailed, that the King took into his serious consideration the dilapidated state of the Cathedral, and to prevent its utter ruin, determined to use every means for its repair; and that the countenance which he was about to give, should not want due and solemn form, the following grand possession took place on the <datestruct VALUE="1620-03-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1620">1620</year></datestruct>:

<P>Upon the King's arrival at the Church, he alighted at the west door, and having kneeled at the brazen pillar, and prayed for good success to this pious intention, was received under a canopy, supported by the Dean and Residentiaries; the rest of the prebendaries and dignitaries, with the whole choir, going before. In the choir a suitable Anthem was performed, whence the whole congregation went to the Cross, where Dr. John King, Bishop of London, delivered a learned Sermon, preached from the following text, appointed by His Majesty, Psalm cii. v. <num value="13">13</num>, <num value="14">14</num>. &ldquo;Thou wilt arise and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to have mercy thereon, for the appointed time is come. For thy servants delight in the stones thereof, and have pity on the dust thereof.&rdquo; 
<P>After the service His Majesty and his attendants repaired to the Bishop's palace, when it was agreed to issue a proclamation, under the great seal, empowering several principal personages, or any <num value="6">six</num> of them, to enquire into the true state of the decays, with the cause thereof, and to consider of the necessary repairs, and the means of raising money for carrying them into execution. Besides which, it was concluded that a general benevolence throughout the kingdom should be attempted; and the King began the subscription by a handsome donation. The Bishop subscribed <num value="100">100</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> and proposed to do the same annually whilst he continued Bishop. His successor, Dr. Mountaine, was equally assiduous, and disbursed vast sums of money for the purchase of Portland stone. 
<P>However, the work went on slowly, and the stone purchased by Bishop Mountaine lying useless, was borrowed by the Duke of Buckingham, for building the water-gate at York House, which is now standing at the bottom of Buckingham Street, Strand. 
<P>In this deplorable state did St. Paul's Cathedral remain till <datestruct value="1628"><year reg="1628">1628</year></datestruct>, when the munificent Laud arrived at the prelacy. He procured another commission from King Charles I. by which it was expressed, &ldquo;<num value="1">1</num>. That all money brought in for the repair, should be paid into the Chamber of London.&mdash;<num value="2">2</num>. That William Laud, then Bishop of London, offered to allow <num value="100">100</num><hi rend=italics>l. per annum</hi>, out of the revenue of that bishopric during his continuance therein.&mdash;<num value="3">3</num>. That a register-book of all subscriptions for contributions thereto, should be made, as in King James's time.&mdash;<num value="4">4</num>. That the Judges of the Prerogative Court, and all officials throughout the several bishoprics in England and Wales, upon the decease of any person intestate, should be excited to remember this Church, out of what was proper to be given for pious uses.&mdash;<num value="5">5</num>. And lastly, there should be Letters Patents issued out, for the receiving of public contributions from all people throughout the whole kingdom.&rdquo; 
<P>By these means, the sums, raised from <datestruct value="1631--"><year reg="1631">1631</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1643--"><year reg="1643">1643</year></datestruct>, amounted to <num value="101330">101,330</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>; out of which no more than <num value="35551">35,551</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="4.50">4 1/2</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> was laid out; for in <datestruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct>, to the astonishment of the whole world, the flames of civil dissension broke out; and by the votes of both Houses of Parliament, Bishops, Deans, and Chapters were abolished, by which the very foundation of the celebrated Cathedral was destroyed. At the commencement of the ensuing year the fanatic Lord Mayor, Isaac Pennington, caused the cross to be destroyed. The houses and revenues belonging to the Dean and Chapter were seized by order of Parliament; and ultimately the Church itself was violated, the stalls in the choir taken away, the pavement torn up, the monuments defaced and demolished, saw-pits formed in the Church for the disposal of the timber intended for its repair, and the body of the Church converted into horse-quarters for the Parliament soldiers! 
<P>&ldquo;So that,&rdquo; says Sir William Dugdale, &ldquo;what the Lord Brooke, passing by water, upon the Thames, <datestruct VALUE="-03-13"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=13>13</day></datestruct>, A. D. <datestruct value="1640"><year reg="1640">1640</year></datestruct>, with <num value="3">three</num> other Lords, said concerning this famous Cathedral, viz. &lsquo;That he hoped that <num value="1">one</num> of them would live to see no <num value="1">one</num> stone left upon another of that building,&rsquo; may, I now fear, come to pass: for, by taking away the inner scaffolds, which supported the arched vaults, in order to their late intended repair, the whole roof of the south cross is already tumbled down; and the rest, in several places of the Church, often falling out. Out of a sad contemplation, therefore, that so glorious a structure, there raised, enriched, and beautified by the piety of our deceased ancestors, should be utterly destroyed, and become a woeful spectacle of ruin, I have adventured, though much unworthy for such undertaking, to give some representation, as well to the present age as future times, of what it hath been.&rdquo; 
<P>The great fire in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct> destroyed its ancient beauties, and out of its ashes has arisen the present noble fabric, <num value="1">one</num> of the most stately monuments of modern architecture in the world. <pb id="p.31" n="31">

<P>The early celebrity of Paul's Cross, as the great seat of pulpit eloquence, is evinced in the lines above quoted, which inform us that the most subtil and abstract questions in theology were handled here by the friars, in opposition to the regular clergy, almost at the <num value="1">first</num> settlement of that popular order of preachers in England. 
<P>Of the custom of preaching at crosses, it is difficult to trace the origin; it was doubtless far more remote than the time alluded to, and probably, at <num value="1">first</num>, merely accidental. &ldquo;The sanctity of this species of pillar,&rdquo; says a late topographical writer,<NOTE N="*"><P>Pennant.</NOTE> &ldquo;often caused a considerable resort of people, to pay their devotion to the great object of their erection. A preacher, seeing a large concourse, might be seized by a sudden impulse, ascend the steps, and deliver out his pious advice from a station so fit to inspire attention, and so conveniently formed for the purpose. The example might be followed till the practice became established by custom.&rdquo; 
<P>The famous Paul's Cross, like many others in various parts of the kingdom (afterwards converted to the same purpose), was doubtless, at <num value="1">first</num>, a common cross, and co&euml;val with the church. When it was <num value="1">first</num> covered and used as a pulpit cross, we are not informed.<NOTE N="*"><P>Stowe describes it as being in his time, &ldquo;a pulpit crosse of timber mounted upon steppes of stone, and covered with leade, standing in the midst of the churchyard, the very antiquitie whereof was to him vnknowne.&rdquo; Ed. <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> We hear, however, of its being in use as early as the year <datestruct value="1259"><year reg="1259">1259</year></datestruct>, when Henry III. in person, commanded the mayor to swear before him every stripling of <num value="12">twelve</num> years old and upwards to be true to him and his heirs. From this time its name continually occurs in history. It was used, observes the writer above quoted, not only for the instruction of mankind by the doctrine of the preacher, but for every purpose, political or ecclesiastical; for giving force to oaths; for promulgating of laws, or rather the royal pleasure; for the emission of papal bulls; for anathematizing sinners; for benedictions; for exposing of penitents under censure of the church; for recantations; for the private ends of the ambitious; and for the defaming of those who had incurred the displeasure of crowned heads. 
<P>Stowe, and his commentators, having noticed the principal transactions which gave celebrity to this Cross, we shall merely add, that the last sermon of any particular note, preached here, was before James I. when he came in great state on horseback from Whitehall on Midlent Sunday <datestruct value="1620--"><year reg="1620">1620</year></datestruct>, attended by his court, to consult about repairing the cathedral. The sermon was preached by Dr. John King, Bishop of London, himself a great benefactor to that work. The King sat in a prepared place, and was afterwards regaled with a magnificent banquet.<NOTE N="*"><P>This sermon, part of which is extracted below, is a curious specimen of the quaint eloquence of the day. It is called &ldquo;A Sermon at Paule's Crosse, on behalfe of Paule's Church, <datestruct VALUE="1620-03-26"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=26>26</day>, <year reg=1620>1620</year></datestruct>, by the Bishop of London, both preached and published at His Majestie's Commandement. Text, Psal. cii. vers. <num value="13">13</num>, <num value="14">14</num>.&rdquo; Alluding to the great object of his discourse, the preacher says, &ldquo;I am now to speake to you, of a literall and artificiall <hi rend=italics>Sion</hi>, a Temple without life, yet of a sickly and crazie constitution, sicke of age itselfe, and with many aches in his joynts, togither with a lingring consumption, that hath long lien in her bowels, the timber in her beames whereof cryeth, <hi rend=italics>I perish</hi>, and the stones in the

<P>The Cross represented in the Plate is probably the same which was built by Bishop Kempe<NOTE N="*"><P>Thomas Kempe, Bishop of London, was a younger son of Sir Thomas Kempe, Knight ( brother to John Kempe, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Cardinal), by his wife Emmeline, daughter and heir of Henry Chicke, who was of the family of Henry Chicheley, Archbishop of Canterbury, and founder of All Souls College, in Oxford.&mdash;He (Thomas Kempe) was appointed Bishop of London, by a papal bull, dated <datestruct VALUE="1448-08-21"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=21>21</day>, <year reg=1448>1448</year></datestruct>, which did not receive the royal assent till <datestruct VALUE="-02-3"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=3>3</day></datestruct>-<num value="4">4</num>, <datestruct value="1450--"><year reg="1450">1450</year></datestruct>.

<P>THE history of these <num value="3">three</num> structures is so connected, that an account of their several foundations is requisite. 
<P>St. Alphage, Archbishop of Canterbury, was of very honourable parentage; and having spent his younger years in the monastery of Deerhurst, in the county of Gloucester, he afterwards became Prior of Glastonbury, which he resigned for the purpose of abiding by a life of stricter discipline at Bath, which was at that period looked upon as an extraordinary circumstance, considering the dignity of his lineage. In this retreat he was joined by other devotees, who elected him their abbot. In the year <datestruct value="984"><year reg="984">984</year></datestruct> he was appointed Bishop of Winchester; and having continued in that see for the space of <num value="22">twenty-two</num> years, he was, in <datestruct value="1006--"><year reg="1006">1006</year></datestruct>, raised to the archbishopric of Canterbury, where he conducted himself as became his sacred station till <datestruct value="1012"><year reg="1012">1012</year></datestruct>, when the Danish invaders of England, having been disappointed of a tribute they had demanded, spoiled and burnt the city and church of Canterbury, and spared only every <num value="10">tenth</num> person, both of clergy and laity. Having seized the virtuous metropolitan, they imprisoned him for the space of <num value="7">seven</num> months, and inflicted several torments on him, in their camp near Greenwich; and being enraged on account of his inability to pay the ransom which they had demanded, they murdered him on the spot. The citizens of London purchased the body at a great price. The corpse was <num value="1">first</num> buried in St. Paul's cathedral; but when Canute the Great sat on the English throne, <num value="11">eleven</num> years afterwards, he caused the body to be taken up and conveyed to Canterbury, where it was interred with great solemnity. Alphage was afterwards canonized, and the <datestruct VALUE="-04-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, the day on which he was supposed to have been martyred, appointed for his festival. On the spot where he was murdered at Greenwich, a church was consecrated, the site of the present structure; and that of which we are about to give a history and description, was erected to his memory in the city of London. 
<div2 type=section id="c.13.28"><HEAD>St. Alphage Church.</HEAD>

<P>The age of the original structure, which was dedicated to the above saint, is unknown: but it must have been of very considerable antiquity, since it appears to have &ldquo;been of old in the gift of the Deans of St. Martin-le-Grand, in London, and probably was given, at least confirmed, to that collegiate church by William the Conqueror (among several others, in and without the city); for, by his charter to that church, bearing date <datestruct value="1068"><year reg="1068">1068</year></datestruct>, he grants to it in these words, viz. <QUOTE lang=la>Concedo etiam in omnes ecclesias, et omnes decimas, terras quoque, et domos, quas fideles Christi infra London, vel extra, jam dedere vel in futurum donabunt. H&aelig;c igitur omnia, &amp;c.</QUOTE>&rdquo; 
<P>It continued in the presentation of the above Deans till the year <datestruct value="1487"><year reg="1487">1487</year></datestruct>, when John Kemp, Bishop of London, presented to the rectory, by lapse. It then reverted to the Dean, till Henry VII. having taken the whole into his possession, presented to this living in <datestruct value="1502--"><year reg="1502">1502</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1505--"><year reg="1505">1505</year></datestruct> it was under the patronage of the Abbot and Convent of Westminster, then under the patronage of the Bishop of Westminster; and, perhaps during the period of Bishop Thirlby's dilapidations, it was presented by Sir Rowland Hill, Lord Mayor of London, for that turn. However, Edward VI. in <datestruct value="1552--"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct>, granted the patronage to the Bishops of London, who have ever since continued patrons. 
<P>From the testimonies of the various historians of London, Stow, Newcourt, and Mr. Reading, in his Account of Sion College, subjoined to his Catalogue of that Library, we are induced to believe that the antient structure of St. Alphage occupied the ground now covered by a part of Cripplegate Buildings; and that the churchyard, situated at the east end, is the original place of sepulture belonging to the church, opposite Sion College. That was certainly its situation when the dissolution of monasteries took place, in the reign of Henry VIII.; when it was desecrated, and converted to be a carpenter's yard, though some respect was paid to the ashes of the dead; and the ground for burials not having been profaned, has continued to be appropriated for the sacred purposes for which it was originally intended, to the present period. It is inclosed on the south side by a brick wall, in the centre of which is a gate: the north side is bounded by the venerable city wall. 
<div1 type="chapter" n="14" id="c.14"><HEAD>>Elsinge's Hospital; or, as it is otherwise denominated, Elsynge Spittle.</HEAD>

<P>Stow, in his Survey of London, p. <num value="304">304</num>, informs us, that &ldquo;beneath the church of St. Mary, Aldermanbury, is Gayspur Lane (now Aldermanbury), which runneth down to London Wall, in which Lane, at the north end thereof, in Cripplegate Ward Within, was of old time a house of nuns, which house being in great decay, WILLIAM ELSYNGE, mercer, in the year of Christ <datestruct value="1329--"><year reg="1329">1329</year></datestruct> (<num value="3">3</num> Ed.

<P>It appears by the charter of foundation of this hospital, as inserted in the Monasticon,<NOTE N="*"><P>Vol. II. <num value="462">462</num>.</NOTE> that &ldquo;it was founded on the <datestruct VALUE="1331-06-1"><day reg="1">first</day> day of <month reg="06">June</month> <year reg="1331">1331</year></datestruct>;&rdquo; and that the foundation had not only the King's license, but the consent of Stephen Gravesend, Bishop of London, as well as of the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's cathedral, who, being patrons of the church of St. Mary, Aldermanbury, did, with the good will and consent of the said Bishop, appropriate the same to the newly-founded hospital. They, however, had this proviso, &ldquo;that the Dean and Chapter should ever after have the <pb id="p.34" n="34"> right of patronage in both, <hi rend=italics>tanquam in beneficiis unitis et consolidatis.</hi> Also, that the Dean and Chapter should prefer the custos and rector of the hospital and parish-church, and the <num value="1">first</num> and <num value="2">second</num> priests (there being appointed but <num value="4">four</num>, who shall celebrate divine offices in the said hospital), and William Elsinge, or his assigns, the other <num value="2">two</num>. And that the custos and rector, in his institution to the said hospital and church, should have the care of the souls both of the said hospital and parish committed to him, and should swear fealty to the said Dean and Chapter, and should pay them yearly the antient pension of <measure value="1bmark" type=currency><num value="1">one</num> mark</measure> due from the said church, and a pension of half a mark imposed upon the said hospital by the founder, in token of subjection to the church of St. Paul; and that the said custos and rector should find <num value="1">one</num> fit parish-priest, to be approved by the said Dean and Chapter, to serve the cure of the said parish; and that no custos should be preferred to the said hospital, or admitted to the said church, unless he was in priest's orders, and have no other benefice.&rdquo; By what has preceded, it appears that Elsinge Hospital, at <num value="1">first</num>, consisted of a custos or rector, and <num value="4">four</num> secular priests, besides the poor miserable pensioners. 
<P>The pious founder, desirous of extending the plan of this institution, in <datestruct value="1340--"><year reg="1340">1340</year></datestruct>, with the consent of the Dean and Chapter, obtained of Ralph Stratford, Bishop of London, his license to change the secular priests into canons regular of the order of St. Augustin, and to be governed by a prior: the Bishop also added another canon, making up the number <num value="5">five</num>, who were to be under the government of the prior, and upon every vacancy, by license from the Dean and Chapter, was to be chosen by the canons, and presented to the Dean and Chapter for approbation; he was then to be presented to the Bishop, who was to confirm him, declaring at the same time, &ldquo;that he did not, by such confirmation, intend, in any respect, to derogate from the rights of the Archdeacon of London.&rdquo; 
<P>William Grey, Bishop of London, patron and ordinary of Thele College, Hertfordshire, in the diocese of London, consisting of a master and <num value="4">four</num> chaplains, who, through the greatest negligence, had suffered much of the lands of that foundation to be lost, obtained a license of Henry VI. dated at Westminster, <datestruct VALUE="1430-03-14"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=14>14</day>, <year reg=1430>1430</year></datestruct>, to transfer the possessions which remained belonging to that College to the priory of Elsinge Spital, on condition to find <num value="2">two</num> canonsregular in the church of Thele, and <num value="3">three</num> in the priory, to pray for the souls of Sir William de Goldington, the founder of Thele College, his wife Margaret, his ancestors and heirs; and for the souls of Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford, and Thomas de Vere, his son, &amp;c. The estates conveyed by this transfer were the churches of Stansted Thele and Aldham, and various lands, tenements, and possessions, situated in Buer Gifford, Chelmsford, Writtle, and Bromfield, in the county of Essex; and Thele, Stansted-Abbot, Amwell, Broxborne, and Hoddesdon, in the county of Hertford. Bishop Grey, with the consent of the prior and convent, ordained, that &ldquo;for the said Bishop's indemnity, they and their successors for the future, upon every vacancy of the said priory, should, within <num value="15">fifteen</num> days after the installation of their new prior, pay <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure> English money to the said Bishop and his successors, in the name of a pension, under pain of sequestering the church of Thele, and ecclesiastical censures; and also <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> yearly, at Easter, in the church of Thele, to the poor of the said parish.&rdquo; 
<P>Without any further accession of estate, Elsinge Hospital remained till the reign of Henry VIII. when it shared the fate of other religious houses, and was surrendered to that monarch in the <num value="22">twenty-second</num> year of his reign, its annual value amounting to <num value="193">193</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="15">15</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="5">5</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>

<P>In Dr. Fiddes's Life of Cardinal Wolsey, Appendix, occurs the name of &ldquo;Roger, Prior of Elsing Spittle,&rdquo; who was present at the convocation summoned to discuss the divorce of Henry VIII. from Queen Catharine of Spain. 
<P>Henry VIII. granted the desecrated priory to John Williams, Esq. afterwards Sir John, and Lord Williams of Thame, and Keeper of the King's Jewels; who converted the hospital, with the lodgings of the prior and canons, into a dwelling-house; the chapel yard he transformed into a garden; and the cloisters he reduced to a gallery; while the apartments of the poor blind brethren he converted into stabling for his horses! During his Lordship's residence an accidental fire broke out, on Christmas Eve <datestruct value="1541"><year reg="1541">1541</year></datestruct>, in the gallery, which burnt with such fierceness, that the whole house and other buildings were consumed, and several of the royal jewels embezzled and destroyed. 
<P>Previously to this accident, the chapel of the priory had been appropriated to be the parish-church of St. Alphage, on the following occasion.&mdash;We shall extract the circumstances in the words of Mr. Reading, as inserted in his &ldquo;State of Sion College,&rdquo; at the end of his Catalogue of Sion College Library:

<P>The chapel having been thus appropriated as the parish-church, we continue its history to this period. The adjoining premises, which had been destroyed by fire, having been rebuilt, Margery, daughter of Lord Williams, and wife of Lord Norrys, conveyed the whole estate, after her father's death, to Sir Rowland Hayward, Alderman and Lord Mayor of London in <datestruct value="1570--"><year reg="1570">1570</year></datestruct> and the latter part of <datestruct value="1590--"><year reg="1590">1590</year></datestruct>, for the sum of <num value="700">700</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> Sir John Hayward sold it to Mr. Alderman Robert Parkhurst, reserving a quit-rent, and <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>l. per annum</hi>, left by his father to the poor of St. Alphage for ever.

<P>The structure is of brick and stone, with <num value="2">two</num> fronts; <num value="1">one</num> in Aldermanbury, consisting of a pediment, supported by pillars; between which, in the centre, is a Venetian window, and on each side circular windows, over <num value="2">two</num> false doors.

<P>The only remaining part of Elsinge Spital is the lower division of the steeple of the priory church, which forms <num value="1">one</num> of the plates of this number, and is a very interesting relict of that antient religious foundation. 
<P>It occupies a square of <num value="624">624</num> feet at the western end of the church, and consists of <num value="4">four</num> lofty arches of unequal heights; those on the north and west sides measuring from the area to the top <num value="20">20</num> feet; the <num value="2">two</num> other sides <num value="18">18</num> feet.

The wall above is only <num value="2">2</num> feet; so that there has been evidently a later superstructure&mdash;occasioned, probably, by the fire of London, which had damaged the church steeple as well as Sion College. 
<P>The bells are <num value="2">two</num> in number: a tenor of <num value="12">12</num> cwt. and a sanctus of <num value="3">3</num> cwt. They are supported by an antient oak frame fixed in the old wall, at a short distance from the top; and are ascended to by a small stone staircase, winding up a circular stone tower, at the north-east corner of the steeple. Both staircase and tower are exceedingly decayed. 
<P>We have thus presented to the view of our readers the various transformations of this religious foundation, from a nunnery successively to an hospital and priory, till its dissolution as a monastery by Henry VIII.; and also the account of that portion of it which was allotted to be the parish-church of St. Alphage till the present period. An account of its restoration, both as an ecclesiastical and charitable foundation, very properly occurs. <pb id="p.37" n="37">

<P>AFTER the dissolution of Elsinge Spital, the whole, as before related, was granted to Sir John Williams, Lord Thame, from whom it was inherited by his daughter, Margery, the wife of Lord Norrys, of whom it was purchased by Sir Rowland Hayward, and by his son Sir John sold to Alderman Parkhurst: it remained with the later purchaser till he disposed of it from the following circumstances. 
<P>Dr. Thomas White, son of John White, of Temple parish, in the city of Bristol, having received his university education in Magdalen Hall, in or about <datestruct value="1566--"><year reg="1566">1566</year></datestruct> took the degrees in arts, and became a frequent and popular preacher. Upon his settling in London, he became Rector of St. Gregory's by St. Paul's, and afterwards Vicar of St. Dunstan's, Fleet Street, where he was much esteemed for his piety and practical doctrine. In the year <datestruct value="1584"><year reg="1584">1584</year></datestruct> he was licensed to proceed in divinity, and commenced doctor in that faculty. In <datestruct value="1588--"><year reg="1588">1588</year></datestruct> the prebend of Mora, in St. Paul's cathedral, was conferred on him. In <datestruct value="1590--"><year reg="1590">1590</year></datestruct> he was appointed Treasurer of the cathedral church of Salisbury. In <datestruct value="1591--"><year reg="1591">1591</year></datestruct> he was Canon of Christ-church, Oxon: and in <datestruct value="1593--"><year reg="1593">1593</year></datestruct> he was Canon of Windsor. Having honoured these preferments by a pious, liberal, and strict attention to their several duties, and having spent <num value="72">seventy-two</num> years of his valuable life in exertions of utility towards his fellow-creatures, his soul departed, <datestruct VALUE="1623-03-1"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=1>1</day>, <year reg=1623>1623</year></datestruct>-<num value="4">4</num>, to receive those ineffable rewards promised by his Maker to all such as so well performed the duties he had ordained. His mortal remains were deposited in his own parish-church of St. Dunstan in the West, in which, from some neglect or other, no memorial has been erected to commemorate the virtues of so virtuous, so benevolent a man! 
<P>To evince his regard to learning, and bounty to the poor, in <datestruct value="1621--"><year reg="1621">1621</year></datestruct> he founded a moral philosophy lecture in the University of Oxford, with a stipend of <num value="100">100</num><hi rend=italics>l. per annum</hi> to the reader. He also gave <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> per annum, each, to <num value="5">five</num> poor scholars of Magdalen Hall, as exhibitions; besides <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>l. per annum</hi> to the Principal of that Hall. The whole to be paid out of his manor of Laingdon Hills, in Essex. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1613--"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct> he built an hospital in Temple parish, Bristol, the place of his nativity, and endowed it with the annual sum of <num value="92">92</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>

<P>But his great work was SION COLLEGE, for the foundation of which he directed by his will, dated <datestruct VALUE="1623-10-1"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=1>1</day>, <year reg=1623>1623</year></datestruct>, that <num value="3000">3000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> should be applied in building a college for the use of the London clergy; and for alms-houses for <num value="20">twenty</num> persons, <num value="10">ten</num> men and <num value="10">ten</num> women. For the endowment of this benefaction, Dr. White left <num value="160">160</num><hi rend=italics>l. per annum</hi>; of which the sum of <num value="120">120</num><hi rend=italics>l. per annum</hi> was appropriated to the alms-houses, and the remaining <num value="40">40</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> to the support of the common expenditure of the college; out of which, it was ordered, that the clergy should have quarterly dinners every year, and on those days to have Latin sermons. 
<P>The other memoranda of Dr. White's will breathe the same benevolence as excited him to the foundation of Sion College. Some of the principal of these were: <num value="40">40</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> yearly for ever for a reader, to be appointed by the Lord Mayor and <num value="6">six</num> of the antient Aldermen, to give an afternoon lecture to the poor prisoners at their own church; also <num value="30">30</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> to bury executed felons; <num value="40">40</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> for <num value="3">three</num> lectures during term weekly, in St. Paul's Cathedral; <num value="100">100</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> towards repairing highways; the rent of his house in Fleet Street, for a lecture on Sunday and Thursday afternoons at St. Dunstan's in the West; as well as various benefactions both in London and Bristol.&mdash;He also ordered a gravestone, with a short inscription, &ldquo;about <num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> price,&rdquo; to be made for him in the chancel of St. Dunstan's church, where he and his <num value="1">first</num> and <num value="2">second</num> wives were buried. 
<P>Dr. White, unwilling that any duty should be neglected, or any irregularity suffered throughout his several foundations, among other things in his will, directed that the poor in his alms-houses at Sion College should conform to the following regulations: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><P><num value="1">1</num>. That the alms-folks shall say private prayers every morning and evening, and before and after meals; and that they shall diligently frequent the parish-church all Fridays and Sundays in the year; and if any of them are found to absent themselves from the church for <num value="2">two</num> days together, not being hindered by sickness or other reasonable cause, he or she so offending shall lose twopence out of the quarter's pension, and so <hi rend=italics>toties quoties</hi>, to be equally divided amongst those their fellows who are constant in these duties. 
<P><num value="2">2</num>. That none be chose in these places but single persons, either that were never married, or lawfully became single afterwards, and so to continue during their dwelling there. And that none be chose under the age of <num value="50">fifty</num>; nor any that is known to be, or that hath been, within <num value="1">one</num> quarter of a year before, either a blasphemer of God, or fornicator, or drunkard; whereof if any question shall arise, the certificate of the minister and <num value="1">one</num> of the churchwardens of the parish where the party is an inhabitant, shall suffice to condemn or clear him or her of any such crime. 
<P><num value="3">3</num>. That upon the removal of any of the alms-folks by death or otherwise, none shall be put into the vacant place till <num value="1">one</num> full quarter be expired, always accounting it from <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="4">four</num> usual quarter-days. And so much of the pension as becomes due in that void quarter, shall presently be laid out in repairing the vacant room, if need so require; or upon any of the other rooms that may have more occasion for it: or be kept in stock for reparation from time to time. [But he leaves a power to the governors (if in conscience they shall see cause) to grant such money away to other uses.] 
<P><num value="4">4</num>. That the common gate be locked every evening, from Lady-day until Michaelmas, at <num value="9">nine</num> of the clock at night, or within a quarter of an hour after; and from Michaelmas to Lady-day, at <num value="8">eight</num> of the clock at night, or within a quarter of an hour after. And that if any of the poor shall be forth of their rooms above <num value="2">two</num> nights in <num value="1">one</num> year, without leave of the President, or shall suffer any stranger to lodge with them above <num value="3">three</num> nights in any <num value="1">one</num> year, without like leave, that the party so offending shall receive an admonition, to be entered in the register; and after <num value="3">three</num> admonitions for the same, or other fault deserving it, he or she shall, for the <num value="4">fourth</num> offence, be removed and expelled from the house.</QUOTE> <pb id="p.38" n="38"> 
<P>But the Doctor left it to the London clergy to devise any other necessary laws, as occasions should move them, being not contrary to any of his own constitutions. 
<P>Not having survived, personally to carry his benevolent intentions into effect, Dr. White left the execution of his liberal and charitable purposes to the Rev. Mr. John Simpson, Rector of St. Olave's, Hart Street, who not only undertook and completed the important trust reposed in him, but at his own cost added a spacious library, <num value="120">120</num> feet long by <num value="25">25</num> feet broad; and erected a convenient building at the south side of the garden for the residence of the governors, the expense altogether amounting to the sum of <num value="2000">2000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>

<P>Mr. Simpson and Mr. Keelynge, Dr. White's executors, purchased the site of Elsinge Spital of Mr. Alderman Parkhurst for <num value="2450">2450</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> and on it erected SION COLLEGE. The collegians were incorporated by King Charles I. by the name of THE PRESIDENT AND FELLOWS OF THE COLLEGE OF SION, WITHIN THE CITY OF LONDON. The various charters of incorportion are dated <datestruct VALUE="-07-3"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=3>3</day></datestruct>, the <num value="6">6th</num> of Charles I. and <datestruct VALUE="-06-20"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=20>20</day></datestruct>, the <num value="16">16th</num> of Charles II. By the charter the Bishop of London was appointed visitor; and the corporation to consist of a president, <num value="2">two</num> deans, and <num value="4">four</num> assistants (to be chosen on Tuesday <num value="3">three</num> weeks after Easter, yearly), and all the rectors, vicars, licensed lecturers, and curates, within the city of London, and the suburbs thereof; and the president, deans, and assistants, were appointed governors and rectors of the alms-houses and alms-people, and to elect proper objects. A common seal was fixed on by the corporation in <datestruct value="1632--"><year reg="1632">1632</year></datestruct>, on which was insculped the Good Samaritan, with this inscription: <hi rend=italics>Vade et fac similiter</hi>; and round it, <hi rend=italics>Sigillum Collegii de Sion, Londini.</hi>

<P>The Library, of the exterior of which a view (comprehending the principal entrance into the College, and the Almshouses) is given, contains a most valuable collection of books in all sciences and languages, the gifts of various benefactors. In this collection were comprehended many of the books brought from the old cathedral of St. Paul, in <datestruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></datestruct>. In the year <datestruct value="1666"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct> the College shared in the common distress occasioned by the fire of London, which destroyed a <num value="3">third</num> part of the books, the alms-houses, many of the chambers for the use of students, the several rooms appropriated for the meetings of the governors and fellows, and the apartments appointed for the residence of the librarian. 
<P>The whole edifice was afterwards rebuilt in a plain manner, with brick-work: and, from several repairs and improvements, has arrived at the state in which it is represented in this work. 
<P>The library has been considerably improved since the rebuilding of the fabric. In <datestruct value="1679--"><year reg="1679">1679</year></datestruct> part of the Jesuits' books, seized in that year, was deposited here. The Earl of Berkeley gave half of the books which had belonged to his Lordship's uncle, Sir Robert Cooke. And the Act of Parliament passed in the reign of Queen Anne, by which booksellers are obliged to give to this library, as well as to the universities, &amp;c. a copy of every work, to secure their own copy-right and property, has been of great advantage to this valuable collection; and by a late Act for security of copy-right, it is entitled to a copy of every new publication; added to which, it has been for some time a custom for every incumbent, on taking possession of his living in the city and suburbs, to present a book, or books to this library, of at least the value of <num value="1">one</num> guinea, or so much in money. 
<P>The care and preservation of this treasure of literature are committed to <num value="1">one</num> librarian. The present gentleman who holds this office, as well as that of Secretary of the College, is the Rev. Robert Watts, M.A. Rector of St. Alphage's, who has a commodious residence on the east side of the College. 
<P>The College is in possession of the following pictures: 
<P>A curious piece of antiquity, bearing on <num value="1">one</num> side the image of the Deity, with the following Saxon inscription: 
<FIGURE id="Fig.038" n=""><HEAD>ZZZ</HEAD></FIGURE>. On the other side, the decollation of John the Baptist: &ldquo;probably,&rdquo; says Mr. Malcolm, &ldquo;the painting of an altar belonging to the old priory.&rdquo; 
<P>Charles I.; a very melancholy countenance. By Van Bleek, after Van Dyck.<NOTE N="*"><P>The copy was made for Mr. Henry Clements, a bookseller in St. Paul's Churchyard, an intimate acquaintance of Van Bleek's; and the picture was bequeathed to the Library by the Rev. Wm. Clements, the Library-Keeper, son of Mr. Henry Clements.</NOTE>

<P>On the east side of Smithfield, and also of Duke Street (formerly Duc Lane, and Duck Lane) stood the ancient Priory of St. Bartholomew, founded by Rahere, a pleasant witty gentleman, and therefore in his time called the King's Jester, or Minstrel, about or rather after the year <datestruct value="1102"><year reg="1102">1102</year></datestruct>, the <num value="2">second</num> of Henry I, for Canons of the Order of St. Augustin; himself became their <num value="1">first</num> prior, in <datestruct value="1123--"><year reg="1123">1123</year></datestruct>, and so continued to his death, in <datestruct value="1144--"><year reg="1144">1144</year></datestruct>. 
<P>This Rahere having spent his youth in noblemen's houses and the king's palace, by his facetious behaviour and manners, became familiar as well with his prince as with the nobility at court. At length, repenting of the follies and vanities of his younger years, and wishing to attain a full remission of all his sins, he went to Rome, where he heartily bewailed his former course of life, and promised amendment for the future; but, while he remained there, falling very sick, and thinking he should die, he made a solemn vow to build a hospital for the poor, if it should please God to restore him to his health. 
<P>Having recovered, he returned homeward, in order to perform his vow; and, as he was on his journey, being <num value="1">one</num> night asleep, he seemed to be carried by a monstrous creature, that had <num value="4">four</num> feet and <num value="2">two</num> wings, and placed on a very high precipice, where, just under him, he saw a horrible pit, which had no bottom: he (conscious of his ill life) imagining himself just falling into it, in a great horror cried out; upon which there appeared to him a man, with majesty in his countenance and of wonderful beauty, who asked him what he would give to be delivered out of so great danger of death; and he answered, that he would give all that ever he could; the man then told him, that he was Bartholomew, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, and came to succour him in his distress, and to discover the secrets of a heavenly mystery to him. &ldquo;Know, then,&rdquo; said St. Bartholomew, &ldquo;that by the will and command of the highest Trinity, and the favour and counsel of the Celestial Court, I have chosen a place at Smithfield, in the suburbs of London, where thou shalt build a church to my name;&rdquo; and, after having told him how propitious God would be to those faithful people who should offer up their prayers in his temple, encouraged him to go on with the work, not troubling himself about the cost, and with a promise that he should be the lord and patron of it, he vanished. 
<P>Rahere awaked, and was in great doubt with himself, whether he should take this for a fantastic illusion, or a heavenly oracle; but at last, after some dispute within himself, inclined to the latter, and resolved to obey it as a command from Heaven. Home he came, and was joyfully received by his friends and acquaintances, to whom he discovered his vision and his design thereupon, and consulted with them how to go about so great a work; when they (some of them being citizens of London) informing him that he must <num value="1">first</num> get the king's license; and the rather, because the ground, whereon he was by St. Bartholomew appointed to build, was the king's: he thereupon applied himself to the court; and, by the assistance of Richard, Bishop of London, obtained both the king's title to the ground and his permission to build what he intended thereupon. 
<P>Having thus far succeeded, he set himself heartily to work to clear the ground (which for the most part was moorish and full of water and mud, and on what was dry of it, was the common place of execution) and to get stones and other materials ready for his building. To aid this, he feigned himself an idiot or fool (concealing what his design was), and by playing the changeling, got a great company of rabble about him; whom, by his own example, he daily employed to clear the ground, and bring stones and other necessaries to this place; till, at last, having gotten what he thought requisite, he discovered what were his intentions. In performance of his vow, he <num value="1">first</num> built the hospital, in <datestruct value="1102--"><year reg="1102">1102</year></datestruct>; and after, in obedience to the heavenly vision, the church and priory, which he finished in <datestruct value="1123--"><year reg="1123">1123</year></datestruct>, both in memory of St. Bartholomew, and had the church consecrated by Richard de Belmies, Bishop of London. 
<P>Rahere, having thus finished this Priory of St. Bartholomew, placed therein Canons Regular of the Order of St. Augustin, and became the <num value="1">first</num> prior thereof himself. Here, after he had continued prior near <num value="22">twenty-two</num> years, he died, and his body was buried on the north side of the chancel of this his own church, over which a fair monument was erected; it was afterward renewed by William Bolton, the last prior but <num value="1">one</num> of this house, and remains very fresh to the present time. His effigy lies at length, in his monastical habit, having a monk kneeling on each side of it, with a Bible in their hands, open at the <num value="51">51st</num> chapter of Isaiah, and an angel standing at his feet, with a coronet and an emblazoned shield; underneath, on the edge of the slab, is the following inscription, <hi rend=italics>Hic jacet Raherus primus Canonicus et primus Prior istius Ecclesi&aelig;;</hi> and below this are <num value="4">four</num> armorial bearings. 
<P>These Canons Regular, otherwise called Black Canons, of the Order of St. Austin, pretended their founder to be Saint Augustin of Hippo, who, say they, erected a monastery of clerks and priests, with whom he himself lived and conversed, and gave them a rule how they should live with propriety, and that they should promise the <num value="3">three</num> ordinary vows of religious men. These were the Canons of the Order of St. Augustin; but, in process of time, growing dissolute, and far diverting from the rule of St. Augustin and their old constitution, another sort of Canons did succeed in their places; and, by more nearly following the prescript of the rule, were called the Regular Canons, who were not eminent till the <num value="10">10th</num> century, and not in England till after the Conquest. 
<P>Rahere having, it seems, contracted many enemies, who confederated against him to take away his life; upon discovery thereof to him, by <num value="1">one</num> of the confederacy, addressed himself to king Henry I., who took him under his protection; and in order thereto, granted him the following charter. 
<TEXT><BODY><HEAD>Charter of King Henry I., Anno <datestruct value="1133"><year reg="1133">1133</year></datestruct>, and <num value="33">33rd</num> of his Reign, concerning divers Liberties and Privileges to the Church of St. Bartholomew, London&mdash;to Rahere Prior and Canons Regular&mdash;and to the Poor of the Hospital of the same Church.</HEAD>

<P>In the name of the holy and undivided Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. I Henry, King of England, to William, Archbishop of Canterbury, and George, Bishop of London, and to all bishops, and abbots, and earls, justiciary barons, sheriffs, and ministers, and to all men, and their lieges, and to the citizens of London, greeting. 
<P>Know ye, that I have granted, and by this my charter confirmed, to the church of St. Bartholomew, London, and to Rahere the Prior, and Canons Regular, in the same church serving God, and to the poor of the hospital of the same church, that they be free from all earthly servitude and earthly power and subjection, except episcopal customs, to wit, only consecration of the church, baptism, and ordination of clerks; and that as any church in all England is free, so this church be free, and all the lands to it appertaining, which it now has, or which Rahere the Prior, or the Canons, may be able reasonably to acquire, whether by purchase or by gift, and have soccage and saccage, and thol and theme, and infogheneteof; and all liberties and free customs and acquittances in all things which belong to the same church, in wood and in plain, in meadow and pastures, in water and mills, in ways and paths, in pools and parks, in moors and fisheries, in granges and shrubberies, within and without, and in all places now and for ever. 
<P>And this church, with all things that appertain unto the same, know ye that I will to maintain and defend, and to be free as my crown, and to have taken in my hand in defence against all men. Wherefore I grant to Rahere, and to the same church, in all its own rights and possession, the breach of peace and skirmish made in the house, and the invasion of house or court, and all forfeitures in its own jurisdiction made, and forestall and flemenefermden, in the way and without, in the fend and without, in the city and without: also, that it may have discussions of causes and the rights of causes concerning all plea which may happen in their land, and all customs, whether in ecclesiasticals or seculars, as fully and freely as I should have of my own domain and table. I release also and acquit Rahere the prior, and the aforesaid church and all belonging to the same, of shire and <num value="100">hundred</num> <pb id="p.40" n="40"> of pleas, and plaints and murders, and scutage, and gold and Danegelds, and hydages, and sarts and assizes, and castle works, or the rebuilding of castles and bridges, of enclosing parks, of removing woods or other things, of fordwit and hengwit, of ward-penny and ave-penny, and bloodwite, and fightwite, and childwite, of <num value="100">hundred</num>-penny, and thring-penny, and manbratre, and mischinige, and schewinge, and frithsoke, and westgeiltheof, of warden and outlawry, and forefenge, and whitfonge; and they be quit in all my land of the tollage and passage, and pontage, and lastage, and stallage, and of all secular service in land and in water, and ports of the sea, so that they be loaded with no burdens of expedition, or occasions or aids of sheriffs or reeves of the <num value="100">hundred</num>, or pontifical ministers. I prohibit also by my authority royal, that no men, whether my minister or any other in my whole land, be troublesome to Rahere the prior, or the aforesaid church, concerning any thing which belongs thereto; and that no man, of the clergy or laity, presume to usurp dominion of that place, or introduce himself without the consent of the prior or brethren. 
<P>I confirm also all privileges and donations and charters, both which it has or is about to have, from kings, from popes, or other faithful persons whatsoever. And whatsoever shall be remembered and proved to have been justly granted and acquired by the same church, by writing or by the testimonies of good men, that no person presume, upon any pretence, claim, judgment, or power, to take or disperse the same. 
<P>But after the death of Rahere the prior, out of the same congregation let be chosen he who be worthy; but let no <num value="1">one</num> be chosen elsewhere by the exaction of the popes or princes, unless on account of manifest crimes no <num value="1">one</num> can be found worthy of such office, which if it should happen, which God forbid! let them have the power of choosing a prior from some other known and familiar place. But the possessions which have been there given, or purchased by any persons, whether separated from the church by the consent of the chapter, or reduced to a small service, may be recalled by our royal privilege and authority, and that place perpetually defended by the protection of kings. And let the prior himself, serving the king alone, abundantly cherish, with spiritual and temporal food, the flock committed to him. 
<P>I grant also my firm peace to all persons coming to and returning from the fair, which is wont to be celebrated in that place at the feast of Saint Bartholomew; and I forbid any <num value="1">one</num> of the royal servants to send to implead any of their persons, them in the plea, or without the consent of the comers on those <num value="3">three</num> days, to wit, the eve of the feast, the feast itself, and the day following. 
<P>And let all the people of the whole kingdom know, that I will maintain and defend this church, even as my crown; and if any <num value="1">one</num> shall presume in any thing to contradict this our royal privilege, or shall offend the prior, the canons, the clergy, or laity of that place, he, and all and every thing that belongs to him, shall come into the king's power. 
<P>And all these things I have granted to the said church for ever, for the love of God and the salvation of myself and my heirs, and for the souls of my predecessors. Therefore I adjure all my heirs and successors, in the name of the Holy Trinity, that they maintain and defend this sacred place by royal authority, and that they grant and confirm the liberties by me granted to it. 
<P>And the witnesses of this my grant are Henry, Bishop of Winchester; Roger, Bishop of Salisbury; Bernard, Bishop of St. David's; Geoffry, Chancellor; Stephen, Earl of Morton; William of Icalbent Brito; Albenic Aubrey of Vere; Richard of Basset: Milo de Gloucester: Pain Fitz John; Robert de Courcy; Hugh Bigot, and many other barons of my kingdom. 
<P>And this charter I have made and ordered to be confirmed at Westminster, in the year of our Lord <datestruct value="1133--"><year reg="1133">1133</year></datestruct>, and in the <num value="33">33rd</num> year of my reign.</TEXT>

<P>Though the hospital and priory of Saint Bartholomew were indebted to Rahere for their foundation, and the chartered privileges granted by Henry I., yet it by no means appears certain this was the <num value="1">first</num> religious building erected on the site; for it is highly probable there was a church or some monastic building here, long prior to the Norman Conquest, and that too of Saxon origin. For in the legend notice is made, that Rahere was informed by his friends that he must get the king's license, because the ground, whereon he was appointed to build the church, was the king's. He afterward did obtain both the king's title to the ground and his license to build thereupon. Other reasons for supposing that the church here, or the chancel-part of it, might be built by the Saxons, are these: the Saxons generally made their churches with descents into them; and it is observable that all the entrances into this church are by descents of several steps; whereas the Normans built their churches with ascents. The Saxons made their lights and roofs small and mean; the Normans, on the contrary, made theirs high and large. The few churches that the Saxons <num value="1">first</num> had of stone were low, with thick walls, and consequently dark and damp; those of the Normans were far more stately, lightsome, and pleasant. And the late Mr. Carter, who drew, engraved, and published specimens of ancient architecture, was decidedly of opinion, from drawings he had taken in this church, of capitals, ornaments, tiers of columns, and arches, that the workmanship was Saxon, and long prior to the arrival of the Normans. 
<P>This priory possessed every conveniency possible for the solace and comfort of its inmates, as will evidently appear by a reference to the general ground-plan of the church, cloisters, &amp;c., which, however, could have formed only a part of the vast space of ground it originally occupied, and was appropriated to its use. Independent of its conventual church, refectory, hall, cloisters, and numerous offices, it had extensive gardens to the north and east of the priory, and among them the luxury of a mulberry-garden: indeed, the religious orders of almost every description, from the knight templar to the bare footed friar, at every time and in every age, have been celebrated for taking special care of self. Holingshed has recorded the excellency of the strawberries cultivated in the garden of Ely House, Holborn, by Bishop Morton. He informs us &ldquo;that Richard, Duke of Gloucester (afterward Richard III.) at the council held in the Tower, on the morning he put Lord Hastings to death, requested a dish of them from the Bishop.&rdquo; Shakspeare has thus introduced the circumstance in his historical play of &ldquo;Richard the <num value="3">Third</num>,&rdquo; where Gloucester, addressing himself to Morton, says, &ldquo;My lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn, I saw good strawberries in your garden there; I do beseech you send for some of them.&rdquo; 
<P>This priory falling to decay, was new built in <datestruct value="1410--"><year reg="1410">1410</year></datestruct> (as Stowe says), and the priory church, with the parish church adjoining, and the offices and lodgings belonging to the priory, were afterward repaired by William Bolton, who was the last prior of this house that did any thing toward its improvement. He was a great builder here, and likewise new built the manor house of Canonbury, now called Cambury, at Islington, which belonged to the canons of this house, and is situate on a rising ground, somewhat north from the parish church there. And his device, which is a bolt through a ton, remains to the present time in several places of the garden wall there, and also in the priory church, and in several old houses within St. Bartholomew Close. 
<P>On the south side of this church, the east part of this beautiful cloister, consisting of <num value="8">eight</num> arches, is still remaining; but at this day reduced to the mean office of a stable: here are many curious devices and historical subjects carved in the stone-work of these arches, which would be worth preserving by having drawings taken of them. 
<P>On the dissolution of the monasteries and other religious houses, the minions, favourites, and courtiers of the rapacious Henry, came in for a liberal share of the Holy Plunder! The priory of St. Bartholomew fell to the lot of the attorney general, Richard Riche, who so infamously, by treachery, betrayed the confidence of Bishop Fisher, which he had obtained under the mask of consulting with him for his benefit, but which basely betraying, brought this learned and devout prelate to the block. 
<P>The parochial church was an old church, and stood next adjoining to the priory church, which priory church having <num value="6">six</num> tunable bells in the tower, they were sold to the parish of St. Sepulchre, and then the church being pulled down to the choir, the choir was annexed for the enlarging of the said old parish church thereunto adjoining, and so was used till the reign of Queen Mary, who gave the remnant of the priory church to the Friars Preachers, or Black Friars, which was used by them as their conventual church till the <num value="1">first</num> year of Queen Eliz&agrave;beth; when those friars were turned out, and all the said church, with the old parish church, was, wholly as it stood in the last year of Edward VI, given by Parliament to remain for ever a parish church to the inhabitants within the Close called Great Bartholomew's: since which time the parish church was pulled down, except the steeple of rotten timber, ready to fall of itself; this steeple was entirely taken down in <datestruct value="1628--"><year reg="1628">1628</year></datestruct>, and a new <num value="1">one</num> built of brick and stone, very fairly finished, which now serves as an entrance to the choir of the ancient priory, the present parish church. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1636--"><year reg="1636">1636</year></datestruct> there was no return made of the profits of this church; but, in <datestruct value="1693--"><year reg="1693">1693</year></datestruct>, the rector and church-wardens presented, that they had no parsonage-house, nor ever had.

<P>Bartholomew Fair was originally held in the Close only, but during a long period principally in West Smithfield. For many years past it has commenced on the <datestruct VALUE="-09-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct> at noon, when the Lord Mayor attends on the east side of Smithfield, opposite the entrance into Cloth Fair, and the following proclamation is made: 
<P>O yes! O yes! O yes!&mdash;All manner of persons may take notice, that in the Close of St. Bartholomew the Great, and West Smithfield, London, and the lands and places adjoining, is now to be held a fair for this day and the <num value="2">two</num> days following, to which all persons may freely resort to buy and sell, according to the liberties and privileges of the said fair, and may depart without disturbance, paying their duties. And all persons are strictly charged and commanded, in his Majesty's name, to keep the peace, and do nothing in disturbance of the said fair, as they will answer the contrary at their perils; and that there be no manner of arrest or arrests, but by such officers as are appointed. And if any persons be aggrieved, let them repair to the Court of Pie-powder, where they may have speedy relief, according to justice and equity. God save the king! and the lord of the manor! 
<P>The boundaries of the parish of St. Bartholomew the Great are those of the Priory, within whose precincts it was and is still situate, and are as follows: 
<P>The north wall ran from Smithfield, along the south side of Long Lane, to its junction with the east wall, about <num value="30">thirty</num> yards west from Aldersgate Street. It is mentioned by Stowe, and delineated in Aggas' plan, who represents a small gate or postern in it, about the half-way; it is the present entrance to King Street, Cloth Fair, and apposite Charterhouse Street. 
<P>The west wall commenced at the south-west corner of Long Lane, and continued along Smithfield and the middle of Duc Lane to the South Gate, or Great Gate-house, where is now the entrance to Bartholomew Close. This side of the monastery Close appears to have been early occupied by houses, as well as the side toward Aldersgate Street; as, in the grant from Henry VIII. to Sir Richard Riche, <num value="51">fifty-one</num> messuages or tenements are enumerated; whereof <num value="9">nine</num> were situate in the Church Row, <num value="2">two</num> at and over the South Gate, <num value="11">eleven</num> in the place called Paradise, <num value="4">four</num> in Petty Wales, and <num value="25">twenty-five</num> in other places: all lying within the precincts of the Great Close and belonging to the said priory. Mention is likewise made in the said grant of <num value="5">five</num> messuages or tenements with <num value="2">two</num> stables, situate in West Smithfield, in the row between Long Lane on the north and the west gate of St. Bartholomew on the south, and abutting upon the void ground of the priory of St. Bartholomew, within the said close, towards the east. Beyond this west gate, southward, were other houses enclosing the Great Close of the monastery, thus described in Sir Richard Riche's grant to the rector, John Deane: &ldquo;All that my messuage or tenement with the appurtenances, now in the tenure or occupation of Richard Tyrrell, gentleman; all that my messuage or tenement, &amp;c., late in the tenure of Richard Mody, Esq., and now in the tenure and occupation of William Barker; all that my chamber and edifice now in the tenure of Johanna Martyn, widow, situate over the South Gate of the Close of St. Bartholomew; and all that my messuage and tenement, and my chamber, with the appurtenances, now in the tenure and occupation of John Usher, situate near the South Gate of the Close of St. Bartholomew; which said messuages and tenements and other premises are situate, lying, and being together within the Close commonly called Greate Seynt Bartylmewes Close, in West Smythfield, in the suburbs of London, and did lately belong and appertain to the late monastery or priory of St. Bartholomew, &amp;c. And also all that my messuage and tenement, &amp;c., now in the tenure and occupation of Matthew White, gentleman, situate and being within the aforesaid Close, &amp;c., to wit, between the messuage or tenement in the possession of John William Taylor, on the north part, and the messuage or tenement lately devised to John Higham, and now in the tenure and occupation of Hugh ap Harry, Gent., on the south part, and abutting west upon Duc Lane.&rdquo; 
<P>The before-mentioned houses still belong to the rector, and stand in Duke Street, formerly called Duc Lane, their east ends fronting the monastery Close: they were all, probably, rebuilt soon after the grant, as, at the end of the last century, the date <datestruct value="1591"><year reg="1591">1591</year></datestruct> was to be seen on some; but now they are all quite modern. The house above noticed, as situate near the South Gate, probably stood on the site of that which is now the corner house of the south-west boundary, the wall turning up the adjoining court, called Great Montagu Court. 
<P>The south wall, commencing from the west boundary at the South Gate, ran east in a direct line about half way to Aldersgate Street, where it formed an angle and passed to the south about <num value="40">forty</num> yards, then resumed its east direction and joined the south end of the east boundary. There does not appear ever to have been any entrance through this wall into the precincts of the Close. The ground enclosed between the turnings of this wall and the east boundary is now covered with modern houses, except some old premises on the west side, and named Albion Buildings. 
<P>The east wall ran parallel with Aldersgate Street, at the distance of about <num value="26">twenty-six</num> yards, and was fronted for the most part by houses in that street, some of them large and magnificent, particularly London House, between which and the wall was a ditch. On the demolition of this wall, various encroachments took place, which has caused several disputes about the parish boundaries, as St Bartholomew's parish is privileged, and considered as an encroachment on the city liberties. The city has at different times litigated the question, particularly in <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>. 
<P>The view of part of the Choir with the remains of the South Transept, the ruins of which form the boundary of the present Green Churchyard, is, as the print represents, without a roof; and though, by the accumulation of ruins and earth to form the burying-ground, it is raised to an ascent from the church pavement, of <num value="6">six</num> steps; in its original state, when connected with the church as part of the building, was of course level with the same. Of the ornamental pillars that supported the Gothic arches of the transept, <num value="1">one</num> only remains, and that is daily expected to fall, through decay and exposure to the weather. These pillars formed a screen to the passage over the aisles, from <num value="1">one</num> arch to another, throughout the edifice. 
<P>The interior view, on the north side, shows part of the Gothic carved-work pulpit; and the very beautiful and high-finished stone-worked screen of Rahere's monument. The east end of the chancel is wholly occupied by the altar-piece, a very spacious piece of perspective architecture, painted of stone colour, representing <num value="4">four</num> columns and <num value="2">two</num> pilasters, with their entablement of the Doric order. The inter-columns contain the Commandments, and lower are the Lord's Prayer and Creed, all done in gold letters on black; and over the Commandments, under an arching pediment, is a glory, with the word Jehovah in Hebrew characters. 
<P>On the south side are delineated the sumptuous monument of Sir Walter Mildmay, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and his lady, together with that of James Rivers, Esq. &amp;c. The ancient wooden roof, embrowned by age, forms a striking relief to the more ornamented display of the interior, and helps to furnish a pleasing and picturesque effect to the whole. 
<P>On the south wall of the chancel, where a projection is shown in the print, was the front of the closet or pew for the prior, which extended backward over the south aisle; and, when repaired and beautified by William Bolton, the circumstance was commemorated by the rebus on his name, a bolt and ton, being placed in raised characters on the front, which remains perfect to the present time. In the same way is preserved the repair and ornamenting of Westminster Abbey by Islip, <num value="1">one</num> of the early abbots, whose rebus (an eye and the slip of a tree, on painted glass) is still to be seen in the windows of that edifice. 
<P>The buildings over both the aisles of this church have long been appropriated and used for charity schools. The Protestants Dissenters Charity School is over the south aisle; it is wainscotted round with small oaken panels, of the period of Elizabeth, or James the <num value="1">First</num>: there are attached to it spacious apartments, which afford a convenient dwelling for the master. The Parochial Charity School is over the north aisle, and similar to that on the opposite side in every respect. 
<P>The adjoining Chapel of St. Bartholomew is of equal antiquity with the priory. In a corner of this chapel, some years ago, there was to be seen a very antique sculpture, repesenting the figure of a priest with a child in his arms. Some mutilated fragments of ornamental sculpture are <pb id="p.42" n="42"> still remaining, but so dilapidated, that no trace is left of what they originally consisted. Underneath appear severa, vestiges of an antique chapel, though now in use only as a common cellar. The chapel is at present neatly pewed, and has a very commodious gallery; also vestry-rooms at the back of the north wall, from <num value="1">one</num> of which a small window looks into the Green Churchyard, fronting the door of the south entrance to the church. 
<P>This chapel, for upward of a century, served as a meeting-house for Presbyterian Dissenters; but at what time it was converted into a meeting house by the Nonconformists is uncertain, though it must have been pretty early. It is not improbable but that during the interregnum it was occupied by <num value="1">one</num> of the numerous sects that abounded at that period. During the persecuting reign of Charles the <num value="2">Second</num>, it was certainly in their hands; and, on account of the obscurity of its situation, was admirably adapted for purposes of concealment. In several parts of the building there is every appearance of private doors, supposed to have been made to facilitate the escape of these sectaries when in danger of being apprehended. <pb id="p.43" n="43">

The boundaries of those precincts commenced at Pye-corner, or the northern end of Giltspur-street, and extended easterly to Duck-Lane, or Duke-Street, including all the western side of it to the Blue Anchor Inn, nearly opposite the entrance to Bartholomew Close, to the Angel, and from the Angel, southward. From the corner of Duck-Lane the limits passed on the north sde of Little-Britain westward to King-Street, excepting <num value="4">four</num> houses westward of the Blue Anchor Inn; and from the south side of Little-Britain they extended from King-Street eastward <num value="3">three</num> houses beyond Peterborough-Court: taking in also King-Street, Long-Walk, and Well Yard; with <num value="10">ten</num> houses on the south, and <num value="14">fourteen</num> on the north, sides of Windmill Court, and all other Courts in this compass.<NOTE N="b"><P><hi rend=italics>New View of London</hi>, by Edward Hatton, Lond. <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>. <num value="8">8</num>vo.

<P>The edifice of the Church of St. Bartholomew the Less, is situated on the north side of a passage called the Cloisters, leading from the south-east side of West Smithfield into the Court of Saint Bartholomew's Hospital; as represented in the lower part of the annexed Plate. At the western end is a square tower having <num value="1">one</num> gothic window on the south, <num value="2">two</num> others on the west, and a small turret at the south-western corner. The principal entry to the Church is in the passage out of Smithfield, and above it is a large window with armorial ensigns and the inscription Mr. Henrie Andrewes, Alderman, <datestruct value="1636--"><year reg="1636">1636</year></datestruct>. As this building stood considerably beyond the northern extremity of the Great Fire, on the south side of it are some old windows parted by mullions, now filled up, and also some ancient sculptures of the armorial ensigns of Edward the Confessor, impaling those of England, under an imperial crown; with angels supporting blank shields and scrolls. On the north side of the Hospital, and south of the Church, is a fair court, having the Vicar's large and handsome house at the eastern end; in which might formerly be seen part of the ancient walls of the Church, appearing over those erected around them by Dance about <num value="30">thirty</num> years since.<NOTE N="f"><P>A view of the exterior of this Church before the alteration, is contained in Maitland's <hi rend=italics>History of London</hi>, vol. ii. p. <datestruct value="1070--"><year reg="1070">1070</year></datestruct>. In the Plan of London executed by Radulphus Aggas, about <datestruct value="1562--"><year reg="1562">1562</year></datestruct>, it is represented as having a square tower embattled, at the north end of the body, which has a pointed roof and <num value="3">three</num> arched windows, with an entrance at
the eastern extremity.</NOTE> The whole of the remaining fabric of the Church, which was built of rough brick and boulder-stones, has been long covered with plaster on the exterior,<NOTE N="g"><P>This Church, says Hatton, in <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, is old, and of the gothic order, built of brick and boulder, rendered over with finishing. <hi rend=italics>New View of London</hi>, vol. ii. p. <num value="146">146</num>.

<P>The upper part of the annexed Engraving represents the Interior of the Church looking to the altar-table in the east, between the pulpit and reading-desk. According to the modern alteration this part of the edifice is octangular, enclosed by square outward <pb id="p.44" n="44"> walls; the angles of the inside being divided by tall clustered gothic columns of wood, meeting in intersected arches in the roof. On the western side is a small organ, and the Church is lighted by broad triangular-shaped windows containing several shields of arms, formed in the points of the arches at the top. There is also an elegant bay-window on the north of the edifice filled with armorial ensigns. Hatton states, that the Church had been &ldquo;handsomely new-pewed with oak,&rdquo; in <datestruct value="1703--"><year reg="1703">1703</year></datestruct>; and that a spacious doorcase had been added at the western end, adorned with Ionic columns and cherubim.

<P>Crosby Hall stands in a court on the east side of Bishopsgate Street, leading into Crosby Square, through where there is a thoroughfare leading to St. Mary Axe through St. Helen's, as represented in the centre Vignette over the plan and views of the vaults of Crosby Hall. This celebrated mansion was built by Sir John Crosby, an eminent citizen and alderman of London, in the time of King Edward the <num value="4">Fourth</num>: Sir John was also Mayor of the Staple at Calais; represented the city of London in <num value="2">two</num> Parliaments, and was twice warden of the Grocers' Company. Crosby Hall formed but a small portion of the magnificent structure of Crosby Place, by which appellation it was generally known. In its original splendour it must have appeared more like a stately palace, than the town residence of a wealthy British merchant. The principal remains consist of <num value="3">three</num> apartments, viz. the hall, the councilroom, and an ante-room, forming <num value="2">two</num> sides of a quadrangle. The hall has on the east side <num value="8">eight</num> beautiful flat-pointed windows, and on the west side, <num value="6">six</num>, with another handsome octangular bowed window, whose finely executed roof is made of stone from Caen in Normandy; the hall ceiling is a flat-pointed arch, with <num value="3">three</num> longitudinal and <num value="9">nine</num> transverse beams, highly ornamented, and whose intersections form <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> small flat-pointed arches, with the same number of conical drops, of which the centre <num value="1">one</num> is far superior to the rest, but all most exquisitely wrought: the intermediate spaces are simply filled in with stiles and Gothic mouldings on the edges&mdash;the whole is oak timber; there is a chimney in good preservation, <num value="10">ten</num> feet <num value="6">six</num> inches wide, and <num value="7">seven</num> feet high. This noble room is of stone, <num value="54">fifty-four</num> feet in length, <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> feet in width, and <num value="40">forty</num> feet in height; the floor was originally paved with stone, chequerways, but is now almost defaced. The council-room has a very rich flat-pointed arched ceiling entirely of oak timber, composed of <num value="6">six</num> transverse beams, or principal rafters, highly ornamented with enriched half circles; in the compartments are square sunk pannels, filled in with quatre-foils, making a pleasing contrast between this room and the hall; it measures <num value="40">forty</num> feet in length and <num value="22">twenty-two</num> in width. Originally there were <num value="2">two</num> small, and <num value="2">two</num> larger windows of the same description as those in the hall, but they are at present blocked up; opposite is a very large fireplace, also a small doorway, leading to the ante-room, but in the latter there is nothing worthy of remark, being so much modernised as to leave no trace of its former state. There are some small tiles extremely hard glazed and ornamented with different figures; these appear to have been used for paving other rooms or passages. In noticing this building Strype says, 
<CIT><QUOTE><TEXT><BODY><HEAD>Crosby Place.</HEAD>

<P>Crosby Place, so called because built by Sir John Crosby, grocer and woolman, in place of certain tenements, with their appurtenances, letten to him by Alice Ashfeld, Prioress of St. Helen's; and the covenant for ninty-<num value="9">nine</num> years, from the year <datestruct value="1466"><year reg="1466">1466</year></datestruct> unto the year <datestruct value="1565"><year reg="1565">1565</year></datestruct>, for the annual rent of <num value="11">11</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>s</hi> <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> This house he builded of stone and timber, very large and beautiful, and the highest at that time in London. He was <num value="1">one</num> of the Sheriffs and an Alderman in the year <datestruct value="1470"><year reg="1470">1470</year></datestruct>; knighted by Edward IV. in the year <datestruct value="1471"><year reg="1471">1471</year></datestruct>, and deceased in the year <datestruct value="1475"><year reg="1475">1475</year></datestruct>&mdash;so short a time enjoyed he his large and sumptuous building. What the contents and particulars of the demises granted to Crosby by the Prioress were, may be understood by the grant of Crosby Place and the appurtenances, made by King Henry VIII. to Anthony Bonvixi, the Italian merchant&mdash;Rex omnibus, &amp;c. cum Alice Ashfeld, &amp;c. wherein are mentioned, <num value="1">first</num>, the great messuage or tenement, now commonly called Crosby Place, with a certain venell, i. e. lane or passage, that extended in length from the east end of a certain little lane north, bending unto the Priory Close; also <num value="9">nine</num> messuages, situate and lying in the said parish of St. Helen's whereof <num value="6">six</num> were situate and lying between the front of the bell-house or steeple of the said church; and another messuage of the said <num value="9">nine</num> messuages, which Catherine Catesby, widow, formerly held, situate within the gate and the steeple aforesaid, and the <num value="6">six</num> messuages mentioned before; together with a certain void place of land situate in the said parish, extending in length towards the east by the said messuage which the said Catherine Catesby formerly held, from the outward part of the plat, or post of the bell-house, abutting upon the north part of the said <num value="6">six</num> messuages, and the King's Street, unto the churchyard there, <num value="5">five</num> feet and a half assize; and thence extending in breadth towards the south, directly unto a certain tenement there, formerly in the tenure of Robert Smith: and <num value="2">two</num> messuages more of the said <num value="9">nine</num> messuages jointly, situate within the close of the said Priory. Of which <num value="1">one</num> heretofore was in the tenure of the said John Crosby, by the demise of Alice Woodhouse, late Prioress, and the other heretofore in the tenure of the said Robert Smith; and these were the tenements and appurtenances held of the Priory of St Helen's by Sir John Crosby. He was buried in St. Helen's, the parish church&mdash;a fair monument of him and his lady is raised there. He gave towards the reforming of that church <measure value="500bmark" type=currency><num value="500">five hundred</num> marks</measure>, which was bestowed with the better, as appears by his arms, both in the stone-work, roof of timber, and glazing. 
<P>I hold it a fable said of him, to be named Crosby, of being found by a cross; for I have read of others who have the name of Crosby before him; namely, in the year <datestruct value="1406"><year reg="1406">1406</year></datestruct>, the <num value="7">7th</num> of Henry IV. the said King gave to his servant, John Crosby, the wardship of Joan, daughter and sole heir of John Jordaine, fishmonger, &amp;c. This Crosby might be father, or grandfather, to Sir John Crosby. 
<P>And before him, in the reign of King Edward III. was another John Crosby, a Knight and Alderman of London, who had a son and heir called John. Of this Sir John I find this record&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Edwardus Princeps Walli&aelig;, Dux Cornubie, concessit, &amp;c.</hi>&mdash;&lsquo;Edward &lsquo;Prince of Wales, Duke of Cornwall, hath granted to Thomas Rigby, &amp;c.&rsquo; the custody of the manor of <hi rend=italics>Haneworth</hi>, and the advowson of the church of <hi rend=italics>Haneworth;</hi> which lately was <hi rend=italics>John Crosby's</hi>, Knight, late Alderman of London; which he held of the same Prince Edward the day wherein he died: to have and to hold until the lawful age of John his son and heir, called John Crosby. It was confirmed by the King. This Haneworth is placed on the river of Thames, not far from <hi rend=italics>Hampton Court;</hi> and in the time of Henry VIII. was in the Crown, and was so pleasantly situate, that that King delighted in it, saith Camden, above any other of his houses. 
<P>Richard Duke of Gloucester and Lord Protector, afterwards King, by the name of Richard III. was lodged in this house, while his nephew, Edward V. reigned: here he acted his feats; and here the citizens came to him with their professions of acceptance of him, and desiring of him to accept the crown. Since which time, among other, <hi rend=italics>Anthonio Bonvice</hi>, a rich merchant of Italy, dwelled there; on whom it seemed King Henry VIII. bestowed it, Anno <datestruct value="1542"><year reg="1542">1542</year></datestruct>, with all belonging to it; as appears by the copy of the grant which I have seen, running thus, Sciatis, &amp;c. &lsquo;Know ye, that we of our special grace, certain knowledge, and mere &lsquo;motion, give and grant unto the said Anthony Bonvice the reversion and reversions of the said messuage and tenement, with the &lsquo;appurtenances, commonly called <hi rend=italics>Crosby Place</hi>, and of all the said houses, solars, cellars, gardens, lanes, messuages, tenements, <pb id="p.46" n="46"> &lsquo;void place of land, and all other and singular premises, with the appurtenances, lying and situate in St. Helen's, and parcel of the &lsquo;said late Priory, &amp;c.&rsquo;&mdash;Teste Rege apud Westmonast. <num value="9">9</num> die Sept. An. Reg. Henrici Octavi <num value="34">34</num>. 
<P>After him German Cioll dwelt here. 
<P>Then William Bond, Alderman, increased this house in height with building a turret on the top thereof: he deceased in the year <datestruct value="1576"><year reg="1576">1576</year></datestruct>, and was buried in St. Helen's church. Divers ambassadors have been lodged there, namely, in the year <datestruct value="1586"><year reg="1586">1586</year></datestruct>, 
<hi rend=italics>Henry Ramelius</hi>, Chancellor of Denmark, Ambassador unto the Queen's Majesty of England from Frederic II. King of Denmark; an Ambassador of France, &amp;c. Sir John Spencer, Alderman, purchased this house, made great reparations, kept his mayoralty there, and since builded a most large warehouse near thereunto. In the <num value="1">first</num> of King James I. when divers ambassadors came to England, Monsieur de Rosney, Great Treasurer of France, with his retinue (which was very splendid) was there harboured, the house then belonged to Sir John Spencer within Bishopsgate; also (and I know not where else unless here) the same year were lodged the youngest son of William Prince of Orange, Monsieur Fulke, and the learned Monsieur Barnevelt, who came from the states of Holland and Zealand. This large and convenient house is now built into a square of good houses, and called Crosby Square.</TEXT></QUOTE><BIBL>&mdash; Strype's Stow, edit. <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, Book II. p. <num value="105">105</num>.</BIBL></CIT>

<P>In the time of the civil wars, Crosby House was made a temporary prison for the royalists. It was afterwards inhabited by Alderman Sir James Langham: in whose time a great fire happening, probably consumed so much of it as rendered it unfit for a domestic habitation. It was some time afterwards taken by a dissenting congregation, and the hall fitted up as a chapel, or meetinghouse, under the name of Crosby Chapel. To these tenants succeeded Messrs. Holmes and Hall, packers, who rent the principal part, and who unfortunately have been compelled to make many alterations, and some spoliations, to adapt it to the purposes of their business. Part of the south wing is converted into private dwellings, and the extensive vaults are let as wine cellars, &amp;c. to different owners. 
<P>Sir John Crosby in his will, dated <datestruct VALUE="1471-03-6"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=6>6th</day>, <year reg=1471>1471</year></datestruct>, states, that whereas he had done great and notable cost in building in and upon certain lands and tenements, which he then held of the Prioress and Convent of the House of St. Elynes; &ldquo;and whereas they then stood greatly indebted to divers creditors, to their right grevous charge and paine, out of his very pure charity and good zeal, he left them <num value="40">40</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> towards paying such creditors; provided they should, when required, seal and deliver, under their common seal, such writings, sufficient in law and approved by counsel, as should for them and their successors approve, ratify, and confirm the remainder of his estate and term of such lands,&rdquo; &amp;c. And in the same will he bequeaths such residence to his wife Ann, by the description of &ldquo;all his household, whole as it is, in Saint Helen's; and all his estate and term to come in the same, with all his wares and merchandise therein; his plate of gold, and of silver gilt, and of silver white, with all his armours, broches, beads, rings, &amp;c.&rdquo; 
<P>The Duke of Gloucester (afterwards Richard III.) must have had early possession of Crosby Place, after the demise of the founder, there being but <num value="10">ten</num> years difference in the period of their lives, Sir John Crosby dying in <datestruct value="1475--"><year reg="1475">1475</year></datestruct>, and Henry VII. after his victory and the death of Richard, ascending the throne in <datestruct value="1485--"><year reg="1485">1485</year></datestruct>. Crosby Place was doubtless the scene of all his plots and conspiracies against the lives and fortunes of his brother Clarence, the Earls of Rivers, Grey, &amp;c.; and where, in council with Buckingham, Catesby, Lovel, and other ambitious minions, he premeditated the destruction of Lord Hastings, and the bastardizing and subsequent murder of his nephews. 
<P>Shakspear, in his historical play of Richard the <num value="3">Third</num>, notices Crosby Place in the admirable scene between Gloucester and Lady Ann, widow of Prince Edward, whom the former was supposed to have killed, in the presence of Edward IV. and his brother Clarence. After his artful and successful courtship of the Lady, he is made by the Poet to address her in these words: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><CIT><QUOTE><sp><speaker>Glo.</speaker><L>And if thy poor devoted servant may

<L>I will with all expedient duty see you:

<L>To see you are become so penitent.</QUOTE><BIBL>&mdash;Richard III. Act I. Scene <num value="2">2</num>.</BIBL></CIT></QUOTE>

<P>The commentators on Shakspear notice this house to have been built in <datestruct value="1466--"><year reg="1466">1466</year></datestruct>, but that is evidently a mistake; the grant from the Prioress of St. Helen's for a term of ninty-<num value="9">nine</num> years, was made in that year; and it is reasonable to suppose the building of such a structure as Crosby Place must have been, would require at least <num value="5">five</num> years to the completion, which was accomplished in <datestruct value="1471--"><year reg="1471">1471</year></datestruct>. And on the <num value="23">23</num>d of May, in the same year, died Henry the <num value="6">Sixth</num>; consequently the Duke of Gloucester directing the Lady Ann to repair to CROSBY PLACE must have been a chronological error of the Poet. That Richard did reside at CROSBY PLACE is certain, but it must have been some years after the demise of Henry, it not being likely Sir John Crosby would build his house for any other inhabitants than himself. It came into the Duke of Gloucester's possession on the decease of Crosby, which took place in <datestruct value="1475--"><year reg="1475">1475</year></datestruct>. Until within the last <num value="15">fifteen</num> years, many fragments of stained glass adorned and beautified several of the windows, but they have been accidentally broken, and given away to the antiquarian visitors who have occasionally investigated the place. Both the bow windows on the south side of the council-room were taken down about <num value="30">thirty</num> years since to form a staircase to the adjoining dwellinghouse, then the residence of Mr. Hall, now in the occupation of Mr. Pasche, merchant. Very small vestiges of its former splendid character distinguish the upper part, and once ornamented roof of the council-chamber: of the oak carvings (represented in the Plate as <num value="4">four</num> in each compartment), not the smallest fragment is left; and the ancient windows have given place to large modern sashes, resembling those of a carpenter's workshop. The ancient fireplace, opposite the lower bow window of the council-chamber, must have appeared very grand in its pristine state: within the memory of <num value="1">one</num> of the persons at present in the employ of Messrs. Holmes and Hall, vestiges of its having been sumptuously gilt were quite apparent. This part of the building consisted of <num value="2">two</num> chambers, the lower and upper, the divisions by the floor being between the <num value="2">two</num> bow windows, the Gothic door at the extremity of the northern corner being the entrance into the upper chamber. 
<P>The ancient door or gateway, depicted in the exterior of the north-east view, is the present entrance to the cellaring or vaults of the hall, to which you descend by <num value="13">thirteen</num> steps, and enter the principal vault, which answers both in length and width to the <pb id="p.47" n="47"> dimensions of the hall. At <num value="6">six</num> feet above, level with the pavement, appear <num value="4">four</num> recesses, <num value="2">two</num> on each side, which originally were intended for windows, and doubtless were so used, as likewise another looking towards Great St. Helen's, but now bricked up. The altitude of these recesses considerably exceeds that of the pavement of Great St. Helen's; these formerly afforded light to the vaults; but that service has given way to the modern improvements of Bishopsgate Street, and is lost in the erection of the public house at the corner of the entrance to St. Helen's from Bishopsgate Street, and the adjoining houses in Great St. Helen's. The old gateway under the grated window, in the same view, is the entrance to the vaulted chambers under the building, and at present is in the occupation of Mr. Moule, wine-merchant, in Great St. Helen's, who has them in use as wine-cellars; a part is however let off, for the same purpose, to Mr. Currall, who keeps the public house the corner of the gateway in Bishopsgate Street. 
<P>At the north-east end of the upper part of the council-chamber is a Gothic door, communicating formerly with other parts of the building, with carved stone door-case, evidently coeval with the <num value="1">first</num> building of the room. At the extreme north-west end of the hall is a small Gothic door, that probably might lead to a music-gallery on the north-west side, the door being nearly elevated to half the height of the roof. The ornamented frieze border of the roof of the great hall is composed of various carved devices in wood, representing grotesque heads, white roses (the badge of the royal family of Edward the <num value="4">Fourth</num>), antique shields, and other emblematical devices, totally dissimilar <num value="1">one</num> with another. 
<P>The late Duke of Norfolk occasionally visited Crosby Hall, and was so much pleased with the roof, that he employed an artist to make correct drawings of the whole, and built his celebrated banquetting-room, at Arundel Castle, Sussex, precisely on the model, of mahogany. In the spring of the year <datestruct value="1816"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, the whole of the beautiful stone-work pillars and ornamental masonry of the council-room, were taken down by order of the proprietor, Strickland Freeman, Esq. and removed to his seat at Henley upon Thames, to adorn a dairy he was then building; the masons were employed <num value="6">six</num> weeks on this occasion, and all the fragments injured in the dilapidation were carefully cemented, and packed safe, previously to removal into the country. 
<P>The Plate consisting of the grotesque ornaments which compose the frieze that adorns the ceiling of the great hall, exhibits likewise <num value="1">one</num> of the windows with the ornamental carved mouldings and work, with which all the others are similarly adorned. The introduction of the resemblances of Richard III. as represented by the <num value="2">two</num> principal tragedians of modern days, Mr. Kemble and Mr. Kean, are inserted as applicable to Richard's residence here; and as the windows were formerly embellished with stained glass, they would necessarily have made a similar appearance with respect to effect with what is now introduced. The stone-worked bracket which surmounts the window, as represented in the Plate, is from <num value="1">one</num> of those dilapidated fragments which recently were to be found on the premises, but every succeeding day carries with it visible proof of general loss in these ancient ornaments. 
<div2 type=section id="c.18.29"><HEAD>The Bow-window Recess in the Hall of Crosby Place, with the Cellarage Entrance, Windows, &amp;c. of the Vaults beneath.</HEAD>

<P>The Recess which forms the interior of the remaining projecting small tower and Bow-window, appertaining to the hall (a similar <num value="1">one</num> to which likewise projected from the council-chamber), has been partitioned off from the hall, and is at present fitted up as a counting-house, although the dimensions as to length and breadth are but comparatively small; the grand effect of the beautiful and highly-ornamental stone worked roof, fails not to attract attention, and to convey to the mind something more resembling the structure of a side chapel appertaining to some of our cathedrals, than the embellishment of a window framed as a recess or break in a hall of audience. Hospitality, in former times, took place of etiquette, and these magnificent rooms of the wealthy founders were in use more to receive and entertain their friends with profuse and sumptuous feasts and banquets, than merely to receive set visits, and make a display of empty parade: in proof of this, we have only to instance
the memorable feasting of Sir Henry Picard, vintner, Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1356--"><year reg="1356">1356</year></datestruct>, &ldquo;who, in <num value="1">one</num> day, did sumptuously feast
Edward King of England, John King of France, the King of Ciprus (then arrived in England), David King of Scots, Edward Prince of Wales, with many noblemen and others; and after the sayd Henry Picard kept his HALL against all commers whatsoever, that were willing to play at dice and hazard: in like manner the Lady Margaret, his wife, did also kepe her chamber to the same intent. The King of Ciprus, playing with Henry Picard in his HALL, did winne of him <measure value="50bmark" type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> markes</measure>; but Henry, being very skilful in that art, altering his hand, did winne of the same King the same <measure value="50bmark" type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> markes</measure>, and <measure value="50bmark" type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> markes</measure> more; which, when the same King began to take in ill part, although hee dissembled the same, Henry said unto him, &lsquo;My Lord and King, be not &lsquo;agreeved, I court not your gold, but your play; for I have not bidd you hither that I might grieve, but that amongst other things I &lsquo;might enjoy your play;&rsquo; and gave him his money againe, plentifully bestowing of his owne amongst the retinue; besides, he gave many rich gifts to the King, and other nobles and knights who dined with him, to the great glory of the citizens of London in those days.&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Vide Stow's Annals</hi>, <num value="263">263</num>. 
<P>So wealthy and liberal a man as Sir John Crosby appears to have been, we may naturally suppose was not wanting in disposition to keep his HALL with the like magnificence; and though it does not appear he either had an opportunity to feast as many kings, or gamble quite so high, or perhaps at all; yet royalty did not disdain to take up its residence in Sir John Crosby's establishment; and it will never fail to be recorded, that Crosby Place was considered by the aspiring and ambitious Richard the <num value="3">Third</num>, as a palace not unworthy his residence. 
<div1 type="chapter" n="19" id="c.19"><HEAD>The Priory and Church of St. Helen, Bishopsgate Street.</HEAD>
<p><figure id="fig.1.46.1" n="2000.65.0033"><head>South West View of the Church of St. Helen.  Bishopsgate Street, London.</head></figure>
<P>St. Helen, to whom this Priory was dedicated by <hi rend=italics>Constantius Chlorus</hi>, Governor of Britain under the Romans, was mother of Constantine the Great, the <num value="1">first</num> Christian Emperor of Rome. She was the daughter of <hi rend=italics>Coel</hi>, Prince of the Britons, and born at Colchester, in Essex, according to the British Chronicles. But some Greek writers (among whom is Nicephorus) relate, that she was born at Drepanum in Bithynia in Asia, being the daughter of an host in that city, who brought her to <hi rend=italics>Constantius</hi>, then happening to be there in his passage as Ambassador into Persia, who being enamoured with her rare beauty and comeliness, became so intimate with her as to have a child by her, which child she named Constantine. But Cardinal <hi rend=italics>Baronius</hi> disputes this story, and avers that she was by birth a Briton, and no concubine to <hi rend=italics>Constantius Chlorus</hi>, but his lawful wife. 
<P>This is that Helena, who in ancient writings is named <hi rend=italics>Piissima</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Venerabilis Augusta.</hi> She went to Jerusalem, and there found out Christ's Cross; and ordained <hi rend=italics>Quirinius</hi> Bishop of Jerusalem. She afterwards returned to Rome, where she died, and was interred about the year of our Lord <num value="326">326</num>, aged <num value="80">80</num> years. From Rome she was afterwards translated by her son <hi rend=italics>Constantine</hi>
to Constantinople, and from thence, as <hi rend=italics>Peter de Natalibus</hi> writes, into Venice, where, says he, her body lies buried in a monastery <pb id="p.48" n="48"> dedicated to her name; but others say her body was translated to Rheims, where her translation is celebrated yearly, <datestruct VALUE="-02-7"><month reg="02">Feb.</month> <day reg=7>7</day></datestruct>; and at Rome her festival is kept <datestruct VALUE="-08-12"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=12>12</day></datestruct>. 
<P>Before she came from Jerusalem she repaired that city, adorning the same with many goodly churches and monuments. In many other places she erected divers churches which were afterwards dedicated to her name. In her native country of Great Britain (for so the most authentic writers affirm) she left some memorials of herself, for she built (as it is said) the walls of London and Colchester, and erected also a goodly church at Bedford, which, being turned into a monastery, was destroyed by the Danes about the year <datestruct value="868"><year reg="868">868</year></datestruct>. Whosoever desires to read more of St. Helen, may be satisfied out of Eusebius in <hi rend=italics>Vita Constantini, Ruffinus, Sozomen, Peter de Natalibus, Nicephorus</hi>, and divers other authors. 
<P>The original foundation of the Priory of St. Helen was when Alardus de Burnham was Dean of St. Paul's, about the year <datestruct value="1212"><year reg="1212">1212</year></datestruct>, in the latter part of the reign of King John, for Dean Burnham died on the <datestruct VALUE="1216-08-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1216">1216</year></datestruct>. The permission to place Nuns there, was granted by himself and the Chapter of St. Paul's, to William Basing (in the instrument termed &ldquo;William, the son of William the Goldsmith&rdquo;), who was patron of the parish church of St. Helen, but which patronage he afterwards vested in the newly founded Convent. This permission, or grant, with a translation of it, follows; as also certain constitutions made for the Nuns, by Reginald Kentwood, Dean of St. Paul's, and the Chapter, in the year <datestruct value="1439"><year reg="1439">1439</year></datestruct>. These Nuns, it should be observed, were of the Benedictine Order, and wore a black habit, with a cloak, cowl, and veil.

<P>Know all present and to come, that I, <hi rend=italics>Alardus</hi>, Dean of the church of St. Paul, London, and the Chapter of the same church, do grant to William, the son of William the Goldsmith, patron of the church of St. Helen, London, that he may constitute Nuns in the same church for the perpetual service of God therein, and may bestow on the society of the same, the right of patronage to the said church, as the same was granted to him by our predecessors; provided that the Prioress or other governing such house (after election made by the same), do make presentation thereof to the Dean and Chapter of London, and swear fidelity to the same Dean and Chapter, as well for such church, as for a pension or annuity of half a mark, payable within <num value="8">eight</num> days of Easter; and that they do further swear, not to alienate such before-mentioned patronage, or to subject their Convent to any other control.

<P>At the dissolution of religious houses, this Priory was surrendered, <datestruct VALUE="-11-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, <num value="30">30</num> Henry VIII. and was then valued at <num value="314">314</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> according to Dugdale, and <num value="376">376</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> as Speed. After the suppression, King Henry VIII. in the <num value="33">thirty-third</num> of his reign, gave the site of the Priory and its Church, called the <hi rend=italics>Nuns' Church</hi>, to Richard Williams, alias Cromwell: and Edward VI. in the <num value="4">fourth</num> of his reign, by his letters patent, bearing date the <datestruct VALUE="-04-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, conferred the jurisdiction of this place on the Bishop of London and his successors, which was afterwards confirmed by Queen Mary in the <num value="1">first</num> year of her reign; though since it has been granted back, as also the advowson of the Church, to the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's, who are both patrons and ordinaries of the place, and collate to this Church as a vicarage. 
<P>The Nuns' Hall, and other houses thereto appertaining, were, after the dissolution, purchased by the Leather-sellers, a society incorporated by letters patent of the <num value="22">twenty-second</num> of Henry VI. anno <datestruct value="1442"><year reg="1442">1442</year></datestruct>, by the name of the Wardens and Society of the Mystery or Art of Leather-sellers of the City of London, who converted the <hi rend=italics>Nuns' Hall</hi> into a Common Hall, for the purpose of holding their occasional meetings and settlement of accounts; and it continued in such use, until it was demolished, with the other remnants of the old Priory, in <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>, to make way for the foundation for the present St. Helen's Place. 
<P>This Priory and magnificent Hall occupied a considerable portion of Little St. Helen's, a good large place, having <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> courts within it, with good old timber houses, well inhabited by merchants and opulent traders; likewise some alms-houses built by Sir Andrew Judd, for <num value="6">six</num> poor alms-people; and for the endowment of which Sir Andrew gave lands to the Skinners, out of which they were to give <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> every week to the <num value="6">six</num> poor alms-people, <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> the piece, and <num value="25">25</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> the year in coals for ever. 
<P>The general view given of the ruins of this ancient Priory and religious structure, dedicated to St. Helen, as represented in the prospect delineated S. E. reminds us rather of some romantic fragment of antiquity to be found in distant counties, than of <num value="1">one</num> situated in the very centre of the populous city of London; and were it not for the modern buildings made out in the back ground, which exhibit the nature of the adjoining neighbourhood, a spectator might be led to imagine the scene no other than many miles distant from the metropolis of England; yet it is most certain that it represents nothing more than parts of the cloisters and adjoining buildings of St. Helen's Priory, previous to its entire demolition, as above noticed. The drawing was made on the spot at the time the workmen were employed, and shows the S. E. view of the still remaining Church, and a faithful representation of what appeared in the year <datestruct value="1799"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>. 
<P>The Nuns' Dining Hall, or Refectory, a view of which is represented over that of the <num value="2">two</num> crypts at the south end, was formed of the best joiners' and plaisterers' work in the kingdom; the screen was most elegantly worked, having <num value="6">six</num> columns of the <hi rend=italics>Ionic</hi>
order richly adorned; and the curiously fret-worked ceiling, panelled wainscot, richly worked window abutments, Gothic recesses, <pb id="p.50" n="50"> and grand stone-worked arched entrance, rendered the appearance of the whole, when perfect, a scene truly striking and sublimely grand. Enough is preserved in the view of the great south window, to ascertain its immense magnitude; and from the number of the other windows that ornamented this apartment, sufficient light must have been admitted to dispel the gloom which generally pervades most ancient buildings. 
<P>The <num value="2">two</num> Crypts under the great Hall, communicating with each other (views of which, from the north and south, are given in the Plates), were probably occasionally in use by the Nuns, for devotional exercise and meditation: indeed, the Roman calendar abounds with saints sufficient to furnish the religious orders with prayers and masses, <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> times every day throughout the year. 
<P>The view of the <num value="2">second</num> Crypt, looking from the south, was taken immediately after the demolishing of the Hall and other buildings above; and in the same Plate are represented specimens of the architecture of the building, which is Norman: the parts delineated are the piscina on the west side of the double range of vaulting, the springer to the arched head of the passage, the arched passage on the west side of the double range, elevation of the base, and plan of <num value="1">one</num> of the columns and springers which support the arched roof of the same. 
<P>In the plan of the Nunnery are shown the entrances to Crypts by the vaulted passages, <num value="1">one</num> of which was <num value="56">fifty-six</num> feet in extent, looking to the north: it will also be observed, that the Crypt to the north was considerably larger than that at the southern end of the building. The situation where the Nuns were placed, in order to have a complete view of the altar of the conventual church, is described by slanting apertures made through the Church wall; this church was divided from that of the parish (also under the same roof) by a partition, since taken down. 
<P>The Church of St. Helen is situate in a fair court or square on the east side of Bishopsgate Street, in Bishopsgate Ward, and has a retired and pleasing appearance: but that there was a more ancient church here before the founding of the said Priory, appears by an agreement or grant (preserved in Newcourt's Repertorium) to the Canons of St. Paul's by <num value="1">one</num> <hi rend=italics>Ranulph</hi> and Robert his son. After this the Church fell into the hands of the Dean and Chapter by the death of the grantors above named, and of a <num value="3">third</num> person, to whom they had reserved it during his life: they granted the right of patronage to the William, mentioned, the son of William the Goldsmith, who afterwards applied himself to Alardus the Dean, and the Chapter of St. Paul's, and got leave of them to found a Priory for Nuns here. 
<P>The present Church of St. Helen's is a venerable structure, and being much decayed, was begun to be repaired in the year <datestruct value="1631"><year reg="1631">1631</year></datestruct>, and was fully restored, and in every part richly beautified, at the cost and charge of the parishioners in the year <datestruct value="1633"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>&mdash;William Hurt, Thomas Aldridge, Churchwardens. The charge of this great reparation amounted to the sum of <measure value="1300l." type=currency>&pound; <datestruct value="1300--"><year reg="1300">1300</year></datestruct></measure> and upwards. 
<P>This Church fortunately escaped the destructive fire of London in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, and is a Gothic structure of the lighter kind, consisting of a plain body with large windows. The tower was not built till the year <datestruct value="1669"><year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct>, and is wrought with rustic at the corners, crowned with a turret and dome, with a bell in it. It appears Sir Thomas Gresham had promised to have built a steeple, in recompense for the ground occupied by the erection of his monument in the Church, but by an oversight (it is presumed) in his will, no provision was made for that purpose. 
<P>The parsonage of St. Helen's was in the Crown in the reign of Queen Elizabeth; a lease whereof she granted about the year <datestruct value="1588"><year reg="1588">1588</year></datestruct> to <num value="1">one</num> Captain <hi rend=italics>Nicholas Oseley</hi>, for his good service against the Spaniards: this <hi rend=italics>Oseley</hi> being in Spain in those eventful and dangerous times, had sent very good intelligence thence; and likewise in the fight against the Spanish fleet in <datestruct value="1588--"><year reg="1588">1588</year></datestruct>: whereupon 
<hi rend=italics>Howard</hi>, Lord Admiral, sent a letter in his behalf to the Lord Treasurer, that for the causes above mentioned it was the Queen's pleasure that he should stay the same parsonage, that no lease of it in the meanwhile should be granted out of the Exchequer, which should prevent the reward of <num value="1">one</num> that had so well deserved in adventuring his life so many ways in Her Majesty's service. 
<P>But before this, in the <num value="10">10th</num> Elizabeth, <datestruct VALUE="-05-27"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=27>27th</day></datestruct>, the Queen granted to <hi rend=italics>C&aelig;sar Adelmare</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Thomas Colsil</hi> the rectory, parish church, messuage, tithes, &amp;c. for <num value="21">twenty-one</num> years, reserving unto her Majesty and her heirs the advowson of the vicarage. 
<P>The rectory came afterwards to <hi rend=italics>Michael Stanhope</hi>, Esq. and <hi rend=italics>Edward Stanhope</hi>, LL.D. and <num value="1">one</num> of the Masters of the Court of Chancery, <measure value="20l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="20">20</num></measure> to be issuing from the said rectory every year, <hi rend=italics>pro stipendio</hi>, i. e. for a salary to a sufficient preacher of God's word, to be allowed by the Bishop of London: the parish have a copy of the Queen's sale, granting to them &ldquo;the whole rectory and Church of St. Elen's, with their rights, members, and appurtenances, late belonging to the Priory of St. Elen's; and all the messuages, houses, edifices, gardens, and tithes, oblations, rents, fruits, profits, advantages, commodities, &amp;c.&rdquo; This bears

It is a very plain monument, almost square, and has a door for the sexton on certain occasions to go in and clear it from dust and cobwebs. The minister has <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure> for preaching a sermon once a year in commemoration of Mr. Bancroft's charities, on which occasion the almsmen and scholars attend at church, and are entertained with a good dinner. 
<P>With many other persons of inferior note. 
<P>The exterior of the Church presents the south-west view taken from the back of Crosby Hall; the adjoining houses were introduced to show the state of its neighbourhood: the <num value="2">two</num> large windows, <num value="1">one</num> of which is over the portico entrance, are similar in shape and dimension to that formerly in the great Hall of the Priory. 
<P>The south-west view of the interior of the Church, taken at the time the pews were removed for a very extensive repair and improvement in the year <datestruct value="1808"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>, shows the situation of the monuments in that part of the edifice; viz. Captain Bond's, Gaussen's, Bond, Sen., Rev. J. Standish's, Sir Thomas Gresham's, Sir William Pickering's, together with Sir John and Lady Crosby's. The ground-plan of the Church, accompanying that of the Nunnery, exhibits the relative situation of every monument within the walls of this sacred building.

<P>We shall finish our account of this ancient Priory and Church, by enumerating some of the principal buildings of which it consisted, when in a perfect state, in order that the reader may better understand the accompanying Plan, and the other Plates before alluded to. 
<P>In the different parts of the Nunnery mentioned in Kentwode's Constitutions, are more particularly named&mdash;&ldquo;a firmayre,&rdquo; or hospital for &ldquo;seeke sustres;&rdquo; &ldquo;a dorture,&rdquo; or dormitory; the cloister, with its doors (<num value="1">one</num> of which was a &ldquo;posterne doore going out of the cloystere into the churche-yard&rdquo;); the kitchen, with its hatch, guarded by iron spikes; and the &ldquo;Nonnes Quere,&rdquo; with its door. In the survey made at the dissolution, some of the above, with other places, are thus further noticed:<NOTE N="*"><P>&ldquo;The Parishe of Saint Elenes, within the Citie of London, and the Scite of the late Priory therein.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Fyrste, the cheaf entre, or cominge
in to the same late Priory ys in and by the street gate lyying in the parishe of St. Elenes, in Bishopsgate-street, which leadeth to a little cowrte next adioning to the same gate, havinge chambers, howses, and buyldinges, environinge the same, out of w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> cowrte there is an entre leadinge to an inner cowrte, w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> on the North side is also likewise environed w<hi rend=sup>th</hi> edificyons and buyldings, called the Stewards lodging, with a countinge house apperteninge to the same. Item, next to the same cowrte ther ys a faire kechinge, withe a pastery house, larder houses, and other howses of office, apperteninge to the same; and at the Est ende of the same kechyn and entre leadinge to the same hall, w<hi rend=sup>th</hi> a little parlor adioyning, having under the same hall and parlor sondrie howses of office, next adioyning to the cloyster ther, and <num value="1">one</num> howse called the Covent parlor. Item, III fair chambers adioyninge to the hall, whearof the <num value="1">one</num> over the entree leadinge to the cloyster, thother over the buttree, and the <num value="3">third</num> over the larder. Item, from the said entre by the hall to the cloyster, w<hi rend=sup>ch</hi> cloyster yet remaneth holly leaded, and at the North side of the same cloyster a faire long howst called the Fratree. Item, at thest ende of the same cloyster, a lodginge called the Suppryor's lodging, w<hi rend=sup>th</hi> a litle gardin lieing to the same. And by the same lodginge a pare of staires leading to the dortor, at the South end whearof ther is a little howse, wherein the evidence of the said howse nowe dou remayne, w<hi rend=sup>th</hi> all howste and lodginges vnder the same dortor.

Item, at the estende of the said cloyster, an entre leading to a little garden, and out of the same littell garden to a faire garden called the Covent garden, conteninge by estimacion half an acre. And, at the North end of the said garden, a dore leading to another garden called the kechin garden; and at the West ende of the same ther is a dovehowshe; and in the same garden a dore to a faire woodyerde, w<hi rend=sup>th</hi> howses, partic'ons, and gardens, w<hi rend=sup>th</hi>in the same woodyerd. A tenement, w<hi rend=sup>th</hi> a garden, a stable, and other thappurtenances to the same belonginge, called Elizabeth Hawte's lodginge. All which premisses ben rated, extentyd, and valued, the King's Highnesse to be discharged of the reparac'ons, of the yerely value of VIl. XIIIS. IIIId.&rdquo;</NOTE> The gate-house, or chief entrance, leading from Bishopsgate Street. This stood where was formerly the entrance to Little St. Helen's, and where is now the opening to St. Helen's Place. It is described as leading to an outer court, surrounded with chambers, houses, and buildings, probably occupied by the officers and servants of the establishment. This outer court occupied the <num value="1">first</num> small square on entering into Little St. Helen's, where, before the late alterations, a meeting-house, &amp;c. stood. It led, by an entry, to a <num value="2">second</num> or inner court, likewise surrounded with buildings (to guard it from the gaze of the neighbouring houses), and where were the steward's lodging and counting-house. You then came to what might be properly termed the interior of the Convent, where stood its principal and finest buildings. These consisted more particularly of the hall, kitchen, cloisters, the great or convent parlour; the chapter-house, the fratry, the dorture, evidence house, &amp;c. The situation of all these, and their contiguity to each other, are distinctly marked out in the survey. The &ldquo;faire kechinge,&rdquo; with its pastry house, larder houses, &amp;c. was the <num value="1">first</num> building after passing through the inner court; and was adjoined, on its east end, by a passage leading to the hall, and a small ante-room. This passage (which was a vaulted <num value="1">one</num>) is marked in the Plan by the letter A. It led to the crypts under the same hall and anteroom, which are described as having various offices, or &ldquo;howses of office,&rdquo; in them, and to have adjoined the cloister there (i.e. the east side of it), where also was the great chamber called &ldquo;the covent parlor.&rdquo; This <num value="1">first</num> crypt was the <num value="1">one</num> to which the passage A leads in the Plan, and is the same of which the view is given in Plate I. looking from the north. It had <num value="2">two</num> doorways leading to the cloisters, which are shown on the right hand of the view. The <num value="1">first</num> of these, opening to the <num value="2">second</num> passage marked in the plan, was a piece of very solid masonry, and is delineated in Plate II. as an &ldquo;arched passage on the west side of the double cloister.&rdquo; <pb id="p.52" n="52"> Above, and adjoining the hall, were &ldquo;III fair chambers, whereof the <num value="1">one</num> was over (this) entree leadinge to the cloyster, th&lsquo;other over the buttree, and the <num value="3">third</num> over the larder.&rdquo; In a straight line with this entry or passage, ran the north side of the cloister, at the western extremity of which was &ldquo;a faire long howst called the fratree.&rdquo; The remains of this fratry, with the wall of the north side of the cloister, are the principal objects shown in Plate III. which also exhibits opposite, the side of St. Helen's Church, with the door into the Nuns' quire (as it is called), or rather the conventual Church, and in the foreground the ruins of the crypts under the hall, &amp;c. The door leading from the cloister to the fratry, which the writer of this well remembers to have seen at the late demolition of it, was particularly elegant, the mouldings of the upper part being filled with roses of stone, painted scarlet and gilt; the windows of the fratry itself also, which were nearly lancet-shaped, were extremely beautiful. A piscina stood a little west from this doorway, which is shown in the view. On the east side of the cloister was the sub-prior's lodging, with a small garden attached; next to which were stairs leading to the dormitory, evidence-room, &amp;c. These latter rooms stood over the vaults to which the entrance, marked B in the Plan, leads; which were not double, as were those under the hall, but notwithstanding of an elegant make: their form and situation will be exactly understood from the Plate. From the crypts on the south, it will be seen, the Nuns had apertures to view the celebration of divine service in their Church, without being obliged to attend there, as we have elsewhere observed. The form, style of architecture, and other detail of this elegant range of vaults, will be seen in the <num value="2">two</num> accompanying views of them. 
<P>The cloister is described in the survey as then standing perfect, &ldquo;and holly leaded.&rdquo; From the foundation of this cloister numberless sculls, and other remains of morality, were dug up in forming St. Helen's Place: in many of the former the teeth were perfectly sound and white, though we know they must have been buried there before the dissolution. This site had been for many years occupied as a garden. 
<P>The situation of the chapter-house is not mentioned in either of the authorities we have quoted, though such a building formed part of the Convent, and was the place at which many of their deeds and leases were dated. 
<P>The &ldquo;Covent-garden,&rdquo; containing half an acre, kitchen-garden with its dove-house, a wood-yard, &amp;c. are also places enumerated as parts of the ancient Priory. Probably the Leather-sellers' Company's garden might be the former of these. 
<P>The Convent possessed the advowson of St. Ethelburg, near the Priory; of St. John the Baptist, and St. Mary Wolnoth; the manor of Marks, at Layton, and the manor of St. Helen, in East Barming, Kent, &amp;c. &amp;c. Their seal (a perfect impression of which is among the records of the Leather-sellers' Company), was the discovery of the cross by St. Helen. It has been engraved by Dr. Rawlinson, and has been copied by Malcolm, Lond. Rediv. iv. p. <num value="548">548</num>. <pb id="p.53" n="53">

<P>In the commencement of the Will of this eminent and benevolent Citizen, there appears the following passage concerning the erection of the curious and stately sepulchral memorial which is represented in the annexed Engraving. &ldquo;And I will my body to be buryed in the Parishe Churche of Saincte Helene, nigh Bisshoppesgate, in London, as nigh vnto the place there whereas the bodie of Agnes, my late wife, lieth buryed, as conveniently may be.

The verses inscribed upon the Monument are positively unintelligible, without some previous information of the marriages and issue of Sir Andrew Judde; and it is remarkable that his very name was perhaps originally wanting upon this sepulchral memorial: for though it now appears inscribed upon the lower part of the base, it is evident, from the description of the tomb by Edward Hatton, published in <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, that such a distinction did not then exist. &ldquo;I find,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>no name to this;</hi> but those conversant with heraldry will guess at it from the arms above.&rdquo;<NOTE N="*"><P><hi rend=italics>New View of London.</hi> Lond. <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>. <num value="8">8</num>vo.

<P>He was the eldest son of John Judde, of Tunbridge, in the County of Kent, by Margaret, daughter and, seemingly, heiress, of Valentine Chiche, and widow of&mdash;Clovell, of Essex. She was related to the famous Henry Chichele, Archbishop of Canterbury, by her mother, Philippa, daughter of Sir Robert Chichele, Knight, his next brother.<NOTE N="*"><P><hi rend=italics>History of Kent</hi>, by Edward Hasted, Vol. ii.

<P>The name of Sir Andrew Judde will ever stand pre-eminently conspicuous upon the long and honourable list of those Citizens of London, who have devoted a large portion of their wealth and possessions to the support of their less fortunate fellow-creatures, and the purposes of general benevolence; since his charities provided alike for the infirmities of destitute old age and the education of unassisted youth. The <num value="1">first</num> of these institutions is fully described in another article of this work; and the present account of the Founder appears to be an appropriate place for giving some notices of the latter, though it be but indirectly connected with the City of London. 
<P>The Free Grammar School of Tunbridge, the native place of Sir Andrew Judde, was founded and endowed by him, under Letters Patent of Perpetuity, dated <datestruct VALUE="1553-05-16"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=16>16th</day>, <year reg=1553>1553</year></datestruct>, the <num value="7">7th</num> year of Edward VI. He erected the School-house at the north end of the town, the original building being upwards of <num value="100">100</num> feet in length, in front, constructed in a plain, neat and uniform, style, with the sandstone of the vicinity.<NOTE N="*"><P>Hasted's 
<hi rend=italics>History of Kent</hi>, Vol. ii. p. <num value="346">346</num>. A considerable addition, however, was erected at the back of the master's dwelling in <datestruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>, by the Skinner's company, together with a hall or refectory for the scholars; and there now also belong to the establishment, detached offices, a garden, and a play-ground. A small, but elegant library, was built at the united expense of the patrons of the school, and the Rev. James Cawthorn, Master from <datestruct value="1743--"><year reg="1743">1743</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1761--"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Ibid.</hi> note u.</NOTE> For the endowment of both his foundations, he bought estates in the name of himself and Henry Fisher, who was afterwards his Executor, and confided the management of those estates as well as of his School and Almshouses to the Skinners' Company, of which he was a member.

Sir Walter Mildmay, Chancellor, &amp;c. and others, to whom had been committed the examination of a deed in the name of Henry Fisher, supposed to have been forged,&mdash;&ldquo;had found great untruth and impudency in the said Andrew Fisher; and that for very vehement <pb id="p.56" n="56"> presumptions they thought very evil of the deed: nevertheless, upon Fisher's submission, they had been contented to withdraw out of the bill all words that touched him in infamy; and so the bill penned passed this House with an assent on both sides, as well to help Tunbridge School as others that had bought land of the said Andrew's father bona fide.&rdquo; At this time the Skinners' Company expended the sum of <measure value="4000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4000">4000</num></measure> in prosecuting these and other suits; for Fisher again endeavoured to deprive both the School and Corporation of the property, under pretence that the latter was not rightly named in the Act of Foundation, which being again brought before the House of Commons upon the Company's petition, with Fisher's consent, another Act was passed, <datestruct value="1588--"><year reg="1588">1588</year></datestruct>-<num value="89">89</num>, the <num value="31">31st</num> of Elizabeth, confirming the former, for the better assuring of the lands and tenements belonging to the Free-School of Tunbridge.<NOTE N="*"><P>Hasted's

<p><figure id="fig.1.56.1" n="2000.65.0040"><head>The Original Antient Steeple of St. Michael in Cornhill, London.</head></figure>
<P>The discovery of a singularly ancient drawing of the original steeple of this church, previously to its destruction in <datestruct value="1421--"><year reg="1421">1421</year></datestruct>, cannot but be thought an object of curiosity to the antiquary. St. Michael's steeple is admired for its elegance; though but a modern imitation, and censurable for having departed, in many instances, from the true 
<hi rend=italics>Gothic</hi> standard. Those who compare it with its predecessor before the fire, and the still more ancient representation here given, will see that this ornament of the city has, for ages, been nearly of the same form, and will, consequently, be able to appreciate Sir Christopher Wren's claim to originality in this, his masterpiece, in the old style of building. 
<P>The drawing is made with pen and ink, on the fly-leaf of a large vellum vestry-book, commencing in the early part of the reign of Henry V.; opposite to which are the explanatory lines we have engraved in the plate. This vestry-book, and others, have furnished the extracts which follow; all of which are unnoticed, and were probably 
<hi rend=italics>unseen</hi>, by former writers. 
<div2 type=section id="c.21.31"><HEAD>THE CHURCH,</HEAD>

<P>On the north side, was open to the street, from which it was separated by a small green churchyard. Its west front, as now, was divided from the adjoining houses by St. Michael's Alley, then called &ldquo;the <hi rend=italics>Longe Aley</hi>,&rdquo; which had a gate and <hi rend=italics><num value="2">two</num> crosses</hi> near it, for the erecting of which (<num value="37">37</num>. Hen. VI.) <hi rend=italics><measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure></hi> were paid. At night, a 
<hi rend=italics>lantern</hi> was suspended over this gate; and another in the cloister. <num value="2">Two</num> new lanterns, for this purpose, in <datestruct value="1551--"><year reg="1551">1551</year></datestruct>, cost the sum of <measure value="20d." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num>-pence</measure>. On the south side, was a <num value="2">second</num> churchyard, in part surrounded by the <hi rend=italics>cloister</hi>
before noticed, and filled with monuments of eminent persons; in the midst of which was another cross. <hi rend=italics>Twentypence</hi> was paid in <datestruct value="1470--"><year reg="1470">1470</year></datestruct>, to <num value="1">one</num> William Barbor, for making of this cross, &ldquo;and for naylls, and for tymbre for said cros, and for the carpent<hi rend=sup>s</hi>. labor.&rdquo;&mdash;The church, withinside, was divided into a body and side aisles. It had a choir, fitted up for singing, lighted by clerestory windows; an after-chapel of our Lady, a chapel of St. Catharine, and various others. Its altars and images will be seen in enumerating the several items in the churchwardens' accounts, which instruct us as to other particulars. 
<P>The <num value="2">second</num> steeple, which was begun to be built in <datestruct value="1421--"><year reg="1421">1421</year></datestruct>, was probably finished in <datestruct value="1430--"><year reg="1430">1430</year></datestruct>, as in that year William Rus, or Russe, alderman and goldsmith, added, by will, a <hi rend=italics><num value="6">sixth</num></hi> bell, or <hi rend=italics>tenor</hi>, to the <hi rend=italics><num value="5">five</num></hi>, which had been hung in the former belfry. <num value="15">Fifteen</num> years afterwards, the following entries occur for church work:

<P>The civil wars brought in the Presbyterian form of discipline in this church, and the vestry ordered, pursuant to an ordinance of parliament, dated <datestruct VALUE="1643-08-28"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=28>28</day>, <year reg=1643>1643</year></datestruct>, for the demolishing of monuments of &ldquo;idolatrie and supersticion&rdquo;&mdash;that same should be forthwith put into execution in this parish. 
<P>This church having shared the common fate in the great fire of London, Sir C. Wren was employed to erect the present elegant structure. It consists of an exquisitely proportioned interior of the Tuscan order; <num value="6">six</num> pillars and <num value="4">four</num> semi-pillars compose a body and <num value="2">two</num> aisles; the roof of the middle consists of intersected arches, separated by ornamental bands, which spring from elegant brackets: over each arch are circular clerestory windows; small pilasters face the pillars on the north and south walls; and from those, arches intersect; and centre flowers have pendant chains for lustres. 
<P>The sacrarium is fronted by <num value="2">two</num> pilasters, whose capitals are gilt, and a rich gilt cornice passes from them to the east wall.&mdash;The altar-piece is very elegant.&mdash;The tower, which is of the pointed style, and very tall, was built in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>. Though not correctly designed in the <hi rend=italics>Gothic</hi> taste, it is certainly very beautiful. At each corner is an angulated turret, as high as the belfry; where they become fluted, and the capital ornamented with sculptures of human faces, from which they spire into very elegant pinnacles. 
<P>The dreadful conflagration in Exchange Alley, which happened in the year <datestruct value="1748"><year reg="1748">1748</year></datestruct>, was stopped by the tower of this church. <pb id="p.61" n="61">

<P>The district wherein this edifice is situate, was the <num value="1">first</num> of those numerous hamlets, which, at various times, have been separated from the very ancient and spacious Manor of Stepney. This place formerly extended from Aldgate along the river-side to Bow-creek, on the south: to the Parish of St. Leonard, Bromley, on the east; and to those of St. John, Hackney, and St. Leonard, Shoreditch, on the north. &ldquo;So that,&rdquo; says Strype, &ldquo;Stepney may be esteemed rather a province than a parish, especially if we add that it contains in it both city and country: for towards the south parts, where it lies along the river for a great way by Limehouse, Poplar, and Radcliff, to Wapping, it is furnished with every thing that may entitle it to the honour, if not of a city, yet of a great town; populousness, traffic, commerce, havens, shipping, manufactures, plenty, and wealth the crown of all. And were it not eclipsed by the lustre of the neighbouring City, it would appear <num value="1">one</num> of the considerablest towns of the kingdom, and would give place to very few cities in England.&mdash;On the other side, northward, this parish hath the face of a country, affording every thing to render it pleasant; fields, pasture-grounds for cattle, and formerly woods and marshes.&rdquo;<NOTE N="a"><P>Stow's

<P>The present Parish of St. Mary, White Chapel, appears by its name to have been originally only a chapel-of-ease to that of St. Dunstan, Stepney; though it also seems to have been separated from thence at an early period, since in <datestruct value="1336--"><year reg="1336">1336</year></datestruct>, the <num value="10">10th</num> year of Edward III., the Bishop of Alba, Cardinal, and Parson of Stebinhith, presented a clerk to be <hi rend=italics>Parson</hi> in the Church of the Blessed Mary, called Matfelon, without Aldgate, London.<NOTE N="b"><P>Strype's Stow's <hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, Vol. II. book iv. chap. ii. p. <num value="44">44</num>.</NOTE> The great partition of this place, however, was the work of a much later time; and the Rev. Daniel Lysons<NOTE N="c"><P><hi rend=italics>Environs of London</hi>, (Middlesex,) vol iii. Lond. <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>, <num value="4">4</num>to. p. <num value="448">448</num>.</NOTE> observes, that &ldquo;the <num value="1">first</num> plan for dividing the Parish of Stepney which I have met with upon record, was proposed to the Commissioners appointed to enquire into the state of Ecclesiastical Benefices, in <datestruct value="1650--"><year reg="1650">1650</year></datestruct>. It was then suggested, that it would be convenient to divide Stepney into <num value="4">four</num> Parishes: Poplar and Blackwall to be <num value="1">one</num>, there being a foundation already laid; Limehouse to be another; a <num value="3">third</num> the whole hamlet of Ratcliffe, Shadwell, and Wapping-Wall, to Old Gravel Lane, taking in from thence all Ratcliffe-highway, and Mile-end to belong to the mother-church; the <num value="4">fourth</num> to contain Wentworth Street, Rose Lane, part of Petticoat Lane, Artillery Lane, all Spitalfields, and Stepney Rents, near Shoreditch. This division never took place. In the year <datestruct value="1657"><year reg="1657">1657</year></datestruct> a petition was presented for dividing Shadwell from Stepney, which was ordered to be done, unless good cause were shewn to the contrary; but a subsequent order appointed a commission to enquire into the expediency of it: what the result of this commission was does not appear.&rdquo; <num value="6">Six</num> of the hamlets of Stepney were, however, at length made into distinct Parishes; Shadwell being separated in the year <datestruct value="1669"><year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct>, St. George's in the East in <datestruct value="1727--"><year reg="1727">1727</year></datestruct>, Spitalfields in <datestruct value="1729--"><year reg="1729">1729</year></datestruct>, Limehouse and Stratford-Bow in <datestruct value="1730--"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>, and Bethnal-Green in <datestruct value="1743--"><year reg="1743">1743</year></datestruct>. To these may be added the Parish of St. John at Wapping, separated from Whitechapel in <datestruct VALUE="1693-01--"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1693">1693</year></datestruct>-<num value="94">94</num>: and the Parish of All Saints, Poplar, separated from Stepney in <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>.<NOTE N="d"><P>This Act of Parliament received the Royal Assent <datestruct VALUE="1817-06-16"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=16>16th</day>, <year reg=1817>1817</year></datestruct>.

The edifice is erected in a field on the south side of the East India Road, near the grand entrance to the East India Docks, and was designed by Mr. Charles Hollis. A View and description of it are inserted in the <hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi> for <datestruct VALUE="1831-06--"><month reg="06">June</month> <year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>, Vol. ci, part i. p. <num value="489">489</num>, plate <num value="1">1</num>.</NOTE>

<P>The chief cause of the erection of the Hamlet of Shadwell into a separate Parish, and of building the Church represented in the annexed Engravings, was doubtless the great increase of the inhabitants of this part of the suburbs, and the incapability of the Church at Stepney to contain even <num value="1">one</num> half of the parishioners. It was, however, principally by the exertions of Thomas Neale, Esq. lessee of an estate which comprised <num value="2">two</num>-thirds of the present parish, aided by the Rev. William Sancroft, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, under whom that estate was held as Dean of St. Paul's,&mdash;that an Act of Parliament was procured for making the precinct parochial. An entry on the <hi rend=italics>Journals of the House of Commons</hi> states, that on Thursday, <datestruct VALUE="1669-02-17"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=17>17th</day>, <year reg=1669>1669</year></datestruct>-<num value="70">70</num>, the <num value="22">22nd</num> year of Charles II., it was &ldquo;ordered that leave be given to bring in a Bill for erecting and endowing a Church, near Shadwell in Middlesex.&rdquo; On the day following the Bill was read a <num value="2">second</num> time, and committed; and, on Thursday, <datestruct VALUE="-03-17"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=17>17th</day></datestruct>, it was passed under the title of &ldquo;An Act for the Endowment of a Church at Shadwell, now in the Parish of Stepney in Middlesex, and making of it Parochial, distinct from Stepney.&rdquo; 
<P>The boundaries of the new Parish were that of Stepney, on the north and east, St. George's Middlesex, on the west, and the River Thames, on the south; the whole extent of which is very small, being only <num value="910">910</num> yards in length and <num value="760">760</num> in breadth.<NOTE N="e"><P>Lysons'

The living was made a Rectory, and the Advowson was to be <num value="1">first</num> in Mr. Neale, during his life, and afterwards in the Dean of St. Paul's, London, as ground-landlord of the whole Parish; for which reason also the Church was dedicated to St. Paul the Apostle.<NOTE N="a"><P>On account of the ancient and intimate connection between Shadwell Church and the Deanery of St. Paul's Cathedral, London, the armorial ensigns of the latter are represented beneath the annexed Engravings.

<P>In the old Churchyard of Shadwell there also stood a small stone pedestal, with an obliterated inscription, originally erected over a well of fine water, accidentally discovered in the digging of a grave; the stream whereof was at <num value="1">one</num> period continually running into a street opposite the south gate of the Church, thence called Springstreet. As there is a tradition that the Parish derived its name from a religious foundation near a spring dedicated to our Lady of St. Chad's, or Shad's Well, on the site of which the old Church was erected,&mdash;the water thus discovered might possibly have been the Well referred to. About <num value="10">ten</num> years since the stream was cut off, in consequence of a deep main sewer having been carried through High Street, Shadwell, though it was then intended to sink the spring lower and to restore it.<NOTE N="a"><P>Local information given to the late Mr. Wilkinson.</NOTE> Another Spring, of a very powerful medicinal nature, and thence called Shadwell Spa, was also discovered about the year <datestruct value="1738"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct>,<NOTE N="b"><P>In the <num value="1">first</num> edition of Maitland's <hi rend=italics>History of London</hi>, <datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>, fol. p. <num value="783">783</num>, this spring is said to have been <hi rend=italics>lately</hi> discovered, and it is also erroneously stated in the same place to be &ldquo;a very strong allomish water.&rdquo;</NOTE> by Walter Berry, Esq. in sinking a well in Sun Tavern Fields, in the north-eastern part of this Parish. The waters were said to have a strong astringent taste, and to be impregnated with sulphur, vitriol, steel, and antimony: hence they were of real benefit as an antiscorbutic, but in a pamphlet, published by Dr. Diederich Wessel Linden, M. D. to make known their virtues, they were declared to be a cure for every disorder incident to humanity by either drinking or bathing.<NOTE N="c"><P>This pamphlet consists of <num value="16">16</num> pages, and is entitled <hi rend=italics>Directions for the Use of that extraordinary Mineral-Water, commonly called Berry's Shadwell-Spaw, in Sun Tavern Fields, Shadwell, near London.</hi> Lond. <datestruct value="1749--"><year reg="1749">1749</year></datestruct>. <num value="8">8</num>vo. Its contents are limited to a very extended enumeration of the diseases for which the water is beneficial, with various methods of employing it, and the quantity required for each; but a particular account of its discovery and composition is given in <hi rend=italics>A Treatise on the Origin, Nature, and Virtues, of Chalybeat Waters, and Natural Hot Baths</hi>, by the same author. Lond. <datestruct value="1748--"><year reg="1748">1748</year></datestruct>. <num value="8">8</num>vo. chap. v. pp. <num value="135">135</num>-<num value="173">173</num>, being entirely devoted to the Shadwell Spring, which he calls &ldquo;the most remarkable concrete mineral-water that ever I have seen or heard of.&rdquo; After giving some notices of the ancient springs of London, Dr. Linden states that the Shadwell Spa is situate &ldquo;about <num value="2">two</num> miles east of the Tower, and about half a mile from the river, or Shadwell-Dock stairs, ascending from thence all the way to the top of a hill, where is a field of a triangular form called Sun Tavern Fields, on the eastern side of which we find our medicinal fountain.&rdquo; He then proceeds to give the following account of its discovery. In <datestruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></datestruct>, when Mr. Berry was churchwarden of Shadwell, he was desired by the parishioners to use some means for making the Shadwell Waterworks Company pay their proportion of the parochial and king's taxes; the former of which they had not paid for nearly <num value="20">twenty</num> years, and when rated for the latter they paid but as it pleased them; all the former parish officers being afraid to interfere with an incorporated body. Mr. Berry accordingly cited them into the Bishop's Court and cast them, after some years' contest, upon which they removed the cause into the Archbishop's Court, and again lost it; and in retaliation in a few days after they cut off the Thames water supplied by them to the houses of Mr. Berry, and <num value="15">fifteen</num> of his tenants, to remedy which he commenced sinking a well, and employed the most skilful person in London to superintend the work. &ldquo;In digging,&rdquo; says Dr. Linden, &ldquo;they observed that the surface of the ground was a common earth; after that they had gotten <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> feet down, they came to a gravel, of a good deep yellow, and after that to a very hard ballast, which was difficult to dig up, and was as coarse and lumpish as wash-balls. Under this they came to a rock, which as soon as they broke through up sprang the water, as strong as if a main had been broken in the tree: that is, as I understand my worthy and communicative correspondent, to whom we are beholden for this authentic account of it,&mdash;as if the main trunk of the subterranean tree, or great pipe had burst, which branches forth into the other pipes which supplies the houses with water.&rdquo; The proprietor had lived on the same spot for <num value="20">twenty</num> years and had never heard of any water with remarkable qualities near him; nor were the properties of the spring immediately known, but soon after a pump had been erected over it a child of <num value="1">one</num> of his tenants heated with play, drank plentifully of the water, and speedily went home sick and vomited to an excessive degree. It is rather remarkable, that if the inhabitants of this spot were deprived of all other water, the emetic qualities of the well should not have been instantly discovered; and that the owner himself should have <hi rend=italics><num value="1">first</num></hi> tasted it, when the mother of the child came to him in the greatest alarm. Some time after it was tried for washing the eyes of a horse belonging to Mr. Berry that was nearly blind, of which it ultimately recovered the sight; whereupon, finding such benefit in the water, the proprietor enclosed the well and built a bath and pump room. Dr. Linden then relates a series of <num value="42">42</num> chemical experiments which he made upon the water, &ldquo;which I began.&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;on the <datestruct VALUE="1746-06-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1746">1746</year></datestruct>; the day warm and serene, and I was at the well by <num value="6">six</num> o'clock in the morning:&rdquo; they shew that the spring contained a strong solution of iron. &ldquo;This water,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;is of a light yellow, nearly the colour of French brandy, and sparkles when poured into a glass like a fermented vegetable juice, such as cider, &amp;c. and tastes very astringent. Thence the vulgar or improper expression, that this water of Shadwell tastes like alum.&rdquo;&mdash;In the <num value="3">third</num> of the <num value="12">twelve</num> corollaries which follow the account of these experiments, the author vindicates the genuineness of this spring as a natural mineral water, against the suspicion and charge that it was either an artificial contrivance, made with alum, &amp;c. or only impregnated with decomposed sea-coal, or the refuse of some ancient copperas or vitriol works in the vicinity; both of which he denies by the following arguments. That water-side premises were required for such works, and that the present spot was too far from the river, being on the top of a hill, almost a mile from the Thames, whilst there were convenient places on the banks: that no remains of old wells, reservoirs, &amp;c. required in such works, had been found near the spring: that no decomposed coal had been discovered near it, but only the strata already mentioned, the water issuing from a solid rock beneath: that the remains of old copperas works, &amp;c. would have rendered the soil unfit for ballast, whereas the whole of Sun Tavern Fields had been dug away for <num value="10">ten</num> feet deep for that material: that such remains, or decomposed coal could not penetrate the rock enclosing the spring: that the water was wholly unlike that found in coal mines: that the character and station of the proprietor as a Middlesex magistrate, was superior to the supposed fraud: that the water had been subjected to chemical analysis: that the alum-like taste was given by borax and acid contained in solution, which were too costly to be employed in adulteration: that an attempt had been made to soften the water for common use by throwing in a load or <num value="2">two</num> of lime, &ldquo;which caused so great effervescence, and made such a reek and smothering, that the proprietor was glad to clear it all out again:&rdquo; and, lastly, that a water artificially prepared would infallibly discover itself by its smell when evaporated.&mdash;Advertisements of these waters occur as early as <datestruct value="1742"><year reg="1742">1742</year></datestruct>, the following having been copied from the <hi rend=italics>Daily Advertiser</hi> of Saturday, <datestruct VALUE="-09-18"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=18>18th</day></datestruct>. &ldquo;Shadwell Spaw in Sun Tavern Fields, near Shadwell Church, is famous for its certain cure of all cutaneous distempers; as leprosy, and all breakings out of the body, often with <num value="3">three</num> times bathing only; no money is required if a cure is not perform'd. &lsquo;Tis also good in many other disorders: taken inwardly it vomits gently.

<P>At the beginning of the present century, the original Church of Shadwell had become very much dilapidated, and the fall of a small portion of the ceiling near the pulpit, took place <num value="1">one</num> Sunday, a little before the commencement of the service. As this happened soon after the destruction of the spire of St. Nicholas' Church at Liverpool,<NOTE N="b"><P>This fatal accident took place <datestruct VALUE="1810-01-11"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=11>11th</day>, <year reg=1810>1810</year></datestruct>, about <num value="10">ten</num> minutes before the time of service; and the destruction extended from the tower up to the altar, all the space between being desolated in an instant. Only about <num value="20">twenty</num> persons were in the Church at the time; the greater part of whom escaped, but the female children of
the Moorfields Charity School had partly entered, and <num value="27">27</num> of them were overwhelmed, <num value="18">18</num> of whom were killed, or died immediately after they were dug from the ruins. It was supposed that the accident was to be attributed to neglect, and to allowing the bells to be rung whilst the foundation of the building at the west angle of the tower was undergoing the process of pinning; and it appeared also that the old part of the tower had been built <num value="450">450</num> years, upon which a new upper structure had been added in <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct>.

The <num value="1">first</num> year of the rate levied by virtue of the above Act had been collected, and was in itself amply sufficient for the security of those who were disposed to lend money, but from the reduction of trade in the Parish, and the small number of opulent persons dwelling in it, the pressure of that rate was found extremely heavy; especially as a great expense had been incurred during several unsuccessful applications to Parliament, which had been defrayed out of the funds raised under the Act.&mdash;The information in the text concerning the sale of the old edifice and the erection of the new, was furnished by the Parochial Authorities to the original Proprietor of this work.</NOTE> on Monday, <datestruct VALUE="1817-08-11"><month reg="08">August</month> the <day reg=11>11th</day>, <year reg=1817>1817</year></datestruct>, on the spot, in <num value="91">91</num> lots, to be removed within <num value="5">five</num> days after the sale, which produced <num value="223">223</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="13">13</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> On Monday, <datestruct VALUE="-09-1"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=1>1st</day></datestruct>, were sold the walls, wood-work, &amp;c. of the Church, tower, and vestry, in <num value="71">71</num> lots, to be removed within <num value="21">twenty-one</num> days after the sale, which amounted to <num value="419">419</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="1">1</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> The old lead was exchanged in part of payment for that with which the new edifice was covered, as were also the <num value="6">six</num> bells, which were re-cast with additional metal for the present peal, consisting of <num value="8">eight</num>. 
<P>The last Engraving of the ensuing series represents an exterior North-west view of the New Church of St. Paul, Shadwell, which was erected in <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>, from the design of the late Mr. John Walters, of Fen-Church Buildings,<NOTE N="e"><P>Mr. Walters died at Brighton, <datestruct VALUE="1821-10-4"><month reg="10">Oct.</month> <day reg=4>4th</day>, <year reg=1821>1821</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="30">30</num>; and some notices of his life and works will be found in the <hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi> for that month and year, Vol. xci. part <num value="2">2</num>, p. <num value="374">374</num>.</NOTE> by Mr. J. Streather. The body of the edifice is constructed of brick, lighted by <num value="10">ten</num> windows on each side, and decorated with stone mouldings, &amp;c. At the western end is a vestibule, ascended by <num value="6">six</num> steps, supported by <num value="4">four</num> pilasters of the Tuscan Order in front, surmounted by a stone pediment, and lighted by <num value="2">two</num> windows on each side. In the centre is <num value="1">one</num> large door between <num value="2">two</num> niches, above which are <num value="3">three</num> panels, containing the names of the Architect and Builder, and date of the erection. Above the vestibule rises the tower, consisting of a base, containing the clock, and <num value="2">two</num> stories above, terminated by an octangular stone spire, and a vane. The <num value="1">first</num> story in the steeple is square with arched windows, having <num value="2">two</num> Corinthian columns projecting from each angle; and the <num value="2">second</num> story is circular, containing in its circumference <num value="6">six</num> pillars of the same order. The interior of the building is plain, and small, corresponding to the very limited extent of the Parish already noticed, but is extremely chaste and harmonious both in its design and execution. A series of <num value="16">sixteen</num> Tuscan columns supports the galleries, the eastern of which is circular, and contains the organ, placed above the altar, and occupying a projection of the building similar to that at the western end. The roof is a flat concave of a square form, enclosing an ornamented circle, and the recess at each end is covered by a broad decorated arch. On the front of the western gallery is a large marble tablet, containing the names of the officers, and date of the year when the Church was built. The whole of the interior fittings--up are of varnished oak, and the prevailing tint is a pale stone colour; the Creed, &amp;c. being written in golden letters on panels of a darker shade of the same: behind the circular back of the altar is a door corresponding to that at the west, but of a smaller size. The building within is lighted by gas, and its inside measurement is about <num value="96">96</num> feet in length by about <num value="36">36</num> in the broadest part, and <num value="30">30</num> in height. In the whole of this building, though limited in expenditure to a sum comparatively small, the entire cost amounting to only <num value="14000">14,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> and submitting his plans to parochial approval,&mdash;the architect has produced an edifice peculiarly chaste and elegant: the steeple is possessed of remarkable beauty, and is but little inferior to the most admired specimens in the metropolis, so accurate is its design, and so great the harmony of its several parts.

The old School-house was built upon ground belonging to the estate of the Hon. Thomas Bowes, held by him, by or trustees for him, under a lease from the Dean of St. Paul's. The edifice having fallen into great decay. a subscription was raised for rebuilding it, and a negociation opened with Mr. Bowes' trustees for a grant of the old ground and materials; which some difficulties prevented being effected. In the mean time, about <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, the School-house became uninhabitable: the Master and Mistress were removed to lodgings, and the children were also taught in hired apartments which were both inconvenient and expensive.

<P>The south part of this Parish, called Lower Shadwell, was originally a portion of Wapping-Marsh, and before the embankment of the Thames was actually within the course of the river: but it is now inhabited by tradesmen and manufacturers connected with the shipping. The streets within the district called Old and New Gravel Lanes, were so named from their having been formerly ways by which carts filled with gravel passed from the neighbouring Sun-Tavern Fields to the Thames, where it was employed in ballasting ships, until ballast was procured from the bed of the river. The fields alluded to have long constituted the only land in Shadwell not covered with buildings: they consist of but a few acres, and are occupied by several rope walks, <num value="400">400</num> yards long, in which cables are made from <num value="6">6</num> to <num value="23">23</num> inches in girth.<NOTE N="g"><P>Lysons'

At the head of the coffin and the foot, there were <num value="2">two</num> jars, of a <num value="3">three</num> foot length, standing, and on the sides a number of bottles of glistering red earth, some painted, and a great many vials of glass, some <num value="6">six</num>, some <num value="8">eight</num>, square, having a whitish liquor within them; within the chest was the body of a woman, as the chirurgions judged by the skull. On either side of her were <num value="2">two</num> sceptres ofivory, <num value="18">18</num> inches long; and on her breast a little figure of Cupid, neatly cut in white stone; and with the bones <num value="2">two</num> printed pieces of jet, with round heads, in the form of nails, <num value="3">3</num> inches long. &lsquo;It seemeth,&rsquo; says Sir Robert Cotton, from whom I had this relation, &lsquo;that these bodies were burnt, about the year of our Lord <num value="239">239</num>, it being there were found divers coins of Pupienus Gordian, and the Emperors of that time; and that <num value="1">one</num> may conjecture by her ornaments, that this last body should be some Princess or Pro-Pr&aelig;tor's wife here in Britain, in the time of the Roman government.&rsquo;&mdash;And hence the foresaid learned Bishop concludeth that London so near adjoining to this burying-place, was the metropolis of Britain in the times the Romans had to do here; inasmuch as it may be presumed from the burial of this lady, that the legate of the Emperor, or Pro-Pr&aelig;tor, had his chief residence here; and the great business of the province, as to civil matters, was brought hither to him. Here was his Pr&aelig;torium, which at <num value="1">first</num> signified the general's tent; but that as the name came from the camp to the city, so the Pr&aelig;torium was the house of the Governor.&rdquo; Strype's Stow's <hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, Vol. ii. book iv. chap. ii. p. <num value="43">43</num>.</NOTE> <num value="1">One</num> of the ancient prominent features of this Parish was the Shadwell Water-works, <pb id="p.68" n="68"> which were also established by Mr. Neale, the founder of the church, in <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, for the benefit of the surrounding inhabitants.

<P>If the tradition recorded upon the famous Foundation-Plate preserved in this edifice could be received as an authentic narrative, it would be rendered by far the most ancient and honourable Church in Britain: but the deficiency, obscurity, and uncertainty, of the ecclesiastical history of England previously to the arrival of Augustine, and the questionable character of those later annalists by whom its events are written, afford but little evidence or information as to the time when this building was really erected. Yet whatever may be the true value of this monument in point of proof,&mdash;as a genuine relique of some antiquity, and as exhibiting the age which has now been assumed for this Church for upwards of <num value="3">three</num> centuries,&mdash;the present historical notices will most properly commence with a copy of the inscription itself . a most accurate, though reduced, Fac-simile of the characters in which it is engraven, now published for the <num value="1">first</num> time,<NOTE N="a"><P>This Fac-Simile, together with the other <num value="3">three</num> engravings of the Church of St. Peter upon Cornhill, and the Plan of the Fire in Bishopsgate Street, &amp;c.&mdash;all contained in the present work,&mdash;were originally designed to have formed part of the illustrations of an intended history of that Church and Parish: in which Mr. Robert Wilkinson, the original proprietor and publisher of these volumes, long resided, and to which he was greatly attached. The manuscript collections for it, with extensive extracts from the Parish-books, are now preserved in <num value="3">three</num> volumes folio in the City Library at Guildhall; and have been carefully consulted for the ensuing pages.

Ranulph Higden, in his <hi rend=italics>Polychronicon</hi> lib. iv. anno <datestruct value="195"><year reg="195">195</year></datestruct>, has the more explicit words &ldquo;Lucio Rege Britonum absque liberis defuncto, et in Claudiocestri&aelig; sepultus est,&rdquo; citing Jeffrey in the margin as his authority; and all the best English historians have made the same statement. The words distinguished by Italic letters in the above extract, however, will also very well allow of being construed,&mdash;and was honourably buried in the Church of the Chief See;&mdash;namely, that of St. Peter at London, which had been constituted the Prime Metropolitan Cathedral. Some particulars concerning the burial-place of Lucius at Gloucester will be found in a future note. Many accounts of this king are entirely at variance with the statement and dates, on the plate as above given, since they represent him as having quitted his kingdom after his baptism, to have become a preacher of the gospel in Germany, and to have died Bishop of Lucion in France: whilst his sister is stated to have suffered martyrdom in the latter country under the name of St. Emerita.

This prince had really a sister Emerita&mdash;probably only a general appellation for all religious female recluses, &amp;c.&mdash;and the British King had a niece called by the same name, which coincidence has increased the confusion.&mdash;There is also very considerable doubt and difference of statement as to the exact date which ought to be assigned to the event recorded on the above plate; the time having been computed by various historians according to various methods, from A.D <num value="164">164</num> to A.D. <datestruct value="183"><year reg="183">183</year></datestruct>.

<P>It is not here intended to enter into any enquiry as to the origin or truth of that history of Lucius and his opiscopal establishment so extravagantly set forth in the British History of Jeffrey of Monmouth, upon the slight and doubtful notices of Venerable Bede and Nennius, taken from <hi rend=italics>foreign sources only</hi>, after Gildas, the most ancient genuine British author, had declared that he could not procure any historical records in Britain.<NOTE N="b"><P>&ldquo;I will endeavour,&rdquo; says Gildas, &ldquo;only to set forth to the world those evils, which in the times of the Roman Emperors, Britain suffered, and also brought upon others, as well her own citizens as strangers; yet, nevertheless, not farther than I am able to declare them: not so much out of the chronicles of the country, or the monuments of its authors,&mdash;because, if there have been any such, they are either devoured by the fires of enemies, or have been long since transported into distant nations by the ships of our exiled countrymen, and do not now appear,&mdash;as by the relations of foreign writers; which, broken off with many interruptions, are not sufficiently clear.&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Gild&aelig; Supientis De Excidio Britannic&aelig;, Liber Querelus</hi>, cap. ii. in the <hi rend=italics>Histori&aelig; Britannic&aelig;, Saxonic&aelig;, Anglo-Danic&aelig;, Scriptores XV</hi>, by Dr. Thomas Gale, Oxon. <datestruct value="1691--"><year reg="1691">1691</year></datestruct>. fol. Vol. I. p. <num value="10">10</num>.&mdash;The particulars of Venerable Bede's foreign authorities, and of the origin and gradual increase of the legendary story of Lucius and his extensive episcopal establishment, may be seen in the very curious and learned Preface to <hi rend=italics>An Historical Account of Church Government</hi>, by Dr. William Lloyd, Bishop of St. Asaph, Lond. <datestruct value="1684--"><year reg="1684">1684</year></datestruct>. <num value="8">8</num>vo. signature b.</NOTE> This examination will not be attempted here, as well on account of the length to which it would extend, as that it is to be found so well executed in numerous works, and is not required by the present inscription; which has very remarkably no reference to the fabulous parts of the history, but almost entirely agrees with that plainer statement of it, which is now generally supposed to have been the truth. Of Lucius himself it will therefore be sufficient to relate, that he is at the present time believed to have been a British Prince, not very distantly descended from that Cogidunus on whom the Emperor Claudius bestowed some cities, which authority was continued in the family.<NOTE N="c"><P><hi rend=italics>History of England</hi> by the Rev.

The chief difficulty concerning him appears to be the situation of his kingdom; since if it stood on the north of Hadrian's Wall, he could have had no power over Carlisle and London, where he planted Metropolitan Sees, and if on the south, he must have been only a vassal of the Romans who could not so entirely have abolished heathenism as he is said to have done. The latter objection is, however, answered by the supposition that he retained the favour of the Romans; and Bishop Stillingfleet supposes that the place of his government was in the Counties of Surrey and Sussex, over the people called the Regni.<NOTE N="d"><P>Stillingfleet's

In the year of our Lord <num value="186">186</num> was overthrown the Temple of Apollo which was at Westminster, that was then called Thorney; and then was begun to be built the Church of St. Peter, <num value="274">274</num> years before the coming of the Angles into Britain, and <num value="411">411</num> years before the arrival of St. Augustine and his associates.

Howbeit, by the Tables hanging in the reuestry of Sainte Paule's at London, and also by a Table sometime hanging in Saint Peter's Church in Cornhill, it shoulde seeme that the sayd Church of Saint Peter in Cornhill was the same that Lucius builded. But herein, sayth Harrison, Anno Mundi <num value="4174">4174</num>, doth lie a scruple: sure Cornell might soone be taken for Thorney, especially in such olde recordes as time, age, euil handling, hath oftentimes defaced.&rdquo;&mdash; William Harrison, referred to in this extract, was a student of Westminster and Oxford, and minister of Radwinter in Essex, where he died in <datestruct value="1593--"><year reg="1593">1593</year></datestruct>.

In the report whereof, giue me leaue, gentle reader of London, my natiue citie, to speak a little: for although it may be, and dooth seeme, impertinent to my purpose, yet it shall not be much, and therefore I will soone make an end. There is a controuersie moued by our historiographers, whether the Church that Lucius builded at London, stood at Westminster or in Cornehill. For there is some cause why the Metropolitane Church should be thought to stand where S. Peter's now doth, by the space of <num value="400">400</num> and odd yeers before it was remoued to Canterburie by Austine, the monke, if a man should leane to <num value="1">one</num> side without anie conference of the asseuerations of the other.

From these, and other specimens, they appear to have been generally of a long form, with a loop in the centre at the top for suspension, whence they received their general name of Pensile Tables. They were sometimes surrounded by a border and divided into compartments, by projecting ornamented lines, and were sculptured with a small black character.&mdash;A foundation-plate of brass, resembling in subject and design that at St. Peter's, was affixed to a column in Glastonbury Church, Somersetshire, and contained a very full account of the original establishment of that edifice by Joseph of Arimathea and his associates. It was of an octangular shape, with a separate piece beneath formed like a pedestal, measuring altogether <num value="10">10</num> inches by <num value="6.50">6 1/2</num> at the widest part, the <num value="2">two</num> plates being affixed to the pillar by <num value="12">twelve</num> projecting holes; and the inscription, enclosed by a line, was coarsely and deeply engraven in the Monkish Gothic character of about the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> or <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century. Impressions and counter-impressions of these plates are given in Sir Henry Spelman's <hi rend=italics>Concilia</hi>, Vol. I. pp. <num value="7">7</num>-<num value="10">10</num>, with remarks on their antiquity and authenticity: and from the appearance of the letters, the author concludes that they were not more than <num value="3">three</num> centuries old at the publication of his work in <datestruct value="1639--"><year reg="1639">1639</year></datestruct>.&mdash;The subjects engraven on Pensile Tables appear to have been very various; since they included epitaphs, genealogies of persons buried in their place of suspension, indulgences granted to such as prayed for the deceased, registers of miracles, the foundations and dimensions of buildings, lists of Bishops, &amp;c. gifts, histories, and chronicles, prayers, texts, and psalms, and the order of religious services for the priests who were to perform them. The material used for those which were intended as records, appears to have been always brass; but some temporary inscriptions were written on wood. Their use in Churches may probably be referred to that of the classical <hi rend=italics>Tabula Votiva</hi> suspended in heathen temples as records of cures, deliverances, and vows and their performance: these were commonly made of copper.</NOTE> This was of a much later period than the former, since the historical events recorded upon it terminated with the death of Henry V., in the Bois de Vincennes near Paris, <datestruct VALUE="1422-08-31"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=31>31st</day>, <year reg=1422>1422</year></datestruct>, and the Coronation of Henry VI. as King of France, <datestruct VALUE="1431-12-16"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=16>16th</day>, <year reg=1431>1431</year></datestruct>, in the <num value="10">10th</num> year of his reign. It commences with the ages of the world, and also comprises an abstract of the history of Jeffrey of Monmouth; with the Latin verses concerning the Oracle of Diana, the story of Brute, and the origin of London.

Its age would thus be fixed to the middle of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century, or about the reign of Edward IV., when Stow relates that the Church of his own time was finished by various benefactors whose arms appeared within it. To this period also the language and orthography of the inscription in Cornhill would refer it, or as Pegge supposes, to <num value="1">one</num> not earlier than the reign of Henry VII., even allowing,&mdash;as the order for making and erecting such a monument does not appear in the existing parochial records,&mdash;the present Plate to be only a substitute for <num value="1">one</num> much older, destroyed in the Fire of London, and engraven in characters which it is now impossible to exhibit.

<P>Beside the testimony of this Inscription-Plate, it has been argued that the Cathedral founded by Lucius was erected on Cornhill rather than at Westminster, because most, if not all, of the ancient Episcopal Churches were established in <hi rend=italics>walled cities</hi>, such as London; which was so defended by the Romans long before the time of Lucius. The spot on which St. Peter's Monastery was founded at Thorney was a low marshy wilderness, overflowed by every tide, distant <num value="3">three</num> miles from the capital of the Trinobantes, unprotected by the Roman legions, and altogether a place unlikely for the archbishop to fix on as the principal See of the kingdom. Cornhill, on the contrary, was in the heart of a walled City, and <num value="1">one</num> of the highest spots in London, like the site of St. Paul's Cathedral, whereon it is supposed that there once stood a Temple to Diana, also changed into a Christian Church: added to which the remains of Roman temples yet existing on the Continent, shew that they were almost always erected on high places.<NOTE N="e"><P>MS.

<P>Whatever may be the real antiquity of this Church, Stow commences his account of it, by stating that the edifice of his time was finished in the roof and glazing in the reign of Edward IV., as appeared by the arms which it contained of Noblemen, and Aldermen of London, then living. There are, however, in various records, the following memorials relating to this Church at a much earlier period; when it seems to have been of some celebrity for the number of Chantries which had been established in it, the Chaplain-Clerks belonging to them, and, as is indicated by the following circumstances, as a Sanctuary: which privilege, according to tradition, was <num value="1">first</num> given to Christian Churches by King Lucius, and was therefore probably supposed to belong peculiarly to the present edifice.&mdash;In <datestruct value="1230--"><year reg="1230">1230</year></datestruct>-<num value="31">31</num>, says Stow, citing the City record called the <hi rend=italics>Liber Albus</hi>, the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> year of Henry III., <num value="1">one</num> Ralph De Wainefuntaines was stabbed with a knife by some unknown person in St. Paul's Church-Yard; so that he died the day following. <num value="1">One</num> Geoffrey Russel, Clerk, was with him at the time he was struck, who immediately fled to the Church of St. Peter; and would neither come to the peace of our Lord the King, nor depart from the Church. According to the usual custom with contumacious offenders, the Sheriffs of London caused the Churchyard to be watched, to prevent his departing secretly or receiving food, though the refugee found means to escape from the custody.<NOTE N="c"><P>The words &ldquo;Peace of the King&rdquo; in this passage, express a submission to the protection and authority of the laws or other institutions of the country, in contradistinction to the Peace of the Church, or Sanctuary, which any offender, excepting <num value="1">one</num> guilty of high treason or sacrilege, could claim for <num value="40">forty</num> days: after which he became an outlaw. The remarkable custom of watching and starving a prisoner who had fled to a common church or unprivileged refuge, is illustrated in the Rev. Samuel Pegge's excellent paper &ldquo;on the Asylum or Sanctuary,&rdquo; printed in the <hi rend=italics>Archaeologia</hi>, vol. viii, <datestruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></datestruct>. art. i. pp. <num value="7">7</num>. <num value="39">39</num>, <num value="40">40</num>.</NOTE> Another extract from the same record, states, that in the <num value="28">28th</num> year of Henry III. an inquisition was taken before the King's Justices at the Tower, concerning the death of Amice, Deacon of the Church of St. Peter de Cornhulle, who had been found slain in the door of Martin, Priest, in the Soke of Cornhulle, upon St. Luke's Eve; <datestruct VALUE="1244-10-17"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=17>17th</day>, <year reg=1244>1244</year></datestruct>.

The <hi rend=italics>Liber Albus Transcriptorum</hi>, was probably so named from the white leather with which it is covered, and is supposed by Strype to have been compiled by John Carpenter, Town Clerk of London in the reign of Henry V., and a great benefactor to the City. It is dated <datestruct VALUE="1419-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1419">1419</year></datestruct>, in the Mayoralty of Richard Whyttington, and contains as it is stated on <num value="1">one</num> of the opening pages, laudable customs, not written, wont to be observed in the City, and other notable things worthy of remembrance, written here and there scatteringly without any order.

<P>Notwithstanding the many notices of the antiquity of St. Peter's Church as a foundation, the age of that building which existed at the time of the Great Fire, appears to have been very inconsiderable.

At the north-west angle of the tower is a tall narrow turret, reaching to the top of the upper battlements, also consisting of <num value="2">two</num> stories embattled, and terminating in a pointed dome or cupola, raised upon small and high clustered columns, and crowned by a vane. In the lower story of the tower, on the north, appears a large circular window, and in the same stage of the turret a clock with a lozenge dial, whence it was called the Clock Tower. The Church below seems to be composed of <num value="2">two</num> divisions of unequal height, each enclosed by a wall with battlements, that adjoining to the steeple being the lower; it <pb id="p.79" n="79"> contains an arched door and window, and was possibly that part of the edifice called the North Chapel.<NOTE N="a"><P>This interesting view of St. Peter's Church, and of several other ancient objects in the vicinity, is contained in Plate I. of the <hi rend=italics>Antique Remains of the Parish of St. Martin Outwich</hi>, Lond. published by R.

In front of the tower are <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> houses with arched doors, overhanging stories, gables, and transom casement-windows, the largest of which was probably the Parsonage; and against the north-east side of the Church appear to be several low buildings, like small shops or sheds, by which it seems to have been always enclosed, similar to the manner in which it is at present. There are numerous entries in the Vestry-Books relating to these erections both as injurious and noxious to the Church to which they adjoined, and as parish property; and Newcourt has the following notices concerning them, before the time when those records commence. &ldquo;As to the glebe of this Church, in the <num value="1">first</num> and <num value="2">second</num> of Mary, <datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>-<num value="54">54</num>, Dr. John Hodgkins, then Rector thereof, let out to Stephen Heath <num value="2">two</num> messuages abutting on the parsonage-house on the south, and on the King's High Street on the north parts; (being glebe belonging to this Church) for <num value="31">31</num> years, for <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> rent per annum.

<P>Having thus laid before the reader such particulars as are yet extant concerning the ancient history and appearance of this Church, the subsequent account of it will perhaps be best continued by the following series of original entries from the parochial records; which shew the principal changes that have taken place in the building, and frequently contain the most curious illustrations of the manners and customs of the times to which they refer.

As the Parish-Clerks, subsequently established performed many of the same duties, and often held the same privileges, they considered themselves to be also belonging to the Clergy, and empowered to read or &ldquo;say&rdquo; a homily or sermon in the public service of the Church; especially during the times before preaching was properly understood or regulated, and was almost unknown. Even in the reign of Elizabeth it has been calculated that there were <num value="8000">8000</num> parishes in England without preaching ministers, and the <num value="2">two</num> books of Homilies by Archbishop Cranmer and Bishop Jewel, published in <datestruct value="1547--"><year reg="1547">1547</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>, were intended to supply this deficiency. By a Canon of James I. they were permitted to be read by unlicensed ministers, as Deacons, who, by the present form of ordering them, are not allowed to preach, unless they &ldquo;be thereunto licensed by the Bishop himself:&rdquo; and it is not improbable that many of the Parish-Clerks and Schoolmasters of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century had already received Deacon's orders, and were thus considered capable of &ldquo;saying a sermon.&rdquo;</NOTE>

This it is supposed might have stood on the north side of Leadennall Street, nearly opposite the gate of the old hall; since the district of Cornhill extended from the eastern end of that edifice to the Stocks Market, the site of the present Mansion House: and when the remains of that ancient crypt were discovered in Leadenhall Street, after the fire of <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, described and represented in this work, it was conjectured that they might be reliques of the older St. Andrew's Church. There are traces of this foundation in the <hi rend=italics>Inquisitiones Post Mortem</hi>, which prove it to have been situate on a spot very different to that of the present St. Andrew-Undershaft, which is in Aldgate Ward; whereas it is entered on those records for the <num value="49">49th</num> year of Edward III., <datestruct value="1375--"><year reg="1375">1375</year></datestruct>-<num value="76">76</num>, Part ii., No. <num value="28">28</num>, that Richard Pembrugge and Henry his son, possessed a tenement <hi rend=italics>in the parish of St. Andrew upon Cornhill, in the Ward of Lime Street.</hi> In the same Inquisitions, also, for the <num value="15">15th</num> year of Richard II., <datestruct value="1391--"><year reg="1391">1391</year></datestruct>-<num value="92">92</num>, No. <num value="101">101</num>, it is stated that Michael Pistoye, son and heir of Simon Pistoye, of Lombardy, possessed an inn called the Green Gate <hi rend=italics>in the parish of St. Andrew upon Cornhill, in the Ward of Lime Street</hi>, and <num value="1">one</num> tenement and <num value="9">nine</num> shops in the same ward.

Some trace of an ancient connection between <num value="2">two</num> Churches situate near each other upon Cornhill, appears, however, in the above extract, transferred to that of St. Andrew-Undershaft, since that Parish agrees to be charged with part of the expense of a cage to be erected in Cornhill Ward, from which it is separated by the broadest part of Lime Street Ward, and crossed by the Ward of Bishopsgate; though the ordinance of Sir William Capell, Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1503--"><year reg="1503">1503</year></datestruct>, directed such a prison to be set up in every Ward of the City.</NOTE> should at their joint costs, set up a Cage for Cornhill Ward, for the reclayming and shutting up of vagrant persons, untill they might according to lawe be punished.&rdquo;

<P>The present edifice being thus completed, the few additional descriptive particulars of it which are required by the annexed Views, shall be here inserted. It is situate on the same spot which it occupied before the Fire, at the angle formed by Grace-Church Street and Cornhill, excepting that about <num value="10">ten</num> feet were taken from the eastern end of it. This part fronts upon the western side of the street, and is built in the Grecian style, with a decorated pediment enclosing <num value="3">three</num> windows; beneath which are <num value="5">five</num> others, separated by Corinthian pilasters. The side of the Church in Cornhill rises from behind a long and low but handsome shop, and the south side overlooks the Churchyard and St. Peter's Alley, as exhibited in the ensuing Plate of the Exterior. By the same View it will also be seen that the body of the building is of stone, and the tower of brick, as far as the dome and spire, but the latter are of wood covered with lead: the roof is also entirely leaded over. The interior is divided into a <pb id="p.84" n="84"> Chancel, raised <num value="1">one</num> step higher than the remainder of the area; a nave containing <num value="3">three</num> aisles; and a spacious vestibule called the porch, the whole breadth of the building, under the gallery at the western end of the Church, where is situate the Vestry. A very fine arched roof is supported on <num value="8">eight</num> square piers, fronted with pilasters of the Corinthian Order, surmounted by their entablatures. A beautiful oaken screen of small fluted pillars, crosses the whole width of the Church and separates the nave from the chancel; within which is an altar-piece of the Ionic Order, with a small font placed against the south wall: the spaces on each side at the extremity of the aisles being called the North and South Chapels. At the western end is a large gallery supported by Tuscan columns containing the organ; and the whole building is wainscoted with oak <num value="10">10</num> feet in height.&mdash;The dimensions of the Church are <num value="80">80</num> feet in length, by <num value="47">47</num> in breadth, and <num value="40">40</num> in height; the steeple being <num value="140">140</num> feet high,<NOTE N="a"><P><hi rend=italics>Parentalia; or Memoirs of the Family of the Wrens</hi>, by Christopher and Stephen Wren,and Joseph Ames, Lond. <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>, fol. pp. <num value="317">317</num>.&mdash;Hatton's <hi rend=italics>New View of London</hi>, vol. ii. p. <num value="485">485</num>.&mdash;J.

About half-past <num value="10">ten</num> Mrs. Woodmason visited all the children according to her usual custom, and found them all sleeping excepting the elder, with whom she conversed: <num value="5">five</num> of them being in the nursery, over her own bedchamber in front of the house, and <num value="2">two</num> others immediately above them. She then returned to her room, and had partly undressed, but went into another chamber to bathe her feet, sending a servant into her own apartment with a glass of water. About <num value="5">five</num> minutes after she heard a violent shriek and cry of fire, upon which she ran out and saw her bed in flames: in consequence, according to a report of the period, of the light having communicated to the white drapery of the looking glass and toilette. Mrs. Woodmason hastily called out to the servant to save the children, but she in her alarm rushed <hi rend=italics>down</hi> stairs for assistance, followed by her mistress, both of them loudly exclaiming for aid; yet neither of them had the presence of mind to shut the door of the chamber in which the fire began. No answer was returned to them, and no <num value="1">one</num> came to them; the kitchen was found empty; and Mrs. Woodmason then went into the dining-room, opened a widow, and called out Fire! upon which several persons in the street promised to assist her, and desired her to open the street-door. She effected this with much difficulty, crying out for them to save her children, and was then carried senseless to a house opposite; where she remained for sometime in agonies not to be described until assured that her children were safe. This, however, was only a humane deception, since the flames soon reached the staircase, and cut off all possibility of succour or retreat; whilst the fire rushed so vehemently from the chamber-door with so dense a smoke, that those who <num value="1">first</num> entered dared not venture up to the <num value="2">second</num> floor, and the whole of the children were consumed. A want of water also for nearly an hour, allowed the conflagration to spread to the warehouse behind and the adjoining houses, and it was not until nearly <num value="3">3</num> o'clock on Saturday morning that the fire was abated.<NOTE N="c"><P><hi rend=italics>The London Chronicle</hi> from Thursday <datestruct VALUE="-01-17"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=17>17th</day></datestruct> to <num value="19">19th</num>, <datestruct value="1782--"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct>, p. <num value="72">72</num>.</NOTE> In the interim a neighbour had gone to St. James's for Mr. Woodmason, and upon his arrival, though all cried out to him that his children were safe, he was soon convinced by his own observation and the answers given to him, that they were destroyed: he found his wife in the greatest agonies, and his feelings and sufferings may be better imagined then expressed.<NOTE N="d"><P><hi rend=italics>Authentic Statement, &amp;c.</hi>&mdash;In the <hi rend=italics>Morning Herald and Daily Advertiser</hi> of Monday <datestruct VALUE="-01-21"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=21>21st</day></datestruct>, it is most absurdly and mischievously stated, that the yeoman who went to call Mr. Woodmason from the gallery at St. James's, exclaimed to him aloud, &ldquo;Mr. Woodmason come down, for your wife and <num value="6">six</num> children are all burnt in their beds!&rdquo;&mdash;The same paper denies the destruction of the children, and adds that they were all in the country at the time of the fire.</NOTE> When the wall of the house suddenly fell some other persons were killed by the overthrow.<NOTE N="e"><P><hi rend=italics>Morning Chronicle and London Advertiser</hi>, Monday <datestruct VALUE="-01-21"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=21>21st</day></datestruct>.</NOTE>

<P>In <num value="1">one</num> of the original accounts of this fire, appears a notice of the very great utility of a number of bags brought from Cornhill watch-house and used for making a dam for the water, instead of the usual slight layers of <pb id="p.86" n="86"> straw or litter, which are so easily carried away. <num value="3">Three</num> of those bags were found in less then a minute to collect a head of water sufficient to supply the pipes of <num value="4">four</num> engines, the superflux being received into a <num value="2">second</num> dam, both of which remained firm, and even served as a bridge for persons crossing in saving the goods. The want of water, however, was the cause of a complaint concerning the state of the reservoir then making opposite the north door of St. Peter's Church Cornhill; in consequence of a resolution passed at a Wardmote of Cornhill Ward.<NOTE N="a"><P>&ldquo;At a Court of Wardmote, holden for the Ward of Cornhill, the <datestruct VALUE="1781-06-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> day of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1781">1781</year></datestruct>, it was Resolved, That a Tank or Reservoir, which will hold <num value="18000">18,000</num> Gallons of Water, be erected in the Front of St. Peter's Church in Cornhill, for the more effectual extinguishing of any Fire that may happen in or near this Ward; and that the expence of making the said Tank be raised by voluntary subscription.&rdquo;&mdash;The formation of this Tank appears to have originated in a Letter addressed to the inhabitants of Cornhill by Mr John Sewell, the Bookseller, which was read at a General Vestry of St. Michael's Parish, and afterwards printed in a small quarto half-sheet,&mdash;stating the great and frequent destruction which Cornhill Ward had experienced by fire; the imperfection of the nightly watch, and the plan of a reservoir for water, to contain <num value="3230">3230</num><NOTE>The last digit of this number is illegible.</NOTE>
gallons, proposed to be erected over an intended new watch-house to be made in the cloister of St. Michael's Church. The portico of St. Peter's Church was then pointed out as an improvement, which would admit of a reservoir containing <num value="5940">5940</num> gallons of water, and last nearly an hour at the rate of <num value="100">100</num> gallons per minute; the usual discharge of a large engine. This latter was succeeded by another from Mr. Edward Nairne, the Optician, opposite the Exchange, dated <datestruct VALUE="1780-12-21"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=21>21st</day>, <year reg=1780>1780</year></datestruct>, also printed separately in <num value="4">four</num> small quarto pages, which proposed as an addition, &ldquo;the building of at least <num value="4">four</num> tanks or cisterns of brick laid, and lined withinside with terras, under the high-way in the high-Street of Cornhill, or any other part of the Ward,&rdquo; to hold any quantity of water and to be filled by a pipe from the Thames, or New-River water-works. These tanks were proposed to be built like an arched coal-cellar, with a funnel in the pavement as an entry by which they might be repaired and cleaned, and it was calculated that <num value="1">one</num> holding <num value="6000">6000</num> gallons would not cost more than <num value="46">46</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> the walls and arch being a brick and a half in thickness. The letter also replied to some objections which had been made to the design, proposed the means of paying for it, and noticed the great benefit which might be derived from large public tanks erected in the principal and most elevated parts of the City; especially at the great cross formed by Cornhill, Bishopsgate Street, Grace Church Street and Leadenhall Street.</NOTE> A Defence from an inhabitant of the vicinity in the <hi rend=italics>Morning Chronicle</hi> of Friday <num value="25">25th</num>, states that the engines were then completed, and would be fixed so soon as liberty could be obtained of the City and grants from the Water- Companies, memorials for which had been presented and were waiting the usual forms and meetings of public bodies. Had the reservoir been quite ready, observes this notice, &ldquo;nothing more could have been done, there being water sufficient on turning the cocks and plugs: nothing could have saved Mr. Woodmason's house; though it may with confidence be asserted that the great and ready assistance did save the wooden buildings standing on each side, as well as those on the opposite side of the way.&rdquo; In the formation of this tank, the workmen dug through <num value="3">three</num> different strata of foundations before they came to the solid earth. These were supposed to have been the deposits of successive fires; and from the lowermost and oldest being composed of woodashes, it was assumed to be the very ancient remains of London when the whole city was built of wood. The labourers having dug below the foundation of the present Church of St. Peter, upon sinking still lower they came to the remains of a much older building; and fearing that the edifice might fall upon them, they refused to proceed unless Mr. Blackburn, the engineer, would encounter with them the hazard of the earth falling in, which he did, and some distance lower they met with a human skeleton. The undertaking was at length completed at the expense of <measure value="700l." type=currency><num value="700">700</num>l.</measure> subscribed by the adjoining Parishes and the Fire Offices; and a reservoir of water was erected, which was filled by the common Thames water-works, and furnished to the largest engine a sudden supply sufficient for all purposes till more could be obtained from fire-plugs, &amp;c. The bricks used for the walls of this tank were made for the purpose, and exactly fitted in dovetails and mortices, being wedged together in cement by the blows of a hammer. Above the tank are now erected <num value="2">two</num> broad cast-iron pillars containing the engines by which it is worked, a short distance to the east of the north door of St. Peter's Church, at the extremity of the pavement in Cornhill. These engines are wrought at certain periods that they may be in constant readiness for use; and the sum of <num value="17">17</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> is paid monthly by the Parishes of St. Michael and St. Peter, alternately, for working them, on an order signed by the Deputy of Cornhill Ward: their power and the contents of the tank are capable of floodingthe streets down to St. Mary at Axe.<NOTE N="b"><P><hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi>, <datestruct VALUE="1785-11--"><month reg="11">November</month> <year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct>, vol. lv. part ii. p. <num value="485">485</num>.</NOTE>

<hi rend=italics>Century</hi> the causes of his sequestration are thus assigned: That he refused to admit lecturers into his house; that he used to play at cards on the sabbath-day; to be often drunk; and to frequent the company of ill women in a very suspicious manner; and that he had charged the Parliament to be the cause of all the troubles and disturbances in the kingdom; as also that he had neglected his cure, and supplied it with scandalous curates. Notwithstanding which heavy charges, I have heard the late most learned and pious Bishop of St. Asaph, <num value="1">one</num> of his successors in this living (Dr. William Beveridge), say that he was an honest old gentleman. He was dispossessed of this living by the House of Commons, about <datestruct VALUE="1643-08--"><month reg="08">August</month> <year reg="1643">1643</year></datestruct>, at which time Thomas Coleman was substituted in his room by the same authority.

I am glad of the opportunity of returning you my sincere and humble thanks, for the signal favour you have done me this day in nominating me to the Rectory of St. Peter's in Cornhill: a preferment very acceptable to me upon many accounts, but most of all so as being conveyed to me by such hands as confer honour wherever they bestow a gift. Your forming so effectual an interest for me unsolicited, when I was providentially detained at a distance unable to solicit, has doubled the kindness on your part and the obligation on mine. And here I cannot but reflect on my late calamity (illness), both with grief and pleasure: with grief, because it prevented my personal address in due time to all and each of you, a service which inclination called for as well as duty; and with pleasure, because, instead of turning to my prejudice, through your generous goodness it has turned to my glory. Gentlemen, words cannot express the sentiments of my heart: permit me therefore to refer you to a more solid proof of my gratitude and respect, I mean my future conduct: the whole tendency of which shall be, by the grace of God, to promote, so far as in me lies, in my spiritual capacity, the pure and undefiled religion of Jesus Christ through whom alone we can be saved; in my civil capacity, the true interest of my King and Country and the peace of this renowned City: so doing, I humbly conceive, I shall best discharge my vast obligations to this honourable Court. Not long since, at the appointment of an honourable member of that be ch of Aldermen, good and great in every view, I was gratified with a temporary relation to this ample City, as Chaplain to Sir Francis Child when Lord Mayor; but henceforward, and from this memorable day, I shall proudly deem myself her adopted son, devoted to her for ever; and shall strive to keep pace with the warmest of her children in zeal for her liberty and welfare, beseeching the Almighty that no weapon formed against her may ever prosper.&rdquo;&mdash;Dr. Middleton preached at St. Peter's for the <num value="1">first</num> time on Sunday <datestruct VALUE="1734-12-22"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=22>22nd</day>, <year reg=1734>1734</year></datestruct>, from Psalm lviii. <num value="2">2</num>, to a congregation which crowded the pews by <num value="9">9</num> o'clock in the morning; but his printed discourses are <hi rend=italics>The Daty and Excellence of Thanksgiving;</hi> Psal. cvi. <num value="48">48</num>.

<div2 type=section id="c.24.43"><HEAD>Library and School of St. Peter's upon Cornhill.</HEAD>

<P>The authority of Joceline of Furness is cited by Stow for the very great antiquity of the Library formerly belonging to this Church, the establishment of which is attributed to Elvanus, <num value="2">second</num> Archbishop of London; who is also said to have converted to Christianity many Druids learned in the Pagan law. The apartment called the Library, was most probably situate at the western end of the building, about the <num value="1">first</num> story of the tower; or in an edifice adjoining to it, with a gable end, <num value="2">two</num> large arched windows, and an embattled wall and chimney, rising above the roof of the Church, shewn in the ancient view of Cornhill, and the Survey of the Parish of St. Martin Outwich already referred to. It appears to have been certainly <num value="1">one</num> of the oldest parts of the structure, which Stow considered to be the steeple; and he adds that it was &ldquo;of old time builded of stone,&rdquo;&mdash;meaning probably about a century or more before his own period;&mdash;&ldquo;and of late repaired with brick by the executors of Sir John Crosby, Alderman,<NOTE N="b"><P>Sir John Crosby Alderman and Sheriff of London in <datestruct value="1470--"><year reg="1470">1470</year></datestruct>, the <num value="10">tenth</num> of Edward IV., by whom he was knighted in the following year. He died in <datestruct value="1475--"><year reg="1475">1475</year></datestruct> and was buried in the Church of St. Helen, Bishopsgate, to which he was a great benefactor, and in which a fine altar-tomb was erected to his memory bearing his effigy with that of his lady. His arms were, Sa. a chevron Erm. between <num value="3">3</num> rams passant Arg.</NOTE> as his arms on the south end do witness. This Library,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;hath been of late time, to wit within these <num value="50">fifty</num> years, well furnished of books, John Leland viewed and commended them;<NOTE N="c"><P>It is probable that the following memorandum of books, contained in Leland's <hi rend=italics>Collectanea</hi>, vol. iii.

<P>The extent and accuracy, the beauty and ingenuity, of this record having been already fully described, it will be seen that the recompense paid to the writer was extremely moderate, even for the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century. It appears, however, to have amply satisfied William Averell the Schoolmaster, by whom the manuscript was written for his kinsman the Parish Clerk of the same name, since he left in <num value="1">one</num> part of it a memorial of his thankful and simple-hearted content; beside the many verses written in various parts of it, which evidently shew the work to have been a labour of Love. In the large initial letter of the title to the Burial-Register, the writer has introduced a device entitled by him &ldquo;Emblema Auereli;&rdquo; consisting of a ton, the ordinary mark for Cornhill, in which is planted a tall stem ending in an heraldic rose; referring perhaps both to the prosperous condition in which Providence had placed him in that spot, and the connection of the flower with the name of Averell, or April. About the centre of the stalk is a square tablet bearing the letters W. A., and in a border enclosing them the inscription <foreign lang=Greek>*su\ o( *qeo\s a)ntilh/ptwr mou= ei)= ei)pe\ *a)ne\r</foreign>ZZZ. Beneath the letter is written in vermillion, &ldquo;The Lord hath giuen mee wine to comfort my hart, and made mee to flourish like the rose;&rdquo; with references to Psal. civ. <num value="15">15</num>. Esai. iv. Ecclesiasticus xxiv. <num value="16">16</num>. xxxix. <num value="13">13</num>, and on the other side is written i.

<P>We are indebted to Hollar for having left us a memorial of the exterior of this church, before the rude and indiscriminating hand of Modern Improvement had obliterated those appropriate and venerable features, so peculiarly characteristic of <hi rend=italics>Gothic</hi> buildings. The original is <num value="1">one</num> of a set etched by that laborious artist to illustrate Dugdale's Monasticon. 
<P>From comparing the print (though but indifferently executed) with the south side of the church, as it now appears, we shall see how great a sacrifice has been made in late attempts to <hi rend=italics>beautify</hi> this edifice, as it is erroneously styled, and how rarely such attempts conduce to the real improvement of a building, or accord with the original design of the architect. 
<P>Exclusive of the inappropriate coating of brick, which the whole of this side of the nave has received, we observe the mere outline of the windows only remaining, a want of liberality, or taste, having removed all those distinguishing ornaments which filled up their insides, and without which they appear mere blanks. 
<P>The window at the end of the south transept exhibits still stronger marks of this spoliation. It contained <num value="5">five</num> smaller arches, or lights, within the great arch, which reached about the height of the spring of the latter. The space above contained a beautiful circular light, resembling a St. Catharine's wheel, and <num value="2">two</num> smaller ones of the same form, with <hi rend=italics>quatrefoil</hi> ornaments; the whole of the remainder being filled up with <hi rend=italics>trefoils</hi> and beautiful tracery. The pediment above was adorned with a <num value="2">second</num> window, of smaller dimensions, apparently pointed, divided into <num value="3">three</num> lights, and decorated likewise with tracery. Nothing can be more flat and tasteless than the appearance of this part of the building at present. 
<P>The beauty of the whole exterior of this side of the church, and particularly the elegant south porch, have suffered much from the raising of the church-yard. <pb id="p.97" n="97">

<P>This Church, founded on the site of the old Priory Church of St. Mary Overie, was newly erected about the year <datestruct value="1400"><year reg="1400">1400</year></datestruct>, towards which, John Gower, the <num value="1">first</num> celebrated English poet,<NOTE N="*"><P>There is a very good portrait of Gower, engraved from the monument, by Trotter, and has for a companion the head of John Lydgate, monk of Bury, who was likewise a poet and co-temporary with the former.</NOTE> was a great benefactor. In the year <datestruct value="1469"><year reg="1469">1469</year></datestruct>, the roof of the middle aisle fell down; and in <datestruct value="1539--"><year reg="1539">1539</year></datestruct>, the Priory was surrendered to Henry VIII., valued at <num value="624">624</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> per annum. About Christmas after this, the inhabitants of the <hi rend=italics>Borough</hi> purchased the said Priory Church, which was by charter made for the joint use, both of this and the parishioners of St. Margaret on the Hill, and called it by the name of St. Saviour's, Southwark, the chapel of St. Mary Magdalene, on the south side, being laid to this, thereby enlarging the same, as is yet very apparent; and in the <num value="32">32</num>d of Henry VIII. the charter was confirmed by act of Parliament, constituting the churchwardens a corporation. In the year <datestruct value="1618"><year reg="1618">1618</year></datestruct>, a screen at the west end was set up; anno <datestruct value="1621"><year reg="1621">1621</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1622--"><year reg="1622">1622</year></datestruct>, the Church was in many places repaired; the new chapel at the east end, which had been for above <num value="60">sixty</num> years let to <hi rend=italics>bakers</hi>, was in <datestruct value="1624--"><year reg="1624">1624</year></datestruct> restored again to the Church, and <num value="200">200</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> laid out in the repair, all at the charge of the parish: the account of which is preserved on a table under the tower, in these words: &ldquo;This Church was laid throughout with stone, new pewed and galleried, the great vault sunk, the pulpit and altar-piece erected, the communion-table railed, and set with black and white marble, the choir inclosed by gates, the south and west windows opened and enlarged, the whole new glazed, the <num value="6">sixth</num> and <num value="7">seventh</num> bells cast, the chapel paved, and all the church cleansed, whitewashed, and beautified, at the charge of the parish, anno <datestruct value="1703"><year reg="1703">1703</year></datestruct>.&rdquo; 
<P>It is a noble, spacious Church, with <num value="3">three</num> aisles running from east to west, and a cross aisle, after the manner of a cathedral, and is probably the longest parochial church in England. It is built in the antient Gothic order, both pillars, arches, roof, and windows; the roof of the body of the Church and chancel is supported by <num value="26">twenty-six</num> pillars, <num value="13">thirteen</num> in a range; that of <hi rend=italics>our Lady</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>New Chapel</hi> (now used for the Bishop's Court), with <num value="6">six</num> smaller pillars; and that of the former Church of St. <hi rend=italics>Mary Magdalene</hi> (on the south side), by <num value="6">six</num> pillars like the last. There are galleries in the walls of the choir, adorned with pillars and arches, as in <hi rend=italics>Westminster Abbey.</hi> The tower is erected on <num value="4">four</num> very strong pillars, over the meeting of the middle aisle with the cross aisle; at each of the <num value="4">four</num> angles of which tower is a spire, all built of stone, and the walls of the Church of brick and boulder; the roof is covered with lead and tile; the floor well paved with stone, and the floor of the chancel <num value="1">one</num> step higher; the pulpit and communion-table are of excellent wainscot, finely finniered, the latter having enrichments of a glory, cherubims, doves, &amp;c. placed on a fine black and white marble foot-pace, inclosed with rail and bannister, and with a wainscot fence, having iron spikes; the altar-piece is very stately and beautiful, in altitude about <num value="35">thirty-five</num> feet of wainscot; it consists of an upper and lower part&mdash;the latter is adorned with <num value="4">four</num> fluted columns, and their entablature of the Corinthian order; the intercolumns are the commandments, done in black letters, on large slabs of white and veined marble, under a glory and triangular pediments, and between <num value="4">four</num> attic pilasters, with an acroteria of the figures of <num value="7">seven</num> golden candlesticks replenished with tapers, all which ornament is under a spacious circular pediment belonging to the said Corinthian columns, which are placed between the <hi rend=italics>Pater Noster</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Creed</hi>, curiously depencilled in gold letters on black, each under a pediment, and between small pilasters. The upper part is adorned with <num value="4">four</num> pedestals, and between them <num value="2">two</num> attic pilasters, with a small compass pediment; on these <num value="6">six</num>, and <num value="1">one</num> on the middle of the pediment, are placed <num value="7">seven</num> lamps; and in the centre of this upper part is a glory, in the shape of a dove descending, within a circular group of cherubims, all very spacious and finely painted, presented to the view, as it were, by the withdrawing of a rich curtain, painted in festoons; behind all which is a light window, the arch whereof is enriched with the figures of <num value="6">six</num> swans and an angel. The organ-case is also of oak, very lofty, elevated on <num value="10">ten</num> square pillars, the upper part whereof is adorned with <num value="3">three</num> Fames, carved, standing in full proportion, about <num value="42">forty-two</num> feet from the area of the aisle. 
<P>There are <num value="2">two</num> handsome inner door-cases, opening into the choir, north and south, and an iron <num value="1">one</num> at the west end of the Church, under the organ; also an outer door-case, on the south side.

The northern part of this neighbourhood is so completely blocked up with the old buildings of Montague Close, and adjoining alleys and courts, that it is with extreme difficulty any thing like a sight of the Church in the direction the view here given represents, can be obtained, and it became an additional inducement to insert it, never before being engraved. 
<P>The vignette is composed from the most prominent and striking of the monumental antiquities still remaining within this sacred edifice; the most particular of which are the effigies of the Knight Crusader and old Overie, father of its original foundress, MARY OVERIE. 
<div2 type=section id="c.26.44"><HEAD>Gateway of St. Mary's Priory, and St. Mary Overie's, Otherwise St. Saviour's Dock, Southwark.</HEAD>

<P>The Priory, of which the gateway at present is the only remains, was founded previous to the Norman Conquest, by a maiden named Mary, for sisters; unto the which house and sisters she left the profits of a cross ferry over the Thames, there kept, before that any bridge was built; this house was after, by <hi rend=italics>Swithin</hi>, a noble lady, converted into a college of priests, who, in place of the ferry, built a bridge of timber, and from time to time kept the same in good repair; and lastly, the same bridge was built of stone, and then, in the year <datestruct value="1106"><year reg="1106">1106</year></datestruct>, was the Church of St. Mary Overie founded for canons regular, by <hi rend=italics>William Pont de le Arche</hi>, and <hi rend=italics>William Dauncy</hi>, Knights, <hi rend=italics>Normans.</hi>

<P>The Priory was burnt about the year <datestruct value="1207"><year reg="1207">1207</year></datestruct>, wherefore the canons did found an Hospital near unto their Priory, where divine service was performed until the Priory was repaired, which Hospital was after (by consent of <hi rend=italics>Peter de la Roche</hi>, Bishop of Winchester) removed into the land of <hi rend=italics>Anicius</hi>, Archdeacon of Surry, in the year <datestruct value="1228"><year reg="1228">1228</year></datestruct>, a place where the water was more plentiful, and the air more wholesome, and was dedicated to St. Thomas. 
<P>St. Saviour's Dock is situate between Winchester House and Montague Close, and has its principal communication with the Borough, through Church Street, which it immediately fronts; the neighbourhood consists of very old houses, straggling and irregularly built, and but meanly inhabited; near the Dock was the prison belonging to the liberty of the Bishop of <hi rend=italics>Winchester</hi>, called the Clink Liberty, where he had his house to reside in when he came to <hi rend=italics>London.</hi> In the last century, St. Saviour's Dock was, and still continues a very considerable place for the landing and unloading of goods, and likewise of account for the coal trade; and, being so much resorted to by waggons, carts, and trucks, rendered the place and adjoining streets and lanes incumbered, dirty, and not so well inhabited. Montague Close hath several turnings leading to the Borough: <hi rend=italics>Pepper Alley</hi>, however, is the principal; as may be seen in the plan, near which are the <num value="8">eight</num> almshouses, erected and endowed in the year <datestruct value="1771"><year reg="1771">1771</year></datestruct>, at the sole expense of ALICE-SHAW-OVERMAIN, for the benefit of <num value="4">four</num> widows and <num value="4">four</num> maidens. The Priory of St. Mary Overie, after its suppression by Henry VIII. was valued at <num value="624">624</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> per annum, after which the conventual church was purchased by the inhabitants of St. Mary Magdalene and St. Margaret, and the whole consolidated under the name of the parish of St. Saviour; by which title the Dock is now more generally distinguished than by its antient denomination of St. Mary Overie's. 
<P>In Montague Close it is said the gunpowder-plot was discovered by the miscarriage of a letter, which fell by mistake into the hands of Lord Monteagle, who at that period resided in this place; but that the letter was intended for him is evident from the inscription on the back, which is, &ldquo;To the Right Honourable the Lord Mow'teagle.&rdquo; Lord Monteagle had a sister married to Thomas Habington, of Hinlip, in Worcestershire, who was concerned in various plots for releasing Mary Queen of Scots, and setting up a papist to succeed her; and was condemned to die for concealing Garnet and Oldcorn, the Jesuits, concerned in the gunpowder-plot, but was pardoned at the intercession of his wife and Lord Monteagle. Tradition, in Worcestershire, says Mrs. Habington was the person who wrote the letter to her brother which led to the discovery. Percy, the conspirator, whose picture is at Hinlip, was very intimate both with Habington and Lord Monteagle, and is supposed by Guthrie to have written the letter; but the style of it seems to be that of <num value="1">one</num> who had only heard some dark hints of the business, which was perhaps the case of Mrs. Habington, and not of <num value="1">one</num> who was a principal mover of the whole, as was Percy. Montague Close for a long time after enjoyed several privileges in consequence of the happy discovery made by Lord Monteagle; particularly whoever dwelt there were exempted from having any actions of debt, trespass, &amp;c., served upon them. But this privilege, as also those of other places, has been suppressed by act of Parliament 
<P>Montague House is still remaining, but in a very ruinous state. <pb id="p.99" n="99">

<P>This House or Palace was founded and built by <hi rend=italics>William Giffard</hi>, Bishop of <hi rend=italics>Winchester</hi>, about the year <datestruct value="1107"><year reg="1107">1107</year></datestruct>, the <num value="7">seventh</num> of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> the <num value="1">First</num>, upon a plot of ground pertaining to the Prior of <hi rend=italics>Bermondsey</hi>, as appears by a writ directed to the Barons of the Exchequer, in the year <datestruct value="1366"><year reg="1366">1366</year></datestruct>, the <num value="41">41st</num> of <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi> the <num value="3">Third</num> (the Bishop's see being void), for <measure value="8l." type=currency><num value="8">eight</num> pounds</measure>, due to the Monks of <hi rend=italics>Bermondsey</hi>, for the Bishop of Winchester's lodging in <hi rend=italics>Southwark.</hi> This was a very fair house, well repaired, and had a large wharf and a landing-place, called the Bishop of Winchester's Stairs. The Bishop had also the lordship and manor of Southwark, which came to King Edward VI. upon Bishop <hi rend=italics>Gardiner's</hi> deprivation; and anno <datestruct value="1552"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct>, there was an exchange made between the Lord Marquis of Northampton and the King, whereby that Lord had the lordship and manor of <hi rend=italics>Southwark</hi>, and the King had the chief or capital mesne of Lambeth, belonging to the Duke of <hi rend=italics>Norfolk</hi>, attainted of treason. The said Marquis built the gallery at <hi rend=italics>Winchester</hi> House. In Queen <hi rend=italics>Mary's</hi>
time it was restored to the see, and so it continued until its sale in <datestruct value="1649--"><year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct>. 
<P>In the year <datestruct value="1426"><year reg="1426">1426</year></datestruct> a great and dangerous quarrel happened between the Duke of <hi rend=italics>Gloucester</hi>, the Protector of England during the minority of <hi rend=italics>Henry</hi> VI. and the haughty Bishop of <hi rend=italics>Winchester</hi> (Cardinal Beaufort), his uncle, and great uncle to the King, which had like to have involved the whole nation in blood. 
<P>The Protector having received intelligence of the Bishop's design to surprise the city of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> in the night of the Lord Mayor's day, when the citizens were engaged in banquetting and rejoicing in honour of their new magistrate, he sent for the Mayor, and strictly enjoined him, for the safety of the city, immediately to raise such a body of citizens, as were sufficient to baffle all the attempts that should be made against them. This information soon appeared to be well-grounded; for the next morning a great number of the Bishop's faction endeavoured to enter the city from <hi rend=italics>Southwark</hi>, by the bridge; and, being denied admittance, were so highly enraged, that they assembled a great number of archers and men at arms, in order to force their way. The citizens immediately shut up their shops, and, arming with the greatest expedition, ran to the bridge to oppose the assailants, and would have sallied out upon their enemies, had they not been prevented by the prudent conduct of <hi rend=italics>John Coventry</hi>, the Mayor, and his brethren the Aldermen, which happily prevented the effusion of much blood. The Prince of Portugal, who happened at this time to be on his travels in <hi rend=italics>England</hi>, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, generously undertook to compose the difference between the Protector and Bishop, but their endeavours proving unsuccessful, the Duke of <hi rend=italics>Bedford</hi>, Regent of France, and brother to the Protector, came over to accommodate the affair. The artful and ambitious Bishop made his story as plausible as possible, to gain the <hi rend=italics>Regent</hi> to his party, and never ceased persecuting the good Protector until his death, which happened in <datestruct value="1447--"><year reg="1447">1447</year></datestruct>, not without shrewd suspicion of being poisoned by the Bishop, or his procurement. Winchester House had another inhabitant equally cruel and persecuting with Cardinal Beaufort, in the person of Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester in the reigns of Henry VIII. Edward VI. and Queen Mary, who, though not outwardly so merciless as Bonnor, Bishop of London, was nothing behind him in persecuting to the flames all of the reformed religion he could not convert to his bigotted way of thinking. He was equally mean in adversity, as haughty and imperious in prosperity. On the accession of Edward VI. he was imprisoned in the Fleet Prison, and afterwards committed to the Tower, though he subscribed to all the alterations in religion by Edward VI. by whom he was always regarded as a secret enemy to the Reformation, and was therefore deprived of his bishopric; but restored by Queen Mary, who made him Lord Chancellor and Prime Minister. He was distinguished for his extensive learning, insinuating address, and profound policy; the masterpiece of which was the treaty of marriage betwixt Philip and Mary, which was an effectual bar to the ambitious designs of the former, as there was no question but Philip intended, if possible, to make himself master of the kingdom by marrying Mary. When the Queen was supposed to be far advanced in her pregnancy, Philip applied to the parliament to be constituted regent during the minority of the child, and offered to give ample security to surrender the regency when he or she should be of age to govern. The motion was warmly debated in the House of Peers, and he was likely to carry his point, when the Lord Paget stood up, and said, &ldquo;Pray who shall sue the King's bond?&rdquo; This laconic speech had its intended effect, and the debate was concluded in the negative. 
<P>Winchester House continued to be the residence of the Prelates of that see, during their attendance in parliament, until the breaking out of the civil wars (<datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>); when episcopacy was put down, and this Palace became for a time a prison for the royalists. <datestruct VALUE="1649-09-26"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=26>26</day>, <year reg=1649>1649</year></datestruct>, the Parliament Commissioners sold it to Thomas Walker, of Camberwell, for <num value="4380">4380</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> King Charles II. in <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>, restored it to the see of Winchester. But on the desertion of this Palace, the Prelates of Winchester had another allotted to them at Chelsea. 
<P>The Clink, or manor of Southwark, is still under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Winchester; who, besides a court-leet, keeps a court of record on the <hi rend=italics>Bankside</hi>, by his steward and bailiff, for pleas of debt, trespasses, &amp;c. Much of Winchester House was standing in the early part of the year <datestruct value="1814"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, tenanted by different families, or converted into warehouses. But on the evening of Sunday, <datestruct VALUE="1814-08-28"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=28>28th</day>, <year reg=1814>1814</year></datestruct>, an alarming and destructive fire broke out on this spot, which spread devastation around. The beautiful Gothic hall, which had for many years been surrounded with mean buildings, on this occasion presented a most magnificent appearance; the columns of flame which ascended through the exquisitely carved stone-work circular window to the clouds, leaves all description of effect far behind. The Plate of the north-west view exhibits the ruins a few days after the conflagration; the spires of St. Mary Overies, which are seen in the distance, gave a surprising reflection on the scene the night of the accident, and added considerably to impress the mind of the spectator with the sublime appearance of the whole. <pb id="p.101" n="101"> 
<div1 type="chapter" n="28" id="c.28"><HEAD>Chapels at the Eastern End of the Church of St. Saviour, Southwark: 
<LB>In the Ward of Bridge Without, in the County of Surrey.</HEAD>

<P>This most splendid and interesting edifice, in its magnitude and arrangement is little less spacious and complete than a regular Cathedral. It is esteemed the largest Parochial Church in Great Britain, being <num value="300">300</num> feet in length, cruciform in shape, and once comprised within it a nave, choir, exterior side-aisles, transepts, the Church or Chapel of St. Margaret on the south of the choir, the Chapel of St. John, afterwards the vestry, at the north-east corner, and <num value="2">two</num> Retro-Chapels at the extreme east; <num value="1">one</num> for morning prayers, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, now so extensively known under the name of the Lady Chapel, and another smaller, lately projecting from it, called the Bishop's Chapel, from containing the vault and monument of Launcelot Andrews, Bishop of Winchester. A general account of this edifice has been already given, and the present notices are intended for the illustration of the Chapels at the eastern end; excepting that their history cannot be separated from that of the late beautiful and meritorious restoration of the Church itself. In the <num value="2">two</num> modern Exterior Views the former of those Chapels is represented with <num value="2">two</num> gables, and a covered turret. in the back-ground; and the Bishop's Chapel is seen projecting from it on the south-east. The Eastern View is shewn to have been taken during Mr. Gwilt's fine restoration of the choir of St. Saviour's Church, contracted for in <datestruct VALUE="1822-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>, during the formation of the new and beautiful eastern rose window, and before the erection of the rich foliated cross upon the gable above it. 
<P>With respect to the history of the Lady Chapel, it is supposed that it cannot be older than the rebuilding of a great part of St. Saviour's Church, after a fire early in the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century.<NOTE N="a"><P>&ldquo;This Priory was burned about the year <datestruct value="1207"><year reg="1207">1207</year></datestruct>; wherefore the Priors and Canons did found an Hospital near unto their Priory, where they celebrated Mass until the Priory was repaired.&rdquo;&mdash;Stow's <hi rend=italics>Survey of London.</hi> Edit. by the Rev.

It has been conjectured that these arches were at <num value="1">first</num> open and then filled up with masonry, to oppose the currents of air which passed into the Church, through the long avenue of the eastern chapels. A small doorway with a very flat pointed arch, within a shallow recess ornamented with gothic panels, in a segmental head, was subsequently constructed in the lower part of the arch; whilst the ornamented tops were merely closed by stone, inserted behind the tracery: the ancient altar-screen was afterwards erected as another and more effectual defence. <hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi>, vol. cii. part ii. p. <num value="105">105</num>.

<P>About the year <datestruct value="1615"><year reg="1615">1615</year></datestruct> the choir of St. Saviour's appears to have been <num value="1">first</num> enclosed by <num value="3">three</num> galleries on the north, south and across the middle-aisle at the entrance, the latter being in the place of the ancient rood-loft; and in <datestruct value="1618--"><year reg="1618">1618</year></datestruct> a screen was erected at the western door. In <datestruct value="1621--"><year reg="1621">1621</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1622--"><year reg="1622">1622</year></datestruct>, many parts of the building were renewed: the whole north side was strengthened and beautified, &ldquo;with a substantial and very artificial rough-cast: and the other side was plastered and whited:&rdquo; in <datestruct value="1624--"><year reg="1624">1624</year></datestruct>, as already stated, the Virgin Mary's Chapel was repaired and paved; and in <datestruct value="1689--"><year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct> the tower was renewed and the pinnacles were rebuilt, as appears by the date pierced in the vanes. In the beginning of the eighteenth century another repair took place, which entirely destroyed the little that remained of the original cathedral appearance of the interior; though Strype records the Church to have been at this time &ldquo;lately repaired and beautified most splendidly,&rdquo; which &ldquo;it is said cost the Parish <num value="2600">2,600</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> and that well laid out.&rdquo; The old monuments were all refreshed and new painted, a great deal of wainscoting was erected; but the most particular account of the improvements were inscribed upon a table suspended against a pillar, which stated that &ldquo;This Church was laid throughout with stone; new pewed and galleried; the Great Vault sunk; the Pulpit and Altar-piece erected; the Communion-Table railed, and set with black and white marble; the Choir enclosed by gates; the South and West Windows enlarged; the whole new glazed; the <num value="6">Sixth</num> and <num value="7">Seventh</num> Bells cast; and all the Church cleansed, white-washed, and beautified, at the charge of the Parish, Anno <datestruct value="1703"><year reg="1703">1703</year></datestruct>.&rdquo;<NOTE N="g"><P><hi rend=italics>Hist. of Surrey</hi>, vol. iii. p. <num value="571">571</num>. Strvpe's Stow's <hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, Vol. II. book iv. chap. i. pp. <num value="10">10</num>, <num value="11">11</num>. The inscription is there stated to be hanging against the pulpit.</NOTE> Previously to the erection of this altar-piece, the eastern and of the choir was terminated by a beautiful screen of white stone, with niches, tabernacles, &amp;c. but this was entirely covered over by a dark and heavy architectural design, with oaken columns, enclosing the Decalogue, Creed, and Lord's Prayer, with figures of Moses and Aaron and flying cherubim, and terminated above by candlesticks and tall blazing urns: as represented in the annexed View of the Interior of the Choir of this Church. It is also most probable that the pointed roof over the choir was then taken away, and a leaden flat substituted for it; that the stately gable over the south transept was changed into a pantile hipped roof; and all the rich tracery of the window beneath it destroyed. In <datestruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></datestruct> considerable repairs appear to have been executed in the nave; and that was possibly the period when the embattled parapets on the exterior walls of the nave, western towers, and south aisle, represented in the annexed copy of Hollar's View of this Church,&mdash;were removed, and the external stone-work cased with brick. Probably about the same time the northern front of the north transept was taken down, and a substitute erected of timber framework covered with geometrical tiles, as an enclosure of the <num value="2">two</num> bays. Farther destruction under the appearance of repair was <pb id="p.103" n="103"> committed in <datestruct value="1735--"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>, in the south transept, the rose windows at the east end of the choir, and some of the finest parts of the tracery in the <num value="6">six</num> east and west front windows. 
<P>Having thus declined to that disgraceful condition of dilapidation and neglect in which this building appeared at the commencement of the present century, the greater part of it was then found to be almost in that state of decay when an edifice will only remain without falling; for much of the fabric had been originally constructed of Surrey free-stone, which had suffered in a more than ordinary degree from time and the weather. At length a committee of the parishioners was appointed for repairing the Church, but it was not until <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct> that a commencement was actually made by Mr. John Crawford, then Church-Warden, by a repair of the tower, which was confided to Mr George Gwilt, Sen. This part was then spilt in every direction from the violent vibration of the bells, and exhibited fissures <num value="3">three</num> and <num value="4">four</num> inches broad. The pinnacles and embattled parapets were therefore rebuilt, several new windows were inserted in the bell-loft, and belfry, and the tower itself was secured by cast-iron ties of <num value="3">three</num> tiers in height, so concealed within the masonry as not to be perceptible, and so contrived as not to hazard the work by contraction or expansion. In <datestruct VALUE="1821-05--"><month reg="05">May</month> <year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>. when a design was proposed of restoring the choir, a project was brought forward of building an entirely new church to fit the old tower; which, however, was rejected by a large majority of the parishioners, and in <datestruct VALUE="1822-03--"><month reg="03">March</month> <year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>, a contract was made for extensively repairing, or rather rebuilding, the choir; since the roof was removed and the greater part of the walls. This was also executed by Mr. Gwilt, who took down the eastern end of the Church to the clere-story, and designed and erected that which now appears. It consists of an enriched gable with an elaborate cross clechee-floree on the summit,<NOTE N="a"><P>On the pedestal of this ornament is engraven the following inscription.&mdash;&ldquo;This Cross, the Last Stone towards the Rebuilding of the East End of the Choir of this Church, was Laid in the Presence of the Wardens, and Gentlemen composing the Committee of Church Repairs, by George Sadler, Esq.

At the sides are staircase turrets, ornamented with niches and crowned with pinnacles; and in the principal centre of the eastern end is inserted a new triple lancet-window, of the richest style of the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century, as being more adapted to the general age of the Church, than the broad-arched window of <num value="5">five</num> lights, of the time of Henry VII., represented in the annexed Interior View, which existed here until this repair. Over the whole of the vaulting of the choir, was erected a new cast iron roof covered with copper, the piers of the flying-buttresses on each side were newly cased with stone, and their arches entirely rebuilt; and pinnacles and finials were added to the abutting-piers: it is probable that the latter had never been completed before, since there were originally <num value="3">three</num> of them on the south side and only <num value="2">two</num> on the north. The principal part of the modern masonry consists of a sharp girt-stone from Houghtree, near Kirkstall Abbey, Yorkshire; of which the quoins and mouldings are formed, the remainder of the facing being made out with surface-flints from the high-lands in various parts of Surrey.&mdash;At this time also, the Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene on the south side of the choir, represented in the annexed copy of Hollar's View,&mdash;was entirely taken away; but it had never possessed any striking beauty, and was defaced by the inappropriate alterations made in it about the end of the reign of James I. The open side of the choir was then enclosed with masonry upon the model of the ancient north-side; and the windows of the side-aisles were built entirely new, and a new door was added. The whole of these noble repairs did not greatly exceed the sum of <measure value="17000l." type=currency><num value="17000">17,000</num>l.</measure>, including the tower; and throughout the restoration the architect carefully adhered to the original building, wherever the details could be traced or ancient materials be discovered to guide him.<NOTE N="b"><P>The whole of the above account of the repairs of St. Saviour's Church, has been abridged from an excellent historical paper on that edifice, inserted in the <num value="2">Second</num> Series of the <hi rend=italics>Retrospective Review</hi>, Part ii. <datestruct VALUE="1827-12--"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, art. viii. pp. <num value="316">316</num>-<num value="322">322</num>.</NOTE>

<P>The restoration of the transepts of St. Saviour's Church was commenced about the end of <datestruct VALUE="1830-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, from the designs of Mr. Robert Wallace, who succeeded Mr. Gwilt as architect to this edifice. In both of the buildings he added groined roofs, and introduced in the south transept an imitation of that circular window which was discovered in the ruins of Winchester Palace, after the fire there in <datestruct VALUE="1841-08-28"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=28>28th</day>, <year reg=1841>1841</year></datestruct>; and of which <num value="2">two</num> representations are given in the annexed Plate of that structure. About <datestruct VALUE="1830-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, the Bishop's Chapel was taken away from the eastern end of the Lady Chapel, and the arch of entrance built up; but when the whole of the intended repairs were nearly finished, it was found that the roof of the nave was so much dilapidated as to require the parishioners to discontinue using that part for divine service. After the edifice had been closed for upwards of <num value="3">three</num> months, a vestry held on <datestruct VALUE="-05-3"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=3>3rd</day></datestruct> and <num value="10">10th</num>, <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>, came to the following Resolutions: &ldquo;That the choir, and north and south transepts, be enclosed to the eastern part of the Church, for divine service; and the pews situate in the nave be removed into such parts of the Church for the accommodation of the inhabitants.&mdash;That the organ be removed over the Communion, or any other part of the east end that the Wardens may think proper, but not out of the Church.&mdash;That the whole of the roof, from the western door to the end of the tower, called the nave, consisting of ceiling, roof, walls and pillars, as far as dangerous, be sold and cleared away; the remainder of the walls, pillars, and family vaults, to be left open to the weather.&rdquo;<NOTE N="c"><P><hi rend=italics>Morning Herald</hi>, Friday, <datestruct VALUE="1831-05-13"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=13>13th</day>, <year reg=1831>1831</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> The roof thus destroyed was a fine specimen of the architecture of the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century, and possessed the striking peculiarity of having the corbels whence the ribs of the arches sprang placed perpendicularly over the columns. Those columns had been already banded with iron, and the walls were green and dark with apparent decay, though it is said that some of the ancient timbers were still in a fine state of preservation; but in pursuance of the above order the organ was removed to form a temporary termination to the choir, and the nave was uncovered and exposed; in which lamentable state it still continues, <datestruct VALUE="1834-08--"><month reg="08">August</month> <year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>, not unlike the half-ruined edifice of the Cathedral of Landaff. 
<P>The very laudable, zealous, and persevering efforts made for the preservation of the Lady Chapel at the eastern end of the Church, were, however, completely successful; though it was for some time earnestly debated whether it should be destroyed or restored. But even in the vestry the design of demolition was opposed, and on <datestruct VALUE="1832-01-28"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=28>28th</day>, <year reg=1832>1832</year></datestruct>, a numerous general meeting for the preservation of the structure took place at the Freemasons' Tavern, at which a series of Resolutions was passed to that effect. The principal of them were, That the few remaining reliques of Gothic, or early English pointed style, of architecture in this kingdom, are replete with interest: That the Chapel of Our Lady in St. Saviour's Church, is a splendid specimen of that style of architecture: That as the Parish of St. Saviour has expended <measure value="30000l." type=currency><num value="30000">30,000</num>l.</measure> in the repair of this Church, of which a debt of <measure value="8000l." type=currency><num value="8000">8,000</num>l.</measure> is unpaid, it is expedient that a public subscription be commenced to enable the Parish to restore the Lady Chapel: and that a Committee be appointed to promote the restoration by soliciting public subscriptions.<NOTE N="d"><P><hi rend=italics>Proceedings at the Meeting on the subject of the Preservation and Restoration of the Lady Chapel, held at the Freemasons' Tavern.

Ricardo, Episcopo, Munificentissime Adjuvante.&rdquo;</NOTE> The <num value="2">two</num> annexed modern Exterior Views of this Church, will convey an accurate notion of the appearance of the outside of the Lady Chapel before this restoration; excepting that it then shewed <num value="4">four</num> dilapidated and tiled gables, and that the part from which the Bishop's Chapel had been removed was white, whilst the remainder was defaced and discoloured stone, coarsely repaired with brick. In taking down the arch which led into the Bishop's Chapel was discovered part of the fabric of the lancetwindow originally in that place; which became a most valuable model for the restoration of the others. In the present perfected state of this edifice, the eastern end of it exhibits the <num value="4">four</num> original gables, each surmounted by a rich cross, and containing in the point a small triple lancet window, with carved corbel-heads and columnated-mullions; with a large window of the same description below. The form of the glazing in the latter consists of large intersected circles and lozenges; with some armorial ensigns, &amp;c. in stained glass. The roofs of the Chapel are covered with lead, and the walls are of flints like those of the other restored parts of the Church, with stone mouldings and quoins: the <num value="4">four</num> buttresses, and the north-east turret containing the staircase are also restored in a similar manner; the latter having loopholes and a low cap of stone. On each side of the building also the peculiar windows have been likewise carefully copied. Within, the Lady Chapel is <num value="42">42</num> feet in length, and has the roof divided into <num value="9">nine</num> groined arches, supported by <num value="6">six</num> octangular columns, with circular shafts at their angles. When this place was formerly used for the Consistorial Court of the Bishop of Winchester, and the Visitations of the Deanery of Southwark, the north-east corner was parted off in the manner of a pew, and contained a desk, table, and elevated seat; but the remainder of the space was abandoned to the reception of lumber. 
<P>Whilst the restoration of the Chapel was in agitation, a farther difficulty appeared in the very narrow frontage to be allowed for it in the south approach forming to the New London Bridge. So early as <datestruct VALUE="1830-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, the Wardens of St. Saviour's addressed a memorial to the Bridge-Committee, soliciting a sufficient space for the exhibition of the structure, and suggesting an opening of <num value="130">130</num> feet. On <datestruct VALUE="1831-04-19"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=19>19th</day>, <year reg=1831>1831</year></datestruct>, it was resolved by the vestry that the width of <num value="60">60</num> feet, offered by the Committee, was altogether inadequate, added to which it was made a condition of that grant that the Lady Chapel should be taken down; and therefore in the following October the Wardens memorialised the Lords of the Treasury. In an interview between them, the latter appeared to be in favour of a greater opening, but on <datestruct VALUE="1832-01-24"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=24>24th</day>, <year reg=1832>1832</year></datestruct>, the Wardens were informed that not more than <num value="70">70</num> feet would be allowed, and that space only on condition of removing the Chapel, if the consent of the Bishop of Winchester could be procured. In a letter on the subject, however, the Bishop declined giving his consent to the London Bridge Company; stating that it could not be alleged that the removal of the Consistorial Court was required for public accommodation, which he viewed as the only justifiable reason for the demolition of a Church, or any part of <num value="1">one</num>.<NOTE N="c"><P><hi rend=italics>Proceedings, &amp;c.</hi> Appendix, No. ii. p. <num value="34">34</num>.</NOTE> It was then resolved to petition the Committee of the House of Commons appointed on the Bill for Improving the Approaches to the New London Bridge; by which it was decided, on <datestruct VALUE="1832-02-29"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=29>29th</day>, <year reg=1832>1832</year></datestruct>, after <num value="4">four</num> days deliberation and by a majority of <num value="17">17</num> to <num value="3">3</num>, that the opening to St. Saviour's Church should be <num value="130">130</num> feet instead of <num value="70">70</num>, as proposed by the original framers of the Bill.<NOTE N="d"><P><hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi>, <datestruct VALUE="1832-02--"><month reg="02">Feb.</month> <year reg="1832">1832</year></datestruct>, vol. cii. part i. pp. <num value="101">101</num>, <num value="102">102</num>.

From hence at a future time a flight of steps may be formed to the building beneath, and an appropriate rail also erected round the church, but at present the structure is defended on the east only by a high circular enclosure of boards. 
<P>The last meritorious work of restoration in St. Saviour's Church, was that of the ancient Altar-Screen given in the commencement of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century by Richard Fox, Bishop of Winchester; a subscription for which was ultimately united with that commenced for the Lady Chapel. To the latter of these funds the present Bishop of Winchester gave <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">300</num>l.</measure>, and <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">100</num>l.</measure> to the Screen; and other large sums were speedily and liberally contributed. Previously to Mr. Gwilt's restoration of the choir, the eastern wall of the Church was covered with a composition of wood and plaster, ascribed by tradition to Sir Christopher Wren, though apparently without any authority. Above this Screen appeared the mutilated and inelegant broad window of the sixteentn century, the arch of which was sculptured in relievo, in panels; that in the centre having an angel holding a shield, and those at the side a pelican feeding her young, the emblem of Christ, and the device of Bishop Fox.<NOTE N="e"><P>An engraving of this arch and facia, which are now lost,&mdash;is inserted in Moss's <hi rend=italics>Hist. of the Church of St. Saviour</hi>, p. <num value="61">61</num>.</NOTE> There was also a carved facia, on which the pelican was repeated, with the holy-lamb and oak leaves, the style of all which entirely disagreed with that of the altarpiece below. On the removal of the modern screen, a series of small tabernacle-niches was discovered on the partition behind, the canopies of which had been cut down to almost a level surface; though they still possessed so much beauty as to cause the restoration of the whole, to become a circumstance of the greatest interest. This was completed in the commencement of <datestruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></datestruct>, by Mr. Robert Wallace, the Architect of the Church, Mr. Firth, the Contractor, and Mr. Purdy the principal Carver; the contract amounting to only the sum of <measure value="700l." type=currency><num value="700">700</num>l.</measure> The ancient material of this Screen was Firestone and the stone of Caen; and the restoration has been executed in stone from Painswick, in Gloucestershire, which agrees well with the former. Wherever it was practicable the original work has been retained, but nearly the whole of the ornamental carvings have been wrought from moulds and replaced in the precise situations of the ancient sculpture whence they were taken. The whole screen is lofty, and the general composition of it is divided into <num value="3">three</num> stories in height and as many partitions in breadth. In the centre of the lowest story is a space for the altar, with <num value="3">three</num> tall tablets and canopies above; and on each side is a door with a depressed pointed arch. On each side of the doorways is a niche rising from the ground, flanked by slender buttresses and covered with a triangular tabernacle of <num value="2">two</num> canopied arches, with the angular point in front. In each niche is a tall pedestal with a richly carved head; and above the doors are short double canopies of a similar style, though rising above those on the sides, and breaking the line of a broad frieze of demiangels, above which is a narrow line of carved pelicans, holy-lambs, and scrolls. These terminate the <num value="1">first</num> story; and the above <num value="2">second</num> and <num value="3">third</num> are composed of a large niche in the centre, with a semi-hexagonal canopy, placed between <num value="5">five</num> niches on each side, with pedestals and canopies like those below; whilst a <num value="2">second</num> frieze of angels, &amp;c. parts the <num value="2">two</num> stories. As the story finished the remains of the ancient screen, Mr. Wallace has designed a termination of an entablature of angels supporting shields, with a crown-like cornice above; something similar to which most probably surmounted the original design.<NOTE N="f"><P>The above particulars concerning the Altar-Screen of St. Saviour's Church, have been extracted from an article on the subject by Mr. E.

<P>It exhibits this monastery in <num value="3">three</num> points of view; the great gatehouse, or entrance, built by prior Dockra, in the reign of Henry VII. and still standing; the west end of the conventual church, with some ancient buildings adjoining it; and the principal front towards St. John Street. 
<P>Of these views, the last is by far the most curious, not only as shewing more of the building than the others, but as every atom of that part of the structure, excepting the east end of the church, is now completely destroyed. From this valuable memorial we may form a tolerably correct idea of the extent and magnificence of this once rich and celebrated Hospital, as well as gain some insight into the age and style of its architecture: several of the windows in particular, we may observe, were extremely beautiful, and of a very early fashion. 
<P>The gateway is not very faithfully delineated; but being exhibited more in its original state than we now see it, this representation is not without its value. The battlements at the top must at that time have given a great addition to the stateliness of its appearance. The title-pages of the Gentleman's Magazine would have immortalized this part of the structure, had there been no other memorial remaining. 
<P>The west end of the church, now faced with a modern screen of brick-work, is shewn in the print in the state it was left by the Protector Somerset, the architecture being of that mixed kind then <num value="1">first</num> adopted: its elegant nave and transepts, its beautiful high enamelled spire, pathetically lamented by Stowe as the pride of the metropolis, and all its ancient glory, had fallen a sacrifice a century before this view was taken, to the rapacity of that minister. The choir, much modernized and defaced, still exists, and is now the parochial church of St. John, Clerkenwell. 
<P>St. John's priory was founded about the year <datestruct value="1100"><year reg="1100">1100</year></datestruct> by Jordan Brisset and Muriel his wife, who had previously founded the nunnery at Clerkenwell. The church was dedicated by Heraclius, patriarch of Jerusalem, <num value="85">eighty-five</num> years after the above period; which space, from its <num value="1">first</num> foundation, we may conjecture, had been employed in erecting that and the other buildings of the monastery. It was the chief seat of the religious order called the Knights Hospitalers of Jerusalem, and previous to its dissolution possessed immense revenues. During the insurrection of Wat Tyler this fine convent was in great part burnt by the mob; the succeeding priors endeavoured to repair the damage; but the church and buildings were not completely finished until the year <datestruct value="1504"><year reg="1504">1504</year></datestruct>, when Thomas Dockra was prior.

<P>Bermondsey, the title of this district, is usually supposed to be derived from some Saxon proprietor of the name of Beormund: the termination ea or eye, which signifies water, denoted the nature of the soil, and is frequent in the names of places whose situation on the banks of rivers renders them insular or marshy. 
<P>A full account of this manor is given in Domesday Book as follows: The manor-house or palace, given by William II, in <datestruct value="1094--"><year reg="1094">1094</year></datestruct>, to the monks of Bermondsey, was, after its surrender to Henry VIII, granted by him in <datestruct value="1541--"><year reg="1541">1541</year></datestruct> to Sir Robert Southwell, who in the same year sold it to Sir Thomas Pope; by whom, soon afterward, the ancient edifice was taken down, and a capital mansion erected. Having been occupied by the Earl of Sussex and various owners, part of it was in <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct> the property of Wm. Richardson: and now (<datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>) of James Riley, Esq. in whose garden there is an ancient wall with crosses and other devices in glazed bricks. The remainder of the site belonged to Wm. Smith, Esq. of Chiswick, so far as the new street called Abbey Street extends: beyond that, to the east, is George Street, which extends to the Neckinger. This ground no doubt originally was a part of the Abbey Grange or Farm, and is now the property of George Choumert, Esq. 
<P>The parish of Bermondsey is situate in the county of Surrey and <num value="100">hundred</num> of Brixton, and is bounded by the parishes of St. John, St. George, and St. Olave in Southwark, and those of Rotherhithe and Deptford. In <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct> it was computed to contain <num value="514">514</num> acres of land; a considerable part of which has been since built upon.

in the pound. 
<P>The ravages of the plague appear to have been in <datestruct value="1625--"><year reg="1625">1625</year></datestruct> most fatal, the number of deaths being <datestruct value="1117--"><year reg="1117">1117</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1636--"><year reg="1636">1636</year></datestruct> there died <num value="203">203</num> persons of this distemper; and in <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>, the number cut off was <num value="263">263</num>. 
<P>The increase of population in this parish between the years <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg=1665>1665</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg=1680>1680</year></datestruct>, was very rapid; but in the last century comparatively small. In <datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct> Bermondsey contained <num value="2111">2111</num> houses, and in <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct> the number was <num value="3100">3100</num>.

<P>Bermondsey is now a place of great trade. The tanners are very numerous; and that business is carried on to a greater extent here than in any other part of the kingdom. They were incorporated by Queen Anne, in the <num value="2">2nd</num> year of her reign, by the title of the Master, Wardens, and Commonalty of the Art or Mystery of Tanners of the Parish of St. Mary Magdalen, Bermondsey. The waterside division is occupied by ropemakers, anchorsmiths, boat-builders, coopers, and others employed in making various articles used in the navy; and there are <num value="2">two</num> small docks for ships. Calico printing and dying were formerly carried on here. There are also some manufacturers of pins and needles. A brewery was established here by Mr. Fendall, and afterward carried on by Mr. Gibson till about the year <datestruct value="1772"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, when the ground he occupied was let to build on. A manufacture of paper, from straw, was a few years since begun at the Neckinger, but it did not succeed; and at this time (<datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>) it is occupied by Messrs. Bevington, leather-dressers. 
<div2 type=section id="c.30.45"><HEAD>The Priory and Abbey of St. Saviour of Bermondsey.</HEAD>

<P>Aylwin Child, citizen of London, founded a Priory here in the year <datestruct value="1082"><year reg="1082">1082</year></datestruct>, and the <num value="16">16th</num> of the reign of William I, called the Priory of St. Saviour of Bermondsey; and placed therein a society of monks, from the Cluniac Monastery of La Charit&eacute;, in Normandy, by the procurement of Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury. William II augmented the revenues of this foundation, and completed the Conventual Church. Aylwin Child, the founder, died in the year <datestruct value="1094"><year reg="1094">1094</year></datestruct>. Bermondsey continued to be an alien Priory, dependent on that of Cluny, until <datestruct value="1390--"><year reg="1390">1390</year></datestruct>, <num value="14">14</num> Ric. <num value="2">2</num>, when it was made denizen; and an Abbey. John Attilburg, the <num value="64">64th</num> Prior from its foundation, was made the <num value="1">first</num> Abbot, by Pope Boniface IX, at the King's suit. 
<P>This religious house was enriched by numerous grants of land and bequests in money, by many pious persons; together with the advowson of several churches. The annual amount of the whole is estimated by a modern writer at <num value="3000">3000</num><hi rend=italics>l</hi>, according to the present value of money. 
<P>The advowson of Bermondsey Priory was in the monks; but their election was not valid till confirmed by the King. In <datestruct value="1514--"><year reg="1514">1514</year></datestruct>, by letters patent, dated <datestruct VALUE="-06-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, the King granted the next advowson to Thomas Wolsey then Bishop of Lincoln, and John Reve de Melford, abbot of St. Edmundsbury: but whether they ever collated under this grant, or it was afterwards resumed, is uncertain. 
<P>Of the internal state and history of Bermondsey Priory but little is known; the annals being nearly all lost in the general wreck of its fortunes.<NOTE N=1><P>In the British Museum is a small volume, entitled Annales Abbatt&aelig; de Bermondsey (formerly belonging to the Howard family) quoted by Manning in his History of Surrey under the title of The Chronicle of Bermondsey, and ending <num value="11">11</num> Hen. <num value="6">6</num>, A. D. <datestruct value="1432"><year reg="1432">1432</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> It appears however that provincial chapters were sometimes held here, and that the Court occasionally made use of it for their meetings on affairs of state, where the King consulted with his nobles on the state of the kingdom. In the reign of Henry III many of the nobility, having taken the Cross upon them, met at this house to deliberate on the or er of their journey to the Holy Land; and in the <num value="25">25th</num> of the same reign, William de Eborum, and his fellow justices itinerant, held their assizes here on the <datestruct VALUE="-05-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>. 
<P>The prior and convent were obliged to find a competent maintenance for the Earl of Gloucester and his heirs whenever they should come hither. And Ralph, Earl of Stafford, who married Margaret, daughter of Hugh de Audley, Earl of Gloucester, is said to have died seised in demesne, or fee, of an apartment or lodging within the priory.

For this and other services their posterity enjoyed this appointment in the nature of a corrody. 
<P>The Bishops of Winchester claimed an annual procuration, or entertainment for <num value="1">one</num> day, when they held their visitations in this part of their diocese. On a revival of this claim in <datestruct value="1276--"><year reg="1276">1276</year></datestruct>, by Nicholas de Ely, then Bishop, the convent pleaded an exemption. The Bishop contested it, and at length a compromise took place on the following conditions: That the prior and convent, and their successors, on the <num value="1">first</num> coming of every Bishop of Winchester to Bermondsey, after his installation, should meet him in procession; and in lieu of the entertainment should pay unto him, and his successors, <measure value="5bmark" type=currency><num value="5">5</num> marks</measure> of silver for that time, at his house in Southwark, and on every succeeding year <measure value="2.50bmark" type=currency><num value="2.50">2 1/2</num> marks</measure> at Michaelmas; and if the Bishop should go beyond sea, the prior and convent were to receive him in procession on his return. 
<P>The prior and convent of Bermondsey, who had a park and other lands adjoining the bank of the Thames called Rotherhithe Wall, sustained such damage from an inundation in <datestruct value="1309--"><year reg="1309">1309</year></datestruct>, by a breach in those parts, that they were exempted from the purveyance of hay and corn. 
<P>Edward II, in <datestruct value="1324--"><year reg="1324">1324</year></datestruct>, issued his letters patent, for arresting the prior and certain monks of this house, for harbouring rebels therein. These were probably some of the adherents of Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, who, after his defeat at the battle of Boroughbridge <num value="2">two</num> years before, had taken sanctuary in this convent. <pb id="p.108" n="108"> 
<P>The Bishop of Ely, in <datestruct value="1337--"><year reg="1337">1337</year></datestruct>, excommunicated certain persons for stealing a hawk from its perch, in the cloisters of this priory. A proof of the estimation in which this bird was held by persons of rank, at that period. 
<div2 type=section id="c.30.46"><HEAD>Saint Saviour's or St. Thomas' Hospital.</HEAD>

<P>Richard, prior of Bermondsey, with the consent of the convent, in <datestruct value="1213--"><year reg="1213">1213</year></datestruct> built an almshouse or hospital, on a piece of ground belonging to the cellarer or bursar, and adjoining to the walls of the priory, for the use of converts or poor children; and dedicated it to St. Thomas of Canterbury It was under the government of the almoner of the priory, and exempt, as the priory itself was, from all episcopal jurisdiction. This house, on account of its being dedicated to St. Thomas, hath been confounded, by several authors, with the hospital of that name in Southwark, which was founded about the same period. 
<P>Agnes, the sister of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, and widow of Thomas Fitz Theobald de Heili, gave to the hospital of St. Saviour of Bermondsey <num value="10">10</num><hi rend=italics>s</hi> annual rent, issuing out of her estate in London, situate at Blanch Apultune in the parish of Stanynge Cherche, in the tenure of William Cook; and it is probable she was moved to this act of charity by a pious regard to the memory of her brother.

<P>Richard Guet, who gave Cowick in Essex to this house, in <datestruct value="1098--"><year reg="1098">1098</year></datestruct>, professed himself a monk here at the same time, and was probably interred in this church. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1323--"><year reg="1323">1323</year></datestruct>, <num value="17">17</num> Edw. <num value="2">2</num>, the greater church of St. Saviour of Bermondsey, and the great altar in honour of St. Saviour and the most blessed Virgin Mary and All Saints, were dedicated by the Bishop of Epo Corbamensi fratre minore, on the <num value="3">third</num> of the ides of January. And on the octave of the same day, <num value="3">three</num> altars were dedicated by the same prelate: the Altar of the Cross, in honour of the same; the Altar Drueth, in honour of the blessed Virgin and St. Thomas the martyr; and the Altar that is next the door of the monks' burying-ground, in honour of the Saints Andrew and James and all the Apostles. 
<P>This house appears (by the date of its surrender, <datestruct VALUE="-01-1"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=1>1</day></datestruct>, <num value="29">29</num> Hen. <num value="8">8</num>) to have anticipated the designs of the Crown upon the greater monasteries, by a voluntary resignation of its estates. Nor is it improbable, when we consider the preferments the abbot was advanced to, who made the surrender, that he was put in by the Court with a view to this event. The annual revenue of the convent, as stated in the original account taken by commissioners, and delivered to the King, was <num value="548">548</num><hi rend=italics>l</hi> <num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>s</hi> <num value="5.50">5 1/2</num><hi rend=italics>d</hi>; but according to a valuation in <num value="26">26</num> Hen. <num value="8">8</num>, taken also by commissioners, <num value="474">474</num><hi rend=italics>l</hi> <num value="14">14</num><hi rend=italics>s</hi> <num value="4.50">4 1/2</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> These different accounts might be taken from the same valuation; <num value="1">one</num> being intended to exhibit the extended rents, and the other the clear value of the estates. Yet it seems more probable that the latter was a subsequent <num value="1">one</num>, in which the value of their estates was underrated, in order to bring as many as possible within the Act for suppressing the lesser monasteries, which was passed the year following. 
<P>Of the pensions granted to the monks of this house on its surrender, and which were allowed to all who were not novices, probationers, or already beneficed, there remained in charge, at the dissolution of the Court of Augmentations, in <num value="7">7</num> Edw. <num value="6">6</num>, <datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>.

<P>At the dissolution of monasteries in the reign of Henry VIII, that of Bermondsey was valued at <num value="474">474</num><hi rend=italics>l</hi> <num value="14">14</num><hi rend=italics>s</hi> <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>d</hi>, according to Dugdale, and by Speed, at <num value="584">584</num><hi rend=italics>l</hi> <num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>s</hi> <num value="3">3</num><hi rend=italics>d</hi>; and it was granted by the King, <datestruct VALUE="1541-07-8"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=8>8</day>, <year reg=1541>1541</year></datestruct>, in the <num value="33">33rd</num> of his reign, to Sir Robert Southwell, Knight, Master of the Rolls, who had also a grant of court leet, view of frank pledge, and free warren. In the same year (<datestruct value="1541"><year reg="1541">1541</year></datestruct>) it was sold by Sir Robert, with the manor, demesne, and appurtenances, to Sir Thomas Pope, the founder of Trinity College, Oxford, who pulled down the ancient buildings belonging to the monastery, and with the materials erected a capital mansion, called Bermondsey House. This mansion, with the orchards, gardens, and out-houses, barn, stable, pasture, and ponds, at the back of the orchards, estimated at <num value="20">twenty</num> acres, he conveyed in <datestruct value="1544--"><year reg="1544">1544</year></datestruct>, to Sir Robert Southwell, reserving the manor, and such other of the abbey estates as he had formerly purchased of Sir Robert, to himself; but in <datestruct value="1556--"><year reg="1556">1556</year></datestruct> he sold the manor itself, with the estates belonging to the dissolved abbey, and the advowson of the rectory, to Robert Trapps, citizen and goldsmith of London, who died in <datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>, and Joan his wife, in <datestruct value="1563--"><year reg="1563">1563</year></datestruct>-<num value="4">4</num>. The manor remained in the male branch of this family till <datestruct value="1709"><year reg="1709">1709</year></datestruct>, when it came by marriage to Edward Thurland, Esq. of Reigate. In <datestruct value="1717--"><year reg="1717">1717</year></datestruct> it was purchased by Peter Hambly, of Streatham, Esq. who left it by will to his son William Hambly, Esq. of Carshalton, and by him it was bequeathed to his only son the Rev. Thomas Hambly (who was instituted to the rectory <pb id="p.110" n="110"> in <datestruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></datestruct>, and in the year <datestruct value="1810"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct> was in the possession of his widow. The advowson of the rectory of Bermondsey belonged to the abbey, and has undergone the same alienations as the manor. 
<P>The water-side division of Bermondsey, or that part of the parish situate east of St. Saviour's dock, and adjoining the parish of Rotherhithe, is intersected by severa streams, or water-courses. Upon the south bank of <num value="1">one</num> of these, between Mill Street and George Row, stand a number of very ancient houses, called London Street; a south view of which is given in the annexed plate, together with a plan of the streets and lanes adjacent, as they appeared in <datestruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, including the several wharfs on each side of St. Saviour's dock, from an actual survey. 
<P>The parish church of St. Mary Magdalen, according to Stow, was built by the priors of St. Saviour's monastery for the use of their tenants; the time of its erection and decay is unknown, but it appears that the Earl of Sussex, who became possessed of the mansion built by Sir Thomas Pope, was obliged to build a place for public worship at or near the place where the parish church now stands. 
<P>There had been anciently a royal palace in Southwark, probably that in Bermondsey in which Henry II resided, and held his <num value="1">first</num> parliament at Christmas <datestruct value="1154--"><year reg="1154">1154</year></datestruct>. It was afterward occupied by the De la Poles, Marquises and Dukes of Suffolk. Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, built a sumptuous house on the site of it called Suffolk House; but falling afterward into the King's hands, the same was called Suffolk Place, and a mint of coinage was established there for the King. Henry Gray, Marquis of Dorset and great-grandson of Elizabeth Queen of Edward IV, who was created Duke of Suffolk by Edward VI, resided here in <datestruct value="1552--"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct>. At the commencement of the reign of Queen Mary he was attainted of high treason, and beheaded in the following year. Queen Mary granted this house to Nicholas Heath, Archbishop of York, and his successors in the see for ever, to be their inn or lodging when they repaired to London; as an equivalent for York House near Westminster, which King Henry, her father, had taken from Cardinal Wolsey and the see of York. 
<P>The mansion built by Sir Thomas Pope (on the site of the monastery) was afterwards the residence of the Earl of Sussex, who held the office of Lord Chamberlain to Queen Elizabeth, and died here in <datestruct value="1583--"><year reg="1583">1583</year></datestruct>. Stow, in his Summary of the Chronicles of England, gives the following account of his funeral procession: &ldquo;On the <datestruct VALUE="-06-9"><day reg="9">ninth</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct> (<datestruct value="1583--"><year reg="1583">1583</year></datestruct>) deceased Thomas Ratcliffe, Earl of Sussex, Lorde Chamberlaine to her Majestie, a Knight of the Garter, at Bermondsey besides London; and was on the <datestruct VALUE="-07-8"><day reg="8">eight</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct> following conveyed thorough the same city of London toward Newhall in Essex, there to be buried: <num value="1">first</num> went before him <num value="45">forty-five</num> poore men in blacke gownes, then on horseback <num value="120">120</num> serving men in blacke coats, then <num value="25">25</num> in black gownes or cloakes, besides the Heraldes at Armes; then the deceased Earle in a charriot covered with blacke velvet, drawen by foure goodly geldings, next after was led the Earle's steed covered with blacke velvet, then Sir Henrie Ratcliffe the succeeding Earle, chiefe mourner, &amp; <num value="8">eight</num> other Lords all in blacke; then the Lord Mayor &amp; Aldermen of London riding in murrey, and then on foot the gentlemen of Graie's Inne, and last of all the Merchant Tailors in their livery, for that the said Earle was a brother of their company, as many noble men and famous Princes, Kings of this realme, before him had been.&rdquo; 
<P>By a codicil to his will, dated <datestruct VALUE="1583-05-21"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=21>21</day>, <year reg=1583>1583</year></datestruct>, he ordered that his executors should keep house at Bermondsey <num value="20">twenty</num> days after his interment, on which they were to expend <datestruct value="1500--"><year reg="1500">1500</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l</hi> and no more; but the funeral charges alone amounted to <datestruct value="1629--"><year reg="1629">1629</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l</hi> <num value="5">5</num><hi rend=italics>s</hi> <num value="0.50">0 1/2</num><hi rend=italics>d</hi>, and the expenses of house-keeping to <num value="158">158</num><hi rend=italics>l</hi> <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>s</hi> <num value="2">2</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> His effects at this place were valued at <datestruct value="1585--"><year reg="1585">1585</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> His executors were Sir Christopher Wray, Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench; Sir Gilbert Gerard, Master of the Rolls; Sir Thomas Mildmay, and others. A monument was erected to his memory in the church of Boreham, in Essex, executed by Richard Stephens, a statuary, who received for his part of the work <num value="292">292</num><hi rend=italics>l</hi> <num value="12">12</num><hi rend=italics>s</hi> <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>

<P>Of the mansion erected by Sir Thomas Pope, a correct idea may be formed of the style of building, and its interior arrangement, by an inspection of the <num value="2">two</num> plates, entitled &ldquo;Inside of <num value="1">one</num> of the Rooms under the Hall,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Inside of a Room adjoining those under the Hall.&rdquo; In the <num value="1">first</num> plate is shown the wainscoting or panneling of the room with its antique fireplace: over the latter is a large compartment, probably once filled by a picture. The details on this plate exhibit sections of the panneling and fireplace, with a Saxon ornament and cross in the wall near the gateway of the abbey. The <num value="2">second</num> plate exhibits a large room, the walls in part panneled in a plainer manner than the preceding room, and an ancient fireplace without ornament. The details of this plate are composed of specimens of the capitals of Saxon pillars, ornaments, and windows, from various parts of the abbey and the principal gateway. 
<P>The plate entitled &ldquo;Inside of the Hall&rdquo; was probably the hall or refectory of the monastery, as its appearance is more ancient than those before described. The central vignette shews the exterior of the hall; the details explain the plan of the ceiling, its mouldings and those of the doorway leading to this apartment. 
<P>The Ground Plan, engraved from an original drawing taken in <datestruct value="1679--"><year reg="1679">1679</year></datestruct>, exhibits a ground-plot of the old Conventual Church, with gardens enclosed by stone walls, and bounded on the north by the churchyard of St. Mary Magdalen; the West and North Gates leading into the Base court-yard; the site of the Mansion-house, and the Gallery belonging to the same; and the East Gate leading into Grange Walk. On the south side of Grange Walk is shown the site of the Coney-grew, or Warren; the Stable Yard and Pond; and an Orchard called Wood's Orchard. No. <num value="1">1</num> shows the site of Mr. Whitaker's meeting-house, which occupied part of that of the abbey church; and No. <num value="2">2</num>. on the west side of the court-yard, shows the site of Mr. Mauduit's meeting house built in <datestruct value="1699--"><year reg="1699">1699</year></datestruct>. 
<P>The plan is embellished with a vignette of the Church of St. Mary Magdalen; and another showing the West Gate, and the North or Great Gate-house with its interior looking into the Base court-yard. 
<P>In the year <datestruct value="1804"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct> there were a great many fragments of the venerable foundation of Bermondsey Abbey remaining, probably more than almost any religious edifice in or near London, owing to its remote situation, which has caused fewer improvements in the building line (that worst enemy to our architectural antiquities) than elsewhere. The principal entrance, called the Gate-house, was then nearly entire; its appearance the annexed plate will sufficiently explain: in addition to which, it may be necessary to observe that the front was composed of party-coloured tiles. This gateway stood directly north, and exactly faced the south side of Bermondsey church. An old stone wall ran eastward the whole extent of the churchyard. On the other side of this wall was a row of very old houses, whose stone-framed windows and style of building evidently pointed out their antiquity. 
<P>The present churchyard of St. Mary Magdalen was enlarged in <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, by taking about <num value="16">sixteen</num> feet in width of the old conventual ground. It is enclosed by a brick wall, <num value="10">ten</num> feet under ground, and <num value="2">two</num> above, on the top of which is an iron railing. In digging the foundation for this wall many bones were seen; some lying in the order they were interred, not having been disturbed before: and the late Mr. Ash, leather-dresser, in sinking some pits, found a stone coffin containing bones. All these circumstances prove that this was the conventual churchyard, as shown in the plan. 
<P>Since the annexed General View of the Remains of the Abbey was taken in <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>, the great gatehouse, and nearly all the ancient buildings, with the exception of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> dwelling-houses, have been destroyed, and a modern street (called Abbey Street) erected on the site. The small portion of the abbey walls yet remaining is on the south side, and a fragment of the same wall on the north side of Long Walk, the latter being a part of that which surrounded the conventual churchyard: but even these may probably soon be taken down, and all traces of this once famous Abbey will then be entirely obliterated.

<P>Notwithstanding the many authentic documents which are extant illustrative of the history and possessions of this ancient and celebrated Religious House, there appears to be some doubt concerning the person by whom it was actually founded. The Register of the Priory itself, and the authorities followed by Stow, state it to have been by Matilda, Queen to Henry I., daughter of Malcolm III., King of Scots: but Matthew Paris, and some other ancient historians assert it to have been by the <num value="1">first</num> Prior, Norman, <num value="1">first</num> of the Regular-Canons of St. Austin in England; and in a record preserved by Dugdale, the institution is ascribed to Richard De Belmeis, Bishop of London.<NOTE N="a"><P>In the <hi rend=italics>Historia Major</hi> of Matthew Paris, Edit. Paris, <datestruct value="1644--"><year reg="1644">1644</year></datestruct>, fol. p. <num value="43">43</num>, under the year <datestruct value="1107"><year reg="1107">1107</year></datestruct>, it is stated that &ldquo;Norman the Prior founded the Church of Christ in London, and collected Canons there under the Order of St. Augustine:&rdquo; and the same founder is also named in the Chronicle of Bartholomew Cotton, and another at Rochester, eited in John Leland's <hi rend=italics>Collectanea</hi>, Edit. Lond. <datestruct value="1774--"><year reg="1774">1774</year></datestruct>. vol. iii. (iv.) p. <num value="73">73</num> (<num value="74">74</num> marg.) In Sir William Dugdale's <hi rend=italics>Monasticon Anglicanum</hi>, vol. ii. Lond. <datestruct value="1661--"><year reg="1661">1661</year></datestruct>. fol. p. <num value="80">80</num>. the Chronicon of St. Bennet Hulme mentions the same founder; but another MS. cited in the same place, says that &ldquo;Richard De Beaumeys, a Norman, Bishop of London, founded the Church of Christ in London, in which he placed many Canons.&rdquo; The Register of this Priory translated and printed in the <hi rend=italics><num value="2">Two</num> Additional Volumes to Sir William Dugdale's Monasticon Anglicanum</hi>, by John Stevens, Lond. <datestruct value="1723--"><year reg="1723">1723</year></datestruct>, p. fol. vol. ii. p. <num value="74">74</num>, ascribed the foundation to Queen Maud.</NOTE> It is probable, however, that the claims of the <num value="2">two</num> latter amount only to the interest which they took in the erection of the Priory, and the establishment of the new Monastical Rule: for the original and principal endowments seem to have emanated solely from the Queen. By the advice and persuasion of the Bishop of London, and of Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, she appears to have completed an imperfect church, which <num value="1">one</num> Syredus sometime began to erect in honour of the Holy Cross and St. Mary Magdalene; and having redeemed it from the payment of <measure value="30s." type=currency><num value="30">thirty</num> shillings</measure> which the Dean and Chapter of Waltham were accustomed to receive from it, by giving them a mill in exchange,&mdash;she gave the church to Norman who was made Prior there, the Nones of April (<num value="5">5th</num>), <datestruct value="1107--"><year reg="1107">1107</year></datestruct>. The foundation was dedicated to the Holy Trinity; though, like other establishments of the same name, it soon came to be called Christ Church, even in formal documents, and in the <num value="1">first</num> charter of the Queen it is entitled only &ldquo;the Church of Christ within the Wall of London.&rdquo; The same benefactress also endowed the Church and those serving GOD therein with her own demesne property of the Port, or Gate, of Aldgate, and the Soke, or civil government, belonging to it; with all customs, to be held by them as freely as she herself had possessed them: and likewise with <num value="25">25</num><hi rend=italics>libs.</hi> by weight, in the money called Blanks,<NOTE N="b"><P>The money named <hi rend=italics>Blanca, Blankes</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>Albus</hi>, appears to have been so called from its colour, being made of a debased silver, and to have been generally paid by weight. It is mentioned in the Domesday Survey, and was current in the time of Alan, Duke of Bretagne, A.D. <datestruct value="1087"><year reg="1087">1087</year></datestruct>, each piece being in value <num value="6">six</num> pennies Tournais, and less than the <hi rend=italics>black pence</hi> then used, from which it was distinguished by name. As this money varied in value according to the quality and weight of the silver of which it was coined, in A.D. <datestruct value="1180"><year reg="1180">1180</year></datestruct>, when Henry II. issued a new currency, the Sheriff of Exeter refused to pay the Prior of the Holy Trinity his half-year's farm at Michaelmas, 
<hi rend=italics>by weight</hi>, because the new coin was lighter than that in use, when the Queen gave the donation: so that at the new rate of <num value="20.50">20 1/2</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> per oz. or <num value="20">20</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> per <hi rend=italics>lib.</hi>, the sum due would amount to <num value="25">25</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="12">12</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> by weight.

<P>The edifice of the Priory was erected on a piece of ground in the Parish of St. Catherine, towards Aldgate, lying lengthwise between the King's-Street leading to Aldgate, and the north side of that Chapel of St. Michael at the union of Leadenhall and Fen-Church Street, inserted in the <num value="1">First</num> Volume of the present work. The ancient measurement of the length of the premises is set down by Stow<NOTE N="d"><P><hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, by Strype, Vol. I. book ii. chap. iv. p. <num value="56">56</num>.</NOTE> at <num value="83">83</num> ells half quarter and quartern, of the King's Iron Ell; but by another charter of Henry I., the Priory was privileged to enclose the way along London Wall, as well as to stop the passage there, and to enlarge the house and offices to the wall itself.<NOTE N="e"><P>It appears that this right was subsequently questioned, since in an Inquisition of Quo-Warranto in <datestruct value="1274--"><year reg="1274">1274</year></datestruct>-<num value="75">75</num>, the <num value="3">third</num> year of Edward I., the jurors of Portsoken Ward presented the Prior of Christ's Church for having &ldquo;applied to himself a lane between his Priory and the City Wall; through which was wont to be a common way.&rdquo; 
<hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, book ii. chap. ii. p. <num value="5">5</num>. It appears that this lane was afterwards opened again as it is shewn in the Plan of London by Radulphus Aggas, executed about <datestruct value="1562--"><year reg="1562">1562</year></datestruct>, extending from Aldgate westward, between the wall of Duke's Place and the City Wall: part of the line of this lane is still existing in the lower end of Duke-Street, Aldgate.</NOTE> The original title of the <num value="1">first</num> superior of this foundation, appears to have been Prior of Christ's Church, in the Parishes of St. Mary Magdalene, St. Michael, St. Catherine, and the Blessed Trinity, anciently the Parish of the Holy Cross or Holy Rood; all which districts were at this time re-united into <num value="1">one</num> Parish of the Holy Trinity. The inhabitants of the Parish of St Catherine however, at length procured that a Chapel or Church should be erected for them in the churchyard of the Prior, for their more convenient and quiet resort to divine service; in which <num value="1">one</num> of the Canons of the House was appointed by the Prior to say mass, though they were still obliged to bring their children to be christened at the Conventual Church, as well as to attend it upon all solemn feasts as the parochial church.<NOTE N="f"><P>Previously to the erection of this Chapel the inhabitants of St. Catherine's Parish were accustomed to celebrate mass in the south part of the Priory Church, where stood the altar of St. Mary Magdalene: but the confusion which arose from <num value="2">two</num> services being performed in the same church at the same time, was the cause that the Parish Church or Chapel of St. Catherine Christ Church, afterwards corrupted into Cree Church, was erected. The very curious history of this edifice, though closely connected with that of the Priory of the Holy Trinity, is too extensive to be farther entered into in this place.</NOTE> The entire extent of the Priory freehold, was equal to that of the ancient Ward of Aldgate; and some notion may be formed of it from the following particular account published by Strype from a statement drawn up by a member of the Convent, and copied into the City Record called <hi rend=italics>Dunthorne.</hi><NOTE N="g"><P>A manuscript register so called from the name of the writer, William Dunthorne, and consisting of a large folio volume, bound in wood, covered with rough calf leather, secnred with tarnished brass bosses and clasps, and bearing the name on the outside, written on parchment, under a plate of horn in a brass frame. The leaves are vellum, and the writing a very fair small and black law text; and the contents are ancient civic laws and privileges commencing with the charter granted to London by William I. It appears to have been chiefly on the authority of this record, that Stow affirmed the weapon in the City Arms to be intended for the Sword of St. Paul; &lt;<hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, book ii. chap. xii. p. <num value="186">186</num>.) and the illuminated initial letter of the volume contains the figure of St. Paul, gold, with the head, hands, feet, and the sword on which he is leaning silver; the device borne on the ancient Banner of London.</NOTE> It extended &ldquo;from the Gate of Aldgate as far as the Gate of the Bailey of the Tower, called Cungate; and all Chekyn-lane towards Barking Church, as far as the Churchyard, excepting <num value="1">one</num> house nearer than the churchyard. And the journey is returned the same way as far as the Church of St. Olave; and then we come back by the street which goes by the Church of Coleman Church, then it goes forth towards Fen-Church; and so there on this side our houses is a lane, through which we went into the house of Theobald Fitz-Ivo, Alderman, which lane is now stopped up because it hath been suspected for thieves in the night: therefore, because, a way is not open there, we come back again by a lane to the Church of St. Michael, and so as far as Lime-street to the house of Richard Cavel. This, therefore, is our inward Soke, (namely that within the walls of the City) and these are the bounds of it. This the Queen-Mother gave to us with the Gate of Aldgate. <pb id="p.112" n="112"> From Lime-street we go through the street by the Church of St. Andrew (Under Shaft) as far as the Chapel of St. Augustine upon the Wall; and then as far as the gate of the churchyard. This is the circuit of our inner Soke.&rdquo; 
<P>Soon after its foundation, the territory of the Priory was increased by the gift of that extra-liberty at the Port of Aldgate called <hi rend=italics>Cnighten Guild</hi>, an ancient account of which gift is also contained in volumes of the City Records marked C. and <hi rend=italics>Dunthorne</hi>, and printed in the <hi rend=italics>Remains</hi> to Stow in the following abridged translation.<NOTE N="a"><P><hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, Edit. by Anthony Munday, Lond. <datestruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>. fol. The Remaines, pp. <num value="930">930</num>-<num value="933">933</num>.</NOTE> &ldquo;In the year of Christ <datestruct value="1108--"><year reg="1108">1108</year></datestruct>, and in the <num value="8">eighth</num> year of King Henry, was the Church of the Holy Trinity, within Aldgate, founded by the venerable Lady Maud, wife unto the said King, by the persuas on of Archbishop Anselm. It was given unto Norman, who became the <num value="1">first</num> Prior; not only there, but <num value="1">first</num> Canon- Regular of the whole kingdom: for by him was all England, saith my record, adornea with the Rule of St. Augustine, and the canonical habit of that Order. By which Order, through the gathering together of many friars into that church, was the number of those that praised GOD day and night so much increased, that the whole City was much delighted with the sight of it. Insomuch that in the year <datestruct value="1225"><year reg="1225">1225</year></datestruct>, certain Burgesses of the City descended of the ancient race of the English Knights, by name Ralfe, the son of Algode, Wolfard le Deverish, Orgar le Prude, Edward Upcornhill, Blackstan, and his cousin Alwyn, Alwyn, and Robert his brother, sons of Leofstan, Leofstan the Goldsmith, and Wyzo his son, Hugh the son of Wolgare, Algar Secusenne, Orgar the son of Dereman, Osbert Drinchepin, and Adelardus Hornpite;&mdash;meeting together in the Church of Christ which is situate without the walls of the City near Aldgate, freely gave unto the said Church, and unto the Canons serving GOD, all that land and soken, which was called in English <hi rend=italics>Cnithgilda</hi>, which lies by the wall of the City without Aldgate,<NOTE N="b"><P>The extent of this Guild was from Aldgate, to the present City-bars on the east; to Bishopgate, and the house of William Presbyter, afterwards that of Geoffrey Tanner, the heirs of Colver, John Easby and of Sir John Bouchier, &amp;c. on the north; and on the south to the Thames, as far into the same river as a horseman could ride into it at low water and throw his spear. This space included all East Smithfield, with the right side of the street leading to Doddings Pond to the Thames; and the Hospital of St Catherine, the mills founded in the reign of Stephen, and the stone wall and new ditch of the Tower, made in the reign of Richard I. The estates and Guild were originally granted by Canute or Edgar, in the <num value="10">tenth</num> or <num value="11">eleventh</num> century, to <num value="13">thirteen</num> English Knights who were to receive it upon the very honourable condition of each of them engaging in <num value="3">three</num> combats (tilting) upon the lands and as many in the water, and gaining the victory: as also that on an appointed day they should hold a tilting in the field of East-Smithfield against all comers. This being performed, the King gave them the franchise by charter, and named it <hi rend=italics>Knytte Guilden</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>Cnihten Guild</hi>, in memory of the persons who obtained it: which charters were confirmed by Edward the Confessor, William II., and Henry I. The record of this grant mentioned above, states that by the forming of the outer stone wall and new ditch at the Tower in the reign of Richard I., the Priory lost half a mark, <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>, of its yearly revenue, in addition to the removal of a mill belonging jointly to the Priory and St. Catherine's Hospital.

A part of this land was afterwards granted by the Priory of the Holy Trinity to Maud, the Queen of Stephen, on which she founded St. Catherine's Hospital; and for which the King gave in exchange <num value="6">six</num> yards of land of his own demesne in the Manor of Braughing, in Hertfordshire. By the charters of some Bishops of London, confirmed by some Archbishops of Canterbury, the collation and donation of the Hospital were assigned to the Priory of the Holy Trinity; and the canonical rule was given back to the same by a bull from Pope Urban IV. in <datestruct value="1264--"><year reg="1264">1264</year></datestruct>; in consequence of a dispute upon a dispensation granted to the Hospital by a Bishop of London, with the Queen's sanction.&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Ibid.</hi> pp. <num value="12">12</num>, <num value="13">13</num>.</NOTE> and reaches unto the Thames. They gave it, I say, themselves becoming friars, and partaking of the benefits of that place by the hand of Norman, the Prior, who received them into the society, as he had done others before them, by an oath taken upon the text of the Gospel. And to the intent that this gift of their's might stand firm and unchangeable, they surrendered up, with other writings which they had for it, that Charter of St. Edward: after which they gave the Prior seisin and possession of the said land by the Church of St. Botolph, which had been builded upon the same and was the head of it. All this was done before these witnesses, Bernard, Prior of Dunstable, John, Prior of Landa, and divers other French and English people. The said donors hereupon sent <num value="1">one</num> of their own company, Ordgar le Prude by name, unto King Henry, with their petition that he would be pleased to give his consent and confirmation to their said gift. Whereupon the King very willingly allowed the said land and Soken unto the Church: and to be free and acquitted from all service to himself, as Frank-Alms ought to be: which he thus confirmed by his charter &mdash;Henry, King of England to (Richard de Belmeis) Bishop of London, to the Sheriffs and Provost, and to all his Barons and faithful people, French and English, of London and Middlesex, Greeting. Know ye me to have granted and confirmed to the Church and Canons of the Holy Trinity of London the Soke of the English Knighten Guild, and the land which pertaineth thereunto, and the Church of St. Botolph, as the Men of the same Guild have given and granted unto them. And I will and straitly command that they may hold the same well, and honourably and freely; with Sac and Soke, Toll and Thea, Infangtheof, and all customs belonging to it, as the Men of the same Guild in the best sort had the same in the time of King Edward; and as the Kings William my father and brother did grant it to them by their writs. Witness A (delicia) the Queen, Geoffrey De Clinton, the Chancellor, and William of Clinton: at Woodstock.&rdquo; This charter was afterwards confirmed by Gilbert, William, and Roger, Bishops of London; then by St. Alphage, Archbishop of Canterbury, and then by the Popes Innocent II. and Alexander III. The former Pontiff also glanted to the Prior and Convent that St. Botolph's Church should be served by <num value="1">one</num> of the Canons, to be removed at the Prior's pleasure: and by a bull in <datestruct value="1137--"><year reg="1137">1137</year></datestruct> he appointed that whatever possessions and goods the said Christ Church then justly and lawfully possessed, or might hereafter by the concession of Fopes, grants of Kings or Princes, offerings of the faithful, or by other just means, might be gotten,&mdash;should remain firm and inviolable to them and their successors. The same instrument also confirmed &ldquo;the land and Soke of Anglische Cnihte Gild,&rdquo; and whatever churches or lands, without the City of London or within, which had been reasonably bestowed by <emph rend=caps>God's</emph> faithful people, or which should happen to be offered hereafter.<NOTE N="c"><P>Strype's Stow's <hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, book ii. chap. ii. p. <num value="4">4</num>.</NOTE>

<P>In consequence of the possession of this franchise, the Prior of the Holy Trinity was, for himself and his successors, admitted as <num value="1">one</num> of the Aldermen of London, namely of the Ward of Portsoken, to govern the same land and Soke; and as such the Prior was accustomed both to sit in the Court of Aldermen and to ride in their processions, wearing the scarlet, or other livery used by them, but made in the form of a religious habit, until the time of the dissolution of this house. Stow adds that he had been a witness of this practice in his own childhood; at which period also &ldquo;the Prior kept a most bountiful house of meat and drink, for both rich and poor, as well within the house as at the gates, to all comers according to their estates.&rdquo;<NOTE N="d"><P>This is a reference to the monastic custom of entertaining travellers and visitors, especially those of distinetion, in the ancient Religious houses, as well as relieving the poor with a daily dole at the gate, consisting of the certain portions, and the remains of the food of the brethren, delivered by the porter. The former, however, were received in a large apartment called the Guest-Hall, supported by columns and surrounded by bed-chambers; the whole being erected as much out of the way of the monks as the building would permit. Several curious particulars concerning the reception of guests in convents, may be seen in the Rev. T. D.

<P>In the civil wars between John and the English Barons, and in his dispute with the Pope, the Canons of this House appear to have been so zealously opposed to the King, that Cardinal Gualo, the Legate, in <datestruct value="1211--"><year reg="1211">1211</year></datestruct>, gave them a Charter of the Church of Brackinges of Braughing in Hertfordshire;<NOTE N="c"><P>The Rectory of Braughing with the advowson of the Vicarage was originally given to this Priory by Queen Maud, which gift was confirmed by Walter Gualo, Cardinal-Presbyter of St. Martin, in virtue of his Legatine power as above stated; and upon inspection of his charter William De St. Maria, Bishop of London, appropriated the living to the use of the house, and on the <num value="16">16th</num> of the Calends of May (<num value="17">17th</num>) <datestruct value="1218--"><year reg="1218">1218</year></datestruct>, made an ordination and endowment of a Vicarage there. The Priors of the Holy Trinity claimed all ancient feudal authority in Braughing; with the correction of the assize of bread, wine, and all the View of Frank-Pledge, and the holding of Courts Leet and Baron for the Manor.&mdash;&ldquo;History of the Diocese of London,&rdquo; by Richard Newcourt, Lond. <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>. fol. vol. i. p. <num value="806">806</num>.</NOTE> wherein he commends them for being such obedient sons to the Holy Mother Church of Rome, in the late disturbance in England, wherein they underwent heavy losses and no small wrong. With all these endowments the Priory of the Holy Trinity in the course of time became, as it is expressed by Stow, &ldquo;a very fair and large church, rich in lands and ornaments, and passed all the Priories of the City of London or Shire of Middlesex.&rdquo; A long and particular record of the houses standing on the Priory estates in London, with copies and abstracts of many of the charters conveying property in various parts of England,<NOTE N="d"><P>A fragment of a manuscript Register of this Priory, consisting of <num value="12">twelve</num> leaves of vellum, in folio, and containing the Foundation Charter, with some of the other grants of various benefactors,&mdash;is preserved in the Lansdowne Collection of MSS.

It appears to have been drawn up about the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> century, after much of the conventual-property had been alienated on account of London having been twice destroyed by fire,<NOTE N="e"><P>The <num value="1">first</num> of the fires referred to happened in the time of Norman, the <num value="1">first</num> Prior, in A. D. <datestruct value="1132"><year reg="1132">1132</year></datestruct>, and extended from the house of Gilbert Becket to the Church of the Holy Trinity, which was burned with nearly all its offices. At his time, says the Register, &ldquo;our Lord shewed a great miracle in this church upon a certain cross; which, when the fire prevailed, men endeavouring to get out with other goods of the said church, and drawing the same with ropes, they could not remove it, and the lead of the church melting they were obliged to desist. But returning the next day, believing it to have been consumed with the rest, they found it untouched by the fire.&rdquo; The <num value="2">second</num> fire is recorded to have happened in the time of Ralph the <num value="2">second</num> Prior, between A.

There must, however, be some error in this statement, as the last fire really happened in A. D. <datestruct value="1136"><year reg="1136">1136</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> &ldquo;by which this House was reduced to great straits, in consequence of the City being to be rebuilt: and for the better maintaining of this Church for the future, the Prior and Brothers then all unanimously thought fit to sell the lands then acquired to this Church, though reserving for ever some small income from the same. And now because the world takes pleasure in deceiving every <num value="1">one</num>, and is grown so wicked as to contradict and oppose the actions of the ancients, that scarcely any <num value="1">one</num> will willingly suffer our revenues to be quietly paid us, without very great store of evidences, and those most authenticly proved from antiquity for our present justification;&mdash;I, therefore, Brother Thomas of Exebrugge, called the son of John Cornwall, Priest and Professed Canon of this Church, do undertake to renew this Rental, not according to the names of the several Priors, but according to the order of the old books, with the names in them written; as also, if I can, to express the Tenements, and with whose tenements they now stand; as also the names of those now inhabiting the same, for the better information of posterity.&rdquo; It is possible that the deed of sale from the Prior and Convent of the Holy Trinity to the Prioress and Nuns of St. Helen's, represented in the <num value="1">first</num> of the annexed Plates,&mdash;was <num value="1">one</num> of the alienations above referred to; though it should be observed that the words of the chapter are &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>sine aliquo retenemento</hi>,&rdquo; and consequently no quit-rent was reserved in this instrument. The property conveyed by it was but a small part of that possessed by the Priory in the Parish of All Saints, or St. Catherine-Colman Church, Fen-Church Street; the total revenue of which is entered in the Rental above noticed at <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="11">11</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi> In noticing the engraved fac-simile of this ancient charter, it should be farther observed, in illustration, that it was written in duplicate upon the same parchment, the heads of the <num value="2">two</num> copies being placed opposite each other, with a word or certain letters inserted between them; which being cut through the middle when the instrument was executed, the counterparts had each of them half the word at the top, and might at any time be proved genuine by their perfect agreement when laid together. Instruments of this kind are generally called a pair of indentures, from the separation being usually made with an indented or waving line; but they were anciently frequently entitled <hi rend=italics>chirographa</hi>, from the word <hi rend=italics>chirographum</hi> being usually written between them in capital letters. In the present instance the initials appear to be R. P. F. &amp; C.; characters perhaps signifying Richardus Prioris et Fratrum Conventus; the hand-writing is of the species called the Norman current. The original of the present charter was doubtless that preserved in the archives of the Priory at Aldgate, since it bears the common seal and secretum of the Nunnery of St. Helen; whilst the copy retained at that House would have affixed to it the seals of Trinity Priory. The <num value="3">third</num> seal, that of the Dean of St. Paul's, was added in confirmation of the sale; since the same charter of Queen Maud which liberated this establishment from the authority of the Church of Waltham and all others, adds, &ldquo;excepting that of the Church of St. Paul, and of the Bishop, in all things which belong to them.&rdquo;<NOTE N="f"><P>Strype's Stowe's &ldquo;Survey of London,&rdquo; book ii. chap. ii. p. <num value="12">12</num>.</NOTE>

<P>It is stated by Fuller that &ldquo;Christ-Church near Aldgate was <num value="1">first</num> and solely dissolved, whilst as yet all others Abbeys flourished in their height as safely and securely as before;&rdquo; but notwithstanding the extent of its ancient possessions, it is probable that the irretrievable decay of its prosperity, and the Prior's hope of being better provided for, were the chief causes which induced so ready a resignation of the Church. It appears by the instrument of surrender that it was given up to the King, <datestruct VALUE="1531-02-4"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=4>4th</day>, <year reg=1531>1531</year></datestruct>-<num value="32">32</num>, the <num value="23">23</num>d year of Henry VIII. by Nicholas Hancock, the last Prior, with the Convent assembled in Chapter, by a deed sealed with their common seal; and on the <num value="25">25th</num> of the same month, the Prior and eighteen of the Canons recognised and subscribed the surrender in the Chapter-house, before Richard Watkins, LL.B., Public Notary, and Rowland Lee and John Olyver, Masters in Chancery. In this instrument it is stated that the House was not moderately sunken in its produce, rents, provisions, and emoluments; but was in reality entirely reduced and heavily oppressed with debt. The Chapter, therefore, maturely weighing and considering that it must be utterly annihilated in both spirituals and temporals, unless the King, as the existing founder and patron of the Monastery or Priory, presently provided and succoured it with some speedy remedy:&mdash;gave and granted it to the King, to all the effect of law; and submitted themselves, their Monastery, and all their rights, into his hands, with free power and authority to alienate and dispose of them to whatever purposes he thought proper.<NOTE N="g"><P>The original of this instrument is printed entire in Rymer's &ldquo;F&oelig;dera,&rdquo; Edit.

<P>Stow relates that when Sir Thomas Audley became possessed of the Priory, he offered the great Church<NOTE N="i"><P>A list of some of the Monuments contained in the great Church of the Priory of the Holy Trinity, will be found in Strype's Stow's &ldquo;Survey of London,&rdquo; book ii. iv. p. <num value="58">58</num>; the most remarkable of which were those of Baldwin, son of King Stephen, and Maud, daughter of the same Monarch, married to the Earl of Milan; Henry Fitzalwine, <num value="1">First</num> Lord Mayor of London; and Geoffrey Mandeville, Earl of Essex.</NOTE> with a ring of <num value="9">nine</num> well-tuned bells to the inhabitants of the Parish of St. Catherine-Christ-Church, in exchange for their small Parish Church, intending to have taken it down and to have built on the site towards the street; but as there were many doubts of the lawfulness or security of the contract they refused it. He then offered the Priory-Church and steeple to any <num value="1">one</num> who would take them down and carry them away, but no person would venture to do so: whereupon, says Stow, to whom all these circumstances must have been well known, &ldquo;Sir Thomas Audley was fain to be at more charges to take it down than could be made of the stones, timber, lead, iron, &amp;c. For the workmen with great labour beginning at the top, loosened stone from stone and threw them down, whereby the most part of them were broken, and few remained whole, and those were sold very cheap; for all the buildings <hi rend=italics>then</hi> made about the City were of brick and timber.

<P>In the slight representation of this place contained in the Plan of London executed by Radulphus Aggas about <datestruct value="1562--"><year reg="1562">1562</year></datestruct>, it appears of a triangular shape, enclosed by several buildings, extending from a square embattled gate leading into the churchyard of St. Catherine-Christ-Church, to Aldgate; where they form a rounded wall. Within this space, immediately behind the Church, are several large edifices, with gardens beyond; the northern side being bounded by a straight wall, leaving a long narrow lane between it and the City-wall: part of which lane is the present Duke-Street, Aldgate. Another square embattled gate appears on this north side, leading into the great gardens of the place out of the lane; but the point of this triangle next Aldgate is cut off by a straight wall, enclosing some smaller houses and a garden. The South Gate of the Priory of the Holy Trinity, represented in the <num value="2">second</num> of the annexed Plates, appears not to have been destroyed by Sir Thomas Audley, but was probably reserved as the principal entrance to his own mansion; though it is concealed in the Plan by Aggas, which shews only the walls leading up to it. This part of the Priory was situate in the lower end of Bury-Street, formerly called Cree-Church Lane, as exhibited in the Plan of the site below the annexed View. The gate was the last considerable vestige of either the Priory or Mansion which continued to modern times.<NOTE N="c"><P>Pennant observes that &ldquo;<num value="2">two</num> gateways and some parts of the ruins of this Priory may be still traced enveloped in more modern buildings; and some of the south transept may be discovered in certain houses: from which it appears that the architecture was of the round arch or Saxon style.&rdquo; <hi rend=italics>Some Account of London.</hi> Edit.

It is there conjectured that Mitre Court here, possibly derived its name from the figure of a Mitre erected by the Bishop of London against the walls of the Priory, to indicate his ecclesiastical authority over the House already noticed. After the fire the buildings in the vicinity received considerable improvement, and a stone tablet was erected against the house on the eastern side, with the following inscription, &ldquo;Widened at the Expence of the Corporation of London, Harvey Christian Combe, Mayor, <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>.&rdquo; In digging the foundations of the new houses, parts of the old building were discovered, which were evidently continuations of the vaultings formerly appearing adjoining to the gate. The whole of the ancient entrance was not entirely removed until the end of <datestruct VALUE="1815-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>, and the present representation was taken during its destruction.

The <num value="3">third</num> Plate annexed, containing a View of the remains of the Priory in <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>, represents the principal site of the edifice in the great square called Duke's Place, or Broad Place, looking to the east. In the broken wall on the left, are shewn several ruins of arches of both the early pointed and later broad forms; the reliques of the Religious House and of the subsequent mansion erected here, some of which are drawn on a larger scale below, with reference-letters expressive of their situation. The Ground-Plan beneath is placed in the same position as the View; the narrow passage out of Duke's Street at the top of the former, being represented behind the broken wall in the latter; and the situation of the architectural remains in front is also indicated on the Plan. 
<P>Though the buildings of Duke's Place be now greatly improved, the square still remains a large space of unoccupied ground, surrounded by inferior houses, and occupied chiefly by Jews;<NOTE N="e"><P>It is observed by Mr. J.

Smith that in <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct> <hi rend=italics>all</hi> the inhabitants of the houses in Duke's Place were Jews, with only <num value="1">one</num> exception, those residing at the sign of the Fishmongers' Arms on the western side.</NOTE> who appear to have <num value="1">first</num> settled on this spot in <datestruct value="1650--"><year reg="1650">1650</year></datestruct> upon their permitted return to England under Oliver Cromwell.<NOTE N="f"><P>The Jews were in effect banished from England by the passing of the Statutes of Jewry under Edward I., when they left the kingdom to the number <num value="15060">15,060</num>, and remained in exile until the time of Oliver Cromwell; but previously to their departure they solicited the King for his writ of safe-conduct through the realm, the form of which is preserved by Sir Edward Coke, and is dated <datestruct VALUE="1289-07-18"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=18>18th</day>, <year reg=1289>1289</year></datestruct>. Upon the establishment of the Commonwealth, the Jews sent over Manasseh Ben Israel from Holland to petition the Council of State for the repeal of such laws as had been made against them, that they might return to England and be allowed St. Paul's Cathedral for a Synagogue, with the Bodleian Library at Oxford; for the procuring of all which privileges they offered <num value="5000">5,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> and Harry Marten and Hugh Peters undertook to solicit for them. The Jews who were subsequently re-established in London were chiefly from Spain and Portugal, but those who had been formerly banished were all Germans.

During this festival the book of Esther is read in the synagogue, and whenever the name of Haman is uttered, all the hearers clap their hands, stamp with their feet, and exclaim &ldquo;Let his name and memory be blotted out! The name of the wicked shall rot!&rdquo; It is also customary for the children to have little wooden hammers and to strike against the wall, as if to assist in constructing the gibbet of Haman; and as a memorial that they should endeavour to destroy the whole generation of Amalek. The prayers of this time for the deliverance of Israel, are attended by curses on Haman and his wife, and blessings on Mordecai and Esther. This is a feast of peculiar gaiety, when alms are given to the poor, relations and friends exchange presents, all furnish their tables with every luxury in their power, and somewhat indulge themselves in drinking, in memory of Esther's banquet of wine at which she defeated the designs of Haman. The origin and festivities of this season are recorded in the book of Esther, chap. ix. <num value="17">17</num>-<num value="19">19</num>, and the modern masquerade appears to be noticed by Buxtorf, who states that some Jews wore party-coloured garments during the Feast of Purim, with the tails of young foxes in their hats, in which they ran about the synagogue, exciting the congregation to laughter; and that farther to increase the mirth the <num value="2">two</num> sexes changed dresses, which, though prohibited by the Law (Deut. xxii. <num value="5">5</num>.), was considered both innocent and allowable at this time of rejoicing. &ldquo;Introduction to the Holy Scriptures,&rdquo; by Rev.

The profit derived thence to the Parish was about <num value="27">27</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>; but the Fair was at length suppressed as a nuisance, and not the less such that whilst it lasted many of the Jews went about in masks. After the dissolution of the Priory the inhabitants residing within this precinct, being left without any Parish-Church, became temporary parishioners of St. Catherine-Cree, or Christ-Church, on account of its vicinity in the churchyard of the late dissolved house. Though they became thus chargeable to another Parish, the benefit derived from them compensated for it; and they continued to enjoy the advantages and to exercise the offices the same as the real parishioners, intending, however, to erect a Church for themselves whenever they found the opportunity. At length when it was perceived that the ground of Duke's Place was to be occupied with buildings for the benefit of private persons, some of the inhabitants petitioned the Archbishop of Canterbury to intercede with James I. for their formation into a Parish, and the erection of a Parish-Church; and his Letters Patent having been issued for the same, the edifice of Trinity Christ-Church,&mdash;as it was called whilst it was building,&mdash;was reared upon &ldquo;the long-decayed ruins&rdquo; of the Priory: Sir Edward Barkham, Lord Mayor, and the court of Aldermen being great benefactors to the building.

<P>The College of St. Martin-le-Grand, in St. Martin's Lane, within Aldersgate, was founded by <hi rend=italics>Ingilricus</hi> and Edwardus (or <hi rend=italics>Girardus</hi>) his brother, in the year of Christ <datestruct value="1056--"><year reg="1056">1056</year></datestruct>. It is described of old time as a fair and large College, of a Dean and Secular Canons, or Priests,&mdash;and was confirmed by William the Conqueror, by his charter, bearing date <datestruct value="1068"><year reg="1068">1068</year></datestruct>, in the <num value="2">second</num> year of his reign; who not only permitted their enjoyment of all the lands the Founders gave, but himself gave all the moor-land without Cripplegate; and freed this Church and the Canons, from all disturbance and exaction of any Bishops, Archdeacons, or their Ministers; and from all regal services; and granted them <hi rend=italics>soc</hi> and <hi rend=italics>sac, tol</hi> and <hi rend=italics>theam</hi>, with all those ancient liberties, in the fullest manner that any Church in England had. 
<P>In former times, the Deans and Canons of St. Martin's were great men. <num value="1">One</num> <hi rend=italics>William Mulse</hi>, in the reign of Edward III. was Dean of St. Martin's; who was Chief Chamberlain of the Exchequer, Receiver and Keeper of the King's Treasure and Jewels. Then <hi rend=italics>William Dighton</hi>, a Prebendary of St. Martin's, was Clerk of the Privy Seal. <hi rend=italics>Peter de Savoy</hi> was Dean in the reign of Edward I. This Church of St. Martin's anciently was free from episcopal visitation, and even from papal exactions; and peculiarly belonged to the King; for King Henry III. brought the Pope into suit, for taking some payments from the Church of Newport, that belonged to this Deanery. 
<P>This College claimed great privileges of sanctuary, and otherwise, as appeareth in a book written by a Notary of that House, about the year <datestruct value="1442"><year reg="1442">1442</year></datestruct>, the <num value="19">19th</num> of Henry VI. wherein, amongst other things, is set down and declared, that on the <datestruct VALUE="-09-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct>, in the year aforesaid, a soldier, prisoner in Newgate, as he was led by an officer towards the Guildhall of London, there came out of <hi rend=italics>Panyer Alley</hi> <num value="5">five</num> of his fellowship, took him from the officer, and brought him into sanctuary at the west door of St. Martin's Church. But the same day <hi rend=italics>Philip Malpas</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Robert Marshall</hi>, then Sheriffs of London, with many others, entered the said Church, and forcibly took out with them the said <num value="5">five</num> men, thither fled; led them fettered to the Compter, and from thence, chained by the necks, to Newgate. Of which violent taking, the Dean and Chapter in large manner complained to the King; and required him, as their patron, to defend their privileges, like as his predecessors had done, &amp;c. All which complaint and suit, the citizens by their counsel, <hi rend=italics>Markham</hi>, Serjeant at the Law, <hi rend=italics>John Carpenter</hi>, late Common Clerk of the City, and others, learnedly answered; offering to prove, that the said place of <hi rend=italics>St. Martin</hi> had no such immunity or liberty as was pretended: namely, <hi rend=italics>Carpenter</hi> offered to lose his life-lode, if that Church had more immunity than the least Church in London. Notwithstanding, after long debating of this controversy, by the King's commandment, and assent of his Counsel in the Star Chamber, the Chancellor and Treasurer sent a writ unto the Sheriffs of London, charging them to bring the said <num value="5">five</num> persons, with the cause of their taking and withholding, afore the King in his Chancery, on the vigil of <hi rend=italics>Allhallows.</hi> On which day the said Sheriffs, with the Recorder and Council of the City, brought and delivered them accordingly, afore the said Lords; when the Chancellor, after he had declared the King's commandment, sent them to <hi rend=italics>St. Martin's</hi>, there to abide freely, as in a place having franchises, whiles them liked, &amp;c. 
<P>This Church, or Chapel, of St. Martin, with the sanctuary and precinct thereof, and all advowsons, gifts, collations of all canonries, prebends, churches, vicarages, chapels, chantries, hospitals, &amp;c., belonging thereunto, were by King Henry VII. on <datestruct VALUE="-07-23"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=23>23</day></datestruct>, in the <num value="18">18th</num> year of his reign, given and granted to the Monastery of <hi rend=italics>St. Peter</hi> in Westminster. Afterwards, when that Monastery was made a Bishoprick by King Henry VIII., this Church or Chapel of <hi rend=italics>St. Martin</hi>, with the premises, were granted by that King, in the <num value="32">32</num>d of his reign, to the Bishop of Westminster; and afterwards, in the <num value="34">34th</num> of his reign, to the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, upon the endowment of them. But upon the dissolution of the episcopal See by King Edward VI., that King, by his Letters Patents, bearing date <datestruct VALUE="-04-1"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=1>1</day></datestruct>, the <num value="4">4th</num> of his reign, granted the jurisdiction of the site of this College, together with the precinct and territory of the same (among other exempt jurisdictions in this Diocese), as to ecclesiastical matters, to the Bishop of London, and to his successors for ever. Though afterwards, in the same King's reign, this, with the rest of the jurisdictions, privileges, and immunities belonging to the Church of <hi rend=italics>Westminster</hi>, were by Act of Parliament restored to the Dean and Chapter there; which in Queen Mary's time, when she again made it a Monastery, were enjoyed by the Abbot and Convent during her reign, and to this very day by the Dean and Chapter, from the time that Queen Elizabeth converted it into a Collegiate Church, in <datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Since the time that King Henry VII. gave this College to the Church of <hi rend=italics>Westminster</hi>, all processes to be executed within this Liberty, are directed by the Sheriffs of London to the Constable of the Dean and Chapter of the Collegiate Church of <hi rend=italics>Westminster</hi>, of their Liberty within the precinct of <hi rend=italics>St. Martin-le-Grand</hi>, in the City of London, to whom the execution of such processes within that Liberty belongs to be done. This is the sole and only Liberty acknowledged to be within the City of London where foreigners dwell, and use their trades, without the jurisdiction of the Lord Mayor or Sheriffs of London, and where they keep a court of their own, within their own precinct, of which there is a Steward or Judge. 
<P>This College was surrendered to King Edward VI. in the <num value="2">second</num> year of his reign, anno <datestruct value="1548"><year reg="1548">1548</year></datestruct>; and the same year the College Church being pulled down, in the east part thereof a large wine tavern was built; and withal down to the west, and throughout the whole precinct of that College, many other houses were built, and highly prized by foreigners and others that claimed and enjoyed the privilege granted to the Canons, serving God day and night there (for such are the words in the Charter granted by the Conqueror), which can hardly be wrested to extend to artificers, buyers, sellers, &amp;c. <pb id="p.118" n="118"> 
<P>In clearing for the new Post Office, a Crypt was discovered, a view of which, with the workmen employed, is engraved from a drawing made on the spot, with a ground-plan of the structure; but on further progress, more satisfactory points of observation appearing, it was deemed necessary to make other drawings of the same subject, S. E. and S. W. views of which are given on a <num value="2">second</num> Plate, under the steeple view of the Church of St. Vedast, and the ruins of the burial-ground of St. Leonard, Foster Lane, which Church was destroyed in the dreadful fire in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>. The groined pointed arch of this subterraneous edifice was an object of universal admiration to all who visited the spot, for the short period it was permitted to stand, subsequent to its being found by the workmen. That the light ribbed stone-work arched roof, springing from the supporting columns, should resist the immense weight of building it had supported for so many ages, was a matter of general wonder. The stone coffin represented in the views, was of great antiquity, and in all probability was that of <num value="1">one</num> of the early Deans of this College: in shape it differs materially from those we generally see, the socket being only formed to receive the head, and no way moulded to the breadth of the shoulders, but regularly sloping to the feet. 
<P>This College was repaired at the expense of <hi rend=italics>William de Wickham</hi>, Dean of the same, about the year <datestruct value="1367"><year reg="1367">1367</year></datestruct>, who is said to have had many accumulated preferments before he was promoted to the See of Winchester. 
<P>St. Leonard, Foster Lane, the ruins of which and its burial-place appear in the view (with part of St. Vedast's Church and Steeple), was founded between the years <datestruct value="1231--"><year reg=1231>1231</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1241--"><year reg=1241>1241</year></datestruct>, by the Dean and Canons of <hi rend=italics>St. Martin-le-Grand</hi>, as appears in the London Registry (<hi rend=italics>lib. Bandake</hi>), and continued in the patronage of the Dean of St. Martin-le-Grand, till Henry VII. annexed that Deanery to the Abbey of Westminster; and from that time it continued in that Abbot and Convent, and after them in the Dean and Chapter of Westminster to the present time. 
<P>The old churchyard belonging to this parish, situate on the north side of the church, containing about <num value="90">90</num> feet in length, and about <num value="12">12</num> feet and a half in breadth, being too little for their burying-place, was, by agreement of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster leased out for <num value="61">61</num> years to <hi rend=italics>John Weaver</hi> and others, churchwardens and inhabitants of the said parish; and a greater piece of ground, containing in breadth, at the east end <num value="79">79</num> feet, and at the west end <num value="75">75</num> feet and <num value="3">three</num> inches; and in length, at the north side <num value="93">93</num> feet and a half, and on the south side <num value="79">79</num> feet or thereabouts, within the precincts of <hi rend=italics>St. Martin's</hi> aforesaid, called the <hi rend=italics>Dean's Garden</hi>, taken by the said church wardens and inhabitants for the term of <num value="62">62</num> years; and being walled in for a burying-place for the inhabitants of this parish, and called the new churchyard, was granted, by way of exchange, for <num value="61">61</num> years to the parson and parishioners; all which was confirmed by <hi rend=italics>John Aelmer</hi>, then Bishop of London, <datestruct VALUE="1579-10-25"><month reg="10">Oct.</month> <day reg=25>25</day>, <year reg=1579>1579</year></datestruct>, but so that it should not be prejudicial to the ordinary jurisdiction of the Bishops and Archdeacons of London for the future. This Church being burnt down in the fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, was annexed to that of <hi rend=italics>Christ Church</hi>, which is now the parochial church of both parishes; both of which together were made of the yearly value of <num value="200">200</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> in lieu of tithes to the incumbent; and by Act <num value="44">44</num> Geo.

<P>The Church of St. Vedast, the steeple of which forms a prominent feature in the view, stands on the east side of Foster Lane, and is named after St. Vedast, once Bishop of Arras, of whom many miracles are recorded. Stow mentions it as a fair church, newly built; and that <hi rend=italics>Henry Coot</hi>, goldsmith, <num value="1">one</num> of the Sheriffs of London, deceased in <datestruct value="1509--"><year reg="1509">1509</year></datestruct>, built St. Dunstan's Chapel here. <hi rend=italics>John Throwston</hi>, another of the Sheriffs of London, in <datestruct value="1516--"><year reg="1516">1516</year></datestruct>, gave to the building of this Church <num value="100">100</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> by his testament. <hi rend=italics>John Brown</hi>, Serjeant-Painter, Alderman, deceased in <datestruct value="1532--"><year reg="1532">1532</year></datestruct>, was a great benefactor, and was here buried. This Church was repaired and beautified in <datestruct value="1614--"><year reg="1614">1614</year></datestruct>, and at the chancel end were added <num value="20">twenty</num> feet of ground; which ground, so to lengthen the Church, was given to the parish out of a fair court then belonging to <hi rend=italics>Sadlers' Hall.</hi>

<P>The Church of <hi rend=italics>St. Vedast</hi> is a rectory, and <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="13">thirteen</num> peculiars within this city, belonging to the Archbishop of Canterbury, of which the Prior and Chapter of Canterbury seem to have been patrons till the year <datestruct value="1351"><year reg="1351">1351</year></datestruct>, inclusive; but some time after that, it appears likewise, that the said Archbishops have been and continued patrons thereof, from the year <datestruct value="1421"><year reg="1421">1421</year></datestruct> to the present time. 
<P>The Church suffered much in the dreadful fire; yet not so, but that it was afterwards repaired, for the most part upon the old walls; and the tower or steeple stood till the year <datestruct value="1694"><year reg="1694">1694</year></datestruct>; but it being very much weakened by the fire, the parishioners caused it to be wholly taken down, and rebuilt it from the foundation, at their own charges, and such benefactions as they could obtain. It is made the parochial Church for this and the parish of <hi rend=italics>St. Michael le Quern</hi>, which is annexed to it, and both together were made of the yearly value of <num value="160">160</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> in lieu of tithes to the incumbent; and by the above-mentioned Act of <num value="44">44</num> Geo. III. augmented to <num value="266">266</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="13">13</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>

<P>The Church of <hi rend=italics>St. Vedast</hi> is <num value="69">69</num> feet long, <num value="51">51</num> feet broad, and <num value="36">36</num> feet high to the roof; and is well enlightened by a range of windows, placed so high that the doors open under them. The tower is plain, and the spire, which is short, rises from a double base. 
<P>After the fire of London, when the Parliament annexed to this Church the parish of <hi rend=italics>St. Michael le Quern</hi>, the right of presentation was vested in the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's, alternately. 
<P>The association of St. Martin-le-Grand College with the Churches of <hi rend=italics>St. Leonard</hi> and St. Vedast, Foster Lane, is in consequence of their immediate vicinity, and because St. Leonard's appertained to the College of St. Martin-le-Grand, the presentation to which peculiarly belonged to the Deans of this place, prior to the grant of Henry VII. 
<P>By the <num value="39">39th</num> section of the Act for enlarging and improving the west end of Cheapside, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., the Corporation of London were bound to purchase a fit and convenient burial-ground, within the distance of a quarter of a mile from the usual burial-ground of St. Leonard, Foster Lane, in lieu thereof; which has been effected by the procuration of what the Act required, in the parish of St. Botolph, immediately adjoining the burial-place of the said parish. <pb id="p.119" n="119">

<P>This structure is situated on the east side, and near the principal avenue of Guildhall. Stow and Speed both assert that its <num value="1">first</num> foundation was about the year <datestruct value="1299"><year reg="1299">1299</year></datestruct>, and that it was dedicated to St. Mary Magdalen and All Saints. It was distinguished by Stow as &ldquo;the Chapel or College of our Lady Mary Magdalen and All Saints, by Guildhall.&rdquo; 
<P>But Newport, in his Repertorium, I. p. <num value="361">361</num>, disputes the authority of both these historians. &ldquo;For I find,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that the very charter of foundation of this College or Chapel, under the seals of <num value="2">two</num> of the founders, viz. Adam Francis and Hen. de Frowick (for which surname Speed has left a blank), the other founder, Peter Fanlore (not Peter Stanbury, as Speed has it), being dead some while before, bears date on the morrow of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Ann. <datestruct value="1368--"><year reg="1368">1368</year></datestruct> (<num value="42">42</num> Edw. III.), which is about <num value="69">sixty-nine</num> years after the foundation by them mentioned, and confirmed on the same day by Simon Sudbury, Bishop of London, in the <num value="7">seventh</num> year of his consecration; though it is mentioned also in the same charter to be dedicated somewhat before by Michael (i. e. Mich. Northburgh), Bishop of London, who was made bishop of that see in <datestruct value="1354--"><year reg="1354">1354</year></datestruct>, and was Simon's immediate predecessor. It appears farther by the said charter, that this Chapel or College was dedicated as well to the honour of God and the blessed <hi rend=italics>Mary Genetrici su&aelig;</hi>, as to <hi rend=italics>Mary Magdalen</hi> and <hi rend=italics>All Saints;</hi> that it was founded for <num value="5">five</num> chaplains, whereof <num value="1">one</num> of them was to be the 
<hi rend=italics>custos</hi>, to celebrate therein divine offices for the souls of Roger de Frowick, Mary his wife, Reginald and Sabina, John Luter, and Isabel his wife; the aforesaid Peter Fanlore, who (as &lsquo;t is there expressed) &lsquo;ante obitum ejus pr&aelig;sentem &lsquo;Cantariam proposuit nobiscum fundasse; ante tamen hujusmodi Cantari&aelig; ordinationem et fundationem completas ab &lsquo;hac luce pr&aelig;mature decessit.&rsquo; For the souls also of Mary, John, Alice, and John Anabille; for the state and health of King Edward III. and his queen, and his sons; for the soul of Michael, Bishop of London; for the state of Simon, Bishop of London; and of the mayor or custos, sheriffs, and chamberlain of London; for the state of the <num value="2">two</num> founders, Adam Francis and Henry Frowick, and their relations then living, and for their souls when dead; as also for their parents and relations already departed; and for the souls of the kings of England, bishops of London, mayors, custos's, sheriffs, and chamberlains of this city; and for the souls of the faithful deceased.&rdquo; 
<P>It was endowed with <num value="3">three</num> tenements and their appurtenances; <num value="2">two</num> of them in the parish of St. Foster, and the other in that of St. Giles, Cripplegate; out of the rents of which the <num value="4">four</num> priests to have <measure value="10bmark" type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> marks</measure> apiece yearly, and the custos <num value="13">thirteen</num>. The mayor and chamberlain for the time being were ordained supervisors after the death of the <num value="2">two</num> founders, and the survivor of them; and the overplus of the rents was to be kept in a chest with <num value="3">three</num> locks and keys in the Chamber of Guildhall; <num value="1">one</num> key to be kept by the founders or survivor of them while living, and after their death by the mayor and chamberlain; another by the custos of the said College; and the <num value="3">third</num> by the <num value="4">four</num> chaplains. This overplus of rent was from time to time to be laid out in repairs of the College; and some other annual charges ordained by the said founders to be laid out about celebrating the said Roger Frowick's anniversary, which was to be performed in the parish church of St. Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, where he lay buried. The lord mayor was to have <measure value="40d." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num> pence</measure>, and the chamberlain half a mark, yearly, for supervising the premises. 
<P>In the <num value="20">twentieth</num> year of the reign of Richard II. the King granted his license to Stephen Spilman, mercer, to bestow <num value="1">one</num> messuage, <num value="3">three</num> shops, and a garden, with the appurtenances, to the custos and chaplains of this Chapel or College, for their better maintenance, for ever. 
<P>Thus it continued till Henry VI. when that monarch, in the <num value="8">eighth</num> year of his reign, at the petition of the mayor, aldermen, and commons of London, granted his license for pulling down the said chapel, being old and ruinous, and the new-building and enlarging the same, by taking down a certain messuage on the south side of it, wherein John Barnar the custos, and the other chaplains did dwell, and adding the ground thereto; in compensation whereof the mayor and commonalty were, by virtue of the same king's license, to assign over to the said custos and chaplains for ever <num value="1">one</num> other messuage on the north side of Guildhall, for the habitation. 
<P>The same king in the <num value="27">27th</num> year of his reign, granted to the parish clerks in London &ldquo;a guild of St. Nicholas for <num value="2">two</num> chaplains by them to be kept in the said Chapel of St. Mary Magdalen near Guildhall, and to keep <num value="7">seven</num> almspeople.&rdquo; 
<P>In <datestruct value="1428--"><year reg="1428">1428</year></datestruct> Sir Henry Barton, skinner, mayor, founded a chaplaincy here; Sir Roger Depham, mercer; and Sir William Langford, had also chaplains here. 
<P>This Chapel or College had ultimately a custos, <num value="7">seven</num> chaplains, <num value="3">three</num> clerks, and <num value="4">four</num> choristers. The mayor and chamberlain were patrons, and the bishop of London ordinary of the chapel.

<P>In page <num value="52">52</num> of the same Register, it appears that this Chapel was enlarged on the petition of the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty of the city of London, by charter of King Henry VI. dated at Canterbury, the <datestruct VALUE="-04-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, in the <num value="8">eighth</num> year of his reign; and by which charter the warden and chaplains of the Chapel were made a corporation.

<P>It remained under this government until it was surrendered at the general dissolution of monasteries, when the Chapel was appropriated to the use of the lord mayor and aldermen, and there used to be prayers and sermons every court day, as well as upon public occasions, till about <num value="40">forty</num> years since, when the building was converted to a Court of Requests. 
<P>This Chapel suffered from the great fire in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>; the upper part was burut, but the walls escaped; so that the upper windows, which were originally built in the Gothic style, were rebuilt of the Tuscan order. 
<P>When used for divine worship, the walls were hung with tapestry; and at the west end was a gallery, which was peculiarly appropriated for the lord mayor and his attendants. The aldermen were accommodated with seats of oak, on each side of the Chapel, and there was also a handsome pulpit and reading-desk. Under the gallery were carved the arms of England, below which, on a projection, were carved the arms of the city of London. The altar-piece was very handsome. 
<P>The whole dimensions of the Chapel were, the nave and chancel <num value="78">78</num> feet in length, breadth <num value="47">47</num> feet, and height <num value="40">40</num> feet.

<P>So cautious, indeed, were our ancestors in their care to remove the infectious, that it is said a writ is among our ancient law-books, entitled, &ldquo;De Leproso amovendo.&rdquo; 
<P>King Edward III. in the <num value="20">twentieth</num> year of his reign, gave commandment to the Mayor and Sheriffs of London, to make proclamation in every Ward of the City and Suburbs &ldquo;that all leprous persons inhabiting there, should avoid within <num value="15">fifteen</num> days next; and that no man suffer any such leprous person to abide within his house and to incur the King's displeasure. And that they should cause the said lepers to be removed into some <hi rend=italics>out-places</hi> of the fields, from the haunt or company of sound people.&rdquo; 
<P>Lepers about this period were very frequently in the city; and the disease of leprosy was so infectious, that as there were many separate houses for these people to dwell by themselves, they had their overseers and keepers; there were also certain laws and regulations formed by the corporation for their government. Among these were,&mdash;&ldquo;I. That the keepers of lepers should be disburdened from inquest.&mdash;II. That the lepers should not walk through, nor tarry in the streets.&mdash;III. The keepers of the city gates were restricted, by an oath, from permitting lepers to enter the city.&mdash;IV. Briefs were allowed for removing them from the city and suburbs.&mdash;V. Other briefs were also allowed for levying the sum of an <measure value="100s." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> shillings</measure> out of tenements belonging to lepers, and delivering it to their officers for the sustenance of the afflicted.&rdquo; 
<div2 type=section id="c.34.49"><HEAD>St. James's Hospital; Now the Chapel Royal, St. James's Palace.</HEAD>

<P><num value="1">One</num> of the most ancient foundations for lepers seems to be that dedicated to St. JAMES, near Westminster, now the Royal Palace, which, according to Leland and Stow, was <num value="1">first</num> founded by citizens of London before the Conquest, for <num value="14">fourteen</num> leprous virgins, living chaste lives; to which foundation, in the reign of Edward I., the citizens gave lands in Hendon, Caldecot, and Hampstead. That monarch also, in the eighteenth year of his reign, granted and confirmed, for the benefit of this Hospital, a fair to be held on the Vigil of St. James and the <num value="4">four</num> next days. And thus St. James's Hospital continued till the dissolution of religious houses, when it was suppressed by Henry VIII., being then valued at <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure> <hi rend=italics>per annum.</hi> Henry, approving of the situation, rebuilt the whole for his residence, and formed the land around it into a park and honour. It has ever since continued to be a Royal Palace. 
<div2 type=section id="c.34.50"><HEAD>St. Giles's Hospital.</HEAD>

<P>The next ancient foundation was that of St. Giles's in the Fields, by Queen Maud, consort of Henry I. in the year <datestruct value="1117"><year reg="1117">1117</year></datestruct>; and she endowed it with <measure value="40s." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num> shillings</measure> yearly rent, out of Queen-Hythe, to provide food for the lepers. This was afterwards a cell to the Hospital of Burton Lazars, in Leicestershire; and thus it continued till its dissolution by Henry VIII. At this Hospital the prisoners conveyed from London to Tyburn for execution, were presented with a great bowl of ale to drink at their pleasure, as their last refreshment in this world. <pb id="p.122" n="122"> 
<P>This estate, with its appurtenances, were granted by Henry VIII. to Viscount Dudley, afterwards the ambitious Duke of Northumberland, during the reign of Edward VI. He was attainted in the next reign, together with his sons, John, Sir Ambrose, Sir Guildford, and Henry. The son of Ambrose became afterwards Earl of Leicester, and married, for his <num value="2">second</num> wife, Douglas, daughter of William Howard, Baron of Effingham, and widow of Jonn, Lord Sheffield, in whose lifetime he married her; consequently the issue was considered illegal. This issue, that considered himself legitimate, notwithstanding his father's opinion, was Robert, who having pursued his suit at law, and was nonsuited, in disgust retired to Italy, where he became so famous, that he was created a Duke of the Empire, by the title of Duke of Northumberland. His widow, Alice, daughter of Sir Thomas Leigh, Bart. of Stonely, in the county of Warwick, was, by Letters Patent of Charles I. created Duchess Dudley, during her life, which was confirmed by Charles II. She was a lady of great piety; and when the parish church of St. Giles in the Fields was rebuilt about that period, the Duchess, whose residence was in the parish, on the site of the Hospital (probably the avenues which now go by the name of Dudley Court, &amp;c.), gave towards the rebuilding that structure <num value="100">100</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> besides the organ, hangings, <num value="6">six</num> bells, &amp;c. She died at her house, near St. Giles' Church, <datestruct VALUE="1669-01-22"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=22>22</day>, <year reg=1669>1669</year></datestruct>. Her daughters were Lady Frances Kniveton, and Lady Holbourne, for whom jointly a stately monument was erected, part of which is at present situated in the north aisle of this church. 
<div2 type=section id="c.34.51"><HEAD>Great Ilford Hospital, Essex.</HEAD>

<P>The Hospital at Great Ilford, in Essex, <num value="6">six</num> miles from London, was erected and liberally endowed by Adeliza, Abbess of Barking, in the reign of King Stephen, for a prior, warden, <num value="2">two</num> priests, and <num value="13">thirteen</num> poor leprous brethren. She endowed the Hospital with forest-land brought into tillage, and denominated <hi rend=italics>assart</hi>, in Essholt; and also other lands in Upminster, Aveley, &amp;c. in the same county. 
<P>Ralph de Stratford, Bishop of London, in <datestruct value="1346--"><year reg="1346">1346</year></datestruct>, during his visitation in this part of his diocese, observing several abuses in Ilford Hospital, caused the following statutes to be made for its better regulation: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><P><num value="1">1</num>. That the lepers be chosen out of the demesnes of the Abbey of Barking, if there were any. 
<P><num value="2">2</num>. That the Abbess of Barking, and Master and Brethren, present alternately.

<P><num value="7">7</num>. That the Abbess shall appoint the Master of the said Hospital. 
<P><num value="8">8</num>. That every brother shall, at his admission, make oath to live chastely, to be obedient to the Abbess and Convent of Barking, to have nothing in propriety, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
<P>The establishment was governed by these statutes till the dissolution, when its revenues, according to Speed, were valued at <num value="16">16</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> <num value="13">13</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>d. per annum.</hi>

<P>The site of the Hospital and chapel were granted to Thomas Fanshaw, Esq.

<P>The Hospital stands on the south side of the road, and occupies <num value="3">three</num> sides of a small quadrangle, the centre of which is the chapel, which seems to have been built about the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century.

The whole has a neat appearance from the road, but is considerably out of repair; and the revenues of this foundation are at present very inconsiderable.

<div2 type=section id="c.34.52"><HEAD>Lock Hospital, Kent Street, Southwark.</HEAD>

<P>The next structure, in point of antiquity, that we shall notice, is the Hospital in Kent Street, Southwark, denominated <hi rend=italics>Le Loke.</hi>

<P>This Hospital, situated without Saint George's Bars, in Kent Street, Southwark, called The Loke, was a Lazarhouse, or Hospital for leprous persons, dedicated to the Virgin and to Saint Leonard. The period of its <num value="1">first</num> foundation is not discoverable; yet there is reason to conclude it had existed long anterior to the reign of Edward II., inasmuch as in the <num value="14">14th</num> year of that King there is extant on the patent roll, a writ of protection, not very unlike the briefs of the present date, at which time the revenues of the Hospital were insufficient for its support. In this writ, after reciting, that <hi rend=italics>the master and brethren of the Hospital of the blessed Mary and of Saint Leonard, for lepers, without Southwark</hi>, had not wherewith to support themselves, unless other relief was afforded them by the faithful and devout; and, in order to prevent their being oppressed by injuries, and for their more quietly serving God, the King granted his protection for <num value="2">two</num> years to them, and their men, and possessions; prohibiting all persons, during that period, from doing them any wrong, molestation, or damage; and, further, beseeching all his loving subjects (as they should look for favour from God and thanks from the King) piously and mercifully to aid the said master and brethren, by charitable donations, whenever they should ask alms at their hands. 
<P>Strype's Stow, vol. ii. p. <num value="20">20</num>, edit. <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, states, that &ldquo;John Pope, by his will, dated <datestruct value="1437--"><year reg="1437">1437</year></datestruct>, gave to the governors of the house of the poor leprous, called Le Lokes, without St. George's Bar, in Southwark, <num value="1">one</num> annual rent of <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">six</num> shillings and <num value="8">eight</num> pence</measure> sterling, <hi rend=italics>de illis tresdecim solidatis et</hi> <num value="4">4</num> <hi rend=italics>denariis</hi>, of rent due to him, and that descended to him by hereditary right, by the death of Thomas Pope, of Sherman, his father, out of the tenements and shops formerly belonging to John Champeneys, in Shetebone (Sherborn) Lane, in the parish of St. Mary Abchurch, which was situated in length between the garden of Thomas St. Edmund on the west, and the little lane towards the said church on the east; and extend in breadth to the tenements of John de Herford and John Joy, and the garden of the said Thomas St. Edmund on the west, unto Shetebone Lane towards the north, &amp;c. to the reparation and maintenance of the said house of lepers for ever. Those foresaid tenements of the said John Champeneys belonged to the master, brethren, and sisters of the Hospital of St. Catharine, near the Tower.&rdquo; 
<P>We have preserved in the plate given of this Hospital the only remains of it before it was finally demolished a few years since. Over the chapel, which forms part of the view, was affixed a stone, of which Aubrey, in his History of Surrey, vol. v. p. <num value="102">102</num>, gives the following description:

<div2 type=section id="c.34.53"><HEAD>Lock Hospital at Kingsland.</HEAD>

<P>The next foundation of this kind that we shall have occasion to notice, is that at Kingsland. Mr. Nelson, in his History of Islington, informs us, &ldquo;that soon after the endowment of St. Bartholomew's Hospital by Henry VIII. certain <pb id="p.124" n="124"> Lock or Lazar Hospitals were opened for the reception of persons afflicted with the venereal disease at a distance from the city, to which places they were sent by the governors, and thus kept apart from the other patients, the disorder being in those times considered as contagious, wherefore they were removed entirely from the capital. Each of these houses was under the care of a surgeon, a chaplain, and a sister, a nurse and helper; and each contained about <num value="20">twenty</num> beds.&rdquo; In the survey of the manor, <datestruct value="1611--"><year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct>, this is called <hi rend=italics>Kingsland Spittle.</hi> The Hospital, a modern building, has been long disused, and is the residence of a corn-dealer. Over the door are the armorial bearings of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. 
<P>The chapel appears from its architecture to be ancient, and probably that attached to the original Lazar-house, and was so contrived, that the patients could neither see, nor be seen by, any other part of the congregation. It is a small stone building, in length, from east to west <num value="27">27</num> feet, by <num value="18">18</num> from north to south, and its utmost height to the roof on the outside, not more than <num value="20">20</num> feet. The pulpit is upon a level with, and the floor <num value="3">three</num> feet below, the road. The roof is overgrown with moss and weeds, and in a small turret is contained a bell, which is rung by means of a string passing through a hole into the gallery. The plate sufficiently describes the exterior and interior of the building, which is in a very dilapidated state. Kingsland is a hamlet, partly in the parish of Hackney and partly in that of Islington, in the latter of which the chapel is situated. 
<P>In an account belonging to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, ending at Michaelmas <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, are the following notices:

<P>The hamlet of Knightsbridge is situated about a mile on the east side of Kensington Church, in the great road that leads from London towards the western parts of England, and was until late years partly in the parish of St. Martin in the Fields, and partly in that of St. Margaret Westminster; but is now solely appertaining to that of St. George's Hanover Square. 
<P>There was remaining so recently as when Newcourt was making collections for his Repertorium (anno <datestruct value="1720"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>), a lazar-house or hospital, which was held under the church of Westminster, and destitute of endowment, though the patients were usually between <num value="30">thirty</num> and <num value="40">forty</num> in number, and received no other aid towards their support and cure than what resulted from the voluntary contributions of the public, in a way similar to those of some of our present hospitals and public dispensaries. When, or by whom, this lazar-house was <num value="1">first</num> erected, and established for that purpose, is not known; but that it was of very ancient origin is certain; for in the year <datestruct value="1629"><year reg="1629">1629</year></datestruct>, the inhabitants of Knightsbridge petitioned Dr. William Laud, then Bishop of London, afterwards Archbishop of Canterbury, to have leave to rebuild the Chapel belonging to this house, at their own cost and charges, the same being grown very old and ruinous, and ready to fall; and the inhabitants of the said village or hamlet being in the habit of resorting there as their general place of worship.<NOTE N="*"><P>The only accounts extant of the way in which money was raised, either for the above purpose or future repairs, is contained in the fragments of the few remaining books concerning and yet remaining within the present building, viz.:

<P>Then received of Mr. Glassington, Governour of the Hospital of Knightsbridge, for the use of the Bayliffe and Burgesses of East Thetford, in the county of Nottingham, the somme of <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure>, which was gathered for the rebuilding of the church of East Thetford aforesaid. THO. MASON.</NOTE> On which petition, the Bishop (with the approbation of the then Vicar and Churchwardens of St. Martin's) granted them his licence so to do, dated <datestruct VALUE="-07-7"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=7>7</day></datestruct>, that year, therein to frequent divine service and sermons; <pb id="p.126" n="126"> which divine offices were to be performed by a sufficient Minister, lawfully licensed from time to time, by himself or successors, Bishops of London, or their Chancellors for the time being; provided that the said inhabitants, or their families, did once every quarter of a year repair to their respective parish-churches to perform their devotions; and every 
<hi rend=italics>Easter</hi> receive the Holy Communion there, and pay all rights, duties, and profits, to their respective Ministers to which they did belong; and ordered that this licence should continue in force during the pleasure of the Bishops of London. 
<P>About <num value="5">five</num> years after (the said Chapel being built and consecrated to the use of the said Hospital, having no maintenance but what they received by alms, and were not able to maintain a Curate, or to repair the said Chapel, or to relieve themselves) it was with the assent of the Master of the said Hospital, and Curate of the said Chapel, and about <num value="7">seven</num> more of the principal inhabitants of Knightsbridge, on the <num value="3">3</num>d of <datestruct VALUE="1634-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1634">1634</year></datestruct>, ordered by Dr. Duck, then Chancellor of London, that they, or the major part of them, should place such persons in the several seats of the same, as should most conduce to the maintenance of the said Curate, the repair of the said Chapel, and the relief of the poor of the said Hospital; that they should keep a register-book for their accounts, which were to be adjusted at the end of every <num value="6">six</num> months, saving and reserving to the said Churches of <hi rend=italics>St. Martin</hi> and <hi rend=italics>St. Margaret</hi>, and to the respective incumbents of the same, all the rights, profits, and emoluments to them belonging. 
<P>At what period the Church of Westminster ceased to exercise the dispensing power of presentation to this religious and charitable establishment, is not recorded by any writer on ecclesiastical affairs that we have met with; but certain it is, <hi rend=italics>that right</hi>, as well as the fee-simple of the whole estate, has passed into private hands. Perhaps, being originally but a lazar, or beggar establishment, it was deemed unworthy the notice and attention of the dignified Deans, &amp;c., of the Church of St. Peter's. Knightsbridge Chapel, the ground on which it stands, the adjoining houses, and those opposite, became by purchase the freehold property of Dixon Gamble, Esq., father of the late Reverend John Gamble, M.A., who for some time did duty here, and was much followed and admired as a preacher: the property descends to his eldest son, a child about <num value="7">seven</num> years of age, who is intended to be brought up to the church, and to become the future pastor of this now opulent and fashionable hamlet to the metropolis. In the meanwhile, his friends and guardians have granted a lease of <num value="21">twenty-one</num> years to the Rev. Mr. J. Harris, who after performing duty here for a few years, has underlet the remainder of his term to the Rev. Mr. Foyster, who at present officiates, and is very much admired, and followed as an excellent preacher and man. 
<P>Marriages and baptisms were formerly solemnized here, but ceased in <datestruct value="1753--"><year reg="1753">1753</year></datestruct>, upon the passing of the celebrated Marriage Act, <num value="26">26</num> Geo. II. sect. <num value="33">33</num>. Registers of both are still preserved here, and consist of <num value="10">ten</num> books of various sizes, some smaller than a Common Prayer Book, bearing date from the year <datestruct value="1658"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1752--"><year reg="1752">1752</year></datestruct><NOTE N="*"><P>The earliest register of a marriage preserved in this Chapel, is in <datestruct VALUE="1658-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>, when James Emmott wedded to Anne Pitman; and the latest entry to be found in the last book kept for that purpose, is dated <datestruct VALUE="1752-12-2"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=2>2</day>, <year reg=1752>1752</year></datestruct>, when John Fry, the younger, of Bromley, in the county of Middlesex, wedded Elizabeth Eveleigh, of the same place, spinster. The only register of persons being married here from a distant county, is William Guidott, of Preston Candover, in Hampshire, widower, Esq., who on <datestruct VALUE="1739-11-30"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=30>30</day>, <year reg=1739>1739</year></datestruct>, wedded Mrs. Patience Soper, of the same place, spinster. The blank leaves remaining in the book where the entry is made of <datestruct VALUE="1752-12-2"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=2>2</day>, <year reg=1752>1752</year></datestruct>, evidently prove it to have been the latest marriage solemnized at this place. 
<P>The money raised by the briefs at Knightsbridge Chapel, and paid to the respective receivers by John Glassington, clearly proves the Hospital to be at that period in use as a charitable institution, he being, in both, designated Governor of the Hospital.</NOTE>: these books may be seen at any time by applying to the person who has the care of the Chapel, Miss Barr, daughter of the late clerk, who had filled that situation upwards of <num value="30">thirty</num> years. 
<P>Knightsbridge Chapel, though small, is capable of containing a numerous congregation, and is generally fully attended; the body of the Chapel is very neatly fitted up with pews, which, with the side ones, contain seats for nearly <num value="200">200</num> persons. The gallery surrounds the whole of the interior, except the part of the window over the communion-table. There is a very excellent, though small, organ placed in the gallery fronting this window, and a handsome Buzaglo stove in the right side aisle to keep a due temperature of warmth. The gallery is capable of containing as many persons as the body of the Chapel; and the quarterly subscription for seats to this, and to the seats beneath, is <num value="1">one</num> guinea and a half per annum. 
<P>Adjoining the Chapel is a charity-school, instituted in <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>. This establishment is supported by voluntary contributions, and at present contains <num value="36">thirty-six</num> boys and eighteen girls. The children are admitted from <num value="7">seven</num> to <num value="10">ten</num> years old, and educated until they arrive at the age of <num value="12">twelve</num>. The boys are taught reading, writing, and the elementary parts of arithmetic, and are instructed in the principles of the Church of England. The girls, in addition to the above articles of instruction, are taught plain work. 
<P>It appears that this part of the western road was dreary, and destitute of sufficient buildings to protect the traveller, in the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, as the following remark occurs in some MS. additions to Norden's Speculum Brittani&aelig;: &ldquo;Kingesbridge, commonly called Stone Bridge, is near Hyde Park Corner, where I wish no good man to walk too late, unless he can make his partie good.&rdquo; A bridge still remains over the shallow stream which crosses the high road in the vicinity of the Chapel; and this is probably the spot to which Norden alludes.&mdash;(Vide MS. Additions in Mr. Nichols's Norden.) <pb id="p.127" n="127">

<P>Though a sequestered situation was originally an indispensable quality of the cells of those religious solitaries called hermits,&mdash;their habitations in later times were often of a more social character; and were frequently constructed in church-yards at chapels, at the ends of bridges and the gates of towns:<NOTE N="*"><P><hi rend=italics>Index Monasticus</hi> by Richard Taylor of Norwich.

It cannot be doubted, however, that the name of hermit is derived from <foreign lang=Greek>*)erhmos</foreign>, a wilderness, <foreign lang=Greek>*)erhmi/ths</foreign>, a solitary.</NOTE> and the site of the present establishment once afforded a curious instance of a hermitage erected on a wall of the City of London. The founder of it is stated in a patent of Edward I. to have been Henry III., his father; but though it be in that, as well as in several other authentic instruments, always entitled only a hermitage, it appears to have been from the very <num value="1">first</num>, both in its appointments, and the importance attached to its advowson, in reality a small chantry-chapel, endowed for a single priest. It is accordingly so denominted in the following covenant, which is the earliest instrument relating to it now in print; and which was <num value="1">first</num> translated and published from the original in the possession of Sir Henry Spelman, in the &ldquo;Remains,&rdquo; added to <hi rend=italics>Anthony Munday's <num value="2">Second</num> Edition of Stow's Survey of London</hi>, <datestruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>, small folio, page <num value="924">924</num>.

<P>Know all men, present and to come, that I, Laurence de Frowik, have granted and demised, and by this present charter of mine have confirmed, unto Richard of Clerkenwell, Chaplain, all that land of mine, with the houses, buildings, and appurtenances, which I have in London, in Muckwell Street, in the Parish of St. Olave; lying between that land which William Throtegos held of me towards the south, and the land of the Friars of the New Hostel towards the north: and which extendeth itself in length from the King's highway, even unto the Wall of the City towards the west, &amp;c.

<P>The name of this Chapel does not actually occur in the preceding grant, but the land referred to in it is considered to be identified with that now forming the court-yard of the present alms-houses by <num value="2">two</num> circumstances:&mdash;namely, firstly, by the description of the boundaries,&mdash;the City wall on the west, and the Friars of the New Hostel, or the French Order of the Hospital of St. Giles, on the north;<NOTE N="*"><P>The preceding grant is dated <datestruct value="1253--"><year reg="1253">1253</year></datestruct>, the <num value="37">37th</num> and <num value="38">38th</num> of Henry III., but the period when the Hospital of the French Order of St. Giles without Cripplegate is generally stated to have flourished, is the reign of Edward I., at least <num value="20">twenty</num> years subsequent.

the pensioners themselves also attending them in their new habits. The other <num value="3">three</num> sermons ordered by the indenture are likewise preached yearly in the same Chapel. In addition to this charity endowed by Lambe, the Clothworkers' Company has thought it proper, out of the surplus rents of his bequest, to devote <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>. in pensions of <measure value="4l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="4">4</num></measure>. to poor members of the same who are styled &ldquo;Lambe's Pensioners;&rdquo; though they are indebted for this benefaction to the volantary benevolence of the Court, by which they are appointed for life. 
<P>Although the ravages of the Great Fire extended along the outer side of that part of the City wall against which Lambe's Chapel was erected, it appears to have only partially damaged the ancient edifice; since even at the rebuilding of it considerable vestiges remained of a Crypt, which seemed to be of a period yet older than that of the foundation of the hermitage-chapel by Henry III. Of this place an interesting account, with a plate containing groundplan and some architectural details, both by Mr. A. J. Kempe, was published in the <hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi> for <datestruct VALUE="1825-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, Vol. xcv. page <num value="401">401</num>, plate ii. He there states that the recent demolition of the upper part of Lambe's Chapel for the purpose of rebuilding it, gave access to the curious vault occupying the space beneath. After descending <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> narrow steps, a low vaulted chamber was entered, <num value="26">26</num> feet long from east to west, and <num value="20">20</num> feet broad; having in it originally <num value="9">nine</num> short round columns, <num value="6">six</num> of which were remaining, supporting the groined roof of the apartment. The capitals of these columns were Saxon, ornamented with leaves and volutes at the angles, and the capitals of the <num value="4">four</num> corner pillars were placed diagonally to the square of the building. Some of the intersecting stone ribs springing from the columns were plain, and others were adorned with zig-zag, twisted, and other ancient mouldings; specimens of which, with <num value="1">one</num> of the pillars, and a plan of the directions of the arches, are given on the right hand of the lower part of the present Engraving of old Lambe's Chapel. On the other side of the corresponding part of the same Plate is a Section of the ornamented mouldings from <num value="1">one</num> of the arches; and leaning against the wall, in the Interior View at the top of the Plate, is represented a Ground-plan of the Crypt, with the Outside of the Chapel. The material of which this Crypt was constructed was freestone, of a reddish colour, the surface being very considerably decomposed; and several modern brick walls intersected the building. 
<P>It will be seen, however, by the annexed View of the late Lambe's Chapel, that there were considerable alterations made in it upon repairing after the Great Fire. The south and east walls containing the arched windows were probably in great part ancient; but the square windows on the north were doubtless of a much later period. The whole structure also appears to have been beautified in <datestruct value="1612--"><year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct>, which year is inscribed in the pediment of the arch under which appears the old half-length figure of the founder beneath the eastern window of the Chapel. His effigy is dressed in the livery gown of his Company, with a flat cap; holding a purse in the right hand and gloves in the left: the ornamented elliptical arch around it is supported by <num value="2">two</num> square pyramidal pilasters, and the date in the pediment is divided by a shield bearing the arms of the Company of Clothworkers. Immediately beneath this figure was an oaken chair in which the Master of the Company sat at the annual sermons; and there were also seats for the other officers and members, and benches for the pensioners. In the great window above were <num value="4">four</num> small paintings on glass of wholelength figures of the Saints James the Apostle, Peter, Matthew, and Matthias, standing beneath arches.<NOTE N="*"><P>These paintings, with the effigy of Lambe, are engraven in Nichols' <hi rend=italics>Hist. of Leicestershire</hi>, Vol. iii. part. ii. p. <num value="843">843</num>, plate cxvi.

<P>Previous to the rebuilding of this edifice it stood on the northern side of a small irregular square of buildings with a long narrow entry, called Chapel Court, at the north-western corner of Monkwell Street; its northern and western boundaries being an angle of the City wall with the hollow base of a watch-tower at the corner, and the church yard of St. Giles Cripplegate beyond it. This watch-tower is conjectured to be most probably that mentioned as a boundary in the Charter of William I. to the Canons of St. Martin's le Grand, in <datestruct value="1067--"><year reg="1067">1067</year></datestruct>, &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>ab Aquilonare cornu muri civitatis</hi>,&rdquo; from the northern angle of the City wall.<NOTE N="*"><P><hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi>, Vol. xcv. part. i. p. <num value="401">401</num>.

<P>It was stated in the account of Lambe's charity given to the Parliamentary Commissioners, that in <datestruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></datestruct> the repairs of this Chapel amounted to <measure value="155l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="155">155</num></measure>. <num value="7">7</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi>, and that it was apprehended that when the lease of the eighteen messuages adjoining on each side of it should expire, the Court of the Company would be required to take down and rebuild the whole. The term for which they were held was <num value="28">28</num> years from Midsummer <datestruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></datestruct>;<NOTE N="*"><P><hi rend=italics><num value="6">Sixth</num> Report</hi>, p. <num value="220">220</num>, <num value="221">221</num>.</NOTE> and accordingly in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct> the Chapel was rebuilt with <num value="10">ten</num> Alms-houses, of <num value="2">two</num> rooms each, on the original site, the latter being in the Tudor style of domestic architecture. A small part of this structure is now brought forward into Monkwell Street; namely, a narrow gate, and the side of the Clerk's house, ornamented with a panel and the Clothworkers' arms sculptured in stone. The form of the area within is irregular, and at the north-west corner is a small arch leading into a piece of greensward occupying the circular base of the ancient watch-tower on the City wall. The Chapel is erected upon the old foundations, and is fitted up within with the greatest plainness and propriety, with a pointed roof, divided into squares by dark oaken ribs and pendants; and light oaken pews, desks and pulpit. At the western end is the original effigy of the founder, let into the wall, and painted in a black cap and red gown; above it is the large old painting of the Royal arms; and on the north wall beside it is a panel containing a carving of the Clothworkers' arms, coloured and gilded. Below this is the small stone font shewn in the Plate, and beneath the founder's figure are <num value="2">two</num> chairs <pb id="p.132" n="132"> for the Beadles of the Company at the annual sermons. The bells hang in a gallery over the porch of the chapeldoor, appropriated to the sextoness; the pensioners' seats are on each side the west end of the building; a fair altar with the Creed, &amp;c. occupies the east; and under the south windows is a handsome pew for the Master and Wardens of the Company, immediately opposite the pulpit. Behind the latter is the vestry, and in a small yard beside it, is the door to the ancient crypt beneath, which has been carefully preserved; the entrance to it is under a small but beautiful round Norman arch of a red-coloured stone, composed of fragments from the ancient building. The Alms-houses which are now attached to this Chapel are appropriated to <num value="10">ten</num> poor freemen of the Company, dressers or workers of cloth, who receive <num value="20">20</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> per annum each with a chaldron of coals. 
<P>It is not, however, upon the establishment of this Chapel and the preceding charities alone, that the memory of William Lambe is left to rest; since his whole fortune was employed alike in extensive acts of benevolence during his life, as well as in permanent endowments at his death: of all which the following additional and noble summary is given by Stow.<NOTE N="*"><P>Stow's

<P>&ldquo;Out of his love to learning and scholars, in the town of Sutton-Valens, in Kent, where he was born, at his own proper cost and charges he erected a Free Grammar School, for the education and instruction of youth in the fear of God, good manners, knowledge, and understanding: allowing yearly to the Master <num value="20">20</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>, and <num value="10">10</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> yearly to the Usher, from time to time, as either place shall be supplied by succession, and for their yearly stipends or perpetual pensions.

<P>This gentleman foreseeing, in his life-time the decay of sundry trades and occupations, to the utter undoing of very many, especially poor clothiers,<NOTE N="*"><P>That this decay really took place, is shewn in a curious old tract written within a very few years after the time of Lambe, by W. Stafford. though bearing the name of W. Shakespeare, Gentleman, entitled, &ldquo;A Compendious or Briefe Examination of certayne ordinary Complaints of diuers of our Countrymen in these our dayes.&rdquo; Lond. <datestruct value="1581--"><year reg="1581">1581</year></datestruct>. <num value="4">4</num>to.

<P>And as his charity extended itself thus liberally abroad in the country, so did the City of London likewise taste thereof not sparingly. For near unto Holborn he founded a fair Conduit, and a Standard with a cock at Holborn Bridge to convey thence the waste. These were begun the <datestruct VALUE="1577-03-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> day of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1577">1577</year></datestruct>, and the water carried along in pipes of lead more than <num value="2000">two thousand</num> yards, all at his own cost and charges, amounting to the sum of <datestruct value="1500--"><year reg="1500">1500</year></datestruct><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>; and the work was fully finished the <datestruct VALUE="-08-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct> in the same year. Moreover he gave to poor women, such as were willing to take pains, <num value="120">120</num> Pails, therewith to carry and serve water.<NOTE N="*"><P>Before the New River was conveyed to London, and whilst the City was imperfectly supplied with water, it was brought from the public conduit and pumps in the streets, either by inferior servants and women, or by the apprentices in the families of tradesmen. (Strype's Stows. 
<hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, Vol. II. Book v. chap. xxiv. p. <num value="329">329</num>.) There were also persons called water-bearers, who made it their entire occupation to carry water to a number of regular customers at so much each turn; <num value="1">one</num> of which class is <hi rend=italics>Cob</hi> in Ben Jonson's <hi rend=italics>Every Man in His Humour.</hi>
The vessels which they carried were called tankards, and were formed of wood hooped round with iron, shaped like a truncated cone, and held about <num value="3">three</num> gallons; they had also a small iron handle at the upper end with a chain fixed to an iron stopple, or a cover with a hinge, and were easily portable on a man's shoulders: the figure of them may be seen in the Plate of West Cheap Conduit, &amp;c. in the <num value="1">First</num> Volume of this work. &ldquo;As the last instance in remembrance of their actual use,&rdquo; says Sir John Hawkins, &ldquo;the following fact may be relied on:&mdash;About the year <datestruct value="1730"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>, Mr. James Colebrook, a very wealthy man and a banker, had a shop nearly adjoining the Antwerp Tavern behind the Royal Exchange. Opposite thereto, and against the wall of the Church of St. Bennet Fink, was a spring of water with a pump, from which a porter, employed to open and also to water and sweep the shop, every morning duly at <num value="8">eight</num> o'clock fetched water in such a tankard as is above described.&rdquo; <hi rend=italics>Antiquarian Repertory</hi>, Vol. i. p. <num value="362">362</num>. There were also women whose occupation it was to carry water in pails, as more convenient vessels for their use. The practice of thus exposing it to sale continued long after the former had entirely disappeared; it is still known in many places distant from the metropolis, and is, perhaps, not even yet quite extinct in the environs of London. <num value="1">One</num> of Marcellus Lauron's London Cries, published in the latter part of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, is the figure of an old London Water-Carrier, equipped with a yoke and pails: his cry was &ldquo;Any New River Water here!&rdquo; In the Description of England and Ireland by M.

<P>To the Parish Church of St. Giles without Cripplegate, he gave <num value="15">15</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> to the bells and chimes; intending a farther liberality thereto, if they had taken due time. 
<P>To Christ's Hospital in London, towards the bringing up of poor men's children he hath given <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> yearly for ever: and <num value="100">100</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> in ready money together, therewith to purchase lands, that their relief, by the revenues of the same, may be perpetual. 
<P>To St. Thomas's Spital, or Hospital, in Southwark, towards the succour of the sick and diseased he gave <num value="4">4</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>
yearly for ever. 
<P>An <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> pounds</measure> he intended to the Hospital called the Savoy: but by reason that such agreements could not be made as he thought convenient, his contribution that way, much against his mind, went not forward.

<P>The account of William Lambe and his benefactions by Sir John Hawkins, was originally published in the <num value="1">first</num> edition of Capt. Francis Grose's <hi rend=italics>Antiquarian Repertory</hi>, <datestruct VALUE="1782-02--"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct>, Vol. IV. No. vii. pages <num value="145">145</num>-<num value="160">160</num>, and it is there observed that about <num value="25">twenty-five</num> years before that time a Conduit was standing near the same spot, though dry, as all the City conduits then were. The ground plan of this erection was an equal-sided quadrangle, having a kind of rustic basement for about <num value="10">ten</num> feet high, in which was the pipe whence the water issued. Above this the square form still continued, presenting to view <num value="4">four</num> faces, each containing a spacious oblong panel in the centre, with Corinthian columns at the sides, surmounted by entablatures, consisting of frieze, cornice, and arched pediment, the latter enclosing a cartouche shield. From each of the angles the roof rose up in an elegant concave line, forming a tent-like termination, on the apex of which stood a lamb, the rebus of the founder's name, with his head towards Holborn Hill. This description is stated by Hawkins to have been given from memory, and he adds that the style of building was considerably later than that of <datestruct value="1577--"><year reg="1577">1577</year></datestruct>, being of such pure and classical architecture as to have been worthy of Sir Christopher Wren himself; but he appears to have known nothing of the actual date of the erection. It was in reality designed by that eminent architect, and a modern engraving<NOTE N="*"><P>Quarter-sheet print. Levens sculpsit. &ldquo;Published by A.

Hawkins supposes that it was perhaps from its convenient situation and the elegance of its form, that this conduit was allowed to stand some years after those at Cheapside, Aldermanbury, &amp;c. had been taken down; which, however, for nearly half a century previous to their demolition had been left dry: their waters having been intercepted or cut off<NOTE N="*"><P>It is observed in an article of remarks on the account of Lambe's Chapel, &amp;c. by Sir John Hawkins, printed in the <hi rend=italics>Gentleman's Magazine</hi>

It is added that many persons living at the time the article was written well remembered the taking up of numbers of leaden pipes all over the City, which had been used for the passage of the water to the conduits. The supply of these reservoirs was also entirely cut off by the Fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>; and in an official MS. book of the &ldquo;Expences of erecting Public Buildings in London after the Great Fire,&rdquo; preserved in the City Library at Guildhall, are the following entries, fol. <num value="33">33</num>a.

Meditation xl. is entitled &ldquo;The Spoiling of the City Conduits.&rdquo;</NOTE> on account of the more copious supply from the Thames and the New River, which had rendered most of them useless.

An obelisk, with lamps round it, was erected on the site, which was also soon after taken down by the City Commissioners of Pavements. The fountain, or spring-head, of this Conduit, though it has ceased to supply the bason at Holborn, was rebuilt by the City near the north end of Red Lion Street, but was also removed <pb id="p.134" n="134"> at the time of erecting the Foundling Hospital, and the water conveyed to the eastern side of the street; whence the npper half of it from Theobald's Road is now called Lamb's Conduit Street. The access to the water was then by steps leading down to the pipe whence it issued; and some particulars of its history were preserved in the following inscription which was placed above.<NOTE N="*"><P>In the description of the &ldquo;Fountains, Bridges, Conduits, &amp;c.&rdquo; of the metropolis in Edward Hatton's <hi rend=italics>New View of London</hi>, <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, <num value="8">8</num>vo. vol. ii. p. <num value="789">789</num>, it is stated concerning this aqueduct, that &ldquo;Lamb's Conduit at the north end of Red Lion Street near the fields, affords plenty of water, clear as chrystal, which is chiefly used for drinking. It belongs to St. Sepulchre's Parish, the fountain-head being under a stone marked S. S.

<P>It is a curious circumstance, that on the sites of many religious houses in the city of London and its suburbs, arose theatres for dramatic entertainments, which is peculiarly distinguishable of the structure about to be described. This spot formerly occupied the lands belonging to St. Saviour's Priory and Winchester Park. After the dissolution of the Priory, this part of it was occupied by the Globe Theatre, belonging to our immortal bard, Shakespeare, in which he acted the Ghost in his own beautiful tragedy of Hamlet. Pennant informs us that &ldquo;the gate had been lately standing.&rdquo;<NOTE N="*"><P>London, p. <num value="6">6</num>.</NOTE>

<P>Upon the disuse of the Theatre for dramatic purposes, its site again reverted to the service of religion, and was formed into a Meeting-house for Protestant Dissenters, occupying a space of <num value="2000">two thousand</num> square feet. The structure was capacious, though built of wood, and it contained <num value="3">three</num> galleries. 
<P>Its construction as a place of worship probably took place about the year <datestruct value="1672"><year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>, when Charles II. granted indulgence in favour of religious profession; and this Meeting was opened by the Rev. Mr. Thomas Wadsworth, who had been ejected from the living of St. Lawrence Poultney, in the city of London, by means of the Bartholomew Act. Mr. Wadsworth's successors were, Mr. Andrew Parsons, the famous Mr. Richard Baxter, Mr. James Lambert, Mr. Nathaniel Oldfield, Mr. Durant, Mr. Thomas Kentish, Joshua Oldfield, D. D. Benjamin Grosvenor, D. D. Obadiah Hughes, D. D. Mr. William Bushnell, and Mr. John Ward. Under the ministry of the latter gentleman, who had embraced <num value="1">first</num> the opinions of Arius, and afterwards those of Socinus, the congregation at this Meeting-house, which had been hitherto Presbyterian, declined so rapidly, that its dissolution took place about the year <datestruct value="1752"><year reg="1752">1752</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Having ceased to be a Presbyterian church, it was occupied by a congregation of Dissenters denominated Independents, whose <num value="1">first</num> minister was Mr. Mac Kensie. His successor was the late worthy minister, the Rev. Mr. Charles Skelton, who carried on his ministry for several years; but the society having declined for some years previously to his death, he resigned his charge about the year <datestruct value="1776"><year reg="1776">1776</year></datestruct>, and this Meeting-house was ultimately shut up from devotional purposes. Mr. Skelton, however, preached only occasionally, at Hare Court, Aldersgate Street; and having finished his ministerial labours, deceased on the <datestruct VALUE="1798-10-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="10">October</month> <year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="73">seventy-three</num> years. He was interred in the burial-ground at Deadman's Place, where the monument exhibited in the Plate was placed over him. 
<P>It appears that the Rev. Sir Henry Trelawney preached a charity-sermon here in the year <datestruct value="1789"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Having been desecrated as above, it was converted to various secular purposes, and was successively a place for warehousing goods; afterwards a mill was erected here to grind bones; and it is at present appropriated for the purpose of grinding stones, and similar materials. <pb id="p.137" n="137">

<P>In the reign of King James the <num value="2">Second</num>, who was not only himself a bigoted Papist, but wished to bring back the nation also into subjection to Popery and arbitrary power, every method was tried to instil Popish principles into the minds of the youthful part of the community; among these was the establishment of seminaries, into which children, of both sexes, were admitted on very easy terms. <num value="1">One</num> <hi rend=italics>Poulter</hi>, a zealous Papist, having opened a school somewhere in Southwark, gave notice that he would teach the children of the poor <hi rend=italics>gratis.</hi> This having excited considerable attention, <num value="3">three</num> gentlemen of St. Saviour's parish, Mr. Arthur Mallet, Mr. Samuel Warburton, and Mr. Ferdinande
Holland, who were all members of Mr. Nathaniel Vincent's Church in St. Thomas's Street, agreed to use their utmost endeavours to counteract Poulter's designs. Taking advantage of King James's indulgence to dissenters, in <datestruct value="1687--"><year reg="1687">1687</year></datestruct> they obtained the lease of a piece of ground in what was called the Park, Southwark; a populous neighbourhood, consisting chiefly of the lower classes, on which they erected a building at the expense of <measure value="360l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="360">360</num></measure>, for the double purpose of a School and a Meeting-house, the former being under a part of the latter. The Minister for the time being, who might be appointed to preach in the Meeting-house, was to superintend the concerns of the School, and make collections towards its support; for this purpose an annual sermon was preached in the place by different Ministers in rotation; and when it was no longer used as a place of worship, the service was removed to the Meeting-house in St. Thomas's Street. Thus originated the <hi rend=italics>Gravel Lane Charity School</hi>, the <num value="1">first</num> of the kind established by Protestant dissenters, and which has continued to the present day. Though it was at <num value="1">first</num> founded, and has since been chiefly supported, by <num value="1">one</num> class of dissenters, it has ever been conducted on so liberal a plan, as to admit the children of parents belonging to any other denomination. The management of the School has always been committed to the <num value="7">seven</num> gentlemen who are trustees of all the property appropriated to the support of the School, assisted by <num value="5">five</num> gentlemen chosen from among the subscribers. The number of children educated was, for many years, confined to <num value="60">sixty</num>; but was afterwards increased to more than double that number. In <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>, it was thought prudent to reduce them to <num value="100">one hundred</num>, which is about the present number. The children are all taught reading, writing, and accounts; and the girls are also taught plain-work and knitting: books &amp;c are provided for them without any expense to the parents. It has hitherto been supported by annual subscriptions, collections at lectures, legacies, and donations; but in consequence of the rise of several institutions of a similar kind, the deaths of subscribers, and the failure of other resources, it has been latterly on the decline. The lease of the building, which contained the original school-room, being nearly expired, and being in a very ruinous condition, it is not thought advisable to expend any money in repairing it; but when the lease shall have terminated, it is hoped that, through the kind liberality of a religious public, some other place may be provided for the carrying on this ancient and useful School. 
<P>The Meeting-house was a good building, of a moderate size, having <num value="3">three</num> galleries: the <num value="1">first</num> Minister who occupied it was Mr. John Chester, a worthy man of the Presbyterian denomination, who had been ejected from Wethelley, in Leicestershire, by the Act of Uniformity, and had undergone much persecution on account of his principles; he continued to preach here till his death, which took place in <datestruct VALUE="1696-05--"><month reg="05">May</month> <year reg="1696">1696</year></datestruct>. He was succeeded by Mr. Henry Read, who, in <datestruct value="1698--"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>, was followed by Mr. Samuel Palmer, who occupied the place till <datestruct value="1710"><year reg="1710">1710</year></datestruct>, when he conformed to the Established Church, and was succeeded by Dr. Zephaniah Marryat. In <datestruct value="1740--"><year reg="1740">1740</year></datestruct>, the Doctor removed with his congregation to Deadman's Place, and after his departure the building was let to different persons successively, and the profits devoted to the support of the School. 
<P>N. B. Dr. Marryat continued the Minister of the congregation in Deadman's Place till his death, in <datestruct VALUE="1754-09--"><month reg="09">September</month> <year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct>. Mr. Timothy Lamb was chosen in his room, and he continued with them till <datestruct value="1762"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>, when his ill state of health obliged him to resign his charge. He was succeeded by Dr. James Watson; upon whose death, in <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>, Mr. John Humphrys, who was educated in Homerton Academy, was chosen to succeed him; and, a short time after his settlement a new Meeting-house was erected for him in Union Street, to which the congregation removed, and where Mr. Humphrys continued his ministerial engagements till <datestruct value="1818"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>, when he resigned his office, having been chosen Principal of the Protestant Dissenters' Grammar-School, at Mill Hill. 
<P>This place was for some time called Shallet's Meeting-house, though it was generally known in the neighbourhood by the name of John Bunyan's (as it is called on the Plate of the Exterior, given in the <num value="1">first</num> volume). The lease of the ground is dated <datestruct VALUE="1687-01--"><month reg="01">January</month> <year reg="1687">1687</year></datestruct>, and the building must have taken some months to erect it; and as John Bunyan died <datestruct VALUE="1688-05-31"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=31>31st</day>, <year reg=1688>1688</year></datestruct>, he could scarcely have preached in it above once, and that in his last visit to London, just before his death, as he visited London ut once a year; being Pastor of the Church at Bedford at the time he died. <pb id="p.139" n="139">

<P>This antient specimen of ecclesiastical architecture is situate opposite to St. Olave's Church, Tooley Street, Southwark, close adjoining Churchyard Alley, leading to Queen Elizabeth's Free Grammar School; on which site formerly stood a spacious stone building, the city residence of the Priors of Lewes in Sussex, whenever occasion led them to visit London or its vicinity, on parliamentary or ecclesiastical duty. The Priory of Lewes was founded by William de Warren, Earl of Surrey, and his wife Gundreda, in respect to Hugh Sanza, a religious of the Cluniac order of monks, and dedicated to the honour of St. Peter, and named St. Pancras. The Earl founded the Priory for the benefit of the souls of himself and his wife, Queen Matilda, and King William I.; who, after his coming into England, had given him this and other lands, and made him Earl of Surrey. The Earl bestowed many possessions on his foundation of the Priory; particularly in the counties of Sussex, Norfolk, York, Essex, &amp;c.; and probably the inn or residence in Surrey, made part of the grant from his own lands. The necessity of having a mansion or palace near the parliament, appears by an exchange transacted in the year <datestruct value="1197"><year reg="1197">1197</year></datestruct>, between Gilbert Glanville, Bishop of Rochester, and Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury, to whom he resigned Lambeth, reserving only out of the exchange a small piece of land, on which he built a house called Rochester Place, for the reception of the Bishops of Rochester, whenever they came to attend parliament.<NOTE N="*"><P>There had been antiently a palace in Southwark (probably that in Bermondsey), wherein Henry II. resided, and held his <num value="1">first</num> parliament, Christmas, <datestruct value="1154--"><year reg="1154">1154</year></datestruct>, which was afterwards occupied by the De la Poles, Marquisses and Dukes of Suffolk. Margaret de la Pole, it appears by her will, bequeathed her body to be laid in the monastery of St. Saviour, Bermondsey, in the chapel called the Virgin's Chapel.</NOTE> Strype, in his edition of Stowe, vol. ii. p. <num value="23">23</num>, edit. <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, noticing St. Olave's parish church, says, &ldquo;on the south side the street was sometime <num value="1">one</num> great house, builded of stone, with arched gates, which pertained to the Prior of Lewes in Sussex, and was his lodging when he came to London; it is now a common hostery for travellers, and hath to sign the Walnut-tree.&rdquo; In Maitland's time it became converted into a cyder-cellar, and is described as follows: &ldquo;Opposite St. Olave's church antiently stood a spacious stone building, the city mansion of the Prior of Lewes in Sussex; the chapel of which, consisting of <num value="2">two</num> isles, being still remaining at the upper end of Walnut-tree Alley, it is converted into a cyder cellar or warehouse, and by the earth's being greatly raised in this neighbourhood, it is at present under ground: and the Gothick building, a little westward of the same (at present a wine-vault belonging to the King's Head Tavern), under the school-house, a small chapel, I take to have been part of the said mansion house.&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Maitland's London, page</hi>

<P>There are <num value="2">two</num> entrances to this Oratory (or Crypt) in White Horse Court, reading from Tooley Street to Southwark House, formerly the King's Head Tavern, and prior to that the sign of the Walnut-tree. In entering by the northern entrance (marked A in the plan) it is <num value="7">7</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches long by <num value="6">6</num> feet wide, which leads to a large semicircular arched vault, <num value="39">39</num> feet <num value="3">3</num> inches long by <num value="18">18</num> feet wide: on <num value="1">one</num> side is a well, <num value="2">2</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches by <num value="1">1</num> foot, from which water is at present conveyed to the houses above; towards the further end is a door-way, <num value="4">4</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> by <num value="3">3</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches, leading to another semicircular vaulted arch <num value="31">31</num> feet long by <num value="13">13</num> feet <num value="10">10</num> inches wide; from this you are led into a passage <num value="7">7</num> feet by <num value="6">6</num> feet, which leads to the principal apartment of this antient building, the whole length of which is <num value="40">40</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches by <num value="16">16</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches in width: at the further end are <num value="2">two</num> windows, <num value="2">2</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches wide each, and on <num value="1">one</num> side there are likewise <num value="2">two</num> more of the same dimensions, and a passage <num value="4">4</num> feet wide, which leads to another apartment, but is blocked up with stone and bricks. This antient apartment consists of <num value="4">4</num> groined arches, supported on curious columns (see the view) <num value="4">4</num> feet <num value="10">10</num> inches in diameter. From this you enter into another vault of various dimensions, but the length is <num value="27">27</num> feet <num value="4">4</num> inches: part of this vault is arched, as the former, and part groined, over which the stairs leading to Queen Elizabeth's School are erected. On entering the southern entrance (marked B in the plan) you descend by a gradual slope into the <num value="2">second</num> semicircular apartment, already described: the present flooring is of earth and brick rubbish, which have accumulated from time to time, so as to bury the pillars (that appear in the view) to within a short space of the surface, which was lately proved by digging, on a prospect of converting the Crypt into a c&oelig;metery for the use of the parish. The height of the roof is unequal, from the partial rising of the ground, but is in general from <num value="8">8</num> to <num value="9">9</num> feet. The principal apartment terminates at the windows (which appear in the view), now completely blocked up by brickwork towards the churchyard, no vestiges of which outwardly appear. The junction of the <num value="2">two</num> aisles is shown in the view, which has been taken in a way to exhibit the appearance it formerly made, although the raising of the ground has <pb id="p.140" n="140"> brought it to within <num value="3">three</num> feet of the frame-work of the windows. The present occupant is Mr. Hewitson, a painter and glazier, and the Oratory is now to let as store-cellars, or for any other purpose. The principal apartments of Southwark House are now converted into billiard-rooms. 
<P>It is certain that the Earls of Warren and Surrey had very considerable possessions in this parish, and that the living itself was under their cognizance; for in Stow's Survey of London, edit. <datestruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>, p. <num value="754">754</num>, it is thus noticed, from an old record: 
<P>&ldquo;Oluf in Southwarke, diocis Winchester, patron Priour of Lewes in Southsex. The decis.&rdquo; (Tenths.) 
<P>Having thus far established the structure described as part of the mansion of the Priors of Lewes, we will trace out for what purpose the portion under consideration was appropriated. It has been denominated in Manning's History of Surrey a <hi rend=italics>Crypt</hi>, and by others an <hi rend=italics>Oratory.</hi>

<P>To inform ourselves with any degree of certainty with respect to the foundation of structures for Divine service by the Christians of the early ages, would take up more than the prescribed limits of this work will allow: yet to be scanty in furnishing a proper and necessary illustration would be equally exceptionable. 
<P>It is evident that Christianity was <num value="1">first</num> planted and propagated in the world in humility, and growing as it were from a state of infancy; at <num value="1">first</num> the primitive Christians were necessitated to assemble themselves, not in the most convenient, but the safest places, to avoid the malice of the Jews, and the persecutions of the Gentiles, and to congregate themselves, for more safety, in subterraneous caves and vaults, the remains of which are still to be traced in the Catacombs at Rome, which were places of large extent under ground, wherein the primitive Christians used to assemble, not only to pray and preach, to receive the sacraments, but to bury the bodies of their martyrs and confessors, and also oftentimes to hold their councils. Yet these were, from mere circumstances, of the utmost necessity; for the Christian converts, both Jews and Gentiles, though they rejected idolatrous and superstitious pomp, deposited their departed friends in places distant from towns in c&oelig;meteries (<foreign lang=Greek>*koimhth/ria</foreign>); because the laws were still in force against burying in towns, and because they were under persecution, both by Jews and Pagans. 
<P>Thus, when, by reason of the meanness of their places of worship, the Christians of those times were upbraided by their adversaries, &ldquo;for their poor and indecent services to such a great God,&rdquo; they with cheerful ingenuousness replied, &ldquo;That indeed they wanted such sumptuous temples as those which the heathens made their boast; but that they also could glory in temples more suitable and magnificent than any of those of which their adversaries might vaunt. The Universe was their Temple, framed and built by God himself, for his own honour and glory; and where he is present in all corners of it, to hear and receive the addresses of his servants.&rdquo; 
<P>But though this might be a leading principle among the <num value="1">first</num> Christians, they did not think it necessary strictly to adhere to it: and that because the universe and a Christian's soul might be said to be God's temple, it were needless to have any other. Therefore, at the dawn of liberty of conscience, they countenanced, and then gave their assistance in building and dedicating churches and oratories; but with great caution and difficulty in those hazardous times, because, as Eusebius, in his Ecclesiastical History, informs us, &ldquo;the persecuting heathens often found out and pulled down their humble oratories.&rdquo; So that the <num value="1">first</num> places of Christian religious worship were only some convenient apartments within the dwellings of pious disciples, dedicated by the bounty of the owners to the service of the church; these chambers were called C&oelig;naculi, as being most quiet and safe. 
<P>But the more immediate object of our present information is an account of CRYPTS. 
<P>The word Crypt is derived from the Greek <foreign lang=Greek>*kru/pta</foreign>, a hollow place under ground, whence is derived the German word <hi rend=italics>Kroft</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Croft</hi>, a corruption of Crypta. Hence it is that among ecclesiastical writers the word Crypta is to be met with, to signify a church under ground; and our cathedrals, in imitation, or as a memorial, have them yet under their choirs; whence the term <hi rend=italics>under-croft:</hi> of this kind was the church of St. Faith, formerly under the cathedral of St. Paul, London. But as Crypts were appropriated to several purposes, we shall endeavour to illustrate the various intentions of the devotees in their construction of these prim&aelig;val edifices. 
<P>When the Christians became numerous, they had separate places from the Gentiles, not only for places of devotion, but also for depositories of their dead. To avoid as much as possible the insults of their enemies, they contrived vast subterraneous vaults, with various winding paths: in the sides of these vaults were niches, in which the coffins of the deceased were placed. St. Jerome has given a geographical description of them: &ldquo;When I was a boy at Rome,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I, with some of my fellow-students, would visit the sepulchres of the Apostles and Martyrs, which were deep in the earth; all about was very dark, as if the prophecy of the Psalmist had been literally fulfilled, &lsquo;Let them go down quick into hell:&rsquo; only a little light being admitted through a hole above, to temper the horror of the darkness.&rdquo; 
<P>It appears that the Emperor Constantine the Great was the <num value="1">first</num> who was buried near a church; and though it could not be permitted for him to be buried <hi rend=italics>in</hi> the church, as a thing unheard of; yet he was resolved to lie as near the church as possible, and therefore was buried in the great church which he had erected in Constantinople. And St Chrysostom, with vast prelatical pride, insults the memory of the Emperor when he says that &ldquo;it was a great honour done to Constantine, that he was permitted to be buried at the door of the temple, and to be porter to the fishermen. 
<p><figure id="fig.1.140.1" n="2000.65.0086"><head>A Ground Plan, Elevation, &amp; Specimens of the Capitals, Columns, &amp;c. of the Crypt under the Inn in Tooley Street belonging to the Priors of Lewes in Sessex.</head></figure>
<pb id="p.141" n="141"> For that the Apostles in their deaths were more honourable than all the princes of the earth, because even at Rome, the royal city, emperors, consuls, and generals shewed their respect, and paid their veneration at the sepulchres of fishermen and tent-makers; and at Constantinople it was thought honour sufficient for an Emperor to be buried, not in the place where the apostles lay, but in the porch of the temples built to their names and honour.&rdquo; 
<P>The clergy ventured <num value="1">one</num> step further, and would lie within the walls of that church, when dead, in which they had officiated when living. The bishops, priests, and monks pretended a right to the churches superior to that of princes, chose the principal places for themselves, and excluded all others from being buried there: they kept the power of dispensing such favour in their own hands, and soon made their claim a law; for the canon law says, that &ldquo;only bishops, abbots, and presbyters should be buried in the churches, and such laymen as they should approve of.&rdquo; 
<P>Thus was the most solemn of all rites made subservient to the dictates of pride and ambition. But another and an equally mischievous cause of burying in churches arose from superstition and error; and though our respect for the memory of Pope Gregory the Great is indeed very high, yet we cannot but feel aversion to his conduct, when, in the year <datestruct value="590"><year reg="590">590</year></datestruct>, he brought into the churches, and set up in the most solemn manner, relics enshrined in gold, sometimes upon, over, but generally under the altar, which made the survivors flock to bury their dead there in hopes that both might receive benefit from their emanation. 
<P>Lucre now came in for a share of the profits of the rights of sepulture; &ldquo;for which purpose the bishops carried on the imposture to the utmost degree, and promoted the superstition for the sake of their private gain. The Spanish bishops, in particular, in their processions, caused the relics of saints to be hung about their own necks, and being thus adorned, were carried in chairs by their deacons to be shown to the people; and, after the manner of mountebanks, they exposed the relics for the cure of all diseases, both of body and mind; and by such impious means made great profit, for a touch or a kiss of these pieces of corruption could not be obtained by the common people without a valuable consideration. This practice, however, was forbidden, as scandalous, by a council held in the year <datestruct value="675"><year reg="675">675</year></datestruct>.&rdquo; 
<P>But instead of the Christian religion benefiting and enlightening mankind, as was its primary intention, the minds of the selfish, aided by power, induced the most absurd and shameful practices; for the <num value="2">second</num> Council of Nice decreed, &ldquo;that such churches as had been consecrated without relics, should have relics deposited there, with solemnity of public prayer.&rdquo; They did not stop here; for that Council further decreed, &ldquo;that no churches for the future should be consecrated without relics, and that bishops presuming to consecrate differently <hi rend=italics>should be deposed!</hi>&rdquo; Such a profane doctrine, in process of time, introduced innumerable superstitious follies into the church, and opened the way for infinite frauds and impostures, such as the blessed saints themselves, had they been on the earth, must have held in the utmost detestation and abhorrence. 
<P>During the reign of Charlemagne, the monks, in <num value="771">771</num>, to acquire wealth, ran up and down with the bones and other relics of the saints; and, under the pretence of this kind of zeal, used every indirect mode to enrich themselves, insomuch that the Emperor took such umbrage at their conduct, that he forbade their iniquitous proceedings to obtain their object, which was, to get the burial of the dead within their cloisters, that they might benefit by the oblations. This gave rise in the middle ages, both in England and other parts of Europe, to mortuaries, oblations, gifts, <hi rend=italics>symbola anim&oelig;</hi>, and 
<hi rend=italics>pecunia sepulchralis</hi>, all which at <num value="1">first</num> were voluntary, but afterwards enforced; for, by a decree of Simon Mepham, Archbishop of Canterbury, in the year <datestruct value="1328"><year reg="1328">1328</year></datestruct>, and in the <num value="3">third</num> year of the reign of Edward III., it was declared, &ldquo;that they who endeavour to reduce oblations to a certain small sum, are denounced excommunicate by the greater excommunication, till they make satisfaction!&rdquo; And what heavy burdens the clergy in England exacted for oblations, mortuaries, &amp;c., even to the impoverishing of their votaries, is amply detailed in most of our ecclesiastical histories. 
<P>Burial in churches in England did not take place till Cuthred, King of the West Saxons, introduced that mode in the <num value="7">seventh</num> century, previously to which inhumation was performed in the open fields. 
<P>The privilege of having churchyards for interment, was <num value="1">first</num> procured from the Pope, by Cuthbert, the <num value="10">tenth</num> Archbishop of Canterbury from St. Austin, in the year <datestruct value="798"><year reg="798">798</year></datestruct>. And Dr. Inett acknowledges, &ldquo;that the antient custom of the English church was changed; and the burial in churches introduced in the latter end of the <num value="8">eighth</num> century, about the year <datestruct value="794"><year reg="794">794</year></datestruct>.&rdquo; Even so late as the year <datestruct value="1076"><year reg="1076">1076</year></datestruct>, in the reign of William the Conqueror, the Council held at Winchester, under Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, &ldquo;forbade the burial in churches by the <num value="9">ninth</num> canon.&rdquo; 
<P>But when corruption of principle, superstitious extravagance, and the vilest fraud, tyrannized over the minds of the weak and unwary, under the mask of purity of manners, and an innocent susceptibility to deception, the grossest iniquity prevailed, the most scandalous profanation ensued, the poor devotees were instructed to believe the most palpable inconsistencies, and the doubting such inconsistencies and absurd dogmas, maintained by arbitrary dictators, was rendered liable to the severest persecution; and religion did not resume its due influence till the fires in Smithfield, and in other places of England, so far purified the reason of the inhabitants of this country, that the results have been in the highest degree beneficial. 
<P>No places for Divine worship in London, or throughout England, during the period of this lamentable superstition were without their Cemeteries, Crypts, Sepulchral Lamps, and other dregs of profanation; so that what was originally <pb id="p.142" n="142"> considered idolatrous, came, through the corruption of future times, to be considered as the only mediums to obtain eternal happiness! Farmer, in his History of Waltham Abbey, recounts no less than a hogshead of nails in England, all most solemnly affirmed to be the true nails which fastened the Redeemer to the cross! 
<P>Another use to which these Crypts were appropriated, was that of <hi rend=italics>Oratories</hi> or <hi rend=italics>Private Chapels.</hi>

<P>According to the civil and canon law, no man could build a church or oratory without the leave of the bishop, not before he consecrated the place by prayer, by setting up the cross, and making processions, and also, that before the constructor built it, the necessary maintenance should be allotted for it, and for those who performed Divine offices. No sanctuary was allowed to the place till the bishop had <num value="1">first</num> hallowed it, nor that it should be hallowed, within <num value="2">two</num> years, by the bishop. 
<P>Thus, according to Burn's Ecclesiastical Law, &ldquo;private chapels were such as noblemen and other religious and worthy persons had, at their own private charge, built in or near their own houses, for them and their families to perform religious duties in it. These private chapels and their ornaments were maintained at the charge of those persons to whom they belonged, and chaplains provided for them by themselves with honourable pensions: and these antiently were all consecrated by the bishop of the diocese, and ought to be so still.&rdquo; Degge, p. i. c. <num value="12">12</num>. 
<P>According to the decrees of Archbishop Stratford, chapels are thus noticed: &ldquo;We do decree that whosoever against the prohibition of the canons shall celebrate mass in oratories, chapels, houses, or other places not consecrated, without having obtained the license of the diocesan, shall be suspended from the celebration of Divine service for the space of a month; and all licenses granted by the bishops, for celebrating mass in places not consecrated, other than to noblemen or other great men of the realm, living at a considerable distance from the church, or notoriously weak or infirm, shall be void. Nevertheless, the heads, governors, and canons of cathedral churches, and others of the clergy, may celebrate mass in their oratories of antient erection, as hath been accustomed. Moreover, the priests who shall celebrate mass in oratories or chapels built by the Kings or Queens of England, or their children, shall not incur such pain.&rdquo; Lind. <num value="233">233</num>. 
<P>&ldquo;An oratory differs from a church; for in a church there is appointed a certain endowment for the minister and others; but an oratory is that which is not built for saying mass, nor endowed, but obtained for saying prayer.&rdquo; Lind. <num value="233">233</num>. 
<P>&ldquo;Without having obtained the license of the diocesan for such oratory, any <num value="1">one</num> might build without the consent of the bishop; but without the license of the bishop, Divine service might not be performed there, and this license he should not grant for Divine service there to be performed upon the greater festivals.&rdquo; Lind. <num value="233">233</num>. 
<P>&ldquo;Abundance of such licenses, both before and since the Reformation, remain in our ecclesiastical records, not only for prayers and sermons, but, in some instances, for sacraments also. But the law is (as Lindwood hath it in his Gloss on the said canon), that such license be granted sparingly. And these restrictions were laid on private oratories, out of a just regard to places of public worship; that while the laws of the church provided for great infirmities, or great distance, such indulgence might not be abused to an unnecessary neglect of public or parochial communion.&rdquo; Gibs. <num value="212">212</num>. &ldquo;And in the said oratories, a bell might not be put up without the bishop's authority.&rdquo; Lind. <num value="233">233</num>. 
<P>A certain portion of antient churches was called the <hi rend=italics>parvis</hi>, which was the nether part set apart for the purpose of instructing children, and thence called the parvis, <hi rend=italics>&agrave; parvis pueris ibi edoctis</hi>, from the young boys who were there instructed; which illustrates the following passage in Matthew Paris: 
<P>&ldquo;In the reign of Henry III. the Pope's collector met a poor priest with a vessel of holy water and a sprinkler, and with a loaf of bread, that he had gotten for some of his holy water, for he used to go abroad and bestow his holy water, and receive from the people what they gave him, as the reputed value thereof. The Pope's collector asked him, what he might get in <num value="1">one</num> year that way? The priest answered, &lsquo;About <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure>;&rsquo; to which the collector presently replied, &lsquo;Then there belongs, as due out of it, as the tenths, <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> to my receipt yearly,&rsquo; and obliged him to pay it accordingly. Upon which,&rdquo; continues the passage, &ldquo;the poor priest, to enable him to pay the imposition, and to get a sort of livelihood, was constrained to take up the trade of selling little books at the Parvise.&rdquo; 
<P>Having thus endeavoured to ascertain the uses to which the structure we have described might be put, it only remains to add, that, agreeably to the mode of its architecture, it seems to have been built about the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century, and probably by <num value="1">one</num> of the Earls of Warren and Surrey, as part of a benefaction to the Priory of Lewes; and its dimensions, as above, were thus taken from an exact measurement. <pb id="p.143" n="143">

<P>The very scarce print, of which this plate is an <hi rend=italics>exact</hi> copy, was etched by Sylvester about the year <datestruct value="1638"><year reg="1638">1638</year></datestruct>; and forms <num value="1">one</num> of a series of views, chiefly of places abroad, published by the same artist, about that period.<NOTE N="*"><P>The Publisher of the present work bid, at a late sale, as high as <hi rend=italics><num value="3">three</num> guineas and a half</hi> for this print.

<P>The principal objects represented are, the Banquetting House, the Gate in King Street, and part of the Treasury. Adjoining the gate is a range of building extending from the latter to the wall of the Privy Garden, and which, as well as the gate itself, has been many years removed to make way for modern improvements. 
<P>The site of the Horse Guards, at the time the above view was taken, was occupied by a long stone wall, which formed the boundary of a small garden appertaining to the Palace. 
<P>The Banquetting House, built by Inigo Jones, and universally admired for its classical elegance, and a mutilated fragment of the Treasury, still exist.

<P>The accompanying print is engraved from a very accurate and interesting drawing of this Palace, made with a pen and ink, apparently about the time of James II. It is <num value="1">one</num> of a series taken by some curious person at that period, and was purchased, with others, from the relatives of a deceased artist, in whose collection it had been many years. It is now in the possession of Thomas Griffith, Esq. of Pall-mall. The print has been carefully reduced from the drawing, which is in outline only, and is <num value="8">eight</num> times its size. 
<P>This view, which is <hi rend=italics>bird's-eye</hi>, represents a number of objects mentioned by various writers, and not elsewhere to be met with. Amongst the principal we may notice the Privy Garden, tastefully disposed with its walks and fountains; the old Horse Guards; the celebrated Gaming House in Spring Gardens; Wallingford House, now converted into the Admiralty; St. James's Park, Rosomond's Pond: and, in the extreme distance, Arlington House, on the site of which the present Buckingham House stands. 
<P>The statue of James II. does not appear to have been then set up behind the Banquetting House, as we observe its place supplied by a sort of vase fixed on a pedestal. If this circumstance be correct, the drawing here copied must have been made some time previous to the abdication of that monarch. <pb id="p.145" n="145">

<P>The annexed print of Whitehall is taken from the same point of view, and probably about the same period of time, as that executed by Sylvestre; to which it bears some resemblance. On comparing the <num value="2">two</num> plates, however, a considerable difference may be observed; the <num value="1">one</num> we are describing, not only representing the several objects with much greater accuracy, but also shewing some minuti&aelig; which are not given in the print by Sylvestre; particularly the fragments of some ancient turretted buildings, remaining over the gateway adjoining the north end of the Banquetting House, as well as the gateway itself, which, from its high pointed arch, was evidently of an early date, and, with the former, undoubtedly constituted parts of the original palace which stood on this site. 
<P>The beautiful gateway at Whitehall is shewn in a state of perfection, and the Banquetting House as then newly rebuilt. The latter was at that time, and had been in the preceding reigns, the great scene of courtly splendour. Many of the superb masques got up under the direction of Inigo Jones, were here represented with the most costly magnificence for the amusement of the sovereigns James I. and Charles I. In the reign of Elizabeth it had been equally appropriated to purposes of festivity. A specimen of the mode of doing this, is given in a MS. at the British Museum (Har. MSS. No. <num value="293">293</num>, Fo. <num value="110">110</num>), entitled, &ldquo;The Manere and Charge at the Makynge of the greate Banketynge House at Whitehall, at the Entertaynement of Mounsere, by Queene Elizabethe, <datestruct value="1581--"><year reg="1581">1581</year></datestruct>.&rdquo;&mdash;The Tilt Yard, immediately opposite, was equally at this period the scene of royal pageantry.

<P>St. James's Palace was erected by King Henry VIII. on the site of an ancient hospital or convent, dedicated to the Saint of that name, and which had been founded long prior to the Conquest. The appearance it early exhibited, is fortunately preserved by the drawing from which the present print is taken, which is undoubtedly by the hand of Hollar, and has been kindly lent for the use of this work, by its present possessor, John Towneley, of Towneley, Esq. a Family Trustee to the British Museum, F. R. and A.S.S. 
<P>This view differs in several respects from that some years since published in the Antiquarian Repertory, to which however it bears a considerable resemblance. The representation of the Palace is given with all that minutia of detail which characterizes the works of Hollar. The buildings in the distance are likewise more correctly made out. 
<P>The several particulars in the history of this pile, which are given in the inscription beneath the plate, preclude the necessity of a further description in this place. Much of the ancient part of the Palace still remains, but a greater part was destroyed by the calamitous fire which consumed or damaged many of the finest apartments, on the <datestruct VALUE="1809-01-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>.

<P>The history of this interesting structure has been involved in uncertainty, and has a claim to much higher antiquity than has been attributed to it. 
<P>To gain a more perfect account of the manor, we must refer to that of the manor of Kennington, of which Fawkeshall was a member. 
<P>Kennington appears to have been a royal palace before the Norman Conquest; Hardicanute is said to have deceased here in <datestruct value="1041--"><year reg="1041">1041</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Harold II. is said to have placed on his own head, at Kennington, that crown, of which, with his life, he was afterwards deprived by William the Norman. 
<P>At Kennington Henry III. assembled <num value="1">one</num> of his parliaments; at the same place Edward III. kept his Christmas in <datestruct value="1342--"><year reg="1342">1342</year></datestruct>; and after having annexed it as a member of the duchy of Cornwall, bestowed it on his son Edward, the Black Prince. 
<P>It continued a royal residence for several generations, till the royal domains were wrested from the right owner in the reign of Charles I.; it is described, in the parliamentary survey taken in <datestruct value="1656--"><year reg="1656">1656</year></datestruct>, after the decease of that monarch, as &ldquo;a small and an old low timber building, situate on part of the foundation of the ancient mansion-house of the Black Prince and other Dukes of Cornwall after him, which was long since utterly ruined, and nothing thereof remaining but the stable, <num value="180">one hundred and eighty</num> feet long, built of flint and stone, and now used as a barn.&rdquo; 
<P>When the legal authority of the country resumed its due power, this manor reverted to the rightful possessors, and Kennington still belongs to the Prince of Wales, as part of his duchy of Cornwall. Kennington also gave the title of Earl to His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland, uncle to His Majesty George III. 
<P>Foukeshall, Fawkeshall, or Vauxhall, appears to have nearly as antient date as its neighbour Kennington; in a record in the reign of Edward I. it is declared to contain <num value="29">twenty-nine</num> acres of meadow land, valued at <measure value="3s." type=currency><num value="3">three</num> shillings</measure> per acre; and <num value="80">eighty</num> acres of arable land, at <measure value="4d." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> pence</measure> per acre. 
<P>We are at a loss respecting the name of this manor before it was held by Margaret De Ripariis or De Rivers, in dower from Baldwin De Insula, her late husband, of the inheritance of Isabella De Fortibus, Countess of Albemarle, sister and co-heir of Baldwin, Archbishop of Canterbury. It is evident, however, that, upon the marriage of that lady with Foukes de Brent, this was part of her jointure as well as the adjoining manor of South Lambeth which she held; and from the circumstance of this marriage Foukeshall undoubtedly received its denomination. 
<P>Roger D&lsquo;Amorie was the next possessor, by a grant from Edward II.; but this Roger having joined the disaffected Barons against their Sovereign, the King bestowed Foukeshall on his favorite Hugh Le Despenser. 
<P>After the execution of the latter in <datestruct value="1326--"><year reg="1326">1326</year></datestruct>, the widow of D&lsquo;Amorie regained the manor, which she exchanged with Edward III. for lands in the county of Suffolk. Edward bestowed Foukeshall on his son Edward the Black Prince, who made a donation of the manor to the church and monastery of Canterbury. 
<P>Fawkeshall continued in the above fraternity till their dissolution by Henry VIII. who transferred this estate to the dean and chapter, 
<P>Such is the history of what was properly named Foukeshall, or Fawkeshall, which had fallen to decay at a very early period: but the Fawkeshall of which we have given a view, was a large old mansion near the Thames, belonging to Sir Thomas Parry, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in the reign of James I. held of the manor of Kennington, and at that period denominated <hi rend=italics>Copped Hall.</hi>

<P>The unfortunate Lady Arabella Stuart suffered part of her imprisonment for the space of <num value="12">twelve</num> years in this mansion, under the custody of Sir Thomas Parry. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1615--"><year reg="1615">1615</year></datestruct>, Copped or Copt Hall being situated opposite to the site of the antient Fawkeshall, adopted the name of that structure, and was recognised in the survey taken by order of Parliament in the reign of Charles I. as &ldquo;a capital messuage called Vauxhall, alias Copped-Hall, bounded by the Thames, being a fair dwelling-house, strongly built, of <num value="3">three</num> stories high, and a fair staircase breaking out from it <num value="19">nineteen</num> feet square.&rdquo; The staircase is exhibited in the print. 
<P>The notion that this was the mansion of, and took its name from, Guido (vulgarly Guy) Faux, <num value="1">one</num> of the traitors in the Gunpowder Plot, has not the smallest foundation. That infernal treason was contrived, and the meetings of the traitors held, at the house of a person named John Wright, at Lambeth, where also the gunpowder was concealed till conveyed across the Thames to the Horse Ferry, Westminster. 
<P>The mansion in the year <datestruct value="1629"><year reg="1629">1629</year></datestruct> having been surrendered to the crown by John Abrahall, the tenant and heir of Sir Thomas Parry, dropped its name of Copped Hall, and was afterwards identified as Vauxhall only. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1652--"><year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct> the Parliament determined that it should be sold; the purchaser was John Trenchard, of the city of Westminster, who held it till the restoration of King Charles II. <pb id="p.150" n="150"> 
<P>That monarch leased it to Henry, Lord Moore, afterwards Earl of Drogheda, for <num value="31">thirty-one</num> years; but the lease contained a proviso, that if the King &ldquo;should think fit to appropriate any part of it to his own use, it should be surrendered, upon proper allowance.&rdquo; 
<P>In the course of the year, advantage was made of the proviso, and the mansion was occupied by Jasper Calthoff, a Dutchman, who had been appointed to furnish warlike stores for the public service. It was soon after leased to Peter Jacobson, a sugar-baker. 
<P>During the year <datestruct value="1675"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, Sir Samuel Morland obtained a lease of the premises, and made considerable improvements. Every apartment, however, exhibited proofs of his eccentric ingenuity: &ldquo;the side-table in the dining-room was supplied with a large fountain, and the glasses stood under little streams of water. His coach had a moveable kitchen, with clock-work machinery, with which he could make soup, broil steaks, or roast a joint of meat; so that when he travelled, he was his own cook.&rdquo; 
<P>We are not informed how the manor was afterwards disposed of, till <datestruct value="1725"><year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct>, when it was granted to a distiller named Kent. It was then held under <num value="2">two</num> leases, the manor-house having been long demolished: <num value="1">one</num> of the leases was demised under the title of &ldquo;The Manor;&rdquo; the other of &ldquo;Vauxhall Wharf,&rdquo; which comprised the whole of the ground occupied by Marble Hall and the Cumberland Tea-gardens: the leases were both held by Mr. Pratt, who carried on the distillery. Sir Joseph Mawbey, Bart. having married the daughter of Mr. Pratt, held the premises, and carried on the distillery till his decease in the year <datestruct value="1798"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>. The estate is now held by Sir Charles Blicke, Knt. and other under tenants. 
<P>The place of fashionable resort called Vauxhall, or Spring Gardens, was the property of Jane, widow of John Vaux, in <datestruct value="1615--"><year reg="1615">1615</year></datestruct>; the mansion being at that time denominated Stockdens. Mrs. Vaux left <num value="2">two</num> daughters, <num value="1">one</num> of whom married Dr. Barlow, Bishop of Lincoln from <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1691--"><year reg="1691">1691</year></datestruct>; this estate having been divided in moieties between the <num value="2">two</num> sisters, passed to several possessors. 
<P>During the reign of Queen Anne this appears to have been a place of great celebrity: for Addison, in the Spectator, N<hi rend=sup>o</hi> <num value="383">383</num>, <datestruct VALUE="1712-05-20"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=20>20</day>, <year reg=1712>1712</year></datestruct>, introduces his favourite character, Sir Roger De Coverley, as accompanying him in a voyage from the Temple Stairs to Vauxhall. 
<P>The premises were leased in the year <datestruct value="1730"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct> to Jonathan Tyers, Esq. who opened the Gardens, with a Ridotto al Fresco. Mr. Tyers was so successful in his speculation, that he purchased a moiety of the estates from George Doddington, Esq. in <datestruct value="1752--"><year reg="1752">1752</year></datestruct>, for the sum of <measure value="3800l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="3800">3800</num></measure>; and the remainder a few years afterwards. 
<P>Towards the decorations of the Gardens, Mr. Tyers was at great expense in procuring paintings by the most eminent artists of that period, particularly by Hogarth, Hayman, and other masters. A stately orchestra was erected, and a capital band of musicians engaged. He also placed there the beautiful statue of Handel by Roubiliac. 
<P>Vauxhall Gardens have since passed to several proprietors, they have lately been adapted for entertainments suitable to the higher classes of fashion, and several branches of the Royal Family have annually honoured the gardens with their presence. <pb id="p.151" n="151">

<P>The accompanying view is all that remains as a vestige of the once respectable, if not magnificent Manor House, appertaining to the Lordship of Totenhall, situated at the north-west extremity of Tottenham Court Road<NOTE N="*"><P>The Prebendary of Totenhall, or Totanell (which now goes by the name of Tottenham, or Totnam Court), is in the diocese of London, and hath the <num value="4">fourth</num> stall on the left side of the choir in the cathedral church of St. Paul: and the corps of his prebend lies in the parish of St. Pancras, in the county of Middlesex. <num value="1">One</num> of the earliest Prebendaries was Ranulph Flambard, who was at <num value="1">first</num> Chaplain to 
<hi rend=italics>Maurice</hi>, Bishop of London, whom he left in disgust, for not letting him have the deanry when void, and wound himself into the court and into great favour with the King William (Rufus), and became a fit instrument for his corrupt practices, and for his own. This King made him chief governor under him of all his realm, which he sufficiently abused, and thereby became odious, both to the commonalty and nobility, and was very likely to have been trepanned out of his life, but was strangely delivered out of the danger, and was soon after made Bishop of Durham; the King nominating him to that see, on the Feast of Pentecost, <datestruct value="1099--"><year reg="1099">1099</year></datestruct>, to which he was consecrated in the church of St. Paul, on Trinity Sunday, <datestruct VALUE="-06-5"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=5>5</day></datestruct>, following: but that King being accidentally killed by an arrow in New Forest, in Hampshire; in about a year and <num value="2">two</num> months after, his successor, King Henry I. clapt up the said Bishop prisoner in the Tower of London, out of which, not long after, making his escape, he fled into Normandy, incited Duke Robert to attempt England, which he did with the Bishop in his company: but King Henry with his money prevailing with his brother, he returned again into Normandy, with condition that Ranulph should be restored to his bishoprick, which was accordingly done; and he peaceably enjoyed it till his death, which happened on the <num value="4">4th</num> or <datestruct VALUE="1118-09-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1118">1118</year></datestruct>, after he had sate <num value="29">twenty-nine</num> years, <num value="3">three</num> months, and odd days; and had raised the walls of his church to the roof, translated the reliques of St. Cuthbert into his new cathedral of Durham, and bestowed a shrine on him&mdash;compassed the city with a wall&mdash;continued divers banks along the river Were&mdash;built the Castle of Norham, the Hospital of Kepar, and the Bridge of Framoldgate&mdash;founded the Priory of Motsford, near Winchester, and re-edified and much increased the state of the collegiate church of Christchurch, in Hampshire, of which he had formerly been Dean.</NOTE>. The building represented, formed but little part of the mansion of its once opulent occupant, and appears to have been a part only of the lodgings or offices appropriated to the use of domestics. It is at present converted into a drinking parlour, and is detached from the dwelling of the Adam and Eve public-house and wine-vaults, built on the site of the old Manor House. The Adam and Eve has long been celebrated as a tea-house and gardens, on a similar plan with those of White Conduit House and Bagnigge Wells. The grounds were spacious and convenient, part of which were converted to the games of skittles, Dutch-pins, bumble-puppy, &amp;c., &amp;c. In the long room was an excellent organ, and it was generally well attended, and the company respectable, until within the last <num value="20">twenty</num> years; but in consequence of the accumulation of buildings in the neighbourhood, it became a place of more promiscuous resort, and persons of the worst character and description were in the constant habit of frequenting it; highwaymen, footpads, pickpockets, and common women, formed its leading visitants, and it became so great a nuisance to the neighbourhood, that the magistrates interfered, the organ was banished, the skittle-grounds destroyed, and the gardens dug up for the foundation of Eden Street, which is built on their site. Hogarth has made the Adam and Eve the place of rendezvous for the March of the Guards to Finchley; and upon the sign-board of the house is inserted, Tottenham Court NURSERY, allusive to the place where the famous Broughton's Amphitheatre for Boxing was erected, which has since been taken down, having been rendered useless by the justices not permitting such kind of diversions. The person who kept the Adam and Eve last, a Mr. Greatorex, made the alteration fronting the road, and was considered a man of considerable property, but speculating deeply in money affairs and building, he became so much embarrassed as to be compelled to quit the kingdom; and is at present in business at Paris, as an innkeeper. The Adam and Eve has completely retrieved its character, and for respectability yields to no licensed house in its neighbourhood. 
<P>Until within a few years, the Manor House, and that known by the name of King John's Palace, were the only buildings within the distance of nearly a mile, and both completely surrounded by fields. The Adam and Eve is at present incased within houses, and the whole of Brook and Eden Streets have sprung up within the last <num value="20">twenty</num> years; the latter being only a part of the once extensive ground and gardens appertaining to the Adam and Eve. 
<P>The Plan exhibits the very extensive improvements that have taken place on the site and immediate vicinity of King John's Old Palace: George Street, directly fronting the north of Gower Street, of which it is intended to form a continuation, is at present nearly completed, and ends in the Hampstead Road; while Tottenham Court, now entirely finished, forms a junction with Southampton Terrace, and continues the New Road, with little break or interruption, to the railing of Euston Square, connecting the line of the New Road, from Paddington, through Somers Town, Battle Bridge, Pentonville, &amp;c., as <num value="1">one</num> continual street to Finsbury Square, surpassing in extent and beauty, every other within, or surrounding the metropolis of the British empire. <pb id="p.153" n="153">

<P>King John and Oliver Cromwell, if tradition tell true, had more houses and palaces between them, than the whole race of English Monarchs beside; scarce a village within <num value="20">twenty</num> miles of London, but hath a traditionary legend of King John's residence amongst them; and scarcely a neighbourhood from Hyde Park to Whitechapel, but claims the like connection with Oliver Cromwell. The troublesome life John led with his turbulent Barons, made him frequently change his habitations; but it is by no means likely he would condescend to make a palace of some hovels that have been attributed to his name. Oliver Cromwell had many places of residence; and it is a fact well established, it was never known among his most confidential friends where he intended to sleep, nor did his attendants and servants know, <num value="1">one</num> hour before another, his mind on that head: the frequent attempts on his life, rendered caution highly necessary; and no man knew better that essential requisite than himself: though not of a timid disposition, he had a prudent fear, and guarded against every probable danger. The house in Tottenham Court, denominated King John's Palace, was certainly of great antiquity, and had undergone many repairs and patchings up, previous to its demolition in <datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>. The portion, of which the view is taken, made but a small part of the building, there being in front, at about <num value="20">twenty</num> yards' distance, a house of thrice its dimensions, and of as ancient a foundation, evidently connected with this, and making part thereof: from the circumstance of a wall of great antiquity completely joining both, the communication from the road-side dwelling was through a side passage, under an arch similar to that in the print, and resembled in the connection, the quadrangles of some of the colleges in our Universities. The interior appeared to have undergone no alteration subsequent to the reign of Elizabeth or James I.; and the oaken panels were neatly executed, and not more than <num value="12">twelve</num> inches by <num value="8">eight</num> in size: there was a very curiously carved mantelpiece of oak, much resembling that at the Pyed Bull Inn, at Islington, formerly the residence of the illustrious Sir Walter Raleigh; and several fragments of antique ornaments indicated it to have been formerly a place of some consequence; the apartments were more spacious than the appearance in the view would lead a spectator to imagine; particularly in the back part, where the rooms nearly doubled the front ones in dimensions. At the extremity of the building, through the Gothic arch (see the view), was a door, very rarely opened, that led by a gradual descent to a subterraneous passage, traditionally said to lead to the church of St. Pancras, with which, in former times, this building had a communication, though nearly at the distance of <num value="1">one</num> mile apart. This subterraneous passage was the theme and conversation of the neighbours for years prior to the demolition of the premises; and several persons were led by curiosity to explore the passage, but few had courage to venture a distance of more than <num value="20">twenty</num> yards, before they returned back, resigning the task to others, who might possess more temerity. A man named Price, a smith, now living in the neighbourhood, was at length resolved to discover the termination of the passage, if possible, and provided himself with a quantity of blazing links to subdue the damps of the earth, as well as guide him in his way; he returned, however, unsuccessful; but with the best account that had hitherto been given of the obstructions that lay in the way; viz., that, as far as he was able to judge, he might proceed to the extent of from <num value="30">thirty</num> to <num value="40">forty</num> yards, with some difficulty, from the falling in of the earth in various places; but what entirely stopped his further pursuit, was a pool of water he arrived at, which he did not think it prudent to pass, as he found the damp of the earth had a visible effect on his flaming conductors, and he returned back to daylight without achieving the wished--for discovery. 
<P>The vignette (in the view of King John's Palace) represents the appearance of the small houses and shops that enclose the present grounds of the Adam and Eve, the proprietors of which must be greatly benefited from the produce of rent, arising from the <num value="6">six</num> small shops, made out of the boxes in the old Tea Gardens, each of which generally let for, from <num value="25">twenty-five</num> to <measure value="30l." type=currency><num value="30">thirty</num> pounds</measure> per annum.

<p><figure id="fig.1.154.1" n="2000.65.0095"><head>Clarendon House; called also Albemarle House.</head></figure>
<P>This superb and magnificent building was erected by <hi rend=italics>Edward Hyde</hi>, Earl of <hi rend=italics>Clarendon</hi>, Lord High Chancellor of England, shortly after the restoration of King <hi rend=italics>Charles</hi> II. The circumstance of his Lordship's purchasing, and applying to this purpose, the stones that were intended for the repair of the old cathedral church of <hi rend=italics>St. Paul</hi>, London, and expending <num value="50000">50,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> in the building, which employed <num value="300">three hundred</num> men, brought an odium on his character, aggravated by his enemies, who denominated this expensive fabric, <hi rend=italics>Dunkirk House. Charles</hi> II. having recently sold <hi rend=italics>Dunkirk</hi> to the French, the public conceived the measure to originate with the <hi rend=italics>Chancellor</hi>, and challenged him with appropriating part of the money towards the expense of his great undertaking of this noble dwelling, though it afterwards sufficiently appeared, he had so greatly embarrassed his circumstances, as to be under the necessity of selling the same to <hi rend=italics>George Monk</hi>, Duke of Albemarle, from whom it derived its <num value="2">second</num> denomination of <hi rend=italics>Albemarle House.</hi> The great cause of jealousy and envy among the nobility, towards Lord Clarendon, arose from the circumstance of his eldest daughter, Anne Hyde, being lately married to the Duke of York, the presumptive heir to the Crown; and there were many who asserted this was not only affected through the contrivance of the Chancellor, but that he was the sole person who planned and carried into effect the marriage of the King with the Infanta of Portugal; from which match very little prospect of issue was expected, to prevent the descendants of the Chancellor, by his daughter, coming in direct succession to the throne. Of this, however, the King sufficiently clears him, in his speech to Parliament, in these very words: &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>And I tell you, with great satisfaction and comfort to myself, that, after many hours' debate in a full council, for I think there was not above <num value="1">one</num> absent; and truly I believe, upon weighing all that can be said upon that subject, for or against it, the Lords, without <num value="1">one</num> dissenting voice, yet there were very few sate silent, advised me, with all imaginable cheerfulness, to this marriage, which I look upon as very wonderful, and even as some instances of the approbation of God himself.</hi>&rdquo; 
<P>Much about this time a serious affair took place, which caused the <hi rend=italics>Chancellor</hi> great trouble and difficulty to encounter. There had been a long course of uninterrupted friendship, both at home and abroad, between George, Earl of <hi rend=italics>Bristol</hi>, and the Earl of <hi rend=italics>Clarendon</hi>, so that the same seemed to be like the <hi rend=italics>Gordian</hi> knot, indissoluble: but the Chancellor refusing a small boon, as the Earl of <hi rend=italics>Bristol</hi> took it to be, which it was said, was the passing a patent in favour of a court lady, and wherein the Chancellor, who was the best judge of his own office, was certainly in the right; this so soured the other's spirits, as never dreaming he should be denied, that his thoughts suggested nothing to him from thenceforwards, but malice and the highest revenge; and having digested all things within himself, which he imagined might tend to the disadvantage of the Chancellor, he <num value="1">first</num> made a bitter and artful speech against him in the House of Lords; and then, on the <datestruct VALUE="1663-07-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct>, exhibited articles of high treason, and other heinous misdemeanours, against <hi rend=italics>Edward</hi>, Earl of <hi rend=italics>Clarendon</hi>, Lord High Chancellor of England. This bold attack upon the Lord Chancellor, though he came off without any blemish, rendered him more cautious and circumspect in his conduct: so that things, in all outward appearance, went smoothly on with him, bating that the gout racked him now and then, till the war with the Dutch broke out, which the libellers of that age made to be <num value="1">one</num> of his heinous crimes, though he abhorred it. 
<P>But the Earl's greatest misfortune befell him on the <datestruct VALUE="1667-08-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1667">1667</year></datestruct>, when the Great Seal was taken from him; and it is incredible with what rage and fury everybody fell upon him. When the Parliament met on the <num value="10">10th</num> of 
<hi rend=italics>October</hi> following, both Houses thanked the King in a more especial manner, for having displaced the Earl, and removed him from the exercise of any public trust and employment; and the Commons proceeding to draw up articles against him, Mr. <hi rend=italics>Seymour</hi>, in the name of the Commons of <hi rend=italics>England</hi>, impeached him, at the bar of the House of Lords, of treason, and other high crimes and misdemeanors. About this time, his Lordship thinking it advisable for him to withdraw out of the kingdom for his greater security, he sent a petition to the House of Lords in a very noble style; and, though writ with an air of great candour and sincerity, had no influence at all in his favour. There were several conferences held between the Lords and Commons, about the manner of proceeding against the Earl, which ended at last in a bill for banishing and disabling him. 
<P>It should be observed, that my Lord <hi rend=italics>Clarendon's</hi> address, or paper, to the House of Lords, which was printed in those days under the opprobrious title of <hi rend=italics>News from Dunkirk House; or</hi>, Clarendon's <hi rend=italics>Farewell to</hi> England; <hi rend=italics>in his seditious Address to the Right Honourable the House of Peers</hi>, on the <num value="3">3</num>d of December; was, on the <num value="12">12th</num> of the same month, according to the sentence and judgment of both Houses of Parliament, burnt by the hands of the common hangman, in the presence of the <num value="2">two</num> Sheriffs of <hi rend=italics>London</hi> and <hi rend=italics>Middlesex</hi>, with great and signal applause of the populace.

<P>But the true cause of the noble Earl's disgrace, proceeded from the opposition he made to the desires of the royal brothers, Charles II. and the Duke of York, it being well known his zeal for the Protestant religion was such, that some time before he was turned out, he refused to seal a new commission for the Duke of York to evade a late act made against Popery. 
<P><hi rend=italics>Welwood</hi>, in his Memoirs, informs us, on the restoration of Charles II. he possessed so entirely the hearts of the people, that they thought nothing was too much for them to grant, or for him to receive. Among other designs to please him, there was <num value="1">one</num> formed at <hi rend=italics>Court</hi>, to settle such a <hi rend=italics>revenue</hi> upon him by Parliament, during life, as should place him beyond the necessity of asking more, except in the case of a war, or some such extraordinary occasion; that the Earl of <hi rend=italics>Southampton</hi>, Lord High Treasurer, came heartily into it, out of a mere principle of honour and affection to the King, but that Chancellor <hi rend=italics>Clarendon</hi> secretly opposed it; that it happened that they <num value="2">two</num> had a private conference about the matter; and the Chancellor, being earnest to bring the Treasurer to his opinion, took the freedom to tell him, that he was better acquainted with the King's temper and inclinations, than <hi rend=italics>Southampton</hi> could reasonably expect to be, having had long and intimate acquaintance with His Majesty abroad; and that he knew him so well, that if such a 
<hi rend=italics>revenue</hi> was once settled upon him for life, <hi rend=italics>neither of them <num value="2">two</num> would be of any further use, and that they were not, in probability, to see many more sessions of Parliament during that reign:</hi> that <hi rend=italics>Southampton</hi> was brought over, but that this passage could not be kept so secret, but it came to King Charles's ears; which, together with other things, wherein <hi rend=italics>Clarendon</hi> was misrepresented to him, proved the true reason why he abandoned him to his enemies. 
<P>On the death of the Duke of Albemarle, which happened <datestruct VALUE="1669-01-3"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=3>3</day>, <year reg=1669>1669</year></datestruct>-<num value="70">70</num>, Clarendon House came into possession of James, Duke of Ormond, who, in <datestruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>, in his way to this place, where his Grace at that time lived, was seized and dragged out of his coach by the infamous Colonel Blood and his associates, who intended to hang his Grace at Tyburn, in revenge for justice done, under his administration in <hi rend=italics>Ireland</hi>, on some of their companions. This refinement in revenge saved the Duke's life; he had leisure to disengage himself from the villain on horseback, to whom he was tied, by which time he was discovered by his affrighted domestics, and rescued from death. Blood was soon after taken in the attempt to steal the crown. But the Court had use for so complete a villain, and sunk so low as to apply to his Grace for pardon of the offence against him; the Duke granted it with a generous indignation. Blood had a pension of <num value="500">five hundred</num> a year, and was constantly seen in the presence-chamber, as is supposed to show to the great uncomplying men of the time what a ready instrument the ministry had to revenge any attempt that might be made against them in the cause of liberty. 
<P>The residence of the Duke of Ormond at Clarendon House, could have been but for a short time, the Duke of Albemarle having sold the house and grounds prior to his decease. Strype notices it in the following words: &ldquo;<hi rend=italics>Albemarle Buildings</hi>, so called as being the seat of the Duke of <hi rend=italics>Albemarle</hi>, who bought it of the Earl of Clarendon, and before called by his name; which said House and Garden being sold by the said Duke, was, by the undertakers, laid out into streets, who, not being in a condition to finish so great a work, made mortgages, and so entangled the title, that it is not to this day finished, and God knows when it will; so that it lieth like the ruins of <hi rend=italics>Troy</hi>, some having the foundations begun, others carried up to the roofs, and others covered, but none of the inside work done; yet those houses that are finished towards <hi rend=italics>Pickadilly</hi>, meet with tenants. In this building, which takes the general name of 
<hi rend=italics>Albemarle Buildings</hi>, are these streets; viz., <hi rend=italics>Bond Street</hi>, at the upper end of which, in the fields, is a curious, neat, but small chapel, serving as a chapel of ease for the inhabitants of these parts; which said chapel was built by King <hi rend=italics>James the <num value="2">Second</num></hi>, at <hi rend=italics>Hounslow Heath</hi>, for his use, when he had his camp there, and was by the late King <hi rend=italics>William</hi> given to the inhabitants, who here erected it<NOTE N="*"><P>This chapel was entirely constructed of wood, and contrived to be moved from place to place on wheels.</NOTE>. <hi rend=italics>Albemarle Street</hi> in the midst, which fronts <hi rend=italics>St. James's Street. Dover Street</hi>, the best of all for large buildings, and hath the most finished and inhabited houses for gentry, especially the west side

<P>This view has been engraved from a curious original picture at Dulwich College; which, that a more correct drawing might be taken for the purpose of engraving, was, by order of the warden and gentlemen belonging to that foundation, carefully and thoroughly cleaned and repaired. 
<P>It represents Somerset House in a very <hi rend=italics>early</hi> state, and probably but little altered from the style in which it had been built by its founder, Edward Duke of Somerset. The numerous other views of this mansion only preserve its appearance subsequent to the alterations made by Inigo Jones. The continuation of objects on the Thames side, has been given in detail in the other part of this publication; viz. Worcester House, Durham House, Suffolk House, &amp;c. In the distance are Westminster Hall, the House of Commons, and Lambeth Palace; and, immediately behind the Savoy, which adjoins Somerset House, is the view of Exeter House, which originally occupied the site of the present &ldquo;Exeter &lsquo;Change.&rdquo; 
<P>This stately palace was erected by Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, Lord Protector, and uncle to King Edward VI., from whom it received its name. Stow informs us, that it was built on the site of a mansion called &ldquo;Chester Inn,&rdquo; which had been once the town residence of the bishops of that see, and afterwards an inn for lawyers; and in the place of some other smaller tenements; and that the Duke, in order to supply the materials, demolished the neighbouring church of St. Mary le Strand, the magnificent cloister of St. Paul's, and great part of the fine church belonging to the monastery of St. John of Jerusalem; acts of sacrilege for which he was then, and has been since, justly censured. By his subsequent attainder, this property became forfeited to the crown. 
<P>In the reign of James I. Somerset House changed its name to &ldquo;Denmark House,&rdquo; in compliment to Anne of Denmark, the queen of that monarch, to whom it was given as a residence. On this occasion, the whole underwent a thorough repair, and the alterations and additions we have before noticed, were made by Inigo Jones, which completely changed its appearance, as given in the plate. 
<P>Henrietta-Maria, the queen of Charles I. succeeded in the occupancy of Denmark House, which now again resumed its original name of Somerset House, which it has ever since retained. Here she was allowed to keep up her religious establishment; here also were produced many of those magnificent masques, which constituted great part of the courtly amusement of that day. 
<P>From this period, for many years, Somerset House continued to be equally distinguished by the rank of its inhabitants, and even the events of which it was occasionally the scene. Here the funeral obsequies of Oliver Cromwell were solemnized with more than regal magnificence, and a final period was put to all his ambition by the removal of his body for interment to Westminster Abbey. 
<P>It became again the scene of royal splendour in the reign of Charles II. when it was occupied by his queen, Catherine of Portugal and her household. The mysterious murder of Sir Edmondbury Godfrey, a transaction, the particulars of which never yet have been satisfactorily elucidated, is said to have been perpetrated within its limits. It was afterwards, until it was lately rebuilt, appropriated to various purposes. 
<P>The present elegant pile is the production of Sir William Chambers, and must be confessed, in point of architectural beauty, far to excel the original structure. It is still, however, in an unfinished state, though it contains at present many of those offices, in which are transacted the various important concerns of the British Empire. 
<P>The Publisher begs to return his grateful thanks to the Warden and Fellows of Dulwich College, for their liberal permission to make the engraving for this work from their valuable picture. <pb id="p.159" n="159">

<P>This print is the <num value="1">first</num> of a series intended to be engraved for the present work. The originals are by Hollar, and are preserved in the Pepysian collection at Cambridge. They are chiefly outlines, made with a pen and ink, and slightly shaded, and appear to have been executed in the early part of the reign of Charles the <num value="1">First</num>. 
<P>Suffolk House was built on the site of the hospital of St. Mary Rouncival by Henry Howard, Earl of Northampton, who died there in <datestruct value="1614--"><year reg="1614">1614</year></datestruct>. From him it descended to the Earl of Suffolk, whose daughter afterwards intermarrying with Piercy Earl of Northumberland, it came into the possession of that peer, and has ever since remained in his family.<NOTE N="*"><P>It acquired its name of Suffolk House while it was inhabited by Thomas Howard of Walden, Earl of Suffolk, and his son Theophilus, Lord Howard; previous to which it had been called &ldquo;Northampton House.&rdquo; It changed its name to Northumberland House, when it came to be inhabited by the above-mentioned Piercy Earl of Northumberland.</NOTE> Many additions and alterations have been made of late years. 
<P>It appears, from the view here given, to have been, in its original state, a very large and magnificent mansion, built in the mixed style of architecture which prevailed in the early part of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century. The state part of the structure, as now, was quadrangular, the <num value="4">four</num> sides enclosing a small court-yard, and having towers at the angles in the Dutch taste. The domestic offices were detached from the main building, and reached to the water-side, in the manner of some of the noble residences still standing on the banks of the Thames. The space between, shaded by tall trees, was laid out in walks and gardens.

<p><figure id="fig.1.158.2" n="2000.65.0098"><head>York House.</head></figure>
<P>This mansion acquired the above name from having been the town residence of the Archbishops of York, it had been anciently the Bishop of Norwich's Inn; but was exchanged in <datestruct value="1535--"><year reg="1535">1535</year></datestruct> for the Abbey of St. Bennet Hohm, in Norfolk. The next possessor, Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, had it in exchange for his house, called Southwark Palace. In the reign of Queen Mary it was purchased by Dr. Heath, Archbishop of York, and called York House. Archbishop Matthew, in the reign of James the <num value="1">First</num>, exchanged it with the Crown, and had several manors in lieu of it. It was next the residence of Lord Chancellors Egerton and Bacon; after which it was granted to George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, who rebuilt it most magnificently. In <datestruct value="1648--"><year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct> the Parliament bestowed it on General Fairfax, whose daughter and heir marrying George Villiers the <num value="2">second</num> Duke of Buckingham, the house reverted to its true owner, who resided here for several years subsequent to the Restoration. It was disposed of by him, and several streets laid out on the site, which go under his names and titles, &ldquo;George Street, Villiers Street, Duke Street, of Alley, and Buckingham Street.&rdquo; 
<P>Some idea of the magnificence of York House may be formed from the accompanying plate. It appears to have been of very considerable extent, and most probably contained numerous splendid apartments. The celebrated stairs, which still remain at the bottom of Buckingham Street, have been long deservedly admired, and form unquestionably the most perfect piece of building that does honour to his name of Inigo Jones; who, it is not unlikely, was the architect of York House itself.

<P>Spelman (<hi rend=italics>Reliqui&aelig; Spelmanian&aelig;</hi>) informs us, that Bishop Tonstal, in <num value="26">26</num> Henry VIII. exchanged this mansion with the King for the building called &ldquo;Coldharborough,&rdquo; in Thames Street, and other premises in London, and converted it into a royal palace. Edward VI. gave it to his sister Elizabeth as a temporary residence: and the see of Durham being soon afterwards dissolved by a smuggled act, which gave its rich possessions to the Crown, the same monarch bestowed Coldharbour on the Earl of Shrewsbury: Queen Mary, who considered the gift as sacrilege, permitted the Earl to retain Coldharbour; but to compensate the see of Durham for that loss, gave her reversion of Durham House to the Bishop next in succession, when Elizabeth's life-interest expired. In consequence of this grant, Sir Walter Raleigh (to whom the Queen had given the use of it during her life) was in the next reign obliged to resign the possession to the then Bishop of Durham, Toby Matthew, afterwards Archbishop of York.<NOTE N="*"><P>Bishop of Durham's Case.</NOTE>

<P>Was a noble turretted mansion, built by the famous Secretary Cecil, afterwards Earl of Salisbury, and Lord Treasurer to James I.; evidently in the style of architecture which prevailed at that period. After the founder's death, being thought too extensive for the residence of the then Earl, it was divided into <num value="2">two</num> mansions, the lesser of which, itself a large house, was let to persons of quality: some years afterwards it was divided into various tenements, till at length it was purchased by builders, and &ldquo;Salisbury Street&rdquo; erected on the site. Another part, adjoining &ldquo;Great Salisbury House,&rdquo; and over the long gallery, was converted into an Exchange, and called the Middle Exchange, which consisted of a very long and large room, with shops on both sides, having a passage from the Strand down to the water side, at the bottom of which was a handsome flight of stairs to take boat at; but it had, says Strype, the bad luck to be nicknamed &ldquo;Whore's Nest;&rdquo; whereby, with the ill fate that attended it, few or no people took shops there, and those that did were soon weary and left them; insomuch that it lay useless, except <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> shops towards the Strand; and coming into the Earl's hands, this Exchange, with Great Salisbury House, and the houses fronting the street, were pulled down, and converted into a fair street, called Cecil Street.&rdquo;<NOTE N="*"><P>Strype's Stowe, v. ii. p. <num value="120">120</num>, ed. <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>.</NOTE>

<P>Concerning building the old house, says Strype, (he must mean <hi rend=italics>enlarging</hi> it,) there goes this story: That there being a very large walnut-tree growing in the garden, which much obstructed the eastern prospect of Salisbury House near adjoining, it was proposed to the Earl of Worcester's gardener by the Earl of Salisbury, or his agent, that if he could prevail with his lord to cut down the said tree, he should have <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>.; which offer was told to the Earl of Worcester, who ordered him to do it, and take the <measure value="100l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100">100</num></measure>.; both which were performed to the great satisfaction of the Earl of Salisbury, as he thought; but there being no great kindness betwixt the <num value="2">two</num> Earls, the Earl of Worcester soon caused to be built, in the place of the walnut tree, a large brick house, which then took away the whole east prospect.

<P>The once magnificent mansion of the celebrated Sir Paul Pindar, of which a very small portion remains, at present designated by the name of the Paul Pindar Wine Vaults, on the west side of Bishopsgate Street Without, was, in its original state, equal, if not superior, in splendour and extent to any structure, not only within its immediate vicinity, but probably to any in, or surrounding, the metropolis. His immense wealth and princely endowments, both as a merchant and ambassador, required an establishment that might vie with any subject of his time, and on more occasions than <num value="1">one</num>, majesty itself was beholden to his purse and interest for supplies. History furnishes us with accounts of the sumptuous manner in which our early citizens lived; and the ever-memorable feast of Henry Picard, Vintner and Lord Mayor in <datestruct value="1356--"><year reg="1356">1356</year></datestruct>, proves the superior wealth and power of a British merchant throughout the world. Sir Paul Pindar, in means and liberality, appears to have been nothing behind Picard, and in his charities greatly exceeded him. He expended <num value="19000">19,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> in the repairs of St. Paul's Cathedral, and was esteemed at <num value="1">one</num> time worth <num value="236000">236,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi>, exclusive of bad debts. Such a person would naturally emulate the most wealthy of his brother-citizens, and require a larger domestic establishment than the extent of a modern public-house. 
<P>The front of Sir Paul Pindar's mansion probably extended from the entrance of Half Moon Alley to the <num value="1">One</num> Swan Yard in Bishopsgate Street, and in depth reached to the Broadway leading into Long Alley. 
<P>The space immediately behind the entrance to the London Workhouse is occupied by a brick structure above <num value="400">400</num> feet in length, and consists of workrooms and apartments for the inmates of that establishment. At the extremity of the building was a Chapel, almost wholly pulled down within the last <num value="3">three</num> years; descending from which, by a flight of <num value="11">eleven</num> steps, are the remains of an old building used as a prison for the Ludgate debtors on the demolishing Ludgate Prison, Ludgate Hill, in <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>, and which continued to be so used until the Compter in Giltspur Street was made ready for their reception in <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>, whence they were finally removed to Whitecross Street Prison in <datestruct VALUE="1815-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>. The entrance to the part which contained the Ludgate prisoners was from Green Dragon Yard, in Half Moon Alley, where a direction-board is still remaining, on which is painted, &ldquo;The back-way to the <hi rend=italics>Green Draggon</hi> and to Ludgate.&rdquo; The Chapel (which was once adorned with a cupola and clock) separated the Prison from the Workhouse; the whole site of which, with that of the adjoining buildings, constituted formerly the site of Sir Paul Pindar's house and grounds. 
<P>The apartments over the arched entrance to Half Moon Alley, from Bishopsgate Street, were occupied at the time our drawing was made by a veterinary surgeon, who had symbolically nailed up a horse-shoe, appropriate to his other vocation, a farrier. 
<P>On the north side of the Chancel of St. Botolph Bishopsgate Church, fronting south on a spacious white marble monument, is inscribed in large black letters, &ldquo;Sir Paul Pindar, Knight, his Majesty's Ambassador to the Turkish Emperor, Anno Dom. <datestruct value="1611--"><year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct>, and <num value="9">nine</num> years' resident.

His father had bred him at school in a way to fit him for the University; but the son rather inclining to be a tradesman, he sent him to London, where he was bound an apprentice at the age of <num value="17">seventeen</num> years, to Mr. John Porvish, an Italian merchant, who sent him, after he had served half his time, to be his factor at Venice, where he served out the rest; and then, having great commissions, both from his master and divers others of the most trading kingdoms, he continued in Italy and parts adjacent for the space of <num value="15">fifteen</num> years, or thereabouts, trading upon his own account and commissions, where he got a very plentiful estate; then returned into England, where, after he had traded <num value="5">five</num> years longer, and appearing the most eminent merchant upon the Exchange, both for experience, estate, person, and languages, the Turkey Company, in the year <datestruct value="1611"><year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct>, importuned King James to send him Ambassador to the Grand Seignior at Constantinople; which employment, after much solicitation, he embraced, to the great satisfaction of the King and the Turkey Company, in whose service he continued <num value="9">nine</num> years, and by his good conduct much improved the Levant trade and manufactures of England, which had been undermined by the French and Dutch. After his return from the embassy, in the year <datestruct value="1620"><year reg="1620">1620</year></datestruct>, upon the persuasion of Sir William Cockayne and Sir Arthur Ingram, he was brought to be <num value="1">one</num> of the Farmers of the Customs, and to advance monies for supplies of the late King's (Charles I.) necessary occasions, and to furnish the Crown with jewels, to his infinite loss and prejudice. Nevertheless, he manifested his loyalty to that degree towards the preservation of the royal family, that he sent several considerable sums of money, in gold, to King Charles I. at Oxford by Madam Jane Whorewood, in the years <datestruct value="1643--"><year reg=1643>1643</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1644--"><year reg=1644>1644</year></datestruct>, for transportation (the King's own phraseology) of the Queen and her children, for safety, out of the kingdom. 
<P>King James having knighted him, offered as a reward for his services, to make him his Lieutenant of the Tower; but this honour Sir Paul humbly refused, and the rather, in regard his Majesty desired to purchase Sir Paul's diamond jewel of <num value="30000">30,000</num><hi rend=italics>l.</hi> value, upon credit. Sir Paul brought home this diamond from Turkey, and lent it to King James to <pb id="p.162" n="162"> wear at divers times on days of great solemnity, at opening parliaments and when audiences were given to foreign ambassadors. It was afterwards sold to King Charles I.<NOTE N="*"><P>King Charles the <num value="1">First</num>, in his troubles, previous to his quitting London, had almost stripped the Jewel Office of its richest gems. It is well ascertained that the great pearl in the Imperial Crown was pledged to the Dutch for a considerable sum to furnish arms, through the agency of his Queen, Henrietta Maria: and it is asserted, that, prior to the year <datestruct value="1634"><year reg="1634">1634</year></datestruct>, he had pawned <num value="1">one</num> jewel to the Queen of Bohemia for <hi rend=italics><measure value="30000l." type=currency><num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> pounds</measure>.</hi> That he pawned such a jewel is very likely, but very improbable to the Queen of Bohemia; that Princess, after expulsion from her titulary kingdom, being in great distress, after the decease of her husband Frederic, who died <datestruct VALUE="1632-11-29"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=29>29</day>, <year reg=1632>1632</year></datestruct>. It is every way more reasonable to conjecture, the money raised by her brother King Charles, was appropriated to the support of herself and numerous offspring, all of whom were entirely dependent on the bounty of their royal uncle. King Charles the <num value="2">Second</num>, after the Restoration, wrote a letter to <num value="1">one</num> of the Sidney family, soliciting assistance for his aunt, the Queen of Bohemia; the original letter is in the Bindley Collection.</NOTE>

<P>Howell, in <num value="1">one</num> of his Familiar Letters, addressed to Sir Paul Pindar, notices him as <num value="1">one</num> eminently distinguished for pious works of charity already done, and daily doing; and that in such a manner, that the left hand knows not what the right doth. 
<P>James Forbes, Esq. of Stanmore Hill, whose lady is descended from Sir Paul Pindar's family, is in possession of <num value="2">two</num> very curious pictures of Sir Paul and his brother, painted in miniature during their residence at Constantinople. That of the brother was painted <num value="1">first</num>, being inscribed, &ldquo;Pindar, Aet. <num value="31">31</num>, Constantinopolj, Anno <datestruct value="1613"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct>.&rdquo; Its companion &ldquo;Sir Paul Pindar, Anno <datestruct value="1614"><year reg="1614">1614</year></datestruct>, Constantinopolj.&rdquo; They are evidently the work of an English artist (probably taken out by Sir Paul purposely), the Turks to the present day holding it a sin against their religion to copy or delineate any living thing. This brother, of whose personal history little is known, it is likely assisted Sir Paul in quality of Secretary, and died long before him (Sir Paul living to the great age of <num value="84">84</num>), leaving his affairs in such a perplexed state, that his executor, William Toomes, unable to bear the disappointment, destroyed himself. The pictures of Sir Paul and his brother have been very neatly engraved by T. Trotter. 
<P>Nearly at the extremity of Half Moon Alley is still remaining an ancient house, traditionally said among the neighbourhood to have been occupied by Sir Paul Pindar's gardener, but more probably it might have been the lodge or garden entrance to the grounds appertaining to the principal dwelling. The architecture is of the same antiquity as the remains of the front in Bishopsgate Street; and though not so richly ornamented and adorned, had <num value="4">four</num> large basso relievos in front, <num value="1">one</num> on each side of the <num value="1">first</num> and <num value="2">second</num> floor windows. In the accompanying View these basso relievos have been engraved on a larger scale, on the same plate, for the purpose of making out the figures and ornamented borders, which could not have been sufficiently explained in the confined space of the general view. 
<P>In Half Moon Alley, adjoining the remains of Sir Paul Pindar's house, is a continuation of the ancient brick-work of this once extensive mansion, at present converted into <num value="4">four</num> private dwelling-houses, as separate tenements from the public-house, now kept by Mr. Wheeler. The extent of the house and grounds formerly embraced all the space now occupied by the London Workhouse. The detached premises in Half Moon Alley, and the adjoining house in Bishopsgate Street, late in the occupation of Mr. Viven,<NOTE N="*"><P>The name as it stands in our Plate was correct, through afterwards altered to Vivian.</NOTE> were sold by public auction, <datestruct VALUE="1817-11-25"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=25>25th</day>, <year reg=1817>1817</year></datestruct>, on a lease, <num value="7">seven</num> years of which were then unexpired.

<P>The noble family whence this stately mansion took its <num value="1">first</num> name, traces its descent from the ancient family of Montacute (in Latin, De Monte Aucto), or more properly, Montagu in Normandy, which had an increase of honour by a matrimonial alliance with Ralph de Monthermer, who having married the Princess Joan de Acres, <num value="2">second</num> daughter of Edward I. King of England, without her father's consent, was committed prisoner to the castle of Bristol, where he remained, till, by the intercession of Anthony de Bec, Bishop of Durham, he was not only reinstated in the King's favour, but restored to all his former possessions, which were increased; besides being summoned to parliament by the Title of Earl of Gloucester and Hereford. 
<P>The descendant, in a right line, from the above most honourable alliance, was Ralph, Lord Montagu, who succeeded his father, as Lord Montagu, in <datestruct value="1683--"><year reg="1683">1683</year></datestruct>. 
<P>This nobleman had received his education in Westminster school, where he wrote a Latin elegy, under the title of <hi rend=italics>Lachrym&aelig; Musarum</hi>, in memory of Henry, Lord Hastings, eldest son of Ferdinando, Earl of Huntingdon, which was published in <datestruct value="1650--"><year reg="1650">1650</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1669--"><year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct> he was sent ambassador extraordinary to the French king, and made his public entry into Paris, on the <datestruct VALUE="-04-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></datestruct>, in a splendid and magnificent manner, having <num value="74">seventy-four</num> pages, and their footmen in rich liveries; <num value="12">twelve</num> led horses, with their furniture; <num value="24">twenty-four</num> gentlemen on horseback; with eighteen English noblemen and gentlemen of quality, in <num value="4">four</num> rich coaches, each drawn by <num value="8">eight</num> horses, and <num value="2">two</num> stately chariots, made as beautiful and costly as art and workmanship could contrive, each drawn by <num value="6">six</num> horses. The ambassador himself was conducted to his audience in the French king's coach of state. In France he formed his ideas of building and gardening; and his house at Boughton, in Northamptonshire, as well as that we are about to describe, the models of which were taken from the royal palace of Versailles, amply indicate his taste for magnificence. 
<P>On the site of Montagu House, in Bloomsbury, had stood a very stately mansion; and, during Lord Montagu's retirement into France, at the latter end of the reign of Charles II. and the commencement of that of James II. for whose Bill of Exclusion his Lordship had been very active, Lord Montagu had lent that mansion to the Earl of Devonshire, reserving some rooms for his own use; unfortunately the whole was consumed by an accidental fire, <datestruct VALUE="1685-01-20"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=20>20</day>, <year reg=1685>1685</year></datestruct>-<num value="6">6</num>, by which his Lordship sustained a loss of <measure value="30000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="30000">30,000</num></measure>;<NOTE N="*"><P>The circumstance is thus related by Collins, in his Peerage, vol. i. p. <num value="339">339</num>, edit. <datestruct value="1749--"><year reg="1749">1749</year></datestruct>: &ldquo;But my Lord Montagu, not liking the measures of the Court, retired to France, where he resided till a sad accident brought him to England.

During the remainder of that inauspicious reign, Lord Montagu was indefatigable in rebuilding the mansion as it now stands, and &ldquo;it was observable that little or no alteration could be made to advantage from the original model.&rdquo; 
<P>In <datestruct VALUE="1689-04--"><month reg="04">April</month> <year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct>, having been reinstated in his place of Master of the great Wardrobe, which had been wrested from him, he was by King William and Queen Mary, for his eminent services and great abilities, advanced to higher honours, by being created Viscount Mounthermer and Earl of Montagu. Queen Anne increased these honours, in the <num value="4">fourth</num> year of her reign, by raising his Lordship to the highest dignity of nobility, by the titles of Marquis of Mounthermer and Duke of Montagu; which dignities he maintained with a spirit equal to his high titles and vast fortune, and lived in as great splendour and magnificence as any person in Great Britain; and when he deceased, at Montagu House, Bloomsbury, on the <datestruct VALUE="1708-03-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month> <year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>-<num value="9">9</num>, he left a princely estate and fortune to his son, John, Duke of Montagu, who died <datestruct VALUE="1749-07-16"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=16>16</day>, <year reg=1749>1749</year></datestruct>, without male issue, by which the titles of Duke, Earl, and Viscount became for that period extinct. 
<P>George Brudenell, Earl of Cardigan, having married Lady Mary, youngest daughter of the late Duke, assumed the name and arms of Montagu, and was created, <datestruct VALUE="1766-11-5"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=5>5</day>, <year reg=1766>1766</year></datestruct>, Marquis of Monthermer, and Duke of Montagu, and deceased <datestruct VALUE="1790-05-28"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=28>28</day>, <year reg=1790>1790</year></datestruct>; dying without male issue, the titles of Duke and Marquis again became extinct. This, with those of Northumberland and Wellington, were the only ducal dignities conferred during the present reign. 
<P>Having traced the history of this noble family, and given some anecdotes of their stately mansion, as Montagu House, we will endeavour to continue its history, and give a concise account of its valuable contents as <pb id="p.165" n="165"> 
<div1 type="chapter" n="54" id="c.54"><HEAD>The British Museum.</HEAD>

<P>The very eminent and valuable collection made by Sir Robert Cotton Bruce and his son, Sir Thomas Cotton; the Lord Treasurer Harley, Earl of Oxford, and his son, Edward, Earl of Oxford; Sir Hans Sloane, and other learned and scientific persons, being in a scattered state, and therefore of little public utility, it became an object of parliamentary consideration to embody the whole as a public repository, so that it might form a grand national museum. 
<P>For this purpose, after various considerable purchases, from the several families, of such inestimable documents, it was thought requisite by Parliament, <QUOTE>in order to defray the expenses necessarily implied by these purchases, and to provide a proper repository for the preservation of them, as well as a fund for the permanent support of the establishment, to raise the sum of <measure value="100000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="100000">100,000</num></measure>, by way of lottery; which having been drawn according to the provisions laid down in the act, netted the sum of <measure value="95194l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="95194">95,194</num></measure>. <num value="8">8</num><hi rend=italics>s.</hi> <num value="6">6</num><hi rend=italics>d.</hi></QUOTE> This sum, together with the several collections purchased and granted, Parliament vested in an incorporate body of Trustees, consisting of the <num value="1">first</num> characters in the kingdom for rank, station, and literary fame; at the same time conferring on them ample powers to take such measures as they should deem expedient for the disposal, preservation, and management of the institution, which it was now determined should bear the name of the BRITISH MUSEUM. 
<P>The <num value="1">first</num> act of these Trustees was to provide a proper house for the reception of the ample collections confided to their care; and after various proposals, they at length fixed on the noble mansion we are about to describe. This palace, together with its garden and appurtenances, occupying in the whole an area of <num value="7">seven</num> acres and <num value="20">twenty</num> perches of land, was ceded by the representatives of the Montagu family for the moderate sum of <measure value="10000l." type=currency><num value="10000">ten thousand</num> pounds</measure>. 
<P>The necessary repairs (which, the house having stood long empty, proved very expensive) were immediately proceeded upon, and the proper bookcases and cabinets having been completed, and the collections removed thither, and properly distributed and arranged, the Museum was at length opened for study and public inspection, <datestruct VALUE="1759-01-15"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=15>15</day>, <year reg=1759>1759</year></datestruct>. 
<P>The entrance to this magnificent structure is under a stately arched gateway, over which is a glazed dome, and a clock. On each side within the gate is a handsome colonnade of the Ionic order; which with the other <num value="3">three</num> sides, form a spacious quadrangle, the east and west sides being allotted for the residence of the principal and other librarians. 
<P>The Museum itself consists of a building <num value="216">216</num> feet in length, and <num value="57">57</num> in height to the top of the cornice, and is constructed from the plans of M. Peter Puget, a native of Marseilles, and an architect of the <num value="1">first</num> eminence in France, who had been sent from Paris by Ralph, Duke of Montagu, to erect the structure which was afterwards consumed by fire, and most probably was retained to give his assistance in forming the present splendid mansion as it now stands. 
<P>The ascent to the house is by <num value="3">three</num> handsome flights of stone steps, with iron railing, the centre of which leads to the Hall, of the Ionic order, and decorated with pilasters in pairs, the entablatures of which support a plain horizontal ceiling. The entrance to the Vestibule on the west side is under tall arches, ornamented with fanciful iron-work. 
<P>The paintings on the side of the staircase represent C&aelig;sar and his military retinue, the chiefs of the provinces he had in part subdued attending on him, and others on their knees, imploring his protection and assistance. 
<P>In a compartmeut are the feasts and sacrifices of Bacchus. 
<P>In another, the rivers Nile and Tiber are represented by gigantic figures emblematically ornamented; and there are emblematical landscapes at a distance, and several fine pieces of architecture. 
<P>On the ceiling is represented the story of Phaeton: the gods are assembled, and a youth appears asking Ph&oelig;bus to permit him to drive his chariot for a day; he consents, and in another part is seen conducting him to his chariot: Diana is near them, and Juno, attended by Iris. 
<P>Farther on, Phaeton, with all the ardour of youth, is driving the sun's chariot, accompanied by the Hours, in the form of women. Time is represented by Saturn; Eternity by a woman holding a serpent, and Cybele, or the goddess of the earth. 
<P>The landscapes and architectural decorations are by James Rousseau. 
<P>The Ground Floor consists of <num value="12">twelve</num> rooms, which contain the Library of printed Books. Strangers are not conducted through these apartments. 
<P>The companies, on being admitted according to the regulations, are immediately conducted up the great staircase, the decorations of which have been lately restored. 
<P>From the great staircase visitors are conducted into the <num value="1">First</num> Room of the Upper Story, containing a miscellaneous collection of modern works of art, from all parts of the world. The ceiling of this room, representing the fall of Phaeton, was painted by La Fosse. The contents are arranged geographically, as follows: Europe, Cases I. to IV. Asia, V. to VII. Africa, VIII. South America, IX. East Coast of North America, X. West Coast of North America, XI. to XIV. Otaheite, XV. to XVIII. Sandwich Islands and Marquesas, XIX. to XXII. Friendly Islands, XXIII. and XXIV. New Zealand, XXV. and XXVI. Various small <pb id="p.166" n="166"> articles, in <num value="2">two</num> tables. This collection, the greatest part of which consists of donations, not being strictly of a scientific nature, no further detail is here given of its contents.

<P>Saloon.&mdash;The dome of this grand apartment was painted by La Fosse. It has generally been described as representing the apotheosis of Iris; but the most probable conjecture is, that the painter meant to exhibit the birth of Minerva. The landscapes and architectural decorations are by Rousseau; the garlands of flowers by John Baptist Monoyer. Over the chimney a full-length portrait of King George II. by Shackleton. 
<P><num value="8">Eighth</num> Room.&mdash;Minerals.

In a small separate case is contained a specimen of that curious and brilliant insect, the curculio imperialis, commonly termed the diamond beetle. In the imposts round this room runs a series of drawers, containing a very numerous collection of seeds, fruits, and other vegetable articles. 
<P>Eleventh Room. Birds. The birds in this room are disposed, so far as convenience would admit, according to the Linn&aelig;an mode of arrangement.

This collection, the basis of which was formed by the cabinets of Sir Hans Sloane and Sir Robert Cotton, has been from time to time enlarged by many valuable purchases and donations, but principally by the munificent bequest of the Rev. C. M. Cracherode. It is comprehended under the <num value="3">three</num> following heads: <num value="1">1</num>. Ancient Coins. <num value="2">2</num>. Modern Coins. <num value="3">3</num>. Medals. 
<P>Ante-Room.&mdash;In the centre of the Ante-Room, at the head of the stairs, is placed the celebrated vase, which was for more than <num value="2">two</num> centuries the principal ornament of the Barberini collection. This superb specimen of Greek art was deposited in the British Museum, in <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, by His Grace the Duke of Portland. 
<P>Twelfth Room.&mdash;Collection of Sir William Hamilton. The intermediate and subsequent cases of this room are appropriated to the reception of the Greek vases, mostly found in sepulchres, within those parts of Naples denominated Magna Gr&aelig;cia. They are ornamented with paintings, elegantly representing chiefly mythological subjects. 
<P>Thirteenth Room.&mdash;Prints and Drawings, bequeathed by the Rev. C. M. Cracherode. The contents of this room, as well as those of the coins and medals, can be seen only by a few persons at a time, and by particular permission. 
<P>From the circumscribed limits to which this work is restricted, it would be impossible to give a detailed account of the many valuable curiosities contained in the British Museum, more especially as a very satisfactory and copious Synopsis has been published by order of the Trustees, to which the reader is referred, Suffice it generally to conclude, that a more excellent arrangement of valuable mementoes, preserved in so spacious and elegant a repository, under appropriate regulations for public benefit and inspection, is not easily to be found. <pb id="p.169" n="169">

<p><figure id="fig.1.168.1" n="2000.65.0103"><head>North Front of Bedford House, Bloomsbury Square.</head></figure>
<P>This spacious mansion occupied the north side of Bloomsbury Square, and for more than a century was the town residence of the noble family of Russell, Earls and Dukes of Bedford. It was built under the direction of Inigo Jones, on the site of an ancient mansion called Southampton House, belonging to Thomas Wriothesley<NOTE N="*"><P>There is a unique print purchased by Sir M. M. Sykes, Bart. which forms <num value="1">one</num> of the principal features of his very extensive and valuable collection of engraved English Portraits, of Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton (the friend of the favourite Essex and patron of Shakspeare), on horseback, accompanied by his gallant companion in arms, Henry Vere, Earl of Oxford, a fac-simile of which has been made by the publisher of this work.</NOTE>, Earl of Southampton, Lord High Treasurer to Charles II. This nobleman's <num value="2">second</num> daughter, Rachael, and at length sole heiress, was <num value="1">first</num> married to Francis, Lord Vaughan, eldest son of Richard, Earl of Carberry; but early becoming a widow, she took to her <num value="2">second</num> husband the illustrious but unfortunate William, Lord Russell, and by this union, on the death of her father, <datestruct VALUE="1667-05-16"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=16>16</day>, <year reg=1667>1667</year></datestruct>, conveyed the estate (including the ground on which Montagu House, now the British Museum, was built) to the Russell family, in which it still remains. 
<P>In the year <datestruct value="1800"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct> Bedford House was taken down, and upon the site of the house, court, and gardens, a number of large houses called Bedford Place, Montagu Street, and west side of Southampton Row, with those on the north side of Bloomsbury Square and south side of Russell Square, were erected by order of the late Duke of Bedford, who died <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>. And a noble statue of him in Russell Square, opposite Bedford Place, has the following inscription on the pedestal: Francis, Duke of Bedford, erected MDCCCIX. 
<P>In this house the patriot Lord Russell and his lady passed the happiest of their days; but his lordship's zeal for the Protestant religion induced his publicly going to Westminster Hall, and there, at the King's Bench, presenting the Duke of York as a recusant. And the active part he took in the Bill for the exclusion of the Duke from the crown, which he carried up to the House of Lords, <datestruct VALUE="1680-11-15"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=15>15</day>, <year reg=1680>1680</year></datestruct>, at the head of more than <num value="200">two Hundred</num> of the House of Commons, cost him his life. Sir William Temple writes, that his setting himself at the head of these affairs, had a great influence on the House, being a person in general repute for an honest worthy gentleman, without tricks or private ambition, and who was known to venture as great a stake as any subject of England. 
<P>Lord Russell was accused of being concerned in the Rye House Plot; and though he knew of a messenger being sent for him, before he was apprehended, and might have escaped, he suspected that would give the court too great an advantage, and like confessing of guilt, which he was not conscious of, having no thought of the discourse that had passed at Shepherd's where he was tasting of wines. It is reported he had just sat down to dinner with his lady, at the time of his apprehension, and that from that period to the time of her ladyship's death, that apartment was closed, and not an article in it disturbed. 
<P>He was brought to his trial at the Old Bailey, <datestruct VALUE="1683-07-13"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=13>13</day>, <year reg=1683>1683</year></datestruct>; and the most that was proved against him was, his being present where treasonable matter was discoursed, without bearing a part in that discourse, or giving any assent by words or otherwise to what was so discoursed, which amounted but to misprision or concealment of treason. He was a man of so much candour, that he spoke little as to the fact; for being advised not to tell the whole truth, he said he could not speak against that he knew to be true, though in some particulars it had been carried beyond the truth against him, and he was not allowed to make the difference; so he left it wholly with the jury, who brought in their verdict against him for high treason, upon which he received sentence of death. 
<P>He had the fortitude afterward, when Lord Cavendish offered to change clothes with him in the prison, and remain there while 
he made his escape, to reject the request, and not suffer his friend to expose himself to so much danger. Lord Russell bore his misfortunes with magnanimity, and only in <num value="2">two</num> instances appeared to be moved with any apparent weakness. After the last tender parting with his lady was over, he ejaculated with uncommon emphasis, Now the bitterness of death is over! And when he passed in sight of his house (the late Bedford House in Bloomsbury Square) then called Southampton House from its former owners, in the way to the place of execution in Lincoln's Inn Fields, the tears started in his eyes, on the recollection of the happy domestic hours he had there spent. He was beheaded <datestruct VALUE="1683-07-21"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=21>21</day>, <year reg=1683>1683</year></datestruct>, in the <num value="45">forty-fifth</num> year of his age. 
<P>Lady Russell endured the separation from her husband, and his untimely death, with, if possible, more than Roman fortitude, and the patience of a devout Christian; but neither the tears of England, nor the parliamentary abolition of the attainder nor the ducal honours conferred on her family, could make her cease to mourn the violent death of her lord. While Archbishop Tillotson lived, he was her comforter and counsellor; nor did he think it lessened his reputation to ask advice of so much worth and knowledge. Constant weeping impaired her sight; she was couched, but blindness ensued; and she died, <datestruct VALUE="1723-09-29"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=29>29</day>, <year reg=1723>1723</year></datestruct>, at the age of <num value="87">eighty-seven</num>; surviving the death of Lord Russell <num value="40">forty</num> years, <num value="2">two</num> months, and <num value="8">eight</num> days. 
<P>On the advancement of the Prince and Princess of Orange to the throne, the nation entertained such a sense of Lord Russell's innocence and great merit, that on the <datestruct VALUE="1688-03-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month> <year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>-<num value="9">9</num>, an Act was passed for annulling and making void the attainder of William Russell, Esq. commonly called Lord Russell. And on the <datestruct VALUE="1694-05-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month> <year reg="1694">1694</year></datestruct>, his father, the aged Earl of Bedford, was created Marquis of Tavistock and Duke of Bedford, by letters patent of King William and Queen Mary. 
<P>Among other reasons for bestowing these honours, it is set forth: &ldquo;That this was not the least, that he was father to the Lord Russell, the ornament of his age, whose great merits it was not enough to transmit to posterity, but they were willing to record them in the royal patent, to remain in the family, as a monument consecrated to his consummate virtue, whose name could never be forgot, so long as men preserved any esteem for sanctity of manners, greatness of mind, and a love to their country, constant even to death. Therefore to solace his excellent father for so great a loss, to celebrate the memory of so noble a son, and to excite his worthy grandson, the heir of such mighty hopes, more cheerfully to emulate and follow the example of his illustrious father, they intailed this high dignity upon the Earl and his posterity.&rdquo; 
<P>The Earls of Bedford, previous to the occupation of this house, had their town residence on the north side of the Strand, when when Edward VI, in the year <datestruct value="1552"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct>, had no sooner granted the precinct of Covent Garden, with its appurtenances, to John of Earl of Bedford, than he erected a house therein for the use of himself and family. This house, which stood till the year <datestruct value="1794"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>, occupied the lower end of the present Southampton Street, and was called Bedford House. It was a mean wooden building, shut up from the street by an ordinary brick wall, with a garden on the north, whose northern boundary ran along where the front of the southern row of buildings of Covent Garden is at present situate; without which, where the street now is, the market was kept. But Southampton and Tavistock Streets, with Southampton Passage, being erected on the site and gardens of Bedford House, the market was removed further into the square, where it has ever since continued. 
<P>The <num value="1">first</num> of the Bedford family that resided in Bedford House, Bloomsbury Square, after Lord William Russell, was his son Wriothesley, the <num value="2">second</num> Duke, who had his Christian name from his maternal grandfather the last Earl of that family. 
<P>Beside the mansion in Bloomsbury Square, the Earls of Southampton had a spacious house in Holborn, formerly called Lincoln Place, on the site of which is formed the present Southampton buildings. The only part of the ancient building that remains is the chapel, which was rented by the late Mr. Lockyer Davis as a warehouse for books. <pb id="p.170" n="170"> 
<P>It was not the sight of the house in Holborn that excited the feeling of Lord Russell in his way to the place of execution, but the view of the house in Bloomsbury, which then was not obscured by the numerous houses and streets that have since sprung up on the site of what was then open fields. Of the old Southampton House there is a small view to be seen in Aggas' Plan of London, published in the year <datestruct value="1560"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>, in which it appears to centre in a park, without any house or other building in its neighbourhood, except the old church of St. Pancras in the distance; but the ground has since been covered by squares and streets to the very extremity of Kentish Town. 
<P>Bedford House and offices occupied the whole north side of Bloomsbury Square: this mansion, exclusive of the basement, was only of <num value="1">one</num> story in height, but the apartments were spacious and magnificent. 
<P>Lady Rachael Russell, in a letter to Dr. Fitzwilliam, dated <datestruct VALUE="1685-01-22"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=22>22</day>, <year reg=1685>1685</year></datestruct>-<num value="6">6</num> (<num value="2">two</num> years and a half after the death of Lord Russell) gives an interesting account of the destruction of the neighbouring Montagu House by fire, in which it will be perceived, that her own was in danger of participating the same fate. The passage runs thus: &ldquo;If you have heard of the dismal accident in this neighbourhood, you will easily believe Tuesday night was not a very quiet <num value="1">one</num> with us. About <num value="1">one</num> o'clock in the night I heard a great noise in the square, so little ordinary, I called up a servant, and sent her down to learn the occasion. She brought up a very sad <num value="1">one</num>, that Montagu House was on fire, and it was so indeed: it burnt with so great violence, the whole house was consumed by <num value="5">five</num> o'clock. The wind blew strong this way, so that we lay under fire a great part of the time, the sparks and flames continually covering the house, and filling the court. My boy awaked, and said he was almost stifled with smoke, but being told the reason, would see it, and so was satisfied without fear: took a strange bedfellow<NOTE N="*"><P>These juvenile bedfellows were her son Wriothesley (afterward <num value="2">second</num> Duke of Bedford) and Lord James Cavendish, <num value="3">third</num> son of the Earl of Devonshire.</NOTE> very willingly, Lady Devonshire's youngest boy, whom his nurse had brought wrapped up in a blanket. Lady Devonshire came towards morning and lay here, and had done so still, but for a <num value="2">second</num> ill accident. Her brother, Lord Arran, who has been ill of a fever <num value="12">twelve</num> days, was despaired of yesterday morning, and spots appeared; so she resolved to see him, and not her return hither, but to Somerset House, where the Queen offered her lodgings. He is said to be dead, and I hear this morning it is a great blow to the family; and that he was a most dutiful son and kind friend to all his family. Thus we see what a day brings forth! and how momentary the things we set our hearts upon! O! I could heartily cry out, When will longed--for eternity come! but our duty is to possess our souls with patience.&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend=italics>See</hi> LONDINA ILLUSTRATA, <hi rend=italics>Article, Montagu House.</hi>

<P>This mansion, considered for nearly <num value="2">two</num> centuries as the last habitable house in Westminster, was erected by John Mordaunt, <num value="1">first</num> Earl of Peterborough, who was advanced to that dignity by Letters Patent, <datestruct VALUE="1628-03-9"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=9>9</day>, <year reg=1628>1628</year></datestruct>, <num value="3">3</num> Cha. I. He was brought up (as were most of his family) in the Romish religion, but was converted by a disputation at his house between the learned Bishop Usher and a papist; the latter confessing himself silenced by the just hand of God on him, for presuming, without leave of his superiors, to dispute with the Bishop, who was then only Dr. Usher. 
<P>The Mordaunt family were previous to this time bigoted Catholics, and Henry, Lord Mordaunt, in the <num value="4">fourth</num> of King James the <num value="1">First</num>, being suspected to have knowledge of the gunpowder treason plot, was, with Edward, Lord Stourton, and the Earl of Northumberland, committed to the Tower, where, after some imprisonment, he and Lord Stourton being fined in the Star Chamber, <datestruct VALUE="1606-06-3"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=3>3</day>, <year reg=1606>1606</year></datestruct>, were released; but the Earl of Northumberland continued a prisoner for <num value="15">fifteen</num> years after. This Lord Mordaunt had to wife Margaret, daughter of Henry, Lord Compton, by whom he had issue John, who succeeded him; and became the founder of this house. 
<P>Peterborough House was situate on Millbank, which took its name from a windmill, on the site of which this house was built. Millbank was a very long place; it began by Lindsey House, or rather by the Old Palace Yard, and ran up to Peterborough House, which was the furthest house on the bank. The part from against College Street unto the Horse Ferry, had a good row of buildings on the East side next the Thames, which was mostly taken up with woodmongers' yards and brewhouses; and here was a water-house, which served this end of the town. The north side was but ordinary, except <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> houses by the end of College Street; and that part beyond the Horse Ferry had a very good row of houses, much inhabited by gentry, on account of the pleasant situation and prospect of the Thames. Peterborough House had a court yard before it, fronting the river, and a fine garden behind it; but its situation was extremely bleak and exposed in the winter, and not over healthful, being so near the low meadows on the south and west parts. 
<P>This house continued the property of the Peterborough family, until the demise of Charles Mordaunt, the <num value="3">third</num> Earl, which took place at Lisbon, <datestruct VALUE="1735-10-25"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=25>25</day>, <year reg=1735>1735</year></datestruct>. It then passed by purchase to Alexander Davis of Ebury, in the county of Middlesex, esquire, whose sole daughter and heiress, Mary, marrying Sir Thomas Grosvenor, bart., in <datestruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>, became mother of the late Sir Robert Grosvenor, who inherited this house, and all the rest of his vast property about London, in right of his said mother. It has been erroneously stated, that this house was erected by Alexander Davis, in <datestruct value="1660--"><year reg="1660">1660</year></datestruct>; but Mr. Pennant informs us, that here, in his boyish days, he had often experienced the hospitality of Sir Robert Grosvenor, and that this house came by purchase of <num value="1">one</num> of his family (doubtless his maternal grandfather) from the Mordaunts, Earls of Peterborough. And in Hollar's <num value="4">four</num>-sheet view of London and Westminster, published in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, this edifice is clearly made out, with the name of Peterborough House under it; a distinction not very likely to be given, had the Earl of Peterborough only been tenant to the Davis family, and not the ostensible proprietor himself. 
<P>The last Earl of Peterborough that resided here, was a strange compound of courage, gallantry, and stratagem. On leaving the naval service, he charmed a listening senate with his oratory. Disgusted with James the <num value="2">Second</num>'s government, he went to command part of the Dutch fleet, and came back, with William III., to his native land; became a military officer, and greatly distinguished himself under Queen Anne, for whom he fought and conquered. This quarter of the globe seemed to him too confined for his pastimes. He asked a commission, as captain-general of our forces in North America; but his enemy and rival Marlborough prevented his gaining it. Under George I and II, he became a conspicuous Whig; and was continued by those monarchs Lord Lieutenant of Northamptonshire, and made general of the marine forces of Great Britain; but in these reigns he employed his time more as a wit than a politician. He was the correspondent of Pope and Swift, and gifted in all that learning and genius could bestow; yet he delighted to hear himself declaim in a coffee-house, where the stupid stare of astonishment was all his reward; but they who blamed could not help admiring him: even the cynic Swift remarks, that, &ldquo;though his Lordship was at least <num value="60">sixty</num>, he had more spirits than any young fellow he knew in England;&rdquo; and adds, &ldquo;I love the hang-dog dearly.&rdquo; 
<P>The Earls of Peterborough had another house, noticed by Maitland, as situate in Little Britain, anciently called Britain Street, from the city mansion of the Duke of Bretagne, near to the church of St. Botolph, Aldersgate. This <num value="2">second</num> Peterborough house is styled by the above writer, a palace, and stated to have graced the south-west corner of Little Britain, on the spot where the south part of St. Bartholomew Hospital now stands. 
<P>It appears by no means a modern practice for our nobility and gentry occasionally to let out their town as well as country-houses. In Hatton's New View of I ondon, printed in the year <datestruct value="1708"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, Peterborough House, Millbank, is noticed then as in the possession of Mr Bull, a merchant: at this period the Earl of Peterborough was serving his country in Spain, and in the year <datestruct value="1710"><year reg="1710">1710</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1711--"><year reg="1711">1711</year></datestruct> was employed on an embassy to Turin, and other Italian courts; these engagements rendered an expensive establishment at home to him quite unnecessary. 
<P>The present Earl Grosvenor's grandfather resided in this house till <datestruct value="1755"><year reg="1755">1755</year></datestruct>; and it was afterwards inhabited by Lord Delaval and Mr. Symmons. His Lordship then had it in his own occupation, and occasionally lived in it for nearly <num value="20">twenty</num> years, until <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, when it was taken down, to facilitate the great improvements that have since been made in this neighbourhood. 
<P>This part of the estate of Earl Grosvenor, containing about <num value="7">seven</num> acres, is bounded on the east by the river Thames, south by the estate, late the Marquis of Salisbury's, now in the hands of government; west by the estate of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, called Tothil Fields, now let on building leases; and north by the Horseferry Road, leading from the fields to the ferry to Lambeth. It is now (<datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>) leased to Mr. John Johnson, who is considerably improving this quarter of the metropolis, by forming new streets, &amp;c. <pb id="p.173" n="173">

<P>The site on which Craven House stood, was occupied previously by a mansion erected by Sir William Drury, a great commander in the Irish wars, but who unfortunately lost his life in a duel with Sir John Boroughs, in a quarrel about precedency. Sir Robert Drury, his son, succeeded him in the possession of the house, and was a distinguished patron of the celebrated Dr. Donne, who had apartments assigned to him here. During the time of the discontent and troubles of the favourite Essex, Drury House was the place where Sir Robert held frequent councils with his imprudent advisers, which terminated with confusion on his adherents, and the loss of his own head. 
<P>Whose possession it came into immediately after the Drurys does not appear; but soon after the restoration, the old house being taken down, it was rebuilt from the ground by the gallant William, Earl Craven, from whom it was ever after called Craven House, the name of Drury only being remembered in that of the lane, in which this house until of late years stood. 
<P>Earl Craven was descended from a family anciently seated at Appletreewick, in Craven, in the county of York. His ancestor John Craven, who lived in the reigns of Henry VII and VIII, had <num value="3">three</num> sons; Henry, William, and Anthony. The <num value="2">second</num> son, William Craven, by Beatrix his wife, daughter of John Hunter, was the father of Sir William Craven, knight, sheriff of London, in the <num value="42">42nd</num> year of Queen Elizabeth, and lord mayor in the year <datestruct value="1611"><year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct>; he died in <datestruct VALUE="1618-07-18"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=18>18</day>, <year reg=1618>1618</year></datestruct>, and was buried in the Church of St. Andrew Undershaft, Leadenhall Street, without any monument to his memory. He married Elizabeth, daughter of William Whitmore, Esq. of London, and left issue <num value="3">three</num> sons and <num value="2">two</num> daughters, viz. William, his son and heir; John, who was held in such esteem by Charles I, that by Letters Patent, bearing date at Oxford in the <num value="18">18th</num> year of his reign, he was advanced to the dignity of a baron of the realm, by the title of Lord Craven of Ryton, in the county of Salop; he married Elizabeth, daughter of William, Lord Spencer, but died without issue; and Thomas, the <num value="3">third</num> son, died unmarried. The <num value="2">two</num> daughters were, Mary, married to Thomas, Lord Coventry; and Elizabeth, to Percy Herbert, Lord Powis, father of William, Earl of Powis. 
<P>William Craven, the eldest son of the knight, was much affected with military exercises from his youth, and signalized himself in Germany and the Netherlands, under Henry, Prince of Orange; in which valiant adventures he gained such honour, that, on his return, he was <num value="1">first</num> knighted at Newmarket, <datestruct VALUE="1626-03-4"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=4>4</day>, <year reg=1626>1626</year></datestruct>, and in the same month raised to the dignity of a baron of the realm, by the title of Lord Craven, of Hamstead Marshal, in the county of Berks, <datestruct VALUE="-03-12"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=12>12</day></datestruct>, <num value="2">2</num> Cha. <num value="1">1</num>; with remainder, for want of issue male of his own body, to John Craven and Thomas Craven his brothers successively, and the heirs male of their bodies. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1631--"><year reg="1631">1631</year></datestruct>, he was <num value="1">one</num> of the commanders of those forces sent to the assistance of that great hero Gustavus, King of Sweden, then in arms in Germany, for the defence of the Protestants; and when that monarch, with the King of Bohemia, marched against Creutznach, the English volunteers, by their bravery in <num value="3">three</num> assaults, obliged the garrison to surrender; and the capitulation was signed by William Lord Craven, and Colonel Boulin, Quarter-master General of the King of Sweden's army. Lord Craven was wounded in the assaults, and, on his coming into the King of Sweden's presence, was told by him, he adventured so desperately, he bid his younger brother fair play for his estate. 
<P>He afterward went to the assistance of the Elector Palatine, who having besieged Limoges, in the year <datestruct value="1637"><year reg="1637">1637</year></datestruct>, a battle ensued, in which the emperor's army being victorious, the Elector with difficulty escaped by flight, but his brother, Prince Rupert, and Lord Craven, were taken prisoners. As soon as his lordship obtained his liberty, he went into the service of the States of Holland, under the Prince of Orange; and here he resided without coming to England for above <num value="20">twenty</num> years, till the restoration of Charles II. 
<P>Though Lord Craven did not personally serve Charles I, against his rebellious subjects, yet he manifested his loyalty by sending him considerable supplies; as also to Charles II, in his greatest necessities, as the King himself acknowledged after his restoration, when by his Letters Patent bearing date <datestruct VALUE="-03-6"><month reg="03">Mar.</month> <day reg=6>6</day></datestruct>, <num value="16">16</num> Cha. II, he advanced him to the titles of Viscount Craven, of Uffington, in the county of Berks, and Earl Craven, of Craven, in the county of York. 
<P>And by reason that both his brothers were then dead without issue, the title of Lord Craven of Hamstead Marshal was then limited, for want of male issue of his own body lawfully begotten, to Sir William Craven, of Leuchwike, in the county of Worcester, knight, and to the heirs male of his body; and for default of such issue, to Sir Anthony Craven, knight, brother to the same Sir William, and to the issue male of his body. 
<P>How great a sufferer Lord Craven was for his adherence to Charles II, is evident from a printed case in those times, setting forth the injustice done by the Parliament of England, in confiscating his estate. By which it appears, that in the year <datestruct value="1650"><year reg="1650">1650</year></datestruct>, <num value="1">one</num> Falconer deposed, that Lord Craven did promote a petition, in which several persons &ldquo;did desire to be entertained to serve the King of Scots against the Parliament of England, by the name of barbarous and inhuman rebels.&rdquo; And Col.

That the said Lord Craven, during the said treaty, did twice go to Rotterdam and Dunhagh, and back again, being employed as was commonly reported at court there, by the said King. That the said Lord Craven had a charge from the King to look to <num value="1">one</num> Mrs. Barlow, who, (as is reported and he believes to be true) had a child by the King of Scots, born at Rotterdam, which he did; and after the King was gone for Scotland, the said Lord Craven, took the child from her; for which she went to law with him, and recovered the child back again as is reported.&rdquo; Also Capt. Thomas Kitchingman deposed, <datestruct VALUE="1650-02-20"><month reg="02">Feb.</month> <day reg=20>20</day>, <year reg=1650>1650</year></datestruct>, &ldquo;That this informant, in April and <datestruct VALUE="1649-05--"><month reg="05">May</month> <year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct>, saw Lord Craven several times with the King of Scots at Breda, and waiting upon the said King several times at his table at Breda. This informant also saw the Earl of Oxford at the same time with the King of Scots at Breda, waiting upon the said King at his table; and saw Lord Craven, and the Earl of Oxford, many times go into the withdrawing-rooms after the said King. This informant also saw Lord Craven and the Earl of Oxford, in the Bowling Alley in Breda Castle, with the said King.&rdquo; 
<P>Whereupon, <datestruct VALUE="1650-03-16"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=16>16</day>, <year reg=1650>1650</year></datestruct>, it was resolved by the Parliament, that Lord Craven is an offender against the Commonwealth of England, within the declaration of the <datestruct VALUE="1649-08-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month> <year reg="1649">1649</year></datestruct>, entitled, A Declaration of the Commons assembled in Parliament, declaring all persons who have served the Parliament of England in Ireland, and have betrayed their trust, or have or shall adhere to, or assist, Charles Stewart, son to the late King, to be traytors and rebels. 
<P>Resolved, by the Parliament, that the estate of Lord Craven be confiscated accordingly. 
<P>Resolved, that the commissioners for compounding be empowered and required to seize and sequester all the estate, real and personal, of the said Lord Craven, and to receive the rents, issues, and profits thereof, to the use of the Commonwealth. 
<P>Accordingly his personal estate throughout all England (which was of no small value) was seized upon as confiscate, and sold, and much of it bought by members of that Parliament, who condemned him unheard, and who probably had then in their eye the parchase of his estate; for some of them, ever after that vote of confiscation, violently pressed on the sale of his estate, procuring an act for it, which passed <datestruct VALUE="1652-08-3"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=3>3</day>, <year reg=1652>1652</year></datestruct>, and bought large portions thereof at easy pennyworths. 
<P>The Elector Palatine and the States General interceded with the Parliament to rescind their act for the confiscation of these estates; but all the interest Lord Craven could make, and the precedents and witnesses produced by his council, could not bring the Parliament to reverse their judgment; whereby he was kept out of his estate till the restoration of Charles II, when he claimed and recovered the whole. It was offered to the Parliament to prove Falconer's perjury; but on their refusal to be judges thereof, he was afterward convicted for it in the Court of Upper Bench (as it was then called) when it <pb id="p.174" n="174"> was proved by <num value="3">three</num> witnesses, who read and signed the petition he swore to, and that there were no such words in it as &ldquo;barbarous and inhuman rebels,&rdquo; though Falconer himself often pressed those words might be put in, having without doubt his design on Lord Craven; and the original draught of that petition was produced in court, all of Falconer's handwriting, which he could not deny, wherein there was not the least mention of those words. Yet, on his single testimony, Lord Craven lost his estate; for what Reyly and Kitchingman deposed, carried not treason, or cause of confiscation, along with it. However, these proceedings and sale of Lord Craven's estate never passed with the clear judgment of the Parliament, but met with great and high opposition, dividing <num value="4">four</num> times; when, on the <num value="1">first</num> it was carried only by a single vote, the <num value="2">second</num> by <num value="2">two</num>, the <num value="3">third</num> by <num value="3">three</num>, and the <num value="4">fourth</num> time by <num value="4">four</num> votes. And when the act for the sale of his estate was put to the question, on the division of the House, there were <num value="20">20</num> in the negative and only <num value="23">23</num> members in the affirmative, of whom <num value="9">nine</num> contracted for near <measure value="5000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="5000">5000</num></measure> per annum of the estate, as appeared by the books of Drury House; beside what was bought in other men's names, for the use of the members of that parliament, and those who were of the former parliament, which voted the confiscation of his estate. 
<P>From the circumstance of these entries in the books concerning his lordship's estate, being denominated as the books of Drury House, it is most likely the Drury estate came into his possession on the death of Sir Robert Drury, the only son of the builder of Drury House, Sir William; of the descendants of whom in the female line, the particulars were recorded on a monument that was preserved in the old Church of St. James Clerkenwell, until its demolition.<NOTE N="*"><P>On its site the present church was erected, and consecrated by Beilby Porteus, Bishop of London, <datestruct VALUE="1792-07-10"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=10>10</day>, <year reg=1792>1792</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> It stood at the east end of the south aisle, and was a very curious black and white marble tomb with arms, mantling, and coronet carved, and the following inscription: Here lyeth interred Elizabeth, Countess Dowager of Exeter, daughter of Sir William Drury, of Hamstead in the county of Suffolk, knight, and coheir with Sir Robert Drury, her brother. She was married to William Cecil, knight of the noble order of the garter, Lord Burleigh, Earl of Exeter, son of Thomas, Lord Burleigh, Earl of Exeter, and grandchild of the illustrious William, Lord Burleigh, lord treasurer to Queen Elizabeth. By the said Earl she had <num value="3">three</num> daughter, and co-heirs: Elizabeth married to Thomas Howard, Viscount Andover, Earl of Berkshire; Dinah, married <num value="1">first</num> to Henry, Lord Vere, Earl of Oxenford, and after his death to Thomas, Lord Bruce, Baron of Wharlton, Earl of Eglyn; Ann, married to Henry, Lord Gray, of Grooby, Earl of Stamford. She died at her house called St. John's, the <datestruct VALUE="1653-02-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> day of <month reg="02">February</month> <year reg="1653">1653</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="80">80</num> years; leaving behind her an example for piety, wisdom, bounty, charity, and all goodness, fit for imitation of all ladies of honour and virtue. And close by this tomb was a painted table, setting forth that this lady was honoured and beloved by all for her hospitality and charity to the poor, was free from pride, left great legacies to her servants (to some annually for life,) was grandmother to <num value="32">32</num> children, and great grandmother to <num value="33">33</num>. 
<P>To return to Lord Craven.&mdash;King Charles, on his restoration, taking into consideration his great losses in his service, created him an Earl as before mentioned, and constituted him colonel of the regiment of foot guards, called the Coldstream regiment. He was likewise of his privy council, lord lieutenant of the county of Middlesex and of the borough of Southwark, custos rotulorum of Berkshire, <num value="1">one</num> of the governors of the Charter House, and <num value="1">one</num> of the lords proprietors of the province of Carolina in North America. 
<P>Earl Craven continued in the esteem of King Charles the <num value="2">Second</num>, during the whole course of his reign; and Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia (to whom he was privately married, and built for her the fine seat at Hamstead Marshal, in the county of Berks, which was afterward destroyed by fire) died in Craven House, <datestruct VALUE="1661-02-13"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=13>13</day>, <year reg=1661>1661</year></datestruct>. 
<P>Earl Craven, in his younger days, was <num value="1">one</num> of the most accomplished gentlemen in Europe; charitable, abstemious as to himself, generous to others, familiar in his conversation, and universally beloved. He continued in London during the whole time of the great plague, in <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>, braving the fury of the pestilence, with the same intrepid coolness as when fighting the battles of his beloved mistress, the Queen of Bohemia, or when mounting the tremendous breach at Creutznach. He was indeed, what he was generally termed, the intrepid soldier, the gallant lover, and the genuine patriot. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>, Lord Craven purchased a piece of waste ground for the purpose of erecting a pest-house, which consisted of <num value="36">36</num> small tenements, for the reception of those affected by the plague. The site of this was called the Pest-house Field; it became surrounded with buildings soon after the revolution in <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>, but long remained a dirty waste till Carnaby Market occupied much of the west part. But Carnaby Market is now (<datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>) no more; every shop, stall, and shamble being pulled down for the purpose of carrying into effect the wonderful improvement of building in this quarter of the metropolis. The Pest-house Field where those who died of the infection were interred, extended in length from Silver Street to Great Marlborough Street, and in breadth from Carnaby Street to Marshal Street. The circumstance of the property of the ground being vested in the Craven family, is still commemorated on the front of a house in Marshal Street, called the Craven Brewhouse. At the lower end of Marshal Street was a common cemetery, where some hundreds of bodies were buried in that calamitous year. 
<P>In <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, he, in conjunction with George Monk, Duke of Albemarle, came forth to render their assistance during the raging of the dreadful fire of London; and took every means to alleviate the calamity, and to prevent its progress: here their valour was put to the test; but amid the horrors of death and destruction, they both behaved with the same coolness, as when they were supported by the glory of victory, amid the thunder of artillery and flights of bullets, in the field of battle. 
<P>When King James came to the throne, Earl Craven attended his coronation, and for some time was in his favour, and sworn of the privy council; but at length having intimation, that the King would be pleased with the resignation of his commission, he said, If they took away his regiment, they had as good take away his life, since he had nothing else to divert himself with. 
<P>The bigoted James, when the Prince of Orange approached in force near to the capital, sent him a most necessitated invitation to take up his lodgings at Whitehall. The prince accepted it; but at the same time hinted to the frightened monarch he must leave that palace. It was then customary to mount guard both at St. James' and Whitehall: the old hero, Lord Craven, was on duty at the latter place, at the time when the Dutch guards were marching through the park to relieve, by order of their master&mdash;from a point of honour he had determined not to quit his station, and was preparing to maintain his post; but receiving the command of his sovereign, he reluctantly withdrew his party, and marched away with sullen dignity. 
<P>On King William's accession to the crown, the Earl being very aged, his regiment was given to General Talmash, and the Earl of Clare was constituted lord lieutenant of the county of Middlesex. But Earl Craven to the time of his death, <datestruct VALUE="1697-04-19"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=19>19</day>, <year reg=1697>1697</year></datestruct>, was ever ready to serve the public, and particularly famous for giving directions in extinguishing fires in the city of London and suburbs; of which he had so early intelligence, and was so ready to mount on horseback, and assist with his presence, that it became a common saying, His horse smelt a fire as soon as it happened.<NOTE N="*"><P>At the end of Craven Buildings was a good picture of this noble hero, in armour, brandishing a trunch on, and mounted on his white horse. It 
was painted on plaster, and <num value="20">twenty</num> years ago in tolerable preservation; but, from decay, or rather actual destruction, there is now (<datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>) scarcely a trace of colouring to be seen.</NOTE>

<P>On the decease of William, Earl Craven, without issue, the title and estates descended to the heirs of Sir Thomas Craven, as was limited <num value="17">17</num> Cha. II. and from whom the present noble proprietor is lineally descended 
<P>The Craven estate in Drury Lane and its neighbourhood form but a small portion of the family property, which lies in distant places. A few houses in Drury Lane, Newcastle Street, and Wych Street, including the Olympic Theatre, and the whole of Craven Buildings, comprise the total of his lordship's rental in this quarter. Of that part of the premises known by the sign of the Queen of Bohemia's Head, <num value="1">one</num> of the last uses of its capacious dining-room was the meeting-place of a society called the Sols, <num value="2">second</num> in estimation only to that of the Freemasons, which society was dissolved immediately after the house was taken down. <pb id="p.175" n="175">

<p><figure id="fig.1.174.1" n="2000.65.0106"><head>A North West View of the House of William Parker Lord Monteagle.</head></figure>
<P>There existed for a considerable time in this part of London, numerous remains of ancient buildings which, from their decorations, were evidently above the ordinary class of dwellings, and were generally considered to have been the residences of superior persons; whilst the well-known mansions of the Bishop of Winchester, the Abbot of Battle, the Prior of Lewes, Lord Montague, &amp;c., which also stood here, appear to confirm the conjecture concerning those whose possessors were unknown. On the eastern side of the Borough High-street, in particular, were some houses apparently of the architecture of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, with fronts richly ornamented, on <num value="1">one</num> of which was a defaced shield of arms and crest, and beneath a castle with sentinels and other decorations.<NOTE N="*"><P>These houses last formed No. <num value="19">19</num>, High-Street, Borough, and were taken down in the autumn of <datestruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, for making the south approach to the New London Bridge; but several representations of them have been engraven.</NOTE> The building represented in the annexed Engraving was also evidently a house of some importance at <num value="1">one</num> period, but of very considerably less antiquity than the former: and, though it had probably undergone many alterations, was certainly not even of the age of King James I., to which common tradition assigned it, by connecting it with Lord Monteagle, and the Gunpowder Plot. The exact site of it may be traced in the Plan of St. Saviour's Church and the vicinity, engraven beneath the View of the Gateway of St. Mary's Priory, Southwark, contained in the <num value="1">First</num> Volume of this work; this building forming the north-eastern side of Montague Close, which was taken down about <datestruct VALUE="1830-10--"><month reg="10">October</month> <year reg="1830">1830</year></datestruct>, for the improvement of the spot, and the approaches to the New London Bridge. The mansion consisted of a large irregular brick edifice, with <num value="2">two</num> projecting wings, and a narrow centre containing a tall door-way, surmounted by a very deep compass-pediment enclosing a carved shell; the approach to the entrance being by a series of semi-circular stone steps. The whole of the building was lighted by transom-casement windows, with dormer-attics in the roof, some of which were hidden by the modern parapet on the south. Within the apartments were large and lofty, and long retained the remains of rich mouldings, with very spacious fire-places. Many years previous to its destruction, the whole building was parted into numerous tenements, and the principal part fell into irreparable decay; though in <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct> the back still remained in a more perfect state than the front, the roof being complete for the entire width of the structure represented in the Plate. At that time the vacant ground behind was of more than double the width of the space shewn in front, as may be seen in the Plan referred to; and was occupied as a stonevard by a builder, who also engaged the lower part of the mansion itself as workshops, in <datestruct VALUE="1828-10--"><month reg="10">October</month> <year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>. The steps had been then taken away from the entrance, and the door itself was replaced by common boards nailed together; the small recess in front between the wings was shored-up, so as completely to conceal the entrance; and the general dilapidation of the whole edifice prevented it from having even a distant resemblance to the place represented in the View.&mdash;Such was the last appearance of the Mansion, which ordinary tradition has asserted to have been the residence of William Parker, Lord Monteagle, son and heir of Edward, Lord Morley; at which was delivered the celebrated anonymous letter which led to the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot. Without entering in any degree into the wellknown history of that atrocious conspiracy, it appears to be a proper illustration of the present subject, to add some historical notices shewing the probable origin of this traditional error, and that the letter itself was altogether unconnected with this place.

<P>The street in which the delivery of this epistle took place is not named in the above official narrative, though it entirely contradicts the tradition that the notice was left at Monteagle House. This deficiency, however, is supplied by the account contained in Edmond Howes' edition of Stow's <hi rend=italics>Chronicle</hi>, which states that &ldquo;about <num value="10">ten</num> days before the Parliament should begin, the Lord Mounteagle, son and heire to the Lord Morley,

It is there stated, that Lord Monteagle had &ldquo;ordered a supper to be prepared, <hi rend=italics>not at his residence in town, but at a house belonging to him at a short distance from London:</hi> a circumstance so unusual that it excited much surprise in his family. Whilst he sat at table, a letter was delivered to him by <num value="1">one</num> of his pages, who had received it from a tall man, whose features he did not recognise in the dark. Monteagle opened the letter, and seeing that it was without date or signature, and written in a very disguised hand, ordered a gentleman in his service to read it aloud.&mdash;The following day the individual who had been requested to read the letter called on Thomas Winter, <num value="1">one</num> of the conspirators. He related to him the occurrences of the preceding evening; added that his lord had laid the mysterious paper before the Secretary of State; and ended by conjuring him if he were a party to the supposed plot, to provide for his safety by immediate flight.&rdquo; Winter endeavoured to dissemble, and treat the matter as a delusion on the credulity of Lord Monteagle; but took the <num value="1">first</num> opportunity of leaving his house unobserved, and of giving the alarm to Catesby at White-Webbs, near Enfield Chase. 
<P>From the tenor of these narratives, Dr. Lingard considers it to have been the belief of the conspirators themselves, that the letter to Lord Monteagle was in reality written by Francis Tresham, <num value="1">one</num> of the last members received into the plot. They appear to have attributed it to him from a suspicion that there was a secret understanding between him and Lord Monteagle, or at least between him and the gentleman employed to read the letter: because Tresham had repented of engaging in the design, and endeavoured to persuade the conspirators to abandon it and return to Flanders; and also because he had contrived to give them information that the letter had been given to the Secretary of State, in the hope of inducing them to seize the opportunity of escaping. In this he would undoubtedly have been successful, had he not been defeated by the superior policy of Cecil, who would not allow the cellar beneath the Parliament-House to be searched. From that moment Tresham avoided all participation in their counsels, and when they fled, he still remained in London and shewed himself openly; but he was afterwards accused in the confession of some of the prisoners, and died in the Tower before the end of November.&rdquo;<NOTE N="*"><P>Lingard's 
<hi rend=italics>History of England</hi>, Vol. vi. p. <num value="50">50</num> note. It appears that many of the conspirators were maintained by the resources of Catesby, and when they were exhausted, for raising a farther supply, it was proposed to receive into the plot <num value="2">two</num> other Catholic gentlemen, Sir Everard Digby, of Drystoke in the County of Rutland, Knight; and Francis Tresham, of Rushton, in the County of Northampton, Esq. Between the <num value="14">14th</num> and <datestruct VALUE="-10-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct>, Catesby and Fawkes had gone to White-Webbs, a house near Enfield Chase, and whilst the former was conversing with Winter he received an unexpected visit from Tresham, who appeared very much embarrassed. He was then particularly anxious that notice of his danger should be given to Lord Monteagle, who had married his sister: and after stating that he should require farther time to raise money by sales, suggested that the destruction would take place with as much effect at the close, as at the meeting, of Parliament; recommending also that the conspirators should make use of his vessel then lying in the Thames, and spend the interval in Flanders. The confession of this conspirator declared, &ldquo;this was the only way I could resolve on to overthrow the act, to save their lives, and to preserve my own fortunes, lyffe, and reputation.&rdquo;&mdash;<hi rend=italics>Ibid.</hi> pp. <num value="48">48</num>, <num value="49">49</num>, note. Beside the above arguments in favour of the anonymous letter having been written by Tresham, it should be observed, that in the answer to Sir Anthony Weldon's Court of King James, by Godfrey Goodman, Bishop of Gloucester, it is positively stated that Tresham sent the letter. <hi rend=italics>Somers Tracts</hi>, Edit. by Sir Walter Scott, Lond. <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, <num value="4">4</num>to.

This conjecture appears also to receive some support from a passage in the examination of Fawkes, Winter, Rookwood, and Keyes, before the Privy-Council, <datestruct VALUE="1605-11-30"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=30>30th</day>, <year reg=1605>1605</year></datestruct>, which states that the conspirators wished that certain of the nobility should be preserved, that is to say, the Lord Viscount Montague, the Lord Stourton, and others: and <hi rend=italics>Percy named</hi> the Earl of Northum berland and <hi rend=italics>the Lord Monteagle:</hi> It was agreed between them that the <hi rend=italics>noblemen should be warned.</hi> The other, and more general, supposition is, that the letter was written by Mary, the eldest sister of Lord Monteagle, then wife of Thomas Abingdon, or Habington, of Hinlip, in the County of Worcester, Esq. who was a rigid Romanist, and after the discovery of the conspiracy was condemned to die for concealing the Jesuits Garnet and Oldcorn, in his house contrary to the Proclamation: his life was saved, however, by the intercession of his wife and Lord Monteagle.<NOTE N="*"><P><hi rend=italics>The History and Antiquities of the City and Suburbs of Worcester</hi>, by Valentine Green.

The arguments adduced in proof of this conclusion are, the well-known close connection between the <num value="2">two</num> families; the suspicion attaching to Mrs. Vaux, who was at <num value="1">first</num> committed to the Tower as a supposed conspirator; and the handwriting of a letter dated <datestruct VALUE="1605-05-12"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=12>12th</day>, <year reg=1605>1605</year></datestruct>, preserved in the State-Paper Office, which bears such an exact resemblance to the very peculiar character of the notice sent to Lord Monteagle, that it is impossible to compare them together without observing their identity. It is supposed, however, that Mrs. Habington may still be regarded as the original cause that the letter was sent.

<P>Beside the tradition concerning Monteagle House being in Montague Close, there is another that in consequence of its being the residence of the discoverer of the plot it was endowed with certain privileges.

<P>Nearly opposite Bangor Court, on the eastern side of Shoe Lane, stood an edifice commonly called the Palace of OLDBOURNE HALL, some vestiges of which form the subjects of the annexed Engravings.

an elegant ceiling, though less rich than the former, and some of the anti-rooms at the back are decorated in a similar manner. The great chamber only, however, is ornamented with any heraldical devices, but from the continual introduction of the pomegranate, in the compartment of all the ceilings, it may perhaps be considered probable that Oldbourne Hall was <num value="1">one</num> of the buildings assigned for the lodgings of the Spanish Ambassador, the C&oacute;nde Gondemar, who arrived in England in <datestruct VALUE="1619-03--"><month reg="03">March</month> <year reg="1619">1619</year></datestruct>, and had &ldquo;the Bishop of Ely's house in Holborn taken up for him, with an example,&rdquo; says Sir John Finett, &ldquo;not unmurmured at.&rdquo;<NOTE N="a"><P><hi rend=italics>Finetti Phil<*>xensis: or some choire observations of Sir John Finette, Knt. and Master of the Ceremonies to the last <num value="2">two</num> Kings, touching the Reception and Precedency, the Treatment and Audience, the Puntillos and Contests, of Forren Ambassadors in England.</hi> Lond. <datestruct value="1656--"><year reg="1656">1656</year></datestruct>, <num value="8">8</num>vo. p. <num value="62">62</num>.

The building itself, however, must have been considerably more ancient than the above date, since Stow, in even the <hi rend=italics><num value="1">first</num></hi> edition of his <hi rend=italics>Survey of London</hi>, published in <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>, page <num value="316">316</num>, says, &ldquo;In this Shooe-lane on the left hande is <num value="1">one</num> olde house called Oldbourne-hall; is <hi rend=italics>now</hi> letten out into diuers tenementes.&rdquo; To this description, it is rather remarkable that none of the subsequent editions of his work add any farther information; and in the absence, therefore, of any other historical materials, the present notices can comprise only some particulars of the modern appearance of this structure, furnished in <datestruct VALUE="1824-06--"><month reg="06">June</month> <year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>, by Mr. William Pontifex, Sen. its present possessor, to Mr. Wilkinson, the original proprietor of the Londina Illustrata, when the drawings were taken for the present Engravings. 
<P>The old Mansion-house called Holborn Hall, says this description, in the year <datestruct value="1782"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct> contained <num value="23">twenty-three</num> rooms, some being of large dimensions; at that time let to different persons in separate tenements. The whole of them had oaken floors, joisted doors, and oaken panelling all round the larger apartments; the ceiling of the principal of which, formerly used by Mr. Pontifex as a ware-room, has been already mentioned. The old entrance into the coppersmiths' shop, as shown in the view of the front of the manufactory beneath the representation of the ceiling, was traditionally said to have been a carriage-way to the coach-house and stables; but this front, together with a part of the houses on each side, was of a comparatively late erection, and did not form any of the original ancient hall, the real site of which appears to have lain backward from the street surrounded by gardens. The whole of the ground originally occupied by the mansion and gardens was about <num value="4">four</num> acres, the modern boundaries of which are Merlin's Rents on the north, and Eagle and Child Alley on the south; and its direction was straight downwards to the River Fleet, divided into <num value="2">two</num> parts by a line of old lime trees, removed by Mr. Pontifex in <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>. In the lease of the premises the south of this line is called &ldquo;the Great Garden,&rdquo; and on this part stood the remains of the ancient hall, containing apartments for the domestics, and coach-houses of various sizes. The north side of the line of trees was called &ldquo;the Pleasure Garden,&rdquo; upon which spot was erected Messrs. Pontifex's extensive brass and copper manufactory in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>; some of the premises had been, however, similarly employed for <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40">forty</num> years previous; and the <num value="1">first</num> occupant was a gunsmith who had resided on them <num value="60">sixty</num> years. On the south side of the line of trees, also, the greater part of the land was formed into a spacious burial ground for the poor of St. Andrew's Parish, containing about an acre and a quarter; at the western end was erected the workhouse, with <num value="2">two</num> dwellings; and at the eastern extremity, a number of houses formerly in Fleet Market, but at present constituting part of the western side of Farringdon Street. 
<P>The <num value="2">second</num> of the annexed Engravings represents the stately Fire-place and Mantle-piece also taken from the same state-apartment of Oldbourne Hall, carved in the richest style of the early part of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, and representing <num value="6">six</num> of the Labours of Hercules. The upper part is executed in oak, and is still sharp and perfect in all the panels and terminal figures: and the lower, or frame of the Fire-place, is carved in Portland stone. The old building containing these curious remains, is at this time, <datestruct VALUE="1833-12--"><month reg="12">December</month> <year reg="1833">1833</year></datestruct>, still in the state represented in the Plate, though the apartments of it are now employed only for the depositing of articles not in continual use; as Messrs. Pontifex and Co. removed into a very spacious manufactory erected on the site of the house on the right hand side of the view, in <datestruct VALUE="1831-11--"><month reg="11">November</month> <year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>. </TEXT></TEI.2>
