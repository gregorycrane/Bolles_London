 <head>To the  Members of the City of London
             Tradesmen's Club.</head>
 <p>Gentlemen,
<p>I dedicate this work to you. When I had the
pleasure during three weekly meetings to direct your attention
to the interesting and notable events connected  with "Our
Ward," and to the many eminent men who made it their abiding place, I little dreamed to arouse in you an enthusiastic
desire to possess some permanent record of my efforts to please
you. In obedience to your expressed wishes I place before you
this pamphlet, and trust the handsome spontaneous subscription you raised to defray the cost of publication will, whilst being
acknowledged by me, be more appreciably requited by your
finding the book full of agreeable mementoes of Farringdon
Without, and carefully selected reliable information.  To the
gentlemen at the Record Office, and to Mr. Overall, the City
Librarian, who placed valuable information within my reach
--to them and to you I offer heartfelt thanks.
                         <p>Believe me,
                             <lb>Faithfully yours,

  <div1 type="section" n="1"><head>              THE WARD OF
 FARRINGDON WITHOUT,</head>
 <p>TO the thoughtful mind, has always been preg        nant with intellect, and replete with  nota    bilities, even from the earliest times. We find
        in <date value="1698">1698</date>, Sir Francis Child, one of the first
bankers established in London, alderman of this ward,
and lord mayor of London: the ancestor of the Earls
of Westmoreland and the Earls of Jersey: two of his
sons: Sir Robert and Sir Francis Child followed in
his footsteps, both becoming aldermen, Sir Francis attaining the dignity of lord mayor in <date value="1731">1731</date>.  To them
succeeded Sir Richard Hoare as alderman, also a banker,
who was made mayor in <date value="1745">1745</date>; then came Alderman
Richard Beckford, who died before he reached the civic
chair. His son William Beckford wrote an Arabian tale
called "Vathek," at one sitting: a work Lord Byron pronounced, for correctness of costume, beauty of description,
<pb n="10" id="p.10">
and power of imagination, the most Eastern and sublime
tale ever written.  Alderman Sir F. Gosling succeeded
Beckford, in <date value="1756">1756</date>, but died before reaching the mayoralty;
he was followed by John Wilkes, who, elected alderman
<date value="1769">1769</date>, was lord mayor <date value="1774">1774</date>. Wilkes may be considered
the father of city liberty, and the upholder of city independence. To him succeeded Sir Charles Price, Bart., likewise a banker, mayor in <date value="1802">1802</date>; and he was followed by the
great and good Alderman Robert Waithman, lord mayor
in <date value="1823">1823</date>.  James Harmer was elected alderman in <date value="1833">1833</date>,
and it is sufficient to say he was the proprietor of the
"Weekly Dispatch," one of the oldest liberal newspapers in
England.  He did not reach the highest civic honours.
Sir James Duke, Bart., was mayor in <date value="1848">1848</date>; he has enjoyed
the aldermanic distinction since <date value="1840">1840</date>, having presided over
the ward during crises of great pith and moment, with
dignity all his own, and with suavity which has won for him
the respect and esteem of the whole ward, comprising nearly
one-fifth of the electors of the entire city.
<p>In the year <date value="1279">1279</date>, one William Farendon, or Farndone,
(liber Albus Faryngdone,) an opulent goldsmith, purchased
or leased of Edward I., through Ralph le Feore, the then
holder, the right to the aldermanry of this ward, thenceforth
called by his name, which the transition of language, natural
to the march of refinement and euphony, has merged into
Farringdon."  Farendon's lease ran eighty years, and
             <pb n="11" id="p.11">
during that period was enjoyed in fief by his descendants,who
paid annually, at Easter, in token of vassaldom, a gilly-flower, or July flower (garofolo, nut), then most rare.
<p>          "Sir, let us take a walk down Fleet Street,"
and from the nethermost western end we will perambulate
the ward together.
<p>                 Fleet Street,
Deriving its name from the river Fleet, has always been
renowned for exhibitions, out-door games, and processions.
Scarcely a century has passed since football was a pastime
publicly permitted in this great thoroughfare, and the cry of
" Bat," would at the same period bring a swarm of "prentices " to the rescue of a friend in trouble, or a stranger in
distress. Its coffee-houses and taverns have won for Fleet
Street world-wide celebrity; in some of them were congregated the immortality of intellect, leaving their " mots," not
for a generation but for all time. Ever a centre for booksellers, stationers, and printers, Fleet Street has been the
hotbed of genius and the nurse of thought. The houses were
badly built until the fire of London cleared away the rubbish
nearly to St. Dunstan's Church, north and south ; we still
have records of the reign of him who " never spared man in
his anger, nor woman in his lust," although it is doubtful
whether Henry VIII. ever lived in the gable-fronted over
<pb n="12" id="p.12">
hanging house which bears his name. Fleet Street was
badly paved until John Macadam, at the commencement
of the present century, revolutionized our road-making. It
is scarcely within the province of this brochure to detail
the animated scenes that oft took place in Fleet Street in
the olden times; those curious in such matters will find in
Sir Walter Scott's "Fortunes of Nigel" life-like word
painting and richly-dressed descriptions of this neighbourhood in <date value="1600">1600</date>. Thirty-four streets, lanes, and alleys run
into or out of Fleet Street, each and every one memorable
in its way: each and every one having been a pioneer on
the highway towards civilization. At No. 192, Fleet Street,
was born Abraham Cowley (B. <date value="1618">1618</date>, D. <date value="1667">1667</date>), whose father
kept a grocer's shop on these premises. The sublime, the
moral, and the witty Cowley, though educated at Westminster, matured his thoughts 'neath his father's roof.
After passing through various hands, these premises becamethe "King's Head" tavern, and Titus Oates here, in <date value="1680">1680</date>,
hatched his nefarious schemes, and with a "tongue" that
perjured and a perjured tongue revealed a pretended popish
plot that unjustly overwhelmed many innocent of crime.
Here, also, was held the "Green Ribbon Club," a society
almost analogous to the Fenians of our day. In <date value="1740">1740</date> they
were again opened as a grocer's, by North and Co., who
sold tea there at 16s. per lb., and this business is still
carried on.
             <pb n="13" id="p.13">
<p>At No. 17, nearly opposite, erroneously called the " palace
of Henry VIII. and Cardinal Wolsey," may be seen a very
fine specimen of wood carving on the frontage, though its
being gilt somewhat militates against its charming finish;
here was conducted, in <date value="1795">1795</date>, "Mrs. Salmon's moving
wax-work exhibition," that achieved European fame. Two
doors west of Chancery Lane, in Fleet Street, lived
Izakk Walton, the author of the "Complete Angler," a book
replete with all the charms of nature, and overflowing with
unaffected simplicity and adoration of divine perfection.
At 184 and 185 lived Michael Drayton, the author of the
Barons' Wars," and the " Poly-Albion," a description of
England, the former containing many passages of great
poetic beauty that Milton deigned to copy, the latter
overflowing with antiquarian, geographical, and historical
learning, and abounding in chaste imagery. At No. 134,
formerly the Globe tavern, long the house of the Robin
Hood Club, Oliver Goldsmith hob-nobbed with Charles
Macklin, who played Shylock in the " Merchant of Venice"
when he was one hundred years old; and to such perfection
did he bring the delineation, that Alexander Pope said
                   <lb>"This is the Jew
                   <lb>That Shakespeare drew."
Macklin was the author of an undying comedy, " The
Man of the World."   At No. 103, now the "Sunday
<pb n="14" id="p.14">
Times" office, lived Alderman Waithman, lord mayor of
London in <date value="1823">1823</date>, and so worthily did he fulfil his duties as
alderman and mayor, that the citizens of London elected
him six times their representative to parliament, and at his
death raised a monument to his memory near the house he
so long inhabited.
<p>In this year of grace, <date value="1869">1869</date>, we have No. 85, used as the
publishing office for " Punch, or the London Charivari," the
first satirical and humorous periodical established in England, and the best: containing more genuine Attic wit, and
having a larger scope of satirical humour, than any other
journal ever published. At 135, 136, and 137, is published
and printed " The Daily Telegraph," the most wonderful
modern newspaper: established about fifteen years only, it
has, by consistently advocating popular rights, vaulted into
the foremost rank of journalism, and acquired a circulation
equal to nearly all the other daily papers put together. No.
129 is "The Standard" office, the organ of Conservative
principles, which with great power disseminates its party's
opinions, and is rising to the highest pinnacle of newspaper
fame.
<p>The churches in Fleet Street are St. Dunstan's, an
Italianized gothic structure, with circular-headed windows;
the clock was formerly one of the wonders of London, it
overhung the pavement, and had two gilt life-size figures of
savages wielding clubs, with which they struck each quarter
             <pb n="15" id="p.15">
of an hour, and at the same time moved their heads.
Cowper refers to this:
          <lb>"When labour and when dulness, club in hand,
          <lb>Like the two figures at St. Dunstan's stand."
<p>St. Bride's, or St. Bridget's church, one of the most
charming creations emanating from Wren's genius, with its
graceful steeple, its fine stained-glass windows-a splendid
copy of Rubens' " Descent from the Cross," on the east
side, and its brilliant peal of twelve bells, make it a
favourite resort.  In this churchyard are buried Samuel
Richardson and Alderman Waithman, both ward celebrities.
<p>At the Portugal Hotel, Fleet Street, is held, weekly,
"The City of London Tradesmen's Club"-an institution
established some fifty years since for the purpose of discussing or debating the important political and social questions
of the day, and enabling its members, and the ratepayers
of the Ward of Farringdon Without, to ventilate their
opinions; affording opportunities to its representatives at
the Court of Common Council to express their views and
ascertain the feelings of their constituents.  This club,
formerly called "The Farringdon Club," was established at
the Ram Inn, Smithfield, and the notorious Galloway was a
member.   It then removed to Anderton's Hotel, and the
name was changed to the present title; subsequently it
held its meetings for some years at Salter's  Hotel, in the
<pb n="16" id="p.16">
valley at the bottom of Snow Hill, and remained there
until the premises were pulled down for the building of the
Viaduct. At the commencement of the year <date value="1869">1869</date>, it was
again removed near the scene of its early triumphs--its
present locale. It consists of seventy members--professional
and trading gentlemen, carrying on their avocations in the
City of London. The Alderman and Common Council representing the Ward of Farringdon Without have from
time immemorial been members of this club.
                  <div1 type="section" n="2"><head>Temple Bar</head>
<p>The most western boundary of the ward of Farringdon
Without, was built by Sir Christopher Wren, and is admirably adapted for the purpose for which it was intended; it
is constructed of Portland stone, of rustic work below, and
of the Corinthian order. In two niches over the gate on
the east side are statues of Queen Elizabeth and King
James I., the king's arms being placed over the key-stone.
The statues of King Charles I. and Charles II. adorn the
west side. On the iron spikes above the pediment were
formerly exhibited the heads and limbs of traitors, which
having been placed thereon, were left to blister in the sun.
The rooms above the gateway are now used by Messrs. Child,
the bankers, as a depository for their books.
<p>In olden time Temple Bar was what its name conveys
            <pb n="17" id="p.17">
"a bar," composed of posts, rails, and a chain, stretching
across the street, to prevent unsanctioned ingress or egress;
that gave place to a house of timber, removed at the great
fire of London, when, under the influence of Wren's reforming hand, the present building was reared to " reign in its
stead."
<div1 type="section" n=3><head>The Temple</head><p>
Was formerly the residence, containing the mansion and
grounds, of the Knight Templars, a body having its origin
as follows:  After the capture of Jerusalem by the Crusaders, in
<date value="1099">1099</date>, the zeal or fanaticism for pilgrimage to the holy
shrine, which, by reason of its difficult accomplishment
seemed to be invested with double attractions, burst with
its smothered intensity, and a fierce desire to visit the East
permeated Europe. The cruel and bloody Turcomans, who
had long been the scourge of the pilgrims, although expelled Jerusalem, had not been driven from Palestine; there maintaining vast strongholds and impregnable fortresses;
from whence they made frequent raids, attacking fiercely
the numerous bands of weary and peaceful pilgrims; plundering and murdering all who came within their power. To counteract these barbarities, to protect the saintly honour
of the holy virgins and matrons, and the grey hairs of the

<pb n="18" id="p.18">
devout Palmers, nine knights of noble lineage, of high
renown, formed themselves into a devoted band to do
battle with the infidels, and aid each other, and all
persons in distress. At first without fixed residence, they
wandered hither and thither in quest of adventure; and
it was not until <date value="1118">1118</date>, " the poor fellow-soldiers of
Jesus Christ," as they dubbed themselves, having acquired great renown for the services they rendered to
Christians and Christianity, that Baldwin, king of Jerusalem, invited them  to take up their residence in the
sacred precincts of the holy temple on Mount Moriah:
hence their name " Templars," or " Knights of the Temple
of Solomon."  About the year <date value="1128">1128</date>, one Hugh de Payens,
who for his extraordinary valour and severe piety was
elected "Master of the Templars," visited England to raise
money and followers to support their cause and join their
continental brethren in this Christian warfare. He was
well received by all classes, had grants of land and rich
presents given to him on behalf of the Templars, and he
enlisted many noble men and doughty knights under their
banner, fixing on, as their residence or inn, a magnificent
mansion on the south side of Holborn, just without " the
bars," and near where now stand Southampton Buildings.
Subsequently the order purchased considerable property in
land and houses, extending from the west of Whitefriars
to the east of Essex House, Essex Street, Strand, being
            <pb n="19" id="p.19">
bounded on the south by the river; and along this extended
frontage on the Thames they built their more than regal
palaces. In <date value="1185">1185</date> was erected and consecrated the beautiful
Temple Church, the most perfect memorial of their order
now in existence.
<p>King John was for some time a resident in the Temple,
where he took refuge against the coercion of his rebellious
subjects, and here the barons compelled him to negociate
the terms of Magna Charta; and it is somewhat doubtful
if he did not sign the copy of it during this residence. We
are told that Henry III. gave a sumptuous entertainment
to ambassadors from Castile in the great temple hall, and
the king especially ordered the Lord Mayor and sheriffs to
escort them thither. The Templars were disbanded about
the year <date value="1312">1312</date> by Pope Clement V., the chief cause of their
ruin being their unbounded wealth, which was triparted
amongst the pope, the king, and the order of the Knights
of St. John of Jerusalem, a rival body of military monks,
who lived at a mansion north of Smithfield, the entrance
being St. John's Gate, Clerkenwell. A portion of their
possessions, viz., the Temple proper, was claimed in 1315
by Thomas Earl of Lancaster, and the claim allowed by
Edward II. The Earl of Lancaster leased the premises to
a company of lawyers, who fixed their abode here; and
having once become housed, they managed to retain possession. The lawyers of the Temple were always famed

<pb n="20" id="p.20">
for plays, masques, and revels; they gave grand entertainments at Christmas, Halloween, Candlemas, and on Ascension Day; and these several periods were kept with great
splendour in their hall. Charles II. dined with them in
<date value="1661">1661</date>. At each of their fetes a play was performed, and
after the play barristers sang songs to the sergeants and
judges, who kept up the mirth and jollity of the scene by
dancing round the sea-coal fire. It would be a strange sight
in these times to see the grave and reverend lawyers tripping
it on "the light fantastic toe" in all the stately elegance of a
saraband or a minuet. One of the most remarkable entertainments given in the Temple was the Hunt, in which their
huntsman entered attired in green velvet and green satin,
dragging after him a cat, a fox, a purse net, and nine or ten
couple of hounds, the cat and fox being tied at the ends of
a staff to be hunted by the dogs amidst the blowing of
horns.
<p>Geoffrey Chaucer, the father of English poetry, was a
student in the Inner Temple, the author of "The Canterbury
Tales," a series of poems full of beauty and merit, displaying a knowledge of mankind that ranks with the highest
flight of human intellect. Born <date value="1328">1328</date>, died <date value="1400">1400</date>. Middle
Temple Lane was formerly a thoroughfare to the river
for conveyances, but the lawyers have shut the public
out, and claim the inheritance as their sole right. From
the Temple to Alsatia, or Sanctuary, seems but a step,
            <pb n="21" id="p.21">
and this was once a privileged place from arrest for debt
and small misdemeanours, and was inhabited by bullies,
desperadoes, broken tradesmen, extravagant spendthrifts,
affidavit men, or knights of the post, bully-cocks, and the
refuse of society, who, having infringed and thereby become
amenable to law, sought here a refuge from retributive
justice; and too frequently found it, until crime growing
daring in its enormity beyond endurance, Sanctuary was
partially stamped out by the armed heel of power, and
Alsatia gave place to law and order. Scott's " Fortunes of
Nigel" vividly depicts the scenes that frequently arose in
Sanctuary, and disgraced medieval ages.
<p>The boundary of Alsatia on the west was the Temple;
on the north, Fleet Street; on the south, the Thames; and
on the east, Whitefriars, formerly Water Lane, where stood
the monastery of the white-robed Carmelites, an order of
mendicants deriving their name from Mount Carmel, in
Judea, and practising great austerities; and thus was seen,
as it ever is between law and religion, a congregation of
the pariahs of society, fed on either side by the upheaving
of unworthy members, who, hunted from the one to the
other, took refuge in the common haunt of rascaldom. In
Shire Lane or Lower Serle Street
That stood on the north side of Fleet Street, immediately
<pb n="22" id="p.22">
contiguous to Temple Bar, and divided the city from the
shire, removed to make way for modern improvements,
lived Sir Charles Sedly, the contemporary and friend of
Rochester, and one of the wittiest of the Court of
Charles II.; his poems, though loose in morals, are elegant
in diction, and captivating in style; here lived, too,
Christopher Kat, the originator of, and at whose house
was founded and held, the celebrated club called the Kit
Kat, deriving its name from his, although some suggest that
the title was taken from Kitten and Cat, and amongst them
Pope, who thus apostrophises it:
            <lb>"Whence deathless Kit Kat took its name,
            <lb>   Few Critics can unriddle;
            <lb> Some say from pastrycook it came,
            <lb>   And some from Cat and Fiddle.
            <lb> From no trim beaux its name it boasts,
            <lb>   Grey statesmen, or green wits;
            <lb> But from the pell mell pack of toasts
            <lb>   Of old Cats and young Kits."
<p>Kat was a pastrycook, famous for mutton pies, which
formed a portion of the bill of fare of the dinners given by
the club, which consisted of thirty-nine noblemen and
gentlemen banded    together for the purpose of giving
stability to the Protestant succession of the House of
Hanover.
<p>Bell Yard was always a famous resort for fishing-tackle
makers, as was also
            <pb n="23" id="p.23">
                <div1 type="section" n="3"><head>Fetter Lane</head>
<p>Which derives its name from Fewters, or idle people, who
lounged away their time in and about its purlieus. Some
historians give the derivation from Fetters, by reason of
criminals lying there in fetters waiting their doom ; the lane
was used at either end for a period of two centuries as a place
of execution. The White Horse Inn, once a celebrated
Oxford University house, where many eminent men visiting
London from that seat of learning took up their residence,
and amongst them Lord Eldon, is now turned into a threepenny lodging-house for tramps and beggars, where the
poor have furnished them a halfpennyworth of bread, butter, cheese, tea, or sugar; or of any other delicate comestible out of which can be made a profit by the innkeeper.
<p>At 77 lived <name type="person" key="Thomas Paine">Tom Paine</name>, the author of "The Rights of
Man," which he dedicated to General Washington. For
the opinions enunciated therein, he was imprisoned, and by
that sentence raised to martyrdom and made famous; he
produced many other works, written with great fluency and
clear thought, but yet so scurrilous in tone, and often so
false and ignorant in data, as to be unworthy the perusal
of minds sedulous to acquire truthful and sound ideas.
Tom Paine represented Calais in the French Republic, and
endeavoured to stimulate the French people to make  war
against England.
<pb n="24" id="p.24">
  "Praise-God Barebone," the leather-seller of the Revolution, who became one of the most intolerant members of
Cromwell's Parliament, that was named after him, lived here
with his two brothers, who were severally named "Christcame-into-the-worl-to-save  Barebone,"  and  "If-Christhad-not-died-thou-hadst-been-damned Barebone,"a trio eminently suggestive in nomenclature, and highly euphonious.
<p>Surely fanaticism in surnames can no further go! At 16,
over Fleur-de-lis Court, lived John Dryden, born <date value="1631">1631</date>, died
<date value="1700">1700</date>; it is sufficient for his fame to point to his translation
of Virgil, where vigour, variety, and copiousness abound,
and march side by side with correct and harmonious poetry,
matchless in freedom and admirable in refinement; indeed,
so finished is it, that Pope pronounces it "the most noble
and spirited translation in any language ;" and he was right,
for it has rendered his name famous, and placed a wreath
of immortality on his brow. Next door to Dryden, at the
right-hand corner of Fleur-de-lis Court, lived the infamous
Mrs. Brownrigg, who
           <lb> "Whipped two female 'prentices to death,
           <lb> And hid them in the coal-hole.
           <lb> For this act did Brownrigg swing."
<p>At 3, Bartlett's Passage, lived <name type="person" key="John Guy">John Guy</name>, the author of
the most popular Spelling Book of this century. In
            <pb n="25" id="p.25">
                 <div1 type="section" n="4"><head>Child's Place</head>
<p>Was situated the celebrated "Devil's Tavern," with its
unique sign of St. Dunstan pulling the Devil's nose; the
tavern is, I believe turned into Child's banking house, but
the sign is still shown on the premises. The story goes
that St. Dunstan, who derives his name from the Saxon
words dun, high; stane, a stone-born A.D. 924, was a
famous worker in iron and brass. A protean devil, in the
shape and form of a beautiful woman, appeared to him
whilst he was at work making some iron trinkets, and
Dunstan, being irritated at the intrusion and temptation
offered him, plucked his tongs, glowing hot from the fire,
seized the Devil by the nose, and kept him there some
time roaring with agony. In
                 <div1 type="section" n="5"><head>Chaucery Lane</head><p>
Stood the palace of the Bishop of Chichester, between
Bream's Buildings and Cursitor Street, and the mansion is
still standing. On the present site of Southampton Buildings was the residence of the ill-fated <name type="person" key="William Russell">Lord William Russell</name>,
implicated in " The Rye House Plot;" and although the

At No. 8 lived Dr. Johnson for the last twenty years of
his life.  Johnson, who wrote " Rasselas," one of the most
charming tales in the English language, " The Lives of the
Poets," containing a critical analysis of the leading poetical
minds ; Johnson, of whom     Garrick said, and truly so

         <lb>That one English soldier can beat ten of France;
         <lb>If you alter the fame from the sword to the pen,
         <lb>Our odds are still greater, still greater our men.
         <lb>In the deep mines of science though Frenchmen may toil,

         <lb>First Shakspeare and Milton, like gods in the fight,

         <lb>And Johnson, well armed, like a hero of yore,
         <lb>Has beat forty French, and can beat forty more."
  <p>This eulogium places in sufficient prominence the fact,
that Johnson produced a Dictionary of the English lan
guage--for it is to this dictionary Garrick specially alluded
--so complete that it out-distances and out-perfections the
French Dictionary that occupied the thoughts and intel

and died <date value="1784">1784</date>, had many peculiarities which have come to
us minutely photographed. He is in his private life better
known to us than any other celebrity: through the instrumentality of Boswell, we know everything anent him; "his
hat, coat, wig, figure, face, scrofula--his St. Vitus's dance, his
rolling walk, blinking eye, and the too outward signs on his
visage of his gluttonous propensities, his voracity for fishsauce, craving for tea; his trick of touching the posts, his
hoarding orange peel; his contortions, his mutterings, gruntings, puffings, his sarcastic wit, his insolence, his rage "-all
are stereotyped by Boswell, the spy, the tattler, and the
sycophant.

of a common soldier on active service. As a main self

Salisbury Court
Stood the inn of the Bishop of Salisbury. In olden timesthe most important residences of the nobility and gentry
were called " inns."  The house now referred to became
subsequently Sackville House, the residence of Sir Thomas
Sackville, who was created Earl of Dorset by James I., and
of whom it was said he could bear to hear others praised,
but despised the arts of courtiers. He befriended the unhappy; he was most engaging in manners, loveable and
accomplished, and at once a poet, philosopher, philanthropist, and wit; full of chivalric notions and daring courage.
On his change of style and title to Earl of Dorset, the
residence changed to Dorset House, hence Dorset Street.

literary society, and was visited by Johnson, Archbishop
Secker, Madame Chapone, Goldsmith, Hogarth, Dr. Young,
and Mrs. Barbauld,the amiable and pious author of "Hymns
and Stories for Children:" as Richardson was not above

Shoe Lane
Contained a celebrated cockpit (temp. James I.), and about
one hundred years ago, this neighbourhood was noted for
its charming gardens, its lime trees and rookery, and wore

                <div1 type="section" n="12"><head>Farringdon Street</head><p>
Is built on what was formerly the bed of the river Fleet,
which became subsequently the Fleet Ditch, and still courses
on its weary way beneath the street as the Fleet Sewer; the
Fleet gave its name to the street and the prison. It was an
important stream, and derived its name from its rapid current; it likewise means the place where the tide comes up.
<p>It took its rise east of Hampstead Hill. We are told by
old chroniclers, it carried on its bosom at one time eight
ships abreast to Holborn Bridge, where they traversed the
             <pb n="33" id="p.33">
watery highway. It is even said that the remains of a
ship were found embedded in this ancient river, near Camden Town. Willows grew along and lined its sedgy banks,
and it was fed by numberless small streams or brooks,
which swelled its rapid current, and it emptied itself into
the mighty Thames, near the foot of Blackfriars Bridge.
 <p> On the western side of Farringdon Street is Farringdon
Market, formerly the site of St. Andrew's workhouse and
burying-ground: it covers the remains of the ill-starred and
ill-fated, but highly-gifted boy poet, Thomas Chatterton,
who, reduced to the greatest distress, at his lodgings in
Brooke Street, Holborn, in a fit of despair poisoned himself. Farringdon Market, designed for the sale of fruit and
vegetables, was built by the Corporation of the City of
London, at a cost of &pound; 250,000, and extends over an acre
and a half of ground, but it has never achieved that success
which its centrality seemed to promise.
  Nos. 22 and 23, Farringdon Street, were formerly the
"Wheatsheaf Inn," a noted carrying house, but a still more
notable marrying shop, where marriages were effected,
called "Fleet marriages" (i.e., clandestine marriages performed
in the Fleet prison and in its neighbourhood), between any
two persons, male and female, who chose to present
themselves in the chapel or parlour set aside in these premises for that purpose. The ceremony was performed by
itinerant parsons who dwelt in the locality, and who
    C
<pb n="34" id="p.34">
frequently carried about them books in which they registered the performance of the rite, and this was frequently the
only registry vouchsafed to such marriages. Nearly every
inn in the locality, situate on or near the banks of the
Fleet river, had its chapel for this purpose, and this barbarous usage, paralleled only by the mummeries enacted
until very recently at Gretna Green, continued until <date value="1754">1754</date>,
when the reformation swept it away; but so great was the
fascination for this legal illegality, that on the last day
such marriages as were performed under this "custom,"
could be held to be legal, 217 unions took place at one
marrying shop in one day. A curious style of entry occasionally is seen where it was intended to keep secret the
rites that had been performed; as thus:  " Ed. and Eliz. were married, and would not let me know
their names. The man said he was a weaver, and lived in
Bandy-leg Court, Boro'-Pr. E. Ashwell."
  The Fleet Prison was situated on the eastern bank of the
river Fleet, and was a large and pretentious-looking building, having a fosse running completely round it, on whose
banks the willows grew luxuriantly, and into whose waters
were freely turned the entire sewage of the locality, and
public latrines were erected on the outer side. The Fleet
was pre-eminently the Star Chamber prison.     Here
Prynne lost his ears, and was pilloried; the most
            <pb n="35" id="p.35">
frightful tortures were enacted towards the poor victims
who became prisoners in the Fleet. Hogarth has immortalized its horrors in his notable picture of " Bainbridge,
one of its warders, under examination," wherein a prisoner
is supposed to recite the horrors and cruelties he suffered
at his hands.
<p>Subsequently to its being abolished as a state prison
it was used only for the confinement of debtors; and
Charles Dickens has, in his " Pickwick Papers," with that
graphic naturalness that is all his own, painted in undying colours the sufferings and privations endured by the
poor debtors even under the new regime. The Fleet was
abolished by act of Parliament in <date value="1842">1842</date>.
<p>The Fleet sewer, which runs beneath Farringdon Street
and New Bridge Street, is one of the most important
sewers in the kingdom. It drains an area nearly seven
times as large as the whole City of London, and receives
its tributaries of sewerage from far-off suburban districts.
             <div1 type="section" n="Ludgate, or Floodgate,"><head>Ludgate, or Floodgate,</head><p>
Which gives its name to Ludgate Hill and Ludgate Street,

City of London proper, and was situate between the London Coffee House and St. Martin's Church, on Ludgate
Hill. The gate is supposed to have been built by King
    C 2
<pb n="36" id="p.36">
Lud, who reigned in England about sixty-six years B. C.:
it was removed in <date value="1760">1760</date>, and the statues of King Lud and
his two sons, with one of Queen Elizabeth, were placed in
St. Dunstan's Church, Fleet Street, where they may still
be seen. Some persons contend that the name was originally Flood-gate, and was derived from the flood or stream
that coursed down here from all parts into the Fleet.
<p>Ludgate Street and Hill were always famous for mercers and drapers.
         <div1 type="section" n="13"><head>The Belle Sauvage Yard</head><p>
Is situated on the north side. The derivation of the term
Belle Sauvage, is shrouded in mystery; by some it is defined
as a beautiful woman, supposed to have been found in a wood
or wilderness; by some its derivation is pronounced as arising
from a picture of a Bell and a Savage; and by others,
that it took its name from one Isabella Savage, who held
some right to this property, and ceded it to the Cutlers'
Company: it matters little which derivation is correct.
In the yard was situated the Belle Sauvage Inn, some portion of which is still standing; the building was a fine
specimen of the "Players' Inn," before regular theatres
were built, and there they performed their mysteries and
their mummeries in the open air.
<p>At No. 11 , Belle Sauvage Yard, lived Grinling Gibbons
            <pb n="37" id="p.37">
the eminent wood carver, whose celebrated carved nosegay,
that the slightest zephyr could put in motion, so that the
flowers, in their grace and beauty, deceived the most practised eye, was pronounced the most perfect chef d'ouvre
ever seen.  Gibbons was the sculptor of the celebrated
work of art in the Royal Exchange, the figure of Charles II.,
adorned with all the beauty and finish of the most
elaborate workmanship. A large section of the yard is
covered now by the immense printing establishment of
Messrs. Cassell, Petter, and Galpin, who have done more
to educate the people by their popular literature than any
modern publishers.
               <div1 type="section" n="14"><head> The Old Bailey</head><p>
Is supposed to derive its name from Ballium, an outer
space, or from Bail-hill, an eminence, whereon was situated
the Bail, or Bailiff's-house. At No. 68 lived Jonathan Wild,
the notorious housebreaker, where he was arrested in <date value="1724">1724</date>,
condemned and executed at Tyburn.   At No. 67 lived
William Hone, the author of the profane parodies of the

he wrote "The Vicar of Wakefield," a beautiful novel. His

for description and pathos, have few equals in any language.
Goldsmith made a tour through Europe on foot, in <date value="1755">1755</date>,
and started, as he characteristically tells us, with "one
guinea in his pocket, a shirt on his back, and a flute in his
hand."  He died in <date value="1774">1774</date>, and was buried in the Temple
churchyard. In

caricaturist that ever lived. His colouring is solid though
unpretending; his "March to Finchley " is too little known,
for it bears the stamp of his highest genius. "The Rake's
Progress," "The Harlot's Progress," and "La Mariage a
la Mode," are works that gained for the early English school
of painting world-wide fame, and their truthfulness and
vivid reality have never been surpassed. He died in <date value="1764">1764</date>,
and is buried in Chiswick churchyard.

Is supposed to derive its name from the fact, that it was
the last gate, or newest gate built, enclosing the City of
             <pb n="39" id="p.39">
London on the west. The original gate was erected in
the time of William the Conqueror, but destroyed by the
discontented populace that marched to Smithfield under
the leadership of Wat Tyler. The present structure owes
its origin to Sir Richard Whittington, thrice Lord Mayor
of London.
<p>Newgate is a prison of detention for persons who have to
be tried for various offences committed in the Cityof London
or in the County of Middlesex ; it is also the place of execution for criminals sentenced to suffer the extreme penalty
of the law in the county of Middlesex. The chief court of
judicature held herein is the Central Criminal Court, the
arena in which the most eminent jurists this country has
produced have won their spurs. The celebrity of Old
Bailey wit and repartee is world-wide.  An alderman of
the City of London is compelled by the legal enactments
of the court, to sit on the Bench with the principal judges
who try the causes here; and the sheriffs are bound to furnish a special bill of fare for their dinner. Two dinners are
provided each day the court sits, at three and at five P.M.,
and each must be alike; both must include marrow puddings and rump-steaks; and not unfrequently has it been
noted that aldermen maintain their reputation for gastronomy by indulging their epicurean proclivities at both
dinners.
  Daniel de Foe was imprisoned in Newgate for writing a
<pb n="40" id="p.40">
pamphlet of a semi-political and religious character, entitled
"The Shortest Way with the Dissenters ;" he was sentenced to the pillory, to be fined and imprisoned; but the
punishment was a failure, for exulting thousands accompanied him daily from the pillory to Newgate, and the
pillory itself was decorated with garlands of flowers. De
Foe was the author of " Robinson Crusoe," one of the most
charming romances in our language, and said to be founded
on the true history of the residence of Alexander Selkirk
on the desert isle of Juan Fernandez. Dr. Johnson remarks
of the author, and his opinion will be endorsed by all
who read De Foe: " Was there ever anything written by
mere man that the reader wished longer, except Robinson
Crusoe, Don Quixote, and the Pilgrim's Progress?"
  The Press-yard, one of the feudal horrors still in existence, shows to what length the mind of man, under the
debasing effects of example, will go. The punishment of
the Press-yard consisted of thumb-screws, weights, and
presses. The thought of having one's thumbs pressed in a
kind of vice until the joints cracked, and the blood spurted
forth; to be placed bodily on a slab of stone, and to have
weights piled on one's chest and stomach, until nature
could nought heavier bear, seems the perfection of torture
and not punishment, seems calculated to engender crime,
not repress it, by making men familiar with the sight of
blood, and indifferent to the agonies of their fellows, and

               <lb>   And I'm at Rotterdam."
  <p>The hills and the valley that made Holborn famous, or
infamous, have given place to a magnificent viaduct, built
by the Corporation of the City of London, and opened on
the 6th November, <date value="1869">1869</date>, by her most gracious Majesty
Queen Victoria, in the presence of the Lord Mayor, the
civic authorities, and countless thousands of the English
people. From end to end it is a thousand feet in length
and eighty feet in width. The subway is constructed on
the most solid and scientific principles, giving special facilities for the laying down of water, or gas-pipes, electric
wires, or any subterranean necessity that advancing science
may need, to carry out improvements. At each of the four
corners of the bridge that spans Farringdon Street is built
a splendid tower, containing the steps by which you descend
into Farringdon Street. The towers are enriched with
genuine works of art, consisting of figures of notabilities of
the City of London--Sir Thomas Gresham, Henry Fitzalweyn, Sir William  Walworth, Sir Hugh Myddelton;
whilst at the several corners of Farringdon bridge are hand

commerce. Take it for all in all, this work is a triumph of

Barnard's Inn.
 <p> At No. 2 lived Peter Woulfe, a famous alchemist, who
gave his breakfast-parties at four o'clock in the morning.
Woulfe had eccentric ideas with regard to illness, and used,
if he were at all unwell, to take a seat outside the Edinburgh
Mail Coach, in order to restore himself to health. In one
of these journeys he took cold, from which he died. When
his rooms were opened, after his decease, it was with the
greatest difficulty they could be entered, because they were
so crowded with apparatus of all sorts.
 <p> St. Andrew's Church is one of the finest of Sir C. Wren's
building-rich in gilding and stained windows, it has been
not inaptly called the poet's church; and indeed it contains
much that is poetical in its history. John Webster, the
dramatist, author of "The Duchess of Malfi," was once
clerk to St. Andrew's. Richard Savage, a natural son of
the Countess of Macclesfield, was connected with St. Andrew's. Poor Savage, whose misfortunes commenced, one
might say, in his shameless mother's womb-for it is a
misfortune to have a mother who, before a child is born,
<pb n="44" id="p.44">
can, and will, openly boast that her husband is not its
father. Savage unfortunately killed a man in a tavern
broil, and his mother did everything possible to get him
executed; and being condemned, she exerted all her influence to prevent his receiving a royal pardon. He was,
however, reprieved, but fell into misfortunes, and eventually
died in the debtors' prison, Bristol, <date value="1743">1743</date>.
Ely Place,
Where stood once the mansion of the bishops of Ely, from

ruthless hand of time. There is left, however, St. Ethelreda's Chapel, with its wondrous boldly-arched roof, its
splendid row of windows,-that, at the east end, being finely
and richly ornamented. Shakspeare, in Richard III., incidentally mentions the gardens and the fine strawberries
grown in Ely Gardens. In Richard II., he again refers to
Ely House as the place in which John of Gaunt, time
honoured Lancaster, died, and where he held his last
interview  with Richard II.  One other relic has survived the Vandalism  of the age-a stone mitre, said
to have adorned the gate or walls of Ely House,
beautifully cut, bearing the date <date value="1546">1546</date>, and now the sign
of the Mitre Tavern, Mitre Court, Hatton Garden, may

ended on the east at St. Sepulchre's Church, and on
the west ran into the hollow; it was memorable for the
Saracen's Head Hotel, one of the fine old inns. The
yard of the Saracen's Head is mentioned in "Nicholas
Nickleby" as the starting-point of Squeers and Nicholas
Nickleby for Do-the-boys-Hall.
  St. Sepulchre's Church is situated in Skinner Street, but
was anciently mentioned as being in the Bailey; it is a remarkably handsome building, partly constructed by Wren's
genius, and partly of most ancient date. The organ is one
of the finest in London. A mournful history attaches to one
of the bells of St. Sepulchre; one Richard Dowe, in the year

                 <div1 type="section" n="19"><head>Giltspur Street</head><p>
Takes its name from the "gilt spurs" worn by the knights
riding through to Smithfield; it was formerly called Knight
Rider Street, and was the highway for all the pageants and
fetes to pass into the field. As we pass along, we may just
call attention to a portion of the kitchen of Christ's Hospital
which belongs to Farringdon Without.
                  <div1 type="section" n="20"><head> Cock Lane</head><p>,
At the corner of which, in Giltspur Street, is now the
"Fortune of War" public house, finished the fire of London, on the 5th September, <date value="1666">1666</date>, consuming 78 parish
churches, 5 chapels, 13,200 houses, and entailing a loss of
nearly 75 millions of our present money value. To commemorate this the figure of a boy is placed over the first-floor
of the " Fortune of War," with his arms folded over his
breast, and holding a tablet, on which is inscribed, although
scarcely to be read,--" This boy is in memory put up for
the late fire of London, occasioned by the sin of gluttony,
<date value="1666">1666</date>." This house is memorable as a notorious bodysnatchers' den. Here Hare and Burke frequently met their
"Burkers," and here the bodies were placed up like statues
round the room for the selection of the students from St.
Bartholomew's Hospital; here the notorious Dr. Brooke
<pb n="48" id="p.48">
came to purchase the offal (shall we say) of each corpse
intended for dissection. Many a hideous scene has been
enacted in the back room, which contains some mementoes
of these ghastly doings; to the curious in such matters it is
worth a visit. In Cock Lane the house still stands that was
the scene of the Cock Lane ghost imposture in <date value="1762">1762</date>, visited
by princes, peers, and ladies, and by countless thousands
of believers and non-believers; it attained world-wide celebrity, and many pamphlets were written supporting its existence, and many denying. In Red Lion Place there is a
grotesque head carved in wood, temp. James I. In Red
Lion Court resided Alderman Wilkes, and from thence he
married Miss Mead, the rich drysalter's daughter. Wilkes
published here the celebrated periodical, "The North
Briton ;" he retained the aldermanic dignity until he was
elected chamberlain of the City of London, and then resigned it. Chick Lane, Cow Lane, Hosier Lane, all built in
Henry V.'s reign, reveal their derivation in their names.
                    <div1 type="section" n="21"><head>  Smithfield,</head><p>
 Or <placeName key="Smithfield">Smoothfield</placeName>
  (from the Saxon smith, smoothe), was
 anciently the great public suburban promenade of the citi zens of London; it was likewise the live cattle-market of
 the metropolis, and was used for that purpose, as early as
 <date value="1150">1150</date>, and continued as a market for more than seven
             <pb n="49" id="p.49">
centuries. Situate just outside the walls of the city, planted
with here and there its clumps of elms, and rich with willows
on the west, it formed an agreeable recreation ground for
all who had leisure to enjoy it; not unfrequently forsaken
by the sober citizens, and given over to the roughs, who
settled all disputes within the field, it acquired from their
frays and fights the name of Ruffian's Hall; here were held
the quintain matches of the middle ages, which gave proficiency and dexterity in warlike exercises to the competitors. The Town Green had its special clump of trees, where
executions were carried out, as early as <date value="1219">1219</date>, and here many
hundred martyrs suffered at the stake for their religion.
            <lb>"But this was for their fathers' faith
           <lb> They suffered chains and courted death."
 <p>These fanatical executions commenced in <name type="person" key="Henry IV">Henry IV.'s</name>
reign, and reached their climax in <name type="person" key="Mary">Mary's</name>. Of the 277 persons burnt for heresy in bloody Mary's reign, nearly all
suffered in Smithfield. The gallows was set up near St.
Bartholomew's gate, and here in <name type="person" key="Henry VIII">Henry VIII.'s</name> reign they
boiled a man who had been convicted of poisoning. In
Smithfield were held feasts, rejoicings, jousts, and tournaments, to commemorate great victories or especial events.
<name type="person" key="Edward III">Edward III.</name>, in <date value="1357">1357</date>, proclaimed a great and truly regal
joust, to celebrate the victories of Cressy and Poictiers over
the French in <date value="1356">1356</date>. And John, King of France, surnamed
     D
<pb n="50" id="p.50">
the Good, taken prisoner in the last-named battle, together
with David Bruce, King of Scotland, who had been defeated
and captured at Nevil's Cross, in <date value="1346">1346</date>, "graced the chariot
wheels" of Edward, and mournfully assisted at these fetes.
Richard II., successor to the throne of his grandfather,
Edward III., caused a proclamation to be made throughout
Europe by his heralds, that on "the Sunday next following
the feast of St. Michael" would be commenced jousts or
tournaments, open to all comers, and inviting the flower and
elite of foreign chevaliers to a trial of arms against the English nobility. It is recorded that on the day appointed there
issued about three o'clock in the afternoon, from the gates
of the Tower, sixty high-mettled and richly-caparisoned
war horses, each bearing a squire of gentle blood, riding at
a quiet pace; then followed sixty ladies of high degree,
richly dressed and mounted on palfreys, riding on one side,
and leading by a golden chain each her favourite knight,
and thus they took, amidst the sound of trumpets and the
clang of martial music, their way towards Smithfield.
Arriving there, the squires and ladies descended from their
horses, and took the places assigned them; and the knights
mounted each his charger; after the helmet was fastened
on their heads, and they were otherwise armed, the heralds
made proclamation, and the jousts began. These fetes lasted
several days, amidst great feasting; the knights who contested specially in honour of the king, had their armour
            <pb n="51" id="p.51">
and trappings adorned with a white hart, having a crown of
gold on its neck.  In these jousts the English nobility
carried off nearly all the prizes. On the 15th June, <date value="1381">1381</date>,
Richard II. met Wat Tyler in Smithfield, who was at the
head of a riotous mob; to hold a conference and hear a
statement of the grievances under which the rebels complained they suffered; when Tyler, seizing the king's horse
by the bridle, was stabbed by Walworth, mayor of London;
at the same moment the king, then only about fifteen years
of age, spurring on his horse towards the irritated populace,
called out in a loud voice-" Follow your king, I will be
your leader, and redress your grievances." The people,
astonished at so daring an act, submitted quietly to
be led out of Smithfield, and dispersed to their homes.
A few days after, Jack Straw, the second rebel in
command, and Tyler's lieutenant, having been taken
prisoner, was executed in Smithfield.  Trial by ordeal
was carried on in Smithfield-ordeal consisted of either
fire or water.  Trial by fire was used for the free;
simple ordeal consisted in carrying in the hand, red
hot, a I lb. weight-double ordeal, in carrying a 2 lb.:
and triple, in carrying a 3 lb.  Trial by water was
used for the servile only.   After the great fire of
London, the houseless, poor, and wretched, lived in huts
erected in Smithfield, until more permanent residences
could be procured.
<pb n="52" id="p.52">
              <div1 type="section" n=x><head> St. Bartholomew.</head><p>
  The Church of St. Bartholomew-the-Great deserves
mention, as being the oldest Church in the City of London.
Two fairs were annually held at St. Bartholomew-tide: one,
the great Cloth Fair of the kingdom, in Cloth Fair district:
and the other, for the sale of cattle and goods, and likewise a pleasure fair, held in the open space in Smithfield;
this last was abolished in <date value="1855">1855</date>, after an existence of 7
years. <name type="person" key="Henry I">Henry I.</name> made a grant to his jester, Rayer, who,
whilst travelling on the Continent, had been much impressed with some religious ceremonies he witnessed,
determined, on his return to England, to do something
towards the salvation of his soul. He therefore founded
a Priory within the precincts of St. Bartholomew, wherein
was held the Cloth Fair. Rayer is said to have performed
many miracles; at least he managed, by his clever jugglery,
to impose on large numbers of persons, and achieved a
reputation that brought him  considerable offerings in
money and kind, from devotees who sought his aid or
came to worship at St. Bartholomew's Priory.  Here is
erected a monument to his memory, and there he lies,
upon a raised tomb, bare-headed and shaven crown, his
hands crossed together; on each side of him are two
Friars, in grey, holding two large books. Boniface, Archbishop of Canterbury, visited the Priory in <date value="1250">1250</date>, and was
            <pb n="53" id="p.53">
received by the Sub-Prior, who, not liking the tone of
Boniface's interrogations, answered him impertinently, and
received for his guerdon a severe beating, at which ensued
a fight between the Archbishop's followers and the Priory
Monks, who, being in the end severely cudgelled, complained to the King at Westminster, but could get no
redress. Within the precincts of Cloth Fair, at the " Hand
and Shears" public house, was held a Court of Justice,
called dusty feet, or "pieds poudre," and persons guilty of
infringing the laws of the fair were tried for any offences
of which they were accused, and if convicted were summarily punished with the stocks, pillory, or whipping; and
this continued until the Reformation.
<div1 type="section" n=x><head>Bartholomew Fair</head><p>
Was usually proclaimed on the 2nd September, by the
Lord Mayor and his officers, who came in state for that
purpose, and it was always opened with a burlesque
proclamation and by the cloth dealers marching in order
round Smithfield, snapping their shears and shouting.
Hentzner graphically describes the proclamation of the
Fair, in all its absurdity-the wrestling, and jumping after;
the excited crowd hunting wild rabbits, graced by the
admiring presence of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and
City worthies.  The amusements, some of which will
<pb n="54" id="p.54">
be described more at length, consisted of exhibitions of
wild beasts, dwarfs, and any monstrosities or abortions of
nature, tight-rope dancing, sarabands, performing dogs,
hares, and tigers, punchinello, punch-and-judy, and indeed
of any novelty that could be imported and that was
thought likely to be attractive.
  There was usually an ox roasted whole, and pigs a galore
served up in savoury portions. Many eminent men have
appeared at St. Bartholomew Fair, and amongst them
Tom Doggett, the comedian, who left a considerable sum
of money for a prize, to be contended for by six watermen's apprentices, on the first day of August in every year,
who are to row from London Bridge to Chelsea against
tide, and the winner to receive as a guerdon a coat
and badge.
  Ben Jonson, the contemporary and friend of Shakspeare,
played THE grave-digger in Hamlet at St. Bartholomew's
Fair, and it is said that Edmund Kean, in his early years,
was a harlequin at Richardson's booth. Warwick House
(temp. Elizabeth), situate in Cloth Fair, together with the
Priory, and the right to hold the fair, were purchased
by Sir R. Rich, in <date value="1544">1544</date>, and handed down to his descendants, the Earls of Warwick and Lord Holland. Lady
Holland's mob, the nucleus of which was formed in this
locality, and which has been known to number 5,0<pb n="00" id="p.00">
strong, was, in the last century and in the early portions of
             <pb n="55" id="p.55">
this, so formidable as to overawe the entire civil authority.
It is worthy of notice that two very fine brackets, carved
in wood, are to be seen at the corner of Cloth Fair.
  Ben Jonson, in his comedy of Bartholomew Fair, humorously depicts its motions, puppet shows, and moving
figures, representing the fall of Jerusalem, Nineveh, and
the conspiracy of the Gunpowder Plot-the last having
been performed nine times in one afternoon, at a then
celebrated booth, to twenty-penny audiences.  Pepys says
he found Lady Castlemaine visiting a puppet show, her
coach attending hard by-the street full of people awaiting
her return from the fair. Having fairly entered on the
scene, we shall find at different periods, Cadmus, the flyer
on the rope, immortalized by Hogarth. Phillips listening
to the first trial of " Britons, strike home," written expressly for St. Bartlemy, and Sweet Kitty Clive amorously
ogling her many admirers. Against the many attractions
of the fair, the regular theatres found it useless to cope,
so with worldly wisdom they made a virtue of necessity,
and closed their doors for the time it lasted; indeed, what
theatres could withstand such attractions as were often put
forth to be seen for one shilling, sixpence, threepence,
or even a penny, at last: for as the fair fluctuated in its
attractiveness, the shows kept up or reduced their prices
according as their highest or lowest periods of success had
set in. Only fancy the advertisement of the first intro
<pb n="56" id="p.56">
duction into this country of "a large and beautiful young
camel from Grand Cairo, in Egypt, twenty-three years old;
his head and neck are like that of a deer, and he is to be
seen or sold at the first house on the pavement at the end
of Hosier Lane during the fair."
  Sir Hans Sloane found sufficient novelties in the foreign
animals exhibited to employ an artist to sketch all the
wonders.  There were to be seen scores of celebrated
characters; conjurors, tumblers, rope-walkers, fire-eaters,
actors, mummers, and exhibitors of all sorts--" Joy," the
English Samson-Burling and his wonderful monkeythe stone-eater (Battalia)-Topham the strong manHale the piper, having very surprising faculties-The Moorfields book auctioneer removed his bookstall to Smithfield
round, during the fair-Powell, with his puppets, always a
favourite resort for his mechanical people, played " Whittington and his Cat," "Dr. Faustus" "Robin Hood and Little
John," and "The Children in the Wood;" add to these
the comical, serio-farcical humours of Valentini, Nicolini,
and the tuneful warbling pig of Italian race, and you have
a bill of fare worthy a lord mayor and his sheriffs. Judith
and Holophernes took possession and kept the boards for
a long time. Then there were the learned cats that beat the
drum, turned the spit, ground knives-aye, and well tooplayed music, it might have been the " cat's call," struck an
anvil and rang bells; then the wonderful dog that would
            <pb n="57" id="p.57">
and could play any gentleman at dominoes who would
play with him. One of the great sights was the acrobat
women, who balanced themselves on the palms of their
hands on the points of sharpened swords, with their
heads downwards, and their feet in the air; such a feat
is not attempted in these days-even by Japanese jugglers.  Another feature in female acrobattery was their
walking on stilts, carrying babies in their arms, and jugs
of water on their heads.  Toby, the real learned pig,
was a great card, and his competitor also drew crowds
under the style and title of "The Amazing Pig of Knowledge." There was the wondrous child, said to have been
born back to back with a live bear, and clever was the
deceit.  Or would you like to sea feats of strength ? The
Italian Female Samson, who could walk barefoot along a
bar of red-hot iron, bear a block of marble <date value="2000">2000</date> to <date value="3000">3000</date> lbs.
weight upon her body, and, without touching it with her
hands, heave it six feet; or, placing her head on one chair,
and her feet on another, would bear the weight of six large
men between her stomach and her instep; these are
feats unparalleled in modern muscularity--at least by
women.
  Another remarkable exhibitor was one Joseph Clark,
the posture master, who could imitate any deformity or
dislocation. It was he who frequently performed those
ludicrous tricks on the tailors sent to measure him, appear
<pb n="58" id="p.58">
ing before them first as a man having a hump on his right
shoulder; when the tailor brought home the clothes, the
hump was on the left shoulder; then, after he had made
the necessary alteration, and apologized for his blunder
and inattention in observing where the hump was, he found
Clark at his next visit with the hump changed to his
back. Once more having retired to re-alter and re-adapt
the garments, he returned only to find Clark perfectly
straight, and enjoying heartily the discomfiture of Snip.
Grouped with him was the facial contortionist, who lolls
out his tongue a full foot from his lips, and turns his eyes
in or out of their sockets; at the same time contracts his
face until it is as small as an apple, extends his mouth to
six inches wide, then shapes it like a bird's beak, then into
the form of a hat cocked up on three sides, licks his nose
like a cow, or makes his eyes as round as an owl's.
  Near the last worthy was perched the little man of the
fair, two feet nine inches high, likewise a contortionist, who,
when he slept, put his head between his two feet as on
a pillow, and his great toes one in each ear. Then you
come upon the country yokel, who entertained his friends
in this wise
          "In fifty-five (may I never thrive
             If I tell you any more than is true),
             To London we came, hearing of the fame
             Of a Fair they call Bartholomew."
               <pb n="59" id="p.59">
            "In houses of boards men walk upon cords,
               As easy as squirrels crack filberds.
             But the cut-purses they do bite, and rob away
             But those we suppose to be ill-birds."
     "For a penny you may see a fine puppet play,
         For twopence a rare piece of art;
       And a penny a can, that even a man
         May put zix of each into a quart.
       When zights are so rich, is able to bewitch
         The head of a very nice man-a.
         Here's patient Grisel here, and fair Rosamond there,
         And the history of Susanna."
      " At Pye Corner End, mark well, my good friend;
          'Tis a very fine dirty place        Where there's more arrows and bows, the Lord above knows,
          Than was handled at Chevy Chase.
        Then at Smithfield Bars, 'twixt the ground and the stars,
          There's a place they call Shoemaker Row        Where, that you may buy, shoes every day,
          Or go bare-foot all the year, I tro ! "
  Rambling further on, and plodding on your way, amidst
the cries of " What do you lack, gentlemen ? "  " What do you lack, fair maids? See; a fine hobby-horse for your young
master. Cost you but a token a week for his provender."
      " Have you any corns on your feet and toes ?
      " Buy a Mouse-trap--buy a Mousetrap;"
      " A Tormentor for a flea ;"
      " Buy some Ginger-bread ;"
      "Ballads, Ballads, fine new Ballads ;"
      " Hear for your love, and buy for your money."
      " A delicate ballad o' the ferret and the coney;"
      "A dozen of divine points, and the Godly Satan ;
      " The fairing of good counsel, of an ell and three-quarters."
<pb n="60" id="p.60">
  "What do you lack, Mistress? What do you lack? a fine hobby horse to
make your son a tilter-a drum to make him a soldier-a fiddle to make him
a reveller-What is't you lack ? little dogs for your daughters-or babies
(male or female)-a delicate show pig, little misters, with sweet sauce and
crackling like 'de bay leaf i 'de fire-la ! tou shall ha'de clean side o' de table
clot and de glash vash'd wi di phatersh of Dame Annesh Cleare."
  Here they tickle your ear with a straw; and lo ! you have
lost your purse.
              " Now the fair filling,"
              " O for a tune to startle"
              " The birds of the booths now billing,"
              " Yearly with Old Saint Bartle."
              " Buy any Ballads, new Ballads ;"
              " Buy my Pears, Pears-"
              " Fine, very fine Pears."
  Onward you go, running against John Locke, who is
elbowing his way through the crowd in philosophic mood,
till you near Hosier Lane, where the large placards announce
"The Wonderful Rattlesnakes; one a very large reptile
that rattles so loud you may hear him near a quarter of a
mile off, and plays something of music that grows on his
tail."
  <p>But stay; why divides the crowd--what tumult onward
makes it way ? 'Tis authority's stern port that heads towards
the elms, to mete out justice to some bold defier of the
law, and yet this man seems not of the common order, but
of mien most noble ;-'tis great Wallace, the rugged hero,
stout of heart and strong of hand, was brought to London
             <pb n="61" id="p.61">
the day before the opening of the Fair, has been tried and
sentenced, with sparse time for shrift or shrive, and now is
dragged all through the muddy streets, at the horse's tail,
from Westminster to Smithfield, for execution. The great
hero, soiled and polluted with the filth and garbage of the
streets, still defiant looks upon his executioners and the
wondering crowd.   Trade for the moment is forgotten;
the booths deserted, Punch is silent, the puppets no longer
dance in sportive mimicry; even the vendors' cries are
hushed, as dreadful whisper fearfully breathes the patriot's
name; and when the noose is fastened to his neck, his
body launched from the quivering bow, a mighty sigh
-seeming of relief-swells from  the surging crowd, as
though a dauntless and much-feared enemy was no more,
and pent-up feeling thus finds relief; and yet it is not so,
for though hanged, it is not to death. Ere the vital spark
had fled, and whilst the flesh is quivering in the agonizing
throes of death, the brutal sentence, still incomplete, must
be completed. With two cross gashes from the reeking
blade forth gush his bowels, to be torn with ruthless hand
from his shivering flesh, and even before his eyes, still
vital with their noble fire, are burnt within his view.
One other gash strikes off his head, then his body,
cut into five parts, is carted back to gaol, and thus
divided: four portions are sent, one each, to Perth,
Aberdeen, Newcastle, and Berwick; the last portion, with
<pb n="62" id="p.62">
the head, being retained in the great city, to scare the
gaping crowd at Temple Bar.
               "It's a mad world, my masters."
  <p>In the British Museum, amongst Bayford's collection, is
a Play-bill of Heatley's Booth in the time of Queen Anne,
well worthy a perusal, to show the versatility of our forefathers. As late as <date value="1830">1830</date>, upwards of 200 booths for the
sale of toys and gingerbread, interspersed here and there
with Richardson's, Saunders's and Wombwell's shows, were
crowded into Smithfield, at St. Bartholomew.
        <lb>" Now farewell to the fair, you who are wise;
        <lb>  Preserve your purses whilst you feast your eyes."
  <p>Bartholomew Fair greatly declined after the reign of
Queen Elizabeth. The mysteries were succeeded by plays
and conjuring; the Corporation of London licensed it for
fourteen days, and certain city officers were paid out of the
emoluments. The same Corporation, eventually tired of its
fooleries, in <date value="1845">1845</date> and <date value="1855">1855</date>, bought up the last vestige of its
dying glories, and from that period Bartholomew fair bade
the world good night.
  <p> Smithfield, in this year of grace, is more utilized than it
has ever been before. On the <date value="1868-11-24">24th November,1868</date>, was
inaugurated the splendid Metropolitan Meat and Poultry
Market, built by the Corporation of the City of London, at
             <pb n="63" id="p.63">
an expense of 200,000. Some idea of the vastness of this
building may be formed, when it is stated that there are
five miles of iron girders to support the structure.
  <p>The style of the building is Italian Renaissance: the
height of the external wall 32 feet. The covered roadway, which divides the market, 50 feet in width. There
are 162 shops in the market, and the size of each is about
36 feet by 15 feet.
  <p>Long Lane has a few houses remaining of the Elizabethan date, but nothing calling for special notice.
  <p>We have wandered through the ward, stopping here and
there to cull a flower or pluck a weed. To the little that
has been said, much might be added of imperial interest;
every stone bears the imprint of the feet of Genius; the
threshold of each house has been brightened by the figures
of this country's intellectual might more than any locality
in modern Babylon.
  <p>Farringdon Without has been the cradle of the great; and
whether we glance at ye olden time, at mediaeval ages, or
at modern era, we find this locality distinctive for its
patronage of, and aid given to, the onward march of progress, and stamping with its recognition all that is great,
noble, and liberal.
