<head>Author's Preface</head>

<p>THIS little book has been put together in the infrequent intervals of freedom from
the daily and nightly grind of a newspaper man's
life. No claim is set up as to the value of the
work. When I was abroad in the service of
several American newspapers I naturally observed a good many things which struck me as
being worth writing about. Some of them were
duly described and sent to the publications with
which I was connected. Others remained in the
modest retirement of my note-books. They have
all been put together in the present shape, and I
hope they will amuse my readers. I do not expect "The Dark City" to be of any special
benefit to the human race, beyond assisting to
pass an hour here and there.
<p>In editing the mass of matter which is concentrated here I have received valuable
assistance from Mr. Allan Forman. I tried the book



<pb n=iv>

on him, and the fact that he survived the visitation
without a visible shudder encouraged me to invade the general field.
    <p>I have not sought to touch upon the regulation
<mentioned>"sights"</mentioned> of London. I never saw any of them,
and don't know anything about them.   It has
merely been my endeavor to tell of what I did
see, without losing my own temper, in the
hope that the telling will not lead anybody else
to lose his - or hers.
    <p>If I have been successful I shall be glad.
    <p>If I have not, it doesn't much matter.

 <p>ENGLAND is a free-trade country.
          <p>Anybody can tell that by the rigid way in
which the Custom-House officials go through his
trunks when he arrives.
   <p>One good square experience of the English customs' service usually satisfies any American with the
way we do things in New York.
   <p>The ordinary free and enlightened citizen of the
United States generally raves in sorrow and in anger
after he has passed through the Barge Office, but he
gains a meek and lowly admiration for even that
concern when he has once tackled the Liverpool
examination-bureau. He goes to England prepared
to pass along unchallenged, because he has heard all
his life of the blessings of British free trade and
the curses of American protection. But he recovers
from that expectation.   Moreover, his recovery is
sudden. Likewise it is disagreeable.
   <p>The landing of passengers from an ocean steamer
at Liverpool is not an ecstatic affair.   It usually

<pb n=2>

rains in that cheerful spot, and there is generally a
gale blowing, which makes it necessary that the
vessel shall remain outside the bar at the mouth of
the Mersey for a period ranging from one to six
hours, until the tide is at its topmost height. The
Mersey is not a gurgling, translucent stream. It is
about the color of the placid Missouri, and its waters
are so thick and muddy as to lead to the gloomy
reflection that here, at least, the quality of Mersey is
not strained.
   <p>After crossing the bar the steamer slowly pushes
its way up the river to a point opposite the city,
where two curious little steam-tugs come out to
meet her. They are narrow, smoky, filthy boats,
propelled by the old side-wheel apparatus, and they
do not look to be particularly safe.   Indeed, when
the sea runs high, the process of being transferred
from the steamer-deck to the paddle-box of one of
these affairs is not unmixed with danger.   The
tender (they call it a tender, I suppose, because it
looks so tough) is necessarily much lower than the
steamer in the water, and the gang-plank is therefore steep. As the little craft goes up and down,
fifteen feet or so at a time, the plank wabbles in a
most confusing way, and there isn't anything conspicuously attractive in the passage across.
Sometimes the force of the waves smashes the little craft
against the big one so violently as to stave in the
side of the smaller boat, and that doesn't improve
things. Last year, when some American friends
of mine were going out to take ship for home, such
an accident occurred, and the captain of the tender

<pb n=3>

said that if the break had gone eight inches deeper
it would have burst the boiler. Comforting reflection, that!
   <p>But after passengers and baggage are transferred
to the tender, which would hardly be used to ferry
over immigrants in New York, the amusement
just begins. The boat puffs and wheezes away to
the shore, where it is made fast to the floating-dock
Here the passengers are disembarked, and they proceed, with what serenity they can command, to wait
for the Custom-House officials. The articles which
  England does not admit free are tobacco, spirits,
  and dynamite. The reason of their objection to
  cigars from America probably is that their own are
  so bad that they do not desire comparisons. The
  British cigar is like a piece of punk, such as American boys use to light fire-crackers with. Apply a
  match to one end of a cigar purchased in England
  and you need give yourself no anxiety about the
  result. All you have to do is to hold the cigar by
  the other end and watch it smoke itself clear
  through.

     <p>While you are waiting for your baggage to be
    arranged for the convenience of the officers you have
    plenty of time to reflect on these matters, and on a
    good many more. Two or three detectives are in
    the crowd. What they want is a dynamiter. They
    do not know if there is any such animal in the place,
    but they have a passenger-list, among the contents
    of which they have found the name of O'Brien.
    Knowing that an Irishman intent upon blowing up
    the British Empire would naturally come under such






<pb n=4>
a disguise as O'Brien, they search for him. In
reality this personage is a granger from Oregon,
with no more idea of revolution, save in the way of
clothing, than the meekest man on earth. But the
fatal prefix to his name has made him an object of
darksome suspicion to the British detective force,
and he is watched with deep severity. By and by
one of our party goes over and softly whispers to the
Oregon man:-
    <p><q>Don't turn around at once, but when you get a
 good chance look at the big man over against the
 wall. He is a detective, and he is watching you.</q>
    <p><q>G-g-gosh!</q> stammers the granger. <q>What
 for?</q>
    <p><q>I don't know, but if you have any weapons in
 your baggage, look out.</q>
    <p>Mr. O'Brien was pretty badly frightened. He had
 a small revolver in his trunk, and he didn't know but
 he might be hanged for carrying it. When his <mentioned>"box"</mentioned>
 was examined, later on, the detective stood looking
 over the Oregon man's shoulder, ready to pounce
 upon him if necessary. But the pistol, which lay
 between two suits of clothes, was not found, and its
 owner got off scot-free.
    <p>He will probably know the next English detective
 he sees. Any one who has once set eyes on one of
 them forever after knows most members of the force.
 They are, as a rule, big, bulky men, who look as
 though they lived on the fat of the land. They dress
 in check suits, wear Derby hats, carry a pair of
 gloves and a heavy cane in their hands, have their
 whiskers cut in the close mutton-chop fashion, and


                                                                                                                       ,.
                                                                                                                       ..







<pb n=5>

bear an expression of shrewd knowledge of their
own importance which is amusing to behold. In
Ireland there are any number of these men, and
nothing could be more uproariously funny than the
idea of sending English detectives to work up political cases there. There is hardly an Irishman in
the land who doesn't know a Scotland Yard man by
instinct, and it is pretty cold weather for him if
half-a-dozen of them catch him alone on a dark
night.
   <p>All these things occur to one's mind while waiting for the baggage to be arranged in the Liverpool
Custom-House. When, after an hour and a half of
waiting, that has been finally accomplished, the doors
are opened, and the passengers are allowed to go
over a long bridge into the examination-room. It is
a long apartment modelled on the central idea of Pandemonium. There are two hundred and fifty people
in it, all howling at once. Around one side of the
room there are little spaces partitioned off and indicated by the letters of the alphabet. If your name
begins with A, your luggage is in that compartment,
at the upper end of the place. If it begins with U,
your trunks are away down at the far extremity of
the room. Opposite these lettered spaces there is a
long raised bench, behind which the customs' officers
stand waiting for victims.
   <p>Your first duty is to get a porter to carry your
trunks across the room and put them on the bench.
They might just as well have been put there in the
first place, but that would have done away with some
of the red tape of the system, and the English Government






<pb n=6>

could never, never countenance such a thing.
When the trunks are on the bench you wait. You
wait a good deal. The officer is eight or ten feet
away, picking his teeth, and wrapped in profound
consciousness of his own superiority. When he has
emerged from this restful condition he strolls up to
your <mentioned>"boxes"</mentioned> and bags with an amiable expression
of face that is all too deceptive.
    <p>He mildly requests that you open the baggage.
 You do so in the belief that the examination is to be
 merely formal, after all. Deluded being that you
 are, you little dream of what is to follow. As soon
 as you are at the mercy of this gold-laced personage
 his whole exterior changes, and he proceeds to go
 through your trunks with wild ferocity. He turns
 over everything in the tray, scans all the letters he
 comes across, particularly if they are in a feminine
 hand, and proceeds to <mentioned>"muss up"</mentioned> the remaining
 clean shirt which you have preserved after the
 voyage, and which you have counted upon wearing
 to the theatre the first night in London. Having
 finished with the tray, he dives into the main
 body of the trunk. He hauls out your carefully
 folded clothing, pitches it back again in a hopeless
 tangle, scatters your two decks of playing-cards all
 over the place, puts your boots next to your white
 waistcoats, and finally reaches your soiled linen.
 That is the apex of his delight. For the first time
 since he has been at work he begins to smile. As
 he unrolls package after package which has been
 accumulated during the voyage, his smile grows
broader, until as he reaches the last garment, and

<pb n=7>

flings it to the breeze, he is softly chuckling
with joy.
    <p>Then, after he has violently searched every nook
 and corner of your luggage, he asks innocently if
 you have any cigars, tobacco, or spirits. I should
 like to see the cigar or even the spirit that could
 have escaped his dreadful search. Crushed, angry,
 and hopeless, you press down your mangled wardrobe and sit on the top of your trunk until it can be
 locked. Then, more in sorrow than in anger, but a
 good deal in both, you oversee the placing of your
 luggage on the top of a cab, and you drive gloomily
 uptown.
   <p>The vehicle which bears you is commonly termed
a four-wheeler.   It is generally employed either to
convey baggage to and from railway stations, or to
carry small-pox patients to the hospital. It has all the
easy spring of a hay-wagon, and its dusty cushions,
you are apt to learn, are inhabited. The wheels are
thick and broad enough to support a ton weight, and
the windows rattle like those of the most approved
Broadway omnibus.     The unhappy animal that
laboriously hauls this remarkable vehicle was raised,
one would think, where shingle nails furnished the
most nutritious diet. He is thin, angular, and
weary; but by dint of severe and unremitting application of the whip he finally accomplishes his
task, and you reach the hotel.

   <p>Liverpool is smoky, dirty, and perturbed. It is
afflicted with a very bad attack of a malevolent disease called the Salvation Army, under which life
almost becomes a burden. In America this malady

<pb n=8>

  has not been seen at its worst. As a general thing,
  in the United States it takes no darker form than a
  brief procession of women and young men, who
  beat tambourines and sing silly songs. But here in
  England there is the added aggravation of brass
  bands and a howling mob of outside enthusiasts. A
  Liverpool brass band, made up of converts to the
  cause of the Salvationists, is by no means the most
  melodious combination on record. Such a wild
  gathering of irrelevant sounds one may rarely hear.
  It is about the same order of instrumentation which
  marks the local brass band of Kokomo, Ind., and
  it toots away in the service of the Lord to the great
  disturbance of ordinary mankind.
    <p>The crowd which follows it beneath the hotel
 windows is about as curious a gathering as one is
 likely to meet in a day's ride. It would hardly be
 necessary to go farther to see the lower side of life
 in the English cities. Ragged garments on men,
 women, and children, some with wooden shoes,
 some with their toes sticking out in a profusion not
 altogether picturesque, and some with no covering
 whatever for the feet; many with pinched faces and
 big eyes full of the eloquent pathos of hunger; some
 with bloated features, grimy hands, and brutal countenances; old men and women, young fellows and
 girls, children splashed with mud, but grinning at
 the sights and sounds, and one woman with a babe
 in arms, make up the mass of followers of this lusty
 mob of Salvationists. The noise, when by a hard
 struggle it rises over the blatant sounds of the band,
takes the form of mingled jeers, exclamations of rigid

<pb n=9>

fervor, and indecent comment. There would hardly
be allowed such a sight in New York or any other
fairly well-ordered American city.
    <p>Half a block away one of the Salvationists gets
 into an altercation with an outsider whose remarks
 have overreached the bounds of patience. He steps out
 of the ranks and thumps the irreverent fellow on the
 side of his head. The band stops tooting, and the
 Salvation warriors mingle with the other rabble in a
 crowd which forms a ring about the two combatants.
 Across the street a noble British policeman serenely
 looks up at the sky, down the road, over at the
 crowd, and up at the sky again. Interfere? Not he.
 The Liverpool policeman has better things to do
 than mix himself up in wrangles like this. If he
 were to meddle with such affairs he would be busy
 most of the time, and would probably pass the bulk
 of his career in the hospital; for there are fights
 innumerable in that classic city. In one short block,
 at 10 o'clock on a certain night, I saw three of these
 encounters going on simultaneously, to the intense
 joy of three large and discriminating audiences.
 One was between two men; the second was between
 a man and a woman, with the odds on the latter;
 and the third was between two women, with no
 odds at all. If they had been interfered with by
the police, there would probably have been a riot.
The Liverpool police do not think it is a part of
their business to get up riots- not in this way.
Meanwhile the fight between the Salvation Army
man and his traducer goes briskly on.   Both of
them are bleeding, but both bang away with great

<pb n=10>

  enthusiasm. Finally the outsider cries out that he
  has had enough, and skulks off, while his antagonist
  is rubbed down, and resumes his place in the ranks.
  The procession moves on in triumph, and the Salvation Army is vindicated.

     <p>Ocean travel develops some curious instincts.
 Two persons live for years in the same hotel, and
 even dine at the same table, utterly ignoring each
 other all the time, unless some chance introduction
 happens to bring them together.   Sometimes the
 same kind of folks are thrown together for seven or
 eight days on the same transatlantic steamer, and
 they don't speak there. At Liverpool they drift
 apart.   One goes to London, and the other to
Vienna. In ten days they meet in Paris. As soon
as the recognition occurs they rush up to each other,
shake hands with the utmost cordiality, and fall to
chattering away as though they had been intimates
for a long stretch of years. In due course they drift
back home, and become friends forever after. What
does it? Is there some secret influence in the boundless solitude of the ocean which draws men together
and knits them by the memory of having shared the
lingering spanning of the sea?   What else can
account for these friendships made in seven days and
lasting always? We seek in the growing years,
while science triumphs more and more over the
obstacles of nature, to make ourselves believe the
water-way between these two coasts is but a ferry,
the crossing which is an affair of no more than passing moment. But friendships are made and loves
are born along this journey which years on shore

<pb n=11>

could not have ripened, and time cannot efface.
The swiftest pace which steam can force, the greatest effort ingenuity can invent, to make this journey
a common place incident in the life of those who
travel, utterly fail to drive out that responsive
fellowship which is begotten where the skies circle
the vision, and the tossing waters tell us what trifles
we are after all.

 <p>TWO railways run up from the smoky city of
         Liverpool to the equally smoky city of London.
 One is the North-western and the other is the Midland.
 They make the journey in about the same time, and
 there is the hottest kind of rivalry between them.
 It is on the Midland that the scheme of introducing
 Pullman cars has been tried with commendable
 industry, but little success, for several years past.
 English travellers are not particularly struck with the
 Pullman scheme. They do not like being put in with
 a lot of other people. If they pay first-class prices
 they expect to get the first-class privilege of seclusion. So, when they want extra accommodations,
 they patronize the regular saloon carriage, which is
 a pretty good affair. It is divided into compartments, each of which has its own private
 toilet-room, and is otherwise desirable.
   <p>As a special inducement, the Midland road offers
free use of the Pullman cars to all holders of first-
class tickets, and agrees to send a special train to
London on the arrival of any steamer if fifty of the
passengers will agree to patronize it. The Northwestern offers nothing, but makes the journey a little
quicker, and secures the best part of the traffic. It


<pb n=13>
is the best laid and most finely equipped road in the
world.   It runs from Liverpool to London, two
hundred and two miles, in four and one-half hours,
and its trains, carrying the Irish mail to Holyhead and
the Scotch mail to Glasgow, are the fastest in the
world. The Midland road has the prettiest scenery
between Liverpool and London; but the Yankee
traveller will always go where the highest speed is
reached, and so scenery and Pullmans avail little
against the whirl and rush of the opposition line.
   <p>Arrived at the station in Liverpool, your cabman
wants just twenty-five cents more than is his due.
You blandly decline to pay it, and he takes what you
give him, but throws your trunk from the top of his
vehicle to the platform, -an operation that makes
the box shudder. A porter here appears. He is
the second edition of the one you have already interviewed in the same line. He wheels off your trunk
and your bag, and you proceed to buy your ticket to
London, which is five hours distant; price, about
seven dollars. The porter puts your trunk into a
little car and your valise into the box you are to
travel in. It is called a carriage, because it isn't a
carriage. You pay him twenty-five cents.   The
body of the car you enter is about seven feet high,
and is divided into several compartments, each of
which may be invaded from the side. One of these
is labelled <mentioned>"First class,"</mentioned> another in the same car
<mentioned>"Second class,"</mentioned> and another <mentioned>"Third class."</mentioned> There
is no material difference between them. The first
class carriage is upholstered in broadcloth, and the
second in haircloth or rep, while the third is apt to

<pb n=14>

be wooden as to its interior. But as between the
first and second class carriages there is no choice
whatever. In fact, the better part of Great Britain
travels second out of preference.   The second-class
passenger has the same spring, the same lights, and
the same space as his higher-priced brother. The
only palpable difference is that he doesn't pay as
much for it. There are eight seats in a compartment, -four facing the locomotive, and four backing
it. If you want a compartment to yourself you must
pay just eight fares.
    <p>Generelly speaking, you don't want it.
    <p>Shortly after starting, one begins to understand why
the English traveller always carries a bundle of shawls
or blankets with him. Just before the train begins
to move the porter has put two or three brass cans,
of about two gallons' dimensions each, into the
carriage. These are filled with hot water, and are
intended as heaters for the room you occupy. In
ten minutes they cease to heat; in twenty, they are
chilly; in an hour they are frozen; in two hours
one of them has burst, and the others are in danger.
You shiver, and wish you had known all this before.
You have been locked into your compartment, and
you can't get out, no matter how deeply you may
desire it. At the stations the guard lets you escape
for an instant, and expects you to fee him for your
liberty. Everybody expects to be feed in England.
If you ask any seedy stranger on the street where a
certain place is, nine times in ten he will go and show
you.   That will cost you from five to twenty-five
cents, according to the number of times you have


<pb n=15>
been bled that day, and the consequent state of liberality you are in. Anybody in England who does
anything for you expects tobe paid. Well-dressed people,
whom one would as soon slap in the face in America
as offer a fee, touch their hats when you give them
six cents and say, <q>Thanks, your 'onor.</q>   Even
the policemen will take four cents from you, salute
you, and say, <q>Thank you, sir.</q> Imagine offering
an American officer four cents for any information
he chose to give you! Yet that is a munificent
price for almost any commonplace breach of discipline in England. And it is a singular thing that
just as much service can be bought for four cents
there as can be purchased for $5.00. They take four
cents as a matter of course. If you give more, they
think you are either an idiot or a prince, with a
strong predisposition in favor of the idiot theory.
   <p>Upon arriving in London a porter seizes your
valise and rushes off with it to the baggage-car,
where you pick out your trunk. It doesn't make
any difference which one you select if you are quick
about it. The railway company gives no checks,
but is responsible to passengers for baggage lost
through the machinations of thieves. And a thief
would not be obliged to machinate much in order to
get away with the trunks of English passengers.
When the tourist's trunk has been picked out, the
porter takes it and hoists it to the top of another four-
wheeler. Twenty-five cents you pay him, as the
cab rolls away. A drive of a mile, or even of two
miles, costs a quarter only, which, considering that
the streets of London are so crooked that nobody but

<pb n=16>

the cabman can find the way with any degree of
certainty, is cheap.   I have heard of policemen
arresting people in London and walking them
around the city all night in a vain attempt to find
the station-house.
    <p>When you arrive at the Charing Cross Hotel,
 - which is about the worst in the world, - another
 porter takes your luggage and wheels it in. Through
 a little window, which opens on a hinge, one sees the
 hotel clerk. She is a lowering female, who answers
 you sharply, if she answers at all. She ultimately
 hands out a little ticket, on which the number of
 your room is written. Then a young man, clothed
 in ignorance and a dress suit, approaches you with a
 long book in his hand, such as American grocers'
 clerks take orders in. He asks your name, and
 pretends to write it down. He receives all the mail
 sent to the hotel, and, after one has gone a week
 without letters, and investigates matters, he finds
 that the fellow has written in the book something
 entirely different from what was told him. Moreover, he has written it so badly that to read it would
 puzzle the experts of a California divorce trial. The
 foreign visitor is conducted to the elevator, where
 the attendant closes the great iron doors, locks them,
 takes out the key, pulls down his cuffs, - sometimes
 he wears cuffs, - and asks what floor his passenger
wants. A minute or so after receiving his reply he
starts the elevator. When the destination is reached
the door is unlocked with a key and the search for
the room begins. After walking a long distance
one suddenly turns a corner and finds himself in the


<pb n=17>
  presence of several young women who are industriously sitting around a table. Unto one of these he
  gives his ticket, whereupon she lights a candle and
  starts off down the hall-way. He follows with that
  blind confidence which characterizes all Americans
  who are led by the gentler sex. On the way he
  reflects that his anticipation concerning the British
  chambermaid - anticipations born of the narratives
  of romantic travellers gone before--are not being
  realized. This, at least, was the subject of meditation of a fellow-passenger, whom, for the sake of his
  modesty, I will call Mr. Tompkins. Mr. Tompkins
  is a typical American, who has been in the habit of
  living at the best hotels and rolling in all the luxuries
  of American invention. After I had seen my luggage disposed of, on the night of my arrival (at a
  cost of fifty cents, between porter and chambermaid), I went down to Mr. Tompkins' room. I
  found him sitting in the middle of the apartment,
  gazing, with fury stamped on every feature, at a list
  of the rules and regulations pinned upon the wall.
Nine candles were burning on the mantle.
    <p><q>This is a nice place, aint it?</q> asked Mr. Tompkins, as I came in. <q>Oh, yes. Europe takes the
bakery, - especially London. Smells like a smokehouse, and blacks your fingers every time you touch
anything. How do you 'spose I got to this room?
Went up one flight of stairs, along a thundering
crooked hall-way, and down two more flights. No
other way to get here. Ingenious folks, these. Add
a new wing to their house, and instead of cutting a
door through on the ground floor they go upstairs

<pb n=18>

to do it. You ought to see my chambermaid. I
thought they were good-looking girls. This one is
the most exasperating old crate you ever saw.
What's worse, she winks at me in a horrible way.
She brought me in here and set one poor, solitary,
weary-looking candle down on the mantle. I asked
her where the gas was, and she looked at me as
though I had hurt her feelings. Then she told me
they didn't have gas in the house. So I had to make
her haul in a lot of candles. You might as well try
to see by the light of a glass diamond, as one of
those things.   She evidently thought I had gone
clean daft when I asked for the additional candles.
I got 'em, though, and kept getting 'em, till it was
light enough to see across the room. Look at that
washstand! Not a ghost of running-water anywhere about it. Just see that bed? Why, I wouldn't
ask a Chinaman to sleep on that.</q>
   <p>Mr. Tompkins was obviously irritated. I cannot
give the rest of his remarks. They were picturesque, but not polite. The bed he referred to was a
brass affair, and looked very slouchy. The top of it
resembled a mound of earth covered with snow, and
gradually sloping from the head to the foot of the
brass frame. It had no springs, and was as inflexible as a hay-wagon. I asked Mr. Tompkins what
he had to pay for all this luxury, and he broke out
again: <q>Eight and six a day, so this card says.
That's $2.12. And - thunderation! Just read this
thing. Upon my word, these people have a nerve.
Attendance, each person, 1<hi rend=italic>s.</hi> 6<hi rend=italic>d.</hi>, or, with private
sitting-room, 2<hi rend=italic>s.</hi> That is to say, they charge me

<pb n=19>

  from 37 cents to 50 cents a day for attendance which
  I don't want. That brings up the cost of the room to
  $2.50 or more a day. In New York it wouldn't sell
  for $1 a day. Breakfasts, plain, 50 cents; with eggs
  or cold meat, 67 cents; with broiled ham and eggs,
  75 cents; with plain fish, 75 cents. Fires, 50 cents
  a day; baths, 50 cents. Servants' beds, 50 cents a
  night, and meals $1.25 a day. It would cost a man
  $10 a day to live in this hotel, not half as well as he
  could live at the Sturtevant in New York, or almost
  any of the middling hotels in Boston, for $2.50.
  Just read these rules and regulations. They are
pretty. They ought to be stuffed, or pickled, or
something: <q>Accounts are presented weekly for
payment, except in special cases, when they will be
presented daily.</q> I 'spose the <mentioned>'special case'</mentioned> is
when a man hasn't more than $1,000 in his outstretched hand, and that girl downstairs thinks a
week's board here will bankrupt him. See here:
<q>Visitors occupying private apartments, intending
to leave the hotel, must give notice not later than
2 P.M., otherwise they will be charged for the following day.</q> Why don't they charge you for a
month, and be done with it? Oh, these people are
modest, and cheap, and simple. I like 'em. <q>Smoking permitted in the smoking-room only, and visitors
are requested to assist the manager in carrying out
this regulation.</q> Have a cigar? I'm going to get
even with this ranch somehow. Hanged if I don't
smoke till the place is blue!</q>
    <p>And, as Mr. Tompkins fell to work, he muttered
 a series of comments upon England and English

<pb n=20>

hotels; those same comments being of the most
gaudy and exhaustive kind. After awhile Mr.
Tompkins became calmer. <q>There's an American
bar, up here somewhere,</q> he said. <q>Let's go and
see it. My eyes ache for something American, and
I don't care what it is. I would give $40 for the
scent of a New York street-car.</q>
   <p>We went to the American bar. But Mr. Tompkins was not soothed by what transpired there. We
passed through the end of a British bar in getting to the
American establishment. The British bar was fully
one hundred feet long, and presided over byvery pretty
girls. The space in front of the counter was packed
with men, three or four rows deep, all struggling to
get in a word with the barmaids. Such a spectacle
would make a sensation in America. The British
dude's idea of heaven is to stand for hours leaning
against the bar, sipping a lemon squash (which is
the civilized name for lemonade), and gazing in
mute idiocy at the girl who stands on the other
side. Spiers &amp; Pond have these establishments all
over England. They run a restaurant and bar at
every important railway station in the kingdom, and
employ a fabulous number of girls. If the English
bar is a curiosity to an American, the American bar
is still more so. It was also crowded when we went
in, and seemed to justify Mr. Tompkins' theory that
the entire population of London was striving to make
itself thoroughly inebriated, so as to drown its misery.
Not being able to reach the bar, we called a waiter.
Mr. Tompkins said, <q>At last, we'll have something
American. Give me some Bourbon whiskey.</q>

<pb n=21>

<p><q>We 'aven't any burrb'n, sir,</q> replied the waiter.
    <p><q>Then bring some rye.</q>
    <p><q>But we 'aven't anythink in the way of American
 whiskey, sir.</q>
    <p>Mr. Tompkins' face fell. <q>The deuce you say!</q>
 he exclaimed, as the bitter truth began to dawn upon
 him. <q>Then, what in blazes have you got?</q>
    <p>The waiter laid a bill of fare before Mr. Tompkins, who looked it over, glanced at me, then looked
 up at the ceiling, and said: <q>If this thing goes
 much farther, I shall be a raving maniac. Just
 listen to this, for a list of American drinks: <q>Short
 drinks, square meal, prairie oyster, corpse reviver,
 our swizzle, bosom caresser, flash of lightning,
 alabazam, flipflap, heap of comfort, rattlesnake,
 sherry blush, fairies' kiss, ladies' blush, coolleen
 bawn, pick-me-up, saddle rock, knickebein.</q> What
 do you think of that?</q>
   <p>I thought Mr. Tompkins was gently <mentioned>"guying"</mentioned>
 me, and I looked over the list myself. But he
 wasn't. There they were, in cold type, staring me
 unblushingly in the face. As we strolled out into
 the street again, Mr. Tompkins said: <q>Wasn't I
 right when I said London was a glittering fraud?
 Isn't it a daisy? Don't she beat any swindle you
 ever ran against? Aint she a regular brace game
from the word go?</q>
    <p>But Mr. Tompkins was becoming incoherent. I
 took him home and put him to bed.

<ITEM>Modern Ways O' Foggy Nights.</ITEM>
</LIST>

 <p>IT is very rarely hot in London; probably for the
     reason that the sun does not often get a chance
to shine there. The atmosphere is seldom clear.
There is either an overhanging body of clouds
precipitating or threatening to precipitate extensive
showers, or the air is full of heavy smoke that makes
the eyes smart, peppers the clothing with grains of
soot, and coats the lungs with some sort of an atmospheric sediment which gives one a constant taste of
tar.   The best part of what is known as the
<mentioned>"season"</mentioned> in London comes along in June, when
the theatres are going at the top of their speed, and
the social circles of the great metropolis are in their
maddest whirl. At that time of the year, when all
things in America, excepting the mint-julep business, are practically at a stand-still, England is in
its merriest mood.   London is full of people, the
streets are crowded, and the town takes on its
brightest air. I suppose this is because the summer
atmosphere is the only variety of that commodity
which is fit to be endured. Along in October the
fogs begin to come on. The stranger who has seen
one London fog is quite willing to let the inhabitants
keep all the rest of that sort to themselves. I distinctly

<pb n=23>
remember my first experience with this sort
of thing. I awoke in the morning wondering that
I could no longer sleep, since, by the condition of
the light, it was apparently not later than six o'clock.
The room was about as dimly illuminated as it
would be at the time of evening which we all call
dusk. Finding it impossible to slumber longer I
rolled out of bed, lighted a match, and looked at the
clock. The hands marked the hour of ten in the
forenoon. I strove to peer out of the window. It
was useless. I might quite as easily have tried to
look through a yellow blanket. Now and then I
could hear a cab roll cautiously by in the street below, but I could not see the light. When I turned
up the gas in my room there seemed to be a quite
perceptible haze in the apartment itself. I found
the whole house excessively cold, though the thermometer registered 45° above zero.   Hot fires in
every room failed to make the place comfortable.
The dampness in the air struck straight to the bone.
I went around shivering all day. In the afternoon
I was seized with the desire to see if my servant had
not been chaffing me when she said the street lamp
in front of my door was lighted. Not the faintest
glimmer could be seen from the window. So I
groped my way down the walk, through the gate,
and across the sidewalk. When I finally found the
lamp-post and looked up, I could just barely discern
a dull, red tinge in the fog overhead. Still unsatisfied, I climbed up the post, and when I had
reached a point within a foot of the jet, I found that
the gas was really burning.   But I would not

<pb n=24>

have believed it when half-a-dozen feet away.
Coming down I had some difficulty in reaching
the house again.   Three or four times I stepped
from the walk. The sensation was peculiar.   It
was not quite like walking in complete darkness,
for the atmosphere, instead of being black, was of
a yellowish-gray hue. But it was absolutely impenetrable. There was more smoke than fog in it, and
my eyes ran tears, and became badly irritated. Indeed, while I was in London, the action of the
atmosphere on my organs of sight was such that I
was for the first and last times in my life obliged to
wear glasses when reading or writing. As soon
as I got back to America I tossed the glasses aside,
and I have never required them since. The next
morning after the black fog we had a lighter time
of it, the difference being that the air was dead
white. One could see through it dimly for ten or
twelve feet, and it looked as though a huge white
sheet, surrounding the observer at an equal distance,
cut off the sight from objects beyond. One night I
went to the Savoy Theatre, when the fog was settling
down, and sitting in the balcony I could not easily
distinguish the faces of the actors on the stage.
These fogs penetrate everywhere, and they are
dreadfully chilling.   They are caused, I should
think, by the dampness and cold, which beat the
smoke down to the ground. It is the same sort of
smoke we in this country find in cities like Chicago,
St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Pittsburg, where soft coal
smothers everything.
   <p>They tell me that when the 'bus-drivers of London

<pb n=25>

  see a fog coming they put for home as fast as they
  can urge their horses, and if they are overtaken on
  the way they simply come to anchor and wait till
  the clouds roll by, so to speak. The curious part of
  it is that from the top of an omnibus the street lamps
  are so distorted by the heavy fogs that nine times
  in ten the driver guides his horses straight upon the
  sidewalk. Citizens who are caught out in these
  fogs seldom try to reach home. Years ago a great
  horde of boys used to make money by guiding
  people about the city through the mist by means of
  torches, and numbers of old houses still have iron
  frames beside the front steps where the flambeaux
  used to be set up for safe-keeping and ready reference.
    <p>But the modern Londoner has considerably improved on the old plan. When he is overtaken by
 a fog nowadays, he doesn't try to get home. He
 simply finds the nearest tavern, and puts in a night
 of it in the tap-room. This illustrates a singular
 human gift. I have met scores of men who could
 not find their way home; but I have yet to make the
 acquaintance of one whose instinct in every time
 of need will not lead him to a comfortable barroom. This London atmosphere must be dreadfully
 unhealthy. In point of fact, when you have ridden
 all over the city, and have seen several great buildings conspicuously labelled, <mentioned>"Consumptives'
 Hospital,"</mentioned> you begin to realize the hollowness of the
 boast that the London climate, though uncomfortable, is bracing and strengthening. I am not at all
up in the statistics on this point, but I doubt if there

<pb n=26>

is another city on the face of the earth where
pulmonary complaints are as prevalent as they are
in London. At any rate, I never saw another place
where the conditions made it necessary to keep up
all the time a great number of hospitals for
the exclusive treatment of diseases of the throat and lungs.

<ITEM>The Only Successful Way.</ITEM>
</LIST>

<p>TO live well in London is nothing less than an art.
It is an art, moreover, that is not learned all
at once. The native Englishman is content to reside five
or ten miles from his place of business. He loves
the suburbs, and he is about right.   The suburbs
are a considerable improvement on London.  The
stranger in the English metropolis goes in for lodgings
somewhere within a reasonable distance
of the theatres and centres of business. He is not
long in finding a place in which to live. He consents
to live in it, not because it is fit for that
purpose, but because he is in London, and he thinks
it is customary. The London lodging-house, such as
American visitors are steered into, has not much to
recommend it; and anybody who tells you it is
cheap, or clean, or alluring, is a--well, he ought
to be a politician.
<p>If you want a couple of rooms in London, down
near the spot where your countrymen most do congregate,
you can get them for three guineas a week -
which is $15.75. They are up two flights of stairs
and have an ingrain carpet on the floor. The furniture

<pb n=28>
is about a century old, and some of it is very
shaky on its legs. If it were two centuries old, and
had no legs at all, the price of the room would be
$50 a week.     They venerate old furniture over
there. Somehow they seem to think chairs and
sofas were made to venerate, and not to sit upon.
There is a table in the middle of the room, the top
of which is about six feet wide. It has a red cover
with a big splash of ink on it and a hole in one
corner, where some hungry boarder has had breakfast. The ceiling is smoky, and in one place a slab
of it is peeling off. You put your hand on the
wall, and you find that the paper is not attached to
the plastering at all. It has been that way for two
hundred and fifty years, and the owner of the property
would think you were insane if you were to alter it
in any way. The carpet is red. It is not new.
The stitching is out of it in several places. Through
one of these you can see what you think is another
carpet. You are right. It <emph>is</emph> another carpet. When
the red one was put down it did not occur to the
landlady to take up the other.   In fifteen or twenty
years she will get a third carpet, even more hideous
than the one at present in use, and she will put that
down in all the dirt, on top of the other two. Over
the table there hang two gas-burners. They are a
shallow   mockery.   Long ago the thumbscrews
rusted into their places. Before that the pipes had
been plugged with soap. That is, apparently, what
they do with their soap in London. They do not
use it on their windows, and not often on their hands,
They must put it all into their gas-pipes. In the


<pb n=29>
back-room there is a brass bedstead, upon which are
divers and sundry mattresses, surmounted by a
feather-bed and a soiled spread. The general slope
of the arrangement is toward the foot. It gives you
an easy consciousness that you will sleep standing
up. Over in the corner there is a washstand, with
pitchers and bowls on top, and an unblushing and
affluent display of other crockery underneath. There
is a straw matting on the floor, so as to make it
pleasant for you to get out of bed barefooted on a
cold morning. There are curtains in the front room
and none in the bedroom. This is a wise dispensation of the landlady. You will find it healthier to
sleep in a light room than a dark one. It is more
difficult, but it is healthier. That is what the landlady tells you. I know a man who went to London
to economize and write for newspapers, and otherwise prepare himself for the lunatic asylum, who was
simple enough to hire a suite of rooms just like
these. This man had hunted all over the vicinity,
and could do no better. He was foolish. He should
have gone to the almshouse at first.   He lived there
a week. Then he got his bill.     It read: Apartments, 63 shillings; fires, 14 shillings; attendance,
4 shillings; candles, 2 shillings; breakfasts, 14 shillings; total, &pound;4, 17 shillings. Which, being
translated, is $24.25 for what in America would have
cost him not more than $14 at the outside. He had
been taking his breakfasts in his rooms, not as a
matter of luxury, but for the sake of economy. He
had tried breakfasting in restaurants. That was why
he ended by taking this meal in his rooms, on the



<pb n=30>

  table with the corner chewed out of its red
  cover.
     <p>This man-this weak, foolish vessel -went out
  to breakfast one morning at ten o'clock. Being a
  generous and forgiving person, he selected the place
  where he had dined the night before. Some of the
  shutters were still on the windows. He went in,
  however. The long, narrow apartment was full of
  dust, the chairs were all piled upon the tables, and
  a man was sweeping the dry floor with a dry broom
  and the most bewildering energy. The prospect was
  not promising, but not altogether cheerless. It was
  clear proof that people did sometimes sweep in
  London. The dust was a little too thick for weak
  lungs, however, and the stranger went out. He
  walked to several other restaurants and couldn't get
  in at all. So he drifted back again, reflecting that
  it was probably a holiday of one kind or another.
  By this time the tables were partly covered, and one
  or two of the waiters had arrived. The stranger sat
  down and looked around. Nobody took the slightest notice of him, and after awhile he rapped for a
waiter. Then one of them came, staring at him
unpleasantly. The American said he would take
breakfast. The waiter replied that they did not serve
anything until twelve. Everybody breakfasted at
home. Well, yes, he would try and get something
for the gentleman, but it was against the rules. He
departed, having left the suggestion of an extra fee.
By and by he came back with fried sole, eggs, coffee,
rolls, and a chop. The American ate voraciously,
and called for the bill. His waiter reckoned it up

<pb n=31>
rapidly in his head, at seven shillings, or $1.75,
and the foolish stranger paid him a shilling besides.
Two or three days later he discovered that he had
been overcharged by three shillings. Thus it cost
him just $1 of stealings and fees to learn to eat
breakfast at home. This same man made a nice
disturbance in a restaurant at dinner one night when
he first arrived. He had been warned to keep on
the look-out for overcharges, and by the time his
meal was finished he was in a good mood for that
sort of thing. He had arrived in the restaurant at
five o'clock, and had called for a bill of fare. It
was printed on a sheet of paper the size of a page
of an ordinary newspaper. Half the items were in
red ink. This indicated that they were special
dishes for that day. He had soup, and ordered
boiled mutton in red ink. The waiter consulted the
cook, and said the mutton would be done in three
minutes. The stranger waited. In ten minutes the
waiter came back and said the cook had concluded
not to serve any more mutton that day. The American said he would have a lamb-chop - also in red
ink. Another consultation and another disappointment. There were no lamb-chops. Would he try
a <mentioned>"fillet"</mentioned> of beef, rare?   Yes, he would. The
waiter looked rather ashamed as he came back this
time. He had no need to speak; the truth was
written in his face, -there was no <mentioned>"fillet."</mentioned> The
American was angry, but calm. He said:-
   <p><q>Bring me anything you've got in the ranch, I
don't care what it is, only don't keep me in suspense; I don't want to make up my mouth for any

<pb n=32>

more things and not get them. Produce anything
you have.</q>
    <p>He received a fair sort of a dinner, but he was out
 of sorts all the time. When it came to making out
 his bill, you may imagine how carefully he watched
 his man putting down the items. As the waiter
 wrote, he talked. This is how it ran:
    <p><q>One soup, one radishes and butter, one new
potatoes, one turbot, one steak, one asparagus, one
peas, one Bass'-how many breads?</q>
    <p><q>What?</q>
    <p><q>How many breads?</q>
    <p><q>None of your d--d business.</q>
    <p><q>Well, I'll have to charge for two.</q>
    <p><q>Charge? You don't charge for bread?</q>
    <p><q>Yes, sir. A penny for each piece.</q>
    <p><q>Humph ! Well, I had one.</q> This very sulkily.
    <p><q>How many butters?</q>
    <p><q>Eh?</q>
    <p><q>How many butters?</q>
    <p><q>Butters! Oh, you charge for butter? Ah! I
see. Two butters. There's nothing mean about
you. Oh, no. Hold on there, don't add her up
yet; you've forgotten the salt.   I had some on my
radishes.</q>
   <p><q>No charge for salt.</q>
   <p><q>What? Is there anything you don't charge for
in this pleasing country? Perhaps you want to tuck
it on for that glass of water. No? Well, this is
simply paralyzing liberality.</q>
   <p>And he went out muttering. This actually occurred in a restaurant where fully 500 people dine

<pb n=33>
every day. I know, because I have seen the man.
I see him in the mirror every morning.
   <p>But there are ways of living cheaply and with
comparative comfort in London. I have seen all of
them tried. The lodging-house is a failure. There
is another system where you engage rooms, buy your
own groceries, do your own marketing, and allow
your landlady to perpetrate your cooking for you.
She charges you nothing for this kindness, and you
look upon her as a philanthropist.   But, after a
while, it begins to dawn on you that the entire household is living on your groceries and your marketing.
After that you generally move, and a while later you
hit upon the right idea.   By advertising in the
papers I managed to find a cosey little furnished
house about two miles from the centre of business. It
had a conservatory full of grapes, rooms prettily furnished and everything comfortable. The rent was $10
a week. In New York the same thing would have
been $50. The servant, who was a pretty fair cook,
was glad to be paid $5 a month, and the whole
expense of running that establishment was not beyond $30 a week. The English have reduced living
expenses to a low limit. A small family can breakfast simply but satisfactorily at home for less than
fifty cents.   There are dainty little articles in the
market, for this repast, which cost little or nothing,
and which cannot be found at all in America. We
are behind in some things. We don't think so, as a
rule, but we are.

   <p>I met Mr. Tompkins on the Strand one morning.
      He stood on the curb-stone, opposite the American Exchange, and was sopping some blood from his
neck with a blue handkerchief. I had not seen him
for nearly a month, during which interval he had
been on the Continent. But he had apparently lost
none of his American disgust for London. As I
approached he was muttering several things that
would not look well on paper, especially in a book
that might be seen by officials addicted to the suppression of profane literature.
   <p><q>Hello, old man!</q> he said, effusively, as I
dawned upon him. <q>Glad to see you. You're the
first thing American I've set eyes on for a month.
You don't shave, do you ? Bright young man. Keep
out of that habit, or get out of London. I just came
from the barber's shop, and I am too weak from loss
of blood to do justice to the occasion. Had my hair
cut, too. Look at it. Why, my head resembles a
corrugated iron roof.   All this was done by a boy
fourteen years old. That's the kind of barbers they
have here. By the time they get to be twenty they're
so steeped in crime that they have to be transported
or hanged. Has it been raining this morning?</q>

<pb n=35>
     <p><q>No. Why do you ask?</q>
     <p><q>Just look at that street. I thought London was
 such a clean place. How's anybody going to get
 across there?   I've been figuring on it for ten
 minutes. There's a lot of mail for me over at the
 Exchange, but I'm hanged if I want to get all muddy
 going after it!</q>
    <p>I did not wonder that Mr. Tompkins felt slightly
 annoyed with the street. Although the sun was shining brightly, and had been since early morning, the
 wooden pavement of the Strand was covered with a
 coating of mud about two inches deep. It was of
 the consistency of glue, and twice as nasty. The
 quality was that which flies in every direction when
 a horse drops his foot into it suddenly. Half the
 people who passed us on the sidewalk were bespattered.   Pretty soon a watering-cart came along,
 sprinkling away at full speed.
    <p><q>Hi! there!</q> called Mr. Tompkins.  <q>What
the devil are you doing?</q>
    <p><q>A-layin' of the dust,</q> responded the driver.
    <p>Mr. Tompkins was speechless for a few minutes.
 The case was too deep even for his expressive vocabulary. After a while, he said: <q>Well, that's the
 juiciest old dust ever I saw. Let's ford her. There's
 no other chance to get across.</q>
    <p>On the other side we learned from a policeman
 that it was a London custom to turn the Strand
 into a sheet of mud every time a heavy wind might
 happen to be blowing, in order to keep the foul dust
 of the street from flying into people's eyes and noses.
    <p><q>I'd rather take my chances with the dust,</q> volunteered

<pb n=36>

Mr. Tompkins. <q>If the wind turns into
a gale, and the Strand gets a heavy sea on, the Lord
only knows what will happen. I'll tell you what,</q> he
added, when he had finished reading his letters, <q>it's
a holiday here. They call it Bank holiday. Everybody goes out into the country on holidays in
England; so lets you and I have a fly at it. Where shall
we go ?</q>
    <p>We consulted guide-books and maps, and then
 asked questions. Finally we settled on Hampton,
 and learned that we could get there by the river
 steamers, which were advertised to sail that day.
    <p><q>That's the scheme for me,</q> observed Mr. Tompkins. <q>I want to see their Thames River. I've
 heard of it long enough, the Lord knows. It doesn't
 look like any great shakes of a river from the bridges;
 but that isn't a fair place to judge from. Besides,
 the advertisement says you can get a return ticket on
 the boats for one and six, and that's cheap, for fourteen miles each way.</q>
   <p>We went down to the river and found a place at
the landing which said, <q>Pay here.</q> Mr. Tompkins went and asked for two return tickets to
Hampton. The man in the window replied that he only
sold tickets as far as Chelsea. Mr. Tompkins reminded him that the company advertised to send
boats to Hampton.   The man observed that he
thought not. Mr. Tompkins produced the newspaper. Man said he could get the Hampton tickets
at Chelsea. Mr. Tompkins said it was a so-and-so
queer practice to advertise round-trip tickets from
Charing Cross, and then not have them on hand.


  <pb n=37>
  Man soothingly told Mr. Tompkins he could get the
  proper reduction at Chelsea. There must have been
  a mistake. Mr. Tompkins bought tickets to Chelsea
  for three pence each. On the way up he was communicative, but rather abusive of English customs.
  The affair with the ticket-man had nettled him. The
  boat had a long, sharp hull, with paddle-wheels.
  She was painted red below the water-line, and black
  above it. Her deck had a row of seats all around
  the sides, and a double row down the middle. To
  get into the cabin it was necessary to go down a
  companion-way of great steepness and narrowness.
  This apartment was lighted with bull's-eye windows.
  The vessel was steered by a man in the stern, who
  had a rudder-wheel to turn, and the engineer was
  guided by a man who stood on a <mentioned>"bridge,"</mentioned> just over
  the engine-room, and gave his orders in a loud voice.
    <p><q>Nice, ingenious lot, aint they?</q> sneered Mr.
 Tompkins.     <q>It wouldn't occur to them to save
 labor by having a pilot-house in the bow, with a
 man in it to steer, and signal the engineer, too. Oh,
 no; their grandfathers had it in this way, and they
 must have it so now. That's why they rig up a
 river-boat like an old-fashioned ocean steamer, only
 dirtier. There's mighty little room for comparison
 between this and an East River boat in New York.
 Over there we'd feel rather shaky about riding in
 such a tub as this. In rainy weather the passengers
 have to go below into that nasty cabin or get wet.
 It wouldn't be like an Englishman to think of having
 an awning on his old boat. There are some rather
fine buildings along here, but the river doesn't


<pb n=38>

amount to much. Why, it's full of mud, and all
roiled up. There can't be much water, and- I say,
look at that.</q>
   <p>Passing down with the tide were three or four
scows, totally without any visible motive power.
They were heavily loaded, and spread pretty well
across the river. Each of them had a man at the
rudder, and another at the bow with a long oar in
his hands. Some of the scows were going down the
stream bows first, some stern first, and some broadside on. One had a gunny-bag hoisted upon a short
stick amidships, as a sort of satirical sail.
    <p><q>That's a new   style of yachting,</q> said Mr.
 Tompkins.  <q>Probably it's the way they do it over
 here. Do you know what a Bank holiday is? No
 more did I till that infamous barber got hold of me
 this morning. It seems that an old chap named
 Lubbuck was Lord Mayor, or something, and took
 it into his head that the bank clerks were an overworked lot, because they were generally locked up
 at their desks on other people's holidays. So he set
 himself to work and got a bill through one of their
 law-machines, allowing these chaps four holidays in
 each year. This is one of the four, and you can bet
 the rest of the people get their whack at it. Holidays
   are about all you run against over here.   Good
   Friday was a legal holiday. Saturday was illegal,
   but observed just the same. Sunday was, of course,
   a holiday, and here we are on bank clerks' day.
   What's the result? Everybody in the lower classes
   drunk as a stewed owl. Why, it will take England
   a week to get sober. But you wouldn't think those

   <pb n=39>
   scows would be allowed sailing around with the
   tide like that, would you, now? There's a lot more
   of 'em, and I'm blessed if one isn't going bang into
   the bridge! Don't seem to mind it, though. Hello!
   Down goes our smoke-stack on a hinge, to clear the
   bridge, and slap go a couple of quarts of cinders into
   the eyes of the people astern. That's more fun than
   I've had since we landed.</q>
     <p>Leaving Mr. Tompkins in serene but baleful contemplation of the people, who were rubbing away at
  the cinders as best they could, I took a look at the
  river banks. Certainly human skill could go but
  little farther in cleansing and solidifying the lining
  of a stream. Great solid walls of masonry run for
  miles along each shore, and, where the tide was
  down, a great expanse of gravel told of sanitary precautions carried into the very bed of the stream.
  Bridges span the river about an eighth of a mile
  apart, the most of them great rugged bands of steel
  or piles of granite that were built to withstand the
  wear and tear of ages. Along the shore to the right
  there is a road well paved and lined for a while with
  residences facing the Thames, then warehouses, and
  then residences again. In front of them, near the
  water, a long garden, like an emerald chain, broken
  into links by the cross streets coming down to the
  water. Here and there stone steps come to the
  brink, and near all of these men with boats to let ply
  their successful trade. In no other city have I ever
  seen rowing so persistently followed as a method of
amusement. Pretty much everybody in London pulls
an oar in moments of relaxation from the duties of

<pb n=40>

life. It is a sensible and healthful method of recreation, and gives strength, as well as pleasure, to
those who follow it. On the day of the University
race I am confident that I saw 10,000 row-boats, at
least, between Putney and Mortlake. While I was
thinking of all these affairs we arrived at Chelsea.
By this time the little black steamer was packed to
suffocation, and, when all the people crowded over
to the shore side to get off, she looked for a minute
like capsizing. After giving up our tickets, Mr.
Tompkins went to the window and asked to pay his
fare to Hampton. The official looked bewildered,
and said there was no boat to Hampton.
      <p><q>There isn't?</q>   Mr. Tompkins began to look
  black. <q>Then what the dash, blank, double-blank-
  dash, does your thus-and-so company mean by advertising boats to Hampton? What in - (?) [ * * *
  and &brvbar; &sect; * % # ,- and .... sort of a swindle is
  this concern, any way?</q>
      <p><q>Boat to Hampton,</q> said the man, imperturbably,
   <q>left at 10 this morning. Sell you a ticket to Kew.</q>
      <p><q>Evidently know your Q's, if you don't know
   your P's,</q> responded Mr. Tompkins, hotly. <q>A
   nice lot you are around here. You'd steal hoe-cake
   from a blind coon, I believe. Advertise boats to
   Hampton, start one off in the middle of the night,
   when every honest man is asleep, and then try to
   send your victims to Q. I've half a mind to reach in
   through that window and haul you out by the neck.</q>
   But as two hundred pounds of man only grinned at
   the thought of being dragged through a six-inch
   window, Mr. Tompkins and I strode across the

<pb n=41>
bridge to the shore. We leaned over the stone parapet for some time, gazing into the river in gloomy
silence. <q>Never mind,</q> said Mr. Tompkins, after
awhile; <q>it aint much of a river, anyhow. We'll go
by the Underground. I understand that beats our
elevated road all to grass. But what I can't comprehend is why the deuce the company advertises to take
you there at all. It doesn't make anything out of
such a transaction.</q> As we got into the cab and
started for the station, my companion fell into a
brown study. Suddenly he brightened up. <q>I've
got it!</q> he exclaimed.
   <p><q>Got what?</q> I asked.
   <p><q>The solution of all that infamous swindling to
get sixpence. The company set out to send boats to
Hampton all day, and, when it found the thing wasn't
going to pay, it just hauled off and only sent one.
That's why it wouldn't sell me an excursion-ticket
down at that first place. It knew mighty well the
thing was a swindle, and it just made up its mind
that it would get part of my money, anyhow. It is a
lot of- here we are. Now we shall see a big thing.
Prepare to observe the elevated railroad knocked out
of sight.</q>
   <p>Mr. Tompkins approached the ticket-office and
asked the fare to Hampton.
   <p>MAN. - <q>Don't go to Hampton.</q>
   <p>MR. T. - <q>Then how do I get there?</q>
   <p>MAN. - <q>Can't tell. Take you to Kew.</q>
   <p>MR. T.- <q>How far is Kew from Hampton?</q>
   <p>MAN. - <q>Nowhere near it.</q>
   <p>MR. T. - <q>Don't you go near Hampton?</q>

<pb n=42>

   <p>MAN. - <q>Don't know. Have a ticket to Kew?</q>
   <p>MR. T. - <q>Oh! take your Kew and give me a rest,
will you? What I want is Hampton, and not Kew,
or R, or S, or any of the rest of the alphabet. If I
wanted to go to Brazil and couldn't get there, is it
likely I'd be anxious to be taken to the Arctic Circle
instead?</q>
   <p>MAN. - <q>Caun't say, sir.</q>
   <p>MR. T. - <q>You caun't, eh? Well, blast your eyes!
if I had you out here one second and a quarter, I'd
show you.</q>
   <p>POLICEMAN. -<q>What's the trouble here?</q>
   <p>MR. T. - <q>Now we shall find out something at last.
This idiot here don't know the way to Hampton!</q>
   <p>POLICEMAN. - <q>No more do I.</q>      (To passing
stranger.) <q>How do you go to 'Ampton?</q>
   <p>PASSING STRANGER.- <q>Choynge at Twicken'am,
Oi should soy.</q>
   <p>MR. T. - <q>Here, you bullet-headed scoundrel, give
me two tickets for Twickenham.</q>
   <p>MAN. - <q>Two-and-six.</q>
   <p>Mr. Tompkins was beginning to perspire. But
he walked down the stairs and along to the platform
numbered <mentioned>"Four,"</mentioned> as the man at the gate bade him.
We were in a long, arched railroad station underneath the street, and lighted through a glass roof that
opened into the roadway above, and was there inclosed by an iron fence. There were about ten tracks
in this station. Presently a train came in by our
platform.
   <p><q>This the Twickenham train?</q> asked Mr. Tompkins, urbanely.

<pb n=43>
    <p><q>No,</q> said the porter, and passed on, slamming
 the doors on the sides of the cars.
    <p><q>Glad I asked,</q> was the observation of my acquaintance.   After twenty minutes another train
 came along, and Mr. Tompkins asked the same
 question. He also received the same reply. He
 was about to say something of an ornate character,
 when a French gentleman, standing by, told him in
 broken English that he could go as far as Turnham
 Green on this train. He added an apology for not
 being able to speak English fluently.
    <p><q>Don't learn,</q> said Mr. Tompkins, with animation, as he bundled himself into the car and sat
down. <q>Or, if you've got to learn English, - need
it in your business, you know, - don't learn it from
these people. They only speak half of any word
they use. Fact is, they're so gloriously mean that
they bite off the other half and swallow it. They
hate to part with anything they've got.</q>
   <p>Mr. Tompkins was comparatively silent for some
time, contenting himself with calling my attention
to the door-fastenings, and pointing out that it would
save the wages of several porters at each station if
the doors were supplied with spring locks. We went
from the station straight into a tunnel, through which
we lumbered slowly and laboriously along. The
only other occupant of our compartment was the
Frenchman before alluded to, and he seemed to understand the situation, and expect something in the
way of an explosion from Mr. Tompkins. It came
after a while, but more gradually than usual:--
   <p><q>There are things about this underground scheme



<pb n=44>

that you can't help noticing. In the first place the
light don't hurt your eyes with its glare. In the
second, if you've got any moths around your clothes,
they are going to leave. This smoke would drive
any well-bred moth out of the middle of an oak
plank. It may kill the man, but it will make the
moth rise up and move, and don't you forget it.
You might as well try to breathe in a gas-retort.
But what you come in here for is recreation, not
breath. You will smell like a flitch of bacon when
you get out, if you get out at all. Still, you won't
know it, because your lungs will be coated with
smoke by that time, to say nothing of the cinders
and dust and stuff you have inhaled. Then, if you
are alone, and some cut-throat gets into the same
compartment, he can carve you up in the most
elegant style. He won't have to hurry, so he can
make a good job of it, - something to be proud of
as long as he lives. Should the porter neglect to
close the door, it will fly open and go scooting down
the platform, knocking people down like ninepins.
You are bound to rest in one of these cars, because
it is too dark to read, and there's nothing to look
out of the window for. When you come to a station you might think it would be a part of the
guard's duty to call out the name of the place. Not
any. In America they would find that sort of thing
necessary. But the English are so smart that they
know by instinct when they get to the right spot.
As a matter of form, you will notice the railroad
company has put up a little board at each end of the
station with the name of the place on it. You don't

<pb n=45>
see the one as you fly into the station, because it is
never in the place you look for it. And, as for the
one on the other end, of course you can't see that
until the train is pulling out of the place where you
wanted to stop. They don't dare hurry the train
along, because they can't see far ahead, and there
might be a collision. Oh, it's a staving old system,
I tell you. Knocks the elevated road silly.</q>
    <p>By this time we had reached Turnham Green,
 where we waited for twenty minutes, while Mr.
 Tompkins drew comparisons between the game of
 cricket that was being played on the Common and
our own national pastime, base-ball. He had gradually worked himself up to that pitch of discontent
which leaves no possibility of seeing good in anything. After a while we learned, quite by accident,
that we should have to change cars again at Richmond. The railway authorities did not tell us
anything of the kind. Our French friend gave us the
information. So we took our train and rode on to
Richmond.     There we waited forty minutes, by
which time it was a quarter to four. Then we went
on to Twickenham. When the man took our tickets
at the gate, we asked him how long it would be
until a Hampton train came along. He said the one
we had just stepped out of was on its way there,
and that another would be along at 6.20. It was
just four o'clock when this information was imparted
to us. Mr. Tompkins had exhausted his stock of
expletives in seven minutes.   We learned that
Hampton was three miles distant, and that if we
took a carriage and rode over there and straight


<pb n=46>
back we might possibly catch the 5.05 train to the
city. If we missed it we should be caged up here
until 7.22. We had left Charing Cross for Hampton
long before noon, and here we were three miles
short of it at 4 P.M. If we returned at the same
rate of speed we might get back by midnight. The
total distance from Charing Cross to Hampton is
14 1/2 miles. Consequently we had put in half a day
in covering eleven miles and one-half. So we gave
it up.   There was a funny side to it all, and I
laughed. There may have been something hysterical
in my merriment, for Mr. Tompkins looked at me
curiously and then pityingly. <q>Poor fellow!</q> said
he, <q>it has been too much for him. His reason is
unseated,</q> and not another word could I get out of
him all the way home.
   <p>Thus ended our bank holiday. There had been
no great amount of jollity about it, but we had
learned several things about English railways and
steamboats. We had been taught that it cost an
average of five cents a mile to travel on British cars;
that if one wanted to find anything out he must
know it beforehand, and that railway servants here
are hired simply to open and shut doors, and do not
consider it any part of their duty to give passengers
either information or courteous treatment.   The
system at its best is totally inferior in every respect
to that of the loosest and poorest railroad in America.

</LIST>

<p>TO Parliament the average British commoner is
        not elected because he has any ability in any
direction, but because he belongs to the party that
is strongest in the particular district where he
chooses to run, and because he has money enough
to pay for the honor. Not that a man may directly
purchase a membership, but the election expenses
are heavy in a land where there is little violent
difference of opinion, and only the well-to-do can
afford the luxury of adding M.P. to his name. I
have only to say that Mr. Gladstone's son, a young
man who has yet to develop any remarkable genius,
is a member, and Mr. Ashmead Bartlett is another.
I don't mean to disparage either of these gentlemen,
I merely desire to point out that the former is still
quite a young man, who has not yet outgrown the
red-necktie period of juvenility, and who, whatever
latent ability he may possess, has not come into that
intellectual full-bloom which we expect to find in
a holder of this position, while Mr. Ashmead Bartlett, if he be a man of more than common ability, is
  hampered by such a great degree of modesty that he
  hides his light under an absolutely impenetrable
  bushel. That it costs money, and agreat deal of

<pb n=48>

money, I need scarcely reaffirm, when Mr. Labouchere, in one of his admirable
<mentioned>"anecdotal photographs,"</mentioned> declares that Baron Huddleston, <q>after four
beatings, and the expenditure, as one calculates, of a
round sum of twenty thousand pounds, at length
found a borough to send him to Parliament in the
Conservative interest.</q>   So, it will be seen that
twenty-five thousand dollars apiece is not regarded
as a great price over there for the privilege of being
whipped four times in attempting to get into Parliament.  The Irish members are elected without
expending one hundred dollars apiece. This comes
of the flow of national opinion among their constituents. The most of these members are not by any
means rich, all of them are young, and the majority
support themselves as journalists while they are
studying law and attending to Parliamentary duties
in London. Mr. Labouchere and Mr. Bradlaugh,
who represent Northampton, do not necessarily
expend great amounts in securing their elections,
because their constituents have repeatedly shown
their determination to elect Mr. Bradlaugh upon the
strength of his atheistic doctrines, and every additional
touch of opposition makes their determination the
firmer. The other members of the House have thus
far practically succeeded in keeping Mr. Bradlaugh
out of the councils of the nation, but Mr. Labouchere
fights his battles for him in the House, and supports
him during his electoral canvasses, without, however,
so violently shading his own conduct as to justify
the slightest attempt to deprive him, also, of the
rights of a member of Parliament. I do not believe

<pb n=49>
that Mr. Labouchere has any more exalted regard
for the test-oath than has Mr. Bradlaugh; but he is
far too shrewd to say so, or to offer any objection to
taking all the oaths in the universe.  It is Mr.
Bradlaugh's design to destroy the test-oath by persistently showing his contempt for it.   He may
succeed in this purpose, for there is a very decided
tendency in the House to bring on legislation that
will provide for affirmation, rather than swearing.
But the personal hostility to Mr. Bradlaugh among
the <mentioned>"set"</mentioned> members, who are largely in the majority,
is so strong that not so long as he knocks upon the
door of the House will there be any unopposed
movement toward that end.
   <p>The House of Commons meeting-room is a little
bit of a place, only large enough, I am told, to comfortably contain about half the members. Still, it is
seldom crowded, for the average M.P. stays away
from his duty with a pertinacity that would do credit
to a United States Senator for Nevada. The room, I
should think, is not more than 100 feet long by 50
wide. There is an open space running along almost
the entire length of the centre of the apartment,
some 15 feet wide it seemed to my eye. On each side
of this space rows of pews gradually ascend, one
above the other, to the walls, like two straight
theatre balconies, facing each other. In these pews
the members sit. Above them, entirely circling the
hall, is a shallow gallery for visitors of high and low
degree, that part of the gallery crossing the innermost end of the room being reserved for the
newspaper stenographers. Still above these people there



<pb n=50>

   is a series of tall, grated windows which look like
   the apertures in the side of a prison. Behind these
   gratings one can see here and there a prettyface, set
   off by a bright ribbon, or a bunch of flowers, and he
   presently learns that he is looking at the ladies' gallery.
     <p>Exactly why the female visitors are fenced off
  in this dark loft nobody about the place seems to
  know. But there they must go if they want to see
  the legislators at work, and there they must sit like
  a lot of well-clad jail-birds.   Below the reporters'
  gallery, in the open space between the rows of members, is the Speaker's chair. It is a high-backed
  affair, like the oak furniture we sometimes see in
  pulpits. It is set under a kind of canopy, also of
  carved oak, some 15 feet high, I should imagine.
  The Speaker is a clean-shaven man, seemingly about
  fifty years old, though it is next to impossible to correctly estimate his age, by reason of the white wig
  which hangs down over his shoulders on each side
  like a pair of gray saddle-bags. He also wears a
  black gown, and, when called upon for his decision
  on any quibble that may come up, he rises slowly,
  advances a step or two, and delivers his opinion in a
  low but distinct and well-modulated voice.   His
  manner is exceedingly impressive, but to the American eye it seems that the dignified and well-poised
bearing of this official would be greatly enhanced
by the removal of what in our country would be
regarded as masquerading toggery. In front of the
Speaker there sit two clerks, likewise wigged and
robed.   But these are not impressive parties, and

<pb n=51>

only aggravate the notion of the American about the
grotesque effect of these garments.
    <p>One of the things which strikes the stranger most
forcibly is the fact that nearly all the members wear
their <mentioned>"plug"</mentioned> hats while sitting in the House. They
only remove these articles of head-gear when they
rise to address the House, or when the Speaker
alludes to one of them. All in all this hat-wearing
business may be regarded as a fair sample of the
manners of the assemblage. If a speaker begins to
talk upon a topic which has no particular interest
about three-quarters of the members will bolt for the
doors. Then somebody calls for a count, and they
stroll back again until the process is completed, when
they trot right out into the lobbies once more. If a
man is particularly obnoxious to them they begin a
concerted system of coughing, which can have no
other effect than to drown his words.   If they
like a man, or what he has to say, they howl <q>Hear!
hear!</q> for two or three minutes sometimes, and it
is always hard to tell, when they laugh, whether it is
done in irony or appreciativeness of some humorous
point. I hardly think, however, that the latter application frequently exists, partly because humorous
points are not of momentary occurrence in the
speeches of the House, and partly because the
House wouldn't know it if they were. Such another
shambling, hem-and-ha-ing lot of talkers I never
heard. The great bulk of them have no ideas to
convey, and only a very few of those who have understand how to convey them, either with force or
elegance. One who is used to hearing foreigners

<pb n=52>

  talk of the liberties we in this country take with our
  public men is likely to be considerably astonished
  at the way these things are done in England. Mr.
  Gladstone is, in my opinion, one of the most
  adroit handlers of men, one of the profoundest
  thinkers, one of the greatest orators, and one of the
  most astute statesmen, the world has ever produced.
  In conservative England one would think he might
  at least command respectful treatment.   Only recently a member of Parliament, in addressing his
  constituents, alluded to Mr. Gladstone as a <mentioned>"cackling old goose,"</mentioned> which is certainly rather personal.
  Great fault is found with Mr. Gladstone in England
  because he objects to oppression, and is willing to
  make concessions where he believes they are just.
  He is accordingly ridiculed and hissed at, and
  attacked, by public speakers, the crowd at large,
and the newspapers. They call him a cackling
old goose now; but they will probably refer to him
as the most wonderful of leaders when he is dead.
They are pretty much like us in this respect.
   <p>Mr. Gladstone is one of the clearest, readiest
talkers I have ever heard. He sits in the front row
of the members' pews, on the left-hand side, facing
the Speaker, close by the end of the table which
stands in front of the white-wigged clerks. Perhaps I should have said he reclines there, for he
doesn't exactly sit. His head is thrown back, and
rests upon the upper edge of the pew-back, his
hands are clasped in his lap, his legs are sprawled
out in front, and he has the general appearance
of a man sound asleep. But he isn't. Now and


<pb n=53>
then the eyelids half open, and a shade of expression crosses the wrinkled features, as the old man
mentally notes a point for future use. When his
opponent has ceased speaking, Mr. Gladstone comes
to his feet with surprising agility, and advances a
step or two to the end of the table. There is a
little red box here, containing his documents, and
he places the ends of his right-hand fingers upon
this box. He lifts his chin rather above its normal
height, like a man used to talking to a gallery, and,
as the words flow freely from between his lips, he
emphasizes them by prodding the box with the tips
of his straightened fingers. As Mr. Gladstone talks,
he grows. In silence and repose you see a thin and
shrivelled old man, with long, slender legs, swollen
joints, a hooked nose, sunken eyes, a sparsely
clothed head, rather narrow through the temples,
but broad and high over the ears, straggling white
whiskers which shamble down the sides of his face
and under his throat, and a general air of physical
decay that is not altogether reassuring. But, as his
chin goes up and his chest protudes and the words
begin to roll out with rapidity and resonance, as the
eyes kindle and the smile of conscious power spreads
over the old face, you begin to feel the reason of the
premier's grip upon the politics of Great Britain. He
has the perfect confidence of the practised speaker,
and that eloquence of manner, no less than of words,
which proclaims the orator. He is by all odds the
most admirable talker I have heard in England. He
uses no notes, and, as soon as he has finished what he
has to say, he slouches back upon the seat, apparently

<pb n=54>

in that state of complete physical collapse which
Charles Dickens ascribes to the old paralytic who is
always throwing his pillow at some one, and immediately falling helpless in his chair. Mr. Gladstone's
bolstering up of the Bradlaugh cause is said to be due
to his friendship and respect for Mr. Labouchere,
who is unquestionably the strongest under-surface
man in English politics at this time. That is to say,
Mr. Labouchere seldom permits himself to appear as
the father of any important movement, but, perhaps,
more than any other individual member of the House
of Commons is he felt in such affairs as may interest
him. He is not widely liked, for the same reason that
prevents most people from cherishing a conspicuous
tenderness for a hornet. The difference is that Mr.
Labouchere's sting lies in his head.
   <p>This Mr. Labouchere is what Bret Harte would
call <mentioned>"a most sarcastic cuss."</mentioned> He edits <title>Truth</title>. He
is a great power in England, for he is about the only
strong journalist whose sword cuts both ways. Belligerent journalism is not popular in England. If a
man calls a spade a spade in a British newspaper he
is immediately snubbed. Club men are the worst
at this sort of thing. In England a man's club is his
everything. If he makes things warm in his newspaper he has things made torrid for himself in his
club.   Everybody remembers how they tried to
bounce Mr. Labouchere from the <name>"Beefsteak,"</name> and
how he brought suit to prevent them from fulfilling
that design. It was all on account of his war with
the <title>Daily Telegraph</title> proprietor. But Labouchere
is nothing if he is not a good fighter, and he keeps

<pb n=55>
up the battle with the big daily just the same. He
has no fear of libel suits, though they are bad things
to tackle under the English laws. He always conducts his own case when he is sued, and he is sharp
as a razor on points of law. A less tenacious and
brilliant man would have been in jail half-a-dozen
times for telling unpleasant truths. But folks are
afraid of Labouchere's bitter and vengeful pen. I
have been told that he learned the lesson of gall in
America. They say he is an old '49er, and that he
has been through all the vicissitudes of a miner's
career.   Labouchere has not the appearance of a
fighter. He is not a large man, physically, but he
has the composure and deliberation of experience
and early cares. He wears a full brown beard that
is slightly tinged with gray on the chin. His eyes
are dark, his face is straight in its outlines, and his
manner is quiet and reserved. I have frequently
seen him walking about the corridors of the House
of Commons, generally with his hands behind him,
and his eyes bent upon the floor, as though in deep
thought. The best thing about Labouchere is his
don't-care-a-cuss-ativeness what people think. His
paper, which is the best edited journal in England,
brings in an enormous amount of profit every year,
and leaves no room for anxiety on the monetary
score. The only unfortunate thing about Labouchere
is his political association with Charles Bradlaugh, a
bungling blatherskite whose only ability is the gift
of noise. Labouchere has the misfortune to represent
the same borough with Bradlaugh. In that particular he is out of luck.

<pb n=56>

   <p>Mr. Forster, formerly Chief Secretary for Ireland,
- a tall, gray, and once red-headed man, -was not
present when I first visited the House. He was,
in fact, being hooted in Limerick by the genial inhabitants of that tempting spot. He was represented
by a sharp, glib-spoken man, with a high forehead,
gray side-whiskers, and a very decided manner. I
think his name was Johnson. Sir Charles Dilke,
Sir William Harcourt, and Mr. John Bright sat
alongside Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Johnson. Mr.
Bright remained quiet during the whole evening,
with his hat planted firmly on the back of his head,
his gray side-whiskers curving briskly around his
genial old face, and his eyes intently fixed on
vacancy.   His arms were folded across his chest,
and he seemed to be trying so hard to be interested
in the proceedings, and failing every time, that I
sympathized with him deeply. Sir Stafford Northcote, the leader of the Opposition, sat across the
room. He spoke only once during the evening, and
then on a matter of no consequence. He seems to
me to be a man capable of saying good things, but
wholly without the power to say them well. This
is the way with the most of these cold-blooded English statesmen. It is, I fancy, almost wholly due to
their complete absence of feeling that they cannot
fire up in their oratory. In the Irish ranks one sees
Mr. Justin MacCarthy, who takes matters easily, and
does not apparently allow himself to be heated by
the discussions in hand, whatever they may be. He
is rather smaller than the average man, has a full
and rather gray beard, a bright, open face, and

<pb n=57>
smiling blue eyes that sparkle brightly through his
gold-bowed spectacles. He is considered one of the
heaviest guns in Mr. Parnell's battery. Undoubtedly
the strength of that party at present in the House
lies between Sexton, O'Connor, Healy, and MacCarthy, all of whom keep a sharp lookout that no
advantageous point escapes them.   There is just
one witty man in Parliament. His name is Healy,
and he belongs to the Irish party - of course.   He
is cordially hated by the Englishmen, and that is
also of course. They have felt his stinging rejoinders over and over again, and they are quite
powerless to take him at his own game. One night when
I was in the House Healy was making a speech.
He looked like a boy in eye-glasses.   On the other
side of the chamber sat a man who had not long
before been given a baronetcy. He kept breaking
in on the sinister young Irishman, who eyed him
wrathfully through his glasses, and finally paused.
<q>I hope,</q> said Healy, <q>that the gentlemen will
listen to my remarks, even though they have been
recently made baronets.</q> A dozen members called
him to order, and he sat down to await the result.
The Speaker arose at the end of the room with the
air of a man on whose shoulders the nation is resting. He decided that Healy had not committed a
breach of parliamentary law, and the young Irishman, with a malicious twinkle in his eye, resumed
his speech by saying, <q>I am glad to have it on such
high parliamentary authority that it is not a crime to
call a man a baronet.</q> Of Mr. Healy it is said that
he is the only man in England, outside Mr. Gladstone,

<pb n=58>
who understands the Irish land act. I studied
it myself for a fortnight with great assiduity, and I
must confess that it is a puzzle to me.
   <p>The House of Commons is made up almost exclusively of rich men.   They receive no salaries,
and they must be rich in order to keep up their
positions. They are not corrupt in the ordinary
acceptation of the term, because they have no need
to be. But it is not to be expected that they will
legislate for the benefit of the poor, since they themselves are rich. The suffrage in England is not
altogether what it might be. A man who owns
property that brings $60 a year (I think that is the
correct figure), or a man who pays rent to that
amount, can vote. Nobody else has the slightest
voice in the government of the country. Thus, it
will be seen, that there can be no law-making by the
people for the people, and the poorer classes in
England get no representation whatever. There are
other peculiarities of the English system. A man
living in Scotland may run for election from   a
district in England, or <foreign lang=la>vice vers&acirc;</foreign>. In fact, a citizen
of any part of Great Britain may be elected from
any other part of it, however distant. The consequence naturally is that the members know little
or nothing about their constituents, their needs, or
their preferences.   How   intelligent law-making
can be accomplished under such a system   I must
confess that I cannot understand. For generations
Englishmen went over to Ireland and were returned
to Parliament to represent constituencies for which
their feeling was one merely of contempt. Finally

<pb n=59>
it seems to have dawned upon the Irish people that
they would prefer to be represented by members of
their own race, and out of this has grown up the
courageous and gallant little band which now takes
care of the interests of Ireland in the English House
of Commons under the leadership of that cool and
daring patriot, Charles Parnell. The British elections occur at intervals of seven years.   It would
be a blessed thing if the same condition of affairs
could be established here. I know of nothing more
absurd than this tearing up of the whole country for
months at a time once in every four years, and the
pulling to pieces of whole States every twelvemonth.
In the politics of England there are some equally
absurd customs. The Government party is the one
that has the majority in the House. From among
the leaders of this party the ministry are chosen. If
they introduce a bill, and are beaten in trying to pass
it, tradition calls upon them to test the feeling of the
country by resigning their posts and calling for a
general election. If they again secure a majority
they are vindicated. But such struggles rarely take
place, because the average member of Parliament is
a man of business, and as his election has cost him
a large amount of solid cash, he is not reckless
enough to give it up in a hurry. So he sees to it
that the ministry is not defeated oftener than once in
five or six years. He is a great believer in the
theory of a bird in the hand.
   <p>It is not an easy matter for outsiders to get into the
galleries of the House of Commons. There is only
room for one hundred and fifty or so visitors, and on

<pb n=60>

every important day of the session the number of
applicants for admission runs from five thousand to
fiteen thousand; on other days, of course, nobody
wants to go. Every member is entitled to one out-
side admission each day, but, as the place only holds
a quarter of what the whole number would be, three-
quarters of the members are disappointed most of
the time. This state of affairs is aggravated in the
case of the ladies. There are very few places in their
portion of the House, and so the members ballot for
their admission. A man is lucky if he gets one lady
into the gallery during a month of trying. All this
is done with malice aforethought. It is not deemed
wise to have a large crowd present during a debate
on important matters, lest the speakers talk to the
galleries instead of the subject in hand. In some
respects this plan is based on wisdom. It prevents
interruptions, though I don't believe there is enthusiasm enough in the whole English nation to make
it forget itself in the face of parliamentary rules and
give a good hearty cheer. If you read the London
newspaper reports of the speeches in the House you
will find that the sentences are interspersed with
parenthetical allusions to <mentioned>"cheers,"</mentioned> <mentioned>"applause,"</mentioned>
etc. This is a glittering sham. A member's re-
marks, which are thus embellished in next day's
reports, are received in dismal silence, save for an
occasional <mentioned>"hear! hear!"</mentioned> from a very few of his
colleagues, and a <mentioned>"no! no!"</mentioned> or two from the other
side. The man who could cheer a British oration
must be lost to all sense of propriety. One might
weep, or even doze.      But cheer- never.      The

<pb n=61>
chamber is a pretty and cosey little room, in the middle of a vast building, at least three or four blocks
long, it seems to me, and called Westminster. This
lies on the bank of the Thames, just above Charing-
Cross Bridge, and is a magnificent structure. It contains both the legislative bodies, and I have no idea
how much besides. There are libraries, restaurants,
smoking-rooms, reading-rooms, committee-rooms,
corridors, and other mysterious places beyond number.   The decorations are superb, and there is a
sense of vastness about the place that is rather discouraging. In the summer the members take their
coffee and cigars of an evening out on the broad walk
which lies along the whole length of the building overhanging the water. There it is cool, and serene, and
pleasant. But, with all this, it should be remembered
that a member of the British Parliament pays heavily
to be elected, receives no salary, and can get a finger
in no <mentioned>"jobs."</mentioned>   Why, he can't even lift so much as a
diamond stud out of the stationery appropriation.
He does it all for the honor of the thing. Imagine
an American Congressman working on the same
plan. I don't mean to suggest something that may
cost you years of toil,- fruitless toil at that,- but just
try to think of it. I have tackled the subject, but I
couldn't fetch it.

 <p>FILL your pockets with insect powder before you
       visit Her Majesty's Theatre in London.   It
won't discourage, or even annoy, the enterprising
vermin of that populous resort. They like it.   I
think it makes them fat. But it entertains them, and
keeps a part of their attention off the audience. I
went to Her Majesty's four nights in succession while
in London. Now, in my normal condition, I am no
alabaster beauty, neither am I as smooth and symmetrical as a terra-cotta statue. But my skin is not
ordinarily as lumpy as a potato-patch, or as red as
an auctioneer's flag; but it has resembled both. I
attended Her Majesty's for the purpose of hearing
Wagner's four-night - count 'em- opera, <name>"Der
Ring des Nibelungen."</name> Like Bunthorne's poem, it
is a wild, weird thing; but, unlike the work of that
bard, it is published. The opera is divided into four
sections, and it reminds one somewhat of a tariff bill
set to music.   There are disadvantages about an
opera which is interpreted in a tongue you do not
understand.   If you watch the stage you don't
know what it is about. If you read the libretto you

<pb n=63>
   can't watch the stage. The best way is to make a
 compromise by keeping your eye on the actors and
 copying the behavior of those in the audience who
 are posted. In this way you display no ignorance,
 and when you get home you can read up your
 libretto. This plan has the additional advantage of
   showing you the great subtlety of the actor's art.
 You will learn how to guess one's meaning by his
 gestures and facial expressions, - how to guess it all
 wrong.
 <p>Her Majesty's Theatre is a very large place. It is
 subsidized by the Government, I believe.   The
 -Boston Theatre, and most of the supporters of the
 Prohibition ticket, could be set inside it without
 crowding. It is not a pretty place. The interior is
 as ungraceful as a greenback campaign. If you
 were to cut off the small end of an egg and place
 the balance of the shell on its side, you would have
 an illustration of the lines of this auditorium. There
 isn't a pretty curve anywhere about the place. A
tier of boxes completely encircles the lower floor,
and there are three more tiers above this one, which
run nearly to the back of the house, leaving small,
cramped spaces for galleries. All the boxes have
satin curtains of a hideous yellow hue, and scanty
lambrequins of the same material line the various
tiers. The curtain is made of red-figured stuff, and
is not impressive.   Have you ever seen an oldfashioned <mentioned>"gathered"</mentioned> petticoat of thin silk, worn
over a <mentioned>"tilter"</mentioned> hoopskirt?   If you have you know
what this curtain looks like. The interiors of the
boxes are not ornamentally gotten up. The boards,

<pb n=64>

which are not very well joined, are merely painted
over, and the chairs were not constructed with a
view to comfort. The orchestra stalls will hold six
hundred or seven hundred people, I should say.
They didn't do it though, during the Wagner performance, for the sufficient reason that the people
were not there to be held. The first section of the
Nibelungen Ring is called the <name>"Rhinegold."</name> It is
begun by the execution on the part of the orchestra
of a movement which, under the different circumstances in which I have met it at various times in
my life, has been intended to mean the entrance of
the heavy villain, an earthquake, a rainstorm, and a
shipwreck. It would serve also as a description of
chills and fever. Upon this occasion it meant the
flowing of waters. It was performed by the orchestra from the Richard Wagner Theatre at Bayreuth,
-a body of musicians distinguished chiefly for hair
and energy.   They had enough of both for ten
orchestras. They were led by a young man named
Anton Seidl, unquestionably the finest conductor I
have ever seen.
   <p>When the curtains were drawn aside on the first
night they displayed some of the scenery from
Wagner's Bayreuth Theatre. It consisted of a big
sheet of blue gauze, which covered the entire proscenium opening. It had a few streaks of tin-foil
glued upon its back, and a blue paper-cambric curtain
behind it. The blue gauze was hauled from side to
side with a gentle, sifting motion, which, in combination with the ague music, led me to think the
scene was intended to picture a wall of water. It

<pb n=65>

  required a heavy effort of my imagination, but I
  fetched it.   The cambric screen slowly ascended
  and revealed a stage covered with high rocks, which,
  through the veil of blue gauze, did very well for the
  bed of a river. A wall of rocks, eight or ten feet
  high, passed clear across the stage, so that when
  three substantial water-nymphs came on upon pedestals, singing and apparently swimming, the effect
  was heightened by the hiding of the lower portions
  of their bodies. One of the best mechanical contrivances employed in the whole opera was used here.
  The water-nymphs were moved about with great
  rapidity and smoothness, and without any of the
  hitches and bother that all of us have observed in
  the operation of such arrangements. I have sometimes seen a stuffed bird start to navigate a stage on
  a wire, and come to a stand-still with a jerk, several
  times, before finally getting across. I have likewise
  seen a train of railway cars halt suddenly in the
  middle of the stage while the legs of the agonized
  carpenter, who was trying vainly to shove it along,
  were plainly obvious. And I presume everybody
  has observed the painful attempts of actors to look
easy and pleasant in a boat hauled on with the movement of an omnibus running over a rough pavement.
But there were none of these things to interfere with
the sports of the Saxon maidens, who seemed to
dive and plunge about with the utmost freedom.
The air they sung was smooth and flowing, and fell
pleasantly upon the ear. As they sported in the
blue-gauze waves, a male singer with a fine baritone
voice came on at the left, walking, and not swimming.

<pb n=66>

He had long hair and a black fur waistcoat.
There was a bracelet on one of his arms, which was
so much too large for him that he had to keep all
five of his fingers distended to their widest extent,
in order to prevent the ornament from slipping off.
He began by singing, -

                        <lb>He, he! Ihr Nicker!

Which the translator has put into the English libretto,
as -
                        <lb>Ho, ho! ye Nixies!

   <p>This is plainly an intelligent translator. Everybody who can read at all knows what a "Nixie " is,
of course. And then, too, it is worth the price of
the book to learn that "ho, ho! " in English means
"he, he !" in German. Anybody who would kick
about paying two dollars for a book with this important information in it, would complain if he were going
to be drowned. Well, having made his observation
to the <mentioned>"Nixies,"</mentioned> the gentleman in fur and hair proceeds to climb up one of the rocks and seat himself
upon its apex. The maidens dive and sing, and he
sits still and sings also. Apparently they are discussing something. You wonder if it is the Irish
question, and you turn to the libretto to see. Then you
learn that he is making love to the girls, who, girl-
like, are poking fun at him. It is one of the curious
things about a girl that the minute a chap makes
love to her she pokes fun at him. I have noticed
that. Turning again to the stage, I see the hairy
party laboriously shinning down one rock and up

<pb n=67>
another, while the girls continue to dive around.
Naturally I wonder what he is trying to do.  It
seems to be hard work, and he doesn't take much
interest in it. So I look in the libretto again, and I
find some rather unique stage directions:--

   <quote><p>He chases them with desperate exertions; with frightful
activity he clambers from rock to rock, springing from one
to the other, and striving to reach first one nymph and then
another; they always avoid him with mocking laughter.
He staggers, and falls below, then clambers aloft again--
till at last his patience is exhausted; foaming with rage,
he pauses breathless, and shakes his clenched fist at the
nymphs. He remains in speechless rage, gazing upward,
when suddenly he is riveted to the spot by the following
sight: Through the water above breaks an ever-increasing
glow, which, on the summit of the central rock, kindles
gradually to a blinding yellow gleam; a magical golden
light then streams from thence through the water.</quote>

   <p>I didn't see anything very frightful about his
activity, but I suppose that is poetic license. The
<mentioned>"ever-increasing glow"</mentioned> which broke through the
water was a lime-light, and it fell on a large slab of
property gold, which was lying on top of one of the
rocks. The hirsute gentleman fixed his eye upon this
shining lump, and the maidens sung and dived some
more. Then the man sung with a great deal of vigor,
climbed up the rock, seized the property-gold, and
came down. The stage was darkened, there was
a crash from the orchestra, and a black gauze, with
clouds painted on it, spread over the stage, and, as
the musicians performed a symphony, intended to
kill time, while the next scene was getting ready,


<pb n=68>

I had a chance to learn what all this was about.
It seems that the three singing and swimming
maidens have been left by their father to guard the
Rhine gold, out of which, should it be taken by any
person other than one of the Rhine inhabitants, a
most potential ring may be formed. Its wearer may
do anything he likes, and all the world will fall
into his power.
   <p>The gentleman in hair and fur, it seems, is a gnome.
Having discovered which, I know more about the
story, of course - though what this breed of animal
really is, I'm blessed if I understand.   Well, Mr.
Gnome drops into the Rhine for the purpose of
dallying with the maidens. But they are averse to
dallying, and elude him. Thereupon he grows angry,
and goes through the various antics I have described,
until the lime-light shows him the lump of property-
gold.   When that becomes visible he hears the
maidens telling each other of the great power of the
Rhine gold; and he also learns that, in order to grasp
it successfully, he must forswear love forever. He
has been having hard luck with love affairs, so he
determines to take the contract of ruling the world.
He therefore   climbs up, and, <mentioned>"with terrible
strength,"</mentioned> wrests the gold from the top of the rock,
and goes down through a trap. This is the scene
we have just been through, and, just as I have digested
it, the black gauze floats off into the flies, and a somewhat singular scene is presented. We have in the
foreground a wood, and in the background what looks
like a big chalk cliff. Midway between the footlights
and the cliff there is what has the appearance of a

<pb n=69>
collection of sandstone gravestones, with white targets painted upon them. A big rock is in the middle
of the stage, and several smaller ones are in various
parts of the scene. Reference to the programme
shows one that the scene is intended to represent a
wooded vale, with a castle on a cliff in the distance,
and a deep valley between the cliff and the vale.
The Rhine is supposed to flow through the deep
valley, which shows how much Mr. Wagner counts
upon the sagacity of his audiences. It would take a
good guessers to find all this out but for the programme. Down in the left-hand corner of the stage
a fat man is reclining upon a rock asleep, in one of
those attitudes in which no human being, drunk or
sober, ever went to sleep in this wide, wide world.
At his side, with her head resting upon him, is a
female in a red wig and a superabundance of adipose
tissue. She awakes, and quite naturally begins to
sing. Then he does likewise. Then they both get
up and sing. She looks like a Dutch statue of
  Liberty, and he looks for all the world like the figure
  of Gambrinus on a New York lager beer lithograph.
  Gambrinus has a spear, which he holds in one hand,
  with its butt on the ground. When he wants to
  express emotion he puts the spear in his other hand,
  with the butt on the ground. Then, when the time
  comes along for him to give vent to still another burst
  of feeling, he puts it back in its original hand, and
  sets his other foot forward. He has a face that is as
  blank and nearly as big as the boundless ocean. His
  wig is pulled down in a little mash-lock over one
  eye. You know a mash-lock when you see it. It

<pb n=70>

is one of those greasy little scallops which a barber
delights in making down over one side of your forehead. It is supposed to make its wearer look
charming. It really makes him look like an idiot. There
is one thing about Gambrinus, however: he is
reliable. He has a glorious bass voice, and he is a
wonderful singer. What is more, you can always
tell when he is going to begin some ten seconds
before he actually lets out a note. He invariably
proceeds to square himself for the effort about that
length of time ahead. This has its advantages.
You always know what to expect, which is not, by
any means, the case with some singers I have heard.
But it does grow monotonous in time, and that is not
so pleasant.
   <p>Well, Gambrinus and the Liberty woman stand
and emit <mentioned>"achs"</mentioned> and <mentioned>"ichs"</mentioned> and <mentioned>"schwatzens"</mentioned>
and <mentioned>"leiblichs"</mentioned> at each other for a considerable
time without settling the question, when another
female comes upon the stage and joins in the discussion. Both women keep their arms going all the
time, in the regular prima donna series of gestures.
First, one hand is extended; then the bosom is
clutched with both hands, while the singer breathes
very rapidly; then both arms are thrown back at full
length <foreign lang=fr>&agrave; la</foreign> calisthenic exercise, and the prima lets
out a shriek at the top of her voice, just as she would
if there were a man under the bed; after that, the
hands are clapped violently together in front, and
the fingers closed between each other; one hand extended to the audience, while the other clutches the
waist of the dress a few inches above the belt; both

<pb n=71>



arms extended at full length from the sides, like the
horizontal part of a cross; then as light wiggle of
the body, a big breath, a protrusion of the chest, an
elevation of the chin, and the final scream away up
somewhere in the attic of the score. So it goes on
through the same routine of gesture and facial expressions, until one begins to extract satisfaction
from the reflection that he probably couldn't understand them any better if they were singing in English.
I have never yet been able to discover why prima
donnas can't make gestures that mean something.
Perhaps it is a part of their art. Up to now all the
characters have simply stood still and sung at each
other. But, at this juncture, there is a movement by
the orchestra not dissimilar to the <mentioned>"essence of Ole
  Virginny,"</mentioned> very slowly played, and two big men in
  furs, with saplings in their hands for clubs, come
  stalking on. They are a malevolent-looking pair,
  gotten up like John McCullough as <emph>Ingomar</emph>. Then
  there is more discussion in a recitative key, and once
  in a while you think there is going to be a melody.
  But there isn't. Every time the composer has been
  tempted to do something rhythmic, he has gone two
  or three bars into it, and then resolutely torn himself
  away, and plunged back into recitative. The scenes
  are spun out to a most fearful and tiresome length.
  Long after the <mentioned>"business"</mentioned> of a scene is done the
  singing goes aimlessly on, and the thing becomes interesting only to the wildest musical enthusiasts.
  When the two Ingomars have twice crossed the
  stage and dragged the fattest of the two damsels back
  with them to where they originally stood, a being still

<pb n=72>

    more eccentric in appearance enters upon the scene.
    He is short and fat, like nearly all the others who
    have appeared thus far. He has on a red wig that
    stands up all over his head, Circassian fashion, and a
    short red beard. His face is a bluish-white, like the
    wall of a room that has just been kalsomined, and
    he wears a red flannel mantle, which is so long that he
    has to carry the end of it in his hand to keep it from
    dragging when he walks. He has a beautiful voice
    of robust tenor quality, and a swagger like a victorious rooster. He comes down the stage from behind
    the big rock in the centre, and sings all by himself for
  about five solid minutes. Then two other fellows
  come on. One of them is a little bit of a man, with a
  big <foreign lang=fr>papier-mach&eacute;</foreign> sledge-hammer in his hand, and
  the other is tall and spindle-legged, but abdominally
  rotund. They all sing awhile at each other, and,
  finally, the two MM. Ingomar take the fattest maiden
  away with them, leaving Gambrinus leaning on his
  spear and gazing meditatively into the footlights,
  while gauze <mentioned>"drops"</mentioned> come down upon the stage.
    <p>This is described by the imaginative Mr. Wagner
 and his co-conspirator, the chap who made this libretto, as <q>a pale mist, increasing in density; in it
 the gods seem to take an aged and haggard appearance.</q>  Pshaw!  So these fat, material-looking
 people are gods, are they? Gambrinus' right name is
 Wotan, and one of the two fat damsels, the fattest
 one, is his daughter. Whether the Liberty one is
 also his daughter, or only his wife, you will never
 find out from Mr. Wagner. Once he calls her his
wife, and several times she speaks of his daughter

<pb n=73>

as her sister. It is rather confusing the first time
you notice it, but after some of the subsequent proceeding are over you conclude that it doesn't make
  much difference which position she ostensibly occupies. According to Mr. Wagner's idea it seems to
  be all one with the gods. It transpires that Wotan
  has hired the Ingomar family to build him a castle
  in the cliff, yonder, and has promised them his fattest
daughter in payment. They have built the castle,
and have come to collect their bill. All this sixty
minutes of singing has been merely a discussion as
to whether he should keep to his bargain or not.
After it is over the Ingomars make off with her upon
a newly-formed agreement. Old Wotan has obviously been acquainted with Mr. Mahone, of Virginia,
because he only gives up his girl as a hostage, until
he can get treasure enough to pay the debt in cash.
He is a readjuster. The gentleman in red flannel
(whose name in the German libretto is Loge, and in
the English translation is Loki, though why, I can't
for the life of me find out) thereupon, in half an
hour more of tedious recitative, urges Gambrinus -
I mean Wotan--to travel down into the precincts
of the gnome and steal his treasure. Wotan, who,
considering that he is a god, doesn't appear to have
any superfluous morality lying around loose, finally
consents, and away they go. The gauze mist lifts,
and Wotan and Loki find themselves in a big cavern,
where they meet the man in fur, whose subjects are
having an anvil chorus out in the wings. I give up
trying to follow all this by guesswork, and stick to
the libretto. So I learn that the anvil-chorus is made

<pb n=74>

by the other gnomes digging treasure out of the
rocks. Presently they come on with treasures which
are different from the treasures that grow in American mines, since they are dug out already made up
into shields, kettles, urns, and other articles of ornament or usefulness. Wotan and Loki question the
boss gnome as to the power of his Rhinegold ring,
and he tells them that, by its power, he can assume
any shape he likes. A cloud of steam comes up
through the stage, and he goes out behind it. You
can see him go through a door in the rock. But
you are not supposed to. This is more of Mr.
Wagner's imagination business. As soon as he is
gone a property-dragon, resembling a stuffed alligator, crawls across the stage. This is supposed to
be the gnome in his assumed form. He comes back
in his proper person as soon as the dragon crawls
out, and then the cunning visitors suggest that he
shall change himself into a toad.   Just to oblige
them he does so, and then they capture him and run
out, followed by all the other gnomes bearing the
treasure.
   <p>The scene then changes back to the wooded vale,
and Wotan comes on with Loki and the gentleman
in fur, who has regained his shape, but not his power.
He sits on a rock while the other gnomes bring in the
treasure and put it on the ground. Then there are
forty minutes of singing without anything being done,
and then Loki and Wotanwrest from the head gnome
his gold ring. He kindly holds out his hand while
they <mentioned>"wrest"</mentioned> it. More imagination. When they get it
he becomes very angry, and puts a curse on whoever


<pb n=75>
shall hold the ring. Bloodshed shall follow it everywhere, and so forth and so on. Then he departs, and
the Ingomar party come back with the girl. They
agree to give up their hostage if the gods will pile up
treasure enough to hide her from view. As she is a big
one it will take a good deal of treasure, which shows
that they want a prettyfair price. Indeed, it strikes
me, by the amount they claim, that they must imagine
they have been building a custom-house or a post-
office for the United States Government. But Wotan
  agrees to the demand, and seats his fat daughter on a
  stone. Two sticks are set up in front of her, and the
  pots and kettles and things from gnome-land are hung
  on the sticks till she is fenced in. Then one of the
  Ingomar brothers goes and examines the structure.
  He finds a chink just big enough to see through, and
  refuses to accept the pile unless that chink is filled
  up. The Nibelung ring is precisely the right size
  for this aperture, and Wotan, with great reluctance,
  throws it in so as to get his daughter back. As soon
  as Ingomar No. 1 gets the ring, the gnome's curse
  comes true. He punches his brother with one of the
  saplings, and Ingomar No. 2 immediately dies, while
  his brother lugs off the treasure. Then there is a
  thunder-storm, and, when it clears up, a rainbow is
  seen, stretching over to the cliff where the castle lies.
  The gods all proceed to walk over on the rainbow,
  and the first section of the opera comes to an end.
      <p>Of all the silly, inconsequential stuff in the world
   this story seems to me about the most trivial. One
   can scarcely help laughing outright at it as the various points unfold themselves. It becomes doubly



<pb n=76>

  ridiculous when chained to a heavy, noisy score.
  Somehow you cannot help wondering at this stage
  of the game if Wagner is not a huge satirist of the
  Gilbertean type, guying all creation. But when you
  get into the next section of the opera you conclude
  he isn't.
     <p>The second volume, which has nothing whatever to
  do with the first, excepting that Wotan is in it, begins
  with a love affair between Siegmund and Sieglinde.
  Sieglinde is a married woman, and Siegmund is her
  brother. I conclude that such things are interesting,
  because there is a much larger audience than there
  was last night, and they all study their librettos with
  great earnestness. Well, Siegmund gets Sieglinde
  to elope with him. He becomes possessed of a
  sword which is all-powerful, and through a whole
  act prays his sister to fly with him. At the end
  of the act she consents, perhaps because she is tired
out. Wagner doesn't say so, but I should have
thought that might be the reason. The only thing
about the act which made it interesting to the bulk
of the audience was its indecency. Here are the last
speeches and the stage directions upon which the
long and vile scene closes:-

                              <sp><speaker>Sieglinde</speaker>
                     <stage type=delivery>(In wild intoxication).</stage>
                 <l>Art thou Siegmund</l>
                 <l>Standing beside me?</l>
                 <l>Sieglinde am I,</l>
                 <l>For thee I've sighed.</l>
                 <l>Thou'st won thy sister,</l>
                 <l>I tell thee, as well as the sword.</l></sp>

<pb n=77>

                              <sp><speaker>Siegmund.</speaker>
                   <l>Bride and sister</l>
                   <l>Be to thy brother -</l>
                   <l>So blest may the Volsungs abound.</l>

                             <stage type=mixed>(He draws her toward him with a
                               frenzy of passion; she sinks on his
                               breast with a cry. The curtain
                               falls quickly.)</stage></sp>

    <p>After this cheerful episode we are introduced to
 Wotan and a new daughter named Brunhilde, out in
 the mountains. Wotan, who is a polygamous old
 rascal himself, objects to the Siegmund-Sieglinde
 affair.   He must draw the line somewhere, you
 know, so he tells his daughter not to have anything
 to do with Siegmund. But his daughter disobeys
 him, and when Siegmund has been killed by Wotan
 and the husband together, Brunhilde takes her off
 through the mountains to the rock where the
 Walkyries gather.
<p>The Walkyries are eighteen or twenty girls, with
fine voices, who ride about in the clouds on property-
horses. The scene with them is unquestionably the
best and most impressive thing in the opera. The
  music arises to grandeur, and it is sung with great
  force by the chorus of Walkyries. While Brunhilde
  is beseeching them to protect Sieglinde, Wotan
  comes on in great rage and curses her. It takes two
  hours and a half of solid singing, most of it at the
  top of her voice, for Brunhilde to get her father to
  take off his curse. Even then he merely adopts Mr.
  Mahone's tactics once more, and readjusts it. Instead

<pb n=78>

    of annihilating her altogether, he puts her to
    sleep upon a rock, surrounds her with a wall of fire,
    and decrees that the man who finds her <q>"shall become her master."</q> That's the way Wagner neatly
    puts it, and it is a very delicate and modest phrase
    -for Wagner. She consents to this because she
    has a premonition that the one who will accomplish
    this task will be Siegfried, the still unborn son of
    the alliance between brother and sister, already
  spoken of. The second section of the opera ends
  with Brunhilde asleep, and red-fire and flash-pans
  doing their prettiest to make the thing impressive.
     <p>This piece, gentle reader, just as I have described it,
  was played in the city of London to the biggest house
  of the series. What makes it remarkable is the fact
  that the Lord Chamberlain of this same metropolis
  wouldn't let <name>"Camille"</name> be performed there at all
  for a number of years, and the only condition upon
  which he agreed to let <name>"Divorcons"</name> be brought out
  during the summer, in French, and without any
  libretto to translate its gentle depravity, was that the
  piece should be very largely rewritten. After all,
  you see, there is quite a considerable difference between Tweedledum and Tweedledee when
  Tweedledum is Sardou and Tweedledee is Wagner.
    <p>In the third section Siegfried has been safely born,
 and has grown to manhood. He has been raised in
 a blacksmith's shop, and the blacksmith has become
 possessed of Siegfried's father's broken sword.
 Wotan comes in and explains that the man who
 shall be able to weld that weapon together must
be absolutely without knowledge of fear, and will

<pb n=79>
become all-powerful by the use of the weapon he
has mended. After heating and beating it awhile,
Siegfried joins the sword together, and shows its
power by chopping an anvil in two.   Then he goes
forth to do deeds of valor. He begins by practising
upon a singing dragon, as big as a hippopotamus,
which guards a cavern in which the Nibelung ring
has been hidden. He wounds the dragon, which
slowly sings itself to death after having nearly accomplished the same fate for the audience. Siegfried's
first act after getting the ring is to kill the blacksmith who has reared him. The people in the
theatre are likely to reflect at this point that there
is some good in the ring after all, because the blacksmith has from the first been an unmitigated
nuisance. After this, guided by a stuffed crow, which
is propelled across the stage on a couple of strings,
Siegfried goes and finds the sleeping Brunhilde.
There is another revolting scene, and the act ends,
presumably because it is ashamed to go any farther.
There is one feature to the two sections just finished
which was not shared by the first. They are magnificently sung and acted. Herr Vogl, the Siegfried,
and Frau Vogl, the Brunhilde, are fine artists in
every sense, and the man who plays Wotan upon
these two occasions is a majestic and powerful lyric
actor. I have never seen anything to equal the
work done by these three people. Nearly the whole
weight of the opera fell upon their shoulders - and
lungs; but they carried it off with no appreciable
effort. Frau Vogl is unquestionably one of the
greatest dramatic prima donnas of the age. She

<pb n=80>




was loaned, with her husband, <mentioned>"for this occasion
only,"</mentioned> by the King of Bavaria, and they were obliged
to go back to him at the close of the week.
    <p>In the final quarter of the <name>"Ring des Nibelungs"</name>
 Siegfried has been drugged, and has forgotten all
 about Brunhilde. He is smitten by another girl, the
 one who has dosed him. But he is considerate of
 Brunhilde, and offers to supply her with another
 husband. This is liberal of him, and, seeing that
 there is a good deal more of the substitute than there
 is of himself, it looks queer when Brunhilde declines
 the offer. The conduct of Siegfried makes Wotan
 angry, and he puts up a job with the substitute husband to murder Siegfried. He is enticed away, and,
 after his memory has been restored by another kind of
 drink (not a temperance drink, I take it, because it
 is administered from a horn), he is stabbed and dies.
 Then his body is brought back to the shores of the
 Rhine, and the two women - Brunhilde and Love
 No. 2- have a long scene over him, after which the
 whole business sinks into darkness, and the opera
 ends.
    <p>I cannot admit that it is a great work, unless
 tediousness is greatness. The score is a wonderful
 combination of chords, but only at infrequent periods
 does it arrest the attention or satisfy the appetite.
 Not from the first strain of the opening overture to
the last crash of sound as the play ends is there a
solitary melody. The story, you will see, is simply
a chaotic mass of triviality and filth. Where it is
not silly, it is dirty. The whole thing carries the
impression of unpardonable <mentioned>"padding."</mentioned>   If the

<pb n=81>

worthless music and pointless dialogue were to be cut
out of the <name>"Ring des Nibelungs,"</name> the whole thing
could be played in one evening. It is remarkable
only for its length. This applies to score and story.
You have probably heard a great deal of the Bayreuth scenery. That, likewise, is nonsense. There
is better scenery painted every week at any one of the
leading theatres in America. The solitary <mentioned>"effect"</mentioned>
employed by Wagner is the squirting of steam up
through the floor. His stuffed dragons and birds
turn the whole affair into ridicule.   He might as
well have introduced a heifer dance, and be done
with it. The <name>"Ring des Nibelungs"</name> might do for
one night, if it could be condensed, but to put in four
evenings upon it is a dead waste of time, unless you
want to learn a lot of things to practise which would
  get you into the penitentiary. Any single twenty
  minutes of the opera will teach you half-a-dozen.
  Any half hour of it, from first to last, would make you
  blush, if you had a face as hard as a bronze statue,
  and a moral nature as tough as a section of New
  York pie-crust. But the opera was popular in London.

</LIST>

   <p>I met Mr. Tompkins one afternoon, standing in
       front of a gloomy-looking shop, gazing dreamily
in through the window. When I stopped I found
that the shop was devoted to the sale of mortuary
implements, including tombstones and monuments.
I looked again, and observed that Mr. Tompkins,
apparently, was not well. He seemed thin and
white, and he carried a thick stick, upon which he
leaned heavily. I was reflecting as to the possible
connection of the undertaking establishment with
Mr. Tompkins' evidently feeble health, when he
caught sight of my face reflected in the window.
He turned around with an expression designed to be
genial. But it was not a marked success.
   <q><p>I've been sick,</q> he began; <q>mighty sick. I
am no growler when a little of the bitterness of life
comes along with the pleasant parts of it, but when
a fellow gets under the weather in London he is
clear out of luck. Mrs. Tompkins went home over
a month ago. The last bank holiday was one too
many for her. I'll tell you about that part of it
directly. Soon as she was gone I came up to the
city from where I had been living for some time. I
struck a damp, cold, lodging-house.  The whole

<pb n=83>

place was wet. The landlady was a terror. She
had a head as thick as a cord of oak. The only
thing she knew was how to make out a bill, and she
could do that to the Queen's taste. She could
charge more for salt and pepper and other things
that cost nothing than any human being I ever saw
or heard of. But she never by any mistake did anything right. Naturally I got the rheumatism.   It
was the only thing I did get properly in that house,
and, if I had asked for it, I shouldn't have had it at
  all. Well, to illustrate the monumental ability of
  that woman to be stupid, let me tell you what
  happened. One day I sent out for a porous plaster.</q>
    <q><p>When will yer 'ave it, sir?</q> she asked.
    <q><p>Soon as I can get it,</q> I replied.
    <q><p>She went away and I didn't see her for more than
  an hour. Then she came up, beaming all over.
  She was sure she had done a good thing. You
  could tell that by her cursed vacuous smile. She
  had a covered dish in her hand.</q>
     <q><p>It's rawther tough,</q> she explained; <q>but I
  couldn't make it any more tenderer if I tried till I
  was a centurion. Besides, the fire was low.</q>
    <q><p>Fire,</q> I gasped, <q>what fire, for Heaven's sake?</q>
    <q><p>The fire in the kitchen,</q> she replied.
     <q><p>Before I could ask any more questions she took
  off the cover of that dish and showed me my
  plaster, covered with milk and butter, and blazing
  hot. I' m hanged if the blasted idiot hadn't stewed
  it. Oh, she was the champion! It's only because
  Providence took a direct protective interest in my
  case that I am here now to tell about it. That

<pb n=84>

woman's imbecility was so serene, so big, so vast,
so supremely grand, that she would have had me in
my grave--or somebody elses'--long ago, if she
hadn't been checked by some unseen power. It
nearly killed me, every time I moved, but I saw I
had to get away from that house pretty quick if I
hoped to avoid being carried out feet first. The
only way I lived at all was that I swore so much it
sort of dried the air. But I finally got away, and
went down to Cheltenham. You have never been
to Cheltenham?</q>
    <p>I told Mr. Tompkins I had not. By this time we
 had found a cab, and were driving along the street
 toward Hyde Park, which Mr. Tompkins wanted
 to see before leaving England.
    <q><p>Cheltenham,</q> he said, <q>is the most hideous
 place in the world. It is one of the sort of towns
 where there is mineral water. The only difference
 between Cheltenham and the other places where
 mineral water grows is that the Cheltenham stuff
 would take the lining out of a steam-boiler. It is
 awful. You land at the station, a porter seizes you
 and runs you up to the hotel. They give you water
 all day and all night. They don't let you eat much
 of anything, and it would be a dead waste of time
 if they did. There is nothing in Cheltenham that
 wastes time. The water is the most energetic fluid
 on the face of the earth. They just heave it into
 you all the day, and it attends to the rest of the
 ceremony without assistance. I will bet you more
 people have died from this water than from smallpox. I saw an epitaph in the cemetery there that

   told the story. I had an awful fascination for
   cemeteries while I was there. I didn't know when
   I might need one. Here's the epitaph. I copied it
   into my note-book: -

           <quote><l>Here lie Mrs. Green and daughter,
             <l>Who died of drinking Cheltenham water.
             <l>If they had stuck to Epsom salts,
             <l>They wouldn't have been in these here vaults.</quote></q>

  <q><p>Well, I got out of Cheltenham finally, but I was
  pretty thin, and here I am.   I want to see a little
  of the city, so I can tell the boys about it when I get
  back to the States. Thus far it is only a confused
  recollection of tea for breakfast, cauliflower for
  dinner, and swindles everywhere.   Speaking of
  swindles, have you run across the London 'bus
  conductors?  They take the whole bakery. They
  would take St. Paul's Cathedral, if they could lay
  hold of it.   You ride three blocks with them, and
  they gather all there is in the vicinity. They know
  you are green, because you ask them something.
  If you were a Londoner you wouldn't. Londoners
  know everything beforehand. They do it by instinct.
  You have seen the unerring exactitude with which
  a well-brought-up colored man makes all paths end
  in the direct vicinity of a hen-roost.   Well, it's
  the same sort of genius that guides the London man.
  As soon as you ask a 'bus driver where his coach
  runs, he regards you as his prey. When you get
  off you give him sixpence, having ridden one penny's
  worth. He takes out fourpence, and generally you
let him keep what he has robbed you of. Once in

<pb n=86>

a while you say, <q>You're a swindler. Gimme the
rest of my change.</q> Then he calmly smiles, tells
you he knows it, and hands you the correct amount.
The worst of the blackguard is that he is so blasted
good-natured about it. What can you do with such
a chap.</q>
   <p>At this point our cab came to a halt close by a
big, smoky-looking granite arch. The little lid in
the top of the vehicle, connecting us with the driver,
came open.
   <p><q>What's the matter?</q> asked Mr. Tompkins.
   <p><q>I cawn't gaow fawther, sir,</q> replied the man.
   <p><q>You cawn't, cawn't you? Well, why the deuce
cawn't you?</q>
   <p><q>The lor won't let hus 'ackney drivers henter the
place, sir.</q>
   <p>Mr. Tompkins was speechless for a moment.
Then he beckoned to a policeman, and asked that
dignitary if what had just been told him was based
on fact. The officer nodded.
   <p><q>Nothink but private kerridges allowed in the
park, yer honor.</q>
   <p>Mr. Tompkins with great difficulty suppressed
his desire to indulge in comments of a humid
description, and, muttering something about the
advantages of civilization and free countries, paid
the cabman, and we entered the park on foot. We
found ourselves close beside what is known all over
the world as Rotten Row. Where the title comes
from nobody knows. Mr. Tompkins suggests that
it means nobody can ride in the row who isn't
<mentioned>"rotten with wealth."</mentioned> Have you any idea what

<pb n=87>
  Rotten Row is like? I used to have a sort of feeling
  that it was a road skirting Hyde Park on one side
  and a row of fine mansions on the other.   Instead
  of that it is only a couple of circular roads through
  the park, like two race-courses, one within the other.
  The outside one of these tracks is followed by the
  people who ride in carriages, and the inside road is
  possessed by the riders on horseback. They are
  separated by a couple of rods or so of sward, broken
  by some fine old trees, and at intervals there are paths
  for pedestrians.   It being a Saturday afternoon the
  place was pretty well crowded in all its departments,
  although the season was not yet on, and the leaders
  of London society would no more be seen riding in
  Rotten Row before that interesting event takes place
  than they would think of doing anything else that
  happened to be out of the fashion. The long string
  of riders in the inner circle were going in one
  direction, and the still longer string of carriages in
  the outer circle were going in the opposite direction. There were many fine equipages, and
  numbers of handsome, clean-limbed saddle-horses. But
  the carriage-horses were not, as a rule, at all comparable with the New York, or Boston, or San
  Francisco average.
  <p>The main feature of the turnouts in Rotten Row
  was the slowness and stupidity of the whole affair.
The people were out, not to enjoy the brisk exhilaration of a sharp drive through the bracing afternoon
air, but obviously to show themselves and their horseflesh. The animals were moving mostly at a walk,
and nowhere did I see one upon a trot, excepting as

<pb n=88>



a business man was driving home. They were a
haughty-looking lot in the carriages, and a similarly
swell crowd on horseback. Here and there, in the
latter direction, a hat was raised in recognition of
some high-chinned dowager or damsel, who stiffly
and unsmilingly returned the salute. The ladies, as
a general thing, were unbecomingly attired, and only
now and again was the dull monotony of rather stolid
angularity of countenance relieved by a fresh and
bright face. You have heard of the fine complexions of English ladies, and once in a while you come
across the article in reality. But it is really an infrequent occurrence, and it certainly is not seen often
enough to justify the amount of gush heard by
Americans who stay at home, at the hands, or,
rather, at the chins of Americans who go abroad.
Handsome women and girls are not very thick over
there.
   <p>I suppose the fact is due to the absence of good
taste in dress and other types of personal adornment. A fearful and wonderful amount of artificial
red and white is used in the decoration of mature
English ladies' faces and lips. But nobody would
dream of calling the result a clear complexion. It
is simply a ghastly combination in which few American ladies would have the nerve to publicly appear.
But I suppose that the farther one gets into this
paint-and-powder business, the less acute becomes
her knowledge of how plainly visible the make-up is.
A girl starts with a <mentioned>"little Lubin's powder, just to
take the shine off."</mentioned> She ends by carrying a chalk
rag in her pocket, and touching herself up with it

<pb n=89>
every time she thinks nobody is looking. And the
worst of the whole business is that she remains all
the time unconscious of the fact that anybody but
herself knows about it.
    <p>The English girl is the worst of the lot on this
account. When she goes to the theatre she produces
in the ladies' room a regular make-up box, and proceeds to plaster herself before going to her seat in
the auditorium. And she doesn't get into her carriage
for an afternoon drive in Rotten Row until she has
been duly smeared with white lead and rouge. The
exceptions are far scarcer than with us in America.
I suppose this is because we are a young country.
But we shall learn in time. We are apt pupils, we
Americans.
    <p>Hyde Park is mainly a flat stretch of land. It
 is not nearly so large as Central Park in New
 York, and it is far from being as picturesque. Artificiality is the most pronounced feature of the place.
Only the trees and the sward are natural, and, in
many places, these are trained according to man's
devices. Here and there a flock of sheep, grazing
in the midst of a green expanse, make a pretty picture. But, on the whole, Hyde Park is a
disappointment. The entire park is enclosed by an iron fence,
full ten feet high, and most of the entrances are
under tall archways of granite or marble. Many
people seem to think a stone arch, ten or fifteen feet
thick and thirty or forty feet high, is a striking and
  harmonious piece of architecture. To me these
  affairs seem awkward and superfluous. They are
  about as relevant as lonely steeples would be if

<pb n=90>

erected miles away from churches. Put in as gateways between the openings of a slender iron fence,
these cumbersome arches are simply preposterous
and ungainly relics.
   <q><p>I learned a good many things in America,</q>
blurted out Mr. Tompkins, after we had been walking about an hour or so in the sunshine, <q>but I had
to come to London to find out that style was only
another name for stupidity. Did you ever see anything more supremely idiotic than riding around a
mile-track at such a gait as that? I don't believe
there is a horse in the lot that could trot the distance
in a quarter of an hour. I'd like to see Mr. Bonner
spring a couple of trotters and a road-wagon on this
crowd. It would scare 'em clean to death first time.
You can abuse English society all you like, and
there are a good many things you might mention that
would be unpleasant, and anything but false. But
after watching one of these Rotten Row parades,
the one thing you cannot say is that English society
is fast. On the other hand it is about as slow a
scheme as I ever struck. If they were to run a
funeral procession as slow as that in America the
mourners would complain.</q>
    <q><p>Hello! There's a band of music over there.
Now, that's like home. I didn't suppose there was
so much public spirit in the whole nation. There's
some style about that. Let's go over and hear it.
Why couldn't we have struck this part of the place
before? There are some folks who never seem to be
in luck. The idea of wasting all that time looking
at the procession, when we might have been enjoying

<pb n=91>

a regular home-like, good time. Funny people,
 these British are! Look at 'em   standing up all
 around, when the place is full of seats. It's a curious fact, and I don't know as you have noticed it,
 that of all the chairs in the park not more than one
 in forty is occupied. I wonder why it is.</q>
     <p>As he spoke, Mr. Tompkins settled into one of the
  seats, within easy seeing and hearing distance of the
  band, which was really a fine organization, and
  which discoursed a good quality of music.
     <q><p>This,</q> said Mr. Tompkins, <q>is first-class. And
  here I have been declaring there was nothing decent
  in the whole country. I ought to be ashamed of
  myself. I like good music. It is soothing to the
  senses, especially when a fellow is getting over the
  rheumatism. I have slandered the London authorities. It was good of them to put these seats all
  around here. This is the first time I have found
  anything in Europe    that I didn't have to pay
  for. Eh-</q>
      <p><q>Tuppence, sir.</q>
      <p>It was one of the park assistants who spoke. He
   had approached quietly, and now stood close by us
   with that hard, monetary look upon his face which
   is assumed by all Britons who are bent on backsheesh.
       <p><q>What?</q> Thus Mr. Tompkins.
       <p><q>Tuppence, sir.</q>
       <p><q>What for?</q>
       <p><q>A-sittin' on them seats, sir.</q>
       <p><q>Which?</q>
       <p><q>A-sittin' on them seats.</q>

<pb n=92>
    <p><q>You don't mean to say we must pay for sitting
down in this snide old park, do you?</q>
    <p><q>That's about the size of it, sir.</q>
    <q><p>Well, here's your money. But permit me to
say that, in a public park, and within earshot of a
tart Dutch band, the charging of four cents apiece
for the privilege of sitting on a cheap wooden chair
is a blamed swindle.</q>   The man sidled away.
<q>Great Britain,</q> continued Mr. Tompkins, <q>beats
the world on meanness. Look around you. Everybody is standing up.   Only bloated bondholders,
like you and me, can afford to sit down. These
chairs are placed here purposely for Americans and
d--d fools. Europeans would know in advance
that such a luxury as a chair would have to be paid
for. If you take anything in England without bargaining for it you are bound to be sorry. If you
don't get charged for it outright, like this here robbery about the chairs, you will find yourself squeezed
in some other quarter. I'd like to see a city in
America that would have the nerve to stick a stranger
four cents for sitting down in a park. That reminds
me. I promised to tell you about last bank holiday,
and why Mrs. Tompkins went home to America.
I got some tickets to see Warner play in <name>'Drink.'</name>
Had heard it was a wonderful personation, and
wanted to see it. I may say it is the greatest piece
of acting I ever saw. Well, Mrs. Tompkins and I
were living down at Blackheath then, and I telegraphed her to come up, and I would meet her at
the Charing-Cross station, so we could go to dinner
before the performance. She was on time, but you

<pb n=93>

 ought to have seen her. The poor woman was boiling with rage and shame. It seems that the man
 at the station, in the kindness of his heart, had put
 her in a first-class compartment, because there was
 rather a tough crowd aboard. We were not in the
habit of travelling first-class. We did not want to
  excite comment as to our sanity. Well, Mrs. Tompkins thought it was very nice of the station agent to
  put her in the high-toned car. At the next station
but one the train was full, and I'm blessed if
  the porter didn't put sixteen drunken men and
  women into the compartment. What's more, they
  were third-class passengers, and proud of it. The
  carriage was made to hold six, and you can imagine
  how comfortable it must have been with seventeen
  people, all told, in it. She told the porter she
couldn't stand this crowd. He replied, with some
   profanity, that she had better sit down to it. So
   she sat down to it. The drunken men and women
   seemed to be angry about what she had said to the
   porter.</q>
       <q><p>Anyhow, they badgered poor Mrs. Tompkins
    all the way to town. They said she must sing
    to them, and they pulled her about all over the place.
    They swore at her, used villanous language, and
    threatened to throw her out of the window if she
    didn't warble. She says she didn't do anything of
    the sort, but, if I had been in her place, I should
    have whooped up a warble or two, if it had killed
    me. At London Bridge they got out, and Mrs.
    Tompkins was still scared half to death when she
    reached Charing Cross.</q>

94

    <p><q>Why didn't you complain to the superintend
ent?</q> I asked.
    <p><q>Complain? Well, I should rather think I did.
I got a letter saying the porter had been fourteen
years with the company, and never had such a complaint made regarding him before.   Consequently
nothing could be done about it. Oh, England takes
the biscuit! It is the boss.   It rakes down the
sleepers. It coppers the whole game, and wins on
splits.</q>
   <p>Mr. Tompkins' conversation was growing enigmatic. We went to dinner.

 </LIST>

  <p>IT is a mistake to think that London theatres are
      not profitable.   They exact higher prices and
 more of them than any American theatres. They
 pay smaller salaries, dress their supernumeraries less
 expensively, and generally conduct themselves on a
 grab-and-hold-on system, that is unpopular but profitable. I mortgaged my estate and went, for
 instance, to Mr. Irving's theatre, where the abominable
 -system of fees is supposed to have been done away
with,- so supposed by the people who believe what
  the advertisements say. A seat in the fourth row
  of the dress circle costs $1.25. In the most expensive theatre in America the price would have been
not more than $1. The circle is not, however, the
  most costly part of the house. Down on the lower
  floor, facing the stage, a part of what would be the
  orchestra chairs in America are fenced off from the
  rear portion of the house. These are called stalls,
  possibly upon the theory that a stall is the only fit habitation for a person who will pay $2.50 to see a
  common theatrical performance.   This part of the house
  is fairly patronized at Mr. Irving's theatre; but,
  as a rule in London, only deadheads and people

<pb n=96>

with more weight of purse than of common-sense
sit in the stalls. Whatever <mentioned>"papering"</mentioned> there may be
is usually to be found here and in the boxes, which
run as high as $25 in price. The pit is that part of
the lower floor back of the stalls, and it ordinarily
smells like the hatchway of an ocean steamer's steerage. It is the best part of the house for purposes
of observation, and, if one is fond of high perfumes,
it will do very well for smelling.
   <p>Above this is the dress circle, which is the favorite
part of the house with sensible people of the better
quality. Still above this is the upper circle, price
75 cents, and, on top of this, the gallery at 25 cents.
Entrance to the pit costs 50 cents.
   <p>Mr. Irving's theatre is a very handsome house. The
principal entrance is on a side-street, and the doors to
the pit are on the Strand. The former place is handsomely gotten up in every way. The doors are
decorated with colored glass, and the interior of the lobby
is as pretty as anything in America. The walls are
tinted in rose, the heavy Turkish carpet is of a deep-
red hue, the lamps are all shaded to harmonize with
the walls, and the heavy silk plush curtains which
separate the interior lobbies from those outside are
hued in golden brown. The effect of this warm
coloring is very pleasing to the eye, and prepares
one for the insinuating young man at the top of the
stairs, who has a dress suit and a deep yearning to
take care of your overcoat, - all of which is free
as the air, but is done in such a way that it costs a
shilling. Another young man, who holds some pink
programmes in his hand, enthusiastically conducts


<pb n=97>
the stranger to his seat, and does it with a degree
of effusive politeness which rarely fails to extract
another quarter from the obliged customer. Seated
beside a young lady who had no hesitation in leaning
over every five minutes so that her head was between
my face and the stage, and in front of an obese old
person with the asthma, I had a fine opportunity to
look at the interior of Mr. Irving's theatre, but not
to see as much of his performance as I should have
liked. The house is decorated in blue, and in construction resembles the usual run of American
theatres. The balconies are all shallow, and very
judiciously graded. They are closed in at the back,
with an encircling lobby outside, like that at the
Academy in New York. There are three or four
proscenium boxes to the floor on each side; but only
four out of the lot were occupied the night I was
there. Counting on a fair number of deadheads,
and reckoning up the house at the advertised prices,
I calculated the value of that particular audience to
be about $900.
   <p>Ladies in London go to theatres generally in
evening dress. Gentlemen are supposed to wear
swallow-tails in the stalls, but in other parts of the
house they use their own discretion, which usually
means the cutaway morning or ordinary frock coat
and dark trousers. The removing of hats and cloaks
by the ladies is an admirable idea, as the most of us
who have suffered from acute attacks of the Gainesborough head-gear will be ready to admit. The
English theatres are all supplied with bars and
smoking-rooms run by the management.  It is



<pb n=98>

quite customary for ladies to stroll about the lobbies
unaccompanied, while their husbands are smoking
cigarettes or chatting with the barmaids in the refreshment-rooms. The other custom which strikes
one as rather odd is the serving of ices, cakes, and
the like, all through the auditorium between the
acts. And when the leader of the orchestra sees
fit, for some occult reason which I have not yet
mastered, to play <name>"God save the Queen,"</name> everybody
in the house is expected to rise and remain standing
till the last strain dies away. If one doesn't get up,
either through ignorance or a preference for occupying the seat he has paid for, the balance of the
audience glower upon him in a way that makes his
spinal marrow as cold as so many linked lumps of
ice-cream.
   <p>The Drury Lane is to other theatres what the whale
is to the smelt. I should think it would hold five
thousand people. It is, as every reader of these lines
must know already, the most famous theatre in England. Macready, Kean, Garrick and John
McCullough have made its timbers shudder with their
energy. There are statues of the three former in
the lobby. It is a tremendous house. Great, square
pillars, four or five feet thick, support the entrances
from the street, which, for the better portions of the
house, lead in to a broad and high lobby that is on a
level with the first balcony. The erring stranger
gently gravitates toward the bar-room, but is rescued
by a uniformed barbarian who leads him down the
stairs and hands him over to a gentlemanly pirate
with a handful of programmes, who, in turn, leads

<pb n=99>
   him through a long, circuitous passage, seats him by
   the bass-drum, charges him sixpence for a bill of
   the play, and departs. From that moment the visitor
   hears but little of what goes forward, by reason of
   the aforesaid bass-drum.  So he looks around.
   There must be close to fifteen hundred people on the
   ground floor. The stalls run back five or six rows,
   and then the pit begins. From this rail to the distant rear of the house there is a jam of human
   bodies that must be very social, if not painful.
   Every inch of space is filled. And every compressed
   space-filler is fairly sizzling with hilarity and perspiration. The stalls are well filled, too, - so well,
   indeed, that chairs are brought in and placed in the
   open space still closer to the bass-drum than my place
   of observation. In the chairs sit those unfortunate
   young men who come late, when the stalls are all
   gone. But the situation is too much for them. In
   a little while they retire, deafened, to the bar-room.
   They come back shortly, looking moist about their
   eyes, but resigned. Then they go out again, and so
   it runs, until, by ten o'clock, they are in a condition
   of blissful inebriation, which even the demoniacal
   drummer cannot penetrate. There must be fifty people in the orchestra. It is a wonderfully well organized band, so far as I am permitted to hear. It is
   held well in hand by the leader, a young man in a
   skull-cap and white gloves, with the fingers too long,
   who looks like a cashier in a restaurant. Above the
lower floor there are five tiers. This bare statement of
  fact will give some notion of the lofty ceiling of the
  house. As the upper gallery of the Boston Globe


  <pb n=100>

  Theatre is arched, so are all the galleries of the
  Drury Lane. What is more, they are full, packed,
  squeezed, and squashed with people wedged in so
  tightly that I should think they would stick together
  when the place was emptied, and peel, like raisins
  in a box.
  <p>Little bunches of dimly illuminated globes are
  fastened to the balconies, just as they are in
  American theatres, but the principal part of the
  lighting is done by the big chandelier which hangs
  over the centre of the auditorium.   This is a tremendous bunch of lights, and is very vivid. There
are more private boxes at the Drury Lane than there
are in ordinary theatres.   They are big and little
affairs, and run in price from $5.25 up to $25.50
each. Down under the pillars which support the
proscenium arch on either side there are two
little square apertures, and these, too, are private
box openings. One immediately supposes they were
put in there after the theatre was built, and during
the run of some great play, when the house was not
large enough to hold all who applied for admission,
and the manager adopted the ingenious device of
turning the bases of his proscenium pillars into additional boxes. The auditorium is very deep. It isn't
semicircular, and it isn't like a horseshoe. It has not
the outward bulge of a horseshoe above the points.
The impression it gives is of vastness. The decorations are red. Everything is red, from the faces of
the people in the pit--who have had their blood all
crowded up into their heads - clear to the railing of
the topmost gallery.

<pb n=101>

    <p>If anybody told you that <title>"Robinson Crusoe,"</title> as
 done by the Lydia Thompson company, only with
 more legs and scenery and things, was a pantomime,
 what should you say? You would probably deny it.
 I should have done so myself up to the night I saw
 the affair in the English capital. Since then I am
 almost prepared to believe that <title>"Hamlet,"</title> or
 <title>"Felicia,"</title> or <title>"Richard III.,"</title> or any of those gay
 and sparkling arrangements, are pantomimes. It
 was then that I visited the Drury Lane, just as the
 Christmas spectacle was in its dying throes. It had
 run since <datestruct value="-12-26"><month>December</month> <day type=number>26</day></datestruct>, and, from any indication I
 could discover, it might have continued to run as
 long again, if the management had not chosen to
 change the bill to German opera. A London pantomime is about as far removed from what we
 conceive to be the correct notion of that sort of an
 entertainment as you can readily imagine. In our
 benighted country we are accustomed to clowns, and
harlequins, and sprites, and matters of that sort, as
the chief factors of the pantomimic show. That
exhibits our ignorance. In London they get along
almost entirely without any such foolery. Let me
tell you about it.
    <p><title>"Robinson Crusoe"</title> is the theme, and a fat-
legged young lady in tights plays Robinson. Robinson has a mother, who is naturally and relevantly
played by a man. Another man, a red-nosed old
fellow, is in love with Mrs. Crusoe. He has a
daughter who loves Robinson. Here, you see, we
have a nice little family arrangement. There is a
bold, bad villain in striped tights and a red wig who

<pb n=102>

loves Robinson's girl, and seeks to win her. Robinson goes to sea; is wrecked upon the island; meets
a cockatoo that talks English; captures some cats
and dogs, which are arranged like the heifer in
<title>"Evangeline,"</title> but which, fortunately, are not
addicted to that extraordinary animal's habits as to
dancing; is rescued by his friends; marries the girl,
and does all the other humdrum regulation things
that are done in burlesques. All this lasts to 10.45,
when there is a transformation scene, after which
there is a genuine pantomime of rather rocky quality
until 11.15, when you may go home if you like. If
you are an American citizen, of respectable tendencies, you do so. If you are a British <mentioned>"blood"</mentioned> you
go and stand around the stage-door to speak to the
ballet girls as they come out of the theatre. As a
spectacle, the Christmas pantomime at the Drury
Lane must have been something superb, when it
was new. The scenery is wonderfully vivid and
picturesque even at the end of the run. But the
costumes are in the sere and played-out leaf. They
are clothes which age has withered and custom
staled. One fat girl has sat down upon her lunch, or
something that has left grease spots all over the
backs of her blue tights, a good many lean ones have
poked their knee-pans through the delicate silk
hosiery, and all of them have besmooched themselves to an unnecessary extent.   The beautiful
satire of Mr. Gilbert, when he makes Grosvenor
tell of the fate of Teasing Tom, who
                              <quote><l>... "was lost totally,
           <l>And married a girl in the corps de ballet."</quote>

<pb n=103>
can only be fully comprehended by one who has
gazed upon the gentle damsel in London. She is a
pretty bad lot, which is not to be very deeply wondered at, since she only gets from $2.50 to $5 a
week.   She is ungraceful, flat-footed, and brassy.
She unites a portentous development below the
waist to a scrawny outlook as to neck and arms,
which, alas! tells its own tale of the upholsterer's
art. She cuts her hair short in the back, like a
man, and either <mentioned>"bangs"</mentioned> it across her forehead or
frizzes it there in a way which gives her head a
singularly top-heavy appearance in front. She perpetually bends forward a little, as though suffering
from a slight attack of cholera morbus. Frequently
she has a pretty face, and quite often she is young.
   <p>Always, when standing still, she is looking with
the eye of calm and deliberate speculation upon the
occupants of the stalls, and, when she is supposed to
dance or move her arms about with gentle, rhythmic
grace, she simply hops from one foot to the other
with as little labor as possible, and arches her arms
in unyielding, semicircular curves that are as
unpoetic as the kick of a camel.
   <p>There are about three hundred and fifty of these
women on the stage of the Drury Lane during the
pantomime season. If they were beautiful, or under
good discipline, or freshly-clothed, they might do for
America. But in the unsympathetic glare of limelights upon worn-out costumes, and behaving
generally as though they were thoroughly bored, they do
not please.
   <p>The massing of the supernumeraries was first done

<pb n=104>

by a clever drill sergeant. There are, at times, on the
stage, during the progress of this piece, fully five
hundred people, and some of the tableaux they form
are quite striking. It is easy to see why, with such
a stage, such a scene-painter, and such a driller as
the Drury Lane evidently possesses, such plays as
<title>"The World,"</title> and <title>"Youth,"</title> should have made
great successes. There are one or two scenes in
<title>"Robinson Crusoe"</title> which go ahead of anything I
have seen in America.  The transformation is
superb.
   <p>So is the main scene on Crusoe's island, where
the savages, three or four hundred strong, are
holding their ceremonies over the captive Friday.
All the painting is far above the average, and there
is not a scene that would be spoken of slightingly
in America. Some of the effects, also, are strong.
The best is that of the ship, which is represented
with her stern to the audience, like the Pinafore
scene, excepting that we are looking toward and
over the bow. There is a double panorama, representing first the banks of a river, which converge
ahead just as we have seen railway tracks come
together far away in front of us. This, with the
pitching of the <mentioned>"bridge"</mentioned> and sides of the vessel,
serves to give a great deal of realism to the scene.
By and by the ship passes out to sea, the panoramas
representing dead walls of clouds, then a thunderstorm, then rocks ahead, and then the vessel pitches
upon a reef, the masts come down, and, amid the
crash of thunder, the shrieks of the passengers, and
the howling of the tempest, the curtain descends.

<pb n=105>
This is one of the best-managed pieces of stage
  mechanics I have ever seen. It is good enough to
form an incident in a heavy scenic melodrama.
    <p>There was one more piece of effect that was
 strong. It occurred at the end of the performance,
 after the tagged-on pantomime. A huge frame, like
 the frame of a mirror, stood well up the stage, with
 blue gauze covering the aperture where there should
 be glass. A group of living statues face the audience, with their backs close to the gauze. A similar
 group stand just beyond the gauze, with their
 backs to the audience, the effect being a reflection
 in the supposed glass. Beyond the further group
 a drop is painted to represent the front of the
 theatre, the darkened lamps being admirably reproduced. A ballet comes upon the stage in front, and
 its duplicates come on beyond the mirror-frame.
 One party dances and poses facing the audience,
 and the other goes through precisely the same
 movements, up the stage, facing the painted people,
 with backs to the actual auditors. In short, everything that is done in front of the frame is copied
 beyond it so skilfully, and with such admirable unison
 of purpose, that it is almost impossible to believe the
 looking-glass is not real. Two people near me,
 a man and wife, I took them to be, - quarrelled all
 the way to the cloak-room about it, she declaring
 that it was a glass, and he pooh-poohing her, with
that air of superior wisdom which my gallant sex
invariably adopts in public, only to precipitately and
unconditionally abandon in the boudoir.
    <p>It was only after Robinson Crusoe had been disposed

<pb n=106>
of, comic songs, water-sprites, ballets, dances,
processions, marches, and all, that the clown part
of the entertainment began. That was not equal
to what we have had in America. The clown,
pantaloon, and all hands, talked straight through
the entertainment, and, only that they were dressed
and painted in the style of clowns, pantaloons,
and all hands pre-historic, one might have readily
imagined they were going through a very bad
farce.   I suppose that is the only thing for England, though. Just as one has to get out an
explanatory chart when he issues a verbal jest for
the delectation of Great Britain's noble sons, so, if
he be a clown, he must explain the meaning of his
every grimace. Convince an Englishman that he
really ought to laugh, and he will roar him as gently
as the sucking dove. And it doesn't make the
slightest difference to him what he laughs at, if he
really thinks laughter is the proper movement. But
there are only two things I have struck which are
equal to this emergency. One is <title>Punch</title>, and the
other is the pantomime.   Each has thumped the
English ribs with bricks till they are tender enough
to be tickled, and each keeps up the irritation just
sufficiently to prevent the raw spots from healing
up. There are more bad puns to the square inch in
an English pantomime than there are hairs on a
Zulu's head. It was with infinite humor that, after
a long scene of idiotic <mentioned>"gagging,"</mentioned> Mr. Harry
Nicholls observed: <q>To resume the libretto,</q> so-
and-so. This brings me down to the actors. Some
of them are very good. Others are not. The most

<pb n=107>
of them are <mentioned>"others."</mentioned>  The Mr. Nicholls above
referred to is a pretty good burlesque heavy villain,
and Mr. James Fawn was very funny as a rummy
old gentleman, addicted to abnormal rubicundity of
visage and heavy potations. Arthur Roberts, a
concert-hall singer, as the Widow Crusoe, got himself up in clever imitation of Sarah Bernhardt, and
sang several topical songs fairly. The star of the
piece was Miss Fannie Leslie, the favorite London
soubrette, who made a great hit as Phoebe Sage in
<title>"Drink,"</title> when Charles Warner created Coupeau.
In my feeble and jaundiced opinion Miss Leslie
would not be endured as a first-rate soubrette in
America. She wears a smile which is both extensive and perpetual, and I am very much afraid her
agility is divided between her intellect and her heels
in inverse ratio. She dances beautifully. But she
fires her lines at the fifth of those awful five tiers in
a monotone as level as the regular thumps one hears
in a boiler factory. She is pretty, she is stunningly
founded, she is wrought upon the best principles of
voluminous female loveliness, but she would not
pass for a soubrette in America. A little woman
named Robina (on the bills) sang so very well that
I wondered how she happened to be in a pantomime
when there are not good singers enough to go round
in the comic opera companies. There were twenty-
seven speaking parts in the spectacle, and none of
them had anything to say that was worth saying.
One of the remarkable points in this piece was a
song about England and America, during which
Miss Leslie stood between a fat gentleman, dressed


<pb n=108>

as John Bull, and a lean one supposed to be Uncle
Sam, in pongee pantaloons and a striped silk shirt,
concerning whom there was a horrible suspicion
that the former articles might come off at any
moment. The song was up to the average of the
pantomime libretto. It was twice encored. Miss
Leslie sang it while waving the flags of the two
nations, who were, for the moment, her victims.
Here it is:

        <quote><l>"Here's the American banner
          <l>And the dear old Union Jack,
            <l>May both together always be unfurled;
          <l>May these two English nations
          <l>Together always stand;
          <l>United they could conquer all the world."</quote>

   <p>That's it, as nearly as I can recollect. It set those
perspiring Britons almost mad with glee. It did not
occur to them to <mentioned>"carp or criticise,"</mentioned> or even to
reflect that America might not desire to assist at
demolishing the rest of the universe. Oh, no! They
only thought of Miss Leslie's beauty, her comprehensive smile, and the boundless, booming poetry
of the thing.

  <p>WE Americans are always being told of the
            wondrous beauty of English girls.   The
  most of them are strong and healthy-looking. Their
  conversation is rather insipid, however, and their feet
  are almost always large and clumsy. The English
  girl is born to be married. She is never taught anything else. Thrown on her own resources she is as
  helpless as a chicken in a mill-pond. She is never
  independent, and the result is that she is generally
  stolid. This quality is called repose in England.
  It is the kind of repose we are used to seeing in
  oxen.  In her ideas of dress the English girl is
  sometimes rather eccentric. I have seen her do some
  strange things in this direction. She will insist on
  wearing silks and satins to the theatre, generally cut
  low in the neck and short in the sleeves. She will
  appear in this costume, topped off by heavy boots
and one-button gloves. It would not surprise me in
the least to see an English girl in a low-necked silk
dress with firemen's boots on her feet and buckskin
mittens on her hands.     The English shoemaker
makes the most ungainly foot-gear in the world.
The English ladies' shoes are atrocious, and they
make the feet as flat as pancakes, and a good deal

<pb n=110>

the same shape. There is no particular fault to be
found with the general appearance of English girls.
But they do not compare with the Americans, the
French, or the Spanish. They tell me I am no judge
of female loveliness. But for the life of me I could
never see any beauty in a dull face. Features that
are not lighted by the spark of intelligence seem to
me to be rather useless, and certainly not beautiful.
   <p>There is a difference in the appearance of London
and New York or Boston ladies. In London, they
wear their hair cut short and parted on the side. I
am sorry to see American girls copying the wretched
style. The hair fashion gives them a bold, hard look,
that is not easy to get used to or like. English
women are better-looking in this shape than those of
any other country would be. They are, as a general
thing, big-headed creatures, who do not require the addition of hair to give their faces size. They have round
necks and plump shoulders almost invariably, but
their arms are, for the most part, very masculine in appearance. That is to say, they are lean and long, thin
above the elbows, big just below the joints, and shaped
generally with more indications of sinew than grace.
Hands and feet in England, are constructed with a liberal regard for the raw material that is quite pleasing
to observe. I never saw, elsewhere, such extremities
in my life, especially on the women. I met an old
girl on Regent street, one day, who was a study in
color. The Whistler would probably call her a
nocturne in red and gold. She was sixty years old
if she was a day. Her hair was bleached to that
horrible tint of orange which never existed under

<pb n=111>
natural conditions, her eyebrows were carefully
lengthened out and arched with black pigment.
Her thin cheeks were colored a brilliant carmine,
and her upper eyelids were shaded to match. The
balance of her visible cuticle was of that blue
and shiny quality one sees in cheap porcelain.
Lips, a vivid pink. Her dress had a yellow and
black striped underskirt, cut short and drawn tightly
around her ankles, so as to aggravate the large size
of her feet, and a deep-red overskirt, also drawn
tight, to aggravate the smallness of the rest of her.
The waist was buttoned in the back, like a school-
girl's gown, and the little hat that was perched on
top of her orange curls was a wonderful thing in
feathers and roses; yellow kid gloves to the elbows,
and a parasol, red outside and yellow inside, completed the costume.   This gay young bird came
tripping down the sidewalk, leading a shaggy little
dog by a string, and simpering sweetly upon all who
passed her by. Some of the men smiled as she went
along. In New York or Boston she would have
been looked upon as probably belonging to some
museum. But, amid all the fantastic, yet slouchy,
dresses one sees in London, hers was not so striking
as to attract more than passing notice.   At the
Gaiety one night there were two women in a box,
clothed in white silk. One had short, black hair,
and the other short, blonde hair. Their box was
around toward the back of the house, where it was
easy to see the stage. But it was not a very good
box to be seen in. So, presently, I saw my ladies
away around on the other side of the house, in a proscenium

<pb n=112>

box, facing the audience.   The blonde-
haired one sat moderately well back under the ceiling.   The other planted herself squarely in the
middle of the aperture, stretched her arms out
straight, at a wide angle, so that her closed fists
could lie on the rail, and there she sat for the balance
of the evening. Being struck with the spectacle of
two low-necked damsels alone in a box, purposely
attracting a great amount of attention, I inquired
who they were. They proved to be entirely respectable women, according to London lights - not <mentioned>"The
Lights o' London"</mentioned>- and I went away marvelling.
   <p>An interesting discussion was going on in the
papers while I was in London as to ladies' safety from
insult on the streets of that sedate metropolis. It
would amuse any American lady who has ever been
there to read what some of the knowing writers of
the press said on this subject. These people calmly
declared that any respectable woman could do her
shopping all by herself in London, and not be spoken
to or annoyed by strange men with just as much impunity as she could in any city of the world. It is a
favorite fiction in London that American newspaper
writers are the only ones in the universe who habitually tell whoppers. But, upon my life, this pretence
that any woman of attractive personal appearance
can enjoy immunity from insult there is the most
brazen piece of lying I ever ran across.   Why, one
day, I saw something in this line which, for cool and
unpardonable rascality, went very far ahead of any
performance of the puppy description I ever heard
of. A young blood, with a high collar, tight pantaloons,

<pb n=113>
and patent leather boots, caught sight of a
cab coming along the street with a pretty girl in it.
He immediately hailed the driver, and accosted the
astonished lady with the assurance that he was delighted to meet her again, as he hadn't seen her since
last summer, in Brighton. She replied that she had
never been in Brighton in her life, and the young
blood assured her that she must be mistaken. Then
it dawned on the girl what his purpose was, and she
tried to signal the cabman to drive on. At the same
time the smart youngster made an attempt to climb
into the cab. The girl's pretty face began to bear an
expression of mingled indignation and fright, and
there is no knowing how the incident would have
terminated but for the sudden interference of a
stranger, who caught the young rascal by the scruff
of his neck and jerked him across the sidewalk
against the railing with more vigor than grace. Mr.
Briton got up and made a pass at his assailant, and
thereupon received a thump in the face which sent
him sprawling into the gutter.
   <p><q>You'll know better next time, my lad,</q> observed
a policeman who had seen a good part of the disturbance, but sensibly declined to interfere.
   <p>This sort of thing isn't uncommon in London.
Many cabmen are <mentioned>"in"</mentioned> with the young scamps who
practise this sort of thing, and it is a cold day when
they are left. No reasonably good-looking girl can
walk a block in London in the daytime without being
approached by half-a-dozen of the flower of English
snobbery. The odd thing about it is that women
may walk about at night with four times the security




<pb n=114>

they can command by daylight. They very often go
to theatres unaccompanied by a male escort, and suffer no embarrassment for their temerity. A funny
place is London, and the more you see of it the funnier it seems.
   <p>English society was, one day in <datestruct value="1882--"><year>1882</year></datestruct>, quite
severely shocked by the fact that the queen got wet
in a shower, when Her Majesty was out driving
up in Scotland. The vehicle was an open wagonette, and the queen's royal companions were the
Duchesses of Albany and Connaught. They were
a mile or more from any shelter, when the rain suddenly poured down upon them without the slightest
regard for their royal blood. The fact was immediately published all over great Britain, of course, and
the whole country is apparently interested in dispatches of this sort. At one time Mr. Gladstone
caught a slight cold, and the fact was duly wired to
all the newspapers in the kingdom. Everybody in
London remembers how during one spring the Duke
of Albany slipped on a piece of orange-peel and
sprained his poor, royal knee. The fuss that was
made over it was pretty nearly as big as though it
had been his neck that was sprained. Imagine what
a guying an American journalist would get who
telegraphed half or three-quarters of a column to his
newspaper about the President having a cold in his
head!   Some of the formalities in regard to the English royal family are wonderfully amusing. For
instance, the newspapers that are read by the queen
have to be specially printed on a particular kind of
paper, and they must never be folded or creased in

<pb n=115>

any way. Even here the ridiculous proceedings of
red tape do not stop. Certain officials who are told
off to the task have to read the papers before they go
to Her Majesty. They mark with a blue pencil what
they think will interest her, and she is not supposed
to look at anything that is not thus prescribed. All
this is done so Her Majesty may not be shocked by
anything naughty or othewise offensive. I wish I
had somebody to protect my shy and tender young
sensibilities that way.
    <p>When the Queen of England goes anywhere for a
 vacation she literally <mentioned>"takes up her bed,"</mentioned> even if
 she doesn't fulfil the balance of the scriptural injunction, <mentioned>"and walk."</mentioned> During her sojourn in Mentone,
 in the southern part of France, she slept in a couch
 which accompanied her from Windsor Castle.
 Would you like to know what a royal couch is like?
 Well, you shall. This one is made of maple, with
 a high, canopied head-board and green silk curtains.
 It is supplied with a hair mattress, and the coverlid
 is of fine Irish lace. It was expected that when she
 came over from Mentone she would leave the bed as
 a souvenir. This is a way she has; and there are a
 dozen or so of beds which she has once occupied
 floating around various parts of the world. It may
 be an honor to have a royal bed in the house.   At
 any rate it is safe to bet that no royal couch is going
 to break down under any common sleeper. By the
 way, there came near being some rather serious complications one day while I was in London, through
 the queen's absence.   A messenger was sent tri-
   weekly to Mentone with important documents, private

<pb n=116>

letters from the Premier, and a lot of other
things of great national moment.
   <p>One night the messenger who had all this in
charge reached Mentone completely done up for
sleep. I dont know whether he had been keeping
himself company with Mr. Nasby's favorite travelling companion (a demijohn) or not. At any rate, he
landed at Mentone and forgot all about the heap of
documents in the royal boxes. An hour or two
later it suddenly occurred to this brilliant and trustworthy specimen of Britain's sons that the nation's
secrets were going along somewhere at the rate of
sixty miles an hour, beyond his reach. He flew to
the telegraph office in wild consternation, and kept
the instrument clicking away for dear life, until, an
hour or two later, he learned that the packets were
all right, because nobody had happened to be let
into the compartment where they were.

</LIST>

 <p>THE Gaiety Theatre is more like the American
          sort of thing than any other house in
London. Most of the other places of amusement
are British to the backbone. That is to say, you
are made to know and feel that you are under an
English roof, and tied up with English customs.
The cloak-room is pushed under your nose in a
friendly, but mercenary, way, the programme is
handed you with a polite ostentation that will almost
always catch a shilling, and, in fact, every thing that
is to be paid for extra in the house is made to assert
itself painfully. You are told that it is <mentioned>"not necessary"</mentioned> to fee the attach&eacute;s of the place, as they are
  paid by the management for their services. But the
  attach&eacute;s themselves are not absolutely forbidden to
  accept gratuities, and, consequently, they are on the
  lookout for victims. But at the Gaiety there are
  signs in all the lobbies which simply order people
  not to pay the ushers or other employ&eacute;s under any
  circumstances. This puts a guest upon an easy and
  comfortable footing at once. The Gaiety is situated
  upon the Strand, half a block above Mr. Irving's
  theatre. One enters from the street, and climbs a
  long flight of stairs that would be enough to kill a

<pb n=118>

    theatre in New York. The entrance to the stalls is
    down another flight of stairs, so that, to get into
    seats that are on a level with the sidewalk, it is
    necessary to go upstairs and downstairs -and the
    only reason you don't complete the rhyme and go
    <mentioned>"in the lady's chamber"</mentioned> is the trifling fact that there
    is no lady's chamber in the neighborhood.
      <p>It would be possible to avoid this complicated
   system of entering, only that one of Spiers &amp; Pond's
   big bar-rooms occupies the whole front of the house
   on the street side. These people also have a restaurant up above the theatre, where they serve a
   <foreign lang=fr>table d'hote</foreign> dinner. It is a very bad dinner, I may here
   remark. The unpractised passer is lured in by the
   announcement that the meal costs only eighty-seven
   cents. Then he finds that he has to pay twenty-five
   cents more for being served. Of course he has to give
   the waiter something besides. The house charges
 him for the privilege of being served, and he pays the
 waiter for the labor involved. The system is minute,
 but not altogether pleasant. For a bottle of cheap,
 bitter claret, that looks like red ink, tastes as if somebody had soaked a stick of wood in a lot of
 alum-water, and colored the liquid up for the occasion,
 one dollar must be paid. The dinner consists of
 fair bean-soup, codfish, under the name of turbot, a
 sort of lobster-tart, which the bill calls a croquette, a
 piece of roast beef, which has wisely been cut thin,
 thus making it possible to put the knife through it,
 boiled potatoes, cauliflower, ice cream, a piece of
 cheese the size of a postage-stamp, and some apples
of the dimensions and resisting power of grape-shot.

<pb n=119>

There are wax candles all over the place, and everything is carried on with great devotion to style.
These same people have restaurants all over London,
as well as having refreshment-rooms in many of
the railway stations of England. They know how
to keep bar-rooms, but some of my most poignant
moments have been passed in their eating-rooms.
   <p>At the head of the stairs leading to the Gaiety
Theatre one comes to the box-office, close by which
hangs a crayon sketch of Mr. W. J. Florence in
<title>"The Mighty Dollar."</title> This is the theatre where
he played when he was in England. The house is
still open, but has undergone tribulation. When
the man in the office has written the number of one
deadhead box on one ticket, and has said <q>Thank
you</q> to us for accepting it, we pass up another short
flight of stairs to the rear of the dress circle. Here
we have to walk through the bar-room connected
with the theatre. There is one or more of these
in every place of amusement in London, and it is
patronized by men and women alike. It is generally
a little alcove fenced off with a marble bar, on
which stand a lot of bottles. Behind the bar stand
two girls, who are paid to measure out drinks and
smiles to the swallow-tailed young men who buy
seats and smoke cigarettes. The consequence is, if
you are an old man, that you have to wait for your
drink, and you can't get the other kind of a smile at
all. The bars are a part of the theatres.   They
generally supply pretty poor drinks. Women invariably act as tenders of these places in England. Not
that there is anything very tender about a bar to

<pb n=120>

    make a woman a bar-tender. But the sex do all
    sorts of things there which would not be expected
    of them at home.
       <p>Among other things, they act as ushers in the
    theatres, even at the Gaiety, which aims most of
    any toward the American system. Our box lies at
    the back of the dress circle, and is one of a line of
    boxes that goes clear around that portion of the
    house. The view is excellent, and the close backing
    of the apartment brings the sound in well. The
    theatre is handsome, though it stands in need of
    some new paint. Downstairs there is an altogether
    unusual amount of space devoted to stalls. These
    are for the accommodation of the swallow-tailed
    young gentlemen aforesaid, who smoke cigarettes
    and talk to bar-maids during the <foreign lang=fr>entr'actes</foreign>, and
    stand around the back door after the show is out.
    They are British <mentioned>"thoroughbreds,"</mentioned> who support the
 burlesque and run after the burlesquers. They are
   the chaps who pay the most into the Gaiety treasury.
   There are six boxes on a side in this theatre, in
   addition to those I have already spoken of, which
run around back of the dress circle.   Then there
   are three galleries above the ground floor.
      <p>The decorations run mostly to old gold. It is,
  indeed, so old that its early renewal would be of
  benefit to the appearance of the house. The boxes
  are large and comfortable, and are hung with dark
  curtains that serve to set off the light costumes
  mainly worn in theatres here.
      <p>But I never sat in such a theatre as the Haymarket. It is not a promising structure, as to exterior,

<pb n=121>
and the lobby is a rather dismal place. But,
once inside the house, one is introduced to a degree
of luxury which I do not believe is duplicated anywhere, at least in the theatrical line. The orchestra,
as is most generally the case in London, is hidden
from sight, and the place usually occupied by the
musicians is filled with plants. The stage is enclosed
by a massive gilded frame, which takes the place
usually occupied by proscenium pillars and arch.
Does this strike any of my readers as being at all
similar to an idea which was paraded in America a
few years ago, with a great deal of bluster, as one
of the novel features of a new theatre? The fact of
the matter is, that the whole stage-opening at the
Haymarket is a direct imitation of the plan originated by Mr. Steele Mackaye in building the
Madison Square Theatre in New York. The Haymarket
was completed long before Mr. Mackaye ever
dreamed of erecting that structure, to be sure. But
that is a side issue. Whatever may be said of Mr.
Mackaye, he is at least original. You would be as
sure of it as I am, if you had seen the Haymarket
Theatre. However, this is a digression. Between
this house and the Lyceum is shared the especial
favor of the upper classes of English society. None
  but elegant audiences assemble in these two places
  of amusement. They are built with this end in
  view. The Haymarket has no pit whatever, and
  that of the Lyceum occupies a noticeably circumscribed area.
     <p>In the Haymarket the stalls or orchestra chairs,
  which are particularly large and roomy, run back

<pb n=122>

  nearly to the rear of the house. Raised some six or
  seven feet from this floor, and passing around behind
  the stalls in the horseshoe shape, lies the first row
  of the dress circle. It is just like the orchestra circle
  in our American theatres, excepting that the elevation referred to distinctly separates it from the lower
  floor. This circle contains five or six rows of big,
  red, plush-covered sofas, and ends on either side
  close to the pillars which support the proscenium
  boxes. Huge pots, containing palm ferns, are set at
  each end of the circle. There are mezzanine boxes
  clear around the back of this tier and the one above
  it. These, too, are richly decorated in red silk and
  silk plush. The tier above this does not follow the
  horseshoe pattern, but goes almost straight across
  the rear of the house. Then on the sides, level with
  this tier, are two detached galleries, holding, perhaps, a couple of dozens of people each. Above
  this is the ordinary gallery, which, like the one
beneath it, is almost straight across the interior. The
proscenium boxes, of which there are three on a side,
if I recollect correctly, are large and roomy, and
have anterooms in the rear. One of these was occupied by the Duchess of Edinburgh the night I was
present. She is a plain lady, somewhere between
those dim, uncertain years, which one's friends say
are thirty-six, while one's enemies swear to fifty. I
should take her to be something like thirty-seven or
thirty-eight. She has a rather strongly-marked face,
with a pleasant mouth and eyes, and a round, intellectual forehead. Her hair, upon this occasion, was
worn <foreign lang=fr>&agrave; la</foreign> Mrs. R. B. Hayes ; that is to say, it was parted

<pb n=123>
in the middle and <mentioned>"slicked"</mentioned> down over the temples
with formal care. She was plainly dressed in black,
and before her, on the edge of the box, was a large
bunch of flowers. There were two nice, respectable-
looking, middle-aged ladies with her, and some
gentlemen who looked at the audience through their
opera-glasses most of the time.
    <p>The decorations of the Haymarket are extremely
rich, and sometimes gaudy. Burnished gold forms
the background for all the frescoes, many of which
are done with remarkable skill. There are panels
which line the walls and the fronts of the different
galleries. They are studies from various of Shakespeare's plays, and represent the different characters
in picturesque attitudes and groups. The execution
is in most cases admirable. The roof, which is
dome-shaped, is a plain sheet of gold, illuminated
from the centre by a particularly vivid chandelier.
The drop-curtain represents a minuet of the stately
olden kind, and is a wonderful piece of painting of
its type. The figures are gracefully posed, and the
drawing is most minute. Totally unlike most curtains where men and women are represented, the
finest of fine work has been employed here. The
picture is good enough to be framed and hung up.
   <p>The, same care and elaboration are carried upon
the stage. When the curtain rolls up on the first
act of <mentioned>"Ours,"</mentioned> it discloses as finely painted a piece
of wood scenery as I have ever looked at. A false
stage has been built, which rises abruptly from a
point half-way up the original stage, and as sharply
descends again beyond, thus forming a realistic little



<pb n=124>

hillock, which is covered with moss and dead-leaves.
The woods are what are known to stage carpenters
as <mentioned>"set trees,"</mentioned> exclusively. This means that, instead
of being painted on a big, whole sheet of canvas,
each one is separately painted, and stands by itself,
so that the audience can see between the trunks in
all directions. The device is not new, but it is carried to a greater and more complete extent here than
I had previously seen. The smallest details are
observed. Now and then, as the people come and
go, and the dialogue progresses with that lazy, well-
bred flow which Robertson alone has mastered, the
brown leaves drop one by one from the branches
overhead and drift down upon the stage. It only
wants the birds, flitting about from branch to branch,
to make the scene perfect.
   <p>The Adelphi is a big theatre, and, like the
Lyceum, has three galleries. The pit comes down
to within four rows of the stage, and was tightly
wedged with the horny-handed sons and daughters
of toil when I went to the theatre. I like horny-
handed English sons and daughters of toil when the
weather isn't hot, and they are some distance away.
But in a close theatre, on a warm night, with enthusiasm and perspiration oozing from every pore,
the British laborer is not a desirable companion in
large doses. That is the objection to having the pit
and stalls so close together.
   <p>The prices at the Adelphi are about the same as
those at the Lyceum, and the feeing business is quite
as strongly marked. What with cabs, programmes,
and coat-carers, one cannot go to a first-class London

<pb n=125>
theatre alone, occupy one of the best chairs, under
$3.50, which would take two people, comfortably,
in New York or Boston. There is everywhere the
most marked courtesy, however, which, to one who
has been bullied in American box-offices and browbeaten by American ushers, is worth paying for.
For instance, Dr. Jecks, the acting manager of the
Adelphi, is individually solicitous for the welfare of
his guests at all times, and does not hesitate to make
his solicitude personally known. I never observed
such a thing in America, where the acting manager
usually locks himself up in a room, or stands and
glares at the ticket-taker to make sure he pockets no
coupons. The English ticket, by the way, is a
curious thing. It is printed on colored paper of
ordinary quality, and is as big as ten American
tickets. It looks like an abnormally developed bank
check, and is torn from the coupon, just as the check
is torn from the stub. In some theatres these are
numbered with type figures, just as they are in
America. But in most of the box-offices there are
two men, one of whom calls out of a book the numbers of the seats you are to have, while the other
marks them in blue pencil on the coupon of your
ticket, tears it off and hands it over. I don't see the
advantages of this system, excepting it is designed,
by reason of the additional labor involved, to justify
the additional charge of 25 cents a ticket, which is
sometimes exacted here when you book seats in
advance.   If an Englishman ever does anything
without being paid for it he is generally regarded as
insane. Few of them are troubled with suspicions
of that sort.

<ITEM>They Think They are Truthful, But -.</ITEM>

<ITEM>The Real Facts.</ITEM>
</LIST>

 <p>THERE are some curious beings in this curious
          world. But the <mentioned>"curiousest"</mentioned> of the lot seem
to have been monopolized by the London newspapers and sent to Egypt, when the war was in
progress there. The little difficulty we of the North
experienced some years ago with our loving brothers
of the South developed some talent in the war
correspondent line. Yet for genuine, old reliable,
tuft-hunting spillers of ink commend me to the
<mentioned>"special"</mentioned> in Egypt of a London daily. I think
the <title>Daily Telegraph</title> employed the champion. This
disseminator of first-class information had a man
named Gay at the beginning of the campaign. He
used to send on some startling stories of his own
hairbreadth 'scapes by flood and field, but one day,
in an evil hour, he got a telegram through the lines
saying some of the British soldiers had run when
attacked by the enemy. Mr. Gay had to go, of
course. It was obvious that Mr. Gay was not the
right man in the right place. If he had been he
would never have said British soldiers ran. You will
notice this in all the telegrams from the seat of war.
They sometimes retire when the situation is torrid;
but they do not run. So it came about that for some

<pb n=127>
days the <title>Telegraph</title> had no Mr. Gay in the field.
He was soon replaced by a man who had more
tact, and who described a certain episode as follows:
    <quote><p>About 6.30 o'clock last evening Sir Evelyn Wood, with
 Capts. Slade and Hitchcock, were standing by a clump of
 trees in front of the most advanced picket. Arabi's gunners had the range most accurately. Soon the General, as
 he stood there, heard the sound of a shell, and cried,
 <q>Look out!</q> the next instant a seven-inch one fell only
 ten paces distant. It buried itself in the sand, and threw
 up a cloud of dust which almost buried the officers. Had
 the ground been hard they must all have been killed. This
 is the narrowest escape that Gen. Wood has yet had. Sir
 Evelyn then mounted a tree for the purpose of making
 observations, when a second seven-inch shell fell just
 behind the horses, greatly startling them.</quote>

    <p>Gentle reader, did you ever <mentioned>mount a tree for
 the purpose of making observations"</mentioned>? I did. And
 it wasn't much of a tree, either. It was away up in
 Montana, and there was a grizzly bear at the foot
 of the tree about the time I reached the first
 <mentioned>"crotch."</mentioned> I was not afraid of the bear, but, like
 Gen. Wood, I wanted to make observations. I
 kept up in that tree, making observations, until
 another fellow shot the bear. That, however, was
 only a coincidence. But I never saw a General shin
 up a tree in a hurry. If I had, I am afraid I could
 not have described it as prettily as the <title>Daily Telegraph</title> man has done. The fact is, that an awful lot
of lies were sent by wire from Egypt to the London
newspapers, whence they were conscientiously
repeated to the American press. It would have



<pb n=128>



been just as well to put a large lump of salt in every
Egyptian despatch you saw while that war was in
progress. I know of one particular correspondent
who telegraphed a victory to his newspaper in
London. Then he wrote a private letter to a friend,
in which he explained that the regulations of the
army would not allow him to send anything else.
In this letter he frankly stated that the telegraphic
victory was in reality a most decided defeat. This
is a writer I have known for years, and can vouch
for. So you will understand what to think when
you read nowadays that a foe of England has been
whipped within an inch of his life. According to
the British theory it would not have done at all to
admit a defeat at that stage of the game in Egypt.
   <p>The rules governing English war correspondents
abroad form simply a gag-law that is unstintedly
applied in regard to unpleasant admissions of defeat,
and criticisms upon the course of the British General.
There was a <mentioned>"reconnoissance in force"</mentioned> during the
first Egyptian war; about two thousand of the
British troops took part. This, at least, is what the
London newspaper called it at the time. Upon the
occasion in question, Lieutenant Vyse was killed,
together with a number of private soldiers, and it
was reported that <q>the enemy was repulsed with
great loss.</q> In despatches and editorials the newspapers dwelt at great length upon this affair, as
showing the superior bravery and fighting ability
of the English forces. An immense to-do was made
about it, indeed, and everybody eagerly swallowed
the bait. This private letter I speak of contained

<pb n=129>
the first drop of actual truth that came to light in
regard to Egyptian matters. The communication
is quite interesting in every respect, and will be
found good reading. I give it in full:--

                                  <p>ALEXANDRIA, <datestruct value="1882-08-07"><month>Aug.</month> <day type=number>7,</day> <year>1882</year></datestruct>
   <p>Don't you think that, when the retreat is sounded a
correspondent, acting on the knowledge of his duties and
the presence of a newspaper telegraph station in the rear,
has a right to start early? Now, give this subject your
professional attention and forward your opinion. I got a
native servant on Tuesday, and he was shot to-day. What
does that betide to me? You see, he killed Europeans in June,
was out of the town in July, and was my servant in August.
For which of these offences do they kill him? And am I
very much to blame? If so, how much, and what had I
better do about it? And if you think I can't ask questions,
aint you wrong? What do you think about it? And why?
I should go on with a few more of these interesting conundrums, only that there are twelve fleas disputing the right
of way, and what do you think I had better do about that?
Try to kill twelve fleas, or let them slide and write a letter?
Referring to my servant, I call your attention to the paper
accompanying this mail.   He was convicted yesterday,
and shot by a file of the Khedive's soldiers this morning. He was always a riddle to me; now he is riddled
himself. I saw the shooting done, and tried to save him, but
in vain, and I owe the corpse five shillings, or one week's
wages. I have seen half-a-dozen men shot, and have been
under fire twice. Scared both times? Why, certainly. I
got into last night's action, and my chief anxiety was to
get out again. By reason of the rapidity of my retreat to
the rear, I beat the other fellows with the news to London
fully two hours. In the paper they have probably laid this
to my immense individual enterprise. It might as soon be

<pb n=130>

called enterprise as anything else, I suppose. The term is
pleasanter than <mentioned>"anxiety,"</mentioned> isn't it? How does this strike
you?
    <p>Seriously, we had a pretty good fight, and we were
whipped. Yes, whipped and driven. Nobody can telegraph the facts. The government revises all despatches,
and nothing of the nature can go out. This makes it hard
on a correspondent who is alive, and soft on the lazy ones.
There is no use staying in the field after the firing opens.
All you have got to do is to go and cable <q>Another victory
for the English,</q> and it don't make any difference whether
it is true or not. It don't take much work to do that, does it?
Just wait till you hear the guns and then announce your
victory. If this isn't a good scheme for the propagation of
honesty, and virtue, and things, in the press, I never heard
of one, that's all.
    <p>On this occasion we were whipped, and no mistake.
 Indeed, we were rather ignobly thrashed. Our men were
 drilling in the woods, and had no idea of an attack, when
 Arabi's force swooped down upon them. Our men fell back
 after the first attack, and what promised to be only a little
 skirmish became a good fight. The country is merely a
 neck of land, lying in a reverse curve. At both ends are
 the forces, -ours at one end, Arabi's at the other. On each
 side of the neck lies a lake. Our sailors, with two 9-pounders
 and one 40-pounder, went out to help the surprised party as
 soon as it had fallen back. They moved on a train, forming
 the right of our line. The left, made up of infantry and
 mounted infantry, went along the edge of the canal. And,
 to approach the enemy, we had only the canal on our left
 and the railroad on our right. It would seem to me that
 either side attacking the other at this point would be placed
 at a decided disadvantage, and, perhaps, before this reaches
 you the telegraph may bring you news that will show
 you how strong the defensive side is, - whichever one it
 may be at the time. In either case it will be big odds
 against the attacking party.
     <p>It is exactly as I tell you about the beginning of this fight

<pb n=131>
last night. Our boys were drilling when the ball was
opened by Arabi's forces. We were not feeling the enemy
at all, as the correspondents claim. Who says so either
lies or doesn't know, and possibly both. I happened to be
on the canal, and saw it all. So I know what I am talking
about. Our right was supported by the iron-clad train, as I
have just said. We advanced boldly enough, but our left
was almost immediately turned, and the enemy, using repeating rifles, soon drove us out of range. I may whisper
gently that we were mighty glad to go. After that we had
a rattling discharge of artillery on both sides, and at dark
we fell back to our own lines. I was speaking to Lieut.
Vyse a few minutes before he was shot, and I saw him die.
There was no surgeon on the field, and he bled to death. I
believe a tourniquet could have saved him, perhaps, or at least
have prolonged his life. But my lead-pencil broke when we
were attempting to use it to apply that kind of treatment,
and while we were using a bayonet to twist a handkerchief,
he passed away. We lost five killed and had twenty
wounded. The enemy took no prisoners, I believe, but we
captured seven wounded men and seven deserters. I got a
piece of shell through my light pantaloons. I am now
glad I had them built loose, otherwise there would not
have been room for my leg and the shell too. The reason
we fell back at dark was that our men would not stand any
longer; and I don't blame them very much. The enemy
were firing six shells to our one. They were in a better
position than we, and perhaps in stronger force. Under the
circumstances, we retreated to our hills, and the engagement
terminated. Glad of it? Well, you're shouting, young
man. It was not a creditable affair for our side, though our
naval force behaved splendidly. By the gods! they are
fighters, to a man. But the soldiers of the 46th, 38th, and
6oth acted like the most arrant cowards. They had to be
fairly driven up by their officers, who actually whipped them
forward with the flat sides of their swords. It was most
disgraceful.
   <p>I started this letter in peace and ink, but I am now

<pb n=132>
writing at Ramleh with a lead-pencil and at the tail end of
an alarm. All of Saturday's fight was on this crooked neck
of land. At some parts of it the canal crosses above the
level of the lake. In that same neck the first big fight will
take place, if Arabi defends his position, - which you can
bet he will. Arabi means business, my friend. Somehow,
he has got a notion that this is not a masquerade. He
knows what he is about, and he is doing some wonderfully
good work with his forces. He has a big army, and it is
rapidly becoming a mighty well-drilled army, too. The
men, so far as I can gather interviews with our prisoners,
have great confidence in him. They are afraid of him,
besides. He is generally believed to have been specially
inspired by Providence to defend his country. He is doing
nothing but defending it. His army is well clothed, well
fed, and well armed. Its Remington rifles are the very devil
on range and accuracy. Besides, the Egyptians are becoming
mighty good shots. They are tough and acclimatized, and
they can stand a great amount of fatigue under this blazing
sun.
   <p>Arabi's position is a good one, it seems to me. The
English position is equally good. Of course, Alexandria
cannot be retaken while the fleet remains. I lunched with
the American admiral a couple of weeks ago. He told me
the bombardment was a very simple affair. <q>The English
ships,</q> he said, <q>just stayed off out of range, and knocked
skillets of blue blazes out of the forts.</q> Easy, wasn't it?
But what is yet to come won't be so soft. We have no
longer the advantage of the farthest reaching guns and the
thickest armor. If we attack, Arabi has <mentioned>"got the edge,"</mentioned>
as poker-players say. If he attacks--but he won't. He
will content himself with the defensive, I fancy, and with
making it hot for anybody who comes too close.
   <p>I have a good horse and equipment, but no servant since
I lost Ali Mahoumed.   I really felt sorry when he went
to meet the Prophet. Alexandria is desolate. My city
quarters are good; my field quarters not so good. My
tent was pillaged the other night. I lost a revolver, eight

<pb n=133>
sovereigns in gold, and my letter of credit. The latter I
have regained, to all intents and purposes. The revolver
is a self-cocker, and likely to kill the fellow who stole it.
There is a grain of comfort in that. I paid &pound;95 ($475) for
my horse. You have no idea how costly some things are
here. But the horse is a good one. The only article that is
plentiful and cheap is the shy and acrobatic flea. This bird
grows to a monstrous size here, and he is wonderfully
plentiful. He carries a biting apparatus with him that is a
good deal like a two-inch auger, and makes a hole in you
straight to bed rock, like an artesian well, only not so
comfortable. If some of these chaps could be moved over
into Pennsylvania, and set to boring for oil, the chap who
imported them would make millions. If the fleas could be
made to take a real interest in the oil business, they would
fetch it, if they had to go plumb through to China.
   <p>There is no chance that we shall get out of here before
Christmas, -perhaps not for months after. The weather
is not half as bad as you would think. On the coast the
damp sea-breezes make it cool, and in the interior you can
stand 115&deg; when the evaporation is so great as to produce
a breeze. This is no fairy tale, but the unvarnished truth.
They are firing occasional shots along the line while I
write. Our sentries fire at anything, and, when they can't
see that, they blaze away at nothing. The city of Alexandria is in a bad way, and I should not be surprised if
there was another uprising. A few such defeats as yesterday will change the local color very materially, and mark
the change with blood. . . . .</quote>

   <p>To those readers who have gone through the
graphic account of the fight of <datestruct value="-08-05"><month>August</month> <day type=number>5th</day></datestruct> furnished
by this correspondent, the following <mentioned>"official"</mentioned>
report of the affair, issued by the war-office, will be
interesting reading.   It should be carefully compared with the account composed by the writer of

<pb n=134>



the letter I have copied, and which certainly is based
upon no motive of deception.
   <p>The official report is from Sir A. Alison, commanding officer (I believe), and dated Alexandria,
<datestruct value="-08-06"><month>Aug.</month> <day type=number>6,</day></datestruct> 1.35 A.M.:-

<quote><p>   Persistent native reports existing for the last two days
that Arabi was retiring from Kafr-ed-Dowar upon Damanhar, I determined to make a reconnoissance which would
ascertain clearly whether Arabi still held his original position strongly. For this purpose I directed a half battalion
of the Duke of Cornwall's light infantry, and a half
battalion of the South Staffordshire regiment, with one
9-pounder gun, and the whole of the mounted infantry, to
advance along the east bank of the Mahmoodeeyeh canal.
The 60th Rifles, with one 9-pounder gun, were to advance
along the west bank. These constituted my left attack.
They were to follow the line of the canal till they reached
a house in a grove of trees toward the point where the
railway coming from Cairo approaches nearest to the
canal. Along this line of rail a strong battalion of marines
was to come up in a train to the Mahalla junction, preceded
by the naval armored train, carrying one 40-pounder gun
and two 9-pounder guns, a Nordenfelt and two Gatlings.
The train was to stop at the Mahalla junction. The marines
were to detrain there, and advance by the railway line,
accompanied by the two 9-pounder guns, and covered by
the fire of the 40-pounder from the train. The left column
commencing its advance at 4.45 in the afternoon from
the outpicket station of the Ramlen lines, moving by both
banks of the canal; it soon came into action with the
enemy, who were strongly posted in a group of palm-trees
on the eastern side, and a strong defensible house and gardens upon the other. These positions were carried. At
the time Lieutenant Howard Vyse, of the Rifles, attached to
the mounted infantry, and a soldier of the corps were
killed.

<pb n=135>
<p>   The enemy then took up a second position half a mile in
 rear of the first, upon the east bank of the canal, among
 high crops and houses, and behind the irregular banks of
 the canal. From this position, also, the enemy was driven
 with greater loss. I accompanied the right column myself,
 which followed what was somewhat the chord of the arc
 upon which the left column was moving. I placed the
 marines and 9-pounder guns, dragged by blue-jackets, to
 the west of, and under cover of, the railway embankment,
 and moved them forward as rapidly as possible, and quite
 out of sight of the enemy engaged with Colonel Thackwell,
 with a view of cutting off their retreat. After a time our
 movement was perceived; the enemy opened upon us with
 artillery. I pushed on as rapidly as possible till I came to
 the point where the railway approaches nearest to the
 Mahmoodeyeh canal. I then opened fire with musketry
 from the railway embankment upon the enemy lining the
 banks of the Mahmoodeyeh canal. The two 9-pounders
were dragged up on to the embankment, and came into
action against the enemy's guns, the 40-pounder firing
over our heads against the point where the enemy's forces
were beginning to appear. Fixing my right upon both
sides of the embankment, I now threw forward two companies to carry a house near the canal, and followed up this
movement by throwing some four companies still more to
my left upon the banks of and across the canal. I had now
attained the position I wished, and formed a diagonal line
across both the canal and the railway. The enemy fell
back slowly before us. The fire of their 7-pounder and
9-centimetre guns, which they shortly after brought into
action, was speedily got under by the fire of my artillery. The object of the reconnoissance on my part was
attained. Desirous of inducing the enemy to develop his
full power before withdrawing, I held my position for about
three-quarters of an hour, until dusk was rapidly drawing
on. I determined now to withdraw. This movement was
carried out with the most perfect regularity and precision by
the marine battalion under Colonel Tuson. They fell back

<pb n=136>
by alternate companies with the regularity of a field-day.
Every attempt of the enemy to advance was crushed by the
beautiful precision of the 40-pounder and the steady
firing of the 9-pound naval guns. The losses of the enemy
seem to have been very great, and they were so dispirited
that, contrary to the usual practice of Asiatics, they made
no attempt to follow up our withdrawal. The guns and
troops were quietly entrained at the Mahalla junction, and
slowly steamed back to Alexandria. At the same time the
left column withdrew along the banks of the canal to the
Ramleh lines unmolested. As a reconnoissance the success
of the move was all that I could wish. I regret to state that
our loss has been somewhat heavy. It was especially so in
the marine battalion and seamen under my immediate
direction, who, I fear, have lost one man killed and some
twenty wounded. In the left attack, as far as I have yet
heard, there have been one officer and one private killed, and
six or seven privates wounded. The officer killed is, I grieve
to state, Lieutenant Howard Vyse, of the Rifles. He was one
of the most promising officers I have ever met. Detailed
lists of the killed and wounded will be telegraphed as soon
as received.</quote>

   <p>When two witnesses of a fight -one of them
wholly disinterested, and the other not quite so free-
send circumstantial reports of an engagement like
this, it is only fair to exercise our judgment as to
which should be believed. This is a privilege that
becomes doubly proper in this instance, when we
reflect that Sir A. Alison's <mentioned>"official"</mentioned> report was,
in the natural order of things, intended for publication, while the other, written privately from friend
to friend, was not.

  <p>MR. TOMPKINS and I went to the Derby.
           In England it is pronounced <mentioned>"Darby,"</mentioned> possibly because that pronunciation is incorrect. The
 race is a national event. Probably no other occurrence
 attracts so much of the world's attention, which goes
 to show that the world is pretty easily hoodwinked.
 I don't know what the Derby of old times amounted
 to. This one I know was not of much account. I
 have seen better races a hundred times in America,
 if not a hundred times better races. I went with
 Mr. Tompkins upon a modest scale. He told me on
 Tuesday night he had been studying up on Derby
 day, and thought he <mentioned>"had it down fine."</mentioned> So he
 drove around to my house next morning at 9 o'clock,
 in a Victoria drawn by a big bay horse, and officiated
 over by a long, lank coachman, whose livery and
 complexion were one beautiful and vivid hue of saffron.
    <q><p>This,</q> said Mr. Tompkins, cheerily, <q>aint a
 turnout quite equal to Astor's, but it's big and roomy,
 and, as we're going to sit in it the whole day, it's a
 heap better than being on a drag, cooped up with
 thirty or forty other people. I had to pay four
 guineas for this concern for the day. But hang the

<pb n=138>
expense! There won't be another Derby this year.
I went to a bar-room to get some wine to fetch along
this morning. Forgot it last night, and the spirit
stores were shut this morning. Wine isn't so much
cheaper here than in America. Mumm costs five
shillings a small bottle, which is $1.25, and it only
costs $1.50 in New York and Boston. I would have
kicked at the price, only it was a girl I bought it of,
and I hate to wrangle with a woman. One of the
funny things about these Britons is that they don't
seem to think there's anything degrading to a woman
in standing behind a bar ladling out liquor. The
whole scheme is wrong. In the first place a woman
isn't fit to tend bar. She's got no eye for the proper
size of a drink, and has to measure it out always.
In the second place, she never will be able to conquer
a mixed drink. Now, my wife, for instance, is a
reasonably intelligent woman. She can get up mixed
dishes that it makes my mouth water to think about.
But you should see Mrs. Tompkins struggle with a
cocktail. I used to be rather fond of cocktails, and
that dear woman undertook to learn the art of making
'em. Said she would keep me in fancy drinks, so I
wouldn't want to go rustling around town with the
boys of an evening. Well, she sickened me of cocktails in four days, and I can't bear the sight of one
now. Then she started in on punches, and she
settled my appetite in this direction in just one week.
Her intentions were A1, but her execution was
tough.</q>
   <q><p>If I had let her flicker along, producing mixed
drinks, she'd have made a teetotaler of me in three

  <pb n=139>
  months, because I shouldn't have been able to contemplate a bar-room without painful reminiscences
  of her work. No, sir. It aint in the female mind.
  She can't do it. You may talk about your wine,
  woman, and song, all you darn please, but they've no
  business together in a bar-room. There's something
  painful to me in seeing a girl placed where she's got
  to be civil to everybody who comes along, particularly
  when the everybody is likely to be pretty drunk as a
  general thing. When a young British cub is drunk,
  he is the most undesirable thing on top of this lowly
  footstool, and don't you forget it. Now, those girls
  behind the bars have got to talk and flirt with these
  chaps, so as to induce them to spend their money.
  What's worse, the girls are often good, virtuous
  young women when they begin the life of bar-maids.
  How long do you suppose they can keep so, providing they are pretty and attract the attention of
  wealthy and titled young chaps, who have nothing
  better to do than to go around hunting for victims of
  this kind?   It's a moral impossibility for a young
  girl,with nothing but a pretty face, to behave herself
  for long in a position where it becomes her business
  to debase men by getting them drunk, and to listen
  to everything they may like to say when they are in
  that condition. Every bar in London is waited upon
  by girls, and the prettier the girls the bigger the
  business.</q>
     <q><p>Did you hear of that case of the girl at the Criterion? No? Well, it's a pretty tough story. She
 was a very handsome girl, and the most popular one
in the place. All the young bloods were dangling

<pb n=140>

after her, and, among the lot, there was one good-
looking chap in particular, with a barrel of money
and a handle to his name. He finally plumped out
a proposition to make her his mistress and settle a
big lot of money on her, give her a carriage, and all
that. She repelled him the first time, but he kept at
her, and she yielded. Well, they lived together a
little while, and one day she killed herself. Remorse?  No.  That young scoundrel had been
guilty of the most infamous crime to her that it is
possible for a man to compass, and she took her own
life in despair at the prospect of passing the rest of
her days a wretched invalid. The man had to leave
the country for awhile, that's all. If this had been
in America he would have been strung up to the
nearest lamp-post. This was one result of the barmaid system.</q>
   <p>Mr. Tompkins fell into profound thought, which,
on the whole, was a relief, seeing that the day was
ostensibly one of pleasure, and not exactly the time
for moralizing. We were moving along at a fair
pace across Putney Heath, having crossed the river
on a shaky old bridge half a mile back, and I had
begun to fear that Mr. Tompkins's meditations would
make him gloomy all day. Putney is a rather pretty
place, and has some very handsome suburban residences. The Heath is a big field, a couple of square
miles in extent, I should say, and mainly covered
over with some sort of bushes having nasty yellow
blossoms. The open space was populated by a small
flock of sheep and a large man. Thus far we had
not come up with many teams on the road, and I

<pb n=141>
began to fear that we were going to be disappointed
in what I had been told was one of the main features
of Derby day. But three or four miles on another
road emptied its contents into ours, and matters
grew lively. I don't think I ever saw so many vehicles, or so many kinds of vehicles, in my life.
Omnibuses, with four horses hitched to each of
them, were packed inside and out with noisy, vulgar
crowds. Fine private coaches, with spanking teams,
were loaded with less vulgar but equally noisy
mobs.     Baggage-wagons, fitted with improvised
seats, had been turned into drags for the occasion.
Butchers' and grocers' carts bore along their owners
and all the shop employ&eacute;s, together with most of
their relatives, I should think. Little Irish jaunting-
cars, hitched to diminutive donkeys, carried five or
six people each. Indeed, the most striking thing to
be noticed all along was the small number of horses
and the large number of people. It seems to be
commonly understood in England that it isn't worth
while to have a horse unless you have got eight or
ten people for him to draw. For purposes of pleasure-driving, among the middle class, ponies are
chiefly employed, and you rarely see as few as two
persons riding behind one of these little animals.
Every day big carriages holding coachmen, footmen,
and four or five other people, used to roll laboriously
by my front windows drawn by single horses. The
practice seems to me to be cruel in the extreme, but
it doesn't appear to strike people that way in England.
    <p>As we proceeded the crowd grew thicker, and we

<pb n=142>

went by a great number of people on each side of the
road walking to Epsom, which is some sixteen or
eighteen miles from London. Some, already tired
out, were sleeping peacefully on the sward, and
others had stopped their carts for the purpose of absorbing their luncheons, although it was not yet 10.30
in the morning. It has always been a curious problem to me why anything in the shape of picnicking
should develop early and abnormal luncheons. But
it does. The crowd going to the Derby was, for the
most part, orderly enough, though there was everywhere apparent a desire to ostentatiously display the
fact that all hands were having a good time. Men
and women were singing together all sorts of musichall ditties, drinking out of mutual bottles, and
eating all sorts of food. Rough customers sat with their
arms about the waists of boisterous women, and there
was a general disposition to establish terms of intimacy with everybody who came along that was not
at all times pleasant. Such dust I have rarely encountered. A stiff wind came across the country,
and blew the fine particles of dirt almost through
one. Eyes, nostrils, and ears were soon filled with
the cloud, and everybody felt nasty and disagreeable,
excepting the lower part of the crowd, which was
apparently in its normal condition.
    <p><q>One thing you'll notice,</q> observed Mr. Tompkins, rubbing the sand out of his eyes,- <q>that is, if
you are able to notice anything at all through this
infernal dust, -the poorer the people in England
the more determined they are to go to horse-races.
Look at some of these fellows, who haven't a decent

<pb n=143>
suit of clothes to their backs. They seem to think
it's all right to spend a whole week's wages coming
out to a race, without stopping to think how far that
money would go toward purchasing comforts for them
in other directions.   You'll actually see 'em betting
on the result pretty soon. They're the very devil on
holidays, and they live like a lot of rats all the balance of the time, so as to enjoy themselves when days
like this come along. A man downtown tells me he
can't make his men work at all on holidays, and that
offers of double wages are scorned by them, just as
though they were all Vanderbilts. It's a funny
country, where a man would rather go on a bender
once a week and be poverty-stricken the balance of
the time, than live in tolerable comfort right along.
See those soldiers over there walking along with
women. Well, the females are servant-girls, and
they save up their earnings so as to take those red-
coated duffers out and treat them. Such are the
elevating practices of Her Majesty's troops! They
only get a few pence a day, but their red coats capture the cooks and scullions, and you can bet they
aren't going to suffer for the luxuries of life. So this
is what is called Epsom Downs, is it?   Well, I
should say Epsom Ups would be a much better
name. It's a nice old hill we've got to climb to get
there, anyway. That's English, though. If it was
flat as a board they would call it Mount Epsom.</q>
   <p>Mr. Tompkins was about right. We rode up a long
hill, and thence under the rear of the highest grandstand I ever saw. Then we began to inquire how to
get into the grounds. After interviewing four different



<pb n=144>

officials connected with the course without succeeding in discovering what we wanted, we finally
found a man who pointed out the way. It cost &pound;2
to drive in, but we managed to get a tolerably good
place close by the rail, about half way down the
home-stretch. The course is entirely different from
anything we have in America. There are not fifty
yards of level ground anywhere in the vast enclosure. I should say that a run of the whole circuit
must be about two miles long. On this side the
land slopes rapidly downward into a deep valley, so
that the horses run on ground that slants up toward
the outside rail. From the bottom of the valley the
way up on the other side is very steep, and where
the track runs along the crest of a ridge beyond it
must be two hundred or three hundred feet higher
than it is where we sit. Up toward the beginning
of the home-stretch is the placethey call Tattenham
Corner, and all England tells you what a terrible
place it is for a horse to come around. But that is
taffy. There are worse turns at Jerome Park and
  Sheepshead Bay. The only difficulty about this one
  is that it occurs where the horses are coming down
  a slight slope.
     <p>The Derby races begin part way around the
  course, as the distance they run is about a mile and
  a quarter, I believe. They start on an upward
  slope to the crest of the distant ridge, come down
  around Tattenham Corner into the straight stretch
  home, and end on a down-hill part of the track.
  The course is turfed, and not turned up, like those
  in America. Much of the space down in the valley

<pb n=145>
inside the track, and up on the hill beyond, is taken
up with refeshment tents, Punch and Judy shows,
those machines that send wooden horses around in
a circle, parties of men with blackened faces, -singing and dancing without time or tune, -jugglers,
acrobats, and a surging mass of people. From the
grand-stand for half a mile in each direction, outside
the track, there is the same sort of thing, added to a
tremendous crush of carriages, from which the
horses have been taken and housed for the day. A
third of the people present want to sell you something that is of no earthly use and that you wouldn't
be found dead with; and the other two-thirds want
to steal whatever you may have around your clothes.
They are the most accomplished thieves I ever encountered, and they will steal anything they can lay
hands on, no matter whether it is worth anything
or not.
   <p>I have seen some pretty big and some rather promiscuous crowds in America, but this one certainly
captured the prize in all respects.   There must
have been 600,000 people there. Nobody can convey a notion of such a crowd with mere figures.
It was at least ten times as large a gathering as I ever
saw at a race before. And, as I just remarked, I
have been on hand at some meetings which didn't
take a back seat under any ordinary pressure. And
what a mob this was, to be sure! It began to
eat and drink as soon as it came to a halt, and it kept
up a steady gait at filling all day.   It used viler
language than I ever heard in all my life, - and I
have lived in Montana. Nobody seemed to mind,

<pb n=146>

however, what anybody else said, which was a good
thing, because it would have been literally impossible to check that flow of obscene profanity by any
agency short of a streak of lightning.
   <p><q>Holy Moses!</q>    Thus Mr. Tompkins, while I
was looking around to see what I could find worth
remembering.
   <p><q>What's the matter now?</q> I asked.
   <p><q>Well, for first-class, downright swindles, I think
this takes the cracker barrel.   These races don't
begin till two o'clock, at all; and they are an hour
apart. A daisy of a time we'll have, sitting up
here like a couple of stoughton bottles, waiting five
hours for five races, won't we? Here's a miserable
five-furlong scramble at two o'clock, and we've got to
wait three hours before that begins. Then, there is
an hour to wait for the Derby, and after that, forty-
five minutes for another scramble; and so on.
Why, this is infamous! The idea of people getting
up at daybreak and riding twenty miles, at a cost of
several guineas, just to see a few races strung along
like this, is simply monstrous.</q>
    <p><q>Why didn't you stay at home, then?</q>
    <p><q>My son,</q> said Mr. Tompkins, <q>did you ever
hear the story of Horace Greeley and the returned
Californian?</q>
   <p>I had not.
   <p><q>Well, Greeley overheard a man in a restaurant
extolling California, saying its climate was the best
in the world, its fruits the finest this side of Paradise,
and, in short, that it was simply a heaven on earth,
and the only place fit for a man to live in. Greeley

<pb n=147>
thought he would be smart, so he asked: 'If this is
all as you say, my friend, why did you come away
from California?' And the chap simply turned
around and replied: ' Because I was a d-- d fule.'
My gentle gazelle, that's why I didn't stay at home
to-day. Let's go and bet something.</q>
   <p>Mr. Tompkins and I struggled up the course to
the grand-stand enclosure, where we had to pay
$2.50 each in addition to the $10 we had already
been made to lay out in entering the course. The
space in front of the stand was fenced in, and about
half the occupants were bookmakers. Many of them
wore white silk beaver hats and the most outrageous
checked suits of clothes you ever encountered. Some
of them shouted out their odds in voices that would
have made their fortunes before fog-horns were invented.   Others went about quietly booking bets
with people they knew. Off to the right of this
enclosure was another one, occupied by the Tattersall's bookmakers. Tattersall's, innocent and
guileless reader, is the place where all the high-toned
buying and selling of horse-flesh in London is done.
There the betting men do congregate between times,
and offer to <mentioned>"let you in."</mentioned> On the course at Epsom
they have a little yard all to themselves, and one
must be supplied with a special ticket if he wants to
enter. Mr. Tompkins booked &pound;5 against &pound;40 on
Sachem, &pound;5 against &pound;100 on Gerald, and &pound;5
against $30 on Dutch Oven. He backed the two
first because they were Americans, and the latter
because he was to be ridden by Archer, the famous
jockey. Sachem I had great faith in myself.   I



<pb n=148>

saw him run a magnificent race at Sheepshead Bay,
in the previous year, when he crowded Onondaga
all the way around. After we had been jostled
about for awhile, we went back to the carriage and
ate and drank and tried to be merry.
   <p>The five-furlongs race was finally disposed of, and,
after the longest hour I ever remember, the Derby
was begun. The first we saw of the horses they
were scuttling along the top of the distant ridge.
Bruce, who was a hot favorite, was in the last batch,
and Gerald was close up by the head, cutting out
the running. So far, so good. This we knew was
the Lorillard programme. Sachem, we had information, was heavily backed to win, and he was going
along beautifully under a jockey who sat heavily in
the saddle and did not help the colt a pennyweight.
As the animals came down around the Corner the
Americans were both going well. Bruce's tail went
up, and his jockey put the whip on freely. The
favorite was done. Archer was riding Dutch Oven
beautifully but hopelessly. A better jockey nobody
ever saw. He sits as lightly as a feather, and he
knows how to lift a horse at every stride. But the
race was not in Dutch Oven. Shotover, the winner
of the two thousand guineas a couple of weeks before,
was in the lead, and running well under a pretty
rider named Cannon. Then came Quicklime, struggling along under the whip, and, some distance
  behind, the others all in a bunch. Suddenly, half-
  way down the stretch, a chestnut colt, as clean of
  limb as a statue, and with a coat as glossy as a piece
  of satin, dashed out of the crowd with a bound like

<pb n=149>
  the spring of an antelope. Not a hair had he turned,
  and not a vein was swollen from the exertion up to
  now, in spite of his cumbersome rider. As Sachem
  dashed ahead, with that rare burst of speed, I thought
he had the race. But the jockey had given him his
head too late, and he finished a length behind Shotover, and a head behind Quicklime. Fifty yards
more would have brought the blue ribbon again into
Mr. Lorillard's stable. It was a race lost through
miscalculation and bad-riding, but lost just the same.
   <p>Shotover is only the second filly that ever won
the Derby, I believe, although the race had been run
annually for one hundred and three years. This
speaks badly for fillies, because the race is not a hard
one in any respect, and it is rarely run very fast.
This year it was interesting only to those who had
money on it. Purely as a matter of disinterested
observation it was not worth attention.   All the
Americans lost heavily. They backed Lorillard to
a man.     If Lorillard had supplied himself with
riders to compare with his horses, he would have
furnished a great many of his countrymen with their
Derby-day expenses. I am told the day cost him
individually about $20,000.
   <p>Mr. Tompkins felt blue and desperate. To get even
he backed some more horses in the next race. One of
them bolted at the start, and came down a couple of
hundred yards behind the rest, and the other just
escaped being distanced. Then, in the last race but
one, Mr. Tompkins adopted a singular method of
selecting a winner. He took a shilling out of his
pocket and ascertained that it had been coined in

<pb n=150>

<datestruct value="1876--"><year>1876</year></datestruct>. Taking the last figure for his guide, he looked
over the race-card and found that No. 6 was a horse
named Phantom, which was practically unbacked.
Nobody dreamed that he could win, and Mr. Tompkins got odds of thirty to one. He invested &pound;5, and
Phantom took the race at a canter. So, on the
whole, my companion came out quite successfully on
his day. After the racing was all over, it took us a
clear hour to get started homeward, and after we were
started we spent a good deal more time remaining
stock-still in the road, waiting for the teams ahead,
than we did in travelling. By this hour, as might
reasonably be expected, a great many people were
pretty well <mentioned>"over the bay,"</mentioned> and the scenes along the
road were not all of them extremely pleasing. Some
of the crowd had squirt-guns, and amused themselves
with wetting everybody who drove by. One gang
of roughs in an omnibus had a lot of articles of
crockery, which delicacy forbids my naming, and
they were extracting fun from the pastime of filling
these with soda-water and emptying them upon
passers-by. I am informed that the mob in former
days was in the habit of throwing flour, red-ochre,
and other stuff upon people who happened to wear
clothes that were worth spoiling. But I didn't see
anything quite so bad as that on this occasion. The
squirting made Mr. Tompkins furious. Somehow
he couldn't see the fun of being soaked with water
to make a British holiday. So he hit one offender
on the head with a ginger-beer bottle, broke the butt
of a coach-whip over the face of another, and cut a
gash in the eye of a third with the lash. After that

<pb n=151>
he was let alone. He was threatened and expostulated with, but he was pretty angry, and words had
no effect on him
    <p><q>I say,</q> yelled the ginger-beer man, <q>what are
you doin' of?</q>
   <p><q>Hitting back, blank dash you!</q> responded the
amiable Mr. Tompkins.
   <p><q>Cawn't you let a feller have a little fun?</q> blubbered the fellow, whose nose was bleeding freely.
   <p><q>Cert,</q> responded my companion, aiming at another squirt-gun fiend. <q>Come along. Have all
the fun you want; but I'm going to have a little of
it myself, and don't you forget it.</q>
   <p>They didn't. I don't believe some of them have
forgotten it yet. But they didn't seem to appreciate
Mr. Tompkins' sense of humor. There are some
men who never can see a joke. There are others
who can only see those they play on somebody else.
Englishmen clearly think it is not funny to spoil
their noses simply because it suits them to spoil other
people's clothes.

     <p>AMERICANS generally look with wondering
     eyes at that peculiarly arid spot in the great
 Sahara of London journalism known as the <title>Court
 Circular</title>. In it, as all are aware, the doings of Her
 Majesty, and the accessory members of the royal
 family, are chronicled from day to day. The type is
 probably left standing at all times, for in the <title>Circular</title> there is little variation. The queen walks out
 one day accompanied by the melancholy Beatrice;
 drives out in the afternoon with two or three sycophantic court ladies; and vegetates with charming
 monotony between <emph>Balmoral</emph> and London.
    <p>Yet the English newspaper readers love this little
bit of nonsense. They really consider it legitimate,
honest, and warranted gossip. No attempt is ever
made to give them more palatable food, and probably any innovation in that direction would meet at
first with censure. What strikes Americans as so
exceedingly abnormal in this so-called monarchy is
that probably not one in five hundred of the newspaper readers who gloat over the stereotyped inanity
of the <title>Court Circular</title> has ever seen Queen Victoria.
   <p>The portrait of Her Majesty is not inspiring. In

<pb n=153>
the old days of chivalry she would neither have
incited the gallant knights to deeds of prowess, nor
presented a particularly edifying appearance on the
tournament field. But the newspaper readers have
ideal notions of their queen, and their veneration
is all the more profound because they know absolutely nothing of her doings beyond the vapid
chronicles of the <title>Court Circular</title>.
   <p>I have on various occasions shown to English
friends American papers in which the alleged humorists have pictured Her Majesty breakfasting on
the throne, and calling to her maid to let nobody in
until she has her crown on. I have been shocked
on several occasions to find that my English friends
positively accepted all this as gospel, and treasured
up the exaggerated facts to be repeated, with compound interest, at the next kettle-drum or tennis
party. I don't mean to say that many Englishmen
would believe such palpable fiction, but I do assert
that they have been credited by people who were
otherwise shrewd and canny, and have made folks
angry who ought to know better.
   <p>Queen Victoria's private life is not particularly
cheerful. I think if I had her money, and her propensities for adding to it, I could have a tolerably
good time, and insure a similar fate for a select few.
She takes nearly all her meals alone, and in the imposing palaces which present such vast proportions
to the external world, Her Majesty occupies a small
suite of rooms, in which- to use an English expression of force and inelegance- <mentioned>"you couldn't swing
a cat."</mentioned> When there is a dinner party, the hour for

<pb n=154>

the repast is invariably nine o'clock. The queen
positively declines to countenance that <foreign lang=fr>mauvais
quart d'heure</foreign> before dinner which is so generally
acknowledged to tax the patience of the most patient.
She enters the room at 8.55, waits till the hour has
struck, and then proceeds to the banquet-table with
her guests.
   <p>Her Majesty's dinners are not very long. In fact,
a club dinner at the Brunswick or Delmonico's occupies far more time. At ten o'clock it is all over, and
each guest has the exceeding privilege of a few
words with the queen. It is a remarkably regular
performance- a kind of <mentioned>"your turn next"</mentioned> proceeding. The flow of Her Majesty's eloquence is turned
upon each guest, and each guest looks forward to his
few moments of royal conversation with flamboyant
eagerness.
   <p>The queen can talk. She is not the nonentity she
is forced by the English system of politics to appear.
She has opinions of her own - and very pronounced
ones, too, let me tell you. She is exceedingly human, and she likes beer. Her knowledge of human
nature is also very deep, and she knows her guests
long before they could possibly know her.
   <p>Her Majesty's morbid taste for the melancholy is
generally censured. Her rigid observance of death
anniversaries, and her earnest and untiring readiness
to put the whole court into mourning on the least
provocation, are widely commented upon.
   <p>The court ladies, who are a kind of titled chambermaids, do not have such a merry time in the palaces
as is popularly supposed. The queen, like Katisha,

<pb n=155>
<mentioned>"is as tough as a bone, with a will of her own."</mentioned>
The court ladies must be prepared to answer her
least want.
    <p>Queen Victoria seldom reads a newspaper. One
of the principal duties of her court ladies is
to read it aloud. The queen never personally
discharges a member of her household.     This
most unpleasant task is, in nearly every case, confided to the Marchioness of Ely. Her Majesty, like
the majority of her female subjects, is intensely capricious, - strange as caprice may appear when spoken
of in connection with a stout old lady. She frequently tires of her ladies, because she has seen them
around so much, or because familiarity has not
unaccountably bred contempt.
    <p>The grand master of British ceremonies is His
 Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. The queen
 takes little part in public affairs, but expects her son
 to do everything for her; and he does it well. With
 his charming princess he presides at levees and
 drawing-rooms, with his imposing figure, which
 the English people are allowed to gaze upon, and
 which is nearly the only proof they have that the
 <title>Court Circular</title> is not what is called in journalistic
 circles a <mentioned>"fake,"</mentioned> and a precious badly written one,
 at that.
    <p>The Prince of Wales is fearfully respectable. He
 is obliged to be. Some ten years ago he had not become thoroughly convinced of that fact. He was in
 Paris much more frequently than in London. He
 was at the popular caf&eacute;s, and not the first-class theatres. He was generally known in the French metropolis

<pb n=156>

as a <foreign lang=fr>bon garcon</foreign>. We have changed all that if
you please, and also if you don't.
   <p>The Prince of Wales is the model by which all
Britishers swear. He sets the fashions, sits in judgment upon etiquette, and endeavors by making a
veritable martyr of himself to show people what they
ought to do. The adoration of His Royal Highness
is carried to a ridiculous extent. Some years ago
the Prince of Wales came hurriedly out of a Pall
Mall club. He was so pressed for time that he
almost ran. In his haste he had forgotten his gloves.
Half-a-dozen gentlemen saw the prince in this condition, and for the following two years it was the
fashion to use no gloves. <q>The Prince of Wales
doesn't wear them,</q> was the reason assigned; and,
needless to say, it was all-convincing.
   <p>The Prince of Wales is responsible - in England
- for the habit of smoking after dinner before leaving the table. It is owing to his utter absence of
predjudice or conservatism that actors and actresses
have been admitted to drawing-rooms; and by
extensively patronizing the theatres himself, he has
instilled that rage for <mentioned>"first nights"</mentioned> which has become
an acknowledged part of the English social curriculum. Prince Albert Edward is intensely decorous.
He thoroughly believes--or pretends to thoroughly
believe -that to be happy you must be virtuous.
This belief came upon him rather late in life, but-
it came.
   <p>He rarely fails to attend church on Sunday. It is
pretty generally acknowledged that a nation of church-goers is infinitely more prosperous than a nation of

<pb n=157>
infidels. During his numerous and protracted sojourns
in Paris not a single newspaper man was ever able
to discover that His Royal Highness went to church
in the French metropolis. But in England it is
another thing. Church is a necessity, and the prince
rightly reasons that if the nobility pray regularly in
public, the common herd will do likewise with all
that blind, unquestioning faith for which they have
long been famous - as a new reporter would sagely
remark.
    <p>The prince is well paid, and there is little probability that he will strike; but he works wonderfully
hard, and is in point of fact indefatigable. He is
obliged to <mentioned>"do"</mentioned> the theatres, because, as I have
said, his presence in the playhouses is an established
custom; then he attends public dinners; opens all
sorts and conditions of institutions with pertinent
observations and a sweet smile; and frequently presides at club entertainments. An institution which
can claim the patronage or attention of the Prince of
Wales needs no other advertisement. He has allowed
the Savage Club to enroll him among its members,
and I don't think I have ever heard any one allude to
that jovial band of Bohemians without concluding
his remarks with, <q>The Prince of Wales belongs,
don't you know, - awfully jolly, isn't it?</q> The new
club in Covent Garden simply exists through the
Prince of Wales' patronage.
   <p>The Prince of Wales is the backbone of English
society. Without him it could no more live than could
a man minus his spinal cord. The English are not
original. They must follow an example; see their

<pb n=158>

model before them; and have something to bow
down to with that servility which is so wantonly
exaggerated.
   <p>I don't mean to say that we Americans are above
such servility. We are not. There is a class-
and a large one, too--in New York City, which
toadies to the Prince of Wales as absolutely as any
of the Londoners. To be sure, they have no acquaintance with His Royal Highness. But they
meet his disciples, and get their lesson at second hand.
    <P>Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, is not jealous
 of his elder brother. He might have been forced to
 play second fiddle if his proclivities had at all tended
 in the same direction as those of the Prince of
 Wales. But he is another sort of man, altogether.
 He is a business man. If it had happened that his
 lot had been cast with Leadenhall-street merchants
 or Cheapside retail-dealers, he would probably have
 risen in his business to gigantic prosperity. Whatever he gets hold of never leaves him without a
 protracted struggle.   I don't believe nature ever
 meant him to be a prince. It was not his calling.
 As it is, however, his business instincts are, fortunately or unfortunately, not entirely thrown away.
 The fact is that he receives less money than his
 position warrants.   He is obliged to live rather
 extensively and present an imposing exterior. But
 the funds are wanting, and he is forced to be thrifty
 in order to make ends meet. Personally he is not
 nearly as much of a gentleman as the Prince of
 Wales. He is politely bearish, and compromisingly
 candid. He has no more tact than a bull-pup with


 <pb n=159>
 acute indigestion. He is not particularly popular.
 You know he married a Russian princess, and between England and Russia there is no superfluous
 love. When the Duchess of Edinburgh first appeared in London social circles her reception was
 chilling in the extreme; and it has never been
 particularly warm. She is not prepossessing to look
 at. Her bulk is enormous; her face rather expressionless, and her whole appearance that of a
 stolid English shopkeeper out for Sunday.
   <p>The Duke of Edinburgh has recently amused
American newspaper readers by abstaining from
violin-playing on account of the criticisms which
were the result of his performances. In England
no one dared to smile at this royal caprice. Thankful as the Britishers may secretly feel at the cessation
of the musical infliction, they are wont to speak of
it with mournful countenances and in funereal accents. The Duke of Edinburgh is sometimes called
upon to make a speech. I wish you could hear
him. He is the veritable disciple of the Oxford
drawl and the parliamentary hiccup. He hums and
haws, alludes to the auspicious occasion, and when
he sits down everybody is in a state of complete but
happy ignorance as to what he intended to say and
how he intended to say it.
   <p>The other princes and princesses play unimportant <foreign lang=fr>r&ocirc;les</foreign> in the monotonous round of English
society, and I don't think I should particularly edify
my readers by dwelling upon those <foreign lang=fr>r&ocirc;les</foreign> at greater
length.
   <p>The general society of London has its peculiarities,

<pb n=160>

its pomps and pageants, its follies and its foibles. It
is customary to look upon French society as the most
utterly shocking and immoral exhibition of depravity
in high places that the world has ever produced.
Parisian social circles, to be sure, are not at all times
as chaste as they might be. I have never struck the
society of any great metropolis that would make the
Puritan fathers and mothers bow down in hopeless
emulation. But as between Paris and London the
impartial seeker for social cleanliness would not be
long in making up his mind. London, in sheer
cold-blooded looseness, is beyond anything in the
world, not barring the Sandwich Islands. English
girls of the higher order are not included in any sweeping inference I may convey. They are, like the girls
of all European countries, so fenced around with
barriers and safeguards that they would have to rise
early for indiscretions, even if they had wishes in
this direction.
   <p>But as soon as a woman is married, she may cut
loose if she so wishes. English husbands are mainly
to blame for this sort of thing. They love their clubs
more than their homes, and they let their wives trot
around by themselves whither they will. A man
who makes it a habit to either dine out or to leave
the house as soon as dinner is disposed of, remaining
away for many hours at a stretch, can hardly hope to
build up a lively degree of enthusiasm for himself in
the family circle. But that is a largely developed
custom in much of the society of London. The
wife, meanwhile, goes to theatres, receptions, balls,
and the like, at her own sweet will, and without her

<pb n=161>
husband. If she be attractive, attentions come upon
her which, in the absence of cordiality on the part
of her matrimonial partner, some day come to be
agreeable. It is all very natural.
   <p>Marriages all over Europe are made as a general
thing for reasons of interest. The higher one climbs
upon the social step-ladder the more business-like
the matrimony. Men are scarce in Great Britain,
and the fact that they are so is probably what makes
them place so high a value upon themselves. If I
were an American of good presence who wanted to
marry a woman who had money, and who would be
grateful to bestow it upon me for the honor of being
my wedded slave all her life, I should go to England.
There are plenty of fortunes to be had there upon
those terms. But I would rather marry an American
girl, squabbles and all, than an English maiden with
her servility. If there is no family dissension there
is apt to be more or less forgetfulness of family responsibilities. Unalloyed serenity in the domestic
circle is a snare, - pleasant if you like, but a snare
all the same.

 <p>THERE is in this country a tendency to add to
         the list of holidays, but England is the place
where these things abound. I have never seen any
thing like it. There are the regular holidays, which
we have in this country, excepting perhaps the
Fourth of July and Washington's birthday, which
Englishmen can hardly see the propriety of keeping.
But in addition to the ordinary pleasure-making days
in England there are four of what are called bank
holidays. They have already been alluded to in
passing. They occur once in every three months;
and when the cautious citizen sees a bank holiday
coming he goes home and stays there until it is over.
The bank holiday is simply a signal for a grand
national spree. A wedding, a birth, or a funeral in
the royal family is an excuse for another holiday, and
as the royal family is by no means small these occasions come pretty often, - not, however, as frequently
as might be wished. Everybody is full of the royal
business. Shop-keepers can't do anything for you
on account of the approaching ceremony. You find
it impossible to hire a carriage, owing to the same
affair, and, in fact, everything stops but the rain.
That would let up, too, if there were an Englishman

<pb n=163>
in charge of the sprinkling apparatus. There are
no people in the world so hopelessly given over to
holidays as the English. One day I asked a furniture-dealer to send a man up to measure my front
hall. <q>Can't do it after one o'clock on Saturday,</q>
said he. <q>Our men won't work after that hour.</q>
    <p><q>Not if it is money in their pockets?</q> inquired
 the innocent American.
    <p><q>They don't want money in their pockets,</q> replied the shopkeeper, with a pitying look. <q>What
 they want is to get the money out of their pockets.
 Half of my men won't go to work at all till Wednesday or Thursday. Then they stay at it night and
 day till Saturday noon. After that they take a holiday till their money is gone. Then, if there is a
racing-meeting in the middle of the week, away they
go, and leave the shop empty. It is impossible to
control them. They will have their good times
whether their employer likes it or not.</q>
    <p>I went away reflecting that what with legal holidays and those which are taken, whether they are
 legal or not, the British workman has a pretty fat
 thing of it. When the Englishman goes in for a
 general drinking-bout, as he always does when holidays approach, he who observes it is likely to
 witness a sight that will astonish all his senses. We
 do not know what drinking means on this side of the
 Atlantic. The year I was in London our Consul-
 General prepared a report which took in this department of English life. Enough liquor was drunk
 that year to pay one-third of the rents of Great
 Britain, or to buy two-thirds of all the clothing worn

<pb n=164>

in the United Kingdom, or to have nearly half fed all
the people in England and Scotland. Nothing can
prevent the English workingman from drinking
about eight times as much as is good for him.
   <p>The shopkeepers, contractors, and other employers
of labor in England are at the mercy of the laborers,
few of whom return to their duties before Tuesday
of each week. They seem to go on the theory that
four days of work entitle them to three days of drunk.
Every holiday means a spree of nearly a week's duration. It requires three days of preparation and three
days more to sober up in. We think in this country
that we have a good many roughs in our population,
but when we have been introduced to the British
workman, on his native heath, we are apt to believe
our ruffian is the most polite, genteel, and refined
personage on the face of the earth. In every respect
the English loafer is the lowest, most despicable
blackguard in the world. He is simply a bull-dog,
without the redeeming traits of that animal. I have
known of their crossing the street in order to jostle
ladies from the sidewalk, if the ladies happened to
strike them as being well-dressed.   Brutality runs
wild among these people. They love to fight with
  each other, and in their squalid homes they delight
  to finish up their work on their wives. But they
  hold all Americans in very healthy awe. They do
  not in the least mind a heavy thrashing, but they
  have a very great deal of reverence for the business-
  like way in which Americans get to work on occasions of this kind.
     <p>One night I was going with a countryman of mine

<pb n=165>
through one of the little streets leading out of Leicester
square. A burly fellow was engaged in the legitimate
English pastime of thrashing his wife, when the
eye of my friend fell upon the scene. He took that
brawny Briton by the throat and threw him nearly
across the street. The bruised and battered wife
slunk away, and the husband came back foaming
with rage. A crowd soon gathered, and it looked
as though there would be carnage. The mob urged
the fellow to avenge the insult of the foreigner who
had interfered in his constitutional right to beat his
spouse. The man blustered for a few moments, hesitated, and stood irresolute. A bystander said, <q>Why
don't you 'it 'im, Bill?</q>
   <p>The man replied, helplessly, <q>I would, only he's
an American, and he'd hit me when I'm down.</q>
   <p>Then he actually began to cry. The crowd looked
rather threatening, and my friend picked up a heavy
stone.
   <p><q>You bet I would!</q> he exclaimed; <q>I'd kill you
deader than a herring!</q>
   <p>I honestly think it was one of the funniest pictures
I ever saw. There was not a man in the crowd who
could not have pulverized both of us, single-handed,
and if we had been their wives they would probably
have done it. But the mere fact that we were
Americans, and that Americans are supposed to
come of a family who kill, cleared the way for us.
To tell you the truth, we were pretty glad of it.
    <p>All the lower classes in England are simply revolting. There is no such depth of lowness
    anywhere else in the world. In many parts of London



<pb n=166>

it is absolutely unsafe for people to go without police
protection.   Drunken women lie in the gutters,
drunken men stagger about the streets, and drunken
children lie helplessly on the floors. The roads at
night are full of painted women and young girls who
swarm on all sides in numbers that are simply amazing.   There is no attempt to check them. They
chaff with the police, with whom they seem to be
friendly, and one can hardly escape them. Theyare
in all the bar-rooms, and flaunt their sin through all
the town. About half of them are girls less than
fifteen years old.   Such immorality I have never
seen.
    <p>In the afternoons, up near a string of shops, in a
roofed alley-way, called the Burlington Arcade, I
have seen young swells, members of good families,
spending all the afternoon walking up and down
with these women. They seem rather proud of it,
too. One may have very tough sensibilities, and yet
be shocked in London.
    <p>The hopeless poverty of the poor and the vast
 wealth of the rich in England are what leads to this
 dreadful condition. Everything seems to be owned
 by a comparatively few people. The Duke of Bedford, for instance, owns acres upon acres in the very
 heart of London. Whole streets belong to him, and
 at night these streets are closed by gates at the ends.
 No carriages can go through, and if you live at the
 other side of the Duke of Bedford's property you
 must drive clear around it in order to get home.
 The revenues from these estates are immense, even
 fabulous. The same system prevails all over England.

<pb n=167>

Great properties are held intact generation
after generation, bringing their owners higher and
higher rents from year to year. The rich are growing
richer and the poor poorer all the time. The Duke
of Westminster, for instance, has an income which
ranges close to three-fourths of a million of dollars a
year, and it is growing every day he exists. He
lives in his palace, shut in by a high wall, exclusive
and high-bred. His millions go unemployed, while
the poor of London are starving in the slums, where
desperate degradation is doing its work.   There
must be an end to this, for under the present system
it is only a question when the Westminsters, the
Bedfords, and the rest, will have every penny. In
the dogged faces of the lower grades of English
beings there is danger. In their breasts the fires of
discontent are slumbering. If there is no adjustment
which will lead a peaceful way out of the growing
  difficulties of Great Britain, they will be swept away
  by the bludgeon and the torch. The wall is crumbling, and the social forces are at work.

</LIST>

 <p>HOTEL life in the English metropolis is one of
           the things which most puzzles and annoys
American tourists. It is a singular thing that in a
city like this, which is visited every year by tens of
thousands of travelling Americans, there should be
no one institution of the kind which has adopted any
of the methods most prevalent in our country. The
system by which London hotels are governed certainly might be improved in many directions. But
the business of conducting these establishments ought
to be highly profitable, if the indications of the extent
to which hotel living is carried on are at all reliable.
    <p>There are more hotels to the square inch in this
 centre than in any other large city I have ever visited,
 and tremendous structures to be devoted to this kind
 of business are being erected all the time. Yet it is
 impossible to get into any first-class London hotel at
 all unless you apply for rooms several days in advance, and even then it is not always an easy
 matter to find respectable accommodations. Curiously
 enough the hotels which make the strongest appeal
 for American patronage are the ones which are most
 un-American.

<pb n=169>
   <p>A few years ago the Langham was the great resort
for tourists from the United States. That house
seems, however, to have been very largely given up
by American travellers, for the reason that its exactions in the monetary way are altogether beyond
reason. During the past year or two the big syndicate
which controls the three largest hotels in London has
advertised heavily in the American papers, and has
succeeded in attracting to one or the other of its establishments a very great deal of the patronage of
people visiting London from the Yankee side of the
herring pond. This syndicate controls the Grand
Hotel, the Metropole, and the First Avenue. All of
them are immense, and all of them are carried on
with a degree of red tape and flummery such as I
have never seen equalled in any place of the kind.
   <p>The First Avenue is the hotel most advertised in
America. It is situated away up on Holborn, a mile
and a half from the centres most affected by American tourists, and consequently it is very far out of the
way. That, however, is not the point. What attracts particular attention and causes considerable
rage is the lot of tomfoolery one has to go through
in order to comply with the customs of this and
the other big London establishments. On entering
the rotunda, which is a lofty and finely decorated
affair, you are shown into a small apartment which
is called the secretary's office. There a watery,
colorless sort of young man sits behind a desk, upon
which lies a huge volume for the registration of
names. After you have written down who you are
and where you come from, the diluted young gentleman

<pb n=170>

tells you there is no room in the house. Then
you argue with him for a few minutes, and he finds
that he has just one apartment left, for which he
consents to put you down as a matter indicating his
personal though condescending consideration for
you.
   <p>Having thus broken the ice, you are handed a
little round slip of paper, on which is printed the
name of the hotel, and in the centre of which is
written the price which you are to pay for your
apartments. You are then conducted with great
ceremony to the <mentioned>"lift,"</mentioned> the same being in our
nomenclature the elevator. This craft moves up the
shaft with great caution, and about half a floor before your landing stage is reached, the pilot checks
the movement of the car, so that you are longer in
traversing that last five or six feet of your journey than
you have been even with all the rest. It is done so
as to avoid shocking your nerves, because the elevator man, knowing you to be a wild botanic product
of America, thinks you were never in an elevator
before.
    <p>Arrived at the landing stage, the man in charge of
 the elevator, with large and impressive ceremony,
 throws open the wide doors, and you are led to your
 room. It is usually a little pigeon-hole under the
 eaves of the house, with not overclean windows, and
 not many of them. If you happen to want anything,
 you ring, and the chambermaid comes to interview
 you. To her you confide your wants, and she goes
 away. If, for instance, you require a nip of something stimulating, the chambermaid conveys your

<pb n=171>

    wish to somebody at the other end of a speaking-
    tube, and in the course of half an hour your desire is
    complied with. So it goes. There is no bell-boy,
    no ice-water, no anything to which you are accustomed in America. If you want to find out
    anything you do not go to the office where you have
    registered your name, but you seek a radiantly decorated personage, all smiles, importance, and gold lace,
    who goes by the title of the <mentioned>"hall porter."</mentioned> He has
    charge of the keys of the letter-boxes, and of almost
    everything else. He is a moving encyclopedia, and
    can tell you anything you want to know. The fact
  that he generally tells you wrong has little or nothing
  to do with it; he tells you, and that is at least worth
  knowing.
     <p>If anybody comes to the hotel to inquire for you
  he interviews the hall porter, who calls a servant,
  who blows up a tube to the chambermaid, who misunderstands the name and goes to somebody's else
  room, then returning and conveying the important
  information that you are not in. If a letter is sent to
  you, it sometimes reaches its proper destination and
  sometimes it does not. Should you not be at home
  when your mail is delivered, you will find it on
  entering your room at night. It is enclosed in a
  large envelope about eight inches long by six broad,
  upon the face of which is printed in thick black letters the information that this package is <mentioned>"Visitor's
Mail."</mentioned> The number of your room is scratched upon
it in pencil. But why all this trouble is adopted
continues indefinitely to be a mystery. It would be
quite as satisfactory if your letters were simply

<pb n=172>

tucked under the door without this nonsensical big
envelope.
   <p>There are no fees or gratuity exacted in the First
Avenue Hotel and kindred resorts; but if you wish
to be well served you will pay for it just the same.
Anybody in the house will take anything he can get
hold of. Even the mighty potentate in gold lace
will accept sixpence and thank you for it, and the
red-cheeked chamber-maid who sews on your buttons
and ties your scarf will sweetly simper her gratitude
for anything above or below a shilling.
    <p>You are not supposed to smoke in your room,
 and placards hung upon the walls notify you that the
 management would be extremely shocked if you were
 to puff at your cigar in the corridors. Downstairs
 there is a big reading-room, where you can go to run
 through your morning paper, or to write a letter.
 Here, too, smoking is forbidden.   Down in the
 cellar there is an apartment devoted to that pleasure,
 and you are expected to avail yourself of this subterranean resort if you desire to smoke at all.
     <p>There are two dining-rooms, and in one of them
 you are not allowed to order breakfast after ten o'clock
 in the morning. As the other is invariably full, you
 usually have an altercation with the head-waiter,
 which ultimately results in his breaking the rules of
 the house, and putting you in the large apartment.
 This means a fee, of course. The coffee is steadily
 and inflexibly bad.
     <p>It is a curious feature of London hotels that they
  do not have palatable coffee, even by accident. But
  there are a number of tasty breakfast dishes which

<pb n=173>
we do not have in America, and which exactly fit
the requirements of that repast.   Fried sole, kippered herrings, haddock, and such things, while
extremely inexpensive, are just the articles which the
stomach craves early in the morning, without the intervention of cocktails. There are strawberries, too,
upon the English table, which very far exceed anything we have yet been able to produce in our
latitudes. It is not at all uncommon to see baskets of
this fruit nearly as large as hen's eggs, and at the
same time of the most delicate and delicious flavor.
The berries are served there with the hulls on, and
are generally conveyed to the mouth with the fingers.
You put a little heap of sugar on your plate, take
your strawberry up by the hull, dip it in the sugar
and then eat it.
   <p>Dinner is served in any quantity of courses, and is
consumed with great ceremony. The dress suit is
not indispensable, but it is desirable, and almost
everybody wears it. There is little solidity about
this meal at such places as the First Avenue. It is all
style and flummery.      Only at the old-fashioned
hotels, of which Morley's is, perhaps, the best example, do you get good, solid, plainly-cooked food.
At the other places it is all style and no comfort.
   <p>When you remember that only a few years ago
London got along in perfect serenity so far as hotel
accommodations were concerned, and that since then
a dozen tremendous edifices have been built for the
accommodation of the travelling public, you are
naturally inclined to wonder somewhat at the regular
way in which you are informed that there is not a

<pb n=174>

room in the house. You stand about the door-way
for an hour or two, at any time during the day, and
you see hardly anybody going in or coming out.
You begin to suspect that the whole thing is a game
of bluff, and that the London hotel-keeper goes upon
the theory that the average traveller accumulates
anxiety to get into a given house in exact ratio to the
difficulty he experiences in carrying out his wish.
   <p>It was only the other day that the syndicate owning the three houses I have before mentioned, opened
the Hotel M&eacute;tropole, which is their largest and
newest structure.   On the second day after the
doors were opened they sent two hundred people
away, telling them that there were no accommodations. It is hardly possible that a house so big, so
new, and so utterly unknown, should have been filled
to overflowing in such a short space of time. Accommodations at these places are just about as
expensive as they are at the good hotels in New York and
Boston. For the little dark pigeon-hole which I was
given at the First Avenue Hotel I paid $1.25 a day,
which, in addition to the various gratuities expected
of me, brought the price up to about $1.50 or $1.75.
All the little extras, which are not counted in New
York or any other American city, are rigidly charged
for in London, and the cost of living, when your
breakfasts, luncheons, and dinners are taken into
consideration, is fully equal to what it would be on
our side of the water.
   <p>A coup&eacute;, such as we could get for $1.00 an hour in
New York, costs $1.25 in the English capital. Every
luxury is dearer in London than it is in America.

<pb n=175>
The necessities, however, are cheaper. Poor people
can live better there for the same outlay than they
can in America; but rich ones have to pay the
difference. It is astonishing to see the vast number
of young men in the British metropolis who have
nothing on earth to do but spend their incomes, and
it is certainly true that they do spend their money
with reckless prodigality.
    <p>One American, who has lived here for some time,
has an exceedingly novel idea of the theories of life
in England. He was saying to me one day that
nobody does any work in Great Britain. <q>You give
a man a pair of lace curtains to be cleaned and repaired at a cost of &pound;2. He gives them to somebody
else who agrees to do the work for &pound;1 10s. That
person in turn sends the curtains into the country to
a cleaner, who is to receive &pound;1 for the work, and at
that point they are handed over to somebody else,
who gets 10 shillings. So they keep going, the
Lord knows how long and how far. You never get
them back again, and you find it utterly impossible to discover whether anybody really did do any
work to them. Tile whole country is run on a system of fees.</q>
    <p>The assertion, though, of course, tinged with natural American exaggeration, is profoundly suggestive
of the manner of life. There are swarms upon swarms
of people who get paid for getting other people to do
their work. This, however, has nothing whatever
to do with hotel life in London, concerning which
I intended to write exclusively at this time.
    <p>At the newest houses there they have reached that

<pb n=176>

point of modern civilization at which you are not
obliged to go to bed by the light- or rather the
darkness - of a candle. The Swan and Edison incandescent electric lamps are in the rooms, and in the
course of another century or two there will doubtless
be running water and apartments laid out <foreign lang=fr>en suite</foreign>,
with baths and the other appliances to which we are
accustomed in our first-class American hotels. Even
in the First Avenue the old system of pitcher and
wash-bowl is still in progress. I believe there is a
theory among Englishmen that running water in
bedrooms is a vastly injurious thing. Funny folks,
those Britons.
   <p>Brass bedsteads are the rule, and they are generally covered by some sort of a canopy or other.
At the First Avenue the beds are laid sidewise
against the wall, and curtains of some dark material
hung over them.     The superstition is, I believe,
that they keep draughts from blowing upon one's
head and shoulders. As a matter of fact they simply make the room look profoundly and wretchedly
gloomy, and when one goes to bed he feels as though
he were laying himself out for exhibition as a particularly fine corpse. In some of the old-fashioned
hotels the beds are so high that step-ladders of three
or four steps each are required in order to climb in.
There is one thing about these beds, though: they
are exceedingly broad and exceptionally comfortable
after you get into them. The belief exists that insects are not encouraged by brass bedsteads; but I
certainly accumulated as fine a collection of healthy
and industrious bed-bugs at the First Avenue Hotel

<pb n=177>
as I have ever seen equalled, even in the cotton-wood
countries along the Arkansas river.   A bed-bug
capable of vegetating on a brass bedstead has a
digestion, gentle reader, which is not surpassed by
that of any other carnivorous beast on record.
   <p>But, if there are drawbacks to London hotel life,
there is nothing more charming and delightful on
the face of this lowly footstool than some of the
suburban hotel resorts. I went out one day with a
large party of English friends and acquaintances to
a place called Bentley Priory. It lies some ten miles
to the northward of London, on what is known as
the Edgware road. The estate used to be the property of Lord Abercorn, and Queen Adelaide died in
one of the rooms through which we passed in this
fine old building. We made the trip out to the
Priory on a four-in-hand coach, and our way lay
through some of the most beautiful of the green
lanes of England. The country is green over there,
too. The vegetation has a much deeper and richer
tint than it has with us, and the trees are more
luxuriantly covered with foliage than ours are in
America. They are mostly wide-spreading affairs,
whose branches run out almost horizontally, and
their great masses of dark leaves look peculiarly
cool and refreshing.
   <p>The roads are hemmed in on either side by tall
hedges, and most of the fields are separated in the
same way. The suburban residences are in many
cases surrounded by high brick walls, inside which
gardens are beautifully laid out. Along the road
here and there we passed a celebrated old tavern,


<pb n=178>

   with strange memories, picturesque gables, and queer
   little windows. Barmaids and rural damsels ran to
   the doors to wave their handkerchiefs at our driver,
   who was a faint reflection of the elder Weller, and
   whose mind, even after the long advance of years
   under which he lives, is still attuned to gallantry.
   The air was sweet and clear, and scented with the
   new-mown hay, and it was particularly refreshing
   after the heavy and smoky atmosphere of London.
     <p>Finally, as the horn of the guard sounded a warning note, a high gate-way to the left of the road was
  thrown back, and the coach rolled through a winding
  way underneath the branches of tall pines, which
  stand like double rows of gloomy sentinels beside
  the path. For half a mile through this forest patch
  the road wound in and out, and then broke abruptly
  into the opening where the Priory stands. It is a
  fine old structure, with grape arbors, greenhouses,
  and pretty much all the other things which make the
  elegant kind of country-life enjoyable. The lawns
  are magnificently laid out, the gardens are radiant,
  and from the front of the house, which backs on the
  roadway, a rolling field leads down to a beautifully
  wooded valley, in the centre of which there is a
  shining lake. Far off, across the hills, one may discern the tall spires of Harrow, and everywhere the
eye is filled by as beautiful a rural scene as I have
ever looked upon. The estate to which the Priory
formerly belonged contained about five hundred
acres, and it was bought from its lordly owner for
&pound;75,000. The speculation was a shrewd one, and
the man who conducted it immediately sold half the

<pb n=179>
property for &pound;80,000; so that he now possesses two
hundred and fifty acres and a rare old historic mansion, beside being &pound;5,000 to the good.
   <p>The Priory and its surroundings are controlled by
a London hotel firm, and there is no more attractive
spot in the world. Little parties start out in the
morning, either by the regular coach, which plies
between the Priory and London, or by their own
private conveyances. A dinner in the lofty rooms
of the Priory, a stroll through the wooded lanes, and
a drive back to town employ a full day about as refreshingly and enjoyably as it is possible to imagine.
Peaches, grapes, and tomatoes, all carefully cultured
in the greenhouse, are upon the table, which is the best
conducted thing of its kind I have found in Europe.
Peaches, I suppose you know, hardly ripen out of
doors in England, though they are at times grown
against a southerly wall. A peach orchard, such as
we have in the agricultural districts of America,
would be an amazing thing in England. The peachtree there is treated like a vine. It is trained up a
wall, where its branches spread out, covering an immense area, and when it is full of ripening fruit, it is
certainly a beautiful sight. At the Priory the peachvine has been led up the sashes of the glass roof, and
the fruit hangs like bunches of huge grapes. The
English peaches are delicious in flavor, and I think
they are more juicy than those we have in the United
States. But like all delicacies over there, they are
enormously costly, and only the <mentioned>"high rollers"</mentioned> can
enjoy them. Wealth is a blessed thing in England.
With it you are everything. Without it you are
33 1/2 per cent. worse than nothing at all.

 <p>THE longer you live in London the more you
         find out, and the less you like it. That, at all
 events, is the case until you have been here so long
 that you are hardened and ready for any kind of
 crime. Some few of the annoyances to which the
 trusting stranger is put he himself is to blame for.
 He has placed his trust in friends who told him it
 was cheaper to live in London than in Chicago or
 New York. He has been told that he can hire
 rooms more cheaply in England than in America.
 What is worse, he believes the tale. He has, likewise, been taken in with what has been told him
 about cheap restaurants, respectful policemen, and
 clean streets. If you go for rooms anywhere within
 hailing-distance of any place you want to find, it
 costs quite as much as in any part of the world that
 I know of. In the English hotels there is no bell-
boy. If you want anything, you have got to communicate with the chamber-maid. She is an
accommodating person, and that is one thing in her favor.
She will black your boots, give you a lot of candles,
supply you with pens and ink, sew on your buttons,
brush your clothes, and tie your scarf, all for ten
or fifteen cents. If you so much as speak to her,

<pb n=181>
she will say <q>Thank you.</q> This is the one blessed
thing in the whole of Europe. Everybody thanks
you. It is the one phrase on all people's tongues.
It matters little whether you do the people a favor
or threaten to break their necks, they thank you
just the same.
   <p>It is immoderately funny to be thanked by a policeman. The police of London are wonderful.
   Sometimes they are amusing, and sometimes, I am assured,
they do good service. The salaries of the London
police-officers range from $5.50 to $7 a week. You
would not expect men to get rich on that sort of a
salary. In New York, men occupying the same
positions get $80 or $100 a month. The London
officer, however, is allowed to accept tips. Moreover, he expects them. If he does you a service,
however small, he hopes to be paid. He will take
anything you give him; but it is not considered polite
to give an officer in London less than two pence,
which is equal in value to four cents. I can imagine
what would happen if you were to offer four cents to
an American policeman. In London the police are
not allowed to wear revolvers, and if they use their
clubs, excepting in cases of life and death, they are
likely to be sent to prison for any period up to ten
years. In some sections of London it is the favorite
amusement of the roughs to jump upon policemen
and thrash them. The law usually lets such offenders
go without much trouble. Here, it is the civilian
who has the hard time to keep out of jail; in England
it is the officer. The London policeman is civil
according to English ideas, but he is not over polite.

<pb n=182>

He does as well, perhaps, as could be expected of a
man on $5.50 a week, without the attendant privilege of clubbing people, but he is not exactly
bubbling over with a desire to serve you. That, the
severity of his costume would prevent. He wears a
helmet, the strap of which passes either just under
his nose or right in his mouth. If his hat is knocked
off his nose has got to go, too. Imagine a man trying
to be affable with a leather strap between his teeth.
Besides that, he wears white cotton gloves which
make his hands look like a couple of whitewashed
flounders, or something equally flabby and unnatural.
Did you ever see anybody look really pleasant in
white cotton gloves? I have seen people try, but
never succeed. Then the London policeman wears
shoes like life-rafts, and a short-tailed coat, belted in
around the waist and sticking out behind, like a too-
brief ruffle. Around one arm of his coat he has a
strip of cloth in blue and white stripes. In his
hand he sometimes has a rattan cane, and at his
back his club securely buttoned into a leather sheath,
so that before he could get it out, any number-one
criminal might pound him to a jelly and be off. If
you ask a London policeman anything, he simply
answers you, and that is all. Here is a conversation
I had with one of them:
   <p><q>This isn't St. Bride's street, is it?</q>
   <p><q>No.</q>
   <p><q>Is that it over there?</q>
   <p><q>No.</q>
   <p><q>What street is that?</q>
   <p><q>Blackfriars.</q>

<pb n=183>
      <p><q>Is that St. Bride's street?</q>
      <p><q>No.</q>
      <p>This was getting monotonous, so I said:-
      <p><q>Look here; where is St. Bride's street?</q>
      <p>He seemed surprised to learn that I had been really
   wanting to find St. Bride's street. When he recovered he said: -
      <p><q>Three minutes' walk; turn to the left.</q>
      <p><q>My friend,</q> I said, as calmly as I could, <q>does
  it seem to you that I look like a man who would go
  around with a stop-watch in his hand so as to know
  when to turn off to the left? Honestly, now, does
  that strike you as at all probable?</q>
     <p><q>Three minutes' walk; turn to the left.</q>
     <p>The case was hopeless. He had it by heart, like
  the Alpine maniac with his <mentioned>"Excelsior."</mentioned>
     <p>So I gave it up, and hired a boot-black to show me
 the way.  It was ten minutes' walk and on the
 right. I imagine that policeman must have been
 left-handed. Perhaps he thought I wanted to know
 what side it would be on when I came back.
    <p>The English detective is a peculiar bird.   He
 assumes an air of owl-like wisdom upon all occasions and does just about as much effective work in
 the world as would be accomplished by a well-
 regulated owl. The ease and grace with which he
 arrests the wrong man and shadows the entire innocent population have gained him a world-wide
 reputation.
   <p>A day or two previous to the wedding of Prince
Leopold I went over to Scotland Yard on some
business. My visit was on Monday, and even that

<pb n=184>

establishment was given over, body and mind, to the
royal wedding. Hardly anybody was to be found
about the place. All hands were away perfecting the
police arrangements for the nuptial day. So, instead
of transacting my business I had an opportunity to
take a look at Scotland Yard.
   <p>There isn't much <mentioned>"yard"</mentioned> to it. Somehow I had
an idea that the place was a big enclosure surrounded
by a high brick wall, and here and there a building
for the different officials. But in England a yard is
not a yard, apparently. This one is not, at any rate.
You turn off from the main street into a covered
alley way. Emerging from beneath the cover you
find yourself in an alley way that is not covered. On
each side are buildings, a couple of stories high, of
brown bricks. Over one of the entrances a blue
glass lamp says there is a police-station within. But
for all there is about the place to indicate its character you might be standing in a back street in
Boston. From the main alley narrower ones run off
in different directions. All the door-ways are made
of grained wood, and the most of them are marked
<mentioned>"Private."</mentioned> All over the place, indeed, there is an
air of ostentatious privacy that is, no doubt, intended
to be very impressive.   In reality it is intensely
amusing.      The detective department is the most
comic of all.
    <p>From the moment you enter the door everybody
 regards you with a close scrutiny which is meant to
 convey the inference that he is a policeman in plain
 clothes who is habituated to <mentioned>"taking in"</mentioned> every person
 he sees. I can imagine the awe this would inspire in

<pb n=185>
 the mind of a countryman full of wild notions about
 the superiority of detectives over ordinary human
beings. But these chaps are not the real detectives.
They are a lot of clerks who like to make you think
they are gifted above the balance of their race. If
an inexperienced person had a complaint to make in
this place he would have it scared out of him in ten
seconds by the watch. My experience was amusing that Monday.   I approached the chief of the
detective department, and sent in a letter of introduction.
   <p>Pretty soon I heard a high, ill-natured voice
inquire: -
   <p><q>What the devil does he want?</q>
   <p><q>Wants to see you,</q> responded the clerk who had
taken my letter.
   <p><q>Humph!  Well, I'll see him.  Tell him to
wait.</q>
   <p>The clerk came out and put me in a little room,
eying me very closely, as if speculating on the likelihood of my carrying away the floor and desks.
Pretty soon the man with the ill-tempered voice
went out. That was the chief of the detectives. I
waited a mortal hour. Then he came back, nodded
to me, and said: -
    <p><q>Come in.</q>
    <p>I went in. He sat down by a desk, picked up my
 still unopened letter of introduction, and said
 brusquely: -
    <p><q>Well, what do you want?</q>
    <p>Then he read the letter and said: <q>Who the devil
 is the man who writes me this letter?</q>

THE DARK CITY.

    <p>I replied that he would find the gentleman's name
 at the bottom of the note, probably. He said:-
    <p><q>Humph!  Well, if this is the Mr. Blank I think
 it is, I know no good of him.</q>
    <p>I observed that I didn't come there to hear about
 the writer of that letter, but about somebody else.
 He said he wouldn't give me any information. That
 was not what the Metropolitan Police was for. He
 declined to tell me what the Metropolitan Police <emph>was</emph>
 for. Then he went back to the writer of my introductory letter. I asked him if <emph>that</emph> was what the
 M.P. was for.
    <p>After that he took my name and address, and the
 names of all the newspapers I had any connection
 with, and as many more particulars as he could think
 of. Then he became suddenly affable, and told me
 he would ask permission to give the information I
 wanted.   If I had never seen detectives before I
 should have been scared to death long before this.
 But when this one's crust came off he turned out to
 be a clever kind of a fellow, and not so all-fired smart
 that he avoided telling me, inadvertently, how I could
 get my information in spite of the Metropolitan
 Police. He was an inspector, too. Inspectors of
 British police are great guns, - in Charles Dickens'
 novels.
   <p>It is a curious thing that, in a city so big as London is, the fire department should be actually worse
than it is in an American town of forty or fifty
thousand inhabitants. I believe Captain Shaw, the
chief of the department, visited America some years
ago for the purpose of going through our system there,

<pb n=187>

and taking notes upon it. None of our arrangements have thus far been taken advantage of; and
if they had been I should have a different story
to tell about the memorable fire in the Alhambra
theatre and the great downtown warehouse which
was burned a few days afterwards. Everybody in
the United States knows our American system of
fire-alarms, and how, within from two to twenty
seconds after the first bell sounds, our equipped and
manned engines, with steam already getting up, are
upon the street. In London the fire department has
no electric appliances like ours, and the horses are
not even trained.   Messengers or common telegraphic summonses are sent to the fire-house
whenever their services are in demand.
   <p>When the flames broke out in the Alhambra theatre, and the night-watchman found they could not
be controlled by the methods at hand, a boy was sent
round to the Chandos-street station, four or five hundred yards away, and the newspapers, in describing
what occurred, spoke with a sort of awe of the great
feat which Engineer Aslin accomplished. <q>In no
less than three minutes!</q> exclaimed the <title>Daily
News</title>, in a burst of great enthusiasm, <q>he was on
his way to the scene, only a few yards distant, with
a manual.</q> I don't know what a manual is; but if it
took three minutes to get the concern under way it
must have taken the balance of the fire department a
good while longer. At the same Chandos-street
station I once saw them hitching up to go to a fire.
One man came out of a door a little way down the
street, leading a horse that didn't want to come, and



<pb n=188>

he was soon followed by another man leading a horse
still more reluctant as to the duty in hand. At the
same time the balance of the fire-brigade were employed in hauling out a vehicle on which they were
to ride. Then began a confused and not particularly
effective series of manoeuvres, such as you see in a
country barn-yard when a couple of green horses are
being hooked up to a wagon. It took them eleven
minutes by the watch to get away from the door of
their engine-house. The fire-brigade of London is
effective when it once gets to work, but it is infernally slow at the beginning. By the time Engineer
Aslin and his manual got to the Alhambra it was a
hopeless case.
   <p>The papers, in describing how he entered the
building, conveying the hose with him, and remained
some time in the auditorium playing against the
burning walls, went on to say, after alluding to all
these matters, that the engines, with steam up and
well manned <q>soon appeared from the various fire-
brigade stations.</q> In America they would have been
there first. By the time they did begin their active
operations the great theatre was a seething, boiling
mass of flames shooting up to heaven like a burst
of Hades through a great funnel a hundred feet high.
The Alhambra was totally destroyed, and the losses
were simply immense. The costumes alone that
were stored in the building represented a loss of
$50,000. The building, which is said to have cost
originally &pound;100,000, was insured for &pound;30,000; but
there could have been little loss in this direction to
the stock company who owned it, for they got it

<pb n=189>
second-hand from the original builders who burst up.
The acting company employed in the theatre consisted of about six hundred people, as the house was
run entirely on the spectacular plan, - such pieces as
the <name>"Black Crook"</name> and <name>"Babil and Bijou,"</name> furnishing the sort of entertainment given there. It
need never have been destroyed if our American fire
arrangements could have been in force. The same
might readily be said of the great warehouse down
in the centre of London which went up the flume a
day or two later. Some day they will have a big
conflagration in London that will carry everything
before it. It took lessons like this in Chicago and
other American cities to perfect the fire-plans here.
   <p>There are things, though, about London which
deserve sincere and extensive commendation. One
of these is the cab system. I don't know how many
of these vehicles there are in the metropolis, but I
have seen them numbered as high as 10,900, and I
have no doubt that they run much higher. They are not
pretty, being built upon the plan of an old-fashioned
two-wheeled chaise, with a driver's seat perched up
behind the cover. You hop in, shut the door, and
communicate your destination to the driver through
a little trap in the roof; then away you go at a gait
that would have you in the station-house inside of
five blocks if you were in an American city. If
you ride less than two miles it costs twenty-five
cents, and the distances beyond that are proportionately cheap. Some of the cabs have mirrors, clothes-
brushes, and rugs in them for the convenience of
passengers, and you cannot walk a block anywhere



<pb n=190>
in London without seeing one of these vehicles
The drivers will overcharge you if they can; but, on
the other hand, they will take almost anything you
give them without a remonstrance. Possessing such
a scheme as this, one is rather glad to get rid of the
horse-car system of America. The cabs are owned
by various companies, which let them out to the
drivers at so much a day. The driver gets whatever
he makes above the owner's fixed fee. So he is an
independent citizen, - about as independent as they
make 'em. When he is drunk, which is not infrequently the case, he is a lively customer. The fact
is, gentle reader, that the lower class of English
society keeps a perpetual and perennial <mentioned>"still"</mentioned> on.
Sometimes it is noisy, but it is never sober.

   <p>AUTUMNAL London is pretty tough.     It is
      cold, and raw, and damp, and windy. In
London they have what they call the East wind. It
carries people off by thousands. It doesn't lift them
right off their feet and blow them away, you know.
It goes through them, and leaves the seeds of consumption and rheumatism. You can tell autumn in
London by the same signs which mark its advent
everywhere in the civilized world. The leaves are
dropping from the trees; the men are buttoned up to
  their chins; the seal-skin cloak, which smells like a
  camphor factory, has made its reappearance; and in
  the corner windows there is a mystic legend which
  he who runs may read. It is brief, but to the point.
  It says, <mentioned>"Hot Gin."</mentioned>   Yes.

            <quote><l>"The melancholy days have come,
                 <l>The saddest of the year;"
               <l>When goose-flesh permeates our backs,
                  <l>And gin replaces beer.</quote>

      <p>Fall in London is the worst thing on earth since
   the fall of man. It is muddy, and dreary, and sticky,
   and forlorn. What aggravates an already tough
   condition of affairs is the fact that the occasion is



<pb n=192>



seized by the local government as a fit and proper
time to repair all the streets. A London street undergoing repair is not a lovely spectacle,
particularly if the place to be mended lies right in front of
your house, as it generally does.
   <p>There are two sorts of pavement in use all over
London. Neither of them has yet proved an enormous success in America. The Nicholson is one,
and the other is similar to the Macadam. Both are
generally and successfully in use in London, where
the teaming is quite as heavy as it is in any part of
the world. Pavements are the source of much study
and anxiety everywhere. I wonder how often I have
heard people try to form a conjecture as to the reason
why pavements, which are successful in every way
in France and England won't do in America? The
general theory in use is to the effect that our climate
destroys the material and renders it anything but
durable. Bosh! Anything that will stand the London climate can get along with the worst
atmospheric effects we have in America. I was watching
the relaying of some wood pavement in London one
day. As a matter of fact I watched the repairing
of Macadam pavement every day. I began about
four o'clock in the morning and watched it all day.
Why? Well, it was going on in front of my study-
window, -that was all. The steam-roller began to
puff and snort and slam around before daylight, and
kept puffing and snorting and slamming around until
long after dark at night. I am moved to this explanation lest you should infer that I had taken an
abnormal and irrelevant taste for the art of paving
streets.

<pb n=193>
    <p>The whole secret of success in the building of
 pavements so they will last, over there, when the
 same sort of stuff in America won't stay, is in the
 fact that the work is better done in England than it
 is with us. Beneath every square foot of wood
 paving in London there is a layer of concrete foundation five or six feet thick. It is very much like
 the macadamized road, only that it is very deep and
 very solid. It is made of fragments of stone rolled
 down in cement and clay, and it makes a magnificent
 bed-rock for the blocks of wood to rest upon. The
 way they roll their macadam streets in London is
 instructive. Over the various layers of broken stone
 and cement they run a steam-roller which is quite as
 heavy as the biggest railway engine in America.
 This goes back and forth over the same ground for
 days together until it has mashed the material down
 so that when it comes to be dug up for fixing street-
 pipes, the only way to make any impression on it is
 with a drill and sledge-hammer, such as would be
 used in blasting a granite cliff. Making streets in
 London is unpleasant for the neighbors; but when
 the work is done it doesn't fizzle out in a few days.
 One sees macadamized roads as smooth as a billiard-
 table right in the heart of London, wholly unaffected
by the flow of heavy traffic.   But the streets are
dirtier there than they are anywhere else on the earth.
They have none of our street-sweeping machines;
and when they <mentioned>"sprinkle"</mentioned> a street they simply flood
it, so that there is nothing but a creamy quality of
mud on the surface. To call London clean, as the
natives always do, is a hideous and mocking sarcasm.

<pb n=194>

To say it is the best paved city in the world is to tell
the plain, unvarnished truth. But nobody who is
anybody stays in London in the autumn. This is
the hunting season, when Scotland and the moors
are the correct things.
   <p>The one thing in all England which most amuses
an American is, perhaps, the institution they call
sport. You hear occasionally about men who keep
their shooting-boxes in the country, and the glorious
times they have there. While I was in England I went
down to visit a gentleman at his country place. He
had been out gunning in the morning, and complained
of it as a bad day's work, because he had succeeded
in killing only sixteen brace of birds, - pheasants, I
think they were. I thought that must be a pretty
good country for gunning, where thirty-two birds
was a bad morning's sport. But when we came to
go out of doors I stumbled upon the reason of it all.
Within one hundred yards of the front door I saw
dozens of these same birds flying about. One could
walk up to within forty feet of them at any time.
They are carefully raised for the purpose of being
shot when they grow up, and it is a good deal like
shooting a bird with a string to it. This is one kind
of English sport, but not the only kind.
   <p>There is a pastime called coursing, which is very
popular with the gentlemen of England. It consists
of leading two greyhounds over a field until they scare
up a hare. Then the dogs are turned loose and they
run the hare down and kill it. It is delicious sport
to hear them crunch the poor little wretch's bones
between their fierce jaws. Sometimes the hares, running

<pb n=195>
like mad away from the ferocious beasts, looking
backward in fear, have their eyes torn out by the
briars in the hedges.
   <p>Nice, innocent, guileless amusement! Noble
sport!
   <p>Every year in England there is what they call the
royal stag-hunt. The name has a fine sound; but to
see it is to make a man's blood boil with indignation.
The place of meeting is fixed upon, the hounds are
brought there, and a great crowd of people gather to
be amused. By and by the royal stag is fetched along
in a box. He is some poor, innocent little animal,
who has been brought up in a park, and he is so tame
that he will come up and lick your hand. The yelping, savage dogs are smelling about the box and
snarling for the poor creature's blood. He has never
heard such sounds in his life, and he trembles like
a leaf. Finally, amid a great uproar, the box is
broken to pieces and the frightened thing bounds
out. The dogs are loosened and the royal stag-hunt
begins.
    <p>The deer has probably never run half a mile in his
whole life. He is as soft and easily winded as a dude.
When he succeeds in keeping out of the reach of the
fangs of the hounds for an hour and a half, the papers
allude to the chase as a tremendous event. Sometimes the animals won't start in the first place. I
have known them to stand still and look about them
at the hounds, - two-legged and four-legged, - and
never offer to stir. To see animals of this kind ruthlessly dragged down by dogs, is what the noble Briton
calls <mentioned>"sport."</mentioned> In America it would be called murder;

<pb n=196>

but in Great Britain there seems to be a tremendous
pressure of this love of inhuman cruelty.
   <p>Among the lower classes it takes the form of wife-
beating. In the upper walks of life it breaks out
when my lord takes his gun and goes out to shoot
tame pheasants, sets his hounds on timid rabbits, and
yells over the pitiable spectacle of a royal stag-hunt.
   <p>Being thus cruel by nature, the Englishman can forgive cruelty in other Englishmen. In <datestruct value="1882-12-"><month>December</month>, <year>1882,</year></datestruct>
a man named Grant was charged with the murder of
his eight-year-old boy, and it was unmistakably shown
that the killing was most brutal and infamous. The
youngster played hookey from school, and had come
home too late to start the fire upon which the supper
of his respected sire was to have been cooked. The
old man started after him, and the boy ran under the
bed, from whence he firmly declined to emerge for
the purpose of accommodating his stern parent in the
design of whaling him. The father thereupon seized
the poker from the fireplace, and proceeded to punch
out his son with that domestic instrument of persuasion, which occupies a prominent place in the
household discipline of Great Britain. Old Grant punched
to such good purpose that he succeeded in braining
the hopeful offspring, who died in awful agony some
hours after the assault. The judge and jurors before
whom the case was presented took such a sympathetic
view of the little family episode that the murderer
escaped with only a month's imprisonment.
   <p>Another gentleman, with a fine sense of domestic
harmony, about the same time, burned his wife's
throat, arms, and hands in a most horrible and revolting

<pb n=197>
way with a red-hot poker. It was proved
that he had previously been in the habit of regulating the affairs of his happy home circle through the
external application of buckets of hot water. The
magistrate, apparently not sharing the popular belief
that variety is the spice of family life, actually sent
this interesting lord and master to jail for six months.
In this country I fondly trust that both of these people
would have been lynched.
    <p>The same lenient feeling does not go through all
 of Her Majesty's courts. In Ireland a man was
 accused of killing a landlord; he was tried, and the
 jury remained out all night. Every one of them was
 drunk when the verdict of guilty was reached; yet,
 every attempt to get a new trial for the man was a
 failure. He was hanged, and the editor of the paper
 which made the facts about the jury known was sent
 to prison for daring to tell such a thing. Subsequent
 events proved that a wholly innocent man had been
 executed.

  <p>THE man who gets into a lawsuit in the city of
          London is either a very unfortunate fellow, or
 a very able idiot. Were I a Coal-oil Johnny, who
 felt the absolute necessity of throwing my money
 away as fast as possible, and actually found myself
 in search of the most rapid and certain means of
 disposing of my funds, I should take a fly at a London police-court. Law-suits are serious business in
 America; but they are the merest kind of play by
 comparison with what they are in London. I know
 a Chicago man who was overcharged by a London
 agent to the extent of $60, which he very promptly
 and very properly refused to pay. The London
 agent said he would sue. The Chicago man said
 he might sue and be <emph>etceteraed</emph>. The London agent
 sued. The Chicago man engaged a solicitor and
 defended the case. He beat the London agent out
 of sight, with costs. The judge even went so far as
 to say the London agent was a base fraud, a swindler, and pretty much everything else worth
 mentioning. The Chicago man thought he had a good
 thing, and was going off congratulating himself
 when the solicitor brought in his bill. That almost
killed him.   It was $135, more than twice the

<pb n=199>
amount of the attempted swindle. The Chicago
man inquired into it.   He found that the law
allowed his solicitor $2.50 every time his client -
called, even if the client merely picked his teeth for
thirty seconds in the anteroom and went out again.
He also found that every time the solicitor wrote a
letter to the opposite party, no matter if he only said,
<q>How d'ye do?</q> in it, the law allowed him $1.37.
He discovered that the solicitor could not take his
case into court at all; the law, out of the lot of
things it did allow him, did not allow that. Not
any. In order to be heard in court he must engage
a barrister. It at once occurred to the Chicago man
to ask himself why he had not dealt with the barrister direct instead of engaging this irrelevant
middleman.   He very soon found that the law had
provided for that also. He must engage two men
to do what one would have accomplished at half the
cost and twice as well. He shuddered to think
what might have become of him if he had lost the
case but paid the bill, and has been swindled right
and left ever since. He says he would rather give
his money to one thief than two lawyers any day.
With him it is a choice between two evils, -or,
rather three evils.
   <p>I noticed, also, the case of the Marquis of Huntly,
who pulled himself into a nice financial pickle.
Some bill-brokers loaned him money, understanding
that his property was unencumbered. He does not
seem to have told them so, but they so understood
it. And, right here, let me warn you, on visiting
London, to beware of bill-brokers, tailors, and others

<pb n=200>

who would like to be your creditors. I had a little
experience of that kind myself, only I was fortunate
enough not to get bitten.
   <p>I had a letter of introduction to the Earl of---,
and in due time presented it. Shortly after, I drifted
into the stalls of a theatre, where the Earl had a
private box, and between the acts he did me the
courtesy to invite me into that more secluded resort.
I went, of course, and had a very pleasant hour, because this particular Earl is a mighty nice fellow, and
a bright one as well. A few nights afterward I
went again to the theatre with another member of
the peerage. Imagine the sensations which percolated my very marrow, when, visiting the American
rendezvous next day, I found a dozen letters from all
kinds of tradesmen inviting me to their shops, and
extending the most unlimited inducements. I didn't
understand it at all, until I had unveiled the fact to a
British friend, who told me this anxiety to gain my
custom was based upon my experiences in the theatre.
I was supposed, from my association, to be a very
Muldoon in financial solidity.
   <p><q>But what,</q> I asked, <q>if I accept these offers,
buy unlimited quantities of things, and then don't
pay?</q>
   <p><q>Well,</q> replied my friend, <q>you'll go to jail, as
surely as you're a foot high.</q>
   <p>From which it seems that these English tradespeople crowd you into debt as deeply as they can,
and then lock you up for accommodating them.
That is what they seem to have been trying with the
Marquis of Huntly. One fellow, named Nicholson,

<pb n=201>
loaned him $10,000, and, as soon as he went out of
the country on a pleasure tour, brought criminal
proceedings against Huntly for having obtained the
money under false pretences. This, of course, only
served to stir up the others of whom he had borrowed
at different times, and presently suits were in, covering some $37,500 more. Huntly was deeply in debt,
as most Englishmen of his class are.   His visit
abroad was made with a view to having his affairs
straightened out by his friends and agents. He heard
of the proceedings while he was in Albania, where
he might have stayed if he had wished, and those
fellows could not have touched him. But he came
straight home and surrendered himself. How much
bail, do you suppose they put him under, -a man
who clearly had no idea of running away? Only
$180,000, for an alleged indebtedness of $47,500.
He found the bail, though.
    <p>And this suggests thoughts of the positive fascination a title of any kind seems to have for the average
 Britisher, from the royal family down. The papers
 are full of the doings of the nobility, and their names
 are in every one's mouth.
    <p>The Prince of Wales, you know, is one of the
 hardest-worked men in England. His work, too, is
 of the most exhausting kind.   Every day in the
 week he is busy with some public ceremony, where
 he has to make a speech and take part in a banquet,
 or something of the sort. You will hear of him in
 Edinburgh to-day, laying a corner-stone for some
 institution; in London to-morrow, acting as chairman of a big meeting for the establishment of a

<pb n=202>

college of music, or a hospital, or something of the
sort; and in Plymouth, or some still more distant
city, the next day, taking a leading part in some
public ceremony of some other kind.   He is not, as
might be expected, purely ornamental upon these occasions. He always has something to say upon the
topic in hand, and, what is more, he makes a pretty
good speech. Such a life as this, full of adulation,
which must become a bore in time, can be nothing
but wearing, and several times the prince has been
on the verge of breaking down. The physicians
advised him to put in a few weeks at Wiesbaden.
To this place he went, with the princess and their
family of children. They travel as the Baron and
Baroness Renfrew and family. I have never quite
understood why royalty should adopt this incognito
business when travelling. I suppose there is some
reason for it; but if you or I were to proceed upon
such a course, folks would say we were travelling
under an alias. How strange such difference should
be 'twixt royaltee and you and me!
   <p>One of the papers announced that the prince was
to <mentioned>"go through"</mentioned> the waters of Homburg, -which
would certainly have reversed the usual course of
events in that quarter. But of all the announcements of the departure of the prince and his
prospective performances the <title>Times'</title> notice was the funniest.
The writer of this brilliant article began by saying,
His Royal Highness was to <q>drink the waters of a
German bath,</q> and continued with the following
simple and easily understood statement: <q>If he is
directed to temper his vacation with a course of

<pb n=203>
mineral waters, he may be sure that his system is
condemned to imbibe no more salts and carbonates
and alkalies than will constitute the minimum qualification for a moderate respite from the tyranny of
social observance.</q>   Whew! If that isn't a daisy
of a sentence I never saw one. It reads like a clause
of the River and Harbor bill. The difference is that
in this paragraph there is nothing about an appropriation.
   <p>Have you heard of the new scheme afoot among
the belles of Great Britain? No! - Then let me tell
you that the art of <mentioned>"making up"</mentioned> has now achieved
its topmost height in the society of London, and that
all other nations may as well take a back seat right
off. No longer do the rouge-pot and the bottle of
liquid-white confine their tender offices to the cheeks
and necks of the boss belles of Europe. A lady who
has been properly decorated for a fine European ball
or reception is nowadays a work of art. The latest
wrinkle is the tracing of delicate blue veins upon the
arms, necks, and - ahem!-the chests of the gentle
creatures who ornament London society.
   <p>There is an artist in the great metropolis who
makes a sumptuous living by following this branch
of industry. It isn't a masculine artist. Oh, dear,
no! It is a staid and middle-aged female, who failed
as a painter of sheep and fences, clothes-lines and
things, and unto whose ingenious brain appealed this
notion. She begins to fresco her subject by putting
on a layer of delicate flesh-color, and upon this she
outlines her net-work of light-blue veins. This is a
curious country, particularly in regard to its women.

<pb n=204>

  As Mr. Labouchere touchingly queries, - upon hearing that, out of ten people brought up during one
  day at the Marylebone police-court, nine were women,
  arrested for being drunk and disorderly,-<q>What
  other country can equal this?</q>
     <p>There is a river in London called the Thames.
  You may have heard of it.   I had heard of it, anyway, long, long before I went over. I thought it
  was a noble stream about half a mile wide, and clear
as crystal. I knew that people fished in it, and I had
  heard that they sometimes actually caught trout in its
  limpid and gurgling waters. I had heard Englishmen rave about the Thames, and I had a general
  kind of an idea that it was one of the world's mightiest
  torrents. I am moved to the recollection by some
  experiments which were going on while I was in
  London in connection with this curious stream. It
  is only a narrow river in reality, and it is anything
  but deep. A good deal of the city's sewage is
  emptied into it, and there is nothing particularly invigorating about the breezes that sweep across its
  current.
     <p>There was some conversation in sanitary circles
  about this sewage business.   Somebody started the
  theory that the stuff just stayed in the river and
  didn't get out to sea at all. He was scoffed and
  jeered at. But he hung to the idea like grim death.
  Perhaps it was the first one he had grappled with in
  a long while, and he didn't like to let it escape. In
  any case he finally induced a good many people to
  look into the matter, and the experiments began.
  These were simple enough.   The authorities procured

<pb n=205>
some floats and put them into the stream at
various points. Then they placed a double set of
men with boats to just keep their eyes on those
floats night and day. These objects were allowed
to go whither they listed. They did not list to any
great extent. The most energetic one of the lot, I
believe, travelled some three miles toward the ocean
in four weeks. Since these experiments have been
finished, the local authorities have been trying to
compute the length of time it would take a bucket
of sewage to travel ten miles at the same gait. I
think they are about ready to give it up. But if they
had lived with me all summer there would have been
no cause for resorting to the float business. I had a
little place on the bank of the river, and at least
twice a day I saw a procession of dead cats and dogs
wafted gently by my landing-stage, upon the placid
bosom of that crystal stream. They came up with
the tide, and they went down with the tide. If they
had been embalmed they would probably be coming
up and going down with the tide even now. But
the wear and tear was too great for them, as it was
for me. I don't know what became of the cats and
dogs, but I left. The fact of the matter is that the
  Thames is about the same size as the roaring torrent
  that separates the south from the west side of Chicago. What is more, it is beginning to smell a good
  deal as that stream did in the good old days before
  the employment of modern dredging machines upon
  it.
     <p>On the bosom of the Thames, as I have before
  observed in this little volume, there also float up

<pb n=206>

and down hundreds of great canal-boats. Do you
think they are propelled by tugs? Oh, dear, no! Do
you imagine they sail?   Not a bit of it!   They
simply go with the tide. If they are going up and
the tide stops running in their direction, they simply
come to anchor and wait till the tide rolls by. They
go along bows first, stern first, or broadside on,-it
makes not the slightest difference. I saw one of these
boats get wedged lengthwise across a span of one of
the bridges one day, and for three mortal hours it
stopped the whole commerce of the river.
   <p>Still, on the water, England is the foremost nation
of the earth. They are great on the water, but the
water is not very great on them. At least, I so conclude from the fact that in an English residence more
than five years old a bath-tub is a greater rarity than
a banana-tree. The Englishman's idea of a bath is
to stand in an ordinary round tin tub about eight
inches deep, and anoint himself with a wet sponge.
He doesn't call it taking a bath. He says, <q>I tubbed
this morning.</q> Wherever he goes he takes the tub
with him. There is nothing funnier than to see a
man riding in a cab on his way to the railroad station
with a hat-box and a big tin tub on the roof. The
only articles he appears to need in order to be perfectly happy are a plug hat and a tin tub. If he had
any ingenuity to speak of, he would have his hat made
of tin and tub himself in that.
   <p>In England the soldier is everywhere. You
cannot walk two blocks without meeting a greater
or less portion of Her Majesty's army in red
coats and helmets. They are not impressive-looking

<pb n=207>
troops, because they are undersized as a general thing, and their countenances are
forbidding. They are recruited mainly from the scum of
society, and are officered by blue-blooded young men
who spend their nights in carousing and their days
in getting sober enough to detect the sensation of
getting drunk again. The private soldiers imitate
the habits of their officers in a small and humble way.
They have not much money of their own to spend,
but they find a way of getting it. The servant-girls
of Great Britain are fatally fascinated by the red coats
of the soldiers. To fill the soul of an English housemaid with untold joy a soldier has only to smile upon
her. She will buy him liquor and take him to theatres
as long as her money lasts, and then he will give her
a black eye, throw her down some basement stairs,
and go away to find another girl with savings. They
say these fellows make good fighters, and it is certainly
a pity they are not kept fighting all the time. They
are not nice persons, these soldiers of Her Majesty's
army, and I should dread to live in a country ruled
by them, like Egypt, or even like Ireland.

</LIST>

  <p>I have put in a good deal of time, first and last,
       on the question of Ireland. I began by observing the movements of that brave little band of men
who watch over the interests of their nation in Parliament. I talked with them and questioned them.
Many of their claims seem unjust. I went over to the
other side and talked with the statesmen who were
ladling out rewards and punishments for Ireland.
They spoke with freedom, -a little too much of it,
perhaps. It struck me that they didn't seem to be
quite sure of what they were about. A part of them
were pulling one way and the rest were going the
other as hard as they could. It was a house divided
against itself, - and I don't believe we will have to
wait a great while for that house to fall. Certain
members of the Cabinet were in favor of giving Ireland pretty much everything she might want short
of absolute separation. The other members were
actuated by a strong desire to put the whole Irish
nation in jail, and they seemed to have the scheme
in fair working order. Every prison on Irish soil
was full, and if there is a particular vegetable that
grows luxuriantly on Irish soil it is the prison.
What were these men in jail for? Some of them for

<pb n=209>
telling the people who were the bone and sinew of
the country that they had certain privileges which
are given at birth to every human being; some for
insisting on their right to hold public meetings;
some for helping the poor and the oppressed, or
showing them how to help themselves; some for
nothing in particular beyond the fact that it was inconvenient for the government to have them at large.
On the English side of the question, then, there was
certainly an injustice. On the Irish side there was
none the less certainly a wrong.
   <p>The friends of the government presented only one
argument. They said: <q>The tenant farmers have
certain rents to pay, and the landlords have a right
to exact the payment of those rents. If the tenants
are not satisfied let them go elsewhere. On one
thing we are determined, the law of the land shall
be maintained.</q> It does not necessarily follow that
the law of the land is a good law. They are determined not only that it shall be obeyed to the letter,
but that it shall not be repealed until the landlords
are good and ready. Let me tell you about some of
these things. It will not be supposed that I am talking
the words of a fanatic; for, when I went to England I
am free to say I hated the Irish most cordially. I
was more bitter against them than the English were.
If you follow me you will learn one or two of the
things that tore the scales from my eyes and showed
me one of the worst systems of wrong government
the world has seen since the earliest days of barbarism.
   <p>About six years ago there lived and flourished in

<pb n=210>

Ireland this institution called landlordism. Before
that time it had prospered and grown fat. It provided for the luxurious existence of one class at the
expense of another. It provided a race of masters
and a race of slaves. It was a worse condition, a
thousand times, than that which swept this country
twenty years ago with a tidal wave of the blood of its
best manhood. The rank injustices, the calm atrocities, the supreme infamies of the landlord system
would hardly be understood in America. I scarcely
think they would be believed.
   <p>A year or two ago there was elected to the British
Parliament a gentleman called Colonel King Harman.
He is still one of the representative landlords of Ireland. He is a smug-faced little fellow and he wears
an air of self-satisfaction that is beautiful to behold.
Well, it is not so long ago that Colonel King Harman
was in the full possession of his inherited right as a
landlord. There was then a clause in every lease upon
his estates providing that when any man or woman
living thereon desired to commit matrimony, the permission of Colonel King Harman or his agent must
humbly be asked. In other words, this pretty specimen of British landlordism proposed to control not
merely the physical movements of his tenants, but
the beatings of their hearts as well.
   <p>This was one phase of Irish landlordism in the full
flush of its arrogant maturity. Let me give you
another. There lived, some years before this time,
an old man with a great estate and a noble title,- a
man in whose shrivelling veins coursed feebly up and
down the blue blood of centuries. He had many

<pb n=211>
tenants. They were ground down to the very dust
before him. If they committed the indiscretion of improving their farms this year, they had to pay more rent
next season. No mater how they might struggle to
lift themselves from their wretched surroundings they
were flung back again with heartlessviolence. If they
were to meet their landlord in the road they must
stand to one side, bareheaded, sweeping the dust from
their feet with their hats, and almost grovelling as he
passed. When the rent was due they must be at the
office and wait, if necessary, for half a day in the rain
to suit the convenience of the agent. If one of them
dared to rear a daughter fairer than those about her,
the crime was so black that he must hide her like a
thing of guilt from the Appian eye of Leitrim. There
came a day when the hound that had grovelled so long
at the feet of this cruel master became infused with
the spirit of independence and freedom. Lord
Leitrim committed one infamy too many, and he was
gathered to his fathers. I think the gathering was
done with a horse-pistol. Anyway, Leitrim is dead,
where he ought to have been before the cruelty in
his heart had shackled one Irish peasant; before the
lust in his rotten soul had polluted one Irish maid.
   <p>At this time, too, there were laws in Ireland which
enabled any landlord to evict his tenants with or without cause. If a man had spent all his days in the
wretched hovel he called home, and the place had
been occupied by his ancestors for generation before
generation, he had no more claim on it than if he
were a total stranger. No matter if he obeyed everyone of the laws laid down by the lord of the land; no

<pb n=212>

matter it he paid his rent to the instant; no matter if
he were a most exemplary man in every way, it lay
in the power of the master to pitch him and his family
into the middle of the road whenever the freak happened to strike him. Many a pathetic case on record
can bear witness to this shameful wrong. All over
Ireland you heard the same story of rent paid on
improvements,- of men who had hired wild bog-land
years ago for a mere trifle, had built upon it and reclaimed it, and made it productive, and now had to
pay an atrocious price, very often more than the
land itself could by any possibility produce.
   <p>Here, then, we had a people ground down to
the earth, made, by the deprivation of themselves
and their families, to keep in luxury the pampered
class above them, seeing nothing ahead but a sombre
and still darkening sky. Hopeless indeed the prospect; black indeed the outlook. Yet, there was a
remedy, or, at least, the beginning of a remedy. In
the darkest hour there was one little ray of light. In
an English prison there lay a man whose limbs were
shackled, but in whose mind there floated here and
there one grand and never-dying idea.   Shivering
with cold on his narrow plank bed at night; chained
like a beast of burden to a cart by day; pounding
stone in the snows of winter; breaking putrid bones
in a close and filthy shed under the boiling rays of
the summer sun; turning with his single arm the
clumsy windlass of a heavy wringing-machine in a
room white with steam; sitting crouched for months
upon the bucket in his cell, picking oakum; devouring with the heedless rapacity of a starving wolf the

<pb n=213>
scanty and sickening food served out to him; handcuffed to loathsome and disease-ridden convicts,
humiliated, hated, cruelly wronged, shortened in
stature, wasted in flesh, sleeping and waking, through
long and weary years, from its birth to its maturity
a terrible scheme of liberty for his people and revenge for himself, had revolved in the brain of this
suffering and degraded man. For it was in this
wise and amid these surroundings that the Land-
League came into being in the master mind of
Michael Davitt.
    <p>The Land League has done its work, and done it
 well. It has forced the British government to make
 the Irish people a present of two years' rent. It has
 driven the agents of that government itself to admit
 that rents in Ireland were preposterous and inexcusable; for, in almost every case, the government
 valuations place the just rent very far below the prices
 collected for generations by the owners of the soil.
 It has given us for several years the wondrous spectacle of the boasted Parliament of the world,
 producing practically nothing beyond legislation for or
 against Ireland. It has given to the astonished eyes
 of the people of the earth a little band of not more
 than thirty men who have performed a matchless
 task, who have fought upon their own ground, and
 with weapons of their own choice, a body of twenty
 times their numerical strength, and they have literally whipped them into recognition and concessions.
 After this, who shall say that the cause of Irish liberty is hopeless?
     <p>The concessions already made have practically


<pb n=214>

eradicated crime in Ireland. There have been no
murders of late, and there probably will be none
unless the laws again become too oppressive to be
borne by the human race, no matter what its condition of servitude may be. The freedom from crime
in Ireland is at all times wonderful. Whoever is
killed there, for whatever cause, is said to be a victim of agrarian outrages. The English papers are
always filled with this old story, and the editors do
not see that they are paying a noble tribute to the
Irish race. A country where murder is never committed, except in defence of the sacred rights of
home, is a country where it is an easy thing to make
peace.
   <p>But the hatred between the Irish and the English
is very sincere on both sides. The English appear
to hate the Irish because they will not be subjugated.
The Irish hate the English for a better reason, the
same reason which fills the heart of the slave with
thoughts of vengeance when his flesh is cut to ribbons by the lash of the overseer.   A prominent
Irish leader once said to me: <q>Every Englishman
who accepts office in Ireland commits a great crime.
He is an alien, and he is ruling where he has no right
to rule. He is a criminal, and he deserves death, no
matter how or by whose hands.</q> There is no doubt
that the feeling is very 'widespread everywhere
among the Irish. They know that they have suffered
generations of infamous wrong, and that the taking
off of an oppressive landlord or an overstern official
is an act of what Davitt calls <q>the wild justice of
revenge.</q>

<pb n=215>

   <p>In the company of a well-known Irish gentleman,
I drove out from Dublin to see the spot where Lord
Frederick Cavendish was murdered and Mr. Burke
removed. As the car rolled away with us from the
scene I said to the driver, <q>What do you think of
the murders?</q> <q>Sure, sor,</q> he replied, <q>that was
a bad day for Ireland.</q> Then, after a little silence,
he proceeded in an undertone, as if talking to himself, <q>But it was a damned clane job.</q>
<p>It was.

 </LIST>

 <p>THE murders in Phoenix Park reacted upon
           Ireland in the shape of what is known as the
 Crimes Act. It was passed in the heat of vengeance,
 and born of infuriation and hatred. It enabled the
 officers of the crown, with or without a warrant, to
 enter the house of any man they might choose to
 suspect, at any hour of the night, to arouse all its
 inmates, including his wife and his innocent children,
 from their beds, to search every nook and corner of
 the place, and, if need be, to arrest men and women
 upon such proof as might be satisfactory to themselves. It enabled any magistrate to sign a warrant
 for the summary taking up of any person he might
 select, for almost any cause he might name. It gave
 the power of absolute conviction upon what might
 be a totally false construction of any sentence uttered
 or written by any man known to be a friend of the
 Nationalist cause. It made a common policeman in
 Ireland powerful enough to arrest and convey to the
 common jail any person found out of his house after
 dark, any man discovered more than twelve miles
 from his home at any hour of the day or night.
Under its provisions the worst I could wish an enemy
of mine would be that he might fall under the disapprobation

<pb n=217>
of any local magistrate, or the hatred of
any malicious constable.
   <p>Under this Crimes Act people were sent to prison
on all kinds of trivial charges. Davitt and Healy
were sentenced to six months' confinement for daring
to criticise the course of the government even in mild
terms. Timothy Harrington, the League's secretary,
was sentenced to hard labor for asking the tenant
farmers to help the starving laborers, and saying that
if they failed to do so the agitation which had been
used to help them would be turned against them.
The charge on which he was sentenced was the intimidation of tenant farmers. While he was in prison
the farmers showed how much they had been intimidated by electing him without a dissenting vote to
represent them in Parliament.
    <p>Since then he has achieved a fine revenge.
    <p>In the lonely mountains of Mamtrasna there was,
 one night, a dreadful murder. A party of men with
 blackened faces broke into the hut of the Joyce
 family and slew with bludgeons all but the two
 children.   One of these was nearly killed, and the
 other was almost frightened to death. As is always
 the cry in Ireland this murderous assault was laid
 at the door of the land agitation. As a matter of
 fact the killing was done very much as it is done in
 this country by lynching parties. The government
 quickly arrested a number of people accused of committing the crime. Some of them were as innocent
 of the assassinations as I am. One in particular, a
 fine fellow named Myles Joyce, proved an alibi.
 Two of the men who went upon the gallows with

<pb n=218>

him had previously admitted their own guilt and
positively sworn that Joyce had no part whatever in
the crime. This was two days before the hanging,
and they stuck to their statement to the very last.
    <p>In any country but Ireland there would have been
 at least a respite until the guilt or innocence of the
 accused could be proved. But the English rule of
 Ireland provides for hanging first and investigating
 afterward, or not at all. Joyce was swung off with
 the rest, murdered with the direct connivance of
 Lord Spencer and the government officials, who
 knew as well as Joyce himself that he was absolutely
 guiltless. As bad luck would have it, Marwood,
 the English executioner, was drunk that morning,
 and he bungled the hanging of the one innocent
 man in the party, so that, in addition to being
executed for a crime he knew nothing of, he was
subjected to the most horrible and inhuman cruelty.
Now, there is absolute proof in existence that the
  entire conviction was the result of a conspiracy on
  the part of the government officials. Among the
  men arrested they picked out the most timid and
  ignorant, and said to them, <q>You must swear to the
  guilt of these men. If you do not, we have evidence
  which is ample to hang you upon. If you do, you
  are saved.</q> Terrified and trembling the men did as
  they were bid. Two of the prisoners, who are now
  in confinement for life for the same crime, swear
  they were thus intimidated by the crown officials,
  who refused to produce in court the surviving members of the murdered family, pretending that they
  were too young to know the nature of an oath. In

<pb n=219>
     reality the eldest was fourteen years old. The actual
  reason they were not produced was that they refused
    to swear to the identity of the prisoners, and their
    testimony would have proved the innocence of some
    of the men who had been settled upon in advance as
    the ones to be hanged, innocent or guilty. It has
    been Mr. Harrington's pleasant duty to gather
    absolute proofs of the truth of this story. His
    evidence is so direct and so unanswerable that the
    government is afraid to allow an investigation lest
    the deep guilt of Lord Spencer and the other honorable officers in Ireland be made known to the
    world. In Parliament assembled, the English refused
    to allow such investigation to be held. They are
  guilty, and they know it. Are we to wonder that a
  nation under this sort of government is sometimes
  stung to commit crimes in retaliation?
  <p>I have not told one-fiftieth the story of wrong and
  outrage under which the Irish nation quivers in
  agony. I could not tell it all in a book of twice this
  size; but I can tell you one or two of the things I
saw in that wretched land. The statement is absolutely true that more than one-half the population of
Ireland do not taste meat once a year. Every household raises a pig; but it is not dared to consume the
animal for food. He must be sold to pay the rent of
the wretched hut and barren land on which the
family live. In many cases even the potatoes which
are raised must be sold likewise to pay the rent. I
peak of what I have seen, not what I have heard.
<p>For I have been among these down-trodden people,
town by town, house by house, and I have looked



<pb n=220>

upon scenes of squalor and wretchedness which have
made me shudder for Ireland's present, and almost
despair for her future. I have seen with my own
eyes men, women, and children worn to the bone
with abject starvation, exposed to the chilling blasts
of winter, for want of rags to cover their shrunken
forms, trembling and panting from the effects of
famine and want. In a career which has not been
entirely free from the vicissitudes and the bitter experiences of life I have not been through scenes
which, summed up in one grand total, are so fraught
with misery and suffering as the few short days I
spent among the hungry and hopeless inhabitants of
Western Ireland.
    <p>In hovels, such as any farmer in America
 would be ashamed to house his pigs in, I saw
 whole families   huddled   together in     hopeless
 squalor. There were no floors beneath them, save
 as we may call the beaten ground a floor; no roofs
 above them, unless we may dignify a wretched patchwork of leaky straw with the name of roof; no
 warmth for their shivering bodies save the scanty
 heat from a little heap of burning turf which filled
 the air with its black and suffocating smoke; no food
 to satisfy the yearnings of their pitiful hunger, save
 a bunch of seaweed or a bit of coarse Indian meal.
 Not once, nor even a hundred times, has this vision
 come upon my horrified view, for in one parish
 alone there were three thousand starved and suffering
 people.
     <p>In Killybegs I saw a case which I regard as one of
  the most heart-rending instances of destitution on

<pb n=221>
  record. A widowed father and his two young children occupied a miserable hut, through the roof of
  which I could see the dark and gloomy sky, and on the
  floor of which the rain had gathered in muddy pools.
  One child was holding her blue and bony hands over
  the last dying embers in the corner. The other was
  crouched in a heap of straw hard by. The man, in
  whose dull eyes I could read the first faint glimmer
  of the light of death, was lying upon a tattered pallet
  of straw, covered by a heap of filthy rags. Both
  children were deaf, and both were absolutely naked,
  though the air was penetrating and cold. Their
  faces betrayed only the slightest signs of intelligence,
  and my companion assured me they were rapidly
  becoming idiots. All this was the result of slow
  and protracted starvation, - the father a wasted consumptive, the children imbecile and emaciated.
    <p>What sight, what horror can tug harder at human
heartstrings?   What experience can fill the just
man's mind with greater indignation?
   <p>I cannot comprehend how any man might calmly
look upon the heart-rending scenes of Ireland,-
babes starving in their mothers' arms; strong men
in tears for their children's hunger; women shattered
in health and worn to pale shadows; boys and girls
clothed in rags and sleeping almost upon bare ground,
-I cannot comprehend the kind of human nature
which looks unmoved upon these things. But I was
told by Father Gallagher, of Glencolumbkille, that
Mr. George Otto Trevelyan, then Secretary for Ireland, after going personally over the scenes of
desolation in that parish, not only refused to promise

<pb n=222>

government relief, but that his party of six left less
than ten shillings among the suffering people.
   <p>When I was in Ireland the whole western coast
was covered over by this famine, occasioned by a
single season's failure of the crops. Hunger was in
every face I met. Suffering was everywhere. There
was not a wooden floor in one of the huts I entered,
- not a stove, not even a chimney. A hole in the
roof let out some of the smoke and let in all the rain.
A pony, sometimes a cow, and almost always a pig
occupied the one room in which the family barely
existed. Yet these poor beings are the most orderly
people on the face of the globe. They would not
harm a fly. But such are the vagaries of English
law that in every village there are military barracks
occupied by soldiers who go about the country with
loaded rifles on their shoulders to give the starving
tenantry a fitting idea of the power and strength of
the noble government under which they are graciously
allowed to breathe - and starve. If a stranger appears these officers come up and pry into his
business. They followed me all over Ireland, taking me
apparently for some hideous conspirator.   Several
times they asked me point blank what I meant by
going about and visiting these people. I will not tell
you where I requested them to go and find out,
because it would not be polite. But one cold, raw
morning, in the town of Donegal, I gave those gentlemen a lively dance. I told a shopkeeper I was going
up to a certain remote place to hold a Land League
meeting and organize an Invincible Club. Then I
drove out about five miles, turned off into a sheltered

<pb n=223>

  lane and waited. In about twenty minutes a jaunting-car with five armed policemen dashed by on the
  full run. I don't believe they have found my Land
  League meeting yet; but theyprobably enjoyed their
  forty-mile ride in the rain.

     <p>This volume is not intended as a channel for the
  discussion of the Irish problem, which is brought into
  it merely to illustrate that phase of British oppression
  which has distinguished brutal England wherever her
  banners are upraised. Having driven Egypt to bankruptcy, murdered the Zulu king, and been whipped
  by the Boers, having bullied and browbeaten every
  weak nation coming within her range, and hounded
  Ireland until the whole world cried out in indignant
  reproach, she now grudgingly approaches Home
  Rule.
    <p>England must do other things. She must abolish
 the law of entail and allow the lands to be properly
 distributed. She must learn something of justice in
 government. She must be taught that bullying is
 not bravery, that braggadocia is not honor, that the
 destruction of weak nations is not an indication of
 worth, and that there is something in life above and
beyond the theory that <q>"Might is Right."</q>
