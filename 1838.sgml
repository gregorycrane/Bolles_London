<head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
<p>THE arrival of the British Steam packet
ships, of which the Sirius has the honor
of being the pioneer, at the port of New
York, forms a new era in the navigatory
relations of our country and England. This
is the first time that that mighty power,
which before long will unite the four corners of the globe, has been applied to pack
et ships for the purpose of conveying passengers across the billows of the broad
Atlantic. Of the vast importance of Steam,
whose powers, in regard to the uses to which
they will yet be applied, are but in their
infancy, it would be superfluous to speak.
Yet it is curious and interesting, in reviewing the mighty revolutions that steam has
already caused, to look forward into the
<pb id="p.8" n="8">
womb of time, and conjecture what it may,
what it must, ultimately achieve.
</p><p>Formerly a journey of a few miles was
considered a great feat; a few hundred miles
an event in a man's life. One of such serious moment, that he felt, more especially
if he were a Benedick, the necessity of making his will, and taking a tender leave of
his family in what might be a last farewell.
Now a few hundred miles is thought nothing of; and we scarcely miss a friend
from our side, who has taken a trip over the
vast extent of country to the Queen city of
the South, before he is again with us, having performed his journey, executed his
business, and taken his pleasure. The time
is fast approaching when nations, strangers
to us but from repute, will become familiar
by intimate acquaintance; and we shall be
enabled to take a pleasure trip from New
York to the Old World-glide through
Europe and Asia-ship again for the western coast of <placeName>Columbia</>, and be placed comfortably at our residences in this great metropolis; and all by Steam.
<pb id="p.9" n="9">
</p><p>Now we are a travelling people, and have
approached more nearly, certainly, than any
other nation, in our untiring zeal and enterprise, to that important discovery, the perpetual motion.
</p><p>We shall avail ourselves, as a matter of
course, of the facilities afforded us, and take
trips to the old country to an extent that we
should not otherwise have contemplated.
In travelling, it is important to know, previously to commencing a journey, where to
rest for refreshments, and where accommodations may be obtained, in order to enjoy
ourselves fully. Otherwise half our time,
that might else be devoted to pleasure, is
consumed in the tedious, and oftentimes
unprofitable pursuit.
</p><p>It is for this reason that a few words are
addressed to Americans visiting the British
metropolis. In enabling individuals to economize their time and spend it profitably,
this guide cannot but prove advantageous;
while even to those who may not be tempted to visit the home of their fathers, it is
thought that the minutiae of London characteristics
<pb id="p.10" n="10">
 will prove interesting; the more
especially as no such full detail has hitherto
been laid before an American public.
</p><p>This Guide will be divided into three
parts. The first being intended particularly for those who visit London on pleasure.
The second for those who may be called
there on business, and to whom the method
of living with comfort and economy may
be a desirable item of information. The
third giving a notice of the most important
buildings in the Great Metropolis, arranged
and classified. The whole combined, will
give to some extent an account of modern
Life in London.
</p><p>Reader, you have the prologue. Turn
over leaf, and you will have the play.</p></div1>
<pb id="p.11" n="11">
<div1 type="part">
<head>PART I. ADDRESSED TO THOSE WHO VISIT LONDON ON
PLEASURE.</head>
<pb id="p.13" n="13">
<div2 type="chapter" id="c.1">
<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head><emph>Steam Ships - Packets - The advantages of each.</emph></head>
<p>The first questions you ask yourself in preparing for a voyage, in your maiden voyage, are - What shall I want? What will the ship supply? and what will it not supply? And, if you are what is called a provident person, the chances are ten to one , out of fear that enough creature comforts of life will not be provided , you will be disposed to furnish yourselves with a number of articles that you may deem necessary. Do nothing of the kind. rest perfectly assured that everything on board a steam ship, as on board a packet vessel, will be furnished that can contribute to your comfort or pleasure.
<pb id="p.14" n="14">
<p>Experience has long since shown the wants of
voyagers, and it is to the interest of owners of vessels to provide for them amply. You will therefore
entertain no fear on this score, nor go to the trouble
and expense of making preparations that will be
useless.
</p><p>The great advantage that steam ships possess
over packet vessels, is not merely in their greater
speed, but in the close calculation that may be made
as to the time consumed in their passage; another
advantage arises from the fact of steam vessels
never being becalmed.
</p><p>It would be impossible to convey any adequate
idea of the horrors of such a secne to one who has
not experienced it. The writer, who, as your <emph>Chaperon</emph> will have hereafter to speak in the first person, has been becalmed in the Atlantic for six days
at a time, and will not speedily forget the circum
stance. The positive assurance, morning after
morning, that you are precisely in the same situation that you were the day previously, is not mere
ly sufficient to give you the horrors, but, if you are
hypocondriacal, to induce you to commmit suicide
incontinently. You feel that nothing can be more
dreadful. The sluggish inertness of every thing
<pb id="p.15" n="15">
around you-the bosom of the ocean as if seared
-the ship rolling from side to side, with not a
breath of wind to fill a sail or even steady her
the sails flapping against the masts with every motion of the vessel, and, as the Captain will say if
he be an owner, every flap a dollar out of his
pocket-the Captain anxious and gloomy, survey
ing the horizon in every direction for some indication of a change-the sailors superstitiously
whistling for a gust of wind, and no gust coming
to their summons-all tend at the time to introduce
you to those worst of mankind's acquaintances,
the blue devils; and you feel that going out of your
course, or even backwards, would be preferable to
your distressing situation.
</p><p>On the other hand, it is generally admitted that
steam ships encounter more rough weather than
packet vessels, an
d in such cases the double motion of the sea and the machinery in some ships is
more disagreeable. This is not the case with all.
Some of the steam ships, in the roughest weather,
have not had even occasion to put up the stanchions of the tables.
</p><p>In packet ships, from the comparative smallness
of the number of cabin passengers, and from the
<pb n="16" id="p.16">
length of time that they are voyaging, you become familiarly acquainted with each other, and
are all as one family. In a steam ship, on the
contrary, from the number of passengers and the
short duration of the voyage, you can hardly become acquainted with the features of your fellow voyagers before you are in port. The time is, nevertheless, passed very agreeably. Each person,
unless he be very hard to please, finds some congenial spirits, who form little exclusive parties;
and Whist-Chess-Backgammon, and Checquers
-wile away the evenings.
</p><p> The log of any of the steam ships may be obtained at the offices of the various agents for the
Steam Atlantic Companies by persons disposed to
go out. To the published account of the first voyage of the Great Western, a very graphic Journal,
from the pen of Mr. Foster of Philadelphia, is annexed.
</p><p>Are you disposed to take the voyage? Your
hand! You are on board! We are under weigh.
The steam boats which have accompanied us, one
by one have taken their departure. The forests of
masts that line our beautiful rivers are lost in the
distance. We have left our broad and splendid
<pb id="p.17" n="17">
bay behind; Long Island and Staten Island become dim; darkness covers all nature with its
pall. Put on your night-cap, and sleep upon this
Chapter; you shall wake in the next in merry
England.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter">
<head> CHAPTER II.<emph>Hotels-Boarding Houses-Conveyances.</emph></head>
<p>You have crossed the ocean, with its agreeable
and disagreeable associations. You have been
whirled along in rail-road cars, or you have ensconced yourself in or on a stage-coach, on, in preference,
if the day is fine; and you have an umbrella, and
don't mind the dust. Looking around you upon
the diversified scenery that meets your eye, your
thoughts, when not engrossed by some especial
beauty in the landscape, will outstrip the speed of
the fleet horses that are bearing you along in fine
style, and carry you, "in advance of the mail," to
London. Having brought you there, that is, in
spirit, they will ask you where you shall sojourn.
It is an important question, the decision of which
will prove a source of infinite comfort or inconvenience to you.
</p><p>Stay the first night, or day and night, as it may
be, at an hotel. It matters not which. You will
<pb id="p.19" n="19">
find plenty in the immediate vicinity of the place
where the stage may stop. If, however, you wish
to be in a fashionable neighborhood, get into a
hackney-coach, and tell the coachman to drive you
to any hotel in Bond Street or that neighborhood.
Stay there until you can change your residence for
a boarding-house-no longer.
</p><p>The manners and customs of an English and
American hotel are as wide apart as the poles. In
America, a traveller, I mean a stranger, cannot do
better than to put up at an hotel, in order to get an
insight into the manners of the people that he is
among, and, especially, to form acquaintances. In
England a stranger cannot take a more impolitic
step. He may live so for a year, and, unless hehas
letters of introduction, or other means of acquiring
information, form a most erroneous idea of the
manners of the English, and fail to create a single
acquaintance.
</p><p>I will suppose an American gentleman to have
arrived for the first time at an hotel in London-
say Long's, in Bond Street; one is a sample of the
rest. He is shown into his room. In the morning
he rings the bell for the waiter, and learns that he
can take his breakfast in his own apartment or the
<pb id="p.20" n="20">
coffee-room. The custom of his country induces
him to prefer the latter. He descends. But he
does not see, as he has been accustomed at home,
a table standing the whole length of the room, covered with a choice collection from which he has
but to choose that which most tempts his appetite.
In lieu of this, he sees a number of small tables,
placed, most probably, in a mahogany box, as the
enclosures which often encompass the tables are
called. Each table is covered with a spotlessly
white table-cloth. Into one of these he is ushered,
and has to give his order for whatever he may
choose for his morning's repast. Into the box occupied by him no one presumes to enter; it is as
sacred as if it were his house. He sits "solitary
and alone," spoken to by none, and speaking to
none, unless it be the waiter. At the various other
tables in the room he will perceive individuals si
tuated as he is, amusing themselves with the morning newspapers, or two or three friends or acquaintances assembled together, to enjoy that sociable
repast for which he is so desirous. If he were cut
off from a caravansera in the great desert-Zahara-he could not be more solitary. "Cold comfort
this," he mentally exclaims. He looks forward to
<pb id="p.21" n="21">
the dinner hour for something more sociable, At
dinner he finds himself no better off than he was
at breakfast. He dines at any hour of the day or
night that he pleases, but he dines alone. His tea
is taken in a similar manner, and he is, from this
circumstance, perhaps, induced to take his meals
hereafter in his private apartment, and to conclude
that the English are an austere and frigid people,
whose bearing is detestable. The fact is, that he is
in the wrong place. He must get out. He must
get into a boarding-house.
Boarding-houses in London are not so numerous
as in New-York, or in any part of America. But
the traveller who takes up the London Times will
have no difficulty in ascertaining the location of
some twenty or thirty, all of which profess to afford
the most superior accommodation. He will find
those at the West End, in the vicinity of Piccadilly and the squares, the best; not so much in regard
to accommodation--forthe majority of them are excellent in this respect-as in regard to the company,
which is more tonish in this than other quarters of
the metropolis.
</p><p>He will here pay from two to three or four guineas per week, according to the room or rooms
<pb id="p.22" n="22">
that he may select. For two guineas, or about ten
dollars per week, his comfort will be precisely as
great, and his respectability considered precisely as
high, as if he paid a more extravagant price for a
more splendid private apartment or suite of apartments.
</p><p>His style of living will not be precisely the same
as at home, but something like it. Breakfast will be
on the table, a long table, such as he has been used
to in dear America, from nine till ten o'clock, during which time the mistress of the house presides.
After ten o'clock the mistress leaves the room; but
the breakfast remains for some time longer for the accommodation of late risers, who have then to wait
upon themselves. At one o'clock the table will
again be spread in the dining-room with cold meats,
fowls, &amp;c. This remains so for an hour, during
which time the boarders come in to take their
luncheon without any form or ceremony. At six
o'clock dinner is served upon the same table. The
boarder enters, and takes his seat. Here he is no
stranger. His acquaintance will be made immediately by the gentlemen around him; of course after a
general introduction by the lady of the house. At
first he will see nothing uncovered on the table but
<pb id="p.23" n="23">
soup and fish; as soon as these are partaken of,
and the remains removed, their places are supplied;
and the second course is seen to consist of meats
of various kinds and made dishes. These are all
removed, and the table is then covered with game
and pastry. This is the last course. The cloth is
removed; the dessert placed upon the table. He
sits in agreeable conversation with the ladies and
gentlemen by whom he is surrounded for a short time, after which the ladies retire to the drawing-room. The gentlemen remain, and then the general topics of the day-politics, &amp;c. which are supposed to be uninteresting to the ladies, are discussed, until a message, announcing that the urn has
been taken into the drawing-room, is the signal for
the gentlemen to join the ladies once more. The evening is spent as each person pleases. There is not
the slightest restraint. Little groups form to converse; whilst parties are made to please the elderly
ladies. Music often lends its fascination, and if
young people are congregated together, a dance is
not an unfrequent occurrence.
</p><p>Such is life in a boarding-house, which I have
detailed, somewhat fully, in order that the traveller
may know exactly what he is to expect. He will
<pb id="p.24" n="24">
not think the English stiff and formal here, but free
and unrestrained, and sociable to a degree. It is
only at hotels, and among strangers at public places,
that the English put their "austere haviour on."
</p><p> Having then fixed upon a boarding-house for your
residence, your next want is to know how to visit
the various quarters of the metropolis advantageously. For, withouta proper knowledge as to your
procedure, you may visit them very disadvantageously, and return home not much wiser than you
set out.
</p><p>In the first place, if you intend staying in London
for any time, hire a cabriolet at some good livery
stables. By hiring one for any continued time,
you can get, at a moderate charge, a handsome vehicle, that will not be shamed by any that you will
meet in the most fashionable quarters of the town.
You will have a person either to drive or stand behind your cabriolet; if the first, a man; if the second, a boy or a youth, known by the appellation of
tiger. Whoever it is, he will call upon you in the
morning to know at what time you will have your
cab. At the precise time that you have ordered,
it will be at the door of your residence. You can
then make your round of call and visits till dinner.
<pb id="p.25" n="25">
I shall direct you as to the manner of doing these
hereafter. After dinner, if you order it, your cabriolet is brought to you with a fresh horse. You
go to the Opera-Theatre-party or parties; and
it will not be long before your engagements will
be such as to make two or three visits of an evening a common occurrence, From all these you
are brought home without trouble or inconvenience,
</p><p>By adopting this plan at the outset, you will be
enabled to see infinitely more of London than
you could otherwise do, and you will save yourself a great amount of trouble and fatigue, beside the extortionate demands to which you will
be subject from casual conveyances. There is
not probably one of these vehicles (cabriolets) in
every ten that you will meet in the streets the
actual property of the person owning it for the
time, although it appears so. For any individual
having a cabriol for a length of time, may have
his crest emblazoned upon the body of the vehicle.</p></div2>
<pb id="p.26" n="26">
<div2 type="chapter" id="c.3">
<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>A ramble through the business portions of the City.</head>
<p>THE first thing attractive in a great metropolis
is the appearance of its business districts. This
knowledge should be gained at once.
</p><p>It would be as well to make the western extremity of Piccadilly, Ashley House, your starting
point. In traversing Piccadilly, you may be curious
to gaze upon No. 80, formerly 78. It is the house
where Sir <persName>Francis Burdett</> resisted the Speaker's
warrant, and from whence he was conveyed to the
<placeName key="Tower">Tower</>, <datestruct value="1810-04-09">April 9th, 1810</datestruct>. You will also notice
Burlington Arcade, the Egyptian Hall, and the
Albany. At the end of Piccadilly you will turn
down Coventry Street to Charing Cross. You
will stop here for a moment, if you are a man of
taste, to admire the buildings that meet your eye
in every direction. They are almost all of modern
date, save and except the mansion of the Percys.
<pb id="p.27" n="27">
You will gaze a moment upon the statue of Charles
I. and looking beyond, catch a glimpse of a small
portion of that venerable pile where lie the mortal
remains of kings, warriors, poets, and statesmen
-the imbecile dust once worshipped, reverenced,
loved or hated-the dust restored to its kindred
earth, tenantless of the mighty spirits which, while
they warmed it, rescued it from its abstract nothingness, and gave it a "local habitation and a name."
You must not be seduced into paying it a visit at
present. We proceed by the card. Your first
object is to get a correct idea of the great metropolis, or rather the business portion of it.
</p><p>You proceed along the West Strand, past Exeter
Hall, Coutt's banking house, and the Adelphi Theatre; a wide opening to the right greets your eye-
it is Waterloo Bridge. Immediately opposite, on
the -left, is the Lyceum Theatre or English Opera
House. At, or rather adjoining this building, formerly stood Exeter Change, kept by Cross. It was
here that Cunee, the famous elephant, was shot.
The menagerie that was kept here has been removed, chiefly to the Surrey Zoological Gardens. The
building was pulled down to make way for the
great improvements which have of late years adorn<pb id="p.28" n="28">
ed and beautified this part of the town. Further
on to the left are various Newspaper offices,-the
Courier, Post, Satirist, &amp;amp;amp;c.; and to the right, Somerset House and King's College. You pass these
witha cursory glance, and parsing also St. Maryle
Strand and St. Clement's Church, you come to
<placeName key="Temple Bar">Temple Bar</placeName>!
.</p>
<p>This ancient gate, one of the few yet standing,
is highly interesting as a relict of olden times, when
the good city was girt round with a wall. In other
respects, in the great business thoroughfare in which
it stands, it is completely in the way. The citizens,
however, venerate it, and in the march of improvement, which has of late turned London topsy
turvey, and swept away so many remembrances of
by-gone events, they have shown themselves not
altogether Goths, by manfully resisting an attempt
to remove this olden landmark. Upon the succession of a monarch to the throne of England, these
gates are closed, and the sovereign has to knock
for admittance, which is, of course, instantly accorded. This trifling ceremony some think would be
"more honored in the breach than the observance;"
but it is an ancient privilege, and the good citizens
<pb id="p.29" n="29">
of London, like all other good citizens, stand up for
their privileges, nor will they bate one jot. It seems
to be a grand principle with us, poor erring mortals,
to get all we can, and to part with as little as possible, least of all upon " compulsion." But, you will
say, however sound your "morility" may be " Mrs.
Kitty," you are keeping us at the gate. True, and
as you are no sovereign, we have no right to take
such a liberty with you. Enter. You are now in
Fleet Street. At your right is the entrance to the
Middle Temple, at your left the banking-house of
Messrs Hoares. No. 17 was once the residence of
Prince Charles Stuart, son of James the First; here
is the entrance to the Inner Temple. Opposite, is
Chancery Lane, the grand avenue to the Courts of
Chancery-the head-quarters of law stationers-big wig makers, and appropriately enough, as connected with the law,-sponging houses. In that
street the chief of the hums, as the bailiffs are facetiously called, William Levy, holds his court; and
in a street leading out of the lane, the dandy bailiff Whitcomb holds his court; one is as blunt as
a bear, the other as polite as a Chesterfield; but
beware of them both-as Shakspeare says, "keep
thy pen from creditors' books," and you will know
<pb id="p.30" n="30">
little more of these gentlemen than you know now,
which will be quite sufficient iii the way of business. Nos. 64 and 65 is the Bolt-in-Tun Inn, remarkable as being one of the oldest in London
Between 151 and 152 is Bolt Court, famous as
having been the residence of Dr. Johnson. You
now come to an obelisk; it denotes the extent of
the Fleet-ditch in 1775, when it was filled up, and
Bridge Street erected on its site. Here is also a
monument erected to the memory of Robert
Waithman, who filled all the respective city offices,
including the highest, that of Lord Mayor, much
to the satisfaction of the citizens. He was very
active in the cause of Queen Caroline at the time
of the unfortunate differences that existed between
that persecuted lady and George the Fourth. The
pillar is erected before the shop occupied by Mr.
Waithman, a haberdasher's, which still bears his
name. To the right you gaze at Bridge Street,
leading to Blackfriars Bridge, which is also distinguishable. Leading out of Bridge Street is
Printing House Square, where the London Times
is conducted and printed; it is well worthy of a
visit--some other time. To the left you gaze upon a high wall, extending a considerable distance
<pb id="p.31" n="31">
is the Fleet Prison; by a recent act of Parliament
imprisonment for debt is comparatively abolished.
This is highly creditable to, while it is only what
could have been expected from, the liberality of the
age. All the debtors' prisons in London are totally
distinct from criminal prisons. It is more than
probable that you will have full time for observation
at this point, for the two intersecting thoroughfares
are so crowded with carts and vehicles of every
description, that there is rarely an hour in the day.
in which they do not become for a time completely
blocked up. Youkeep straight on, ascending Ludgate Hill, from whence you have the best approach view of St. Paul's,-the Cathedral being
almost entirely blocked in by buildings. No. 24
Ludgate Hill is the London Coffee House, in
which is preserved a stone of hexagonal form, with
a Latin inscription to the memory of Claudia, the
wife of one of the Roman generals who came to
this country. It was discovered in digging a foundation in 1806. No. 38 is the Belle Savage Inn,
said to be named after La Belle Sauvage, a beautiful woman, described in an old French romance
as having been found wild. You are now in St.
Paul's Church-Yard; the Cathedral stands in the
<pb id="p.32" n="32">
centre; you turn to the right, pass Doctor's Commons, and leaving St. Paul's School on your left,
turn at the south-east corner, and proceed into
Thames Street. You turn again in Thames
Street to the left, and keeping on, have a glance
to the right, as you pass it, of Southwark
Bridge. A little further on is Vintner's Hall, a
handsome edifice. Proceeding on, you have a good
view of London Bridge, one of the great improvements of the great metropolis. A little further on, in
Fish Street Hill, the thoroughfare to the old London Bridge, stands the Monument, "pointing to the
skies." Still further is that renowned spot, whose
name has become a by-word-Billingsgate. "Billingsgate fi h-fag" is an opprobrious term applied
generally in England, and often here, to designate
a coarse and vulgar woman. It is certainly questionable whether the fair sex can possibly have
any worse representatives than are congregated in
this fish market. Moll Flagon, in Love in a Village, that amphibious animal, approaches more
nearly to the character of these women than any
other upon record. Adjacent to Billingsgate is the
Custom-House; from this point most of the river
steamboats start. Immediately fronting you is the
<pb id="p.33" n="33">
Tower, now fortunately an object of curiosity, not
of terror, as in its early and bloody days. It is a
dark, frowning, extensive building, black with age;
and its appearance is gloomy enough-especially
to those who look back into the records of the past,
and conjure forth the many, oh, how many, dreadful tragedies therein enacted. Often as I have
gazed upon it, I never did so without melancholy
feelings; and I have, in the heat of a mid-summer's day, felt a chilly, shuddering sensation, as if I
had taken a shower-bath. If you are so affected,
proceed at once up the Minories, a crowded
thoroughfare into White-Chapel and White-Chapel Road.
<p>Now pause and turn back, retracing the short distance from the Minories; from White-Chapel Road
I am about to direct you along what may be called
the chief avenue of the city, the principal artery if
you please. This great continuous way has in the
whole route many names. First, White-Chapel
Road, in which is one long row of butcher's shops
-High Street- White-Chapel (in which are the
Old Blue Boar and Bull Inns; the latter kept by
that great character, and smart, but eccentric woman, Mrs. Ann Nelson, of whom jokes enough are
<pb id="p.34" n="34">
told to fill a moderate-sized Joe Miller,) Aldgate-High Street-Aldgate-Leadenhall Street. Here
is the East India House, a magnificent structure,
the more interesting from the fact of the immense
wealth and power of the great Company which
owns it. The Museum of this institution has recently been opened to the public. It is, in some respects, the most perfect in the world-more particularly in its vast collections from the East. In the
same street, No. 46, was the japan and cutlery
warehouse of Mr. Bently, known ever more commonly by the appellation of Dirty Dick. Also, under 71, which is built near the site of the house inhabited by Stow the historian, are vestiges of the
Chapel of St. Michael, a beautiful specimen in the
Gothic style, erected in 1189, and discovered in
1789. At the end of Leadenhall Street is a great
intersecting avenue of the city, running from Hoxton at one end to Newington atthe other. You keep,
however, straight on along Cornhill, famous in old
times for its lottery offices, and now for the many fine
offices which are here in close connexion. Here
was that fine old structure, the Royal Exchange,
lately consumed. At the foot of Cornhill stands,
on the right the Bank of England, on the left the
<pb id="p.35" n="35">
Mansion House. Running parallel with the Mansion House, the civic palace of the Lord Mayors of
London, is Lombard Street, formerly occupied
by Lombard merchants, who were expelled the
kingdom in the reign of Elizabeth for their usurious transactions. It is now occupied chiefly by
bankers. The house of Shore, the jeweller, whose
unhappy wife Jane has furnished in her history
an important record in the English annals in the
moral lesson her eventful life has taught, still
stands as it then stood. The number is 43. It is
impossible to gaze upon it without commiserating
the fate of the unhappy woman, whose most tragical death blots out the memory of her early transgressions. From the foot of Cornhill you proceed,
in a direct line, along the Poultry. On No. 9 is
one of the ancient signs by which the shops of London were designated-Cheapside, in which the
building No. 73 was erected by Sir Christopher
Wren. At the corner of Cheapside and Aldersgate Street stands that splendid edifice-the New
Post Office.-A view is obtained here of St. Paul's
Cathedral, also of Paternoster Row, which was so
called from the manufacturers of beads and other
emblems of devotion, who formerly inhabited the
<pb id="p.36" n="36">
street. It is now noted as the residence of booksellers. - The <placeName>Chapter Coffee-House</placeName> has long been
famed as the resort of literary characters; and here
are kept files of most of the London and country
newspapers. In Lowell's Court, Richardson, the
novelist, wrote many of his works, at the house of
his friend, Alderman Bridgen, In Pannier Alley is
an ancient piece of sculpture, representing a boy
on a pannier, and underneath is this inscription:
<quote type="blockquote">When ye have sovght
<lb>The city rovnd,
<lb>Yet still this is
<lb>The highest ground.
<lb><datestruct value="1688-08-27">Avgvst the 27 1688.</datestruct></quote>
</p><p>This being close to St. Pauls, shows the great advantage that the Cathedral owns in its site, and accounts for its being seen so far from London.
Continuing your direct course from Cheapside,
you pass along Newgate Street. Here are several
Sculptures. On No. 52 is an ancient sculpture of
Adam and Eve standing by the forbidden tree.
It bears date 1669, and it is believed was formerly
one of those signs by which each shop in London
<pb id="p.37" n="37">
was designated. On No. 80 is another sculpture,
bearing date <datestruct value="1669">1669</datestruct>, representing <persName><forename>Jeffery</forename> <surname>Hudson</surname></persName>the
dwarf, and <persName><forename>William</> <surname>Evans</></persName>the gigantic porter of
<persName>Charles I</persName>. On No.<num value="9"> 9</num>, at the corner of <placeName>Warwick
Lane</placeName>, is a stone figure of <persName><surname>Guy</surname>, <rolename>Earl of <placename>Warwick</placename></rolename></persName>; it
bears date <datestruct value="1668">1668</datestruct>. In the reign of King Athelstan
this Guy won much fame by killing the Danish
chief Coldbrand. At the corner of Newgate Street
is, on one side <placeName>Giltspur Street Compter</placeName>; on the other,
<placeName>Newgate Prison</placeName>. This latter is a vast and gloomy
looking building, against which Boz tells us his
spirits, inexhaustible as they seem, are not proof.
In continuance is Skinner Street, built on a steep
hill, having descended which, you ascend another
still more steep, called <placeName>Holborn Hill</placeName>; from thence
along Holborn, where stands the magnificent Blacking establishment of <PlaceName>Day and Martin</placeName>. Thence
along High Holborn-Broad Street, where stands
<placeName reg="St.Giles' Church">St. Giles' Church</placeName>, where the first clock in London
was lighted with gas. From thence through High
Street, from which runs Tottenham Court Road, up
Oxford Street, at the end of which is Tyburn-Turnpike, formerly the place of executions, and the spot
where <persName reg="Dodd, William">Dr. Dodd</persName> suffered the extremest penalty
of the law for the crime of forgery.</p>
<pb id="p.38" n="38">
<p>This is the end of your route. You will not repent having traversed it, passing as you do, through
a portion of the most crowded parts of the metropolis. By doing this you will be enabled to form
at once an accurate idea of the life, bustle, and
business portion of the town. There are many other
streets, as you will soon find out, that are equally
thronged; you will, however, have traversed
enough to give you a general idea of what is doing.</p></div2>

<head>CHAPTER IV. Doings on Saturday Nights.</head>
<p>If you wish to see all that is curious, and something that you will not see in America, you must
go on a Saturday evening, at any time from dusk
till eleven o'clock, to one of the two extremities of
the metropolis, Tottenham Court Road or <placeName>White-Chapel</placeName>. The only word that I can find to describe
the scene that will there meet your eye is, Babel.
The market scene in Masaniello, as represented at
our theatres, will convey some vague idea.
</p><p>There are hundreds of women thronging the
street, and standing in the road two or three deep,
with almost every article that is edible, except
butcher's meat, that can be conceived, exposed for
sale in flat wicker baskets, which they carry by a
strap suspended from their shoulders. These they
support, when stationary, upon a moveable stand
<pb id="p.40" n="40">
that is taken up in a moment. In these baskets are
stuck one or two candles, defended from the wind
sometimes by a lanthern, but more generally screened by a paper shade, rudely formed, as wanted. Behind them will be found itinerant merchants, who
retail pots, pans, kettles, and almost every article of
tin-ware and crockery. In order to fill up the scene
and make the component parts complete, men,
women, and a number of little ragged children will
be found thrusting in their noses between the persons before described, wherever they can poke
them; with straps, flint and steel, lucifer matches,
or any thing by which they can turn a penny.
The whole of these strange characters, in order to
get off their commodities, shout, bawl, and scream
their goods at the top of their voices, and all at the
same time. Meanwhile the streets are so thronged
with purchasers, that it is next to impossible to
thread them, unless to one accustomed, which he
who is not, soon becomes, in consequence of being
regularly initiated by having his toes well pounded
in the crowd and his ribs well punched.
</p><p>It is altogether a strange, and, for once, an interesting scene. The variety of articles offered the strongly marked, sometimes pretty, and oftener
<pb id="p.41" n="41">
 coarse features of the venders, thrown into strong
relief by the glare of light cast upon them-the
anxious faces of the many, who come out of doors
with a little basket, to take home to their families
a little sustenance, which is too unfrequently obtained-and then the bustle, confusion, and noise
of the cryers, venders, and purchasers, combined-comprise a scene to which no description can do
justice, nor pen less eloquent than the pencil of a
Hogarth, describe.
</p><p>It may be well to remark, that the poor women who hawk fruit, vegetables, &amp;c. about in baskets, are not allowed by law to make any stand in
the streets, and policemen are instructed to prevent
such a nuisance. But on Saturday nights, in the
places that we have mentioned, and in one or two
others to a less degree, there seems to be an immunity allowed. Perhaps the Secretary for the Home
Department is aware that any attempt to put down
these poor men's markets by the police would
meet with resistance both from the people and the
press. Certain it is, that no interference is atterr pted, and it is well that it is so; for, with all the
wealth of London, there is so much wretched and
abject poverty, that without this cheap method of
<pb id="p.42" n="42">
purchasing some of the necessaries of life, the
misery of those in humble circumstances would be
increased tenfold.</p></div2>

<div2 type="chapter" id="c.5">
<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>Interesting Sights.</head>
<p> SHOULD you be in town on the first Thursday
in June, do not fail on that occasion to visit St.
Paul's Cathedral. It is the anniversary of the
Charity children of London. Upon the visit of
the Emperor Alexander of Russia, he declared
that no sight in England was so grand, so magnificent, and so imposing.</p>
<p> Early on the morning of this day all the free
schools of the Established Church in London-and
there are many in every parish-pour forth theirlittle companies of children, each with a banner proclaiming its name and number. These are seen
wending their way in all directions towards the Cathedral. The magnificent pile has been prepared
for their reception. A scaffolding under the great
dome, supporting rows of seats, rising above each
other like those of the Coliseum, has been erected
to a great altitude; and here the children take their
<pb id="p.44" n="44">
places. Visitors gain admission upon this occasion by means of tickets, which are easily obtained
if applied for in time.</p>
<p>At eleven o'clock the ceremony commences. It
consists of a sermon, and portions of the Church
service chanted; also anthems written for the occasion, the Hallelujah choru, God save the Queen,
&amp;c. It is utterly impossible to convey any definite
idea of the magnificence of the sight of this multitude of children. From twelve to fifteen thousand are congregated. Their rising produces a
sound like the rustling of leaves in a forest when
they are stirred by the wind. But when the voices
of these poor children are heard in the anthem pouring forth a strain of thankfulness for the blessings
afforded, it is impossible not to be affected by it.
The immense assemblage of children in one city,
who from the condition of their parents but for these
free schools would be condemned to ignorance,
strikes the beholder forcibly and deeply. The rich
effects of the Charity, which not merely rescues
these little ones from mental darkness, but likewise
administers to their bodily wants, clothes them,
watches over them, and apprentices and provides
for them, in order to make them useful and honor
<pb id="p.45" n="45">
able members of society, opens all the better feelings of the heart; and man exults that such a record,
so vast, so stupendous, exists to show that they can
be and are called into action. Happy for us in this
happy country, is it, that no such wretched state of
poverty exists, as contrasts so forcibly with the vast
wealth of the British metropolis; and that in instituting free schools, more numerous in this country
than in any other, we do all that is necessary.
</p><p> There is a collection made at the door of the
Cathedral in the anniversary celebrations. Itgoes
towards defraying the expenses of the scaffolding;
if any surplus is left, it goes towards the Great
Charity.
</p><p> There is another sight that you can see any day of
the year, that you ought not, if a sight lover, to miss;
it is the interior of the Post Office during business
hours in the morning and evening. In the morning, the particular sight that will repay you for rising at 5 o'clock is the sorters' room in that vast
building, with the sorters in full operation. The mails
in England are so arranged as to come into London at night from all quarters; so that the letters
from all parts are sorted at once. In such a
<pb id="p.46" n="46">
commercial metropolis, therefore, the business that
is done must be most interesting.
</p><p> Being here, it will be as well to remain till the
sorting is over, which is before 8 o'clock. At 8
A. M. precisely, the Government omnibuses,
painted red, body-color, and emblazoned with the
Royal arms, are drawn up in the Post Office yard.
They are filled instantly by the postmen, each, with
his packet of letters, taking his appointed place,
sitting near the door in the order in which he is to
leave it. The omnibus darts off; it stops, the man
next the door gets out. It dashes on again, stops, and
the next retires, and so on; to the end of the town.
This is the case with all the omnibuses; and in
about 20 minutes or half an hour from the time
that they leave the Post Office, which is a central
situation, the postmen are simultaneously delivering
their letters all over the metropolis.
</p><p> The Post Office is again an object of attraction
about 7 o'clock P. M. At this hour the mails leave
London for all parts of the kingdom. They are
drawn up in the same manner as the omnibuses,
but their appearance is far more imposing. The
coaches are most unique in their appearance; the
cattle by which they are drawn, of great value.
<pb id="p.47" n="47">
The great number of these, starting at the same
time, and their great beauty, are highly interesting;
besides, it is a sight that can be seen in no other
portion of the world.
</p><p> This sight forms an object of attraction to the
citizens who have seen it hundreds of times. In
various parts of the town numbers assemble regularly to see the mail coaches pass, particularly
at the Angel Inn, Islington, where, on a summer's
evening, from one to two hundred persons may be
constantly seen waiting the arrival of the mails.
From this spot the people have a good view of
those which traverse the North Road, as they can
see their approach for some distance up Goswell
Street Road.
</p><p> There is a grand procession of the mail coaches
and omnibuses on the sovereign's birth-day, when
they appear newly decorated; the coachmen and
guards, as well as the postmen, in new scarlet
coats. It starts from St. James's Palace at about
5 o'clock, and proceeds up Bond Street. It is a
splendid sight.
</p><p> There is another sight, rightly considered by the
citizens
"more honored in the breach than the observance;"
<pb id="p.48" n="48">.
I mean the annual pageant, designated "The
Lord Mayor's Show." It is too well known to require description, even if it had not, as ismost likely it has, given up the ghost.
</p><p> There is a sight that you cannot fail of seeing
if you are in London at the proper time; it is the
May-Day sports, or, as it ought to be called, the May
Days' sports, for they last three days. These are
also too well known to require any lengthened description. It will be sufficient to say, that formerly
the sweeps of the metropolis, on the first three week
days in May, kept holiday; and decking themselves
out in pieces of colored paper made into the form
of bows, tassels, &amp;c., danced about to the tune of
their spades and shovels, in some instances round
a green, carried by a man concealed inside, called
Jack-in-the-Green, and earned a considerable sum
of money by their operations. It is questionable,
however, whether they were much benefitted by it,
as they were generally apprentices to the Jack-in-
the-Green, who doubtless, in nine cases out of ten,
pocketed the plunder. Of late years, however, the
little sweeps have been almost driven out of the
field by gangs of gypsies, who, finding how profitable were the May Day voluntary contributions,
<pb id="p.49" n="49">
tame themselves dressed up as sweeps. They
have done much towards breaking up the custom,
which will soon die away altogether. The public,
which looked upon the antics of the poor little sweeps
to seduce its charitable consideration, views with
disgust this buffoonery in men, who are, many of
them, thieves and dissolute characters.
</p><p> On the 5th of November, formerly was a sight,
now obsolete. Effigies of Guy Fawkes were
carried through various parts of the metropolis by
boys, who studied a speech for the occasion, not
quite so eloquent as Forrest's oration, and generally
metrical. I remember hearing one, which ended
with the following couplet:
</p><p> "Get a pitchfork to stick in his eyes,
</p><p> And send him to the d-l, to make mince-pies."
<p>This species of cookery was not much relished,
and now Sir Guido Faux's memory rests on History's records, no more illustrated by the odes and
conflagrations to which his effigy was subjected.
</p><p>Another sight, for which London is famous, is
Bartholomew Fair, held in Smithfield on the 3d of
September and the three following days. It is
held by virtue of a charter granted by Henry II.
upon a spot famous and infamous for tournaments,
<pb id="p.50" n="50">
theatrical performances, and martyrdoms. Here
Wat Tyler was killed by the lord mayor Walworth.
Here hundreds of voices have been raised in acclamation at the feats of adventurous knights, while
the bright eyes of beauty, the brightest guerdon,
beamed upon the achievements of the skilful and
the valiant. Here the cry of agony has gone forth
from the victims at the stake, surrounded by the
burning faggots; shrieks which have preceded
their spirits, but a little way, to the throne of the
Eternal God, to tell of the hellish malignity of man
when abandoned to the lust of his evil passions;
and here, now, on the site of these memorable doings,
is yearly enacted a piece of tom-foolery disgraceful to the city. Matthews has described the humors of Bartholomew Fair; but the dissipation,
beastly intoxication, depravity, sin, and guilt, caused
by this exhibition, has been rarely commented upon.
</p><p>The other London sights of daily occurrence
are, Punch and Judy, that ancient entertainment;
the Fantoccini, Italian boys, with dancing dogs and
monkeys; tumblers; jugglers, &amp;amp;amp;c. Music in abundance of all kinds, both by day and night, is common in the streets at the West End of the town,
and in neighborhoods not devoted to business,
<pb id="p.51" n="51">
from the organ grinder to the full band, from the
solo singer to bands of singers, chiefly Germans,
who, with accompanying instrumental performers,
give occasionally some very fine harmonies, and
thankfully receive any gratuitous compensation
that you may bestow. There is no popular opera
produced at either the Italian or English theatres,
but the favorite airs are set to the barrel organ, and
played about the streets; some of these organs are
as fine toned as others are execrable. The Christmas carol singers are also a sight once a year, but
the song is getting into disuse. Instruments chiefly
usurp its place.</p></div2>
<pb id="p.52" n="52">
<div2 type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER VI. <emph>The Parks</emph>.</head>
<p>THERE are in London, five parks, viz. Hyde Park,
Green Park, St. James's Park, the Queen's Gardens,
and the Regent's Park. All of these, except the
Queen's Gardens, are open to the public. On the
outskirts of London an4 adjoining Hyde Park is
Kensington Gardens, also open to the public.
</p><p>Hyde Park is bounded on the north by Oxford
Street, on the south by Knightsbridge, on the east
by Park Lane, and on the west by Kensington
Gardens. It is a magnificent enclosure, containing
395 acres, well wooded and watered. The Serpentine River takes its course through it. The chief
entrances are at Hyde Park Corner and Oxford
Street. There are also entrances in Park Lane,
Knightsbridge, and Kensington. The entrance at
Hyde Park Corner, adjoining Apsley House, the
residence of the duke of Wellington, is, by far,
<pb id="p.53" n="53">
the most splendid. It is under a triumphal arch,
"completed in 1828, from designs by Mr. Decimus
Barton. It consists of a screen of fluted Ionic columns, with three archways for carriages, two for
foot-passengers, and a lodge. The whole frontage
extends about 107 feet. The central gateway is
adorned with four columns supporting the entablature, above which is a frieze running round the four
sides of the structure. This frieze was executed
by M. Henning, jun. and represents a naval and
military triumphal procession. The side gateways
present two insulated Ionic columns flanked by
antae. The gates, which are beautiful specimens
of bronzed iron-work, were manufactured by
Messrs Bramah." Immediately on passing under
the arch you come in view of the colossal statue
of Achilles. It bears the following inscription: "To
Arthur, Duke of Wellington, and his brave companions in arms, this statue of Achilles, cast from
cannon taken in the battles of Salamanca and
Vittoria, Toulouse and Waterloo, is inscribed by
their countrymen." On the base is inscribed, " Placed on this spot on the 18th day of June, 1822,
by command of His Majesty George the Fourth."
It is placed so as to be seen from the northern and
<pb id="p.54" n="54">
western portions of Apsley House. Running almost parallel with Park Lane is the famous drive
extending from Oxford Street to Piccadilly.
</p><p>A stranger visiting this place when London, is,
emphatically, out of town, or at an improper hour
of the day, could scarcely conceive the gaiety and.
splendor of the scene in the proper season and at
the proper time. The proper time is from four or
half-past four o'clock, until six or seven P. M.
The whole drive is then filled with equestrians, and
equipages of the most splendid description. This
is the grand resort of the fashionables. Here they
come to see and to be seen. The carriages are for
the most part thrown entirely open, and the ladies
are dressed in a manner which they deem becoming for a place where they are the "observed of all
observers."
</p><p>This gay and gorgeous meeting may be called
the chief feature of the Park; but it has others
highly interesting. It is open to every body alike
-rich and poor. Sporting on the everlasting verdure of the fine sward, are to be seen groups of
rosy children, with their no less rosy nurses and
protectors. Here, too, at an early hour every morning in Spring, Summer, and Autumn, the various
<pb id="p.55" n="55">
regiments, quartered for the time being at the
Knightsbridge and Portman Street Barracks, go
through a variety of military tactics, and, in the
summer, occasionally, grand reviews and sham
fights are performed.
</p><p>Perhaps, and certainly to my taste, the most interesting time to view the park is on a Sunday. It
is literally thronged. And to see the hosts of those
who, by their appearance and manner, are evidently
working mechanics, and laborers, cleanly in person
and neatly attired, with their wives on their arms,
and their young children, in the ecstacy of their
infantine delight, sporting before them, is indeed
pleasurable to all but those fanatics who, leaving
the rich untouched in their purple and fine gold,
would rob the poor of the only recreations-alas !
there are too few-that they can participate in.
There is many a pale and cadaverous face, which
one meets upon such occasions, that tells plainly
of close confinement, and hard and incessant
toil throughout the week; but each is lighted up
with a passing smile, as it escapes, for one day
at least, from its confinement, and looks upon nature, sweet refreshing nature, with a rapturous and
delighted gaze. There is not one person in the
<pb id="p.56" n="56">
metropolis, how poor soever, but looks upon this
park as his own. It is his own. It belongs to the
public, and cannot be taken away.
</p><p>Should you be in London in the winter, do not
fail to visit the Serpentine River when frozen over.
The skating there will repay you for your trouble,
even if you are no skater yourself.
</p><p>The Green Park is bounded on the north by
Piccadilly, on the south by the Queen's Palace,
on the east by a handsome row of houses, and on
the west by Constitution Hill, which divides it
from the Queen's Garden. The chief entrance is
opposite Hyde Park Corner. On the north side of
this park is one of the reservoirs of the Chelsea
water works; at one end of it isa fountain. Atthe
N. W. is the lodge of the deputy ranger of St.
James's and Hyde Parks. It is surrounded by a
shrubbery.
</p><p>St. James's Park possesses more local interest
than any other. It has always been a favorite of
the monarchs of England from the time of that
bluff bully, Henry VIII. Scott, in his Peveril of
the Peak, introduces us to Charles II. in this, once
favorite resort of his, with happy effect. We will
visit it from St. James's Palace.
<pb id="p.57" n="57">
</p><p> You had better set out early on your visit, so as
to be in the court-yard of the palace at the time of
changing guard. It is between ten and eleven
o'clock, when the band of one of the regiments of
foot guards, and the band of the regiment on duty
at St. James's Palace, play alternately for nearly
half an hour, in the most delightful manner, the
most choice and popular overtures and marches of
the day. From the palace we enter the mall of the
park, by which it is bounded on the north; on the
south by the celebrated Bird Cage Walk; on the east
by the Horse Guards; and on the west by the
Queen's (Buckingham) Palace. Leigh, in his
"London," says that "St. James's Park was a
complete marsh till the time of Henry VIII. who,
having built St. James's Palace, inclosed it, laid it
out in walks, and, collecting the waters, gave the
new inclosed ground and building the name of St.
James's Park. It was afterwards much improved
by Charles II., who employed Le Notre to add several fields, to plant rows of lime trees, and to lay
out the mall, which is a vista, half a mile in length,
at that time formed into a hollow smooth walk,
skirted by a wooden border, with an iron hoop at
the further end, for the purpose of playing a game
<pb id="p.58" n="58">
with a ball called a mall. He formed a canal, one
hundred feet broad and twenty-eight hundred long,
with a decoy and other ponds for water fowl. Succeeding kings allowed the people the privilege of
walking here; and William III., in <datestruct value="1699">1699</datestruct>, granted
the neighboring inhabitants a passage into it from
Spring Gardens. In <date value="1814">1814</date>, the return of peace
was celebrated in this place by fire works, boat
races, illuminations, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. A pagoda
bridge was erected over the canal, but constructed
of such slight materials that it was obliged to be
taken down in <date value="1820">1820</date>. In <datestruct value="1828">1828</datestruct> the appearance of
the park was materially improved. The central
portion was laid out in walks and shrubberies, the
canal assumed a more picturesque form, being
made to flow round an island at each extremity,
and the whole was surrounded by an iron railing,
with gates for the daily admission of the public.
Opposite to the House Guards, in the fine space
between that range of buildings and the canal, are
two great guns. The first is a Turkish piece of
ordnance. It is of immense length, and has on it
variegated impressions emblematical of the country. It was brought from Alexandria by our troops,
and is mounted upon a carriage of English structure,<pb id="p.59" n="59">
 which has several Egyptian ornaments. The
second is the Grand Mortar, brought from the siege
of Cadiz in <date value="1812">1812</date>, and presented to His Majesty
(<persName>George IV.</persName>) by the Spanish regency in <date value="1814">1814</date>, but
not placed here till <date value="1816">1816</date>. It is eight feet in
length, twelve inches in diameter at the mouth,
and is capable of throwing a shell three miles.
The mortar is placed on an allegorical carriage,
figuratively describing the raising of the siege, and
bearing several inscriptions. The weight of the
whole is sixteen tons.
</p><p>Sunday is the best time to view this park for company's sake. On a Sunday afternoon and evening, in the summer, the enclosed space by the water
is crowded by the middling and humbler classes,
who revel among the gay parterres, or, seated on
chairs on the margin of the canal, watch the motions of the water-fowl; or, raising their eyes,
view, towering above the tall trees which here
abound, that ancient, time-honored and venerable
pile-Westminster Abbey, whose appearance is
more picturesque from this point than any other.
</p><p>Leading to the palace, from Piccadilly, is a triumphal arch, erected from designs by Mr. Nash.
It is of the Corinthian order. Toward <placeName>Hyde Park</placeName>
<pb id="p.60" n="60">
are four columns, two at each side of the arch,
supporting a portico. The arch itself is adorned
with six Corinthian pilastres. The front towards
the gardens is exactly similar. The vaulted part
in the centre is divided into compartments richly
sculptured. A small doorway on each side leads
to the porter's apartments, within which are stairs
leading to the top. Along the entablature are
placed alternately G. R. and the imperial crown.
The gates of bronzed iron-work are adorned with
the royal arms. They were made by Messrs.
Bramah.
</p><p>The <placeName>Regent's Park</placeName> is the most beautiful in London. It is, in form, nearly circular. It contains
450 acres, finely laid out in gardens, shrubberies and
promenades. It is bounded for about two thirds of
its whole extent by splendid terraces of every form
and variety of architecture; many of them handsomely adorned by choice sculpture, representing
allegorical subjects.
</p><p>The best entrance is from Portland Place through
Park Crescent on the east side, crossing the New
Road to Park Square. Here stands the Diorama.
Do not fail to visit it. The optical delusion here
is most complete. It is impossible to describe it to
<pb id="p.61" n="61">
do it justice. The views represented have the appearance of reality, not only from the effect of
the paintings, highly wrought, but from the effect
produced by the various degrees of light brought
to bear upon them. Thus, in a cathedral, some
time since exhibited, you gazed upon the interior
of an edifice in broad and open day. Gradually
the light faded away, and finally, and almost imperceptibly, object after object became indistinct and
darkness reigned. Then the candelabras were lighted in the edifice, a procession of monks was seen to
cross the distant isle of the cathedral, and finally
the whole building became crowded with figures
not there previously. There is no effect that cannot be produced in this admirable establishment.
Sunrise and sunset; dawn and twilight; moonlight
the obscuration of the sun by a passing cloud; and
the shadows of leaves and trees cast upon the
ground when the sun again bursts forth, are all
faithfully delineated, and without any thing like
-theatrical effect. Nature seems enamoured of the
art that has wrought her outlines, and she has animated the scene as with her presence.
</p><p>The plan of the building is thus described by
Leigh.
<pb id="p.62" n="62">
</p><p>"The interior resembles a small theatre; the
part allotted to spectators, consisting of a tier of
boxes elevated three or four feet above the amphitheatre or pit. Above is a circular ceiling, ornamented with transparent devices, and surrounded
with medallions of eminent painters and sculptors.
The whole is moveable, and made to revolve with the
spectators at intervals of a quarter of an hour; so
that as one picture recedes, the other comes gradually into view."
</p><p>The visitor should, if possible, take a clear fine
day to view the paintings, when the effect is greatly increased.
</p><p>Not far from the Diorama, is the Colosseum, designed by <persName reg="Burton, Decimis">Mr. Burton</persName> for the purpose of exhibiting
Mr. Horner's Panorama of London. The building presents a Greek Doric portico of six columns,
and is surmounted by a dome 126 feet in diameter,
75 feet of which are entirely of glass. Its form is
that of a polyglon with 16 faces, each 25 feet; so
that the circumference of the building is 400 feet.
The length of the walls on the outside is 64 feet, and
on the inside 79 feet; while the sky-light of the dome
is 112 feet from the ground. The whole of the
building is covered with cement intended to imitate <pb id="p.63" n="63">
stone. Beyond the entrance are vestibules,
one of which leads to a saloon for the exhibition of
works of art, and the other to the various galleries from which the Panorama is to be viewed.
</p><p>In each of these galleries are placed telescopes;
and so finished is the painting, that objects in the
distance, indistinct, and names of streets invisible
to the naked eye, are, by means of these glasses,
rendered perfectly clear.
</p><p>The Panorama occupies forty thousand square
feet, about an acre of canvass. The various objects depicted are from drawings taken by Mr.
Horner from the top of St. Paul's Cathedral. Mr.
Horner embarked his fortune in this undertaking,
and came to this country, we believe, ruined. The
painting was executed under the direction of Mr.
Parris, whose style we have had a specimen of in
his tasteful paintings on the saloon panels of the
Great Western steam-ship.
</p><p>There is a curious contrivance in this building.
The first time that I visited the Colosseum I was
not aware of it. I went with a friend. We entered the building.
</p><p>"Step into this room," said he.
</p><p>A door opened, and we entered a beautiful little
<pb id="p.64" n="64">
bijou of a place. Upon a table in the centre were
several books and magazines. I took up one. A
bell rang. I was getting amused with the magazine. Again a bell rang. The door was opened.
"You can step out here, if you please," said a man;
not the one who had let us in. We stepped out,
and my astonishment was great at finding that I
had ascended tothe top of the building, room and
all. The room is purposely contrived to ascend
and descend, to save visitors the fatigue of travelling up the all but interminable staircase.
<p>The gardens surrounding the Colosseum are laid
out with great taste, skill, and effect. Entering
them to the right of the building, you pass into a
splendid conservatory, where is a fine collection of
the most rare and beautifulexotics. Pursuingyour
way for some distance still in the conservatory, you
come to a rotunda, in the centre of which is a
fountain admirably constructed, and in the water
beneath gold and silver fish sporting. To the
right of the fountain is the entrance to a cavern,
which looks as black as night. You enter, and
grouping your way along some dark, uneven, rocky
passages, are rewarded by the sight of two ingeniously contrived and finely executed views,-one
<pb id="p.65" n="65">
of a sea grotto, the other of a shipwreck. The
motion of the waters, the struggling of the vessel
with the waves that threaten every moment to engulf it, and the roar of the sea, are all exceedingly
natural. The situation renders the illusion more
complete; every other object is excluded. You are
standing in an artificial cavern, and are supposed
to see these views through a long vista of cave
from a fissure in the rock. Coming from this romantic spot, you again enter the rotunda, and proceeding to the left, enter the fac simile in every
minutiae of a Swiss Cottage. The persons in
charge of it are dressed in the costume of Swiss
peasants; the furniture is all in accordance. Passing through the several rooms, you come out on an
opposite side to that which you entered, in front
of an Alpine scene, that is truly astonishing. Before you is a miniature lake-beyond, vast mountain scenes, of a dark and wild character, whereo
mountain shrubs are growing, and down which a
waterfall is coursing which falls into the lake. In
the recesses of the mountain there is an Eagle, who
seems to think his situation perfectly natural. Here
is also a bench, upon which the Emperor Napoleon
often rested. The Alpine view is also seen through
<pb id="p.66" n="66">
the windows of the Swiss Cottage. The effect
cannot be conceived unless witnessed.
</p><p>Adjoining the Colosseum, a number of rooms
have been fitted up for evening entertainments.
The chief of these is the Hall of Mirrors, probably
the most chaste and elegant apartment in London.
</p><p> We now come to the greatest pride and ornament of this splendid Park-the Zoological Gardens. Nothing can be conceived more delightful
than the whole arrangements of this splendid place.
The gardens themselves, with their rare and beautiful parterres of flowers, shrubberies, lawns and
promenades, are not surpassed by any in the kingdom. Then the birds and animals-a vast collection, are all appropriately lodged; their dens, paddocks, houses, &amp;c., being made after the model of
the buildings of the countries from whence they
are brought; and as the immense collection embraces specimens from every known country, the
picturesque appearance of the Gardens may be easily imagined.
</p><p> The Gardens were opened in <date value="1828">1828</date>, since which
period they have become greatly extended. In
order to obtain.admission during the week, it is necessary to obtain an order from one of the members.<pb id="p.67" n="67">
 These orders are widely circulated through
the town. They do not admit a visitor without
his paying one shilling at the gate. From the
great amount of visitors who attend this favorite
resort, a considerable revenue is derived.
</p><p>The chief day to visit the Gardens during the
London summer season is on Sunday, the hours
from 3 to 6 P. M. Upon this occasion they are
crowded by the nobility and fashionables. There
will not be seen less than from three to five hundred carriages in the vicinity of the gates. The
Gardens then present a scene of splendor that is
unsurpassed. No orders are admissible on Sundays; entrance can only be obtained by members'
tickets, small circular pieces of ivory. Each member is allowed to introduce two friends.
</p><p>The Zoological Society, to whom the Gardens
belong, have also a museum in Bruton Street, containing several thousand stuffed animals.
</p><p>The other beauties of the Park-the terraces of
every variety of architecture, and ornaments with
sculpture and basso relievo; the gardens, promenades, the inner ring with its villas, lawns, and
lake, will all be unfolded to your view in passing
round, and require no description here.</p>

<div2 type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER VII. Places of Amusement.</head>
<p> THE chief places of amusement in the Metropolis are the <placeName>Queen's Theatre</>, or<placeName>Italian Opera
House</>, Drury Lane, Covent Garden, the Haymarket, <placeName>English Opera House</>, Madame Vestris's
Olympic, Braham's, St. James's, the Adelphi, Surrey, Victoria, Sadlers Wells, Astleys, and Tottenham Street Theatres, and the Coliseum and <placeName>Vauxhall Gardens</>.
Of these the <placeName>Italian Opera</> ranks first, and is, indeed, the only place of amusement that is extensively patronized by persons of rank and fortune.
There may be a variety of reasons for this. Some
have attributed it to the decline of the drama, and
the times have changed since the Kembles and the
Siddons witched admiring audiences; or since
OTHELLO could boast a cast embracing Kean,
Young, and Charles Kemble; or such pieces as
<pb id="p.69" n="69">
THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL and THE RIVALS were
represented by Charles Young, Charles Kemble,
William Farren, Richard Jones, Bartley, Fawcet,
Blanchard, Conner, Mrs. Davenport, Miss Chester,
&amp; or since Munden and Elliston were the life
and soul of the WEST INDIAN ; ROAD TO RUIN;
POOR GENTLEMAN; and a whole host of other choice
pieces. Of the performers thus enumerated, the
majority are dead, others have retired from the
stage, and none remain but William Farren and
Bartley, both most excellent performers; the first
the most finished comedian that has appeared for
many years. Still I do not think that the want
of patronage to the English theatres by the higher
classes is owing so much to the dearth of theatrical talent as to the changes which fashion has
wrought. That fickle goddess, with her magic
wand, has turned night into day, and the good old
English manners and customs topsy-turvey.
In the golden days of Queen Bess, mid-day was
the fashionable hour for dining. Since that period,
a scavanger, in the march of intellect, "owing to
this refusion of useful knowledge," as I once heard
a good old, but not remarkably erudite, lady say,
would be ashamed to dine at so vulgar an hour;
<pb id="p.70" n="70">
and in the golden days of <persName>Queen Victoria</>, the
fashionable hour of dining is 7, 8, and 9 o'clock P.
M. Now, as the performances at the theatres commence at 7 o'clock, it is almost impossible that the
theatres should be patronized to any extent by the
nobility and principal gentry.
The <placeName>Queen's Theatre</> is a spacious and elegant
building, considered generally to be unrivalled.
"The stage within the walls is sixty feet long and
eighty feet broad, and the space across, from the
boxes on each side, forty-six feet. Each boxis enclosed by curtains, according to the fashion of the
Neopolitan theatres, and is furnished with six
chairs. There are five tiers of private boxes, all of
which are private property, or are let out for the
season to persons of rank or fashion." These are
in many instances re-let through the agencies of
Messrs. Ebers and Mitchell of Bond Street, Sams
of Pall Mall, and others; and there are generally
some that can be had on any occasion. The boxes
will accommodate nine hundred persons, the pit
eight hundred, and the gallery eight hundred. The
subscription nights are Tuesdays and Saturdays,
and occasionally for extra-performances such as
benefits. It is also always open on the evening of
<pb id="p.71" n="71">
a day upon which a drawing-room is held. It is
then customary for many of those who have been
presented at court to appear in their court dresses,
feathers and jewels; at this time the house appears
to its greatest advantage, and is exceedingly imposing.
No person should visit the British metropolis, on
pleasure bent, without seeing the Opera, which is in
session from February till August. At the early part
of the season the Opera rarely puts out any particular attraction. It is not till after Easter that its
whole strength is congregated, at about which time
the Italian Opera in Paris closes for the season.
Every department is then complete. The orchestra
is most efficient; it embraces many of the first instrumental performers in the world. The choristers are also very efficient, and this is a remarkable
feature in the Italian Opera. For, while in the
English theatres portions of an opera in the hands
of Mrs. Wood, Miss M. Tree, Miss Stephens,
Madame Vestris, Miss Sherriff, Miss Romer,
Messrs. Braham, Harry Phillips, Sapio, Wilson,
Templeton, and others, have been, or are given with
great effect; yet the chorusses have been almost always comparatively slovenly; and the concerted
<pb id="p.72" n="72">
pieces are often the most beautiful portions of an
opera.
The last season was one of unexampled splendor. The Opera boasted the Grisi, Persiani, Albertazzi, Rubini, Tamburini, Lablache, &amp;c. It
was, moreover, the last season that that matchless
tenor, Rubini, appeared; and it is said that he surpassed all his former efforts, and all lovers of song
deeply regret his retirement.
The Opera House contains also a grand concert
room, ninety-five feet long and thirty-five feet high.
It is handsomely fitted up. Here concerts are occasionally given by the principal artistes of the
Opera, and by Societa Armonica, &amp;c.
In this theatre are annually held a number of
masquerades. No respectable female would go to
them, or going, would confess that she had been.
The scene is truly gorgeous, and, after supper, truly disgusting. I saw upon one occasion the band
of music engaged to play during supper, literally
pelted from the stage with apples, oranges, and condiments from the table.
The next theatre that takes precedence is Drury
Lane Theatre, Brydges Street. It is a splendid
<pb id="p.73" n="73">
edifice. The interior of the house is thus described
by Leigh:
"It is principally illumined by an elegant
gas chandelier, which hangs over the centre of the
pit. The stage at the opening of the curtain is
forty-three feet in width and thirty-eight in height.
The diameter of the pit is fifty-three feet; and the
height of the house from the pit-floor to the ceiling
is fifty feet six inches. There are three tiers of
boxes, the first and second each containing twenty-nine, and eleven back boxes. In the space on
each side of the lower gallery above the third tier
are nine boxes on each side, and on a level with the
pit are eight private boxes. It is estimated that the
house will accommodate three thousand six hundred
and eleven persons with seats,-the boxes containing one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight,
-the pit eight hundred, the lower gallery six hundred
and seventy-five, and the upper gallery three hundred and eight. The grand saloon is an elegant
room, about eighty-six feet in length."
From some cause or other this establishment has
been a ruinous concern to almost all its managers
of late years. Elliston could make nothing of it.
Mr. Price could make nothing of it. Captain Polhill<pb id="p.74" n="74">
 lost considerably by it; and Mr. Bunn, the present leaser, does not seem to prosper more than the
others who have preceded him. Independently of
the causes already assigned, we may add the high
rent to the earlier named managers; Elliston having paid eleven thousand pounds per annum; Mr.
Bunn has it now for six thousand pounds; but the
chief cause is the taste of the town, which runs after
splendid, gorgeous, and ruinously expensive spectacles and pantomimes; these are got up at an expense often from one thousand to two thousand
pounds sterling, and their success is often precarious.
This was not the case formerly, when Tragedy and
Comedy held supreme possession of the stage. Even
in pantomime people went to see the humor of a
clown, as in respect to Grimaldi; but now that is
out of the question, and pageant and painting are the
only attraction in these Christmas and Easter
pieces.
On Wednesday and Friday evenings during
Lent, and on the 30th of January and on Whitsuneve, Oratorios and selections of sacred music are
performed here and at Convent Garden Theatre.
Equal in point of attraction is the rival of Drury
Lane, Covent Garden Theatre, situated in Bow
<pb id="p.75" n="75">
Street, a few yards from the former establishment.
The exterior of this theatre is far more splendid,
and the interior more chastely elegant than its rival.
The interior is of a horse-shoe form. The breadth
of the stageat the curtain is fifty-one feet. The
fronts of the boxes, of which there are three tiers,
are appropriately ornamented with the national emblems-the rose, the shamrock, and the thistle. The
house will contain about three thousand persons.
It is illuminated by a superb chandelier, suspended
from the centre of the roof.
The managers of this theatre have not been
more successful than those of Drury Lane since
the retirement of Harris, and it is presumed from
the same causes.
Although the theatres are not generally patronized by the higher classes, they are among them,
and indeed all classes, as it has been truly observed
by the author of the Great Metropolis, the leading
subject of conversation in London. This is, perhaps, in a measure owing to the admirable critiques
ontheperformances, which, generally speaking, appear in the London newspapers and in the magazines. It is a matter of great importance to the
proper guidance of the stage, without which it can
<pb id="p.76" n="76">
in no place arrive at perfection. It has been
much neglected here, and the drama has suffered in consequence. Every thing relating to the
stage and to popular performers is in London a
matter of great interest in society, and anecdotes
are carefully preserved and stored in the minds of
the citizens, residents, and frequenters of the Great
Metropolis.
One of the prompters of Covent Garden Theatre
collected a great deal of interesting theatrical matter. I do not think he ever gave it to the world.
He solicited the autographs of all the popular performers who played in his time at the establishment.
They were enriched each by some quaint and appropriate comment. Kean wrote in this book, as
did Macready; my memory fails me as to the matter. Fanny Kemble's writing I remember. She
was playing Juliet when solicited for her autograph.
She took the proffered pen, and wrote "What's in
a name? FANNY KEMBLE." Her father was solicited, the gay and peerless Mercutio of the night.
He saw what his daughter had written and wrote
under it:
<pb id="p.77" n="77">
"Good name in man or woman,
Is the immediate jewel of their soul.
CHARLES KEMBLE."
Liston, when playing Domine Sampson for the
benefit of Miss Sherriff I believe, who is playing
this season at the National, wrote "After  an absence of sixteen years (I am not quite sure as to
the time) I played Dornine Sampson for Miss
Sherriff's benefit, prodigious. JOHN LISTON."
Charles Young, the eminent tragedian, the last
of the Kemble school and great rival of Kean,
wrote in his dressing-room, on the night of his farewell benefit, after his last appearance on the stage,
"Half past 10 o'clock-my lamp has just gone
out-CHARLES YOUNG." This allusion to his retirement from the arena of his triumphs is very
touching.
Happy is he in London who has any such knowledge of dramatic heroes or heroines.
Drury Lane and Covent Garden Theatres usually open on the 1st of October, and close at the end
of June or beginning of July.
The Haymarket Theatre is a highly popular summer theatre. Here Foote, Palmer, Jack Bannister, Matthews, Elliston, Liston, Young, Terry, &amp;c.
<pb id="p.78" n="78">
and Miss Fenton, afterwards the Duchess of Bolton, Mrs. Abingdon, Miss Farren, now Countess
of Derby, Mrs. Gibbs, Mrs. Wilkinson &amp;c. made
their debut.
The Stock Company at this theatre has always
been excellent, and some choice original comedies
have been produced here; but, notwithstanding, Mr.
Morris, long time the manager and proprietor, has
not been successful with it. It is now under the
management of Mr. Webster.
The English Opera House is a new and elegant
building. It is devoted, as its name indicates, to
the representation of English operas, but it has not
proved a profitable speculation to the proprietor, Mr.
Arnold. Comic Italian operas have been produced
here with some success. This is also a summer
theatre, and the rival of the Haymarket Theatre.
It will hold about one thousand eight hundred people, and has two tiers of boxes.
Braham's Theatre is situated in King Street, St.
James's. It is a modern structure, exceedingly elegant, and has been, what few have besides, profitable to the manager. The house has two tiers of
boxes, and will accommodate about one thousand
two hundred persons.
<pb id="p.79" n="79">
The Olympic (Madame Vestris's) Theatre is
one of the most popular in London. It has not
prospered so well, however, in her absence. It is
situated in the lowest, dirtiest, and filthiest part of the
metropolis; and yet is fashionable, as it was in the
days of Elliston, who brought the nobility to it to
witness his choice acting in Rochester.
It may not be amiss to state here, that a community will be led to witness good acting, be it where
it may. To the instances above recorded, is the
factthat Garrick led the town to Goodman's Fields
to witness his performances. I am led to make
these remarks, because it has been asserted that
Wallack can never succeed with his National Theatre, because it is not, as is the Park, in a popular
and crowded thoroughfare. A more absurd idea
was never mooted, as the result has proved. If Mr.
Wallack continues as he has begun, and Mr. Simpson does not keep pace with him, he will make
the National the first theatre in New-York and in
the Union.
The Olympic Theatre is capable of holdingabout
one thousand persons. Madame Vestris has derived immense profits from it. But the little lady
is so boundless in her extravagance that she would
<pb id="p.80" n="80">
exhaust the revenue of a principality if it came into her treasury, or find the end of a gold mine if
one were opened to her.
The Adelphi Theatre, Strand, has always been
a popular and profitable establishment; and its several proprietors, Mr. Rodwell, Yates, andMatthews,
derived great profits from it. It was here that Tom
and Jerry was produced, which was played three
hundred nights, and yielded a profit of nearly twenty thousand pounds sterling. It was herethat John
Reeve become so great a favorite. "He was a fellow of infinite mirth," and in many instances inimitable. He possessed a greater portion of ready
wit than any other actor of his time, and often did
more for an author to win the applause of an audience than the author himself. Unfortunately for
the full development of his talents, John, at an early period of his life, took a great penchant for brandy "cold without." It hurried him prematurely to
the grave. In company, he was the soul of wit
and humor, until, (which was not unfrequently the
case) he lost all command of himself from the
quantity of potations in which he indulged, when
he became a madman fit only for a lunatic asylum.
<pb id="p.81" n="81">
The Adelphi Theatre will hold nearly two thousand when crowded, which is generally the case.
The New Strand Theatre is a neat and compact
little building, capable of containing about eight
hundred persons. It is here that Mr. Hammond
has built up a reputation, by his performance of
Sam Weller in the Pickwickians; and it was here
that Mitchell, the principal comedian of the day, first
developed his powers to a London audience.
Astley's Amphitheatre, situated near Westminster Bridge, is one of the most popular places of
amusement in the metropolis. It is devoted chiefly to Equestrian performances, which are as far
superior to those exhibited by the Cookes here,
some time since, as the performances of the Park
or the National were to those of the Franklin, or even
more so. The Battle of Waterloo was admirably
performed here, and the evolutions of the cavalry
managed wonderfully well. This theatre has always paid well, and is deserving of success. No
one will regret paying it a visit. The riding of Mr.
Ducrow is the most graceful, easy, and at the same
time the most fearless, of any equestrian performance perhaps ever exhibited. The house will contain upwards of two thousand persons.
<pb id="p.82" n="82">
The Queen's Theatre, Tottenham Street, Tottenham Court Road, alias the Fitzroy Theatre,
alias the Recency Theatre, alias the Tottenham
Street Theatre, alias the West London Theatre,
by all of which names it has gone, has been, without exception, the most profitless theatre in London.
Under the managements of Brunton, Lee, and
Chapman, and Mrs. Nisbett, it has had good companies; but rarely, except atintervals, any success.
Madame Celeste, before her popularity, has played
here to a beggarly account of empty boxes. The
house cannot hold more than seven hundred persons.
The Victoria, formerly the Coburg Theatre, is
situated in the Waterloo Road. It is a handsome
theatre, capable of containing upwards of two thousand persons. The gallery alone, the largest in
London, can contain twelve hundred and fifty persons. It was here that the famous glass curtain
was exhibited. Mr. Stanfield, the eminent painter,
first developed the germ of his great talents in this
establishment. The house has never been profitable to the managers; among whom, Messrs. Davidge, Abbot, and Egerton, Glossop, and others
have lost considerably by it. Should Waterloo
<pb id="p.83" n="83">
Bridge ever be thrown open to the public, free of
tollage, the property would be greatly improved.
The Surrey Theatre is situated in the Blackfriars Road, near the Obelisk. The pit is immensely large, and will, it is said, contain about two thousand-persons. The house has been open with
various successes.
Saddlers Wells Theatre, St. John's Street Road,
Islington, was originally built in the reign of Charles
II. It will contain about fifteen hundred persons.
Joe Grimaldi rendered this place very popular at
one time. Billy Williams, as he was called there, or
W. H. Williams, now with us, was an established
favorite. This house is "particularly famous for its
aquatic exhibitions, which bear some resemblance
to the naumachioe of the Romans, the whole space
beneath the stage being filled with water, and allowing a display very different from that of other
theatres."
There are, besides the theatres thus enumerated,
the Pavilion, White-chapel Road; the Garrick,
Goodman's Fields, where Garrick made his debut in
1741, in Richard the Third, before a London audience. The Clarence, King's Cross, and one or two
minor theatres of no very good repute.
<pb id="p.84" n="84">
Vauxhall Gardens are situated in the parish of
Lambeth, a short distance from Vauxhall Bridge.
The Gardens are entensive and beautiful. The
entertainments comprise a concert in two parts, a
vaudeville, some miscellaneous entertainments, and
a grand display of fireworks, intermixed with hydraulic exhibitions; and often a grand scenic display, which in the open air is much more effective
than on the stage. The Battle of Waterloo was
performed here most effectively with infantry and
cavalry, cannons, howitzers, and mortars. The
various walks in the garden are well laid; the part
intended for the grand promenade is in a blaze of
light. In other parts of the gardens, the walks are
shady or dark, in order to give effect to transparencies and scenic designs. There are also Cosmoramic views in the gardens. This delightful place
of entertainment, the most fairy-like scene that can
be imagined, which seems as though it were a page
snatched from the romance of the Arabian Nights
and made real, is not so fashionable as it was of
yore. Still it is well attended; and, beside the
witchery of the illuminated gardens themselves,
the entertainments are always excellent, and popular performers always engaged. It is of this place
<pb id="p.85" n="85">
that the story of the ham was told. The proprietors, anxiously alive to the main chance, are notorious for the thin slices of ham that they serve up to
their customers who sup there. Upon one occasion,
in hiring a carver they questioned a number of applicants as to how far they could make a ham go in
slices, meaning how many plates they could make
out of one. One man replied, "That he could
make--a ham cover the whole gardens." He was
immediately engaged.
There is also the Royal Panarmonian, Liverpool
Street, Battle Bridge; the Argyle Rooms, Regent
Street; the Hanover Square Rooms, &amp;c. &amp;c. where
public concerts, morning or evening, are occasionally given.
<pb id="p.86" n="86"><div2 type="chapter">
<head> CHAPTER VIII. <emph>Society- Order - Grades - Characteristics -
Anecdote.</></head>
<p>SOCIETY must be divided into three classes; the
higher, the middling, and the lower. There are,
however, almost innumerable sub-divisions; and
these sub-divisions, to those who take pleasure
in studying the human character, are exceedingly amusing. The manner in which those
who are down a peg or so, ape those who are
above them in their actions and modes, which
they watch with scrupulous care, is exceedingly
entertaining. But perhaps the height of the ludicrous is to see the servants of the nobility and
gentry, when off duty, imitating the actions and
manners of their masters and mistresses. This has
been so happily hit off by many of the English
popular comic writers, who have seized with a true
relish this remarkable feature, that any thing I could
say would be superfluous.
<pb id="p.87" n="87">
The higher classes of society have, in my opinion, been exposed by writers who have spoken of
them, to too sweeping and unmerited censure.
I do not consider them, on the whole, so good or so
happy as the middling classes; but their faults are
the faults of circumstance very often, and not their
own.
It is said that they are more cold and artificial than
the middling classes. It is so in reality, although a
superficial observer would come to a contrary conclusion. But if something is lost to them in this particular, something also is gained. It is well known
that the high polish of society tends to repress
much, if not all, coarseness of manner, which is so
offensive. Among the evils that it may be said
you will meet among the elite of high society, personal rudeness will never be numbered. If in high
society an honorary member, or one new to the ton,
should be introduced, and he were to maintain a position that was known to the whole company with
whom he chanced to be associated, to be incorrect, no one would dream of telling him so; the most
that would be said, would be; "Is that your opinion," or " Do you think so," or the subject would
be dropped. After all, this regard for the feelings
<pb id="p.88" n="88">
of others is a great feature in any sphere: and it
is beneficial to the best interests of society, although
it may emanate from selfishness. Nor do I think,
although in the higher classes it is to a great extent
practised with insincerity, that the two are therefore necessarily allied.
The higher classes have also been accused of
being more prone to intrigues and amours than
the middling classes. I have no doubt of this
fact, and deem it owing to the constant pleasure chase in which a great portion of them
live. Having, for the most part, no employment of any fixed or marked character, they give
way, as a matter of course, to more inordinate desires, and are more immoral.
The higher classes have been long and deservedly famed for the encouragement that they have given to professors of the arts and sciences, and to literature especially. There can be no questionbut that
this is, in many instances, owing to a refined taste,
which a liberal education and a course of reading
gives. Such persons take the truest delight in gathering men of genius around them, and real and sincere
pride in discovering the germ of talent which, under their fostering care, flourishes, which else had
<pb id="p.89" n="89">
" ----- bloomed unseen,
Wasting its sweetness on the desert air."
There can be also no doubt but that many
among the higher classes, who have no real taste for
literature whatever, afford great encouragement to
its professors, in order that they may be thought to
possess those qualifications which are not inherent
in them. It is fortunate for genius that this feeling
does exist. Literary characters, when once fairly
before the world, have the entree to the higher circles. But there is still too much distinctness, too
much pride of place on the part of the aristocracy;
too much of patronage bestowed upon those who
are of a superior order to themselves.
The system pursued in regard to pleasures and
amusements by the higher classes, is most injurious
to the health of most of those who enter its precincts, as it is to the happiness of many. A season in London lasts from February or March to
July; and the fashionable change -retirement to
watering places, or comparatively quiet life in the
country, is indeed essential to their health. A season in London is one labored round of amusements,
that soon pall upon the sense of enjoyment; and
<pb id="p.90" n="90">
pleasures, that only exits in the name. A mill-horse,
in the daily drudgery of his monotonous employment, is not more perfectly a slave to a wearisome
existence than is a votary of fashion. Night is
urned into day--day into night. When once the
season sets in, there is no interval, no relaxation,
no rest. Every night is occupied-every night engaged for parties--at homes-balls-converzationes
-operas, &amp;amp;amp;c. for months and months. Few, after
a single season, boast of the vaunted roses of merry
England. Languor and ashy paleness is the distinguishing characterestic of the fashionable belles.
Perhaps the greatest evil-the greatest cause of
unhappiness among the higher classes, is that hereditary inheritance which, while it keeps a vast
amount of wealth in the country, and so keeps up
her pride, does it at the expense of the best interests
of a large portion of her sons. This it is which
makes mothers in high life so cold, calculating, and
callous; this it is, which makes them suppress all
the softer emotions of nature, where they can do
it, in the breasts of their daughters, and instil into their minds that there is no happiness but in a
splendid establishment-no felicity unconnected
<pb id="p.91" n="91">
with pin-money; this it is that causes in high
life so much envy, hatred, and uncharitableness,
From the moment that a young lady comes out,
or is introduced to society, it is the object of her
parent to get her a good match. Into the spirit of
the chase she often enters herself with a zeal that
does full credit to her parent's instructions. To
carry on this scheme successfully, where the pretty and portionless girls so far outnumber the prizes
in the matrimonial lottery maked A. no 1. alias elder brothers, scandal is seized upon with avidity
or manufactured on purpose; and there have been
found those who would not scruple to murder the
reputation of a friend to serve the interests of a
daughter.
<p>As the London season draws to a close, it is curious to observe the eager desire to quit town, the
dread of being seen the last in it. After the last
Drawing-room--the last grand fete-the adjournment of parliament-the higher classes migrate to
the Spas, or to their country mansions, as it were
at once. In the space of a little week the West
End of the metropolis, heretofore so crowded and
animated, seems desolate and dead. Hyde Park is
tenantless. Bond Street is forlorn. Regent Street
<pb id="p.92" n="92">
is deserted. The principal houses in whole streets
and squares are shut up, and left in the charge of
one or two domestics-left on board wages. The
metamorphosis in the appearance of the town
is as complete as if effected by the wand of a harlequin ina Christmas pantomime. A stranger might
suppose that some vast mortality had carried off
one-fifth of the inhabitants of the Great Metropolis.
Of the quiet manner in which the aristocracy
sustain their dignity, two remarkable instances are
on record, the one generally well known, where,
upon an occasion, Beau Brummel desired George
the Fourth, when Prince of Wales, to ring the bell
for something that was wanted on table.
"George, ring the bell," said he.
To the astonishment of every one, the Prince
complied. The servant answered the summons.
Every eye was turned upon the Prince.
"Mr. Brummel's carriage," said the heir apparent; and the beau immediately retired.
The other instance is one in which Mr. Gunter
of Berkeley Square, a celebrated confectioner, and
especially celebrated for his ice creams, met with
a severe rebuff from the Marquis (I believe) of
Westminster.
<pb id="p.93" n="93">
The Marquis was out hunting with several of the
nobility and gentry, and Mr. Gunter, who probably
thought that his wealth put him upon a par with
any lord of them all, galloped up to the Marquis,
and endeavored to open a conversation with him.
" Excuse me, my lord," said he, "my horse is so
fiery."
"Ice him, Mr. Gunter, ice him," was the reply.
It is said that Mr. Gunter fell back as if he had
been shot, notwithstanding the mettle of his horse.
In the middling classes of society there is much
more happiness than in any other. They are removed from the real wants of the lower classes,
from the imaginary wants of the upper. Theirs is
the happy medium. The virtues of our nature
have therefore more time to take root, expand, and
flourish. Here no fierce tide of fashion enervates
the females who are exposed to it, robs them of
their bloom, impairs their constitution and saps their
life. Here no scheming mother finds it incumbent
on herself to get her daughter off the first or second
season, lest she should be considered passe and
unmarketable; and if the aspirations of some of
the ambitious vain will tempt them to ape that
distinction, whose crown is encircled with thorns,
<pb id="p.94" n="94">
the instances are comparatively few. There is,
consequently, more sincerity, more candor, more
of heart, and calm and holy feeling in the middling
than the upper classes.
<p>The lower classes of the Great Metropolis are as
bad as the lower classes of any metropolis can be;
they are, perhaps, more depraved, more dissolute
than any other. Drunkenness is a vice practised
to an unparalleled extent in the community. A
stranger will be struck with astonishment at the
number of drunken persons he will meet in the
metropolis; nor less so at the superb edifices that
are raised by the proceeds of those who indulge in
this darling vice, and by their voluntary contribution. These are called Gin Palaces. First, because the chief spirit, the favorite liquor of the lower orders is Gin; and secondly, because the edifices
in their fitting up resemble palaces in their costliness and grandeur. Had Hogarth lived in the present era, he would have improved upon his celebrated picture. The contrast between the magnificent
structure and the squalid and ragged misery which
supports such grandeur by its own ruin, is a picture
which was not of his time. The contrast is startling to a degree. These houses open at a very ear<pb id="p.95" n="95">
ly hour in the morning, and they do more business
between the hours of four and eight A. M. than in
all the rest of the day. This will show that the
class of which I speak is of the very lowest order.
Another startling point to an American is the sight
of women going into these places, which they do
for their quarten as commonly as the men. There
is one door in High Street on which I remember
seeing painted, "Ladies' door, full proof spirits."
Beer is also a very favorite beverage with the
lower orders, and vast quantities are consumed by
both the lower and middle classes. The lower orders are fond of attending at public houses in the
evening, where they form little clubs, and meet their
companions with much regularity. They usually
take their pipe and pint measure, and both are
pretty frequently replenished before the time fixed
for the closing of all public houses by Act of Parliament. The time is eleven o'clock. The room
where these worthies meet is called the <soCalled>Tap
Room.</soCalled> In almost every public house there is a
better room, called the "Parlor." The Tap Room
is partitioned off into plain wooden boxes, in each
of which there is a table of common material. The
walls are often whitewashed merely, and the only
<pb id="p.96" n="96">
ornament is aboard, on which is painted, in characters not to be mistaken, "No Trust," or "All liquors
to be paid for on delivery," &amp;c. The parlor is
fitted up with good chairs and mahogany tables.
Here some of the middle classes, although very few
in comparison with the lower order who patronize
the Tap Room, congregate. They usually play at
drafts, and drink brandy and water, rum and water,
orgin and water, hot. The two latter mixtures are
sold at six pence, and the former at one shilling a
glass; not more than two or three are drank in the
evening; and it is not a common practice, except
with the lower orders, to drink in the day-time. It
would injure a young man's character and standing in London, if it were known that he frequented
a public house.
<p>In England the great distinctiveness of the various classes of society tends to render the various
orders marked; while with us, the wholesome admixture of each with each, if it militates from the
refinement that is carried to a nice point in the old
country, also preserves us from its extreme, which
is there too palpable. It is rarely in England, unless by great merit, great zeal and industry, or
great luck, and generally not without them all com<pb id="p.97" n="97">
bined, that a person steps out of the station in
which he was born.
<p>Of the three classes, then, it will appear that the
middle class is the best. It is, in fact, the heart of
society. It regulates the others. It has neither
the follies of the higher, nor the depravities of the
lower orders; it has more home ties and social feeling.
The word Home is indeed only comprehended
and felt by the middle order. It has a home, a family circle, a gathering together within a charmed
circle, into which, generally speaking, the virtuous
and deserving are alone admitted.</p>

<head> CHAPTER IX.<emph>The Press--Cash and Credit Systems.</emph></head>
<p>THE Press in London is entitled to high consideration on account of the influence that it has
with the community. This is owing to the admirable system upon which it is conducted, altogether
so different to ours that I must mention it particularly.
<p>A London paper, daily or weekly, supplies no
individual subscriber, and does not know who its
subscribers are. The whole business of supplying
the town with the Journals is performed by persons
called Newsmen, who act somewhat upon the
principle of the carriers to the cash newspapers
in the city of New-York. The difference being,
that the newspaper proprietor has nothing to do
with the particular route that each newsman may
take, but serves each with as many papers as they
may pay for, who again serve them wherever their
<pb id="p.99" n="99">
customers may be. The business of a newsman
is usually combined with that of a Bookseller and
Stationer. When so," Newspaper Office" is printed upon the outside of his shop and on his cards.
These Stationers employ again other carriers to
serve their customers, sending in their bills usually
once in three months. Themselves have to pay
at the publication offices, cash as they get the papers.
At an early hour in the morning, before daylight,
at the publication office of each of the morning papers, which are situated principally in the Strand
and its vicinity, the newsmen and newsboys assemble to get their papers, all anxious to be the
first to supply their customers. They get them, and
start off; and thus the metropolis is served in a very
short space of time by each newsman in his own
vicinity.
<p>In respect to advertisements, few persons take
them to the newspaper offices themselves. The
general plan is to give them to the newsmen to
take down, who generally charge their customers
six pence commission for their trouble.
The great advantage of this plan is, first, that a
paper is freed from the trouble and annoyance to
<pb id="p.100" n="100">
which papers are here subjected, and, secondly,
they are more independent.
They do not look to subscribers for their pay; they
know nothing of their subscribers. Consequently
they have no losses, and are never under the necessity of publishing a card, stating that if their
subscribers do not cash up, they shall be obliged to
stop; nor are they ever under the disagreeable necessity of stopping, as has been done here too often,
in consequence of their subscribers' remissness.
They are all paid cash in advance, or rather upon
the delivery of their papers; and so know exactly
upon what footing they stand.
In regard to advertisements, it is the same; all
insertions are paid for before they appear, and every insertion, even of the same advertisement, pays
the same price. One great advantage in this ready
money system is, that there are no interminable
accounts to keep, no bad debts to be put to profit
and loss account in striking a balance.
Nor is this all; the publisher of a paper is not
merely richer, he is more independent. He sees
no subscriber or advertiser, he knows none. He is
therefore never insulted by being told, that unless
he pursues a certain policy, he will lose the cus<pb id="p.101" n="101">
tom of a class of readers who have patronized his
paper. Thus untrammeled, by the opinions of
others forced upon him through his pocket, where
it is most senstively felt, he pours forth his
thoughts freely and unrestrained; and he eschews
half measures, and brings forward no abortive
schemes, rendered so by the officious folly of his
customers.
The papers that pursue the cash system here approach more nearly to the London plan than any
other. They differ, however, in one very material
point-they are at the mercy, in a great measure,
of their carriers, which the London Press can
never be. In the first place it would impossible for
all the newsmen of London to unite to dictate
upon what terms they would take the papers of the
publishers; and in the second place, they being all,
or nearly so, of standing and character, such a
step would injure their reputation. Here the carries can and do combine to get newspapers of publishers at their own price. The carriers here made
a stand against the Herald, to get it at their own
price, and refused to take it for some time at a fair
remuneration. They at length were obliged to
fall into terms. They succeeded more to their own
<pb id="p.102" n="102">
wishes with a paper that was started here called
"the Morning Chronicle," got up in part on the
London plan. When it first came out, they proposed to take it up if the proprietors would let them
have it for half price; so that the proprietors
were to be at the expense of editors, sub-editors,
law and commercial reporters, clerks, compositers, office rent, paper, press-work, &amp;c.; and divide
the sale price with them before they would condescend to sell it. The proprietors found that they
should lose by the operation, and refused. The
carriers would not take the papers. The consequence was, that not being able to contend with
such an unexpected obstacle, the proprietors became
disheartened, and stopped the paper, after having
incurred some considerable expense upon it.
The carriers made it their boast that they put
down a weekly paper called "the World," published for some time here, because the proprietor would
not accede to their terms; and they conspired
against the Sunday Morning Atlas, now publishing
in this city, for the same reason, but without success; and they have since found it to their interest
to come to the proprietors' terms.
There can be no question of the advantage of
<pb id="p.103" n="103">
the London System over ours, when publishers
here are so much at the mercy or at the caprice of
the rogues or fools with whom they are bound up.
The London press is famous for the mass of
fail information that it contains on all the topics of
the day. This is again owing to their cash system,
which works admirably in every particular. It
enables the proprietors of papers to mature their
plans, and to secure first-rate talent in every particular, to whom proper compensation is paid. The
price paid for intellectual and manual labor on a
leading daily Journal per week, has been estimated
at $1,500; independently of duties or stamps, and
advertisements, for which the Times, by its own
statement, paid $340,685 in a year. Could the London papers have ever arrived at their present perfection, which makes them what they profess to be,
News-papers, if they had pursued our plan? Certainly not. And could not our papers do as much
with the same facilities? There can be no question
of it.
If the enormous sums that are lost yearly on subscriptions and advertisements were thrown into
the establishments, newspapers would not merely,
as now, have to struggle for existence; but would
<pb id="p.104" n="104">
at once burst the fetters in which they are bound,
and give to the world a newspaper worthy the
name.
Upon the present system with us the wonder is
not, that, as newspapers, ourjournals are deficient,
but that they contain so much local intelligence as
they do.
There are frequently open in this city eight
courts at a time, viz. the <placeName>Superior Court</>, the <placeName>Circuit Court</>, the <placeName>Court of Common Pleas</>, the United States District Court, the Court of General or
Special Sessions, the Lower Police Court, the Upper Police Court, and the Marine Court. In these
Courts important trials are constantly taking place,
involving the commercial interests of this great
emporium; and points of law, opinions and judgments, highly valuable to merchants and others, affording them a guide to the proper management of
their business, laid down. It is most important,
then, that in commercial papers these proceedings
should be faithfully reported.
How many reporters do the community suppose
are engaged by the leading journals, as they are
called, in this city, to attend to this mass of business,
besides such other business as may transpire at the
<pb id="p.105" n="105">
Mayor's and other offices, and attend the Board of
Aldermen and Public Meetings, and gather local
intelligence? ONE! The Courier and Inquirer
employs one reporter, the Journal of Commerce
one; no paper employs more, and the Gazette does
not employ any at all. One reporter has to do the
whole, or as much of it as he can, and leave the
rest undone. Is this sufficient for a city of the
magnitude of New York? How much that is important and valuable must of necessity be omitted ?
Nor are the reporters paid adequately for their
services; the highest salary paidto a reporter in this
city is $20 per week, while some have only $10
for the performance of their fatiguing and onerous
duties. The consequence is, that reporters, as a
body, are not possessed of that high talent and acquirements which in other places is considered indispensable. There are among the number, gentlemen of high acquirements; but this is rather from
circumstance than choice, for no man of talent or
genius would submit to the drudgery of a report
ter's life in this city, if any other prospect opened
before him. Thus, then, there are many men who
become reporters who have neither talent nor acquirements; and it is this mixture which frequent<pb id="p.106" n="106">
ly is the cause of reporters being treated with less
of that respect and consideration than that to
which they are, or should be, entitled. Still this
is not in many instances the fault of the proprietors
of newspapers; they cannot afford to give more.
It is the fault of the system, and the sooner it is
done away with, the better.
<p>If the proprietors of the various Newspapers were
to hold a convention, and resolve to sell their journals
only for cash, and to charge cash for all their advertisements, they would very speedily find the benefit of it. We must have newspapers. We are
a reading community. We should then give cash
where we take credit. Our merchants must advertise their goods and consignments, they would
then pay cash. No bad debts would then be incurred; no hundreds and thousands, and in the
course of time, tens and hundreds of thousands of
unavailable indebtedness would stare an unfortunate proprietor in the face; nor would he be, as
many have been, ruined with a fortune upon his
books.
<p>Even on the supposition, altogether impossible,
that the yearly advertisers to our newspapers paid
their obligations, proprietors would be great gainers.
<pb id="p.107" n="107">
Yearly advertisements often do not pay the price
of the composition of their advertisements. I saw
one instance tested, in which the proprietor of a
newspaper paid one third more to his compositors
for setting up a merchant's advertisements, contracted for by the year, as is customary here, than
the contract amounted to. He had to pay his compositors weekly for their labor, while he received
his contract half-yearly. The time will and must
come when this system will be abandoned, and the
sooner for the interest of newspaper proprietors,
the better.
<p>Independently of the number of hands regularly
employed in the London papers, they also pay by
the line for any local intelligence that may be
brought, at the rate of three half-pence per line; so
that scarcely any item of information escapes the
press.
<p>The London Press is also famous for its criticisms on new publications and on theatricals;
for these persons are specially engaged. It is,
however, useless to dwell upon the minutiae. The
arrangement of the various parts, the distinctiveness of each, and the perfection of the whole, arises
out of the Cash System exclusively.</p></div2>

<head>CHAPTER X.<emph>Fashionable parties, the ease with which they
are managed-The love of exclusiveness, the
impossibility of preserving it-A laughable
instance - Public Sights - Fetes- Dinners,
&amp;c.- The Opera--Mixed company-Patronized concerts.</emph></head>
<p>
<p>DURING the season, the limits of which I have
already mentioned, there is in the fashionable world
a constant round of parties, dinners, balls, routs,
&amp;amp;amp;c. The Morning Post is a faithful record of the
chief doings of the fashionable world, and records
the most important movements. From that some
idea may be formed of the extent to which this
practice is carried.
<p>The great ease with which grand entertainments
may be got up, is another reason for their frequent
occurrence. Does a fashionable gentleman wish
to give a dinner party; he sends to Gunter, or some
other professor of gastronomy, and tells him to provide<pb id="p.109" n="109">
 a splendid entertainment for a given number
of persons, to have every thing in and out of season, and to see that every thing is recherche in the
extreme. He has then no further trouble. Gunter
takes the whole direction; provides waiters, attendants, plate if it be necessary, in short, every thing.
So in respect to suppers and balls. Is it the intention of the proprietors to make their apartments
resemble green rooms ? choice shrubs and exotics
arebrought; the place is decorated; the supper table
is set out with plate, china, glass, and edibles; rout
chairs are provided, all at a given expense; and the
day after the rout or ball has been given, these ornaments and relics are taken away by the persons
who provided them, and the house restored to its
usual appearance probably while the proprietors are
sleeping from the effects of fatigue, not excitement;
that is a word professed to be unknown in the higher classes.
There is no trait more remarkable of those
moving in high life than their efforts to preserve an
exclusiveness. While their manner is perhaps remarkable for its politeness and urbanity to those
in an inferior station in their casual and worldly
intercourse, it is utterly repulsive, if those beneath
<pb id="p.110" n="110">
them, in the artificial scale of too nice refinement,
attempt to enter their magical circle.
An intelligent farmer, speaking of his rich landed
proprietor, will far more often than otherwise have
to mention his courtesy, kindness, gentlemanly deportment and absence of all pride; but let that
farmer, from wealth orwhat not, casually meet the
landed proprietor in town, at the Opera, or at a
public and intended to be exclusive party, and he
will find himself de-trop instantly; so with any
one who has once bore the plebeian title of tradesman. An ingenious mechanic, whose fertile and
vivid imagination carrying him into the heart of
science, has brought forth some glorious invention,
which, bringing from chaos he may be said to have
created, may engross the attention of one of the
elite, who will take a most marked interest in the
progress of his invention, in assisting to bring it to
maturity, by that golden medium, so very essential
to poor experimentalists; but the mechanic must
keep his place, he must not presume; should he attempt to approach the magical circle, his former
friend turns his back upon him. He is a MECHANIC, and in that title pre-eminently superior to the
whole race of ephemeral beings, who profess to
<pb id="p.111" n="111">
look down upon him, and whose whole existence
is for the most part a compound of pride, folly, and
extravagance.
<p>It nevertheless happens that the magical circle
is not kept inviolate, and that it is frequently passed
by the plebeian. In fact, it is a matter of impossibility to preserve any thing like exclusiveness. A
bold adventurer-and there are many in the great
metropolis-or an expert rogue, and there are many
of this genus also, knows how to play his cards,
and to prey upon this high-blown greatness. He
has many facilities. First and foremost, the servants, who of necessity are acquainted with most
of the movements of their masters and mistresses
are at his command. He sucks their secrets out of
the coachman at the pot-house, where he takes his
ale, or he gleans them of the footman, not in <foreign lang=la>propria personae</foreign>, but in an indirect manner, by that
golden medium which is in general a passport to
the confidence of domestics. So venal are servants in large families, in addition to their love
of blabbing those family matters which should
be kept sacred by them, that there are generally in
the houses of public characters some false servants in the pay of the gossip-loving and slander<pb id="p.112" n="112">
ing and slanderous prints of the day. The adventurer or rogue becoming acquainted thus with
the secrets of persons in high life, turns them to
his own account.
<p>A laughable instance is told of the success of
an adventurer, at least to a certain extent. He understood that the husband and wife of a family of
distinction were not upon speaking terms. He determined accordingly to patronize the family by attending their balls, routs, &amp;c. The way he gained
admission, was to watch the arrival of a carriage at
the door of the house. When the steps were let
down and the visitors alighted, he followed close in
their wake, and on their names being announced,
bowed on his entree as though he were one of the
party. He knew that it was questionable whether
he should be noticed at all by the noble host and
hostess, and if he were, he felt perfectly assured
that each would think he came by the other's invitation. In this manner, for nearly a whole season,
having thus obtained the entree into society, he mixed in fashionable company. His object was to get
a rich wife, and he nearly accomplished it, when
he was accidentally discovered. A lady, whose
daughter's hand he had solicited for the quadrille
<pb id="p.113" n="113">
being one of the particulars, asked the host who he
was; the host knew nothing of the matter. The
lady asked the hostess-the hostess knew nothing
of the matter. There was evidently something
wrong. The host spoke to the adventurer, and
asked him whether he had come by invitation.
The adventurer, perfectly on his guard, said he had
not; but that he could explain the reason of his
presence entirely to the satisfaction of his lordship,
and he would call on the following morning and
do so. Such is the horror of any thing bordering
upon what is called a scene in high life, that the
fellow was suffered to depart. It is needless to say,
that on the morrow he did not appear. The affair
made considerable noise at the time, as the adventurer had mixed a great deal in society, and had become known to many.
If, in what is termed private society it is difficult
to preserve exclusiveness, in public it is altogether
out of the question. Public fetes, dinners, balls,
&amp;c. where it is given out exclusiveness will be preserved, are alike open to plebeian and patrician, to
the lordly and to the low. If tickets are issued,
they are sure to find their way by some means into
the hands of sheriffs' officers, who, from their connec<pb id="p.114" n="114">
tion with spendthrift sprigs of fashion, play no
inconsiderable part in life in London, and are by
them disseminated among their friends, the Jews,
or sold to the public. Jews in London are exceedingly fond of sights, and there is no public entertainment-how costly soever, at which they are not
seen. They have a passion for the Opera, which
they attend easily. They have some of the principal persons in that establishment.; such as L-e- E-s, M-k M-n, &amp;amp;amp;c. so often in their power,
that they have no difficulty in obtaining orders
to a great extent.
<p>The rage for mixing in fashionable company is
sometimes turned to good account. A gentleman
will occasionally suffer a popular singer to give a
concert at his house. On such occasions he usually provides refreshments. The announcement of
a concert at the house of a fashionable gentleman
is however in itself sufficient. Tickets are sure to
be sold for as many persons as his rooms willhold;
they are sold at half a guinea each, and thus the
vanity that prompts many to go for the sake of saying they have spent an evening in society that they
could not otherwise approach, fills the pockets of
the singer.
<pb id="p.115" n="115">
<p>Among the entertainments in high life, private
concerts are extremely fashionable; and the chief
artists of the Italian Opera are in high requisition,
often singing at two parties in one evening; of
course on the night not devoted to the Opera. For
this they are paid with great liberality; and the
money thus made by such vocalists as Grisi, Rubini, Tamburini, Lablache, &amp;c. is almost incredible.
They may well return home, as several artistes have
done, and marry princes; for they take with them
a princely revenue.

CHAPTER XI.Curious facts, not elsewhere noticed in this
work.</head>
<p>No. 18 Aldermansbury, was formerly the residence of the infamous Judge Jefferies.
<p>In Aldersgate Street, on No. 116, is a tablet stating that two incendiaries were executed here on
the 20th November, 1790, for having set fire to several houses on the 16th Mayinthatyear. Formerly the Half Moon Tavern, which was much frequented by the wits of Charles II., stood in this
street.
<p>The street called Austin Friars, was so named
after the Augustines. Their church still remains,
now used by the Dutch.
<p>At No. 68 Baker Street, Portman Square, Mr.
Gratton, the Irish orator, died, June, 1820.
<p>No. 33 Cock Lane, West Smithfield, is famous
as having been the site where the deceptions of a
<pb id="p.117" n="117">

<p>At No. 53 Fenchurch Street is the King's Head Tavern. There the princess (afterwards Queen)
Elizabeth dined upon pork and pease upon her liberation from the Tower. It would not be considered
a very royal dish in this age; but in those days,
<pb id="p.118" n="118">
when the maids of honor made a hearty breakfast
on beefsteaks and porter, taste was not so refined.
The dish in which the said pork and pease was
served up, is still preserved in the coffee-room,
together with the portrait of the royal guest.
<p>The Fortune of War, public house, in Giltspur
Street, is built on the spot where the great fire of
London terminated. Formerly the unwieldly

inscribed, "This boy is put up in memory of the
great fire of London, occasioned by the sin of gluttony, 1666."
<p>Great Eastcheap is celebrated by England's immortal bard. On No. 2 is a sculptured boar's head,
bearing date 1668. On this site stood Dame

Henry V., and his roystering companions. At No.
12 Miles Lane a tobacco box is carefully preserved,
on the lid of which is a painting of this celebrated
tavern. It brings quite a revenue to the house;
such spell is thrown by Genius over things inthemselves worthless.

Stowe, this great courtier committed an act of oppression which does not reflect to his credit. " This
house," he remarks, "being furnished, and having
some reasonable plot of ground left for a garden, he
caused the pales of the garden adjoining to the
north part thereof on a sudden to be taken down;
<pb id="p.122" n="122">
twenty-two feet to be measured directly into the
north of every man's ground, a line then to be drawn,
a trench to be cut, a foundation laid, and a high
brick wall to be built. My father had agarden there,
and a house standing close to his south pales; this
house they loosed from the ground, and carried on
rollers into my father's garden twenty-two feet, before my father heard thereof. No warning was
given; nor any other answer, when he heard thereof and spoke to the surveyors of that work, but that
their master, Sir Thomas, commanded them to do
so. No man durst go to argue the matter, and my
father lost the land; and my father paid his whole
rent, which was six shillings and eight pence a year,
for that half which was left. And so much of my
own knowledge have I thought good to note, that
the sudden rising of some men causeth them to
forget themselves."</p></div1>

CHAPTER I.<emph>
Families - Lodgings - Facilities - Manage-

Puss- Curious Statistics.</emph></head>
<p>
PERSONS with families rarely find accommodation
for boarding in London; I mean those in middling
or somewhat straitened circumstances. Almost
every advertisement in the newspapers for board
is addressed to single gentlemen, or to elderly gentlemen, or to single ladies or to elderly ladies, or,
peradventure to a man and his wife without incumbrances (what a name for pledges of affection); but
rarely, or never, to families. It is not dreamed of.
Almost every couple in London is expected to take
unto itself apartments. Well then, "when in
<pb id="p.126" n="126">
Rome," &amp;c. saith a proverb. We must act upon
it.
<p>Apartments may be had in almost any part of
London, either furnished or unfurnished, at almost
any price, according to the situation. They are generally let in floors. Thus," A first floor and kitchen
to let," will greet your eyes as you pass along the
streets, printed or written upon paper, and pasted
to the window of the rooms to be disposed of; or,
"A second floor to let, with use of a kitchen," or not,
as it may be.
<p>It often happens that a house will be thus let in
floors throughout, and the inmates of each in some
instances remain total strangers to each other. But
they are much more often upon terms of acquaintanceship or intimacy. Unless some austere being
has taken a suite of apartments, it is somewhat
difficult for persons, who must of necessity meet
each other often at the street door, and pass each
other continually on the stairs, to abstain from forming some acquaintance. The common expressions
of "wet day," "drizzly weather," "warm," "hot,"
"chilly or cold," gradually grow into sentences;
and thus friendships are cemented, which are some<pb id="p.127" n="127">
times all enduring, between those who are casually
thrown together.
<p>When this familiar footing is established, invitations are formally given and accepted. The second floor is invited to dine with the first, or the
first is requested to do the second the honor of a
visit, to a dish of tea and chat; and thus business,
pleasure, visiting, and parties take place within the
four walls of a single house, a world within itself,
to an extent that would scarcely be credited by those
unacquainted with the fact. I knew a gentleman
who lodged in the second floor of a house in London, who humorously told me of the first floor's giving a grand party, to which it invited all his spoons,
knives and forks, together with sundry articles of
furniture, but not himself. Afterwards it gave
another party, to which it invited him without the
moveables. But it may happen that the first floor,
that being considered the post of honor in a house,
and of course the most expensive, may be occupied
by lodgers who are proud; then, not unfrequently
they will consider themselves the best people in
the place, and either not condescend to notice the
poor creatures whose circumstances place them a
floor higher in the world than themselves, or else
<pb id="p.128" n="128">
do it with a patronizing sort of an air, that shall
proclaim at the same time their superiority and condescension.
<p>But enough of the discursive.
<p>You are a family man. "Zounds," you exclaim,
"I am not a family man." But, my dear sir, you
must be a family man, or I can't get on with my
description. Pursuant to the recommendation of
this little book, you have taken apartments, either
furnished or unfurnished, as best suits your convenience. You now commence 'housekeeping,' as
the phrase goes--oom-keeping would be as appropriate-but no matter; you will find a great many
facilities. At first the London Cries will sound discordantly on your ears, and you will wonder that
the corporations or select vestries of the various
parishes suffer such a hubbub to be kicked up by
the itinerant merchants, anxious to dispose of their
wares. But you will soon, in the accommodation
afforded by this class of the community, pardon the
noise you at first contemned, and think it, especially if you have no servant, an excellent arrangement.
<p>Every kind of fruit and vegetable is daily hawked
through the streets, carried either in small carts or
<pb id="p.129" n="129">
wheelbarrows, so that for these articles you only
need go to the door to be supplied. There are
many of these itinerant dealers, who have a regular set of customers, and do a good business; they
being enabled to sell at a cheaper rate than shopkeepers, who have rent and taxes to pay.
<p>But it is not necessary to deal with the barrow-women; for, not only are there an abundant quantity of markets in every part of the metropolis, but
also are there in almost all streets not devoted exclusively to private dwellings, store or shop-keepers, as they are called, for all and every kind of
edible.
<p>Butchers' shops are to be seen in almost every
street, and if their appearance is to us strange or
displeasing, we must at least allow that their accommodation is great. The manner in which
these are generally kept, reflects the highest credit
on their owners. The counters of the shops are in
many instances, in most instances at the West End
of the town, covered with cloths of spotless whiteness, and the floors carefully strewn with saw-dust.
The butcher is as cleanly in his own person.
His apron is of spotless whiteness, as are the
sleeves, which he draws over his coat to the elbows.
<pb id="p.130" n="130">
At certain periods of the year, Christmas more especially, butchers' shops are set off with great care,
and crowds are attracted to see the <soCalled>meat shows,</soCalled>
as the exhibitions are called. There is a butcher's
shop in Bond Street, and its appearance detracts
nothing from the appearance of that fashionable
quarter. It is kept exceedingly neat, and the meat
forms a pleasing and tempting exhibition rather
than an eye-sore. There are, besides, in Bond
Street, fish-mongers, poulterers, green-grocers, and
shops of every description.
<p>Independently of the itinerant merchants, to
whom I have alluded, there are a number of tradespeople, who call upon their customers regularly for
orders, even down to that humble individual the
Pot-Boy, who calls upon you from some neighboring public-house with your half-pint, pint, or pot
(quart) of beer, as you may order.
<p>The London Pot-boy is an important character,
and it may be worth while, now that he is under
notice, to give a description of him and his avocations. He is a being called into existence by the
penchant or passion of the middling and lower
classes of London for porter; and he lives and
moves in a great measure for their accommodation.
<pb id="p.131" n="131">
It often happens that a pot-boy is taken into a public-house when his age entitles him to that appellation, but he retains his name with his place when
the thick black stubble, which shoots from between
his nose and upper lip, and on his chin and neck,
proclaims any thing but juvenility. His duties are
multitudinous. He is one of the first persons up
in the establishment to which he belongs; one of
the last to retire to rest. He commences his day's
work by sweeping out the bar, and putting it in order. He next performs the same duties to the taproom, where the lower order of customers have
congregated the evening previously. If it be winter, he lights a fire in each of these places; he then
sweeps out and arranges the parlor, where the
higher order of public-house customers have congregated the night before; and if there has been any
meeting in the large, or club room, he performs the
same functions there. He then cleans boots and
shoes, knives and forks, and commences his most
legitimate employment, the cleaning of the pewter
pots-quarts, pints, and half-pints; the porter being
almost invariably served and drank out of the
pewter. These are under his especial charge.
Every day they must be scoured with sand and
<pb id="p.132" n="132">
water, and polished until they present as close an
imitation to silver as the material will admit. Engaged in this work, he whistles to beguile the time.
Whistling seems as essential to the performance
of the labors of a pot-boy, as grunting to a paviour or hissing to a hostler when at work. His
work now completed, the shining metal is brought
into the bar. It is mid-day, the time at which a
great portion of the population of the metropolis
rest from their labors and refresh themselves.
They look anxiously for their pot-boy. He does
not disappoint them. With two huge upright trays,
formed of two shelves, and protected from the weather, in which are arranged the family of the pots the aforesaid quarts, pints, and half-pints-he sallies
forth from head-quarters, shouting, with full voice,
"Beer," "Beer;" which single syllable he converts
into two for the sake of prolonging the song. At
his well-known voice his customers open their
doors, not to keep him waiting; and he delivers
their modicum, and proceeds on his destination.
At a late hour of the day he sallies forth with a
long leathern strap. He now exchanges his cry of
"Beer," for the cry of "Pots," "Pots;" and again
his customers appear with the empty measures.
<pb id="p.133" n="133">
Those who are considerate, and know how to appreciate the invaluable time of a pot-boy, forestall
him by placing their pots on the iron railing of their
domiciles, from whence he takes them. These
pots are often stolen, to prevent which, or to tend
to detection, the name of the proprietor, together
with the name of his public-house, is engraved on
each. All these pots the boy takes, and, drawing
one end of his leathern strap through their handles,
swings them over his back, and returns home with
his burthen.
<p>To some of his regular customers the pot-boy
lends the paper taken in at the public-house-the
<soCalled>Tap-Tub,</soCalled> as the "Morning Advertiser," the
licensed victuallers' paper, taken by nearly all public-houses, is called. This is not, however, until it is
a day or two old.
<p>With the old ladies the pot-boy is a prodigious
favorite. He is to them what the Spanish barber
is to his customers-the man of news. To him
they look for the movements of the town; for the
dreadful accidents-the inhuman outrages-the
acts of violence-the suicides, the bloody murders,
the dreadful executions, that have taken place. It
is necessary; for, as they do not get their paper
<pb id="p.134" n="134">
till it is antiquated, the news would otherwise be
dreadfully stale, worse than their beer. It is therefore absolutely necessary that he should make himself master of the contents of the "Tap-Tub" before setting out, to feed the craving desires of his
old ladies.
<p>The papers that he thus carries out, he transfers
from one to another of his customers, until they
are probably a week old. He has now to return
home; it is evening, and his post is to attend
to the tap-room, keep up the fire, look out for orders,
and see to the taking of the money for the same.
About eight or nine o'clock he leaves this post to
carry out the supper beer of his regular customers,
and then returns to the tap-room, until the house
closes; when his multitudinous labors being ended,
he retires to rest. Rest hardly earned.
<p>There is another great accommodation in what
are called "Cook-shops." They are generally a
part and portion of the London eating-houses.
But it is not necessary to go there to eat. At certain hours of the day, generally from twelve to three
o'clock, joints of every description are served up,
and sold by the pound, half-pound, quarter, or two
ounces, as may be required. Thus, when it is in<pb id="p.135" n="135">
convenient for lodgers to cook, they can send a
basin, or dish and plate, and be accommodated with
dinner to any extent they please. Hot or cold,
roast or boiled meats, are sold at about eight pence
sterling a pound, and ham at one shilling: potatoes
or other vegetables, and pudding of all descriptions,
are sold in pennyworths.
<p>This description will give you some idea how
you <emph>may</> live in London.
<p>There is one thing that I forgot to mention. It
is, that your cat, if you keep a Grimalkin, will be
waited upon as well and regularly as yourselves.
All horses that drop down dead in the streets, or,
in a literal phrase, have not a leg to stand upon-for
horses in London are barbarously worn to the
last, despite the humane exertions of the late member for Galway, Mr. Martin*<NOTE place=foot>*Mr. Martin introduced a bill into parliament for the
prevention of cruelty to animals-which, being passed,
he himself caused many convictions to be made upon
it. For this the jesters of the day showed more wit
than wisdom in ridiculing the honorable and humane
member for his efforts, which, they insisted, was-from a
<soCalled>fellow-feeling</soCalled> for the donkeys. In one caricature they
represented him with an ass's head addressing a meeting of asses thus-- "My brethren, I have been ass-persed, ass-aulted, and threatened to be ass-assinated."</NOTE>-are bought for some
<pb id="p.136" n="136">
trifle by persons called <soCalled>knackers,</> who supply the
town wholesale with this cat's provender. The
horse-flesh is boiled, and carried through the streets
in little carts or barrows, drawn often by a dog; and
the meat is sold generally in half-penny worths,
through each of which a skewer is stuck, that it
may be handled. If not expressed, it is understood
that a cat, in taking up her quarters in a family, is
to be allowed a halfpenny's worth of meat per diem,
besides a portion of milk, and such stray bones of
meat and fish as may come from the table after the repast, independently of the game, in the shape of rats
and mice, which she may secure on her own account.
Also, that it is to have no followers-an item rarely observed by grimalkin. It is curious, very curious, to see the cats, when their <soCalled>man</soCalled> comes
through the street in which they reside. No sooner has he uttered his cry, " Ca'me, ca'me," which,
translated, means "cat's meat, cat's meat," than
every puss upon whom a door does not chance to be
shut, rushes up the area steps to the gate, and waits,
purring with back and tail up, until she receives
her supply. There will be probably two or three
c at's meat men pass through a street in the
course of the day; but the cats know well the
<pb id="p.137" n="137">
voice of their own "man," and only to that do they
evince any emotion.
There being scarcely a house in London that
does not upon an average take its halfpenny worth
regularly per diem; in many instances where there
are lodgers-and lodgers keep cats-several halfpennys worth are taken regularly; it will be seen that a
considerable trade is carried on in this seemingly
unimportant business. Putting the number of
houses at 250,000, which is below the mark, and
averaging only one cat to each house that receives
this stipend, you have a daily expenditure of &pound;528
16d. 8s. amounting yearly to &pound;190,104 3s. 4d. or
in round numbers to $950,000.

<head>CHAPTER II.<head> <p>
<emph>Bachelors-Board and Lodging-Dress-
Eating-houses- Coffee-houses- Chop-houses.</emph>
<p>
ARE you a bachelor, and in straitened circumstances ? You may live with respectability on &pound;50
per annum. It must be by boarding in a private
family. In London there are many families struggling for a living, persons of respectability, small
tradesmen and others, to whom one additional member would be of slight consideration, while the payment that he would make would be of real importance to them. But although, to keep up appearances, such families would gladly sacrifice a
room to a stranger, their pride, or the fear of the
world's comments, would, in nine cases out of ten,
if not ninety-nine out of a hundred, prevent them
from seeking, at least publicly, a boarder. You
must then seek that which will be a mutual accommodation to you both. You must advertise. The
<pb id="p.139" n="139">
Times, Herald, Chronicle, or Advertiser, will be
the best papers to advertise in. One will be sufficient; and the Times, unless your advertisement
should be lost in a double sheet, the most desirable.
You will in all probability receive plenty of answers,
and you will then have to select that you like best;
and will be enabled to get the accommodation that
you seek at 10s. 6d. per week, or &pound;26 per annum.
The next item of expenditure that will call for
your particular attention, will be DRESS. Here you
will have no difficulty. By glancing your eye over
the newspapers, you will find many tailors-they
are not called merchant tailors, however high their
standing-who advertise to furnish you with superfine clothes, two suits, at 10 per annum. Thus
you are boarded and lodged in a private family, and
provided with two suits of clothes a year, for &pound;36.
You have then left &pound;14 for other expenses and
pleasures.
But your income may not warrant such rigid
economy, and it may be inconvenient for you to
dine at stated hours. In that case you had better
merely hire one room, a sleeping apartment furnished, which, with every requisite attention, you
may get for from three to five shillings per week
<pb id="p.140" n="140">
Your most economical plan in such instance will
be to breakfast and take tea at a coffee-house, and
dine at an eating-house.
Coffee-houses form an important part of the social system of London. They are fitted up, many
of them, in a style of great splendor. They afford
great facilities to their visitors or customers, and,
what is most important, at an exceedingly low rate.
You take breakfast at any sum you please, from
three half-pence, which will procure you a large
breakfast cup of coffee, and you will be enabled to
read the morning papers. Coffee-houses, generally speaking, unless of a low order, take in all the
.city papers, the weekly periodicals, and the monthly magazines and reviews; several take also the
French papers, and some of them have a small
library in the coffee-room.
The coffee-house visitors are usually of two or
ders-those who go there in the morning for breakfast solely, and those who go there of an evening,
perhaps chiefly for an intellectual repast. In former times, when coffee-houses were not on so extended a scale as now, but small and compact, they
were the resort of a class of politicians called, from
this circumstance, Coffee-house politicians. They
<pb id="p.141" n="141">
assembled in the evening, and politics formed the
chief subject of conversation or animated discussion. But this was not all; moral questions were
often discussed in a manner philosophical and eloquent. I remember one such place, which, about
ten years since, I often visited. It was in Tottenham Court Road, between Chenies Street, and, I
think, Store Street. It was a small and plain apartment in comparison with more modern coffeehouses; but it was, to my taste, more comfortable.
It had about eight or ten small tables, which were
covered with the papers and late periodicals; and
there was a small library upon some hanging
shelves. A bright sea-coal fire-it was in winter that
I visited it-made it as snug and comfortable a retreat as might be desired. But the charm that drew
me to the room, almost nightly, after my first casual visit, was one or two of these coffee-house politicians of whom I speak. One gentleman especially, whom I understood to be connected with the
London Morning Chronicle, delighted me with the
force and brilliancy of his conversational powers;
and I thought those evenings thus spent, over a
beverage no more fiery than gunpowder tea, the
most rational that I had ever passed. I question
<pb id="p.142" n="142">
whether such living eloquence has not ceased to
shine, or rather has not been lost in the mammoth coffee-houses now erected; but still the silent eloquence
exists, perhaps more fully than before. There is
good old Christopher North, to our taste as great
and as glorious as the great wizard himself; for if
Scott did-and beautifully he did-delineate the exterior, the face of nature as it is, and was in that
unequalled, Professor Wilson, probing more deeply into the inner man, brings up from the recesses
of the heart its feelings, emotions, passions, with
a truth and beauty that has never been surpassed.
It is almost impossible not to believe that he is imbued with two natures,-the one finely delicate as
an Ariel's, which gives him the truest and nicest
perception of all that is most delightfuland beautiful in nature-WOMAN, whose bright and peculiar
champion he is. Who does not remember the good
man's holy indignation, poured forth in a torrent of
eloquence, than which there is nothing more beautiful in the English language, when attacking the
devil-turned-pious Coleman <note place="foot"> Coleman, rather late in life, was appointed dramatic
licenser. He was the author of many plays, which
were remarkable for the exuberance of oaths interlarded throughout them all. But upon his appointment he
suddenly reformed, and became as ridiculous in his attempts to make the writings of others rigidly moral, as
he had been reckless in regard to the immorality of his
own works. He hunted up every damme, and banished
it forthwith; a "s'death, sir," could not live; and angel,
as applied to a good, virtuous, and saint-like female, was
cut out, as infringing on an attribute of heaven's divinities. At one time Elliston sent George a play, as in
duty bound, for his supervision. The licenser cut out,
in his new hypocritically-zealous fervor, all that he
deemed objectionable passages. Elliston was much enraged, and sent him back a most caustic letter, commencing with the following line from one of Coleman's
own plays,
"Damme if it isn't the brazier."</note>, for his attempt to
<pb id="p.143" n="143">
strike out of all plays of modern date the word
"angel" as applied to "woman ?" Those who once
read it, will never forget it; those who have not, will
find it in one of his Noctes Ambrosianae, though
which in particular I cannot now refer to. His
other nature is strong, robust, rich and racy; and
but for the delicate and rosy tints which every
now and then shine through them, it would be impossible to think that from the same pallet could
proceed a Reubens and a Claude Lorraine.
How we in America love, respect, venerate, nay
almost idolize, old Christopher, must be known to
<pb id="p.144" n="144">
him; and it cannot but be a source of gratification
to one whose heart has kindred feelings for all nature, to know that that affectionate regard which is
felt for him in his own mountain heather, is experienced in the prairies, savannahs, and the clearings
in the measureless forests of the far and mighty
West.
<p>We heard that Christopher was dead, that his
<soCalled>fyttes</soCalled> were over, his last <soCalled>lay</soCalled> hushed, his
<soCalled>noctes</soCalled> darkened for ever; that the winding
Windermere mourned in ceaseless plaint the spirit
which had made it immortal. We felt as if we had
been struck by a blow; as if not Caledonia alone,
but the whole Anglo-Saxon race had experienced
an irreparable loss. From one end of the country
to the other, in its length and breadth-from Maine
to Louisiana, from the shores of the Atlantic to the
Rocky Mountains, hearts were sad and a friend and
instructor was mourned as lost for ever; the press
throughout the Union was redolent of eulogy, and
the heart spoke through the eloquent pen. Great
was our joy in finding that the report was unfounded.
Well then, Christopher North appears each
month on the tables of the coffee-houses, and there
<pb id="p.145" n="145">
is Boz, the inimitable Boz, a modern compound of
Fielding, Cervantes and Joe Miller, he is there
and then there is Tom Hood, the most inimitable
of punsters and facetious of all good fellows, he is
there. Here is the grave, gay, philosophical and
beautiful. There is something for all tastes. Is
your mind interested in the wonders of mechanism?
Is it watching the progress of that mighty power,
steam, and anxious for every information from the
scientific respecting the growth of the young giant,
already the mightiest of earthly powers, and destined to be the means of changing the whole aspect
of the world, and bringing all its ends together?
Your thirst for knowledge is administered to; the
"Mechanics' Magazine" lies before you. Are you
a literary character, and without the means of purchasing the many costly and valuable works which
emanate from the still teeming press? you shall yet
not be without information respecting them; the
"REVIEWS" are on the table, giving the general outline of all works published, together with copious
extracts therefrom. Are you a son of Esculapius?
There is something for you; the "Lancet" is at
your elbow, giving a full account of hospital treatment of patients under the hands of eminent prac<pb id="p.146" n="146">
titioners, from the date of their reception up to that
of their recovery or death; and all this amount of
light and serious reading, useful and entertaining,
may be enjoyed for the sum of three half-pence or
two pence per night. A young man can enter one
of these places at 6 o'clock, call for a cup of coffee,
and sit till 10 o'clock if he pleases; at which hour
coffee-houses generally close.
It must not be supposed that all coffee-houses
have such accommodations as I have described.
In the city proper, and in crowded thoroughfares,
coffee-houses are established solely for administering to the inner man; and beyond a few newspapers and weekly periodicals, nothing in the shape
of amusement is to be found. The places of which
I have spoken are chiefly at the West End of the
town. There is one in the Haymarket, near Piccadilly, which will more than come up to my description.
<p>Eating-houses, numerous in all great cities, will
be found truly abundant here. They are, many of
them, fitted up with great taste. Hot joints and
edibles of almost every description, may be had from
12 to 5 or 6 P. M. These houses are not licensed
to sell either beer or spirituous liquors; but they
<pb id="p.147" n="147">
obviate this difficulty ingeniously enough; a waiter
from a neighboring hotel or public-house attends,
and receiving orders direct from the persons dining,
brings them whatever viands they may desire.
The following are the prices charged in eating-houses for various articles:

<p>Chop-houses form a distinct class of eating-houses; here joints are not cooked, but only chops
or steaks. There are many in the city, and are
much resorted to by persons in business who reside
out of town or in some other part of the metropolis.
</p><p>There are several houses also in the city where
you may get a chop or steak which you yourself
provide. These are generally choice ale-houses;
and economists go to the butchers' shops in the
immediate vicinity, get the precise cut that they
may desire, and bring it in to be broiled over the
coals.
<pb id="p.149" n="149">
<p>You can thus then study your fancy according
to your pocket.
</p><p>But you may like to reside out of town. If so,
you will find the suburbs, in almost every direction,
pleasant; and should you choose some spot too far
off for a daily pedestrian feat, short stages and omnibuses run in every direction that you can turn.
There is no place, however, so delightful as Kensington, and that on account of its beautiful gardens, open to the public from sunrise to sunset.
Instead, likewise, of gaining your residence by a
long and dusty road, as would be the case in almost
any other direction, from Piccadilly you pass into
Hyde Park, through which you go the whole distance to Kensington, and have the green grass for
your carpet; the sky, unobscured by tall houses and
gaunt chimney-pots, for your canopy; and verdant
trees and the silvery Serpentine for your scenery;
diversified by the frolicksome boundings of deer,
and the no less playfull gambols of young children,
rejoicing in the liberty which they enjoy, and laughing out in the fulness of their joyousness. Then
Kensington Gardens, for beauty, are hardly to be
matched. The grand promenades, the green
lawns, the shaded walks, the secluded bowers, and
<pb id="p.150" n="150">
the forest and lake scenery, though in miniature,
are all beautiful; and finally the long twilights render the scene more enchanting, as they afford so
much time for enjoyment after the fiery sun has
called in his hot and lurid rays. About mid-summer there is no real night. It is twilight from the
setting to the rising of the sun.

<div2 type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>Literary Institutions.</head>
<p>
IT must be generally allowed, that if in London
there are more temptations to evil than in any other
city, perhaps, with one exception, in the world, so
there is also more incentives to virtue.
No man "can hug the flattering unction to his
soul," in the ruin consequent upon an evil course of
life, that vice was so prominent, and virtue so coy,
that he was seduced to ill, and fell into the lap of
vice more from circumstances over which he had
no control than from actual inclination. On the
contrary, he must give himself up to temptation;
he must give loose to his evil passions or to his
evil counsellors; he must shut his eyes to virtue
wilfully, for she courts him at every turn. She
has erected temples for his worship, and held out
strong temptations for him to pursue that path
<pb id="p.152" n="152">
which is for his interest, his honor, and his happiness.
<p>It is idleness that is the root of all evil. What,
then, are the opportunities that are offered for a
young man who is thrown upon the world in those
hours when crime stalks forth, when the labors of
the day are done, and pleasure in a thousand forms
seduces the unwary?
<p>I have already mentioned the coffee-houses,
where a young man may enjoy a rich "feast of
reason and a flow of soul," at an expenditure open
to the resources of all not in actual and wretched
beggary. But these are as nothing to the LITERARY
INSTITUTIONS which abound in the metropolis,
standing amidst its proudest, because most useful,
edifices.
Of the institutions to which I particularly allude,
I only at this moment remember the names of three
-the Western Literary Institution, the London
Literary Institution, and the Marylebone Literary
Institution.
These institutions owe their origin to the merchants and others of the city of London, who, taking into consideration the thousands of clerks and
others in their employment, exposed to temptations
<pb id="p.153" n="153">
of vice, thought, by holding out to them temptations
to virtue, many a fellow-being would be saved, and
society benefited, while their own individual interests would be preserved. They therefore subscribed funds to carry out their project, and have since
supported it by liberal donations. The consequence
is, that for a sum almost nominal, sciences, languages, and the arts, are within the reach of all;
and those whose education has been neglected in
youth, have now an opportunity of making up for
lost time, or of satisfying the cravings of the mind
thirsting for knowledge.
A strong desire to read Goethe's Faust in the German language introduced me to the Western Literary Institution. I will therefore describe that,
which is, I believe, in all material points similar to
the rest.
The Western Literary Institution is or was in
Leicester Square. Upon my enrolment as a member I mounted the steps, and entering the Library,
introduced by a member, I paid my initiatory fee,
half a guinea, and understood that I should have
to pay two guineas per annum to entitle me to the
privilege of the Institute. I observed that the
Library was very extensive, and, on glancing over
<pb id="p.154" n="154">
the catalogue, that it was enriched by choice and
rare books, as well as the lighter productions of
all the popular authors of the day. I had the privilege of taking any set of books I pleased home
with me, or of perusing them in the reading-room.
The reading-room I found to be a spacious apartment, embracing the whole floor over the Library.
Here were all the newspapers and periodicals
there were also sets of chess for those who wished
to indulge in that scientific amusement. This
room is open for the use of members from (I believe) ten in the morning until ten at night. The
other parts of the institution comprised a theatre
for lectures, &amp;c.; a museum, then in an infant state;
and rooms for the various classes.
For the yearly sum that I have already mentioned, with some other trifling incidental expenses,
amounting in all to a few shillings only, a member
could if he chose enter a French, German, Spanish, or Italian class, or all if he were so disposed,
under able professors, and acquire those languages
which might be useful to him in his commercial
relations or in his literary pursuits; he might also
enter music and drawing classes if he had taste or
inclination for either; he would be entitled to at<pb id="p.155" n="155">
tend a regular series of popular lectures by professors of the first repute; and also to attend and take
part in, if he pleased, debates upon subjects mooted
among the members themselves.
Here is a door opened to the fountain of knowledge; here is a magical sesame to those treasures,
more precious than Aladdin's, which enrich the
mind, nor leave it to the spell of any enchanter or
necromancy to dispossess it of its jewels. How
many in by-gone times have mourned the golden
opportunity of acquiring knowledge, lost in youth,
and lost irrevocably. How many have mourned
that the golden opportunity has never presented itself! It is so no longer. Have you, in the wilfulness of youth, neglected that instruction that you
now crave ? " Ask, and ye shall have." Have you,
from infortuitous circumstances, had the door to
knowledge barred against you? " Knock and it shall
be opened."

<p>The time selected for the classes is that at which
clerks and persons in business can best attend. It
is from six o'clock P. M. to eight or nine. There
are two French classes, and they and all the classes
have turned out some excellent scholars; many of
whom have in their adult state commenced with
<pb id="p.156" n="156">
the first rudiments. Every class has prospered;
the musical class has given several concerts at the
theatre of the Institution, which have done it high
honor.
<p>Mechanics' Institutes, of a somewhat similar
character, hold a high rank in the estimation of the
world. They are instituted for the diffusion of useful knowledge in the arts and sciences among the
mechanics of the metropolis, a mighty body. The
first was called into existence by Dr. Birkbeck. It
is located in Southampton Buildings, Chancery
Lane. The first public meeting was held at the
Crown and Anchor Tavern, <date value="1832-11-11">Nov. 11, 1823.</date>
</div2><pb id="p.157" n="157">
<div2><head>CHAPTER IV. <emph>Amusements- Concerts- Tea Gardens-
Anecdote.</emph></head>
<p>THERE are a great variety of amusements in
London within the reach of persons of moderate
means. The theatres are open to them; for it is
quite respectable to go to the pit, and not considered otherwise to attend, at least the lower gallery;
while the true philosophers in pleasure, whose
means are somewhat in abeyance, considerit by no
means infra-dig to ascend to the upperhouse; and
viewing the mimic show from high Olympus, seem
in their altitude to deserve the cognomen of Gods,
which has been their's from time immemorial.
The theatres are not the only places of amusement where those who seek pleasure at a reasonable rate can obtain it. There are places open to
them where no invidious comparisons can be
drawn, many degrees removed, as from private
<pb id="p.158" n="158">
boxes to dress circle, from dress to second circle,
from second circle to pit, from pit to lower gallery,
from lower gallery to upper,-that classic retreat.
These places are the public gardens fitted up for
concerts and entertainments. There are two in
particular, "White Conduit Gardens, Islington,"
and "The Eagle Tavern," City Road. Upon entering these places you pay one shilling, for which
you receive a ticket which entitles you to a glass of
brandy and water, or any other liquor that you
please to call for. If it is in the summer time, you
pass into the gardens, which are a miniature representation of Vauxhall, lighted with variegated
lamps and devices. Here you will find an orchestra erected, and a concert, divided into two parts,
given. The performers are not artistes who have
distinguished themselves pre-eminently,-but they
are for the most part pleasing, and often good, and
may arrive at eminence. A very popular singer
now in this country obtained her first popularity
at a place of a similar nature to the ones alluded to.
Glee singing is popular at these places, and often
given with great effect. I have heard the "Chough
and Crow," and "Mynheer Van Dunck," given
with an effect not surpassed on the boards of a the<pb id="p.159" n="159">
atre, where the legitimate affects to lord it over its
illegitimate brethren. The orchestras, too, are well
conducted. The overtures to Semiramade, Fri
Diavolo, Oberon, William Tell, Tancredi, La Gazza, Ladra, I Puritani, &amp;c. &amp;c., are given with great
care and fidelity. There are too many musicians
in London for all of high merit to hold a high rank,
and thus we sometimes find genius at a tavern.
There are men to whom a glass of grog is indispensable by way of a nightcap; such may attend
the gardens, indulge in the potations, and sip their
beverage to the tune of "Drops of Brandy," or
drink the "brown October" to "this mug which
now flows with mild ale."
<p>It would seem that the proprietors, in lighting their
gardens, paying singers, musicians, waiters, &amp;c.
could make but little by the operation; but the extent of their gardens, and the numbers that are gathered together by the cheap announcement, afford
them emolument enough.
<p>In the winter the concerts are given in the
"long room" of the establishment, usually built expressly for public dinners and concerts. The long
room at the White Conduit House is perhaps the
largest in London. A gallery is erected in the
<p>
upper part of the room for the singers, where is also
a piano; and the visitors remain below at table
placed in a long line, four in a row, down the complete length of the room. Each person has before
him his glass; the favorite beverage is hot brandy an
water with sugar-rum or gin and water ditto, c
mulled wine; and when a favorite song is sung, the
effect upon those already in a good humor by their
favorite liquor is perfectly magical, and the "bra
voes," stamping of feet, rattling of canes-or, stimore general, the knocking of glasses on the mahogany is actually astounding.
<p>There are large concert rooms fitted up at Bag
nigge Wells, and the Yorkshire Stingo, Lisson
Grove, and many other places "too numerous to
mention."
<p>Beside these places of entertainment, there are
an immense number of refreshment places in the
environs and vicinity of the metropolis, called "Tea
Gardens." The Cockneys are great pedestrians
and love a walk dearly, induced to the healthful
exercise doubtless by the long twilights, which render a long evening walk practicable and pleasant,
There is not a pleasant walk in the vicinity of
London, where there are green fields and glimpses
<pb id="p.160" n="160">
of the country, that does not contain Tea Gardens;
and excellent is the arrangement. You take a
walk for some two, three, or four miles, and feel fatigued; you have but to enter some gardens, and
boiling Bohea is brought to you with rolls and
a pat of butter. The tea is not served up in a cup,
but the tea-pot is brought, and you may -have the
contents drowned in as much hot water, and as often as you please. Again, you are located in a pleasant bower, and pains are taken to render you as
"comfortable and as rural as possible."
<p>There are, occasionally, a class of beings, who
would here be called loafers, who determine to get
a good meal, and take their chance of being kicked
out or escaping, enter these places minus any thing
like the "better currency." They call for what they
want, and endeavor to abscond, having got it. This
has given rise to some humor among the caricaturists. I remember seeing an excellent print of
three fellows climbing over the wall of a " Tea Garden," and the waiter standing aghast at the decamp
of the scamps, and exclaiming, "Master, master,
there are two teas and a brandy and vater a getting
over the vall;" meaning, that two persons who had
taken tea, and one who had taken brandy and water,
<pb id="p.161" n="161">
were thus, after filling their inward man, absconding without paying the piper.
While upon the Jeremy Diddler subject, it may
not be amiss to mention an amusing circumstance
which took place in an eating-house in town. A
poor Frenchman (it was in the winter) entered
one merely for the purpose of warming himself at
the fire; he was in too great distress to think of any
indulgence in the good things there smoking in
profusion, save such as might be inhaled by his olfactory nerve. While engaged in rubbing his half-starved, bony hands before a good fire, the master
of the house came up, and said-
<p>"Wont you take something ?"
<p>"I tank you, sare," was the reply.
<p>"What will you take ?"
<p>"What you please?"
<p>"We have some very nice roast turkey and sausages; will you like that?"
<p>"I tank you, I sall like him vere mooch."
<p>"Sit down here, and I will bring it you."
<p>The Frenchman was accordingly ushered into a
box, and the turkey and dressings placed before
him. Of whatever he was asked to partake, he
partook. He ate bountifully, and washed it down
<pb id="p.162" n="162">
with some good wine. Poor fellow! he had not
known such a meal before for many a long day.
The proprietor thought that he had a good customer; his mortification and disappointment were extreme, when, on presenting his bill, the Frenchman
said,
<p>"I have no money, sare."
<p>"No money!"
<p>"No."
<p>"Then what the devil did you come into my
house, and order such a dinner for?"
<p>"Pardon, you mistake: I came here to warm myself-you come to me and ask me if I will take
noting; I say 'I tank you ;' you say 'What will you
take;' I respond 'What you please;' you bring
me de turkey, de sausage, de tart, de pudding, de
cheese, and de wine; I no ask you for them; you
ask me will I take, and I can no refuse.
<p>The master of the house, who was something
of a humorist, and who was also struck with the
Frenchman's gaunt and poverty-stricken figure,
suffered him to depart. But great was his astonishment at seeing, a short time afterwards, another
Frenchman enter, who, upon being asked what he
would take, likewise replied, " What you please."
<pb id="p.163" n="163">
<p>"Oh, ho," exclaimed the landlord, "I forgave the
other because he was an original; but you, fellow,
are a mere copyist, I shall kick you into the street;"
which he did accordingly. It appeared that the
poor premier Frenchman had met an acquaintance,
and told him of his adventure at the eating-house;
the poor starved acquaintance hastened to the spot,
already feasting in imagination on delicacies innumerable, and little dreaming of the'unpleasant denouement which the cruel Fates had reserved for
him.

<p>Alms-Houses. The Haberdashers' Alms-houses
were originally called Aske's Hospital, and named
after Robert Aske, Esq., who left by his will &pound;30,000 for erecting the building, and the relief of twenty poor members of the company of Haberdashers,
besides the maintenance of twenty boys, sons of
decayed freemen of the said company.
In the brief space allotted to this Appendix, it
would be impossible to enter fully into a description,
or even bare mention, of the many Alms-houses
that tell of the good Samaritans who have dwelt
in the modern Babel. I have, I fear, been already
too diffuse in this chapter. But these are institutions of which London may well be proud. They
are the noblest of her monuments. Reading the
long list preceding these remarks, when we speak
of the vices and follies of London, and her boundless extravagance, we must also confess that she
is not surpassed in her CHARITIES,-that virtue
which "covereth a multitude of sins." Nor is her
charity stretched forth with stern virtue only to the
unfortunate. It goes hand in hand with mercy,
and says to the lost and abandoned, if they will
turn from their evil courses, a door is yet open to
them, where by reformation they may regain the
justly forfeited esteem and consideration of their
fellow-beings. The sum annually expended in
public charities is estimated at &pound;900,000.

entitled to charge for every person he carries; in
London, whether the Hack takes up one or four persons, he can only make the same charge.
His fares are regulated according to time or distance at his own option.
He cannot legally demand more than his regulated fare, and a person imposed upon in this respect
can recover the extortion by application at the
Police Office, and subject the extortioner to a fine
of 51.
<p>After sunset, which is fixed to prevent confusion,
after eight in the evening between Lady Day and
Michaelmas, and afterfive in the evening between
Michaelmas and Lady Day, the coachman, if taken
<pb id="p.203" n="203">
from the extension of the pavement in town, can
demand back-carriage to the nearest coach-stand.
The drivers of Hackney Coaches are enjoined by
law to carry all property left in their coaches to
the Hackney Coach Office at Somerset House,
within four days, under a panalty of 20l.

<head>REGULATED FARES OF WATERMEN.</head>
<p>The fare of watermen plying between any of

side of the river; from Nine Elms to the Red House;
from the Red House to Swan Stairs, Chelsea; or
<pb id="p.205" n="205">
opposite; from Swan Stairs to Battersea Bridge;
the fares are at the same rates. Thus, from London Bridge to Battersea Bridge, the whole fare each
person for sculls would be 2s. 6d. or for oars 5s.
Eastward of <placeName key="London Bridge">London Bridge</placeName>
 the rates are the
same for equal distances to <placeName key="Greenwich">Greenwich</placeName>
. From
thence eastward the fare is 6d. for every half mile.
Posts are placed on the banks of the river to show
the distances. No sculler can be compelled to go
below <placeName key="Crawley's Wharf">, Crawley's Wharf</placeName>, <placeName key="Greenwich">Greenwich</placeName>
.
<p>For ferrying one over the water directly at any
part between Windsor and Greenwich, excepting
on Sundays, the fare is for one person 3d, two persons 11/2 each, and for any number exceeding two
1d. each. Over the water, between <placeName key="Crawley's
Wharf">Crawley's

The fare per half hour, for persons taking a boat
to be rowed about on the water not going directly
from place to place, is for scullers 6d. for oars 1s.
Passengers going in boats to or from steam or
other vessels, are to pay for one person, 4d.; for
any number of persons, 3d. each, including 56lbs.
of luggage for each person.
<p>Watermen detained by persons stopping at ships
or elsewhere, to be paid for time or distance at the

trouble in every quarter of the town. Several of
the principal hotels are furnished with them. The
usual price for a cold bath is 1s. or a warm bath
3s. 6d.; by subscribing for a quarter, the price is
materially diminished. The sea-water baths are
3s. 6d. each time, or, if warm, about 7s. 6d.
<pb id="p.207" n="207">
<div3><head>STAGE COACHES.</head>

to give the post-boy 2d. or 3d. per mile.

long maintained the most distinguished rank among the
learned men of the most learned nation of Europe. His
Universal History was his favorite object. Madame
de Stael expressed the sentiment generally entertained respecting him: "Muller, the most learned of historians,"
says that celebrated writer, "possessed a mass of erudition altogether unparalleled: his acquirements of this
kind actually inspired awe in those who witnessed their
display. The six thousand years of authentic history
were perfectly arranged in his memory: and his studies
had been so accurate, that his impressions remained as
