<div1 type=chapter id="c.1" n="1"><HEAD>Site, local divisions, and government of the City of Westminster; history of the Abbey; Coronation Ceremonies; and lists of the Abbots and Deans.</HEAD>
 
<p>The history of Westminster is involved in that of the venerable abbey from which it derives its name. To the zeal and taste of English monachism, are we indebted for some of the finest remains of pointed architecture, and <num value="1">one</num> of the most ancient and interesting edifices in Europe; but, unfortunately, like all other similar relics of the piety, taste, and skill of our forefathers prior to the Reformation, the iconoclastic zeal and mistaken policy of a purer faith, have involved much of its earliest history in obscurity. The furor of <num value="2">two</num> state ecclesiastical reformations has lessened the evidence of its former magnificence, by ravaging its archives, and committing to the flames, as records of popery, many documents which are now required in the elucidation of its history. 
<p><FIGURE id="Fig.001"><HEAD>Plan of the City of Westminster, Divided into Parishes.</HEAD></FIGURE>
<p>This city, as above noticed, received its name from the abbey, or minster, situated to the westward of the city of London, which, according to several historians, was thus denominated, to distinguish it from the abbey of Grace on Tower-hill, called Eastminster; but Mr. Maitland proves this to be a mistake, by showing that the former is called Westminster, in an undated charter of sanctuary, granted by Edward the Confessor, who died in <datestruct value="1066--"><year reg="1066">1066</year></datestruct>, and that the latter was not founded till <datestruct value="1359"><year reg="1359">1359</year></datestruct>; he therefore supposes, that the appellation of Westminster was given to distinguish it from St. Paul's church, in the city of London. 
<p>In ancient times, this was a mean, unhealthy place, <pb id="p.2" n="2"> remarkable for nothing but the abbey, which was situated on a marshy island, surrounded on <num value="1">one</num> side by the Thames, and on the other by what was called Long Ditch. This ditch was a branch of the river, which began nearly where Manchester-buildings now stand; and crossing King-street, ran westward to Delahay-street, where it turned to the south, and continued its course along Princes-street, until it crossed Tothill-street, from whence it passed along the south wall of the abbey-garden, to the Thames again. It has, however, been arched over for many years, and is at present a common sewer. 
<p>Mr. Nightingale, however, presumes this island was of greater extent. From the roof of the northern tower of Westminster-abbey, he says, the eye may distinctly trace the ancient isle of Thorney. Following the winding of the Thames round Mill-bank, we perceive it ends in a marsh, filled with reeds and aquatic plants, at the extremity of Ranelagh gardens. From that place to Chelsea waterworks is equally low and wet, exclusive of the creek, or canal for barges. This brings the eye almost to the gates of St. James's park, where a valley, nearly in a line with the marsh, contains the canal. Allowing these probabilities, and for filling inequalities in the streets, an angular line is formed. 
<p>But a question naturally occurs: whence was made the embankment, known by the name of Milbank? And where would highwater mark be found, supposing it away? It is to be feared the island of Thorney would be reduced to a very narrow compass. Possibly the tide passed, in very ancient times, across Parliament-street, through the park, and over all the ground south-west of the abbey, leaving on its return the whole a mass of filth. Such, generally, are the observations and conjectures of an antiquary to whom I have before been frequently indebted. The necessity of thus endeavouring minutely to ascertain the situation and boundaries of the little island of Thorney arises from the ancient assertion that the abbey of Westminster was erected on this real, or imaginary insulated spot of ground, which was called the Island of Thorns, or Thorney Island, on account of its being overspread with thorns. 
<p>After all, however, much is left to conjecture on this subject, and as much to the imagination, in support of this ancient tradition concerning Thorney Island.<NOTE><BIBL>Beauties of England and Wales, vol.x, part <num value="4">4</num>, p. <num value="11">11</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>In the course of time a few houses were erected round the monastery, which, at length, grew into a small town, called in ancient books,  <QUOTE>The town of Westminster.</QUOTE>  But the principal cause of the increase of Westminster, was the continual jealousy of the government against the privileges and immunities claimed by the citizens of London. To this cause must be attributed the establishment of the woolstaple, at Westminster, in preference to London, which occasioned a great resort of merchants thither. Another <pb id="p.3" n="3"> cause of its growth, was, the royal residence being generally here; for which reason, most of the chief nobility also erected inns, or town-houses, in its vicinity, the sites of many of which still retain the names of their former owners. 
<p>Westminster continued for many ages a distinct town from London, and the road between them, on the sides of which the street called the Strand was afterwards built, passed along the river side, and through the village of Charing. This road, however, from the frequent passing of horses and carts, had become so dangerous both to men and carriages, that in the year <datestruct value="1353"><year reg="1353">1353</year></datestruct>, an order of council was passed which imposed a duty on every pack of wool, as well as all other goods,  <QUOTE> carried either by land or water to the staple of Westminster;</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>for the purpose of repairing the highway leading from the gate of London, called Temple-bar, to the gate of the abbey at Westminster.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Hughson, vol. i, p. <num value="78">78</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> It is evident from the record, that London and Westminster were then regarded as distinct towns; but it would be, perhaps, too much to infer, that  <QUOTE> the highway</QUOTE>  between them,  <QUOTE>now the noble street, called the Strand, was not then built upon, but was a mere country road, having, however, many noblemen's and gentlemen's houses and gardens adjoining to it,</QUOTE>  &amp;c. For we learn, from the same order of council, that the cause of the impost was, the  <QUOTE>highway, being by the frequent passing of carts and horses, carrying merchandize and provisions to the said staple, become so deep and miry, and the pavement so broken and worn, as to be very dangerous both to men and carriages;</QUOTE>  and we farther find, that it was ordained, that  <QUOTE>all owners of houses, adjacent to the highway, should repair as much as lay before their doors.</QUOTE> -- It seems pretty clear from these parts of the edict, that even at this early period the buildings of both cities had extended considerably beyond their respective gates, along the line of the highway between them; although probably they did not reach on either side as far as Charing-cross, which is supposed to have derived its name from a village, called Charing, which anciently stood midway between London and Westminster. In <datestruct value="1385--"><year reg="1385">1385</year></datestruct>, it was new paved from Temple-bar to the Savoy; and some years after, by the interest of sir Robert Cecil, who had an elegant mansion where Cecil-street now stands, the pavement was continued as far as his house. 
<p>In course of time, Westminster became a place of some consideration; but it received its most distinguished honours from Henry VIII. who, on the dissolution of the monastery of St. Peter, converted it into a bishopric, with a dean and <num value="12">twelve</num> prebendaries; and appointed the whole county of Middlesex, except Fulham, which was to remain to the bishop of London, for its diocese. On this occasion Westminster became a city; for the making of which, according to lord chief justice Coke, nothing more is required, than to be the seat of episcopal power. <pb id="p.4" n="4"> 
<p>The old palace, near the abbey, having been nearly destroyed by fire in <datestruct value="1512--"><year reg="1512">1512</year></datestruct>, Henry VIII. took up his residence at Whitehall, which he purchased, in <datestruct value="1530--"><year reg="1530">1530</year></datestruct>, of cardinal Wolsey. He also built the palace of St. James, and inclosed a fine spot of ground, which he converted into a park, for the accommodation of both palaces. 
<p>From this period, the buildings about Westminster began greatly to increase: but it did not long enjoy the honour of being a city; for it never had but <num value="1">one</num> bishop, Thomas Thirleby, who being translated to the see of Norwich, by Edward VI. in <datestruct value="1550--"><year reg="1550">1550</year></datestruct>, the new bishopric was dissolved, and its right to the epithet of city was thereby lost. However, Westminster is still considered as a city, and is so stiled in our statutes. 
<p>The city of Westminster, properly so called, consists of but <num value="2">two</num> parishes, viz. St. Margaret and St. John the Evangelist; but the liberties contain <num value="7">seven</num> parishes, which are as follow: St. Martin, in the Fields; St. James; St. Anne; St. Paul, Covent-garden; St. Mary-le-Strand; St. Clement Danes; and St. George, Hanover-square; to which must be added, the precinct of the Savoy. 
<p>The government of both the city and liberties of Westminster is under the jurisdiction of the dean and chapter of St. Peter's, as well in civil as in ecclesiastical affairs, whose authority also extends to some towns in Essex, and the whole of their district is exempt from the jurisdiction of the bishop of London, and of the archbishop of Canterbury. Since the Reformation, the management of the civil part of the government has been in the hands of laymen, elected, or, when appointed by their principals, confirmed by the dean and chapter. 
<p>The form of the civil government of Westminster was settled by an act of parliament passed in the <num value="27">27th</num> of queen Elizabeth, intituled,  <QUOTE>An Act for the government of the city and borough of Westminster;</QUOTE>  which directs the appointment of <num value="12">twelve</num> burgesses, and <num value="12">twelve</num> assistants, annually, to preside over <num value="12">twelve</num> wards into which Westminster was at that time divided; and gives power to the dean, high steward, or his deputy, and the <num value="12">twelve</num> burgesses, or any <num value="3">three</num> of them, whereof the dean, high steward, or his deputy, to be <num value="1">one</num>, to hear, determine, and punish according to the laws of the realm, or laudable and lawful customs of the city of London, all matters of incontinency, common scolds, inmates, common annoyances, &amp;c. and to commit persons offending against the peace, to prison; but to give notice, within <num value="24">twenty-four</num> hours, to some justice of the peace for the county. All good orders and ordinances, made by the dean and high steward, with the assistance of the burgesses, concerning the government of the inhabitants, and not repugnant to the queen's prerogative, or the laws of the land, to be of full force and strength. 
<p>Though the increase of the liberties of Westminster has rendered some alterations in this statute necessary, yet the substance of it is still the basis of the government of this city. <pb id="p.5" n="5"> 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> of these magistrates is the high steward, who is usually <num value="1">one</num> of the chief nobility, chosen by the dean and chapter. His office has some affinity to that of a chancellor of an university; and he holds his place during life. On his death, or resignation, a chapter is called for the election of another, in which the dean sits as high steward, until the election is determined. 
<p>The deputy steward is appointed by the high steward, and confirmed by the dean and chapter. He is chairman of the court-leet; by which the high constable, the petty constables, and the annoyance juries are appointed. 
<p>The high bailiff is nominated by the dean, and confirmed by the high steward, and holds his place for life. He is returning officer at the election for members of parliament, and enjoys considerable profits from fines, forfeitures, &amp;c. The office is generally executed by a deputy, who is an attorney of repute. 
<p>The burgesses are <num value="16">sixteen</num> in number, each of whom has an assistant. They are nearly similar to the aldermen and deputies in the city of London, but the exercise of their office is now principally confined to attending the courts leet, &amp;c. 
<p>Before the year <datestruct value="1698"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>, the inhabitants of Westminster were liable to be called upon to serve as jurors at the quarter sessions for the county of Middlesex; but a clause was introduced into an act, passed in that year for regulating jurors, by which they were exempted from this duty. 
<p>Notwithstanding the great extent of Westminster, the government of it bears but little resemblance to that of a large city; the inhabitants have no exclusive corporation privileges, nor are there any trading companies within its jurisdiction. The <num value="2">two</num> members who represent it in parliament, like those of a common country borough, are chosen by the inhabitant householders at large; and the only courts held in Westminster, are, the court-leet, the quarter session, and <num value="2">two</num> courts of requests, for the recovery of small debts. Westminster has, however, long been the seat of the royal palace, the high court of parliament, and of our law tribunals. 
<p>The building of the abbey is involved in mists too dense for the sun of antiquarian research to dissipate. The period of its erection, previous to Edward the Confessor's days, will not probably ever be discovered. In this venerable building lived Sulgardus, a monk, who devoted his leisure hours to a history of it. He has, indeed, according to custom, used but little ceremony with St. Peter, or the choir of heaven; for he pressed both into his service, in order to make the consecration of this church hallowed and sublime. Widmore, whose work is the only <num value="1">one</num> worthy of implicit credit, both from his having been a learned man, and his unrestrained access to every species of record belonging to the abbey, fixes the foundation between the years <datestruct value="730--"><year reg=730>730</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="740--"><year reg=740>740</year></datestruct>; but is unable to say who is the founder. If, however, we could rely on dreams, and <pb id="p.6" n="6"> particularly on those of monks, we might quote the authority of Wulsinus, that the apostle St. Peter himself had a chapel or oratory on the site of the magnificent pile dedicated to him. The vision of Wulsinus was turned to some advantage by the succeeding monks, who added a new legend of St. Peter's crossing the water <num value="1">one</num> stormy night, to consecrate the church, and rewarding the fishermen who ferried him over Thorney (water which surrounded the church, the site of which was called Thorney Island), with a miraculous draught of salmon, assuring him and his fellow watermen that they should never want fish, provided they would give <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="10">tenth</num> of what they caught to the newly consecrated church. To those who consider the influence of the Catholic priesthood, it will not excite much surprise that the tale was believed, and that for several centuries the monks of Westminster fed on the offerings of the Thames fishermen. What was at <num value="1">first</num> solicited as a benevolence, in course of time was claimed as a right, so that in the year <datestruct value="1231"><year reg="1231">1231</year></datestruct>, the monks brought an action at law against the priest of Rotherhithe, in which they compelled him to give up to them <num value="1">one</num>-half of the tithe of all salmon caught in his parish. 
<p>It is very probable it was destroyed by the Danes, and rebuilt through the influence of Dunstan with king Edgar, and appropriated to the order of St. Benedict, and <num value="12">twelve</num> monks, with endowments sufficient for their maintenance. 
<p>The monastery continued unmolested till Edward the Confessor, about <datestruct value="1050--"><year reg="1050">1050</year></datestruct>, piously resolved to thoroughly renovate it, and some authors say rebuild it, in the Norman style. Large revenues were given to the monks by the king; and his nobles, like true courtiers, copied his example. 
<p>Whether Edward entirely rebuilt the whole of this monastery, as well as the church, has not been ascertained, though it seems probable, considering the ardour with which he carried on the undertaking, and the vast sum which he appropriated to its support. Some remains of this building still exist, and will be described in their due place. 
<p>On the completion of the church, Edward determined to have it consecrated in the most solemn and impressive manner, and with that intent summoned all the bishops and great men in the kingdom to be witnesses of the ceremony, which took place on Holy Innocent's day (<datestruct VALUE="-12-28"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=28>28</day></datestruct>,) <datestruct value="1065--"><year reg="1065">1065</year></datestruct>.

<p>In the time of abbot Laurentius, after the year <datestruct value="1159"><year reg="1159">1159</year></datestruct>, some repairs were made to the out-buildings of the monastery, which had been destroyed by fire, and their roofs covered with lead. 
<p>Henry III. in the year <datestruct value="1220"><year reg="1220">1220</year></datestruct>, on Whitsun-eve, <datestruct VALUE="-05-16"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=16>16</day></datestruct>, laid the <num value="1">first</num> stone of a chapel, which was dedicated to the blessed Virgin Mary. Its site was that of the present chapel called Henry the <num value="7">seventh</num>'s. <pb id="p.7" n="7"> 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1223"><year reg="1223">1223</year></datestruct>, a furious assault was made upon the mastery by the exasperated citizens of London, who pulled down the steward's house, and did other considerable damage, in consequence of a dispute who was winner at a wrestling match. It appears that the people at the abbey were in some measure the aggressors, as the steward had armed them against the day he appointed for a <num value="2">second</num> trial of skill.<NOTE><BIBL>Vide ante, vol. i. p. <num value="73">73</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>Nothing more occurs relating to the repair or additions to the Confessors structure till the year <datestruct value="1245"><year reg="1245">1245</year></datestruct>, when Henry III. began to take it down, in order to rebuild it. Matthew Paris, speaking of this sovereign, under the date <datestruct value="1245"><year reg="1245">1245</year></datestruct>, says,  <QUOTE>the king in the same year commanded that the church of St. Peter at Westminster, should be enlarged, and the tower with the eastern part overthrown, to be built anew and more handsome at his own charge, and fitted to the residue, or western part.</QUOTE>  This circumstance, his gifts to the abbot and convent, his will, and the translation of the Confessor's body, would lead to a supposition that he was a man piously disposed towards the clergy and religious orders. On the contrary he was a weak and artful prince, and suffered the most shameful exactions to be forced from the priesthood, through legates and nuncios, for the popes. 
<p>Henry appropriated a considerable sum to the rebuilding of the church; in the year <datestruct value="1246"><year reg="1246">1246</year></datestruct>, the sum of <measure value="2591l." type=currency><num value="2591">2,591</num>l.</measure> due from the widow of <num value="1">one</num> David of Oxford, a Jew, was assigned by him to that use. 
<p>In <datestruct value="1247--"><year reg="1247">1247</year></datestruct>, on the day of the translation of Edward the Confessor, a vessel of blood, which in the preceding year had been sent to the king by the knights templars and hospitallers in the Holy Land, and was attested by Robert, the patriarch of Jerusalem, to have trickled from our Saviour's wounds at his crucifixion, was presented with great ceremony to this church.<NOTE><BIBL>Neale and Brayley's Hist. West. Abbey, i. p. <num value="49">49</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>During the reign of this monarch, pope Honorius III. demanded that <num value="2">two</num> prebends in every cathedral, and <num value="2">two</num> monk's portions in every monastery, should be appropriated to the holy see. Though the king did not interfere, the parliament did, and prevented such an arrangement from taking place. The clergy too were firm; but as the monarch, who often wanted the capacious shield of papal power as a guard from the resentment of his people, countenanced the legates, they did not escape many pecuniary demands, which were paid to avoid anathemas, excommunications, and deprivations. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1269-10-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1269">1269</year></datestruct>, the new church, of which the eastern part, with the choir and transept appears to have been at that time completed, was <num value="1">first</num> opened for divine service; and on the same day, the body of Edward the Confessor,  <QUOTE>that before laye in the syde of the quere, where the monkes nowe singe,</QUOTE>  was removed with great solemnity  <QUOTE>into ye chapell at the backe of the hygh <pb id="p.8" n="8"> aulter, and there layde in a ryche shryne.</QUOTE>  This ceremony accompanied by every circumstance of pomp and solemnity, must have been very impressive. It appears that  <QUOTE>the chest being taken out of the old shrine, the king, and his brother, the king of the Romans, carried it upon their shoulders in the view of the whole church, and his sons Edward, and Edmund earl of Lancaster, the earl of Warren, and the lord Phillip Basset, with as many other nobles as could come near to touch it, supported it with their hands to the pew shrine.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Dart from Wyke's Chron. p. <num value="88">88</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>Among the additional privileges with which this sovereign invested the abbots, were those of holding a weekly market at Tuthill on Mondays, and an annual fair of <num value="3">three</num> days continuance, viz. on the eve, the day, and the morrow of the festival of St. Mary Magdalen. He also granted leave to the abbot to make a park in Windsor forest, and a warren of <num value="10">ten</num> acres and a half. 
<p>It is impossible to ascertain how far the architect had proceeded in the church when Henry died in the year <datestruct value="1272"><year reg="1272">1272</year></datestruct>. According to Fabian, the choir was not completed till <datestruct value="13"><year reg="13">thirteen</year></datestruct> years after his death. 
<p>A short time previous to the re-building of the church, abbot Richard de Crokesley had erected a chapel near the north door, and dedicated it to St. Edmund. It was taken down with the rest by Henry III. 
<p>Not long after, the beautiful pavement before the high altar was laid, for abbot Ware died <datestruct VALUE="1283-12--"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <year reg="1283">1283</year></datestruct>, and was buried under it. 
<p>The abbey was damaged in <datestruct value="1297--"><year reg="1297">1297</year></datestruct> by a fire which broke out in the lesser hall in the king's palace adjoining. 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1303"><year reg="1303">1303</year></datestruct>, the king's treasury, at that time somewhere within the abbey, was robbed to the amount of <measure value="100000l." type=currency><num value="100000">100,000</num>l.</measure> which had been laid up for the service of the Scottish wars. The abbot, Walter de Wenlock, and <num value="48">forty-eight</num> of the monks, were in consequence committed to the Tower; and notwithstanding their protestations of innocence, and request to be tried, <num value="12">twelve</num> of them were kept <num value="2">two</num> years in prison, the depositions against them being such as caused great suspicion of their having been concerned in the robbery.<NOTE><BIBL>Rymer's Foedera, ii. p. <num value="930">930</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>Abbot Langham who died at Avignon, <datestruct VALUE="1376-07-22"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=22>22</day>, <year reg=1376>1376</year></datestruct>, bequeathed all the residue of his property, consisting of silver and gilt vessels, money, robes, vestments, jewels, &amp;c. towards the building of the abbey church. The value of this benefaction amounted to the immense sum of <measure value="10800l." type=currency><num value="10800">10,800</num>l.</measure> 
<p>Nicholas Littlington succeeded Langham; and, chiefly with the sums left by his predecessor, made great additions to the abbey. Widmore, from the records, says, &lsquo;he built the present college hall, the kitchen, the Jerusalem chamber, the abbot's house, now the deanery, the bailiff's, the cellarer's, the infirmarer's, and the sacrist's houses; the malt house, afterwards used as a dormitory for the king's scholars, and the adjoining tower, the wall of the <pb id="p.9" n="9"> infirmary garden, a water mill; and finished the south and west sides of the cloisters. He died in <datestruct value="1386--"><year reg="1386">1386</year></datestruct>. 
<p>In <datestruct value="1378--"><year reg="1378">1378</year></datestruct>, the right of sanctuary possessed by the abbey was, for the <num value="1">first</num> time, violated; and the church itself made the scene of a most atrocious murder. Sir Ralph de Ferrers and sir Allan Boxhull, constable of the Tower, at the instigation of John of Gaunt, went to the abbey with upwards of <num value="50">fifty</num> retainers, to seize <num value="2">two</num> esquires, Frank de Haule and John Schakell: the latter was taken prisoner in the church during high mass, but Haule defending himself was slain in the choir. The church was shut up for <num value="4">four</num> months, and the aggressors were excommunicated by the archbishop of Canterbury. During the reign of Richard II. the rebuilding of the western part of the church was carried on, and continued by William of Colchester, abbot, who died <datestruct value="1420--"><year reg="1420">1420</year></datestruct>. Richard Harweden, the next abbot, zealously proceeded with the nave. Abbot Esteney, who died in <datestruct value="1498--"><year reg="1498">1498</year></datestruct>, did a great deal towards the finishing of it, and made the great west window. 
<p>Abbot John Islip was the last, during whose time many additions were made to the church; and it remained unfinished till sir Christopher Wren completed the towers. 
<p>The early part of the government of Islip was rendered memorable by the foundation of the magnificent chapel of Henry the <num value="7">seventh</num>; which is attached to the east end of the abbey church, and was erected on the site of <num value="2">two</num> chapels dedicated, respectively, to the Virgin Mary and to St. Erasmus. These chapels having been pulled down to make room for the new fabric, the <num value="1">first</num> stone was laid on <datestruct VALUE="1502-01-24"><month reg="01">January</month> the <day reg=24>24th</day>, <year reg=1502>1502</year></datestruct>-<num value="3">3</num>, by the hands of abbot Islip; sir Reginald Bray, K. G.; Dr. Barnes, master of the rolls; Dr. Wall, chaplain to the king; master Hugh Oldham, chaplain to the countess of Richmond and Derby, the king's mother; sir Edward Stanhope, knt.; and divers other persons. The king himself was present at the ceremony, and most probably assisted in placing the stone, which had engraven on it the following inscription:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote lang=la>Illustrissimus Henricus septimus rex Anglicae et Franciae, et dominus Hiberniae, posuit hanc petram in honore beater Virginis Mariae; <num value="24">24</num> die Januarij, anno Domini, <datestruct value="1502--"><year reg="1502">1502</year></datestruct>. Et annodicti Henrici septimi, decimo octavo.</QUOTE>
 
<p>This was intended by the king not only for his own place of interment, but for that of king Henry VI.: but whether the latter was ever placed in the chapel, is now a matter of doubt. According to Widmore, the body was actually removed by the convent to the abbey, in the year <datestruct value="1501"><year reg="1501">1501</year></datestruct>, at the expence of <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">500</num>l.</measure> As the chapel was unfinished at the king's death, it is probable, that his rapacious successor thought the cost of a public interment would be better applied to his own use, and therefore let the murdered king remain in privacy, unknown; and perhaps he is still undisturbed.

<p>In consequence of these agreements abbot Islip provided an altar and hearse, on and about which were placed <num value="100">one hundred</num> tapers, 
<QUOTE>under the lantern place betweene the quere and the high aultier,</QUOTE>
till the king's chapel was finished. <num value="3">Three</num> monks who were added to the usual number, and doctors or bachelors of divinity, sung mass daily before it, for the prosperous estate of the king and his realm; for queen Elizabeth's soul; their issue; for Edmund, earl of Richmond; Margaret, countess of Richmond; and, when deceased, for their souls.

As this altar was intended only for a temporary purpose, it was removed on certain days of ceremony to the south aisle, facing the chapel of St. Benedict. 
<p>At <num value="12">twelve</num> o'clock on Good-Friday, Easter-Monday, and every Sunday except Palm-Sunday and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> others, and on all the feasts of the blessed Virgin, the great bell began to toll, which was continued till <num value="1">one</num>, when a chauntry priest, a regular, or secular, or <pb id="p.11" n="11"> doctor from either of the Universities, ascended the pulpit, and in a solemn sermon exhorted the audience to pray for king Henry and his relatives. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-02-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>, annually, the hearse for the king, and his altar, were adorned with <num value="100">100</num> tapers, each weighing <measure value="12l." type=currency><num value="12">12</num> pounds</measure>, and <num value="9">nine</num> feet in length; <num value="24">twenty-four</num> almsmen were ranged round it with torches, <measure value="24l." type=currency><num value="24">24</num> pound</measure> in weight. After those were prepared, the bells began to toll, as for the anniversary of Richard the <num value="2">second</num>. 
<p>A procession then commenced through the choir to the high altar, formed by the monks, prior, and abbot, the lord chancellor, lord treasurer, chief justice, master of the rolls, chief baron of the Exchequer, and <num value="5">five</num> other justices, together with the lord mayor, recorder, and sheriffs, of London. The abbot then proceeded to the high altar, and began the mass of <hi rend=italics>requiem</hi>, while the monks knelt before it. The officers of state kneeling before the hearse said the psalm <foreign lang=la>De Profundis</foreign>, with the prayers belonging to the office. 
<p>During those solemnities an almoner distributed <measure value="25bmark" type=currency><num value="25">25</num> marks</measure> to the poor; twopence each to adults, and <num value="1">one</num> penny to children. <measure value="5bmark" type=currency><num value="5">Five</num> marks</measure> beside were divided between <num value="13">13</num> men and <num value="3">3</num> women. 
<p>Previous to those anniversaries, sermons were preached at Paul's cross and the abbey, with an exhortation for the prayers of the congregation. The abbot and convent on the day before went to the high altar, and sung <foreign lang=la>Placebo</foreign> and <foreign lang=la>Dirige</foreign>, with <num value="9">nine</num> lessons, and the lands. 
<p>A weekly obit was also held, preceded by the tolling of the bells. At <num value="3">3</num> o'clock in the afternoon, the abbot and convent went in procession to the choir, and <foreign lang=la>Placebo</foreign>, &amp;c. were sung. 
<p>The hearse had <num value="4">four</num> tapers. <num value="11">eleven</num> feet in length, placed on the middle of each side (to burn perpetually) and <num value="30">30</num> to be lighted only during the obit, mass, and even-song. The sockets were set in crests of roses and portcullises; and the tapers never consumed lower than <num value="4">four</num> feet, when they were replaced. 
<p>After the procession of the convent to the choir for this weekly service, a monk went to the high altar, and sung a mass of requiem, at which <num value="124">124</num> poor people, and <num value="13">13</num> men and <num value="3">3</num> women each received <num value="1">one</num> penny. After the mass, the whole ranged round the hearse, while <foreign lang=la>Libera</foreign> me and <foreign lang=la>De profundis</foreign> were chaunted. Lest all this intercession should not avail, the king founded an almshouse within the precincts of the abbey, for <num value="13">13</num> men and <num value="3">3</num> women; whose frugal meals were hardly earned, as a diary of their employment will shew.

<p>At <num value="6">six</num> o'clock every morning the bell belonging to the chapel of the almshouse was rung by an almsman, beginning the week with the youngest, and so in rotation to the eldest; <num value="1">one</num> half-penny was their reward. Upon this notice, the brethren assembled in their chapel, where they knelt and prayed for the king and his relatives, and for all Christian souls; <num value="5">five</num> paternosters, <num value="5">five</num> aves, and a creed. Hence they proceeded, in the order of their admission, in pairs, followed by their priest, to the altar and hearse, where <num value="6">six</num> kneeled on each side, and the priest at the west end. The <num value="1">first</num> chantry priest then performed the <num value="1">first</num> mass, and the almsmen recited the prayers appointed for them. After this they were permitted to return to their rooms, or remain in the monastery, till high mass began. At <num value="9">9</num> o'clock the alms-priest said a mass at the hearse. They then attended at high mass, and the <num value="3">third</num> chantry mass, when the alms-priest gave an exhortation, and read collects. Previous to their dinner the priest said a grace after the form of Salisbury. When they had dined, <foreign lang=la>De profundis</foreign> was sung, and the king prayed for. Half an hour before vespers in the monastery, the chapel bell rung, upon which the alms-men retired to it, and repeated their paternosters and aves; from thence to the hearse, where they kneeled during even-song, and then retired to their rooms. At <num value="7">7</num> o'clock the chapel bell was rung for the <num value="3">third</num> time, and there they sung <hi rend=italics>Salve Regina</hi>, with other psalms, and repeated prayers. 
<p>As the establishment of those splendid services required constant attendants, <num value="6">six</num> brethren of the monastery,  <QUOTE>commonly called converses,</QUOTE>  were appointed to assist the monks, and take care of the tapers and torches. <num value="2">Two</num> others were appropriated to the new chapel, and the <num value="3">three</num> chantry priests founded by the king.

<p>Henry VII. by his will left his funeral to the discretion of his executors, only charging them to avoid  <QUOTE>dampnable pompe, and outrageous superfluities.</QUOTE>  Whether he pursued his own advice will appear from the decorations on the chapel, altars, and his tomb, exclusive of the anniversaries. 
<p>As he requests the chapel may be finished as soon as possible after his decease, if not then compleated, and particularly mentions that the windows were to be glazed with stories, images, arms, badges, and cognizances, according to the designs given by him to the prior of St. Bartholomew's; and that the walls, doors, windows, vaults, and statues, within and without should be adorned with arms and badges; we may conclude that much remained to be done in the year <datestruct value="1509"><year reg="1509">1509</year></datestruct>, as be died <num value="22">twenty-two</num> days after the date of the will. 
<p>He mentions his having advanced <measure value="5500l." type=currency><num value="5500">5,500</num>l.</measure> to abbot Islip, and authorises his executors to pay other sums to carry on the building of the chapel. 
<p>It is probable his directions in general were strictly complied with; and therefore we must imagine the high altar which was dedicated to  <QUOTE>our lady,</QUOTE>  to have been adorned with the largest statue of the Virgin in his possession, and a cross plated with gold to the value of <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">100</num>l.</measure> and <num value="2">two</num> pair of silver gilt candlesticks. The vestments for the priests given to the abbot and convent were of cloth of gold tissue, embroidered with roses and portcullises, which were made by his order at Florence. They consisted of those for the priest, deacon, and sub-deacon, and <num value="29">29</num> copes. 
<p>The various altars mentioned in the description received each <num value="2">two</num> suits of cloths, <num value="2">two</num> pair of vestments, <num value="2">two</num> corporasses, with their cases, a mass book, a silver-gilt chalice, a pair of silver-gilt cruets, a silver-gilt bell, and <num value="2">two</num> pair of silver-gilt candlesticks. <num value="1">One</num> of them was dedicated to Henry VI. for a pair of candlesticks are expressly given to it. 
<p>The present skreen of his tomb was designed, and the artist employed on it, before this will was written; for he speaks of it as a <pb id="p.16" n="16"> 
<p> <QUOTE>closure of copper and gylte after the fashione that we have begone.</QUOTE>

<p>Such of the altar-cloths and vestments as remained to be given by his executors, were to be made worthy the gifts of a king, and embroidered with his badge and cognizances. 
<p>He ordered that his body should be interred before the high altar, with his wife; and that the tomb should be made of touchstone, with niches, and statues of his guardian saints, in copper, gilt. The inscription to be confined merely to dates. 
<p>Lest his soul might not rest in peace, although every precaution certainly was taken by him, he requested <num value="10000">10,000</num> masses should be said in the monastery, London, and its neighbourhood, for its repose; <datestruct value="1500--"><year reg="1500">1500</year></datestruct> in honour of the Trinity, <num value="2500">2,500</num> in honour of the <num value="5">five</num> wounds of the Lord Jesus Christ, <num value="2500">2,500</num> to the <num value="5">five</num> joys of our lady, <num value="450">450</num> to the <num value="9">nine</num> orders of angels, <num value="150">150</num> to the honour of the patriarchs, <num value="600">600</num> to the <num value="12">twelve</num> apostles, and <num value="2300">2,300</num> to the honour of All Saints, and all those to be sung in a little month after his decease. 
<p>He directed that a statue of himself kneeling, <num value="3">three</num> feet in height from the knees, should be carved in wood, representing him in armour, with a sword, and spurs, and holding the crown of Richard III. won by him at Bosworth-field. 
<p>The figure to be plated with fine gold, and the arms of England and France enamelled on it. A table of silver, gilt, supporting it, enamelled with black letters, <QUOTE lang=la>Rex Henricus Septimus,</QUOTE>was to be placed on the shrine of St. Edward, to whom, with St. Mary and the Almighty, he dedicated the statue.

<p>Mr. Malcolm says, <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>on the <datestruct VALUE="1509-05-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1509">1509</year></datestruct>, the body <pb id="p.17" n="17"> of Henry VII. was placed in a chariot, covered with black cloth of gold, which was drawn by <num value="5">five</num> spirited horses, whose trappings were of black velvet, adorned with quishions of gold. The effigies of his majesty lay upon the corpse, dressed in his regal habiliments. The carriage had suspended on it banners of arms, titles, and pedigrees. A number of prelates preceded the body, who were followed by the deceased king's servants, after it were <num value="9">nine</num> mourners. <num value="600">Six hundred</num> men bearing torches surrounded the chariot. 
<p>The procession was met in St. George's fields, <NOTE>He died at Windsor</NOTE> by all the priests and clergy of London, and its neighbourhood; and at London-bridge by the lord mayor, aldermen, and common council, in black. To render this awful scene sublimely grand, the way was lined with children, who held burning tapers; those, with the flashes of great torches, whose red rays darting in every direction upon glittering objects, and embroidered copes, shewing the solemn pace, uplifted eyes, and mournful countenances, must have formed a noble picture. The slow, monotonous notes of the chaunt, mixed with the sonorous tones of the great bells, were not less grateful to the ear. When the body had arrived at St. Paul's, which was superbly illuminated, it was taken from the chariot, and carried to the choir, where it was placed beneath a hearse, arrayed with all the accompaniments of death. A solemn mass and dirge were then sung, and a sermon preached by the bishop of Rochester. It rested all night in the church. On the following day the procession recommenced in the same manner, except that sir Edward Haward rode before, on a fine charger, clothed with drapery, on which was the king's arms. 
<p>We will now suppose him removed by <num value="6">six</num> lords from his chariot to the hearse prepared for him, formed by <num value="9">nine</num> pillars set full of burning tapers, inclosed by a double railing. View him placed under it, and his effigies on a rich pall of gold, close to him the <num value="9">nine</num> mourners, near them knights bearing banners of saints, and surrounded by officers of arms. The prelates, abbot, prior, and convent, and priests, in measured paces, silently taking their places; when, breaking through the awful pause, Garter king at arms cried with an audible voice,  <Q> for the soul of the noble prince king Henry the <num value="7">seventh</num>, late king of this realm.</Q>  A deep peal from the organ and choir answers in a chaunt of placebo and the dirge; the sounds die away, and with them the whole assembly retires.</QUOTE><NOTE><BIBL>Malcolm's Lond.

<p>Queen Mary, succeeding to the throne in <datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>, dispossessed the cathedral of its dean and prebendaries, and restored the monastery to the order of St. Benedict. In <datestruct value="1556--"><year reg="1556">1556</year></datestruct>, John Feckenham, late dean of St. Paul's, was appointed abbot of Westminster; and, <datestruct VALUE="-11-21"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=21>21</day></datestruct>, with <num value="14">fourteen</num> monks, took possession of the abbey;<NOTE><BIBL>Strype's Ecclesiastical Memorials, vol. iii, p. <num value="309">309</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> and the morrow after, the lord abbot, with his convent, went in procession <pb id="p.19" n="19"> after the old fashion in their monks weeds, in coats of black say, with <num value="2">two</num> vergers carrying <num value="2">two</num> silver rods in their hands.<NOTE>In <datestruct value="1557--"><year reg="1557">1557</year></datestruct>, the Muscovite ambassador attended mass at Westminster-abbey: and afterwards dined with the lord abbot, and went to see St. Edward's shrine new set up: and then saw all the place through.</NOTE>
 
<p>Mr. Malcolm quotes a few lines from a proclamation issued in <datestruct value="1553--"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct> to shew the probable state in which Feckenham found the abbey.

<p>Feckenham possessed considerable talents, and knew how to make the most of a bad argument; he was therefore employed in declaiming from the pulpit against the Protestants. This circumstance occasioned him frequent imprisonments in the reign of queen Elizabeth. Setting aside his zeal in defending that which could not be defended, he was humane, good-natured, and charitable. His speech in the <num value="1">first</num> parliament of Elizabeth against the new Liturgy is a master-piece of sophistry; and his art in dwelling upon the inconsistencies of his opponents is only equalled by his skill in not touching upon untenable points in his own doctrines. 
<p>From <datestruct value="1559--"><year reg="1559">1559</year></datestruct> to the present moment it has remained a collegiate church. Widmore has given a great deal of pleasing information in his short lives of the deans of Westminster.

<p>In the reign of Charles the <num value="1">First</num>, the abbey underwent an assault from the mob (from excess of religion, and zeal in the good old cause;) but they were beaten off, and a sir Richard Wiseman, <num value="1">one</num> of the number, was killed. The ever-to-be-detested parliament of that time, in repeated resolutions, destroyed a great deal, and burnt the sacred vestments; and, under pretence of knowing whether the regalia were in safety, took an opportunity of mocking royalty by dressing a person in the regal ornaments, and finally sold them. Their mad agents contaminated the abbey by what they called exercises of prayer, or rather rancour and virulence. <pb id="p.20" n="20"> 
<p>In the <num value="8">8th</num> and <num value="9">9th</num> years of William III. the house of commons granted an annual sum for repairing it; and in the <num value="9">9th</num> of queen Anne an act passed allowing <measure value="4000l." type=currency><num value="4000">4,000</num>l.</measure> a year towards the same excellent purpose. The like sum was afforded by acts of the <num value="6">6th</num>, <num value="7">7th</num>, <num value="8">8th</num>, and <num value="10">10th</num> of Geo. II. In the year <datestruct value="1738"><year reg="1738">1738</year></datestruct>, however, the works were at a stand, for want of money; and a petition was presented, which was referred to a committee of the whole house. The assistance, however, which was granted, was inconsiderable, and that even was not paid till some time after. 
<p>It appears, says Malcolm, that the dean and chapter had, from the time of their foundation to <datestruct value="1733--"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>, expended <measure value="20912l. 17s. 11d." type=Currency><num value="20912">20,912</num>l. <num value="17">17</num>s. <num value="11">11</num>d.</measure> out of their dividends on the church and its dependencies, and applied the fees for monuments and burials to the fabric. The sums received from shewing the tombs are divided among the gentlemen of the choir and officers of the church. The repairs of Henry the <num value="7">seventh</num>'s chapel are out of their province, and belong to the office of the king's board of works. 
<p>Of the repairs at present making in this venerable abbey, notice will be taken when we come to describe its various architectural beauties and general character.

The <num value="1">first</num> day's performance of the commemoration of Handel took place. The idea of this sublime display of the power of music originated in a conversation at the house of the late Joah Bate, esq. between himself, lord Fitzwilliam, and sir Watkin Williams Wynne, on the grand effect produced by large bands. It is easy to conceive that such a subject would remind them of Handel's chorusses; and thence to that year having completed a century from his birth, and <num value="25">25</num> years from his death. When the plan had assumed some degree of form, the abbey was naturally thought of, as the place best calculated for such a scene, both from Handel having been buried within it, and the venerable air of the structure. His late majesty offered his patronage; and the scheme was laid before the managers of the musical fund, and the directors of the concerts of ancient music. The consent of the dean and chapter was readily obtained, under the easy terms of dividing the <num value="1">first</num> day's profit between the Westminster Infirmary and the musical fund, after which the whole was to be applied to the latter. Mr. Wyatt received directions, from the gentlemen, whose names are recorded in a subsequent page, to erect galleries and seats for the accommodation of the musicians and auditors. He disposed the former in the most judicious manner; and a most imposing effect was produced by the ranges of persons before and on each side of the organ, mixing with the brilliant patriarchs and prophets of the great western painted window. At the eastern extremity of the nave was a display of magnificence, suited to the public appearance of the whole British court, composed of every beauty richly adorned that forms it. The side galleries and platform were crowded with near <num value="4000">4,000</num> persons, whose souls seemed impatient to <pb id="p.21" n="21"> meet the flood of melody ready to burst forth from the voices and instruments towering above them. His majesty and the royal family entered the church at the south-east door; he immediately went into the south transept to view Handels monument, and from thence, preceded by the clergy of the church through the choir, to his throne. Both the king and queen were greatly delighted by the beautiful scene before them, and expressed their approbation in the warmest terms. The instruments used on this occasion, were an excellent organ built by Green, for Canterbury cathedral: <num value="102">102</num> <num value="1">first</num> and <num value="2">second</num> violins, <num value="32">32</num> tenors, <num value="36">36</num> oboes, <num value="30">30</num> violoncellos, <num value="25">25</num> bassoons and <num value="1">1</num> double, <num value="18">18</num> double bases, <num value="14">14</num> trumpets, <num value="3">3</num> trombones, <num value="12">12</num> horns, <num value="4">4</num> drums, and <num value="1">1</num> double. This celebration was continued till <datestruct value="1790"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>, when, the edge of curiosity having been blunted, and the expence a little felt, it was renewed in St. Margaret's church for a year or <num value="2">two</num>, and for the last time in the Banqueting house at Whitehall.<NOTE><BIBL>Malcolm, i. <num value="254">254</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>In <datestruct value="1785--"><year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct>, the church was robbed of the gold fringe from the pulpit-cloth and cushions, and the silver head of the beadle's staff. 
<p>In <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct> the roof of Henry the <num value="7">seventh</num>'s chapel was repaired at an expence of <measure value="1900l." type=currency><num value="1900">1,900</num>l.</measure> which was defrayed out of the revenues of the church. 
<p>The exterior of this magnificent pile being in a sad state of decay, a memorial was addressed to the lords of the treasury, dated Nov. <num value="151806">15,1806</num>, and on the <datestruct VALUE="-12-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct> following, the lords referred it to the committee of taste, in consequence of whose report, and on the petition from the dean and chapter being presented to the house of commons, <measure value="2000l." type=currency><num value="2000">2,000</num>l.</measure> was immediately granted towards the projected repairs. From subsequent reports made to parliament, it appears that <measure value="42028l." type=currency><num value="42028">42,028</num>l.</measure> <measure value="14s." type=currency><num value="14">14</num>s.</measure> <measure value="3.25d." type=currency><num value="3.25">3 1/4</num>d.</measure> was granted by parliament from <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct> to <datestruct VALUE="1822-03--"><month reg="03">March</month> <year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct> for reparations; and on Christmas eve of the last year the scaffolds were struck. In the base of the ornamental dome, which crowns the south-east turret, the following inscription was cut :-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Restored <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, Anno Regni <num value="50">50</num> Geo. III; William Vincent, dean; James Wyatt, architect; Jeremiah Glanville, clerk of the works; Thomas Gayfere, mason.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Similar inscriptions were cut on other turrets. 
<p>The abbey church was nearly destroyed on the <datestruct VALUE="1803-07-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, through the carelessness of some plumbers who were repairing the lanthorn at the junction of the cross; fortunately it broke out in the day time, or the consequences might have been fatal to the whole building. The repairs amounted to <measure value="3500l." type=currency><num value="3500">3,500</num>l.</measure> 
<p>Since the commencement of the present century the repairs of this ancient building has been progressively going on. The exterior of the west side of the north transept has been recently finished in a very satisfactory manner. 
<p>Westminster Abbey has been for many centuries the scene of the <pb id="p.22" n="22"> coronations of our monarchs; want of space prevents the notice of many curious customs now disused in that imposing ceremony, but it would be improper to pass over the

<p>His majesty was, during these preliminary arrangements, in his chamber, near the south entrance into Westminster hall. 
<p>The peers were then called over in the house of lords by deputy garter; and proceeded to the hall, where the other persons appointed to walk in the procession had been previously marshalled on the right and left by the officers of arms; leaving an open passage in the middle, so that the procession with the regalia might pass uninterruptedly up the hall. 
<p>His majesty, preceded by the great officers of state, entered the hall a few minutes after <num value="10">ten</num>, and took his seat in the chair of state at the table, when a gun was fired. The deputy lord great chamberlain, the lord high constable, and the deputy earl marshal, ascended the steps, and placed themselves at the outer side of the table. 
<p>The lord high steward, the great officers, deputy garter, and black rod, arranged themselves near the chair of state; the royal trainbearers on each side of the throne. 
<p>The lord chamberlain, assisted by officers of the jewel-office, then brought the sword.of state to the lord high constable, who delivered it to the deputy lord great chamberlain, by whom it was laid upon the table; then curtana, or the sword of mercy, with the <num value="2">two</num> swords of justice, being in like manner presented, were drawn from their scabbards by the deputy lord great chamberlain, and laid on the table before his majesty; after which the gold spurs were delivered, and also placed on the table. Immediately after, a procession, consisting of the dean and prebendaries of Westminster, in their surplices and rich copes, proceeded up the hall, from the lower end thereof, in manner following :--

<p>In this procession they made their reverences, <num value="1">first</num> at the lower end of the hall, secondly about the middle, where both the choirs opening to the right and left a passage, through which the officers of arms passing opened likewise on each side, the seniors placing themselves nearest towards the steps; then the dean and prebendaries having come to the front of the steps, made their <num value="3">third</num> reverence. This being done, the dean and prebendaries being come to the foot of the steps, deputy garter preceding them (he having waited their coming there) ascended the steps, and approaching near the table before the king, made their last reverence. The dean then presented the crown to the lord high constable, who delivered it to the deputy lord great chamberlain, and it was by him placed on the table before the king. The rest of the regalia was severally delivered by each prebendary, on his knee, to the dean, by him to the lord high constable, by him to the deputy lord great chamberlain, and by him laid on the table. The regalia being thus delivered, the prebendaries and dean returned to the middle of the hall. His majesty having commanded deputy garter to summon the noblemen and bishops who were to bear the regalia, the deputy lord great chamberlain, then taking up the several swords, sceptres, the orb, and crown, placed them in the hands of those by whom they were to be carried.

<p>On the arrival of the procession at the abbey, the herb-woman and her maids, and the serjeant porter, remained at the entrance within the great west door. 
<p>The king entered the west door of the abbey church at <num value="11">eleven</num> o'clock, and was received with the under-mentioned anthem, which was sung by the choir of Westminster, who, with the dean and prebendaries, quitted the procession a little before, and went to the left side of the middle aisle, and remained there till his majesty arrived, and then followed in the procession next to the regalia. 
<p>On his majesty's entering the abbey, the choirs commenced singing the anthem, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>I was glad when they said unto me, we will go into the house of the Lord, &amp;c.<NOTE>Psalm cxxii verses <num value="1">1</num>, <num value="5">5</num>, <num value="6">6</num>. <num value="7">7</num>.</NOTE></QUOTE>
 
<p>During which his majesty passed through the body of the church, and through the choir up the stairs to the theatre. He then passed his throne and made his humble adoration, and afterwards knelt at the faldstool set for him before his chair; at the same time his majesty used some short private prayer; he then sat down (not on his throne, but in his chair before and below his throne) and reposed himself. 
<p>When the king was thus placed, the archbishop of Canterbury turned to the east part of the theatre; then, together with the lord chancellor, lord great chamberlain, lord high constable, and earl marshal (Garter king at arms preceding them), went to the other <num value="3">three</num> sides of the theatre, in the order, south, west, and north, and at each side addressed the people in a loud voice; the king at the same time standing up by his chair, turned and showed himself to the people at each of the <num value="4">four</num> sides of the theatre, while the archbishop spoke as follows :-- <pb id="p.29" n="29"> 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>SIRS, 
<p>I here present unto you King George the <num value="4">Fourth</num>, the undoubted king of this realm; wherefore all you that come this day to do your homage, are ye willing to do the same?</QUOTE>
 
<p>This was answered by the loud and repeated acclamations of the persons present, expressive of their willingness and joy, at the same time they cried out, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>God save King George the <num value="4">Fourth</num>!</QUOTE>
 
<p>Then the trumpets sounded. 
<p>The archbishop in the meantime went to the altar and put on his cope, and placed himself at the north side of the altar; as did also the bishops who took part in the office. 
<p>The officers of the wardrobe, &amp;c. here spread carpets and cushions on the floor and steps of the altar. 
<p>And here, <num value="1">first</num> the Bible, paten, and cup, were brought and placed upon the altar. The king, then, supported by the <num value="2">two</num> bishops of Durham and Bath, and attended by the dean of Westminster, the lords carrying the regalia before him, went down to the altar, and knelt upon the steps of it, and made his <num value="1">first</num> oblation, uncovered. 
<p>Here the pall, or altar-cloth of gold, was delivered by the master of the great wardrobe to the lord great chamberlain, and by him, kneeling, it was presented to his majesty. The treasurer of the household then delivered a wedge of gold of a pound weight to the lord great chamberlain, which he, kneeling, delivered to his majesty. The king then (uncovered) delivered them to the archbishop. 
<p>The archbishop received them <num value="1">one</num> after another (standing) from his majesty, and laid the pall reverently upon the altar. The gold was received into the basin, and, with like reverence, was placed upon the altar. 
<p>Then the archbishop said the following prayer, the king still kneeling:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>O God, who dwellest in the high and holy place, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 
<p>When the king had thus offered his oblation, he went to his chair set for him on the south side of the altar, and knelt at his faldstool, and the Litany commenced, which was read by <num value="2">two</num> bishops, vested in copes, and kneeling at a faldstool above the steps of the theatre, on the middle of the east side; the choir read the responses. 
<p>In the meantime the lords who carried the regalia, except those who bore the swords, approached the altar, and each presented what he carried to the archbishop, who delivered them to the dean of Westminster, who placed them on the altar. They then retired to the places and seats appointed for them. 
<p>The bishops, and the people with them, then said the Lord's Prayer. 
<p>The Communion service was read; the people, kneeling, made the responses to the <num value="10">ten</num> commandments, which were delivered by the archbishop. <pb id="p.30" n="30"> 
<p>Then the archbishop, standing as before, said a collect for the king. 
<p>The following epistle was then read by <num value="1">one</num> of the bishops;-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Submit yourselves to man for the Lord's sake; whether it be to the king as supreme, or unto governors, &amp;c.<NOTE><BIBL>I Pet. ii. <num value="13">13</num>.</BIBL></NOTE></QUOTE>
 
<p>The Gospel was then read by another bishop, the king and the people standing. 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk. And they sent out unto him, &amp;c.<NOTE><BIBL>St. Matth. xxii. <num value="15">15</num>.</BIBL></NOTE></QUOTE>
 
<p>Then the archbishop read the Nicene Creed; the king and the people standing as before. 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>I believe in <num value="1">one</num> God the Father, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 
<p>At the end of the creed, the archbishop of York preached the sermon<NOTE>His text was,  <QUOTE>He that ruleth over men must be just,</QUOTE>  &amp;c. <BIBL><num value="2">2</num> Samuel, chap. <num value="23">23</num>, verse <num value="3">3</num> and <num value="4">4</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> in the pulpit placed against the pillar at the north-east corner of the theatre. The king listened to the same sitting in his chair on the south side of the altar, over against the pulpit. 
<p>His grace commenced the sermon at a quarter past <num value="12">twelve</num>, and ended it about a quarter to <num value="1">one</num>. 
<p>The king was uncovered during the offering and service that followed; when the sermon commenced he put on his cap of crimson velvet turned up with ermine, and remained covered to the end of it. 
<p>On his majesty's right hand stood the bishop of Durham, and beyond him, on the same side, the lords that carried the swords. On his majesty's left hand stood the bishop of Bath and Wells, and the lord great chamberlain. 
<p>On the north side of the altar sat the archbishop of Canterbury in a purple velvet chair; the bishops were placed on forms along the north side of the wall, betwixt the king and the pulpit. Near the archbishop stood Garter, king at arms. On the south side, east of the king's chair, nearer to the altar, stood the dean of Westminster, the rest of the bishops who took part in the church service, and the prebendaries of Westminster. 
<p>When the sermon was concluded, the archbishop went to the king, and standing before him,<NOTE>His majesty, on Thursday, the <datestruct VALUE="1820-04-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>, in the presence of the <num value="2">two</num> Houses of Parliament, made and signed the declaration against popery.</NOTE> administered the coronation oath, <num value="1">first</num> asking the king- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Sir; is your Majesty willing to take the oath? 
<LB>The king answered:--I am willing.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The archbishop then ministered these questions: and the king having a copy of the printed form and order of the coronation service in his hands, answered each question severally, as follows: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Arch. Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the people of this United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and the dominions thereto <pb id="p.31" n="31"> belonging, according to the statutes in parliament agreed on, and the respective laws and customs of the same? 
<p>King. I solemnly promise so to do. 
<p>Arch. Will you to your power cause law and justice, in mercy, to be executed in all your judgments? 
<p>King. I will. 
<p>Arch. Will you to the utmost of your power maintain the laws of God, the true profession of the gospel, and the Protestant Reformed Religion established bylaw? And will you maintain and preserve inviolably the settlement of the United Church of England and Ireland, and the doctrine, worship, discipline, and government thereof, as by law established within England and Ireland, and the territories thereunto belonging? And will you preserve unto the bishops and clergy of England and Ireland, and to the United Church committed to their charge, all such rights and privileges, as by law do, or shall appertain to them, or any of them? 
<p>King. All this I promise to do. 
<p>Then the king, arising out of his chair, and assisted by the lord great chamberlain, the sword of state being carried before him, went to the altar, and there being uncovered, made his solemn oath in the sight of all the people, to observe the premises; laying his right hand upon the Holy Gospel in the great Bible, which was before carried in the procession, and was now brought from the altar by the archbishop, and tendered to him as he knelt upon the steps, saying these words: 
<p>The things which I have here before promised, I will perform and keep. 
<p rend=right>So help me God.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Then the king kissed the hook and signed the oath. 
<p>The king having thus taken his oath, returned again to the chair; and kneeling at his faldstool, the archbishop begun the hymn 
<title lang=la>Veni, Creator Spiritus</title>, and the choir sang it out. 
<p>This being ended, the archbishop said this prayer:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>O Lord Holy Father, who by anointing with oil didst of old make and consecrate kings, priests, and prophets, to teach and govern thy people Israel: bless and sanctify thy chosen servant George, who by our office and ministry is now to be anointed with this oil, and consecrated King of this realm: strengthen him O Lord, with the Holy Ghost the Comforter; Confirm and establish him with thy free and princely spirit, the spirit of wisdom and government, the spirit of counsel and ghostly strength, the spirit of knowledge and true godliness, and fill him, O Lord, with the spirit of thy holy fear, now and for ever. Amen.</QUOTE>
 
<p>This prayer being ended, the choir sang: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, anointed Solomon King; and all the people rejoiced, and said, God save the King Long live the King! May the King live for ever! Amen. Hallelujah!</QUOTE>
 
<p>In the meantime the king, rising from his devotions, went before the altar, supported and attended as before. 
<p>The king sat down in his chair, placed in the midst of the area over against the altar, with the faldstool before it, wherein he was anointed. <num value="4">Four</num> knights of the garter held over him a rich pall of silk, or cloth of gold; the dean of Westminster took the ampula and spoon from off the altar, poured some of the holy oil into the spoon, and with it the archbishop anointed the king, in the form of a cross: <pb id="p.32" n="32"> 
<p><num value="1">1</num>. On the crown of the head, saying, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Be thy head anointed with holy oil, as kings, priests, and prophets were anointed.</QUOTE>
 
<p><num value="2">2</num>. On the breast, saying, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Be thy breast anointed with holy oil.</QUOTE>
 
<p><num value="3">3</num>. On the palms of both the hands, saying, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Be thy hands anointed with holy oil: 
<p>And as Solomon was anointed king by Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, so be you anointed, blessed, and consecrated King over this people, whom the Lord your God hath given you to rule and govern, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Then the dean of Westminster laid the ampula and spoon upon the altar, and the king kneeling down at the faldstool, and the archbishop standing on the north side of the altar, pronounced the benediction:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who by his Father was anointed, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 
<p>This prayer being ended, the king arose, and sat down again in his chair, and the dean of Westminster wiped and dried all the places anointed, with fine linen, or fine bombast wool, delivered to him by the lord great chamberlain; the dean then received from the officers of the wardrobe, the super-tunica of cloth of gold, and a girdle of the same for the sword, with which the dean arrayed his majesty. 
<p>Then the spurs were brought from the altar by the dean of Westminster, and delivered to a nobleman thereto appointed by the king, who, kneeling down, presents them to his majesty, who forthwith sent them back to the altar. 
<p>Then the lord who carried the sword of state, returned the said sword to the officers of the jewel house, which was thereupon deposited in the traverse in king Edward's chapel; he received thence, in lieu thereof, another sword, in a scabbard of purple velvet, provided for the king to be girt withal, which he delivered to the archbishop; and the archbishop, laying it on the altar, said the following prayer: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Hear our prayers, O Lord, we beseech thee, and so direct and support thy servant King George, who is now to be girt with this sword, that he may not bear it in vain; but may use it as the minister of God, for the terror and punishment of evil doers, and for the protection and encouragement of those that do well, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Then the archbishop took the sword from off the altar, and (the bishops assisting, and going along with him) delivered it into the king's right hand, and he holding it, the archbishop said: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Receive this kingly sword, brought now from the altar of God, and delivered to you by the hands of us the bishops and servants of God, though unworthy.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The king stood up, the sword was girt about him by the lord great chamberlain, and then, the king sitting down, the archbishop said: <pb id="p.33" n="33"> 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Remember him of whom the royal Psalmist did prophesy, saying, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Then the king, rising up, ungirded his sword, and, going to the altar, offered it there in the scabbard, and then returned and sat down in his chair: and the chief peer offered the price of it, namely, a <measure value="100s." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> shillings</measure>, and having thus redeemed it, received it from off the altar by the dean of Westminster, and drew it out of the scabbard, and carried it naked before his majesty during the rest of the solemnity. 
<p>Then the king arising, the dean of Westminster took the armill from the master of the great wardrobe, and put it about his majesty's neck, and tied it to the bowings of his arms, above and below the elbows, with silk strings; the archbishop standing before the king, and saying: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Receive this armill as a token of the divine mercy embracing you on every ride.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Next the robe royal, or purple robe of state, of cloth of tissue, lined or furred with ermines, was by the master of the great wardrobe delivered to the dean of Westminster, and by him put upon the king, standing; the crimson robe which he wore before being <num value="1">first</num> taken off by the lord great chamberlain: the king having received it, sat down, and then the orb with the cross was brought from the altar by the dean of Westminster, and delivered into the king's hand by the archbishop, pronouncing this blessing and exhortation : 
<QUOTE rend=center>Receive this imperial robe and orb, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Then the master of the jewel-house delivered the king's ring to the archbishop, in which a table jewel was enchased; the archbishop put it on the <num value="4">fourth</num> finger of his majesty's right hand, and said :-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Receive this ring, the ensign of kingly dignity, and of defence of the Catholic faith, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The king delivered his orb to the dean of Westminster, to be by him laid upon the altar; and then the dean of Westminster brought the sceptre and rod to the archbishop; and the lord of the manor of Worksop (who claimed to hold an estate by the service of presenting to the king a right hand glove on the day of his coronation, and supporting the king's right arm whilst he holds the sceptre with the cross) delivered to the king a pair of rich gloves, and on any occasion happening afterwards, supported his majesty's right arm, or held his sceptre by him. 
<p>The gloves being put on, the archbishop delivered the sceptre, with the cross, into the king's right hand, saying, 
<p>Receive the royal sceptre, the ensign of kingly power and justice. 
<p>And then he delivered the rod, with the dove, into the king's left hand, and said, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Receive the rod of equity and mercy and God, from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and all just works do proceed, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 <pb id="p.34" n="34"> 
<div2 type=section id="c.1.3"><HEAD>The Crowning.</HEAD>
 
<p>The archbishop, standing before the altar, took the crown into his hands, and laying it again before him upon the altar, said, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>O God, who crownest thy faithful servants with mercy and loving kindnesses, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Then the king sat down in king Edward's chair; the archbishop, assisted with other bishops, came from the altar; the dean of Westminster brought the crown, and the archbishop taking it of him, reverently put it upon the king's head. At the sight whereof the people, with loud and repeated shouts, cried,  <QUOTE>God save the king!</QUOTE>  and the trumpets sounded, and, by a signal given, the great guns at the Tower were shot off. 
<p>The noise ceasing, the archbishop rose and said, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Be strong and of good courage: observe the commandments of God, and walk in his holy ways: fight the good fight of faith, and lay hold on eternal life; that in this world you may be crowned with success and honour, and when you have finished your course, you may receive a crown of righteousness, which God the righteous Judge shall give you in that day. Amen.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Then the choir sung this short anthem:-- 
<QUOTE rend=center>The King shall rejoice in thy strength, O Lord, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 
<p>As soon as the king was crowned, the peers, bishops, &amp;c. put on their coronets and caps. 
<p>The dean of Westminster took the Holy Bible, which was carried in the procession, from off the altar, and delivered it to the archbishop, who, with the rest of the bishops going along with him, presented it to the king, <num value="1">first</num> saying these words to him:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Our gracious King; we present unto your Majesty this book, the most valuable thing that this world affordeth, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Then the king delivered back the Bible to the archbishop, who gave it to the dean of Westminster, to be reverently placed again upon the holy altar. 
<p>And now the king having been thus anointed and crowned, and having received all the ensigns of royalty, the archbishop solemnly blessed him, and all the bishops standing about him, with the rest of the peers, with a loud and hearty Amen. 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>The Lord bless and keep you: the Lord make the light of his countenance to shine forever upon you, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Then the archbishop turned to the people and said:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>And the same Lord God Almighty grant, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The blessing being thus given, the king sat down in his chair, and vouchsafed to kiss the archbishop and bishops assisting at his coronation, they kneeling before him <num value="1">one</num> after another. 
<p>Then the choir began to sing the <foreign lang=la>Te Deum</foreign>, and the king went up to the theatre on which the throne is placed, all the bishops, great officers, and other peers, attending him, and then he sat down and reposed himself in his chair, below the throne. <pb id="p.35" n="35"> 
<p>The <foreign lang=la>Te Deum</foreign> being ended, the king was lifted up into his throne by the archbishop and bishops, and other peers of the kingdom. And being inthronized or placed therein, all the great officers, those that bore the swords and the sceptres, and the rest of the nobles, stood round about the steps of the throne, and the archbishop standing before the king, said, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Stand fast and hold from henceforth, the seat and imperial dignity which is this day delivered unto you in the name, and by the authority of Almighty God, and by the hands of us the bishops and servants of God, though unworthy; and as you see us approach nearer to God's altar, so vouchsafe the more graciously to continue to us your royal favour and protection. And the Lord God Almighty, whose ministers we are, and the stewards of his mysteries, establish your throne in righteousness, that it may stand fast for evermore, like as the sun before Him, and as the faithful witness in heaven. Amen.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The exhortation being ended, all the peers present did homage publicly and solemnly unto the king upon the theatre, and in the meantime the treasurer of the household threw among the people medals of gold and silver, as the king's princely largess or donative. 
<p>The archbishop <num value="1">first</num> knelt down before his majesty's knees, and the rest of the bishops knelt on either hand, and about him; and they did their homage together, for the shortening of the ceremony, the archbishop saying:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>I Charles archbishop of Canterbury [and so every <num value="1">one</num> of the rest, I.

And I will do, and truly acknowledge the service of the lands which I claim to hold of you, as in right of the church.--So help me God.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Then the archbishop kissed the king's left cheek, and so the rest of the bishops present after him. 
<p>After which the other peers of the realm did their homage in like manner, the dukes <num value="1">first</num> by themselves, and so the marquesses, the earls, the viscounts, and the barons, severally; the <num value="1">first</num> of each order kneeling before his majesty, and the rest with and about him, all putting off their coronets, and the <num value="1">first</num> of each class beginning, and the last saying after him:--

<p>The peers having done their homage, they stood all together round about the king; and each class or degree going by themselves, or (as it was at the coronation of king Charles the <num value="1">First</num> and <num value="2">Second</num>) every peer <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, in order, put off their coronets, singly ascended the throne again, and stretching forth their hands, touched the crown on his majesty's head, as promising by that ceremony to be ever ready to support it with all their power, and then every <num value="1">one</num> of them kissed the king's cheek. 
<p>While the peers were thus doing their homage, and the medals thrown about, the king delivered his sceptre with the cross to the <pb id="p.36" n="36"> lord of the manor of Worksop, to hold; and the other sceptre, or rod, with the dove, to the lord that carried it in the procession. 
<p>And the bishops that supported the king in the procession also eased him, by supporting the crown, as there was occasion. 
<p>While the medals were scattered, and the homage of the lords performed, the choir sung the anthem, with instrumental music of all sorts, as a solemn conclusion of the king's coronation. 
<QUOTE rend=center>Blessed be thou, Lord God of Israel, our Father, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 
<p>At the end of this anthem the drums beat, and the trumpets sounded, and all the people shouted, crying out, 
<QUOTE rend=center>God save King George the <num value="4">Fourth</num>! 
<LB>Long live King George! 
<LB>May the King live for ever!</QUOTE>
 
<p>The solemnity of the king's coronation being thus ended, the archbishop left the king in his throne, and went down to the altar. 
<p>Then the offertory began, the archbishop reading these sentences:-- 
<QUOTE rend=center>Let your light so shine before men; &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The king descended from his throne, supported and attended as before, and went to the steps of the altar, and knelt down there. 
<p>At <num value="1">first</num> the king offered bread and wine for the communion, which were brought out of king Edward's chapel, and delivered into his hands, the bread upon the paten by the bishop that read the Epistle, and the wine in the chalice by the bishop that read the Gospel; these were by the archbishop received from the king, and reverently placed upon the altar, and decently covered with a fair linen cloth, the archbishop <num value="1">first</num> saying this prayer:-- 
<QUOTE rend=center>Bless, O Lord, we beseech thee, these thy gifts, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Then the king kneeling, as before, made his <num value="2">second</num> oblation, offering a mark weight of gold, which the treasurer of the household delivered to the lord great chamberlain, and he to his majesty. And the archbishop came to him, and received it in the basin, and placed it upon the altar. After which the bishop said:-- 
<QUOTE rend=center>O God, who dwellest in the high and holy place, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Then the king returned to his chair, and knelt down at his faldstool; the archbishop said : 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Let us pray for the whole state of Christ's church militant here on earth. 
<p>Almighty and ever living God, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 
<p>After the prayer of consecration, the archbishop, and dean of Westminster, with the bishops' assistants, namely, the preacher, and those who read the Litany, and the Epistle and Gospel, had communicated in both kinds, the archbishop administered the bread, and the dean of Westminster the cup, to the king. 
<p>At the delivery of the bread, was said, 
<QUOTE rend=center>The body of our Lord Jesus Christ, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 
<p>At the delivery of the cup, <pb id="p.37" n="37"> 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>The blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was shed for the preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life. Drink this in remembrance that Christ's blood was shed <hi rend=italics>for</hi> thee, and be thankful.</QUOTE>
 
<p>While the king received, the bishop appointed for that service held a towel of white silk, or fine linen, before him. 
<p>Then the archbishop went on to the post communion, saying, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Our Father which art in Heaven, &.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Then this prayer, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>O Lord and heavenly Father, &amp;c.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The king returned to his throne upon the theatre, and afterwards the archbishop read the final prayers. 
<p>The whole coronation office being thus performed, the king, attended and accompanied as before, the <num value="4">four</num> swords being carried before him, descended from his throne crowned, and carrying the sceptre and rod in his hands, went up to the area eastward of the theatre, and passed on through the door, on the south side of the altar, into king Edward's chapel; and as they passed by the altar, the rest of the regalia lying upon it were delivered by the dean of Westminster to the lords that carried them in the procession, and so they proceeded in state into the chapel; the organ all the while playing. 
<p>The king then came into the chapel, and standing before the altar, took off his crown, and delivered it, together with his sceptre, to the archbishop, who laid them upon the altar there; and the rest of the regalia were given into the hands of the dean of Westminster, and by him laid there also. 
<p>Then the king withdrew himself into his traverse prepared for him upon the western wall of that chapel. 
<p>Within his traverse the king was disrobed by the lord great chamberlain of his royal robe of slate (which was forthwith delivered to the dean of Westminster to be laid also upon the altar)and again arrayed with his robe of purple velvet, which was before laid ready in the traverse for that purpose. 
<p>When the king, thus habited, came forth of his traverse, he stood before the altar, and the archbishop being still vested in his cope, set the crown of slate, provided for the king to wear during the rest of the ceremony, upon his head. Then he gave the sceptre with the cross into the king's right hand, and the orb with the cross into his left; which being done, both the archbishop and dean divested themselves of their copes, and left them there, and proceeded in their usual habits. 
<p>Then the king carried his sceptre with the cross in his left hand, the <num value="4">four</num> swords being borne before the king, and the heralds having again put the rest of the procession in order, he went on from king Edward's chapel to the theatre, and thence through the midst of the choir and body of the church, out at the west door, and so returned to Westminster-hall. <pb id="p.38" n="38"> 
<p>At about <num value="20">twenty</num> minutes to <num value="4">four</num> the gates of the hall were thrown open to admit the procession on its return. 
<p>Viewed from the upper end of the hall through the arched way, the appearance of the white plumes of the knights of the Bath was most magnificent. On their entrance to the hall, the knights took off their hats, but the peers continued to wear their coronets. The procession then entered in the following order :--

<p>As the procession entered the hall, the fifes, drums, and trumpets went to their gallery, and the several other persons composing it were directed to their respective places by the officers of arms. 
<p>On entering the hall, the barons of the Cinque Ports, bearing the canopy, remained at the bottom of the steps. His majesty ascended the elevated platform, and retired in his chamber near the state. 
<p>The company at the table then sat down; and the barons of the Cinque Ports carried away the canopy as their fee. 
<p>It is mentioned above that the several orders of knighthood returned wearing their hats. This was the case until they got to the entrance of Westminster-hall. There all the knights of the Bath took off their hats, as did some of the bishops and several other individuals who took part in the procession. There were only <num value="2">two</num> knights of the Garter who appeared in the full dress of the order. These were his royal highness the prince Leopold and the marquess of Londonderry. The noble marquess, as attired in his robes, added very considerably to the splendour of the scene by his graceful and elegant appearance. His lordship's hat was encircled with a band of diamonds, which had a most brilliant effect. As his majesty passed up the hall he was received with loud and continued acclamations, the gentlemen waving their hats, and the ladies their handkerchiefs; his majesty seemed to feel sensibly the enthusiasm with which he was greeted, and returned the salutation with repeated bows to the assemblage on both sides. The peers took their seats at the table appointed for them, and began to partake of 
<div2 type=section id="c.1.4"><HEAD>The Banquet.</HEAD>
 
<p>Precisely at <num value="20">twenty</num> minutes past <num value="5">five</num> the great lord chamberlain issued his orders that the centre of the hall should be cleared. This direction occasioned much confusion, not only because many strangers had been allowed to enter the lower doors for the <pb id="p.41" n="41"> purpose of surveying the general arrangements, but because those who had tickets for the galleries had descended in considerable numbers to the floor. Lord Gwydyr was under the necessity of personally exerting his authority, with considerable vehemence, in order to compel the attendants of the earl-marshal to quit situations intended for persons more immediately connected with the ceremony. A long interval now occurred, during which the various officers, and especially the heralds, made the necessary arrangements for the nobility expected to return with his majesty. During this pause silence was generally preserved, in expectation of the return of his majesty from the chamber. 
<p>The entrance of the king was announced by <num value="1">one</num> of the principal heralds, who was followed into the hall by the lord great chamberlain and the dukes of York, Clarence, Cambridge, Sussex, and Gloucester. Prince Leopold had for some time previously been engaged in conversation with the foreign ambassadors. 
<p>His majesty returned in the robes with which he had been invested in the abbey, wearing also the same crown. In his right hand he carried the sceptre, and in his left the orb, which, on taking his seat on the throne, he delivered to <num value="2">two</num> peers stationed at his side for the purpose of receiving them. 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> course was then served up. It consisted of <num value="24">twenty-four</num> gold covers and dishes, carried by as many gentlemen pensioners: they were preceded by <num value="6">six</num> attendants on the clerk comptroller, by <num value="2">two</num> clerks of the kitchen, who received the dishes from the gentlemen pensioners, by the clerk comptroller, in a velvet gown trimmed with silver lace, by <num value="2">two</num> clerks and the secretary of the board of green cloth, by the comptroller and treasurer of the household, and serjeants at arms with their maces. 
<p>Before the dishes were placed upon the table by the <num value="2">two</num> clerks of the kitchen, the great doors at the bottom of the hall were thrown open to the sound of trumpets and clarionets, and the duke of Wellington as lord high constable, the marquis of Anglesey, as lord high steward, and lord Howard of Effingham, as deputy earl marshal, entered upon the floor on horseback, remaining for some minutes under the archway. The duke of Wellington was on the left of the king, the earl marshal on the right, and the marquess of Anglesey in the centre. The <num value="2">two</num> former were mounted on beautiful white horses gorgeously trapped, and the latter on his favourite dun-coloured Arabian. 
<p>Before the <num value="2">second</num> course, the great gate was thrown open at the sound of trumpets without. The deputy appointed to officiate as king's champion for the lord of the manor of Scrivelsby, in Lincolnshire, entered the hall on horseback, in a complete suit of bright armour, between the lord high constable and deputy earl marshal, also on horseback, preceded by

<p>Then followed:--

<ROW>

<CELL rend=center>The Deputy Earl Marshal, on Horseback, in his Robes and Coronet, with the Earl Marshal's Staff in his Hand, attended by a Page.</CELL>

<CELL rend=center>The <emph>Champion</emph>, on Horseback, in a complete suit of bright Armour, with a Gauntlet in his Hand, his Helmet on his Head, adorned with a plume of Feathers.</CELL>

<CELL rend=center>The Lord High Constable, in his Robes and Coronet, and Collar of his Order, on Horseback, with the Constable's Staff, attended by <num value="2">two</num> Pages.</CELL></ROW>
 
<ROW><CELL cols=3 rend=center><num value="4">Four</num> Pages, richly apparelled, attendants on the Champion.</CELL></ROW>

</TABLE>
 
<p>His helmet was of polished steel, surmounted by a full rich bending plume of white ostrich feathers, next of light blue, next red, and lastly of an erect black feather. He seemed rather pale in the face, which was of a resolute cast, and ornamented with handsome mustachios. He sat his horse with ease, and the appearance of great firmness, which was no doubt in part attributable to the enormous weight under which the noble animal that bore him seemed to bend. His armour was extremely massive, and deeply lined and engraven: no part of his body was uncovered; and even the broad circular shoulder blades of the armour were so folded over the cuirass, that in action the body could not but be completely defended at all points. The horse was very richly caparisoned, and wore in his headstall a plume of varied feathers. Nothing could exceed the impression produced by the approach of the champion and his loyal array. Every fair bosom felt an indescribable sensation of mingled surprise, pleasure, and apprehension. 
<p>At the entrance into the hall the trumpets sounded thrice, and the passage to the king's table being cleared by the knight marshal, the herald, with a loud voice, proclaimed the champion's challenge in the words following: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>If any person of what degree soever, high or low, shall deny or gainsay our Sovereign Lord <name>George</name> the <num value="4">Fourth</num> of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, Son and next Heir to our Sovereign Lord King <name>George</name> the <num value="3">Third</num>, the last King, deceased, to be right Heir to the Imperial Crown of this United Kingdom, or that he ought not to enjoy the same, here is his Champion, who saith that he lieth, and is a false traitor; being ready in person to combat with him, and in this quarrel will adventure his life against him what day soever he shall be appointed.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The champion then threw down his iron glove or gauntlet; which, having lain for a short time upon the ground, the herald took up, and delivered again to the champion. 
<p>They then advanced to the middle of the hall, where the ceremony was again performed in the same manner. 
<p>Lastly, they advanced to the steps of the throne, where the herald (and those who preceded him) ascending to the middle of the <pb id="p.43" n="43"> steps, proclaimed the challenge in the like manner; when the champion, having thrown down the gauntlet, and received it again from the herald, made a low obeisance to the king. The peers had repeated, as if with <num value="1">one</num> voice,  <QUOTE>God bless the king! God save the king!</QUOTE>  which was accompanied by acclamations so loud through all parts of the hall, that it startled the horses of the champion and his noble companions. Then the cupbearer, having received from the officer of the jewel-house a gold cup and cover filled with wine, presented the same to the king, and his majesty drank to the champion, and sent to him by the cupbearer the said cup, which he (having put on his gauntlet) received, and having made a low obeisance to the king, drank off the wine; and in a loud articulate voice, exclaimed, turning himself round,  <QUOTE>Long life to his Majesty King GEORGE the <num value="4">Fourth</num> I</QUOTE>  This was followed by another peal of applause; after which, making another low obeisance to his majesty, and being accompanied as before, he departed out of the hall, taking with him the said cup and cover as his fee, retiring with his face to his majesty, and backing his horse out of the hall. 
<p>Immediately afterwards, Garter, attended by Clarienceux, Norroy, Lyon, Ulster, and the rest of the kings and officers of arms, proclaimed his majesty's styles in Latin, French, and English, <num value="3">three</num> several times, <num value="1">first</num> upon the uppermost step of the elevated platform, next in the middle of the hall; and, lastly, at the bottom of the hall, the officers of arms before each proclamation, crying,  <QUOTE>Largesse.</QUOTE>  After each proclamation, the company shouted  <QUOTE>God save the King!</QUOTE>  and the ladies waved their handkerchiefs and fans. 
<p>The <num value="2">second</num> course was then served up with the same ceremony as the <num value="1">first</num>. 
<p>Then the lord of the manor of Nether Bilsington presented his majesty with <num value="3">three</num> maple cups. 
<p>The office of chief butler of England was executed by the duke of Norfolk, as earl of Arundel and lord of the manor of Keninghall, who received a gold basin and ewer as his fee. 
<p>Dinner being concluded, the lord mayor and <num value="12">twelve</num> principal citizens of London, as assistants to the chief butler of England, accompanied by the king's cupbearer and assistant, presented to his majesty wine in a gold cup; and the king having drunk thereof, returned the gold cup to the lord mayor as his fee. 
<p>The mayor of Oxford, with the <num value="8">eight</num> other burgesses of that city, as assistants to the lord mayor and citizens of London, as assistant to the chief butler of England in the office of butler, were conducted to his majesty, preceded by the king's cupbearer, and having presented to the king a bowl of wine, received the <num value="3">three</num> maple cups for his fee. 
<p>The lord of the manor of Lyston, pursuant to his claim, then brought up a charger of wafers to his majesty's table. 
<p>The duke of Athol, as lord of the Isle of Man, presented his majesty with <num value="2">two</num> falcons. Considerable curiosity was excited by the <pb id="p.44" n="44"> presentment of these beautiful birds, which sat perfectly tame on the arm of his grace, completely hooded, and furnished with bells. 
<p>The duke of Montrose, as master of the horse to the king, performed the office of serjeant of the silver scullery. 
<p>The lord of the barony of Bedford performed the office of almoner; and the office of chief larderer was performed by the deputy of the earl of Abergavenny. 
<p>After the dessert was served up, the king's health was announced by the peers, and drank by them and the whole of the persons in the nail standing, with <num value="3">three</num> times <num value="3">three</num>. The lord chancellor, overpowered by his feelings on this propitious occasion, rose, and said it was usual to drink the health of a subject with <num value="3">three</num> limes <num value="3">three</num>, and he thought that his subjects ought to drink the sovereign's health with <num value="9">nine</num> times <num value="9">nine</num>. The choir and additional singers had now been brought forward in front of the knights commanders, and the national anthem of  <QUOTE>God save the King</QUOTE>  was sung with incomparable effect. 
<p>The duke of Norfolk then said,  <QUOTE>The king thanks his peers for drinking his health: he does them the honour to drink their health and that of his good people.</QUOTE>  His majesty rose, and bowing <num value="3">three</num> times to various parts of the immense concourse- 
<QUOTE rend=center><L part=f>The abstract of his kingdom,</QUOTE>
 he drank the health of all present. It was succeeded by long and continued shouts from all present, during which the king resumed his seat on the throne. 
<p>The king quitted the hall at a quarter before <num value="8">eight</num> o'clock; afterwards the company was indiscriminately admitted to partake of such refreshments as remained on the tables of the peers. 
<p>During Tuesday and Wednesday night, in order that no unnecessary interruption might be experienced in the public thoroughfares during the daytime, the workmen under the direction of the Board of Works were busily engaged in raising barriers at different points that commanded the streets and passes leading to Westminster hall and abbey. From Charing Cross, a stout barrier was placed (about <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet from the pavement) to Parliament-street, that the fullest possible room, about <num value="20">twenty</num> feet in width, should be secured for persons having tickets of admission to the hall, the abbey, or the coronation galleries. And a still stronger barrier was raised along the centre of Parliament-street, <num value="1">one</num> side only being appropriated to carriages going towards the scene of universal attraction. Across Bridge-street, as well as in King-street, and the neighbouring thoroughfares, all the carriage entrances were wholly blockaded; thus securing the most commodious means to persons proceeding on foot to the different places for which they possessed admission tickets. At all these points were stationed constables, supported by parties of military; and at the several passes were placed experienced individuals who had been instructed in their <pb id="p.45" n="45"> various duties during several days by Mr. Jackson and others, in the long chambers of the house of lords, &amp;c.

<p><FIGURE id="Fig.048.1"><HEAD>Westminster Abbey</HEAD></FIGURE>
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> object that demands attention, in surveying the exterior of this building, is the principal entrance. This is at the west end, <pb id="p.49" n="49"> and, taken as a whole, makes rather a mean appearance. The great doorway is of considerable depth, and contracts inwards. The sides are composed of pannels, and the roof intersected with numerous ribs. On each side of the door are pedestals in empty niches, with shields in quatrefoils beneath them. A cornice extends over the whole, on which are <num value="10">ten</num> niches separated by small buttresses: they are without statues, and their canopies are cones foliaged and pinnacled. Above those is a modern cantilever cornice, totally unfit for the design. The king's and <num value="8">eight</num> other coats of arms adorn the frieze above it. 
<p>Hence arises the great painted window; it has a border of <num value="8">eight</num> pointed enriched pannels; a large heavy cornice over it; and a frieze inscribed A. R. GEORGII II. VIII. MDCCXXXV. The roof is pointed, and contains a small window, with tracery. <num value="2">Two</num> great buttresses strengthen the towers, and are grand ornaments: with <num value="2">two</num> ranges of canopied niches (unfortunately deprived of their statues) on their fronts. Each tower has projecting wings, pannelled. The lower windows are pointed; those above them arches only, filled with quatrefoils and circles. It is from this part that the incongruity of the new design begins in a Tuscan cornice; then a Grecian pediment, and enrichments over the dial of the clock, a poor, tame window, pannels, and battlements. The truly great and excellent architect, sir Christopher Wren, reprobates irreconcilable mixtures in designing, thus:  <QUOTE> I shall speedily prepare draughts and models, such as I conceive proper to agree with the original scheme of the architect, without any modern mixtures to shew my own inventions.</QUOTE> <NOTE>Letter to the Bishop of Rochester.</NOTE>
 
<p>The ancient front of the Jerusalem Chamber obstructs the view of the south tower; it has a square window, divided by an horizontal and <num value="3">three</num> upright mullions ; with a battlement repaired with bricks. The wall extends some distance westward, when it terminates in modernized houses, against whose end is the ruin of a great arch of decayed stone, abutting on the turning to Dean's Yard, being the last remains of the Gate-house. 
<p>The architectural anomalies displayed in this front are peculiarly remarkable: and they are still more apparent in the towers than in the central division. This arises from the heightening of the towers and the other alterations made here, during the general repair, which was commenced in the reign of king William, anno <datestruct value="1697"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct>, but not ended till several years after the accession of George II. The credit of completing the west front, as it anciently appeared, is due to the abbots Estney and Islip; but it was never entirely finished till the time of the latter sovereign.  <QUOTE> It is evident,</QUOTE>  says sir Christopher Wren, in his architectural report, addressed to bishop Atterbury,  <QUOTE>that the <num value="2">two</num> towers were left imperfect, the <num value="1">one</num> much higher than the other, though still too low for bells, which are stifled by the height of the roof above them; they ought <pb id="p.50" n="50"> certainly to be carried to an equal height, <num value="1">one</num> story above the ridge of the roof, still continuing the Gothic manner in the stone work, and tracery. Something must be done to strengthen the west window, which is crazy; the pediment is only boarded, but ought undoubtedly to be of stone.</QUOTE>  
<p>The north side of the church has <num value="9">nine</num> buttresses, each of <num value="5">five</num> gradations, with windows to the side aisles; and over them semi-windows, filled with quatrefoils. The buttresses are connected to the nave by slender arches; the wall finishes with battlements. The niches on the buttresses all remain, though there are but <num value="4">four</num> statues, which appear but little injured, and are certainly excellent figures. They represent abbot Islip, James I. and <num value="2">two</num> other sovereigns, probably Edward the Confessor and Henry III. What sir Christopher Wren said of the north side, upwards of <num value="100">100</num> years past, is strictly descriptive at this moment;  <QUOTE>but that which is most to be lamented, is the unhappy choice of the materials. The stone is decayed <num value="4">four</num> inches deep, and falls off perpetually in great scales.</QUOTE>  And so indeed hath the casing intended to repair it from the north transept to the towers, leaving a decayed, corroded, and weatherbeaten surface, half black, and half the colour of the stones. The front of the transept is less injured, because most of the heavy rains are from the west; and the north-east sides remain perfectly smooth and good, as sir Christopher Wren left them. 
<p>The great door is an arch sprung from <num value="4">four</num> large pillars on each side, whose capitals are singularly beautiful foliage. Within them is a range of <num value="10">ten</num> circles inclosing stars on the roof, and on the sides arched pannels. The wall is of considerable thickness, adorned by <num value="6">six</num> columns on both sides, with the same number of mouldings. It is remarkable that all the tops of the doors are flat, both in this and the smaller arches. The space over the principal entrance has a vast circle of circles, within which is another of pointed pannels; and in a <num value="3">third</num> others, with the arms of Edward the Confessor, for a centre. In <num value="2">two</num> small circles at the bottom are portcullises. On either side of the great door the wall is formed into <num value="2">two</num> arches by handsome pillars; the lesser entrances to the aisles are <num value="4">four</num> pillars in depth, with ribbed roofs, and angels on the intersections; over the door are circles inclosing cinquefoils. Above the whole is a range of pierced arches. <num value="4">Four</num> enormous buttresses secure the front, those at the angles terminate in octagons, and connect with the upper part of the walls, over the side aisles, by strong arches. 
<p>For nearly <num value="300">three hundred</num> years, this must have been the principal entrance into the church, and all the stately processions associated with the rites of the Roman Catholic worship, all the pompous trains assembled to grace coronations, and the burials of our sovereigns, must have been ushered beneath its porch, to give interest to the solemnities within.<NOTE><BIBL>Neale and Brayley's Westminster abbey, vol ii. p <num value="9">9</num></BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>It is unnecessary to describe the windows, as their shape is the ZZZ SO FAR <pb id="p.51" n="51"> same as others in the church. The colonnade of arches, and deep recesses, have a fine effect, as well as the point of the roof, which is divided into pannelled arches, with circles and quatrefoils over them. 
<p>Between the colonnade and the point of the roof is a beautiful rose window, which was rebuilt in <datestruct value="1722--"><year reg="1722">1722</year></datestruct>.<NOTE>The entire height of this front to the top of the centre pinnacle, is <num value="170">170</num> feet.</NOTE>
 
<p>All the chapels that project on the north east and south east are, in their designs, like the body of the church. The western wall of the north transept is rebuilding at the present time (A. D. <datestruct value="1828"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>), under the judicious superintendence of Mr. Blore, the architect. 
<p>The repairs on the south side of the abbey <hi rend=italics>are</hi> still perfect. The chapter-house was injudiciously placed by the architect, as it hides all the south end of the transept; and it was certainly never sufficiently enriched to make it worthy of the intruder. It is an octagon, protected to the east by a vast pierced buttress, with very large pointed windows, now filled up; they had each <num value="1">one</num> mullion in the shape of the letter Y. Several windows of the common size are made in them, but appear very diminutive by comparison; those could have been introduced for no other reason than to save expence; so far they are to be preferred to the ancient. The front of the south transept is far less elegant than that of the north; this incongruity is rendered of little consequence by the confined nature of its situation, the library, chapter house, and cloisters being so immediately contiguous as to exclude all the lower part from public view. It is sustained by <num value="4">four</num> large buttresses, each terminating in a plain octagon tower, crowned by a ball. There is no porch, but over the place is a range of <num value="6">six</num> narrow pointed windows; above them are <num value="3">three</num> larger; and the next compartment displays the great rose or marygold window, which is very elaborate in tracery, and far superior to the <num value="1">one</num> in the opposite transept. In the early part of the present century it was found to be so craggy and ruinous, that the dean and chapter gave orders for its restoration, and the present window was constructed under the superintendence of Benjamin Wyatt, esq. by Mr. Thomas Gayfere. It is glazed with plain glass; in the centre, which is a quatrefoil, is the date of erection, <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>. All the buttresses on the south side of the nave, for the length of the cloister, being <num value="6">six</num> in number, have their bases without the walls of the cloister, consequently it is only by their weight that they remain erect, and at the same time support the wall of the church by slender arches, whose insertions are so managed as to send all the pressure downward. This manner of  <QUOTE>contriving them,</QUOTE>  sir Christopher Wren says, was the work of a  <QUOTE>bold, but ignorant architect, and for the purpose of flattering the humour of the monks.</QUOTE>  How an unobstructed space close against the side of the church could have been otherwise procured, I cannot perceive; but, supposing it could, I do not see the architect's ignorance in acting as he has; for I really believe the specific <pb id="p.52" n="52"> gravity of each mass of abutment to be equal to double the pressure now experienced by it. But as conclusive evidence, he adds, that the walls above the windows were forced out <num value="10">ten</num> inches, and  <QUOTE>the ribs broken.</QUOTE>  This I do not deny; but query, what has caused the same derangement directly opposite, on the north side; where, I aver, the wall is actually in a waved line, and where the abutments are firm against the wall? I am afraid that against the cloisters, on every side, from repeated interments, there is no solid support for either walls or abutments. Whether, any settling has occurred from this circumstance on both sides of the church, it would be well worth consideration to enquire. The remainder of the buttresses, to the tower, are close to the wall. All the exterior walls of the edifice are embattled, and the roof is covered with lead. The central tower, which has a dwarfish, and unfinished aspect, was rebuilt after the fire here in <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>. It has <num value="2">two</num> narrow pointed windows on each side, and the angles are finished octagonally. 
<p>The entrance of the cloisters is from Dean's-yard. Great part of the neighbouring walls are of the original buildings; and where our present ideas of convenience have not introduced sashed windows, or other alterations, they bear all the marks of venerable age and decay. 
<p>It cannot be denied that our plans of economy are hostile to large and enriched structures at the present day. It was different with our ancestors; they certainly did sacrifice comfort to splendour. Witness the vast halls in their mansions, which it is impossible ever could have been warm; with elevated windows never more than partially opened: thus retaining in them the humid vapours continually floating in our atmosphere from August to March. 
<p>To deny that our castles and baronial residences, our abbeys and cathedrals and many of the ancient parish churches, were grand, lasting, and sublime, is impossible; and to assert that we erect any thing equally excellent and durable now, is equally impossible. Therefore it is that I would preserve their ruins, and when practicable, restore them to their original design by repairs. 
<p> <QUOTE>Once enter the cloisters,</QUOTE>  says Mr. Malcolm, <QUOTE><p>and I would have even every ornament restored, and the same through the whole church; for, with justice do I dread, such another will never rise on its ruins. Dean's-yard is certainly an odd mixture of decayed grandeur, modern ruins, strong old flinty walls, and crumbling new bricks. Even the very trees nod in unison with fallen structures and broken rails; and the earth, in many a rise and fall, shews some remote effects of Henry the <num value="8">eighth</num>'s dissolution of monasteries. There is a silent monastic air in the small court from which is the entrance to the Jerusalem chamber, 
<NOTE>This chamber is noted for having been <corr sic="teh">the</corr> place where Henry the IVth. breathed his last. Shakespeare in <num value="1">one</num> of his plays thus notices it:-- <pb n="p.53"> 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Laud be to God even there my life must end; 
<L>It hath been prophesied to me many years, 
<L>I should not die but in Jerusalem, 
<L>Which vainly I suppos'd the Holy Land!</QUOTE></NOTE> now extremely <pb id="p.53" n="53"> different from its ancient state, having undergone various alteration from the Reformation to the present time. It is used for a chapter-house. The picture of Richard the <num value="2">Second</num>, so often engraved, and written of, which was removed from the choir, now adorns the room. This, with some tapestry, and an old chimney-piece, and a little painted glass, remind us of past days. 
<p><num value="2">Two</num> anti-chambers are more in their original state; in <num value="1">one</num> is a handsome niche. The abbot's hall is on the western side, and contains a gallery at the south end. East of the passage leading to the school, is a long ancient building, whose basement story is roofed with semi-circular groined arches, arising from pillars with handsome capitals. At the north end the regalia is said to have been formerly kept. Since that has been removed the standard-money has been deposited there. An architect,<NOTE>The late John Carter, esq. than whom no man has done more towards the elucidation of the beauties and perfection of English architecture.</NOTE> in the Gentleman's Magazine for <datestruct VALUE="1799-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>, has given an account of this place, so much to my purpose, that I shall transcribe it without ceremony.  <QUOTE>I likewise noticed, at the east end of the <num value="1">first</num> division, a complete altar-table, raised on <num value="2">two</num> steps; which of late years has been erroneously called the tomb of Hugolin: with a curious piscina on its right side. I saw the double doors closed, and fastened by <num value="7">seven</num> locks; each lock had a different key, and each key a different possessor.</QUOTE>  The upper story is used as the school-room. The building just mentioned, if we may pronounce from the Saxon style, is the most ancient in the precincts of the abbey. Very little is left of the lesser cloisters; some Saxon columns were accidentally discovered a few years past in the neighbouring garden. Near it is another portion, or room, of equal antiquity. The place in which the records of the house of lords are kept, was originally a great square tower, erected for a treasury to the abbey; it is now greatly altered; and so indeed is the inside of the old Chapter-house, to make room for the records of the treasury of the exchequer, and the everlasting Domesday-book. The roof, as usual in such buildings, is supported by a centre column; but the galleries, shelves, and presses, are determined enemies to description. I shall therefore leave them undescribed; and conclude this survey of the exterior of the abbey and its dependencies, by saying, fragments in some cases, and large portions in others, of walls and gates, may be found in many directions; by means of which, the ancient inclosure might be traced with considerable accuracy.</QUOTE><NOTE><BIBL>Mal., Lond.

</TABLE>
 
<p>In describing the interior the <num value="1">first</num> object is the choir. The altar piece is very handsome of plaster, executed by Bernasconi; it consists of niches and pinnacles of pointed architecture; this was erected in the autumn of <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>, the older screen having been removed at the coronation of his present majesty. 
<p>The former altar piece was of white marble, faintly veined with blue, and was a present from queen Anne, and removed from Whitehall chapel, for which it was designed by sir Christopher Wren. It consisted of a basement of the Tuscan order, in <num value="3">three</num> compartments; the middle semicircular, and largest; and was formed by <num value="12">twelve</num> pilasters, with their architrave, frieze, and cornice. On the frieze of a slight projection over the altar was inscribed, <foreign lang=la>ANNA REGINA, PIA, FELIX, AUGUSTA, PARENS PATRIAE. D.</foreign>
 
<p>The pavement is modern, formed into squares, lozenges, sexagons, stars, and crosses, of rich white and coloured marble. Descending <num value="2">two</num> steps of white marble, which cover part of the grand mosaic platform, we tread on the wreck of the most glorious work in England; venerable through age, costly in its materials, and invaluable for its workmanship. What must have been the beauties of this holy place soon after the completion of the church! the altar-piece, resembling in workmanship its transcendant back in Edward the Confessor's chapel; the shrine of that saint beaming with jewels, gold, and silver statues, and other offerings; the sides of the choir shewing glances of the numerous altars in the chapels, with the rich tombs on the right and left: and this pavement, sparkling with the bright rays of vast tapers, and ever-burning lamps. And hither did Henry VI. after making a public entry into London, come,

<p>Abbot Ware's pavement is separated from the modern <num value="1">one</num> by a skreen of iron rails. The materials are lapis lazuli, jasper, porphyry, alabaster, Lydian and serpentine marbles, and touchstone. It was made at the charge of the abbot, and is said to have been purchased by him in France. An admirer of the arts must view it with the deepest regret. It was injured, no doubt, at the Reformation, when the high altar was removed, at its restoration by queen Mary, and afterwards almost demolished. The most irreparable attack was from the workmen at erecting the late altar-piece. The following description will shew its injuries; and even now, <QUOTE> says Mr. Malcolm, </QUOTE> since it has been the custom to <hi rend=italics>shew</hi> the choir for money, it is trodden, worn, and dirtied, daily by hundreds, who are unconscious of its value, and I know barely look at it. Is it not a national treasure? When it is quite destroyed, can we shew such another? It may be seen over the rails adjoining; and may it in future be seen from thence only! The centre of the design is a large circle, whose centre is a circular plane of porphyry, <num value="3">three</num> spans and a quarter in diameter; round it stars of lapis lazuli, pea-green, red, and white, which, being of most beautiful colours, have been much depredated; those enclosed by a band of alabaster; and without, a border of lozenges, red and green; the half lozenges contain triangles of the same colours. A dark circle held brass letters, whose places may be seen, but now reduced to <num value="6">six</num>. The extreme lines of this great circle run into <num value="4">four</num> smaller circles facing the cardinal points; that to the east a centre of orange and green variegated; round it a circle of red and green wedges; without that, lozenges of the same colours; and completed by a dark border. To the north, the circle has a sexagon centre of variegated grey and yellow; round it a band of porphyry, and a dark border. The west circle nearly similar. The south, a black centre within a variegated octagon. A large lozenge incloses all the above circles, which is formed by a double border of olive colour; within which, on <num value="1">one</num> corner only, are <num value="138">138</num> circles intersecting each other, and each made by <num value="4">four</num> oval pieces inclosing a lozenge. The other parts vary in figure, but would take many pages to describe. 
<p>The above lozenge has a circle on each of its sides, to the north west, south west, north east, and south east. The <num value="1">first</num> contains a sexagon, divided by lozenges of green; within which are <num value="41">forty-one</num> red stars. In the intersections red triangles. Green triangles form a sexagon round every intersection. The <num value="2">second</num> contains a sexagon; within it several stars of red and green, forming several sexagons, containing yellow star. The <num value="3">third</num> has a sexagon, formed by intersecting lines into sexagons and triangles; within the former, stars of red and green. The latter <num value="16">sixteen</num> smaller triangles of red, <pb id="p.57" n="57"> green, and yellow. Tire last a sexagon, with <num value="31">thirty-one</num> within it, filled by stars of <num value="6">six</num> rays, green and yellow. The spaces within the great lozenge round the circles is composed of circles, stars, squares, lozenges, and triangles, whose component parts are thousands of pieces of the above shapes. The whole of the great lozenge and circles is inclosed by a square; the sides to the cardinal points. It has held other parts of the inscription, of which few remains are now visible. 
<p>The <num value="4">four</num> outsides are filled by parallelograms and circles of considerable size, all divided into figures nearly similar to those described. 
<p>The design of the figures that were in it was to represent the time the world was to last; or the <foreign lang=la>primum mobile</foreign>, according to the Ptolemaic system, was going about, and was given in some verses, formerly to be read on the pavement, relating to those figures:

<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Of these, and they seem to need it, I find this explanation given :<NOTE><BIBL>Biblioth. Cotton. Claudius, A. viii.</BIBL></NOTE> the threefold hedge is put for <num value="3">three</num> years, the time a dry hedge usually stood: a dog for <num value="3">three</num> times that space, or <num value="9">nine</num> years, it being taken for the time that creature usually lives; an horse in like manner for <num value="27">twenty-seven</num>: a man, <num value="81">eighty-one</num>: a hart, <num value="243">two hundred and forty-three</num>; a raven, <num value="729">seven hundred and twenty-nine</num>; an eagle, <num value="2187">two thousand one hundred and eighty-seven</num>: a great whale, <num value="6561">six thousand five hundred and sixty-one</num>; the world, <num value="19683">nineteen thousand six hundred and eighty-three</num>; each succeeding figure giving a term of years, imagined to be the time of their continuance, <num value="3">three</num> times as much as that before it. 
<p>In the <num value="4">four</num> last verses, the time when the work was performed, and the parties concerned in it, are expressed; the poet seems to have been under some difficulty to express the time. By the rest is meant that the king was at the charge, that the stones were purchased at Rome, that <num value="1">one</num> Odorick was the master workman, and that the abbot of Westminster, who procured the materials, had the care of the work.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Much of this exquisite work is lost, and a great portion is hidden by the steps. The north and south sides are replaced by lozenges of black and while marble. It was laid in the year <datestruct value="1272"><year reg="1272">1272</year></datestruct>; and <pb id="p.58" n="58"> must have been the work of many years, as several of the pieces of marble are not more than <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4">fourth</num> of an inch in length, and the largest not more than <num value="4">four</num> inches, except those particularized. 
<p>This fine pavement is enclosed by a rich scroll-work railing; and, upon descending <num value="2">two</num> steps, we come to the lozenged black and white marble surface of the choir, made by Dr. Busby, the celebrated prebendary of Westminster, and master of the school, whose rigid discipline has  <QUOTE>damned him to fame</QUOTE>  throughout all generations. At the east end of it are engraved the names of Richard Busby, <datestruct value="1695--"><year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>, and Robert South, <datestruct value="1716--"><year reg="1716">1716</year></datestruct>. 
<p>All traces of the interments beneath this part of the church are now gone; and are succeeded by pews for the Westminster scholars, and <num value="9">nine</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> private pews. 
<p>The pulpit is attached to the north-west pillar of the tower; and is supported by a clustered column, spreading into a sexagon. On each corner is a small pillar, terminating in a cherub. Within the pannels is a flower of <num value="12">twelve</num> leaves. A palm tree, of exquisite workmanship, supporting the sounding-board, whose top and sides are pinnacled. The lower is richly inlaid with dark wood. 
<p>The sides of the choir are of wood, and divided by slender columns with tasteful capitals into arches, adorned with foliage and pinnacles. The transepts are entered by a door on each side of the choir. 
<p>The enriched canopies of the stalls render them extremely beautiful. They are <num value="32">thirty-two</num> in number, besides those of the dean and the sub-dean at the west end, higher than the rest, and hung with purple cloth. Lower than those are the seats of others of the Westminster scholars. 
<p>Almost under the organ, by a descent of <num value="3">three</num> steps, we find a door on each side of the wainscot, with niches in the sides, and quatrefoils over them; together with pillars, arches, and pannels. Under the projection of the organ gallery are Grecian dentels and lozenges, with quatrefoils between them. 
<p>Directly under the organ is a Gothic ceiling. The centre is a rose surrounded by a quatrefoil. From the <num value="4">four</num> corners rise quarter circles, meeting a great circle round the quatrefoil; the quarters divided into rays. 
<p>The organ case has nothing to recommend it to particular notice; it is very plain and capacious. 
<p>The choir commences at the <num value="4">fourth</num> pillar from the east, and extends in length to the <num value="11">eleventh</num>. 
<p>The roof is camarated, and very richly adorned with bright gilded ribs, key-stones, all varied in complicated scrolls; so also are the capitals of the pillars in the row of windows. The surface is coloured, and at irregular intervals crossed with grey. Round the key-stones are painted roses. 
<p>Mr. Malcolm very justly remarks, that <QUOTE><p>notwithstanding the <pb id="p.59" n="59"> strong bars of iron which cross the intercolumniations near the great pillars of the tower, must greatly contribute to their support, they are not sufficient to prevent those vast clusters from each tending to a point in the centre of the space under it. Possibly as they have thus bent by some unknown cause for many years past, they may not for many ages fail; but if I dare prophecy, this will be the spot where this venerable pile will rend asunder, and the adjoining parts accumulate in <num value="1">one</num> dreadful ruin on that centre. 
<p>There are already several fissures in the ceiling of the choir; and what is of more importance, the centre rib, east and west, is very far from a straight line.</QUOTE><NOTE><BIBL>Mal. Lond. Red. i.<num value="93">93</num></BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p> <QUOTE> These alarming symptoms of decay and ruin,</QUOTE>  says Mr. Nightingale,  <QUOTE>are sensibly, though very little increased within these few years; but I should think Mr. Malcolm did not need to have alarmed himself on account of the weight of stones, marbles, and metals, which this piece of ground, small as it is, has to sustain.</QUOTE>  
<p>The <num value="4">four</num> sides of the tower, over the points of the great arches, have blank windows, nearly triangular; and each side <num value="2">two</num> small pointed windows. The ribs of the roof terminate in a circular recess. On the outside of this is a square, with blank shields on the sides. These ornaments are highly gilded. The capitals of the great pillars have projecting heads. 
<p>Behind the altar, is 
<div2 type=section id="c.2.1"><HEAD>The Chapel of St Edward the Confessor.</HEAD>
 
<p>It extends to the <num value="4">fourth</num> western pillar, and is formed by the circular sweep of the east end of the choir. 
<p>This chapel is ascended by a flight of wooden steps. The pavement was at <num value="1">one</num> time of exquisite workmanship; but the constant tread of visitors, the depredations of idle persons; and, as a modern writer supposes also, the depredations of weak devotees, have almost worn away, in many places, the stone from the marbles inlaid upon them. Of the latter cause of ruin no fear need now be entertained; we live in more enlightened times, wherein devotees are neither so numerous nor so weak as formerly. 
<p>The ground-work of this fine pavement consists of large irregular dark stones, cut into circles, intersecting others, triangles within triangles, and many other geometrical figures, which are all filled with thousands of pieces in the above shapes, of the same valuable materials that compose the pavement about the altar. 
<p>In this chapel is the ancient shrine of St. Edward, once the glory of England; but now neglected, defaced, and much abused. A few hardly perceptible traces of its former splendour exist. Only <num value="2">two</num> of its spiral pillars remain, the western, and a capital at the east. The wooden Ionic top is much broken and covered with dust. The Mosaic is picked away in almost every part within reach. The inscription on the architrave is partly legible. Widmore attributes it 
<pb id="p.60" n="60">
 to abbot Feckenham. The words in italic are supplied from this writer.

<p>The letters on this inscription are gradually becoming more indistinct, and some of them are discernible with the greatest difficulty. 
<p>This shrine was the production of Pietro Cavalini, who invented the Mosaic species of ornament. It is conjectured that abbot.Ware, when he visited Rome in the year <datestruct value="1256"><year reg="1256">1256</year></datestruct>, brought the artist to England back with him. Weaver<NOTE><BIBL>Funeral Monuments, p. <num value="485">485</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> says that  <QUOTE> Ware brought with him certain workmen and rich porphiry stones, whereof he made that singular, curious, and rare pavement before the high altar; and with these stones and workmen he did also frame the shrine of Edward the Confessor.</QUOTE>  
<p>This shrine was erected by Henry III. upon the canonization of Edward. This king was the last of the Saxon race; and was canonized by pope Alexander III, who, causing his name to be [inserted in the catalogue of saints, issued his bull to the abbot Lawrence, and the convent of Westminster, enjoining,  <QUOTE>that his body be honoured here upon earth, as his soul is glorified in heaven.</QUOTE>  He died in <datestruct value="1066--"><year reg="1066">1066</year></datestruct>, and was canonized in <datestruct value="1269--"><year reg="1269">1269</year></datestruct>.

<div2 type=section id="c.2.4"><HEAD>Tomb of Edward I.</HEAD>
 
<p>Between the western pillar next to the tomb of Henry III. lies his son, Edward I. the husband of the above queen. It is a very plain tomb; and has sustained very little injury. 
<p>Rymer's Foedera discovered to the society of Antiquaries that this renowned monarch, surnamed Longshanks, was interred in a stone coffin, enclosed in a tomb, in this chapel, and that he was enclosed with wax, and a sum of money allowed to preserve the tomb. The society determined to gratify their curiosity, and accordingly applied to Dr. Thomas, dean of Westminster, for leave to have the tomb opened. The dean being desirous to give all encouragement to curious researches, readily complied with their request. In the month of <datestruct VALUE="1775-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct>, the time appointed for opening the tomb, the dean, with about <num value="15">fifteen</num> of the society, attended, when, to their great gratification, they found the royal corpse as represented by that faithful annalist. 
<p>Sir Joseph Ayloffe, bart. whom Mr. Pennant very justly calls an able and worthy antiquary, has furnished almost every particular of this business. 
<p>On lifting up the lid of the tomb, the royal body was found wrapped in a strong thick linen cloth, waxed on the inside: the head and face were covered with a sudarium, or face cloth of crimson sarcenet, wrapped into <num value="3">three</num> folds, conformable to the napkin <pb id="p.64" n="64"> used by our Savior in his way to his crucifixion, as we are told by the church of Rome. On flinging open the external mantle, the corpse was discovered in all the ensigns of majesty, richly habited. The body was wrapped in a fine cere-cloth, closely fitted to every part, even to the very fingers and face. 
<p>The writs <foreign lang=la>de cera renovanda circa corpus regis Edwardi primi</foreign>
being extant, gave rise to this search.<NOTE><BIBL>Archaelogia. iii, <num value="376">376</num>, <num value="398">398</num>, <num value="399">399</num>.</BIBL> Similar writs were issued on account of Edward III. Richard II. and Henry IV. A search of the same nature lately took place on account of Charles I. but without the authority of such a writ; a simple exercise of the royal authority being deemed sufficient.</NOTE> Over the cere-cloth was a tunic of red silk damask; above that a stole of thick white tissue crossed the breast; and on this, at <num value="6">six</num> inches distant from each other, quatrefoils of filligree-work, of gilt metal, set with false stones, imitating rubies, sapphires, amethysts, &amp;c.; and the intervals between the quatrefoils on the stole, powdered with minute white beads, tacked down in a most elegant embroidery, in form not unlike what is called the true-lovers' knot. Above these habits was the royal mantle of rich crimson satin, fastened on the left shoulder with a magnificent fibula of gilt metal, richly chased, and ornamented with <num value="4">four</num> pieces of red, and <num value="4">four</num> of blue, transparent paste, and <num value="24">twenty-four</num> more pearls. 
<p>The corpse from the waist downwards, was covered with a rich cloth of figured gold, which falls down to the feet, and was tacked beneath them. On the back of each hand was a quatrefoil like those on the stole. In the king's right hand was a sceptre, with a cross of copper gilt, and of elegant workmanship, reaching to the right shoulders. In the left hand was the rod and dove, which passed over the shoulder and reached his ear. The dove stood on a ball placed on <num value="3">three</num> ranges of oak leaves of enamelled green; the dove, white enamel. On the head was a crown charged with trefoils made of gilt metal.<NOTE><BIBL>Archaeologia, vol. iii. p. <num value="402">402</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The head was lodged in a cavity of the stone coffin, always observable in those receptacles of the dead.

<p>This monarch's tomb is on the south side between the <num value="2">second</num> and <num value="3">third</num> pillars.

<p>The Gothic ornaments of the tomb are extremely beautiful.

<div2 type=section id="c.2.6"><HEAD>Tomb of Queen Philippa.</HEAD>
 
<p>Between the <num value="1">first</num> and <num value="2">second</num> pillars, at his feet, is the marble tomb of his queen Philippa. Her figure in alabaster, represents <pb id="p.65" n="65"> her as a most masculine woman. She died in <datestruct value="1369--"><year reg="1369">1369</year></datestruct>: her royal spouse in <datestruct value="1377--"><year reg="1377">1377</year></datestruct>. The tomb of Philippa was originally rich, but has suffered more than some of the others. 
<p>The next monument to be described is the 
<div2 type=section id="c.2.7"><HEAD>Tomb of Richard II.</HEAD>
 
<p>Richard II. and his <num value="1">first</num> consort, Anne, daughter of Wincelaus, king of Bohemia. <NOTE><BIBL>Sandford, <num value="203">203</num></BIBL>; <BIBL>Gough, I, <num value="163">163</num>, Tab. lxi. lxii.</BIBL></NOTE> They repose side by side in the next intercolumniation westward. The king's face is well wrought; but his cushion is stolen. The robing is decorated with peascod shells, open, and the peas out, emblematical of his former sovereignty. 
<p>Underneath the wooden canopy are the remains of some exquisitely fine paintings. This canopy is divided into <num value="4">four</num> compartments: those over the heads and feet contain representations of angels supporting the monarch's arms and those of his queen; but they are nearly obliterated by age and damps: the shields are all that remain visible. The <num value="2">second</num> compartment from the heads of effigies has a tolerably perfect representation of the Almighty, habited as a venerable old man in a close garment; his hand in the act of blessing; but this is hardly discernible. In the next division is Jesus Christ, seated by the Virgin mother, in the same attitude. With her hands across her breast, and leaning towards the Saviour, in the most graceful and expressive manner, is the Virgin. This part of the painting seems to have suffered the least from the ravages of time: the countenances, when examined minutely, are still very beautiful; but to see them to advantage, it is necessary to climb upon the dusty tomb beneath, and view them in an inclined position, with the face opposite the south aisle. 
<p>It is not known to what master we are indebted for these exquisite productions; but, even in their present neglected and rapidly declining state, they clearly shew the hand of an artist enthusiastically alive to his subject. Though the outline remains, the colours are disappearing: it is not, however, yet too late to preserve and perhaps restore them: if they are neglected much longer, it is probable this work will be the last, of any magnitude, to preserve the remembrance of them. Mr. Malcolm thinks it highly probable that they were executed by the same artist who drew the paintings some years ago brought to light on the walls of St. Stephen's chapel. 
<p>The ground work, round the figures, was once richly gilt; but it is now a dingy yellow, in some places nearly black. It is of fine plaister, and has been embossed with multitudes of small quatrefoils, and other ornaments; some parts still retain traces of its former beauty and richness. 
<p>The following rhyming inscription in raised letters runs round the ledge of the brass table beginning at the foot of the north side. <pb id="p.66" n="66">

<p>The most ancient of the coronation chairs was brought with the regalia from Scotland by Edward I. in the year <datestruct value="1297"><year reg="1297">1297</year></datestruct>, and offered at the shrine of St. Edward. An oblong rough stone, brought from Scone in Scotland, is placed underneath the chair, and is said, and by many believed, to have been Jacob's pillow.
<p><FIGURE id="Fig.068"><HEAD>Coronation Chair.</HEAD></FIGURE> 
<p>Another old wooden chair on the left of this was made for the coronation of queen Mary II. These chairs, which are of clumsy ornamented oak, stand behind the shrine, and with their faces to the beautiful screen already described as containing the <num value="14">fourteen</num> legendary tales of the works and miracles of St. Edward the Confessor. At the coronation of our kings and queens, <num value="1">one</num> or both, as circumstances may require, are richly covered with gold tissue, and are brought before the altar. 
<p>Near these chairs, and a little to the west against the altar, stands a large oblong wooden case of wainscot, at <num value="1">one</num> time covered with nails, or, perhaps, with some kind of metal casing. It opens with folding doors on the south side, and discovers, within a glass case, a waxen effigy of Edmund Sheffield, the last duke of Buckingham, who died in the <num value="19">nineteenth</num> year of his age. It is richly clad in crimson velvet, with ermine, &amp;c. he wears a richly ornamented ducal crown, of crimson velvet, with gold ornaments and ermine. In his right hand he holds a golden stick, about a yard in length. The figure is recumbent; and as the face was taken from a cast after his decease, the likeness is doubtless correct. 
<p>At the east end of St. Edward's chapel, is the 
<div2 type=section id="c.2.9"><HEAD>Chantry and Monument of Henry the <num value="5">Fifth</num>.</HEAD>
 
<p>The screen, which is particularly elegant, is ornamented with deer, and swans chained to a beacon, a female figure with an animal on her knees, and pointed shields of arms; but they are much damaged. Several iron hooks are left, from which, it is probable, lamps were formerly suspended. From this part buttresses ascend; between them canopies (<num value="3">three</num> of which are destroyed) of exceeding richness. <num value="7">Seven</num> are for figures as large as life. The middle statue is removed; the others consist of a man kneeling at his devotions, a king erect, praying; St. George in armour, piercing the dragon's throat, a female seated, with her hands crossed, another man, and St. Dionysius, who carried his head after decapitation. 
<p>Directly over the tomb of Henry the <num value="5">Fifth</num> is the Chantry which had an altar-piece of fine carvings. <num value="2">Two</num> steps are still in being, and the marks of its back against the wall, with a square niche on each side. <num value="2">Two</num> other recesses remain on the north and south walls o the chantry which have had shutters that have been wrested from their hinges, now broken in the wall. On the cornice over the altar, are <num value="30">thirty</num> statues in <num value="4">four</num> ranges; they are greatly broken and decayed. 
<pb id="p.69" n="69">
 
<p><FIGURE id="Fig.069"><HEAD>Armour of Henry the <num value="5">Fifth</num>.</HEAD></FIGURE>
<p>In this oratory are preserved several relics of this justly renowned monarch, which consist of his helmet, saddle, and shield. The <num value="1">first</num> is of iron, and is fixed on a bar extending across the front of the chapel. The wood work of the saddle alone remains; it was formerly covered with blue velvet, powdered with fleurs-de-lis, 
<hi rend=italics>or</hi>, and is <num value="27">27</num> inches long, <num value="15">15</num> inches high before, and <num value="13">13</num> behind. The shield is lined with sage green damask semee of fleurs-de-lis across the middle, worked on rich crimson velvet an escarbuncle or on a field <hi rend=italics>gules</hi>, referring to the king's mother Joan of Navarre. 
<p>The present coffin of Edward the confessor may be seen from the parapet of Henry the <num value="5">Fifth</num>'s chapel; it is deposited within the ancient stone work, about the height of the architrave. It was made by order of James the <num value="2">second</num>, (who commanded the old coffin to be enclosed within it) of strong planks <num value="5">five</num> inches thick, cramped, or banded with iron. 
<p>In the chantrey are several curious and interesting models of churches, now closed from the inspection of the public. The best is sir C. Wren's design for erecting a tower and spire to the abbey; this design was never executed, owing to the great columns having given way in their shafts. The other models, <num value="13">thirteen</num> in number, are very fine; <num value="2">two</num> of them represent St. John's, Westminster and St. Mary le Strand. 
<p>Underneath the chantry, is the 
<div2 type=section id="c.2.10"><HEAD>Chapel of Henry V.</HEAD>
 
<p>Just large enough to hold the tomb of that monarch. This chapel is divided from that of St. Edward the Confessor by a grand iron gate of open work, divided into lozenges, containing quatrefoils. Over the arch of the gate is a profusion of exquisitely rich Gothic workmanship, of the most delicate texture; but very little, if at all, inferior to the canopies in the frieze of the screen opposite already described. Here are <num value="6">six</num> canopies, divided by small buttresses. In these canopies are small, beautiful statues, in tolerably good preservation. The middle statue, however, is gone; and the next to it, on the south side, has lost its head. 
<p>The gate is bounded by <num value="2">two</num> Gothic towers, containing winding stairs round octagon pillars, whose capitals are praying angels. <pb id="p.70" n="70"> 
<p>Over the doors are statues as large as life; they represent saints in speaking attitudes: behind them are pointed windows, with <num value="3">three</num> mullions. On the other sides, nearest to the gate are <num value="2">two</num> prelates, on pedestals, and on their canopies <num value="2">two</num> kings, probably Henry V. and Edward the Confessor; the <num value="1">first</num>, however, Mr. Malcolm takes for Henry III. On the north-west and south-west sides are <num value="2">two</num> priests and <num value="2">two</num> monarchs. On each corner are buttresses; and over the windows semi-hexagon projections on every side, each containing <num value="3">three</num> beautiful niches, once all filled by statues, but some of the statues are gone. 
<p>The great arch or roof over the tomb is full of ribs and pannels. 
<p>The tomb itself is very plain, and the effigy is without a head, which was supposed to have been of massy silver, and has been gone ever since the Reformation. The thief, however, was probably disappointed, as it is likely that this head was only plated or silvered over. The rough unornamented cushion still remains. The exterior of this little chapel would indicate a much more elegant effigy, which is extremely plain, though well executed. 
<p>We now take our leave of the chapel of Edward the Confessor. We may notice, however, that here was interred the heart of Henry, son of Richard, king of the Romans, brother of Henry III. He was assassinated in the church of St. Silvester, at Viterbo, as he was performing his devotions before the high altar. Simon and Guido Montfort, sons of Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester, were the assassins, in revenge for their father's death, who, with their brother Henry, were slain at the battle of Evesham, fighting against their sovereign. The body of Henry was brought to England, and buried in the nunnery of St. Helen; but his heart was put in a cup, and placed near St. Edward's shrine. Nothing of this can now be seen.

<p>The north wall is divided into <num value="5">five</num> compartments of unequal heights. A tall slender pillar separates the <num value="2">two</num> great doors. The tops are angular, and the mouldings adorned with roses, supported over the pillars by a head.

The arches, which are extremely pointed, are composed of a great number of mouldings. The ribs of the roof are supported by <num value="3">three</num> small pillars which ascend from the capitals. The ribs, the key-stones, &amp;c. are richly gilt, and have a most beautiful appearance. A magnificent colonnade of double arches extends over the great arches; these inferior arches are <num value="8">eight</num> in number, <num value="6">six</num> of them have their mouldings richly adorned with foliage. Every arch has <num value="1">one</num> pillar, and over it a cinquefoil with a circle.

On the western wall of this north transept are St. Michael and the Dragon, an angel, and a broken figure falling, <num value="3">three</num> saints, fancied animals, a palm branch, and scrolls, all greatly decayed.

From which sad circumstance of his death, we may learn that neither the greatest skill, judgment, or experience, joined to the most firm, unshaken resolution, can resist the fury of the wind and waves. And we are taught from the passages of his life (which were filled with great and gallant actions, but ever accompanied with adverse gales of fortune) that the brave, the worthy, and the good man meets not always his reward in this world. <num value="58">Fifty-eight</num> years of painful services he had passed, when, being just retired to the government of Greenwich Hospital to wear out the remainder of his days, he was once more, and for the last time, called out by his king and country, whose interests he ever preferred to his own. And his unwearied zeal for their service ended only in his death. Which weighty misfortune to his afflicted family became heightened by many aggravating circumstances attending it. Yet, amidst their grief, had they the mournful consolation to find his gracious and Royal Master mixing his concern with the general lamentations of the public for the calamitous fate of so zealous, so valiant, and so able a commander, And, as a lasting memorial of the sincere love and esteem borne by his widow to a most affectionate and worthy husband, this honorary monument was erected by her. He was born <datestruct VALUE="1669-02-2"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=2>2</day>, <year reg=1669>1669</year></datestruct>; and married Susannah, the daughter of Colonel Apriece, of Washingby, in the County of Huntingdon; died <datestruct VALUE="1744-10-7"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=7>7</day>, <year reg=1744>1744</year></datestruct>, leaving <num value="1">one</num> son and <num value="1">one</num> daughter; the former of whom, George Balchen, survived him but a short time: for, being sent to the West Indies in <datestruct value="1745--"><year reg="1745">1745</year></datestruct>, commander of his Majesty's ship, the Pembroke, he died at Barbadoes in December the same year, aged <num value="28">twenty-eight</num>, having walked in the steps, and imitated the virtues and bravery of his good, but unfortunate father.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The next consists of <num value="2">two</num> figures, Faith, and an angel: the former rests <num value="1">one</num> arm on a rock, while she clasps a cross to her bosom with the other.

<p>A beautiful weeping female hangs over the coffin-shaped sarcophagus. Near her is a beaver, emblematic of the country. There is besides a pyramid, and a cornucopia tied by a ribband to a rudder. 
<p>Against the pillar adjoining the last monument is a handsome marble pedestal, on which is a full length figure in a councillor's robes. On the base is the following inscription:--

<p>The interval between the next great pillars is occupied by a vast monument made by Banks, consisting of an ill-shaped sarcophagus, on which is a naked Asiatic, of excellent proportions and truth of figure, seated, weeping and resting on a cornucopia. The back of the tomb is a pyramid; before it a palm tree, on which is suspended a helmet, vest, shield, sword, arrows, colours, and laurel. A statue of Fame, whose attitude is forced and unnatural, and whose drapery is strangely tumbled, hangs a medallion over the trophies. Near her is an elephant.

<p>In the next intercolumniation is the earl of Mansfield's monument. Between the figures of Wisdom and Justice, is a trophy, composed of the earl's family arms, surmounted by the coronet, the mantle of honour, the rods of justice, and curtana, or sword of mercy. On the back of the chair is the earl's motto--<QUOTE lang=la>UNI AEQUUS VIRTUTI.</QUOTE> Enclosed in a crown of laurel, under it, is a figure of Death, as represented by the ancients, a beautiful youth, leaning on an extinguished torch; on each side of the figure of Death is a funeral altar, finished by a fir-apple.

<p>We now pass to the opposite side of the middle aisle, where the <pb id="p.80" n="80"> <num value="1">first</num> monument is to John Holles, duke of Newcastle, marquis and earl of Clare, baron Houghton, and knight of the order of the Garter. His body lies with his ancestors the Veres, Cavendishes, and Holles, in this place. In the reign of queen Anne he was lord keeper of the privy seal, privy counseller, lord lieutenant of Middlesex and Nottingham, &amp;c. &amp;c. lord chief justice in Eyre, north of Trent, and governor of the town and fort of Kingston upon Hull.

<p>It was designed by Gibbs, and is a beautiful pile of architecture, of the Composite order. The basement, columns, and pediments are finely proportioned; and the marble of which they are composed richly variegated. But what shall we say to the figures wrought by Bird in statuary marble Here we find neither grace, dignity, nor beauty. The armed duke leans in an awkward manner on his elbow, with his truncheon in <num value="1">one</num> hand, and his coronet in the other, upon a sarcophagus. 
<p>Near it is a tomb, likewise of the Composite order, with a basement covered with armour, on which is a handsome pedestal; reposing on a mat under a circular pediment lie the figures, in their robes, clumsily executed, of the duke and duchess of Newcastle. He was born in the year <datestruct value="1592"><year reg="1592">1592</year></datestruct>, and lived to the age of <num value="84">84</num>, dying on the <datestruct VALUE="1676-12-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>. He held many great offices, was a faithful general to his unfortunate king Charles I.; and defended York against the Scotch. When the king's cause became hopeless, he fled, and continued a long time in exile. His <num value="2">second</num> wife shared in all his sufferings with the utmost fortitude. During his bannishment she wrote many pleasing works.

<p>Britannia with a withered laurel in her hand, inclines towards the bust of the admiral, which a fine figure of Hercules places on its pedestal.

An ensign is the back ground; and the whole is worthy of its author, Roubiliac. 
<p>Adjoining is a tomb, consisting of a pedestal and Corinthian pillars, with a pediment, weeping children, cherubim, and a canopy, erected by Dame Elizabeth Campbell (who died <datestruct VALUE="1714-09-28"><month reg="09">September</month> the <day reg=28>28th</day>, <year reg=1714>1714</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="49">49</num> years) to her brother sir Gilbert Lort, bart. who died <datestruct VALUE="1698-12-19"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=19>19</day>, <year reg=1698>1698</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> years.

<p>In the north transept are large blue flag-stones, with inscriptions to the memory of the following illustrious personages: the right hon. William Pitt, the marquis of Londonderry, and the right hon. George Canning. 
<p>A few marks of the ancient screen, which passed north and south from pillar to pillar, forming the east aisle into <num value="3">three</num> chapels, remain at the back of sir Gilbert Lort's monument. This was part of

Indefatigably active and persevering in his own duty, he enforced a most strict observance of it in others, at the same time with so much mildness, with such condescending manners, as to gain the love and esteem of all who served under him, whose merits he was not more quick in discerning, or <pb id="p.83" n="83"> more ready to reward, than he was ever backward in acknowledging his own.

This wonderful tomb, <num value="1">one</num> of the great efforts of a great mind, is characteristic from the key-stone of the grey marble rustic niche to the base of the yawning sepulchre, whose heavy doors have grated open to release a skeleton bound in its deathly habiliments, of such astonishing truth of expression and correctness of arrangement, as it perhaps never fell to <num value="1">one</num> man's genius to execute. The dying figure of lady Nightingale seems to exert its last fading strength to clasp and lean upon her husband, whose extended arm would repel the unerring dart pointed at her breast. The eager impatience of Death to make sure of his prey is finely imagined, not only in the general attitude, but particularly in the manner in which he holds his long dart; he has suddenly seized it at the end, grasping and discommoding the feathers.

The ornament of the spaces over the arches is a figure whose arms are extended, surrounded by others in supplication; a kneeling female, her hands clasped, a cross behind her, surrounded by foliage; the <num value="3">third</num> a broken headless figure, to whom <num value="1">one</num> presents a lion, with other animals near him. 
<p>The upper part of the wall is exactly like that of the west aisle. In the north-east a door now built up. 
<p>Against the back of the tomb of John Holles, duke of Newcastle, reposes on the pavement, in a large coffin, covered with crimson velvet, inclosed only by a slight altar-tomb of variegated marble, covered by a slab of black, the late countess of Kerry. 
<p>Above is a polished plane of dark veined marble, on which is a pyramid and mantle of white, and an earl's coronet: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>To the affectionately beloved and honoured memory of Anastasia, Countess of Kerry, daughter of the late Peter Daly, esq. of Queensbury, in the county of Galway, in Ireland, who departed this life on the <num value="9">9th</num>, and was deposited here on the <datestruct VALUE="1799-04-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> day of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>. Her most afflicted husband, Francis Thomas, earl of Kerry, whom she rendered during <num value="31">31</num> years the happiest of mankind, not only by an affection which was bounded by her love to God, and to which there never was a single moment's interruption, but also by the practice of the purest religion and piety, of charity and benevolence, of truth and sincerity, of the sweetest and most angelic meekness and simplicity, and of every virtue that can adorn the human mind, has placed this inscription to bear testimony of his gratitude to her, of his admiration of her innumerable virtues, and of his most tender and affectionate love for her; intending when it shall please God to release him from this world, to be deposited with her here in the same coffin; and hoping that his merciful God will consider the severe blow which it has pleased his Divine will to inflict upon him, in taking from him the dearest, the most beloved, the most charming, the most faithful, and affectionate companion that ever blessed man, together with the load of his succeeding sorrows, as an expiation of his past offences; and that he will grant him his grace so to live, as that he may, through his Divine mercy, and through the precious intercession of our blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, hope for the blessing of being soon united with her in eternal happiness.

Upon her death, retiring from the world, he passed the remainder of his days in privacy and seclusion. Piety to God, and benevolence to man, were the principles which occupied his thoughts and divided his life; actuated by a lively sense of religion, he enjoyed that serenity of mind, and cheerfulness of temper, by which Christianity is so peculiarly distinguished. His. extensive bounties were dispensed with liberal, but secret munificence, seldom disclosing, even to those whom they relieved, the source whence they flowed. Public institutions, distressed individuals, private friends, experienced the benefit of his well regulated economy, demonstrating that though he had shrunk from <pb id="p.85" n="85"> the survey of the world, he had not forgotten its most important duties; ever studious to fulfil those <num value="2">two</num> great commandments, on which he had been taught by his Divine master,  <Q>hang all the law and the prophets.</Q> </QUOTE>

<p>The design is by sir William Chambers; an angel assists her ladyship in ascending from the sarcophagus to a vacant seat by her husband, who is supposed to be in the realms of bliss on a mass of clouds. The artist seems to have forgot that distance cannot well be expressed on marble, and that by attempting it the earl appears a boy to his countess a few feet lower. The naked parts of the figures are very good, the drapery very bad, and the rays of glory like bundles of Tuscan cornices. The clouds are like nothing. 
<p>Adjoining is a well-executed monument to the memory of Richard Kemperfelt, rear-admiral of the blue, who was lost in H. M. S.

On the column is represented the Royal George, sinking, and the admiral ascending into the heavenly regions, surmounted by an angel. 
<p>In a corner of this chapel is a handsome monument surmounted with Greek ornaments, and a bust of the deceased, to the memory <pb id="p.86" n="86"> of Matthew Baillie, M.

<p>The pavement is composed of many stones, whose owners have vainly endeavoured to transmit their names by them to posterity.

On a large blue slab is an inscription to William Moor, esq. late attorney-general of Barbadoes, who died on the <datestruct VALUE="1783-10-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="60">60</num> years.

<p>General Wolfe's monument separates the above chapel from the north aisle. It is very large, and the work of Wilton. The general is nearly naked, and is upon the whole a fine figure; perhaps the legs are too firmly placed for his exhausted situation. The soldier who supports him is full of earnestness and expression in relating the victory just achieved. That at the entrance of the lent has a good head; but the body is strangely faulty, and does not relieve as it ought. The angel offering the laurel had better have been omitted. The couch is badly drawn and poorly executed: but the old oak tree, hung with tomahawks and daggers is very excellent. The <num value="2">two</num> sorrowing lions at the feet of the sarcophagus are exceedingly characteristic, and well executed. We cannot say much for the bronze relief on the basement, though parts are well done. It represents the landing and scaling the rocks, previous to the action. The vessels cannot be worse.

<p>This monument is situated behind that of lord Ligonier; it is an altar tomb, with a lofty pyramidal canopy, richly enamelled and carved with foliage in the style of Edmund Crouchback and Aymer de Valence; on the altar tomb lies the effigy of the countess.--Until the coronation of his present majesty, this tomb was shut out from the choir by a screen, and from the aisle by the monument of lord Ligonier.

<p>This is an altar tomb on a basement, which rests on the pavement of the aisle.

<div2 type=section id="c.2.17"><HEAD>Earl of Lancaster's Tomb.</HEAD>
 
<p>The duke of Lancaster's had a painting on its basement, which has been nearly destroyed through age, want of cleaning, and other causes. In many places the stone is bare; and it is nearly impossible to make out the figures, or distinguish what the colours leave been. They appear to be knights conquerors leading their prisoners, from the triumphant attitudes of some, and the downcast looks of others. They are paired, and there is a general similarity of expression in the <num value="10">ten</num> figures. The effigies of the duke lie <pb id="p.88" n="88"> crosslegged under a grand canopy of <num value="1">one</num> great and <num value="2">two</num> smaller arches, enriched in a manner even more magnificent than that of Valence's.

<p>It has caused some dispute whether the small burial place of abbot slip, and the chapel of St. Erasmus were not the same. <num value="1">One</num> would almost imagine the writers who confound them had never been in the church. Whatever may have been the original state of the abbot's chapel, as it is called, it certainly is separate, and always has been from that of St. Erasmus. On examining the ichnography, the former will be found to answer the square chapel of St. Benedict directly opposite, in the south aisle. The place just mentioned is nearly open to the transept, and on the north side. It is therefore plain that Islip did no more than build the present screen, and make a floor for a chantry, to which there is now a flight of wooden steps, and at the entrance a small door leading to the place where he lies. Dart says, he cannot find the site of <num value="2">two</num> chapels dedicated to St. Catherine and St. Anne. 
<p>The door was surmounted by a statue, but only its bracket remains, and <emph>I H S</emph>. 
<p>The basement of the screen is composed of quatrefoils containing roses and fleurs de lis, and over them a row of arches. The next division is divided by buttresses into windows of <num value="4">four</num> mullions, with <num value="3">three</num> ranges of arches in height. The frieze contains <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> reliefs of his rebus, most absurdly conceived, being an eye, and a slip, or branch of a tree, and his name at length. The most beautiful part is <num value="7">seven</num> niches above, with canopies of great taste and delicate workmanship. <pb id="p.89" n="89"> 
<p>Farther to the east is another specimen of those exquisite performances of niches, and triple canopies, with their minute ribs; foliages, &amp;c. and a row of quatrefoils at the base. That this was the abbot's work we have a proof at the sides in a rebus of a hand holding a slip. 
<p>The recess is filled, without injury to it, by a neat tablet, inscribed,

<p><num value="1">One</num> of the small pillars on a great column having been cut away for the alterations made by Islip, it has been supported by a bracket carved into his rebus, which we find repeated in the window of the chantry in <num value="2">two</num> panes of coloured glass. And round this place, once used only for prayers for the deceased, stand clumsy presses faced with glass, through which the curious may view the stiff waxen figures of king William, queen Mary, and queen Anne, duchess of Richmond and Buckingham, Nelson and lord Chatham. 
<p>The robes and other parts of the dress of the late lord Chatham are preserved on a well-executed effigy by Mrs. Wright. The face is probably as well done as wax will permit; but such representations are never pleasing; there is something particularly disagreeable in the glass eyes. Fragments of portraits on the sides of the site of the altar were hid by these presses, but they have been recently removed with other ancient remains and framed and glazed near Poets' Corner. 
<p>The inside of the chapel or burial-place is hid from view by a fence of rough boards nailed across the arches. 
<div2 type=section id="c.2.18"><HEAD>St. Erasmus' Chapel.</HEAD>
 
<p>To the east of the screen of Islip's chantry is a door, under the mouldings of which are angels holding the arms of Edward the Confessor, and Edward III.; over it is Sanctus Erasmus; which would seem sufficient authority for asserting that the chapel was dedicated to him. Dart will have it that Islip borrowed a piece of the chapel of St, John the Baptist. That, however, is disputable; and, indeed, <num value="1">one</num> should imagine the passage older than that time; however, it may probably have been made when the <num value="3">three</num> tombs filling the south side were erected. 
<p>On the right side of the door is a circular piece of iron, which held the vessel for holy water. The roof of the entrance is divided by numerous ribs, and <num value="1">one</num> of the key-stones represents the assumption of the Virgin Mary. Through it is an aperture, for what purpose it is difficult to decide. 
<p>Directly facing the door, on ascending <num value="1">one</num> step, is a bracket, over <pb id="p.90" n="90"> which are the remains of the fastening to the statue it supported. The rays emanating from its head are very perfect, painted on the wall; and traces of rude flowers, not unlike those of the coarsest paper hangings, may be perceived on every side of it, and a few fleurs de lis. The mouldings have been a fierce scarlet, and gilt. On the left hand is a piscina, and facing it another. Several staples in the wall lead us to suppose that many lamps were suspended before this statue, which probably was St. Erasmus. Dart is certainly wrong in saying that an altar stood beneath it, as, though statues were not placed against an eastern wall, altars were. This would have been to the north. 
<p>The place of the altar on the east side of the chapel, which is said to have been dedicated to St. John the Baptist, is covered by the vast and splendid monument of Henry Carey, baron of Hunsdon, who died <datestruct value="1696--"><year reg="1696">1696</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="72">72</num>. A scrap of beautiful foliage which was over it, and an elevation in the pavement, are the only mementos of this altar. 
<p>On the north-east side of the chapel there is a deep square recess divided by a pillar. The hinges of a door to this locker, for the altar utensils, are still visible. The <num value="2">two</num> arches, and the ornaments of a seated figure, with foliage, are perfect over it. On the door is an old altar tomb, and in the arch directly over it books for lamps. 
<p>The north side is filled by the miserable tomb of colonel Popham and his lady, with their figures resting their elbows on a pedestal. It is without an inscription, which was removed at the Restoration on account of his rebellious conduct. 
<p>The adjoining side contains an ancient arch. On the north end of it is the altar tomb of Thomas Vaughan, who lived in the time of Edward IV. 
<p>On the south side of the door is the tomb of Mrs. Mary Kendal, an indifferent kneeling figure, <datestruct value="1710--"><year reg="1710">1710</year></datestruct>, aged about <num value="32">32</num>. She was remarkable for her friendship with lady Catharine Jones; and was interred here, in hopes her dust might mix with that lady's, who intended to be buried near her mother in this chapel. 
<p>In the midst of the pavement, almost covering it, is the tomb of Thomas Cecil, earl of Exeter; and, at his right hand, Dorothy, his <num value="1">first</num> wife, with a blank space for his <num value="2">second</num> wife, Frances, who (we are told by the ciceroni of the abbey,) refused so ignoble a situation as his left side. Their bodies, however, all rest together under the monument, in hopes of joyful resurrection, according to the inscription. 
<p>Of the <num value="3">three</num> tombs which separate the aisle from the chapel, that of George Fascet, abbot, is the western. It is an altar-tomb, with quatrefoils on the sides, and a flat arched canopy much decayed. At the head a shield, mitre and helmet. He died about <datestruct value="1414--"><year reg="1414">1414</year></datestruct>. On it is a stone coffin, which has been broken through and greatly injured. Within it are the oaken boards of the inner coffin; and on the top a large cross, shewing it to have belonged to an <pb id="p.91" n="91"> ecclesiastic. This coffin is attributed by Mr. Gough<NOTE><BIBL>Sepul. Mon. vol. i. page <num value="52">52</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> to abbot Crockesley, who died <datestruct value="1258--"><year reg="1258">1258</year></datestruct>. 
<p>At the feet is another tomb, with <num value="5">five</num> quatrefoils on the sides, and on it the decayed figure of a bishop. This had a canopy, but it is now entirely destroyed, except part of the west end, which has a shield, helmet, mitre, and this inscription: <foreign lang=la>DAI AN. D&lsquo;NI <datestruct value="1520--"><year reg="1520">1520</year></datestruct>.</foreign>
This is said to have been for the body of Thomas Ruthell, bishop of Durham. 
<p>The last is a tomb without a canopy, very like the preceding in every respect. The cushion under the head of the effigies is embroidered with W. C. W. It is conjectured to be abbot William of Colchester. The chapel has <num value="6">six</num> sides, besides that to the south, which is the form of all round the church. 
<p>In this chapel is a modern but neat tablet to the memory of Elizabeth countess of Mexborough, who died <datestruct VALUE="1821-06-7"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=7>7</day>, <year reg=1821>1821</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="59">59</num>. 
<p>A door, now closed, led from Islip's chantry to a passage over the entrance of this, through the piers between the windows, to the place where lord Hunsdona's tomb stands. A pillar over it terminates in a curious bracket of a man, who rests his elbows on his knees, and his head on his hand. An achievement, with a banner of lady Hughes, hangs to the west wall. 
<p>In the aisle between the chapel just described and the next, are <num value="2">two</num> tablets to Jane Crew, <datestruct value="1769--"><year reg="1769">1769</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="30">30</num>; and Juliana Crew, <datestruct value="1621--"><year reg="1621">1621</year></datestruct>.

<p>Has a skreen on the eastern side of the door, formed by the tomb of lord Bouchier and his lady. It is bounded by <num value="2">two</num> buttresses, at the base of which are a lion and an eagle supporting banners of arms. A heavy arch covers the boarded top of the tomb, in shape like <num value="2">two</num> coffins. The sides contain shields within garters, on quatrefoils: on the top of the arch is his shield, helmet, and crest; behind it a buttress, and on each side <num value="2">two</num> ranges of <num value="4">four</num> pointed arches; between them, nearly obliterated coats of arms. Over the rows of arches other coats; the upper held by painted angels, which cannot be traced without climbing.

<p>It is the work of Wilton; and a great statue of the admiral, in Roman armour, is made to rest on an English eighteen-pounder, mounted on a sea carriage. At his feet is a cable, remarkably correct, and well coiled, in the seaman's phrase. 
<p>I am compelled to pass over the numerous stones and inscriptions which appear on the pavement of this transept, though many of them are in a very high degree interesting as records of the worth, the greatness, and the virtues of some of our ancestors. 
<p>In the window over the entrance to Henry the <num value="7">Seventh</num>'s chapel are <num value="7">seven</num> figures in stained glass. The <num value="1">first</num> is intended for Christ, who is distinguished by a crown of thorns. The Virgin Mary is depicted with dishevelled hair, and a straw-coloured nimbus. King Edward the Confessor is in royal robes, on the exterior of which are several large initial letters E. St. John is represented as a pilgrim. On the inner robe is the initial letter J. several times repeated. St. Augustine is habited as a pilgrim, and bishop Mellitus is splendidly arrayed in his ecclesiastical robes with the letter M. 
<p>In the area before Henry the <num value="7">7th</num>'s chapel, is a large grey stone, with <hi rend=italics>an</hi> almost obliterated figure of a religieuse; it was placed in its present situation on the rebuilding of that structure, having formerly stood in St. Mary's chapel which was pulled down by Henry <num value="7">7th</num>.

<p>Before we enter that venerable and rich chapel, we must, admire the beautiful side of Henry the <num value="5">Fifth</num>'s oratory, which forms an arch across the aisle directly east of his tomb. It is supported at each corner by clustered pillars; on the ends are shields with his arms, surrounded by <num value="4">four</num> angels, whose wings are disposed so as to form an imperfect quatrefoil; and on the point of the arch is a shield, helmet, and crest; in the frieze a badge of deer and swans chained to a beacon; in the centre is a grand niche of <num value="3">three</num> canopies, which contains a representation of the coronation of Henry V. or his successor; <num value="2">two</num> prelates are in the act of placing the crown on the seated king; <num value="2">two</num> figures kneel on the sides: to the right are <num value="9">nine</num> small niches, with statues; on their canopies are deer and swans. On the left <num value="5">five</num> niches and statues, and on the tops of their canopies statues under other canopies. Those occasion a rise of about <num value="2">two</num> feet near the altar. The south side is very much like the above; the <num value="3">three</num> arches which stand on the flight of steps leading to Henry the <num value="7">Seventh</num>'s Chapel are of unequal breadths; the ornaments over the smaller ones are alike. Over the north arch is a shield and crest, with the side frieze continued. In a triple canopied niche is St George piercing the dragon; on the left <num value="2">two</num> niches with statues; and on the right, over those, are <num value="6">six</num> niches, containing saints with canopies; and above is the side continuation of the before described altar-piece in Henry the <num value="5">Fifth</num>'s chantry. 
<p>The ceiling of the arch over the aisle has a crown for the centre; pannelled rays diverge from it, which are bounded by a circle of quatrefoils; some of the pannels contain deer, and others swans. The basement of Henry the <num value="5">Fifth</num>'s tomb next the aisle is formed into quatrefoils, much decayed, 
<p>The ascent from the abbey to the Blessed Mary's, or Henry VII.&lsquo;s chapel, is formed by <num value="12">twelve</num> steps; over them is a most magnificent arch of the same width as the nave; unfortunately it has very little light. The capitals of the pillars on the western side have a bear and staff, a greyhound and dragon on them: the angles on the sides of the great arches have the king's arms within quatrefoils, and those of the <num value="2">two</num> sides his badges; a row of pinnacled and foliaged arches, divided by <num value="1">one</num> bay, extend north and south across the entrances. The frieze is adorned with roses, and the whole is completed by a battlement. The roof is composed of quatrefoils, filled by badges; between which are beautifully enriched pannels. On the platform of the stairs are <num value="2">two</num> doors leading to the north and south aisles. The basements of the <num value="2">two</num> rows have rows of quatrefoils; over them arches and vast blank windows of <num value="3">three</num> mullions, crossed by <num value="1">one</num> embattled, which finish in beautiful intersections; <num value="1">one</num> of those divisions on each side is glazed; besides those the other lights are only reflected. <num value="3">Three</num> steps higher is the pavement of the chapel, of black and white marble lozenges, in which is a square, <pb id="p.95" n="95"> something different in the shape of the pieces, containing a small plate of perforated brass. This is the only memorial the present royal family have to distinguish the place for their interment, and the only monument to the remains of king George and queen Caroline, the late duke of Cumberland, &amp;c. &amp;c. 
<div2 type=section id="c.2.21"><HEAD>Tomb of Henry the <num value="7">Seventh</num>.</HEAD>
 
<p>Its grand brazen enclosure would, with a very trifling alteration, form an outside plan for a magnificent palace in the Gothic style; the double range of windows terminating by a projecting arched cornice, the frieze of quatrefoils and the embattlements are all suited to such a building; and the portal would be an exquisite window for the hall, a little shortened. 
<p>Although brass is not easily broken, and the ornaments are firmly fastened, yet we may find strong traces of devastation and theft in the vacant niches and injured decorations; the little slender pillars, the badges of a greyhound, dragon, portcullis, &amp;c. &amp;c. are introduced with great taste throughout the design, which must he admitted to be worthy of the monarch's splendid chapel. The form of the altar-tomb admits of so little variety, that we are nearly confined to saying the effigies are very well executed, as are the angels at the corners. The bas-reliefs on the sides are finely drawn; but the circles of leaves are too thick, and the pilasters too excessively crowded with ornaments and emblems. 
<p>On the north side of the tomb is the following inscription:--

<p>Let us now, says Mr. Malcolm, attempt a more detailed description of this wonderful piece of architecture, where some new perfeclions may be discovered after the fiftieth examination: and <num value="1">first</num>, the gates of brass. The great gate is divided into <num value="60">sixty</num> perfect <pb id="p.96" n="96"> squares, and <num value="5">five</num> imperfect ones; these contain pierced crowns and portcullisses, the king's initials, fleur-de-lis, an eagle, <num value="3">three</num> thistles Springing through a coronet, their stalks terminating in <num value="7">seven</num> feathers; <num value="3">three</num> lions, a crown, supported by sprigs of roses; on each division of that gate is a rose, and between them dragons: some of which are broken off, as are also <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of the roses. The smaller gates contain <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> squares each, with the above emblems. The <num value="2">two</num> pillars between the gates are twice filletted, and the capitals are foliage. The animals, badges of the king, hold fanciful shields on them, but have lost their heads, and are otherwise mutilated. The angles of the <num value="3">three</num> arches are all filled with lozenges, circles, and quatrefoils, with a rose in the centre of the quatrefoil. <num value="14">Fourteen</num> busts of angels, habited as bishops and priests, crowned, extend across the nave; the <num value="2">two</num> corner ones are hidden by the canopies over the respective stalls of prince Frederick, and the king's stall, bearing the flag of England and France; this canopy has no crest. Between them are <num value="7">seven</num> portcullisses, <num value="3">three</num> roses, and <num value="3">three</num> fleur-de-lis, all under crowns, more or less broken. From hence to the roof is filled by a great window of many compartments, so much intersected and arched, that a description would not be comprehended. The lower part is blank. The upper part contains figures in painted glass, crosses, or crowns, and fleur-de-lis; single feathers of the prince of Wales's crest, red and blue mantles, crowns and portcullisses, crowns and garters, crowns and red rose; and <num value="2">two</num> roses or wheels full of red, blue, and yellow glass; but little light passes through this window, it is so near the end of the abbey, and covered with dust. Several fragments of pinnacles in glass remain in the arches of the lower divisions, which were parts of the canopies over saints. 
<p>The side aisles have <num value="4">four</num> arches hid by the stalls; the clustered pillars, <num value="5">five</num> in number, between them support great arches on the roof, each of which have <num value="23">twenty-three</num> pendant small semi-quatrefoil arches on their surface, and <num value="2">two</num> rich pendants or drops; there are <num value="5">five</num> small drops in the centre. 
<p><num value="4">Four</num> windows, very like the western, fill the spaces next the roof; in all of them are more or less of painted glass, of <num value="3">three</num> lions, fleur-de-lis, and red, yellow, and blue panes, having quatrefoil arches, with embattlements. Under the windows the architect and his sculptor have exerted their utmost abilities; and exquisite indeed are the canopies, niches, and their statues, which they have left for our admiration: there are <num value="5">five</num> between each pillar; trios of <num value="2">two</num>-part pinnacled buttresses form the divisions: the canopies are semisexagons; their decorations and open-work are beautifully delicate; over them is a cornice, and a row of quatrefoils; and the battlement is a rich ornament of leaves: the statues all stand on blank labels; and, although the outline of the pedestals are alike, the tracery and foliage differ in each: beneath those is the continuation of half-length angels, before described on the west wall. <pb id="p.97" n="97"> 
<p>As many of my readers are most probably unacquainted with the legends of Roman Catholic saints, I shall describe the statues as they stand, without appropriating them; those who are conversant in legends will name them from their emblems: the <num value="1">first</num> <num value="5">five</num> to the north-west are cardinals and divines; the next a figure with St. Peter's keys on his hat; the <num value="2">second</num> holding a mitre; the <num value="3">third</num> a prelate, whose hand is licked by a dog, St. Roch; the <num value="4">fourth</num> a fine studious old man, St. Anthony, reading, a pig at his feet; the next a prelate blessing a female figure kneeling before him; the next compartment a bishop reading, with a spindle in <num value="1">one</num> hand, a king, and a bishop wresting the dart from death, who lies prostrate under his feet; under the <num value="4">fourth</num> window, a priest uncovering the oil for extreme unction; St. Lawrence, with the gridiron, reading; a venerable old man, with flowing hair, bearing something (decayed) on a cushion; a priest, and the <num value="5">fifth</num> a female, probably a prioress. 
<p>On the south side, commencing at the great arch which separates the nave from the chancel, a king reading, an oldman reading, <num value="1">one</num> playing on a flute, St. Sebastian naked bound to a tree, and a figure with a bow. Further on, a bishop with his crosier in the left hand, with his right he holds a crowned head placed on the corner of his robe; a queen, a bishop with a crosier and wallet, a king with a sceptre; <num value="1">one</num> with a head in his left hand, St. Dennys; the <num value="5">fifth</num> a bishop. Under the <num value="3">third</num> window, the <num value="1">first</num> statue is removed, a bishop reading; St. George and the dragon; a mitred statue supporting a child with a tender and compassionate air; the filth a priest in a devout attitude. The last division, a female holding a label; a cardinal reading; <num value="1">one</num> with a label; another cardinal; also another reading. 
<p>There are <num value="8">eight</num> statues belonging to the great arch before mentioned, <num value="4">four</num> on each side; <num value="2">two</num> of those are a continuation of the niches, and the others over them; the statues consist of a prelate before a desk, with a lion fawning on him; another reading. Above, <num value="2">two</num> religious, about the same employment; those are on the south: <num value="1">one</num> on the opposite side, <num value="1">one</num> of the figures is gone, the other is a bishop giving the benediction, the upper ones, reading statues of old men. 
<p>The chancel is semi-octagonal, and consists of <num value="5">five</num> sides; the windows are like the others, the eastern has a painting of an old man in fine colours; the angels, niches, and enrichments are continued round; the statues are a female saint kneeling, a coronated female, a monk with a boy singing by his side; <num value="1">one</num> mutilated; a figure bearing a cross in his right band, and reading, another with a spear and book, St. Thomas; a fine animated statue consecrating the contents of a chalice; a pilgrim; <num value="1">one</num> reading. 
<p>It is with difficulty the eastern figures can be seen, from the cross lights; but the <num value="1">first</num> is St. Peter, 
<p>The south-east side bas a statue reading, another in meditation; a <num value="3">third</num> giving the benediction, and <num value="2">two</num> bearing what cannot be <pb id="p.98" n="98"> discerned; the next a female, an old man; a pilgrim, a female, holding a tower on her left hand, and reading, and a saint with his book, supported by a cross. 
<p>These <num value="73">seventy-three</num> statues are all so varied in their attitudes, features, and drapery, that it is impossible to say any <num value="2">two</num> are alike; the disposition of their limbs is seen through the clothing; and the folds of their robes fall in those bold, marked lines, which is the characteristic of superior sculpture and painting. Why cannot some of our artists follow this art, instead of dividing their drapery like rolls of parchment tied together at <num value="1">one</num> end? 
<p>The arch which forms the division between the nave and the chancel is bounded by clustered pillars, its intercolumniation is another proof of the consummate skill of the great architect; the variety and beauty of the divisions I shall attempt to describe, from the base upwards. <num value="2">Two</num> niches are the <num value="1">first</num> ornaments, but the statues are gone. Their pedestals are octagonal; the shafts adorned with arched pannels, and the frieze with foliage, fighting dragons, grape vines, and shields with roses; the niches are surmounted by pointed arches foliaged and embattled. On the pillar between them, angels bold a rose on the north side, and a portcullis on the south; the portcullis broken; and the figures broken by the wooden canopies: these last are supported on the sides by greyhounds and dragons. <num value="2">Two</num> crowns in alto relievo over them have been nearly beaten to pieces. Each niche has <num value="2">two</num> slender pillars on their backs, with delicate groins, roses, &amp;c. but they differ; other decorations consist of oak branches and acorns. Above the great arch over the niches are pannels and quatrefoils, and a frieze of branches and roses, with a cornice and battlements. The next compartment has the arms of Henry VII. under an arch, with the dragon and greyhound as supporters; <num value="2">two</num> angels issue from the side pillars, and suspend the crown over the arms; but they have been under the fangs of the destroyer on both sides. Another frieze of branches, with a foliaged battlement crosses the intercolumniation; higher are <num value="2">two</num> lozenges with squares, each containing <num value="4">four</num> circles, and in them quatrefoils; the next are the angels, and niches over them, which have been noticed before; the arch across the roof is filled with pannels in <num value="2">two</num> ranges, divided at intervals by ovals and quatrefoils, containing badges; the extreme lines of the arches are indented with small arches. 
<p>The east ends of the side aisles are formed into beautiful little chapels, before which is the basement of their screens; the screens gone. The lower part is a range of circles, and quatrefoils, roses, and fleurs de lis; higher are arches, and quatrefoils, with a frieze of dragons, greyhounds, and sprigs, the top embattled, but almost worn smooth. From this other ornaments, forming the top of these circular screens, once arose. 
<p>They both bad grand altar-pieces; and, wonderful to tell, they have been but little injured; the marks of the altars are visible still; <pb id="p.99" n="99"> over them are arched pannels, surmounted by quatrefoils, on which is a row of angels, with the king's badges, and above <num value="3">three</num> superb niches, whose ornaments and canopies are extremely rich. On the top of the middle <num value="1">one</num> is a seated lion, and on the right the greyhound; to the left a dragon; the centre niche in the south chapel is empty, but the right contains a statue, about <num value="4">four</num> feet high, of a venerable man, who reads from a book, resting on the hilt of a sword. A mitred figure on the left was probably intended for St. Dionysius; for he supports with much veneration a mitred head, which has been cut off. These are both noble figures, with excellent drapery, and faces full of expression; the reading figure is almost as fresh as when new; the sides of the chapel and the whole of the lower parts of the building, have waved windows, whose ichnography is thus <sic>~~</sic>; the west-ends are similar to the east, from the pavement to the angels, above which, they are pannelled, and terminate to the shape of the roof in foliaged arches. These windows have been restored. 
<p>The ceiling consists of several circles pannelled; and in the centre is a lozenge within a lozenge, containing a circle, and <num value="8">eight</num> quatrefoils round a lozenge, on which is a rich fleur de lis. 
<p>The enormous quadrangular tomb of Lewis, duke of Richmond, with his and his lady's recumbent effigies, almost fills the chapel. He died <datestruct VALUE="1623-02-16"><month reg="02">Feb.</month> <day reg=16>16</day>, <year reg=1623>1623</year></datestruct>, the duchess on the <datestruct VALUE="1689-10-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct>. The figures are finely cast; but the statues of Faith, Hope, Charity, and Prudence, caryatides supporting the canopy, are most excellent, and their drapery wonderfully correct; the artist, to avoid the appearance of too great weight, has most absurdly pierced the canopy into a number of fantastic thin scrolls, and a crest within the garter. Fame on the top is too vehement; but the flaming urns are close copies of the antique; a clumsy black pyramid and urn, to the memory of the infant Esme, duke of Richmond, defaces the east end of the chapel. The <num value="2">two</num> unburied coffins of Spanish ambassadors were removed from this chapel several years ago. 
<p>In the north chapel the figures over the altar are, a fine statue holding a book, with a tame lion at his feet, and on each side a priest; where the altar stood is a black tablet, to whom is not legible. The preposterous monument of George Villiers, duke of Buckingham, who was stabbed at Portsmouth, August <num value="231628">23,1628</num>, has demolished all the decorations at the west end. 
<p>The windows contained painted glass of the arms of Edward the Confessor, Henry the <num value="7">seventh</num>, his initials, a crown on a tree,<NOTE>Alluding to the finding of Richard's Crown at Stoke, near Bosworth-field.</NOTE> with the red rose and fleur de lis; but little now remains, being newly glazed. The north-east recess is like the chapel in its roof and windows; and on the west end the decorations of niches and statues are perfect. The centre is St. Sebastian; on the left a soldier, and the right a martyr, with an imperfect instrument of torture on his neck. A monument by Scheemakers stands where the altar <pb id="p.100" n="100"> did, and was erected to the memory of John Sheffield, duke of Buckinghamshire, who died at the age of <num value="75">75</num>, <datestruct VALUE="1720-02-24"><month reg="02">Feb.</month> <day reg=24>24</day>, <year reg=1720>1720</year></datestruct>; in addition to the titles and employments usually held by persons of his rank, be bears the name of an author, and that of the friend of poets. Dryden was honoured by him with a monument, and Pope with the care of his works for the press; his creed I shall introduce from the tomb:

<p>The tomb is <num value="1">one</num> of the handsomest in the abbey, and the figure of the duke (in Roman armour) is well imagined. It consists of a sarcophagus, on which are the recumbent figures of the duke and his duchess in their robes of estate. Near the angles of the tomb are <num value="4">four</num> pedestals surmounted by lofty obelisks, and, by the side of them, sitting in mournful attitudes, are Mars, Neptune, Pallas, and Benevolence. On different parts of the tomb are boys, skulls, cyphers, &amp;c. Behind them are groups of armour and military ensigns, and, in the middle, upon an elevated bracket, is a figure of Fame, with medallions in alto relievo of the deceased children of the duke. 
<p>The eastern recess is like the others in every respect, and once contained <num value="6">six</num> statues; the middle <num value="1">one</num> on the south side is gone; those on its sides are venerable prelates; opposite is St. Peter, and Edward the Confessor, with (probably) his queen. As the figures just mentioned are much decayed, as well as some on the south side, were they not removed from an ancient building, perhaps the chapel of St. Mary taken down to make room for the present structure? The materials are not the same, nor is the workmanship like the others. 
<p>The south-east recess is perfect, with the marks of an altar. The oaken stalls destroy <num value="1">one</num> half of the beauty of the chapel; for by them we are deprived of the arches of the aisles, with their rich ceilings. They are much inferior to the stone work, but parts of them are certainly finely imagined, though others are heavy and incongruous. On the tops of the pinnacles the helmets, crests, and swords of the knights of the Bath are placed, and from the band of angels, large banners of the same companions are suspended so close together as to bide each other, and destroy a complete view of the chapel. When an installation takes place, the sovereign's seat is on the right side of the nave, at the west end; the knights are ZZZ SO FAR <pb id="p.101" n="101"> seated in the upper ranges, and the esquires on those next the pavement; the arms, names, and titles, engraved on brass plates, are fastened to the backs of the stalls. The seals are fixed to the wall by hinges; when they are down, nothing is to be seen; upon turning them back, we find those improper representations, which were the disease of the times when they were carved. Many of them possess an irresistible whimsicality of thought, most ludicrously expressed; such as apes gathering nuts; another drinking, a bear playing on the bagpipes; <num value="2">two</num> figures with their hands tied across their knees; a woman flagellating the exposed posteriors of a man; another beating a man with a distaff; a man distorting his mouth with his fingers; a giant picking the garrison of a castle out over the walls; an ape overturning a basket of wheat; a figure seated on a <foreign lang=fr>pot de chambre</foreign>, an ape pulling it away; the figures are much broken; a fox in armour riding a goose; a cock in armour riding a fox; a devil carrying off a miser; and many others too indecent to describe: some are serious; for instance, the judgment of Solomon, David and Goliah, &amp;c. Those which represent flowers, as many are in the <num value="1">first</num> state of preservation, are all of wood. 
<p>To give an accurate description of the roof of the nave is nearly impossible; when we reflect on the geometrical precision necessary to put together such a mass of stone, formed into hanging arches, pendants, &amp;c. we must at once pronounce both the architect and mason adepts in their professions. Each pendant is formed into pannelled rays, with a <num value="1000">thousand</num> beautiful ornaments, and the whole, when viewed from either end of the chapel, presents a crowded, yet distinct and grand whole. 
<p>The east end of both the aisles have had altars, and over them the same kind of beautiful niches and ornaments that adorn the recesses in the nave; the statues on the north are a king, St. Lawrence, and a saint who had succeeded in taming a dragon; the middle niche in the south aisle is empty; on the left is a female coronated, resting a book on the hilt of a sword, with the point of a prostrate man's cap; the other, a female with her hands in prayer on a long staff, on which is a cross, with the ends in a dragon's jaws. Both of the west ends have large windows, full of intersecting arches, with many panes of painted glass; and those on the sides have scraps still remaining; they are representations of the red rose, fleur de lis, a rose half red, and half white, port-cullis, and the initials <emph>H. R.</emph> The entrance is through beautiful arches, whose ceiling, as well as those of the aisles, is rich in the ornaments so often mentioned. 
<p>At the west end of the north aisle is an enclosure (party hidden by the press, in which is kept the effigies of queen Elizabeth) whose sides are adorned with pannels, and a frieze and battlements of much beauty, which has probably been a sacristy, or vestry, for the use of the chantry priests. The aisle contains the <pb id="p.102" n="102"> 
<div2 type=section id="c.2.22"><HEAD>Tomb of Queen Elizabeth.</HEAD>
 
<p>This is a sumptuous and lofty pile of the Corinthian order, though of far less grandeur than that of her rival and victim Mary queen of Scots in the south aisle. It consists of a low basement pannelled with projecting pedestals, on which stands <num value="10">ten</num> columns of black marble, having bases of white marble and gilt capitals; these support an enriched entablature, crowned by a semicircular canopy. In the recess is a thick slab supported by <num value="4">four</num> couchant lions, on which is a recumbent figure of the queen finely executed in white marble. Her attire is regal, but the crown that originally adorned her brow is gone; and the sceptre and mound which she held in her hands have been broken. The point lace frill of her chemise is turned back upon a broad plaited ruff, below which was a collar of the order of the garter, cast in lead and gilt; but the last portion of this was stolen when the iron railing was removed in <datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>.

<p>It should seem that this spot is peculiarly appropriated for children; for here lay Sophia and Mary, daughters of James I.; the former with a cradle, and the latter a pretty little altar-tomb, with an effigy of the infant. This aisle contains <num value="2">two</num> other tombs; an exceedingly heavy <num value="1">one</num> to George Saville, marquis of Halifax, who died in <datestruct value="1695--"><year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="62">62</num>, and that to Charles Montague, earl of Halifax, infinitely better imagined; and yet it is nothing more than a pedestal with vases and a pyramid.

<p>In the south aisle, the tomb of Margaret Tudor, mother of Henry VII. demands our <num value="1">first</num> notice; for the effigy of brass gilt is, without exception, <num value="1">one</num> of the best figures in the abbey. It is supposed to be the workmanship of Torrigiano; it is an altar-tomb of black marble; the front is divided into <num value="3">three</num> compartments by ornamented pilasters, between which are wreaths of flowers enclosing the royal arms.

<p>Scheemakers and Kent were employed to make a monument for the duke of Albemarle, which occupies the <num value="1">first</num> arch at the east end; it has a rostral column, with the duke in armour, a medallion, and weeping figure, turning her eyes upwards; her left elbow leaning on the medallion, sword, bullet, &amp;c. arranged without taste, and poorly executed. On the pedestal is this inscription:--

<p>This is an elaborate and costly pile, like that of Elizabeth. It is principally of the Corinthian order, and of similar design, but its dimensions and elevation are much greater. It is constructed of different coloured marbles, and consists of a plinth, which has <num value="4">four</num> projecting pedestals on each side, which sustain <num value="8">eight</num> columns supporting the entablature, and a canopy; beneath which, upon a sarcophagus ornamented with lions' heads, &amp;c. is a recumbent figure of the queen. She wears a close coif and a laced ruff; her mantle is lined with ermine, and fastened over the breast with a jewelled brooch. Her feet rest against a seated lion, crowned, supporting the emblems of sovereignty.

<div2 type=section id="c.2.25"><HEAD>St. Edmond's Chapel.</HEAD>
 
<p>St. Edmond was archbishop of Canterbury, and the anniversary held at his altar was on the <datestruct VALUE="-11-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> day of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>; the indulgence granted to those who attended it at mass is not known. An ancient wooden screen divides it from the aisle; the ascent to it, and to that of St. Nicholas, is by a single step, and another leading into the body of the chapel. 
<div2 type=section id="c.2.26"><HEAD>Tomb of William de Valence.</HEAD>
 
<p>The tomb of William de Valence, earl of Pembroke, half-brother <pb id="p.108" n="108"> to Henry III. who died at Bayonne, in France, on <datestruct VALUE="1296-05-13"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=13>13</day>, <year reg=1296>1296</year></datestruct>, stands on the right side of the door. It is an altar-tomb of stone, with <num value="4">four</num> quatrefoils, and as many shields on the sides, and little pannels with leaves at the ends, a broken wooden sarcophagus, with his effigy of oak lies on it, the right foot broken off. This was once plated with gilt copper; the cushion is enamelled with little golden circles on a blue ground; in them a quatrefoil of light blue, and on them a red cross. Between them are diminutive shields, <hi rend=italics>gules</hi>, <num value="3">three</num> lions <hi rend=italics>or.</hi> Visitors have rubbed the cushion, and in those places the colours, rich beyond description, are nearly perfect. His vest has small shields spread upon it, but they appear to be all broken off, except <num value="1">one</num>; the marks where they have been are still visible, and many of the nails left in. The sword hilt is enamelled with a blue ground and fanciful gold ornaments, with roses, &amp;c. the colours of which are perfect. The shield is of enamel, and contains barry of <num value="10">ten</num> <hi rend=italics>ar.</hi> and <hi rend=italics>az.</hi> an orle of martlets, gu. almost in the state when, <num value="1">first</num> made. A broken border of shields buried in dust remains on the side next the screen, with traces of enamelled lozenges of blue and white, and the lions may be discovered with great difficulty between the legs. Almost all the traces are stripped off from the sarcophagus, and the arches which once enclosed the statues are nearly broken away. Thus his tombs originally uncommonly splendid, is rendered even more wretched than many of its neighbours. Prayers offered up at the remains of Valence would have procured <num value="100">one hundred</num> days indulgence soon after his interment; now the only indulgence his effigy receives is from the kindness of the dean's respectable verger, who some time since carefully nailed down the corners of the broken copper. 
<div2 type=section id="c.2.27"><HEAD>Monument of John of Eltham.</HEAD>
 
<p>The alabaster monument of John, earl of Cornwall, on the eastern side of the door, is shamefully injured; but what remains of the decorations and statues are beautifully spirited. The effigy is cross-legged. It had originally a canopy of <num value="3">three</num> arches, and must then have ranked among the richest in the church. On his left arm is a neater shield charged with his arms, viz. <num value="3">three</num> lions of England within a bordure of fleurs-de-lis. The effigy is less injured than almost any other in this chapel. The statues are some of them gone; only <num value="2">two</num> remain perfect on the north side: but on the east side <num value="3">three</num> are perfect. At the west end are <num value="3">three</num> statues; the middle has the head broken off. <num value="2">Two</num> of the shields remain in a perfect state.

<p>Near it is a little altar-tomb of Petworth marble, with diminutive effigies of William of Windsor and Blanche de la Tour, children of Edward III.; the latter died in <datestruct value="1340--"><year reg="1340">1340</year></datestruct>. The feet of William are sawn away. In the corner is a slab of stained marble, more <pb id="p.109" n="109"> curious from that circumstance than worthy notice from any elegance in the ornaments or richness in the colours. It is inscribed:

<p>A monument to the children of Henry III. is in the intercolumniation, between the chapel of St. Edmond and that of St. Benedict; it now serves as a writing-desk to the person who attends at the gates of the south aisle; its top is covered with boards, and on them are the paper, pens, and ink. This cover serves to hide the rich Mosaic work, which either doth, or more probably did adorn it; that on the front is reduced to the marks in the stucco of the sparkling materials that once adhered to it, now gone to an unit: it is broken as with the end of a stick. 
<p>The back of the niche, over the table, has a red painted ground much decayed, on which are very imperfect traces of <num value="4">four</num> children, whose draperies are a dirty yellow; the mouldings of the arch still show fragments of gildings and spots of red, as do the capitals of the pillars. Above this, are the remains of a painting evidently defaced on purpose; what it has been cannot be discovered on the closest inspection; there are, besides, marks where a statue has stood, which Strype gives us reason to suppose was of silver. 
<p>By the side of Richard the <num value="2">2nd</num>'s tomb below in the aisle is an ancient slab, which had formerly a brass figure and inscription, commemorating sir John Golofre,, who died in <datestruct value="1396--"><year reg="1396">1396</year></datestruct>.

<div2 type=section id="c.2.28"><HEAD>Chapel of St. Benedict.</HEAD>
 
<p>The chapel of St. Benedict was without doubt, dedicated to the abbot of that name, who was styled the Great, founder of the holy order of Benedictines, and whose anniversary was held on the <datestruct VALUE="-03-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>; and not to St. Benedict, abbot of Ware, who had an anniversary on the <datestruct VALUE="-01-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>. 
<p>This chapel has no door: a screen of monuments and their railings enclose it from the south transept and the aisle. 
<p>Mr. Malcolm gives the following account of his researches in this chapel:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>I <num value="1">first</num> visited the east side, in order to know whether any thing was left of the altar, where it was the custom to grant indulgences of <num value="2">two</num> years and <num value="40">forty</num> days to those who heard mass. I found an altar, but it is to the tomb of Frances, countess of Hertford, whom effigy lies precisely where the candlesticks and host formerly stood. The lay died <datestruct VALUE="1598-05-14"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=14>14</day>, <year reg=1598>1598</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="44">forty-four</num> years; and probably this tomb was erected within <num value="2">two</num> years after, when the <num value="2">two</num> steps to the altar were made to serve as basements to it. The platform is strewed with dust; but I scraped and washed till I found that great part of the original glazed-tile pavement is still in being, but entirely deranged, and without a symptom of regularity in their disposition. The steps are of coarse marble, but were probably covered with carpeting in times of ceremony. On the south wall, near the altar, is a plain long stone bracket; what its use may <pb id="p.113" n="113"> have been I know not, but it probably supported small moveable statues of the saint; or possibly his scapula, which was among the numerous relics belonging to the church, might at times have rested on it.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The oldest tomb in this chapel is that of 
<div2 type=section id="c.2.29"><HEAD>Simon de Langham.</HEAD>
 
<p>He was monk, prior, and afterwards abbot of this monastery, archbishop of Canterbury, and a cardinal. He died July <num value="221376">22,1376</num>, at Avignon in France, and founded a chantry for the souls of his father and himself. 
<p>This monument is of the altar form, and the sides are adorned with quatrefoils and shields of arms; the effigy robed and mitred is exceedingly well sculptured, particularly the face and profile. It had a canopy, of which nothing remains. On the verge is the following inscription in raised letters :

<p>Another was erected to William Bill, dean of Westminster, <datestruct value="1561--"><year reg="1561">1561</year></datestruct>; and a <num value="3">third</num> to dean Goodman, <datestruct value="1601--"><year reg="1601">1601</year></datestruct>; both these tombs are very black and decayed.<NOTE><BIBL>Malcolm i. <num value="147">147</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>As the door leading to Palace-yard is open in all kinds of weather, the damps confined in this corner, without light or circulation of air, have corroded the walls and some of the tombs greatly; the arches and the wall are otherwise uninjured on the south side. 
<p>In the midst of the pavement is a great tomb, with recumbent effigies of the earl and countess of Middlesex in their robes of estate, with coronets on their heads. He died <datestruct VALUE="1645-08-6"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=6>6</day>, <year reg=1645>1645</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="70">70</num>; the countess died <datestruct VALUE="1647-06-25"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=25>25</day>, <year reg=1647>1647</year></datestruct>. 
<p>Here is a pretty tablet to the memory of George Sprat, <datestruct value="1883--"><year reg="1883">1883</year></datestruct>. 
<p>At the entrance of this chapel, near the monument of the earl of Middlesex, was interred the celebrated dramatist, Francis Beaumont, who died <datestruct VALUE="1615-03-9"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=9>9</day>, <year reg=1615>1615</year></datestruct>. Here also is interred Isaac Casaubon, who died July <num value="81604">8,1604</num>. In this chapel is a blue marble slab to Dr. Vincent, dean of this church, who died <datestruct VALUE="1815-12-21"><month reg="12">December</month> the <day reg=21>21st</day>, <year reg=1815>1815</year></datestruct>. 
<p>St. Benedict's chapel is the last on the south side of the church, and is entirely surrounded with iron rails, which prevent access to the monuments. 
<p>This circumstance, though in some measure to be regretted, conduces greatly to their preservation from the rude unhallowed touch of curiosity, which in many instances, totally defaces these interesting relics of antiquity.

<div2 type=section id="c.2.30"><HEAD>King Sebert's Monument.</HEAD>
<p><FIGURE id="Fig.114"><HEAD>King Sebert's Monument</HEAD></FIGURE> 
<p>On the opposite side of the aisle is the tomb of Sebert, king of the East Saxons, and Ethelgeda, his queen. Over the lower part is a plain arch or recess; the back contains <num value="2">two</num> arched pannels, <num value="3">three</num> quatrefoils, with roses in their centres, and <num value="2">two</num> lozenges over them. At the west end has been a painting, part of which is entirely destroyed; but the despoilers have left a head of much grace and expression bending forward, probably St. Catherine kneeling before the Virgin and Christ, as there is at present (but the thick paint is chipping off, and that which yet remains is loose to the touch,)a representation of the wheel called after that saint on the opposite side of the tomb. The colours of the face of the saint are very clear and good, the hair a light chesnut, a cap on her head is vermillion, and in perfect preservation; the drapery is of white, and little mote than outlines. On the roof of the arch some colour seems to have been blistered off by the heat of burning candles, or torches placed under it at funerals. The horizontal moulding of the top of the stone-work is continued beyond the recess to the pillars, and supports an oaken canopy of <num value="4">four</num> compartments, having quatrefoils on their pointed summits, which fill the intercolumniation. The back part of this, or south side, is divided by <num value="3">three</num> buttresses, into <num value="4">four</num> compartments; the <num value="2">second</num> from the left hand contains fragments in distemper of St. Edward the Confessor, so broken, tattered, and destroyed, that nothing but a ladder and perseverance can trace any thing of it; the <num value="3">three</num> others are for ever lost. On the north side facing the altar, are other paintings, engraven many years since by the Society of Antiquaries. These pictures are <pb id="p.115" n="115"> supposed to have been the work of Pietro Cavalini, an Italian artist of great merit. 
<p>The height of the enclosure is <num value="13">13</num> feet, <num value="9">9</num> inches, to the top of the finials; and each compartment is about <num value="2">two</num> feet <num value="7">seven</num> inches wide, being separated from each other by small buttresses. They were originally adorned with a full-length figure in each, painted in oil colours on a ground of plaister, as ancient an example of the art as is to be found in the kingdom, being undoubtedly of.the period of Henry III. or of Edward I. The small pillars, from which the arches of the several compartments take their spring, were white diapered with black in various patterns, while the capitals and bases were gilt; but have been all painted black in the recent alteration. 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> compartment has been supposed to exhibit king Sebert. It must be observed, <QUOTE> says Mr. Moule,<NOTE><BIBL>Antiquities in Westminster Abbey, folio.</BIBL></NOTE> </QUOTE> that this is merely presumed to be the representation of Sebert, to whom historians agree in attributing the <num value="1">first</num> foundation of a church at Westminster. There is certainly no objection to be urged as to the identity of the portrait, and it may reasonably be supposed that he would be honoured with the stall nearest the altar. 
<p>This figure is the most perfect of the series, and merits particular attention from the fine state of preservation in which it remains. A venerable personage is represented, bearing in his right hand a sceptre of ancient form, terminating in a pinnacled turret, with his left hand raised in a commanding manner; his head is crowned with a diadem ornamented with strawberry leaves painted on a gold ground; and his beard, of silvery whiteness, is long and curled, with mustachios; his tunic is rose-coloured, worked on the borders and bottom with white and red; his hose are purple, and his shoes of blue damask, buckle over the instep with a small gold buckle; the ground upon which the figure is painted is a reddish brown, and he is represented standing on a lawn or carpet studded with flowers, &amp;c.; the white gloves on his hands are unadorned with embroidery, and his crown and sceptre, whatever may have been their original appearance, are now of a darkish brown colour. 
<p>The next pannel or division of the screen exhibited only a small portion of a painting which was formerly concealed, the greater part of it having been purposely planed off, and it is now entirely obliterated, having been painted over a wainscot colour, at the late repairs. 
<p>The figure appeared to have been that of an ecclesiastic; and it may be supposed that the screen or enclosure contained figures of a king and bishop (or saint) in alternate succession. This series, it may without presumption be assumed, was continued round the whole choir. The sacerdotal robe was represented of pure white, edged with lace and rich fringe, the colours of which were green, white, and red; the ends of the stole were seen, as well as the <pb id="p.116" n="116"> bottom of the under garment, or alb, which reached down to the feet, ornamented with a diapered hem, in squares and lozenges, very curiously worked with a mosaic pattern, in which green, red, blue, and white, were alternately introduced. The lower part, and point of the crozier was also seen; the buskins were purple, but quite plain; at least no ornament could be discerned upon them. The ground of the picture had been a dark brown, and the figure was represented standing on a lawn, or carpet of green, with small sprigs. 
<p>The <num value="3">third</num> compartment is, without hesitation, considered to represent Henry III. 
<p>This portrait, upon comparison, is found greatly to resemble the features of the cumbent figure of the monarch upon his tomb in this church. It is painted upon a dark brown ground, which is semee of golden lions, passant guardant, in allusion to the charge, in the royal arms of the kings of England, of the house of Plantagenet, a very early instance of heraldic decoration. 
<p>The figure of the king is well drawn, and the folds of the drapery are particularly easy and gentle, but very indistinct at the lower extremity; his countenance is mild and expressive; the figure is in action, and evidently commanding attention to the passing scene. He is represented crowned, and in regal robes; the mantle of a murrey colour, is lined with white fur, and guarded with broad lace, and is fastened on the right shoulder by a fibula of a lozenge form. His tunic, which is scarlet, is bound round the waist by a girdle of very rich workmanship, fastened with a gold buckle; his gloves also are ornamented on the back of the hand and the bottom of the little finger, with embroidery; the monarch bears in his right hand a sceptre of ivory, terminating in a rich finial of gold. 
<p>From the other pannel the figure is obliterated, the paint having been entirely scraped off the surface by a plane or some such instrument. The pictures that have been suffered to remain are highly curious and interesting, as ancient examples of painting in oil applied to pictures. 
<p>Not the least interesting part of this venerable abbey is the

<p>Samuel Butler. It appears by the inscription on this tomb, that it was erected by John Barber, esq. lord mayor of London, that he who was destitute of all things when alive, might not want a monument when dead. He was author of Hudibras, a man of consummate learning, pleasantry, and wit, and peculiarly happy in his <pb id="p.119" n="119"> writings.

<p>The last monument which that eminent statuary, Roubiliac, lived to finish, is erected to the memory of George Frederick Handel. The figure is very elegant, and bears a strong likeness to the original. Beneath is this inscription:--

<p>Over the last is a monument representing Garrick in an ancient habit, pushing aside a veil which hung before a medallion of Shakspeare, on the top of a pyramid. Lower down are the tragic and comic muses. The figures are all graceful in their motion, but rather disproportioned; the thought deserves praise. It is by Webber:--

<p>Near the above is a monument to the memory of that great recorder of our antiquities, William Camden, who is represented in a half-length within a pointed niche, in strict costume, with his left <pb id="p.126" n="126"> hand resting on a book, and in his right his gloves, on the body of which is an inscription, in Latin, setting forth his indefatigable industry in illustrating the British antiquities, and his candour, sincerity, and pleasant humour in private life.

<p>In Poet's Corner there are many names to be met with on the pavement, too considerable to he passed over in silence. Among these are to be found Thomas Parr, of the county of Salop, born in <datestruct value="1483--"><year reg="1483">1483</year></datestruct>.

 lie the remains of that once celebrated poet, who, upon the death of Ben Jonson, succeeded him as poet-laureat to Charles I.

<p>About the middle of the transept are <num value="2">two</num> large slabs, inscribed to the memory of sir R. Chambers, and William Adams, both eminent architects. Another is inscribed to Dr. Johnson, adjoining whose tomb Garrick was buried without an inscription. 
<p>A few feet east of Camden's monument is interred the remains of William Gifford, esq. editor of the Quarterly Review. He died <datestruct VALUE="1826-12-31"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=31>31</day>, <year reg=1826>1826</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="71">71</num>.

<p>Affixed to the pillars in this place are <num value="2">two</num> table monuments, <num value="1">one</num> to the memory of Dr. Samuel Barton, and the other to Dr. Anthony Horneck. 
<p>Before we finally quit Poet's Corner, we must not omit to take some notice of the present vestry, called the 
<p>Chapel of St. Blase.<NOTE>The site of the old chapel of St. Blaze is occupied by the tomb of Shakespeare, &amp;c. in poet's corner, says Mr. Malcolm, but on what authority I know not; neither do I think him correct in thus correcting his <num value="1">first</num> statement, which is, that this vestry is in fact the site of that chapel.--<BIBL>Brayley.</BIBL></NOTE>
 <pb id="p.127" n="127"> 
<p>It is entered by a strong wooden gate immediately under the great south window, and is a dark, damp, and gloomy chamber, in great part filled by large wooden presses used to hold the surplices of the choristers, &amp;c. 
<p>St. Blase was a bishop and martyr, and had his anniversary on the <datestruct VALUE="-02-3"><day reg="3">third</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></datestruct>. The indulgence granted at his altar, marks of which are still visible, was for <num value="2">two</num> years and <num value="20">twenty</num> days. 
<p>At the east end of the chapel is a strong plain pointed arch, about <num value="2">two</num> feet in depth, painted in alternate red and white zigzags. The ground of the back part is a dark olive, on which is a painted niche of deep red, formed by <num value="2">two</num> ill-shaped pillars supporting a light blue angular canopy, edged with yellow, as are the pinnacles. On the capital of a pillar stands a female saint, coroneted, whose under vestment is blue, and the outer purple. Her right hand, <QUOTE>holding a book, crosses her breast, with the fore-finger pointed to a square, crossed by <num value="5">five</num> bars held in her left by a ring on a line with the book. I cannot decide who this figure is intended to represent; nor can I suppose it designed for the blessed Virgin. Though there are many faults in the drawing and in the proportions, there is still an air of graceful dignity throughout the figure, improved by the correct folds of the drapery. It is much injured by the darkness and dampness of the situation. An oblong compartment crosses the arch at her feet, formed into <num value="4">four</num> lozenges of yellow within squares; in the centre is the painting of the crucifixion, with the Virgin and Mary Magdalen on the sides. The figure of the Saviour is a true representation of a lifeless body, and the linen round it is formed into very correct folds. The figure on the right hand is far superior to that on the left: her under garment is green, and the outer purple; the colours of the vestments on that of the other Mary are the same. The artist seems to have failed most in the hair of the heads. On the left side of the</QUOTE>  arch, a little higher than the altar, is a praying Benedictine monk, from whose mouth issues an address to the saint, in Saxon characters, now nearly illegible. <num value="2">Two</num> steps of coarse stone to the altar remain; the lower projects into a semicircle. The pavement is of small red tiles. In the south wall, near the altar, is a deep recess, and over it <num value="2">two</num> large windows, now dark. They have each <num value="1">one</num> mullion and a quatrefoil in the arch. A vast pier, carried into a strong arch, --crosses the roof; and from hence westward it is higher than the rest. The ribs spring from capitals on heads of rude workmanship and ghastly effect, but are extremely firm and strong. A fence of deal boards defaces the west end of the chapel. Over it, high in the wall, is an iron-grated window, which opens into a space of considerable width; and in the wall of that is a smaller glazed window. 
<p>The chapel is destitute of any other light than what streams through it. There are recesses in the north wall, <num value="1">one</num> like that over the altar, and another flatter, with pillars and mouldings. An <pb id="p.128" n="128"> ancient oaken pulpit,<NOTE>This is the old pulpit from the choir.</NOTE> with a diminutive sounding-board, stands on the south side; the only furniture of the place besides are the plain presses, already mentioned. Abbot Littlington, who died <datestruct value="1386--"><year reg="1386">1386</year></datestruct>, was buried near the door of the porch, and against the altar of this chapel, his brass statue and inscription have been long since removed. 
<p>Proceeding from what is strictly called Poet's corner to the south aisle, the monument of Sophia Fairholm <num value="1">first</num> strikes the eye. It is a sarcophagus, over which is a wreath of flowers, surmounted by the family arms. We are informed, by the inscription, that she died <datestruct VALUE="1716-12-13"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=13>13</day>, <year reg=1716>1716</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="49">49</num>. 
<p>A small oval tablet is affixed to the wall, to the memory of Ann Wemyss, daughter of Dr. Lodowick Wemyss, some time prebendary of the cathedral; and of Mrs. Jane Bargrave, his wife, who departed this life <datestruct VALUE="1698-12-19"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=19>19</day>, <year reg=1698>1698</year></datestruct>, in her <num value="67">67th</num> year. 
<p>Under is a neat tablet to the memory of William Dalrymple, midshipman, eldest son of sir John Dalrymple, bart. <num value="1">one</num> of the barons of the exchequer in Scotland, and of Elizabeth Hamilton Mackgill, representative of the viscounts of Oxford; who, though heir of ample estates, preferred the toilsome and perilous profession of a seaman to the indulgences necessarily attendant on opulence. At the age of eighteen he was killed off the coast of Virginia, in an engagement, in which captain Salter, in the Santa Margaretta, took the Amazone, a French ship, of superior force, almost in sight of the enemy's fleet; receiving in the public dispatches of his skilful and generous commander, every honorable testimony of his exemplary virtue and brave conduct.

<p>Sir Cloudesly Shovell, knt. This monument is of the composite order. Sir C. is represented as reclining on a cushion, under a canopy of state, surmounted by his crest; an angel on the top of each pillar bears heraldic emblems of the family. Behind the pillars, between pilasters, are sea-weeds, &amp;c. In the base is finely represented a storm, and the ship striking on a rock.

<p>Next is a very neatly executed monument to the memory of William Wragg, esq. consisting of a tablet of while marble, crowned with a fascia, supporting the figure of Memory in a musing attitude, over an urn, enriched by marine ornaments; in the centre is a <pb id="p.129" n="129"> representation of the fatal accident that happened, when he, with many more, was drowned <datestruct VALUE="1777-09-3"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=3>3</day>, <year reg=1777>1777</year></datestruct>. His son, who accompanied him, was miraculously saved on a package, supported by a black slave, till he was cast on shore on the coast of Holland. 
<p>Adjoining is a monument to the memory of Thomas Knipe, S. T. P. erected by Alice, his <num value="2">second</num> wife.

<p>Over Stepney's is a monument erected to the memory of John Methuen, esq. who died in the service of his country in Portugal, <datestruct VALUE="1706-07-13"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=13>13</day>, <year reg=1706>1706</year></datestruct>, and was interred here, <datestruct VALUE="1708-09-17"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=17>17</day>, <year reg=1708>1708</year></datestruct>. 
<p>Also to that of his son, the right honourable sir Paul Methuen, of Bishop's Canning, Wilts, <num value="1">one</num> of his majesty's most honourable privy council, and knight of the most honourable order of the Bath, who died <datestruct VALUE="1757-04-11"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=11>11</day>, <year reg=1757>1757</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="86">86</num>. 
<p>A neat small monument of white marble is erected to the memory of Dr. Isaac Watts. It is divided by a fascia, over which a bust of that eminent divine is exhibited, supported by genii. Underneath, in a circle, is a fine figure of the doctor, sitting on a stool, as in deep contemplation, which is finely expressed by an angel opening to him the wonders of creation, in <num value="1">one</num> hand he holds a pen, and with the other points to a celestial globe. His name and the dates of his birth and death, are inscribed on the plinth:--

<p>The whole is as fresh as if just erected. Either by design or accident, the head, and right hand of the angel, are broken off. 
<p>Sir Richard Bingham. On a plain marble stone, surmounted by the family arms, is an English inscription, reciting the military glories of the knight to whom it is inscribed. He died <pb id="p.130" n="130"> at Dublin <datestruct VALUE="1598-01-19"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=19>19</day>, <year reg=1598>1598</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="70">70</num>; from whence he was brought and interred here by John Bingley, some time his servant. Sir Richard was of the ancient family of the Binghams, of Bingham Melcomb, in Dorsetshire, and served in the reign of queen Mary, at St. Quintin's; in the reign of queen Elizabeth, at Leith, in Scotland; in the Isle of Candy, under the Venetians; at Cabo Chaio, and the famous battle of Lepanto, against the Turks; in the civil wars of France, in the Netherlands at Smerwick. After this, he was made governor of Connaught, in Ireland, where he overthrew and expelled the traitorous O&lsquo;Rourke, suppressed the rebellion, and was finally made marshal of Ireland, and governor of Leinster. 
<p>Major Richard Creed. This is a table monument against the wall, to his memory, erected by his mother. He was the eldest son of John Creed, of Oundel, esq. and Elizabeth his wife, only daughter of sir Gilbert Pickering, bart. of Tithmarsh, in Northamptonshire, At the battle of Blenheim, in <datestruct value="1704--"><year reg="1704">1704</year></datestruct>, he commanded those squadrons that began the attack; in <num value="2">two</num> several charges he remained unhurt; but in the <num value="3">third</num>, after receiving many wounds, still valiantly fighting, he was shot through the head. 
<p>George Churchill. A monument of the Doric order is erected to the memory of this great man, who was <num value="2">second</num> son of sir Winston Churchill, of Dorsetshire, knight, and brother of John, duke of Marlborough. He died <datestruct VALUE="1710-05-8"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=8>8</day>, <year reg=1710>1710</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="58">58</num>. Churchill was early trained to military affairs, and served with great honour by sea and land in the reigns of Charles II. James II. and William and Anne. He was a captain in the English fleet at the burning of the French at La Hogue in king William's reign; and for his bravery there was made <num value="1">one</num> of the lords commissioners of the Admiralty. In the succeeding reign he was made admiral in chief. 
<p>His monument consists of a flaming urn, on which recline <num value="2">two</num> cherubs, the <num value="1">one</num> weeping, the other in an expression of hope, surmounted by the arms and a crest, supported by <num value="2">two</num> variegated, marble pillars. 
<p>Over the last mentioned monument, is a Doric <num value="1">one</num>, erected to the memory of Martin Folkes, of Hillington, in the county of Norfolk, esq. He died on the <datestruct VALUE="1754-06-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct>, at the age of <num value="63">sixty-three</num>. He is represented sitting, with his hands resting on a book, shut, as if contemplating; above is an urn, surmounted by drapery, held up by a boy; there are <num value="2">two</num> more boys, <num value="1">one</num> of whom seems observing a microscope, with his eye several inches from the eye-glass! while the other, with a pair of compasses, is measuring the globe. 
<p>Captain William Julius, who commanded the Colchester man of war, and a weeping figure, to the memory of general Strode, died <datestruct VALUE="1776-01-14"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=14>14</day>, <year reg=1776>1776</year></datestruct>, in th <num value="78">78th</num> year of his age. This is the last monument on the south side of this aisle, before we enter the gates, hereafter mentioned, into the nave. On the other side, but more easterly a door leads into the cloisters Scarcely a single arch on <pb id="p.131" n="131"> this side remains perfect; some have been patched and mended. On the other side is 
<p>Thomas Thynne, esq. This is a fine piece of statuary, surmounted by an urn, on each side of which is a trumpet, with large rich drapery, <num value="1">one</num> side of which is entirely broken off; in the centre is the coat of arms. The principal figure is represented in a dying posture, and at his feet a weeping figure. It bears this inscription:

<p>Upon the pedestal, in relieve, the story of the murder is forcibly depicted; but the figures are shamefully mutilated. 
<p>The next is a neat tablet to general sir Thomas Trigge, who died <datestruct VALUE="1814-01-11"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=11>11</day>, <year reg=1814>1814</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="72">72</num>. 
<p>Thomas Owen, esq. On this monument is a fine figure of a judge in his robes, leaning with his right arm on a cushion; in his left hand was formerly a roll, and over him is an inscription shewing that he was son of Richard Owen, esq. that from his youth he made the law his peculiar study, and that he died <datestruct VALUE="1598-12-21"><month reg="12">Dec.</month> <day reg=21>21</day>, <year reg=1598>1598</year></datestruct>. 
<p>Adjoining is a well executed bust of Pasquale de Paoli; an excellent likeness. He died in London, <datestruct VALUE="1807-02-5"><month reg="02">Feb.</month> <day reg=5>5</day>, <year reg=1807>1807</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="82">82</num> years. 
<p>On the clustered pillar is an oval monument, to the memory of James Kendall, esq. supported by a death's head, and on the top a close helmet much broken.

<p>Dame Grace Gethin. This lady, married to sir Richard Gethin Grot, in Ireland, (and famed for exemplary piety,) died <datestruct VALUE="1697-10-11"><month reg="10">Oct.</month> <day reg=11>11</day>, <year reg=1697>1697</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="21">21</num>. Her figure is represented kneeling between <num value="2">two</num> angels, <num value="1">one</num> presenting a crown, and the other a wreath. 
<p>Elizabeth and Judith Freke. On the face of this monument, which is of the composite order, there is a long inscription, setting forth the descent and marriages of these <num value="2">two</num> ladies, whose busts, in alto relievo, ornament the sides. They were the daughters of Ralph Freke, of Hannington, in Wilts, esq. Elizabeth was married to Percy Freke, of West Balney, in Norfolk, and died <datestruct VALUE="1714-04-7"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=7>7</day>, <year reg=1714>1714</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="69">69</num>.

They were both examples worthy of imitation. 
<p>Sir Thomas Richardson. This is an effigy, in brass, of a judge, in his robes, with a collar of S. S. representing sir Thomas Richardson, knight. He died in <datestruct value="1634--"><year reg="1634">1634</year></datestruct>, in his <num value="66">sixty-sixth</num> year. 
<p>William Thynne, of Botterville, esq. On this ancient monument of marble and alabaster, gilt, (now worn off) lies a warrior at full length, his head supported by a roll of matting, He died in <datestruct value="1584--"><year reg="1584">1584</year></datestruct>. 
<p>At the western extremity the aisle is crossed by a large iron gale, which was formerly always open to the public; but is now opened <pb id="p.132" n="132"> only during the cathedral service, or on the payment of threepence. The organ loft is on the north side. 
<p>The gate opens into the nave. The <num value="1">first</num> monument that strikes the eye on the left hand is the mutilated basso relievo to the memory of the unfortunate major Andre. The monument consists of a tomb, with Britannia and a lion mourning, on the front; the major is represented in the tent of general Washington, with a flag of truce, to solicit his pardon. The figures are most scandalously mangled and broken; and though, comparatively, a new monument, the head, hands, &amp;c. of some of the most prominent figures are totally gone. 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Sacred to the memory of major John Andre, who was raised by his merit at an early period of life to the rank of adjutant-general of the British forces in America; and, employed in an important but hazardous enterprise, fell a sacrifice to his zeal for his king and country, on the <num value="2">2</num>d of October, A.

<p>The execution, by Robert Adams and P. M. Van Gelder is not of the <num value="1">first</num> rate. 
<p>The next is a clumsy tomb, with a long epitaph by Mr. Dryden, to the memory of sir Palmes Fairbourne, governor of Tangier, where he was killed by a shot from the besiegers, <datestruct VALUE="1680-10-24"><month reg="10">Oct.</month> <day reg=24>24</day>, <year reg=1680>1680</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="46">46</num>. On a dome is the arms of the deceased. 
<p>The next is an exquisitely fine monument by Adams and Carter, to the memory of the honourable lieutenant-colonel Roger Townshend. 
<p>This monument consists of a pyramid of red and white marble, against which are <num value="2">two</num> caryatide Indians, in the complete costume of their country; the <num value="1">one</num> holding a gun, the other a tomahawk. These Indians support a ponderous sarcophagus, on which is a beautiful basso-relievo of a field of battle; in which, unfortunately for propriety, all the soldiers are Romans; as is also their general; the heads of <num value="2">two</num> are broken off. 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>This monument was erected by a disconsolate parent, the lady viscountess Townshend, to the memory of her <num value="5">fifth</num> son, the honourable lieutenant-colonel Roger Townshend, who was killed by a cannon-ball on the <datestruct VALUE="1759-07-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1759">1759</year></datestruct>, in the <num value="28">28th</num> year of his age, as he was reconnoitring the French lines at Ticonderoga, in North America. From the parent, the brother, and the friend, his sociable and amiable manners, his enterprising bravery, and the integrity of his heart, may claim the tribute of affliction. Yet, stranger! weep not; for, though premature his death, his life was glorious, enrolling him with the names of those immortal statesmen and commanders, whose wisdom and intrepidity, in the course of this comprehensive and successful war, have extended the commerce, enlarged the dominions, and upheld the majesty of these kingdoms, beyond the idea of any former age.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Over this, in the window, is a large handsome tablet by Cheere, with a globe and mathematical instruments, &amp;c. to the memory of sir John Chardin, bart. The globe exhibits a view of the different countries through which sir John had travelled. The motto <pb id="p.133" n="133"> beneath refers to the dangers he escaped, for which he ascribes glory to God :--<QUOTE lang=la>Nomen sibi fecit eundo</QUOTE>- <QUOTE> sir John Chardin</QUOTE> --

<p>Near this, but lower down, in the corner to the west, is a tablet to Mrs. Bridget Radley, wife of Charles Radley, esq. (gentleman usher, daily wailer to James II ) who erected this monument to her memory. She died <datestruct VALUE="1679-11-20"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=20>20</day>, <year reg=1679>1679</year></datestruct>. 
<p>A fine bust, pedestal, and curtain, perpetuate the memory of Sidney, earl of Godolphin, lord high treasurer of Great Britain, and prime minister in the reign of queen Anne. He died the <datestruct VALUE="1712-09-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1712">1712</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="67">sixty-seven</num>. The bust is richly attired. 
<p>A pair of tablets of sir Charles Harbord, knight, and Clement Cottrell, esq. is the next. They perished together during an engagement in the Royal James with the Dutch fleet, on the <datestruct VALUE="1672-05-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1672">1672</year></datestruct>. They were faithful friends; and their pathetic story is told at full length in the inscription. Cottrell was a volunteer, and though but <num value="22">22</num> years of age, understood <num value="7">seven</num> languages. 
<p>Over an old fashioned tablet to Diana Temple, and others of sir William Temple's family, in a window, is a curious monument, designed and executed by Roubiliac, to the memory of William Hargrave, esq. Mr. Malcolm is of opinion, that  <QUOTE>Europe can barely shew a parallel</QUOTE>  to this monument, which, however, is placed in a bad light, and is seen to great disadvantage from its height. 
<p>The following description is extracted from the Gentleman's Magazine.<NOTE><BIBL>Gent. Mag. vol. lxv. p. <num value="389">389</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>The figure of the general is supposed to be just re-animated, and rising in an extacy of joy, from the tomb in which he had reposed; behind him a pyramid is tumbling into ruins; at his head and below him, Time has just thrown Death backward, and is in the act of breaking his dart. The expression in Hargrave's face is admirable; it is a mixture of wonder and joy : every limb seems to strain forward, and every muscle is exerted to break from the grasp of death. The truth with which the pyramid is executed deserves every praise; a plain surface is converted by the chisel into a vast mass of stone falling in every direction. The figure of Time is fine; and the old broken feathers of his wings, torn with age and long use, are well worth examination. The skeleton seems to hang in agony by his broken spear, which is snapped by Time on his knee. The skull and bones are wrapped lightly round with drapery, and a crown drops from the head.</QUOTE>
 
<p>In this description is omitted the figure of a cherub in the clouds sounding the last trumpet. 
<p>A little farther west is the tomb of John Smith, esq. It is a design by Gibbs, the architect, and consists of a weeping female on a sarcophagus, with a medallion of the deceased in her right hand. 
<p>On the base is a Latin inscription setting forth his descent from the Smiths in Lincolnshire, issue, &amp;c. He died <datestruct VALUE="1718-07-6"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=6>6th</day>, <year reg=1718>1718</year></datestruct>. 
<p>On <num value="1">one</num> side of this is a tablet of Anne Fielding <num value="2">second</num> wife of <pb id="p.134" n="134"> 
<p>Samuel Morland, bart. who, it would seem, was a man of learning, by the Ethiopic and Hebrew inscriptions which he has made to the memory and virtues of his wife: the Hebrew is to this effect: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>O thou fairest among women! O thou virtuous woman: the hand of the Lord bath done this. The Lord gave and the Lord bath taken away, and blessed be the name of the Lord!</QUOTE>
 
<p>Of the Ethiopic, the following is a translation;-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Come, lament over this monument with a beloved husband for thee; but in certain hope that thou art united with Christ. 
<p>This lady was truly religious, virtuous, faithful, mild as a dove, and chaste while she continued in life, she was honoured; and is happy, through mercy, in death.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Under this latter inscription is the following: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Anne, daughter of George Fielding esq. and Mary his wife, the truly loving (and as truly beloved) wife of Samuel Morland, knight and bart. died <datestruct VALUE="1679-02-20"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=20>20</day>, <year reg=1679>1679</year></datestruct>-<num value="80">80</num>, Aetatis <num value="19">19</num>.</QUOTE>
 
<p>On the other side of Smith's monument is <num value="1">one</num> to the memory of another of sir Samuel Morland's wives: this, also, is much like the former, and has Hebrew and Greek inscriptions: this was the baronet's <num value="1">first</num> wife, Carola Harsnet. She died in child-bed of her <num value="2">second</num> son, <datestruct VALUE="1674-10-10"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=10>10</day>, <year reg=1674>1674</year></datestruct>, in the <num value="23">twenty-third</num> year of her age. 
<p>The Hebrew runs thus: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Blessed be the Lord, my wife was precious blessed be thy remembrance, O virtuous woman!</QUOTE>
 
<p>The Greek thus: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>When I think of thy mildness, patience, charity, modesty, and piety, I lament thee, O most excellent creature! and grieve exceedingly; but not like such a have no faith, for I believe and expect the resurrection of those who sleep in Christ.</QUOTE>
 
<p>In the window, over these singular tablets, and above the monument of John Smith, are <num value="2">two</num> fine figures of Hercules and Minerva, ridiculously employed in binding a serpent and a glass, the emblems of Wisdom and Prudence to his club, designed, I suppose, as an emblem of Valour. 
<p>These figures are to perpetuate the memory of James Fleming, major general of his majesty's forces, and colonel of a regiment of foot, who having served <num value="44">forty-four</num> years a commissioned officer, died <datestruct VALUE="1715-03-17"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=17>17th</day>, <year reg=1715>1715</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="68">68</num>. 
<p>At the top is a medallion of the general in a marble pyramid, with the inscription. This is <num value="1">one</num> of Roubiliac's tombs; but is not equal, in design, to some of his other productions. 
<p>Over the centre is another of Roubiliac's monuments: Mr. Malcolm calls it  <QUOTE>the <num value="3">third</num> in the scale of merit</QUOTE>  It is, however, a most stately monument, to the memory of general George Wade, field-marshal of his majesty's forces, &amp;c. &amp;c. 
<p>In this monument Fame pushes Time from a column, on which highly finished military trophies are suspended; on its base is the general's head in a medallion. A neat sarcophagus below is encircled with laurel, and contains the inscription. 
<p>On the right to the door is a monument to Robert Cannon, D.D. <pb id="p.135" n="135"> dean of Lincoln, and prebendary of this church, who died <datestruct VALUE="1722-03-28"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=28>28</day>, <year reg=1722>1722</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="59">59</num>. 
<p>On the left of the door is a neat pedestal surmounted by a line bust, to the memory of Charles Herries, esq. colonel of the light horse volunteers of London and Westminster. He died <datestruct VALUE="1819-04-3"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=3>3</day>, <year reg=1819>1819</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="74">74</num>. 
<p>The adjoining arches are entirely demolished; the side ones have been attempted to be restored. 
<p>A neat design by Gibbs. In the centre is a monument erected by Mrs. Mary Pope to the memory of her friend Mrs. Katherine Bovey, who died <datestruct VALUE="1726-01-21"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=21>21</day>, <year reg=1726>1726</year></datestruct>-<num value="7">7</num>, aged <num value="57">57</num>. The principal figures are Faith with her book closed, and Wisdom lamenting the death of her patroness. Between these is a lady's head in an annulet of black veined marble. Over this the inscription. 
<p>Over Mrs. Bovey, in the window, is a figure of the imaginary genius of the province of Massachusetts Bay, lamenting the loss of George Augustus viscount Howe, brigadier-general of his majesty's forces in America, who was slain <datestruct VALUE="1758-07-6"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=6>6th</day>, <year reg=1758>1758</year></datestruct>, on the march to Triconderoga. 
<p>As it was not possible the artist could rightly imagine the genius of a distinct province, and as this happened to be an American province, perhaps he would have been farther from the truth had his figure been more unlike  <QUOTE>a representation of melancholy intoxication;</QUOTE>  though certainly lord Howe merited a better companion to lament his loss. 
<p>Near to this is a bust of the rev. John Thomas, LL. D. bishop of Rochester, and dean of this collegiate church. The inscription is in Latin, and rather long; and, as usual, sets forth the worthy prelate's innumerable virtues, qualifications, and  <QUOTE>profound learning.</QUOTE>  The bust is very good; besides which there is a lamb bearing the cross, a chalice, sacramental bread, mitre, crosier, and books. This is <num value="1">one</num> of Bacon's productions. Dr. Thomas died <datestruct VALUE="1793-08-20"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=20>20th</day>, <year reg=1793>1793</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="81">81</num> years. 
<p>Near this is an exquisite bust, by Tyler, of the truly learned Dr. Zachary Pearce. This bust stands on a pedestal, and the features are said to have a striking resemblance to those of the original. It is enough to say that this is the prelate who wrote the well known  <QUOTE> Commentary on the holy Evangelists and the Acts of the Apostles,</QUOTE>  a work of great learning and research, and highly esteemed among the orthodox. He died June <num value="291774">29,1774</num>, aged <num value="84">84</num>. 
<p>The arches that remain under the next window are coloured black. They contain the monument of sir Samuel Robinson, bart. of Kentwell-hall, in Suffolk. He died <datestruct VALUE="1684-08-6"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=6>6th</day>, <year reg=1684>1684</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="36">36</num>; and another of porphyry, inlaid with white marble flowers, and foliage of great taste and beauty. On it <num value="2">two</num> very elegant children hold and read a label. 
<p>On the pedestal is an oval tablet adorned by inlaid scrolls, which contains a basso relievo of a north-west view of the Abbey, <pb id="p.136" n="136"> apparently well done, and <num value="2">two</num> figures of Faith and Hope on each side. The inscription, which is in Latin, is to the memory of Dr. Joseph Wilcocks, bishop of Gloucester, and afterwards of Rochester, also dean of this church. He died <datestruct VALUE="1756-03-9"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=9>9th</day>, <year reg=1756>1756</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="83">83</num>. 
<p>Near this is a monument, with a very long Latin inscription, to Dr. Thomas Sprat. He died <datestruct VALUE="1713-05-20"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=20>20</day>, <year reg=1713>1713</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="77">77</num>. 
<p>Above these monuments is <num value="1">one</num> of a most singular description, as far as concerns the design. It is to the memory of Richard Tyrrell, esq. vice-admiral of the white. Mr. Malcolm has conceived so very justly of the design of this monument, that I shall make no apology for the verbatim insertion of his description :-- <QUOTE>To comprehend it,</QUOTE>  says that able critic,  <QUOTE>the spectator must suppose himself in a diving bell at the bottom of the sea. When he has shaken off the terrors of his situation, he will find on his right hand the Buckingham, of <num value="66">sixty-six</num> guns, jammed in a bed of coral.

<p>The next arch is filled with a circular pedestal and bust, by Rysbrack, to the memory of John Friend, M. D. He died <datestruct VALUE="1728-07-26"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=26>26</day>, <year reg=1728>1728</year></datestruct>. 
<p>Near this, in an oval frame, is a half-length marble portrait of William Congreve, esq. placed on a pedestal of fine Egyptian marble, and enriched with dramatic emblematical figures. He died <datestruct VALUE="1728-01-19"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=19>19</day>, <year reg=1728>1728</year></datestruct>. 
<p>In the south-west corner is a fine monument of the right hon. James Craggs, secretary of war in <datestruct value="1717--"><year reg="1717">1717</year></datestruct>, and secretary of state in the year following. The statue is as large as life, and leans on an urn, bearing in gilt letters the inscription. His epitaph, by Pope, is on the base of the monument. 
<p>It would be useless to particularize the demolition of every arch and carvings under the windows: all the windows are partly filled by stone-work, exclusive of the monuments in them. The great pillars for the towers are formed by <num value="16">sixteen</num> small ones; and the <pb id="p.137" n="137"> arches across the roof of the nave from these are extremely strong and massy. Under the last window of the south aisle is a door; over it a gallery of oak, pannelled, with small arches, and a range of quatrefoils; behind it a strong flat arch, in which is a door. At the west ends, under the towers of both aisles, are lancet-shaped windows; in the point of each arch blank trefoils; the lower part of that to the north is filled by a poorly executed figure in stained glass, of a bearded old man, in a crimson vest, and blue and yellow mantle: the colours, both of the drapery and ill-shaped canopy, are wonderfully clear and brilliant. Under him is a portcullis, and a double triangle: this is generally said to represent Edward the Confessor. In the south window is a king, completely armed, of the house of Lancaster, as appears by the red rose. Under him are the arms of Edward the Confessor. This is not by the same artist who stained the other, if we may decide from the colours; besides, the latter is a more finished performance, though rude. This window was probably made about the time when that part of the nave was completed, which has key-stones of the Lancastrian rose, that is, between the years <datestruct value="1399--"><year reg=1399>1399</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1461--"><year reg=1461>1461</year></datestruct>. If Islip had put them up, we should have had the red and white roses. After all, the king may be intended for Henry IV., V., or VI. The above figures are generally well imagined, and the colours of the drapery very clear. On the right side of the door is a pedestal and sarcophagus, with boys of bronze hanging a medallion on a pyramid, by Cheere, to the memory of John Conduit, master of the Mint. A stone arch has been turned over the west door, on which is erected a monument, voted by the parliament to the memory of the right hon. William Pitt, who died on the <datestruct VALUE="1806-01-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>. This illustrious statesman is represented as he appeared in the British senate, habited in the robes of the chancellor of the exchequer. To the right of the base of this statue, History, in a reclined attitude, is recording the chief acts of his administration, whilst Anarchy, on the left, lies subdued and chained at his feet. The statues composing this group are of the proportions of <num value="9">nine</num> feet in height, executed by Richard Westmacott, R. A. 
<p>On the left side of the door is a very good reclining figure with a boy weeping by an urn; but absurd, from the Roman costume: it has the usual accompaniments of a sarcophagus and pyramid on the pedestal, thus inscribed:

<p>The screen which formed the enclosure under the south tower has been removed for a magnificent monument, whose base and pyramid are of rich Sicilian jasper, <num value="36">thirty-six</num> feet high, designed and executed by Taylor, and erected by order of king George the <num value="2">Second</num>, on the unanimous vote of the House of Commons. On it is a double arched rock of white marble, with laurel and plants growing in the interstices, cannon, anchors, and flags at the sides. In the rock are <num value="2">two</num> cavities: in the <num value="1">one</num> a Latin epitaph is inscribed; in the other, is a view of the sea-fight off Toulon, in bas-relief, representing a fleet engaged, remarkably well done, both in the fore-shortening the vessels, and the construction of their rigging. On the fore-ground the Marlborough is seen fiercely engaged with admiral Navarre's ship, the Real, of <num value="114">114</num> guns, and her <num value="2">two</num> seconds, all raking the Marlborough fore and aft. On the rock stand <num value="2">two</num> figures, the <num value="1">one</num> represents Britannia under the character of Minerva, accompanied with a lion; the other figure is expressive of Fame; who having presented to Britannia a medallion of the hero, supports it while exhibited to public view: the medallion is accompanied with a globe and various honorary crowns, as due to valour. Behind the figures is a lofty-spreading palm-tree, whereon is fixed the hero's shield of arms, together with a laurel-tree, both of which issue from the natural barren rock, as alluding to some heroic and uncommon event.<NOTE><BIBL>Gentleman's Magazine, vol. xxv. pp. <num value="86">86</num>, <num value="90">90</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> The marble is so strangely corroded, that little more of the inscription can be read than the name of James Cornwall, who commanding the Marlborough, a <num value="90">ninety</num> gun ship, lost his life in an engagement with the Spanish admiral's ship off Toulon, <datestruct VALUE="1744-02-11"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg=11>11</day>, <year reg=1744>1744</year></datestruct>, in the memorable fight under Matthews and Lestock. 
<p>Under the north tower is the belfry, the ancient door of which remains, the rest of the screen is hidden by a circular pedestal, and behind it an Ionic tablet and pediment: Minerva is represented in the act of removing a curtain from a medallion, with books, square, and compass, at her feet; a boy holds the plan of a fortification, to the memory of William Horveck, esq. 
<p>Near the same is a tablet, with sarcophagus and flag:--

<p>In the centre of the belfry is a handsome monument to the memory of captain Montague. He is represented as large as life, <pb id="p.139" n="139"> standing with his right hand resting on his sword, and his left on his hip; behind him is a figure of Victory, with a wreath and branch of laurel.

<p>The architecture of the sides over the pillars is exactly the same with those of the north transept before described: many of the key-stones are adorned with rich foliage, iron keys, a Catharine wheel, and some other devices. Several of the pillars in the choir, to the <num value="3">third</num> in the nave, are filleted with brass; the remainder with stone. The gate of the choir is a flat arch, with an obtuse foliaged <num value="1">one</num> over it, and pinnacles on the side pillars: the spaces on the right and left are filled by the monuments of Newton and earl Stanhope; the former is on the left, and represents him leaning and reposing at full length, with <num value="4">four</num> books under his arm, in an antique robe. Upon a sarcophagus near him are <num value="2">two</num>-winged boys, with labels, who appear to be speaking.

<p>The next arch is nearly bricked up, but has an iron casement, with quatrefoil tracery above. 
<p>The south side, whose west end has a pointed entrance. On the wall, close above it, are fragments of black letter inscriptions, on serpentine labels, too distant and decayed to be legible. In the <num value="1">first</num> key-stone, once a shield, is an ancient iron pulley for a lamp. The <num value="1">first</num> arch contains a door with double pillars to the sides, the mouldings terminating in a pinnacle. This leads to the carpenters' lumber-yard; far different was its former use. Over it, without the cloisters, is a range of brackets that supported the roof of the refectory, and below them many pointed windows that lighted the hall. There are <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> statues in these windows, which are now filled up. Through this door the monks passed to their meals; those are the only ones that remain to shew us the situation and length of the dining-hall, which was that of the cloister. <pb id="p.150" n="150"> 
<p>Returning to the cloisters, in the arch on the right, are <num value="4">four</num> lancet-shaped niches, said to have been used as a lavatory. Among numerous tablets is <num value="1">one</num> with a bust of Edward Tufnel, the architect. The last, or open, arch has <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> tablets illegible. 
<p>The east side. In the <num value="1">first</num> division is a pedestal, sarcophagus, and reclining reading statue, erected to Daniel Pultney.

In the <num value="2">second</num> arch is a strong prison-like door, and over it a tablet to lieutenant general Henry Withers, not legible.

In a recess where was a door, a tablet for John Savage, S. T. P. 
<p>The ancient chapter-house has, or rather had, the arch over its entrance most magnificently adorned with carving, gilding, and painting. On each side are <num value="3">three</num> pillars, between them foliage. <num value="1">One</num> range of the mouldings contain circular scrolls which have been gilt, and the depths coloured black, another scarlet. A <num value="3">third</num> space is divided into small niches by waved scrolls; within them are <num value="20">twenty</num> imperfect statues. Here are the Blessed Virgin and infant Jesus, and king David, much broken. Fragments of the paint and gilding adhere on various parts of them, enough to shew their former splendour ; the centre is divided into <num value="2">two</num> arches; <num value="1">one</num> containing a door and window, and the other a window latticed and glazed. The mouldings of those are scrolls, and are supported by a head; a plane between them has been painted with white foliage on a red ground, and the outside ones in compartments of golden flowers. Between the arches is a broken carved bracket without a statue. On each side are <num value="2">two</num> others, the right sustains a headless, and almost wingless angel, whose right arm has been elevated; the left is nearly destroyed, but its outline is like the other; they appear to have been exceedingly correct figures. Directly before this door-way the vaulted roof of the cloisters has a greater number of ribs than the rest, and some of the key-stones are rich in carving and gilding, but beyond they are fewer than before. On the spot where the centre statue stood over the door, a tablet has been erected to Elizabeth Moore, who died in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="35">thirty-five</num>. She was wife to Thomas Moore, librarian to the church. The outward wall opposite contains <num value="3">three</num> pillars within its arch, which is filled with <num value="13">thirteen</num> pierced quatrefoils, almost destroyed by the weather. Others of those arches have <num value="3">three</num> trefoils, and <num value="4">four</num> ovals. The remainder of the divisions on the east wall are alike, and have <num value="3">three</num> arches within each, with a string of gold, once about <num value="3">three</num> inches broad, extending horizontally about <num value="3">three</num> yards from the pavement. The wall was painted of a dark faded colour, on which are numbers of white trefoils. The tablets ZZZ SO FAR <pb id="p.151" n="151"> placed on it are, to lieutenant general George Walsh, esq. colonel of the <num value="49">49th</num> regiment of foot; died October <num value="231761">23,1761</num>, aged <num value="73">73</num>.

Opposite, over a door, <num value="1">one</num> for lieutenant general the honourable William Barrel, governor of Pendennis Castle, and colonel of the king's own regiment of foot. 
<p>The north side. A very strong arch crosses the east end. The mouldings over the arch of the great door leading to the south aisle are numerous, and richly carved. All the key-stones of the roof are scrolls. Quaterfoils have embellished the outward arches, but they are now reduced to imperfect circles by the weather. <num value="9">Nine</num> pointed windows filled up, may be seen from this side over the roof of the south cloister, which belonged to the refectory before noticed. The <num value="1">first</num> <num value="4">four</num> divisions on the side of the church are like those mentioned on the east side, except in the painting and gilding. 
<p>In the south walk all the abbots of this church, from Vitalis to Humez inclusive, except Arundel were interred. But there are now only <num value="4">four</num> gravestones which record their names. The <num value="1">first</num> represents an abbot arrayed <foreign lang=la>in pontificalibus</foreign> with a pastoral staff, above is inscribed <foreign lang=la>GISLEBERTUS CRISPINUS ABBAS, <datestruct value="1114--"><year reg="1114">1114</year></datestruct></foreign>, adjoining is another figure with a mitre, and above <foreign lang=la>LAURENTIUS ABBAS</foreign>. An immense slab of dark blue marble, known as Long Meg of Westminster, is inscribed <foreign lang=la>GERVASIUS DE BLOIS, ABBAS, <datestruct value="1160--"><year reg="1160">1160</year></datestruct></foreign>, another stone is inscribed <foreign lang=la>VITALIS ABBAS <datestruct value="1082--"><year reg="1082">1082</year></datestruct></foreign>. 
<p>Having surveyed the whole of this venerable structure, with as much care and circumspection as possible, few, if any, monuments of interest have escaped observation; nor have I failed to call in the assistance of such authors as have gone before me, in this pleasing, but laborious task. 
<div1 type=chapter id="c.3" n="3"><HEAD>History and Topography of St. Margaret's Parish.</HEAD>
 
<p>This and the adjoining <num value="1">one</num> of St. John's forms the ancient city of Westminster, and originally formed but <num value="1">one</num> parish, St Margaret's. The dismemberment took place in <datestruct value="1728--"><year reg="1728">1728</year></datestruct>. The bounds of this parish are as follows: commencing at Whitehall stairs it takes a western course on the north side of the Banquetting-house, through the carriage entrance of the Horse Guards, across the park to near Cumberland gate, thence on the west side of Stafford-place, by <pb id="p.152" n="152"> Elliot's brewery, along the common sewer behind Bedford-place, Trelleek-terrace, and Pembroke-place, Vauxhall-bridge-road; to pear the turnpike, where it turns to the north-east behind the Military Hospital, and Rochester-row, to the east side of the Green Coat school, down Artillery-place and Old Pye-street, up New Pyestreet along Orchard street, and part of Great Smith-street, to the south side of Dean's Yard, along College-street, up Abingdon-street, and then finally, on the east side of the same street, to Parliament stairs. 
<p>In this parish is <num value="1">one</num> church: 
<div2 type=section id="c.3.1"><HEAD>St. Margaret's.</HEAD>
 
<p>This edifice, which is situated on the north side of the abbey church, near Henry the <num value="7">Seventh</num>'s chapel, was founded by Edward the confessor in the year <datestruct value="1064"><year reg="1064">1064</year></datestruct>, for the convenience of the monks, attached to the conventual church, and was dedicated to St. Margaret the virgin, and martyr of Antioch. Being in a ruinous state it was rebuilt, in the reign of king Edward I. by the merchants and other parishioners, the chancel excepted, which was built at the expence of the abbot of Westminster, about the year <datestruct value="1307"><year reg="1307">1307</year></datestruct>. 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1735"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>, this church was not only repaired, but the tower cased, and mostly rebuilt, at a charge of <measure value="3500l." type=currency><num value="3500">three thousand five hundred</num> pounds</measure>, granted by Parliament, in consideration of its being looked upon as a national foundation, for the use of the House of Commons. It had before been repeatedly repaired, particularly in the years <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>, <datestruct value="1651--"><year reg="1651">1651</year></datestruct>, and <datestruct value="1682--"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct>, when the north gallery was rebuilt at the sole charge of sir John Cutler, knight and baronet, for the benefit of the poor. 
<p>In <datestruct value="1758--"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct>, it was repaired at the expense of <measure value="4000l." type=currency><num value="4000">four thousand</num> pounds</measure>, also given by parliament. It was also repaired in <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>. The plan of the church gives a nave and side aisles, with a chancel at the east end, which is internally octagonal and externally square. A square tower with a staircase attached to its south east angle, and octagonal buttresses to the other angles, projects from the <num value="1">first</num> division from the west of the north wall. The tower is in <num value="4">four</num> stories, in the north front of the <num value="1">first</num> is an entrance, under a low pointed arch, surmounted by a square cornice, above which is a pannel with the following inscription:

 <pb id="p.153" n="153"> 
<p>In the west side is a low arched window divided by mullions into <num value="3">three</num> lights, this is <num value="1">one</num> of the original windows of the church ; the east front has no window or opening, the south side of the nave abuts on the church ; the <num value="2">second</num> story has a large window of <num value="4">four</num> lights in the north front divided horizontally b a transom, and the head of the arch occupied by subarches and quaterfoil divisions; this window is also original, in the west front is a circular opening, the east front is also unoccupied: the <num value="3">third</num> story which is cleat of the church has a circular opening, covered with a square-headed cornice in every aspect, the north and west fronts have each dials. The <num value="4">fourth</num> story has a large arched window enclosed in a square-headed recess, in every aspect it is filled with mullions, forming a bungling imitation of the ancient window below, and in the spandrils are cherubs; the elevation is finished with unsightly battlements, the <num value="4">four</num> octangular buttresses are continued in height above the parapet, the ancient finish is destroyed, and paltry pinnacles notched at the angles substituted. From the centre of the platform rises an octangular turret of wood ending in a cupola, sustaining a flag staff. The west front of the church has an entrance in the centre, partly modernized, the enriched spandrils remain, but jambs and imposts of Roman architecture have been inserted in lieu of the ancient columns; this entrance is covered by a porch of Batty Langley's Gothic, which defies description. Above this is a large arched window, the ancient mullions destroyed, and uprights of Roman architecture substituted for them; this window is walled up, similar windows occupy the ends of the aisles, the elevation is finished with a plain parapet and coping. 
<p>The south side of the church has <num value="7">seven</num> windows, all of which have been treated as those in the west front; near the east end is an attached vestry, in the modern Gothic style, and a recurrence of the western porch; the clerestory retains its ancient windows unaltered; they are formed in pairs, and each is divided by a single mullion into <num value="2">two</num> lights with arched heads; the elevations finish as before. The east front has a large window in the centre of <num value="5">five</num> lights, made by mullions, with perpendicular divisions; in the head of the arch on each side is a small light, and above is a paltry imitation of an ancient rose window; the elevation finishes with some nondescript ornamental work, and at the angles are pinnacles as the tower. The aisles have windows of <num value="4">four</num> lights in the worst style of modern Gothic, below which are low arched entrances; the elevation finishes with Chinese battlements. The north side has <num value="6">six</num> open windows of the same description as in the other aisle, and <num value="1">one</num> blank window; on this side a single buttress remains; the clerestory is a copy of the other side. From this description it will be seen that the church has been completely modernized by the tasteless architect employed by the House of Commons; the former decorations were beautiful specimens of ancient architecture; the present the worst examples of carpenters' Gothic; the modern <pb id="p.154" n="154"> appearance given to the church by the entire new ashlaring of Portland stone completes the character of the exterior. The lower story of the tower forms a porch with groined ceiling; it communicates with the church by an arch in which is an original pointed door-way with enriched spandrils of a handsome design. 
<p>The interior retains more of its ancient features; the nave and aisles are divided by <num value="7">seven</num> pointed arches springing from the usual clusters of columns; the spandrils are enriched with quatrefoil pannels; a sweeping cornice bounds the arches springing from corbels carved with angels holding scrolls, above the columns, from which also spring small columns attached to the walls of the clerestory, and sustaining the arched supports of the roof, which is entirely covered with modern pannelling, sustained on trusses in the form of low pointed arches with pierced spandrils. The internal termination of the chancel, as before observed, takes an octangular form, and is highly ornamented, though much of the false taste which prevails in the exterior is observable; it is separated from the church by a handsome and spacious pointed arch, the modern columns of which have Prince-of-Wales's feather capitals; on the side walls are niches containing paintings of Moses and Aaron in chiaroscuro; the ceiling is groined; in the centre is a large division, painted with the descending dove. The <num value="3">three</num> eastern divisions in the chancel have each a window; the <num value="2">two</num> lateral ones are filled with poorly designed tracery, and derive a false light from the small windows before noticed in the exterior; below the windows are the usual inscriptions: the central division is occupied by the great east window, below which is the altar screen, which is composed of <num value="5">five</num> arches, with canopies in the style of an altar-tomb of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century; the <num value="3">three</num> central arches are recessed, and contain the altar; the <num value="2">two</num> lateral ones niches, having seats for the officiating clergymen thrust into them; at the back of the recess and just above the table, is a relief of the  <QUOTE>Meeting at Emmans,</QUOTE>  copied from Titian's painting of that subject. The entire chancel was rebuilt in its present form, and the existing decorations added in <datestruct value="1758--"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct>. A gallery is erected at the west end, in which is the speaker's pew; behind this is the organ in a richly ornamented case; other galleries occupy the aisles, the fronts are pannelled in the style of the church. The pulpit and desks are situated on different sides of the centre aisle in front of the altar rails; the former is richly but clumsily carved in oak; it stands on a pillar, and is sustained by flying buttresses copied from Henry <num value="7">Seventh</num>'s chapel. The pulpit and desks were <num value="1">first</num> set up in <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>, at which time the speaker's seat was removed to the gallery. The glory of this church is its splendid east window, representing the whole history of the Crucifixion of our Lord, and the <num value="2">two</num> Thieves. These figures are so extremely well executed that there may be seen the muscles of each limb, occasioned by the different positions in which they are expanded on the crosses. 
<p>In the centre compartment is our Saviour on the cross; over his <pb id="p.155" n="155"> head the letters INRI; an angel on the right side holds <num value="2">two</num> chalices to catch the blood from the wounds in the hands and side; a <num value="2">second</num> on the left hand has a single chalice for the wound in that hand, and a <num value="3">third</num> acts in like manner at the feet. 
<p>Round the cross of the Saviour, are the Roman officers and soldiers attending the execution, with some of the chief rulers among the Jews. At the foot are Mary Magdalen, and Mary, the wife of Cleophas, and sister to the Virgin Mary, who stands in the front, and is represented as fainting away. On the hem of her robe the letters M A J: D E: (mater, deo.) 
<p>On the right hand of the cross (which is on the left facing the window) is the Roman centurion on horseback, who, with a lance pierces our Saviour's side, from which blood and water are represented issuing. The horse whereon the Roman centurion sits, is finely executed, with full spirit and vigour. Behind the cross, a little to the left, is a small perspective view of the city of Jerusalem. On the right is the penitent thief; over his head an angel receiving his soul in the form of a child, and on the left the reviling thief; over his head the devil flying away with his soul on his back.<NOTE>Mr. Pennant records the meditated destruction of this fine window by a reverend zealot, who took offence at this whimsical representation.</NOTE>
 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> capital figure on the left hand, attending in a niche curiously delineated, is that of St. George of Cappadocia, the reputed patron saint of England, standing, completely armed at all points, holding in his hands, partly unfurled, a white banner charged with a red cross, and behind him lies at his feet a red dragon. This representation of him is not unlike that described by Eusebius, in his life of Constantine the Great, who erected his statue, and over his head was displayed a banner with the cross, and under his feet a dragon. The banner he holds is a symbol of his dying in defence of the cross; and the red dragon under his feet alluding to his conquest over that  <QUOTE> red dragon, the devil, who burneth with fury, and is red with the blood of the faithful.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Rev. chap. xii. v. <num value="3">3</num>. <title>Ornaments of Churches considered</title>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The <num value="2">second</num> figure on the right hand, standing in a niche, (like that of St. George) is that of Catharine the virgin, a martyr of Alexandria, holding in her right hand a book, and resting her left on a sword, her head encircled with a crown of glory. 
<p>At the bottom, towards the left, is a hermit holding something resembling a root, and looking up towards the virgin saint, drawn about breast high. On the right hand, towards the bottom, is part of a wheel, as an emblematical device of the manner by which she suffered martyrdom: hence the name of  <QUOTE> Catharine wheel,</QUOTE>  in use at the present day. This saint was martyred under Maximus I. emperor of the western monarchy, A. D. <datestruct value="455"><year reg="455">455</year></datestruct>. 
<p>The <num value="3">third</num> figure on the left hand, under St. George, is Henry VII. at his devotions, in his royal robes, crowned with a diadem, <pb id="p.156" n="156"> and kneeling under a canopy of state, in a small oratory, with a book before him. 
<p>The <num value="4">fourth</num> figure, on the right hand, under St. Catharine, is that of Elizabeth, Henry's consort, also at her devotions, and kneeling under a state canopy with a book before her: her devotion is expressed in a very lively manner in her countenance. 
<p>Above the whole is a row of <num value="6">six</num> small panes, in which are representations of angels attendant on the crucifixion. On the left hand, in a small pane, is the moon, and on the opposite side the sun, alluding to the preternatural manner of the darkness (the sun not being eclipsed, the moon being at full) at our Saviour's crucifixion. 
<p>On the left of these figures, and over the moon, is placed a white rose, within a red <num value="1">one</num>, to signify that the house of York was united to the house of Lancaster, in the person of Henry and Elizabeth. On the opposite side, and over the sun, is placed a pomegranate to signify the houses of Lancaster and York's descent from the royal house of Spain; John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, married Constance, the eldest daughter and coheir of Peter, king of Castile and Leon; and his brother Edmund of Langley, duke of York, (great grandfather of Elizabeth, wife of Henry VII.) married Isabel, the youngest daughter and coheir of the aforesaid king. The pomegranate <hi rend=italics>vert</hi> in a field-or. are the arms of Granada, in Spain, which kingdom was added to that of Castile, by Ferdinand V. A. D. <datestruct value="1478"><year reg="1478">1478</year></datestruct>, who united Spain into <num value="1">one</num> monarchy, having married Isabel queen of Castile and Leon. 
<p>Such is the description of this beautiful window. It is proper that some notice should be taken of the history of this ancient piece of workmanship. 
<p>The magistrates of Dort, in Holland, being desirous of presenting Henry VII. something worthy to adorn his magnificent chapel, then building at Westminster, directed this window to be made, which was <num value="5">five</num> years in finishing; king Henry and his queen sending their pictures to Dort, whence their portraits are delineated. 
<p>Henry dying before the window was-completed, it fell into the hands of an abbot of Waltham, who placed it in his abbey church, where it remained till the dissolution of that abbey by Henry VIII. in the year <datestruct value="1540"><year reg="1540">1540</year></datestruct>. To preserve it from being destroyed, it was removed by Robert Fuller, the last abbot of Waltham, to a private chapel at New Hall, an ancient seat belonging to the Butlers, earls of Ormond, in Wiltshire; which afterwards came into the hands of Thomas Boleyn, father of Ann Boleyn, Henry VIII.'s queen. 
<p>In the reign of queen Elizabeth, New Hall was in the possession of Thomas Ratcliff, earl of Sussex, and it was purchased from this family by Thomas Villiers, duke of Buckingham; his son sold it to general Monk, who having more taste than fell to the lot of most generals of his time, caused this window to be buried under ground, <pb id="p.157" n="157"> during the rebellion against Charles I. and the subsequent usurpation of Oliver Cromwell. Monk well knew, that the puritans would not fail to demolish this fine effort of genius and talent, as they had done several others, should it;fall into their Vandalic hands. It is said, that during these disgraceful times, painted windows of the most beautiful kind, even to the amount of <num value="800">eight hundred</num>, were destroyed by those wolves in sheep's clothing. 
<p>After the Restoration, Monk caused this window to be replaced in his chapel at New Hall. 
<p>In <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>, Christopher, duke of Albemarle, son and heir of the late general Monk, died without issue. This seat, therefore, devolved to his duchess, but she not chusing to reside there, it became ruinous and decayed. 
<p>The estate was afterwards purchased, of the heirs of the duke's family, by John Olmius, esq. who, in a few years, demolished the greatest part of the structure, including the chapel; the-window, however, he preserved, with a view to its being sold for some church. 
<p>For some time, it lay cased up in boxes, until it came to the knowledge of Mr. Conyers, when he purchased it for his chapel at Copthall, near Epping; and paid Mr. Price, a great artist in that way, a large sum for repairing it. It remained at Copthall till Mr. Conyer's son John built a new house, at some distance from the old seat, and having no further use for the window, sold it to the committee appointed for repairing and beautifying the church of St. Margaret's, Westminster. 
<p>Such is the history of this justly celebrated window; and it is not a little remarkable, that after the many dangers to which it has been exposed, and the progressive changes it has undergone, it should, after the lapse of <num value="300">three hundred</num> years, be found to occupy a place so immediately contiguous to the <num value="1">one</num> for which it was originally designed. 
<p>Of its antiquity no reasonable doubt can be entertained: the portraits of Henry VII. and his queen, and the several badges of the royal houses of York,. Lancaster, and Spain, which are found in the panes of this window are almost demonstrative of its age. 
<p>The side windows of the chancel are filled with stained glass, containing statues of St. Michael, and another with a book in his hand, and white and red roses, pomegranates, &amp;c. 
<p>In the vestibule at the west end of the church, is an ancient pew of oak, still existing; it is handsomely decorated with tracery, in the style of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, and is now used for the distribution of bread to the poor. 
<p>The font is a modern basin of marble, on a pillar of the same, totally devoid of ornament. 
<p>This church is in length l<num value="30">30</num> feet, breadth <num value="65">65</num>, height <num value="45">45</num>, and of the tower to the summit of the pinnacles, <num value="85">85</num> feet. 
<p>The monuments are very numerous, and are in a high state of <pb id="p.158" n="158"> preservation, a fact that confers great credit on the parochial authorities. At the east end of the south aisle are the following:--A neat marble tablet, surmounted by a bust of the deceased, to Mrs. Margaret Graham, who died <datestruct VALUE="1772-01-28"><month reg="01">Jan.</month> <day reg=28>28</day>, <year reg=1772>1772</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="75">75</num>.

<p>The next object of our notice is 
<div2 type=section id="c.3.2"><HEAD>Westminster Hall.</HEAD>
 
<p>The history of which abounds with incidents of the most important nature, and of the highest interest. 
<p>The old hall was built by William Rufus, in the year <datestruct value="1097"><year reg="1097">1097</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1098--"><year reg="1098">1098</year></datestruct>, at which place, on his--return from Normandy, the year following its completion,  <QUOTE>he kept his feast of Whitsuntide very royally.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Stowe's Annals, p. <num value="182">182</num>, and Hen. Hunt. Hist.</BIBL> who calls it the festival of Christmas.</NOTE> It was, therefore, <num value="1">first</num> used as a banqueting-house to the ancient palace, which stood on the site of what is now called Old Palace Yard. 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1236"><year reg="1236">1236</year></datestruct>, Henry III. on New Years' Day, caused <num value="6000">six thousand</num> poor men, women, and children, to be entertained in this hall, and in the other rooms of his palace. This was on the occasion of queen Eleanor's coronation. The king and queen had been married at Canterbury; and on the day of this great feast they made their public entry into London. 
<p>Stowe informs us, that <QUOTE><p>the citizens rode to meet the king <pb id="p.160" n="160"> and queen, being clothed in long garments, embroidered about wyth golde and silke of diverse couloures, their horses finely trapped in array to the number of <num value="360">three hundred and sixty</num>, every man bearing golde or silver cups in their hands, and the king's trumpeters before them sounding. The cities was adorned with silk and in the night with lamps, cressets, and other lights without number, besides many pageants and strange devices which were shewn. 
<p>To this coronation resorted so great a number of all estates, that the citie of London was scarce able to receive them. The archbishop of Canterbury did execute the office of coronation: the citizens did minister wine as butlers. The citizens of Winchester tooke charge of the kitchen; and other citizens attended their charges.</QUOTE><NOTE><BIBL>Stowe's Annals, p. <num value="271">271</num>--<num value="2">2</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1241"><year reg="1241">1241</year></datestruct>, (the year before the king having caused the citizens to swear fealty to the young prince Edward, born at Westminster), the same monarch entertained in this hall and the adjoining palace, his principal nobility, and the pope's legate, then in London. On this occasion Henry is described as having dishonoured himself by placing the legate at the head of the table, seating himself on his right hand, and the archbishop of York on his left. This political or superstitious partiality gave great offence to the nobility, both spiritual and temporal. 
<p> <QUOTE>But,</QUOTE>  says Maitland,<NOTE><BIBL>Hist. Lond. ii. <datestruct value="1340--"><year reg="1340">1340</year></datestruct>.</BIBL></NOTE>  <QUOTE>of all the royal entertainments that ever were given in this hall, or perhaps in any other, that (if a certain monk may be credited) given by the same king, at the nuptials of his brother Richard, earl of Cornwall, anno <datestruct value="1243"><year reg="1243">1243</year></datestruct>, was the most sumptuous; for, according to my author, the number of dishes at that feast amounted to above <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num>. If we admit the dishes to have been each but a foot in diameter. the present hall, which is much bigger than that in the time of Henry III. would (exclusive of the company), only contain <num value="15048">fifteen thousand and forty-eight</num> dishes.</QUOTE>  
<p>Without meaning to confirm the monk's statement, it may be remarked, that it does not follow that all those dishes were upon the table at the same time, nor is it necessary to allow so much as <num value="12">twelve</num> inches for each dish; neither is it probable, that all the dishes were placed in the hall, as it was customary to make use of the other rooms belonging to the adjacent palace: there is, therefore, nothing impossible in the monk's statement. 
<p>In <datestruct value="1299--"><year reg="1299">1299</year></datestruct>, <num value="27">27</num> Edward I. a fire destroyed or very much injured this ancient palace, and many houses adjoining, indeed it received so much damage that the parliament in the ensuing year was held at the house of the archbishop York. 
<p>Thomas Walsingham<NOTE><BIBL>Historia Brevis.</BIBL></NOTE> mentions a royal entertainment given in <pb id="p.161" n="161"> 
<p><datestruct value="1317--"><year reg="1317">1317</year></datestruct>, by Edward III. in the hall of this palace, at Whitsuntide, to his court and nobility, when a woman, in a fantastical dress, representing that of a comedian, entered the hall on horseback, where, with an uncommon assurance, after having ridden round the several tables below, ascended the steps to that of the king, and throwing down a letter, she immediately retired. 
<p>This letter Edward commanded to be opened and read; the contents were to the following effect:  <QUOTE>Our lord the king may take notice, that he has not kindly regarded those knights who faithfully served his father and himself with their lives and fortunes; but has too much enriched others, who never performed any thing considerable.</QUOTE>  
<p>The woman being pursued and apprehended, readily acknowledged that she was employed and paid by a certain knight for that service; who being thereupon arrested, boldly declared, that he had done it with no other view than that to the king's honour, which being taken into consideration, together with the contents of the letter, which were incontestible facts, both the knight and the woman were soon discharged from custody. 
<p>Richard II. ordered the whole building to be pulled down, and, in the year <datestruct value="1397"><year reg="1397">1397</year></datestruct> the present edifice was erected. About <num value="2">two</num> years afterwards this monarch kept his Christmas festival in the new hall, accompanied with all that splendour and magnificence for which his court was so conspicuous. It is said on this occasion <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> oxen, <num value="300">three hundred</num> sheep, and fowls without number were consumed. The number of guests on each day of the feast, amounted to <num value="10000">ten thousand</num>; and <num value="2000">two thousand</num> cooks employed.<NOTE><BIBL>Stow apud Maitland. ii. <datestruct value="1341--"><year reg="1341">1341</year></datestruct>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The same author says, the great hall  <QUOTE>was begunne to be repayred in the yeere <datestruct value="1397--"><year reg="1397">1397</year></datestruct> by Richard the <num value="2">Second</num>, who caused the wals, windowes and roofe to be taken downe and newe made, with a stately porch, and divers lodgings of a marvellous worke and with &lsquo;great costs.</QUOTE>  He goes on to state that the charges of the building were obtained by pillaging refugees who had fled their country, and that this dishonest and unfeeling mode of taxation produced  <QUOTE>great summis of monney,</QUOTE>  and also gives the name of the architect John Botterell, he adds  <QUOTE>this hall being finished in the yeere <datestruct value="1399--"><year reg="1399">1399</year></datestruct>, the same king kept a most royal Christmas there</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Survey, p. <num value="887">887</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>. In the course of these repairs, a contract was entered into with Richard Washbourn and John Swalwe, masons, to raise the walls <num value="2">two</num> feet higher than they were with Ryegate stone, and marble to strengthen it, the whole was to be done according to a model made by the advice of master Henry Zencley, and delivered to the said masons by Watkin Walden his warden; and for every foot of assize in length they were to have twelvepence.<NOTE><BIBL>Smith's Westminster, p. <num value="53">53</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The hall received but little attention from government, except <pb id="p.162" n="162"> the substitution of slates for lead on the roof, a profitable job for some favoured contractor, until the reign of his present majesty, when the whole exterior and the interior of the roof underwent a thorough repair, and the principal front was rebuilt with Bath stoneunder the direction of J. Gayfere. 
<p>The plan is parrallelogramatic, having <num value="2">two</num> square towers and a porch at the north end. The principal front consists of a centre, between <num value="2">two</num> wings or towers considerably in advance of it. The former is made in height into <num value="2">two</num> stories, the towers into <num value="3">three</num>, both towers are alike, the <num value="1">first</num> story is a highly decorated basement entirely filled with beautiful niches, with semi-hexagonal canopies, and the wall behind is occupied with cinquefoil headed pannels; in the <num value="2">second</num> story an arched window divided by a mullion and transom into <num value="2">two</num> lights, between <num value="2">two</num> canopied niches, and in the upper story a similar window only, the elevation finishes with a block cornice surmounted by an embattled parapet, at <num value="1">one</num> of the angles of each tower, an octagon staircase turret. The central division consists of a porch with a bold and handsome pointed arch in the centre between niches similar to the towers, the whole surmounted by a gallery fronted by a parapet peirced with quarterfoils, the spandrils of the arch of the porch bear shields, charged with the arms of Edward the Confessor held by angels, below each the white hart, the well-known badge of Richard II; the side walls of the porch have traceried windows in blank; the ceiling is groined and ribbed; the inner entrance is by a small pointed arch filled with oak doors; the upper story of the main elevation is principally occupied by a magnificent window, made by perpendicular mullions into <num value="9">nine</num> divisions, subdivided horizontally by a transom stone; every compartment thus formed has an arched head enclosing <num value="5">five</num> sweeps; the head of the arch is filled with minute compartments, corresponding in form and dimensions with the larger ones; the weather cornice of this window rests on the white hart; the elevation finishes with a well proportioned gable, the cornice enriched with crockets raking up to a triangular niche in the centre, crowned with a pinnacle; the side walls are strengthened by buttresses, composed of a massive insulated pier, situated opposite to the piers between the windows, at about eighteen feet distance, from which flying arches spring and abut against the walls of the hall; but <num value="1">one</num> of these buttresses can be seen, which is in the speaker's court yard; the others are hid and concealed in the new courts, and other adjacent excrescencies, which hide the exterior view of the building, it being much to be lamented that there was not taste enough in the directors of the public works, to have ordered the complete insulation of the hall. The southern end has a similar window to the north, and on the point of the gable is an octagon turret, which ends in a modern cupola. The interiore surprizes every spectator by the grandeur and vastness of the whole; it is covered by the most splendid timber roof ever witnessed; there are in all <num value="13">thirteen</num> ribs, <pb id="p.163" n="163"> each composed of a trussed arch, comprehended within <num value="1">one</num> large and magnificent pointed arch, stretching across the entire building; the trusses are carved with angels holding shields, charged with the arms of king Richard II., and from them spring king posts which bind the <num value="2">two</num> arches together; the spandrils and all intervals are filled with uprights with trefoil heads; between the <num value="9">ninth</num> and <num value="10">tenth</num> beams a beautiful lantern springs from the roof, lately restored in iron; at the sides of the principal entrance are staircases; <num value="1">one</num> is ancient and has a pillar charged with the arms of John Stafford, lord treasurer from <datestruct value="1422--"><year reg="1422">1422</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1424--"><year reg="1424">1424</year></datestruct>,<num value="1">1st</num>. Henry VI. to <datestruct value="1426--"><year reg="1426">1426</year></datestruct>, and afterwards archbishop of Canterbury; and those of Ralph, lord Boteler of Sudley, treasurer of the exchequer, <num value="21">21st</num>. Henry VI. <datestruct value="1443--"><year reg="1443">1443</year></datestruct>. The motto round the top is <foreign lang=fr>Dieu et mon Droit</foreign>. Opposite is a modern pillar charged with the arms of George III. with the date of <datestruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></datestruct>. At the upper end of the hall is a large flight of steps leading to a door communicating with inner apartments; on each side of the window are <num value="3">three</num> niches, in <num value="5">five</num> of which still remain statues of the following monarchs, William Rufus, Henry I. Stephen, Henry II. Richard I. and John, beautifully coloured; the side walls are pierced with windows divided by <num value="1">one</num> mullion, but which are generally stopped up by some adjacent building, and, in consequence, a row of dormer windows have been made in the roof. The repairs of the hall are still in an unfinished state, and the interior is filled up with temporary buildings for records until some permanent structure is found for them.

<p>From the present appearance of some of the buildings, and the known age of others, it should seem, that originally the palace of Westminster formed <num value="2">two</num> sides of a square, and was all comprehended in Old Palace Yard, of which it constituted the east and south sides. Its east side consisted of the Court of Requests, the Painted Chamber, and several other nameless old rooms adjoining them.<FIGURE id="Fig.164.3"><HEAD>Interior of the Painted Chamber</HEAD></FIGURE> Those on the south cannot now be ascertained, as none of them are at present existing, but it is certain that they were remaining in the time of Edward III., that they were parts of the private palace, and joined the old stone tower, now the parliament office<NOTE>See Fig. <num value="2">2</num> in the annexed plate.<FIGURE id="Fig.164.1"><HEAD>Ground Plan of the ancient Palace of Westminster</HEAD></FIGURE></NOTE>; and that in <datestruct value="1754--"><year reg="1754">1754</year></datestruct>, when the houses for the clerks of parliament were erected, a stone wall, of <num value="9">nine</num> feet thick was discovered, undoubtedly part of the old palace. Originally also, and before the erection of Westminster hall, it is supposed that the court of Requests was the great hall of the palace. Of the buildings adjoining Westminster hall on the west, few, if any, were of much antiquity. Some were of the reign of the Edward's, but the major part not earlier than the reign of Henry VII. or thereabouts. Near this side of the hall was <num value="2">two</num> messuages known as the Constabulary and Paradise, and certain subterraneous passages were called Hell and Purgatory. The former, however, in the reign of James I. appears to have been the sign of a low public house, frequented by lawyer's clerks, &amp;c. There was also a house of entertainment called Heaven, noticed by Butler in Hudibras, as

<p><FIGURE id="Fig.164.2"><HEAD>Bell Tower of St. Stephens.</HEAD></FIGURE>
<p>Adjoining the south-east angle of the hall, and at the north end of the old palace, was the chapel to St. Stephen the protomartyr, founded by king Stephen, but rebuilt by Edward III. in <datestruct value="1347--"><year reg="1347">1347</year></datestruct>, in a very magnificent manner; the latter monarch converted it into a collegiate church, and placed therein a dean, <num value="12">twelve</num> secular canons, <num value="12">twelve</num> vicars, <num value="4">four</num> clerks, <num value="6">six</num> choristers, a verger and chapel keeper.<NOTE><BIBL>Dugdale Mon.

<p>The following year, Edward, by letters patent, endowed the same with his <foreign lang=la>Hospitium</foreign>, or great house in Lombard-street, certain lands <pb id="p.165" n="165"> in Yorkshire, and an annuity out of his treasury, to make up the produce of the said house and lands, <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">five hundred</num> pounds</measure> per annum, till he should settle an estate thereon of the like yearly value; and adjoining to the Thames side, not only erected handsome apartments for their reception, but likewise built for their use, in the Little Sanctuary, in Little King-street, a very large and strong bell tower, and placed therein <num value="3">three</num> very great bells, to be rung on solemn occasions, such as coronations, triumphal shews, funerals of princes, and their obits.<NOTE><BIBL>Stowe.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>And for the greater convenience of the dean and canons, (who, upon the erection of the eastern part of the new palace, were removed into houses, in a place called Cannon Row, (Bridge-street) and as an additional embellishment to this stately chapel, John Chamber, M.

<p>Though the kings of England are crowned in the chapel of St. Edward the Confessor, in the abbey of St. Peter's, it has, for many ages, been the practice for them to hold their coronation feasts in Westminster Hall. It has also been used at the trial of peers accused of high treason, or other crimes and misdemeanours, besides the courts of chancery, exchequer, king's bench, and common pleas, which, ever since the reign of Henry the <num value="3">Third</num>, have been held in different apartments of this extensive building. 
<p>At the Conquest, and even for some time after, it does not appear that there was more than <num value="1">one</num> supreme court of judicature in this country: this was the <hi rend=italics>Curia Regis</hi> or King's Court, which was always the place of the royal residence. 
<p>At this court, especially at some solemnities of the year, the king held his great councils, and transacted affairs of national importance, attended by his principal lords and barons. There coronations, &amp;c. were celebrated: there also was constantly placed a stately throne, a sovereign ordinary court of judicature, wherein justice was administered to the subjects: and there <pb id="p.168" n="168"> affairs of the royal revenue were transacted. To the king's court belonged the following officers : . <num value="1">1</num>. &ldquo;The chief justicier, who was next the king in power and authority; and in his absence governed the realm as viceroy. If the king was not present in person in this court, the justicier was chief judge, both in criminal and civil causes. <num value="2">2</num>. The constable, or <foreign lang=la>Constabulerius Regis</foreign>, or <foreign lang=la>Anglia,</foreign>
who was a high officer, both in war and peace. This office was at <num value="1">one</num> time hereditary. <num value="3">3</num>. The <hi rend=italics>Mareschal</hi>, which office was, and indeed still is hereditary. As an officer in the king's court, the 
<hi rend=italics>Mareschal</hi> was to provide for the security of the king's person in his palace, to distribute lodgings there, to preserve peace and order in the king's household, and to assist in determining controversies, &amp;c. within the royal precincts. <num value="4">4</num>. The <hi rend=italics>Seneschal</hi>, or steward, which office was likewise hereditary. <num value="5">5</num>. The chamberlain, or <foreign lang=la>Camerarius Regis.</foreign>
The great officers are distinguished from the inferior ones, of the same name, by the epithet <foreign lang=la>Magistratus, Magisterium</foreign>; as the officer of king's chamberlain is called <foreign lang=la>Magistra Cameraria</foreign>; also 
<foreign lang=la>Magistro Marichalcias</foreign>, &c, <num value="6">6</num>. The chancellor, or <foreign lang=la>Cancellarius Regis</foreign>, so called to distinguish him from the inferior chancellors of the dioceses, &amp;c. Very little is said of this office. It appears, however, that <num value="1">one</num> part of his duty was to supervise the charters to be sealed with the king's seal, and likewise to supervise the acts and precepts that issued in the proceedings depending in <foreign lang=la>Curia Regis.</foreign> He was <num value="1">one</num> of the king's prime counsellors. <num value="7">7</num>. The treasurer, who was for the most part a prelate, or some other ecclesiastical person. 
<p>For some time after the Conquest the justicer used to perform many duties, which afterwards pertained to the treasurer's office. 
<p>The <foreign lang=la>Curia Regis</foreign>, where all the liege-men of the kingdom repaired for justice, was undoubtedly established in England by the Normans, there being no notice whatever of such a court among the Anglo-Saxons. All pleas or causes were then determined below in a plain manner, by the courts in the several counties, towns, or districts. And indeed, at <num value="1">first</num>, there were but few causes reserved to the king's courts after the Conquest, till the Norman lords, who were possessed of the larger seigneuries, carried it with so high a hand towards their vassals and neighbours, that the latter could not have right done them in the ordinary way, and so were constrained to seek for justice in the King's Court. This was likewise done when contentions arose between the great lords themselves. However, few or no causes were brought thither without permission, and the party's making fine to the crown to have this plea in <foreign lang=la>Curia Regis.</foreign> These were sometimes called 
<foreign lang=la>oblata</foreign>, or voluntary fees. 
<p>When the pleas in the King's Court became very numerous, there were certain justices appointed to go <hi rend=italics>Iters</hi>, now called circuits, through the realm, to determine pleas and causes within the <pb id="p.169" n="169"> several counties. These were vested with great authority. It is not known, however, when they were <num value="1">first</num> instituted, but they were new modelled, and their circuits appointed by Henry II. 
<p>A branch of the King's Court was the Exchequer. It was a sort of subaltern court, resembling in its model the <foreign lang=la>Curia Regis</foreign>
itself. For in it sat the great officers abovementioned, and sometimes the king himself. It was called <foreign lang=la>caccarium</foreign>, because a chequered cloth, like a chess-board, was anciently spread on the table in the court; and the great persons that assisted in this court were denominated <foreign lang=la>Barones Saccarii.</foreign> To these were left the care and management of the crown revenue, &amp;c. 
<p>The chief justicier let to farm the king's manors, held pleas at the Exchequer, and made <hi rend=italics>due</hi> allowances to the accomptants. The other great officers had likewise their part in affairs transacted at the Exchequer. 
<p>As to the causes, the Exchequer was at <num value="1">first</num> called a court having jurisdiction in Common Pleas. Matters remained in this state till the division of the King's Court and separation of the Common Pleas from it.<NOTE><BIBL>Madox Hist. Excheq.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The Exchequer being the place into which the revenue is still paid, it will be interesting to shew in what manner it was paid in early times. 
<p>At <num value="1">first</num> the tenants of knight's fees answered to their lords by military service; and the tenants of soccage, lands, and demesnes, in a great measure, by work and provisions. Afterwards the revenue of the crown was answered in gold and silver, and sometimes in palfreys, destriers, chaseurs, leveriers, hawks, &amp;c. (horses, dogs, and game fowl) and the like. Sometimes in both together. 
<p>When a man paid money into the exchequer, it was said, 
<foreign lang=la>In Thesauro liberavit</foreign> so much; the same phrase is still continued. 
<p>These payments were made <foreign lang=la>ad Scalam</foreign> and <foreign lang=la>ad Pensum:</foreign> and blank silver and numero by tale. <foreign lang=la>Ad scalam</foreign> was by paying sixpence over and above each pound and <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure>, which at <num value="1">first</num> was thought sufficient to make good the weight. <foreign lang=la>Ad pensum</foreign>
was the persons making good the deficiencies of weight, though it was more than sixpence per <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure>. 
<p>But as the money might be deficient in fineness as well as weight, a <num value="3">third</num> way of payment was by combustion, or melting down part of the money paid in, and reducing it to plate of due fineness. When the ferm was melted down, it was said to be dealbated, or blanched. As suppose a ferm of a <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> pound</measure> was paid into the Exchequer after the combustion, it was said to be a <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> pound</measure> blank. Frequently, the <num value="20">twentieth</num> part, or <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">one</num> shilling</measure>, was accepted in lieu of combustion, to save trouble and expense. 
<p>The payment by <foreign lang=la>numero</foreign>, ortale, requires no explanation. <pb id="p.170" n="170"> Payments, or at least computations, were made by marks, and half marks; ounces and half ounces of gold; and in pounds, marks, half-marks, shillings, pence, &amp;c. of silver. The ounce of gold was equal to <measure value="15s." type=currency><num value="15">fifteen</num> shillings</measure> of silver; the pound of silver by tale was <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure>; the mark <measure value="13s." type=currency><num value="13">thirteen</num> shillings</measure> and fourpence; and a penny was the <num value="20">twentieth</num> part of an ounce, equal to our threepence. 
<p>The royal revenue in those times was collected and issued in the following manner: the person principally entrusted with the levying of it, was the sheriff of each county, who was an officer of great authority. However, there were several other collectors and accountants: namely, the escheators, the fermers, (or custodes of such towns and boroughs as were not within the sheriff's receipt;) the <foreign lang=la>custodes cambrij</foreign>, or customers, the keepers of the wardrobe, and, in general, all persons who held bailiwicks from the king, or received any of his treasure or revenue, by impress or otherwise, were obliged to render an account thereof; and, in succeeding times, the collectors of tallages, dismes, quinzimes, &amp;c. But in case these officers could not enforce the king's debtors to make payment, the sheriff was armed with sufficient power to do it. 
<p>The most ancient process made use of was the <hi rend=italics>summonce</hi> of the exchequer, which issued twice a year into all the counties of England, and was returnable against the times of holding the <foreign lang=la>duo saccaria</foreign>: namely, the <foreign lang=la>saccarium paschae</foreign>, or exchequer of Easter, and the <foreign lang=la>saccarium St. Michaelis</foreign>, or exchequer of Michaelmas, which were the general terms for the sheriffs and other accountants to pay in their fermes, or rents, and other issues of their bailiwicks. 
<p>This was the ordinary process; but upon urgent occasions, the king issued special writs to the sheriffs, and others concerned in collecting the revenue, commanding them to levy debts, &amp;c. with all speed. 
<p>The manner of issuing the king's money, was by several methods. Whilst the money remained in the hands of the collectors, it was usual for the king, his chief justicier, great officers of his court, treasurers, or barons of the Exchequer to order them, by writ, to make provisions and payments out of the money in their hands. This writ was sometimes called <foreign lang=la>Warrantum:</foreign> the sheriffs warrant; for, upon producing it, he had allowance made to him <foreign lang=la>de tanto</foreign> upon his accompt. Sometimes the king's money was issued by way of 
<hi rend=italics>prest</hi>, or <hi rend=italics>impress</hi>, <foreign lang=la>de praestito</foreign>, either out of the receipt of the exchequer, the wardrobe, or, some other of the king's treasuries. 
<hi rend=italics>Imprest</hi> seems to have been of the nature of a <foreign lang=la>concreditum</foreign>, or 
<foreign lang=la>accommodatum</foreign>, and when a man had money impressed to him, he became accountable to the crown for the same. 
<p>In the <num value="5">fifth</num> year of king Stephen, an account was rendered at the exchequer, of certain monies <hi rend=italics>imprested</hi> to the accomptant, when the empress Maud came into England.<NOTE><BIBL>Mag. Rot. <num value="5">5</num> Stephen.</BIBL></NOTE>
 <pb id="p.171" n="171"> 
<p>According to ancient usage the king's treasurer was to be issued by virtue of a writ or mandate under the great, or privy seal, and directed sometimes to the chief justicier and barons of the exchequer; but most commonly to the treasurers and chamberlain of the receipt. The writ was founded upon a bill or certificate from the exchequer or wardrobe, or other matter of record. But the usual writ for issuing the king's money out of the exchequer was the <foreign lang=la>liberate</foreign> (so called from that word used in it) directed to the treasurer and chamberlain. This writ was of <num value="2">two</num> sorts: a <foreign lang=la>Liberate</foreign> for paying a sum <foreign lang=la>hoc vice</foreign>; and a <foreign lang=la>Liberate</foreign> current, or dormant, for paying in continuance, or more than once. 
<p>From William the Conqueror to the time when king John signed Magna Charta is called the <num value="1">first</num> period in the history of the exchequer; from the end of John's reign to the end of Edward II.&lsquo;s is called the <num value="2">second</num> period; and this history is to be gathered from the revenue rolls and other records in this and some other public offices. The rolls, which are called the great rolls, are kept in the pipe-office; the exchequer records are of the greatest importance; not inferior in interest to the Domesday book itself.<NOTE><BIBL>Rap. i. <num value="386">386</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>From the very <num value="1">first</num> establishment of the exchequer it was customary to make a great roll every year, containing an exact account of every branch of the royal revenue, as it was collected in each county. The great rolls of most of the years of Henry II. Richard I. and John, are still in being. But the most ancient of these records is The Great Roll, of the <num value="5">fifth</num> year of king Stephen. A famous monument of antiquity, says Madox, whether we consider the handwriting, or the contents. This great roll, or bundle, consists of <num value="16">sixteen</num> large rolls, written on both sides, of about <num value="4">four</num> feet long, with another, for they are not of an equal length, and a foot broad. 
<p>Though generally called the Roll of <num value="5">5</num> Stephen, it is no doubt a roll of some year of Henry I., as Madox has clearly proved. 
<p>These records, and all others of the court holden before the king, of those of the common bench, and of the justices in Eyre, still remain under the custody of the treasurer and chamberlains of the exchequer. 
<p>In process of time the kings's justicier ceased to preside in this court, by which the power of the treasurer was considerably increased. The-affairs was then managed by the treasurer and the barons of the exchequer, to whom may be added the king's council, whom we often find acting both in the superior court and in the exchequer; and that persons were sometimes summoned to appear before the council there, on set days. 
<p>Henry III. by his charter, granted his treasury of his exchequer of England and Wales, to Walter Maurice, bishop of Carlisle, to hold during life. 
<p>Some persons have been inclined to think that the office of the king's treasurer (or, as we now call it, treasurer of England), and <pb id="p.172" n="172"> that of the treasurer of the exchequer, were <num value="2">two</num> distinct offices; but, in numerous instances, the treasurer, during the reigns of Henry III. Edward I. and II. are stiled, sometimes, The King's Treasurer, and sometimes Treasurer of the Exchequer. It does not appear what appointment the treasurer, in the most ancient times, received of the king. 
<p>In the reign of Henry III. the salary was <measure value="100bmark" type=currency><num value="100">one hundred</num> marks</measure>; the same salary was paid to John bishop of Ely, treasurer <num value="25">25</num> Edward I. But at that time the king used to make other provision for his treasurers, by some beneficial grant, or ecclesiastical preferment; and so likewise for the chancellors, and other officers, who were ecclesiastical persons. 
<p>Sometimes there was at the exchequer an officer, called the treasurer's lieutenant, who acted in the treasurer's absence, or, if no treasurer executed the treasurer's offices and was in effect the treasurer's deputy. There were lieutenants to several other officers; as to the king's chancellor, &amp;c. &amp;c. 
<p>After the treasurer came the chancellor, who seems to have been appointed as a check upon the treasurer. He took an oath upon entering into office to this effect: that he would well and truly serve the king, in his office of chancellor of the exchequer: that he would well and truly do what appertained to his office: that he would dispatch the king's business before all other: and that he would--seal with the exchequer seal no judicial writ of any other court, besides the exchequer; whilst the chancery (or chancellor,) was within <num value="20">twenty</num> miles of the place where the exchequer was holden.<NOTE><BIBL>Lib. Rub. Scac. p. <num value="04">04</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The rest of the persons that sat in the exchequer were the barons, who were appointed by the king in the following manner: 
<QUOTE lang=la>Rex omnibus, ad quos, &amp;c. Sciatis nos concessisse dilecte et fideli nostro Magistro Alexandro de Levereford Thesausario Sancti Pauli Londoniee, Quadriginta Marcas singulis annis percipiendas ad saccarium nostrum ad se sustentandum in servito nostro ad saccarium ubi residet per perceptum nostrum, donec ei aliter providerimus.

<p>The business of the Exchequer in those early periods shall be treated of as briefly as possible. This relates, <num value="1">first</num>, to the affairs of the revenue, of which, generally, we have already treated; and there was little difference in the management of those matters to the end of the reign of Edward II. from which time they have ducted on similar principles. 
<p>Secondly, to pleas and causes. After the separation of the Common Pleas from the king's court and palace, it was forbidden by the great charter, and, subsequently, by an ordinance, to hold Common Pleas in the Exchequer; yet, in fact, some Common Pleas were still holden; and the king sometimes gave leave to <pb id="p.173" n="173"> particular persons, to bring their suits and recover their debts there. In suits moved between parties in the Exchequer, the king granted preference to <num value="1">one</num> person: namely, that he should be paid before other creditors. 
<p>Thirdly, this business may be said to be of various kinds, such as conventions and recognitions, which were frequently made in the exchequer, and the presentation and admission of officers of the exchequer. Several officers of the exchange and coiners of money, were, from time to time, presented and sworn in the exchequer, as well as some others, as customers and commissioners of perambulation of forests. The mayors and chief officers of towns, escheators, &amp;c. were presented at the exchequer. 
<p>The citizens of London, after they had chosen a mayor presented him before the treasurer and barons, who swore and admitted him to his office; as also their sheriffs. 
<p>If the sheriff of London did not come to the Exchequer at the king's command, to take upon him his office, he was to be amerced. Sometimes sheriffs of counties were in like manner sworn in person at the Exchequer. Several of the king's tenants, <foreign lang=la>in capite</foreign>, by rent service, paid their rent at the Exchequer.--Waller le Brun, a farrier in the Strand, was to have a piece of ground in the parish of St. Clement, to place a forge there, he rendering <num value="6">six</num> horse shoes with the nails belonging thereto annually.<NOTE><BIBL>Vide Mag. Rot. <num value="19">19</num> Hen.

<p>Of the records, or rolls of the Exchequer sufficient has already been said. 
<p>To enter upon a detail of the accounts of the Exchequer would lead us much beyond our limits; we may state, however, generally, that when the Chancery was separated from the Exchequer, and the charter rolls, writs, and precepts of the great seal came to be entered by themselves in the <foreign lang=la>Rotuli Cancellariae</foreign>, commenced the present method of sending estreats from the Chancery to the Exchequer. 
<p>Besides trials relating to the revenues of the crown, in this court are now not unfrequently tried matters of equity between subject and subject. The judges are, the lord chief baron of the Exchequer, and <num value="3">three</num> other judges, called barons of the Exchequer; also <num value="1">one</num> cursitor baron. 
<p>The King's Rembrancer's Offfce is attached to this court; and there are the remembrancer, his deputy, and <num value="2">two</num> secondaries; <num value="6">six</num> sworn clerks; the lord treasurer's remembrancer, his deputy, <num value="2">two</num> secondaries, the <num value="2">second</num> being also filaser; <num value="4">four</num> sworn clerks, and <pb id="p.174" n="174"> bag bearer; <num value="1">one</num> clerk of the errors in the Exchequer chamber, and his deputy; an hereditary chief usher, a deputy, <num value="4">four</num> ushers of the court, and a court-keeper; <num value="4">four</num> messengers for England, and <num value="2">two</num> for Wales. There are also a marshal of the court of Exchequer, and his deputy; a foreign apposer and his deputy; a clerk of the estreats and his deputy; a surveyor of the green wax, a clerk of the nichils; a serjeant at arms, and a tipstaff. 
<p>The Pipe-office, belonging to the Exchequer-office, is at Somerset-house; as is also the Comptroller's-office. 
<p>The Exchequer-office of Pleas is in Lincoln's Inn, Old Buildings, of which the reader will find an account in a subsequent part of the present volume. 
<p>In the court of the Exchequer, though the cursitor baron takes the oaths of some great officers, and of the sheriffs of London, he does not sit on the bench. 
<p>If any case should appear so difficult that the judges are divided in their opinion, the vote of the chancellor finally determines the suit. 
<p>Besides the court of Exchequer, there are holden in this hall, the court of Common Pleas, which was established by Magna Charta in the year <datestruct value="1216"><year reg="1216">1216</year></datestruct>; before which time the court was ambulatory and followed the king. 
<p>Its early history is much involved in that of the Exchequer, of which an ample account has just been given. 
<p>It was called the Common Pleas, because here all civil actions, whether real, mixed, or personal, are tried, and all fines and recoveries sued out. It has a chief justice and <num value="3">three</num> other judges, but no person can plead in it unless he has been called up to the degree of a serjeant at law. 
<p>The Court of Chancery is so called from the Latin word <foreign lang=la>Cancelli,</foreign>
or screen, within which the judges formerly sat to determine causes without being annoyed by the spectators, who came to be witnesses of their proceedings. 
<p>The supreme judge of this court is the lord high chancellor of England, who, next to the king, is the <num value="1">first</num> magistrate in all civil affairs whatever. He is also usually speaker of the House of Lords, and commonly appointed high steward on the trial of peers. 
<p>The Chancery consists of <num value="2">two</num> courts, in <num value="1">one</num> of which the Chancellor proceeds according to the law of the land; but the principal is the Court of Equity, designed to moderate the rigour of the common law, and grant redress of grievances, where the statute law has not made any provision. 
<p>The business of the court is very extensive; all writs for the election of members of parliament are issued from it; patents for sheriffs, and all other officers, made out; writs of <foreign lang=la>certiorari</foreign>
against false judgment, letters patent, treaties with foreign princes, and commissions both of appeal, and oyer and terminer, granted. <pb id="p.175" n="175"> 
<p>Here no juries are summoned, for the actions are all by bill, and the depositions of the witnesses are taken at the Examiner's office, and afterwards read in court as sufficient evidence; so that the determination of the sentence is solely invested in the judge. 
<p>The officers belonging to the high Court of Chancery are very numerous, and are in different parts of the metropolis, the following are their names: the Crown-office, having about <num value="5">five</num> officers and clerks: the <num value="6">Six</num> Clerks office, in Chancery-lane, of which hereafter; the Report-office, the Register-office, the Hanaper-office, the Alienation-office, the Record-office, the Dispensation-office, and the Examiner's-office. The clerks of the petty bag, and the commissioners of bankrupts, and the corporation, all belong to this court, as also the master of the rolls, and an immense number of other officers, clerks, keepers, messengers, &amp;c. 
<p>The Court of King's Bench, is so called from a high bench on which our ancient monarch usually sat in person; the judges, to whom, in their absence, was deputed the judicature, sat on benches at their feet. 
<p>The account already given of <foreign lang=la>Curia Regis</foreign>, is sufficient to convey an idea of the early history of the court. 
<p>Here are determined pleas between the crown and the subject, of treasons, felonies, and other pleas, which properly belong to the king; and also in whatever relates to the loss of life or member of any subject in which the king is concerned. Here likewise are tried breaches of the peace, oppression, and mis-government; and this court corrects the errors of all the judges and justices of England, in their judgments and proceedings, not only pleas, real, personal, and mixed; except only pleas in the exchequer. This court is general, and extends to all England; and where ever it is held, the law supposes the king to be present. Here generally sit <num value="4">four</num> judges, the <num value="1">first</num> of whom is stiled the lord chief justice of the court of king's bench, (at present, <datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>. The right hon. Charles, lord Tenterden,) who is sometimes called the lord chief justice of England, being in fact the same as was originally called the king's chief justicier, before spoken of. 
<p>The manner in which the judges are now created is as follows; the lord chancellor having taken his seat in the court where the vacancy is to be filled, bringing with him the king's letters patent, causes the serjeant elect to be brought in, to whom, in open court, he notifies the king's pleasure, causing the letters to be publicly read: which done, the master of the rolls reads to him the oath he is to take, stating,  <QUOTE>that he shall indifferently administer justice to all men, as well foes as friends, that shall have any suit or plea be fore him and this he shall not forbear to do, though the king, by his letters, or by express word of mouth, should command the contrary; and that, from time to time, he shall not receive any fee or pension, or livery of any man, but of the king only; nor any gift, <pb id="p.176" n="176"> reward, or bribe of any man having suit or plea before him, saving meat and drink, which shall be of no great value.</QUOTE>  
<p>On this oath being administered, the lord chancellor delivers to him the king's letters; and the lord chief justice of the court assigns him a place in the same, where he then places him, and he is enjoined afterwards to keep this place. 
<p>The justice thus created is not to be at the charge of any dinner, solemnity, or other costs, because there is no degree in the faculty of the law, but an office only, and a room of authority to continue during the king's pleasure. 
<p>Prior to the reign of Mary I. the judges rode upon mules to court: but sir John Whiddon, a justice of the court of king's bench, disliking the uneasy gait of those obstinate animals, introduced a more eligible mode of conveyance. 
<p>The various courts of law are built on the west side of the great hall. The designs are by John Soane, esq.; they were commenced in <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>, and continued until <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>; the exterior of this extensive pile was at <num value="1">first</num> a copy of Palladio's Basilica at Vicenza, but after the latter year, at the suggestion of a committee of taste appointed by the House of Commons, the facade was altered in the modern Gothic style. 
<p>The design of the courts are nearly similar, and greatly resemble the offices in the Bank by the same architect. The Court of King's Bench is the <num value="1">first</num> from the principal front of the hall, and is the most richly-decorated; it is <num value="35">35</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches long, <num value="30">30</num> feet wide, and <num value="26">26</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches high; adjoining is the Bail Court <num value="30">30</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches long, <num value="28">28</num> feet wide, and <num value="23">23</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches high. The next is the Court of Exchequer; it is <num value="52">52</num> feet long by <num value="31">31</num> feet <num value="7">7</num> inches wide and <num value="26">26</num> feet high. The Court of Equity is <num value="31">31</num> feet long by <num value="23">23</num> feet <num value="7">7</num> inches wide and <num value="24">24</num> feet high. The Court of Common Pleas succeeds; it is a neat court, <num value="41">41</num> feet by <num value="33">33</num> and <num value="24">24</num> feet high. The next in rotation is the Vice Chancellor's Court; it is <num value="36">36</num> feet by <num value="25">25</num> feet and <num value="29">29</num> feet high. The last court is the Lord Chancellor's; it is a neat but plain structure; the dimensions are <num value="36">36</num> feet by <num value="25">25</num> and <num value="29">29</num> feet high. Attached to all the courts are robing and retiring rooms and a library; they are respectively approached by pointed arches in the wall of the great hall, which leads into a narrow corridor, which answers in breadth to the space between the buttresses and the wall of the great hall. 
<p>The courts of law are generally devoid of accommodation for the public, and the judges and counsel have repeatedly complained of the currents of air and ill arrangements connected with them. In consequence of this failure and the more extensive <num value="1">one</num> of the front of the New Palace, St. James' park, a select committee was appointed by the House of Commons to enquire and report on the office of works and public buildings. This report embraces so much information connected with the city of Westminster, that it has been thought expedient to reprint it here as a record of <pb id="p.177" n="177"> the  <QUOTE>taste,</QUOTE>  and  <QUOTE>ability</QUOTE>  of the members composing the board of works. 
<div2 type=section id="c.3.6"><HEAD>Report from the Select Committee on the Office of Works and Public Buildings.</HEAD>
 
<p>The select committee appointed to inquire into the state of the public buildings in the department of the office of works, under statute <num value="64">64</num> Geo. III. c. <num value="157">157</num>; and into the application of part of the land revenue of the crown, under statute <num value="6">6</num> George IV. c. <num value="77">77</num>, and under <num value="7">7</num> and <num value="8">8</num> George IV. c. <num value="68">68</num>, for the management and improvement of the land revenues of the crown in Ireland; and into the works now in progress, under <num value="7">7</num> Geo. IV. c. <num value="77">77</num>, for improving Charing-cross, and for granting leases of the site of Carlton palace; and to report the same, with their observations, to the House, began their inquiry into the mode of conducting the business of the office of works, by examining the surveyor-general; who informed your committee, that soon after the passing of the act <num value="54">54</num> Geo. III. c. <num value="147">147</num>, a code of instructions was drawn out by the commissioners of the treasury, dated March <num value="101815">10,1815</num>, and that no alteration of any consequence has been made since. 
<p>The regulations under which public works and buildings were previously carried on form the subject of an elaborate report from the commissioners of inquiry into the conduct and business of that department, printed <num value="3">3</num>d <datestruct VALUE="1813-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>. It was enacted in <datestruct value="1782--"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct>, by <num value="22">22nd</num> George III. c. <num value="82">82</num>, which suppressed the then existing board of works, together with several other offices, that all his majesty's buildings hitherto under the management of that board should be under the direction of an architect or builder by profession, as surveyor or comptroller of the works; which office was held for many years by sir William Chambers, and after his death by Mr. Wyatt, but the want of punctuality and exactness of the latter in keeping his accounts, and the extreme disorder into which they had fallen, gave occasion, in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, to new regulations, by the introduction of the system under which that office is now conducted. The intention of the framers of that act appears to have been to establish an efficient control and superintendence in the surveyor-general, attaching to his office a council of <num value="3">three</num> of the most eminent architects, to assist and advise him by their united talent, in all such matters, either of design or execution, as might require the knowledge and skill of persons professionally educated. A salary of <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">500</num>l.</measure> was assigned to each of them, and their commission upon new buildings conducted under their direction was settled at <measure value="3l." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>l.</measure> per cent. instead of <measure value="5l." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>l.</measure>, which is the usual charge of architects; but they were relieved from the expense of clerks of the works, and of making out the accounts and bills of the workmen, which occur when they are employed in the usual course of their business. Upon reference to the evidence it will be seen, that for conducting the works both at Buckingham palace and Windsor castle, the commission to be <pb id="p.178" n="178"> received is the full commission of <measure value="5l." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>l.</measure> per cent., although the business of measuring and settling the accounts is conducted and paid by the office; the grounds of which allowance are stated in the correspondence, and the treasury minutes contained in the appendix. Mr. Nash's salary of <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">500</num>l.</measure> is not paid during the progress of the works at the palace. The <num value="3">three</num> attached architects are certainly not excluded by the <num value="6">6th</num> section of the act from undertaking and conducting public works, but it does not seem to have been designed or contemplated that they should be exclusively employed; nor that separate and distinct divisions of the metropolis should be allotted to them, as in severalty, so that <num value="1">one</num> only of this council (if it may be so denominated) should be referred to, or consulted, within the limits of his peculiar province, without any professional competition or concurrence. Objections might undoubtedly be raised against referring the designs and plans of <num value="1">one</num> of these <num value="3">three</num> architects to the other <num value="2">two</num>, for their examination and criticism, on account of that difficulty and delicacy which very properly exist among men of high reputation in the same profession, and belonging to the same department, who would naturally be unwilling to give opinions or suggest corrections upon the works of their colleagues; but the effect of this system has been, and must continue to be, the narrowing and limiting the choice of those who are to determine upon the general taste and character of public buildings, whose judgment ought to be assisted by some variety and diversity of design, and some increase in the power of selection. The faculty of originating and inventing what is excellent in architecture, as in every thing else is undoubtedly confined to few; but many of those who are at all conversant in works of art, particularly if they had opportunities of observing the best examples of ancient and modern architecture, are capable of forming a correct judgment upon designs or models which are placed before them, and will seldom fail to prefer the best to the worst. The inconvenience of this want of choice, supposing no more essential change to be made in the constitution of the office, may certainly be obviated by directing each of the attached architects to give a general notion or representation, or a slight sketch, of the style and character in which he would propose any public building to be treated, which is either to be newly erected, or considerably enlarged or altered; and slight sketches might also be called for from other architects of experience or reputation, so as to afford some opportunity of competition, without incurring the inconvenience attending unlimited tenders. 
<p>In all cases where any considerable work is to be undertaken, as soon as any <num value="1">one</num> general plan shall have been preferred and selected, it is indispensable that a model should be constructed, showing both the elevation, and the internal accommodation and distribution of the whole; and that this model should be reconsidered and settled (with alterations, if necessary) before the work is begun. A correct estimate should then be formed, and the commission of the <pb id="p.179" n="179"> architect should not in any case be allowed upon the amount of the expenditure beyond the original estimate; for no mode of payment can he more absurd or contrary to economy, than that of a per centage upon the ultimate charge, which makes it the interest of those who conduct extensive works to render them as expensive as they can, and affords them a premium upon their own unconstrained inaccuracy and extravagance. 
<p>A considerable difference in opinion exists with regard to the check and control over expense which the present system affords; and those parts of the conflicting evidence of Mr. Nash and Mr. Smirke, which relates to this specific point, exhibit the defects and the advantages belonging to it. But it must be confessed, that the responsibility of the architect is extremely diminished, when the examination of the several charges is taken out of his hands, as well as the measuring of the work, which is stated universally to be a source of great uncertainty and cavilling, and not unfrequently of imposition and overcharge. Mr. Nash distinctly says, that nothing is so unreasonable as to think that an architect can be answerable in any way for his estimate when he himself does not control the prices and make out the bills; and he avows his inability of judging how nearly the expense of the palace has come to his estimate, because he has nothing to do with the measuring or making out the accounts. A mode of proceeding which affords so plausible an excuse or justification for excess and deviation (unless some great counterpoise can be alleged in favour of its utility in some other point of view), is hardly to be maintained or continued with advantage to the public. 
<p>For the purpose of investigating this question and endeavouring to determine as to the present method of conducting public works, your committee entered into further enquiries, and examined several persons of respectability and high character, as architects and builders, not connected with the office of works; among whom they found the same diversity of opinion as between the <num value="2">two</num> architects already referred to. 
<p>The preponderance of opinion, however, among those most capable of forming a correct judgment, who have been examined upon this question, is certainly in favour of the present practice of contracts for prices, as contrasted with contracts in gross. 
<p>Mr. Wyatville, Mr. Harrison, and Mr. Burton, give it a decided preference; but the contracts in gross are considered by Mr. Rowles and Mr. Cubitt as more advantageous to the employer, and not necessarily liable to the objections which are alleged against them. In the evidence of Mr. Rowles are also some detailed observations upon the code of instructions of <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>, well deserving of attention, and suggesting some improvements in that system. 
<p>The certainty of a work being performed within the sum allotted to it, is unquestionably a powerful recommendation to contracts in gross; but if, as t is alleged, such works are more liable to be 
<hi rend=italics>N</hi> <num value="2">2</num> <pb id="p.180" n="180"> slighted in the execution, and frauds are more frequently practised in carrying on and conducting the several parts; and if such frauds and evasions of the specifications are less capable of being detected than when the works are undertaken under contracts for prices (which is the regulation in the office for works), the latter mode would certainly be preferable, even at an increased charge. But with the superintendance of clerks of the works and other men bred to the profession, belonging to and dependent upon the office, and with such accuracy in the specifications as the ability and experience of the attached architect cannot fail to ensure, your committee consider that the method which appears the most prudent and economical for individuals to adopt, could not prove disadvantageous to the public; and they are therefore inclined to think that with precise specification and careful superintendence, and where all deviations from the original plan are avoided, the system of contracts in gross might be found to be the least expensive. 
<p>Within the last <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num> years a larger field has been opened for architectural talent and exertion than at almost any other period of our modern annals; a greater number of bridges and churches, and of both public and private works upon an extended scale, have been completed, than in an <num value="100">hundred</num> years before. The appearance and convenience of the parts of this metropolis to the north of Pall-mall and Piccadilly, have been much improved by the grand line of Regent-street, and the buildings leading to and connected with it; of which the general design and many of the details are excellent; but on the other hand it may be observed, with regret, that the taste and style of some of the public edifices do not indicate such a stale of improvement as might have been desired and expected from the increased opportunities which have been thus afforded. 
<p>It would be an invidious and unpleasant task to criticise the labours of living architects, who have deservedly risen to a distinguished station in their profession; and it is only with regard to such parts of their productions as they profess themselves dissatisfied with and condemn, that your committee venture to express their full concurrence hi those unfavourable opinions; but in some of these it must be observed, that much of the defect is to be attributed to changes and alterations in their plans, even during the execution of the buildings, and to a want of due consideration and determination upon the entire edifice, before any portion was begun. 
<p>The inconvenient line of the new council office, both in Downing-street and Whitehall, discordant from the lines of those streets, and encroaching most awkwardly and incommodiously upon the foot pavement of the latter (if it should be continued), could hardly have been resolved upon, if all the consequences attendant upon that design, in relation to the line of street and the height of the adjoining and neighbouring buildings, had been laid before the lords of the treasury at <num value="1">one</num> view, and the objections pointed out to them. The <pb id="p.181" n="181"> addition of the pavilion, towards Downing-street, was entirely an after thought; and it now seems to require a corresponding and ornamented projection, which it it be placed before the office of the secretary of state for the home department, and kept in the same alignment, will essentially disfigure the fine street of Whitehall; or if turned upon an obtuse angle towards Melbourne House, will excite in every observing passenger, a sentiment of regret that this inconvenience was not foreseen in the beginning, and obviated. It will be noticed in the evidence of Mr. Soane, that a <num value="2">second</num> pavilion, towards the home office, was never in his contemplation; but he produced to your committee a design for erecting a corresponding pavilion on the other side of Downing-street, at the angle of King-street, with a building extending into King-street, similar to that in Whitehall. 
<p>The council office should have been much higher, if taste only were considered, as Mr. Soane acknowledges in his evidence, and his <num value="1">first</num> design for a much less decorated building was made accordingly; but a desire of restricting the expense, which must have been incurred by making the rooms unnecessarily high, was <num value="1">one</num> of his reasons, as he alleges, for not carrying the building to a more dignified elevation. A balustrade connecting the line of chimneys was, during a short time, placed upon the roof of this dwarfish front; but the architect states that he had nothing to do either with the putting it on or taking it of. Such is the unsatisfactory state in which this large and costly structure stands, from being begun without a plan which had been maturely considered, from injudicious alterations and changes which have been made during its progress, and contrary, as it appears by his own statement, to the opinion of the architect; but under whatever direction this work may have proceeded there can be only <num value="1">one</num> opinion of the work itself; and although your committee cannot clearly ascertain to whom the blame attaches, the system cannot be good which has produced such a result. It therefore now remains a question, how it can either be left as it is, or how it can be completed on the end towards the north: for as to the project of balancing it by a symmetrical and similar range of pavilion and building on the other side of Downing-street in King-street, with a decorated arch connecting those <num value="2">two</num> streets, such an addition will probably never be required for public utility, nor does it seem desirable that it should be ever carried into effect. 
<p>The name of lord viscount Goderich having been frequently mentioned in Mr. Soane's evidence relating to the new council office, your committee requested his lordship to inform them as to his recollection of the circumstances connected with that building, which is given at length in his evidence. In this place it may be sufficient to observe, that with the exception of the line so inadvertently taken, the other defects could not have occurred, if the suggestion made by lord Goderich in <num value="1">one</num> of his conferences with <pb id="p.182" n="182"> 
<p>Mr. Soane had been adopted, which was, to refer to the general design of Inigo Jones for the palace of Whitehall, and to select such a division or portion from it as might be adapted, in the interior distribution, to the purposes of the trade and council offices, and might adorn the street, by a front not discordant from the style and character of the only portion of that grand building which now remains and decorates the opposite side. 
<p>Another larger and much more expensive building, which is in progress for his majesty's palace in St. James's-park, is now undergoing very considerable alterations, not originally contemplated, for the purpose of rectifying a defect, which scarcely could have occurred if a model of the entire edifice had previously been made and duly examined. Mr. Nash says, in answer to a question relating to the <num value="2">two</num> detached <num value="3">three</num>-windowed houses at the extreme angles of the wings,  <QUOTE>I was not at <num value="1">first</num> aware that the effect would have been so bad; and I am sorry to say that I was disappointed myself in the effect of them.</QUOTE>  The consequence of this alteration, thus occasioned, will increase the interior accommodation by adding <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> new apartments to the present numbers, but it is estimated at no less a sum than <measure value="50000l." type=currency><num value="50000">50,000</num>l.</measure> With regard to the dome above the roof of the palace, Mr. Nash deems it unfortunate that it is visible from the park side, which was not intended by him, nor was he aware that it would have been seen, except as belonging exclusively to the garden front. 
<p>It was proposed when this great work was <num value="1">first</num> undertaken in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, under the title of repairing and improving Buckingham-house (<num value="6">6</num> Geo.

Your committee conceive that it does not come within their province to do more than to notice this transaction, as having enabled the office of woods and forests to meet the heavy charge by other resources than those which were by law appropriated to it This supply amounted to <measure value="250000l." type=currency><num value="250000">250,000</num>l.</measure> What has hitherto been actually paid from the land revenue is <measure value="27760l." type=currency><num value="27760">27,760</num>l.</measure> in addition to that sum; and there is a probability that the surplus of that revenue will in this year be capable of affording about <measure value="60000l." type=currency><num value="60000">60,000</num>l.</measure> and in <datestruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></datestruct> about <measure value="100000l." type=currency><num value="100000">100,000</num>l.</measure> The land revenue varies from year to year, in consequence of fines upon renewals; but the whole, including that of the woods and forests, may be taken at about <measure value="200000l." type=currency><num value="200000">200,000</num>l.</measure> a year. <pb id="p.183" n="183"> 
<p>The estimated charge for completing the palace is <measure value="432926l." type=currency><num value="432926">432,926</num>l.</measure> including the above sum of <measure value="277767l." type=currency><num value="277767">277,767</num>l.</measure> which has been already paid. 
<p>Upon the site of Carlton House, the several houses which are erecting for individuals must be conformable to a general design for the exterior, but the proprietors are at liberty to select their own architects or builders; and the annual rents which will accrue to the crown from these new houses are calculated at <measure value="6452l." type=currency><num value="6452">6,452</num>l.</measure>, the particulars of which will be found exactly detailed in the evidence of Mr. Arbuthnot. 
<p>It was imagined by Mr. Nash, that a large sum would at once be raised by a sale of the greater part of these annual ground-rents to the proprietors of the houses at <num value="20">20</num> years' purchase (the freehold being still retained by the crown,) but that expectation having not hitherto been realized, no present pecuniary advantage of that sort having accrued to the crown in aid of this undertaking, but on the contrary, a considerable and immediate charge having been incurred in forming the ground, making a large sewer, purchasing the land-tax, and other incidental outgoings, before any part of the annual rents has been received. 
<p>It is, however, stated in Mr. Arbuthnot's evidence, that although the proprietors themselves may not choose to buy up their rents, it would be in the power of the government to sell to any other individuals such a proportion of them as might be thought fit to dispose of. By the act <num value="7">7</num> Geo. IV., c. <num value="77">77</num>, the crown is authorised to take fines from the lessees for any portion of their rent, which is a deviation from the usual practice with regard to other new buildings; nor is it the practice to alienate new buildings in fee, to which rule it appears expedient to adhere. 
<p>The expenditure upon the alterations in St. James's park, which are in some measure connected with these new houses, amounts to <measure value="16053l." type=currency><num value="16053">16,053</num>l.</measure>, including the iron railing: but exclusive of the planting within the railing. 
<p>It is proposed to erect a fountain, estimated to cost <measure value="8000l." type=currency><num value="8000">8,000</num>l.</measure>, with the addition of a large annual charge for a constant supply of water, in the centre of the continuation of Waterloo-place, towards the Mall, as will be seen in the evidence of Mr. Nash; which being the <num value="1">first</num> instance of a fountain surrounded by columns, with a dome or covering over it, gave occasion to some questions from your committee, which appear in the evidence of Mr. Nash, together with his answers; and they cannot but here observe, that this fountain, if it is to be encircled by a peristyle, and covered by a cap or dome, is not likely in itself to be an ornamental object, and that it would obstruct the opening, and the view of the park from Regent-street and Waterloo place. 
<p>A spacious and handsome flight of steps in the centre of that terrace, leading into the Mall, would form an ornamental and commodious communication between Regent-street and the Park, and would afford to the public a very general accommodation, and an <pb id="p.184" n="184"> appropriate termination of that fine opening. Your committee are informed that the central division of St. James's Park, newly inclosed by iron rails, is intended to be open to the public in the same way with the other parts of that park. 
<p>Your committee find, upon inquiry, that no sanction has hitherto been given by the commissioners of the treasury to the extension of the plan engraved in the Journals of <datestruct VALUE="1827-06-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, towards Marlborough-house and St. James's palace; and they cannot consider such an extension, nor any further encroachment upon the Park, as fit to be recommended. 
<p>The fraudulent and scandalous manner in which the foundation of the new Custom-house was laid, occasioned, by its total failure in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, a charge of no less than <measure value="170000l." type=currency><num value="170000">170,000</num>l.</measure>, or <measure value="180000l." type=currency><num value="180000">180,000</num>l.</measure>, in addition to the original expenditure of <measure value="255000l." type=currency><num value="255000">255,000</num>l.</measure>; but no part of this blame affects the office of works, nor the architects attached to it. This great structure was unfortunately placed under the conduct of Mr. Laing, the person who happened, in the year <datestruct value="1813"><year reg="1813">1813</year></datestruct>, to be surveyor of buildings in that department,--a course which your committee conceive to be exceedingly objectionable, being of opinion that all works of this description should be carried on under the direction and management of the office specially appointed for the execution of such works: and they would animadvert more strongly on this point if they were not informed that the treasury have already put a stop to the practice, and have now under their consideration some new regulations upon the subject. II is also to be observed, that no estimate was laid before the House, nor any sanction given by a vote, either before the undertaking or during the progress, the expense having been defrayed out of the revenue of the customs. This mode of proceeding, although in conformity with the practice which has hitherto existed with respect to buildings occupied by the revenue departments, appears to be at variance with the general principles by which the public expenditure is governed, and to be open to much objection. They recommend, therefore, that in future no new buildings for any of these departments should be undertaken except under the authority of a grant of parliament, upon an estimate to be laid before the House for that purpose, as in the case of any other object of miscellaneous expenditure. 
<p>No department should be allowed to order any thing beyond mere incidental repairs, without referring to and receiving directions from the office of works. The enormous expense of the new Mint, and its excess beyond the estimate, which was noticed in <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct> by the committee on public income and expenditure, in their <num value="7">seventh</num> report; and the more recent example of the custom-house, render this regulation and the strictest adherence to it indispensable. 
<p>The New Mews, fronting the north side of Westminster Abbey, has been erected at the expense of <measure value="35264l." type=currency><num value="35264">35,264</num>l.</measure> and the annual rents payable to the use of the public, as part of the land revenue, will amount only to about <num value="31">31</num>. per cent, upon that sum. The reasons for <pb id="p.185" n="185"> making the exterior more ornamental and costly than the uses to which it is allotted require, are assigned in the evidence of Mr. Arbuthnot and Mr. Burton. 
<p>The Regent's Park presents a much better and more productive instance of management under the same department; and it must afford to the House great satisfaction to know that the laying out and planting of that extensive ground, together with the buildings upon it, which do so much credit to the taste and judgment of Mr. Nash, will also soon become a very profitable addition to the land revenue, the annual rent being <measure value="15000l." type=currency><num value="15000">15,000</num>l.</measure> and the remaining excess of expenditure beyond receipt being reduced to <measure value="70000l." type=currency><num value="70000">70,000</num>l.</measure> 
<p>The improvements at and near Charing-Cross and the Strand, under the statute <num value="7">7</num> Geo. IV. c. <num value="77">77</num>, are in progress, and by much the greatest portion of the property required for the purposes of that act has been obtained. A considerable number of the old houses near St. Martin's church have already been taken down, and new buildings will almost immediately be commenced in that neighbourhood; but some further purchases remain to be effected. 
<p>The defects of the present system, under the act of <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, appear to be,--<num value="1">1st</num>. Want of responsibility. <measure value="2d." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>d.</measure> Want of competency to decide. <measure value="3d." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>d.</measure> Want of choice and competition; from which <num value="3">three</num> causes proceed the erection of buildings unsightly and unsatisfactory, much confusion and variation both in the planning and executing of them, and the expenditure of larger sums than are necessary. 
<p><num value="1">1st</num>. The surveyor-general, according to the present constitution of that office, is solely the channel of communication between the commissioners' of his majesty's treasury and the architect; he exercises no judgment nor control, nor gives any opinion as to the work to be done, or the mode of doing it; confining himself to fixing prices, and making contracts accordingly, and examining and checking the accounts after they have been made out by the clerks of the works, and the measurers belonging to the office. 
<p><measure value="2d." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>d.</measure> The surveyor-general having no duty to perform in judging of the propriety or sufficiency of the design or plan, that important business is imposed upon the commissioners of the treasury for the time being, who may not always be competent to decide upon such matters; and although it may happen frequently that there are among them persons eminently conversant with works of art, it may also happen that a very efficient board of treasury for all other and more important purposes may be unfit for this; and in such a case the architect of the district, without any real control or useful supervision, may plan and execute whatever is to be done, according to his-own pleasure and discretion. 
<p><measure value="3d." type=currency><num value="3">3</num>d.</measure> No sufficient choice is afforded to the board of treasury, who are to judge and decide, for they have not even taken advantage of having <num value="3">three</num> architects attached to the office and paid by it; nor does it appear that they have hitherto at all encouraged the <pb id="p.186" n="186"> competition of other professional men, or called for any variety of designs. 
<p>The committee venture to suggest, that a considerable improvement may be effected in the existing system, without overturning, or re-modelling, or even disturbing it to any great extent; and their recommendation upon the whole matter is this:--That no public buildings should be hereafter erected, nor any considerable alterations in the structure of any of the existing buildings be adopted, except upon directions given by the lords of the treasury, and founded upon minutes of that board: and that the plans and estimates of all such new buildings, should be signed by at least <num value="3">three</num> lords of the treasury, and be preserved in the records of that office. 
<p>That a commission, consisting of <num value="5">five</num> persons, <num value="2">two</num> of whom at least should be privy councillors, and holding some responsible offices, should be appointed by his majesty to act as a council without salary, to advise the board of treasury upon all designs and plans for the erection or considerable alteration of public buildings. The opinions and recommendations of this council to be laid before the board, and annexed to the plans and estimates approved by the treasury. It has already been observed, that St. Stephen's chapel before it was converted to its present use, was the chapel of our ancient kings;  <QUOTE>and that building which was once consecrated to the devotions of the monarch, has since become the surest safe-guard for the liberties of the people.</QUOTE>  By a transition, at which the superstition or the piety of our forefathers would have shuddered, the sanctuary of religion has been converted to secular purposes; and a temple, solemnly dedicated to the high services of Heaven, has been appropriated to uses of a worldly and earthly nature. The chapel of St. Stephen, when forming part of the palace of Westminster, was not, however, strictly speaking, a place of promiscuous worship; but was sanctified to the devotions of the monarch and his household. 
<p>Stowe informs us that here Edward the Confessor lived and died. 
<p>The legislative assembly, long before it became divided into the <num value="2">two</num> houses of lords and commons, was held in a part of the ancient palace, though not in that portion of it now under consideration. 
<p>Till the time of Edward III. the lords and commons constituted only <num value="1">one</num> house: when a separation took place between them,  <QUOTE>owing probably, more to some idea of present expediency, than convenience at the time, than to any depth of political wisdom or sagacity. But those measures which seem fortuitous, which are rather the sudden product of some fugitive feeling, or present circumstances, than of mature reflection and deliberate contrivance, are often found to exceed in utility and permanence, the long digested combinations of philosophical speculation. Thus even the apparent caprice of accident seems often to mock the wisdom of humanity.</QUOTE>  <pb id="p.187" n="187"> 
<p>After their separation from the lords, the commons used to sit in the chapter house, belonging to the adjoining abbey till the period of the Reformation, when the chapel of St. Stephen was granted for the purpose. Since that time the commons have used this place, almost without interruption, to the present day. 
<div2 type=section id="c.3.7"><HEAD>The House of Commons.</HEAD>
 
<p>Edward VI. was the <num value="1">first</num> monarch who gave permission that the chapel of St. Stephen should be converted to a chamber of parliament; but this was long after the commons had begun to form a separate and distinct branch of the legislature from the lords. 
<p>The origin of the present representative system it is by no means easy to ascertain with positive accuracy. It were no difficult task, however, to conjecture, that something of the kind must have originated with the <num value="1">first</num> formation of civil society, though the corruption of after times, and the successive tyrannies which grew out of feudal systems, and popular vassalage had almost eradicated the very principles on which the liberties of the people were founded. 
<p>In the reign of our <num value="3">third</num> Henry, the oppressions of the crown, increased by the exorbitant demands of papal authority and priestly domination, had advanced to such a pitch, that the patience of the English was exhausted. The barons, observes a foreign writer on our history,<NOTE><BIBL>Rapin.</BIBL></NOTE> were still more aggrieved than the people, as the most considerable posts, to which they thought themselves alone entitled, were enjoyed by foreigners. Henry quickly furnished them with an opportunity to execute their plans, by calling a parliament, which met at London, soon after Easter, A. D. <datestruct value="1258"><year reg="1258">1258</year></datestruct>.<NOTE><BIBL>Mat. Paris, p. <num value="963">963</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> Of this parliament he demanded, according to custom, a powerful aid for the affair of Sicily; for, as to the voyage to the Holy Land, which had before occupied his attention, it was no longer mentioned. 
<p>The parliament, in conformity with a resolution previously made by the principal barons, instead of granting the demand, vehemently complained of the breach of Henry's promises, and of all the grievances generally spoken of during his reign. 
<p>The king, clearly perceiving, by the decided tone of the parliament, that the charm of royal haughtiness would not at all avail him on the present occasion, fell to his old artifice of pleading guilty to the lords, and promising speedily to reform what had hitherto been amiss in his government and conduct. For once, however, the lords refused to fall into the snare; and they told the designing monarch, in plain terms, that they could no longer leave such an important and necessary concern to the caprice of his own will and convenience, but would immediately set about the good work themselves, and so reform the government, that hereafter there should be no fear of the breach of the king's faith. Henry, though boiling with indignation, still <pb id="p.188" n="188"> managed to disguise or repress his feelings; and, under pretence of the difficulties that attended this matter, prorogued the parliament, and ordered that the next session should be kept at the city of Oxford. 
<p>As he was apprehensive that in the mean time the lords would make the necessary preparations for the accomplishment of their designs, he promised them, in the most solemn manner, that at the time and place appointed he would not fail to meet them, and enter with them cordially upon the great and necessary work of reformation. He likewise immediately signed a charter, by which he guaranteed, that the articles to be reformed should be drawn up by <num value="24">twenty-four</num> lords, of whom he would chose <num value="12">twelve</num>, and engaged to abide by whatever should be settled by these commissioners. To add weight to this charter, he caused Prince Edward, his son, to sign it with him. 
<p>The lords, however, had so repeatedly experienced the deceptive nature of Henry's promises, that the stock of their credulity was now exhausted, and without relying on his professions, the barons summoned all their military tenants and vassals; and on <datestruct VALUE="-06-11"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=11>11</day></datestruct>, the day appointed, came to Oxford, well attended and resolutely bent on compelling the king to perform his word. 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> thing done was the election of the <num value="24">twenty-four</num> commissioners, who were to draw up the articles of the intended reformation. 
<p>Henry chose the following <num value="12">twelve</num>: the bishops of London and Winchester; Henry, son to the king of the Romans; John, earl of Warren; Guido de Lusignan, and William de Valance, Henry's half-brothers; John earl of Warwick; John Mansel, a Friar; J. de Derlington, Abbot of Westminster; Henry de Wengham, Dean of St. Martin's, London; and, lastly, (as is generally supposed, though his name is omitted,) either Peter of Savoy, or James Audley. 
<p>The barons elected the following: the Bishop of Worcester; the earls, Simon, of Leicester; Richard, of Gloucester; Humphrey, of Hereford; Roger, of Norfolk, Earl Marshal; the lords Roger Mortimer, John Fitz-Geoffrey, Hugh Bigod, Richard de Gray, William Bardolf, Peter de Montford, and Hugh Despenser.<NOTE><BIBL>Mat. Par.</BIBL></NOTE> The <num value="1">first</num> of these lords they chose for the president of the council. 
<p>These commissioners, having been duly elected, drew up some articles, to which the parliament reserved to themselves a power to add, from time to time, such others as should be deemed necessary for the good of the state. This was, however, an extension of the original compact, which it is probable the king had not contemplated, but which his own fickleness or faithlessness, and the liberties of the people, rendered absolutely necessary. 
<p>The articles drawn up by the lords commissioners were in substance as follow: <num value="1">1</num>. That the king should confirm the great charter <pb id="p.189" n="189"> which he had sworn to observe, but without any effect: <num value="2">2</num>. That the office of chief justiciary should be given to a person of capacity and integrity, that would administer justice as well to the poor as the rich, without distinction: <num value="3">3</num>. That the chancellor, treasurer, justices, and other officers and public ministers should be chosen by the <num value="4">four</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num>: <num value="4">4</num>. That the custody of the king's castles should be left to the care of the <num value="4">four</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num>, who should intrust them to such as were well affected to the state: <num value="5">5</num>. That it should be death for any person, of whatever degree or order soever, to oppose, directly or indirectly, what should he ordained by the <num value="4">four</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num>: <num value="6">6</num>. That the parliament should meet at least once every year, to make such statutes as should be judged necessary for the welfare of the kingdom. 
<p>The order is drawn up in form in the annals of Burton, and there it is said, the <num value="24">twenty-four</num> commissioners ordained, that there should be <num value="3">three</num> parliaments in the year: the <num value="1">first</num>, <num value="8">eight</num> days after. Michaelmas; the <num value="2">second</num>, the morrow after Candlemass-Day; and the <num value="3">third</num>, on the <datestruct VALUE="-06-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>.<NOTE><BIBL>Ann.

<p>It is certain that <num value="12">twelve</num> deputies, or representatives of the commons, were present in this parliament; but whether by permission or right, is not equally clear. <num value="1">One</num> should suppose, by the number, corresponding with those of the lords commissioners, that these commoners were admitted as a matter of right, even though this might be the <num value="1">first</num> time that the people had their representatives in parliament; this point, however, is not obvious. Rapin<NOTE><BIBL>Hist. Eng. i. <num value="333">333</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 inclines to the opinion, that this was a new regulation; nor is that opinion without foundation;  <QUOTE>for,</QUOTE>  says he,  <QUOTE>if the commons had a right to sit there at the time we are speaking of, it would be very strange that they should nominate but <num value="12">twelve</num> representatives for the whole kingdom. Moreover, all the historians agree, that these <num value="12">twelve</num> were not commoners,</QUOTE>  that is, has now reputed to be, but all barons, stiled immediate tenants of the crown. 
<p>To shew that the commoners sat in this parliament as a matter of right, it may be remarked that the Annals of Burton, before quoted, contain the act for the election of the <num value="12">twelve</num>, drawn up in French in this form:  <QUOTE> Be it remembered, that the community have chosen <num value="12">twelve</num> wise men, who shall come to parliaments, as also at other times, when there shall be need; and the king, or his council, shall command or send to them, to treat of the business of the king and realm; and the community will hold for established what these <num value="12">twelve</num> shall do; and this shall be done to spare the cost and charges of the community.</QUOTE>  
<p>It does not appear by what mode of election these <num value="12">twelve</num> representatives were respectively appointed to their important trusts: they were, however, chosen by the barons. Their names are entered in the Annals above-mentioned; and are as follow:--The bishop of London, the earl of Winchester, the earl of Hereford, <pb id="p.190" n="190"> 
<p>Philip Basset, John de Baliol, John de Verdun, Roger de Grey, Roger de Sumerie, Roger de Montalt, Hugh Despenser, Thomas de Gressley, and Egidius de Argentum. These were all barons. 
<p>It is, however, to be remarked, that if the commons had before this been accustomed to send representatives to parliament, it is strange that no historian has distinguished them from the rest of the nobility. Not <num value="1">one</num> writer, from the conquest, to the end of the reign of Henry III. though many have spoken of parliaments, has distinguished the commons, as making a distinct body, or separate house from the barons:<NOTE>In France, it was not till the reign of Philip the Friar, that the <num value="3">third</num> estate was admitted into the general assembly of the states.-<bibl>Pasquier les Recherches.</bibl></NOTE> a separate house they certainly did not make,<NOTE><BIBL>Rapin, ubi supra.</BIBL></NOTE> till some time after they were admitted as an essential part of the legislative body. 
<p>It is not the province of this work to trace all the proceedings of this new parliament, in which was laid the foundation of those liberties and constitutional blessings, which, to the present day are the boast and the glory of our isle--the envy and admiration of the world. Henry hesitated, and his son flatly refused to confirm the Oxford provisions, till their faithlessness, and the people's resolution brought on what are emphatically called the barons' wars. 
<p>In the mean time, the city of London took upon itself to send commissioners, delegates, or representatives to the general assembly; and perhaps this was the <num value="1">first</num> time that any single city, at least since the heptarchy, enjoyed this constitutional privilege. 
<p>As the principle of representative legislation began to be better known, and its merits and advantages more generally appreciated and felt, the practice of sending representatives from the community to parliament gradually extended itself over the country; till at length the elective franchise became an almost universally acknowledged right, to be claimed by every part of the nation. 
<p>Henry III. died in the year <datestruct value="1272"><year reg="1272">1272</year></datestruct>; and was buried in the abbey church of St. Peter's, Westminster. The reader has already had an account of his tomb and statue of brass in a former part of the present volume. He was succeeded by his son Edward I. surnamed Longshanks. Though this monarch is usually called the <num value="1">first</num>, he was, in fact, the <num value="4">fourth</num> of that name; there having been <num value="3">three</num> Edwards in the time of the Saxons. For this reason, in speaking of this Edward, and the <num value="2">two</num> following kings, by the name of Edward I., II., III., it was once customary to add the words <foreign lang=la>post conquestum</foreign>; but by degrees that distinctive addition was omitted. 
<p>As soon as Henry was buried in Westminster, John, earl of Warren; Gilbert, earl of Gloucester; with many of the clergy and laity, went up to the high altar, and swore fealty to his son Edward. This was on the <datestruct VALUE="-11-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>,<NOTE><BIBL>M. Westm. p. <num value="401">401</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> during the new king's absence. <pb id="p.191" n="191"> 
<p>Shortly after this, a new parliament assembled, composed not only of the lords spiritual and temporal, but also of the knights of the shires, and representatives of the principal cities and boroughs. 
<p>According to the Annals of Waverly, at this parliament were assembled the archbishops, bishops, earls, barons, abbots, and priors; <num value="4">four</num> knights from every county, and <num value="4">four</num> representatives from each city;<NOTE><BIBL>Waver. Ann. p. <num value="277">277</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> so it would appear that the practice of sending representatives of the people to parliament was more generally resorted to in those days than even at present. The same thing had been done under the government of the earl of Leicester, during the late king's captivity; but as these assemblies were not called by the royal authority, though certainly agreeably to the fundamental principles of the constitution, and in conformity to the spirit of the great charter, granted by John and reluctantly confirmed by Henry III., no positive evidence can be thence deduced, that before this period, the commons had any known right to sit in the legislative assemblies of the nation. This, it is universally admitted, is a point full of difficulty; but it is nevertheless certain, that this privilege was fully enjoyed during the reign of Edward I. and that from that time to the present, it has continued to be exercised, without the least interruption. 
<p>Parliaments, in the early periods of our history, were very frequently called; but it does not exactly appear, how often or whether they were, in their original construction, periodical. 
<p>It is probable, however, when they were <num value="1">first</num> so considered, that they were annual. This, at least, is generally supposed to have been the case till the year <datestruct value="1509"><year reg="1509">1509</year></datestruct>: after which they depended more on the will or the wants of the monarch. 
<p>In the reign of Henry the VIII. there were <num value="9">nine</num> parliaments; the average duration of which did not much exceed <num value="1">one</num> year and <num value="8">eight</num> months: the longest being <num value="5">five</num> years, <num value="5">five</num> months, and <num value="1">one</num> day; and the shortest <num value="1">one</num> month and <num value="2">two</num> days. 
<p>During the short reign of Edward VI. there were only <num value="2">two</num> parliaments; <num value="1">one</num> of which lasted <num value="4">four</num> years, <num value="5">five</num> months, and <num value="11">eleven</num> days; the other only <num value="1">one</num> month. 
<p>In the reign of Mary there were <num value="5">five</num> parliaments; averaging little more than <num value="3">three</num> months each. 
<p>The  <QUOTE>glorious days of good queen Bess,</QUOTE>  as they are somewhat sarcastically, sung, saw <num value="10">ten</num> new parliaments, each of which extended, upon an average, to little more than a year and a half: the longest however was <num value="7">seven</num> years, <num value="10">ten</num> months, and <num value="10">ten</num> days; the shortest, <num value="1">one</num> month and <num value="25">twenty-five</num> days. 
<p>James the <num value="1">First</num> called only <num value="4">four</num> parliaments, the longest of which extended to <num value="7">seven</num> years, <num value="10">ten</num> months, and <num value="21">twenty-one</num> days; the others, to about <num value="2">two</num> months, <num value="1">one</num> year and <num value="2">two</num> years respectively. 
<p>The unfortunate Charles I. had <num value="5">five</num> parliaments, if some of them deserved that honourable title: those which might at all be called <pb id="p.192" n="192"> legal assemblies, lasted only a few months; but the long parliament, dissolved by the protector Cromwell, lasted the extraordinary length of <num value="12">twelve</num> years, <num value="5">five</num> months, and <num value="17">seventeen</num> days! 
<p>The witty and profligate Charles II. had occasion for <num value="4">four</num> parliaments: <num value="1">one</num> of which was extended to the great length of <num value="16">sixteen</num> years, <num value="8">eight</num> months, and <num value="16">sixteen</num> days! So deeply had the principles of corruption taken root by the very means employed to check it I The others, were of course, very short: <num value="1">one</num> indeed, lasted only <num value="7">seven</num> days. 
<p>James II. had authority over <num value="2">two</num> parliaments only; <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="2">two</num> years, <num value="4">four</num> months, and <num value="16">sixteen</num> days; and the other of <num value="1">one</num> year, <num value="1">one</num> month, and <num value="4">four</num> days. 
<p>Then commenced and ended the glorious and bloodless revolution of <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>, After which William III. called <num value="5">five</num> parliaments, the longest of which lasted only <num value="6">six</num> years, <num value="6">six</num> months, and <num value="22">twenty-two</num> days; and the others little more than <num value="2">two</num> years each.* 
<p>Queen Anne also called <num value="5">five</num> parliaments, not <num value="1">one</num> of which existed <num value="3">three</num> years. 
<p>Our <num value="1">first</num> George, during whose reign the Septennial act was passed, had only <num value="2">two</num> parliaments: <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="5">five</num> years, <num value="11">eleven</num> months, and <num value="21">twenty-one</num> days; and the other of <num value="5">five</num> years, <num value="2">two</num> months, and <num value="26">twenty-six</num> days. 
<p>George the <num value="2">second</num> called <num value="5">five</num> parliaments, which existed somewhat above <num value="6">six</num> years each.<NOTE>It is to be observed, that the Triennial Act, passed in <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>. seems to have had but little influence on the actual duration of parliaments.</NOTE>
 
<p>During the reign of his late majesty, George III. there were <num value="12">twelve</num> parliaments. 
<p>It would be not only amusing, but instructive, to retrace the various changes that have, from time to time, taken place in the forms used in the arrangements and regulations of these legislative assemblies. The following, however, must suffice: 
<p>They are introduced from their journals, to evince the astonishing improvement we have made in humanity, manners, and the mode of legislation.

At <num value="9">nine</num> o'clock in the morning they went.

<p>The number of clerks and other officers immediately employed in and about the house of commons, are by no means numerous considering the infinite importance of the establishment; neither are their salaries in the aggregate very high. 
<p>The clerk of the house of commons, properly so called, has a deputy and <num value="2">two</num> assistant clerks. Thee are also a clerk of the committees of privileges and elections, a clerk of the fees, and his assistant; <num value="4">four</num> principal committee clerks, and as many deputy-committee clerks, besides <num value="4">four</num> assistant-deputy committee clerks, and as many others who only occasionally attend upon committees. There is a clerk of the journals and papers; <num value="3">three</num> clerks of the ingrossments, with <num value="1">one</num> assistant clerk. In the private bill office, there are <num value="3">three</num> clerks. Besides these several clerks in the several offices of the chief clerk, in addition to those already enumerated, there are about <num value="14">fourteen</num> other inferior clerks. 
<p>The above servants of the house are directly employed in the interior duties of that legislative assembly, and appear to be all, more or less, under the immediate direction of the speaker, who is the highest officer belonging to that honourable body. 
<p>The following appear to be more directly attached to exterior duties, unless when called into the house on important occasions: The serjeant at arms, and his deputy; a deliverer of votes; housekeeper and deputy; collector of serjeants' fees; <num value="2">two</num> upper and <num value="1">one</num> lower door-keepers; <num value="4">four</num> messengers, and <num value="3">three</num> supernumerary messengers; also <num value="1">one</num> deliverer of post letters. There are likewise a chaplain to the house of commons, the secretary to the speaker, and a train bearer; to which may be added the printers of the journals, &amp;c. and the printers of the votes. These latter, however, are not solely employed in their business by the house of commons. 
<p>Thus it will appear, that notwithstanding the vast and complicated affairs of this national institution, under whose cognizance comes whatever concerns the peace, the welfare, the prosperity, the finances, nay, the very being of the whole empire, including all its foreign dependencies, allies, relations, treaties, &amp;c. &amp;c. the house of commons does not keep in actual employ within the walls of the establishment as many clerks, and other officers, as are often found in the shops and banking-houses of our ordinary merchants and trades people:  <QUOTE>I am speaking, it is true, of <num value="1">one</num> branch only of the legislature; but there is no other department of the state whose concerns are not in some way or other under the eye and care of this; for, truly, it may be said, that the commons house, of parliament, by the powers with which it is invested, of granting or withholding the supplies needful for the support of the whole state, possesses within itself more actual authority, and, if it were so disposed, <pb id="p.195" n="195"> a capability of exercising more despotic sway, than is delegated to the king himself; and though called the lower house, is, in fact, the most perfect security that a people can possibly expect or obtain for their liberty, their property, and their rights.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Nightingale.</BIBL></NOTE> This house is the. <QUOTE> grand inquest of the nation,</QUOTE>  and has authority to impeach the greatest lords in the kingdom, both spiritual and temporal. 
<p>Before the commons, after a general election, can enter upon any business, or even the choice of a speaker, all the members enter the court of wards, where they take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy, with those appointed by the act of <num value="1">1</num> William and Mary, in the presence of an officer appointed by his majesty, who is usually the lord steward of the household. After they have chosen the speaker, they take the same oaths again at the table: and subscribe their opinions against the doctrines of transubstantiation, the invocation and adoration of saints, and the sacrifice of the mass; and before they can give any vote in the house, except for the choice of speaker, they are obliged to abjure the pretender.<NOTE>These acts have been qualified as far as regards Dissenters.</NOTE>
 
<p>Any member of parliament is at liberty to move for a bill to be brought in; which being agreed to by the house, the person who made the motion, with some of those who seconded and supported it, are ordered to prepare and bring it in. When the bill is ready, some of the same members, desire leave to bring the bill to the table; and upon the question being agreed to, it is read the <num value="1">first</num> time, by the clerk at the table; after which the speaker, taking the hill in his hand, reads the abbreviate, or abstract of it. This being done, after the debate on the bill, if any such should take place, he puts the question whether it shall have a <num value="2">second</num> reading; and sometimes, upon a motion being made, appoints a day for it. 
<p>In the mean time, the bill, in most cases, is ordered to be printed, and circulated among the members, by which they have individually an opportunity of perusing it, and seriously weighing its contents, and of calculating its local, or political effects. After the <num value="2">second</num> reading, should no fatal objection be made against it, and there is a majority in its favour, it is read a <num value="3">third</num> time, either on the same or some other day; after this, if it should still not be thrown out by a majority, it is passed to the house of lords, where it undergoes the same ordeal. 
<p>Petitions, whether from individuals, cities, or public bodies, are offered like the bills at the bar of the house, and are brought up and delivered at the table by the member who presents them. But leave must always be asked for permission to have a petition read; except in the case of petitions from the city of London, which are brought up by the sheriffs, whether members or not, and are instantly read by the clerk at the table, without any previous leave being asked. 
<p>The lord mayor of the city of Dublin, has also authority to <pb id="p.196" n="196"> present petitions from that corporation. Petitions are, however, perhaps in every other case, presented by members only. 
<p>Messengers from the lords, and all persons appearing at the bar of the house, are introduced by the serjeant attending the houses with the mace upon his shoulder, but they are not so introduced until the serjeant has received an intimation to that effect from the speaker, who has been previously informed that such persons are in waiting.<NOTE>Strangers, that is persons having no business to transact in the house, are admitted to the galleries with impunity, upon paying about half-a-crown each, or by the written order of any member.</NOTE>
 
<p>While the speaker is in the chair, where he always is, unless the house is in a committee, the mace lies upon the table, except when sent upon any extraordinary occasion into Westminster-hall, and the court of requests to summon the members to attend; but when the members resolve themselves into a committee of the whole house, the mace is laid under the table, and the chairman to that committee takes the chair where the clerk of the house usually sits. Strangers are then excluded, and the speaker assumes his ordinary functions as a member of parliament, debating like other members, upon any subject then in question. 
<p>At other limes, when the votes are equal, the casting vote is always given to him; and though his political opinions are supposed to be favourable to the party in power, he will not unfrequently decide in favour of the popular side. This most honourable line of conduct has been followed, on more than <num value="1">one</num> occasion, by the present speaker, who may fairly be said to be a favourite with all parties, owing to his great experience, his profound knowledge of the duties of his situation, his inflexible integrity, and uniform impartiality. 
<p>In a committee of the whole house, they divide by changing sides, the ayes, that is, those who vote on the affirmative side of any question, taking the right hand side of the chair; and the noes, or negative party, the left; there are <num value="2">two</num> tellers, who count the votes on each side. 
<p>On ordinary occasions, the commons vote by yeas and noes; but if it appears also doubtful which is the greater number, they divide as follows:--If the question relates to any thing already in the house, the noes go out; but if it be to bring any thing in, as a bill, petition, &amp;c. the yeas, or ayes go out. <num value="2">Two</num> of each opinion, who after they have told those within, place them in the passage between the bar and the door, and then tell or count the others who went out; which done, the <num value="2">two</num> tellers, who have the majority, take the right hand, and place themselves within the bar: all <num value="4">four</num> advancing, bow <num value="3">three</num> times, saying  <QUOTE>the ayes who went out are so many;</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>the noes who staid so many;</QUOTE>  or the contrary. This is repeated by the speaker, who declares the majority.<NOTE><BIBL>Hugh. Lon. iv. <num value="260">260</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 <pb id="p.197" n="197"> 
<p><num value="40">Forty</num> members are necessary to make a house, and <num value="8">eight</num> a committee. 
<p>Formerly the parliament was always dissolved at the death of the king; but by an act it is now provided, that a parliament sitting, or being at the king's demise, shall continue; and if not sitting shall meet expressly, for keeping the peace of the realm, and preserving the succession to the crown. 
<p>The speaker and clerks always wear gowns in the house, as the professors of the law do in term time; but no other of the members wear robes, except the <num value="4">four</num> representatives of the city of London, who, the <num value="1">first</num> day after every new parliament, are dressed in scarlet gowns, and sit together on the right hand of the chair, next to the speaker. As there is always what is called a ministerial and an opposition party in the house, it has become customary to distinguish the sides of the house by the terms ministerial, or as they are invidiously called, the treasury, and the opposition benches; not that there are any actual distinctions in the respective seats; but that the friends of either party usually sit together. 
<p>Members of parliament have several honorary and substantial privileges, such as freedom from arrest, &amp;c. but it is impossible to enumerate them in this place. What are called the privileges of parliament are extremely numerous, sometimes intricate, and often doubtful in their character; requiring great experience, judgment, and knowledge of the laws, the customs, and the constitution itself to decide concerning them rightly, and to discriminate, with perfect satisfaction, the rights and interests of all parties: for many of these privileges are the result rather of custom than of statute, of suffrage than of law: seldom, however, has any member cause to complain that his privileges are not protected. 
<p>The qualification of a member with respect to property is that he be in the actual possession at the time of his taking the oaths, of an estate, of freehold, or copyhold, for his own life, or some greater estate, either in law or equity, over and above what will satisfy and clear all incumbrances, of the respective annual value hereafter limited, (viz.) <measure value="600l." type=currency><num value="600">600</num>l.</measure> per annum for every knight of the shire, and <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">300</num>l.</measure> per annum for every citizen, burgess, or baron of the cinque ports; and persons not being possessed of such estates respectively, their election and return shall be void.<NOTE><BIBL>Act <num value="9">9</num> Anne, cap. <num value="5">5</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The act referred to below does not extend to the eldest son of a peer, or of a person qualified to be a knight of the shire; and the universities may elect members as formerly. 
<p>No person to be qualified by virtue of any mortgaged premises, unless the mortgagee has been in possession <num value="7">seven</num> years before the election. Every candidate, at the request of another candidate, or of <num value="2">two</num> of the voters, shall take the oaths of qualification, according to the form therein prescribed, (viz.) <measure value="600l." type=currency><num value="600">600</num>l.</measure> for a county and <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">300</num>l.</measure> for a city. <pb id="p.198" n="198">

III. cap. <num value="20">20</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> but though the property so qualifying should be all lost, given away, or otherwise disposed of immediately after a member had taken his seat, he does not therefore forfeit his honours, or privileges as a member of parliament. 
<p>Any member may be expelled for irregular, disloyal, flagrantly dishonest, or other disgraceful practices, but cannot resign his seat, except on receiving some office under government, real or nominal, with the holding of which, his duties as member of parliament are deemed incompatible.

<p>Such, at least, would appear from the acts already cited, and <pb id="p.199" n="199"> from various others which the reader will find referred to, more at length in Dr. Beatson's <title>Chronological Register of both houses of parliament, from the Union, <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct></title>. 
<p>Having treated of the origin, nature, and construction of the present House of Commons, we will, in a very brief manner, endeavour to give some account of the 
<div2 type=section id="c.3.8"><HEAD>House of Lords.</HEAD>
 
<p>This part of our venerable constitution may be called the parent stock, from whence sprung the other branch already described, being the successors of the ancient barons; to which have been added many new families raised to the peerage by the various monarchs that have filled the throne since the conquest. 
<p>The seats in this house are not elective, but hereditary, and consequent upon the dignity of the peers. 
<p>The Scotch peers take precedence of English peers of the same rank created since the union in <datestruct value="1707--"><year reg="1707">1707</year></datestruct>. The Irish peers, in like manner, take precedence of the British peers of the same rank, created since the union in <datestruct value="1801--"><year reg="1801">1801</year></datestruct>. Irish peers, since that period, rank according to the dates of their patents among the peers of the united kingdoms. Before the respective unions of Scotland and Ireland to England, the English peers, without any regard to the dates of their patents, took precedence of all others subject to the king. 
<p>The clerks and officers of the lords' house of parliament consist of the speaker, who is the lord chancellor; a deputy speaker, who is usually the vice chancellor; a chairman of committees; a clerk of the parliaments, who may be a member of the lower house, and has a salary of <measure value="3300l." type=currency><num value="3300">3,300</num>l.</measure> including the usual deduction of fees and taxes; a clerk-assistant; a reading-clerk and clerk of the private committees, united in the same person; counsel to the chairman of committees; a clerk of the journals; a copying clerk, and <num value="6">six</num> other clerks of the office; gentleman usher of the black rod, who attends the other house with summonses, &amp;c. from the lords, to call them to hear the royal assent given to bills, the king's speech, &amp;c. &amp;c.: a yeoman-usher; a serjeant at arms; a receiver of the fees; about <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> door-keepers; a house-keeper; a keeper of the state-room, and a necessary woman. 
<p>Peers on their <num value="1">first</num> introduction to the house, both on their original accession to a title, and their advancement to a higher <num value="1">one</num>; also all bishops at their <num value="1">first</num> consecration, and upon every future promotion, pay the following fees:--

<p>The house of lords, in conjunction with the king and commons, have the power, not only of making and repealing all laws, but of constituting the supreme judicature of the kingdom. The lords here assemble to take cognizance of treason and high crimes committed by the peers and others; they try all who are impeached by the commons, and acquit or condemn, without taking an oath, only laying their right hand upon their breast, and saying,  <QUOTE> Guilty,</QUOTE>  or  <QUOTE>Not Guilty, upon my honour.</QUOTE>  They receive appeals from other courts, and even sometimes reverse the decrees of Chancery; but from this highest tribunal there lies no appeal. 
<p>This, therefore, being a court of justice in the proper sense of the word, it is open at all times to the public, except when any very important question is in debate, and the house is likely to be uncomfortably crowded; at which times a note from some lord is necessary to gain admission. But there are no accommodations for the people, as in the commons; no galleries or benches besides what are occupied by the lords within the bar; the people, therefore, when fatigued, seat themselves on the floor, which is covered with matting. It is not necessary to describe the forms of proceeding in this house: they are similar to those pursued in the commons, only that the lords do not retire when the house is divided on any question. 
<p>The speaker has no chair, as in the commons, but is seated on a large woolsack, covered with red cloth, with no support for the back, nor any table to lean against in front. This is a most preposterous and almost cruel custom. 
<p>At the upper end of the room, which is somewhat less than the house of commons, is the throne, upon which is seated the king on solemn occasions, in his robes, with the crown on his head, and adorned with all the ensigns of majesty. On the right hand of the throne is a seat for the heir apparent, and on the left another for the next person of the royal family. Below the throne on the king's ZZZ SO FAR <pb id="p.201" n="201"> right hand, are the seats of the archbishops, and a little below them the bench of bishops. Before the throne are <num value="3">three</num> broad seats, stuffed with wool; on the <num value="1">first</num> of which, next the throne, sits the lord chancellor, or keeper of the great seal, as before mentioned; on the other <num value="2">two</num> sit the lord chief justice, the master of the rolls, and the other judges who attend occasionally to be consulted on points of law. 
<p>The benches for the lords spiritual and temporal are covered with red cloth. 
<p>There is a bar across the house, at the end opposite the throne, at the outside of which sits the king's <num value="1">first</num> gentleman usher, called the black rod, from a wand he carries in his hand. Under him is the yeoman, who waits at the inside of the door, a crier without, and a serjeant-at-mace, who always attends the lord chancellor. 
<p>When his majesty is present with the crown on his head, the lords sit uncovered, and the judges stand till the king gives them leave to sit. In his absence, the lords at their entrance do reverence to the throne, as is done by all who enter the presence chamfer, by bowing. 
<p>When his majesty has so signified, the judges may sit, but must not be covered till the lord chancellor, or keeper, informs them that the lords permit them to be so. 
<p>The Painted Chamber, an apartment so called, between the house of lords and the house of commons, is often used for conferences of the <num value="2">two</num> houses, or their committees, there being a gallery of communication for the members of the house of commons to come up without being crowded. In this room the parliaments were formerly opened; and it is said to have been the bed-chamber of Edward the Confessor. 
<div2 type=section id="c.3.9"><HEAD>The House of Commons.</HEAD>
 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1800"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>, it was deemed expedient to enlarge the present house of commons, in order to make room for the <num value="100">one hundred</num> Irish members, which, by the act of union, were entitled to a seat in the British parliament. 
<p>When the wainscotting was taken down for this purpose, the walls were found to be covered with oil paintings, many of which were in a high state of preservation. 
<p>Dr. Charles Gower, <num value="1">one</num> of the physicians to the Middlesex hospital, communicated a knowledge of this discovery to Mr. John Thomas Smith, an eminent artist, who was so much pleased with these most beautiful specimens of ancient art, that he solicited and obtained permission to copy them for the purpose of engraving. This work, after incessant and most laborious toil, he accomplished, amidst the noise and dust of the workmen, who were not permitted to delay their work for the artist's accommodation. These facts are mentioned for the purpose of more successfully referring the reader to the work mentioned below,<NOTE><BIBL><title>Antiquities of Westminster; the old palace; St. Stephen's chapel, (now <pb n="p.202"> the House of Commons,) &amp;c. &amp;c. containing <num value="246">two hundred and forty-six</num> engravings of topographical subjects, of which <num value="100">one hundred</num> land <num value="22">twenty-two</num> no longer remain</title>.-By John Thomas Smith.</BIBL></NOTE>
in the plates <pb id="p.202" n="202"> of which are not merely delineated the outline of the several subjects, whether on the stone or glass, but the colours are actually matched; and they exhibit every tint which is known in the art of staining glass. 
<p>Several grotesque paintings, which were found in St. Stephen's chapel, served as supporters to the different coats of arms which adorned the frieze. A close resemblance may be discovered between some of those monstrous combinations and the figures which were employed in the Egyptian hieroglyphics. 
<p>There are also some specimens of sculpture very elegant and beautiful, which give us a very high idea of the sumptuousness and variety of the ornaments, with which the chapel of St. Stephen was formerly enriched. The foliage which twines round some of the columns appears to vie in beauty with the decorations of the Corinthian capital. 
<p>Among the specimens of the Gothic frieze are some which no Grecian artist would have blushed to own. 
<p>Mr. Nightingale justly remarks,  <QUOTE>that such exquisite productions of art should have been so shamefully neglected is matter of surprise to those only who are unacquainted with the exact nature and extent of the prejudice, which, at the time of the Reformation, swelled the hearts of the reformers. The connection which these paintings were supposed to have with the ancient superstition, was a sufficient cause for their neglect, and even their total destruction. When, therefore, the sanctuary of devotion was converted into the present house of commons, the exuberant decorations on the windows and the walls, were probably defaced without scruple or remorse. Not even a tradition remained of their existence; nor is it probable that they would ever have been known, if the union with Ireland, by necessitating an enlargement of the house, had not caused them to be brought to light. Something singular, therefore, is attached to the history, the preservation, and the discovery of these curious vestiges of art, which belong to a period comparatively barbarous, and exhibiting an almost total dearth in embellishments of genius and taste.</QUOTE>  
<p>It is clear, however, that in the reign of Edward III. the period alluded to, the arts were not totally neglected; that the method of painting in oil was practised, even at that time, with no ordinary success; and that the genius of elegant and fanciful design was then alive. 
<p>At the alteration and enlargement of the house of commons, which brought these relics of the arts to light, the entire side walls were taken down, except the buttresses that supported the ancient roof, and thrown back, by which more seats were procured. The chapel, as finished by Edward III. was of such great beauty, that we <pb id="p.203" n="203"> can scarcely refrain from regretting that it should have been defaced by these alterations. 
<p>The interior walls, on which were the gilding and profusion of ornament above-mentioned, appear to have been divided into compartments of Gothic, but not inelegant forms; each having a border of small gilt roses, and the recesses covered with paintings. 
<p>At the east end, including about a <num value="3">third</num> of the length of the chapel, which part exhibited various tokens of having been once inclosed for the altar, the walls and roofs were completely covered with gilt and painted decorations; and presented, even in their mutilated state, a beautiful relic of the fine arts. The gilding was remarkably solid, and highly burnished, and the colours of the paintings vivid, being both apparently as fresh as in the year in which they were executed. 
<p><num value="1">One</num> of the paintings, representing the adoration of the shepherds, had some merit, even in regard to the composition. 
<p>The west front of this venerable chapel is still nearly entire, but greatly defaced by the coating of plaster, which covers it. Under the direction of the late Mr. Wyatt, a new window was formed in the end, and <num value="2">two</num> pinnacles added, in the usual fantastic style of decoration, which mark the works of that architect; the window is merely constructed for show, as the <num value="3">three</num> modern ones which light the interior still exist in the middle of it. 
<p>The whole front of the commons, next to the street, was also rebuilt by the same architect, in its present Gothic style, and cased with stucco. 
<p>It shows a confused and ill-formed assemblage of towers, turrets, and pinnacles, jumbled together without taste or judgment; rendered the more offensive from the proximity of the abbey and the hall, and certainly not improved by the poverty-struck cloister subsequently appended to its basement, or by the more recent additions of Mr. Soane, which are, if possible, in a worse style. 
<p>Beneath the house, in passages or apartments appropriated to various uses, are considerable remains, in great perfection, of an under chapel of curious workmanship; and an entire side of a cloister, the roof of which is scarcely surpassed by the exquisite beauty and richness of Henry the <num value="7">Seventh</num>'s chapel in the neighbouring abbey. 
<p>The interior of the house of commons has nothing very striking to recommend it; convenience, not ornament, appears to have been the great object of the government in the application and enlargement of this ancient chapel to the use of the legislature. 
<p>It is still rather too small; but is nevertheless, peculiarly adapted to its use. Along the sides and west end runs a handsome gallery for the accommodation of members and strangers. The galleries are supported by slender iron pillars, crowned with gilt Corinthian capitals. The walls are wainscotted to the ceiling. 
<p>The speaker's chair stands at some distance from the wall; and <pb id="p.204" n="204"> is highly ornamented with gilding, having the royal arms at the top. Before the chair is a table at which sit the clerks. 
<p>In the centre of the room, between the table and the bar, is a capacious area. 
<p>The seats for the members occupy each side, and both ends of the room, with the exception of the passages. There are <num value="5">five</num> rows of seats, rising in gradation above each other, with short backs, and green morocco cushions. 
<p>The seat on the floor, on the right hand of the speaker, is sometimes called the treasury bench, because there many of the members of the administration usually sit. The side immediately opposite is occupied by the leading members of the opposition. 
<p>When the members go to the house, they usually pass through Westminster hall; and there are, under the same roof several good coffee-rooms. which are resorted to, not only by the members, but by the public in general; and particularly in term time, when they are crowded with barristers and others having business in the courts of law. 
<p>On the east side, adjoining to the hall, is the edifice called 
<div2 type=section id="c.3.10"><HEAD>The Speaker's House.</HEAD>
 
<p>This was a small court of the palace, but has been greatly altered and enlarged, under the direction of Mr. Wyatt, at the time the additions before spoken of were made to the chapel. 
<p>The house itself is most exquisitely and tastefully ornamented with whatever is essential to the residence of an officer of such high rank. 
<p>The speaker can go into the house of commons from his own apartments, a passage having been made for that purpose. 
<div2 type=section id="c.3.11"><HEAD>The House of Lords.</HEAD>
 
<p>Is an oblong but handsome room, rather less than that in which the commons meet. This apartment was also repaired, &amp;c. on the occasion of the union with Ireland. It is decorated with pinnacles, in the front next to Abingdon-street; but certainly has but little to recommend it to our admiration. 
<p>The interior is formed out of that spacious apartment, formerly called The Court of Requests; and is handsomely ornamented with fine tapestry hangings, consisting of historical figures, representing the defeat of the Spanish armada in <datestruct value="1588--"><year reg="1588">1588</year></datestruct>. They were the gift of the states of Holland to queen Elizabeth. 
<p>At the Union with Ireland, these hangings were taken down, and cleaned, and put up in their present place. The tapestry is judiciously set off with large frames, of brown stained wood, dividing it into compartments, respectively containing the several portions of the history, or events of the destruction meditated by the Spaniards on that occasion. The heads, which form a border to each design, are portraits of the several gallant officers who commanded in the English fleet at that important period. <pb id="p.205" n="205"> 
<p>This room does not occupy the whole of the old court of requests; part of the north end being formed into a lobby, by which the commons pass to the upper house; and the height being reduced by the elevated floor of wood, over the original stone pavement. 
<p>The throne is an armed chair, elegantly carved and gilt, ornamented with crimson velvet. Above it is a splendid canopy of crimson velvet, surmounted by the imperial crown; this canopy is supported by <num value="2">two</num> gilt columns of the Corinthian order, with a magnificent architrave which forms the cornice of the canopy. 
<p>Though by no means a splendid room, the house of lords is nevertheless a very handsome <num value="1">one</num>. It has been, however, in contemplation to build a new <num value="1">one</num>, though no decisive measures have as yet been adopted to that effect. At the south-east corner of Old Palace Yard, on the site of the present regal entrance to the house of lords, was the prince's chamber, part of the ancient palace; adjoining the prince's chamber was the apartment known as the old house of lords, in the cellars of which the celebrated gun-powder treason was to have taken effect; all this has been destroyed, and some mean brick edifices erected in their stead. The exterior of these buildings display some of the most ridiculous attempts at imitating the grandeur of Gothic architecture ever witnessed. 
<p>The royal approach to the house of lords is by an enclosed Gothic corridor, with a porch of the same character, leading to a staircase designed by J. Soane, esq. which was commenced in the summer of <datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>, and finished in <datestruct VALUE="1823-01--"><month reg="01">January</month> <year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>; it formerly led to the prince's chamber and other apartments of the ancient palace, which were taken down, and the foundations laid for the royal gallery, in <datestruct VALUE="1823-10--"><month reg="10">October</month> <year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>; the same was finished in <datestruct VALUE="1824-02--"><month reg="02">February</month> <year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>. Part of the ancient site is appropriated for a library, and committee rooms for the houses of lords and commons. The royal staircase is in <num value="2">two</num> flights; on the top are recesses: to the right and left are arched openings to a decorated vestibule, which is adorned by <num value="8">eight</num> scagliola columns supporting <num value="4">four</num> galleries; to the left, between <num value="4">four</num> columns, is a large opening to the royal gallery, which may be considered as divided into <num value="3">three</num> compartments, each of which has a lantern dome filled with stained glass; the whole surface of the ceiling and parts of the walls are extravagantly adorned with flowers, flutings, scrolls, &amp;c. whilst the lantern lights are vaulted, highly enriched, supported by columns, and additionally decorated by candelabra, &amp;c. 
<p>Adjoining the house of lords is the ancient building called the 
<div2 type=section id="c.3.12"><HEAD>Painted Chamber</HEAD>
 
<p>Howel relates a tradition respecting this apartment, that Edward the Confessor died in it, and Baker has given this as a fact, without <pb id="p.206" n="206"> either citing any evidence to support it, or hinting any suspicion of its accuracy; and, indeed, it is very probable, though no early authority for it is known, except the fact of that monarch's having expired at Westminster, and, consequently, in the palace there. It derived its name from numerous paintings on the walls, representing battles, &amp;c. which were certainly as old as <datestruct value="1322--"><year reg="1322">1322</year></datestruct>, and perhaps much older, as in the <num value="21">21st</num> year of the reign of Henry III. a mandate occurs for paying to Odo the goldsmith, clerk of the works at Westminster, <measure value="4l." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> pounds</measure> and <measure value="11s." type=currency><num value="11">eleven</num> shillings</measure> for pictures to be done in the king's chamber there.<NOTE><BIBL>Walpole's Anec. of Painting, vol. i. p. <num value="11">11</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> In this apartment was some curious tapestry, which was taken down about <datestruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>. 
<p>On the north side of St. Margaret's church-yard anciently stood 
<div2 type=section id="c.3.13"><HEAD>The Sanctuary.</HEAD>
 
<p>A place of refuge for criminals of various descriptions. The metropolis at <num value="1">one</num> time abounded with these haunts of villainy and wretchedness. They were originally instituted for the most humane and pious purposes, and owe their origin to <num value="1">one</num> of the sacred institutions of the Mosaic law, which appointed certain cities of refuge for persons who had accidentally slain any of their fellow-creatures. Previous to the entrance of the Israelites into Canaan, it was ordered that when they should come to be settled there, a provision should be made for the fixed dwelling of the priests and Levites, who, being a distinct body from the rest of the nation, and having no share in the division of the country, were appointed to have their residence in several towns, with such a portion of ground about them as would serve for their commodious subsistence. 
<p>It is probable that these convenient retreats, which are dignified with the name of  <QUOTE> cities,</QUOTE>  were only small villages, perhaps not unlike our own Moravian settlements. They were, however, walled round, and had suburbs for the Levites and the inferior ministers of religion, extending from the wall  <QUOTE>a <num value="1000">thousand</num> cubits round about.</QUOTE>  Le Clerc, however, says that the word <hi rend=italics>Kir</hi>, usually called a wall, means in this instance the centre of the city. 
<p>Of these cities, the whole number whereof was <num value="48">forty-eight</num>, <num value="6">six</num> of the most conveniently situated were to be cities of refuge, places of sanctuary, or privileged districts; whither any person who had, by chance-medley, killed another, might immediately repair and take sanctuary. The cities of the Levites were appointed cities of refuge, rather than any other, because they were a kind of sacred places, inhabited by sacred persons. 
<p>This institution of sanctuaries, as Marmonides justly observes, was a merciful provision both for the manslayer, that he might be preserved, and for the avenger, that his blood might be cooled by the removal of the manslayer out of his sight. 
<p>The city of refuge protected him that fled thither, yet so as the right of the judges to bring the matter to a fair trial remained entire. <pb id="p.207" n="207"> 
<p>The elders of the city of refuge enquired whether the manslayer could be received or not, upon a summary hearing of the case. But they were not the proper judges, nor could they examine witnesses. Therefore he was delivered, upon demand, to the senate, or court of justice of that city where the fact was committed, that he might be tried by those whether he was guilty or not guilty of the crime of wilful murder. 
<p>This is a material point to be attended to, in tracing the history and origin of privileged places, or sanctuaries, such as the <num value="1">one</num> in the city of Westminster, now under our consideration. It is certain that, among the Hebrews, with whom the practice originated, these privileged places were not designed to thwart or obstruct the ends of justice, but merely to protect the offender against the revenge of the friends of the slain. 
<p>The heathens, whom it is become fashionable with some modern philosophers to compliment as the most enlightened part of mankind in those early ages of the world, had also their places of refuge; and with them it was not allowed to bring the person to trial against his will, who had taken sanctuary in those privileged places. So far from this being the case among the Hebrews, the wilful murderer might be taken even from God's altar, if he fled thither for sanctuary, which he might do in regard to crimes of an inferior nature; and if he would not stir from thence, he might be put to death on the spot. 
<p>It is well known that the <foreign lang=Greek>a)/sula</foreign> of the Greeks were a sanctuary for criminals of every description. Throughout the whole Gentile world the temples and places of worship were sanctuaries for crimes. Euripides complains of these <foreign lang=Greek>a)/sula</foreign> in the following strong terms :--  <QUOTE> It is surprising that the gods did not constitute laws to mortals with more wisdom and equity. For criminals, instead of being protected by the altar, ought to have been driven from it, since it is a profanation for impious hands to touch things sacred to the gods. On the contrary, those places ought to have been a sanctuary for the just, a refuge from injury and oppression; so would not the gods have showed equal favour to the bad as to the good, when they came to the same place.</QUOTE>  
<p>Such is a faint outline of the origin and nature of privileged places. The idea was preserved among the Christians, but extended at <num value="1">first</num> to the churches, and other sacred places within their immediate precincts. In process of time, however, by a strange compound of Judiacal, Pagan, and Christian principles, the practice was shamefully corrupted, and this humane privilege most shamefully abused. The temples of the God of justice were made the sanctuaries of every species of wickedness; and to this day, in some parts, they are but little improved in this respect. 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1487"><year reg="1487">1487</year></datestruct>, during the pontificate of Innocent VIII., a bull was issued, and sent here, to lay a little restraint on the privileges of sanctuary. It stated that, if thieves, murderers, or robbers, <pb id="p.208" n="208"> registered as sanctuary men, should sally out and commit fresh nuisances, which they frequently did, and enter again, in such cases they might be taken out of their sanctuaries by the king's officers.-- That as for debtors, who had taken sanctuary to defraud their creditors, their persons only should be protected; but their goods, out of sanctuary, should be liable to seizure. As for traitors, the king was allowed to appoint them keepers in their sanctuaries to prevent their escape. 

 
<p>Long before this, these privileged places had become great evils, and Henry VII. had applied to the pope for a reformation; but could obtain only what is here stated, which was confirmed by Alexander VI. in the year <datestruct value="1493"><year reg="1493">1493</year></datestruct>. 
<p>When the next Henry had resolved to become independent of the authority which he had sworn to respect, (and which he had written to defend,) he caused an act to be passed which totally debarred persons accused of treason of the benefit of sanctuary. He did not, however, abolish the privilege, only so much of it as might affect his usurped and absurd claims to the ecclesiastical supremacy. 
<p>After the Reformation had gained strength, these places of sanctuary began to sink into disrepute. They were, however, still preserved; and though none but the most abandoned resorted to them, the dread of innovation, or some other cause, preserved them from demolition, till, in the year <datestruct value="1697"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct>, the evils of these sanctuaries had grown so enormous, that it was become absolutely necessary to takesome legislative measures for their destruction. Accordingly, the same year, an act was passed for the suppression of most of them, particularly that in the Minories, those in the neighbourhood of Fleet-street, Salisbury-court, Whitefriars, Ram-alley, and Mitrecourt; Fulwood's-rents, in Holborn; and Baldwin's-gardens, in Grays-inn-lane; the Savoy, in the Strand, and Montague-close, Deadman's-place; the Clink, and the Mint, in Southwark. Through the neglect of the police, the Mint re-assumed its former character, and that with increased profligacy; nor was it finally suppressed till the reign of George I. 
<p>The sanctuary in Westminster was a structure of immense strength. Dr. Stukeley, who wrote about the year <datestruct value="1724"><year reg="1724">1724</year></datestruct>,<NOTE><BIBL>Itinerarium Curiosum.</BIBL></NOTE>
saw it standing, and says that it was with very great difficulty demolished. The church belonging to it was in the form of a cross, and double, <num value="1">one</num> being built over the other. It is supposed to have been the work of Edward the Confessor.<NOTE>Fig. <num value="1">1</num>. in the annexed plate is the Sacristan's room. Fig. <num value="2">2</num>. The Revestry. Fig. <num value="3">3</num>.

<p>There were <num value="2">two</num> sanctuaries, the great and the little, or rather, perhaps, <num value="2">two</num> branches of the same institution. 
<p>At the west end of the latter, in the time of Maitland, (<datestruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>) there were remains of a prodigious strong stone building of <num value="2">two</num> <pb id="p.209" n="209"> <num value="190">hundred and ninety</num> feet square, or <num value="72">seventy-two</num> feet and a half the length of each side; and the walls in thickness no less than <num value="25">twenty-five</num> feet. This fabric had originally but <num value="1">one</num> entrance or door below, and that in the east Ride, with a window hard by, which seems to have been the only <num value="1">one</num> below the height of <num value="22">twenty-two</num> feet of the building, where it was reduced to <num value="3">three</num> feet in thickness, and contained <num value="4">four</num> windows about the height of <num value="10">ten</num>, and width of <num value="3">three</num> feet <num value="9">nine</num> inches on the south side. 
<p>The area of this exceedingly strong building, (exclusive of the arched cavities in the walls) was divided by a wall from east to west, of <num value="2">two</num> feet <num value="10">ten</num> inches in thickness, into <num value="2">two</num> spaces of <num value="9">nine</num> feet <num value="10">ten</num> inches each in width, representing a frame for bells; which plainly evinces it to have been the strong bell-tower that was erected in the little sanctuary, by Edward III. for the use of the collegiate church of St. Stephen, and not, as Strype imagines it to have been, the church of the Holy Innocents, for that was the church of St. Mary-le-Strand.<NOTE><BIBL>Maitland, ii <datestruct value="1342--"><year reg="1342">1342</year></datestruct>.</BIBL></NOTE>
The strong tower was afterwards made use of as a tavern or wine vault; but is now totally demolished. 
<p>Within the precincts of this sanctuary was born Edward V., and here his unhappy mother took refuge with her son, the young duke of York, to secure him from the villainous proceedings of his cruel uncle, the duke of Gloucester, who had possession of his elder brother. 
<p>On the ground once occupied by the sanctuary, the scene of this melancholy and deceitful tragedy, was afterwards built the Westminster meat-market, which was removed some <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num> years ago; and the site is occupied by the new Guildhall, a neat but plain building of brick, with a portico at the east end. 
<div2 type=section id="c.3.14"><HEAD>The New Mews.</HEAD>
 
<p>On a piece of ground appropriated by parliament as an open space to admit an uninterrupted view of the venerable abbey, the present pile of stabling has been most tastelessly erected. The architect was Decimus Burton, esq.; it is a quadrangular building of brick, with stone dressings; it consists of <num value="4">four</num> fronts, nearly uniform; in the centre of each is a projection, ornamented with antae, and contains in a recess <num value="2">two</num> columns of the Doric order; it is surmounted by the entablature of the order, which is applied as a crowning member to the entire building; the walls are relieved by antae, and at each end is a pavilion, composed of <num value="2">two</num> Doric columns and the same number of ante, and covered with pediments. The entrances are in the central portions, and are arched and rusticated. The building is well designed for the purposes to which it is applied, and in any other situation would be an ornament, at present by the contrast afforded by the magnificent abbey church <pb id="p.210" n="210"> it only affords another proof of the want of judgment and taste evinced by the directors of public buildings in this neighbourhood. 
<div2 type=section id="c.3.15"><HEAD>The Almonry</HEAD>
 
<p>The Almonry was at the west end of the sanctuary; and derived its name from being the place where the alms collected at the abbey were given. The name is still preserved in that of Great Almonry, the <num value="1">first</num> opening in Dean-street, from Tothill-street. There is also the Little Almonry, at the east end of the former; on the middle of the south side of Great Almonry, is Almonry-yard. 
<p>This place is an object of interest and curiosity, from the circumstance of its being that where William Caxton erected the <num value="1">first</num> printing-press, to print with moveable <hi rend=italics>metal types</hi>, that was ever known in this country. I have marked as emphatical the words metal types, because it is by no means clear that Caxton was the <num value="1">first</num> person to introduce this valuable art into England. 
<p>This honour, however, was universally given to Caxton by our earliest writers, who assert, that, during a residence of many years in Holland, Flanders, and Germany, he acquired a knowledge of the whole method and process of the art; and that by the patronage of the great, and especially the abbot of Westminster, he set up a press within the abbey, and began to print books there about the year <datestruct value="1471"><year reg="1471">1471</year></datestruct>. 
<p>It has been asserted that his press was fixed in that part of the abbey called Islip's chapel; and that afterwards he removed his materials to the Almonry in the year <datestruct value="1474"><year reg="1474">1474</year></datestruct>. Caxton. was certainly the <num value="1">first</num> to bring the art to perfection in this country. He was born in Kent, in the reign of Henry IV., and served an apprenticeship to <num value="1">one</num> Robert Laye, (or Large) a mercer, who, after being sheriff and lord mayor of London, died in <datestruct value="1441--"><year reg="1441">1441</year></datestruct>, leaving by will <measure value="34bmark" type=currency><num value="34">thirty-four</num> marks</measure> to his apprentice, William Caxton. He then went abroad to settle, and was entrusted by the mercer's company to be their agent, or factor, in Holland, Zealand, Flanders, &amp;c. 
<p>In <datestruct value="1464--"><year reg="1464">1464</year></datestruct>, a commission was granted to him and Richard Whitehall, esq. to transact and conclude a treaty of commerce between the king, Edward IV., and his brother-in-law, Philip duke of Burgundy, to whom Flanders at that time belonged. The commission styles them ambassiatores, procuratores, nuncios, and deputatos speciales, and gives to both, or either of them, full powers to treat, &amp;c. 
<p>When the lady Margaret of York, the king's sister, arrived at Bruges, on the occasion of her marriage with Charles, duke of Burgundy, Caxton appears to have been of her royal highness's retinue. He was either <num value="1">one</num> of her household, or held some constant part or office under her; because he says he received from her a yearly fee or salary, besides many other good and great benefits. Being more expert than most others in penmanship and languages, <pb id="p.211" n="211"> particularly Latin and French, it is highly probable that he was employed by the duchess in some literary way. 
<p>He resided many years at the court of this duchess, and dedicated or addressed some of his works to her; others he addressed to Edward IV; and others again to the duke of Clarence, the king's brother. He afterwards printed, also, for Henry VII. and his son prince Arthur. 
<p>His residence in Flanders gave him opportunities of becoming acquainted with the then newly-invented art of printing; in which, when he had perfected himself, which he did not accomplish (as he himself says) without great labour and expence, he was employed by the duchess to translate out of the French, and print a large volume, which appeared under the title of  <QUOTE>The Recuyel of the Historyes of Troye,</QUOTE>  and is the <num value="1">first</num> book we know of that was printed in the English language. The whole title-page ran thus:  <QUOTE>The Recuyel of the Historyes of Troye: composed and drawn out of dyverce bookes of Latyn, into Frensche, by the right venerable persone, and worshipfull man, Raoul le Feure, preest, and chapelayn unto the right noble, gloryous, and myghty prynce in his tyme, Philip duc of Bourgoyne of Braband, &amp;c. m the yeare of the incarnacion of our Lord God a <num value="1460">thousand and four hundred sixty</num> and foure, and translated and drawn out of the frensche into englishe, by Willyam Caxton, mercer, of the cyte of London, at the commandement of the right hye myghty and vertuose princesse, his redoubted lady Margarete, by the grace of God duchesse of Burgoyne, &amp;c. which sayde translation and worke was begonne in Brugis, in the countere of Flaunders, the fyrst day of Marche, the yeare of the incarnacion of our said Lord God a <num value="1000">thousand</num> foure <num value="160">hundred sixty</num> and <num value="8">eight</num>, and ended and fynyshed in the holy cyte of Colen, the xix day of Septembre, the yeare of sayd Lord God a <num value="1000">thousand</num> foure <num value="160">hundred sixty</num> and <num value="11">eleven</num>.</QUOTE>  
<p>This translation was finished, therefore, in <datestruct value="1471--"><year reg="1471">1471</year></datestruct>, and was, doubtless, printed with all possible speed afterwards. The close of it has this remarkable statement:-- <QUOTE>Thus I ende this boke, &amp;c. and for as moch as in wryting of the same, my penne is worn, myn hande very, and myn eyen demmed with overmoch lokyng on the white paper-and that age creepeth on me dayly-and also because I have promysid to dyverce gentilmen and to many frends to addresse to them as harely as I might this sayd boke, therefore I have practysed and lerned at my grate charge and expense to ordeyne, this sayd boke in prynt after the maner and forme as ye may here see, and is not writen with penne and ynke as other bokes ben, to thende that every man may have them attones, for all the bokes of this storye, named the Recuyell of the Historyes of Troyes, thus emprynted as ye here see, were begoone in oon day, and also finish in oon day, &amp;c.</QUOTE>  
<p>By this it would appear, that before any part of this work was put to press, the whole of it was composed, or set up; otherwise it <pb id="p.212" n="212"> would have been impossible it should have been begun and completed in the same day. 
<p>It appears, that shortly after this he returned to England; for the edition of another of his books,  <QUOTE>The Game of Chess,</QUOTE>  is dated <datestruct value="1474--"><year reg="1474">1474</year></datestruct>, and is allowed by all typographical antiquaries to have been the <num value="1">first</num> specimen of the art, in English, printed in this country. The title is as follows:-- <QUOTE>The game and play of Chess: in which thauctorities, dictes, and storyes of auncient doctoures, philosophers, poetes, and of other wyse men ben recounted and applied unto the moralitie of the publique wele, as well of the nobles as of the commonpeople. Translated outof Frensch, and emprynted by William Caxton, fynyshed of the last day of Marche, the yeare of our Lord God a <num value="1000">thousand</num> foure hondred and LXXIIII.</QUOTE>  
<p>It has been generally asserted, that all his books were printed at Westminster, yet we have no assurance of this fact from himself, nor any mention of the place before the year <datestruct value="1477"><year reg="1477">1477</year></datestruct>, when he printed Earl Rivers' Translation of the Sayings of the Philosophers, &amp;c. several years after he began printing. It has also been represented that Islip was abbot of Westminster at that time; but this is a mistake, if, as some assert, that Thomas Milling was abbot in <datestruct value="1470--"><year reg="1470">1470</year></datestruct>, was made bishop of Hereford a few years after, and probably held the abbey <foreign lang=la>in commendam</foreign> in <datestruct value="1485--"><year reg="1485">1485</year></datestruct>, in which year he was succeeded by John Estney; so that Milling, who was reputed to be a great scholar, must have been the generous friend and patron of Caxton, who gave that liberal reception to an art so beneficial to learning. There is no clear account of the age of Caxton, but he was certainly very old; probably above fourscore at the time of his death. He lived at least <num value="20">twenty</num> years after he had finished his translation of the Recuyel of Troy, and pursued his business with extraordinary diligence, at Westminster, till the year <datestruct value="1491"><year reg="1491">1491</year></datestruct>, in which year he died. 
<p>Since the time of good old Caxton's residence in the Almonry, this place has become the nest of women of the lowest description, being occupied by houses in a most villainous condition. 
<p>In the Almonry was a chapel dedicated to St. Catherine, and not (according to Stow) to Anue; but when, or by whom, it was founded is not known. It was very near this chapel that Caxton carried on his business. 
<p>On the south-west side of the abbey church is the Dean's yard, a neat square, formerly open, but recently railed in. Here is 
<div2 type=section id="c.3.16"><HEAD>Westminster School.</HEAD>
 
<p>This great national establishment is supposed to have been erected about the year <datestruct value="1070"><year reg="1070">1070</year></datestruct>, but refounded by queen Elizabeth in the year <datestruct value="1560"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct>, for the education of <num value="40">forty</num> boys, denominated the queen's scholars (now called the king's scholars) and <num value="12">twelve</num> almsmen. The masters who have presided, and many of the scholars who <pb id="p.213" n="213"> have received their tuition here, have, in all the period since its <num value="1">first</num> endowment, been men of eminent talents, and afforded bright ornaments to the nation both in church and state. William Camden, the antiquary, was at <num value="1">one</num> time master, and Ben Jonson <num value="1">one</num> of his scholars. 
<p>Dr. Busby, of classical memory, and celebrated on some other accounts, was master of this school upwards of <num value="50">fifty</num> years, and greatly contributed by his great erudition to its reputation. He was a native of Lincolnshire, and was born <datestruct VALUE="1606-09-22"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=22>22</day>, <year reg=1606>1606</year></datestruct>, and died in <datestruct value="1695--"><year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>. 
<p>Among the eminent men who received their education within these walls, may be noticed the great lord Burleigh, the poets Cowley, Dryden, Prior, Bourne, Churchill, and Cowper; Kennet, bishop of Peterborough; Atterbury, bishop of Rochester; Boyle, earl of Cork and Orrery; Bonnel Thornton; Gibbon, the Roman historian; George Colman the elder, and Richard Cumberland, dramatists; and the great earl of Mansfield. 
<p>The museum belonging to this school was founded by Dr. Busby; he enlarged the master's house, and also the Green-coat Hospital in Tothill-fields. He likewise built his prebendal house, paved the choir of the abbey with black and white marble, and did many other acts of public and private generosity, by which his name has been ennobled. 
<p>The dean and chapter of Westminster hold the prebendal manor of Chiswick on lease from the prebendary of Chiswick, of St. Paul's cathedral, under lease for <num value="3">three</num> lives. It has passed through several hands, but contains a stipulation, taken from the original lease, that the lessee should erect additional buildings, adjoining to the manor house, sufficient for the accommodation of <num value="1">one</num> of the prebendaries of Westminster, the master of the school, the usher, <num value="40">forty</num> boys, and proper attendants, who should retire thither in time of sickness, or at other seasons when the dean and chapter should think proper. 
<p>To this day a piece of ground is reserved in the lease to the sublessee, as a play-ground for the scholars; though it is not known that the school was ever removed to Chiswick since Dr. Busby's time. It is on record that he resided there, with some of his scholars, in the year <datestruct value="1657"><year reg="1657">1657</year></datestruct>. Dr. Nichols was the last master who actually resided at the college-house. Dr. Markham (late archbishop of York), when master of Westminster school, rented the prebendal lodgings of the dean and chapter. 
<p>The whole was let on a repairing lease in <datestruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct>, and is now, or very lately was, occupied as an academy by Dr. Horne.<NOTE><BIBL>Lyson's Middlesex, vol. ii. p. <num value="192">192</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>Westminster school is now endowed with lands and possessions specifically appropriated to its own maintenance, but is attached to the general foundation of the collegiate church, as far as relates to the support of the <num value="40">forty</num> scholars. It is under the care of the dean <pb id="p.214" n="214"> and chapter of Westminster, and conjointly with the dean of Christ church, Oxford, and the master of Trinity, Cambridge, respecting the election of scholars to their several colleges. The boys on the foundation as before mentioned, are denominated king's scholars from the royalty of their founders, and are in a state of collegiate association. They sleep in the dormitory, have their dinners in the hall, and may have other meals if they chuse. They are distinguished from the town boys (who are very numerous) by a gown, cap, and college waistcoat, which are furnished by the establishment. <num value="8">Eight</num> of them are generally elected at the end of the <num value="4">fourth</num> year to Christ church, Oxford, or Trinity college, Cambridge. They have studentships at Oxford, and scholarships at Cambridge. The former are worth from <num value="40">forty</num> to <measure value="60l." type=currency><num value="60">sixty</num> pounds</measure> per annum; but the latter are of small beneficial consideration. 
<p>The buildings occupy a considerable space of ground. The college hall, or refectory for the king's scholars, was originally an apartment in the house of the abbot, and served that dignitary in a similar capacity. It was erected by Nicholas Litlington, abbot in <datestruct value="1362--"><year reg="1362">1362</year></datestruct>. This apartment is wainscotted to a considerable height, and the roof (which is of timber) is supported by corbels of angels holding shields of arms. 
<p>The school is a spacious and handsome room, with a timber roof of plain but neat workmanship. At <num value="1">one</num> end is a seat for the head master; and on each side are <num value="4">four</num> tier of forms, rising above <num value="1">one</num> another. The dormitory is a spacious and elegant building, and was erected for the scholars on the foundation, during the time when the celebrated bishop Atterbury was dean of Westminster. In the year <datestruct value="1708"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, sir Edward Hannes, <num value="1">one</num> of the physicians in ordinary to queen Anne, as a mark of gratitude for the education which he received at this school, had left by his will a <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">thousand</num> pounds</measure> for that useful purpose. It was intended to raise this structure on the site of the ancient chamber, which was built about <datestruct value="1380--"><year reg="1380">1380</year></datestruct> for the purpose of a granary, when the place was a monastery, and had been erected on stone arches of sufficient strength to support any new edifice. Sir Edward Hannes' legacy, however, was not competent to meet the estimated expence; and bishop Sprat, then dean, does not appear to have paid much attention to the business. But Atterbury revived the project, and entered into the execution of it with his usual activity. For this purpose a memorial was presented by the chapter to George I. who gave a <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">thousand</num> pounds</measure>, to which the prince of Wales (afterwards George II.) added <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">five hundred</num> pounds</measure>. The parliament also voted <measure value="1200l." type=currency><num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> pounds</measure>, and William Maurice, high bailiff of Westminster, gave <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">five hundred</num> pounds</measure>. The earl of Burlington gave the design and superintended the works, the total expence of which amounted to about <measure value="5000l." type=currency><num value="5000">five thousand</num> pounds</measure>. In this building the Latin plays are represented by the king's scholars, when a part of it is fitted up as a commodious theatre. <pb id="p.215" n="215"> 
<p>On the north side of the strong tower, in the Little Sanctuary, was a place called Thieving-lane: and was so denominated from thieves passing that way to the Gatehouse prison, during the continuance of the privileges of sanctuary. This gatehouse, together with that and the additional building on the east, were erected by Waller Warfield, butler to the abbey church of Westminster, in the reign of Edward III.; the <num value="1">first</num> for a common gaol, and the building on the east side of Dean's-yard gate for the bishop of London's prison for clerks convicts. 
<p>Nearly adjoining this prison was the long ditch, over which Maud, Henry I.&lsquo;s queen, erected a bridge leading to Tothill-street and the Broadway. 
<p>In Duck-lane, Great Peter-street, is a charity school, where about <num value="60">sixty</num> boys have their learning and clothes, and are put out apprentices by subscription. <num value="1">One</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> and most liberal of these subscribers was Mrs. Green, who gave <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure> per annum forever, commencing about the year <datestruct value="1688"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>, and <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">one hundred</num> pounds</measure> to build a school. 
<p>Henry VII.&lsquo;s almshouses in the Little Almonry, for <num value="12">twelve</num> poor watermen and their wives, who receive <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> and fourpence each couple, and a purple gown every year; and at the burial of a duke, a marquis, or their ladies, in the abbey, <measure value="1l." type=currency><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> <measure value="6s." type=currency><num value="6">six</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence; and for that of an earl, baron, or their ladies, <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure> and sixpence. 
<p>In the midst of the numerous charitable foundations which are congregated in this neighbourhood, stood the Bridewell, for the correction of the disorderly. There was nothing in the building to merit a description; but the internal regulations were very excellent, and received the unqualified approbation of the benevolent Howard. This prison was taken down in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, and a new and enlarged edifice is in course of erection. 
<p>Tothill-fields was at <num value="1">one</num> time a place of considerable importance, but is now sunk into comparative insignificance. In the year <datestruct value="1256"><year reg="1256">1256</year></datestruct>, John Mansel, priest and king's counsel, invited Henry III. and his queen, the king of Scotland and his queen, prince Edward, and a great number of the nobility, knights, the bishop of London, and several of the citizens, to a grand entertainment in his house, which stood in this part of the city of Westminster. The number of guests is stated to have been so great, that the mansion was too small for their reception, and he was compelled to provide tents and pavilions. <num value="700">Seven hundred</num> messes of meat were insufficient for the company. 
<p>Certain houses which stood apart from the rest were appointed, during the great plague as pest-houses. They are still standing. 
<p>In these fields, as they are still called, was held an annual fair for pleasure; and here, during the civil wars in the reign of Charles the <num value="1">First</num>, was erected <num value="1">one</num> of the forts which surrounded the metropolis: it consisted of a battery and breast-work. 
<p>The fair in Tothill-fields was called St.-Magdalen's, and was <pb id="p.216" n="216"> granted by Henry III. to the abbot and canons of Westminster, anno <datestruct value="1257"><year reg="1257">1257</year></datestruct>. 
<p>York-street is the continuation of James-street, bearing to the left. It was formerly called Petty France, on account of the number of French refugees, who settled here on the revocation of the edict of Nantz by Louis XIV. It had its present name in honour of the duke of York. 
<p>The street called Broadway is at the west end of Tothill-street, from the abbey, and the east end of York-street already mentioned. In this place, or rather on the south side of Little Chapel street, stands a chapel of ease to St. Margaret's church. It was called the New Chapel formerly, but is now known by the appellation of 
<div2 type=section id="c.3.17"><HEAD>Broadway Church.</HEAD>
 
<p>It was <num value="1">first</num> built by Marmaduke Darell, brother and executor to the rev. George Darell, D. D. prebendary of Westminster, who, by will, dated <datestruct VALUE="1631-04-24"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg=24>24</day>, <year reg=1631>1631</year></datestruct>, gave <measure value="400l." type=currency><num value="400">400</num>l.</measure> to erect a chapel in Tothill Fields. The present structure was completed in <datestruct value="1636--"><year reg="1636">1636</year></datestruct> by the bounty of archbishop Laud, sir Robert Pye, who gave <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">500</num>l.</measure> and other benefactors. 
<p>During the civil war <hi rend=italics>temp.</hi> Charles I. this chapel was converted into a stable; but at the restoration it reverted to its former situation. 
<p>This structure is curious from the mixture of Italian and pointed architecture which is generally found in the buildings of the period of its erection. The plan is cruciform: but the area occupied by the exterior walls is almost square. The walls are built with dark red brick, and the roof covered with tile. The <num value="4">four</num> elevations of the building are nearly uniform; the flanks only differing from the east and west fronts in a slight projection at the transepts. 
<p>The west front has a large circular arched window in the centre, filled in with stone-work, which formerly consisted of <num value="4">four</num> mullions, dividing the window into <num value="5">five</num> lights, with arched beads, enclosing <num value="5">five</num> sweeps; the head of the arch occupied by <num value="2">two</num> sub-arches and various perpendicular and quarterfoil divisions: the whole are walled up, except the divisions in the head of the arch. On each side of this window are <num value="2">two</num> others nearly square, divided by perpendicular mullions as before, into <num value="3">three</num> lights. The ancient finish to the gable is destroyed, and a modern coping substituted. Above the centre rises a mean turret of wood, ending in a cupola, surmounted by a vane in the form of a key. The flanks have windows of the same number and character as before, which are all open <num value="2">Two</num> oval windows have been added near the east. The transepts are marked by a slight projection; and the gable, like the west front, is modernized. The side divisions are finished with cantilever cornices and dripping eaves. Beneath the <num value="2">two</num> side windows, in each flank, are arched doorways, enclosed in rusticated <pb id="p.217" n="217"> frontispieces, coveted with pediments; the doors are coeval with the main edifice, as the carving of them shews. The raking cornice of the pediment of the northern entrance is broken to let in a tablet inscribed 
<QUOTE rend=center>To the memory of Thomas Jekyll, D. D. pastor of this church, who died <datestruct VALUE="1698-10-1"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=1>1</day>, <year reg=1698>1698</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The east front only differs from the western in having no tower, the windows are entirely open: all the angles of the building are rusticated in brick-work: the mullions and doorcases are stone. The interior is not remarkable for decoration; it is made in breadth into a centre and side aisles by <num value="2">two</num> rows of columns of an order between the Doric and Tuscan, <num value="6">six</num> being disposed on each side of the central aisle, the intercolumniation in the middle answering to the transept being wider than the others; the columns sustain an entablature, which is broken at the transepts, and the cornice returned to the side walls. The ceiling of the central aisle and transepts is elliptically arched and groined at the intersection; the side aisles have plain horizontal ceilings. Galleries are erected on each side of the church with pannelled fronts, and another ranging from the ground to a considerable height, is erected at the west end; it is filled with seats for charity children, and the organ and clock. The altar screen is of oak in <num value="3">three</num> divisions; the central contains the decalogue, over which is a pelican in relief; the initial letters of the commandments are curiously ornamented. The side compartments are each enriched with <num value="2">two</num> Corinthian pilasters sustaining elliptical pediments, also with cherubic heads, foliage, &amp;c. in relief; this screen, with the pews and the rest of the wood work of the interior, appear to have been constructed after the Restoration, when divine service was restored. The pulpit and desks are situated in the central aisle near the altar; the former is hexagonal and sustained on a pillar of the same form; it is evidently the original pulpit of the chapel, and was originally affixed to the eastern pillar of the south transept, as the irons which held the sounding board still remain; it has only received an additional support of a square form to render its appearance uniform with the desks. The font is situated in a pew in the south aisle; it consists of a basin of white marble on a balluster of the same; the cover, &amp;c. carved in oak. 
<p>In the east window are some fragments of painted glass which escaped the pious hands of the roundheads when they profaned the church; in the spandrils of <num value="1">one</num> of the sub-arches in the tracery, are <num value="2">two</num> cherubic heads, and in <num value="2">two</num> of the lights is the following shield of arms, viz. Or on a chevron between <num value="3">three</num> leopards faces, 
<hi rend=italics>sable</hi> a mullet for difference <hi rend=italics>argent</hi>, and a portcullice crowned; these small fragments are still in danger from wilful mischief; many of the windows of the church having been wantonly broken, a melancholy proof of the depravity of the lower orders of the population of the neighbourhood, and at the same time creating a feeling of sorrow that any place of worship belonging to the establishment <pb id="p.218" n="218"> should be in want of proper funds to keep it in a sound state of repair. 
<p>The monuments are numerous; at the east end on the north side of the largest window is a mural monument of white marble, surmounted by a medallion of the deceased held by a cherub, to Mrs. Eliz. Squire, without any date of her decease or age. 
<p>At the opposite side is another mural monument, consisting of a pedestal sustaining an urn of a tasteful design, and surmounted by a bust of the deceased, to the memory of <QUOTE lang=la>Carolus Jervasius Pictor regis,</QUOTE> died <datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="70">70</num>. 
<p>Adjoining is a neat marble tablet with a good basso relievo of St. Paul's school. It is to the memory of W. W.

<p>This charitable foundation was <num value="1">first</num> founded by several inhabitants of the city of Westminster in the year <datestruct value="1633"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>. Their intention was to establish an hospital in this city similar to the excellent institution of Christ's hospital, London: to accomplish this, application was made to Charles I., who by his letters patent of the <datestruct VALUE="-11-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, in the <num value="15">15th</num> year of his reign, constituted certain inhabitants of the city of Westminster a body politic and corporate, by the name and style of  <QUOTE>The governors of the hospital of St. Margaret's, Westminster, of the foundation of king Charles.</QUOTE>  They were to consist of <num value="20">twenty</num> governors. inhabitants of this city, to have perpetual succession, with a right of electing governors, for supplying vacancies; and to purchase lands, tenements, &amp;c. in mortmain, to the value of <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">five hundred</num> pounds</measure> per annum. The king also endowed the hospital with the sum of <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> pounds</measure> per annum, which is paid out of the treasury. 
<p>This noble design was much retarded, and indeed almost frustrated, by the rebellion of the Puritans against the crown and constitution. 
<p>The charitable donations of Charles II., however, and of some others, raised the estate to about <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">300</num>l.</measure>; but even this is much reduced by fines paid to the dean and chapter of Westminster (it being chiefly church-lands) on the renewal of the leases. Casual donations, however, serve to preserve the income of the hospital, so that it is able to maintain a respectable character among the numerous <pb id="p.219" n="219"> charitable institutions of the metropolis. The school is solely for the use of the children of parents belonging to the parish of St. Margaret's. 
<p>This hospital was rebuilt at the charge of Dr. Busby and Charles Twitty, esq. Mr. Cross and Mr. Green gave towards the building <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> pounds</measure>. The duchess of Somerset gave to this hospital <measure value="60l." type=currency><num value="60">sixty</num> pounds</measure> per annum, for ever. Mr. Emery Hill, bequeathed in <datestruct value="1677--"><year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>, <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">one hundred</num> pounds</measure>, and <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> pounds</measure> per annum. Hugh Squire gave <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> pounds</measure>. Since which time there have been a few ether donations and bequests.

<p>This school is at the west end of Great Peter-street, and the south end of Stretton Ground. 
<p>The trustees of this school were incorporated by letters patent, dated <datestruct value="1706--"><year reg="1706">1706</year></datestruct>, by the name of the  <QUOTE>Governors of the Great Coat Hospital in Tothill-fields, of the Royal Foundation of Queen Anne.</QUOTE>  
<p>The school itself was instituted in the year <datestruct value="1698"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>, as a charity school for the education of poor children. 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1701"><year reg="1701">1701</year></datestruct>, the present school house was erected, or <num value="1">first</num> occupied for this purpose. The children at present are nearly <num value="100">one hundred</num> in number, boys and girls. It, however, is not so flourishing as it is known to have been. 
<p>In <datestruct value="1739--"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>, a mathematical school was erected on this foundation, and a proper master retained to instruct the boys in navigation, and to fit them for the sea-service. Several of them have since done honour to their profession, and obtained rank in the navy. 
<p>Since the foundation of this school in <datestruct value="1698--"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>, there have been apprenticed from this school, nearly <num value="2000">two thousand</num> children; and these have all been not only instructed, but clothed and maintained.

<p>Emanuel Hospital, called lady Anne Dacre's alms houses, founded in the year <datestruct value="1601"><year reg="1601">1601</year></datestruct>, the <num value="43">43</num>d of Elizabeth. 
<p>This hospital stands near James'-street, about a quarter of a mile from Buckingham Gate, on the right. It owes its foundation to the benevolent design of Gregory, lord Dacre, who intended to have given <measure value="110l." type=currency><num value="110">one hundred and ten</num> pounds</measure> in money towards building it, and <measure value="40l." type=currency><num value="40">forty</num> pounds</measure> a year, in lands, for ever towards the relief of aged people, and bringing up children in habits of virtue and the knowledge of useful arts. His lordship dying before he accomplished his benevolent purpose, the plan was taken up by his lady, Anne, baroness Dacre, and carried into effect. By her will, dated the <datestruct VALUE="1594-12-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1594">1594</year></datestruct>, she devised, that out of the revenues of her estates, her executor should, in case she did not live to accomplish it herself, build a neat and convenient house, with rooms. for <num value="20">twenty</num> poor grown persons, and <num value="20">twenty</num> poor children, employing for that purpose the sum of <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">300</num>l.</measure>, and to apply for an act of incorporation, and then to assure the manor of Brainsburton, in Yorkshire, and all her other estates in that county, with some exceptions, to that corporation for ever, and to grant leases thereof for <num value="100">one hundred</num> years, or less, at their discretion, at the yearly rent of <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">100</num>l.</measure>, and she gave the reversion to the corporation for ever, and also to complete the purchase of <num value="4">four</num> acres of land, in Tothill Fields, in the county of Middlesex, for which she was then in treaty with Edward More, esq. and whereon the hospital should be built, and then it should be called  <QUOTE>Emanuel Hospital in Westminster,</QUOTE>  and appointed Edward Fenner <num value="1">one</num> of the judges, sir Drue Drury, knight, George Goring, and Edward More, esqrs. executors. 
<p>Soon after her decease the executors proceeded to effect her lord's, and her own intention, completed the purchase, and erected the hospital, and a charter of incorporation, dated the <datestruct VALUE="-12-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct>, <num value="43">43</num>d of Elizabeth, was obtained at the suit of Thomas, lord Buckhurste, lord high treasurer of England, brother and heir of lady Dacre, and at the suit also of her executors, that the house should remain an alms-house and hospital of poor, and be called  <QUOTE>Emanuel Hospital, in or near Westminster;</QUOTE>  that the executors should name and place therein <num value="20">twenty</num> poor aged people to dwell and inhabit therein, and <num value="20">twenty</num> poor children to be brought up, as before mentioned. 
<p>After the decease of the executors, agreeably to the act of incorporation, the lord mayor and aldermen of London, should be for ever called governors of the hospital, and of the lands, and <pb id="p.221" n="221"> possessions thereof; and be invested with all the powers possessed by the original executors. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1601-02-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1601">1601</year></datestruct>, sir Edward More, knight, conveyed to the corporation, then legally called  <QUOTE> the poor of Emanuel Hospital,</QUOTE>  &amp;c. the house then lately built, and the court-yard and garden, containing <num value="1">one</num> acre, and <num value="3">three</num> acres of pasture land, adjoining to the west. To accompany this grant another deed was executed, dated the <num value="20">20th</num> of the same month, of confirmation, and bargain and sale; from the same parties, the executors, to the corporation, confirming the establishment; and granting to them and their successors for ever, the manor of Brainsbarton, &amp;c.<NOTE>The original of this deed is deposited in the Rolls Chapel.</NOTE>
 
<p>Upon the decease of the last surviving executor, which took place in <datestruct value="1623--"><year reg="1623">1623</year></datestruct>, the court of aldermen succeeded as governors. But it appears, from the records of that court, that the inhabitants or parishioners of Chelsea, of Hayes, and of St. Margaret, Westminster had the privilege of presenting, upon every vacancy, <num value="2">two</num> candidates for the choice of the court; and by the language of the entries in their repertory, it seems that certain rooms were appropriated to those parishes,<NOTE>See, particularly, the entries in <datestruct VALUE="1667-07-16"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=16>16</day>, <year reg=1667>1667</year></datestruct>; <datestruct VALUE="1686-12-8"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=8>8</day>, <year reg=1686>1686</year></datestruct>; and <datestruct VALUE="1688-03-22"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=22>22</day>, <year reg=1688>1688</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> which was acceded to upon their repairing the houses. 
<p>The hospital continued in this state till the year <datestruct value="1728"><year reg="1728">1728</year></datestruct>, when the court having appointed a committee to inspect its state, it did not appear, that any provision had been made for <num value="20">twenty</num> poor children, as directed by the will, the revenue having become inadequate to that charge; that the hospital had been rebuilt when this was intended, and a part of the ground left for a chapel and rooms. The allowance paid to the <num value="20">twenty</num> pensioners out of the chamber of London was then only <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">100</num>l.</measure> The lease of the manor expired, and a new lease was granted, at a clear rent of <measure value="360l." type=currency><num value="360">360</num>l.</measure> to Samuel Hassell, of Thorpe, esq. upon the lives of <num value="2">two</num> of his sons, and <num value="1">one</num> grandson ; and at that time the revenue had accumulated to <measure value="4588l. 10s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="4588">4,588</num>l. <num value="10">10</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure> the court, therefore, ordered the building to be completed, and provision to be made for <num value="20">twenty</num> poor children. 
<p>The rental of the manor of Brainsburton, and the ands given to this foundation, have from time to time been increased so much beyond the founder's expectation, as to yield an income exceeding the plan and intention of distributing it to such a limited number of the class of people who were the objects of her benevolence. 
<p>The number of adults, by the original code of rules and statutes, was limited to <num value="10">ten</num> men and <num value="10">ten</num> women; and the children to <num value="10">ten</num> boys and <num value="10">ten</num> girls; and when the revenues of the charity had augmented so as to admit an extension of the plan, the governors had no power, without the express permission of parliament, so to apply the extra funds. Desirous, however, of applying the income of their trust to the intended purpose, they preferred a bill to <pb id="p.222" n="222"> parliament in <datestruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></datestruct>, stating the return and documents of the foundation and that the income and revenues were more than sufficient for the maintenance and support of the objects directed by the will and charter, and that it was probable they would be further increased, by granting building leases, and other means. 
<p>A statute was accordingly granted, empowering the governors to increase the number of objects, in proportion to the state of the funds. 
<p>By virtue of this act, the court admitted <num value="5">five</num> men and <num value="5">five</num> women as out-pensioners, with such allowances as the governors should think fit; and the parish of St. John, Westminster, was added to those out of whom they were all to he chosen. Out of every <num value="18">ten eight</num> from St. Margaret's and St. John's, <num value="1">one</num> from Chelsea, and <num value="1">one</num> from Hayes. The age and qualifications are the same, except that they were not to be possessed of goods exceeding <measure value="200l." type=currency><num value="200">200</num>l.</measure> nor of any annuity exceeding <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>l.</measure> being respectively double the amount of the sums mentioned by the original charter. 
<p>It was also ordered, that the vacancies of in-pensioners should be filled up by out-pensioners; so that every <num value="1">one</num> to be elected, must be an out-pensioner, in the <num value="1">first</num> instance. The number of children also was increased: <num value="8">eight</num> poor boys being clothed and educated at the hospital's expence, at such place and manner as the court may direct; their ages, at the time of election, to be from <num value="7">seven</num> to <num value="10">ten</num>, and to be taken out of the same parishes, and in the same proportion as the men and women. 
<p>By the same act, the number of girls was also increased from <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="12">twelve</num>. 
<p>Passing over numerous judicious regulations, plans of economy, and means of augmenting the funds and the benefits of this foundation, it is sufficient to add, that the whole charity now consists of a master and a mistress, and <num value="20">twenty</num> in-pensioners, viz. <num value="10">ten</num> men, of whom <num value="1">one</num> is the warden; and <num value="10">ten</num> women, of whom <num value="1">one</num> is the matron; <num value="5">five</num> men and <num value="5">five</num> women as out-pensioners; also <num value="10">ten</num> boys and <num value="10">ten</num> girls, who are in-pensioners, and have a school-room, who are all apprenticed to trades, with a premium of <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure>, half of which is paid at the time of their binding, and the remainder when they have served half their apprenticeship.

<p>In Duke-street are some very good houses, having their fronts to the park, <num value="1">one</num> of which is worthy of particular notice. It was built by Judge Jefferies when in the zenith of his barbarous power. James II. for the accommodation of his infamous favourite, granted him permission to erect a gate, with steps into the park. 
<p>After the fall of Jefferies, his son possessed it for a short time, till his dissolute and extravagant life brought on his ruin. The house was then purchased by government, and converted to the use of the commissioners of the Admiralty. 
<p>After the commissioners removed to their present office Jeffries house became private property, and <num value="1">one</num> of the wings was formed into a chapel of ease to St. Margaret's church. Besides the military accountant's office, here are also the store keeper general's office, and the recruiting department. Near the last street is Downing-street, a narrow mean looking street; but opening at the top into a handsome, though small square, in which is the residence of the chancellor of the exchequer and prime minister. 
<p>This house has nothing in its exterior or interior of peculiar merit, except it be the excellent taste and beauty manifested in the furniture, decorations, paintings, library, &amp;c. Nothing, however, appears to be superfluous or unnecessarily expensive; a stranger who visits the houses of some of our very <num value="1">first</num> public officers and political characters, would not suppose that the resources of the country are at any time in a very flattering state, or he would conclude, that a spirit of parsimony had seized the whole nation. <num value="1">One</num> would have thought that the official residence of such a person as the <num value="1">first</num> minister and chief director in the affairs of the revenue, would have had a commanding and conspicuous situation, and have been adorned with some emblems of our national greatness, or some intimations of our rank among the nations of Europe. Instead of this, it is hidden in a corner, and cannot be approached by the public except through <num value="1">one</num> of the meanest looking streets in the metropolis. Indeed, there seems to be a culpable neglect, and want of laudable ambition in this respect, pervading even the government itself. 
<p>At the north east corner of Downing-street is an extensive and noble pile of buildings, known as <pb id="p.225" n="225"> 
<div2 type=section id="c.3.22"><HEAD>The New Privy Council Office.</HEAD>
 
<p>This building was erected on the site of some old offices connected with the Treasury; it was commenced in <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>, the architect being John Soane, esq.; it is an highly enriched building of stone, the order the Corinthian of the Temple of Jupiter Stator at Rome. The principal elevation consists of <num value="3">three</num> stories, besides a basement fronted by a sunken area, guarded by a handsome ballustrade of stone; the <num value="2">two</num> succeeding stories are ornamented by attached columns resting on a stylobate, and crowned with the splendid entablature of the original: at each end the columns are insulated, and form a pavilion, which is returned to the side of the building in Downing-treet, the pavilion being composed of <num value="12">twelve</num> columns; the <num value="3">third</num> or attic story is partially concealed by the ballustrade which surmounts the entablature. 
<p>In the general style of finishing and fitting up the interior, simplicity united with elegance has been adopted. The council chamber is peculiarly rich and imposing in effect; it is adorned with a coved ceiling divided into <num value="4">four</num> compartments, each enriched with ornaments, at <num value="2">two</num> sides of which are lantern lights, extending the whole length of the room; each side of the apartment is distinguished by <num value="2">two</num> Scagliola columns supporting an ornamental entablature, <num value="2">two</num> of which form window frames, and <num value="2">two</num> doorways. At the <num value="2">two</num> ends are <num value="4">four</num> fireplaces, and at the side towards the stairs are <num value="3">three</num> doorways. 
<p>The building is not yet finished, and if the present line of front is adhered to it seems as if it would encroach most inconveniently on the street; it will probably remain in an unfinished state till some expedient can be devised to remedy the present awkward arrangement. The architect proposed to ornament that dull avenue, Downing-street, with <num value="2">two</num> triumphal arches, which from its confined situation, and the want of a vista, would, however grand and expensive the subjects might be, have been perfectly outre and useless as ornaments. If completed, the building will extend <num value="315">315</num> feet, of which about <num value="200">200</num> feet is finished. 
<div2 type=section id="c.3.23"><HEAD>The Treasury.</HEAD>
 
<p>The treasury is a handsome stone building, fronting the parade in St. James's park. The front is rustic, and consists of <num value="3">three</num> stories: the lower of which is Tuscan; the <num value="2">second</num>, Doric, with large arched windows. The upper part of this story is richly ornamented with the triglyphs and metopes of the Doric frieze, though this range of ornament is not supported either by columns or pilasters. Over this is a range of Ionic columns in the centre, supporting a pediment. The whole structure of the treasury is composed of very beautiful parts. Near it is the residence of the prime minister, in Downing-street. 
<p>The treasury is governed by the lords commissioners, <num value="1">one</num> of whom <pb id="p.226" n="226"> is denominated <num value="1">first</num> lord of the treasury. Under these are joint secretaries and other assistants. 
<p>Adjoining the Treasury is Melbourne House, built by sir Matthew Featherstonehaugh: but being afterwards purchased by lord Melbourne, it was exchanged by him with his royal highness Frederick duke of York, for York-house, Piccadilly, who added the dome entrance hall and a handsome portico of the Ionic order. When his royal highness removed to Portman-square, the house was restored to lord Melbourne. 
<div2 type=section id="c.3.24"><HEAD>The Horse Guards</HEAD>
 
<p>The Horse Guards constitute a noble and elegant modern structure, consisting of a centre and <num value="2">two</num> wings. In the centre are arched passages into St. James's-park, under the principal of which the sovereign passes when he goes in state to the house of lords: it is, however, very low and narrow. On each side of the passages are pavilions and stables for the use of the horse guards; although the edifice is calculated as well for the foot as the horse when on duty. The cupola has but little to recommend it: it, however, serves to break the plainness without weakening the building either in reality or appearance. The wings are not so much ornamented as the centre. They consist of a fine front, projecting a little: in the principal story the windows are ornamented: those on the side are plain. Each wing has a pediment, with a circular window in the middle, and the whole building is equally fine and respectable in its construction. The <num value="2">two</num> pavilions in front of the street are occupied by centinels, mounted, who constantly do duty. The expense of this fabric was <measure value="30000l." type=currency><num value="30000">30,000</num>l.</measure> Within are kept the various offices for the war department. 
<div2 type=section id="c.3.25"><HEAD>Whitehall</HEAD>
 
<p>Was originally built by Hubert de Burgh, earl of Kent, chief justice of England in the reign of Henry III. At his death, which happened in <datestruct value="1241--"><year reg="1241">1241</year></datestruct>, he bequeathed it to the Black Friars of London, who disposed of it, in <datestruct value="1248--"><year reg="1248">1248</year></datestruct>, to Walter de Grey, bishop of York; it was consequently the town residence of the succeeding archbishops of that see, from whom it derived the name of York House. The last archbishop who resided here, and who here laid down all his greatness, was the munificent and haughty cardinal Wolsey. His disgrace had no sooner put the fickle and rapacious monarch in possession of this mansion, than he inclosed the park for the accommodation of this palace and St. James's hospital, then just converted into a palace. He also built the beautiful gate, and added the magnificent gallery, for the accommodation of the royal family the nobility, and great officers of state, for the purpose of viewing the tournaments performed in the Tilt-yard. Soon afterwards he ordered a tennis-court, a cockpit, and bowling greens to be formed, with other conveniences, for various kinds of diversion.

Here, in her <num value="63">sixty-third</num> year, with wrinkled face, red periwig, little eyes, hooked nose, skinny lips, and black teeth, she could suck in the gross flatteries of her favourite courtiers. Essex (by his squire) told her of her beauty and worth. A Dutch ambassador assured her majesty, that he had undertaken the voyage to see her, who, for beauty and wisdom, excelled all other beauties in the world. She laboured at an audience to make Melvil, the Scotch ambassador, acknowledge that his charming mistress was inferior in beauty to herself. The artful Scot evaded her question. She put on a new suit of every foreign nation, each day of audience, to attract his admiration so fond was she of dress, that <num value="3000">three thousand</num> different dresses were found in her wardrobe, after her death. Mortifying reflection! in finding such alloy in the greatest character. 
<p>She was fond of dancing; and shewed great humour in this exercise; whenever a messenger from Scotland came to deliver any letters to her from his master, on lifting up the hangings, he was sure to find her dancing to a little fiddle, affectedly, that he might tell James by her youthful disposition, how unlikely he was to come to the throne he so much thirsted after.</QUOTE>

In the reign of James I. Whitehall, being then in a ruinous condition, was begun to be rebuilt in a princely manner. The Banquetting rooms were pulled down, and were afterwards rebuilt by James's successor. 
<p>The building which at present bears the name of the Banquetting-house was begun in <datestruct value="1619--"><year reg="1619">1619</year></datestruct>, from a design of Inigo Jones, in his purest manner; it was executed by Nicholas Stone, the king's architect; was finished in <num value="2">two</num> years, and cost <measure value="17000l." type=currency><num value="17000">17,000</num>l.</measure>; though it seems Jones received at that time, for his ingenuity at labour, as  <QUOTE>surveyor of the works done about the king's houses, only <measure value="8s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="8">8</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> per diem, and <measure value="46l." type=currency><num value="46">46</num>l.</measure> per annum, for house rent, a clerk, and other incidental expences.</QUOTE>  
<p>The Banquetting-house, however, was but a small part of a vast plan, left unexecuted by reason of the unhappy times which succeeded. It was to consist of <num value="4">four</num> fronts, within a large central court, and <num value="5">five</num> lesser ones: between <num value="2">two</num> of the latter, a beautiful circus, with an arcade below: the intervening pillars ornamented with caryatides. The length of this palace was to have been <num value="1152">one thousand and one hundred and fifty-two</num> feet, the depth <num value="874">eight hundred and seventy-four</num> feet.<NOTE>The design of this palace is exhibited in <num value="4">four</num> large prints, by Fourdrinier.</NOTE>
 
<p>The genius and talents of Jones are clearly marked by the part of the building now remaining: it is a regular edifice, of <num value="3">three</num> stories. The lowest has a rustic wall, with small square blank windows; and by its strength appropriately serves as a basement to the orders of the superstructure. 
<p>The next story is of the Ionic order, with columns and pilasters, between which are well proportioned windows, with alternate elliptical and angular pediments. These are surmounted with a proper entablature, on which is raised a <num value="2">second</num> series, of the Corinthian order, with columns, &amp;c. like the other compartments;--the columns and pilasters being placed exactly over those of the lower story. <pb id="p.229" n="229"> 
<p>From the capitals are carved festoons, meeting with masks and other ornaments, in the middle. 
<p>Above is an entablature, on which rises a ballustrade, intersected with pedestals. 
<p>The whole is admirably proportioned and happily executed. The projecting columns have a fine effect in the entablatures, which being brought forward in the same proportion, gives that happy diversity of light and shade so essential to elegant architecture.

<p>George I. converted the interior into a chapel royal, and appointed select preachers from each university to officiate every Sunday throughout the year, at an annual salary, which is, however, but very small. 
<p>The chief ornament of this place is the ceiling, painted by sir Peter Paul Reubens, when he was ambassador at this court. The subject is the apotheosis of James I.

<p>The subject forms <num value="9">nine</num> compartments. The centre represents the monarch on his earthly throne, turning with horror from the god of war and the other discordant deities, and giving up himself to commerce and the fine arts. 
<p>This fine performance, which is done on canvass, is in excellent preservation, and has been more than once repaired. Cipriani received <measure value="2000l." type=currency><num value="2000">2,000</num>l.</measure> for repairing it.

<p>At the instant that the <num value="6">six</num> eagles, and so many also of the enemy's ordinary colours caught the eyes of the multitude, an universal shout of national triumph ensued. The fine company of grenadiers had the honourable charge of them. The bands of the duke of York and the Coldstream regiments then proceeded from the front of the edifice, followed by the eagle bearers. Martial music again cheered <pb id="p.231" n="231"> the ears, and the military procession moved towards Whitehall. On passing the British colours, the eagles were lowered, as a mark of respect due to the conquerors. The multitude with hats in the air, gave loud bursts of exultation; and the spectacle was at that moment peculiarly grand and interesting. 
<p>The ceremony m the chapel was as follows :-- 
<p>After the <num value="1">first</num> lesson, Dr. Nares's <title lang=la>Te Deum</title> was sung; but a pause taking place immediately after  <QUOTE>We praise thee, O God,</QUOTE>  the military trophies were at that time silently introduced at the right and left doors, under escorts of grenadiers, with fixed bayonets, and borne by <num value="12">twelve</num> grenadiers of the guards, selected for their fine manly figures, who grounded them in front of the altar. The impression of the spectacle at this moment may more readily be conceived than described. But it was peculiarly interesting to contemplate its inspiring effect on the gazing soldiery, as principals in this national triumph. <title lang=la>Te Deum</title> was then sung through by the whole choir, to which the breast of every spectator seemed to heave in pious unison. This ended, the <num value="6">six</num> eagle standards were elevated against the <num value="2">two</num> semicircular divisions of the altar-piece, <num value="3">three</num> on each side, the butts about <num value="6">six</num> feet from the floor, and the upper parts sustained by double gilt chains of sufficient length to give them an uniform declension for their display. 
<p>The <num value="6">six</num> ordinary French colours were then ranged horizontally over the upper gallery. 
<p>A circumstance relating to <num value="1">one</num> of these standards ought not to be omitted here. The eagles in general are attached to the staves on which they are borne, by a screw; so that in case of imminent danger they may be taken off and concealed, to prevent their falling into the hands of an enemy. Napoleon, however, on presenting to his <num value="8">8th</num> regiment the eagle taken on the heights of Barrosa, observed, that it was impossible this standard should ever be taken by any foe from so fine a body of men, who had, on so many occasions, exhibited proofs of the most determined valour; for which reason he desired that the eagle might be rivetted to the staff. His desire was complied with; and, but for that order, this well-earned trophy would probably have escaped our still more valiant <num value="87">87th</num>, to whom this boasted corps was opposed.<NOTE><BIBL>Nightingale.

<p>When Whitehall was <num value="1">first</num> erected, it was little thought that James was constructing a passage from it for his son and successor to the scaffold. 
<p>The devout regicides, mad with political fury, and madder still with religious fanaticism, having brought their unfortunate king from St. James's palace to this place, his last abode, he was conducted across the park; and, having arrived, he was made to ascend the great stair-case, whence he passed through the long gallery to his bed-chamber. 
<p>On the day of his death he was conducted along the galleries <pb id="p.232" n="232"> and the Banquetting-house, through a passage broken on purpose in the wall, to the scaffold. 
<p>This passage still remains, at the north end of the room, and is at present a door to a small additional building in Scotland-yard. 
<p>Before we finally quit this place, some notice should be taken of the fine brazen statue of James II. erected by Grinlin Gibbons, in Scotland-yard. The attitude of this figure has been described as singularly fine, the manner free, and easy, the execution finished and perfect, and the expression in the face inimitable. 
<p>On the base is the following:

<p>Adjoining the Banquetting-house was formerly the Privy garden, the name of which is still retained, though built upon. Sir Christopher Wren was ordered by queen Anne, in <datestruct value="1705--"><year reg="1705">1705</year></datestruct>, to erect a wall, to enclose that part of the garden which contained a fountain, as a pleasure ground to the house inhabited by the Scotch commissioners appointed to settle the terms of the union of the <num value="2">two</num> kingdoms. 
<p>On the site of part of the Privy gardens was a large mansion belonging to the dukes of Richmond; this has been pulled down, and a handsome row of houses, called Richmond-terrace, erected. 
<p>At the north end of King-street, and corner of Downing-street, was a very handsome stone gate, erected by Henry VIII. in <datestruct value="1532--"><year reg="1532">1532</year></datestruct>, for a communication between the palace of Whitehall and St. James's park, by a passage over the same. This was taken down in <datestruct value="1723--"><year reg="1723">1723</year></datestruct> to facilitate the passage to and from St. Stephen's chapel and Westminster hall. There was another gate nearer Charing-cross, said to have been erected from the designs of Hans Holbein; it was long used as the state-paper office, and was taken down in <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>.

Mr. Pennant says,  <QUOTE><num value="1">one</num> was built of bricks of <num value="2">two</num> colours, glazed and disposed in a tesselated form</QUOTE>  There were also busts of Henry VII. and VIII. and Fisher, bishop of Rochester; which are still preserved on the front of <num value="1">one</num> of the keepers' lodges in Windsor park.<NOTE><BIBL>Smith's Westminster, <num value="23">23</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>

<p>It is of small extent, and is bounded by St. Margaret's parish on the north, the river on the east, and by St. George's parish on the south and west. Its bounds are as follows: commencing at Parliament-stairs, it proceeds to Abingdon-street, the east side of which is in this parish, along College-street, on the south side of Dean's yard, along Orchard-street, down New Pye-street, Old Pye-street, and Artillery-place: and thence in a south-westerly direction behind Rochester-row, across Vauxhall road, to the common sewer, which it keeps to the river Thames, where it enters opposite <num value="9">Nine</num> Elms.

<p>The church of St. John the Evangelist, which stands near the end of Millbank-street, is <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="52">fifty-two</num> new churches built soon after the time of sir Christopher Wren, and is the work of Mr. Archer, who has certainly shown no little skill or power of invention on this occasion. 
<p>This church owes its origin to the increased population of the parish of St. Margaret. It was begun in the year <datestruct value="1721"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>, and was consecrated on the <datestruct VALUE="1728-06-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1728">1728</year></datestruct>. The act of parliament,<NOTE><BIBL><num value="1">1</num> Geo. II. sess. <num value="2">2</num>. cap. <num value="15">15</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> passed for this purpose, states, the inhabitants, having previously marked certain boundaries, applied by petition to have this erected into a distinct parish. The act accordingly not only granted this, but likewise towards providing and settling a maintenance for the rector and his successors, granted the sum of <measure value="2500l." type=currency><num value="2500">two thousand five hundred</num> pounds</measure> to be laid out in the purchase of lands, tenements, &amp;c. in fee simple, for their use. 
<p>Over and above the profits that should arise from that purchase, it was enacted that the sum of <measure value="125l." type=currency><num value="125">one hundred and twenty-five</num> pounds</measure> as a farther provision for the rector and his successors; should be annually raised by an equal rate upon the inhabitants, to be assessed by the rector, churchwardens, and vestry, on every Easter Tuesday, or <num value="14">fourteen</num> days afterwards; and in case the rector, &amp;c. should refuse or neglect to make such assessment within the time appointed, he or they, so refusing or neglecting, to forfeit to the king the sum of <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">one hundred</num> pounds</measure> for every such offence. The assessment, when made, was ordered to be confirmed by <num value="2">two</num> justices of the peace in the city or liberty of Westminster; and the collectors to be chosen by the vestry; who, upon their refusing to act, are to forfeit to the king also the sum of <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">one hundred</num> pounds</measure>. <pb id="p.234" n="234"> 
<p>It was also enacted that, as by the division of St. Margaret's, the curate thereof and the chaplain of Tothill-fields chapel would become great sufferers, the rector of this parish, and his successors, are for ever to pay to the curate, otherwise so suffering, the sum of <measure value="17l. 8s. 11d." type=Currency><num value="17">seventeen</num> pounds <num value="8">eight</num> shillings and <num value="11">eleven</num>-pence</measure> per annum, by quarterly payments, without any deduction; and also to pay to the chaplain of Tothill-fields chapel annually the sum of <measure value="52l." type=currency><num value="52">fifty-two</num> pounds</measure> <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> shillings</measure>. 
<p>To this, as well as to all the other new churches, the <num value="1">first</num> presentation was in the king; and, in this instance, the advowson to belong for ever afterwards to the dean and chapter of Westminster. 
<p>To prevent this rectory from being held <foreign lang=la>in commendam</foreign>, all licenses and dispensations for holding the came are, by the same act of parliament, declared null and void. 
<p>While this church was building, the foundations gave way; and it sunk so much as to occasion a material alteration in the plan originally laid down for its construction; which may, perhaps, account for its present curious appearance. 
<p>This magnificent building differs from the general arrangement of ecclesiastical edifices. The plan is an oblong square, the <num value="2">two</num> narrowest ends of which are contracted by means of sweeps in the walls, forming quadrants of circles, and having porticoes flanked with <num value="4">four</num> square towers attached to--the other sides. The north and south sides of the edifice contain the entrances, being, contrary to usual practice, the principal fronts of the building; they are uniform with each other, and the description of <num value="1">one</num> will therefore suffice for both. The elevation commences, with a lofty double flight of steps leading to a winged portico of the Doric order, composed of <num value="5">five</num> divisions, the <num value="3">three</num> central ones being recessed, and comprising <num value="2">two</num> columns; the side divisions are marked by antae; in every division is an arched doorway, with a window of the same form above it; the whole is crowned with the entablature of the order, surmounted by a pediment broken above the centre of the front to let in an arch, flanked by pilasters of the Ionic order, and covered with a pediment, behind which the church also finished with a <num value="2">second</num> pediment; above the side divisions, the towers commence with square stylobates, which taking their rise from the raking cornice of the broken pediment forcibly add to the character of instability, for which the towers of this church are remarkable. 
<p>Above the stylobate the towers take a circular form, and are encircled by <num value="4">four</num> insulated columns rising from the angles of the square portion of the design; in the north and south elevations are arched windows with circular ones above them; in the other <num value="2">two</num> intercolumniations are parallelogrammatic openings flanked by pilasters, the whole is crowned with an entablature; the columns are of the Corinthian order, and the entablature over them is whimsically enough made to assume the circular form; by means <pb id="p.235" n="235"> of the latter the columns are united to the cella; the roof of each tower is covered with lead forming a bell shaped cupola; owing to the defective construction of the building, the whole is greatly out of order; the perpendicular is lost in some instances, and the columns defaced by being bound to each other, and to the walls of the building by bars of iron. The east and west fronts are uniform; the elevation commences with a stylobate in which are windows and entrances to the vaults; the superstructure is made into <num value="4">four</num> divisions by pilasters, and finished by the entablature, which is continued round the entire building; in the central division is a large arched window, and in the side ones smaller windows recently walled up in the east front. An attic is raised above the entablature of the order supported by trusses; in the centre is a niche between grouped antae, covered with a pediment; in each flank is a circular headed window of recent construction; the west end has no windows in the flanks, and those in the side divisions are still open; the sweeping walls which connect the <num value="4">four</num> fronts commence with a stylobate, and are finished with the continued entablature; in each are arched windows as before The church is now covered with an unsightly roof, which was substituted after the fire, for <num value="1">one</num> more appropriate to this splendid building, which before that unfortunate accident was perhaps the most magnificent church in the metropolis after the cathedral; the roof is now covered with slates. 
<p>The interior is approached by small porches within the principal porticoes; in its present state, it shews a large and handsome area unbroken by pillars or arches. The order is Corinthian, which is carried round the side walls in pilaster, surmounted by a rich entablature; the grand groups of columns, which formerly occupied the angles of the building, in the style of St. Mary, Woolnoth,<NOTE><BIBL>Vide vol. iii. page <num value="689">689</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> were destroyed by the fire; the small windows in the lateral divisions of the east and west fronts being designed to throw a light behind the columns and prevent the gloom which their great size might otherwise create. The ceiling is horizontal, pannelled into square compartments by flying cornices, the soffits enriched with guillochi; in the midst of the ceiling is a large circular panel with a magnificent boss in the centre; the soffites of the pannels are painted a cerulean blue; the ornamental portions stone color an oak gallery, sustained on insignificant Ionic columns, occupies the west end and the north and south sides; this gallery is not coeval with the church; in the western portion is the organ. 
<p>The chancel is a large recess, which has been only completed at the late repair, having been in an imperfect state ever since the fire; it now makes a splendid appearance, owing to the judicious ornaments which were at that time added to it. The east window is enclosed in an enriched architrave, copied from the architecture of the temple of Jupiter Stator, with the addition of a sweeping <pb id="p.236" n="236"> range of minute cherubic heads round the arch in imitation of statuary marble, and which were copied from a monument in St. Margaret's church; the new windows in the flanks have also architraves enriched with roses; the altar screen is composed of <num value="5">five</num> divisions: the central is occupied by a painting of <title>Christ bearing his Cross</title>
after <foreign lang=it>Carlo Dolci</foreign>; this is situated between <num value="2">two</num> Ionic columns, the shafts imitating Sienna marble; the other divisions are made by pilasters, and contain the usual inscriptions on pannels, in imitation of various marbles; above the central division was formerly a pediment interfering with the window; this has been altered to a light pedimental cornice enriched with honeysuckles. The arched ceiling has a gilt glory in the centre; the <num value="2">two</num> pilasters at the entrance of the chancel are painted to imitate Sienna marble, and the capitals, modillions, and other enrichments are gilt. 
<p>The pulpit and desks are situated in <num value="1">one</num> group in front of the altar rails. In the new pewing of the church at the last repair, free seats were constructed, but with a contemptible spirit of aristocratic pride, a line of bronze ornamental honeysuckles was constructed to distinguish the humble occupants of the new free seats from the more favourite tenants of the pews--a distinction inimical to the spirit of the Church of England--utterly at variance with Christian benevolence, and disgraceful to any building for religions purposes, in which the  <QUOTE>rich and the poor meet together,</QUOTE>  or ought to do so. 
<p>The font is situated in the north west angle of the church; it is a neat basin of veined marble on an octagonal pillar. In the central window of the chancel is a repetition of the subject of the altar-piece in stained glass between paintings of St. John and St. Paul, the remainder of the window being filled up with ornamental work;--this painted glass was presented to the church in <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>, by T. Green, esq. of Millbank-row. 
<p>The monuments are few, and none are of consequence. 
<p>In the vestry, which is a spacious apartment, is a painting of the ruins of the church after the interior was destroyed by fire in <datestruct value="1742--"><year reg="1742">1742</year></datestruct>. It was presented to the parish by G. Cross, esq.

<p>In Horseferry-road is the Gasometer and works belonging to the 
<div2 type=section id="c.4.2"><HEAD>Gas Light and Coke Company.</HEAD>
 
<p>This is the most extensive, and, perhaps, the very best establishment of the kind in the metropolis. 
<p>This company may be said to owe its origin to Frederick Albert Winsor, who made a public exhibition of the effect of gas, the evening of the king's birth-day in <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>, on the wall between the mall and the park. Mr. Winsor, however, has long ceased to have any concern with the establishment; and since he retired an act of parliament has been obtained, by which the company is become an incorporated body; and under the very able direction of Mr. Clegg, a scientific gentleman, of great information, who came from Manchester for that purpose, the works have been greatly improved, and the most busy and active part of the city of Westminster is already illuminated by the gas produced at the gasometer in Peter-street. The premises are very extensive, and the gasometers are protected from the weather by strong brick buildings. 
<p>The farthest extremity of the city of Westminster is at Mill-bank, a long row of houses, some of them very neat, extending along the south west bank of the Thames, and looking over to the county of Surrey, where the venerable palace of Lambeth presents itself as an object of great interest and importance in the annals and history of this country. 
<p>In the reign of queen Elizabeth, Milbank was a mere marshy tract. Here is situate a house called Peterborough-house, supposed to have been built by the <num value="1">first</num> earl of Peterborough, in whose family it continued till the year <datestruct value="1735"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>, when it was purchased by sir Robert Grosvenor, from whom it descended to earl Grosvenor, whose family rebuilt it in its present form. 
<p>At <num value="1">one</num> time the Horse-ferry was <num value="1">one</num> of the most frequented passages over the Thames. It is in contemplation to erect a chain bridge across the river from this spot on the principles laid down by captain Brown, R. N. the architect of the chain pier, Brighton, Hammersmith-bridge, &amp;c. 
<div2 type=section id="c.4.3"><HEAD>Penitentiary.</HEAD>
 
<p>After nearly half a century spent in deliberation, even when the necessity of the measure was acknowledged, a penitentiary, as-a substitute for transportation, was erected at an expense of more than <pb id="p.238" n="238"> half a million of money; and, after an experiment of <num value="7">seven</num> years, the mal&lsquo; aria of Millbank has defeated the views of the legislature, and the principal part of the prisoners have all been removed either to the ci-devant Ophthalmic Hospital, Regent's Park, or the hulks at Woolwich. 
<p>So early as the year <datestruct value="1779"><year reg="1779">1779</year></datestruct>, a plan was formed for a system of penitentiary imprisonment, calculated to reform offenders; and an act was drawn up under the direction of sir William Blackstone, with the advice and concurrence of Mr. Howard. In the preamble of this act (which passed the legislature), a conviction was expressed, that  <QUOTE>if many offenders convicted of crimes for which transportation has been usually inflicted, were ordered to solitary confinement, accompanied by well regulated labour and religions instruction, it might be the means, under Providence, not only of deterring others from the commission of the like crimes, but also of reforming the individuals and inuring them to habits of industry.</QUOTE>  
<p><num value="15">Fifteen</num> years after this declaratory statute had passed, it was followed by a new act of parliament for carrying the plan into effect, and a contract was entered into with Mr. Jeremy Bentham for that purpose; but so many difficulties arose in the mode of carrying this measure into execution, that the contract was re-purchased for the sum of <measure value="23578l." type=currency><num value="23578">23,578</num>l.</measure> and the plan abandoned until the year <datestruct value="1811"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, when a committee of the house of common recommended that it should be resumed. 
<p>Millbank was fixed upon as the site of the new Penitentiary, which was almost immediately commenced, under the direction of Mr. Harvey; and so rapidly was the work conducted, that in <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct> a part of the building was opened for the reception of convicts. The building is of a sexagonal form, and occupies a space of eighteen acres. In the centre are the apartments of the governor, whence he can have a complete view of the <num value="7">seven</num> distinct wards which surround him. The rooms for the prisoners are about <num value="12">twelve</num> feet by <num value="7">seven</num>, and are supplied with a bedstead and comfortable clothing; the prisoners are kept to hard labour, but are entitled to a per centage of their earnings, which is set apart as a fund for them on their discharge. 
<p>The Penitentiary was at <num value="1">first</num> only intended for <num value="400">400</num> male, and an equal number of female convicts; but it is capable of holding <datestruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></datestruct>: and it appears from a report of the select committee of the house of commons in <datestruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, that when the committee visited the prison, there were <num value="869">869</num> prisoners, of whom <num value="566">566</num> were males, and <num value="303">303</num> females. Of these <num value="101">101</num> had been sentenced to transportation for life, <num value="57">57</num> for <num value="14">fourteen</num>, and <num value="711">711</num> for seen years. The ratio in which the transportation is commuted for imprisonment in the Penitentiary is, that all those who have been capitally convicted are imprisoned for <num value="10">ten</num> years; those who are sentenced to <num value="14">fourteen</num> years transportation for <num value="7">seven</num>; and all <num value="7">seven</num> years' cases for <num value="5">five</num>. This commutation is disproportionate, but the smallest term was fixed conformably to an <pb id="p.239" n="239"> opinion expressed by Mr. Howard, that <num value="5">five</num> years should be the minimum of imprisonment on the Penitentiary system. 
<p>Although solitary confinement and hard labour may in some cases be an excellent mode of prison discipline, yet the experiment at the Millbank Penitentiary has not been a successful <num value="1">one</num>; and it is perhaps doubtful, how far a system which is calculated to excite feelings of despair and weariness of thought can be conducive to the reformation of the offenders; though it may insure a dreadful punishment. The motto which Dante gives for the gates of the Infernal Regions, might with little qualification be inscribed on the entrance of the Millbank Penitentiary. 
<p><QUOTE lang=it rend=center>Lussat&lsquo; ogni speranza, vio che &lsquo;ntrate.</QUOTE>
 
<p>An evil attending the Penitentiary at Millbank, though it does not apply to the system, is, that although the prisoners are employed in the manufacturing trades, yet, says the report,  <QUOTE>it is in evidence that the best class of work is not taught, and that those who are brought up as tailors, can hardly hope to gain their daily bread, at their discharge., That it may happen that persons, who have passed from <num value="5">five</num> to <num value="10">ten</num> years in the Penitentiary, may be discharged from it, without any means of gaining their subsistence, and may thus be exposed to temptations by which poverty and want are assailed, and which perhaps originally induced them to commit the crimes which had subjected them to punishment.</QUOTE>

<div1 type=chapter id="c.5" n="5"><HEAD>History and Topography of the parish of St. Martin's in the Fields, Westminster.</HEAD>
 
<p>This parish was formerly of great extent, and reached from Drury-lane to Hyde-park; the several parishes of St. George, St. James, St. Anne, and St. Paul, have been taken out of it. 
<p>This parish is bounded on the north by the parishes of St. George, Hanover-square; St. James, St. Anne, and St. George's Bloomsbury; on the east by St. Clement, Dane, and the precinct of the Savoy; on the south by St. Paul's, and St. Margaret's; and on the west by St. George, Hanover-square. 
<p>Its precise bounds are as follows:-- 
<p>Commencing at Whitehall stairs it pursues a westerly direction through the Horse Guards, across St. James's-park to Cumberland-gate, where it turns to the north across the court before the principal front of the palace, (which is in St. George's, Hanover-square) thence to Grosvenor-place, and on to Hyde-park corner; along Piccadilly to the east side of the Green-park where it turns to the south; thence through Cleveland-row, including the palace of St. James's, behind the houses on the south side of Pall Mall to Warwick-street, up the Haymarket, along Coventry-street, down Whitcomb-street, Spur-street, and across Leicester-square, from the south west corner to the north east corner, thence through Bear-street, along Castle-street, Newport-street and Upper St. Martin's lane, thence through Castle-street, (<num value="7">Seven</num> Dials) to Drury lane, where it takes a southerly direction to White-hart-yard, thence along Brydges-street, on the east side of Bow-street, and on the north side of Hart-street, at the western extent of which it takes a southerly direction to the south side of Chandos-street; here it again bends eastward to Southampton-street, and turns across the Strand, down Cecil-street, to the Thames. 
<div2 type=section id="c.5.1"><HEAD>St. Martin's Church.</HEAD>
 
<p>There was very early a church on this spot; for it appears that in <datestruct value="1225--"><year reg="1225">1225</year></datestruct> there was a dispute between the abbot of Westminster and the bishop of London, concerning the exemption of the church from the jurisdiction of the latter. It is not improbable that it. might at that time have been a chapel for the use of the monks, when they visited their convent-garden, which reached to the church. Be that as it may, the endowments fell with their possessions, and the living is at present in the gift of the bishop of London. During the reign of Henry VIII. the parish was so poor that the king built them a small church at his own expence; this structure lasted till the year <datestruct value="1607"><year reg="1607">1607</year></datestruct>, when the inhabitants having

<p>The architect of the present splendid building was James Gibbs, and great credit has ever been given him for the genius displayed in the structure. 
<p>The plan gives a parallellogram, with a portico at the west end: the east end divided into <num value="3">three</num> parts, forming a recess in the centre for the altar, with vestibules and other apartments in the side divisions. 
<p>The principal front consists of a magnificent portico, raised on a flight of steps, and composed of <num value="8">eight</num> columns of the Corinthian order, <num value="6">six</num> in front, and <num value="2">two</num> in flank. The columns sustain an entablature, which is received on pilasters at its entrance into the wall of the church; a lofty pediment crowns the whole, in the tympanum of which is the royal arms of George I. and on the apex a socle. The frieze bears the following inscription:

<p>The ceiling of the portico is richly pannelled by flying cornices, the soffits enriched with guillochi, and the pannels with expanded flowers. The cella is divided in height into <num value="2">two</num> stories by a string course; and the order, on pilasters, with its entablature, crowned with a ballustrade, is carried round the entire building. The west front extends in breadth beyond the returns of the portico, forming <num value="2">two</num> small wings, in which the face of the wall is relieved by pannels; the part immediately behind the portico is made into <num value="5">five</num> divisions; in the centre is a circular-headed doorway in the lower story, the archivolt rusticated; and an arched window, also rusticated, in the upper: the <num value="2">two</num> extreme divisions have also doorways lintelled and covered with pediments and windows as before, the remaining divisions being pannelled. The tower and spire rise from the body of the church, immediately behind the centre of the portico. The elevation is made into <num value="2">two</num> principal divisions, a tower and spire. The <num value="1">first</num> is square in plan, and is composed of a lofty pedestal, with a circular window in each face. The story which succeeds to it has in each front of the elevation a window, arched and rusticated, between Ionic pilasters, disposed in pairs, and surmounted by their entablature, having vases at the angles of the design. The succeeding story takes an octangular form; it <pb id="p.243" n="243"> commences with a stylobate forming the base of the spire, every face of which is broken by a circular dial, over which the cornice rises in a sweep. The succeeding story has an arched window in every face of the octagon, and at the angles are engaged columns of the Corinthian order, also crowned with their entablature, and surmounted by vases; upon this story, a <num value="2">second</num> stylobate, still keeping the octagonal plan, forms the base of a lofty obelisk, relieved with pannelling, and pierced with circular openings at intervals: the whole crowned with a ball and vane. 
<p>The flanks are uniform, and are made into <num value="7">seven</num> divisions, the elevation resting on a plain socle; the <num value="2">two</num> extreme divisions are recessed, and occupied by pairs of columns, between which are lintelled entrances in the lower story, rusticated and covered with pediments, and approached by flights of steps. In the lower story of the other divisions are low segment arched windows, with rusticated architravaves; and in the upper stories are windows in every division, corresponding with those in the west front. The east front is made into fine divisions of unequal widths; the central is occupied by a Venetian window, the order Ionic; the <num value="2">two</num> succeeding divisions have windows in each story, as before, and the remaining ones are pannelled. A pediment rises above the <num value="3">three</num> intermediate divisions in the tympanum: a circular window, formed in a shield between <num value="2">two</num> palm branches; in this, as well as the western pediment, the raking cornice has modillions as well as the horizontal <num value="1">one</num>. The roof of the church is covered with lead, and is continued from the west to the east pediment, only broken by the tower; it increased in breadth by leantos over the divisions collateral to the portico, forming <num value="1">one</num> inclined plane on each side the ridge. 
<p>The interior is approached by <num value="3">three</num> vestibules, <num value="1">one</num> of which occupies the basement of the tower, the others being collateral thereto, and which contain stairs to the galleries. The body of the church is made into a nave and side aisles by <num value="4">four</num> Corinthian columns on each side; they are raised on plinths, the height of the pews, and surmounted by their entablature. From the cornice springs the arched ceiling; the portion above the nave is a semielliptical vault,<NOTE> <QUOTE>An elliptical ceiling,</QUOTE>  says Mr. Gibbs.  <QUOTE>I find by experience to be much better for the voice than the semicircular, though not so beautiful.</QUOTE> </NOTE> made in length into divisions corresponding with the intercolumniations, by arched ribs, whose impost is the same cornice, and again by horizontal ribs into pannels, the entire soffits of which are occupied by the most splendid assemblage of wreaths, cherubs' heads, escallops, and other ornamental devices, perhaps ever witnessed, the work of Signiori Artari and Bagutti, the best fret workers that ever came to England. The vault is pierced laterally with <num value="5">five</num> arches on each side, springing likewise from the cornice above the columns; other arches corresponding with the last are turned over the aisles, and received on consoles attached to the <pb id="p.244" n="244"> side wall; in the spandrils of these conjoined arches are pendentives, sustaining circular compartments coved, and resembling small domes. The altar stands in a spacious recess; the flanks are made by pilasters into <num value="2">two</num> divisions, crowned with an entablature. The <num value="1">first</num> division in plan is the quadrant of a circle, and has an arched doorway, with a window above, fronted by a ballustrade, and above the cornice is a balcony. The <num value="2">second</num> division is entirely occupied by the altar; it has also a window and ballustrade in the upper story: these windows on <num value="1">one</num> side light the royal pew, and on the south that which is appropriated for the royal household for their accommodation in attending to qualify under the repealed Test act. 
<p>The ceiling is a semi-elliptic vault, richly pannelled, in <num value="2">two</num> divisions; in the <num value="1">first</num> are the royal arms in the centre; the other has cherubic heads, in clouds, holding wreaths of foliage. The altar screen occupies the dado of the east window, and has been most unaccountably neglected; it is ornamented as a stylobate, and is broken by the pedestals to the Ionic columns of the window, on which account it has a subordinate and mean appearance; the decalogue, creed, and paternoster occupy pannels on the end and flank walls. At the west end is a gallery with oak front, pannelled, sustained on <num value="2">two</num> Doric columns of the same material; a continuation of this gallery extends the whole length of the side aisles, the front very properly retiring behind the line of the columns. A <num value="2">second</num> gallery is raised above the <num value="1">first</num>, at the west end; it is sustained on <num value="2">two</num> oaken Ionic columns, and contains the organ. On the front of this gallery is written in letters of gold: 
<QUOTE rend=center>THE GIFT OF HIS MOST SACRED MAJESTY, KING GEORGE, <datestruct value="1726--"><year reg="1726">1726</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The pulpit and desks are grouped on the north side of the nave. The former is hexagonal, resting on a single pillar; it has a sounding-board and canopy of the same form. 
<p>The font, situated in a pew in the north aisle, near the west entrance, is a plain circular basin of white marble, on a pedestal.

<p>There are no monuments in this church. 
<p>It was lamentable to see this fine edifice, confessedly the most splendid church in the metropolis after the cathedral, hid in a narrow lane, and hemmed round with the meanest dwelling houses. The defect has been deplored by all architectural critics, and more especially by Ralph; whose remarks on this church are so apposite as to deserve insertion entire: 
<p> <QUOTE>With respect to this noble edifice,</QUOTE>  says he,  <QUOTE>I could wish that a view was opened from the Mews to St. Martin's church; I do not know any of the modern buildings about town which deserves such an advantage. The portico is at once elegant and august; and if the steps arising from the street to the front could have been made regular, and on a line from end to end, it would have given it a very considerable grace: but, as the situation of the ground would not allow it, this is to be esteemed a misfortune rather than a fault. The round columns at each angle of the church are well contrived, and have a very fine effect in the profile of the building. The east end is remarkably elegant, and very justly claims a particular applause. In short, if there is any thing wanting in this fabric, it is a little more elevation; which, I presume, is apparently wanted within, and would create an additional beauty without. I cannot help thinking, too, that in complaisance to the galleries, the architect has reversed the order of the windows; it being always usual to have the large ones near the eye, and the small, by way of attic, on the top.</QUOTE>  The wish of Mr. Ralph, as well as of every judicious observer, to open the front view of the church, is at present in a state of progress; the mean houses which hid the north side are destroyed, and an opening made into the Mews; in consequence, this magnificent church is redeemed from the disgraceful state in which it has stood, from the days of Gibbs to the reign of his present majesty. 
<p>Vast vaults extend from the portico to the east end of the structure, which are light and dry, and contain great numbers of bodies, deposited within separate apartments, and on the floor of the open space. 
<p>The vestry-room, detached from the south-east corner of the church, contains a fine model of this structure, admirably executed. In a recess is a half-length of George I. and over the door a bust of Richard Miller, esq. who gave <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">500</num>l.</measure> to the 

<pb id="p.246" n="246">
 charity-schools; <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">300</num>l.</measure> to the library, and free-school; and <measure value="800l." type=currency><num value="800">800</num>l.</measure> towards building the vestry-house. In a south window is a pretty painting of St. Martin, dividing his mantle with a beggar. The walls are adorned with half-lengths of the vicars, from the year <datestruct value="1670"><year reg="1670">1670</year></datestruct>, almost all of whom attained high distinction in the church. In the waiting-room are portraits of the architect, Mr. Gibbs, and the unfortunate sir Edmondbury Godfrey. 

<p>Mr. Malcolm records the following singular event which occurred in this church. On the <datestruct VALUE="1729-09-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1729">1729</year></datestruct>, during evening prayers, a gentleman abruptly entered and fired <num value="2">two</num> pistol at the rev. Mr. Taylor, who was repeating the service: <num value="1">one</num> of the bullets grazed the surplice, but the other entered the body of Mr. Williams, farrier, of Bedfordbury, who was sitting in a pew near the minister. The congregation fled in alarm from the church, but a sturdy carman resolutely proceeded to secure the offender, which he could not effect without a severe encounter, and much-bruising him, particularly on the head. On his examination, it was found that this man, named Roger Campaznol, was the son of the governor of Brest, in France, that having been cheated by his landlord, a Hugonot, resident near the <num value="7">Seven</num> Dials, of <measure value="138l." type=currency><num value="138">138</num>l.</measure> his mind became deranged, so that he had not sufficient discrimination to distinguish the victim of his revenge. After his commitment to Newgate he endeavoured to hang himself with his garters in the chapel; but being prevented, he fastened himself into his cell; and when the door was forced open, he was found eating part of a bottle pounded into fragments with bread. Of the subsequent fate of this lunatic we have no information.

<p>At the bottom of St. Martin's-lane on the south side of the Strand is the noble and extensive mansion 
<div2 type=section id="c.5.2"><HEAD>Northumberland House.</HEAD>
<p><FIGURE id="Fig.246.1"><HEAD>Houses of the Nobility in the Strand: Suffolk House</HEAD></FIGURE> 
<p>On the site of part of this magnificent house, stood the hospital of St. Mary, a cell to the priory of Rounceval, in Navarre. This hospital was founded by William Marischal, earl of Pembroke, in the reign of Henry III. and confirmed by that monarch. According to Speed, it was suppressed by Henry V. as an alien priory but re-edified by Edward IV. After the general suppression, it was given by Edward VI. to sir Thomas Cawarden, to be held in free soccage of the honour of Westminster. 
<p>It then came to Henry Howard, earl of Northampton, out of the ruins of which he built a mansion, which he denominated Northampton-house, and died there in <datestruct value="1694--"><year reg="1694">1694</year></datestruct>. He left it to his kinsman, the earl of Suffolk; and by marriage of Algernon Percy, earl of Northumberland, with Elizabeth, daughter of Theophilus, earl of Suffolk,<NOTE>The house at the above period is engraved in the annexed plate, from a drawing by Hollar, in the Pepysian library, Cambridge.</NOTE> it passed into her family about the year <datestruct value="1642"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct>, and has ever since been distinguished by its present name. <pb id="p.247" n="247"> 
<p>Of this ancient house Bernard Jansen was the architect; the mansion originally consisted of <num value="3">three</num> sides of a quadrangle, and the principal apartments were in the upper story, next the Strand; but the noise and hurry of so great a thoroughfare, being unpleasant to the last mentioned earl, he caused a <num value="4">fourth</num> side to be erected, under the direction of Inigo Jones; which, commanding a view over a spacious garden, and the river to the Surrey hills, unites the advantages of a palace, situated in the midst of a large and populous city, with the retirement of a country seat. The grandfather of the present duke made considerable additions and improvements. He built <num value="2">two</num> new wings to the garden front, above <num value="100">one hundred</num> feet in length; faced the sides of the quadrangular court with stone, and nearly rebuilt the whole of the front next the street, about the year <datestruct value="1752"><year reg="1752">1752</year></datestruct>. The central part, which, in a tablet on the top, bears the date when these improvements were made, only received some trifling alteration, and may be considered as a valuable remnant of the original pile, and of the magnificence of our forefathers. On the top is a lion passant, the crest of the noble family of Percy, cast in lead. 
<p>The vestibule of the interior is <num value="82">eighty-two</num> feet long, and more than <num value="12">twelve</num> in breadth, ornamented with Doric columns. Each end communicates with a staircase, leading to the principal apartments facing the garden and the Thames. They consist of several spacious rooms, fitted up in the most elegant manner, embellished with paintings, by Titian, particularly the Cornaro family, as well as the works of other great masters. The state gallery, in the left wing, is <num value="16">one hundred and six</num> feet long, most beautifully ornamented. 
<p>The light is admitted through windows in the side, above which is another row, which throws a proper quantity of light over the exquisitely worked cornice, so that the whole apartment receives an equal degree. This hall abounds with paintings, chiefly from the greatest masters. 
<p>Besides the apartments already mentioned, there are nearly <num value="160">160</num> rooms appropriated for the private uses of the family. 
<p>The south flank of this mansion being left, in some measure, in its pristine form, gives the style of the reign of Henry VIII. in brick walls, lofty windows, both pointed and flat-headed (now stopped up) with stone dressings. The north, or street front, was evidently constructed in the reign of Edward VI. in the new mode; yet, by the several repairs and alterations it has undergone at later periods, the whole line may appear to be some modern work of no very great distance of time from the present day. 
<p>About <num value="20">20</num> years back, a very general repair of the front took place, in new pointing and facing the brick-work, re-cutting the stone ornaments, &amp;c. by the Adams's, (it is believed) architects; and the exterior and interior have very recently been repaired and beautified. Among the alterations of the interior may be noticed a 
<pb id="p.248" n="248">
 magnificent staircase, the railing of highly wrought brass superbly gilt, and the formation of some new apartments, &amp;c. 
<p>Nearer to Charing-cross was an ancient hermitage, which, in <datestruct value="1261--"><year reg="1261">1261</year></datestruct>, is said to have belonged to the see of Llandaff; for Willis, in his history of that see, informs us,  <QUOTE> that William de Radnor, then bishop, had leave from the king to lodge in the cloister of his hermitage of Charing, whenever he came to London.</QUOTE>  Though this should rather imply that the hermitage belonged to the king, and that the king granted the lodging as an indulgence. 
<p>Attached to it was a chapel dedicated to St. Catharine. A few surrounding houses constituted the hamlet of Charing, where Edward I. built a beautiful wooden cross, from respect to his beloved queen Eleanor; it was afterwards constructed of stone, and appears to have been of an octagonal form, and in an upper stage, ornamented with <num value="8">eight</num> figures; a sketch appears of it in Agass's map. Dr. Combe, of Bloomsbury-square, possessed a drawing of it; in which is shewn that the ornamental parts were very rich in their execution.<NOTE>Engraved in the annexed plate from the original, now in the Print-room of the British Museum.<FIGURE id="Fig.248"><HEAD>Plan of the Village of Charing, By Ralph Aggas, <datestruct value="1560--"><year reg="1560">1560</year></datestruct></HEAD></FIGURE></NOTE>
 
<p>In <datestruct value="1648--"><year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct>, this cross was pulled down along with many other memorials of the art and taste of our ancestors, which were levelled by the intemperate fury of the bigotted puritans. 
<p>In the next century it was replaced by a most beautiful and animated equestrian statue, in brass, of Charles I. cast in <datestruct value="1633--"><year reg="1633">1633</year></datestruct>, by Le Soeur, for the great earl of Arundel. It was not erected (in its present state) till the year <datestruct value="1671"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>, when it was placed on the pedestal, the work of Grinlin Gibbons. The parliament had ordered it to be sold, and broke to pieces: but John River, a brazier, who purchased it, having more taste or more loyalty than his masters, buried it unmutilated, and shewed to them some broken pieces of brass in token of his obedience. M. D&lsquo;Archenoltz gives a diverting anecdote of this brazier: that he cast a vast number of handles of knives and forks in brass, which he sold as made of the broken statue. They were bought with great eagerness by the loyalists from affection to their monarch: by the rebels, as a mark of triumph over the murdered sovereign.<NOTE><BIBL>Pennant.</BIBL></NOTE> Charles is most admirably represented in armour, with his own hair, uncovered, on horseback. The figures are brass, looking towards Whitehall, and are as large as life. The pedestal is <num value="17">seventeen</num> feet high, enriched with his majesty's arms, trophies, cupids, palm-branches, &amp;c. and enclosed with a rail and banister of strong iron work. The pedestal is erected in the centre of a circle of stone, <num value="30">thirty</num> feet in diameter, the area whereof is <num value="1">one</num> step above that of the street, fenced with strong posts to keep off coaches, carts, &amp;c. 
<p>Scotland-yard was anciently a palace for the kings of Scotland, given by king Edgar to Kenneth III. for the purpose of making an <pb id="p.249" n="249"> annual journey to this place to do homage for his kingdom; and in later times, when the northern monarch did homage for Cumberland, and other fiefs of the crown, it became the magnificent residence of Margaret, widow to James V. and sister to Henry VIII. of England resided here for a considerable time subsequent to the death of her consort: she was also entertained with great splendour by her brother, after he became reconciled to her marriage to the earl of Angus. When the <num value="2">two</num> crowns became united in the person of James I. of England, this palace was deserted for the more extensive residence of St. James's and Whitehall, and having been demolished, no traces of it are left, except the name. 
<p>Opposite Scotland-yard, is 
<div2 type=section id="c.5.3"><HEAD>The Admiralty.</HEAD>
 
<p>The present extensive edifice was erected in the reign of George II. from the designs of Ripley, on the site of Wallingford house, a fine mansion built by William lord Knollys, viscount Wallingford, and earl of Banbury, in the <num value="2">second</num> year of the reign of Charles I. From the roof of this building it was that the pious archbishop Usher was prevailed upon to take his last sight of his beloved master when brought up to the scaffold before Whitehall. He sunk with horror at the sight, and was carried in a swoon to his apartment. This house in the reign of William III. was appointed for the admiralty office, which had been removed from Duke-street, Westminster. The present edifice is very extensive. The front facing the street has <num value="2">two</num> deep wings, and in the centre is a portico formed of <num value="4">four</num> lofty columns of the Ionic order; these support a pediment, within which are the admiralty arms. The interior is very convenient, and comprises a large hall and numerous offices appropriated to transacting maritime concerns. 
<p>The screen before the court has been much admired; it consists of a piazza of the Doric order supporting its entablature and enriched with marine ornaments. 
<p>On the top of the building is a semaphore for the quick conveyance of intelligence from the coast. 
<p>The jurisdiction of this office is very extensive; it controuls the whole navy of the united kingdom; nominates admirals, captains, and other officers, to serve on board his majesty's ships of war, and gives orders for courts martial on such as have neglected their duty, or been guilty of any irregularities. 
<p>Returning towards the Strand, in Craven-street, is a house No. <num value="7">7</num>, remarkable for having been the residence of the celebrated Dr. Benjamin Franklin, and at present as the place of meeting for  <QUOTE>The Society for the Relief of Persons Imprisoned for Small Debts.</QUOTE> -- This society rose through the endeavours of the Rev. Dr. Dodd, in <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>; and within <num value="15">fifteen</num> months from the commencement of the plan, they were enabled to discharge <num value="986">986</num> persons, many of whom <pb id="p.250" n="250"> were confined only for their fees! To these belonged <num value="566">five hundred sixty-six</num> wives, and <num value="2389">two thousand three hundred and eighty-nine</num> children, making in all <num value="3941">three thousand nine hundred and forty-one</num> souls, essentially relieved by this mode of humanity. It is impossible now to ascertain the number of persons whom this institution has rescued from misery and wretchedness. 
<p>The objects of this charity are those, whether men or women, who are actually imprisoned, whose debts, or the composition for them, do not exceed <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure>; those have the preference who are infirm, or have large families. 
<p>Hungerford Market takes its name from the family of the same name, of Farleigh, in the county of Wilts. Sir Edward Hungerford was created knight of the Bath, at the coronation of Charles II. and had a large mansion here, which he converted into tenements, and a market: over the market-house was a large room called  <QUOTE>The French church,</QUOTE>  which was afterwards the charity-school for St. Martin's in the Fields, but is at present in a state of dilapidation. On the north side of the building is a neglected bust of Charles II. 
<p>On the site of several streets eastward of Hungerford-market, was

 so called from having been the residence of the archbishops of York. It had been anciently the bishop of Norwich's inn; but was exchanged in <datestruct value="1535--"><year reg="1535">1535</year></datestruct>, in the reign of Henry VIII. for the abbey of St. Bennet Holme, in Norfolk. The next possessor, Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, had it in exchange for his house called Southwark place. In the reign of queen Mary it was purchased by Dr. Heath, archbishop of York, and called York-house. Archbishop Matthew, in the reign of James I. exchanged it with the crown, and had several manors in lieu of it. It was the residence of lords chancellors Egerton and Bacon; after which it was granted to George Villiers, duke of Buckingham, who rebuilt it most magnificently. In <datestruct value="1648--"><year reg="1648">1648</year></datestruct>, the parliament bestowed it on general Fairfax, whose daughter and heir marrying George Villiers, the <num value="2">second</num> duke of Buckingham, the house reverted to its true owner, who resided here for several years subsequent to the Restoration, It was disposed of by him, and several streets laid out on the site, which go under his names and titles:  <QUOTE><hi rend=italics>George</hi>-street, <hi rend=italics>Villiers</hi>-street, <hi rend=italics>Duke</hi>-street,

<p>York Buildings Water Works, was an edifice with a high wooden tower, erected for raising Thames water, for the supply of the Strand and its neighbourhood. The works are under the superintendance of a company, incorporated by an act of parliament in the year <datestruct value="1691"><year reg="1691">1691</year></datestruct>. The site of the water-works, which were at the bottom of Buckingham-street, is now occupied as a coal-wharf. In former times the banks of the Thames, from Whitehall to Somerset-house, were ornamented with numerous palaces of the nobility, many consisting of <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="3">three</num> courts, and fitted up in the most sumptuous manner. In the time of Edward VI. elegant gardens, protected by lofty walls, embellished the margin of our great river, from Privy-bridge to Baynard's-hall. These gardens appended to the sumptuous buildings of the Savoy, and York, Paget, and Arundel places. Each intervening spot was still guarded by a wall, and frequently laid out in decorative walks, a most pleasing contrast to the present state of the same district. On the Strand side of the original Somerset Place, the lapse of <num value="2">two</num> centuries has Worked wonders in improvement. There was no continued street here till about the year <datestruct value="1553"><year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>. The side next the Thames then consisted entirely of distinct mansions, skreened from the vulgar eye by cheerless extensions of massive brick wall. The north side was formed by a thin row of detached houses, each of which possessed a garden; and all beyond was country. St. Giles's was a distant Country hamlet. 
<p>Opposite to Chester Inn stood an ancient cross. On this cross, in the year <datestruct value="1294"><year reg="1294">1294</year></datestruct>, the judges sat to administer justice, without the city. In the reign of Edward III. the Strand was an open highway. A solitary-house occasionally occurred; but in <datestruct value="1353--"><year reg="1353">1353</year></datestruct>, the ruggedness of the highway was such, that Edward appointed a tax on wool, leather, &amp;c. to its improvement. 
<p>The Strand, from Charing-cross to Chester-cross, was so ruinous in the reign of Henry VIII. that an act was made for its repair. <pb id="p.252" n="252"> 
<p>At the commencement of the last century, the Strand was lighted only by lanthorns, hung gratuitously by the inhabitants, without resemblance of parochial uniformity. Ignorant of the advantages of regular pavement, both road and footpath boasted, in their improved day, only the pointed misery of fortuitous flints. Indeed the Strand, in Edward the VIth&lsquo;s time, does not appear to have been a thoroughfare of great resort: at any rate, barrows, and broad wheeled carts were the only carriages of passage. Access to the court, whether held at the Tower, Whitehall, or Westminster, was most readily found by means of the Thames. Modern elegance has discovered a more refined (but not more eligible), method of approaching St. James's. 
<p>Nearly opposite Southampton-street, is Cecil-street. Here stood 
<div2 type=section id="c.5.4"><HEAD>Salisbury House</HEAD>
 
<p>Salisbury House, built by Sir Robert Cecil, <num value="1">first</num> earl of Salisbury, and lord treasurer to James I., who, to make it commodious for passengers, caused the high street of the Strand to be paved and levelled before the premises. This house was afterwards divided, and went by <num value="2">two</num> names; that called Great Salisbury House, was the particular residence of the earl and his family; the other, called Little Salisbury House, though large in itself, was let out to persons of quality; but a part of the latter being afterwards contracted for, of the then earl of Salisbury, was converted into Salisbury-street, which being too narrow, and the descent to the Thames being dangerous, it was very indifferently inhabited. Another part, next Great Salisbury House, and over the long gallery, was converted into an exchange, and called the Middle Exchange, consisting of a very large and long room, with shops on each side, which, from the Strand, extended as far as the river, where was a handsome flight of stairs for the purpose of hiring boats. By some unlucky chance, however, the exchange obtained the name of  <QUOTE>The Whore's Nest,</QUOTE>  consequently the shops were deserted, and the whole went to decay. The estate reverting to to the late earl, he took the whole down, and on the site formed Cecil-street. 
<p>Mr. Moser, in his  <QUOTE>Vestiges,</QUOTE>  thinks that Salisbury House had been of very ancient origin, from the following circumstances: among the large possessions granted to Walter d&lsquo;Evereux, earl of Rosmar, in Normandy, the estates belonging to the family in Wiltshire, were, perhaps, the principal; but this favourite had grants in other places, which descended to his son, Edward, surnamed of Salisbury, and probably became attached to the title, of which this mansion, long distinguished by the epithet of Salisbury House, might form a part. It is here unnecessary to trace this unfortunate and royal line. Margaret, the last of this dynasty, was most barbarously massacred on the scaffold, <datestruct value="1541--"><year reg="1541">1541</year></datestruct>. The title then lay dormant until <datestruct value="1605--"><year reg="1605">1605</year></datestruct>, when James dignified with it Robert Cecil, <num value="2">second</num> son of that great <pb id="p.253" n="253"> statesman, sir William Cecil, lord Burleigh, who, for his prudence and sagacity, bad obtained <num value="1">one</num> equally honourable, being called the English Nestor. The ancient mansion was very extensive and apparently consisted of a quadrangle with octagonal turrets at the corners. A view of it from a drawing by Hollar in the Pepysian library, Cambridge, is engraved in this work.<FIGURE id="Fig.253"><HEAD>Houses of the Nobility in the Strand: Salisbury House</HEAD></FIGURE><NOTE><BIBL>Vide ante, page <num value="246">246</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The liberty of the duchy of Lancaster ends at the east side of this street. Salisbury-street has been rebuilt from an elegant plan of Mr. Paine; and is at present a convenient and well-inhabited place, terminated by a circular railing to the Thames. 
<div2 type=section id="c.5.5"><HEAD>Durham House.</HEAD>
 
<p>Antony de Bec, bishop of that see in the reign of Edward I. built the town residence of him and his successors, called Durham place, in the Strand, where, in <datestruct value="1540--"><year reg="1540">1540</year></datestruct>, was held a most magnificent feast, given by the challengers of England, who had caused to be proclaimed in France, Flanders, Scotland, and Spain. a great and triumphant jousting, to be holden at Westminster, for all comers that would undertake them, but both challengers and defendants were English. After the gallant exploits of each day, the challengers rode to Durham house, where they kept open household, and feasted the king and queen, (Anne of Cleves,) with her ladies, and all the court, and also the knights and burgesses of the house of commons; and entertained the mayor of London, with all the aldermen, and their wives, at a dinner, &amp;c. The king gave to each of the challengers, and his heirs for ever, in reward of his valour and activity, <measure value="100bmark" type=currency><num value="100">one hundred</num> marks</measure>, and a house to dwell in of yearly revenue, out of the lands pertaining to the hospital of St. John of Jerusalem. The palace had previously been exchanged to king Henry VIII.: and it was afterwards granted by Edward VI. to his sister, princess Elizabeth, as her residence during her life; Mary I. however, who probably considered the gift as sacrilegious, granted it again in reversion to the bishop of Durham. 
<p>In the reign of Edward VI. the mint was established in this house, under the management of sir William Sharrington, and the influence of the aspiring Thomas Seymour, lord admiral. Here he proposed to have money enough coined to accomplish his designs on the throne. His practices were detected; and he suffered death. His tool was also condemned; but, sacrificing his master to his own safety, he received a pardon, and was again employed under the administration of John Dudley, earl of.Northumberland. It afterwards became the residence of that ambitious man; who, in <datestruct VALUE="153-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="153">153</year></datestruct>, in this palace, caused to be solemnized, with great magnificence, <num value="3">three</num> marriages: his son, lord Guildford Dudley, with the amiable Jane Gray; lord Herbert, heir to the earl of Pembroke, with Catherine, the youngest sister of lady Jane, and <pb id="p.254" n="254"> lord Hastings, heir to the earl of Huntingdon, with his youngest daughter, lady Dudley. Hence also he dragged the reluctant victim, his daughter in law, the lady Jane Gray, to the Tower, to be invested with regal dignity. <QUOTE>In <num value="8">eight</num> short months his ambition led the sweet innocent to the nuptial bed, the throne, and the scaffold.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Pennant.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>Durham house was reckoned <num value="1">one</num> of the royal palaces belonging to queen Elizabeth, who gave the use of it to the great sir Walter Raleigh. In the reign of Charles I. the premises came into the possession of Philip, earl of Pembroke and Montgomery, upon payment of <measure value="200l." type=currency><num value="200">200</num>l.</measure> per annum to the see of Durham. His son took down the whole, and formed it into tenements and avenues, as it continued till totally demolished to make room for the Adelphi. Part of the stables was covered by the New Exchange, which was built under the auspices of James I. in <datestruct value="1608--"><year reg="1608">1608</year></datestruct>. The king, queen, and royal family honoured the opening with their presence, and named it Britain's Burse. It was built on the model of the royal exchange, with cellars, a walk, and a row of shops, filled with milliners, sempstresses, and those of similar occupations; and was a place of fashionable resort. What, however, was intended to rival the royal exchange dwindled into frivolity and ruin, and the site is at present occupied by a range of handsome houses facing the Strand.<NOTE>A view of this noble mansion is engraved in the plate before noticed, <BIBL>vide ante p. <num value="246">246</num>.</BIBL><FIGURE id="Fig.254"><HEAD>Houses of the Nobility in the Strand: Durham House</HEAD></FIGURE></NOTE>
 
<div2 type=section id="c.5.6"><HEAD>The Adelphi.</HEAD>
 
<p>The estate of Durham Yard having become an unprofitable heap of ruins, was purchased by Messrs. Adams, <num value="4">four</num> brothers, by whose labours Great Britain had been embellished with edifices of distinguished excellence.  <QUOTE>To their researches among the vestiges of antiquity,</QUOTE>  says Mr. Malton,  <QUOTE>we are indebted for many improvements in ornamental architecture; and for a style of decoration unrivalled for elegance and gaiety, which, in spite of the innovations of fashion, will prevail so long as good taste prevails in the nation.</QUOTE>  
<p>The building of the Adelphi was project of such magnitude, and attracted so much attention, that it must have been a period of peculiar importance in the lives of these architects. In this work they displayed to the public eye that practical knowledge and skill, and that ingenuity and taste, which till then had been in a great measure confined to private edifices, and known only by the voice of fame to the majority of those who feel an interest in the art of building. The extreme depth of the foundations, the massy piers of brick work, and the spacious subterraneous vaults and arcades, excited the wonder of the ignorant, and the applause of the skilful; while the regularity of the streets in the superstructure, <pb id="p.255" n="255"> and the elegance and novelty of the decorations, equally delighted and astonished all descriptions of people. 
<p> <QUOTE> This judgment of the Messrs. Adams, in the management of their plans, and their care in conducting the executive part, deserves great praise; and it must be mentioned to their honour, that no accident happened in the progress of the work, nor has any failure been since observed; an instance of good fortune which few architects have experienced when struggling with similar difficulties. This remark will make very little impression on the careless observer who rattles along the streets in his carriage, unconscious that below him are the streets, in which carts and drays, and other vehicles of business, are constantly employed in conveying coals, and various kinds of merchandize, from the river to the consumer, or to the warehouses and avenues inaccessible to the light of day: but he who will take the trouble to explore these depths will feel its force; and when he perceives that all the buildings which compose the Adelphi, are in front but <num value="1">one</num> building, and that the upper streets are no more than open passages, connecting the different parts of the superstructure, he will acknowledge that the architects are entitled to more than common praise.</QUOTE>  
<p>The front of the Adelphi, towards the river, on account of its extent, becomes <num value="1">one</num> of the most distinguishing objects between the bridges of Westminster and Waterloo, from each of which it is of nearly equal distance. On viewing the pile from the river, every <num value="1">one</num> must regret the necessity of those paltry erections on the wharfs in front of the arcade, which deface the whole building, by the smoke arising from them. The wharfs are very spacious; and it would certainly add greatly to the beauty of the river, as well as to the conveniency of its commerce, if the plan was adopted the whole of the way between the bridges of London and Westminster. 
<p> <QUOTE>The terrace is happily situated in the heart of the metropolis, upon a bend of the river, which presents to the right and left every eminent object which characterises and adorns the cities of London and Westminster; while its elevation lifts the eye above the wharfs and warehouses on the opposite side of the river, and charms it with a prospect of the adjacent country. Each of these views is so grand, so rich, and so various, that it is difficult to determine which deserves the preference.</QUOTE>  <num value="1">One</num> of the centre houses on the terrace was purchased by David Garrick, esq. 
<p> <QUOTE>The manner of decorating the fronts of the shops and houses in Adam-street, is equally singular and beautiful. It may be proper here to remark, what some future writer may dwell on with pleasure, that in the streets of the Adelphi, the brothers have contrived to represent their respective Christian names, as well as their family name; while by giving the general appellation of The Adelphi to this assemblage of streets and buildings, they have converted the whole into a lasting memorial of their friendship and fraternal co-operation.</QUOTE>  <pb id="p.256" n="256"> 
<p>In John-street is the building designed and executed for he society for the encouragement of arts, manufactures, and commerce. This building alone demonstrates that the Messrs. Adams wire completely sensible of the beauty and. grandeur resulting from simplicity of composition and boldness of projection.  <QUOTE>I know of no fabric in London,</QUOTE>  continues Mr. Malton,  <QUOTE>of similar dimensions, that can rival this structure in these characteristics. It is beautifully simple without meanness, and grand without exaggeration.</QUOTE>  
<p>The principal front is built of brick, with stone dressings; the elevation is made into <num value="2">two</num> stories; the lower <num value="1">one</num> contains the doorway, fronted by a small portico,, composed of <num value="2">two</num> Doric columns: the upper <num value="1">one</num> consists of <num value="4">four</num> half columns of the Ionic order; the shafts fluted. They are surmounted by the entablature of the order,, and crowned with a pediment. On the frieze is inscribed,  <QUOTE>Arts and Commerce promoted.</QUOTE>  
<p>The interior of the structure is peculiarly elegant, and very commodious for the uses of the society, consisting of apartments for depositing the various models, &amp;c. which have obtained prizes from the society; but the most peculiar object of curiosity is the great room. This is a fine proportioned hall, <num value="47">forty-seven</num> feet in length; <num value="42">forty-two</num> in breadth; and <num value="40">forty</num> in height, illuminated through a dome. The sides are the labours of the late James Barry, esq. to whose abilities the world is indebted for this valuable effort, in the patriotic intention of offering to the public a practical illustration of the arguments he had occasion to adduce against opinions generally received, and highly derogatory to the honour and genius of the British nation; those opinions generally asserted the incapacity of the British with respect to imagination, taste, or sensibility; that they were cold and unfeeling to the powers of music; that they succeeded in nothing in which genius is requisite; and that they seemed to disrelish every thing, even in life itself, &amp;c. It was Mr. Barry's purpose, therefore, to refute the unjust and illiberal aspersion by the production of the magnificent exhibition we are about to describe. 
<p>The series consists of <num value="6">six</num> pictures, on dignified and important subjects, so connected as to illustrate this great maxim of moral truth,  <QUOTE>That the attainment of happiness, individual as well public, depends on the developement, proper cultivation, and perfection of the human faculties, physical and moral, which are so well calculated to lead human nature to its true rank, and the glorious designation assigned for it by Providence.</QUOTE>  To illustrate this doctrine, the <num value="1">first</num> picture exhibits mankind in a savage state, exposed to all the inconvenience and misery of neglected culture; the <num value="2">second</num> represents a harvest home, or thanksgiving to Ceres and Bacchus; the <num value="3">third</num>, the victors at Olympia, the <num value="4">fourth</num>, Navigation, or the triumph of the Thames; the <num value="5">fifth</num>, the distribution of rewards by the society: and the <num value="6">sixth</num>, Elysium, or the state of final <pb id="p.257" n="257"> retribution. <num value="3">Three</num> of these subjects are truly poetical, the others historical. The pictures are all of the same height, viz. <num value="11">eleven</num> feet <num value="10">ten</num> inches; and the <num value="1">first</num>, <num value="2">second</num>, <num value="4">fourth</num>, and <num value="5">fifth</num>, are <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet <num value="2">two</num> inches long; the <num value="3">third</num> and <num value="6">sixth</num>, which occupy the whole breadth of the room, at the north and south ends, are each <num value="42">forty-two</num> feet long. 
<p>Though we are prescribed in our limits, we are compelled to give an account of the <num value="3">three</num> last pictures. 
<p>The Thames.-Personified and represented, of a venerable, majestic, and gracious aspect, sitting on the waters in a triumphal car, steering himself with <num value="1">one</num> hand, and holding in the other the mariner's compass. The car is borne along by the great navigators, sir Francis Drake, sir Walter Raleigh, Sebastian Cabot, and the late captain Cook: in the front. of the car, and apparently in.the action of meeting it, are <num value="4">four</num> figures, representing Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, ready to lay their several productions in the lap of the Thames. The supplicating action of the poor negro slave, or more properly of enslaved Africa, the cord round his neck, the tear on his cheek, the iron manacles, and attached heavy chain on his wrists, with his hands clasped and stretched out for mercy, denote the agonies of his soul, and the feelings of the artist thus expressed, before the abolition of slavery became the subject of public investigation. 
<p>Over bead is Mercury, the emblem of Commerce, summoning the nations together; and following the car, are Nereids carrying several articles of the principal manufactures of Great Britain. 
<p>In this scene of triumph and joy, the artist has introduced music, and, for this reason, placed among the sea-nymphs his friend, the late Dr. Burney. 
<p>In the distance is a view of the chalky cliffs on the English coast, with ships sailing, highly characteristic of the commerce of this country, which the picture is intended to record. In the end of the picture, next the chimney, there is a naval pillar, mausoleum, observatory, light-house, or all of these, they being all comprehended in the same structure. 
<p>In this important object, so ingeniously produced by the sea gods, we have at last obtained the happy concurrence and union of so many important desiderata in that opportunity of convenient inspection of all the sculptured communications, the want of which had been so deeply regretted by all who had seen the Trajan and Antonine columns, and other celebrated remains of antiquity. 
<p>The Society.-This picture represents the distribution of the rewards of the society. Not far advanced from the left side of the picture stands the late lord Romney, then president of the society, habited in the--robes of his dignity; near the president his royal highness the prince of Wales; and sitting at the corner of the picture, holding in his hand the instrument of the institution, is Mr. <pb id="p.258" n="258"> 
<p>William Shipley,  <QUOTE> whose public spirit gave rise to this society.</QUOTE>  <num value="1">One</num> of the farmers (who are producing specimens of grain to the president) is Arthur Young, esq. Near him, Mr. More, the late secretary. On the right hand of the late lord Romney stands the present earl of Romney, then V. P.; and on the left the late Owen Salusbury Brereton, esq. V. P. Towards the centre of the picture is seen that distinguished example of female excellence, Mrs. Montaue, who long honoured the society with her name and subscription. She appears recommending the ingenuity and industry of a young female, whose work she is producing. Near her are placed the late duke and duchess of Northumberland, the late Joshua Steele, esq. V. P.. the late sir George Saville, bart. V. P. Dr. Hurd, bishop of Worcester, Soame Jennings and James Harris, esqs. and the <num value="2">two</num> duchesses of Rutland and Devonshire; between these ladies the late Dr. Samuel Johnson seems pointing out the example of Mrs. Montague to their graces' attention and imitation. Farther advanced is his grace the late duke of Richmond, V. P. and the late Edmund Burke, esq. Still nearer the right hand side of the picture, is the late Edward Hooper, esq. V. P. and the late Keane Fitz-Gerald, esqr. V. P., his grace the late duke of Northumberland, V. P. and the earl of Radnor, V.P. William Lock, esq. and Dr. William Hunter are examining some drawings by a youth, to whom a premium has been adjudged; behind him is another youth, in whose countenance the dejection he feels at being disappointed in his expectation of a reward is finely expressed. Near the right side of the piece are seen the late lord viscount Folkestone, <num value="1">first</num> president of this society, his son, the late earl Radnor, V. P. and Dr. Stephen Hales, V. P. In the back ground appear part of the water front of Somerset-house, St. Paul's, and other objects in the vicinity and view of this society as instituted at London. And as a very large part of the rewards bestowed by the society have been distributed to promote the polite arts of painting and sculpture, the artist has most judiciously introduced a picture and statue: the subject of the picture is the Fall of Lucifer, designed by Mr. Barry, when the royal academy had selected <num value="6">six</num> of the members to paint pictures for St. Paul's cathedral; the statue is that of the Grecian Mother dying, and in those moments attentive only to the safety of her child. In the corners of the picture are represented many articles which have been invented or improved by the encouragement of this society. In the lower corner of this picture, next the chimney, are introduced <num value="2">two</num> large models intended by Mr. Barry as improvements of medals and coins. Elysium, or the State of Final Retribution.--In this sublime picture, which occupies the whole length of the room, the artist has with wonderful sagacity, and without any of those anachronisms which tarnish the lustre of other very celebrated performances, brought together those great and good men of all ages and nations, who have acted as the cultivators and benefactors of mankind.. <pb id="p.259" n="259"> 
<p>This picture is separated from that of the society distributing their rewards, by palm-trees; near which, on a pedestal, sits a pelican, feeding its young with its own blood; a happy type of those personages represented in the picture, who had worn themselves out in. the service of mankind. Behind the palms, near the top of the picture, are distinctly seen, as immersed and lost in the great blaze of light, cherubim veiled with their wings, in the act of adoration, and offering incense to that invisible and incomprehensible Power which is above them, and out of the picture, from whence the light and glory proceed, and are diffused over the whole piece.<NOTE>See <BIBL>Milton, book iv. v. <num value="598">598</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> By thus introducing the idea of the Divine essence, by effect rather than by form, the absurdity committed by many painters is happily avoided, and the mind of every intelligent spectator is filled with awe and reverence. 
<p>The groups of female figures, which appear at a further distance absorbed in glory, are those characters of female excellence, whose social conduct, benevolence, affectionate friendship, and regular discharge of domestic duties, soften the cares of human life, and diffuse happiness around them. In the more advanced part, just bordering on the blaze of light (where the female figures are almost absorbed) is introduced a group of poor native West Indian females in the act of adoration, preceded by angels, burning incense, and followed by their good bishop, his face partly concealed by that energetic hand which holds his crozier, or pastoral staff, may, notwithstanding, by the word Chiapa inscribed in the front of his mitre, be identified with the glorious friar Bartolomeo de las Casas, bishop of that place. This matter of friendly intercourse, continued beyond life, is pushed still further in the more advanced part of the same group by the male adoring Americans, and some Dominican friars, where the very graceful incident occurs of <num value="1">one</num> of these Dominicans directing the attention of an astonished Carib to some circumstance of beatitude, the enjoyment of which he had promised to his Carib friend. The group below, on the left hand, in this picture, consists of Roger Bacon, Archimedes, Descartes, and Thales; behind them stand sir Francis Bacon, Copernicus, Galileo, and sir Isaac Newton, regarding with awe and admiration a solar system, which <num value="2">two</num> angels are unveiling and explaining to them. Near the inferior angel, who is holding the veil, is Columbus, with a chart of his voyage; and close to him Epaminondas with his shield, Socrates, Cato the younger, the elder Brutus, and sir Thomas More; a sextumvirate, to which, Swift says, all ages have not been able to add a <num value="7">seventh</num>. Behind Marcus Brutus is William Molyneux, holding his book of the case of Ireland; near Columbus is lord Shaftesbury, John Locke, Zeno, Aristotle, and Plato; and, in the opening between this group and the next are, Dr. William Harvey (the discoverer of the circulation of the blood) and the honourable Robert Boyle. <pb id="p.260" n="260"> 
<p>The next group are legislators, where king Alfred the great is' leaning on the shoulder of William Penn, who is shewing his tolerant pacific code of equal laws to Lycurgus; standing around them are Minos, Trajan, Antoninus, Peter the great of Russia, Edward the Black Prince, Henry the <num value="4">fourth</num> of France, and Andrea Doria of Genoa. Here, too, are introduced those patrons of genius, Lorenzo de Medici, Louis the <num value="14">fourteenth</num>, Alexander the great, Charles the <num value="1">first</num>, Colbert, Leo the <num value="10">tenth</num>, Francis the <num value="1">first</num> earl of Arundel, and the illustrious monk Cassiodorus, no less admirable and exemplary as the secretary of state, than as the friar in his convent at Viviers, the plan of which he holds in his hand. Just before this group, on the rocks which separate Elysium from the infernal regions, are placed the angelic guards; and in the most advanced part an archangel weighing attentively the virtues and vices of mankind, whose raised hand and expressive countenance denote great concern at the preponderancy of evil; behind this figure is another angel explaining to Pascal and bishop Butler the analogy between nature and revealed religion. The figure behind Pascal and Butler, with his arms stretched out, and advancing with so much energy, is that ornament of our latter age, the graceful, the sublime Bossuet, bishop of Meux; the uniting tendency of the paper he holds in that hand resting on the shoulder of Origen, would well comport with those pacific views of the amiable Grotius, for healing those discordant evils which are sapping the foundations of Christianity amongst the nations of Europe, where in other respects it would be, and even is so happily and so well established. 
<p>Behind Francis the <num value="1">first</num> and lord Arundel are Hugo Grotius, father Paul, and pope Adrian. Towards the top of the picture, and near the centre sits Homer; on his right hand, Milton; next him, Shakespeare, Spencer, Chaucer, and Sappho. Behind Sappho sits Alcaeus, who is talking with Ossian; near him are Menander, Molieri, Congreve, Bruma, Confucius, Mango Capac, &amp;c. &amp;c. Next Homer, on the other side, is archbishop Fenelon, with Virgil leaning on his shoulder; and near them are Tasso, Ariosto, and Dante. Behind Dante, Petrarca, Laura, Giovanni, and Boccaccio. 
<p>In the <num value="2">second</num> range of figures, over Edward the black prince and Peter the great, are Swift, Erasmus, Cervantes; near them Pope, Dryden, Addison, Richardson, Moses Mendelshon, and Hogarth. Behind Dryden and Pope are Sterne, Gray, Goldsmith, Thomson, and Fielding; and near Richardson, Inigo Jones, sir Christopher Wren, sir Joshua Reynolds, and Vandyke. Next Vandyke is Rubens, with his hand on the shoulders of Le Soeur, and behind him is Le Brun. Next to these are Julio Romano, Dominichino, and Annibal Caracci, who are in conversation with Phidias; behind whom is Giles Hussey. Nicholas Poussin and the Sicyonian maid are near them, with Callimachus and Pamphilius; near Appelles is Corregio; behind Raphaello stand Michael Angelo and Leonardo da Vinci, and behind them Ghiberti, Donatello, Massachio, Brunaleschi, Albert Durer, Giotto, and Cimabue. <pb id="p.261" n="261"> 
<hi rend=italics>r</hi> In the top of this part of the picture, the painter has happily glanced at what is called by astronomers the  <QUOTE>system of systems,</QUOTE>  where the fixed stars, considered as so many suns, each with his several planets, are revolving round the Great Cause of all things; and representing every thing as affected by intelligence, has shewn each system carried along in its revolution by an angel. Though only a small portion of this article can be seen, yet enough is shewn to manifest the sublimity of the idea. 
<p>In the other corner of the picture the artist has represented Tartarus, where, among cataracts of fire and clouds of smoke, <num value="2">two</num> large hands are seen, <num value="1">one</num> of them holding a fire-fork, the other pulling down a number of figures bound together representing War, Gluttony, Extravagance, Detraction, Parsimony, and Ambition; and floating down the fiery gulph are Tyranny, Hypocrisy, and Cruelty, with their different attributes: the whole of this excellent picture proving, in the most forcible manner, the truth of that maxim, which has been already quoted, but cannot be too often inculcated: 
<p> <QUOTE>That the attainment of man's true rank in the creation, and his present and future happiness, individual as well as public, depended on the cultivation and proper direction of the human faculties.</QUOTE>  
<p>Besides the pictures already mentioned as painted by Mr. Barry, the room is still further ornamented by <num value="2">two</num> whole length portraits: the <num value="1">one</num> of lord viscount Folkestone, painted by Gainsborough; the other of lord Romney, both presidents, by sir Joshua Reynolds. On the north side of the room are (presented by the late John Bacon, esq. R. A.) <num value="2">two</num> casts in plaister, from statues of Mars and Venus, and on the south side a cast from a Narcissus, designed and executed in marble, by that excellent artist; for which premiums offered by the society for promoting the art of statuary in this country were adjudged to him. Over <num value="1">one</num> of the chimnies is a clock of a curious construction, the gift of the late Mr. Thomas Grignion; and over the other chimney a bust of his present majesty, when prince of Wales, by Mr. I. C. Lockee. On the north side of the room are <num value="2">two</num> busts, presented by M. de la Blancherie; the <num value="1">one</num> of Dr. Benjamin Franklin, formerly an active member of this society; the other of M. Perronet, a celebrated French architect. On the south side of the room is a statue erected by Carlini (presented by Ralph Ward, esq.) of the late Dr. Ward, the inventor of the improved process of making sulphureous acid; and over the chair a miniature of Mr William Shipley, painted and presented by Mr. W. Hinckes. 
<p>The Society for the Encouragement of Arts, &amp;c. was instituted in <datestruct value="1753--"><year reg="1753">1753</year></datestruct>. The idea was suggested by Mr. Shipley, an ingenious artist, and eagerly patronised by the late lord Folkestone and the late lord Romney. The institution consists of a president, <num value="12">twelve</num> vice presidents, various officers, and an indefinite number of subscribers; and si supported solely by voluntary contributions. <pb id="p.262" n="262"> 
<p>The chief objects of this society are to promote the arts, manufactures, and commerce of this kingdom, by giving premiums for all useful inventions, discoveries, and improvements which tend to that purpose; and, in pursuance of this plan, the society has already expended nearly <measure value="50000l." type=currency><num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> pounds</measure>, advanced by voluntary subscriptions of the members and legacies bequeathed. 
<p>On the north side of the Strand, nearly opposite Robert-street, is 
<div2 type=section id="c.5.7"><HEAD>The Adelphi Theatre.</HEAD>
 
<p>This theatre was commenced building in <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, by Mr. Scott, who kept a respectable dye and colour warehouse in the Strand, and was opened on the <datestruct VALUE="1806-11-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> <month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, as  <QUOTE>The Sans Pareil Theatre,</QUOTE>  under the licence of the lord chamberlain, with a variety of mechanical and optical entertainments, songs, recitations, &amp;c. 
<p>Mr. Scott finding the speculation answer, considerably enlarged the building, and on the commencement of the <num value="2">second</num> season introduced dramatic entertainments (written by Miss Scott) which were extremely well supported.

<div2 type=section id="c.5.8"><HEAD>Theatre Royal Drury Lane.</HEAD>
 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> theatre in Drury Lane was a cock-pit, which, hoisting a Phoenix for a sign, was sometimes called by that name; it was not, however, until after the restoration of Charles II., that a house suitable for the accommodation of the public was erected. It soon shared the too common fate of the London theatres, and was burnt down in <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>; and <num value="3">three</num> years afterwards it was rebuilt under the direction of that great architect, sir Christopher Wren. This fabric, which was of considerable dimensions, and excellent in its internal arrangements, remained undisturbed until the year <datestruct value="1791"><year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>, when it was determined to take it down, and re-build it on a scale better adapted to the increased population, and the more refined taste of the age. During this period, Drury Lane Theatre had been highly attractive; on its boards, a Garrick and a Siddons had trod, and the former, after amassing a splendid fortune, sold his share of the property for <measure value="35000l." type=currency><num value="35000">35,000</num>l.</measure> 
<p>The theatre built by sir Christopher Wren was probably too small, though we hear no complaints of that sort, even when the popularity of the British Roscius was at its height; but certain it is, that in building the new theatre in <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>, the architect fell into the opposite extreme; the house was so enlarged in its dimensions, as to be a theatre for spectators, rather than hearers; and as the audience lost all those advantages, which a convenient distance from the speaker gave in seeing the expression of his countenance, and hearing the varied modulations of his voice, the love of spectacle, which had already manifested itself, began to predominate. The splendour of the scenes, the ingenuity of the machinist, and the richness of the costume, aided by the captivating charms of music, superseded the labours of the poet; and while Otway a century ago obtained but <measure value="15l." type=currency><num value="15">15</num>l.</measure> for the tragedy of Venice Preserved, Mr. George Colman the Younger, was in our day rewarded with <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num>l.</measure> for the spectacle of  <QUOTE>Blue Beard.</QUOTE>  
<p>When it was determined to take down the edifice erected by sir Christopher Wren, Mr. Henry Holland was appointed the architect, under whose direction the theatre was built, and opened on the <datestruct VALUE="1794-04-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>. As so many theatres had been destroyed by fire, it was determined to take every precaution against such a calamity in future. An iron curtain, which resisted the force of a sledge hammer, was constructed so as to let down in a moment of danger, and separate the audience from the stage, while a reservoir was formed on the top of the house, filled with water sufficient, as the epilogue spoken at the opening of the theatre, by Miss Farren, gave assurance, to  <QUOTE>drown the audience in a minute.</QUOTE>  On the <num value="1">first</num> night, the iron curtain was let down, and the stage was filled with water, on which a man rowed round with a boat; the managers boasted of their reservoirs, 
<QUOTE rend=bockquote><L part=f>A firm reliance, 
<L>Whose streams set conflagration at defiance.</QUOTE>
 <pb id="p.264" n="264"> 
<p>But these were  <QUOTE>luckless words,</QUOTE>  a  <QUOTE>bootless boas ;</QUOTE>  for, <num value="15">fifteen</num> years afterwards, the whole fabric was burnt to the ground. This calamity occurred on the <datestruct VALUE="1809-02-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>; and so rapid were the flames, that, although the fire did not break out until <num value="11">11</num> o'clock at night, the immense edifice was reduced to a pile of ruins in less than <num value="3">three</num> hours. 
<p>So various and so conflicting were the interests in the property of the theatre, that it was long before they could be reconciled; at length it was determined to rebuild it on a somewhat more diminished but more magnificent scale. 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> stone of this externally substantial and internally superb and well contrived theatre, was laid on the <datestruct VALUE="1811-10-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, and the new theatre opened on October <num value="101812">10,1812</num>. 
<p>The architecture is simple, elegant, and uniform. The skill of the architect, Benjamin Wyatt, esq. was powerfully and liberally aided by an intelligent and public-spirited committee, of which the late Samuel Whitbread, esq. was the zealous and indefatigable chairman. It was partly built upon the plan of the great theatre at Bourdeaux, supposed to be the best house in Europe for the accurate conveyance of sound. 
<p>The grand entrance is at Brydges-street, through a spacious hall leading to the boxes and pit. This hall is supported by <num value="5">five</num> Doric columns, and illuminated by <num value="2">two</num> large brass lamps. <num value="3">Three</num> large doors lead from this hall into the house, and into a rotunda of great beauty and elegance. On each side of the rotunda are passages to the great stairs, which are peculiarly grand and spacious; over them are ornamented ceilings, with a turret light. The body of the theatre presents nearly <num value="3">three</num>-fourths of a circle from the stage. This circular appearance is partly an optical deception, and has the effect of making every spectator imagine himself nearly close upon the stage, though seated in a centre box. The colour of the interior is gold upon green, and the relief of the boxes is by a rich crimson. There are <num value="3">three</num> circles of boxes, each containing <num value="24">twenty-four</num> boxes, with <num value="4">four</num> rows of seats, and sufficient room between each: there are <num value="7">seven</num> slip boxes on each side, ranging with the <num value="1">first</num> gallery, and the like number of private boxes nearly upon a level with the pit. The boxes will hold <datestruct value="1200--"><year reg="1200">1200</year></datestruct> individuals, the pit about <num value="850">850</num>, the lower gallery <num value="480">480</num>, and the upper gallery <num value="280">280</num>; in all <num value="2810">2810</num> persons may be accommodated. The entrances to all the boxes and pit are secure. The appearance of the house is brilliant, without being gaudy, and elegant without affectation. The fronts of the boxes have all diversified ornaments, which are neatly gilt, and give a variety and relief to the general aspect. We must not omit the just praise which is due to the architect for these arrangements, which exclude the interruption caused by improper persons, and by necessary attractions draw off the noisy and frivolous part of the audience from the grave and sober hearers. 
<p>The grand saloon is <num value="87">eighty-seven</num> feet long, semicircular at each <pb id="p.265" n="265"> extremity, and separated from the box corridores by the rotunda and grand staircase. It has a richly gilt stone at each corner, over which are finely imitated black and yellow veined marble slabs, or pedestals, in the niches. The ceiling is arched, and the general effect of <num value="2">two</num> massy Corinthian columns of verd antique at each end, with <num value="10">ten</num> corresponding pilasters on each side, is grand and pleasing. The rooms for coffee and refreshments, at the ends of the saloon, though small, are very neat; they consist of recesses, Corinthian pilasters, <num value="4">four</num> circular arches with domes supporting skylights, from which glass- lamps are suspended. On the north side of the theatre is the wardrobe. The retiring rooms for the stage boxes are decorated with rich crimson carpets and with deep crimson embossed paper. The private boxes have no antichamber. 
<p>There are <num value="17">seventeen</num> rows of seats in the pit, with <num value="4">four</num> short ones, in consequence of the orchestra making <num value="2">two</num> projections into it. The orchestra is about <num value="8">eight</num> feet wide, and extends nearly the whole width of the pit. The proscenium is now arranged in a very different manner from its original state, as designed by Mr. Wyatt. On each side, elevated on a lofty pedestal, forming a parallelogram, are <num value="2">two</num> demi-columns of the Corinthian order, fluted and superbly gilt, and supporting an entablature; above which, in semi-circular niches, are allegorical statues of Tragedy and Comedy. On each side, between the columns, are <num value="3">three</num> private boxes, the fronts of which are of crimson plaster, with a radiant head of Apollo in the centre. The king's box is that between the columns, on the left of the auditory, which ranges with the dress circle. The upper part of the proscenium consists of a painted crimson curtain, with the royal arms in subdued colouring. 
<p>The ceiling is very elegant, and is enriched with roses in annulets, &amp;c. From an opening in the centre a very large and elegant cut glass chandelier depends, which is lighted by gas. 
<p>The principal green-room is a handsome apartment; on a bracket is a bust of  <QUOTE>Mrs. Sarah Siddons,</QUOTE>  which was sculptured by J. Smith in <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, and presented to the green-room by the late Samuel Whitbread, esq. in <datestruct VALUE="1814-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>. Opposite is a cast of the bust of E. Kean, esq. by S. Joseph. 
<p>The painting-room, which is over the eastern extremity of the stage, is <num value="79">seventy-nine</num> feet long, and <num value="31">thirty-one</num> feet wide. At the north-east angle of the theatre is a detached building, called the scene-room. It is <num value="73">73</num> feet <num value="3">3</num> inches in length, and about <num value="30">30</num> feet wide. 
<p>The theatre itself is a master-piece of art, and an ornament to the metropolis. The coup d&lsquo;oeil is delightful beyond the power of description: it certainly has no rival in England, or perhaps in the known world, for beauty, completeness; and magnificence. The architect need envy no other artist, living or dead, after exhibiting this happy specimen of his taste and genius. <pb id="p.266" n="266">

<p>Since the erection of the present theatre, the concern, under the management of committees, sub-committees, acting committees, and select committees, has been in a very embarrassed state; and, in <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>, the proprietors and renters having resolved on letting the theatre to some individual, at a fixed rent, for a term of <num value="14">fourteen</num> years, Mr. Elliston became the lessee, at an annual rent of <num value="10200">10,200</num>l Previous to the season of <datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>-<num value="3">3</num>, the interior of the theatre was completely new modelled, and a new auditory substituted for the old <num value="1">one</num>; executed by Mr. Peto, from the designs of Mr. S.

Yet, on Mr. Elliston not fulfilling a contract in his lease at the conclusion of the season <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>-<num value="6">6</num>, it was most ungenerously declared forfeited.

<p>The  <QUOTE>little theatre in the Haymarket,</QUOTE>  as this house was called, <pb id="p.268" n="268"> to distinguish it from the Opera-house, has long possessed an uninterrupted and extensive share of public favour: and the legitimate drama, when almost excluded from every other theatre, here found an asylum. To a speculating mechanic of the name of John Potter, this theatre owes its rise; it was <num value="1">first</num> erected in <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, on the site of the King's-head inn. The expense of the building was <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num>l.</measure> and he laid out about <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">500</num>l.</measure> more for scenes and decorations, although without any specific object beyond that of letting it to the  <QUOTE>French players,</QUOTE>  as the foreign actors and singers were then called, be their country what it might. On the <datestruct VALUE="-12-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></datestruct> in that year it was opened with a comedy, entitled, <title lang=fr>La Fille &agrave; la Morte</title>, and for many years was occupied by foreign adventurers, who gave various entertainments, in which tumbling and rope-dancing were not omitted. It was at this theatre also that Foote revelled in his gay humour and personal satire, under the tolerance rather than the sanction of the lord chamberlain; until, in the year <datestruct value="1767"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>, it was raised to the dignity of a theatre royal, and a patent granted to Mr. Foote, authorising him to build a theatre in the city and liberties of Westminster, and to exhibit dramatic performances, &amp;c. from the <datestruct VALUE="-05-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct> to the <datestruct VALUE="-09-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct> in each year during his life. Mr. Foote immediately had the old theatre taken down and a new <num value="1">one</num> built; but whether this was an improvement or not, may be fairly doubted, as a more disagreeable or inconvenient structure can scarcely be conceived than the late theatre, which was opened in <datestruct VALUE="1767-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>. In nothing was the house more disadvantageously constructed than in the entrances, which were extremely narrow; a melancholy proof of this occurred on the <num value="3">3</num>d of <datestruct VALUE="1794-02--"><month reg="02">Feb.</month> <year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>, when his majesty having bespoken the play, the rush to the pit on the opening the doors was so great, that <num value="15">fifteen</num> persons were killed, and more than <num value="20">twenty</num> others dreadfully injured. It has been severally under the management of Foote, the <num value="2">two</num> Colmans, and Thomas Dibdin, all gentlemen of such talents, and so intimately acquainted with the detail of a theatre, as to ensure its success. 
<p>A ridiculous riot took place at this theatre in the year <datestruct value="1805"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>, when Mr. Dowton announced, as <num value="1">one</num> of the pieces for his benefit, a farce called  <QUOTE> The Tailors, or a Tragedy for Warm Weather,</QUOTE>  which had been acted with great success, under Foote, in <datestruct value="1767--"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>. No sooner was this announced, than the whole body of tailors arose as <num value="1">one</num> man, to resist what they thought an illiberal attack on their trade. Threatening letters were sent to Dowton and the manager, some of which were signed with the name of the individual, and <num value="1">one</num> by the secretary to <num value="1">one</num> of their clubs. On the night of performance, <num value="700">700</num> tailors besieged the doors, and got possession of the gallery, when such symptoms of tumult were manifested, that it was necessary to call in the police; and afterwards a detachment of the guards; when, after <num value="32">thirty-two</num> of the rioters had been taken into custody, the piece was performed, amidst loud shouts of disapprobation.

In <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>, Mr. Morris became possessed of Mr. Colman's share in this theatre, the latter gentleman retiring entirely from the concern. The property is now vested in Messrs.

<p>The new theatre was designed by John Nash, esq. and built at the distance of a few feet southward from the old house. The cost is said to have been <measure value="18000l." type=currency><num value="18000">18,000</num>l.</measure>, and the new house was opened to the public on <datestruct VALUE="1821-07-4"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=4>4</day>, <year reg=1821>1821</year></datestruct>.

<p>It will be seen by the following notice, which appeared in the London Gazette of the <datestruct VALUE="1690-10-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1690">1690</year></datestruct>, that St. James's park was then within the rigorous operation of the Game Laws :

<p>In this park are <num value="2">two</num> pieces of artillery, the trophies of our arms, in distant parts of the globe. <num value="1">One</num> is a Turkish piece of ordnance, about eighteen feet in length, which was brought from Alexandria, by our troops, in the campaign of <datestruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct>-<num value="9">9</num>. The other is a grand mortar, which was cast in the French camp, during the siege of Cadiz, in the last Peninsular war. It is <num value="8">eight</num> feet long, the bore is <num value="12">twelve</num> inches in diameter, and it will throw a shell a distance of <num value="3">three</num> miles. When the British troops, under the immortal Wellington, compelled the French to raise the siege, this mortar fell into our hands, and was brought to England. In <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct> it was mounted on a bed of metal, weighing <num value="16">16</num> tons, with several allegorical devices and an appropriate inscription, and placed in this park. 
<p>In <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, very important and in some respect excellent alterations were made in St. James's-park; the interior has been entirely altered, the straight formal canal has been widened in some places and narrowed in others, and some pretty little picturesque islands have been formed, numerous paths have been made, and the tout ensemble of the whole is very pleasing. Of the alterations without the fence little can be said in praise; the width of the promenade has been narrowed by taking m the old carriage road next Carlton-house gardens; and forming a road on what was formerly the Mall. On the opposite side of the park the same has been done by enclosing a large piece of ground within the rails. Indeed it is a matter of doubt how much longer the beautiful groves of trees forming the Mall and Birdcage-walk will exist, as the terraces intended by the <QUOTE>Board of Works</QUOTE> will be so near the trees that it will be almost impossible for them to have any view of the park or canal, the whole architectural effect (if they ever possess any) will be effectually concealed. 
<p>The Green Park is a triangular piece of ground, parallel with Piccadilly, and adjoining to St. James's Park and the gardens of Buckingham-house. It contains a sheet of water on the north side, with a promenade round it, which is much frequented in summer. 
<p>In the Antiquarian Repertory there is a View of St. James's, Westminster abbey, and hall, taken from the village of Charing- <pb id="p.271" n="271"> 
<p>In this view, on the left of the observer is a public house, with some large trees before it, and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> small cottages: these are at the village just mentioned. From thence runs a long dead wall, which belongs to the palace. The site of this wall is now occupied by the capacious and elegant street of Pall Mall. Near the eastern extremity is a conduit, supposed to be standing where St. James's square now is; at the end of the wall stands the present palace of St. James. Beyond the wall are fields, now St. James's park; and beyond those stand the venerable abbey and hall of Westminster; the back ground is an elevated country, where not a solitary house can be discovered. 
<p>This tract of ground, as far as the wall and palace just mentioned belonged, and still does, to the parish of St. Martin's in the Fields, and, as such, 
<div2 type=section id="c.5.12"><HEAD>St. James's Palace,</HEAD>
 
<p>St. James's Palace, properly belongs to that portion of the present work now under consideration. 
<p>On the site of this royal palace anciently stood the hospital of St. James, which was founded by some wealthy and benevolent citizens of London for the reception of leperous women. This, it is said, and with great probability, was long before the Conquest. According to a MS. in the Cottonian library,<NOTE><BIBL>Titus, A. B.</BIBL></NOTE> it was visited by Gislebertus, abbot of Westminster, on Wednesday after the feast of St. John the Baptist, A. D. <datestruct value="1100"><year reg="1100">1100</year></datestruct>. 
<p>The hospital admitted only <num value="14">fourteen</num> patients, who were to be unmarried persons. For their support the charity was endowed with <num value="2">two</num> hides, or ploughs of land, with their appurtenances, adjoining. 
<p>Some time after, several of the citizens, conferred upon the hospital lands to the value of <measure value="56l." type=currency><num value="56">fifty-six</num> pounds</measure> per annum, when <num value="8">eight</num> brethren, for the celebration of divine offices, were added to the foundation. This exercise of religion and benevolence, <num value="2">two</num> duties at all times inseparable, and supporting each other, inspired other citizens with similar sentiments; and they accordingly gave to the foundation <num value="4">four</num> hides of land in the same neighbourhood; besides <num value="80">eighty</num> acres of wood and arable land in the parishes of Hendon, Calcote and Hampstead. These several grants were not only confirmed by Edward I. but he likewise granted to the hospital an annual fair of <num value="7">seven</num> days, to begin on the eve of St. James's Festival. 
<p>The hospital above-mentioned was rebuilt in the reign of Henry III. and the custody of it was given by Henry VI. to Eton college; and that at the time of its surrender its annual revenues were estimated at <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num>l.</measure> per annum. 
<p>Henry VIII. the destroyer of any thing venerable, pious, or <pb id="p.272" n="272"> useful, took this hospital to himself, in the year <datestruct value="1532"><year reg="1532">1532</year></datestruct>; but he certainly acted on this occasion better than on most others of a like nature for he granted to the several sisters during their lives certain annuities, in lieu of the domestic comforts, and religious advantages of which he had sacrilegiously robbed them. Henry having demolished the ancient building, erected on its site a stately mansion, or, as Stow denominates,  <QUOTE>a goodly manor, but it does not appear to have been made the royal residence before the destruction of Whitehall Palace, by fire, in <datestruct value="1697--"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE>  
<p>Some remains of this building are still to be seen, especially in the north gate-way. 
<p>The mansion erected on the site of this hospital was partly surrounded by a wall; or rather, the neighbouring fields were thus converted into a park for the convenience of this and the palace of Whitehall. The mews, already mentioned, belonged to the same mansion, as at the present time. 
<p>The mansion was given by James I. to his son Henry, prince of Wales, who resided in it till his death, in <datestruct value="1612--"><year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct>. 
<p>To this place the regicides brought their king, Charles I. from Windsor, and here the unfortunate monarch spent the last <num value="11">eleven</num> days of his life. He was brought here on the <datestruct VALUE="-01-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>. Mr. Kinnersley, his servant of the wardrobe, hastily furnished his apartment. Some part of the <num value="11">eleven</num> days were spent in Westminster hall, and of the nights in the house of sir R. Cotton, adjacent to his place of trial. 
<p>On the <num value="27">27th</num> his majesty was carried back to St. James's, where he passed the last <num value="3">three</num> days in acts of devotion and piety, preparatory to that shameful death to which his sanguinary judges had consigned him. 
<p>In this palace was born James, the son of James II. afterwards styled the Pretender, according to Pennant, in the room now called the Old Bed Chamber, at present, the anti-chamber to the levee-room. The bed stood close to the door of the back stairs, which descended to an inner court. It certainly was very convenient to carry on any secret design, and might favour the warming-pan story, were not the bed surrounded by <num value="20">twenty</num> of the privy council, <num value="4">four</num> other men of rank, <num value="20">twenty</num> ladies, besides pages and other attendants. James. with imprudent pride, neglected to disprove the tale; it was adopted by the party, and firmly believed by its zealots. But as James proved false to his high trust, and his son shewed every symptom of following his example, there was certainly no such pretence wanting for excluding a family inimical to the great interests of the nation, and whose religious creed was evidently at variance with that of a large majority of his subjects. 
<p>In that year of English liberty, <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>, when the Prince of Orange had approached very near to the metropolis, the weak and superstitious James sent a message, offering him his palace for his habitation; that  <QUOTE> they might amicably and personally confer together <pb id="p.273" n="273"> about the means of redressing the public grievances.</QUOTE>  No answer was returned to this apparent friendly invitation, yet it appears the offer was accepted, though not on the terms the imbecile monarch had proposed; for the prince called a council, and it was deemed necessary to hint to the king, that it would not be safe for him, in future, to reside at either of his palaces of St. James's, or Whitehall. James was not unmindful of this admonition. It was <num value="1">first</num> resolved to convey him to Ham in the county of Surrey; but he afterwards obtained permission to go to Rochester; from whence, in a day or <num value="2">two</num> afterwards, he privately withdrew, and a small frigate conveyed him to France; thus abdicating a throne for which he seems by no means to have been qualified either by nature, his principles, or his education. 
<p>The evening of the day on which James left London, Dutch guards took possession of all the posts about Whitehall and St. James's, and William soon became the royal possessor of these palaces. 
<p>On the trying occasion just briefly detailed, an old officer of the degraded monarch gave a memorable proof of his fidelity to what he conceived to be his royal master. 
<p>At this time it was customary to mount guard both at Whitehall and St. James's. Lord Craven was on duty at the latter place, when the Dutch guards, under the orders of the prince of Orange, were marching through the park to relieve him. His lordship, with the bravery of a hero and a loyal subject, obstinately refused to quit his post, and seemed resolved to make a most determined resistance to the orders of the foreign intruders, when he received a command from James himself to obey. This was an authority which he had not accustomed himself to disobey, and, with  <QUOTE> sullen dignity,</QUOTE>  he gave the command to his party and marched off. 
<p>After the revolution, during the reign of William, St. James's palace was superbly fitted up for the residence of the princess, afterwards queen Anne, and her consort, prince George of Denmark. From that time it has been considered as the town residence of the British monarchs; but has of late years been used only for purposes of state. 
<p>The various houses, offices, &amp;c. in the immediate precincts of, or attached to the palace, are occupied chiefly by some branches of the royal family, and other persons of the household. 
<p>On the morning of the <datestruct VALUE="1809-01-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, great part of this palace was consumed by an accidental fire, which reduced to ashes the whole south-east corner, comprehending the queen's private apartments, those of the duke of Cambridge, some of the state apartments, together with the French and Dutch chapels. The damage was estimated at about <measure value="100000l." type=currency><num value="100000">100,000</num>l.</measure> The repairs have not yet been completed; and, since that accident, St. James's palace was seldom visited by the royal family. The whole of St. James's palace, and some buildings contiguous, form a precinct separate from the parish of St. Martins in the Fields. <pb id="p.274" n="274"> 
<p>The principal front towards St. James's-street has a mean appearence; it consists of a brick gateway with a flat pointed arch, and at the angles are octagonal turrets; the centre has a plain but neat cupola, with a clock. 
<p>The state apartments look towards the park; and this side, though certainly not very imposing, cannot, with truth, be pronounced mean. It is of <num value="1">one</num> story, and has a certain regular appearance not to be found in other parts of the building. 
<p>Before the marriage of his present majesty, the state apartments were very old and poorly furnished; but on that occasion they were fitted in the state in which they were before the fire. Though there is nothing superb or grand in the decorations or furniture of these apartments, they are commodious and handsome. They are entered by a staircase that opens into the principal court, next to Pall-mall. 
<p>At the top of the staircase are <num value="2">two</num> guard-rooms; <num value="1">one</num> to the left called the queen's, and the other the king's guard-room, leading to the apartments just mentioned. Immediately beyond the king's guard-room is the presence chamber, now used only as a passage to the principal rooms. There is a range of <num value="5">five</num> of these, opening into each other successively. The presence-chamber opens into the centre-room, called the privy chamber, where is a canopy, under which his late majesty was accustomed to receive the society of friends, or quakers, upon occasions of their presentations of addresses, petitions, &amp;c. 
<p>On the right of the canopy are <num value="2">two</num> drawing-rooms, <num value="1">one</num> within the other. At the upper end of the farther <num value="1">one</num> was a throne, with its canopy, where the late king was wont to receive corporation addresses. The canopy was made for the queen's birth-day, immediately following the union of Ireland with Great Britain. It was of crimson velvet, with a broad gold lace, having embroidered crowns, set with real and fine pearls. The shamrock, the national badge of Ireland, formed <num value="1">one</num> of the decorations of the crown, and was very finely executed. In tins apartment the king and queen used to be present on certain days; the nearer room being a kind of anti-chamber, in which the nobility were permitted to sit down during the presence of their majesties in the farther <num value="1">one</num>, there being numerous stools and sofas for the purpose. 
<p>On the left, on entering the privy chamber, from the king's guard-room and presence chamber, are <num value="2">two</num> levee-rooms, the nearer serving as an anti-chamber to the other. 
<p>In the grand drawing-room is a magnificent chandelier of gilt silver; and in the grand levee-room a very noble bed, the furniture of which is of crimson velvet, manufactured in Spitalfields. This bed, with the tapestry, was put up on the marriage of his present majesty. 
<p>These several apartments are covered with tapestry of exquisite workmanship, which, though made for Charles II. a short time <pb id="p.275" n="275"> prior to that royal marriage, was found in a chest, never having been used, and quite fresh in the colours. 
<p>Several pictures adorn the apartments; but few of them have superior claims of merit either in the design or execution. The most remarkable are: a small full-length of Henry, prince of Wales; Arthur, prince of Wales, elder brother of Henry VIII. by Mabuse; Henry VII. and VIII.; queen Jane Seymour; <num value="2">two</num> half-lengths, by Lely, of the duchess of York and her sister; a child in the robes of the garter,  <QUOTE>perhaps,</QUOTE>  says Pennant,  <QUOTE> the youngest knight known.</QUOTE>  He was the <num value="2">second</num> son of James II. whilst duke of York, by Anne Hyde, his duchess. On the <datestruct VALUE="1666-12-3"><day reg="3">3rd</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, he was elected knight of the garter, at the age of <num value="3">three</num> years and <num value="5">five</num> months. The sovereign (Charles) put the George round his neck, and prince Rupert the garter round his leg. He would of course have been installed, but he died the year following. Here is also a portrait of Geoffry Hudson, the dwarf, mentioned in the account of Newgate-street,<NOTE><BIBL>Vide ante, vol. iii. p. <num value="574">574</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> in the preceding volume of this work: also Henry, lord Darnley, consort of Mary, queen of Scots, and father of James I. resting on his brother, Charles Stuart, earl of Lenox, in a black gown; Charles II. of Spain, at <num value="4">four</num> years of age, in black, with a sceptre in his hand. He was inaugurated in <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>. Mabuse's picture of Adam and Eve is also here; with the curious or whimsical anachronisms of navels, and a fountain richly carved. 
<p>Scarcely had his late majesty ascended the throne, than he commenced the formation of an extensive and splendid library. The <num value="1">first</num> purchase that he made was that of the library of Mr. Joseph Smith, the British consul at Venice, in <datestruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>, at an expense of <measure value="10000l." type=currency><num value="10000">10,000</num>l.</measure>; <num value="6">six</num> years afterwards, Mr. Bernard, the librarian, who was previously instructed by Dr. Johnson as to the best means of completing the royal library, was sent to the continent by his majesty, where he--made large purchases. To these collections, which formed the nucleus of a good library, his majesty added other books to the amount of <measure value="2000l." type=currency><num value="2000">2,000</num>l.</measure> a year until his death, and a similar sum has been annually expended by his present majesty. This library, consisting of <num value="65250">sixty-five thousand two hundred and fifty</num> volumes, and formed at an expence of <measure value="150000l." type=currency><num value="150000">150,000</num>l.</measure> paid out of the privy purse of the king, was deposited in spacious apartments fitted up for the purpose in Buckingham-house. It is now deposited in the British Museum; his present majesty (whose reign may be justly termed the Augustan age of Great Britain), having, with a generosity which is above all praise, presented the whole library to the British nation. It has been justly observed, that  <QUOTE>acts like these will perpetuate the memory of George the <num value="4">Fourth</num>, when the military glories of his reign, great as they are, will be forgotten.</QUOTE>  
<p>In a lumber room, formerly the queen's library, Mr. Pennant saw a beautiful View from Greenwich park, with Charles I. his queen, courtiers, &amp;c. walking; <num value="2">two</num> others of the same prince and queen, <pb id="p.276" n="276"> dining in public, and another of the elector palatine and his consort at a public table, with a carver looking most ridiculously, a monkey having in that moment reared from the table and seized his beard. Probably this feast was at Guildhall, where he was most sumptuously entertained by the citizens in the year <datestruct value="1612"><year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct>, when he made the match with the daughter of the British monarch, which ended so unhappily for both parties. 
<p>On the west side of the court yard is the Chapel Royal, a very small and plain room, which some have conjectured to have been the room used when the hospital stood here. It has nothing worthy of notice except its ceiling, which is divided into small painted squares. It is a royal peculiar, and as such, exempted from all episcopal jurisdiction. The service is performed in the same manner as at cathedrals; its establishment is a dean (usually the bishop of London), a lord high almoner, a sub-almoner, an hereditary grand almoner, a sub-dean, a confessor of the household, a clerk of the king's closet, deputy clerks, a closet keeper, and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> inferior officers, as choristers, &amp;c. 
<p>At the German chapel in the Friary there are <num value="2">two</num> chaplains, a reader, and a clerk. 
<p>In the Dutch chapel, in the middle court, are <num value="2">two</num> preachers and a reader; and at the French chapel, at the same place, there are <num value="3">three</num> preachers, a reader, and a chapel keeper. 
<p>Since the accession of his present majesty, this palace has received a most extensive repair, and some additions have been made. The presence-chamber has been enlarged, and furnished in a style worthy the sovereign of Great Britain; a new entrance has been formed from Cleveland-row, and a court opened on the east side. 
<p>The main entrance is by a staircase and passage, which open into the principal court, next to Pall Mall; here the interior walls are painted in distemper of a dead stone colour, and the exterior sprinkled to resemble granite. The king's guard-room, at the top of the staircase, is a kind of gallery, converted into an armoury, which is systematically decorated with daggers, swords, muskets, &amp;c. arranged in various figures. Here, when drawing-rooms are held, the yeomen of the guard attend in full costume, armed with their battle-axes. The next is a small chamber, lined with excellently wrought tapestry. This forms the entrance to a suite of <num value="3">three</num> principal rooms, the innermost of which is called the grand Presence Chamber. 
<p>These apartments are fitted up with almost matchless splendour. The cornices, mouldings, &amp;c. are richly gilt; the walls are lined with crimson damask, and the window curtains are of the same material. Sofas, ottomans, &amp;c. covered with crimson velvet, trimmed. with gold lace, form part of the furniture, the effect of which is greatly heightened by rich and elegant lustres, and magnificent pier glasses. In the <num value="1">first</num> room is a painting of George II. in his parliamentary robes, and views of Tournay and Lisle; and in the <num value="2">second</num> <pb id="p.277" n="277"> is George III. in the robes of the order of the garter, together with <num value="2">two</num> fine paintings of the victories achieved by lord Howe, on the <datestruct VALUE="1794-06-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>, and lord Nelson, at Trafalgar, <datestruct VALUE="1805-10-21"><month reg="10">October</month> the <day reg=21>21st</day>, <year reg=1805>1805</year></datestruct>. 
<p>The Presence Chamber, or grand drawing-room, though fitted up in a style corresponding with the others, exceeds them much in size and splendid decoration. Over the fire-place is a full-length portrait of his present majesty, by sir Thomas Lawrence; and on each side are paintings of the battles of Vittoria and Waterloo. The sides of the rooms are decorated with plate glass; the cornices, mouldings, &amp;c. are richly gilt; and the window curtains, of crimson satin, are tastefully trimmed with gold-coloured fringe and lace. The throne is extremely magnificent; it consists of a superb stale chair, surmounted by a canopy, &amp;c. composed chiefly of rich crimson Genoa velvet, trimmed with gold lace; under the canopy is an embroidered star, in gold. The ascent is by <num value="3">three</num> steps, and there is a footstool to correspond with the chair. Behind this chamber are the king's closet and his dressing-room. In the former, which is splendidly ornamented, his majesty gives audience to his ministers, the foreign ambassadors, and the members of his own family. 
<p>The old ball-room has been recently new modelled upon the French plan, and formed into a supper room. Ornamental compartments of various kinds, richly gilt, diversify the walls; and from the ceiling <num value="5">five</num> <hi rend=italics>or-moulu</hi> lustres are pendant. The fittings--up and furniture are very elegant. 
<p>The private apartments of the king are on the ground floor, at the west end of the palace, principally beneath the throne-room and audience-chamber in the range above. There is <num value="1">one</num> entrance by the engine court, from the northern side, chiefly for officers and attendants, &amp;c. and another for his majesty from the garden on the side of the park. The latter opens into a small vestibule, whence the stair runs up to the state rooms in the upper tier. On the right and left of the vestibule, on entrance, are the principal apartments of the monarch of Great Britain: they consist of <num value="1">one</num> chamber on the left hand, and <num value="4">four</num> on the right, with a single bed room, and a room for his page above. The whole of the apartments are furnished in the plainest manner, and the walls are decorated with some of the finest cabinet paintings in the royal collection. 
<p>When this palace was erected by Henry VIII. as I have before observed, he at the same time enclosed a contiguous piece of ground, which had till then been a desolate marsh, laid it out in walks, and collected the waters. This spot became a bowling green, which, as appears from the Stafford papers, was open for the entertainment of the public. 
<p>Mr. Garrard, writing in <datestruct value="1634--"><year reg="1634">1634</year></datestruct> to lord Stafford, says,  <QUOTE>The bowling-green in the Spring Gardens was put down <num value="1">one</num> day by the king's command, but by the intercession of the queen it was reprieved for this year; but hereafter it shall be no common bowling-place. There <pb id="p.278" n="278"> was kept an ordinary of <measure value="6s." type=currency><num value="6">six</num> shillings</measure> a meal (where the king's proclamation allows but <num value="2">two</num> elsewhere), continual bibbing and drinking wine all under the trees; <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> quarrels every week. It was grown scandalous and insufferable; besides, my lord Digby, being reprehended for striking in the king's garden, he said he took it for a common bowling-place, where all paid money for their coming in.</QUOTE>  
<p>In a subsequent letter, Mr. Garrard writes thus;  <QUOTE>Since the Spring Garden was put down, we have, by a servant of the lordchamberlain's, a new Spring Garden, erected in the fields behind the Meuse, where is built a fair house and <num value="2">two</num> bowling-greens, made to entertain gamesters and bowlers to an excessive rate, for I believe it has cost him <measure value="400l." type=currency><num value="400">400</num>l.</measure>; a dear undertaking for a gentleman barber. My lord chamberlain much frequents the place, where they bowl great matches.</QUOTE>  
<p>A writer of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century says of this place:  <QUOTE>The inclosure is not disagreeable, for the solemnness of the grove, the warbling of the birds, and, as it opens into the spacious walk at St. James's; but the company walk in at such a rate, as you would think all the ladies were so many Atalantas contending with their wooers; but as fast as they run, they stay so long as if they wanted time to finish the race: for it is usual to find some of the young company here till midnight.</QUOTE>  
<p>Mr. Lysons, who states these facts, observes, that this little trait of the fashion of the times will serve to account for many scenes in some of our old comedies, which still maintain their ground on the stage, to the probability of whose incidents a modern audience cannot easily be reconciled. 
<p>At the south-east angle of the Green park is a noble mansion intended for the residence of the late duke of York, but now the property of the marquis of Stafford. It presents a very magnificent aspect when seen from the parks, the form of the building being nearly a square. The front side, which faces the canal in St. James's park, projects slightly at each end; there is also a projecting in the middle, having <num value="6">six</num> Corinthian columns a little in advance, supporting a pediment. The windows on the ground floor, between the piers which support the columns, have circular heads. At each end are Venetian windows, <num value="1">one</num> on the ground floor, and <num value="1">one</num> on the <num value="1">first</num> floor: that on the <num value="1">first</num> floor has <num value="2">two</num> pilasters on each side of it, of the Corinthian order, of the same height as the columns which support the pediment in the middle. There are <num value="11">eleven</num> windows along the side of the building, both in the ground and <num value="1">first</num> floors; those of the <num value="1">first</num> floor are of large dimensions, and fully proportionate to the magnitude of the building. The west side, fronting the Green park, resembles exactly the side just described, with these exceptions: there are no pilasters on the projections at the <num value="2">two</num> ends, neither has it the Venetian windows, as they are all made of the same dimensions. The east side, which is directly opposite <pb id="p.279" n="279"> the duke of Clarence's new mansion differs from the other sides in its not having any columns in the centre projection, which contains only <num value="3">three</num> windows; between each of these windows are placed <num value="2">two</num> Corinthian pilasters; there are also <num value="2">two</num> pilasters at each of the angles of the centre projection. There are <num value="9">nine</num> windows on each tier on this side. The remaining side to the north has been chosen for the entrance, owing to the open space in the Stable-yard, immediately in front of it, affording ample room for the purpose of a court yard. In the middle of this side of the building a portico is erected, projecting sufficiently far to leave a commodious carriage drive under it. It is sustained by <num value="8">eight</num> Corinthian columns, <num value="6">six</num> in front, and <num value="2">two</num> placed behind the end ones near the building, which stand on piers, extending as high as the <num value="1">first</num> floor; the height of the portico corresponds with the height of the pediments on the south and west sides. Above the columns, pilasters, &amp;c. an entablature runs uninterruptedly round the building. Above this entablature a very elegant ballustrade has been put up to serve as a screen to the attic windows. Within the outer wall, although at no great distance from it, is an attic wall, rising several feet above the roof, which goes completely round the building. Into this wall all the flues have been conducted. Nearly in the centre of the edifice, and still loftier than the attic wall, a lantern of considerable dimensions has been erected; it is to light the grand staircase leading from the ground floor to the state apartments on the <num value="1">first</num> floor. 
<p>On the east side of the Stable-yard, and opposite the last mentioned mansion, is the residence of his royal highness the duke of Clarence. It is a handsome edifice, with a portico in <num value="2">two</num> stories; the lower being of the Doric, and the upper of the Corinthian order. 
<div1 type=chapter id="c.6" n="6"><HEAD>History and Topography of the parish of St. James, Westminster.</HEAD>
 
<p>The parish of St. James owes its foundation to the great increase in the parish of St. Martin's in the fields. A chapel of ease was originally built in the reign of Charles II. principally at the expense of the gallant earl of St. Albans (Harry Jermyn) who was supposed to be the husband of the dowager queen, the peerless Henrietta Maria. The expense being above <measure value="8000l." type=currency><num value="8000">8,000</num>l.</measure> 
<p>Upon the death of the abovementioned earl, Charles II. by letters patent of the <datestruct VALUE="1684-05-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1684">1684</year></datestruct>, granted the church and cemetery, in trust, to Thomas, lord Jermyn, nephew to the late earl, and his <pb id="p.280" n="280"> heirs for ever; who thereupon assigned over the church and its appurtenances to sir Walter Clarges, bart. and others, in trust, as a chapel for the use of the inhabitants of that part of the parish of St. Martin's in the Fields. It was accordingly consecrated by Henry Compton, bishop of London, on Sunday, the <datestruct VALUE="-07-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct> in the same year, and dedicated to the honour of God by the appellation of St. James in the Fields.<NOTE><BIBL>Newcourt Report. Eccles. Paroch.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The church being consecrated, and a district for a new parish set out, application was made to parliament in the year <datestruct value="1685"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>, to get the said district made parochial; wherefore the parliament did constitute the same a parish, distinct from, and independent of, that of St. Martin's, and the same to be be called  <QUOTE>the parish of St. James, within the liberty of Westminster.</QUOTE>  Dr. Tenison, vicar of St. Martin's, was appointed the <num value="1">first</num> rector; and by the same authority, he and his successors were incorporated, &amp;c. 
<p>It was also enacted that, after the death or avoidance of the <num value="1">first</num> rector, the patronage or advowson should be in the bishop of London and his successors, and Thomas, lord Jermyn, and his heirs for ever: the <num value="1">first</num> rector to be collated by the bishop, and the next by the lord Jermyn or his heirs; and for ever after the bishop of London to present twice to lord Jermyn's once. 
<p>By the same authority the rector of this parish is seized in demesne, as of fee in right of the church, of a certain toft of ground on the north side of the same in Piccadilly; and likewise of another parcel of ground whereon stood stables, together with <num value="5">five</num> houses in Jermyn-street. These being the glebe belonging to the cure, the rector is authorised to demise the houses thereon by lease, upon an improved rent, without a fine. 
<p>This parish is bounded on the north by St. Mary-le-bourn, on the east by St Anne, and St. Martin, on the south by St. Martin, and on the west by St. George, Hanover-square. 
<p>Its boundary line is as follows: commencing at the south end of the Haymarket, it proceeds northward to Coventry-street, thence up Princes-street and Wardour-street to Oxford-street, along which it takes its course to the west side of Regent-street, which it enters at the east end of Princes-street, Hanover-square; thence to near the beginning of New Burlington-street, where it turns westward and enters Old Bond-street a short distance south of Conduit-street;thence to Burlington Gardens, and down the Arcade, to Piccadilly; it again turns westward to St. James's-street, through Park-place to the Green park; thence southward to Cleveland-row, by the north front of St. James's palace, and south of the houses in Pall-mall to the Haymarket. 
<div2 type=section id="c.6.1"><HEAD>St. James' Church.</HEAD>
 
<p>The plan of the church gives a nave and side aisles, with a square tower at the west end. The walls are built with a dark red brick, with stone dressings, and like the exterior of the generality <pb id="p.281" n="281"> of Wren's churches, it promises little. The west end is made in breadth into a central and lateral divisions; the former is in advance of its aisles, and is principally occupied by the tower, which is in <num value="4">four</num> stories; the <num value="3">three</num> fronts which are clear of the main structure are uniform; in the <num value="1">first</num> story is an arched doorway in the western front, enclosed in an architrave of stone; the key-stone is carved with a shield of arms, <hi rend=italics>(sable)</hi> a crescent between <num value="2">two</num> mullets in pale, <hi rend=italics>(argent)</hi> being the armorial bearings of the princely benefactor, the noble Henry Jermyn, earl of St. Albans; this doorway is repeated in blank, but without the arms, in the flanks; the succeeding story has an arched window enclosed in a stone architrave hi every front, and the succeeding story has circular windows in like manner; the <num value="4">fourth</num> story being clear of the church has an arched window turned in brick in every aspect; a cornice and parapet finish the elevation: the angles are all rusticated. To the square tower succeeds a spire covered with lead; it commences with an octagonal basement, having the clock dials in <num value="4">four</num> of the faces; above this is a small octagon story, having an arch in each face, from the crown of which springs an obelisk, still keeping the same form and ending in a vane. In the west ends of the aisles are blank oval windows, with doorways beneath them, now fronted with shabby porches. The south side is made in height into <num value="2">two</num> stories, the elevation finished by a cornice and parapet. In the centre of the lower story is an entrance, enclosed in a handsome frontispiece of stone, consisting of an engaged column, grouped with pilasters of the Corinthian order, on each side of a doorway, the lintel of which is sustained on cherubic heads; the whole is surmounted by the entablature of the order, the frieze of which is charged with festoons of drapery, and mullets, and crescents, (the cognizance of the Jermyn family) alternating with each other; there are <num value="4">four</num> arched windows in this story, in addition to the doorway, all of which are inclosed in stone architraves, and in the upper story are <num value="5">five</num> arched windows, also enclosed in stone architraves, with sculptured keystones, the centre being a cherub's head, the others consoles. The east front has a spacious Venetian window in the centre; it is in <num value="2">two</num> heights, the lower being of the Corinthian, the upper of the composite order: in each are <num value="2">two</num> columns. In the aisles are oval windows. The north front only differs from the southern already described, in having a window in the place of the doorway. All the angles of the building are rusticated. The interior is in the architect's best style; the square piers on each side the nave are faced with antae, and sustain an architrave cornice of the Doric order, and a low attic, which forms the breastwork of the galleries; from the latter <num value="6">six</num> columns of the Corinthianorder take their rise; the shafts are painted to imitate Sienna marble, with statuary capitals and bases; the outer columns on each side are engaged with the side walls; a rich entablature surmounts every column, stretching across the side aisles, and received <pb id="p.282" n="282"> at its entrance into the wall on a corbel, the designs of which are varied; the cornice serves as an impost to a semicircular arched ceiling, which covers every intercolumniation; it is bounded towards the body of the church by an arch and dies into the side walls: the soffit of each arch is pannelled with a flower in the centre, the arch is enriched with guillochi. The central portion, or nave, is covered with a semicircular arched ceiling, divided by bands springing from the entablatures over the columns and enriched with guillochi; a festoon of drapery occurs over every lateral arch, which forms a square finish above it, and has a pleasing effect; the soffit of the ceiling is pannelled; a narrow division above the chancel is divided into small square compartments, filled with flowers and foliage, the corbels from which it springs are enriched with reliefs of the arms of lord St. Albans. 
<p>An additional gallery at the west end is constructed above the principal <num value="1">one</num>; it contains the organ in a richly carved case, with seated statues of angels in lime tree, and other enrichments; on the front of the gallery is inscribed,  <QUOTE>This organ was the gift of her excellent majesty queen Mary, <datestruct value="1691--"><year reg="1691">1691</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE>  
<p>The altar-screen is peculiarly rich; it is famed for displaying some of the finest of Gibbon's carvings. Over the centre is an elliptical pediment; in the tympanum a pelican between <num value="2">two</num> doves encircled in tendrils; in addition a noble festoon ending in <num value="2">two</num> pendants, which extend nearly the height of the screen, displays all the varied representations of fruit and flowers, in the highest relief, admirably carved in the superior style which marks all this artist's works. These carvings are in lime-tree; the altar rails were formerly a ballustrade; the pilasters marble, enriched with sculptures, and the door oak, finely carved in fillagree work by Gibbons. The ballusters at some recent repair have been replaced by handsome foliage in bronze. At a short distance from the altar-rails is the pulpit, which is situated on the south side of the nave; it is octangular, sustained on a pillar of the same form, and has a light sounding-board and canopy, surmounted by a mitre. The reading and clerk's desks, on the opposite side, are square, and are without ornaments; these, with the pulpit, are more modern than the church. 
<p>The font is composed of statuary marble; it is situated in a large pew below the western gallery; it is of very large proportion, but strikingly handsome in its decorations. The stem is carved into the form of the tree of knowledge, at the foot of which stand our <num value="1">first</num> parents in a state of innocence; the basin is oval and capacious; on the sides are basso-relievi of the following subjects, the whole excellently designed as indicating the fall of man, his subsequent restoration to divine favour, and his regeneration by baptism. The <num value="1">first</num> subject is  <QUOTE>the temptation of Adam and Eve;</QUOTE>  the next,  <QUOTE>the destruction of the world by the deluge;</QUOTE>  the dove is returning with the olive-branch; the <num value="3">third</num> is  <QUOTE>the baptism of our Lord,</QUOTE>  and the last  <QUOTE>St. Philip baptising the eunuch.</QUOTE>  This is <num value="1">one</num> of the few specimens <pb id="p.283" n="283"> of Gibbons' art in marble; for excellence of execution it yields to no work of Greece or Rome, though it is questionable whether <hi rend=italics>the</hi>
exquisitely sculptured basin of St. Margaret's, Lothbury,<NOTE>Described <BIBL>ante, vol. iii. p. <num value="404">404</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> is not more delicately finished than the preset specimen. This font is in a dark and miserable situation, where its beauties cannot be viewed with satisfaction. 
<p>The great east window, from its extent of dull ground glass has a very unpleasing effect; a proposal was made as long ago as <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct> to fill it with a copy of  <QUOTE>the Transfiguration;</QUOTE>  in stained glass after Raphael; a subscription was commenced, and Mr. Backler of Newman-street was employed to make a model; but with an apathy, disgraceful to a parish so rich as St. James's, it still remains incomplete. 
<p>The architect of this church was sir Christopher Wren: the dimensions are as follows:

<p>The monuments are very numerous, but none of very eminent characters or very ancient. 
<p>In the north aisle is a neat marble monument, with a profile bust, to the memory of William Caddick, born Nov. <num value="121738">12,1738</num>, died <datestruct VALUE="1796-10-1"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg=1>1</day>, <year reg=1796>1796</year></datestruct>. 
<p>Against <num value="1">one</num> of the piers in this aisle is a plain tablet to Thomas Denman, M.D. who died <datestruct VALUE="1815-11-26"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=26>26</day>, <year reg=1815>1815</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="83">83</num>.

<p>Against a pier in the same aisle is a neat piece of sculpture, by Westmacott, representing a female reading; it is to the memory of Margaret Bruce, widow of James Hamilton, who died <datestruct VALUE="1818-11-19"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg=19>19</day>, <year reg=1818>1818</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="66">66</num>. 
<p>At the east end of this aisle is an elegant marble tablet to the memory of the rev. Gerrard Andrewes, D.

<p>On the smith side of the altar is a neat marble monument, representing a book open; it is to the memory of James Dodsley, bookseller, and author of  <QUOTE>The Economy of Human Life,</QUOTE>  &amp;c. He died <datestruct VALUE="1797-02-19"><month reg="02">Feb.</month> <day reg=19>19</day>, <year reg=1797>1797</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="74">74</num>. 
<p>At the east end of the south aisle is a neat monument to the <pb id="p.284" n="284"> learned Benjamin Stilling-fleet, who died <datestruct VALUE="1771-12-15"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=15>15</day>, <year reg=1771>1771</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="69">69</num>.

<p>In this aisle is also a neat marble tablet erected in <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct> to the eminent physician, Thomas Sydenham. 
<p>Against the south wall of the tower, without the church, is a stone to the memory of the celebrated dramatist and poet,  <QUOTE>Tom Durfey, dyed Feby ye <num value="16">16</num>, <datestruct value="1723--"><year reg="1723">1723</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE>  
<p>Against the north wall of the tower, on the angle formed by the junction with the west front, is a neat monument formed of a Doric column, on a pedestal, surmounted by a coat of arms; it is in a disgraceful state of decay. Owing to neglect the inscription is now obliterated. 
<p>Against the wall is a neat slab to the memory of John Simco, bookseller, who died <datestruct VALUE="1824-02-3"><month reg="02">Feb.</month> <day reg=3>3</day>, <year reg=1824>1824</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="76">76</num>. 
<p>The statute, erecting this district into a parish, gives the following statement, which, at this distance of time, is both curious and interesting. This parish then comprehended <QUOTE><p>all the houses and grounds, including a place heretofore called St. James's Fields, and the confines thereof, beginning at a house at the south side of the east end of Catherine (alias Pall-mall) street; the south of the roadway, called Tyburn-road, westward, to a house, being the sign of the Plough, at the north-west corner of a lane, called Mary-le-bone lane, including the said house; and from thence proceeding southward, on the east side of the lane to the north-west corner of Crabtree Fields, comprehending the same; and the ground from thence westward, to the north-west corner of <num value="10">Ten</num> Acres-Field, in the occupation of Richard, earl of Burlington, or his assigns, including that field, and the highway between the same; and the garden-wall of the said earl of Burlington, to the north-west corner of the said garden-wall, including that garden, and the mansion-house of the said earl of Burlington, fronting Portugal-street. 
<p>Towards St. James's House, to the middle channel on the south side of a new street called Park-place, comprehending all the east side of St. James's-street to St. James's House, and all the west side thereof, from the said middle channel downwards, as far as the same extends, and including the south side of Park-place to Cleveland-gardens, comprehending the same, and Cleveland-house, and out-buildings; and also the street which leads from the outward gale of the said house, and thence to the said Pall-mall-street, comprehending all the buildings and yards backward to the wall, which encloses part of St. James's Park, which hath been lately made into a garden, extending to a house inhabited by Anthony Verrio, painter; and late by Leonard Girle, gardener; and from thence to the house and garden of Thomas, earl of Sussex, including the same, together with the south side of Warwick-street, to the White Hart inn there.</QUOTE>
In Cleveland-square, westward of St. James's palace, is <pb id="p.285" n="285"> 
<div2 type=section id="c.6.2"><HEAD>Cleveland House</HEAD>
 
<p>Cleveland House, containing the matchless collection of pictures belonging to the marquis of Stafford. 
<p>This is a plain building, but very chaste in its exterior; it has a neat portico of the Doric order. The western end faces the Green Park: the drawing and dining room windows project in <num value="2">two</num> bows. 
<p>The house consists of the following rooms: the new gallery; the drawing room; the Poussin room; the passage room; the dining room; the anti room: the old gallery; the small room; the cabinet room; the library rooms; lady Stafford's apartments, &amp;c.  <QUOTE>All that part of the house west of the old gallery, with the stairs, have been erected by the marquis from designs by C.

The old and new gallery are lighted from the top,</QUOTE>  their extreme length is <num value="215">two hundred and fifteen</num> feet.  <QUOTE> The other apartments, being fitted up and appropriated for domestic purposes, are lighted from the sides.</QUOTE>  The west front, already mentioned, is <num value="72">seventy-two</num> feet. The principal staircase adjoins lady Stafford's apartments; and between this and the back stairs, at the east end of the house, are the library rooms, with a few portraits. 
<p>The cabinet room is a small apartment entered from the back stairs, and leads into the old gallery, which is <num value="113">113</num> feet long, <num value="24">twenty-four</num> broad, and <num value="22">twenty-two</num> high. The new gallery <num value="60">sixty</num> feet long, <num value="26">twenty-six</num> broad, and <num value="20">twenty</num> high.

The rooms on either side are each <num value="39">thirty-nine</num> feet long, <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> broad, and <num value="17">seventeen</num> feet <num value="6">six</num> inches high. 
<p>These respective dimensions being given, will serve to convey to the mind of the reader a pretty correct idea of the space allotted to the noble marquess's collection. 
<p>It is impossible in this work to enter into any thing like detail or enumeration of the several exquisite pictures with which this gallery is enriched. 
<p>The New Gallery contains <num value="29">twenty-nine</num> pictures, mostly, if not entirely, of the Italian school; many of them from the Orleans gallery, at the beginning of the French Revolution despoiled of its treasures, which were brought to this country. 
<p>The Anti-room, or Poussin-apartment, contains <num value="8">eight</num> pictures, by N. Poussin, representing so many different subjects from the sacred writings and Catholic ritual. These subjects are the <num value="7">Seven</num> Sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church; and <num value="1">one</num> purely scriptural piece of  <QUOTE>Moses striking the Rock.</QUOTE>  
<p>The Old Gallery, west end, is filled with about <num value="110">one hundred and ten</num> pictures of the Dutch and Flemish schools; among which is sir Peter Paul Reubens's large allegorical picture of  <QUOTE>Peace and War,</QUOTE>  which formed part of the unfortunate king Charles's collection, and was sold by the saintly rebel, Cromwell, to some picture-dealer <pb id="p.286" n="286"> of Genoa, where it continued till within these <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> years, when is was brought to England, and immediately purchased by the present marquis. 
<p>The noble possessor, with the most laudable and rare liberality, has appropriated <num value="1">one</num> day in the week, (Wednesday, from the hours of <num value="12">twelve</num> to <num value="5">five</num> o'clock,) during the months of May, June, and July, for the public to view the pictures in his spacious gallery, subject to the following regulations:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>No person can be permitted to view the gallery without a ticket; to obtain which it is necessary that the applicant be known to the marquis, or to some <num value="1">one</num> of the family; otherwise he or she must have a recommendation from a person who is. 
<p>Applications for tickets are inserted in a book by the porter, at the door of Cleveland-house, any day except Tuesday; when the tickets are issued for admission on the following day. 
<p>Artists desirous of tickets for the season must be recommended by some member of the Royal Academy. 
<p>It is expected, if the weather be wet or dirty, that all visitors will go in carriages.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Near Cleveland-house stands another noble mansion, the town residence of earl Spencer, in the Green Park. 
<p>This house is a mixture of the Grecian style of architecture, and is highly, though not profusely, ornamented: the statues in front, on the apex and at the base of the pediment, are commanding and graceful; but the pediment itself, according to Mr. Malton,<NOTE><BIBL>Picturesque Tour, p. <num value="108">108</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> is too lofty, and has not the grace and majesty of the low Grecian pediment. The order should have had a greater elevation, sufficient to have included <num value="2">two</num> ranges of windows, or it should not have been returned on the sides of the building.  <QUOTE>This,</QUOTE>  continues this writer,  <QUOTE> is a striking example of the impropriety of employing the Doric order in private houses; its column is too short, its entablature too large, and all its proportions too massy, to admit of such apertures as are necessary to the cheerfulness of an English dwelling. The statues on the pediment and the vases at each extremity, must be mentioned with applause, as they are in a good style, and judiciously disposed.</QUOTE>  
<p>The interior of Spencer-house is not inferior to the outside; but its chief ornament is the Library, which is <num value="30">30</num> feet by <num value="25">25</num>, and is most beautifully ornamented. The chimney-piece is very light, of polished while marble. On <num value="1">one</num> side of the room hangs a capital picture of the nature of witchcraft;  <QUOTE>the expression and finishing is very fine; and the extent of the painter's imagination striking, in drawing into <num value="1">one</num> point such a magnitude of emblems of witchcraft, and all designed with a charming mildness of fancy.</QUOTE>  
<p>It were vain to attempt any description of the contents of this invaluably rich and extensive library: the reader who can afford <pb id="p.287" n="287"> such a treat, may peruse the costly work of Dr. Dibdin.<NOTE><BIBL><title>Bibliotheca Spenceriana; or, a Descriptive Catalogue of the Books printed in the Fifteenth Century, and of many valuable <num value="1">first</num> editions in the library of George John earl Spencer, K.

<p>St. James's-street is a noble and elegant street, leading from St. James's-palace, at the west end of Pall-mall to Piccadilly, opposite Albemarle-street. 
<p>The west side of this street is chiefly composed of stately houses belonging to the nobility and gentry, <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> extensive hotels, bankers, &amp;c. The opposite side consists of elegant shops; which appear to a stranger rather as lounging-places than the resorts of trade and the busy pursuits of merchandize. 
<p>On the west side of St. James's-street several noble houses have been recently erected; near the south end is Arthur's club-house,<NOTE> <QUOTE>A stranger naturally associates with the idea of an hotel, that of a public licensed house, for the reception of individuals and families, for temporary refreshment and accommodation. Hence he would, (as many are) be induced in his walks through St. James's-street, to call, as at any other respectable house of the same name and ostensible destination in the metropolis; but what would be his surprize to find himself abruptly stopt at the door by <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> waiters and door-keepers, earnestly enquiring his business, and when they found that rest and refreshment were his only objects, absolutely refuse him entrance? The fact is, that with <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> exceptions, these hotels are those sinks of vice and dissipation--the bane of human happiness, and domestic peace,--Gaming Houses! I need not add <num value="1">one</num> word more to caution the prudent not to be misled by these spacious houses, with a foreign name. It is not necessary to distinguish the respectable hotels from these haunts of cupidity and dishonesty, now fashionably called Subscription Houses.</QUOTE> --<BIBL><title>Nightingale.</title></BIBL></NOTE> an elegant building of the Corinthian order. The basement is rusticated; the upper story has <num value="6">six</num> attached columns of the Corinthian order supporting an entablature and cornice; the summit finished with a ballustrade. The windows between the columns are large and are covered alternately with arched and angular pediments. Higher up, in the same street, is Fenton's hotel, a large and handsome edifice; and near the top is the  <QUOTE> Temple of Pluto,</QUOTE>  or Crockford's Subscription-house, which will be noticed more particularly hereafter, being in St. George's parish. 
<div2 type=section id="c.6.3"><HEAD>St. James's Square</HEAD>
 
<p>St. James's Square is <num value="1">one</num> of the most elegant squares in the metropolis. It is entered on the south side up a short street out of Pall-mall; on the north it is bounded by streets leading to Jermyn-street, parallel with Piccadilly. It has King-street on the west, and Charles-street on the east. <pb id="p.288" n="288"> 
<p>In the centre is a large circular sheet of water, <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num> feet deep, from the middle of which rises a fine equestrian statue of William III. erected here within these few years. 
<p>Most of the streets between St. James's-square, and the street of the same name, are occupied by hotels, assembly-rooms, and subscription houses. The principal is Willis's suit of rooms, better known as  <QUOTE>Almacks,</QUOTE>  in King-street, in which there are elegant accommodations for nearly <num value="1000">1,000</num> persons. The exterior is plain, even to meanness, but the interior is fitted up in the most costly style. 
<p>Before we finally leave St. James's square, we should not omit to notice <num value="1">one</num> of the houses on the east side. This is Norfolk-house, within the walls of which was born his late majesty, king George the <num value="3">Third</num>. 
<p>It has been observed of this square, that, though it appears extremely grand, its grandeur does not arise from the magnificence of the houses; but only from their regularity, the neatness of the pavement, and the beauty of the basin; and that if the houses were built more in taste, and the <num value="4">four</num> sides exactly correspondent to each other, the effect would be much more surprising, and the pleasure arising from it more just. 
<p>York-street is a short avenue leading to the back of St. James's church, already described. In this street is the house lately occupied by sir Joshua Wedgewood, the ingenious and worthy inventor of numerous kinds of pottery, particularly of a species of porcelain, in imitation of the Etruscan potteries of antiquity. The house, subsequently Wedgewood's warehouse, was at <num value="1">one</num> time the residence of the Spanish ambassador, and the adjoining chapel a Roman Catholic place of worship. When his excellency left the premises, the chapel was converted to the use of various dissenting congregations. 
<p>At the south west termination of Pall-mall is 
<div2 type=section id="c.6.4"><HEAD>Marlborough House.</HEAD>
 
<p>Built in the reign of queen Anne, at the expense of <measure value="40000l." type=currency><num value="40000">40,000</num>l.</measure> It is a very stately brick edifice, ornamented with stone, and built in a peculiar style. The front is very extensive, the wings on each side are decorated at the quoins with stone rustic work. The top was originally finished with a ballustrade, but that has been since altered, and the <num value="1">first</num> story is now crowned with an attic raised above the cornice. A small colonnade extends on the side of the area next the wings; the opposite side of the area is occupied by sundry offices. 
<p>When this structure was finished, the late duchess of Marlborough intended to have opened a way to it, into Pall-mall, directly in front, as is evident from the manner in which the court-yard is formed; but sir Robert Walpole having purchased the house before it, and not being on good terms with her grace, she was prevented from executing her design. <pb id="p.289" n="289"> 
<p>The front next the park resembles the other; only instead of <num value="2">two</num> middle wings, there are niches for statues; and instead of the area in front, there is a descent by a flight of steps into the gardens. 
<p>The interior corresponds with the exterior; and the furniture is exceedingly magnificent. It is at present the residence of prince Leopold, of Saxe Coburg. 
<p>Nearly opposite is the 
<div2 type=section id="c.6.5"><HEAD>British Institution.</HEAD>
 
<p>The Royal Academy bad continued for nearly <num value="40">forty</num> years, fostering modern art, and affording it the opportunity of displaying itself, when an auxiliary sprung up in  <QUOTE>The British Institution for promoting the Fine Arts in the United Kingdom.</QUOTE>  That patron of the arts, alderman Boydell, had previously laid the foundation of a school of British historical painting in the establishment of the Shakspeare Gallery. Whether the plan was too extensive, or the arts were not then so liberally patronized as at present, we know not, but the project failed; and the worthy alderman, in order to indemnify him in some degree for his great losses, obtained leave to dispose of the pictures by lottery, in <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>. The alderman had expended a sum of <measure value="350000l." type=currency><num value="350000">350,000</num>l.</measure> in forming the <num value="1">first</num> gallery of historical paintings in England, and as the failure of success affected him so much, it is perhaps not to be regretted that he did not live to see the treasures he had collected, scattered. The <num value="1">first</num> prize, consisting of all the pictures painted from Shakspeare's work, fell to Mr. Tassie, the dealer in gems; he had taken the ticket of a friend, who had bought <num value="2">two</num>, and wished to dispose of <num value="1">one</num> of them. 
<p>When the Shakspeare Gallery was dispersed, the house was purchased for the British Institution, which had been formed for the exhibition and sale of works of living artists, the display of works of great merit, where artists may study, and the encouragement of art, by offering premiums for such large paintings, as might exceed individual patronage. This Institution has been very successful; and the <num value="1">first</num> year of the exhibition, in <datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, pictures (many of which had previously been before the public) were sold to the amount of <measure value="5500l." type=currency><num value="5500">5,500</num>l.</measure> 
<p>The collections of Reynolds, Hogarth, Gainsborough, Wilson, and many of the choicest productions of the best old and modern masters, generously lent by his majesty, and other distinguished patrons of the art, have since been exhibited at this gallery. There are <num value="2">two</num> exhibitions every year, at this Institution, <num value="1">one</num>, a collection of eminent works of art, of every age and country; the other, the productions of living artists, who send them for exhibition and sale. 
<p>The exterior of the building, which ranges with the houses in Pall-mall, is divided into <num value="2">two</num> stories; the lower has a large doorway with a fan-light between <num value="2">two</num> windows; above each is an antique lyre within a wreath of oak; the upper story consists of <num value="2">two</num> pair of pilasters of the Corinthian order supporting an angular <pb id="p.290" n="290"> pediment. Between the pilasters is a recess, with full figures of Shakspear between Tragedy and Comedy. 
<p>On the south side of Pall-mall is a plain brick building. (No. <num value="100">100</num>) formerly the residence of J. J. Angerstein, esq., a munificent encourager of the fine arts. It is now occupied as the 
<div2 type=section id="c.6.6"><HEAD>National Gallery,</HEAD>
 
<p>And contains a fine collection of ancient and modern paintings; among the most prominent may be noticed Ruben's Rape of the Sabines, Carracci s Virgin and Child, some fine landscapes by Poussin and Claude, Marriage a la Mode by, Hogarth, the Village Festival, and Blind Fiddler, by Wilkie, &amp;c. It is intended by government to build a gallery for these fine specimens of ancient and modern art. 
<p>Opposite Waterloo-place was, until lately, a noble palace:-- 
<div2 type=section id="c.6.7"><HEAD>Carlton House.</HEAD>
 
<p>The facade had a centre and <num value="2">two</num> wings, rusticated without pilasters; an entablature and ballustrade concealed the roof. The portico, which was very handsome, consisted of <num value="6">six</num> columns of the Corinthian order, and supported a pediment with a highly enriched frieze, and within the tympan was the royal arms. 
<p>Before the front, and on a line with the houses of Pall-mall, was a neat screen, forming a colonnade of the Ionic order. 
<p>The apartments on the ground floor, towards the street, were devoted to purposes of state; and consisted principally of the great hall, a magnificent apartment of the purest Ionic order, which led to the octagon vestibule, decorated with marble busts of the late Francis, duke of Bedford, C. J. Fox, lord Lake, and the late duke of Devonshire, by Nollekins; the great staircase, with its unique and splendid gallery; the west ante-room, containing numerous whole-lengths, by Reynolds, and other eminent artists; the crimson drawing-room, <num value="1">one</num> of the most tastefully splendid apartments in London, and in which prince Leopold was married to the late princess Charlotte, embellished with the most valuable pictures of the ancient and modern schools, bronzes, ormoulu furniture, &amp;c. of English workmanship; the circular cupola room, of the Ionic order; the throne room of the Corinthian order; the beautiful ante-chamber: the rose-satin drawing room; and many other splendid apartments, all embellished with the richest satins, carvings, cut-glass, carpetings, of British manufacture. 
<p>On a lower level, towards the gardens and St. James's park, were other equally splendid suite of apartments, used by his majesty for domestic purposes, and his more familiar parties. Most of these. were designed by Mr. Nash. They consisted of a grand vestibule of the Corinthian order, the shafts of the columns being of verd antique, and the bases and capitals richly gilt; the golden drawing-room, of the Corinthian order, entirely gilt; the Gothic dining. <pb id="p.291" n="291"> room, the Ionic dining-room: and the splendid Gothic conservatory; and the library, in this story, filled with a choice collection of the most valuable books. Here were also a valuable collection of cabinet pictures, of the Flemish, Dutch, and Italian schools. 
<p>The taste, elegance, and splendour of these apartments, their furniture and decorations, reflected the highest credit on the taste and patriotism of his majesty, who in every possible instance was pleased to employ native artists in their production. Among the fine English pictures, were some by Reynolds, Lawrence, Hoppner, Beechey, Wilkie, Lonsdale, &amp;c. There were likewise many of Bone's finest specimens of enamelled paintings. The plate-room formed an exhibition that equally astonished foreigners and natives. The palace also possessed the finest armoury in the world, which was so extensive as to occupy <num value="4">four</num> large rooms. In this part of the palace also was the golden throne of the late king of Candy, a seat, large, rude, and massive, with a representation of the sun (to which diamond eyes are given) forming its back. Here, likewise, were the splendid horse-armour and trappings of Tippoo Saib, and the celebrated Murad Bey; and a curious and peculiar suit of mail and plate armour, intermixed, every link and plate of which is inscribed with a verse from the Koran. A riding-house and stables were attached to the rear of the edifice, where there was, besides, an extensive garden, laid out in fine taste. 
<p>The whole of this noble building was taken down in the early part of the year <datestruct value="1828"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>, and a grand square corresponding to Waterloo place is being formed on its site. The houses will be all of the <num value="1">first</num> rate size, and embellished in the most superb style. <num value="1">One</num> at the north-east corner is almost finished; it is to be named the Union Club house. It has a portico of <num value="2">two</num> stories, the lower being Doric, the upper Corinthian. The Athenian club have also a house in course of erection. 
<p>Opposite this square is Waterloo-place and Regent-street, the houses of which are of the <num value="1">first</num> character. This noble street was formed in <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct>, but not finished for many years after. It is undoubtedly the finest avenue in England, but certainly possesses more architectural variety than good taste. 
<p>On the west side of Regent-street, is 
<div2 type=section id="c.6.8"><HEAD>St. Philip's Chapel.</HEAD>
 
<p>This chapel was partly built by a grant of <measure value="2000l." type=currency><num value="2000">2,000</num>l.</measure> from the commissioners for building new churches, the remainder amounting to <measure value="13000l." type=currency><num value="13000">13,000</num>l.</measure> being raised by voluntary subscriptions. The <num value="1">first</num> stone was laid on <datestruct VALUE="1819-05-15"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=15>15</day>, <year reg=1819>1819</year></datestruct>, and it is capable of containing <num value="1500">1,500</num> persons. 
<p>The principal front of this structure, which is situated on the western side of Regent-street, is all that can be seen of the exterior. It is taken from a design of sir William Chambers; the order is the Roman Doric. The portico consists of <num value="4">four</num> fluted columns of <pb id="p.292" n="292"> iron, sustaining an entablature and pediment. The metopes are charged with ox-sculls and paturae, alternating with each other, The portico is flanked by <num value="2">two</num> wings of brick stuccoed: in each are <num value="2">two</num> windows, the lower covered with circular pediments; the cornice is continued from the pediment along each of the wings; and on the atric is an ox-scull between festoons of flowers hanging from the horns. Within the portico are <num value="3">three</num> entrances and <num value="2">two</num> windows on the ground-floor, also covered with circular pediments, and <num value="3">three</num> other windows above, of a square form: behind the pediment is a tower also constructed either wholly or in part of iron. This structure is a copy of the choragic monument of Lysicrates, at Athens, better known as the lantern of Demosthenes. The facade, as will be seen from this description, is liable to many objections. The Grecian tower placed above an Italian portico, reminds the spectator of the freaks of the modern Gothic school; it appears much out of place, and speaks too plainly that it is an addition to the original design; the most objectionable ornaments however for a Christian church are the symbols of pagan sacrifice which accompany the architecture of this edifice. To say the least, such decorations are unmeaning, and are on that account absurd. Was an ancient Roman to be set down in Regent-street, how would he be deceived, on entering the supposed temple, when he should learn, that the deity to whom it was erected, had declared, that his sacrifice was not the blood of bulls, as the frieze of the portico had led him to expect. 
<p>The interior of the chapel is of the Corinthian order, and displays some of the richer features of the Italian school. The galleries, which are attached to the east, south, and north sides, rest on square plinths, and the fronts are pannelled in oak; the same work is continued along the western end, dividing the building into <num value="2">two</num> stories. From the fronts of the north and south galleries rise <num value="4">four</num> Corinthian columns of scagliola; the shafts in imitation of Sienna, the capitals and bases of statuary marble, sustaining a highly enriched entablature, continued round the whole of the interior. These elegant collonades are flanked at their ends, towards the cast and west, by arches and piers; the latter ornamented with pilasters to correspond with the columns, and the key-stones formed into consoles. The architrave and frieze of the entablature are discontinued above each of these arches. Additional galleries are constructed above the aisles, and are fronted with ballustrades, forming a finish to the design. The ceiling of the area of the chapel is in <num value="3">three</num> portions; those above the arches just described, and which consequently form the extreme eastern and western divisions, are elliptically curved, and the coves filled with oblong pannels. The remainder of the ceiling is entirely composed of a dome, supported by <num value="4">four</num> elliptical arches rising from the internal piers of the arches; in the centre of the dome is a circular skylight. The ceilings of the lower galleries are divided into large square pannels, <pb id="p.293" n="293"> each containing an expanded flower. The west end, against which is placed the altar,<NOTE>It is to be noted that in this chapel, the relative situations of the altar and tower are reversed, the former being at the west end, and the latter above the eastern front.</NOTE> is the plainest portion of the building; it has a mean and unfinished appearance. The altar-screen is oak, and consists of <num value="4">four</num> pilasters of the Doric order, with an entablature, the intervals filled with pannelling; above is a large arched window, the head of which is divided from the other portion by the continued entablature; the jambs are flanked by pilasters, and the portion beneath the entablature is made into <num value="3">three</num> divisions by <num value="2">two</num> Corinthian columns, corresponding with those already described. The arched head of the window is filled with stained glass, representing a splendid irradiation surrounding the Hebrew name of the Deity; the rest of the glazing is filled up with dispersed glass. The remainder of the wall at this end of the building is plain, and contains <num value="4">four</num> other windows, which add nothing to the grandeur or beauty of the design, and when contrasted with the other parts of the building, the meanness of this portion cannot fail to strike any observer. 
<p>The eastern end of the church is occupied by a gallery corresponding with the lower galleries at the sides of the church, and an additional <num value="1">one</num> above contains the organ and seats for the charity children. On the front of the lower gallery is inscribed a list of the benefactors to the building. 
<p>The length of this chapel is <num value="84">84</num> feet, breadth <num value="80">80</num>, height of chapel <num value="48">48</num> feet <num value="9">9</num> inches, and of tower <num value="47">47</num> feet. The architect was G. A. Repston, esq. 
<p>Nearly opposite, at the north west corner of Charles-street, is the United Service Club-house, a plain but neat structure, from the designs of R. Smirke, esq. The front, which is in Charles-street, consists of a portico of <num value="4">four</num> Doric columns; above which, on the front of the edifice, is a ridiculous basso-relievo of Fame distributing rewards to our military and naval heroes. 
<p>At the south-west angle of the Haymarket, surrounded with a piazza of the Doric order, is the 
<div2 type=section id="c.6.9"><HEAD>King's Theatre, or Opera House.</HEAD>
 
<p>It was not until the commencement of the last century that Italian music had obtained so high an estimation in England as to receive decided encouragement and support. The <num value="1">first</num> experiment was made at the suggestion and by the influence of sir John Vanbrugh, the architect, who zealously employed his interest and fortune towards the advancement of the Opera, but it did not succeed so well as was expected; and in the course of a few years it was found necessary to support the already embarrassed project by a large subscription, which received the royal patronage and that of the chief nobility. <pb id="p.294" n="294"> 
<p>Sir John Vanbrugh was the founder and architect of the original Opera House. He procured subscriptions from <num value="30">thirty</num> persons of quality at <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">one hundred</num> pounds</measure> each, for building a stately theatre iii the Haymarket. On the <num value="1">first</num> stone that was laid were inscribed the words  <QUOTE>little whig,</QUOTE>  as a compliment to a celebrated beauty (Anne, countess of Sunderland), the toast and pride of that party. The house being finished in <datestruct value="1705--"><year reg="1705">1705</year></datestruct>, it was put by Mr. Betterton and his associates under the management of sir John Vanbrugh and Mr. Congreve, in hopes of retrieving their desperate fortunes: but their expectations were too sanguine. The new house, called the  <QUOTE>queen's theatre,</QUOTE>  was opened with a translated opera, set to Italian music, called  <QUOTE>the Triumph of Love,</QUOTE>  which met with a cold reception.  <QUOTE>The Confederacy</QUOTE>  was almost immediately after produced by sir John, and acted with more success, though less than it was entitled to, if considered merely with respect to its dramatic merit. The prospects of the theatre being unpromising, Mr. Congreve gave up his share and interest wholly to Vanbrugh; who, being now become sole manager, was under a necessity of exerting himself. Accordingly, in the same season he gave the public <num value="3">three</num> other imitations from the French; viz.  <QUOTE>The Cuckold in Conceit,</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>Squire Treeloby,</QUOTE>  and  <QUOTE>The Mistake.</QUOTE>  The spaciousness of the dome in the new theatre, by preventing the actors from being distinctly heard, was an inconvenience not to be surmounted. 
<p>An union of the <num value="2">two</num> companies was projected; and sir John, being tired of the business, disposed of his theatrical concern to Mr. Owen Swinney, who governed the stage till another great revolution occurred. Our author's last comedy,  <QUOTE>The Journey to London,</QUOTE>  which was left imperfect, was finished to great advantage by Mr. Cibber, who takes notice in the prologue of sir John's virtuous intention in composing this piece, to make amends for scenes written in the fire of youth. He seemed sensible of this, when, in <datestruct value="1725--"><year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct>, he altered an exceptionable scene in  <QUOTE>The Provoked Wife,</QUOTE>  by putting into the mouth of a woman of quality what before had been spoken by a clergyman; a change which removed from him the imputation of profaneness. He died of a quinsey, at his house at Whitehall, <datestruct VALUE="1726-03-26"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=26>26</day>, <year reg=1726>1726</year></datestruct>. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1789-06-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>, a few minutes before <num value="10">ten</num> o'clock at night, a firebroke out at the king's theatre in the Haymarket, at the time when many of the performers were practising a repetition of the dances which were to be performed the next evening. The fire burst out instantaneously at the top of the theatre, and the whole roof was in a moment in a flame. It burned with so much rapidity, that while the people were running from the stage, a beam fell from the ceiling. The fire soon communicated to all parts of the house. and, from the nature of the articles with which it was filled, the blaze soon became tremendous. The whole of the structure in a very short time was rendered an entire shell; and its progress was so rapid, that it was impossible to save any material part of its <pb id="p.295" n="295"> contents. A column of fire burst from the roof of the building to an immense height, and with such fierceness, that the Temple, Lincoln's-inn-fields, and every other part of the city equidistant from the spot, was as light as noon-day. The effect of the heat was also such as to be felt in Leicester-fields and St. James's-square. 
<p>From the manner of the flames <num value="1">first</num> appearing, there is strong reason to believe the building was set on fire maliciously, as no person had been employed with any light where it broke out. 
<p>Madame Ravelli had nearly perished: the firemen saved her at the risk of their own lives. A very small part of the wardrobe, and some other few effects, were saved. 
<p>This house had such ill success in its dawn, that when Nicolini and Valentina were sent for, it gave rise to the following epigram : 
<QUOTE><LG type=stanza><L>To emulate Amphion's praise 
<L><num value="2">Two</num> Latian heroes come,

<L>Must still remain unknown, 
<L>Since these poor gentlemen, alas!

<p>The principal sufferer was Mr. Vanbrugh, a descendant of sir John, who had <measure value="800l." type=currency><num value="800">800</num>l.</measure> a year from the property.

<p>In making the vast improvements in <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>, under the control of the new street commissioners, and according to designs and arrangements made by J. Nash, esq. the external of the Opera House underwent a very important change. The ground landlord of the theatre, at the time of making the improvements, was the late Thomas Holloway, esq. of Chancery-lane; and upon his renewing the lease with the commissioners of the crown property, they granted him the additional proprietory of the ground towards Pall-mall, Charles-street, and Market-lane, then a dirty avenue, but now the Royal Arcade. This was granted on the express condition that the building should be finished so as to form an imposing feature in the <pb id="p.296" n="296"> metropolis, and that the public should be accommodated to the utmost extent in the new arrangements, and should be convenienced by a covered way round the whole building. To effect these improvements, Mr. Holloway employed the united talents of Mt. Nash and Mr. G. Repton, the architects. The order of architecture adopted by the above gentlemen was the Roman Doric, and the columns are executed in cast iron, each being the result of a single casting. The entablature is of Bath stone, and the body of the building of brick covered with cement.

<p>The interior is extremely grand and imposing. 
<p>The present form of the boxes, together with the effect of its ornamental beauties, create the most lively images of grandeur in the mind of the auditor: the fronts of the boxes are painted in compartments, a blue ground with broad gold frames: the several tiers are distinguished from each other by a difference in the ornaments in the centre of the compartments. In the <num value="2">second</num> tier are the ornaments of Neptunes, Neriads, Tritons, Mermaids, Dolphins, Sea Horses, &amp;c. &amp;c. On the <num value="3">third</num> tier the ornaments exhibit festoons, and wreaths of flowers, sustained by cherubs. Leopards, Lions, Griffins, &amp;c. are the supporters of the <num value="4">fourth</num>. The fronts of the <num value="5">fifth</num> and <num value="6">sixth</num> tiers nearly correspond with those of the <num value="3">third</num>, The dome presents a sky, in which the flame colour predominates, The <foreign lang=fr>coup d&lsquo;oeil</foreign> of the whole is rich, magnificent, and considerably surpassing its former appearance.

<p>In order that the reader may form an accurate idea of the size of this elegant theatre, we subjoin the dimensions of the most prominent parts of it: the stage is <num value="60">sixty</num> feet in length from the wall to <pb id="p.297" n="297"> the orchestra, and <num value="80">eighty</num> feet in breadth from wall to wall, and <num value="46">forty-six</num> feet across from box to box. 
<p>From the orchestra to the centre of the front boxes, the pit is <num value="66">sixty-six</num> feet in length, and <num value="65">sixty-five</num> in breadth, and contains <num value="21">twenty-one</num> benches, besides a passage-room of about <num value="3">three</num> feet wide, which goes round the seats and down the centre of the pit to the orchestra. The pit will hold <num value="800">eight hundred</num> persons. 
<p>In altitude the internal part of the house is <num value="56">fifty-six</num> feet from the floor of the pit to the dome. 
<p>Each of the <num value="6">six</num> tiers of boxes is about <num value="7">seven</num> feet in depth, and <num value="4">four</num> feet in breadth, and is so constructed, as to hold <num value="6">six</num> persons with ease, all of whom command a full view of the stage; each box has its curtains to enclose it according to the fashion of the Neapolitan theatre, and is furnished with <num value="6">six</num> chairs. The boxes hold nearly <num value="900">900</num> persons. 
<p>The gallery is <num value="42">forty-two</num> feet in depth, <num value="62">sixty-two</num> in breadth, and contains <num value="17">seventeen</num> benches; and holds <num value="800">800</num> persons. The lobbies are about <num value="20">twenty</num> feet square, where women attend to accommodate the company with coffee, tea, and fruit. 
<p>The great concert room is <num value="95">ninety-five</num> feet long, <num value="46">forty-six</num> feet broad, and <num value="30">thirty</num> feet high, and is fitted up in the <num value="1">first</num> style of elegance. 
<p>The subjects from which the operas of this house are generally composed being classical, and founded on the heroic actions of the Greeks and Romans, admit of the most beautiful architectural scenery, as well as those romantic views and clear atmosphere peculiar to the Greek isles and to Italy. Where genius and erudition are united in a scene-painter, he has every opportunity from such subjects to give the public the most brilliant specimens of the pictorial art. The artist employed to embellish this theatre with his pencil being a native of Italy, and well educated in all the customs of foreign theatres, together with a classical mind, has displayed some of the finest specimens of scene-painting known to the public; indeed he has made the best use of grand subjects for the exhibition of the most splendid scenery that can adorn a theatre. 
<p>The opera usually opens for the season in January, and continues its representations on the Tuesday and Saturday of every week until June or July. The doors open a quarter before <num value="6">six</num> and the performance begins at <num value="7">seven</num>. 
<p>On the north side of Titchbourn-street, at the top of the Haymarket, is Week's Museum, which has never been completed. The grand room is <num value="107">107</num> feet long and <num value="30">30</num> feet in height; it is entirely covered with blue satin, and contains a variety of most curious articles of ingenious mechanism. The architect was Wyatt; the painting of the ceiling by Rebecca and Singleton. The most curious articles are the Tarantula Spider, and the Bird of Paradise, in a minute compass, the work of the proprietor.<NOTE><BIBL>Nightingale's Beauties of England, x. part iv. p. <num value="657">657</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>

<p>Golden-square is a short distance north of Piccadilly, along Airstreet, Francis-street, and George-street. It was once called Gelding-square, from the sign of a neighbouring inn; but the inhabitants, disgusted with so vulgar an appellation, changed it to its present name. The access to it is dirty; and it has altogether no very high claims to distinction for its beauty or magnificence. It was built soon after the revolution of <datestruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></datestruct>, in what were then called the Pest-house fields, which remained a dirty waste till within these comparatively few years, when Carnaby-market occupied much of. the western portion of this tract. 
<p>In Pest-house-fields the lord Craven built a lazaretto, which, during the dreadful plague of <datestruct value="1665--"><year reg="1665">1665</year></datestruct>, was used as a pest-house, and hence arose the name. His lordship boldly facing the danger, remained in London during that great calamity; and, as it has been observed of him,  <QUOTE>braved the fury of the pestilence with the same coolness as he fought the battles of his beloved mistress, Elizabeth, titular queen of Bohemia; or mounted the tremendous breach of Creutzuach. He was the intrepid soldier, the gallant lover, and the genuine patriot.</QUOTE>  
<p>Leaving Golden-square and Great Marlborough street on the left, we enter Argyle-street, concerning which, in the General Evening Post of <datestruct VALUE="1736-09-23"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=23>23</day>, <year reg=1736>1736</year></datestruct>, we find the following account:-- <QUOTE><num value="2">Two</num> rows of fine houses are building from the end of Great Marlborough-street through the waste ground and his grace the duke of Argyle's gardens into Oxford-road, from the middle of which new building a fine street is to be made through his grace's house, King-street, and Swallow-street, to the end of Hanover-street, Brook-street, and the north part of Grosvenor-square, the middle of his grace's house being pulled down for that purpose; and the <num value="2">two</num> wings lately added to the house are to be the corners of the street which is now building.</QUOTE>  
<p>This plan was carried into effect, and we have now a very handsome and fashionable street. 
<p>On the east side of Regent-street, are the Argyle concert rooms, The exterior is handsome, <num value="1">one</num> end terminating in a circular front; the basement is rusticated, and the upper story has <num value="6">six</num> attached columns of the Corinthian order sustaining an entablature and ballustrade. Above this is an attic crowned with a spherical dome. The remaining portion presents a plain wall only relieved by several windows with angular pediments. The ground floor is occupied by Messrs. Welsh, music publishers, and a part on the <num value="1">first</num> floor is occasionally fitted up as a French theatre. 
<p>Between Poland-street and Blenheim-street, on the north side of Oxford-street, is 
<div2 type=section id="c.6.10"><HEAD>The Pantheon.</HEAD>
 
<p>This theatre was originally built in <datestruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></datestruct>, and opened on the <datestruct VALUE="1772-01-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>: the designs were by James Wyatt, esq. and near <pb id="p.299" n="299"> <num value="2000">two thousand</num> persons of the highest rank and fashion assembled on this occasion to admire the splendid structure, which contained <num value="14">fourteen</num> rooms, exclusive of the rotunda.

<div2 type=section id="c.6.11"><HEAD>Leicester Fields</HEAD>
 
<p>Leicester Fields, previous to the year <datestruct value="1658"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>, were almost entirely unbuilt; but Leicester house, the site of the late house of that name, is found in Faithorn's Plan. This house was founded by <num value="1">one</num> of the Sydneys, earls of Leicester, after the removal of that family from Sydney house, in the Old Bailey. 
<p>This house was for a short time the residence of Elizabeth, daughter of James I. the titular queen of Bohemia, who, on the <datestruct VALUE="1661-02-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1661">1661</year></datestruct>, here ended her unfortunate life. It was afterwards tenanted by prince Eugene. It was, says Pennant, successively the pouting place of princes. George II., when prince of Wales, lived here several years after his quarrel with his father. His son, Frederick, following his example, succeeded him in this house, and here died. 
<p>Since that time, the late princess dowager of Wales occupied it till she removed to Carlton-house; but, since the commencement of the late reign, it has been occupied by private persons; and was at <num value="1">one</num> time used by sir Ashton Lever, as a Museum of Natural History. 
<p>This museum, was the most astonishing collection of subjects of natural history ever collected, in so short a space, by any individual. To the disgrace of our kingdom, after the <num value="1">first</num> burst of wonder was over, it became neglected: and when it was offered to the public, by the chance of a guinea lottery, only <num value="8000">eight thousand</num>, out of <num value="36000">thirty-six thousand</num> tickets, were sold. Finally, the capricious goddess frowned on the spirited possessor of such a number of tickets, and transferred the treasure to the possessor of only <num value="2">two</num>, Mr. James Parkinson, who generously gave sir Ashton the advantage of <num value="1">one</num> year's exhibition of his lost property; and who by his future attention to, and elegant disposition of the museum <pb id="p.300" n="300"> well merited the favour. Sir Ashton died <datestruct VALUE="1788-01-31"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=31>31</day>, <year reg=1788>1788</year></datestruct>. The museum was subsequently transferred by Mr. Parkinson to the Surry side of Blackfriar's-bridge, where for a time it flourished, but at length once more sunk into neglect, and in the year <datestruct value="1806"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>, was sold in separate lots, in a sale which lasted <num value="40">forty</num> days. 
<p>Leicester-house was pulled down, and the site is now occupied by the new buildings, called Leicester place, leading to New Lisle-street. 
<p>Behind Leicester-house, in the year <datestruct value="1658"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>, stood the Military-yard, occupied by Heury prince of Wales. In the reign of Charles II. this became major Foubert's academy for riding. He afterwards removed it to a house between Carnaby-market and Swallow-street, where an avenue still bears the name of Major Foubert's Passage. 
<p>On the west side of Leicester place is a large house called Saville house, the residence of the patriotic sir George Saville, many years knight of the shire for the county of York. He brought the bill into parliament in favour of the Catholics, which was the pretended ground of the cruel persecution of that body of Christians by the Protestants in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>. 
<p>During these riots, so repugnant to the spirit and conduct of our national church, Saville house was completely gutted, as the mob expressively phrases it. Every thing that was valuable was destroyed, and the life of the worthy and liberal minded owner shortened by the threats of the rioters. 
<p>Saville house is at present principally occupied by an extensive carpet manufacturer; a wing of it belonging to Miss Linwood's exhibition of needle work. About <num value="20">twenty</num> years ago <num value="2">two</num> large rooms were added to this house; in which the greatest portion of this most ingenious lady's pictures are exhibited. This exhibition is <num value="1">one</num> of those which has not ceased to create an interest after its novelty had in a measure subsided. 
<p>This novel style of picturesque needle-work is the invention of a Leicestershire lady, and consists, at present, of copies of the finest pictures of the English and foreign schools of art,  <QUOTE> possessing all the correct drawing, just colouring, and light and shade of the original pictures from whence they are taken.</QUOTE>  
<p>The place is entered from Leicester-square, up a very handsome flight of steps, which lead, between <num value="2">two</num> fine statues, and <num value="2">two</num> Ionic pillars, to a magnificent staircase. 
<p>The principal room is a fine long gallery, of most excellent proportions, hung round with scarlet broad cloth, and rich imitations of long gold bullion tassels, and Grecian borders. The pictures are hung only on <num value="1">one</num> side of this room; the other side being occupied by the fire-place, a door leading into another room, and the windows; the seats of which are most elegantly fitted up, with sofas and settees, to match the hangings. 
<p>At the farther extremity of the room is a very large mirror over ZZZ SO FAR <pb id="p.301" n="301"> a rich throne, and beneath a splendid canopy, of sattin and silver. There is a guard, consisting of a slight iron railing, in front of the pictures, to keep the company at the requisite distance for properly viewing them. 
<p>At the north east corner of this square, Mr. Burford and before him Mr. Barker have for several years exhibited panoramic views of towns, cities, sea- fights, battles, &amp;c. This species of painting has been, not inaptly, called  <QUOTE>the perfection of perspective.</QUOTE>  The views are generally changed about twice a year. 
<p>On the east side of Leicester-square was the residence of the inimitable Hogarth; it is now called Sablonier's hotel; and is a large and elegant house, frequented by foreigners. 
<p>Adjoining to this house, lived the celebrated surgeon, John Hunter, who formed a fine anatomical museum, which has been purchased by government, and placed under the care of the college of surgeons. This museum is classed in the following order: the parts constructed for motion; the parts essential to animals; respecting their own internal economy; parts superadded for purposes concerned with external object; parts designed for the propagation of the species, and the maintenance and protection of the young.<NOTE><BIBL>Hugh. Lond. iv. <num value="330">330</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The west side of Leicester-square was at <num value="1">one</num> time the residence of sir Joshua Reynolds; near him lived another eminent man, William Cruikshank, esq. 
<p>In the centre of the square is a fine equestrian statue of king George I. richly gilt. It originally stood in the park at Canons, in Hertfordshire. 
<p>Proceeding from the north-west corner of Leicester-square, we enter Coventry-street. This street derives its name from Coventry-house, the residence of the lord keeper Coventry, secretary of state, who died here in <datestruct value="1686--"><year reg="1686">1686</year></datestruct>. 
<p>The Gaming-house, noticed in Faithorn's Plan, is said to have stood on this site; and lord Clarendon<NOTE><BIBL>Hist. Reb. sub. an <datestruct value="1640--"><year reg="1640">1640</year></datestruct>.</BIBL></NOTE> mentions a house of this name in the following words:  <QUOTE>Mr. Hyde,</QUOTE>  (meaning himself,)  <QUOTE>going to a house called Piccadilly, which was a fair house for entertainment and gaming, with handsome gravel walks, with shade, and where an upper and lower bowling-green, whither many of the nobility and gentry of the best quality resorted for exercise and recreation.</QUOTE>  This seems to have been the same house with that mentioned by Gerrard, in his letter to the earl of Strafford, dated <datestruct VALUE="1635-06--"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1635">1635</year></datestruct>.<NOTE><BIBL>Vide ante, p. <num value="278">278</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>It were greatly to be wished that the manly and rational exercise of bowling were revived, in lieu of the card-table, and the dice, and particularly of boxing matches, walking matches, &amp;c. &amp;c. now so greatly in vogue. 
<p>Piccadilly is so called from Piccadilly-house, which stood on the site of Sackville-street. This was a sort of repository for ruffs, <pb id="p.302" n="302"> when there were no other houses here. Ruffs were also called turnovers, and capes. 
<p>The street was completed, as far as the present Berkeley-street, in the year <datestruct value="1642"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct>. 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> good house that was built in this street was 
<div2 type=section id="c.6.12"><HEAD>Burlington House</HEAD>
 
<p>Burlington House, the noble founder of which said that he placed it there,  <QUOTE>because he was certain no <num value="1">one</num> would build beyond him.</QUOTE>  
<p>It is on the north side eastward of Bond-street; and was greatly improved by the celebrated earl,  <QUOTE> whose taste in the fine arts did the nation so much honour.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Malcolm Lond. <foreign lang=la>ubi supra.</foreign></BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>It is unfortunately surrounded with a brick wall, so that scarcely the roof, or even the chimney tops, can be seen from the opposite side of the street. 
<p>The house is very large; and if the wall were removed would be a great ornament to this part of the town. It has a stone front remarkable for the beauty of its design and workmanship. A circular colonnade of the Doric order joins the wings; but there appears to be a disproportion between the size of the house and this superb colonnade. 
<p>This house was left to the Devonshire family, on the express condition, that it should not be demolished. 
<p>It was constructed by Boyle, earl of Burlington; <num value="1">one</num> of whose daughters and heiresses having married the late marquis of Hartington, brought this superb mansion, together with Chiswick, to the duke of Devonshire. 
<p>In <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>, Burlington house was purchased of the duke of Devonshire, by his uncle, lord George Cavendish, who repaired all those parts of the building erected by lord Burlington; and by raising the Venetian windows of the south front to the height of the others, completed his designs for this facade. His lordship also took down and rebuilt the whole house, except the front elevation, and some rooms connected with it; restored the terraces and terrace steps in the garden, and converted a narrow slip of ground on the west side into a passage, with a range of shops on each side, called Burlington arcade, which, during the season, is <num value="1">one</num> of the most fashionable promenades at the west end of the town. 
<p>The state apartments of Burlington house are on the <num value="1">first</num> floor. The ceiling of the saloon was painted by sir James Thornhill. The whole of this fine suite of apartments are adorned with a valuable collection of paintings by the old masters. 
<p>Eastward of Burlington house is 
<div2 type=section id="c.6.13"><HEAD>The Albany,</HEAD>
 
<p>Originally inhabited by lord Melbourne, and afterwards by the late duke of York, in compliment to whose <num value="2">second</num> title it has its <pb id="p.303" n="303"> present name. After his royal highness quitted possession of it, this place was purchased by the present proprietors, who built on the gardens, and converted the whole into chambers for the casual residence of the nobility and gentry, who had no settled town residence. 
<p>It is a thoroughfare, (though not a public <num value="1">one</num>,) under a large covered way, from Piccadilly into Vigo lane, opposite Saville-street. 
<p>Near this place stood the town residence of Robert Spencer, earl of Sunderland, whom Mr. Pennant, and others, have described as acting in the most treacherous manner toward his sovereign, James II.; and who at the very time he sold him to the prince of Orange, prompted and encouraged the king to those measures which involved him and his family in ruin. 
<p>M. Rapin,<NOTE><BIBL>Hist. Eng. ii. <num value="771">771</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> however, seems disposed to do more justice to the character of Sunderland on this subject. Speaking of those who are persuaded,--that had the king followed other measures than those which the prime minister, Sunderland, treacherously advised, he would have been able to have maintained his crown, this historian says, that to accuse him of an intention to betray the king, it must be supposed that he could have foreseen what the king himself did not: in a word, that he was secretly engaged with the prince of Orange, of which, however, there is no positive proof. 
<p>The most prominent and interesting object is the 
<div2 type=section id="c.6.14"><HEAD>Egyptian Hall,</HEAD>
 
<p>Formerly the London Museum. This astonishing collection of natural and artificial curiosities originated with, and belonged to Mr. William Bullock, of Liverpool, in which town he <num value="1">first</num> opened the collection, then on a comparatively small scale, for public exhibition. He afterwards removed to London, where he met the success his great efforts and admirable ingenuity so richly merited. The whole was, however, sold by auction, and the rooms have been variously occupied since. The present edifice was erected in the year <datestruct value="1812"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>. It is beyond the powers of delineation to attempt any thing in the shape of a description of the front of this most singular piece of architecture. It is in the Egyptian style of building and ornament; the inclined pilasters and sides being covered with hieroglyphics. The model is taken from the temple of Dendyra, in Upper Egypt. 
<p><num value="1">One</num> side, on the ground floor, is occupied by Mr. Willis, music publisher; the north side by Dr. Reece, who has denominated it the medical hall, and it is m fact an extensive and well-laid out apothecary's or druggist's shop. Between the <num value="2">two</num> shops, runs a handsome passage leading to several capacious apartments intended for exhibition rooms. The architect was P. F. Robinson, esq. 
<p>Jermyn-street runs parallel with Piccadilly from St. James's-street, to the Haymarket; it is a good street, and has many substantial <pb id="p.304" n="304"> houses. This street owes its name to the brave Henry Jermyn, earl of St. Alban's, who also gave name to St. Alban's-street, running parallel with Market-lane from the market to Pall Mall. The earl had a house at the head of the street bearing the name of his earldom. He was supposed to have been privately married to the queen dowager of Charles, Henrietta Maria, who  <QUOTE>ruled the <num value="1">first</num> husband, a king; but the <num value="2">second</num>, subject, ruled her.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Pennant.</BIBL></NOTE> Her fear of him was long observed before the nearness of her connection was discovered. 
<p>Regent-street which bisects Jermyn-street north and south,turns to the west a short distance north of Oxford-street, and takes a segmental circuit, known as the Quadrant; this portion isparticularly elegant, both sides of the road having a continued colonnade of the Doric order; the columns supporting their proper entablature. The roof is formed into a promenade for the residents, being guarded towards the street by ballustrades, and is approached by the windows of the <num value="1">first</num> floors which are formed as doorways. At the west end of this Quadrant, and directly facing the main street to Pall-mall, is the County Fire office, a handsome building, the basement rustic, from which rises <num value="6">six</num> attached columns of the Corinthian order, supporting an entablature and cornice, the whole finished with a seated figure of Britannia. Between the columns are large windows with pedimental heads. It was built by Mr. Abraham, the design being a copy of Inigo Jones's water front of old Somerset House. 
<div1 type=chapter id="c.7" n="7"><HEAD>History and Topography of the Parish of St. Anne, Westminster.</HEAD>
 
<p>The parish of St. Martin in the fields having greatly increased, the numerous inhabitants, for want of places of worship, were deprived of an opportunity of publicly celebrating the divine offices. The inhabitants and owners of the newly erected buildings, therefore, applied to the bishop of London to appoint them a proper spot of ground in Kemp's field whereon to erect a church, and set out a churchyard for a common cemetery. 
<p>This request being readily agreed to by his lordship, the inhabitants, under sanction of an act of parliament, erected the present edifice. 
<p>After the church had been raised to a considerable height, the district for the intended parish was settled with the vestry of St. Martin's in the fields: and in the year <datestruct value="1678"><year reg="1678">1678</year></datestruct>, it was created into a distinct parish, and consequently discharged from all manner of <pb id="p.305" n="305"> dependence upon that of St. Martin's, in all respects, as if it had never belonged to the same, to be called the parish church of St. Anne, within the liberty of Westminster; with a right of choosing parish officers, to make rates, and in all other respects to act as the inhabitants of the other parishes within the city and liberty of Westminster. 
<p>The act which granted these privileges also empowered the bishop of London to appoint the <num value="1">first</num> rector, and he and his successors be enabled to sue and be sued as an incorporate body; and to purchase lands in mortmain not exceeding the yearly rent of <measure value="120l." type=currency><num value="120">120</num>l.</measure> 
<p>The rector and his successors were also empowered to exercise the same authority as other rectors, and to enjoy the like oblations, &amp;c. as the vicar of St. Martin's enjoys, and also an annuity of <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">100</num>l.</measure> to be annually assessed upon the parishioners on Easter Tuesday, by the churchwardens, and <num value="3">three</num> or more substantial householders, by a pound-rate, not exceeding eightpence upon every personal estate, to be confirmed by <num value="2">two</num> justices of the peace, residing within the city or liberty of Westminster; and to be collected by such persons as the assessors shall yearly nominate, who are to pay the same to the churchwardens, and they to the rector, quarterly, upon pain of imprisonment. 
<p>The act makes several other usual provisions, as the appointment by the rector, with the consent of the parishioners, of a parish clerk, &amp;c. 
<p>By this act, also, the rector and his successors are, in right of the church, entitled in fee to a parcel of ground, then called King's Field, but now King-street, Soho, of the length of <num value="213">213</num> feet, and depth of <num value="45">45</num> feet, with a power of granting building leases, for the term of <num value="41">forty-one</num> years, at <measure value="4s." type=currency><num value="4">four</num> shillings</measure> per foot annually, fronting the street; and at the expiration of that term, the rector to devise the houses thereon, for the term of <num value="40">forty</num> years, upon a reasonable improved rent, without taking a fine. 
<p>Though by this act of parliament this district was converted into a parish, and the method of its government thereby settled, yet no provision being made therein for finishing the church and steeple, the parishioners were reduced to a worse condition than at the time of petitioning. They therefore found it necessary to apply to parliament for a power to raise money for the completion of their pious intentions; for the erection of a rectory house, and other parochial works. 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1685"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct> it was accordingly enacted, that towards raising the sum required, the bishop of London should be authorised, by an instrument under his seal, to constitute <num value="30">thirty</num> persons to be commissioners for finishing the church and steeple, and all other works essential to the completion of the parish. After they had so completed it, they were to become vestry-men of the new parish during their lives, or till they removed, or were dismissed for malpractices. <pb id="p.306" n="306"> 
<p>These commissioners were empowered to raise the sum of <measure value="5000l." type=currency><num value="5000">5,000</num>l.</measure> (over and above what the pews should be sold for) in <num value="4">four</num> years, at <num value="16">sixteen</num> quarterly payments, clear of all deductions ; towards raising which sum, all tenants to be rated at least <num value="1">one</num> <num value="5">fifth</num> of the sum charged upon landlords. 
<p>The church being finished, it was, together with its cemetery, consecrated by Henry, bishop of London, on the <datestruct VALUE="1685-03-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> day of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>, and dedicated to the mother of the blessed Virgin. 
<p>The rector of this parish, in lieu of tithes, receives from his parishioners an annuity of <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">100</num>l.</measure>; which, together with the glebe, surplice fees and Easter book, amount to about <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">300</num>l.</measure> per annum. But the parish being taken out of that of St. Martin's, the rector pays neither <num value="1">first</num> fruits, nor tenths to the king, nor procurations to the bishop, or archdeacon; and being not in charge is consequently without valuation in the king's books. Indeed, this is the case with all the other parishes within this city and liberty, St. Martin's in the fields and St. Mary-le-Strand excepted. 
<p>This parish is bounded on the north by St. Mary-le-bone, on the west by St. James, on the south by St. Martin's in the fields, and on the east by St. Giles. Its exact bounds are as follows: commencing at the east end of Oxford-street, it turns southward down Crown-street, thence eastward to West-street, to St. Martin's-lane, down which it pursues its route to Newport-street, down Castle-street, along Bear-street, across Leicester-square to Spur-street, up Whitcombe-street, Princes-street, and Wardour-street to Oxford-street, where it turns eastward to the point of starting. 
<div2 type=section id="c.7.1"><HEAD>St. Anne's Church.</HEAD>
 
<p>The principal front of this church, contrary to custom, is the eastern it abuts on Macclesfield-street. facing Church-street, and the building is situated in a spacious burying ground. 
<p>The plan gives a nave and side aisles, with a tower attached to the west end, and at the eastern a chancel flanked by vestibules. The walls are brick with rusticated angles, and the roof is tiled. The east front consists of a centre and wings: in the former is a large arched window. The elevation is finished with a pediment, in the tympanum of which is a circular window. The side elevations contain doorways, crowned with pediments, and surmounted by circular windows; the upright--of each finishes with half a pediment, raking up to the central division; the flanks are uniform, they respectively contain <num value="2">two</num> tier of windows, in the lower <num value="4">four</num>, and in the upper <num value="5">five</num>; the former are low and arched in an ellipsis, the upper are arched circularly. All the windows are merely openings in the brick wall, without any ornamental stone-work. Near the west end is a doorway, fronted by a porch tastefully carved in oak. The elevation finishes with a cantilever cornice. The west end, in its general features, resembles the opposite front. In the centre is a square tower of brick, carried up to the roof of the church <pb id="p.307" n="307"> in the plainest style, pierced with windows where occasion required. The story which is clear of the main edifice is more ornamental; the angles are canted off and finished <foreign lang=la>in antis</foreign>; in every face are <num value="2">two</num> Doric columns, and the whole is crowned with an entablature; the intercolumniations filled in with weather boarding. Above this story the steeple takes a most singular and curious form, insomuch as to render it an object of ridicule throughout the metropolis. Upon the square story is a platform of <num value="3">three</num> steps, upon which is placed a cylindrical addition crowned with copper, and pierced with a band of circular windows. On the crown of this portion are <num value="3">three</num> other steps, on which a kind of bell-shaped pedestal sustains a globe, to which is affixed <num value="4">four</num> dials. Above this odd-looking conclusion, which the architect thought would scarce make a finish, is a kind of pyramidal addition of iron work, ending in a vane. However destitute of invention the architect's genius appears to have been, he has shown his fondness for variety in the choice of his materials, of which there are <num value="4">four</num> different sorts in this singular structure, viz. brick, stone, copper, and iron, in succession. The interior is approached by the entrances in the flanks, and by others in vestibules at the east end; which latter contain stairs to the galleries. The division between the nave and aisles is made by square piers, ornamented with pilasters of the Doric order, which sustain, with the intervention of pedestals, <num value="4">four</num> insulated and <num value="2">two</num> engaged columns of the Ionic order; the capitals have wreaths of foliage hanging from the volutes; the columns are surmounted by their entablature; the frieze is convexed, and enriched with a continuous wreath of acanthines, broken by grotesque masks above the centre of each intercolumniation, and by cherubic heads over each column; the ornamental portions hitherto described are executed in wood. The ceiling of the nave is an arched vault, the curve of which is cycloidal; it is made into divisions, corresponding with the intercolumniations by ribs pannelled with coffers and roses, and the intervals occupied with square moulded pannels; the ceiling of the aisles is horizontal. A gallery is constructed above the side aisles, which also extends across the west end; the front is pannelled and rests on the piers. A secondary gallery at the west end contains the organ and seats for the charity children. The altar is situated within a semicircular niche at the east end; it is parted from the church by a bold arch, with a sculptured key-stone. The ceiling is a half dome, with a richly pannelled soffit; the pannels occupied With branches of palm and other foliage. The altar screen is of the Doric order; it sweeps to the form of the recess, and is made into divisions by <num value="2">two</num> columns and pilasters; above the columns are urns. Besides the usual inscriptions are paintings of Moses and Aaron; the whole has a mean appearance, being formed of wood Painted white, with gold mouldings. The east window contains <num value="5">five</num> octagon medallions, painted with the following subjects:--<num value="1">1st</num>. Our Saviour between a crown of thorns, and another of triumph; and <pb id="p.308" n="308"> <num value="4">four</num> saints, distinguished by their legends inscribed beneath them: 
<QUOTE lang=la>S&lsquo;tus Petrus, Ap.</QUOTE> <QUOTE lang=la>S&lsquo;s. Johannes, Ap.</QUOTE> <QUOTE lang=la>S&lsquo;tus Paulus, Ap</QUOTE>. Beneath the last is <QUOTE lang=la>S. Jacob&lsquo; Ma&lsquo;. Apo&lsquo;.</QUOTE>
between a chalice and an urn. The colours are very vivid and the figures well painted. The pulpit and reading-desk are situated on opposite sides of the nave, in front of the chancel. 
<p>The font is a neat basin of veined marble on a pedestal, and is situated on the south side of the church. 
<p>On the south side of the chancel is a handsome mural monument inscribed to the memory of the right hon. Grace Pierpont, daughter to the marquis of Dorchester, who died <datestruct VALUE="1703-03-25"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=25>25</day>, <year reg=1703>1703</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="68">68</num>. Above the inscription is a whole length statue of the deceased, between <num value="2">two</num> weeping cherubs, beneath a handsome canopy supported by <num value="2">two</num> twisted columns. On the same side, but lower, is a neat basso-relievo of a female representing religion, with a book open at St. James, i. <num value="27">27</num>. It is to Mrs. Anne Fountain. 
<p>On the north side of the chancel is a monument, with a half-length effigy to Mrs. Diana Farrel, who died <datestruct VALUE="1686-09-17"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=17>17</day>, <year reg=1686>1686</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="22">22</num>.

<p>Soho is an extensive tract of ground, occupied by numerous streets in the neighbourhood of Leicester-fields, up to Oxford-street, and abutting on Golden-square on the western side. <pb id="p.309" n="309"> 
<p>Soho-square has a very pleasing and somewhat rural appearance. In the centre is a large area within a handsome iron railing, inclosing several trees, shrubs, and a pedestrian statue of king Charles II. at the feet of which are figures emblematical of the rivers Thames, Trent, Severn, and Humber. They are in a most wretchedly mutilated state, and the inscriptions on the base of the pedestal quite illegible. 
<p>At the north-east corner is the house which formerly belonged to the earls of Carlisle, and which subsequently became a place of resort for masquerades, balls, assemblies, &amp;c. The grand saloon was converted into a Roman Catholic chapel, and is now called St. Patrick's chapel. 
<p>This square has risen into considerable notice, by a very extensive, novel, and curious establishment, founded by John Trotter, esq. a gentleman of considerable opulence and respectability, residing in this place. This institution is denominated a  <QUOTE>bazaar,</QUOTE>  a well known oriental term for a kind of fixed fair or market. 
<p>The premises (originally used by the store-keeper-general, and part of which are now occupied by this concern, are very commodious and spacious, containing a space of nearly <num value="300">300</num> feet by <num value="130">130</num>, from the square to Dean-street on <num value="1">one</num> hand, and to Oxford-street on the other, consisting of several rooms, conveniently and comfort ably fitted up with handsome mahogany counters, extending not only round the sides, but in the lower and upper rooms, forming a parallelogram in the middle. These counters, having at proper distances flaps or falling-doors, are in contiguity with each other, but are respectively distinguished by a small groove at a distance of every <num value="4">four</num> feet of counter, the pannels of which are numbered with conspicuous figures. 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> room, which is entered from the square, is <num value="62">sixty-two</num> feet long, and <num value="36">thirty-six</num> broad. The walls are hung with red cloth, and at the ends are large mirrors, a conspicuous clock, fire-places, &amp;c. The principal sale is in jewellery, toys, books, prints, millinery, &amp;c. and is entirely conducted by females. 
<p>This square also derives celebrity from being the town residence of the late venerable and excellent sir Joseph Banks, whose whole life was supereminently devoted to science, and the diffusion of almost every branch of useful knowledge. 
<p>Soho square was formerly called King-square, and it occupies about <num value="3">three</num> acres, but has been greatly altered since the original disposition of the ground; then a fountain of <num value="4">four</num> streams fell into a basin in the centre, where now stands the worn-out statue already described. It was once called Monmouth-square, the duke of Monmouth living in the <num value="2">second</num> house; and there is a tradition that, on the death of the duke, his admirers changed it to Soho, being the word of the day at the battle of Sedgmoor. The house was purchased by lord Bateman; after which it was let on building leases, and a row of houses erected, called Bateman's-buildings, on the south side <pb id="p.310" n="310"> running into Queen-street. The name of the unfortunate duke is still preserved in that of Monmouth-street, now celebrated only for. its old clothes, shoes, &amp;c. and shop cellars. 
<div1 type=chapter id="c.8" n="8"><HEAD>History and Topography of the parish of St. Paul, Covent Garden.</HEAD>
 
<p>This parish is bounded on the north and west by St. Martin's in the fields, on the east and south by St. Mary-le-Strand. Its particular bounds are as follow: commencing at the east end of Exeter-street it proceeds northward on the east side of Brydges and Bow-streets, thence on the north side of Hart-street, turns south on the east side of Bedfordbury, to the south side of Chandos-street, and onwards to Southampton-street, which it crosses, and enters Burleigh-street; it then proceeds in a northerly direction to Exeter-street; down which it proceeds to Catherine-street, where we commenced. 
<div2 type=section id="c.8.1"><HEAD>St. Paul's Church.</HEAD>
 
<p>The parochial church of St. Paul, Covent-garden, was erected early in the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century as a chapel of ease to St. Martin's in the fields. In a lease, dated the <datestruct VALUE="1631-03-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1631">1631</year></datestruct>, grated by Francis, <num value="4">fourth</num> earl of Bedford, mention is made of a parcel of ground then laid forth for a new church-yard, which shows that the erection of a church was at least in contemplation at that period. 
<p>It was designed and built by Inigo Jones at the charge of the above-named earl, the expense being <measure value="4500l." type=currency><num value="4500">4,500</num>l.</measure> It was intended for the accommodation of the inhabitants of the new buildings in the vicinity. Through a squabble about the future patronage between the parochial vicar (a Mr. Bray) and the generous founder of the chapel, it remained for  <QUOTE>some years unconsecrated,</QUOTE>  as stated by the inhabitants in a petition to king Charles I. on the <datestruct VALUE="1638-04-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1638">1638</year></datestruct>. The result was that the chapel was to be created by parliament a parochial church; but in the mean time it was to remain as a chapel of ease, subordinate to the vicar, who was to nominate a curate with an annual salary of <measure value="100bmark" type=currency><num value="100">100</num> marks</measure>; but in consideration of the earl having built the church, and a residence for the minister, to whom he designed to allow the liberal salary (for the period) of <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">100</num>l.</measure> the king appointed that the earl and his heirs should have power to nominate a preacher. Articles of agreement were subsequently entered into between the earl, the litigious vicar, and others, and on the <datestruct VALUE="-09-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></datestruct> in the above year, the earl signed his act of donation of the church, the plot of ground connected with it <pb id="p.311" n="311"> being described as <num value="251">251</num> feet in length from east to west, and <num value="146">146</num> feet <num value="3">3</num> inches from north to south. On the following day the church was consecrated and dedicated to St. Paul the Apostle. Thus were the pious and liberal intentions of the  <QUOTE>good earl,</QUOTE>  as the founder was emphatically styled, impeded by that bane of the church of England, clerical patronage. 
<p>The ensuing troubles probably hindered the obtaining of the purposed act of parliament, as it was not till <datestruct value="1645"><year reg="1645">1645</year></datestruct> that the district attached to the chapel was created a parish by an ordinance of the parliament.<NOTE>William, <num value="5">fifth</num> earl of Bedford, and his brothers, John and Edward Russell, esqrs. were abated <measure value="7000l." type=currency>&pound; <num value="7000">7,000</num></measure> from the fines they had incurred by violating the act to prevent the increase of buildings, in consideration of the parties having built the church.</NOTE> On the restoration of king Charles II. the ordinance was rescinded as illegal; and an act of parliament was passed which separated the church and parish from St. Martin's in the fields, and vested the patronage in William, earl of Bedford, and his heirs and assigns. By this act the rector was to have <measure value="250l." type=currency><num value="250">250</num>l.</measure> a year, and the curate <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">50</num>l.</measure> The church was repaired about the year <datestruct value="1727"><year reg="1727">1727</year></datestruct>, by that tasteful nobleman, the earl of Burlington, out of respect to the building as a work of Inigo Jones. 
<p>An absurd story is told by Walpole about the earl having directed Jones to build a barn, to which the architect replied he would build the handsomest barn in England. This story is too ridiculous to merit confutation. The whole proceedings of the founder were marked by an air of liberality superior to the meanness which the order would impute to him. 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1788"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct> the entire building was repaired by the parish, and an ashlaring of Portland stone was then added to the walls in lieu of the plaster which had previously covered them; and at the same time the rustic gateways imitated by Jones from Palladio, which, like the church, were brick and plaster, were rebuilt in stone. The expence of this repair was <measure value="11000l." type=currency><num value="11000">11,000</num>l.</measure> 
<p>On Thursday, <datestruct VALUE="1795-09-17"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg=17>17</day>, <year reg=1795>1795</year></datestruct>, a fire broke out in the west end of this church, said to have been occasioned by the neglect of the plumbers engaged in the repairs of the building. The whole interior, organ, clock, vestry room, &amp;c. were destroyed, and several adjoining houses damaged. The roof was entirely of wood, and considered an inimitable piece of architecture. The whole was formerly insured at the Westminster fire-office for <measure value="10000l." type=currency><num value="10000">10,000</num>l.</measure> but the insurance had expired <num value="12">twelve</num> months, and not being renewed, the loss fell entirely upon the parish.<NOTE>The original cost of the building was <measure value="6500l." type=currency><num value="6500">6,500</num>l.</measure> Its repairs, about <num value="6">six</num> years previously to the fire, were charged at <measure value="11000l." type=currency><num value="11000">11,000</num>l.</measure> The parishioners paid <num value="7">seven</num> and a half per cent. for those repairs; and through this accident, occasioned by neglect, there arose an accumulation of at least <num value="25">twenty-five</num> per cent. upon the rents.</NOTE> Notwithstanding this unfortunate circumstance, the parishioners determined on restoring the church, and Mr. Hardwick, the ingenious architect, who directed <pb id="p.312" n="312"> the previous repairs, was again employed to effect the restoration. The church, before its partial destruction, contained several monuments, among which were those of sir Peter Lely, <datestruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></datestruct>; William Stokeham, M. D. <datestruct value="1698--"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>; sir John Baber, &amp;c. 
<p>To the credit of Mr. Hardwick the present structure maybe taken as an excellent copy of the ancient edifice. The plan is a parallelogram with a portico at the east end, and <num value="2">two</num> wings attached to the western. The eastern is the principal front; it is occupied by a deeply recessed portico composed of <num value="2">two</num> Tuscan columns, bold massive and severe in their character, and by the pilasters of the flank walls of the church, which are continued to the front of the portico and finished in antis; the whole is surmounted by an architrave and cantilever cornice of immense projection, and crowned by a pediment, which in the pure style of the ancient temples, really finishes the roof; the raking cornice is also marked by the same boldness of projection which characterizes the horizontal <num value="1">one</num>; in the tympanum is a clock dial; the flanking walls are pierced with arches, and at the back of the portico is a large false doorway lintelled and covered with a cornice resting on consoles; the slab which fills in the vacancy is thus inscribed:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>The church of this parish having been destroyed by fire on the xviith day of September A.D. M.DCCXCV, was rebuilt and opened for divine service on the <datestruct VALUE="-08-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, A. D. MDCCXCVIII.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Above this doorway is a circle in blank, and on each side is a circular headed window with a doorway beneath, the latter most probably an addition at the last repair. The flanks have each <num value="4">four</num> lofty arched windows, the elevations being finished with the cantilever cornice continued from the front, and the eaves of the roof; the wings are more for convenience than ornament; they have doorways in the eastern front, and windows in their side walls; the southern is a porch, and contains a staircase; the northern is a vestry; the west front of the church has no portico; in other respects it is a copy of the eastern <num value="1">one</num>; the great door is still in use, and in consequence the smaller doorways beneath the windows are omitted; the turret which is raised upon the roof, is scarcely better than may be found in almost every mews; it is square and crowned by a cupola; its meanness is derogatory to the building. The interior is very plain and has a quaker-like appearance; it produces therefore disappointment when contrasted with the simple grandeur of the outside; the ceiling is horizontal, and rests on a block cornice which forms the finish to the side walls; it is pannelled by mouldings of no very great projection, into circles and other figures; in a large circle which forms the centre is the Hebrew name of the Deity in a glory and clouds. A gallery of oak, sustained on fluted Doric columns of the same, occupies the east, west and north walls; in the western portion is the organ, which is more properly ornamented than any other part of the church. The altar screen placed against the centre of the eastern wall consist of a stylobate <pb id="p.313" n="313"> sustaining <num value="4">four</num> pilasters of the Corinthian order surmounted by an entablature and pediment; in the intervals the usual inscriptions, with the sacramental cup, and other subjects in relief. On the raking cornice of the pediment, an urn and pedestal, with an angel reclining on each side; the sculptor was the late Thomas Banks, R. A. 
<p>The pulpit and desks are placed in <num value="1">one</num> group in front of the altar rails. The font is situated in a pew on the south side of the church; it is a small basin of white marble on a shaft of red. 
<p>There are several monuments in this church. In the south aisle is a neat marble tablet, with masks of tragedy and comedy, &amp;c. inscribed as follows:--

<p>In the south gallery is a basso-relievo of Britannia, with a couching lion pointing to an inscription- <QUOTE>The British Constitution, founded by wisdom, is supported by concord.</QUOTE>  It is to the memory of John Bellamy, esq. the founder of the Whig club; he died <datestruct VALUE="1794-09-29"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=29>29</day>, <year reg=1794>1794</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="63">63</num>.

This monument is by Flaxman; both were erected by and at the expence of the Whig club of England. 
<p>To have witnessed this church in its former state, with the hand of the original architect visible in its interior as well as exterior features, would have been indeed a treat; the exterior is nearly the same as originally designed, and was but the interior distinguished by an equal degree of bold simplicity, plain and unornamented, but in no instance descending to meanness, the architectural connoisseur might place this building by the side of St. Stephen, Walbrook, and challenge the world to produce a superior design to either. 
<p>The palladian gateways to the cemetery are equally beautiful with the church, and admirably harmonize with the main structure; they are exceedingly simple, consisting of an arched entrance between <num value="2">two</num> pilasters crowned with an entablature and pediment; although the design is Palladio's, the church is sufficient to shew that Jones did not borrow it from a defect of invention. In the northern <pb id="p.314" n="314"> church-yard is buried a number of actors, formerly belonging to the different metropolitan theatres in the neighbourhood.

<p>The ground on which this parish is built was formerly fields, thatched houses, and stables. The garden belonged to the abbot and monks of Westminster, whence it was called Convent Garden, a name since corrupted into Covent, and sometimes Common Garden. At the dissolution of religious houses it fell to the crown, and was given <num value="1">first</num> to Edward duke of Somerset; but soon after, upon his attainder, reverted to the crown; and Edward VI. granted it in <datestruct value="1552--"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct> to John earl of Bedford, together with a field, named the <num value="7">Seven</num> Acres, which being afterwards built into a street, is, from its length, called Long Acre. 
<p>Here is a large square, called 
<div2 type=section id="c.8.2"><HEAD>Covent Garden Market.</HEAD>
 
<p>It contains <num value="3">three</num> acres of ground, and is the best market in England for herbs, fruit, and flowers. It is surrounded by a wooden rail, and a column was formerly erected in the middle, on the top of which were <num value="4">four</num> sun dials. At the present time, (<datestruct VALUE="1828-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>), a new and elegant market is being formed in place of the present. It will have a sunk area, and the ground floor will be arranged in the best manner. 
<p>There is a magnificent piazza on the north side of this square, designed by Inigo Jones, which, if carried round according to the plan of the architect, would have rendered it beyond dispute <num value="1">one</num> of the finest squares in Europe. There was another piazza at the southeast corner; but that being consumed by fire, has not been rebuilt on a similar plan with the other sides. 
<p>At the north-east corner of Covent Garden market is 
<div2 type=section id="c.8.3"><HEAD>Covent Garden Theatre.</HEAD>
 
<p>This handsome theatre possesses a patent, originally granted to sir William Davenant, and under which successive companies acted at the theatres in Dorset-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields; nor was it until <datestruct value="1733--"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>, that a theatre was opened in Bow-street, Covent Garden. In <datestruct value="1730--"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>, Mr. Rich, who had formerly had the direction of Drury-lane theatre, and afterwards that of Lincoln's-inn-fields, took the lease of the site of the present theatre at the rent of <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">100</num>l.</measure> <pb id="p.315" n="315"> per annum, and opened his house in <datestruct value="1733--"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>. It held before the curtain about <measure value="200l." type=currency><num value="200">200</num>l.</measure>; the longitudinal diameter of the auditory from the stage to the back wall of the boxes, being <num value="66">66</num> feet. The above receipt was thought very considerable in <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>; but to augment it, the custom was (until the time of Garrick) to build numerous seats upon the stage, where a large body of auditors were accommodated. 
<p>Over this theatre Mr. Rich presided until the year <datestruct value="1761"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>, having been for <num value="50">fifty</num> years the manager of a company under the patent granted by Charles II. In <datestruct value="1767--"><year reg="1767">1767</year></datestruct>, Messrs. Colman, Harris, Powell, and Rutherford, purchased the theatre of the heirs of Rich for the sum of <measure value="60000l." type=currency><num value="60000">60,000</num>l.</measure> The management was confided to Mr. Colman, but the partners subsequently quarrelling, Mr. Harris purchased all the shares except Powell's. 
<p>Various improvements were made in the interior of this theatre, and in <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>, Mr. Harris expended <measure value="25000l." type=currency><num value="25000">25,000</num>l.</measure> upon it, under the direction of Mr. Holland, architect. For some years Drury-lane had an advantage over Covent Garden, in possessing the talents of Mrs. Siddons, and her brother, John Philip Kemble, who did so much to rescue the stage from the ridiculous and barbarous costume which had hitherto disgraced it: but in the year <datestruct value="1800"><year reg="1800">1800</year></datestruct>, this company gained a great accession of strength in the person of George Frederick Cooke, whose talents and dissipation made him so long an object of public admiration and regret. 
<p><num value="3">Three</num> years afterwards, Mr. Kemble purchased a <num value="6">sixth</num> share of Covent Garden theatre for <measure value="22000l." type=currency><num value="22000">22,000</num>l.</measure> and was soon after constituted stage manager instead of Mr. Lewis, who had filled that post for several years, with great credit to himself and advantage to the concern. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1808-09-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>, this theatre, with all that it contained, was completely burnt to the ground,--and so rapid were the flames, that they threatened destruction to the whole neighbourhood. Several houses caught fire, and were reduced to ruins, and the walls of the theatre falling, <num value="20">twenty</num> persons were killed. No time was lost in rebuilding this house, the <num value="1">first</num> stone of which was laid on the <datestruct VALUE="1808-12-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>, by his present majesty, then prince of Wales. In <num value="10">ten</num> months this immense edifice was finished, and opened to the public on the <datestruct VALUE="1809-09-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, with the tragedy of Macbeth, when a new danger threatened the proprietors, who, having built the theatre at the expense of <measure value="150000l." type=currency><num value="150000">150,000</num>l.</measure>, sought an indemnity, by raising the price of admission. This was warmly resisted by the public; and for more than a month the theatre was a scene of continued riot and confusion, which is known by the name of the  <QUOTE>O. P. (old prices) war.</QUOTE>  At length a compromise was effected; but the injury done to the theatre, and the loss sustained by other causes, was long felt by the proprietors. 
<p>The architect, Mr. Smirke, has taken for his model the finest specimen of the Doric, from the ruins of Athens, the grand temple <pb id="p.316" n="316"> of Minerva situated in the Acropolis. The principal front in Bow-street exhibits a magnificent portico, which, though magnificent, is greatly inferior to the Athenian original. 
<p>It consists of <num value="4">four</num> columns of the Doric order, fluted, and without bases, supporting an entablature and pediment, and elevated upon a flight of steps. The whole front is enclosed by iron rail-work, and the upper part is decorated by basso-relievo representations of the ancient and modern drama. 
<p>The ancient Drama. In the centre <num value="3">three</num> Greek poets are sitting; the <num value="2">two</num> looking towards the portico are Aristophanes, representing the old comedy, and (nearest to the spectator) Menander representing the new comedy. Before them Thalia presents herself with her crook and comic mask as the object of their imitation. She is followed by Polyhymnia playing on the greater lyre, Euterpe on the lesser lyre, Clio with the long pipes, and Terpsichore, the muse of action, or pantomime. These are succeeded by <num value="3">three</num> nymphs, crowned with the leaves of the fir-pine, and in succinct tunics, representing the hours or seasons governing and attending the winged horse Pegasus. 
<p>The <num value="3">third</num> sitting figure in the centre, looking from the portico, is Aeschylus, the father of Tragedy; he holds a scroll open on his knee; his attention is fixed on Wisdom, or Minerva, seated opposite to the poet: she is distinguished by her helmet and shield. Between Aeschylus and Minerva, Bacchus stands leaning on his fawn, because the Greeks represented tragedies in honour of Bacchus. Behind Minerva stands Melpomene, or Tragedy, holding a sword and mask; then follow <num value="2">two</num> furies, with snakes and torches, pursuing Orestes, who stretches out his hands to supplicate Apollo for protection. Apollo is represented in the quadriza, or <num value="4">four</num>-horsed chariot of the sun. The last described figures relate to part of Aeschylus' tragedy of Orestes. 
<p>The modern Drama. In the centre, (looking from the portico) Shakespeare is sitting; the comic and tragic masks, with the lyre, are about his seat; his right hand is raised, expressive of calling up the following characters in the Tempest: <num value="1">first</num>, Caliban, laden with wood; next, Ferdinand, sheathing his sword; then Miranda, entreating Prospero in behalf of her lover; they are led on by Ariel above, playing on a lyre. This part of the composition is terminated by Hecate, (the <num value="3">three</num>-formed goddess) in her car, drawn by oxen, descending. She is attended by lady Macbeth, with the daggers in her hands, followed by Macbeth turning in horror from the body of Duncan behind him. 
<p>In the centre (looking towards the portico) is Milton, seated, contemplating Urania, according to his own description in the Paradise Lost. Urania is seated facing him above; at his feet is Sampson Agonistes chained. The remaining figures represent the Masque of Comus; the <num value="2">Two</num> Brothers drive out <num value="3">three</num> Bacchanals with their staggering leader Comus. The Enchanted Lady is seated in the <pb id="p.317" n="317"> chair, and the series is ended by <num value="2">two</num> tigers representing the transformations of Comus's devotees. 
<p>The grand front of this theatre may perhaps be considered as <num value="1">one</num> of the most correct buildings which adorn this metropolis, uniting grandeur with classical taste. Mr. Smirke has avoided the error which almost all our modern architects have fallen into, that of sacrificing the unity of a whole to a multiplicity of details, and thus fatiguing the mind of the beholder, without producing that delight which can only result from simplicity and harmony of parts. 
<p>The grand entrance to the boxes is under the portico in Bow-street. To the left of the vestibule is the grand staircase; which, with its landing, form the central <num value="3">third</num> part of a hall, divided longitudinally by <num value="2">two</num> rows of insulated Ionic columns in porphyry; this conducts to the ante-room, with its porphyry pilasters. The doors on the right open into the grand saloon, or box-lobby, which is ornamented in a similar style, and assumes something of the air of an antique temple. There is another handsome but inferior entrance from Covent-garden, by a staircase with a double flight. 
<p>The interior of the theatre is somewhat larger than the late house, and it differs from those before built, in the form, which nearly approaches to the horse-shoe, which has been understood to prove favourable to hearing; the circles of boxes are <num value="3">three</num> in number, with a row of side boxes on each side above them, on a level with the <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shilling</measure> gallery; immediately behind them rise the slips, whose fronts form a perpendicular line with the back of the upper side boxes. The <measure value="1s." type=currency><num value="1">one</num> shilling</measure> gallery in the centre ranges with the fronts of the slips, the whole assuming the circular form, and upholding a range of moderately sized arches, which support the circular ceiling; the latter is painted to resemble a cupola, in square compartments in a light relief. From the centre depends a magnificent cut glass chandelier, lighted by gas. 
<p>The stage is of admirable dimensions in height, breadth, and especially in depth. No boxes, except those over the side doors, are suffered to intrude upon the proscenium. 
<p>On either side of the proscenium are <num value="2">two</num> lofty pilasters in scagliola, with light gilt capitals, between which are the stage-doors, managers boxes, &amp;c. These support an arch, the soffit painted in light relief, from which descends the crimson drapery over the curtain. Above is a bold and simple entablature, with the royal arms resting on its centre. 
<p>The entablature, the devices, and the whole frontispiece, are in the same light relievo as the cupola. The <num value="3">third</num> circle of boxes (under the <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shilling</measure> gallery) <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> in number, was at <num value="1">first</num> exclusively devoted to private subscribers; but the number of these have since been reduced to <num value="8">eight</num>. 
<p>These boxes are separated by a close partition; and each of them is entered through a close square ante-chamber from the corridor. 
<p>The saloon attached to this circle is in the same style as the <pb id="p.318" n="318"> public saloon; but finished with a beautiful light kind of verd antique, instead of porphyry. 
<p>The royal entrance is by an open court at the west end of the theatre from Hart-street, which will admit the carriage to the door of the private stair-case leading to the apartments provided for his majesty. 
<p>To the foregoing descriptions of this theatre we shall now add a description of the saloon to the private boxes, with some general remarks on this building. 
<p>It has been justly objected by critics, that the Temple of Minerva, from which the design of this theatre has been taken, was not altogether a proper model for a modern place of amusement, the <num value="1">one</num> requiring awful solemnity, the other splendour and elegance. This remark is more strongly exemplified in the decorative part of the interior, which is not adapted to a theatre, being too massy as well as too plain. 
<p>This defect is equally striking in the saloon to the private boxes, where <num value="4">four</num> heavy columns of the Paestum order are introduced, <num value="2">two</num> at each end of the room; behind them is a circular recess, with equally heavy chimney-pieces in the centre. On either side of the room are projecting pedestals supporting <num value="8">eight</num> antique plaster figures representing heathen deities, as Bacchus, Apollo, Venus, Ceres, Minerva, Flora, &amp;c. Between these figures are seats, covered with crimson, which produce a pleasing and striking effect. Over the chimney-pieces, and in the centre of the room facing the windows, are placed the busts of Homer, Virgil, and Milton. 
<p>Facing the side windows are <num value="2">two</num> doors exactly similar in design to the windows in the front of Bow-street; in which also too great plainness prevails. These doors are the entrance into the saloon from the vestibule. 
<p>Though it must be acknowledged that there is something grand in the general appearance of this saloon, yet it certainly wants lightness and elegance, especially as it is appropriated to the reception of people of the <num value="1">first</num> fashion in the country.

<p>In Bow-street is the principal office of police for London: it is a plain building, and the interior possesses no claim to description. This office will be removed to a more spacious building near St. Martin's church. 
<div1 type=chapter id="c.9" n="9"><HEAD>History and Topography of the Parish of St. Mary-le-Strand.</HEAD>
 
<p>This parish is bounded on the north by the parishes of St Martin in the Fields, and St. Paul's Covent Garden, on the south and west by the precinct of the Savoy, and on the east by the parish of St. Clement Danes. 
<p>Its precise boundaries are as follows: commencing at Waterloo bridge, the boundary traverses the east side of Wellington-street to the Strand, along which it proceeds westward to Burleigh-street, along Exeter-street and White Hart-yard to Drury-lane; thence through part of Wych-street, and on the west side of Newcastle-street to the Strand, and thence down Strand-lane to the river side. 
<div2 type=section id="c.9.1"><HEAD>St. Mary-le-Strand.</HEAD>
 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>Where the tall May-pole once o&lsquo;erlooked the Strand, 
<L>But now, (so Anne and piety ordain) 
<L>A church collects the saints of Drury-lane.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The old church which bore the above name, was situated on the south side of the Strand, but it was destroyed, without any compensation to the parishioners, who were obliged to join themselves to the congregations of the adjoining districts. This they were compelled to do till the year <datestruct value="1733"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>. The act for erecting <num value="50">fifty</num> new churches having passed some years before, <num value="1">one</num> was appointed for this parish, the <num value="1">first</num> stone of which was laid by James Gibbs the architect, on the <datestruct VALUE="1714-02-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1714">1714</year></datestruct>. The steeple was finished on <datestruct VALUE="1717-09-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> <month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1717">1717</year></datestruct>, but the church was not consecrated till the <datestruct VALUE="1723-01-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1723">1723</year></datestruct>, when it was called St. Mary-le-Strand, although from thence to the present time, it has been popularly <pb id="p.320" n="320"> known by the designation of the <hi rend=italics>New Church.</hi> The benefice is a rectory in the gift of the bishop of Worcester. The following prefatory remarks from the writings of the architect, will very appropriately precede our description of the edifice:-- <QUOTE>The New Church in the Strand,</QUOTE>  says he, <QUOTE><p>called St. Mary-le-Strand, was the <num value="1">first</num> building I was employed in after my arrival from Italy, which being situated in a very public place, the commissioners for building <num value="50">fifty</num> churches (of which this is <num value="1">one</num>) spared no cost to beautify it. It consists of <num value="2">two</num> orders, in the upper of which the lights are placed; the wall of the lower being solid, to keep out noises from the street, is adorned with niches. There was at <num value="1">first</num> no steeple designed for that church, only a small campanile, or turret for a bell, was to have been over the west end of it: but at the distance of <num value="80">eighty</num> feet from the west front there was a column, <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num> feet high, intended to be erected in honour of queen Anne, on the top of which her statue was to be placed. My design for the column was approved by the commissioners, and a great quantity of stone was brought to the place for laying the foundation of it; but the thoughts of erecting that monument being laid aside upon the queen's death, I was ordered to erect a steeple instead of the campanile <num value="1">first</num> proposed. 
<p>The building being then advanced <num value="20">twenty</num> feet above ground, and therefore admitting of no alteration from east to west, which was only <num value="14">fourteen</num> feet, I was obliged to spread it from south to north, which makes the plan oblong, which otherwise should have been square. I have given <num value="2">two</num> plates of another design I made for this church, more capacious than that now built: but as it exceeded the dimensions of the ground allowed by act of parliament for that building, it was laid aside by the commissioners.</QUOTE><NOTE><BIBL>Book of architecture, p. vii.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The plan of the church is a parallelogram, with a semicircular bow at the east end and a corresponding pavilion at the western <num value="1">one</num>; there are no columns within the building. The walls are entirely built with Portland stone, and ornamented with a degree of profusion unknown to modern churches. The elevation is divided throughout into <num value="2">two</num> stories, an expedient of the architect to give a greater height to the building, which the confined dimensions could not have allowed, had <num value="1">one</num> order only been employed; this arrangement has been censured as a defect both by Ralph<NOTE><BIBL>Critical Review of Public Buildings, p. <num value="37">37</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> and Gwynn,<NOTE><BIBL>London and Westminster Improved, p. <num value="46">46</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> and probably by every critical writer who may have written on this church, but in so doing, they have shown more critical nicety than either candour or judgment, for no impartial spectator can fairly come to any other conclusion, than that this is an expedient suggested and enforced by the confined site; if it has therefore destroyed the simplicity of the building, the architect is not answerable for it, as he could adopt no other mode to give a superior elevation to his structure. <pb id="p.321" n="321"> 
<p>The entire building stands on a plinth, which is continued throughout; in the west front a flight of steps leads to a pavilion or portico, occupying the central division of the lower story, the plan of which is a semicircle, and it is composed of <num value="4">four</num> Ionic columns surmounted by the entablature of the order, and crowned by a low dome, on the vertex of which is an urn; within the portico is an arched doorway; in the lateral divisions are windows. The order of the upper story is Corinthian; in the centre is an arched window, between <num value="2">two</num> pairs of engaged columns, crowned with the entablature, and surmounted by a pediment; the lateral divisions contain niches; they are finished with ballustrades and have urns at the angles; this story has also its stylobate, which, with the entablatures, are continued throughout the edifice; the angles of the building, and all the openings, being finished in antis. The steeple is a very inferior production, but Gibb's apology for its erection, already given, disarms criticism of its sting; greatly is it to be regretted that the monumental column of queen Anne was abandoned, and that the commissioners for building the church, had neither good taste nor good feeling enough to cause it to be erected. The plan of the steeple is a parallelogram, having its longest sides in a line with the western front of the church; the elevation consists of <num value="3">three</num> diminishing stories, each of which has its slylobate, having a circular aperture in the dado. In the <num value="1">first</num> story the opening in the stylobate is covered with a pedimental cornice sustained on consoles; the superior elevation is of the Corinthian order, and is enriched with pilasters in pairs on each side of an arched window, in the west and east fronts, and with <num value="2">two</num> insulated columns in front of each of the flanks; on the cornice are urns; the <num value="2">second</num> story only differs in respect of the order, which is composite. The circle in the pedestal has the clock dial inscribed on it. The <num value="3">third</num> story has buttresses at the angles, and in each aspect is an arched window; the whole is finished with a high bell-shaped cupola, somewhat resembling the west towers of St. Paul's cathedral; a vane of metal is fixed on the crown. The flanks of the church are uniform, and are made respectively into <num value="7">seven</num> divisions by engaged columns; in the intercolumniations of the lower story are circular niches covered with pediments resting on consoles; in the extreme divisions windows supply the place of the niches. The <num value="2">second</num> story has large arched windows in the intercolumniations; above the central <num value="1">one</num> is an elliptical pediment, and over <num value="2">two</num> others angular ones ; on acroteria above the pediments are vases, and the upright of the Other divisions is furnished with a ballustrade with vases set upon it. The entablatures being made to break above the intercolumniations, is perhaps the most serious fault in the structure; it destroys the uniformity and fritters the design into a multitudinous assemblage of little parts. 
<p>The eastern front is strikingly beautiful; the centre is occupied by the circular chancel, to which the side divisions form very <pb id="p.322" n="322"> agreeable wings. The orders are here indicated by pilasters; in the lower story the chancel has <num value="3">three</num> arched windows in lieu of niches, and in the upper, niches supply the place of windows; the side divisions have doorways in the lower story, and windows in the upper, corresponding in the style of their decorations with the flanks; the elevation is finished as in the other fronts. The face of the pilasters are richly carved with foliage in relief, and festoons cover the heads of the windows; the spandrils, and, indeed, every portion of the building where ornament can be applied, being profusely decorated. The area in which the church stands is enclosed with an iron railing of a massive character, on a dwarf wall; the principal gate is destroyed, and a watch-house built between the piers: the latter are square in plan, enriched with sculpture in the faces, and surmounted with urns. 
<p>The interior is injured by the additional pews which have been set up in the chancel and aisle to accommodate a larger congregation than the church was originally intended for, and the appearance, until lately, was impaired by the dirty state of the roof and ornaments, the church not having been repaired since <datestruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>. At the west end are <num value="4">four</num> columns of the Corinthian order, disposed in pairs at the sides of the entrance; they are elevated on lofty pedestals, and surmounted by an entablature, which extends from side to side of the church. Upon the cornice is a ballustrade, which forms the front to a gallery containing the organ and seats for charity children. The side walls are divided in height into <num value="2">two</num> stories, the order of the lower being Corinthian, the upper composite; the lower story is divided by pilasters in pairs, situated below the piers of the windows above, the intervals being pannelled: the upper story has also pilasters on the piers of the windows. The east end has a large circular arch in the centre fronting the chancel; on each side are <num value="2">two</num> Corinthian columns, corresponding in appearance with those at the western end; they are surmounted by their entablature and a pediment, in the tympanum the arms of queen Anne in relief. The body of the church is covered with a low semi-elliptical vaulted ceiling, the face of which is decorated in a style of the greatest elegance. It is divided into compartments respectively equal in breadth to the windows and their piers, and filled alternately with square and lozenge shaped pannels, most superbly enriched with mouldings, the soffits occupied by flowers; the pulpit and reading-desks are situated in the angles formed by the contraction, of the breadth of the building at the chancel; the pulpit is hexagonal, with ogee front, and sustained on a large pillar of the same form; the whole were formerly grouped against the south wall. The chancel occupies the centre of the east end, being situated in a splendid niche; the <num value="1">first</num> division has an arched and pannelled ceiling, the residue is a half dome ribbed and pannelled, the soffits containing reliefs of clouds, &amp;c.; the altar screen of oak is very plain, and no commandments are inserted on it, this being the only <pb id="p.323" n="323"> parochial church in London in which the omission is made. The practice of setting up these inscriptions in churches is of no further use than to injure, most seriously, in many instances, the architecture of the building, a consideration which a century ago allowed a deviation in this instance to pass unnoticed, though at the present day the practice is most pertinaciously adhered to, although a mere compliance with the <hi rend=italics>letter</hi> of the canon is held sufficient, the inscriptions being, in most instances, either written in an improper place, or so painted as to be scarcely legible. On the side walls are <num value="2">two</num> paintings, the subject of <num value="1">one</num> being the  <QUOTE>Agony in the Garden,</QUOTE>  the other  <QUOTE>the Salutation of Our Lady,</QUOTE>  the subjects selected to allow of a resemblance in the characters, the principal figure and an angel forming the subject in each; the artist's name is inscribed in the frames, 
<QUOTE lang=la rend=caps>Brown, Pinx</QUOTE>. The chancel is rendered dark from the smallness and paucity of its original windows, and which is increased by the dead glass with common-place paintings of the chalice, &amp;c. set up in <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>. 
<p>The font is situated in the central aisle; it is a plain circular basin of white marble, on a pillar of the same. 
<p>No monuments were allowed to be set up in the church until J. Bindley's, esq. F. S. A., which is a plain tablet. He died <datestruct VALUE="1818-09-11"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=11>11</day>, <year reg=1818>1818</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="81">81</num>. He was for <num value="53">fifty-three</num> years a commissioner of stamps. 
<p>The whole of the interior is at the present time under repair.<NOTE><datestruct VALUE="1828-10--"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>.</NOTE>
The pannels on the walls are painted in imitation of Sienna marble, and the pilasters, &amp;c. veined marble. The ceiling of the nave and chancel is white, with a French white ground, which has a very chaste and elegant appearance. 
<p>A most serious accident happened at this church on the proclamation of peace in <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>. Just as the heralds came abreast of this place, a stone railing which runs round the roof of the church, adorned with stone urns at equal distances, and on which a man on the outside, in the bow on the eastern end, happened to be leaning his arm upon the urn before him, fell off. Newcastle-street, the end of Holywell-street, and the southern side of the Strand, all commanded a view of the spot; and all the windows being crowded, and the attention being drawn to that quarter, several of the spectators saw the stone in the commencement of its fall, and raised a loud shriek. The church being very high, this notice excited an alarm before the stone reached the ground, and several of the people below ran from their situations, but whether into, or out of the danger, they did not know. <num value="3">Three</num> young men were crushed in its fall. The <num value="1">one</num> was struck upon the head, and killed upon the spot; the <num value="2">second</num> so much wounded that he died on his way to the hospital; and the <num value="3">third</num> died <num value="2">two</num> days after. A young woman was also taken away apparently much injured, and several others were hurt; but whether by flying splinters, or the pressure of their <pb id="p.324" n="324"> companions, they did not know. The urn, which weighed about <measure value="200l." type=currency><num value="200">two hundred</num> pounds</measure>, struck in its descent the cornice of the church, and carried part of it away; but this was the only obstruction which it met in its fall. An officer of the church went up to ascertain the man whose hand was upon the urn when it tumbled over. He had fallen back and fainted upon its giving way.. He was taken into custody; but no blame was imputable to him. The urn stood upon a socket; and the wooden pin which runs up the centre being entirely decayed, consequently broke off, with the pressure of the man's hand, as he was in the act of leaning forward. The stone broke a large flag to pieces in the area below, and sunk nearly a foot into the ground. 
<p>At the digging the foundation for the present church, the virgin earth was discovered at the depth of <num value="19">nineteen</num> feet; whereby if appears that the ground in this neighbourhood originally was not much higher than the Thames, therefore this place was truly denominated the Strand, from its situation on the banks of the river. 
<p>On the south side of the Strand, and nearly opposite the church, is 
<div2 type=section id="c.9.2"><HEAD>Somerset House.</HEAD>
 
<p>On the site of this extensive pile of buildings formerly stood the elegant palace, built about the year <datestruct value="1549"><year reg="1549">1549</year></datestruct>, by Edward Seymour, duke of Somerset, uncle to Edward VI. and protector of England; who, to make room for it, besides demolishing St. Mary's church, and the inns and town residences of the bishops of Chester and Worcester, sacrificed part of the conventual church of St. John of Jerusalem, Clerkenwell, the tower and cloisters on the north side of St. Paul's, with the charnel houses and adjoining chapel, to furnish materials for the new structure; even the beautiful pile of Westminster abbey was only rescued from the sacrilegious dilapidations by immense contributions. No recompense was made the owners for these robberies; and, strange as it may appear, among the numerous articles exhibited on the duke's attainder, not <num value="1">one</num> accused him of sacrilege; his accusers and judges were deeply involved in the rapacious plunder, and therefore forbore to tax him with what must have recoiled on their own seared consciences. The architect of the fabric is supposed to have been John of Padua, who was termed  <QUOTE>deviser</QUOTE>  of buildings to Henry VIII. It seems that he was the cause of introducing regular architecture into these realms, about the same period as Hans Holbein, and his allowance was the grant of a fee of <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">two</num> shillings</measure> per diem. The architecture of Somerset-house was <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest specimens of the Italian style in this country; and displayed a mixture of barbarism and beauty. The back front, and the water-gate leading from the garden to the river, were of a different character, and erected from the designs of Inigo Jones, about the year <datestruct value="1623"><year reg="1623">1623</year></datestruct>, together with a chapel, intended for the use of the infauta of Spain, when the marriage between her and prince Charles was in contemplation. <pb id="p.325" n="325"> 
<p>Somerset-house had devolved to the crown by the protector Somerset's attainder; and queen Elizabeth often resided here. Here also Anne of Denmark, queen of James I. kept her court. As Charles II. did not find it compatible with his gallantries that his queen should be resident at Whitehall, he lodged her during some part of his reign in this palace. This made it the resort of the Roman catholics; and possibly, during the fanatic rage of the nation at that period against the professors of her religion, occasioned it to have been made the pretended scene of the murder of sir Edmondbury Godfrey, in the year <datestruct value="1678"><year reg="1678">1678</year></datestruct>. Queen Catherine remained here after Charles's decease, till her return to Lisbon. The buildings were afterwards appropriated to be the residence of the queen dowager, and very often appointed for the reception of ambassadors: the last who staid here any considerable time were the Venetian residents, who made their public entry in <datestruct value="1763--"><year reg="1763">1763</year></datestruct>. 
<p>Although the ancient building and garden occupied a considerable space, they did not, by any means, comprise the intended ground plan of the new erections. This palace had a large addition made to it, which contained all the apartments fronting the garden dedicated to the purposes of the royal academy, the keeper's lodgings, those of the chaplain, the house-keeper, &amp;c.; these, with the chapel, screen, and offices, were the works of Inigo Jones, though they probably rose upon the ruins of a magnificent part of the old fabric. At the extremity of the royal apartments, which might be termed semi-modern, <num value="2">two</num> large folding doors connected the architecture of Jones's with the ancient structure; these opened into a long gallery, on the <num value="1">first</num> floor of a building which occupied <num value="1">one</num> side of the water garden; at the lower end of this was another gallery, or suite of apartments, which made an angle forming the original front toward the river, and extending to Strand-lane. This old part of the mansion had long been shut, when sir William Chambers wishing, or being directed, to survey it, the folding doors of the royal bed-chamber (the keeper's drawing-room) were opened; a number of persons entered with the surveyor. The <num value="1">first</num> of the apartments, the long gallery, was lined with oak in small pannels; the heights of their mouldings had been touched with gold; it had an oaken floor and stuccoed ceiling, from which still depended part of the chains, &amp;c. to which had hung chandeliers. Some of the sconces remained against the sides, and the marks of the glasses were still to be distinguished upon the wainscot. 
<p>From several circumstances it was evident, that this gallery had been used as a bed-room. The furniture which had decorated the royal apartments had, for the convenience of the academy, and perhaps prior to that establishment, with respect to some of the rooms, been removed to this and the adjoining suite of apartments. It was extremely curious to observe thrown together, in the utmost confusion, various articles, the fashion and forms of which shewed that they were the production of different periods. In <num value="1">one</num> part <pb id="p.326" n="326"> there were the vestiges of a throne and canopy of state; in another curtains for the audience chamber, which had once been crimson velvet fringed with gold. What remained of the fabric had, except in the deepest folds, faded to an olive colour; all the fringe and lace, but a few threads and spangles, had been ripped off; the ornaments of the chairs of state demolished; stools, couches, screens, and fire-dogs, broken and scattered about in a state of derangement which might have tempted a philosopher to moralize upon the transitory nature of sublunary splendour and human enjoyments. 
<p>In these rooms, which had been adorned in a style of splendour and magnificence creditable to the taste of the age of Edward the <num value="6">Sixth</num>, part of the ancient furniture remained; and, indeed, from the stability of its materials and construction, might have remained for centuries, had proper attention been paid to its preservation. The audience chamber had been hung with silk, which was in tatters, as were the curtains, gilt leather covers, and painted screens. There was in this, and a much longer room, a number of articles which had been removed from other apartments, and the same confusion and appearance of neglect was evident. Some of the sconces, though reserved, were still against the hangings; and <num value="1">one</num> of the brass gilt chandeliers still depended from the ceiling. The general stale of this building, its mouldering walls and decaying furniture, broken casements, falling roof, and the long ranges of its uninhabited and uninhabitable apartments, presented to the mind in strong, though gloomy colours, a correct picture of those dilapidated castles, the haunts of spectres, and residence of magicians and murderers, that have, since the period alluded to, made such a figure in romance.<NOTE><BIBL>Moser's Vestiges, in Europ. Mag.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>Somerset-yard, on the west side of the palace, extended as far as the end of Catherine-street. Latterly, in this yard, were built coach-houses, stables, and a spacious guard-room. Mr. Pennant<NOTE><BIBL>Vide Some Account of London, p. <num value="129">129</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> observes, that  <QUOTE>possibly the founder never enjoyed the use of this palace, for in <datestruct value="1552--"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct>, he fell a just victim on the scaffold.</QUOTE>  Mr. Pennant is wrong: the duke did reside at his palace in the Strand; for his recommendatory preface to the  <QUOTE>Spiritual Pearl,</QUOTE>  is concluded in these words:  <QUOTE>From oure house at Somerset-place, the VIth day of May, anno <datestruct value="1552"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE>  Short, however, was the term for which he enjoyed his residence.

<p>To this palace queen Elizabeth was in the habit of resorting, as a visitor to her kinsman, lord Hunsdon; to whom, with characteristic frugality, her majesty lent, not gave, Somerset-place Anne of Denmark, (consort of king James I.) kept her court here. Wilson says,  <QUOTE>that the queen's court was a continued mascarado, where <pb id="p.327" n="327"> she and her ladies, like so many sea-nymphs, or nereides, appeared in various dresses, to the ravishment of the beholders.</QUOTE> <NOTE>During the occupancy of this queen, the building was called Denmark-place.</NOTE>
 
<p>The front of Somerset--place, next the Strand, was appointed by his late majesty to the use and accommodation of literature and the sciences, and is occupied by the Royal and Antiquarian societies, and the Royal Academy. The Royal Society was begun in the chambers of bishop Wilkins, <QUOTE>then no more than a member of Wadham-college, Oxford, about the year <datestruct value="1650"><year reg="1650">1650</year></datestruct>. In <datestruct value="1658--"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct> the members hired an apartment in Gresham college, and formed themselves into a body under lord Brounker, their <num value="1">first</num> president. Their reputation was so well established at the Restoration, that king Charles II. incorporated them by a charter, in which his majesty was pleased to style himself their founder, patron, and companion, which gave them the name of the Royal Society. By that charter the corporation was to consist of a president, a council of <num value="24">twenty-four</num>, and as many fellows as should be found worthy of admission; with a treasurer, secretary, curators, &amp;c. From this time benefactions flowed in upon them; <num value="3287">three thousand two hundred and eighty-seven</num> printed books, in most languages and faculties, chiefly the <num value="1">first</num> editions after the invention of printing; and <num value="554">five hundred and fifty-four</num> volumes of M.S. in Hebrew, Greek, Turkish, and Latin, part of the library of the once kings of Hungary, and purchased by the earl of Arundel, ambassador at Vienna, were given to the society's library in <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>, by the hon. Henry Howard, afterwards duke of Norfolk. In <datestruct value="1715--"><year reg="1715">1715</year></datestruct> this library was augmented with <num value="3600">three thousand six hundred</num> books, chiefly in natural and experimental philosophy, by Francis Aster, esq. &amp;c. A museum was founded by Daniel Calwall, esq. in <datestruct value="1677--"><year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>, containing an excellent collection of natural and artificial curiosities; which has been considerably increased by generous benefactions. In the year <datestruct value="1711"><year reg="1711">1711</year></datestruct> the society removed from Gresham college to Crane-court, Fleet-street.<NOTE><BIBL>Vide ante, vol. iii. p. <num value="678">678</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> In the year <datestruct value="1725"><year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct>, king George I. enabled the Royal Society, by letters patent, to purchase <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1000</num>l.</measure> in mortmain: and in the number of their members appear king George II. and many of the greatest princes in Europe. The officers chosen from among the members are the president, treasurer, and <num value="2">two</num> secretaries. The curators have the charge of making experiments, &amp;c. Every person to be elected a fellow of the Royal Society, must be propounded and recommended at a meeting of the society, by <num value="3">three</num> or more members, who must then deliver to <num value="1">one</num> of the secretaries a paper, signed by themselves with their own names, specifying the name, addition, profession, occupation, and chief qualifications; the inventions, discoveries, works, writings, or other productions of the candidate for election; as also notifying the usual place of his abode, and recommending him on their own personal knowledge; a plain copy of which paper, with the date of the day when delivered, is fixed up in the common meeting-room of the <pb id="p.328" n="328"> society, at <num value="10">ten</num> several ordinary meetings, before the nomination of the candidate is put to the ballot; </QUOTE> but it shall be free for every <num value="1">one</num> of his majesty's subjects who is a peer, or the son of a peer of Great Britain or Ireland, and for every <num value="1">one</num> of his majesty's privy council of either of the said kingdoms, and for every foreign prince or ambassador, to be propounded by any single person, and to be put to the ballot for election on the same day, there being present a competent number for making elections. And at every such ballot, unless <num value="2">two</num>-thirds at least of the members give their bills in favour of the candidate, he cannot be elected a fellow of the Royal Society; nor can any candidate be ballotted for unless <num value="21">twenty-one</num> members at least be present. After a candidate has been elected, he may at that, or the next meeting of the society, be introduced and solemnly admitted by the president, after having previously subscribed the obligation, whereby he promises,  <QUOTE> that he will endeavour to promote the good of the Royal Society of London, for the improvement of natural knowledge.</QUOTE>  When any <num value="1">one</num> is admitted he pays a fine of <num value="5">five</num> guineas, and afterwards <measure value="13s." type=currency><num value="13">thirteen</num> shillings</measure> a quarter as long as he continues a member, towards defraying the expences of the society, and for the payment thereof he gives a bond; but most of the members on their <num value="1">first</num> admittance chuse to pay down <num value="20">twenty</num> guineas, which discharges them from any further payments. Any fellow may, however, free himself from these obligations, by only writing to the president that he desires to withdraw from the society. When the president has taken the chair, and the fellows their seats, those who are not of the society withdraw, except any baron of England, Scotland, or Ireland, any person of a higher title, or any of his majesty's privy council of any of the united kingdoms, and any foreigner of eminent repute, may stay, with the allowance of the president, for that time; and upon leave obtained of the president and fellows present, or the major part of them, any other person may be permitted to stay for that time; but the name of every person thus permitted to stay, that of the person who moved for him, and the allowance, are to be entered in the journal book. The business of this society, in their ordinary meetings, is to order, take account, consider and discourse of philosophical experiments and observations; to read, hear, and discourse upon letters, reports, and other papers, containing philosophical matters; as also to view and discourse upon the rarities of nature and art, and to consider what maybe deduced from them, and how far they may be improved for use or discovery. No experiment can be made at the charge of the society, but by order of the society or council. And in order to the propounding and making experiments, the importance of such experiments is to be considered with respect to the discovery of any truth, or to the use and benefit of mankind. The meetings of the Royal Society are weekly, on Thursday evening. The members of the council are elected out of the fellows on St. Andrew's day, before dinner. <num value="11">Eleven</num> of the old council are chosen for the ensuing <pb id="p.329" n="329"> year, and <num value="10">ten</num> are elected out of the other members. Out of these are elected the president, treasurer, and secretary, &amp;c. 
<p>The Antiquarian Society was <num value="1">first</num> formed in London about the year <datestruct value="1580"><year reg="1580">1580</year></datestruct>, by some of the most eminent literary characters in the country, at the head of which was the learned and benevolent archbishop Parker.- Their <num value="1">first</num> meetings were held weekly, at the house of sir William Dethick, knight, garter king at arms, in the College of Heralds. The society had increased to such magnitude in the course of <num value="10">ten</num> years, that archbishop Whitgift, in <datestruct value="1590--"><year reg="1590">1590</year></datestruct>, proposed, though unsuccessfully, to queen Elizabeth, to form a college of English antiquaries. A similar attempt was made under James I.; and, though these applications were equally unsuccessful, the society had frequent though not stated meetings, to discuss curious points in their profession, till their revival in <datestruct value="1706--"><year reg="1706">1706</year></datestruct>, since which they have met without interruption, preserving and publishing valuable antiquities belonging to the British empire. The society obtained a royal charter on the <num value="2">2</num>d of <datestruct VALUE="1751-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1751">1751</year></datestruct>, by which they were incorporated  <QUOTE>The Society of Antiquaries of London,</QUOTE>  consisting of a president, council, and fellows; who, on St. George's day annually elect <num value="21">twenty-one</num> of their number to be council for the ensuing year.

The subordinate officers are a treasurer, directors, <num value="2">two</num> secretaries, &amp;c.; their meetings are on Thursday evenings. 
<p>The Royal Academy. The history of this establishment comprises, in a great measure, the history of the fine arts in Great Britain. This society was <num value="1">first</num> formed by some artists, who, by a voluntary subscription among themselves, established an Academy in St. Martin's-lane, Charing-cross. 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1760"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct> the <num value="1">first</num> exhibition of the artists was made, under the sanction of the Society of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce. The success of these exhibitions, and the harmony which at that time subsisted among exhibitors, naturally led them to the thoughts of soliciting an establishment, and forming themselves into a body: in consequence of which, his majesty king George III. granted them his royal charter, incorporating them by the name of  <QUOTE>The Society of Artists of Great Britain;</QUOTE>  this charter bears date <datestruct VALUE="1765-01-26"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=26>26</day>, <year reg=1765>1765</year></datestruct>. A division afterwards taking place among the members, was the cause of establishing the Royal Academy in <datestruct value="1768--"><year reg="1768">1768</year></datestruct>; which has continued in a flourishing state, whilst the Society of Artists has dwindled into obscurity. The Royal Academy consists of those members who are called Royal Academicians, Associates, and Associate Engravers, who are not to belong to any other society of artists established in London. No associate can be admitted a royal academician, except approved by the king, and depositing a picture, bas-relief, or other specimen of his abilities, to the council, before the <datestruct VALUE="-10-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></datestruct> next ensuing his election. The associates must be artists by profession, that is to say, painters, sculptors, or <pb id="p.330" n="330"> architects, to be at least <num value="24">twenty-four</num> years of age, and not apprentices. The associate engavers are not to exceed <num value="6">six</num>; they are not to be admitted into any of the offices of the academy, nor have any vote in their assemblies; but, in other respects, to enjoy all the advantages of academicians.<NOTE>Why this restriction should extend to such useful and respectable artists as the body of engravers, is not for us to examine. Trifling distinctions, where great objects are in view, appear invidious, and too often give the vulgar an opportunity of depreciating the whole fabric.</NOTE>
 
<p>There are <num value="4">four</num> professors, of painting, architecture, anatomy, and ancient literature. The business of these gentlemen is to instruct the students by lectures, &amp;c. in the principles of composition, to form their taste, and strengthen their judgment; to point out to them the beauties and imperfections of celebrated works of art; to fit them for an unprejudiced study of books, and to lead them into the readiest and most efficacious paths of study. The professors continue in office during the king's pleasure, and have a small annual salary. The schools are furnished with living models of both sexes, plaister figures, bas-reliefs, and lay-men, with proper draperies, under certain regulations.

<p>At the commencement of the reign of his late majesty George <hi rend=italics>III.</hi>
directions were given to sir William Chambers, master of the board of works, for the designing and superintending the new building of Somerset-house. After a design of sir William's the building was begun; and though never entirely completed, it must certainly be allowed, in many respects, to redound to the credit of his taste and ingenuity. Somerset-house occupies a space of <num value="500">five hundred</num> feet in depth, and nearly <num value="800">eight hundred</num> in width. This astonishing extension of site is distributed into a quadrangular court, <num value="340">three hundred and forty</num> feet long, and <num value="210">two hundred and ten</num> wide, with a street on each side, lying parallel with the court, <num value="400">four hundred</num> feet in length, and <num value="60">sixty</num> in breadth, leading to a terrace (<num value="50">fifty</num> feet in width) on the banks of the Thames. The terrace is raised <num value="50">fifty</num> feet above the bed of the river, and occupies the entire length of the building. The Strand front of the building is no more than <num value="135">one hundred and thirty-five</num> feet long. This division of the building consists of a rustic basement, supporting Corinthian columns, crowned in the centre with an attic, and at the extremities with a ballustrade. <num value="9">Nine</num> large arches compose the basement; the <num value="3">three</num> in the centre are open, and form the entrance to the quadrangle; the <num value="3">three</num> at each end are filled with windows of the Doric order, and adorned with pilasters, entablatures, and pediments. The key-stones of the arches are carved in alto-relievo, with <num value="9">nine</num> colossal masks, representing Ocean and the <num value="8">eight</num> chief rivers of Great Britain, viz. Thames, Humber, Mersey, Dee, Medway, Tweed, Tyne, and Severn, all decorated with suitable emblems. Above the basement rise <num value="10">ten</num> Corinthian columns, on pedestals, with regular entablatures correctly executed. <num value="2">Two</num> floors are comprehended in this order; the windows of the interior being only surrounded with architraves, while those of the principal floor have a ballustrade before them, and are ornamented with Ionic pilasters, entablatures, and pediments. The <num value="3">three</num> central windows have likewise large tablets, covering part of the architrave and frieze, on which are represented, in basso-relievo, medallions of the king, queen, and prince of Wales, supported by lions, and adorned respectively with garlands of laurel, of myrtle, and of oak. The attic extends over <num value="3">three</num> intercolumniations, and distinguishes the centre of the front. It is divided into <num value="3">three</num> parts by <num value="4">four</num> colossal statues placed over the columns of the order; the centre division being reserved for an <pb id="p.332" n="332"> inscription, and the sides having oval windows, enriched with festoons of oak and laurel. The <num value="4">four</num> statues represent venerable men in senatorial habits, each wearing the cap of liberty. In <num value="1">one</num> hand they have a fasces, composed of reeds firmly bound together, emblematic of strength derived from unanimity; while the other sustains respectively the scales, the mirror, the sword, and the bridle, symbols of Justice, Truth, Valour, and Moderation. The whole terminating with a group, consisting of the arms of the British empire, supported on <num value="1">one</num> side by the Genius of England, and on the other by Fame, sounding her trumpet. The <num value="3">three</num> open arches form the only entrance; they open to a vestibule, uniting the street with the back front, and serving as the general access to the whole edifice, but more particularly to the Royal Academy, and to the Royal and Antiquarian Societies, the entrances to which are under cover. This vestibule is decorated with columns of the Doric order, whose entablature supports the vaults, which are ornamented with well-chosen antiques, among which the cyphers of their majesties and the prince of Wales are intermixed. Over the central doors in this vestibule are <num value="2">two</num> busts, executed in Portland stone by Mr. Wilton; that on the Academy side represents Michael Angelo Bonarotti; that on the side of the learned societies, sir Isaac Newton. The back front of this part of the building, which faces the quadrangle, the architect was enabled to make considerably wider than that towards the Strand. It is near <num value="200">two hundred</num> feet in extent, and is composed of a 
<foreign lang=fr>corps de logis</foreign>, with <num value="2">two</num> projecting wings: the style of decoration is, however, nearly the same; the principal variations consist in the forms of the doors and windows, and in the use of pilasters instead of columns, except in the front of the wings, each of which has <num value="4">four</num> columns, supporting an ornament composed of <num value="2">two</num> sphinxes, with an antique altar between them, judiciously introduced to screen the chimnies from view. The masks on the key-stones are intended to represent Lares, or the tutelar deities of the place. The attic is ornamented with statues of the <num value="4">four</num> quarters of the globe. America appears armed, as breathing defiance; the other <num value="3">three</num> are loaded with tributary fruits and treasure. Like the Strand front, the termination of the attic on this side is formed by the British arms, surrounded by sedges and sea-weeds, and supported by marine gods, armed with tridents, and holding a festoon of nets filled with fish and other marine productions. The other <num value="3">three</num> sides of the quadrangle are formed by massy buildings of rustic work, corresponding with the interior of the principal front. The centre of the south side is ornamented with an arcade of <num value="4">four</num> columns, having <num value="2">two</num> pilasters on each side, within which the windows of the front are thrown a little back. On these columns rests a pediment; in the tympanum of which is a basso-relievo, representing the arms of the navy of Great Britain, supported by a sea-nymph riding on sea-horses, and guided by Tritons blowing conches. On the corners of the pediments are military trophies, and the whole is terminated by <pb id="p.333" n="333"> elegant vases placed above the columns. The east and west fronts are nearly similar, but less copiously ornamented. In the centre of each of these fronts is a small black tower, and in that of the south front a dome. All round the quadrangle is a story, sunk below the ground, in which are many of the offices subordinate to those in the basement and upper stories. Directly in the front of the entrance, and in the great quadrangle, is a bronze cast of the Thames, by Bacon, lying at the foot of a pedestal, on which is placed an elegant statue of his late majesty, also in bronze. 
<p>The front next the Thames corresponds with the south front of the quadrangle, and is ornamented in the same manner. Before it is a spacious terrace, supported by arches resting on the artificial embankment of the Thames. These arches are of massy rustic work, and the centre, or water-gate, is ornamented with a colossal mask of the Thames, in alto-relievo. There are <num value="11">eleven</num> arches on each side of the centre; the <num value="8">eighth</num> of which, on both sides, is considerably more lofty than the others, and serves as a landing-place to the warehouses under the terrace. Above these landing-places, upon the ballustrade which runs along the terrace, are figures of lions couchant, larger than life, and well executed. 
<p>The principal offices held in Somerset-house are those of the privy-seal, and signet; the navy; navy pay; victualling, and sick and wounded seaman's: the stamp; tax; hawkers' and pedlars'; the surveyor-general of crown lands; the duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster; the auditors of imprests; the pipe; the comptroller; legacy duty, and the treasurer remembrancer's. 
<p>In the streets on each side are dwelling-houses for the treasurer, paymaster, and <num value="6">six</num> commissioners of the navy; <num value="3">three</num> commissioners of the victualling-office, and their secretary; a commissioner of stamps, and <num value="1">one</num> of sick and wounded. 
<p>It appears from the papers laid before the house of commons, that the architect's estimate of the probable expense of the projected structure was comparatively trifling: on Somerset-house, however, has already been expended more than half a million of money. 
<p>The considerable difference between conjecture and reality, with regard to the expense of this undertaking, is not to be entirely attributed to the natural disdain of restraint, invariable with the practitioner of the fine arts. The building was commenced when the nation was plunged in its destructive war with the colonies. When it is recollected that Portland stone is brought by sea upwards of <num value="250">250</num> miles, from the island of that name in Dorsetshire; that Purbeck stone is likewise conveyed by water upwards of <num value="220">220</num> miles, from Sandwich; and Moor stone upwards of <num value="330">330</num> miles, from Devonshire or Cornwall, the effect that a state of national hostility must have on the charge and convenience of removing so many <num value="100">hundred</num> tons as were required for Somerset-house, must be allowed to operate materially, producing the alleged disproportion. <pb id="p.334" n="334"> On the spot now occupied by Doiley's linen warehouse, was formerly 
<div2 type=section id="c.9.3"><HEAD>Wimbledon House.</HEAD>
 
<p>A large mansion built by sir Edward Cecil, <num value="3">third</num> son of Thomas, earl of Exeter. Sir Edward was an eminent military character in the reigns of James I. and Charles I. By the latter he was created viscount Wimbledon, and baron Cecil of Pulney, in Surrey. He died issueless, <datestruct VALUE="1638-11-15"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg=15>15</day>, <year reg=1638>1638</year></datestruct>, and the title became extinct.

<p>There have been few shops in the metropolis that have acquired more celebrity than Doiley's warehouse. The original founder of the house (who, probably was a refugee, and after the revocation of the edict of Nantz, sought an asylum in this kingdom) formed a connexion in the weaving branch of business with some persons in Spital-fields, whose manufactures, most judiciously fostered by government, and most properly, and indeed patriotically, encouraged by the nobility, &amp;c. were just then ascending toward that eminence which they afterwards attained. Doiley was a man, it is said, of great ingenuity; and probably having also the best assistance, he invented, fabricated, and introduced a variety of stuffs, some of which were new, and all such as had never been seen in this kingdom. He combined the different articles, silk and woollen, and spread them into such an infinite number of forms and patterns, that his shop became a mart of taste, and his goods, when <num value="1">first</num> issued, the height of fashion. To this the Spectator alludes in <num value="1">one</num> of his papers, when he says to this effect, viz.  <QUOTE> that if Doiley had not by his ingenious inventions, enabled us to dress our wives and daughters in cheap stuffs, we should not have had the means to have carried on the war.</QUOTE>  In Vanbrugh's  <QUOTE>Provok'd Wife,</QUOTE>  in the scene Spring-gardens, lady Fanciful says to mademoiselle, pointing to lady Brute and Belinda,  <QUOTE>I fear those Doiley stuffs are not worn for the want of better clothes.</QUOTE>  This warehouse was equally famous indeed, in our very early times; it was the grand emporium for gentlemens' night gowns and caps.<NOTE><BIBL>Moser's Vestiges in Europ.

<div2 type=section id="c.9.4"><HEAD>Theatre Royal, English Opera House.</HEAD>
 
<p>This theatre occupies the site of a well-known building denominated the Lyceum, which was erected in <datestruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></datestruct>, by James Payne, esq. a respectable architect, on ground formerly belonging to Exeter-house. For many years this house was the centre of speculation, and a great diversity of entertainments were offered to <pb id="p.335" n="335"> public attention within its walls.

About <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>, the back part from the Strand was rebuilt as a theatre by the late Dr. Arnold, but after its completion he was unable to obtain a license, through the opposition of the patentees of the winter theatres. In <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></datestruct>, it was occupied by Mr. Charles Dibdin for his  <QUOTE>Sans Souci;</QUOTE>  by Mr. Handy and Mr. P.

<p>About <datestruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, Mr. Arnold, son of Dr. Arnold, obtained a license from the lord chamberlain for opening the Lyceum as an English opera house.

<p>In <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>, Mr. Arnold (who had obtained a new lease for <num value="99">99</num> years from the marquis of Exeter, at an annual ground-rent of <measure value="800l." type=currency><num value="800">800</num>l.</measure>) erected the present edifice on an enlarged scale, and at an expense of nearly <measure value="80000l." type=currency><num value="80000">80,000</num>l.</measure>

<div1 type=chapter id="c.10" n="10"><HEAD>History and Topography of the parish of St. Clement Danes.</HEAD>
 
<p>This parish is bounded on the north by St. Giles's in the fields and St. Andrew, Holborn; on the west by St. Mary-le-Strand, and St. Martin's in the fields; on the east by the ward of Farringdon Without, and on the south by the river Thames. 
<p>Its particular bounds are as follows: commencing at Strand-lane it advances northward between Newcastle-street and Drury-court, behind the houses on the south side of Princes-street, through Duke-street, to the Roman Catholic chapel, which is in this parish; thence to the south-west angle of Lincoln's-inn-fields, behind the houses on the south side of which it proceeds to about the middle of Lincoln's-inn gardens, where it turns north to Holborn; thence on the north side of Middle-row to the bars, where it abuts <pb id="p.338" n="338"> on the city; its course is then southerly, on the west side of Castletie-street, behind Greystoke-place, and the west side of Fetter-lane, by Shire-lane, to Temple-bar, and thence to Temple-stairs. 
<p><num value="1">One</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> notices of St. Clement's church by our historians, is the gift of it by Henry II.--to the knights templars. After the dissolution of that order, the advowson was conveyed to the canons regular of the church of the Holy Sepulchre, Warwick, who had other possessions in this parish, part of which Newcourt supposes to have been the site of Essex-house. Those exchanged it with Stapleton, bishop of Exeter, in the gift of whose successors it continued till Edward VI. thought proper to grant it to Edward, duke of Somerset; after whose death, the crown, having a <num value="2">second</num> possession, granted it to sir Thomas Palmer. The earl of Exeter possessed the patronage at the commencement of the last century, and his successors still hold it. A composition is mentioned by Newcourt to have been made in <datestruct value="1517--"><year reg="1517">1517</year></datestruct>, between the master and fellows of the hospital of the Savoy, and James Fitzjames, rector; in which it was agreed the hospital should receive all the tithes and other emoluments due from the inhabitants residing within its limits, for an annual payment to the rector of St. Clement's of <measure value="26s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="26">twenty-six</num> shillings and <num value="8">eight</num>-pence</measure>; the master and successors taking upon themselves the administration of all sacraments, &amp;c. to their inmates. The priest and churchwardens are possessed (to the use of the church and the morrow-mass priests' wages) of <num value="2">two</num> tenements, of the rent by year <measure value="1l. 6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="1">one</num> pound <num value="6">six</num> shillings and <num value="8">eight</num>-pence</measure>. The parish clerks in <datestruct value="1732--"><year reg="1732">1732</year></datestruct>, estimate the value at <measure value="600l." type=currency><num value="600">600</num>l.</measure> per annum, but that not more than <measure value="400l." type=currency><num value="400">400</num>l.</measure> was received; which, from the New View of London, <datestruct value="1708--"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, appears to have been repeated. 
<p>The origin of the addition of Danes to this church has never, been, and probably never will be, clearly ascertained; yet various have been the conjectures respecting it. Pennant says it was so called either from being the place of interment of Harold the Harefoot, or of the massacre of certain Danes who had taken refuge there.<NOTE><BIBL>Penn. Lond. p. <num value="135">135</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The apocryphal William of Malmsbury says, that the invading Danes burnt the church which before their time stood on this spot; so that it would appear that here stood a church in very early times. 
<p>Another reason given for the denomination of this church is, that when most of the Danes were driven out of England, the few that remained, being married to English women, were obliged to live betwixt the Isle of Thorney and Ludgate, where they erected a place of devotion, which was afterwards consecrated, and called <QUOTE lang=la>Ecclesia Clementis Danorum.</QUOTE> Such is the account which the recorder Fleetwood gave to the lord treasurer Burleigh, who resided in this parish.

Mag. <datestruct VALUE="1802-07--"><month reg="07">July</month> <year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, p. <num value="13">13</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> thinks that the church was originally built <pb id="p.339" n="339"> by the Danes; who, from the contentions arising betwixt them and the Normans, were banished by the city, and were obliged to inhabit this suburb. The church arose in consequence, and was dedicated in compliment to pope Clement II. or probably, as his reign was short, it might only be termed  <QUOTE>the church of the Danes,</QUOTE>  and acquired the addition or prefix of St. Clement's during the time of the crusade, in the reign of Richard I. as it was well known that Clement III. who then filled the papal chair, not only took an active part in the holy war, but, by the means of the knights templars, and other orders, had a much greater influence in this country than any of his predecessors; it is, therefore, probable Mr. Moser thinks that he might be honoured by the dedication of this and other churches to his patron saint and martyr of the <num value="2">second</num> century. 
<p>Hughson, in his History of London,<NOTE><BIBL>Vol. iv. p. <num value="150">150</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> gives the following account, which he supposes the most probable origin of this parish. He has, as he informs us, been favoured with certain manuscript collections made by Mr. William Stratford towards compiling a History of St. Clement's parish; and from this collection he has made the following extract. Mr. Stratford, after extracting from Francis Thynne,  <QUOTE>that the Danes in the reign of Ethelred despoiled the abbey of Chertsey, and murdered <num value="90">ninety</num> of the fraternity,</QUOTE>  proceeds in William of Malmsbury's statement, as above: and then advances his own opinion. <QUOTE><p>That it could not take its name from the <num value="1">first</num> of these events is certain; for Harold died in the year <datestruct value="1040"><year reg="1040">1040</year></datestruct>, at which time it was the burying-place of the Danes, and seems to have been well known as such by the fishermen who found the body, bringing it immediately to this sepulture. This, I think, proves that its name did not originate from that circumstance. With regard to the <num value="2">second</num>: take off its monkish dress, and it implies no more than that in an excursion made by the Danes, they plundered the monastery of Chertsey, and returned home, not to Denmark, but to their place of settlement, St. Clement Danes; where, for aught the monks knew, they died natural deaths; it not being probable that they would be destroyed by their own countrymen, who perhaps were sharers in the booty. 
<p>If I might be permitted to hazard a conjecture, it should be, that the church was built by Alfred the Great, about the year <datestruct value="886"><year reg="886">886</year></datestruct>, when he drove the Danes out of London. Those who submitted to his arms and government, it is probable, he settled without the walls, beyond the bar; which, with Shire-lane, was the boundary of these aliens. The corroboration of this circumstance is strengthened by the names of the latter place, as Alfred was the <num value="1">first</num> monarch who divided his kingdom into shires and parishes. His desire also to instil into the minds of the vanquished heathens a notion of Christianity, might induce him to form this district into a parish; and as in reforming the nation, he repaired many monasteries and built <pb id="p.340" n="340"> churches, the parish church of the Danes most probably was <num value="1">first</num> constructed at this period.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Previous to <datestruct value="1669--"><year reg="1669">1669</year></datestruct>, the church of St. Clement had felt the effects of time so severely, that the inhabitants were compelled to rebuild the steeple, which was finished in that year. The portion so rebuilt comprises all the square tower, except the upper story. The church underwent the same operation, and was completed in <datestruct value="1682--"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct>. The design of the church was made by sir Christopher Wren, and it was built by Edward Peirce under his directions, except the upper works of the steeple, which were added some years afterwards by James Gibbs. The church is a large and handsome building of stone: the plan shows an oblong square, the eastern end sweeping in a semi-circular direction, and broken in the centre by a small chancel, the end of which is square, but the angles are rounded off; at the west end is an attached tower, flanked by vestibules. 
<p>The tower possesses a considerable altitude; it is carried up square to the height of <num value="5">five</num> stories; the basement is fronted by a porch, consisting of an arched doorway between <num value="4">four</num> pilasters, in pairs, surmounted by an entablature: above the centre of which is a pannel, with the following inscription:-- 
<QUOTE rend=center>This church was repaired A. D. <datestruct value="1817"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>. Rev. W. Gurney, M.A. rector; 
<LB>Thomas Capper, William Dew, churchwardens.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The uncouth pedimental finish seems to mark an earlier period than the rebuilding of the church by Wren; the <num value="2">second</num> story has an arched window made into <num value="2">two</num> lights by a single million; the arch bounded by a sweeping cornice, a poor attempt at an imitation of the pointed style; the <num value="3">third</num> story has a circular window in the west front, and a sun-dial in the south flank. Up to this story the tower has buttresses at the angles, which have been modernized into obelisks. The <num value="4">fourth</num> story is clear of the church; in every front is a repetition of the window in the <num value="2">second</num> story. The elevation is here finished with a block cornice; and at this point the old tower terminated. The <num value="5">fifth</num> and last story is in a better kind of architecture; it consists of a stylobate, in each face of which is an ornamented pannel, containing the dials of the clock; in the upper part of the elevation an arched window rusticated, which is also repeated in every aspect. The elevation is finished by a <num value="2">second</num> block cornice, which <QUOTE> terminates the square portion of the tower. This story, and all the succeeding parts, are the work of Gibbs. A pyramidal structure of stone, which in plan is octangular, rises </QUOTE> from the platform in <num value="3">three</num> diminishing stories. The <num value="1">first</num> story is of .the Ionic order; it has its stylobate, from which <num value="8">eight</num> Ionic pilasters, situated at the angles of the design, take their rise. They are surmounted by the entablature of the order, upon the cornice of which are vases corresponding in number and situation with the pilasters; in each face of the structure is an arched window; the angles of the square tower are surmounted with vases, to avoid the abruptness <pb id="p.341" n="341"> occasioned by the sudden transition from the square to the octagon plan. The <num value="2">second</num> story is similar, the order being Corinthian, and each face of the elevation concaved; the <num value="3">third</num> story is of the composite order, and the angles have columns instead of pilasters. This story is crowned with a low dome, surmounted by a lantern, ending in a vane. 
<p>The <num value="2">two</num> lower stories of the tower are flanked by vestibules in <num value="2">two</num> stories; in the western fronts are low arched doorways, surmounted by circular windows, and in the flanks arched windows are substituted for the doorways. The elevations are finished with cornices and parapets, crowned with spherical domes covered with lead. The west front of the church rises to a considerable height behind the vestibules, and ends pedimentally raking up.to the tower. The south side of the church is made into <num value="2">two</num> stories; in the lower is a doorway near the west end, covered with a pediment and <num value="4">four</num> low arched windows, nearly square; in the upper story are <num value="5">five</num> lofty arched windows, the key-stones carved with cherubs, and the spandrils with festoons of foliage. The elevation finishes above the windows with a cornice, surmounted by a ballustrade, on which were formerly vases above the solids, which were tastelessly removed at the general repair in <datestruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></datestruct>. 
<p>The doorway in this side had formerly a circular pavilion composed of <num value="4">four</num> columns of the Ionic order, sustaining a dome: this was evidently an addition of Gibbs to the work of Wren; it was removed at the last repair. The north flank is uniform with that already described, except the doorway, which has no pediment. The sweeping portion of the east front has <num value="2">two</num> windows on each side the chancel, corresponding in design with the side elevations of the church. The chancel has a large arched window divided by stone-work, so often met with in Wren's works, in the east front, and <num value="2">two</num> arched windows corresponding with the church in the upper story of the flanks; the elevations of which finish with a ballustrade, but the east end has an elliptical pediment instead, above which is a shield charged with an anchor, and the letters S. C. D. 
<p>The roof rises to a high ridge in the centre, and is increased in breadth by lean-tos above the aisles; it is entirely covered with lead. The interior is distinguished by a grandeur in its arrangement, which, if the length of the building was adequate, would have produced an effect almost unrivalled; on each side the nave <num value="5">five</num> square piers; the height of the gallery sustain as many Corinthian columns;<NOTE>The columns are wood, and their appearance is not improved by the hoops of iron which bind them together.</NOTE> at the east end <num value="2">two</num> other columns are disposed in front of the chancel to accommodate the semi-circular place; the ceiling is an arched vault, elliptical over the centre division, and coved at the altar end to suit the circular finish; it is pierced with arches over every intercolumniation, and the side aisles are divided into <pb id="p.342" n="342"> groined compartments by other arches turned over the aisles, and received on an impost of <num value="3">three</num> fascia attached to the side walls. The ceiling of the nave springs from imposts over the columns, similar to the aisles; it is divided by bands into compartments equal with the intercolumniations; the soffits pannelled in squares and oblongs, the latter filled with foliage; the semicircular cove at the east end contains the arms of king James II.; in the centre, from the sides of which spring roses and thistles, overspreading the remainder of the vault; below the arms is a pannel with an inscription quite illegible, from its height and the darkness of this part of the church. 
<p>The springings of the ribs are enriched with shields with the anchor, &amp;c. as before, and cherubic heads, and the soffits of the bands and arches with guillochi; the whole are executed in the most splendid style of composition, which prevailed in the period when the church was built; the arrangement of the eastern end would have a fine effect if the church were longer: the design shews the superior taste of the architect, and forms a pleasing variation to his numerous other works. The intercolumniation at the chancel is wider than the rest, and the flanks are covered with arches returned from the main columns and received on the capitals of engaged columns; the chancel is recessed and covered with a hemi-spherical dome; the soffit enriched with lozenge-shaped pannels containing flowers; the upright is divided into <num value="2">two</num> stories; the lower is occupied by the altar screen, which has a large division in the centre covered with an elliptical pediment; in the tympanum a pelican; on each side are <num value="4">four</num> Corinthian columns crowned with an entablature set round with vases; the intervals on the screen bear the customary inscriptions.<NOTE>In <datestruct value="1725--"><year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct>, much ferment was occasioned in this parish, by an order from Dr. Gibson, bishop of London, for the removal of an altar-piece painted by Kent, which had been placed in the church at no small expence, and which was supposed to contain the portraits of the pretender's wife and children. Of this famous painting Hogarth engraved an exact fac simile. See <BIBL>Mr. Nichol's Biographical Anecdotes of Hogarth, <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>, pp. <num value="136">136</num>, <num value="492">492</num>.</BIBL> The original, after being removed from the church, was for some years <num value="1">one</num> of the ornaments of the coffee-room at the Crown and Anchor in the Strand, from which place it was removed to the vestry-room, over the old almshouses in the church-yard, where remained till <datestruct value="1803"><year reg="1803">1803</year></datestruct>; and has been since removed into the new vestry-room on the north side of the church-yard.</NOTE> The altar is porphyry sustained on a frame of wrought iron. 
<p>An upper gallery is constructed at the west end for the purpose of containing the organ and seats for the charity children. 
<p>The pulpit is hexagonal, and is enriched with a profusion of handsome carving; the material is dark brown oak; it is situated on the north side of the church. On the opposite side are placed the desks, which are plain and devoid of ornament. 
<p>The font, a handsome circular basin of white marble, is situated in a pew near the south-west entrance. Against the east end of the church is a tablet to sir Edward <pb id="p.343" n="343"> Leche, of Shipley, Derbyshire, a master of chancery.

<p>When the new sewers were constructing in the Strand, in <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, eastward of St. Clement's church, the workmen discovered an ancient stone bridge of <num value="1">one</num> arch, about <num value="11">eleven</num> feet in length. It was covered several feet in depth by rubbish and soil, and found to be of great strength in the construction. A doubt arises whether this was <foreign lang=la>Pons Novi Templi</foreign>, or Bridge of the New Temple, passed by the lords and others who attended parliament at Westminster, after going out of the city to this place by water; which, wanting repair, Edward III. called upon the knights Templars to effect, or an arch turned over a gully or ditch, when the road, now the street termed the Strand, was a continued scene of filth.

The consequence of this petition was an order appointing William de Leyre, of London, and Richard Abbott, assessors for levying a tax on the inhabitants between Temple-bar and Palace gate; and the mayor and sheriffs of London, with the bailiff of Westminster, overseers of the repair.

<p>On the north side of St. Clement's church, is St. Clement's-inn, <pb id="p.344" n="344"> a place of considerable antiquity; proper notice of which will be taken in another part of the work. 
<p>Mr. Nightingale conjectures,  <QUOTE> that near this spot stood an inn, as far back as the time of king Etheldred, for the reception of penitents who came to St. Clement's well; that a religious house was in process of time established, and that the church rose in consequence.</QUOTE>  Be this as it may, the holy brotherhood was probably removed to some other situation; the holy lamb, an inn on the west side of the lane, received the guests; and the monastery was converted, or rather perverted, from the purposes of the gospel to those of the law, and was probably in this profession considered as a house of very considerable antiquity in the days of Shakespeare; for he, who with respect to this kind of chronology may be safely quoted, makes, in the <num value="2">second</num> part of Henry IV. <num value="1">one</num> of his justices a member of that society. 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>He must to the inns of court. I was of Clement's once myself, where they talk of Mad Shallow still.</QUOTE>
 
<p>A pump now covers St. Clement's well. Fitzstephen, in his description of London, in the reign of Henry II. informs us,  <QUOTE>that round the city again, and towards the north, arise certain excellent springs at a small distance, whose waters are sweet, salubrious, and clear, and whose runnels murmur o&lsquo;er the shining stones: among these, Holywell, Clerkenwell, and St. Clement's well, may be esteemed the principal, as being much the most frequented, both by the scholars from the school, (Westminster,) and the youth from the city, when in a summers' evening they are disposed to take an airing.</QUOTE>  This well was also much resorted to on account of its being supposed of peculiar efficacy in the cure of cutaneous and other disorders, and was consequently a place of importance to devotees. The estimation of its efficacy and sanctity have long ceased. 
<p>The church is surrounded by an oval railing. The north side forms a semi-circle, and at the entrance of Clement's-inn, the corporation of London have erected a gate-way of stupendous architecture, to which are added the new almshouses, and vestry-room of the parish; all rebuilt at the expence of the city. The south side of the Strand is also rebuilt with very lofty dwellings, capacious shops of various descriptions; and, St. Clement's, notwithstanding the unlucky twist of the scite, has a situation superior to any other church in London. 
<p>St. Clement's parish (says Mr. Malcolm) certainly contained the residences of many of our most ancient noble families, nay, tradition will have it, that the great duke de Sully, minister to Henry IV. of France, was an inhabitant of Butcher-row. 
<p>At that time a house in it was occupied by Christopher Harley, count Beaumont, ambassador from France, in <datestruct value="1605--"><year reg="1605">1605</year></datestruct>, and the duke de Sully, who came over as ambassador extraordinary, resided here for 
<pb id="p.345" n="345">
 a few days after his arrival, till Arundel-house, then situated where Arundel-street now is, could be prepared for his reception. 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.1"><HEAD>Ancient House, Strand.</HEAD>
<p><FIGURE id="Fig.345"><HEAD>Ancient House, Strand</HEAD></FIGURE> 
<p>The house was ornamented in front with the fleur-de-lis, and other devices; but these were probably added to it in some later repairs in commemoration of the visit of so distinguished a guest. 
<p>Between Essex-house and Milford-lane was a chapel dedicated to the Holy Ghost, called S. Spirit; but of the time and occasion of its foundation, Stow confesses himself ignorant. To the west of this last was the bishop of Bath's house, or inn, as it was usual to call such residences. Afterwards it became the residence of the earl of Arundel. 
<p>Butcher-row was once a place of considerable traffic. The stack of houses which occupied the spot which now forms a wide opening on the west side of Temple-bar, was, with respect to the ground plan, in the form of an obtuse-angular triangle, the eastern line of which was formed by a shoemaker's, a fish-monger's, and another shop, with wide extended fronts, and its western point blunted by the intersection of the vestry-room and almshouses of St. Clement's parish; both the sides also contained shops of various descriptions; the south (Strand), a number of respectable tradesmen, such as bakers, dyers, drysalters, smiths, tin-plate workers, &amp;c.; the north (Butcher-row,) was, as its name implied, really a flesh-market; it was at <num value="1">first</num> wholly occupied by butchers, who had from a very early period brought their meat in carts from the country, and sold it just without the civic liberties, for the supply of the western parts of the city. These foreign butchers, as they were termed, were considered so extremely useful in repressing the exorbitant demands of the native butchers, and lowering the prices of the London markets of these days, that the competition was encouraged, and their dealings were attended with such success, that the desire of immoderate profit operated upon them as it has upon their descendants, in the present age, and induced them to become stationary; perhaps to go hand in hand with the people they had formerly opposed. Be this as it may, in the reign <pb id="p.346" n="346"> of queen Elizabeth, Butcher-row, which had for the purpose above specified been in the <num value="21">twenty-first</num> of Edward I. granted to Walter le Barbur, took the form of an established market; in process of time other shops, besides butchers, fishmongers, and green-grocers, were opened. The whole of Butcher-row, on the south side of the church, was taken down in <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, and the present handsome crescent erected at the expense of the corporation of London. 
<p>The pavement of this quarter, as well as of some other parts of Westminster, seems to have been in a deplorable state so lately as <datestruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>, when an act for new paving this city and its liberties was passed. Until that time, it appears, every inhabitant, before his house, did what was right in his own eyes; the consequence of which was, that some doors were superbly paved, some indifferently, some very badly, and others totally neglected, according to the wealth, avarice, or caprice of the inhabitants. And a proof of the filth and nastiness which prevailed, is detailed in the London Chronicle of that time. 
<p>Speaking of the plan for a new pavement, the writer exclaims,  <QUOTE>all sorts of dirt and ashes, oyster-shells, and the offals of dead poultry, and other animals, will no longer be suffered to be thrown into the streets, but must be kept until the dustman comes; nor will the annoyances erected by coachmakers be permitted; and when a house is pulled down, the rubbish must be carried to a proper place, and not left in the streets. Can we, with any degree of justice, commend our magnificent buildings, without taking shame to ourselves for the bad condition of our streets?</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Beauties of England, vol. x. pt. iv. p. <num value="168">168</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>This part of the Strand, in the early part of Elizabeth's reign, was the scene of frequent disturbances, occasioned by the young students belonging to the inns of chancery; who were so riotous and unruly at night, parading the streets to the danger of peaceable passengers, and the annoyance of the neighbourhood, that the inhabitants were obliged to keep watches.

Sir Thomas was appointed treasurer of the navy, which he retained till his death in <datestruct value="1709--"><year reg="1709">1709</year></datestruct>. Burnet's house continued in the family within memory, when it was possessed by a bookseller of the same name, a collateral descendant from the bishop. 
<p>Another noble mansion in this parish was situated at the west end of Wych-street; it was called 
<div2 type=section id="c.10.3"><HEAD>Drury House.</HEAD>
 
<p>It was built by sir William Drury, an able commander in the Irish wars, in the reign of Elizabeth. During the time of the fatal discontents of the queen's favourite, the earl of Essex, it was the place his imprudent advisers resolved on such counsels as terminated in the destruction of him and his adherents. In the next century it was possessed by the heroic lord Craven, afterwards earl Craven,. who rebuilt it. It was lately a large brick pile, concealed by other buildings, and was a public-house, bearing the sign of the queen of Bohemia's head, the earl's admired mistress, whose battles he fought, animated by love and duty. When he could aspire at her hand, he is supposed to have succeeded; and it is said that they were privately married, and that he built for her the fine seat at Hampstead Marshal, in the county of Berks, afterwards destroyed by fire. The services rendered by the earl to London, his native city in particular, was exemplary. He was so indefatigable in preventing the ravages of the frequent fires of those days, that it was said his very horse smelt it out. He and Monk, duke of Albemarle, heroically staid in town during the dreadful pestilence, and at the hazard of their lives preserved order in the midst of the terrors of the times.<NOTE>In Craven Buildings was a very good portrait of this hero, in armour, with a truncheon in his hand, and mounted on his white horse; on each side an earl's and a baron's coronet, and letters W.

<p>Drury house was suffered to go to decay; and it remained in a dilapidated state till the late P.

<p>Adjoining to Wych-street is Holywell-street, from the well of that name. It is a narrow inconvenient avenue, of old ill-formed houses; but contains a neglected place for law-students, named Lyons' Inn. This is an appendage to the Inner Temple, and is known to be a place of considerable antiquity. 
<p>Portugal-street is famous for having had a dramatic theatre, <num value="1">first</num> built on the site of a tennis-court, and opened by sir William D&lsquo;Avenant, who obtained a patent for it in <datestruct value="1662--"><year reg="1662">1662</year></datestruct>. Out of compliment to James, duke of York, it was called  <QUOTE>the Duke's Theatre;</QUOTE>  and the performers, in contradistinction to his majesty's servants at Drury-lane, were called  <QUOTE>the duke's company.</QUOTE>  The building being found inadequate to its intended purpose, a new <num value="1">one</num> was erected in Dorset-gardens, and this was deserted. The structure in Portugal-street arose in consequence of some disputes between the managers and actors of Drury-lane and Dorset-gardens, and the latter formed themselves into an association, at the head of which was Mr. Betterton, the Roscius of the day. Their complaints having been made before king William III. a licence was granted to act for themselves in a separate theatre; and a subscription was opened for that purpose, which the nobility very liberally supported. The new theatre was opened on the <num value="301">301</num>h of <datestruct VALUE="1695-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>, and continued to afford public entertainment till <datestruct value="1704"><year reg="1704">1704</year></datestruct>; when, complained of as a nuisance, Betterton assigned his patent to sir John Vanbrugh; who, finding these premises too small, erected <num value="1">one</num> more spacious in the Haymarket, and this was abandoned. It was again opened in <datestruct value="1714--"><year reg="1714">1714</year></datestruct> by Mr. Rich, whose father had been expelled for mismanagement at Drury-lane, and employed the remainder of his life in re-fitting it for performances: the <num value="1">first</num> play on this occasion was The Recruiting Officer. The performers, who were under the direction of Mr. <pb id="p.350" n="350"> 
<p>Rich, were so much inferior to those at Drury-lane, that the latter carried away all the applause and favour of the town. In this distress, the genius of Rich suggested to him a species of entertainment, which, at the same time that it has been deemed contemptible, has been ever followed and encouraged. Harlequin, Pantaloon, and all the host of pantomimic pageantry, were now brought forward; and sound and shew obtained a victory over sense and reason. The fertility of Rich's invention in these exotic entertainments, and the excellence of his own performance must at the same time be acknowledged. By means of these only, he kept the managers of the other house at all times from relaxing their diligence; and, to the disgrace of public taste, frequently obtained more money by ridiculous and paltry performances, than all the sterling merit of the rival theatre was able to acquire.<NOTE><BIBL>Baker's Biographia Dramatica, Introduction.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>In <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>, Portugal-street was shut up, in consequence of Mr. Rich and his company removing to the new theatre in Covent-garden. In <datestruct value="1735--"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>, Mr. Gifford, who had opened a theatre in Goodman's fields, was persuaded to take the vacant edifice, in which he and his company acted for <num value="2">two</num> years; when it entirely ceased from being a theatre;<NOTE>The shutting up this structure has been whimsically accounted for by vulgar tradition; upon a representation of the pantomime of the Harlequin and Dr. Faustus, when a tribe of demon necessary for the piece was assembled, a supernumerary devil was observed, who, not approving of going out in a complaisant manner at the door, to shew a devils trick, flew up to the ceiling, made his way through the tiling, and tore away <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4">fourth</num> of the house; which circumstance so affrighted the manager, that the proprietor had not courage to open the house afterwards.</NOTE> and, having had various revolutions, is now occupied as a pottery and china warehouse. It was here that Macklin killed Mr. Hannam, in the year <datestruct value="1735"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>. Opposite is the work-house for the poor of St. Clement's parish; and adjoining is the burial-ground, which was purchased by the inhabitants in the year <datestruct value="1638"><year reg="1638">1638</year></datestruct>, as appears by a commission for a rate to wall it in granted to them by Dr. Juxon, bishop of London. In <datestruct value="1674--"><year reg="1674">1674</year></datestruct>, bishop Henchman gave them licence to build houses and shops on the north side. 
<p>On the north side of Portugal-street is the court for the relief of insolvent debtors. It is a neat and commodious brick edifice, erected in <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct> from the designs of J.

In the year <datestruct value="1657"><year reg="1657">1657</year></datestruct>, a bill was passed for preventing the increase of buildings, in which was a clause, permitting the earl of Clare to erect the market which bore his title, in these fields, to be held on Tuesday, Thursdays, and Saturdays.

<p>This church is <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="50">fifty</num> new churches built by act of parliament.

<p>It was dedicated to St. George the Martyr, in honour of the reigning monarch; and being situated near Hanover-square, received its additional epithet. 
<p>The ground on which it is built was given by general Stewart who some time after bequeathed to this parish the sum of <measure value="4000l." type=currency><num value="4000">four thousand</num> pounds</measure>, towards erecting and endowing a charity-school therein.

<p>The parish consists of <num value="4">four</num> wards, denominated Conduit-street, Grosvenor-street, Dover-street, and the out-ward. 
<p>The plan of the church shows a parallelogram, with a portico at the west end. The west front consists of a centre and <num value="2">two</num> small wings. The former is entirely occupied by the portico, which is hexastyle, of the Corinthian order, and crowned with a pediment, the raking cornice of which is enriched with modillions as well as the horizontal <num value="1">one</num>, and in the tympanum is a circular aperture enriched with foliage; on the cornice are square acroteria. The returns of the entablature are received on pilasters, at their entrance into the walls of the church. The wall behind the portico is made by pilasters into divisions, corresponding with the intercolumniations; between every pilaster is a lintelled doorway; over the centre <num value="1">one</num> is a square window. The portico has been justly the subject of the highest admiration amongst architectural critics; it is, perhaps, only excelled by the magnificent front of St. Martin's in the fields. The tower rises from the centre of the church, behind the pediment; it is more admired for its proportions than its size; the plan is square: the elevation consists of a plain stylobate, in every face of which is a circular dial, over which the cornice rises in the same form; the upper story has the angles truncated, and fronted by composite columns, in pairs, standing on pedestals; in each aspect is an arched window filled with weather boarding; and the elevation is crowned with an entablature breaking above the columns, over which are vases. The entablature is surmounted by an attic, which is crowned by a spherical dome; on the apex of the latter is a square pedestal, pierced with openings in each face, and ending in a vane. The north side is in <num value="5">five</num> divisions: the <num value="1">first</num> is the return of the wing of the west front. Each division contains <num value="2">two</num> series of windows; the lower slightly arched, and are covered with a bold cornice resting on consoles; the upper are round-headed, and are enclosed in rusticated niches, composed of <num value="2">two</num> pilasters, crowned with an entablature and pediment; the horizontal cornice broken to let in the head of the window. The elevation is finished with a modillion cornice continued from the west front, except the <num value="1">first</num> division, which is crowned with a low attic and pediment. The east front is in <num value="3">three</num> divisions; the lateral ones having doorways surmounted by windows, in accordance with the arrangement of the north front. The centre division is occupied by a Venetian window of the composite order; the entablature is sustained on <num value="6">six</num> insulated columns, <num value="2">two</num> at the sides and <num value="4">four</num> in pairs, in the centre; the <pb id="p.354" n="354"> whole is crowned with the continued cornice and a pediment. The south side, in the number of windows, resembles the northern; but, being concealed from observation, the dressings of the windows are omitted. The entire building is substantially built with Portland stone, and the roof is covered with lead. 
<p>The interior is made into a nave and side aisles by <num value="4">four</num> square piers faced with pilasters, which sustain, with the intervention of pedestals of equal height with the breast-work of the galleries, the same number of columns of the Corinthian order; the entablature of the order crowns the whole, from which springs an elliptically vaulted ceiling; the soffits occupied with square moulded pannels; the ceiling of the aisles is made into divisions corresponding with the intercolumniations, by entablatures entering the principal <num value="1">one</num> above the columns, and received on corbels formed of the capital of a pilaster of the order attached to the said walls; the divisions so formed are each arched in a segment of a circle, and pannelled; a gallery with a pannelled front extends along the side aisles, and across the west end; it rests on the main piers at the sides and on <num value="2">two</num> veined marble columns of the Ionic order at the west end; the organ is contained in an upper gallery erected at the west end. The fronts of the galleries are nearly covered with the names and titles of the various members of the aristocracy of the country, who have served the office of churchwarden. On the western gallery is inscribed, <QUOTE><emph rend=caps>This Church Was Consecrated the <datestruct VALUE="-03-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> day of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct></emph>, <datestruct value="1724--"><year reg="1724">1724</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The altar is situated in a slight recess in the eastern wall, bounded by <num value="2">two</num> piers, and covered with an elliptical arch, with pannelled soffits; the screen occupies the dado of the Venetian window, which, like its exterior front, is decorated with <num value="6">six</num> insulated composite columns; the centre of the screen is occupied by a large painting by sir James Thornhill, the subject  <QUOTE>the last supper;</QUOTE>  it is a crowded design, and possesses but little merit.

This square, we hear, is to be called Oxford-square; and that ground has been taken to build houses on it by the right honourable lords, the earl of Oxford, the earl of Carnarvon, the lord Harcourt, the lord Harley, and several other noble peers.</QUOTE>  
<p>On the east side of Hanover-square is an elegant concert-room, principally used by the members of the ancient concerts, which is a branch that seceded from the academy of ancient music. It is under the superintendance of <num value="6">six</num> directors, who are chosen from among the nobility. The leading feature is the utter exclusion of all modern music. The vocal performers are always of the <num value="1">first</num> class and are liberally paid. 
<p>On the north side is Harewood-house, which was originally built from an elegant design of the Adams's, for the duke of Roxburgh. After the death of the original proprietor it was purchased by lord Harewood, from whom it received its present name. 
<p>On the west side of Regent-street, nearly opposite the Argyle rooms, is 
<div2 type=section id="c.11.3"><HEAD>Hanover Chapel.</HEAD>
 
<p>The order of the architecture of this chapel, as stated in the reports of the commissioners for building new churches, is  <QUOTE> Ionic, of the Temple of Minerva Polias, at Priene.</QUOTE>  
<p>The principal front ranges with the houses on the western side of Regent-street. The portico, in imitation of the mother church (St. George, Hanover-square,) covers the foot-path, an arrangement to be admired, as the lower parts of the columns are not injured in appearance by the addition of unsightly iron rails, like the noble church of St. Martin's. The building is thus rendered conspicuous in a lateral point of view, and not like many other fine edifices, so hid and concealed, that thousands may pass daily, and be almost total strangers to the beauties they contain. The other portions of the exterior, with the exception of <num value="2">two</num> wings, are concealed by houses. To the mediocrity of style observable in the new churches, the present forms a splendid exception. Its exterior and interior features are novel. The style of architecture, and the ingenuity and symmetry of the arrangement, reflect the highest credit upon the architect, Mr. Cockerell. 
<p>From the wings rise <num value="2">two</num> square towers; the angles being formed of Ionic pilasters sustaining an entablature, above which is a block cornice. The fronts are pannelled, and ornamented with paterae. <pb id="p.357" n="357"> 
<p>There are some particulars worthy of notice in the detail of this facade. The architraves of the portico, where they enter the main building, rest on antae, in the capitals of which are inserted busts of angels supporting the order in the style of cariatidae. In the cymatium are introduced the heads of dolphins. The principal doorway, of a pyramidal form, as usual in Grecian buildings, is enclosed within an architrave richly embellished with honeysuckle mouldings and patere. The cornice of the lintel rests upon consoles inserted in the wall; above is a circular wreath of foliage, enclosing the date A. D. <datestruct value="1823"><year reg="1823">1823</year></datestruct>, the period of the commencement of the building. 
<p>Over the centre of the building is a spherical dome surmounted with a gilt cross. 
<p>The front, upon the whole, is certainly <num value="1">one</num> of the finest ornaments of the street, and is decidedly the best specimen of architecture in it. If any thing is to be regretted, it is the square turrets which finish the elevation; there is a meanness about these appendages, ill suiting the building to which they are attached. 
<p>The interior is square, each of the sides being carried out to form aisles. 
<p>The ceiling is sustained by <num value="4">four</num> fluted columns, and the same number of antae; they are specimens of an order as yet without a name, but nearest approaching to the Corinthian. The capitals have the basket and encurvated abacus of that order, but have only a single row of leaves set perpendicularly on the astragal. The caulicolae are omitted, and upon the volutes are placed doves, with extended wings, corresponding with each angle of the abacus. The capitals of the antae are similar, with the exception of the doves. In the centre of the ceiling is the cupola, on the inner circumference of which is placed <num value="8">eight</num> corbels, each representing a cherub with <num value="4">four</num> wings, from which rise the same number of concave ribs, uniting in a circle with a triangle inclosed in an irradiation in the centre; between the ribs are glazed windows, a very considerable portion of light being thrown down into the building by this tasteful cupola, in which elegance and utility are happily combined. 
<p>The most splendid piece of composition in the chapel is the altar. It is enriched with imitations of various antique marbles, and forms on the whole a rich architectural display. The centre, in imitation of the  <QUOTE>holy of holies,</QUOTE>  is a deep recess covered with a dark blue curtain, in the centre of which is displayed a cross, and the monagram I. H. S. in letters of gold. The marbles imitated are porphyry, verd antique, and Sienna marble; the various mouldings are enriched in gold on a white ground. The recess is flanked with piers of Sienna marble, each containing a sunk pannel of porphyry, with gilt mouldings. Fronting the piers are tablets of black marble, with arched heads, having the decalogue in gold letters inscribed on them. A splendid frieze and cornice crowns the whole; the former is enriched with passion-flowers and white <pb id="p.358" n="358"> lilies in bold relief, alternating with each other, and splendidly coloured, worthy of attention for the beauty of the ornaments, but more so for the appropriateness of them. 
<p>The whole embellishments of the church are happily chosen; each <num value="1">one</num> presents a symbol in some way or other associated with our religion. The organ is placed immediately upon the altar, and the pipes, in a tastefully ornamented case, are made to correspond with, and form a finish to the rich architectural composition below. No gallery intervenes, the instrument being played at the side. The pulpit and desks are placed in <num value="1">one</num> group in the front of the altar, an arrangement which the want of space renders necessary. The greatest ingenuity is displayed in the arrangement of the pews and galleries. The site of the building being very confined, has rendered additional galleries necessary; but the lower being made to project considerably beyond the upper ones, that theatrical appearance, so unpleasing in Mary-le-bone church, is avoided. The neatness displayed in the internal fittings, as well as the mode of lighting the aisles and spaces beneath the galleries, is much to be admired. The architect has made the most of his funds as well as his ground, which it must have struck any <num value="1">one</num> who saw the site before the erection of the building was a very confined spot. 
<p>Near this chapel is a pleasing exhibition, entitled, 
<div2 type=section id="c.11.4"><HEAD>The Cosmorama.</HEAD>
 
<p>It consists of <num value="2">two</num> galleries, in which are views of public buildings both at home and abroad; in some, a very pleasing effect of light and shade is shown. 
<p>Berkeley-square is situated on the north side of Piccadilly. Mr. Malcolm observes, that the circumstance of its being on <num value="1">one</num> of those few descents within London, renders it worthy of notice, rather than any magnificence in the buildings. The whole south side is occupied by the wall of an extensive garden, in the midst of which is a large stone house of heavy proportions, built by the earl of Bute about <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, and sold incomplete to the earl of Shelburne, afterwards marquis of Lansdown, for <measure value="22000l." type=currency><num value="22000">22,000</num>l.</measure> It is now called 
<div2 type=section id="c.11.5"><HEAD>Lansdown House,</HEAD>
 
<p>And belongs to the present marquis of that name. The front is of white stone, and is ornamented with Ionic attached columns and a pediment, which is just observed peeping above the rich foliage by which it is surrounded; giving the whole a very pleasing effect, and making a beautiful termination of the square. It was built by Adams, and is an excellent piece of architecture. The interior is enriched with whatever is requisite to the mansion of such an enlightened nobleman as the present proprietor. It contains a fine gallery of statues and ancient marbles, and the celebrated Venus of Canova, <num value="1">one</num> of the most esteemed productions of modern art. The late lord collected a rich library of books and valuable manuscripts, <pb id="p.359" n="359"> the latter of which have been purchased by parliament, and are now lodged in the British Museum. 
<p>In the centre of the square, which contains <num value="3">three</num> acres of ground, was a most magnificent equestrian statue of his late majesty, by Wilmot. It stood on a clumsy pedestal, and was taken down in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>. 
<p>On the east side of the square is a handsome street called Bruton-street. On this side are Hill-street, and Charles-street, both handsome, with stately houses. In the former is the residence of sir John Fleming Leicester, bart. whose splendid gallery of the works of British artists, has made many a worshiper of the old masters blush for his inattention to the merits of his countrymen. 
<p>At the south-east corner of Berkeley square is Hay hill, commencing about <num value="4">four</num> houses from the square. It is very steep, and has several large houses on the summit; but their size is the only external recommendation they possess. 
<p>Hay hill was granted to the speaker of the house of commons by queen Anne,<NOTE><BIBL>Annual Register, <datestruct value="1769--"><year reg="1769">1769</year></datestruct>.</BIBL></NOTE> but is not hereditary in that office. This grant occasioned great alarms amongst that species of politicians who see bribery and corruption in every royal act; and they exclaimed against the parties so vehemently, that the speaker sold the gift, and gave the amount of the purchase money to the poor. Since that period it has been possessed by the Pomfret family, and sold previous to <datestruct value="1769--"><year reg="1769">1769</year></datestruct>, for <measure value="20000l." type=currency><num value="20000">20,000</num>l.</measure><NOTE><BIBL>Malcolm iv. <num value="301">301</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
Previous to the completion of the houses between New Bond-street and Hyde Park, they were called Grosvenor buildings; but, in the month of <datestruct VALUE="1725-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct>, sir Richard Grosvenor, bart. (who was in right of the manor of Wimondham, Herts, grand cup-bearer at the coronation of George II. and died <datestruct value="1732--"><year reg="1732">1732</year></datestruct>,) assembled his tenants, and the persons employed in the buildings, to a splendid entertainment, when he named the various streets. At the same period he erected a gate in Hyde Park, now called by his name. Sir Richard, says Mr. Malcolm, was as great a builder as the duke of Bedford; and to him 
<div2 type=section id="c.11.6"><HEAD>Grosvenor Square</HEAD>
 
<p>Grosvenor Square owes its origin. It is on the south side of Oxford-street, and contains <num value="6">six</num> acres of ground. The houses by which it is surrounded, are, though not uniform, extremely magnificent. The fronts are built partly of stone, but some are of brick and stone, and others of rubbed brick, with only their quoins, facios, windows, and door-cases of stone. 
<p>In the centre is a spacious garden, laid out by Kent. The disposition of the walks, and the distribution of the shrubs and trees, are pleasing, and have a picturesque effect in every point of view. In the centre was, until lately, a gilt equestrian statue of George I. This statue was made by Van Nost, and was erected by sir Richard <pb id="p.360" n="360">

<p>In the year <datestruct value="1739"><year reg="1739">1739</year></datestruct>, the centre house, on the east side of this square was raffled for, and won by <num value="2">two</num> persons named Hunt and Braithwaite.

<p>It has already been remarked, that the houses in this square are of various kinds of architecture but those on the east side are of a regular and uniform plan, and greatly superior in effect to the others, though some of the houses on the north side may be more superb. 
<p>Grosvenor-street extends eastward from the square into New Bond-street, and consists of a great number of excellent houses, the majority of which are inhabited by titled persons and affluent families.

<div2 type=section id="c.11.7"><HEAD>St. Mark's Chapel.</HEAD>
 
<p>This chapel is situated on the east side of North Audley street; the west front is the only portion open to public observation; the south aide abuts on a small court-yard, and may be seen by passing through the chapel; the other portions are closely built against. The plan gives a parallelogram, with a portico and lobbies of considerable depth at the west end, and a small chancel at the east. The west front consists of a capacious portico, composed of <num value="2">two</num> fluted columns of the Athenian Ionic order, and the same number of antae, surmounted by a rich entablature. From the roof rises a square tower, the angles canted off and guarded with antae, and the whole covered with a low dome, crowned with a cross. 
<p>The entrance to the church from the portico, is by a splendid doorway, covered with a cornice resting on consoles; it leads into a lobby, which is divided into <num value="3">three</num> aisles by <num value="6">six</num> square insulated ante, surmounted by architraves and cornices, on which the ceiling rests; it is lighted from above. The body of the chapel has <num value="2">two</num> <pb id="p.361" n="361"> series of windows on each side, the lower are slightly arched, the upper round headed; the arches connected internally by a continued impost cornice, and the heads bounded by moulded architraves; on the north side a doorway is substituted for the <num value="1">first</num> window from the west in the lower tier; the east end is recessed in the centre, and forms a small chancel. The ceiling is horizontal; it consists of a large oblong square pannel in the centre, bounded by a bordering of square pannels; the chancel is divided by cornices into compartments. The altar-screen is in imitation of marble; it is divided into compartments by antae, surmounted by an entablature enriched with honeysuckles and mouldings in gold; above the cornice is an acroterium in the centre, surmounted by a pedestal, on which is placed a chalice. A gallery resting on Doric columns occupies the west end, and the <num value="2">two</num> sides of the interior; the fronts are plainly pannelled. The organ is a handsome design in <num value="3">three</num> divisions, covered with pediments; on each side are additional galleries for the charity children, which cover a part of the lobbies. The pulpit and reading-desk, according to the modern practice, are copies of each other, and are situated on opposite sides of the middle aisle. 
<p>The architect of this chapel is J. Gandy. esq.; it was commenced in <datestruct VALUE="1825-09--"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, and consecrated by the late bishop of London, (Dr. Howley) on <datestruct VALUE="1828-04-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>.

<p>The residence of earl Grosvenor; <num value="1">one</num> of the wings of this palatial residence is completed, and forms the picture gallery. It is a magnificent building of stone of Roman architecture; the order the Corinthian of the Temple of the Sybils; the elevation is in <num value="2">two</num> portions, <num value="1">one</num> in advance of the other; it commences with a rusticated stylobate sustaining <num value="4">four</num> columns and <num value="2">two</num> antae, engaged with the main wall of the building and crowned with their entablature; in the intercolumniations are blank windows of the Palladian school, fronted with ballustrades and crowned with pediments; above each is a sunk pannel containing a festoon of foliage; the entablature is surmounted by a blocking course broken by pedestals, which are carried up to a convenient height and finished with vases; the intervals between the pedestals are occupied with a ballustrade: this may be described as the <num value="1">first</num> portion; this part of the design which is advanced a trifling degree before the other, only differs in having columns substituted for the antae of the other portion; the entablature is here surmounted by an attic crowned with a ballustrade; the face of the wall is pannelled, and on pedestals placed on the cornice of the principal order, corresponding in number and situation with the columns, are <pb id="p.362" n="362">

<p>Bond-street, Old and New, have long been celebrated as a fashionable lounge. These <num value="2">two</num>, in fact, form only <num value="1">one</num> street, leading from Piccadilly on the south, to Oxford-street on the north, about half a mile, or somewhat better.

<p>Trinity Chapel founded by James II. though not, as Mr. Malcolm observes, in the usual manner.  <QUOTE>It is well known,</QUOTE>  he continues,  <QUOTE>that James wished to restore the Roman Catholic religion, which he himself professed; but the general opposition to the measure he met with seems to have had but little weight; and he even endeavoured to force his unwilling subjects by summer encampments of troops on Hounslow-heath, whence he vainly imagined they might be influenced to inflict summary vengeance on the obstinate and heretical Londoners. Part of his policy lay in attempting the conversion of the army; to accomplish which he caused the erection of the original Trinity chapel, constructed of wood, and placed on wheels, that his priests might remove it from <num value="1">one</num> situation to another in the camp. The sequel of this bigoted folly need not be repeated.</QUOTE> <NOTE>Mr. Nightingale observes,  <QUOTE>If this were all that James did, surely it is too much in Mr. Malcolm, thus roundly to charge him with </QUOTE> bigoted folly, <QUOTE> merely for building a chapel for the conversion of his soldiers, for what he conceived to be a dangerous error to the true religion.</QUOTE> </NOTE><NOTE>the marker for this footnote does match in text</NOTE>

<div2 type=section id="c.11.10"><HEAD>The Royal Institution</HEAD>
 
<p>The Royal Institution for the encouragment of improvements in Arts and Manufactures, is situated the east side of Albemarle-street.

<p>The exterior of the building is perfectly plain; double windows barricade the front of the house, and thus keep out the cold in winter, and the heat in summer. There is a very spacious and elegant lecture-room, designed by Mr. Webster, with another of less size. There are also a library, a news-room, and a converzatione-room. In the news-room, besides all the morning and evening papers, the monthly and other periodical publications are regularly taken in, both English, French, and German. 
<p>Here are several professors, who read lectures on natural history, chemistry, the arts, &amp;c. 
<p>Clarges house stood on the site of the present street of that name, which, with Bolton-street and Half-moon-street, lead to May-fields. This part was originally called Brook-fields; and when the ancient fair, granted by Edward I. to St. James' hospital, ceased, on account of the dissolution of that hospital, and the increase of buildings, the fair was removed to Brook-field, and assumed the name of May-fair. 
<p>Of the origin of the name, as applied to this place, we have the following account:  <QUOTE> May fair was held annually for <num value="14">fourteen</num> days on the north of the present Half-moon-street, Piccadilly; and commenced on May day.

<p>The duke of Grafton and the earl of Grantham purchased all the waste ground at the upper end of Albemarle and Dover streets, in <datestruct value="1723--"><year reg="1723">1723</year></datestruct>, for gardens; and a road there, leading to May-fair, was turned another way. 
<p>This fair was productive of such disorders, that, in the year <datestruct value="1708"><year reg="1708">1708</year></datestruct>, the following presentment was made to the grand jury of Westminster, for the body of the county of Middlesex: 
<p> <QUOTE>That being sensible of their duty to make presentment of such matters and things as were public enormities and inconveniences, and being encouraged by example of the worthy magistracy of the city of London, in their late proceedings against Bartholomew-fair, did present, as a public nuisance and inconvenience, the yearly riotous and tumultuous assembly, in a place called Brook-field, in the parish of St. Martin's in the fields, in this county, called Mayfair. In which place many loose, idle, and disorderly persons did rendezvous, and draw and allure young persons, servants, and others, to meet there, to game, and commit lewdness and disorderly practices, to the great corruption and debauchery of their virtue and morals; and in which many and great riots, tumults, breaches of the peace, open and notorious lewdness, and murder itself had been committed; and were like to be committed again, if not prevented by some wise and prudent method: and for that the said fair being so near her majesty's royal person and government; by seditious and unreasonable men; taking thereby occasion to execute their most wicked and treasonable designs. Wherefore, and because the said fair, as it was then used, both actually was, and had so fatal a tendency to the corruption of her majesty's subjects, violation of her peace, and the danger of her person; they humbly conceived it worthy the care of those in power and authority to rectify the same, &amp;c.</QUOTE>  
<p>The consequence was that the fair was abolished for that time; but having been revived, the place was covered with booths, temporary theatres, and every incitement to low pleasure; but it received its final dissolution during the reign of George II. when a riot having commenced, a peace officer was killed in endeavouring to quell it.

<p>We will now finally quit this part of Westminster, by a brief notice of Tyburn. 
<p>The manor of Tyburn contained <num value="5">five</num> hides of land belonging to the convent of Barking, to which it was granted by the crown at the conquest. Having passed through various hands, part of it was given by William, marquis of Berkeley, to sir Reginald Bray, prime minister to Henry VIII.; the other portions belonged to lord Bergavenny, the earl of Derby, and the earl of Surrey. 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1583"><year reg="1583">1583</year></datestruct>, queen Elizabeth granted a lease of it to Edward Forest, for <num value="21">twenty-one</num> years, at the annual rent of <measure value="16l. 11s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="16">16</num>l. <num value="11">11</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> 
<p>The whole manor and its appurtenances was granted to the same family by James I. for the sum of <measure value="829l. 3s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="829">829</num>l. <num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> In the year <datestruct value="1710"><year reg="1710">1710</year></datestruct> it was purchased by John Austin, esq. (afterwards sir John Austin,) by John Holles, duke of Newcastle, whose only daughter and heir married Edward Harley, earl of Oxford and Mortimer. 
<p>The manor now belongs to the duke of Portland.<NOTE><BIBL>Lysons' Env. of London, iii. p. <num value="247">247</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>Mr. Pennant observes, that Tyburn, in the time of Edward III when the gentle Mortimer finished his days here, was called The Elms. The latter name did not come from <hi rend=italics>tye</hi> and <hi rend=italics>burn</hi>, from the ancient manner of capital punishments, but from <hi rend=italics>bourne</hi>, the Saxon word for a brook, which gave name to the manor before the conquest. <pb id="p.366" n="366"> 
<p>Here was also a village and a church, dedicated to St. John the Evangelist, which decaying, was succeeded by that of Marybone. 
<p>The brook of Tyburn, which is now dried up, was so copious in the year <datestruct value="1238"><year reg="1238">1238</year></datestruct>, that it furnished <num value="9">nine</num> conduits for supplying the city with water. 
<p>The lord mayor and aldermen used to repair to a building, called the City Banquetting-house, on the north side of Oxford-street, on horseback, attended by their ladies in waggons, to inspect the conduits, and then to partake of their banquet. 
<p>In <datestruct value="1626--"><year reg="1626">1626</year></datestruct>, Henrietta Maria, queen of Charles I. was enjoined by her priests to walk to Tyburn by way of penance. Her offence is not mentioned, but Charles was so disgusted at this insolence, that it is said he soon after sent them, and all her majesty's French servants, out of the kingdom. 
<p>Returning to Piccadilly we will proceed westward. The White Horse Cellar has long been celebrated as a place from whence numerous coaches to all parts of the west of England start daily. 
<p>At the corner of Berkeley-street, but in Piccadilly, stands 
<div2 type=section id="c.11.12"><HEAD>Devonshire House.</HEAD>
 
<p>This part of the street was formerly called Portugal-street, as far as the turnpike at Hyde Park corner. A long time subsequent to the year <datestruct value="1700"><year reg="1700">1700</year></datestruct> this mansion was the last house in the street. It has been rebuilt, and recedes a little from the rest of the houses in the street. There is nothing in its exterior appearance to recommend it to particular notice; but its interior is richly stored with some of the finest works of art in any private collection. Here are the productions of Titiano, Guido, Tintoretto, Salvator Rosa, Rembrandt, Carlo Cagnani, and others. The portrait of Philip II. of Spain, by Titiano, is reckoned uncommonly fine; and the picture by Salvator Rosa, is <num value="1">one</num> of the best in existence of this great master's productions. Rembrandt's Jewish Rabbi is also deserving of particular notice; nor should Tintoretto's portrait of Marc Antonio de Dominis be overlooked. This person was the archbishop of Spalatro. 
<p>Here also are portraits of Hampden's friend, Arthur Goodwin; Jane, lady Wharton; the famous lord Falkland; sir Thomas Brown, his lady, and <num value="4">four</num> daughters, painted by Dobson; Carlo Cagnani, by himself; the old countess of Desmond, and many others. 
<p>In the ancient mansion lived Christiana, wife of William, <num value="2">second</num> earl of Devon, in great splendour and hospitality. She died, at an advanced age, in the year <datestruct value="1674"><year reg="1674">1674</year></datestruct>. 
<p>According to Pennant, this house was, in her days, the great resort of wits.  <QUOTE> Waller made it his theatre; and Denham is said here to have prated more than ever.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Pennant's London.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> duke of Devonshire took down the house, and built <pb id="p.367" n="367"> another; which was destroyed by fire, in the reign of George II; after which the present building was constructed from <num value="1">one</num> of Kent's designs, at an expense of <measure value="20000l." type=currency><num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> pounds</measure>, including <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">one thousand</num> pounds</measure> presented by the <num value="3">third</num> duke to the artist for his plans, &amp;c. 
<p>The apartments are very grand, and are built in a capital style. 
<p>Hyde Park corner is remarkable as the site from whence distances are usually taken to all places west of London. It is <num value="1">one</num> of the principal entrances; and, from its elevation, and the number of elegant structures adjoining and in progression, cannot fail of impressing very powerfully the ideas of strangers visiting the metropolis. 
<p>The mass of buildings, erected on the north side of the street, from the designs of the Adams', Apsley house,<NOTE>At the present time (<datestruct VALUE="1828-10--"><month reg="10">Oct.</month> <year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>) being enlarged with an elegant front of stone, the lower part rusticated.</NOTE> built by the lord chancellor Bathurst, now the residence of the duke of Wellington; Hyde Park, and the enchanting views which in every quarter attract the eye, form such an assemblage of picturesque beauty, as is seldom to be met with at the entrance of a vast and populous city. 
<div2 type=section id="c.11.13"><HEAD>Knightsbridge.</HEAD>
 
<p>This is a small hamlet on the great western road, about a mile east of Kensington church. It was formerly in the parish of St. Martins in the Fields, but now belongs to that of St. George, Hanover square. Here was formerly a lazar house, or hospital, held under the church of Westminster, and destitute of endowment, though the patients were usually <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40">forty</num> in number. When, or by whom, this hospital was erected, is not known, but that it was of ancient origin is certain; for in <datestruct value="1629--"><year reg="1629">1629</year></datestruct>, the inhabitants petitioned the bishop of London for leave to rebuild the chapel belonging to this house at their own cost and charges. It is a neat brick building; over the door is inscribed  <QUOTE>Knightsbridge chapel, <datestruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE>  
<p>It appears that this part of the western road was not very safe in the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century, as the following remark occurs in some MS. additions to Norden's <title>Speculum Britanniae</title>:  <QUOTE> Kingesbridge, commonly called Stone bridge, is near Hyde Park corner, where I wish no good man to walk too late, unless he can make his partie good.</QUOTE>  A bridge still remains, (the boundary of St. George's parish from Kensington) over the shallow stream which crosses the high road in the vicinity of this chapel. 
<p>Near Hyde Park corner, on the south side of the road, stands 
<div2 type=section id="c.11.14"><HEAD>St. George's Hospital.</HEAD>
 
<p>This undertaking was set on fool, in the year <datestruct value="1733"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>, by some gentlemen who had been concerned in a charity of a similar description in Chapel-street, Westminster. But the house in which that institution had been carried on, being old and ruinous, it was <pb id="p.368" n="368"> found necessary to remove, when a considerable number, but not the majority, gave the preference to this building, which had been the residence of lord Lanesborough, who died there in <datestruct value="1724--"><year reg="1724">1724</year></datestruct>, but was then vacant. Having determined upon this spot, and being supported by the medical department, the minority separated from the old institution, and solicited subscriptions for their new establishment, with such zeal, that in less than <num value="3">three</num> months, the wings were built and in a condition to receive patients. 
<p>This hospital enjoys a fine situation, and has all the benefit of a clear and pure air. It is a very neat building, and though it is extremely plain, yet is not devoid of ornament. It has <num value="2">two</num> small wings, and a large front, with only <num value="1">one</num> door, which is in the middle, and to which there is an ascent by a few steps. On the top of this part of the building is a pediment raised above the rest of the edifice; and under this ornament is a stone with an inscription, expressing the noble use to which this structure is applied. 
<p>The present building will be taken down, and a new edifice erected a little south of it. 
<p>The manor of Knightsbridge belongs to the church at Westminster; they were in possession of it as early as the reign of Edward I.; during the temporary alienation of the church lands in the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, it appears to have been the property of sir George Stonehouse. 
<p>Returning to Hyde Park corner, and turning south, we enter the Green Park; and proceeding down Constitution hill, arrive at 
<div2 type=section id="c.11.15"><HEAD>St. George's Palace.</HEAD>
 
<p>St. George's Palace, formerly Buckingham House, which was erected in <datestruct value="1703--"><year reg="1703">1703</year></datestruct>, on the site of what was originally called the Mulberry gardens; the author of the New View of London, mentions its vicinity to Arlington house,<NOTE>Celebrated by <BIBL>Charles Dryden, in <title>Horti Arlingtoniani, ad. el.

<p>The editors of  <QUOTE>London and its Environs described,</QUOTE>  <num value="8">8</num>vo. <datestruct value="1761--"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>, have preserved a letter written by this nobleman to the duke of Shrewsbury, which accurately and elegantly describes Buckingham house--<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>The avenues to the house are along St. James's park, through rows of goodly elms on <num value="1">one</num> hand, and gay flourishing limes on the other; that for coaches, this for walking; with the Mall lying betwixt them. This reaches to an iron pallisade that encompasses a square court, which has in the midst a great basin with statues and water-works; and from its entrance rises all the way imperceptibly, till we mount to a terrace in the front of a large hall, paved with square white stones, mixed with a dark coloured <pb id="p.369" n="369"> marble; the walls of it covered with a set of pictures, done in the school of Raphael. 
<p>Out of this on the right hand we go into a parlour <num value="33">thirty-three</num> feet by <num value="39">thirty-nine</num>, with a niche <num value="15">fifteen</num> feet broad for a beaufet, paved with white marble, and placed within an arch, with pilasters of divers colours, the upper part of which, as high as the ceiling, is painted by Ricci. From hence we pass through a suite of large rooms, into a bed-chamber of <num value="34">thirty-four</num> feet by <num value="27">twenty-seven</num>; within it is a large closet that opens into a green-house. 
<p>On the left hand of the hall are <num value="3">three</num> stone arches, supported by <num value="3">three</num> Corinthian pillars, under <num value="1">one</num> of which we go up. <num value="48">forty-eight</num> steps, <num value="10">ten</num> feet broad, each step of <num value="1">one</num> entire Portland stone. These stairs, by the help of <num value="2">two</num> resting-places, are so very easy, there is no need of leaning on the iron balluster. The walls are painted with the story of Dido; whom, though the poet was obliged to despatch away mournfully, in order to make room for Lavinia, the better natured painter has brought no further than to that fatal cave, where the lovers appear just entering. 
<p>The roof of this staircase, which is <num value="55">fifty-five</num> feet from the ground, is <num value="40">forty</num> feet by <num value="36">thirty-six</num>, filled with the figures of gods and goddesses. In the midst is Juno, condescending to beg assistance from Venus, to bring about a marriage which the Fates intended should he the ruin of her own darling queen and people. By which that sublime poet intimates, that we should never be over-eager for any thing, either in our pursuits or our prayers, lest what we endeavour or ask too violently for our interest, should be granted us by Providence only in order to our ruin. 
<p>The bas-reliefs and all the little squares above are all episodical paintings of the same story: and the largeness of the whole had admitted of a sure remedy against any decay of the colours from saltpetre in the wall, by making another of oak laths <num value="4">four</num> inches within it, and so primed over like a picture. 
<p>From a wide landing-place on the stairs' head, a great double door opens into an apartment of the same dimensions with that below, only <num value="3">three</num> feet higher: notwithstanding which, it would appear too low, if the higher saloon had not been divided from it. The <num value="1">first</num> room of this floor has within it a closet of original pictures, which yet are not so entertaining as the delightful prospect from the windows. Out of the <num value="2">second</num> room a pair of great doors give entrance into the saloon, which is <num value="35">thirty-five</num> feet high, <num value="36">thirty-six</num> broad, and <num value="45">forty-five</num> long; in the midst of its roof a round picture of Gentileschi, eighteen feet in diameter, represents the Muses playing in concert to Apollo lying along a cloud to hear them. The rest of the room is adorned with paintings relating to arts and sciences; and underneath divers original pictures hang all in good lights, by the help of an upper row of windows which drowns the glaring. 
<p>Much of this seems appertaining to parade; and therefore I am <pb id="p.370" n="370"> glad to leave it, to describe the rest, which is for conveniency. At <num value="1">first</num>, a covered passage from the kitchen without doors, and another down to the cellars and all the offices within. Near this, a large and lightsome back stairs leads up to such an entry above, as secures our private bed-chamber both from noise and cold. Here we have necessary dressing-rooms and closets, from which are the pleasantest views of all the house, with a little door for communication betwixt this private apartment and the great <num value="1">one</num>. 
<p>These stairs, and those of the same kind at the other end of the house, carrying us up to the highest story, are fitted for the women and children, with the floors so contrived as to prevent all noiseover my wife's head. In mentioning the court at <num value="1">first</num>, I forgot the <num value="2">two</num> wings in it, built on stone arches, which join the house bycorridores, supported by Ionic pillars. In <num value="1">one</num> of those wings is a large kitchen, <num value="30">thirty</num> feet high, with an open cupola on the top; near it a larder, brewhouse, and laundry, with rooms over them for servants; the upper sort of servants are lodged in the other wing,, which has also <num value="2">two</num> wardrobes, and a store-room for fruit. 
<p>On the top of all, a leaden cistern, holding <num value="50">fifty</num> tons of water, driven up by an engine from the Thames, supplies all the water-works in the courts and gardens which lie quite round the house; through <num value="1">one</num> of which a grass-walk conducts to the stables, built round a court, with <num value="6">six</num> coach-houses and <num value="40">forty</num> stalls. I will add but <num value="1">one</num> thing before I carry you into the garden, and that is about walking too, but it is on the top of all the house, which being covered with smooth milled lead, and defended by a parapet of ballusters from all apprehension as well as danger, entertains the eye with a far distant prospect of hills and dales, and near <num value="1">one</num> of parks and gardens. To these gardens we go down from the house by <num value="7">seven</num> steps into a grand walk that reaches across the garden, with a covered arbour at each end of it. Another of <num value="30">thirty</num> feet broad leads from the front of the house, and lies between <num value="2">two</num> groves of tall lime-trees, planted in several equal ranks, upon a carpet of grass; the outside of these groves are bordered with tubs of bays and orange-trees. At the end of this broad walk you go up to a terrace <num value="400">four hundred</num> paces long, with a large semicircle in the middle, from whence is beheld the queen's <num value="2">two</num> parks, and a great part of Surrey; then going down a few steps, you walk on the bank of a canal, <num value="600">600</num> yards long and <num value="17">seventeen</num> broad, with <num value="2">two</num> rows of limes on each side of it. On <num value="1">one</num> side of this terrace, a wall, covered with roses and jessamines, is made low, to admit the view of a meadow full of cattle just under it (no disagreeable object in the midst of a great city,) and at each end a descent into parterres, with fountains and water-works. From the biggest of these parterres we pass into a little square garden; below all this is a kitchen garden, full of the best sorts of fruits, and which has several walks in it for the coldest weather.</QUOTE>
 
<p>Thus for the duke's own description: several alterations were <pb id="p.371" n="371"> subsequently made. The  <QUOTE>goodly elms and gay flourishing limes,</QUOTE>  went to decay. The  <QUOTE>iron pallisade</QUOTE>  assumed a more modern and simple form; and of the  <QUOTE>great bason with statues and waterworks,</QUOTE>  no traces remained when Mr. Nightingale visited the palace. Many of these statues were deposited in the famous lead statue yard, in Piccadilly; but that also has now ceased to exist. <NOTE><BIBL>Gent. Mag. vl. Ixxxv. p. <num value="36">36</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The terrace mentioned in the duke's description was entirely done away. The  <QUOTE>covered passage from the kitchen</QUOTE>  was built up; the  <QUOTE>corridores supported on Ionic pillars,</QUOTE>  was filled in with brick work, and modern door-ways, windows, with compartments over them, inserted therein, with strings, plinth, &amp;c. constituting concealed passages from the wings to the house. The duke's  <QUOTE>kitchen, with an open cupola, at top,</QUOTE>  was no where to be found. 
<p>The Gentleman's Magazine, above quoted, adds,  <QUOTE>that Colin Campbell's plan, as seen externally, is now nearly the same, with the exception of the pallisade, great bason, covered passages, the building up of the corridores, terrace, or flight of steps, and an additional door-way, to the left wing. His front, the pilasters at the extremity of the line taken away, as is the terrace; circular pediment to the door-way, altered to a triangular <num value="1">one</num>. The festoons of flowers and fruit, which were under the windows of the principal floor, are now cut out, and in their place the side ballustrades remain in continuation; cills of <num value="3">three</num> mouldings only remain under the windows of the principal floor; a continued string occupies their place to the hall story; to the attic floor, architraves; to the <num value="4">four</num> sides of the windows of the wings common modern cills; additions of a frieze and cornice have been made to the architraves of the windows of the hall and the principal floors. The inscription in the frieze is painted out; the statues on the dwarf pilasters are taken away, as also are the vases from the corridores. The pediments which were on the dormer windows of the wings have given place to a flat head; and there is an additional door-way to the left wing made out with common scrolls, cornice, &amp;c. An extensive library has also been added to the place.</QUOTE>  
<p>The front was of red brick, with white pilasters, entablatures, door and window frames. Had the house been of stone, the Ionic wings and centre might have had a far better effect.<NOTE><BIBL>Malcolm, vol. iv. p. <num value="263">263</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The cartoons of Raffaello which formerly decorated this palace have been removed to Hampton-court. Besides several others by various masters, many of Mr. West's admirable productions adorned this house, particularly the following: Cyrus presented to his grandfather; Regulus leaving Rome on his return to Carthage; death of the chevalier Bayard; death of general Wolfe; death of Epaminondas; Hannibal vowing enmity to the Romans; the wife of Arminius brought captive to the emperor Germanicus. 
<p>Such was the state of Buckingham-house till the year <datestruct value="1825"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, when the house of commons, on the motion of the premier, made a <pb id="p.372" n="372"> considerable grant towards altering and refitting up this house as the principal palace of his majesty. The architect appointed was John Nash, esq. and at the present time an immense expence has been incurred without producing such an edifice as the nation fully expected for the residence of their sovereign. 
<p>The palace is very extensive, and occupies <num value="3">three</num> sides of a quadrangle; the <num value="4">four</num> sides will, when the structure is completed, be closed by a handsome railing on each side of a magnificent arch constructed entirely of marble; it is intended to be an imitation of the arch of Constantine. Of the main building, it is impossible to speak in praise; the design is frittered into a multiplicity of parts, and the detail is in a style of littleness unbecoming a building of so exalted a nature. 
<p>The eastern elevation being the principal front is the most ornamental; it consists of <num value="3">three</num> stories in elevation, besides a <num value="4">fourth</num> concealed by the ballustrade; the <num value="1">first</num> story is fronted by a colonnade or continued portico of the Greek Doric order, broken into occasionally by projecting parts of the whole main building; the columns are iron, the frieze is omitted, the architrave and cornice are stone, the order is surmounted by a ballustrade. In the centre of the building is a <num value="2">second</num> order of architecture, the Corinthian, which is displayed in a portico composed of <num value="8">eight</num> columns in pairs, the lower order being similarly arranged for the sake of uniformity; the upper order is surmounted by its entablature with a richly sculptured frieze, and the whole is crowned with a pediment, in the tympanum of which is intended to be an alto-relievo, representing  <QUOTE>the triumph of Britannia,</QUOTE>  by Mr. Bailey, on the acroteria are <num value="3">three</num> full sized statues. This portico projects sufficiently to allow of a carriage passing under it. 
<p>The view of the dome of the garden front behind this portico, is universally considered a great eye-sore from its total want of ornament. At the distance of <num value="3">three</num> divisions of the main building are other porticoes composed of <num value="4">four</num> columns in pairs; on the entablature groups of military and naval trophies; an unsightly attic forms a bad finish to these porticoes; the main building has large and handsome windows between the porticoes, and the elevation is finished with the entablature continued from the porticoes, and surmounted by a ballustrade. The original wings were broken into <num value="3">three</num> distinct piles of buildings, a fault so glaring as to occasion their total re-construction; they have been finished in an uniform but plainer style with the principal front; the ends of each wing have a portico, the upper order consisting of <num value="4">four</num> columns surmounted with a pediment, the tympanum to be embellished with sculptures, having reference to the central group, and on the acroteria will be statues. The north and south fronts are nearly uniform, but the designs are far from complete, owing to the alteration which has taken place; a colonnade or continued portico having a concaved portion in the centre decorates the basement. <pb id="p.373" n="373"> 
<p>The chapel is an octagon situated on the south side at the junction of the wing with the main building; it is intended to be finished in the style of the tower of the winds at Athens. The garden front is deemed the finest piece of architecture; the basement is fronted by a raised terrace guarded by a ballustrade, above this the elevation shews <num value="4">four</num> stories in height, the lower rusticated and pierced with windows and entrances; it serves as a stylobate to the upper order, which is also the Corinthian. In width the front is broken by <num value="5">five</num> projections, the central is a circular bow decorated with a perystyle of columns, and crowned with an attic and spherical dome, the unlucky object which has been visited with such severity of criticism; the other projections are copies of the minor porticoes in the principal front; the lower stories are finished between the projections with a ballustrade, and the elevation with the entablature of the order which forms a crowning member throughout the building. At the extremities of the terrace are pavillions resembling Grecian temples of the Ionic order. 
<p>The gardens have been completely altered. In order to conceal from the windows of the palace, the great pile of stabling lately erected in Pimlico, a large artificial mound has been raised, and planted with curious shrubs and trees. Behind this a fish pond has been formed; the remainder is laid out in parterres and shrubberies. 
<p>The entrance to the gardens from Piccadilly is through a splendid arch, an imitation of the arch of Severus at Rome, the architecture from the temple of Jupiter Stator, in the same city. It is intended to be richly decorated with statues and reliefs, and surmounted by a group of sculpture. The architect is John Nash, esq. 
<p>The screen of the Ionic order opposite which forms the entrance to Hyde park consists of <num value="3">three</num> arches united by an open colonnade. The order is Ionic; the columns stand on a stylobate about <num value="6">six</num> feet in height; the centre arch has <num value="2">two</num> pair of insulated columns ranged at the sides of the entrance; the side arches have single columns grouped with antae, attached in like manner to the piers; the intervals between the arches are occupied by colonnades composed respectively of <num value="6">six</num> columns; the whole is crowned with an entablature and blocking course. The centre arch is crowned with a heavy acroterium, which is sculptured in basso relievo with a procession taken from the Temple of Theseus at Athens, and finished with a sub-cornice. Both faces of the screen are alike; <num value="2">two</num> subordinate entrances for foot passengers form a kind of wing in each side the main structure. The lodge is a small temple of the Greek Doric order. The architect of the building is Decimus Burton, esq. and the sculptor R. Westmacott, esq.

<p>This demesne formerly belonged to the abbots and canons of Westminster abbey; but Henry VIII. obtained it in exchange for other lands. Notwithstanding its present very great extent, it <pb id="p.374" n="374"> was originally much larger than even at present, being much reduced by the enclosure of Kensington-gardens.<NOTE>Kensington palace is in the parish of St. Mary, Kensington.</NOTE> From a survey made in the year <datestruct value="1652"><year reg="1652">1652</year></datestruct>, Hyde park contained <num value="620">six hundred and twenty</num> acres, valued at <measure value="894l. 13s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="894">894</num>l. <num value="13">13</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> per annum; the timber growing thereupon was valued at the sum of <measure value="4779l. 19s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="4779">4,779</num>l. <num value="19">19</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure>; the deer at <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">300</num>l.</measure>; the materials of a lodge at <measure value="120l." type=currency><num value="120">120</num>l.</measure>; and those of a building designed for a banquetting-house, at <measure value="125l." type=currency><num value="125">125</num>l.</measure> <measure value="12s." type=currency><num value="12">12</num>s.</measure> The park was divided into lots, and being sold to several purchasers, produced the sum of <measure value="17068l. 6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="17068">17,068</num>l. <num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> including the timber and deer.

<p>The following description of the diversions of Hyde park, about that time, will not perhaps be unacceptable:  <QUOTE><datestruct VALUE="1654-05-1"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg=1>1</day>, <year reg=1654>1654</year></datestruct>. This day was more observed by people going a maying than for divers years past. Great resort to Hyde park; many <num value="100">hundred</num> of rich coaches, and gallants in attire, but most shameful powdered hair men, and painted spotted women, some men plaid with a silver ball, and some took their recreation, but his highness the lord protector went not thither, nor any of the lords of the council.</QUOTE>  It was about this tine that Cromwell met with an accident in Hyde park, which had near cost him his life. Taking the air there <num value="1">one</num> day with secretary Therloe, in his own coach and <num value="6">six</num>, he chose to, turn charioteer but the horses proving ungovernable, he was thrown from the box, and in his fall discharged <num value="1">one</num> of his pocket pistols. 
<p>This extensive piece of ground is a place of singular beauty, and has a fine piece of water, somewhat ridiculously called The Serpentine River, which was formed in the year <datestruct value="1730"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>, by enlarging the bed of a stream flowing through the park, which, taking its rise at Bayswater, on the Uxbridge-road, falls into the Thames at Ranelagh. 
<p>An intelligent writer in the Gentleman's Magazine for April and <datestruct VALUE="1815-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>, has suggested several valuable improvements in this river. He remarks that, whoever rides or walks along the south side of the river, must be struck with the very disagreeable effect of the head that now interrupts the continuation that might be given to that beautiful piece of water in a hollow, between rising and varied banks (as by this writer's improvements they would then be made), clothed with wood, amongst which its termination might be hid. This should be done with a simple and easy flow, as there is nothing to justify any very sudden turns or abrupt breaks, which would only produce littleness and confusion. 
<p>The walk above-mentioned, when separated from the rides by a rail, and joined to that above it, near the garden-gate, would be <num value="1">one</num> of the most beautiful of any in the park. That in the gardens would <pb id="p.375" n="375"> be at least equally so, by being carried in a winding manner along the <num value="2">two</num> sides of the water, which it would look down upon, and command the reaches of. Several other almost equally judicious and important alterations are suggested in the above valuable work. 
<p>Some years ago Hyde park was somewhat deficient in wood, many of the old trees being much decayed; but since the time alluded to, many plantations have been made, and its general appearance is now greatly enlivened. 
<p>On the north side of the Serpentine river, are the lodge and gardens of the keeper, which have a very pleasing and picturesque effect. The powder magazine, however, takes off from the beauty. 
<p>Besides being the most fashionable of our Sunday promenades, Hyde park is used for field days of the horse and foot guards, and for some reviews. 
<p>Since the accession of his present majesty, great improvements have been made in the entrances to Hyde park. Elegant lodges and gates have been erected opposite Grosvenor-street and Stanhope-street; they are of the Doric order, from the designs of Decimus Burton, esq. and were erected in <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct>. The wall has been taken down from Hyde-park-corner towards Knightsbridge, and a light iron railing substituted. The new gate at Hyde-park-corner has been already noticed;<NOTE><BIBL>Vide ante, p. <num value="373">373</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> and a new walk, with handsome railings, has been formed from the above gate to the <num value="1">one</num> opposite Stanhope-street. 
<p>At the south-east corner of Hyde Park, is the gigantic and absurd 
<div2 type=section id="c.11.17"><HEAD>Statue of Achilles.</HEAD>
 
<p>This figure of a naked warrior is eighteen feet in height, and is placed on a massy pedestal of granite, on which is the following inscription: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>To Arthur, duke of Wellington, and his brave companions in arms, this statue of Achilles, cast from cannon taken in the battles of Salamanca, Vittoria, Toulouse and Waterloo, is inscribed by their country women.</QUOTE>

<p>This statue was executed by Mr. Westmacott, and is a copy of an ancient bronze figure placed on the Quirinal hill at Rome, where it was grouped with a horse which was discovered near it. Antiquaries have conjectured that the hero intended to be represented was Castor, the patron of the art of horsemanship. Others conceive the horse to have made no part of the original group, and suppose the statue to be that of an ancient <foreign lang=la>athleta</foreign>, or of Achilles. This last idea has been adopted by Mr. Westmacott, who has placed a <pb id="p.376" n="376"> Grecian shield on his left arm.  <QUOTE> The appropriation of such a statue to an English military hero of the present age is extremely absurd, and will be a lasting reproach to the persons who chose it; for it has no analogy to England, to Wellington, to the army, or to the arts or customs of our times.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Picture of London, <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>, p. <num value="195">195</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>Immense alterations have been made within the few last years between Knightsbridge and Pimlico; an elegant square, the houses of the <num value="1">first</num> character has been formed from the designs of George Basevi esq. It is called Belgrave-square, in compliment to the heir of the noble house of Grosvenor. The principal part was commenced by Mr. Cubilt in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>. At the south west corner is an elegant villa, erected from the designs of H. E. Kendall, esq. for T. R. Kemp, esq. M. P. Here is an elegant church, entitled 
<div2 type=section id="c.11.18"><HEAD>St. Peter's, Pimlico.</HEAD>
 
<p>On the north side of Grosvenor-street, at the eastern extremity of the handsome pile of buildings called Wilton-place, is situated the new church of St. Peter. It is placed in an area, partly paved, and the remainder laid down in grass; the whole enclosed with a handsome iron railing. The plan shows an oblong square, with a portico and lobbies at the west, and a chancel and vestries at the east end. The breadth of the principal front is occupied by a portico composed of <num value="6">six</num> fluted Ionic columns, resting on a flight of steps, and sustaining the entablature of the order, surmounted by a pediment; in the wall, at the back of the portico, are <num value="3">three</num> lintelled doorways, the heads surmounted with cornices resting on consoles; the ceiling is horizontal in the centre, and coved at the sides. A low attic rises from the roof of the church to a height equal with the apex of the pediment; it is crowned with a cornice and blocking-course, and again surmounted by an acroterium of nearly its own height, but in breadth only equal to <num value="2">two</num> thirds of the former member; this is again surmounted by a sub-cornice and blocking-course, from the middle of which rises the tower. This structure is made into <num value="2">two</num> stories: the <num value="1">first</num> is square; it commences with a pedestal, having a circular dial in the dado; the superstructure has an arched window between <num value="2">two</num> Ionic columns; the angles finished with antae; this story is crowned with the entablature of the order, surmounted by square acroteria, finished with angular caps at the angles. The <num value="2">second</num> story is small in proportion to the last; it takes a circular form, and is composed of a pedestal covered with a circular dome; the dado is enriched with sunk pannels, and the cornice with Grecian tiles: the whole is surmounted by a neat cross. Every aspect of the tower is uniform with the west front. The flanks of the church are alike. The <num value="1">first</num> division from the west is separated from the rest of the wall by antae; it contains a lintelled and a circular window in succession; the rest of the wall is <pb id="p.377" n="377"> occupied by <num value="5">five</num> lofty and well proportioned arched windows; the walls are built of brick resting on a plinth of granite, and crowned with the entablature continued from the portico; the angles are guarded by antae; the flanks of the attics are finished with pediments. The vestries have lintelled doorways in the sides and ends, and are finished with an entablature at about half the height of the church: the angles are guarded by antae. The chancel has no window in the eastern wall, but the flanks have arched windows corresponding with the church; the walls are finished with the continued entablature. A porch, with an arched doorway, in front of the wall, connects the <num value="2">two</num> vestries. 
<p>The interior is approached by a lobby occupying the basement story of the tower, and by lateral ones which contain stairs to the galleries; it is occupied on <num value="3">three</num> sides by a spacious gallery, sustained on Ionic columns; the chancel is separated from the church by an ascent of <num value="5">five</num> steps, <num value="2">two</num> at the commencement where the pulpit is situated, and <num value="3">three</num> at the recessed portion which contains the altar; the angles of this recess are guarded by pilasters of the Corinthian order, surmounted by their entablature; a modillion cornice from which is continued round the entire building, and serves as an impost to the ceiling, which is a segmental arched vault made by ribs into divisions corresponding with the windows, and occupied by sunk pannels; in the central <num value="1">one</num> of each division is an expanded flower. The chancel has a horizontal ceiling pannelled by flying cornices; the soffits enriched with flowers. The altar is enclosed in an oak ballustrade. The screen is also of oak; it is made into compartments by antae; the central <num value="1">one</num> is square, and occupied by a pannel of crimson velvet framed; the <num value="2">two</num> lateral divisions are smaller, and correspond in their decorations; the more distant divisions, and those against the side walls, contain the usual inscriptions on oak pannels; above the altar-screen is a large oak pannel with gilt mouldings, covered with a pediment; it serves as a relief to Mr. Hilton's magnificent painting of  <QUOTE>Christ crowned with thorns,</QUOTE>  exhibited at Somerset-house in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, and presented to this church by the British Institution in <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>; a painting which does honour to the country, and deserves to rank far above the much vaunted works of most of the old masters. 
<p>An additional gallery at the west end of the church, sustained on Ionic columns, contains the organ and seats for the charity children. The case of the instrument is very neatly ornamented with a mitre, crosiers, and trumpets. 
<p>The pulpit is on the south side of the church: if is octangular, and rests on a pillar of the same form; it is tastefully carved in oak, and has a solid appearance. The reading and clerk's desks are on the opposite side of the area. 
<p>The site of the church was the gift of lord Grosvenor; the sum of <measure value="5555l. 11s. 1d." type=Currency><num value="5555">5,555</num>l. <num value="11">11</num>s. <num value="1">1</num>d.</measure> was granted by the king's commissioners towards the building. The <num value="1">first</num> stone was laid on the <num value="7">7th</num> of <pb id="p.378" n="378"> <datestruct VALUE="1824-09--"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>, and the church was consecrated on the <datestruct VALUE="1827-07-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1827">1827</year></datestruct>. The architect is H. Hakewell, esq. 
<p>Near this church is Eaton-square, a fine piece of ground well laid out; it measures <num value="600">600</num> yards in length, and <num value="120">120</num> yards in breadth. 
<p>In this parish was an ancient manor, called Neyte, or Neate. Mr. Lyson says,  <QUOTE>Edward VI. granted the house called Neate, and all the site, circuit, ambust, and premises thereto belonging, late parcel of the possessions of Westminster abbey, and then situated in the parish of St. Martin's in the fields, to sir Anthony Browne.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Pat. I Edw. VI. p. <num value="9">9</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> There are still some houses, called the Neate-houses, situated near the water side. 
<p>Great improvements have been made in this part of Pimlico; the canal has been widened, and at the northern end is a handsome and commodious dock; which will be found of great advantage to Pimlico and the parts adjacent. 
<div1 type=chapter id="c.12" n="12"><HEAD>History and Topography of the Precinct of the Savoy.</HEAD>
 
<p>This precinct is extra-parochial, and the right of presentation to the chapel is in the lord high treasurer, or the commissioners for executing that office. 
<p>The site of the Savoy Hospital was anciently the seat of Peter, earl of Savoy, uncle to Eleanor, queen to Henry III. on whose death it devolved on the said queen, who, by her letters patent, dated the <datestruct VALUE="-01-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>, <foreign lang=la>anno regni Regis Edwarde primi</foreign> <num value="12">12</num>mo, gave it to her <num value="2">second</num> son, Edmund, afterwards earl of Lancaster, and his heirs. This grant was confirmed to him by his elder brother, king Edward I. by letters patent, dated the <datestruct VALUE="-06-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></datestruct>, in the <num value="21">21st</num> year of his reign. From that time the Savoy was reputed and taken as parcel of the earldom and honour of Lancaster, and was used as their palace during their attendance on the court or in parliament; and descended with the honour to his son, Thomas, earl of Lancaster, who was beheaded for rebelling against Edward II. and the estate devolved on Henry, his younger brother, in the <num value="16">16th</num> year of the reign of the same king. This Henry was earl of Lancaster, Leicester, and Lincoln. He became possessed of the earl of Lincoln's estate, his brother having married the earl of Lincoln's daughter, in consequence of which marriage the Lincoln estate was settled on him and his heirs, after the death of Henry de Lacey, earl of Lincoln, and his wife Margery, countess of Salisbury. On the death of this Henry. earl of Lancaster, his son, of the same name, succeeded to these titles and estates, and was created earl of Derby <num value="12">twelfth</num> of Edward III. and <num value="1">first</num> duke of Lancaster in the <num value="25">twenty-fifth</num> of the same king, by authority of parliament. At which time <pb id="p.379" n="379"> the duchy was erected, and the <foreign lang=la>jura regalia</foreign> and county palatine vested in him in a more full and ample manner. He had power given him during life to appoint his own chancellor, as also his justices for pleas of the crown, and other common pleas within the county. He had also fines and forfeitures, and pardons of life and members, with all other liberties, and <foreign lang=la>jura regalia</foreign> belonging to a county palatine, as fully and entirely as the earl of Chester had, and held within the county palatine of Chester. On the <datestruct VALUE="-03-23"><day reg="23">23rd</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct>, <num value="25">twenty-fifth</num> of Edward III. the said duke died, and left his estate to his <num value="2">two</num> daughters, Matilda and Blanch, as coheiresses. Blanch was married to John of Gaunt, (<num value="4">fourth</num> son of Edward III.) earl of Richmond, and afterwards created duke of Lancaster; and Matilda, married to the duke of Bavaria; who, dying without issue, John, duke of Lancaster, in right of his wife, became entitled to all these estates. From John, duke of Lancaster, they devolved on his eldest son, Henry, created earl of Derby in his father's life time, and on his death duke of Lancaster; who, coming afterwards to be king of England by the name and style of king Henry the <num value="4">Fourth</num>, these estates, of which the duchy of Lancaster consisted, became merged in the crown; and an act passed in the <num value="2">second</num> year of his reign for separating the duchy from the crown of England. And the same year it was granted to his son Henry, with all its liberties and <foreign lang=la>jura regalia</foreign>, to hold to his said son and his heirs, dukes of Lancaster, dissevered from the crown. And by an act passed in the <num value="2">second</num> of Henry V. whensoever any lands should come to the hands of the said king or his heirs, by reason of the duchy of Lancaster, by an escheat or forfeiture, in any future time, the same should in like manner be annexed and incorporated to the said duchy of Lancaster. And it further appears, by an act passed in the <num value="3">third</num> year of the reign of king Henry V. that no gifts, grants, &amp;c. which concerned his sail duchy of Lancaster, or the lauds and profits of the same, or any parcel thereof, or which concerns any lands that in future time should emerge or arise thereto, should pass under any seal, save only the seal of the duchy of Lancaster; and that all others should be deemed and reputed to be void, and of no force or effect Upon the union of the <num value="2">two</num> houses of York and Lancaster by Henry VII. an act passed in the <num value="1">first</num> year of his reign, by which the duchy was to be governed by like officers, and passed by such seals as accustomed, separate from the crown of England, and possessions of the same, as Henry IV. Henry V. Henry VI. or Edward IV. held the same. By the statute of Edward VI. cap. xiv. all colleges, free chapels, and chantries: all land given for finding or maintaining a priest for ever, are given to the king, with a proviso, that all such lands as formerly were within the duchy should be under the survey, order, and government of the officers of the duchy. And lastly, by the statute of the <num value="2">second</num> and <num value="3">third</num> of Philip and Mary, reciting that the king and queen, regarding the <pb id="p.380" n="380"> duchy of Lancaster as <num value="1">one</num> of the stateliest pieces of the queen's ancient inheritance; and that sundry lands, parcel of the duchy, had been exchanged, and the lands taken in exchange had not been annexed to the duchy, enacted, that all lands then parcel of the duchy, or which, on the <num value="28">28th</num> of <datestruct VALUE="-01-1"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=1>first</day></datestruct> Edward VI. were united thereto, by parliament, letters patent, or otherwise, and which have been since sold off, granted, or otherwise severed from the duchy, and which are or shall be returned again to the hands of the said king and queen, or to the heirs and successors of the said queen, in possession or reversion by attainder, escheat forfeiture, or otherwise, and which now be in the hands of the said king and queen, shall, from the time the estates so reverted to king Edward VI. or to the queen, be united or annexed for ever to the duchy of Lancaster, with a clause for annexing lands not exceeding <measure value="2000l." type=currency><num value="2000">2000</num>l.</measure> per annum. By the statute of <num value="1">1st</num> Henry IV. the parliament declared very plainly their sense of the matter as to the king's taking the duchy of Lancaster in his royal capacity, and not in his natural and private capacity. The preamble to the statute is in these words:  <QUOTE>The king, considering that God having of his great grace admitted him to the honourable state of king, so that he could not for certain causes take the name of the duke of Lancaster in his stile; and being desirous that the name of the duke of Lancaster should continue in honour as it had been during the time it was held and enjoyed by his ancestors by consent of parliament, ordains, that Henry, his eldest son, should be duke of Lancaster; and the revenues thereto belonging were limited to be and remain to his said son and his heirs, dukes of Lancaster, dissevered from the crown.</QUOTE>  It appears by the statute for dissolving the lesser monasteries, <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> Henry VIII. that all the lands and revenues thereunto belonging, were directed to be under the rule, government, and survey, of the court of augmentations, (afterwards, by the statute of the <num value="1">first</num> of queen Mary, annexed to the exchequer,) with a proviso that all such lands as should come to the king by virtue of this act, laying within the county palatine, or elsewhere, parcel of the said monasteries, and which were of the foundation of any duke of Lancaster, might, at the pleasure of the king, be appointed and assigned unto the order and survey of the duchy officers. And accordingly the said king, by letters patent, dated the <datestruct VALUE="-07-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, in the <num value="29">twenty-ninth</num> year of his reign, did appoint and assign several lands; namely, the lands of the late dissolved monasteries of Cartmell, Corningshead, Burstow, and Holland, to be under the survey of the duchy; and divers other lands were added, by consent of parliament, by Henry VIII. Edward VI. and also by Philip and Mary. By the statute <num value="37">thirty-seven</num> Henry VIII. all colleges, chantries, and hospitals, having continuance for ever, and being chargeable to the <num value="1">first</num>-fruits and tenths, are given to the king; and are directed by the act to be under the rule and government of the court of augmentations without the clause in favour of the duchy, <pb id="p.381" n="381"> with a clause directing the method of a commission or visitation. And for entering into such chantries and hospitals, and the lands belonging to them, where the governor, master, or incumbent, do not employ the profits according to the intention of the donors. And not only all lands given by virtue of this act, but all lands which shall hereafter accrue to the king's hands, by any such commission or visitation as is directed by the act, shall be within the survey of the court of augmentations. The hospital was accordingly visited in Edward the <num value="6">Sixth</num>'s reign; and the then master and chaplains, by deed under their common seal, dated the <datestruct VALUE="1553-06-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> day of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>, surrendered the revenues thereof, and, among the rest, the site of the Savoy to the said king <foreign lang=la>in cancellaria sua</foreign>, conformable to the directions in the act. The statute <num value="3">third</num> and <num value="4">fourth</num> Philip and Mary, on which the duchy officers lay so much stress, declares, that all lands which on the <datestruct VALUE="-01-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>, <num value="1">first</num> Edward VI. were parcel of the duchy, and since separated, and which are or shall be returned to the queen, her heirs and successors, in possession or reversion; all lands, thus qualified, and coming to the crown, by escheat, forfeiture, or otherwise are directed to be in the survey of the duchy. But there is no general clause to give back to the duchy lands theretofore separated by king Henry VIII. or any former kings, which would be endless, and might be carried so far as to create the greatest confusion in the titles of the king's lands, and in the grants and letters patents that had been made thereof. And as it is plain from the tenor of that act that it only comprehended such lands as had been separated since the accession of Henry VI. (<num value="26">26th</num> <datestruct VALUE="-01-1"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=1>first</day></datestruct> Edward VI.) so the practice of the law immediately after the passing this act, when it must be supposed to be the best understood, was conformable thereto. This act passed <num value="3">third</num> and <num value="4">fourth</num> Philip and Mary; and the next year, viz. <datestruct VALUE="-05-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, <num value="4">fourth</num> and <num value="5">fifth</num> of those princes, the Savoy was refounded, and the site of the Savoy hospital in the Strand is granted them, under the great seal; and the same is there called <QUOTE>nup&lsquo; parcell&lsquo; Ducat.&lsquo; Lanc,&lsquo;</QUOTE>
as it is also called in the charter of foundations of the <datestruct VALUE="-07-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, in the <num value="4">fourth</num> of Henry VIII. The words of the tenendum of both these grants are as follow: <QUOTE lang=la>Tenendum de Nobis heredibz et successoribus n&lsquo;ri in liberam, &amp;c. elemozinam, pro omnibus servitiis quib&lsquo; &lsquo;zcuinq&lsquo;;</QUOTE> and not <QUOTE lang=la>Tenendum de &lsquo;Nobii hered et successoribus n&lsquo;rs nt de Ducatu n&lsquo;ro Lancastrie,</QUOTE> as it would have been expressed if it had been intended to have been held by the duchy. And all proceedings since that time have passed constantly and regularly by authority of the great, or exchequer seal. 
<p>There are few places (says Mr. Malcolm,) in London, which have undergone a more complete alteration and ruin than the Savoy hospital. According to the plates<NOTE><BIBL>Vide Vetusta Monuments, vol. ii.</BIBL></NOTE> published by the society of antiquaries in <datestruct value="1750--"><year reg="1750">1750</year></datestruct>, it was a most extensive and noble building, erected on the south side literally in the Thames. This front 
<pb id="p.382" n="382">
 contained several projections, and <num value="2">two</num> rows of angular mullioned windows. Northward of this was the friery, a court formed by the walls of the body of the hospital, whose ground plan was the shape of the cross. This was more ornamented than the south front; and had large pointed windows, and embattled parapets, lozenged with flints. At the west end of the hospital was the guard-house, used as a receptacle for deserters, and the quarters for <num value="30">thirty</num> men and non-commissioned officers. 
<div2 type=section id="c.12.1"><HEAD>Guard House, Savoy Palace.</HEAD>
<p><FIGURE id="Fig.382"><HEAD>Guard House, Savoy Palace</HEAD></FIGURE> 
<p>This building was secured by a strong buttress, and had a gateway, embellished with Henry the <num value="7">Seventh</num>'s arms, and the badges of the rose and portcullis; above which were <num value="2">two</num> windows, projecting into a semi-sexagon. The west front of the chapel adjoining had nothing particular to recommend it, the windows and doors partaking of that wretched style into which the florid enrichments of our ancestors had degenerated it, in the reign of Henry VIII. On the east side was the burial ground, raised <num value="15">fifteen</num> steps higher than the floor of the chapel; at the south end a small tower, perfectly plain, on the east side of a centrical mounted guard. A few diminutive trees overshadowed the mouldering walls, and gave a picturesque character to the place. 
<div2 type=section id="c.12.2"><HEAD>St. John the Baptist in the Savoy.</HEAD>
 
<p>This chapel, in all exterior points of view, is a very humble specimen of the splendid style of architecture which prevailed in the reign of Henry VII. The structure is remarkable, as the usual church arrangement is departed from; the altar and chancel being at the north instead of the east end. The walls are substantially built with stone, and are all ancient except the west, which was built in <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct> at the destruction of the ancient remains of the Savoy, <pb id="p.383" n="383"> from the ruins of which the materials of this portion appear to have been taken; the south front consists of a square tower in <num value="2">two</num> stories; in the lower story a pointed loop-hole in the south front, and a pointed arch in every aspect of the <num value="2">second</num> story; the elevation is finished with a parapet; the lower story is flanked with <num value="2">two</num> mean looking apartments, above which the wall of the church rises pedimentally without windows. The east wall of the body of the chapel has <num value="5">five</num> low arched windows divided in breadth into <num value="3">three</num> lights by mullions, and perpendicularly into <num value="2">two</num> stories by a transom stone; the upper tier of lights have arched beads enclosing <num value="5">five</num> sweeps, the lower arched heads without sweeps in the <num value="2">second</num> from the north the lower tier of lights is omitted an ancient vestry having formerly stood here upon the vault still used. The north end has a large low arched window divided by <num value="4">four</num> perpendicular mullions; it is entirely walled up. The west side corresponds with the east already described; it has an entrance with a pointed arch between the <num value="1">first</num> and <num value="2">second</num> windows from the north; above the arch is a tablet, with the following inscription :--

<p>This doorway is the only entrance to the chapel by a descent of <num value="5">five</num> oaken steps; the interior is highly interesting, from the beauty of its ceiling, and the remains of the former splendour of this appendage of royalty. The ceiling is horizontal, slightly coved at the sides, where it rests upon an impost cornice situated just above the points of the windows. The coved portion is ornamented with a range of obtusely pointed arches in relief, the horizontal part by quaterfoil and cuspated tracery, forming altogether an harmonious and beautiful design, of a character almost unique; the chapel royal at St. James' has a ceiling somewhat similar, but decidedly inferior. In every quaterfoil is an ornament, the number and variety of which is so great, that only a few can be particularized. The division between the nave and chancel is at the pier between the <num value="2">second</num> and <num value="3">third</num> windows from the altar, it is marked by the pulpit and in the ceiling by a variation in the ornaments. The quaterfoils in the nave are occupied by lions, griffins, greyhounds, antelopes, and falcons, holding banners within wreaths, and among the tracery the portcullis is often repeated, those ornaments being the badges of the houses of York and Lancaster, and the Tudor family. In the chancel the wreaths enclose shields charged with religious emblems, consisting of St. Michael trampling on his adversary, the Pelican, and the implements of our Saviour's passion, being the same ornaments which Dr. Milner describes as existing in a similar <pb id="p.384" n="384"> situation in the choir of Winchester cathedral; the outer range of shields, which immediately succeed to the coveing, have angels holding single implements, as the cross, spear, lance, and sponge, &amp;c. The other shields have the following subjects in groups as the fancy of the sculptor directed, viz. the pillar against which Christ was scourged, the scourges, the cross, and reed, the crown of thorns, nails, hammer, lanthorn, ladder, dice, the faces of Pilate and Caiphas, the sepulchre sealed with <num value="3">three</num> seals; and others commemorative of St. Peter, viz. the cock, the sword with the ear of Malchus, &amp;c.; the whole of the ornaments are in relief; the ground-work is painted of a light blue, the ornaments and reliefs white. The present altar-screen occupies the place of the eastern window with the dado below it; the latter is covered with wainscotting, the former with a painting of red curtains round the decalogue, surmounted by the royal arms. On the wall at the east side still remains an elegant niche, a portion of the ancient altar-screen; it is covered with an hexagonal canopy in <num value="2">two</num> heights; the entire stone-work is hollowed and carved into the most beautiful tracery which art could effect; the style of the architecture is so exactly similar to Henry the <num value="7">seventh</num>'s chapel, that little doubt can exist of both being the work of <num value="1">one</num> architect. The corresponding niche on the west side has been destroyed, to make way for sir Robert Douglas's monument. Splendid indeed must the altar have been before the tasteless alterations, which reduced it to its present state, were effected. A block cornice exists in part on the east wall, but this is interfered with by a monument; and a pointed doorway, in the same wall, corresponding with the entrance to the chapel, once led to the sacristy, formerly situated below the window, which--was noticed in the description of the exterior to be deficient in the lower tier of lights; it now leads to the burial ground. The head of the arch of this doorway is enclosed in a square architrave, above which is a block cornice; and against the southern jamb is a sculptured angel: these remains prove that the chancel must once have been superbly ornamented. The door of oak which occupies this arch is enriched with the singular pannels enclosing scrolls, so often met with in the wood-work of the above era. 
<p>The pulpit, affixed to the pier between the <num value="2">second</num> and <num value="3">third</num> windows from the altar, on the west side of the church, is hexagonal, with a sounding-board; the carving on it marks its construction to have been in the time of James I. The reading and clerk's desks below it are more modern. A gallery crosses the south end, in which is a small organ erected in <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct>; and on the wall of the church above, is painted a choir of cherubs, with the inscription,  <QUOTE>Glory to God in the highest.</QUOTE>  Near the north end of the nave, against the west wall, the niche for holy water still exists. The pewing is situated on each side of a central aisle. 
<p>The monuments are numerous; against the west wall of the chancel is an ancient altar-tomb: the dado enriched with <pb id="p.385" n="385"> sculptured quatrefoils, inclosing the <num value="3">three</num> following shields of arms: <num value="1">1st</num>, a chevron between <num value="3">three</num> martlets; <num value="2">2nd</num>, the same impaling paley of <num value="5">five</num>, a chief lozengy; <num value="3">3rd</num>, the same as the last. The whole is covered with a canopy composed of an obtuse arch, and surmounted by a cornice sustained on <num value="2">two</num> columns, the soffit of the canopy being pannelled. Near this is a small monument, with a minute statue of a praying lady between <num value="2">two</num> columns; the inscription is illegible. 
<p>Against the north wall, and occupying the place of <num value="1">one</num> of the arches before observed, is a splendid monument to the memory of sir Robert Douglas and his lady; he is represented in armour reclining on his right arm, on a slab; his other hand on his sword; on his head a fillet, with a bead round the edges; at his feet his coat of arms; and behind him his lady is kneeling in a niche: the whole is surmounted by a lofty canopy, on the top of which is a statue of Time. 
<p>The eastern niche has been converted into a monument by persons possessing more taste than those who constructed the <num value="1">one</num> last described. It is occupied by a kneeling lady, with a countess's coronet on her head: in the side compartments are the following shields of arms: <num value="1">1st</num>. Barry nebule or and <hi rend=italics>sable</hi>, Blount; <num value="2">2nd</num>, the same impaling barry, of <num value="6">six</num> <hi rend=italics>gu.</hi> and or, on a lozenge. Below the statue is an inscription to the memory of lady Dalhousie, <datestruct value="1663--"><year reg="1663">1663</year></datestruct>. Underneath is an inscription to John Chaworth, who died <datestruct VALUE="1582-03-24"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=24>24</day>, <year reg=1582>1582</year></datestruct>; above is his arms in brass. 
<p>Against the eastern wall is another monument to a recumbent lady with a ruff and gown of the time of Elizabeth; <QUOTE><p>the inscription is gone: it represents lady Arabella, countess dowager of Nottingham. A kneeling lady of the same kind occupies a niche above the doorway,<NOTE>Engraved in <BIBL>Smith's Antiq. of London.</BIBL></NOTE> on this side the building. The inscription is as follows:

<p>In order to make the communication between the Strand and Waterloo-bridge, the principal remains of the ancient palace were <pb id="p.386" n="386"> entirely removed. The only ruin is a small portion of wall at the south-west corner of the church. 
<p>Near the south end of the church is a plain brick building, called  <QUOTE>the German Lutheran church.</QUOTE>  The interior is very handsome, with a gallery; the roof, which is coved, being supported by Ionic pillars, painted in imitation of Sienna marble.

<p>On the site of Beaufort-house and Beaufort-buildings, was a magnificent mansion,<NOTE>Engraved in the plate before noticed, <BIBL>vide ante, p. <num value="246">246</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> entitled, 
<div2 type=section id="c.12.3"><HEAD>Worcester House.</HEAD>
 
<p>This mansion had gardens to the water-side, and had several possessors. In the reign of Henry VIII. it belonged to the see of Carlisle; it was afterwards inhabited by the earls of Bedford, and known by the names of Bedford and Russel-house. From them it came to the earls of Worcester, when it assumed the name of  <QUOTE>Worcester-house.</QUOTE>  Edmund, the last earl of Worcester, died in this house, <datestruct VALUE="1627-03-3"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=3>3</day>, <year reg=1627>1627</year></datestruct>. From him, it descended to his eldest son, Henry, afterwards created duke of Beaufort. This mansion then changed its name to that of  <QUOTE>Beaufort-house,</QUOTE>  but it was soon after pulled down, and a smaller residence built near the Strand. This house was burnt down through the carelessness of a servant, and never rebuilt. Mr. Pennant informs us, that the great earl of Clarendon lived in this house before his own was built, and paid for it the extravagant rent of <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">500</num>l.</measure> per annum. 
<div1 type=chapter id="c.13" n="13"><HEAD>History and Topography of the Inns of Court.</HEAD>
 
<p>The learned Fortescue inclines to the opinion that the inns of court were so denominated, not because the persons resident there followed the profession of the law, but from their being the inns, hospitals, or hotels, where young men of family and other persons attached to the court resided. In process of time, the residents began to associate themselves into fraternities of a collegiate description, and it is not improbable that the majority of them may have devoted themselves to legal studies and pursuits. Persons of rank and opulence sent their sons here, not so much with a view to their following the profession of the law, as to form their manners, improve their minds, and preserve them from the contagion of vicious habits; for in these inns, we are assured,  <QUOTE>all vice was discountenanced and banished, and every thing good and virtuous was taught there; music, dancing, singing, history sacred and profane, and other accomplishments.</QUOTE>  
<p>Among the very ancient inns of court, of which there is no longer any trace, <num value="1">one</num> called Chester inn is said to have been situated on <pb id="p.387" n="387"> the spot where Somerset-house now stands; a <num value="2">second</num> at Dowgate; a <num value="3">third</num> at Paternoster-row; and a <num value="4">fourth</num> somewhere still nearer St. Paul's cathedral, which, in the days of its degradation, was the principal place of business for lawyers. Each practitioner had his own pillar in the cathedral, where he took his stand at stated hours of the day, with a pen and paper book, ready to receive the instructions of clients. So perfectly, indeed, was the practice recognized, that on the making of a sergeant, it was usual for the whole body of sergeants to walk in their robes to St. Paul's, to invest their new brother with his particular pillar of business. 
<p>The number of these inns of court appears, in the reign of Henry III. to have been so much on the increase, that it was thought necessary to restrain them by proclamation. The mayor and sheriffs were commanded by his majesty to proclaim  <QUOTE>through the whole city, and firmly to forbid that any <num value="1">one</num> should set up schools of laws in the said city, and teach the laws there for the time to come.</QUOTE>  
<p>Some of the inns of court which now exist were, however, erected after this prohibition. The number remaining is <num value="13">thirteen</num>, <num value="9">nine</num> of which are within, and <num value="5">five</num> without, the liberties of the city; and all (we believe) extra parochial. 
<p>The inns were anciently of <num value="3">three</num> classes; <num value="2">two</num> of these might properly have been designated the outer and inner; the <num value="3">third</num> bore the name of Sergeant's Inns. The outer were called Inns of Chancery, from their being places of elementary instruction, where young men were taught the nature of chancery writs, which were then considered as developing the <num value="1">first</num> principles of law. Such were Clifford's, Thavies, Barnard's, Staple's, Clement's, Lyon's, New Inn, and some others now extinct. In the reign of Henry the <num value="6">Sixth</num>, there were <num value="10">ten</num> of these lesser inns, each of which contained not less than a <num value="100">hundred</num> students. When persons had made some progress at these inns, they were then admitted into the superior or inner courts, where they perfected their degrees. Of these courts there were <num value="4">four</num>, namely, the Inner and Middle Temple, Gray's Inn, and Lincoln's Inn, which still retain the pre-eminence they originally possessed. At the period of which we have just spoken, none of these inns of court had less than <num value="200">two hundred</num> members. 
<p>The Sergeants' Inns, of which formerly there were <num value="3">three</num>, were of a still higher order than any of the others, being occupied solely by the lawyers, who had been advanced to the dignity of the coif, including the judges, who, though promoted to the bench, call every sergeant their  <QUOTE>brother.</QUOTE>  <num value="1">One</num> of these inns, which was situated about the middle of Fleet-street, was held on a lease from the dean and chapter of York; and on the expiration of the lease, it was not thought proper to renew it. The place, though now differently occupied, still retains the name. Another inn, for the use of sergeants only, was situated in Scroop's court, Holborn, near St. <pb id="p.388" n="388"> Andrew's church. The only Sergeant's Inn at the present day is situated at the south end of Chancery-lane.<NOTE><BIBL>Percy Hist. vol. ii. p. <num value="142">142</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The <num value="2">two</num> great periods of study in the inner and outer courts were termed vacations. <num value="1">One</num> commenced on the <num value="1">first</num> Monday after Lammas; each continued <num value="3">three</num> weeks and <num value="3">three</num> days; and during this period nothing was heard of but readings, and mootings, and boltings, and other learned exercises. 
<p>The attendance of the students at these exercises was, however, entirely voluntary; and being carried on in a barbarous jargon, called Law French, it is not surprising that in the course of time it should have greatly declined, and at last given way to the more comfortable and now venerated practice of eating <num value="1">one</num>'s way to the bar. Ere the <num value="16">16th</num> century had elapsed, the inns-of-court gentleman, once the pattern of  <QUOTE>every thing good and virtuous,</QUOTE>  had become a dissolute idler and gallant.  <QUOTE> When he should be mooting in the hall,</QUOTE>  says Lenton, in his Characterismi,  <QUOTE>he is perhaps mounting in his chamber, as if his father had only sent him to cut capers.</QUOTE>   <QUOTE>All his pursuits, however,</QUOTE>  says the facetious editor of the Percy Histories, <QUOTE>were not so innocent nor so confined in example. Out of doors he was the gayest, boldest Hector to be seen; his beard the bushiest, his rapier the longest, and his hosen and doublet the newest fashioned; no <num value="1">one</num> knew better how to  <Q>quoit</Q>  the  <Q>shove groat shilling,</Q>  or  <Q>beat a knave into a twigger bottle;</Q>  the play house was his hall, and dealing in troth-plights his lawyer's exercise.</QUOTE> In the reign of Henry VIII. an order was made in the Inner Temple, that  <QUOTE>the gentlemen of that company should reform themselves in their disguised apparel, and not wear long beards: and that the treasurer should confer with the other treasurers of court, for an uniform reformation, and take the justices' opinion upon the matter.</QUOTE>  The king afterwards ordered, that  <QUOTE>those who would not reform in their apparel should be expelled;</QUOTE>  and that  <QUOTE>all persons should be put out of commons who wore beards.</QUOTE>  Parliament was also called upon to lend its aid to the reformation of these communities, by an act (<num value="33">33rd</num> Henry VIII.) which prohibited them from playing at shove or slip groats, under a penalty of <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">six</num> shillings and <num value="8">eight</num>-pence</measure> for each offence. Still, however, but little reformation took place. In the reign of Philip and Mary, we find, that the beards had so far maintained their ground, that an order was made in the Inner Temple, that fellows of that house might wear beards, <num value="3">three</num> week's growth, but not longer, under a penalty of <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">twenty</num> shillings</measure>; and in the <num value="1">first</num> of queen Elizabeth, it was in Lincoln's-inn  <QUOTE>ordered, that no fellow of that house should wear a beard above a fortnight's growth,</QUOTE>  under the penalty of loss of commons; and, in case of obstinacy, of final expulsion. Such was the love for long beards, however, that it triumphed at last over every restriction; and, in <datestruct VALUE="1562-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1562">1562</year></datestruct>, all previous orders touching beards were repealed. The long rapier, an appendage of <pb id="p.389" n="389"> a still more obnoxious description than the long beard, did not fare so well. When the would-be-obeyed Elizabeth ordered watches to be set at each gate of the city, to take measure of every man's sword that it did not exceed <num value="3">three</num> feet, the inns of court gentlemen were obliged to conform, like others, to this standard; and were farther obliged to lay their rapiers aside on entering their halls, and to content themselves with the dagger behind. 
<p>The Christmas revels of the inns of court were particularly distinguished for their wildness and licentiousness. Every day there was nothing but  <QUOTE>feasting, music, singing, dancing, dicing, to which last all comers were admitted; and (the play) was so high that the box-money amounted to <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> pounds</measure> a night; which, with a small contribution from each student, has defrayed the charges of the whole Christmas. Sometimes, when they had a young gentleman who would be profuse, they created him prince, and he had all his officers, and a court suitable to <num value="1">one</num> with that title. At such times, most of the principal nobility, officers of state, &amp;c. were splendidly entertained. These sports and feastings used to last from All Saints day to Candlemas, in each house; and some young student was chosen master of the revels.</QUOTE>  We learn farther, from a statutory prohibition of the reign of Henry VIII. that during this saturnalia, bands of these revellers used to go about armed out of the precincts, for the legal purposes of breaking open houses and chambers, and  <QUOTE>to take things in the name of rent and distress.</QUOTE>  Even as late as the reign of Charles I. this sort of perambulation was complained of. 
<p>The gay and chivalric character which the inns of court gentlemen now affected, was remarkably displayed in a grand masque with which they entertained Charles I. his queen, and their whole court, on Candlemas day, <datestruct value="1634--"><year reg="1634">1634</year></datestruct>. The object of this exhibition, as we are told by Whitelocke, who was <num value="1">one</num> of the committee of the Middle Temple for managing it, was to manifest their opinion of Prynne's new learning, and serve to confute his  <QUOTE>Histriomastix against Interludes.</QUOTE>  The masquers assembled towards the evening, at Ely House, Holborn, and proceeded by torch light to the banquetting house at Whitehall. At the head of the cavalcade were <num value="20">twenty</num> footmen, or marshal's men, who cleared the streets, dressed in scarlet liveries trimmed with silver lace, and carrying each a sword, a baton, and a torch; then came the marshal himself,  <QUOTE>Mr. Darrel, of Lincoln's-inn, who was afterwards knighted by the king, an extraordinary handsome proper gentleman, mounted upon <num value="1">one</num> of the king's best horses and richest saddles; his own habit exceeding rich and glorious.</QUOTE>  The marshal was followed by about a dozen trumpeters, preceding <num value="100">one hundred</num> gentlemen of the inns of court,  <QUOTE>the most proper and handsome of their respective societies, gallantly mounted on the best horses, and with the best furniture that the king's stable, and the stables of all the noblemen in the town, could afford;</QUOTE>  and all richly habited and attended by pages <pb id="p.390" n="390"> and lacqueys bearing torches. The next groupe which presented themselves, being the <num value="1">first</num> of the anti-masquers, offered a singular contrast to these shewy cavaliers. They consisted of cripples and beggars on horseback, mounted on the poorest and leanest jades that could be gotten, <QUOTE> and advanced to the music of keys and tongs, and other equally sounding instruments. After this beggarly train came </QUOTE>  men upon horseback, playing upon pipes, whistles, and instruments, sounding notes like those of birds of all sorts, and in excellent concert, <QUOTE> introductory to an anti-masque of birds, consisting </QUOTE> of an owl in an ivy bush, with many different sorts of birds in a cluster gazing upon her. <QUOTE> The <num value="3">third</num> anti-masque, which was of a very satirical character, is said to have been chiefly got up under the direction of Noy, the attorney-general, who wished to throw ridicule on the number of projectors of that day, and on the country which more particularly produced them. It was heralded by bagpipes and hornpipes, and other Scottish instruments of music. Foremost in this anti-masque rode </QUOTE> a fellow on a little horse with a great bit in his mouth, signifying a projector, who begged a patent, that none in the kingdom should ride their horses but with such bits as they should buy of him. <QUOTE> He was followed by another, with a bunch of carrots on his head and a capon upon his fist, who was described as a projector, who </QUOTE> wanted a monopoly for the invention of fattening capons with carrots. <QUOTE> Several other profound projectors were typified with equal significance. After these came <num value="6">six</num> musicians on horseback, habited as heathen priests, who prepared the way for a chariot full of gods and goddesses, attended by running footmen with torches in their hands. A similar band of musicians, and a <num value="2">second</num> chariot filled with pagan deities, followed. Then came the <num value="4">four</num> chariots of the grand masquers. These chariots were in the form of the triumphal cars of the Romans, and painted all over in brilliant colours, inlaid with silver. Each was drawn by <num value="4">four</num> horses, abreast, covered to the wheels with coloured and silver tissue, and with huge plumes of red and white feathers on their heads and cruppers. In each chariot sat <num value="4">four</num> grand masquers, chosen from the different inns of court, who were </QUOTE> handsome young gentlemen; their habits, doublets, trunk hose, and caps, were of the richest tissue, covered as thick with silver spangles as they could be placed; large white silk stockings up to their trunk hose, and very fine sprigs on their caps. On each side of the chariot were <num value="4">four</num> footmen in liveries of the colour of the chariot, carrying large flambeaux, which gave such a lustre to the paintings, and spangles, and habits, that hardly any thing could be invented to appear more glorious. <QUOTE> The number of spectators was immense, and the banquetting house was so crowded </QUOTE> with fine ladies, glittering with rich clothes and fairer jewels, and with lords and gentlemen of great quality, that there was scarce room for the king and queen to enter. <QUOTE> Their majesties, who stood at the window to see the masque come by, were </QUOTE> so delighted with the noble beauty of <pb id="p.391" n="391"> it, <QUOTE> that they sent to the marshal, to desire that the whole show might fetch a turn about the Tilt-yard, that they might see it a <num value="2">second</num> time. The masquers then alighted, and were conducted to several apartments prepared for their entertainment. The queen joined in the dance with some of the masquers; and the great ladies of the court were very free and civil in dancing with all of them. The revelry was kept up till it was almost morning, when their majesties having retired, the masquers and inns-of-court gentlemen were brought to a stately banquet; and after that was dispersed, every <num value="1">one</num> retired to their own quarters.</QUOTE>  
<p>The total expense of this magnificent pageant, which was borne by the societies and the individual members, was reckoned to be not less than <measure value="21000l." type=currency><num value="21000">21,000</num>l.</measure> Among the grave and learned personages who had a share in the devising and arranging of it, we observe, besides Whitelocke and Noy, the names of John Selden, sir Edward Herbert, Edward Hyde, sir John Finch, &amp;c. 
<p>Whitelocke says, the  <QUOTE>airs, lessons, and songs,</QUOTE>  for the masque,  <QUOTE>were composed by the celebrated Lawes; and the music was so performed, that it excelled any music that ever before that time had been held in England.</QUOTE>  The masque was also  <QUOTE>incomparably performed in the dancing, speeches, music, and scenes; none failed in their parts; and the scenes were most curious and costly.</QUOTE>  
<p>The queen was so delighted with the spectacle, that she expressed a wish to have it repeated; and a hint of this having been given to the lord mayor, he invited the king and queen, and the inns of court masquers to an entertainment in merchant-taylors' hall; and on this occasion, they came in procession into the city, in exactly the same order, and with equal splendour and applause as at Whitehall. 
<p>How different is the aspect of the inns of court at the present day, from that which they must have exhibited at the times of which we have been speaking. How quiet and still those squares and terraces where formerly mirth and revelry held their court! And yet no mark of desertion or desolation is there. The change is honourable to the age; and <num value="1">one</num> among many striking proofs of the advancement we have made in morals and refinement.

<p>On the spot now occupied by Southampton-buildings. on the south side of Holborn, there anciently stood a preceptory of knights templars, called the Old Temple.<NOTE>On pulling down certain houses, upwards of a century ago, some remains were discovered of this structure, which was of a circular form.</NOTE> In the reign of Henry II. when this order had so far emerged from that primitive state of poverty which was indicated by the emblem on their seal of <num value="2">two</num> men riding on <num value="1">one</num> horse, as to be worth some <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> manors; they purchased all that portion of ground on the banks of the Thames, extending from Whitefriars to Essex-street, and erected on it a <pb id="p.392" n="392"> large and magnificent edifice, which received the name of the New Temple. Here, from the spaciousness of its halls, parliaments and general councils were frequently held; and here, also, as a place of superior safety, the jewels of the crown were kept, and persons of wealth deposited their treasures. 
<p>On the suppression of the knights templars, in <datestruct value="1312--"><year reg="1312">1312</year></datestruct>, Edward II., in the <num value="6">6th</num> year of his reign, granted the Temple and its appurtenances to Aymer de Valence, earl of Pembroke; but <num value="2">two</num> years after he re-granted the premises to his uncle, Thomas, earl of Lancaster, on whose attainder they reverted to the crown. His portion of the Temple property was given for life to Hugh le Despenser, junior, who being attainted of treason, <num value="1">1st</num> Edward III. the place would have again been in the crown, but the decree of the Great Council of Vienne, in <datestruct value="1324--"><year reg="1324">1324</year></datestruct>, having made a general grant of the possessions of the Templars to the knights of St. John of Jerusalem, Edward III. was induced to present the Temple to that order; the prior and convent of which conveyed it to a society of lawyers, who emigrated here from Thaives Inn, for a rent of <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure> per annum. 
<p>On the dissolution of the order of the knights hospitallers, in the <num value="32">32</num>d of Henry VIII. the Temple reverted to the crown, but was still continued to be held on lease by the law professors till the time of James I., who, by his letters patent, dated at Westminster, on the <datestruct VALUE="-08-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></datestruct>, in his <num value="6">sixth</num> year, granted the whole, by the description of <QUOTE lang=la>Hospitalia et capitalia messuagia cognita per nomen de Inner Temple, sive novi Templi Lond.</QUOTE> &amp;c. to sir Julius Caesar, knt. and the treasurers, benchers, and others of this house, and their assigns, for ever,  <QUOTE>for the reception, lodging, and education of the professors and students of the laws of this realm,</QUOTE>  at the rent of <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>l.</measure> yearly from each society. 
<p>At the dissolution of the order of knights templars, that grant of their land which composed the Outer Temple, was bestowed on the canons regular of the church of the Holy Sepulchre, who disposed of them in <datestruct value="1324--"><year reg="1324">1324</year></datestruct>, to Walter bishop of Exeter, who erected thereon a stately edifice, as a city mansion for himself and his successors, which he called Exeter house. This being afterwards alienated, came to the noble families of Paget and Leicester, and at last to that of Essex. It being afterwards pulled down, Essex street was built on its site. 
<p>The societies of the Inner and Middle Temple consist each of a treasurer chosen annually, a senior order of barristers called benchers, barristers generally, students, and a variety of inferior officers. The chief executive authority is vested in the treasurer, who has the power of admitting or rejecting students, of accepting or refusing tenants for the chambers; of recovering and paying away all monies; and generally of doing every thing which is of instant necessity, in the direction of the society's affairs. All matters of higher concern, or of a legislative nature, are determined 
<pb id="p.393" n="393">
 in what are called parliaments of the society, which are usually held twice every term. Of old, no student could be called to the bar, before he had been examined as to his learning and abilities by the whole body of benchers, and had performed various grand and petty mootings; but now these ceremonies are dispensed with, and any student who has attended commons for a stated number of terms in the course of <num value="5">five</num> years, is entitled to demand a call to the bar. The benchers, however, still retain the power of refusing the call to any student, against whom they may conceive a prejudice, and in some instances are supposed to have exercised this right rather invidiously. At commons, there are <num value="3">three</num> degrees of tables, <num value="1">one</num> for the benchers, a <num value="2">second</num> for barristers, and a <num value="3">third</num> for students. Formerly they cut their meat on slices of bread, and drank out of wooden trenchers and green earthen jugs. 
<p>Members of these societies, though required to attend at commons, need not be resident; and many of those by whom the chambers are occupied are solicitors and private gentlemen, who. have no connection with either of the houses. 
<div2 type=section id="c.13.2"><HEAD>St. Mary's Church.</HEAD>
 
<p>The early history of this venerable fabric is enveloped in obscurity. Weever in his  <QUOTE>Funeral Monuments,</QUOTE>  on the credit, as he states,  <QUOTE>of British story,</QUOTE>  refers to a tradition of the Temple having been <num value="1">one</num> of those originally founded by Dunwallo Mulmutius, as a place of refuge and sanctuary for thieves and other offenders, about the year of the world <num value="4748">4748</num>; and Dunwallo himself, with other British kings, is reported to have been buried here. This, however, is only traditional; the authentic history of the church can be traced to as early a period as <datestruct value="1185--"><year reg="1185">1185</year></datestruct>, in which year it was dedicated in honour of the blessed Virgin, by Heraclius, patriarch of Jerusalem; who, at the above time, was entertained by the knights templars, whilst on a mission from pope Lucius III. to Henry II. in order to invite that monarch to ascend the throne of Jerusalem. 
<p>This edifice narrowly escaped destruction in the great fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>; in <datestruct value="1682--"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct> it was repaired and beautified, and a curious wainscot screen was set up. In <datestruct value="1695--"><year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>, the south western part, which had suffered by fire, was rebuilt. It has been since that time <pb id="p.394" n="394"> partially repaired in various parts; the last and most extensive was in the years <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg=1826>1826</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1827--"><year reg=1827>1827</year></datestruct>, under the direction of R. Smirke, esq. 
<p><FIGURE id="Fig.394"><HEAD>St. Mary's Church</HEAD></FIGURE>
<p>The plan of this church, as represented in the preceding page, exhibits <num value="2">two</num> distinct portions of buildings. The western most consists of the ancient circular church, formerly insulated, and constituting the only church of the extraordinary militant churchmen by whom it was created. The eastern portion is a long square, made in breadth into <num value="3">three</num> aisles by <num value="2">two</num> ranges of pillars, <num value="4">four</num> in each range. In the centre of the outer circular wall of the western pile of building is a magnificent receding semicircular arched doorway; the various mouldings springing from pillars with capitals approaching to the Corinthian order, the intervals between which are filled with mouldings of the zig-zag and lozenge varieties; near the jamb are small costumic statues, supposed to represent king Henry II. and his queen; the whole is in fine preservation and presents a magnificent specimen of Norman architecture; it owes its present state to the protection it receives from the porch of pointed architecture in front of it, which, although less ancient than the building, probably succeeded to an older porch. In the wall south of this porch are <num value="3">three</num> lofty roundheaded windows, the archivolt mouldings springing from columns attached to the jambs with elegant capitals; the easternmost has a freshness almost unequalled, owing to the circumstance of their being concealed for years by an attached chapel hid behind buildings in former times, and destroyed in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>. The piers between the windows are occupied by buttresses, and the elevation is finished with a block cornice and parapet; nearly the whole of this side had been built after a fire in <datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>, by sir Christopher Wren, in the Italian style; it has recently been restored under the directions of R. Smirke, esq. and a doorway with a Doric frontispiece walled up. An inscription on the parapet records these repairs as follows:--

<p>The northern side is nearly concealed by adjacent houses. The circular clerestory contains windows assimilating with the aisle, but of a subordinate character; like the lower portion, it has been partially restored, and a block cornice and parapet substituted for the former battlements. The chapel which stood on the south side was an addition to the original plan; it was a curious specimen of architecture, in <num value="2">two</num> stories, the lower in the same style as the circular church, the upper the lancet architecture of the portion now to be described. The eastern church is united to the other part 
<pb id="p.395" n="395">
 already particularized at the eastern portion; this has been restored, and its gables, <num value="1">one</num> of which rises above every; aisle are finished with crosses. In the north eastern angle is an attached octangular staircase turret. The south side has recently been restored in Bath stone; it is made into <num value="5">five</num> divisions by-well proportioned buttresses, each division containing a handsome triple lancet window, the central rising above the others; the archivolts are moulded and spring from columns attached to the jambs; the elevation finishes with a block cornice and parapet. The east front is in <num value="3">three</num> divisions, also made by buttresses, containing in like manner lancet windows; the ashlaring is modern, having been restored with Portland stone in <datestruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>; the points of the gables which correspond with the western front are crowned with urns; the north side, which abuts on a burying-ground, resembles the southern already described; it retains many of its original features; and has only been repaired in brick work. The annexed engraving shews a south west view of the church as repaired by Mr. Smirke in <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct><FIGURE id="Fig.395.2"><HEAD>St. Mary's Church</HEAD></FIGURE>. By the late alterations a passage has been formed from the west side--of the church to the court on the south side. The circular part of the church on the south side now appears in its original state. 
<p><FIGURE id="Fig.395.1"><HEAD>Interior of St. Mary's Church</HEAD></FIGURE>
<p>The interior displays <num value="1">one</num> of the most interesting specimens of architecture in the country; the circular church forms a vestibule to the other, and its area is unincumbered; in the centre is a peristyle of <num value="6">six</num> clusters of columns with leaved capitals, from which spring the same number of acutely pointed arches, forming a circular aisle; round the entire building, above the points of the arches, is a <num value="2">second</num> story, consisting of an arcade of small intersecting circular arches, with openings at intervals to the vault over the aisles; the upper or clerestory is composed of <num value="6">six</num> round headed windows, the archivolts resting on columns, from the inner column, of every main cluster rises a smaller column to the roof, sustaining on their capitals transom ribs, which severally unite in a common centre ornamented with a boss; the dado of the windows- in the aisles has a series of stalls above a continued seat; the arches are pointed and spring from columns with exceedingly curious capitals; on the spandrils of every arch a singular grotesque head. The entire of the ancient work has been wantonly destroyed at the last repair for the sake of restoring the same with modern stone work, although no pretence of decay in the old work existed as an excuse. On the south side was a door leading to the curious chapel destroyed at the last repair, and in the sill of <num value="1">one</num> of the windows on the same side, is a repetition of the same inscription as on the exterior. The roof of the aisle is strongly vaulted with stone and filled in with chalk; the ribs spring from the main cluster and from corresponding pillars attached to the side walls. Above the great doorway is a closed up circular window, and below it is a stone with the following modern copy in Saxon capitals of an ancient inscription discovered and destroyed in <datestruct value="1695--"><year reg="1695">1695</year></datestruct>:-- <pb id="p.396" n="396">

<p>The approach to the more modern portion of the church is worthy of attention; it is made by singularly formed pointed arches admirably accommodated to the junction of the circular with the square plan. The columns of the choir are clustered with uniform capitals, from which springs the stone vaulted roof, which is groined in the simplest manner with arches and cross springers; at the points of intersection are gilt bosses; the whole is a beautiful specimen of the lancet or Salisbury variety of pointed architecture. The aisles are not of equal width, the centre being wider than the others. The fittings up of the church are of dark brown oak in the usual style of Wren's decorations. The altar screen is unusually plain. The pulpit and desks are arranged in the middle of the centre aisle; the former is octangular, with a magnificentcarved sounding board, the latter is suspended from the ceiling. Both the pulpit and sounding board are enriched with the elaborate carving of Grinlin Gibbons. 
<p>The organ screen is elaborately carved of the Corinthian order; it was erected in <datestruct value="1682--"><year reg="1682">1682</year></datestruct>; on the entrance to the south aisle are the arms of the Inner Temple, and to that of the north those of the Middle Temple. The organ occupies the centre; it is considered <num value="1">one</num> of the finest instruments in England. In several of the windows are the ancient arms of England, viz. <hi rend=italics>gu.</hi> <num value="3">three</num> lions' passant guardant <hi rend=italics>or.</hi> on heater shields. 
<p>The body of the choir is paved like a parish church; the benchers and members of the <num value="2">two</num> inns of court have seats for themselves on their respective sides of the church. 
<p>A mean modern font stands in the circular aisle near the west door.

<p>The monuments are very numerous. The <num value="1">first</num>, in point of interest, are the splendid groups of sepulchral effigies which occupy the central portion of the area in the circular church; which are, in point of curiosity, almost identified with the building.

<p><FIGURE id="Fig.397"><HEAD>Sepulchral Effigies. Temple Church</HEAD></FIGURE> 
<p>These ancient sepulchral monuments lie in <num value="2">two</num> groups, within the circular area. They are generally reputed to represent knights templars. From the crowded manner in which these memorials of departed greatness are now arranged, there is little doubt of their having been removed from the places they originally occupied; most probably from tombs or pedestals which once stood here, but which at some remote period have been destroyed.  <QUOTE> This conjecture,</QUOTE>  says Mr. Brayley,  <QUOTE>is corroborated by the fact of an excavation having been made, during the repairs in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, under the northernmost group, for the purpose of discovering whether any vault or coffins were beneath, and it was then satisfactorily ascertained that there was neither <num value="1">one</num> nor the other.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Britton's Public Buildings of London, vol. i. p. <num value="139">139</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>These interesting effigies are <num value="9">nine</num> in number, and some are much mutilated and defaced. They are disposed in <num value="2">two</num> rows, between the north-eastern and south-eastern columns, and are inclosed within iron railings. The figures have been sculptured out of blocks of freestone, <num value="2">two</num> feet in thickness, and are lying on platforms of similar stone. The attitudes vary; but the figures are all recumbent, and represent knights, armed <hi rend=italics>cap-a-pie</hi>, in mail armour, with surcoats. <num value="1">One</num> only is bare-headed, and wears a monk's cowl.

<p>The principal figure<NOTE><BIBL>Fig. <num value="6">6</num>.</BIBL><FIGURE id="Fig.397.6"><HEAD>Sepulchral Effigy. Temple Church</HEAD></FIGURE></NOTE> in the southernmost group is said by Mr. 
<pb id="p.398" n="398">
 Gough to be that of Geoffrey de Magnaville, who was made earl of Essex by king Stephen; and, on his creation, augmented his family arms, which were quarterly or and <hi rend=italics>gules</hi>, with an escarbuncle, which charge is still apparent on the shield, and is the only instance of the bearing of arms on a sepulchral monument. This turbulent lord was killed in an attack which he made on the castle of Barnwell. As he died under sentence of excommunication, the templars did not dare to give him Christian burial, but wrapping his body in lead hung it on a crooked tree in the orchard of the Old Temple, London (in Holborn) the remains after the excommunication had been removed by absolution, found a resting place in the new church of the Temple, on the spot where it now lies, or near it. 
<p>The next effigy<NOTE><BIBL>Fig. <num value="7">7</num>.</BIBL><FIGURE id="Fig.397.7"><HEAD>Sepulchral Effigy.

<p>The next monument which claims attention is a pontifically habited figure, at the east end of the south aisle of the choir. 
<FIGURE id="Fig.398"><HEAD>Monument of a Bishop in the Temple Church.</HEAD></FIGURE>
 
<p>He is extended on an altar, with a crosier in his lift hand, and is living the benediction with his right hand.

Mr. Gough,<NOTE><BIBL>Sepul. Mon. i. <num value="221">221</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> with greater probability, conceives it to be the effigy of Sylvester de Everdon, bishop of Carlisle, and some time chancellor of England, who was undoubtedly buried in this edifice in <datestruct value="1255--"><year reg="1255">1255</year></datestruct>. At the repair in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, an entire skeleton was discovered beneath this effigy, within a leaden envelope, placed in a stone chest, or coffin, of about <num value="10">ten</num> feet in length and <num value="3">three</num> feet in height. Fragments of garments, and portions of a crosier were found, but no episcopal ring.

<p>The terrace before the Inner Temple hall is regularly and excellently paved: and, facing the south, is always dry. This advantage attracts many visitors, who pass their leisure hours in conversation there with their friends, and in admiring the trees, walks, flowers, and moving scenes of the river; but a more inviting and retired promenade is that of the Fountain Court, where a stream of water is forced to a considerable height, and falls again into a neat circular basin, surrounded by rails, and very beautiful trees, through which the antique walls and buttresses of the Middle Temple hall have an highly picturesque effect, whence the eye descends down a flight of steps to a handsome railing, enclosing a garden filled in the most pleasing manner by large groups of trees arranged near excellent gravel walks, bordered by flowers.<NOTE>It was in this garden, according to Shakspeare, that those unhappy badges of distinction, the white and red rose, originated.

<p>This hall is said to have been built in Edward III.&lsquo;s reign; the wall between the Thames and garden about the year <datestruct value="1550"><year reg="1550">1550</year></datestruct>; and the hall ceiled in <datestruct value="1554--"><year reg="1554">1554</year></datestruct>. About which time Mr. Packington, ZZZ SO FAR <pb id="p.401" n="401"> treasurer, built Tanfield court, so called from the chambers of sir Laurence Tanfield, chief baron, being there; till which time it was called Packington court. 
<p>It is very considerable in size; and has been altered, burnt, and rebuilt, from the days of Edward Ill. to the present. The front, facing the Thames, is of Portland stone, with <num value="3">three</num> buttresses, and a semi-sexagon turret. The roof supports a small cupola. The entrance is through a very large door, in a western wing, or projecting building, Over the entrance are <num value="3">three</num> shields of arms, viz. the royal arms of Richard I., Henry IV., and George IV. Above the whole is a clumsy quaterfoil, enclosing the arms of the Inner Temple. This edifice was repaired in <datestruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></datestruct>, as appears by inscriptions on the front. The inside is elegantly. decorated, and the paintings good. These are, the portraits of William III. Mary, judges Coke and Littleton; and the story of Pegasus, the performance of sir James Thornhill. 
<p>The library consists of upwards of <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> books and manuscripts. The parliament chamber is ornamented with portraits of George II. queen Caroline, lord Hunsdon, judge Twisden, Finch, earl of Nottingham, sir Martin Wright, lord chancellor Harcourt, &amp;c.

<p>In the year <datestruct value="1684"><year reg="1684">1684</year></datestruct> was built the Middle Temple gate, next Fleet-street, which is a fine structure, in the style of Inigo Jones. It has a graceful front of brick work, with <num value="4">four</num> large stone pilasters of the Ionic order, and a handsome pediment, with a round in the middle of it, having these words inscribed: <QUOTE lang=la>SURREXIT IMPENSIS SOCIETAT.

<div2 type=section id="c.13.4"><HEAD>Middle Temple Hall.</HEAD>
 
<p>This is a handsome insulated brick building, strengthened by buttresses, the quoins of stone, elevated upon vaults, and whose iconography is in the shape of a T. Between the buttresses are <num value="5">five</num> square-headed windows, each divided by <num value="3">three</num> mullions into <num value="4">four</num> lights, within a transom. The upper lights have arched heads. The wall is finished with a neat parapet embattled. The principal entrance is at the north-east corner, through a porch consisting of <num value="2">two</num> columns of the Ionic order, supporting a pediment, in which is the arms of the society. This leads through a handsome passage to the screen, the doors of which, elaborately ornamented with carvings, admit the professors to their hall or dining room. It is wainscotted as high as the bases of the windows; under which is an enriched Tuscan cornice, and <num value="4">four</num> ranges of pannels on each side, the greater number filled with the emblazoned arms of Readers in succession. 
<p>The screen consists of <num value="5">five</num> divisions in breadth, <num value="2">two</num> of which are the arched doors; the remainder are bounded by <num value="6">six</num> Tuscan pillars, whose intercolumniations contain each <num value="2">two</num> caryatide busts, and <num value="4">four</num> pannels. The entablature of these pillars has a strange intrusive enriched frieze on their capitals, exclusive of the usual members. The attic has <num value="6">six</num> pedestals, terminating in Ionic caryatide busts, which support a <num value="2">second</num> entablature. Between those are elegant little niches, with <num value="5">five</num> statues, separated by pannels. Over each niche are grotesque figures, assistant supporters of the upper entablature, with <num value="2">two</num> pierced arches between them and the caryatides. The whole of this laboured screen, and the numerous carvings, are of oak. Behind it, on the east wall, are several complete coats of mail, with lances, halberts, shields, and guns, arranged on their sides, and above them. In the centre, a pointed window of <num value="5">five</num> mullions contains the date of the building, <num value="150">150</num> ; and several coats of arms in painted glass, with which every window in the hall abounds, many indifferently, but the majority well executed. 
<p>The roof is most ingeniously contrived, and contains an amazing quantity of strong oak timber. Small pedestals, resting on stone brackets, inserted in the piers between the windows in the north and south walls, support segments of large circles, or ribs, that ascend to projecting beams from the great cornice above the windows; those are the bases of other small segments, which sustain <pb id="p.403" n="403"> beams of a <num value="2">second</num> cornice; and thus again to a <num value="3">third</num> row of segments, and a cornice; and from this the centre part of the roof is supported, on small pillars. The outline of each great rib, from the piers to the summit, is a pointed arch, divided into <num value="3">three</num> unequalled sized escallops; and these are connected, east and west, by arched ribs from every projecting beam to the next. A great number of small ribs and pillars are arranged under the whole ascent of the roof; but in a manner too complicated to be understood, unless examined. Every great rib is ornamented with <num value="3">three</num> pendants; and an aperture under the lantern admits sufficient light to render the parts distinct. It may with truth be asserted that London cannot produce another instance equally curious and singular. 
<p>The <num value="12">twelve</num> Caesars, and some other busts, are placed on the cornice of the wainscot; and the west wall supports a centre picture of Charles I. on a white horse, passing through an arch, attended by an equerry, who carries his helmet. The king is represented in armour; and the general excellence of the colouring and drawing is such as to render it almost certain that it is an original by Vandyke. This grand painting totally eclipses the adjoining portraits of Charles II. queen Anne, George <num value="1">1</num>. and George II. though they all possess some merit. 
<p>The finely executed south-bay window deserves attentive examination, as it is entirely filled with painted glass, most minutely executed, representing the arms of a great number of illustrious persons, surrounded by rich and beautiful ornaments. Merely to name those, and others distributed throughout the hall, would fill several pages.<NOTE>Many of them are engraved in <BIBL>Dugdale's Origines Juridiciales, <num value="223">223</num>-<num value="229">229</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The south part of the hall is built against by an erection of brick, in the carpenter's Gothic style. It is ornamented with buttresses; the quoins and dressings being of stone: the buttresses are finished by angular pinnacles with finials. Those at the angles are pierced and used as chimney pots. This building was erected in <datestruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></datestruct>, and is used as a library. It contains about <num value="8000">8,000</num> volumes, principally the bequest of sir Robert Ashley, <datestruct value="1641--"><year reg="1641">1641</year></datestruct>. A pair of globes, of the time of Elizabeth, and a portrait, supposed to be that of the above gentleman, are preserved in the library. 
<p>East of the last is a brick pile of buildings, with the date of <datestruct value="1625--"><year reg="1625">1625</year></datestruct>, and above the principal doorway is a neat slab, within foliage, on which is inscribed  <QUOTE> Library stayres.

<div2 type=section id="c.13.5"><HEAD>Lincoln's Inn.</HEAD>
 
<p>As an inn of court, Lincoln's Inn is next in rank to the Temple, which it equals in the number of eminent lawyers it has produced. Of these it may be sufficient to mention sir John Fortescue, <num value="1">one</num> of the fathers of English law, who held the great seal under Henry the <num value="6">sixth</num>; that virtuous chancellor, sir Thomas More; the learned antiquary, sir Henry Spelman; sir Matthew Hale; lord chancellor Egerton, &amp;c.; Prynne, the memorable victim of Star Chamber tyranny, who was also a member of this society. For an alleged libel in the <title>Histriomastix</title>, he was condemned by that infamous court, to pay a fine of <measure value="5000l." type=currency><num value="5000">5,000</num>l.</measure>, to lose his ears in the pillory, and to be imprisoned for life: nor did the odious verdict terminate here, for the chamber, assuming a jurisdiction co-equal with its vindictiveness, ordered Prynne to be expelled from the university of Oxford, and the society of Lincoln's Inn. 
<p>At what time students were <num value="1">first</num> admitted at Lincoln's Inn seems doubtful. Mr. Malcolm, on the authority of an heraldic MS. which terms Lincoln's Inn,  <QUOTE>an ancient ally unto the Middle Temple,</QUOTE>  says,  <QUOTE>there is no memory of any flourishing estate of the students and professors of the common law resident in this college till the reign of Henry VI., when it appears by rolls and remembrance of that house, the same then began to be famous.</QUOTE>  
<p>Lincoln's Inn is situated on the west side of Chancery-lane; a portion of its site was anciently occupied by the church and house of a body of preaching friars, who came to England in the year <datestruct value="1221"><year reg="1221">1221</year></datestruct>. These friars, who were <num value="13">thirteen</num> in number, and had for their prior, Gilbert de Fraxineto, met with much encouragement in England, Hubert de Burgh, earl of Kent, who died in <datestruct value="1252--"><year reg="1252">1252</year></datestruct>, and was buried in their church, left them his house in Westminster, which was nothing less than the ancient Whitehall, or York house. The friars sold it to the archbishop of York, who left it to his successor in the see. Hence it was called York house, or York place, until the year <datestruct value="1529"><year reg="1529">1529</year></datestruct>, when Henry VIII. took it from cardinal Wolsey, and gave it the name of Whitehall. In the year <datestruct value="1250"><year reg="1250">1250</year></datestruct>. the friars of this order had a grand convocation at their house, to the number of <num value="400">four hundred</num>; and having no possessions of their own, they entreated maintenance by alms. On the <num value="1">first</num> day of their meeting, Henry III. attended their chapter, and participated in a dinner which he had provided. Afterwards the queen did the same; and the royal example was followed by the bishops of London, the abbots of Westminster, St. Alban's, Waltham, and others. Here the friars preachers continued until the year <datestruct value="1276"><year reg="1276">1276</year></datestruct>, when Gregory Rokeslie, the mayor, and the barons of London, gave them a piece of ground near Baynard's-castle, and the ruins of Mountfichet, to build a new church, which was afterwards known by the name of Black-friars. The principal property of the old friar house belonged to William <pb id="p.405" n="405"> de Haverhall, who was treasurer to king Henry III.; but on his attainder for high treason, his mansion and lands devolved on that monarch, who gave a plot of ground to Ralph de Neville, lord chancellor, and bishop of Chichester, who built a large house, and lived in it, until his death, in <datestruct value="1244--"><year reg="1244">1244</year></datestruct>. It next became the residence of Richard de Wilts, and afterwards fell to Henry Lacy, earl of Lincoln, to whom Edward the <num value="1">first</num> presented the Old Friar house. The earl of Lincoln made it his residence, and hence it was called his inn, or Lincoln's Inn, according to the literal meaning of the word and the usage of the period, when an inn meant a lodging, or house in general. 
<p>This earl of Lincoln is said to have introduced students here in <datestruct value="1310--"><year reg="1310">1310</year></datestruct>; but as he died in that year, it is probable that students had been admitted before that period. 
<p>By some means, which none of our historians explain, the bishops of Chester again became the proprietors of Lincoln's Inn, and continued so until the beginning of the <num value="16">16th</num> century; when Robert Sherborn, bishop of that see, conveyed it to a student of the house, of the name of William Sulyard, or Syliard, for a term of <num value="99">99</num> years. This grant was confirmed in <datestruct value="1536--"><year reg="1536">1536</year></datestruct>, by a subsequent bishop of Chester, in a deed which conveyed the house and lands to the said William Sulyard and his brother Eustace. In <datestruct value="1579--"><year reg="1579">1579</year></datestruct>, the surviving son of Eustace conveyed the whole to Richard Kingsmill and the rest of the benchers, for the sum of <measure value="520l." type=currency><num value="520">520</num>l.</measure> 
<p>Lincoln's Inn forms a great quadrangle, composed of the gatehouse, the hall on the west side, the chapel on the north, and several chambers on the south. 
<p>The principal gate just mentioned, is flanked by <num value="2">two</num> square projections, or towers; but, as almost all the windows have been modernized, the venerable character of the structure is greatly injured. Over the gateway are <num value="3">three</num> shields of arms in square compartments, The <num value="1">first</num> are the arms of Lacy, earl of Lincoln, the middle the royal arms, and the <num value="3">third</num> the arms of sir Thomas Lovell, knt. the builder of the gate.

This piece of sculpture was repaired and re-gilt in <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>. The hall, as seen through the arch from Chancery-lane, has the appearance of a monastic building, occasioned by the buttresses and pointed windows. It was erected in the reign of Henry VII. and is <num value="62">sixty-two</num> feet in length, and <num value="32">thirty-two</num> in breadth. 
<p>The side walls are divided by buttresses into <num value="5">five</num> divisions, occupied by windows, with obtusely arched heads, and divided by <num value="3">three</num> millions; at each extremity of both sides are oriels; this hall being singular in possessing <num value="4">four</num> of such appendages; over <num value="1">one</num> of the west windows is a shield held by an angel. On the roof is a modern lantern. The interior is much modernized; it is covered with a modern coved ceiling of plaster; the oriels have internally obtuse arches, the mouldings resting on angels. At the north or upper end is a canopy over the lord chancellor's seat, <pb id="p.406" n="406"> and at the opposite end a screen and music gallery; it is curiously carved and reaches to the present ceiling; it is made in height into <num value="2">two</num> stories, the lower divided into compartments by termini with human heads; the upper story has terminal columns; the whole is surmounted by a pannel containing a dial, and decorated with Ionic pilasters: there are <num value="2">two</num> entrances in the lower story, the former openings to the gallery are now filled with paintings of the following shields of arms and inscriptions :--<num value="1">1</num>.

The screen is painted of a light wainscot colour, and groined.

This hall is now, by permission of the benchers; used for the sittings of the lord high chancellor. 
<p>The chapel is situated north of the hall, and is elevated on an open crypt of <num value="3">three</num> arches, separated by buttresses of <num value="6">six</num> gradations, with large windows filled by painted glass. The arches of the cloisters are richly covered by tracery, quaterfoils, and geometrical figures, in the manner of Henry the VIIth&lsquo;s chapel; and are correct imitations of our ancient florid style. 
<p>The chapel was designed by Inigo Jones; but, unfortunately, this celebrated architect was incapable of producing a complete specimen of faithful imitation: a flash of genius now and then appears, but it has a disproportion or a deformity to counterbalance the effect. Mountain, bishop of London, consecrated this chapel on the feast of the Ascension, in <datestruct value="1623--"><year reg="1623">1623</year></datestruct>. The windows abound with multitudes of emblazoned arms, in painted glass, of noblemen and treasurers, to the present period, mingled with fine figures of the prophets and apostles. In <datestruct value="1791--"><year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>, the chapel underwent considerable repairs, under the superintendance of the late J. Wyatt, esq., when it received a new roof and a window at the west end. 
<p>Henry Colfer, esq. in <datestruct value="1658--"><year reg="1658">1658</year></datestruct>, founded a sermon, preached in this chapel on the <num value="1">first</num> Wednesday of every month. The preacher receives <measure value="12l." type=currency><num value="12">twelve</num> pounds</measure> per annum; and he left <measure value="8l." type=currency><num value="8">eight</num> pounds</measure> for charitable purposes. 
<p>Dr. Warburton, bishop of Gloucester, who was preacher to the society, founded a lecture in <datestruct value="1768--"><year reg="1768">1768</year></datestruct>, to be pronounced on the <num value="1">first</num> Sunday after Michaelmas term, and the <num value="1">first</num> before and after Hilary term, annually, for proving the truth of the Christian religion from the completion of the prophecies in the Old and New Testament. <pb id="p.407" n="407"> 
<p>The Society appoint a preacher and chaplain; and divine service is celebrated on Sundays and holydays. 
<p>The ground under the cloisters was the burial-place of the society; but, since <datestruct value="1791--"><year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>, it has been reserved for the benchers only. Few men of much eminence have been buried in this chapel; but a plain stone in the cloisters under the chapel is inscribed  <QUOTE>Here lies the body of John Thurloe, secretary of state to the protector Oliver Cromwell, and a member of this society.</QUOTE>  
<p>Stone-buildings, so termed because they are composed of that material, are situate parallel with the west side of Chancery-lane; their east front, and the east side of the <num value="6">Six</num> Clerks and Registrar's office, whose principal front is in Chancery-lane, formed an oblong court. But those buildings are only part of a vast range, projected by the society, and designed by sir Robert Taylor. The garden front consists at present of a rustic basement, with arcades and windows, at the north end of which is a wing, consisting of <num value="6">six</num> Corinthian pillars, which support an entablature and pediment. The cornice of the wing is continued through the whole length of the front, which terminates in a ballustrade; but the <num value="2">two</num> ranges of windows are entirely plain. It will be perceived from this that the facade is not of the most superb description; but when viewed through the foliage of the garden, and the long line thus broken by the intervention of trees, it has a very pleasing effect, particularly from Serle's-court.

<p>The site of Serle's-court, or New-square, was originally called Fichett's-field, or Little Lincoln's-inn-field. It appeared that Henry Serle and a person named Clerk, had some claims, which were settled by an agreement, dated in the <num value="34">thirty-fourth</num> year of Charles II. between them and the benchers of the society. That fixing the specific property of the parties, Mr. Serle was permitted to build on the field. The chambers in this square are freehold, but subject to certain restrictions inserted in the agreement between the benchers and Serle. The whole of the chambers within the jurisdiction of the society entitle the holders to a vote for members of parliament for Middlesex and Westminster.

<div2 type=section id="c.13.6"><HEAD>Gray's Inn.</HEAD>
 
<p>The name of this inn of court is derived from the noble family of the Gray's, who in the reign of Edward III. conveyed the ground on which it has been erected, and which formed part of the manor of Portpool (ignobly commemorated in Portpool-lane), to a society of students at law. The domain of this society extends over a large extent of ground between Holborn and Theobald's road; it has a spacious square, and still more spacious garden, well laid out, and shaded with lofty trees; but the approaches on all sides are exceedingly mean, and the buildings, if we except <num value="2">two</num> new piles called Verulam and Raymond-buildings, are of a very ordinary description. 
<p>The chapel and hall stand between Holborn-court and that part of the square extending towards Gray's Inn-lane, and at the southeast corner. The chapel is totally destitute of every species of ornament; and is indeed so entirely plain, that <num value="1">one</num> of the best writers on the subject of the metropolis justly observes, that a description of it will be accomplished in saying, it has <num value="4">four</num> walls, and several windows, large and small. <pb id="p.409" n="409"> 
<p>The hall is a brick building, in that style of architecture which prevailed from the time of Henry VIII. to that of James I. The exterior is built of red brick, and the side walls are divided by buttresses; in the intervals are windows of the usual domestic style of the period when it was built; the gables are marked by a graduated battlement curiously worked in brick. Over the centre of the roof was, until <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct>, the original lantern, which had a picturesque and antique appearance; it was then replaced by the present carpenter's Gothic erection, and at the same time the walls were covered with Roman cement, slates substituted for the tiles on the roof, and the whole entirely modernized. A new south porch was at the same time constructed. The interior retains its pristine features, and is a very interesting specimen of the architecture of the day; the roof of oak is sustained on noble arched beams, <num value="7">seven</num> in number, handsomely carved, and in a fine state of preservation. At the west end is a curious and highly carved screen and music gallery of dark oak, displaying <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest specimens of Italian architecture in the country; it is made by Ionic columns into <num value="4">four</num> divisions, occupied by arches, the frieze and shafts of the columns covered with fillagree; in the spandrils of the arches are angels with palm branches and chaplets; <num value="2">two</num> of the arches are filled in with a shell-framed ornament, the others are glazed. The whole is surmounted by a ballustrade, enriched with termini. The lantern is situated between the <num value="4">fourth</num> and <num value="5">fifth</num> beams from the west, and beneath it a modern stone occupies the ancient situation. The oriel is situated on the north side; it is entirely filled with coats of arms in stained glass. In the eastern window are <num value="23">twenty-three</num> coats of arms.<NOTE><BIBL>Vide Sir W. Dugdale's Origines Juridiciales</BIBL>, for a description of them.</NOTE> The west window is occupied by shields of arms, in stained glass of modern workmanship. In <num value="1">one</num> of the windows on the south side is a sun dial, on painted glass, with the arms of the inn, and the following inscription:

<p>Against the east wall below the window, are the following paintings: Charles I. between Charles II. and James II. whole lengths; against the north wall is a painting of the great lord Bacon, between <num value="2">two</num> other portraits of judges. On the south wall is another portrait. 
<p>The library is exceedingly well supplied with books for the use of the students.

<p>The ARMS of GRAY&lsquo;S INN are, <hi rend=italics>Sa.</hi> a griffin sergeant or. 
<div2 type=section id="c.13.7"><HEAD>Sergeants' Inn.</HEAD>
 
<p>According to Sir Edward Coke, the order of sergeants at law is <pb id="p.410" n="410"> upwards of <num value="1100">eleven hundred</num> years standing. We find mention made of them in a statute of the <num value="3">3</num>d Edward I. In the reign of Henry VIII. they were so numerous that <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> of them received at <num value="1">one</num> time the honour of knighthood; and yet, in the following reign, the number had been so much diminished, by various casualties. that sergeant Benlowes described himself <foreign lang=la>solus serviens ad legem.</foreign>
The degree of sergeant is the highest taken at the common law, as that of doctor is of the civil law. The call to it is by royal mandate, issued on the recommendation of the judges. The Court of Common Pleas is their peculiar sphere of practice; but they may and do plead in any of the courts. The judges are always selected from this body, the members of which they continue to distinguish by the friendly appellation of <hi rend=italics>brothers.</hi>
When a barrister is raised to the rank of a sergeant, he is sworn at the Chancery bar, to  <QUOTE>well and truly serve the king's people; truly to counsel them after their cunning; not to defer or delay their causes willingly, for covet of money or other thing that may turn to their profit; and to give due attendance accordingly.</QUOTE>  
<p>It was in ancient times customary for the whole body of sergeants to proceed on the day following the swearing in of a brother, in public procession to Westminster-hall, in order to present him to the judges of the different courts. And having had their coifs of white linen or silk put on without any black ones over, and being clothed in robes of <num value="2">two</num> colours, they walked to Westminster-hall, accompanied by a great number of gentlemen of the long robe, of several houses of court and chancery, the warden of the Fleet, Marshal, &amp;c.; and attended by clerks, <num value="2">two</num> of each sergeants, immediately following him, &amp;c.; also, by the stewards, butlers, and other servants to the houses, all bare-headed and clothed in short party-coloured vestments. On the appearance of the new sergeant the judges were wont to exclaim,  <QUOTE>Methinks I see a brother.</QUOTE>  The brother presented a ring, with his motto engraven on it, to each of their lordships, in token of his union to the fraternity. All the others serjeants had also rings given to them. When this ceremony was finished, the brotherhood returned sometimes to Ely House, at others to the Middle Temple Hall, where a grand feast was given on the occasion, to which the most distinguished personages in the state were invited. From the description of an entertainment of this sort, given in <datestruct value="1531--"><year reg="1531">1531</year></datestruct>, at Ely House, they appear to have been at times of extraordinary magnificence.<NOTE><BIBL>Vide ante vol . i. p. <num value="215">215</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> The feasting on this occasion, continued from Friday, the <datestruct VALUE="-11-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, till the following Tuesday.  <QUOTE>On Monday, king Henry and queen Catherine of Arragon dined there in separate chambers, and the foreign ambassadors occupied a <num value="3">third</num> apartment. In the great hall, sir Nicholas Lombard, mayor of London, the judges barons of the Exchequer, and the aldermen, presided at the king's table. On the south side sat the master of the rolls, the masters <pb id="p.411" n="411"> in Chancery, and worshipful citizens. The north side of the hall was occupied by aldermen appointed to sit at the head, the rest filled by respectable merchants. In the cloisters, chapel, and gallery, were placed knights and gentlemen of lesser degree. The crafts of London were in other halls; whilst the sergeants and their ladies were in chambers appointed for their reception. The quantity of provision, on the occasion, resembled that for a coronation feast.</QUOTE>  
<p>The presentation of the rings, and perhaps a private merrymaking, among the fraternity themselves, are now the only relics of these showy and expensive customs. 
<p>Sergeant's Inn, situated at the bottom of Chancery-lane, consists of <num value="2">two</num> courts, of rather mean appearance. As formerly observed, it was anciently called Faryingdon's Inn, after the same person who gave name to the ward, in which it is situated. The hall is neat and commodious; and its windows are filled with the armorial bearings of various members of the fraternity. It has several portraits, and on the front is the date of erection, <datestruct value="1678--"><year reg="1678">1678</year></datestruct>.

<p>This appears to have been, from an early period, <num value="1">one</num> of the most eminent of the minor schools of law, or inns of Chancery. There are traces of its existence as far back as <datestruct value="1478--"><year reg="1478">1478</year></datestruct>. It is supposed to have derived its name from a spring of water in the vicinity, called St. Clement's well, now covered with a pump, which had of old the reputation of curing a variety of disorders, and was much resorted to by the credulous. The society of this inn is governed by a principal and <num value="14">fourteen</num> ancients. The hall is built of red brick, and is situated on the south side of the principal court.

The interior is ornamented with a good portrait of sir Matthew Hale and several others, names not known. In the centre of the <pb id="p.412" n="412"> garden there is a statue of a naked Moor, supporting a sun-dial which was presented to the society by Holles, lord Clare, from whose family they derive their title to the inn and its appurtenances.

<p>The lords of Furnival, who make so conspicuous a figure in our military history, from the warlike days of Richard Coeur de Lion to those of the Black Prince, possessed on the north side of Holborn, near Gray's Inn-lane, a splendid city residence, which went by the family name. In the reign of Richard II. the family became extinct in the male line, and Furnival's Inn fell by marriage into the possession of the earls of Shrewsbury, with whom it remained till the reign of Edward VI.

<p>The Charter-house, which is situated on the north side of the square to which it gives name, occupies the seat of an ancient monastery for Carthusian monks, called <hi rend=italics>Le Chartreux.</hi> It was part of the estate of the hospital of St. John of Jerusalem. Sir Walter de Manny, of Hainault, <num value="1">one</num> of those gallant knights who served in the wars of Edward III., and <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1">first</num> that was honoured with the order of the garter, and Michael de Northburgh, bishop of London, built and endowed the priory for <num value="24">twenty-four</num> monks, in the year <datestruct value="1361"><year reg="1361">1361</year></datestruct>. Sir Walter appointed John Lustate, the <num value="1">first</num> prior, and, according to the custom of the times, ordered masses for the welfare of the king, of himself, his wife, the bishop of London, the soul of Alice de Hainault, that of Michael de Northburgh, and for the souls of those buried under and about the monastery. 
<p>Edward III. licensed the convent, and pope Urban VI. confirmed the same by a bull. Richard I. bestowed on the prior and convent <measure value="50bmark" type=currency><num value="50">fifty</num> marks</measure> of silver per annum. 
<p>The great epoch in the history of all religious establishments in this country, happened immediately before their fall. The denial of the Pope's supremacy by Henry VIII. was <num value="1">one</num> of the few rational acts of that violent monarch, and nothing could be more impolitic than the resistance of the religious orders. However, the king's punishments were ready for the rebellious, as we shall soon perceive; the prior Howghton and proctor Middlemore visited the Tower in consequence of their refusing to swear to the renunciation. After enduring confinement a short time, they submitted. 
<p>Many of the monks seem to have made the question a matter of conscience; and really appear to have earnestly debated it, without reflecting on whom they had to depend for mercy. Several communications by letters passed between the monks of the Chartreuse and those of Sion upon the subject, some of which are still preserved in the Museum. Father Fewterer, confessor general to the latter, had conformed, and most zealously endeavoured to persuade the monks of the former to follow his example: he gives the benediction of  <QUOTE>the grace and peace of Jesus Christ;</QUOTE>  and adds, that his brethren and himself sympathise with them in their troubles, and  <QUOTE>praying you of charitie to charitably receyve th&lsquo;aim, and applye yorselfs with charitie to charitably folowe that is charitably meant.</QUOTE>  The temporizing confessor  <QUOTE>founde by the worde and wylle of God, both in the Old and Newe Testament, great trewethes for or prince; and for the bishop of Rome nothing at all.</QUOTE>  He mentions several authors who had written for the supremacy; and concludes,  <QUOTE>so ye shall wel lerne that it graveth not of lawe and <pb id="p.415" n="415"> scripture, nor yete of no antique counsaill received as a counsaill.

Conscience then,  <QUOTE>that doth make cowards of us all,</QUOTE>  prompted him to leave them, and advise them to submit to the king. 
<p>As a prelude, <num value="3">three</num> most wise, learned, and discreet men, were placed within the convent, under the name of governors. On taking possession, they assembled the officers, monks, and servants, before them, and were graciously pleased to say that their most excellent prince had in his mercy and compassion pardoned all their heresies and treasons committed previous to that day, and that they were at liberty to purchase this emanation of pity under the great seal. At the same time they added, that death would follow new offences. 
<p>The keys of the convent were demanded from the proctor, and other officers, and they were informed that all receipts and payments must in future pass through the hands of the governors, for which they were accountable to the king only. Those men had besides an inquisitorial power, enabling them to examine into the opinions of the monks separately. At those private conferences, they were offered dispensations for breaking their vows and leaving their order, and inconsiderable stipends for a year or <num value="2">two</num>, till they could find employment, when they would be expected to preach the word of God, and strictly conform to his ordinances. 
<p>The unhappy wretched priests were condemned to the cloisters for some time, during which no person dared speak to them without a licence from the governors. Their books were taken from them, and their sermons critically examined. 
<p>The catastrophe of this drama was now drawing near.

<p>Since Pardon churchyard and the neighbouring lands have been in the hands of the governors of the present hospital, it has been leased to various persons, amongst others to baron Sotherton, sir Edward Verney, knight marshal, &amp;c. &amp;c.

And Charter-house church-yard (now the square) had a chapel near the centre of the area, which the prior and brethren used for expiatory masses. The original building was of stone, and had not been removed before <datestruct value="1561--"><year reg="1561">1561</year></datestruct>, when lord North conveyed it to Thomas Cotton, schoolmaster,  <QUOTE>for the good desyre and affection he beareth towards the vertuous educacion and bringing up of yowthe in learning;</QUOTE>  in this deed it is described as a brick building, roofed with tiles; a door at the west end, and another on the south side; separated within by a wainscoat partition into a choir and nave; with <num value="3">three</num> pews on the north and <num value="2">two</num> on the south side of the former, and <num value="2">two</num> pews and <num value="12">twelve</num> seats in the latter.

<p>Pardon church-yard must have been purchased after the dissolution of religious houses by sir Edward North, as it certainly belonged to the order of St. John of Jerusalem, so lately as <datestruct value="1522--"><year reg="1522">1522</year></datestruct>. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="1565-05-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1565">1565</year></datestruct>, the Chartreuse was purchased of Roger lord North, and his father's executors, by the duke of Norfolk, for <measure value="2500l." type=currency><num value="2500">2,500</num>l.</measure>; and in the same year he issued letters of attorney to John Blenhayset, esq. and William Dunham, goldsmith, to take possession. To this nobleman is to be attributed the present state of the <pb id="p.418" n="418"> buildings, with some exceptions. The wall in Charter-house-square bears many marks of antiquity, and was probably part of the monastery, though now so totally mutilated, and incorporated into the master's and other apartments, that their original form is quite lost. Upon passing the gate into the <num value="1">first</num> court, the ragged stones of the ruins are found to have been used in building a long gallery, whose windows are of the fashion used in the duke's days; in the midst is an arch (over which are Mr. Sutton's arms and the dale of <datestruct value="1611--"><year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct>,) leading to another court formed on the east side of the hall. A small portico before the door has the royal arms on it; to the right a buttress and <num value="2">two</num> large windows with lancet-shaped mullions; over them <num value="2">two</num> small arched windows, and above the door <num value="1">one</num> with <num value="9">nine</num> divisions. At the south end a very large projecting window divided into <num value="15">fifteen</num> parts, and over it a small <num value="1">one</num>. The roof is slated, and supports a small cupola. The north and south sides of the area are of brick, erected about the middle of the last century. <num value="2">Two</num> small passages lead to courts on either side; that on the south contains the entrance to the chapel, and much of the walls are of ancient stone. The north court seems to have been erected, or altered about the same time. Near it are the kitchen and the bake-house; the former contains <num value="2">two</num> enormous chimney-places, and the doors and windows have all pointed arches. Facing the chapel is a passage to, the cloister, which is of brick, with projecting mullioned windows, and flat tops. A few small pointed doors were in the backwall, but they are now closed. From a terrace on the cloister the patched ancient walls and buttresses of the original court-room may be seen. I have now mentioned all the external marks which seem to fix the above buildings to the times previous to Mr. Sutton's purchase. It is impossible to trace them from the sites of the various monastic buildings. It will be found from the description of the interior, that the duke of Norfolk had expended large sums in adorning his house, which his inordinate ambition prevented him from enjoying. Whether he had any view towards his alliance with Mary queen of Scots, in thus decorating it, I know not, but be that as it may,  <QUOTE>when Mary once perceived the artifices of Elizabeth to detain her in prison, she thought herself warranted to make attempts of every kind to procure herself liberty. A multitude of conspiracies were formed for her, to some of which she consented, and particularly to that for marrying the duke of Norfolk against the will of queen Elizabeth, though Bothwell was still alive; it cost that duke his life for pursuing his chimerical project with too much zeal.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Acta Regia, fol. <datestruct value="1733--"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>, p. <num value="457">457</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> He was committed to the Tower in <datestruct value="1569--"><year reg="1569">1569</year></datestruct>, and in the following year was permitted to reside at the Chartreuse, guarded by sir Henry Nevil, but, recurring to this unhappy pursuit, he was again taken into custody, and brought to trial, in consequence of which he lost his head on the scaffold. The estates of this nobleman having thus fallen to the crown, <pb id="p.419" n="419"> queen Elizabeth shewed much magnanimity in restoring them to the family, who were caressed by James I. for the sufferings they had endured for his mother queen Mary. The <num value="1">first</num> <num value="4">four</num> days of his residence in London was with the Howards at the Chartreuse. Lord Thomas Howard, the duke's <num value="2">second</num> son, was created earl of Suffolk by the king, lord chamberlain of his household, lord treasurer of England, and knight of the most noble order of the garter. 
<p>On the <datestruct VALUE="-05-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, in the <num value="9">ninth</num> year of king James I.

When the invasion of England was threatened by the Spanish armada, Mr. Sutton knew that the queen had no fleet capable of opposing it; he also knew that the Spanish fleet could not but set sail, but through the means of aid from the bank of Genoa, he, therefore, purchased all the bills he could, in every commercial town of Europe, and discounting them at that bank, drained it so much of its specie, that it was <num value="12">twelve</num> months before it could give the necessary assistance to Spain, and, by this time, England was prepared for the contest. He afterwards commanded a barge, that bore his name and contributed to the destruction of that very armada, the invasion by which he had so happily averted <num value="12">twelve</num> months before. Mr. Sutton now commenced merchant, and acquired a splendid fortune, which he devoted to works of charity, and among the most striking, was the foundation of the Charter-house, at an expense of <measure value="20000l." type=currency><num value="20000">20,000</num>l.</measure>, independent of an endowment of <measure value="4493l. 19s. 10d." type=Currency><num value="4493">4,493</num>l. <num value="19">19</num>s. <num value="10">10</num>d.</measure> per annum.

The benevolent intentions of the founder were followed by the governors, who, in <datestruct value="1613--"><year reg="1613">1613</year></datestruct>, made an order, that no <num value="1">one</num> should be admitted into the hospital, but only  <QUOTE>such poor persons as can bring good testimony of their good behaviour,</QUOTE>  and  <QUOTE>no children whose parents have any estate in lands to leave unto them, but only the children of poor men that want means to bring them up.</QUOTE>  
<p>The hospital was endangered during the civil wars; but as soon as Cromwell gained the ascendancy, he was elected governor, and attended several of the meetings; and, since that period, no event has occurred to injure this extensive charity. The number of scholars educated in the hospital is <num value="73">seventy-three</num>, of whom <num value="44">forty-four</num> are on the foundation, and <num value="29">twenty-nine</num> students at the universities, with an allowance of <num value="20">20</num>l; per annum for <num value="8">eight</num> years.

<p>The Charter-house, though a venerable pile, has few vestiges of the ancient conventual building. 
<p>The entrance is through a venerable pointed arch on the north side of Charter-house square. It consists of several courts, some of which exhibit the remains of the monastic buildings to great advantage. The principal object is 
<div2 type=section id="c.14.1"><HEAD>The Chapel.</HEAD>
 
<p>Little can be seen of the exterior of this edifice, except the north side, which is supported by several buttresses, and its antique appearance totally destroyed by a covering of compo. The interior, though small and confined, is neatly fitted up. The altar table, which is situated at the east end, is elevated on <num value="1">one</num> step; over it are plain gilt pannels, containing the  <QUOTE>Commandments,</QUOTE>   <QUOTE> Creed,</QUOTE>  and  <QUOTE>Lord's Prayer,</QUOTE>  with the emblem of the Trinity in a glory and a circular pediment inscribed from the <num value="22">22nd</num> chapter of St. Matthew. A window, with a flat arch, and <num value="5">five</num> lancet-shaped divisions, nearly fills the space between the altar and ceiling. A plain pulpit and reading desk stand against the south wall, in which are <num value="2">two</num> windows, with <num value="3">three</num> bays each, containing the arms of Mr. Sutton. 
<p><num value="4">Four</num> massy Tuscan pillars divide the chapel into <num value="2">two</num> aisles. The key stones are Mr. Sutton's arms. The brackets and decorations of the arches are clumsy and inelegant. 
<p>At the west end is a small, plain organ, on a very rich gallery, if a crowd of unmeaning ornaments can make it so-helmets, armour, flags, drums, guns, masks, cherubim, coats of arms, heads, harps, guitars, and composite capitals without shafts, on a kind of termini. Such were the heterogeneous assemblages admired in the days of James the <num value="1">First</num>. 
<p>The entrance porch has a fine groined roof with bosses representing cherubims supporting shields, on which are sculptured the emblems of the Saviour's passion. In <num value="1">one</num> part is a date <datestruct value="1512"><year reg="1512">1512</year></datestruct>. 
<p>There is a strong plain gallery at the west end of the north aisle, and the ceiling is quite flat.<NOTE><BIBL>Malcolm.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>There are several monuments in this chapel; that of the founder is as injudiciously placed as it possibly can be; close in the northeast corner, between a window and the dark east wall. Not a ray of light falls on it; and when the spectator wishes to view it, he must risk his shins against the benches for the poor scholars immediately before it; while his eyes are dazzled by the window, to the utter confusion of his vision. It is a subject of regret, that so <pb id="p.421" n="421"> noble a tomb should be thus lost in darkness and obscurity. The effigy is in a black gown and ruff, with grey hair and beard, under a most superb composite canopy, with figures of Faith, Hope, &amp;c. The bas relief above the cornice has great merit in the easy disposition of upwards of <num value="50">fifty</num> whole-length figures, seated and standing around a preacher. Over the whole are the arms of the deceased, surmounted by a small pedestal, on which is a statue of Charity. The tomb is described:-- 
<p> <QUOTE>Here lieth buried the body of Thomas Sutton, late of Castle Camps, in the county of Cambridge, esq. at whose only costs and charges this hospital was founded and endowed with large possessions for the relief of poor men and children; he was a gentleman, born at Knaith, in the county of Lincoln; of worthyand honest parentage.

<p>Against the east wall of the north aisle is an elegant marble monument with a basso-relievo, nearly the- size of life, of a judge in his official robes sitting in an easy attitude, his right hand with a pen resting on a table. Beneath is the following inscription:-- 
<p>In the founder's vault are deposited the remains of Edward Law, lord Ellenborough, son of Edmund Law, lord bishop of Carlisle, chief justice of the court of King's-bench, from <datestruct VALUE="1802-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, to <datestruct VALUE="1818-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1818">1818</year></datestruct>, and a governor of the Charter-house.

<p>Adjoining is an elegant tablet with a neat basso-relievo profile of the deceased. On the east side of the tablet are <num value="2">two</num> caryatidal figures of great elegance. It was sculptured by Flaxman. It is to the memory of the Rev. Matthew Raine, S. T. P.

<p>On the north side of the building without, is a door leading to a well staircase, that by giddy turns introduces us to the room now used to keep the archives of the hospital; the ceiling is beautifully ribbed; and the centre stone represents a large rose inclosing I. H. S. or <foreign lang=la>Jesus hominum Salvator.</foreign> This room is guarded from every accident by depredation, fire, or damps, and the records are placed in the greatest regularity and order. Access cannot be had to this place without the presence of the master, the registrar, and the receiver, neither of which can enter it without the others. 
<p>The other traces of the convent that may be ascertained with certainty, are the entrances to several cells on the south side of the play-ground; facing the present cloister a steep bank has been made against the wall, which hides all but the very tops of <num value="2">two</num> rather depressed arched doors under flat mouldings, with shields in the angles. I am told there were inscriptions to these cells, but they are totally obliterated. Houses have been erected against the outside of the wall; and consequently we are deprived of all knowledge of their depth and width. 
<p>There may he pieces of walls incorporated into the present buildings, and I suspect that some parts near the kitchen are original: the basement of the west end of the school is evidently so. Sir Edward North, the duke of Norfolk, and probably others of its possessors soon after the dissolution, have used the ancient stone in every direction, and in such a manner as to deceive, did we not judge from the style of the windows, which are generally of Henry's, Edward's, and Elizabeth's time. 
<p>On passing through a door at the north end of the piazza, we arrive at the feet of an enormous stair-case, adorned with a vast variety of minute ornaments carved on every part capable of receiving carving. Those decorations, with pointed doors, and mullioned windows, shew it to be of the duke of Norfolk's time. These stairs lead on the right to the governors' present room, the master's apartments, and to those of Mr. Barbor, the receiver: and to the left, through a gallery, to the terrace over the cloister which has a <pb id="p.423" n="423"> handsome pavilion in the centre, that affords a most pleasing summer view of the trees and gardens on either side. 
<p>A door opens from the gallery to a library, presented, in some measure, by Daniel Wray, esq. deputy teller of the exchequer. This gentleman died in <datestruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>, at the advanced age of <num value="82">82</num>, and left his books to be disposed of by his widow; who knowing his attachment to the Charter-house, where he had received his education, made the governors an offer of them; which was thankfully accepted. This room was taken for their reception, from the ancient apartment originally used for the governors' meetings. Though very large, <num value="3">three</num> sides are nearly filled by this very good collection of many ancient editions of various learned works, enlivened by many of our valuable authors. 
<p>They are placed (I believe by Mrs. Wray's desire), under the care of the master, preacher, head school-master, and a librarian, whose salary is <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">20</num>l.</measure> per ann. The original catalogue was written by T. Wing, who faithfully served the donor <num value="38">38</num> years as a servant, and was rewarded by him with a clerk's place in his majesty's receipt of exchequer. 
<p>An excellent portrait of Mr. Wray, (a Kit-cat copied by Powell, in <datestruct value="1785--"><year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct>, from a picture by Mr. Dance,) hangs over the chimney. It is extremely well painted, and represents a mild and benevolent set of features. Below is a bronze medallion of the same gentleman; a profile bust in a Roman mantle, inscribed, <QUOTE lang=la>Daniel Wray, Anglus, aet. xxiv;</QUOTE> on the reverse, <QUOTE lang=la>Nil actum reputans cum quid superesset agendum,</QUOTE> by G. Pozzo. 
<p>The old court-room adjoining, is <num value="1">one</num> of the very few now remaining in London whose decorations are of the time of queen Elizabeth. It is magnificent, though mutilated; and venerable, though the ceiling has been white-washed. That bane of antiquity and of all taste, has demolished the emblazoned armorial distinctions painted and gilded under the direction of the duke of Norfolk, to whose family they belonged. The ceiling is flat; and the crests and supporters, within circular and square pannels, are of stucco. The duke's motto, <QUOTE lang=la>Sola Virtus invicta,</QUOTE> is inscribed at the north end. The walls are hung with tapestry; the clue to the story of which Mr. Malcolm was not able to find. A siege is <num value="1">one</num> subject: but, though it is otherwise perfect, the colours have in many places faded, even to obliteration of the figures. 
<p>The chimney-piece is most lavishly adorned. The basement is formed by <num value="4">four</num> Tuscan pillars; in the intercolumniations are gilded shields, containing paintings of Mars and Minerva. Over the fireplace are Faith, Hope, and Charity, on pannels of gold. The next division is composed of <num value="4">four</num> Ionic pillars; between them arched pannels, with fanciful gilded ornaments. The pedestals contain paintings of the Annunciation and Last Supper: the figures in those are of gold upon a black ground, and extremely well done. The space between the pedestals is filled by a gold ground, on which <pb id="p.424" n="424"> 
<p>Mr. Sutton's arms and initials have been introduced. Scrolls and cupids fill the intervals. The great centre pannel is of gold; with an oval containing the arms of James the <num value="1">First</num>, and a carved cherubim beneath. I need not add that those were introduced by Mr. Sutton's executors. 
<p><num value="2">Two</num> pillars, half Gothic, half Grecian, support the ceiling at the upper end of the room, placed there since <datestruct value="1611--"><year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct> ; near them is a large projecting window of <num value="16">sixteen</num> divisions, and <num value="2">two</num> others of <num value="8">eight</num> further south.

The ceiling and tapestry is tolerably perfect; but it reflects great discredit on the governors, not to appropriate it to a better and more respectable purpose.</NOTE>
 
<p>Returning through the gallery is the anti-room of the governors, near the stair-case. This is pannelled; and the chimney-piece decorated with a very large bas relief, of Faith, Hope, and Charity, but rudely performed. <num value="2">Two</num> highly polished ancient oaken tables, with enormous urns, and Ionic capitals, stand within it. 
<div2 type=section id="c.14.2"><HEAD>The New Governors' Room.</HEAD>
 
<p>Is a neat apartment; it has a very handsome Corinthian chimney-piece, surmounted by Mr. Sutton's crest. Between the pillars over the fire-place is the original portrait of the founder, from which Vertue made his engraving. The countenance of Mr. Sutton is manly, open, and benevolent, with large piercing eyes; the face receives additional interest from his silver locks and beard; but the colours are rather faded. His dress is a black furred gown, held across the breast by his left hand; near which is a piece of chain, with ruffs round his neck and sleeves. The frame of this picture is very finely carved, with figures of aged men, boys consulting globes, mathematical instruments, scrolls, and his arms, richly gilt; inscribed,  <QUOTE>aetatis <num value="79">79</num>, anno <datestruct value="1611"><year reg="1611">1611</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE>  
<p>On the left of the chimney is a whole length of Charles the <num value="2">Second</num>, with all the insignia of royalty on and about him, in a dark wig, his right hand on his hip, and his hat in the left, the right leg extended. The face is correctly drawn, and well coloured; but the drapery is indifferent. No painter's name. 
<p>On the east wall, Gilbert Sheldon, D. D. archbishop of Canterbury, in his robes, seated upon a purple chair thrice fringed with gold. He rests an open book against his thigh, and holds a white handkerchief in his left hand, on the arm of the chair. The collegiate cap hurts the air of his face, which is shaded by chesnut hair; on his chin and lips are tufts of beard. He has heavy eyebrows, and not a very prepossessing countenance. We do not find in it an index to his exalted goodness and unbounded charities. A table covered with purple velvet supports a book and letter before him, and the back ground is formed by a portico. No name. <pb id="p.425" n="425"> 
<p>Over a handsome mahogany door is a half length of Thomas Burnet, LL.D. master of the Charter-house, <datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>. An excellent painting, by sir Godfrey Kneller, who was Burnet's intimate friend, and prided himself upon the high finishing he bestowed upon this portrait. He has represented him seated, in a gown and band, with his left arm on that of the chair, his glove on, and the right held in his hand; a book open near him. He appears to have been about <num value="60">60</num> when this painting was done. The hair is slightly tinged with grey, and his features are regular and grave, but very pleasing. He was the author of the fanciful <title>Theory of the Earth,</title> and 
<title>Archaeologia Philosophica.</title>
 
<p>On the left side of the door, a whole length figure of William Craven, earl of Craven.<NOTE>He was the <num value="1">first</num> and only earl of that name, and had distinguished himself in the service of Gustavus king of Sweden, and of the elector palatine, who married the daughter of James I. to which lady this earl is said to have been afterwards privately married, and to have rebuilt for her his noble house at Hempsted Marshall, in Berkshire, which had been burnt down. He died<datestruct value="1697--"><year reg="1697">1697</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="88">88</num>, and was buried at Binley, near Coventry.</NOTE> He is in a complete coat of mail, with a truncheon in his right hand, and his left against the hip. His mantle and helmet lie by him on a bank, and in the back ground is a distant camp. He has dark flowing hair, whiskers, a band and tassels, and a commanding countenance, and appears about <num value="40">40</num>. No painter's name, but a very good picture. 
<p>Facing the earl, on the west wall, is a whole length of George Villiers, <num value="2">second</num> of that name, duke of Buckingham. His large and unpleasant features are obscured by bushy eye-brows, and an enormous light coloured wig. The vest is of white satin puffed over the waist, his right arms rest on the hip, and he holds his gloves in his left hand. The arms and knees are loaded with lace and ribbands. Those ornaments, and the high-heeled shoes, give the figure a half masculine, half feminine appearance, that is far from pleasing. 
<p>Over the door is a half-length, of lord chancellor Shaftesbury, seated in a dark wig. His right hand rests on a table, where lie the seals; his left hangs on the arm of the chair. His features are handsome, but pale and emaciated. 
<p>On the left side of the door a whole length of Charles Talbot, duke of Shrewsbury, in his robes; a round fresh coloured and handsome face, in a chesnut-coloured wig, with the lord treasurer's rod of office in his right hand; his hat lies on a pedestal. 
<p>On Mr. Sutton's right side, James Scot, duke of Monmouth; a whole length, in his robes, and dark wig. His right arm rests on a ballustrade, the hand holds his hat, the left touches his sword. His features large and pleasing. 
<p>The frames of all these pictures are of stucco and white; and between them are white ornaments on a blue ground; the ceiling is stuccoed, the floor waxed and polished, and there are <num value="3">three</num> arched windows on the north side. <pb id="p.426" n="426"> 
<p>The master's apartments adjoining are very large and elegant; and the view from them into the square is extremely pleasant for London. 
<p>Facing them is a long ancient gallery, in which are the following pictures, generally dirty and neglected. 
<p>Dr. Benjamin Laney, bishop of Ely, a half-length good picture, with white curled hair, and black cap; his hand on a skull. 
<p>John Robinson, D.D. dean of Windsor, bishop of Bristol, and lord privy seal, in his robes and black wig; his face large, and inclining to corpulency. 
<p>Dr. Humphrey Henchman, bishop of London, in his robes, grey hair and beard, with a good countenance. 
<p>John Sheffield, duke of Buckingham, an oval; handsome features and dark wig. 
<p>There are, besides, portraits of John lord Somers; Morley, bishop of Winchester; the late Dr. Fisher, bishop of Salisbury, and a prelate whose name is unknown. 
<p>On the north side of the principal court is 
<div2 type=section id="c.14.3"><HEAD>The Hall.</HEAD>
 
<p>It is small, and has a bay window at the east end, and a clumsy porch at the west, the intermediate space being divided by a buttress into <num value="2">two</num> large windows, with smaller ones over them. Over the porch are the royal arms. The roof is slated and has a small turret on the roof. The interior has a venerable appearance. Along the north side runs a massy gallery, and at the west end is a handsome screen, formed by <num value="6">six</num> columns of the Corinthian order, supporting an entablature. The roof is of oak, arched and enriched with pendants of the age of Elizabeth. On the north side is a large massy fire place, with the arms of Sutton. In the bay window is a patchwork piece of stained glass, containing an ancient shield of arms and those of Mr. Sutton. At the east end of the hall is a full length portrait of Mr. Sutton. The bay window, before noticed, consists of <num value="4">four</num> mullions and <num value="2">two</num> transoms, the heads of the upper lights are arched. 
<p>Adjoining the hall and having entrances on each side of the fire place is a smaller apartment, supported by pillars. 
<p>The school stands at the east end of the cloister, and is a very large room; over it is the dormitory, and on the ground floor facing the school the scholars' hall. 
<p>The opposite buildings are the work of various periods, chiefly since the Charter-house came into Mr. Sutton's possession. The apartments within are comfortable. 
<p>The gateway of the burial ground is so much decayed, that it has the appearance of greater antiquity than it deserves, if we may judge from its Grecian style. 
<p>A new quadrangle has been formed from the designs of Mr. Pilkington. The buildings are of brick of <num value="2">two</num> stories in height. <pb id="p.427" n="427"> 
<p>The doors and window frames are of stone. The whole of the buildings are embattled, and make a very respectable appearance. 
<div2 type=section id="c.14.4"><HEAD>Charter-house Square</HEAD>
 
<p>Is formed on <num value="3">three</num> sides by very good houses, the <num value="4">fourth</num> is in part filled by the old walls of the monastery. It is not a thoroughfare for carriages. At the north-east corner is Rutland-court, so named from the house of that noble family, afterwards used as a theatre by sir William Davenant. The area of the square is handsomely railed, and shaded by <num value="2">two</num> intersecting avenues of old trees. 
<p>Sir William Munson resided in a house,  <QUOTE>having <num value="2">two</num> little gardens,</QUOTE>  adjoining the west gate of Charter-house,  <QUOTE> that openeth into the olde churchyarde,</QUOTE>  in <datestruct value="1614--"><year reg="1614">1614</year></datestruct>.

<p><datestruct value="1617--"><year reg="1617">1617</year></datestruct>. William lord Cavendish resided in the church-yard.

In <datestruct value="1637--"><year reg="1637">1637</year></datestruct>, lord Dunsmore and lady De la Warre were inhabitants of the churchyard. In the same century lord Grey of Warke, and lady Wharton lived in the square. 
<p>It is well known that the monastery of the Chartreuse was supplied by water from the springs near the place now called White Conduit house at Pentonville, near Islington. It appears from an old paper plan of the course of the pipes, copied from <num value="1">one</num> more ancient on parchment, that the square piece of ground used as a place for the Carthusian scholars to exercise their limbs in between the hours of study was, when the convent flourished, nearly a perfect square, with agate and porter's lodge on the south side leading to the church-yard; or, possibly, this square may represent that which forms the present entrance to the Charter-house. It had another gate on the east. The west represents a blank wall; and in the north-west corner is a small passage. Against the north side is a conduit, <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4">fourth</num> as large as the area, in the shape of an equal sided cross. From this the pipe proceeds under a building into a narrow passage, on the east side of which are buildings with very high chimnies. This avenue leads to a square formed by houses on the east, west, and south sides, whose basements have only doors, and above them <num value="1">one</num> range of windows. Their fronts are pediments or gables. The pipe passes across the quadrangle, under a gate in the east wall, into the garden or wilderness. The north side has a gate with small buildings on either side. 
<p>The garden represents a perfect parallellogram, divided by what may probably be a bank from east to west. The north division has a gateway, near which is a row of trees from north to south, and an avenue east and west. The pipe passes, inclining to the north-east, under the gate, to a reservoir against the north wall. 
<p>Near it, to the west, is a gate leading to a building. In the <pb id="p.428" n="428"> northeast corner is a small cell. The pipe goes north through Marcum's gardens, and thence to the garden wall, in  <QUOTE>the waye to Ouldestreet.</QUOTE>  Near it is a cistern; it then crosses  <QUOTE>Wood's close,</QUOTE>  rather approaching the road to Islington; thence through St. John's meadow, called Whitwell-beach meadow; thence to the Nuns field, in which there had been a mill hill, then levelled; at the foot of it is a  <QUOTE>sespall.</QUOTE>  It now reaches the receipts of Clerkenwell from the north-east, and crosses the Clerkenwell pipe. Here the pipe was of oak, but cased in hard stone where it passed under the road. It then goes north on the east side of a mill hill in the commander's mantel of St. John of Jerusalem. The pipes of the Chartreuse and St. John's cross a stone gutter not far from the conduit head of the nuns of St. Benedict, which was under a hedge, where further west the Chartreuse had a large receptacle, whence a stone and brick channel conveyed the waste water to the commander's mantel. Close to this reservoir, and to the east, was a wind vent, and head of the conduit to the priory of St. John. In this place the Chartreuse pipes were <num value="3">three</num> in number to the <num value="3">third</num> fons; after which they were reduced to <num value="1">one</num>, and passed fons <num value="2">2</num> to fons <num value="1">1</num>. This received a spring from some little distance east, brought in by Jeremy Lawes, plumber.<NOTE>The waste water from the cistern was given to this man, who erected another in Charter-house lane, and sold the water. This water was presented by the governors to the inhabitants, on condition of paving and keeping the lane clean, <datestruct value="1617--"><year reg="1617">1617</year></datestruct>.</NOTE> The White Conduit house, as it is termed, stands <num value="43">43</num> perches south of the <num value="1">first</num> spring, between which and it were <num value="6">six</num> wells. Within the house was a leaden cistern, and in the bottom of it an aperture to carry off the waste water through a pipe of the same metal. Those pipes were all renewed from the Charter-house <num value="32">32</num> perches beyond the receptacle at the hedge, in <datestruct value="1511--"><year reg="1511">1511</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1512--"><year reg="1512">1512</year></datestruct>; at which time it is probable the monastery underwent a thorough repair, and had some additions made, as the date of the chapel is <datestruct value="1512--"><year reg="1512">1512</year></datestruct>; and sir Robert Dallington, master of the Charter-house, had them thoroughly cleansed in <datestruct value="1624--"><year reg="1624">1624</year></datestruct>. 
<p>In <datestruct value="1637--"><year reg="1637">1637</year></datestruct>, the earl of Exeter requested that water might be conveyed to his house at St. John's, for the use of himself and his lady only. From what follows, we find that the springs often failed. They refused to let him have it from the fountain head, but granted him during pleasure a pipe from the water house of the hospital, carrying at the rate of <num value="2">two</num> gallons in an hour. 
<p>The pipes were cleaned again in <datestruct value="1654--"><year reg="1654">1654</year></datestruct>; but the water was so reduced, that the governors ordered New River water to be brought for the hospital; since which time they became annually worse, till the rage for building has entirely overwhelmed the pipes, and their situation is scarcely known.

<div2 type=section id="c.14.5"><HEAD>Ely House.</HEAD>
<p><FIGURE id="Fig.429"><HEAD>Ely House</HEAD></FIGURE> 
<p>The bishop of Ely, whose see must formerly have been much more lucrative than at present, had <num value="1">one</num> of the most extensive episcopal domains in London, situated where Ely-place now stands. Ely-inn, as the mansion was <num value="1">first</num> called, and afterwards Ely-house, was built in consequence of a will of bishop John de Kirksley, who died in <datestruct value="1290--"><year reg="1290">1290</year></datestruct>, and left a messuage and cottages in Holborn to his successors. The next bishop of Ely, William de Luda, purchased several houses and some lands, which he also left to the bishops of that see. Extensive gardens were laid out, and such attention paid to horticulture by the resident bishops, that they were celebrated for the choice fruit they produced. Shakspeare alludes to this circumstance, in the play of Richard III., when he makes Glo'ster thus address the prelate, John Morton:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>My lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn, 
<L>I saw good strawberries in your garden there, 
<L>I do beseech you send for some of them.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The estate was afterwards much increased by various purchases, so that in the reign of queen Elizabeth, it contained upwards of <num value="20">twenty</num> acres of buildings and gardens, which were inclosed by a lofty wall. So large an estate tempted the cupidity of sir Christopher Hatton, who prevailed on the queen to ask for a part of it to be added to his own premises at Hatton-house. Cox, bishop of Ely, at <num value="1">first</num> refused, when the queen produced a compliance by the following laconic, but unlady-like epistle:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Proud prelate, 
<p>You know what you were before I made you what you are now; if you do not immediately comply with my request, I will unfrock you by G&mdash;. ELIZABETH.</QUOTE>
 <pb id="p.430" n="430"> 
<p>He must have been a proud prelate indeed, and an imprudent <num value="1">one</num> too, who would brook the queen's wishes after such a threat. The bishop, therefore, mortgaged to the queen, for the sum of <measure value="1800l." type=currency><num value="1800">1800</num>l.</measure> a considerable portion of the estate, including the gate-house of the palace, with the exception of <num value="2">two</num> rooms and several acres of land, reserving to himself and his successors,  <QUOTE> free access through the gate-house, walking in the garden, and the right to gather <num value="20">twenty</num> bushel of roses yearly.</QUOTE>  
<p>According to Pennant, John, duke of Lancaster, usually styled John of Gaunt, resided in this palace, and died here in <datestruct value="1399--"><year reg="1399">1399</year></datestruct>. Probably it was lent him by Hoodham, bishop of Ely, on the destruction of his palace of the Savoy by fire.<NOTE><BIBL>Vide ante vol. i. p. <num value="117">117</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>Ely-house, though curtailed of its fair proportion by Elizabeth, and afterwards dilapidated by the long parliament, continued to be the residence of the prelates of that see for the extended period of <num value="486">four hundred and eighty-six</num> years, during which time there were <num value="41">forty-one</num> bishops, <num value="6">six</num> of whom died within its walls. In <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, an act of parliament was passed which authorised the bishop to dispose of the house to the crown on terms that were agreed upon. 
<p>Ely-house, in the days of its splendour, and when kings and. princes banquetted within its lofty halls, was a very magnificent building. The entrance was through a large gateway into a paved court, bounded on the left by a small garden, from which it was separated by a low wall; and on the right, by some offices, supported by a colonnade. At the extremity stood the venerable hall, which was originally built of stone. To the north-west of the hall was a quadrangular cloister, and adjoining that a field containing about an acre of ground, in which was a chapel dedicated to St. Etheldreda, but when erected does not appear. 
<p>The hall was <num value="72">seventy-two</num> feet in length, <num value="32">thirty-two</num> feet wide, and <num value="30">thirty</num> feet high. The roof, which was of strong timber, formed a demi-dodecagon. The floor was paved with tiles, which at the upper end of the room was as usual raised; at the lower end was an oaken screen. The hall was lighted by <num value="6">six</num> gothic windows. <num value="4">four</num> of which were on the south and <num value="2">two</num> on the north side. Allusion has been previously made to a grand entertainment given here, in the middle of the <num value="15">fifteenth</num> century<NOTE><BIBL>Vide ante vol i. p. <num value="214">214</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> by the sergeants at law, who do not appear to have had a suitable place in which they could accommodate a large party, as such feasts were frequent at Elyhouse. <num value="1">One</num> still more splendid was given by the sergeants in <datestruct VALUE="1531-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1531">1531</year></datestruct>, which commenced on Friday, the <datestruct VALUE="-11-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></datestruct>, and continued until the Saturday following. Henry VIII., his queen, Catherine of Arragon, the foreign ambassadors, the lord mayor, the judges, the barons of the exchequer, knights and squires, the aldermen, masters in chancery, sergeants and their ladies, worshipful citizens, and the crafts of London, were among the guests. 
<p>Although the bishops of Ely lent their hall to these scenes of <pb id="p.431" n="431"> revelry, yet they appear to have employed their own revenues to a better purpose, that of feeding the poor; and it is recorded of West, who was bishop of this see in <datestruct value="1552--"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct>, that he daily fed <num value="200">two hundred</num> people at his gate: nor was episcopal benevolence confined to the bishops of Ely, for Richard de Berry, who was bishop of Durham in the reign of Edward III had <num value="8">eight</num> quarters of wheat made into bread every week, which with <QUOTE>alms</QUOTE> dishes and the  <QUOTE>fragments of his house,</QUOTE>  he gave to the poor. 
<p>On the sale of this estate in <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, the site was purchased by Charles Cole, esq. an architect and builder, and <num value="1">one</num> of the surveyors of the crown. He built Ely place, of which he was proprietor, and to which the ancient chapel serves as a place of worship. The east front of this chapel recedes from the line of houses, and has neat iron railings before it, within which a flight of steps leading to the <num value="2">two</num> plain entrances to the chapel. Above the doors i a very fine window of <num value="4">four</num> mullions with cinquefoil arches, and above them are numerous circles filled with roses and several quaterfoils. The west window differs in having a principal circle filled with <num value="3">three</num> roses and <num value="2">two</num> quaterfoils. The interor is neatly fitted up, though in a different style to the period of the architecture. The altar is at the east end, and around the <num value="3">three</num> remaining sides are galleries with a neat organ. The pulpit and desks are grouped in the centre aisle. The windows at the sides are of pointed architecture, and are united to each other by a handsome canopy with trefoil head, the sides being enriched with crockets, and the summit with a rich finial. The cornice and ceiling are modern. 
<div2 type=section id="c.14.6"><HEAD>The liberty of the Rolls.</HEAD>
 
<p>The master of the Rollis, <foreign lang=la>ex officio</foreign>, lord of <num value="1">one</num> of the pleasantest domains within London. It is a liberty of itself, exempt from the power of the sheriff of Middlesex, and of every other officer, except with leave of the master. Here he has a splendid house to reside in, from which he can pass into the court where he officiates, as from <num value="1">one</num> room into another; and behind it there is a large garden, where, in the midst of a crowded city, he may enjoy something of the pleasures of rural retirement. Here also he has a chapel of his own, the minister of which is of his own nomination. 
<p>The Liberty of the Rolls is situated between Chancery-lane and Fetter-lane, in the midst of a rural and pleasant area, partly formed by the neighbouring gardens of Clifford's-inn. On this site Henry III. founded an hospital, or convent, for the reception of converted Jews; himself forgetting the probability that many Israelites might deceive him and his priests, allured as they must have been by the easy and idle life offered to their acceptance in the <foreign lang=la>Domus Conversorum</foreign>, with the enjoyment of the revenues of <measure value="700bmark" type=currency><num value="700">700</num> marks</measure> per annum, and large forfeited possessions. However, whether their motives were sincere or otherwise, it is certain that the place was soon crowded with converts. Edward I. equally blinded by zeal, <pb id="p.432" n="432"> gave half the estates of several Jews, who were hanged for chipping the current coin, to this house; and the remainder to the society of Friars Preachers, whose efforts were doubtlessly redoubled, in preaching conversion to the descendants of Israel, by so liberal a donation. 
<p>In the <num value="18">18th</num> year of Edward III. the Jews were universally expelled from the kingdom: in consequence of which bigotted act the house of converts became still more neglected; but they appear to have retained their residence till <datestruct value="1377"><year reg="1377">1377</year></datestruct>, when a royal mandate ordained the house a receptacle for valuable records, or rolls of parchment; and hence the present name. 
<p>The term Master explains the office of the great law dignitary who presides over the rolls. He besides hears causes in Chancery during vacations in his court, which adjoins the chapel. His officers attend at suitable hours, for the purpose of making searches for those who wish to consult the records. The Master appoints--a preacher, and service is performed at the usual times within the building; which is said to have been designed by Inigo Jones. There are buttresses at each angle, an arched door, and a tall pointed window; and a cornice and pediment, of Grecian architecture, with an angular window in the tympanum. 
<p>The interior is neatly fitted up. The altar-screen is of the Ionic order, and the pulpit and reading desk are grouped in the centre aisle around the chapel, and in the galleries are the presses for reserving the records. There are several monuments in this edifice. A handsome monument by Torregiano, is intended for Dr. John Yong, and was inscribed:--

<p>An act was passed, <num value="12">12th</num> George II. which empowered the Master of the Rolls, for the time being, to make leases for <num value="41">forty-one</num> years, or less, in order to rebuild the old houses belonging to the Rolls office.

<p>In the year <datestruct value="1772"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, the house of commons appointed a committee to examine into the state of the public records at the Rolls chapel. The report informed the house, that they had found many of them greatly injured by damp, by being placed too near the wall; some obliterated, and the whole liable to be lost, by the practice of the clerks taking them home to make extracts. In consequence of this enquiry, every practicable remedy was immediately applied. 
<p>The master of the Rolls has the appointment of <num value="6">six</num> clerks to the court of Chancery, each of whom has <num value="15">fifteen</num> assistants under him, called clerks of court. The office of the <num value="6">six</num> clerks is a spacious stone building at the head of Chancery-lane, on the west side. Formerly they occupied an inn called Herflet inn, belonging to the priors of Nocton's park, opposite the Rolls chapel. The revenue of these clerks is derived almost entirely from fees for copies of proceedings in the court of Chancery; nor has it been sufficiently attended to, when complaints have been made of the extravagance of these fees, that they were established rather as a mode of payment for most of the business transacted in the office, than as a recompence for the copies themselves. The <num value="6">six</num> head clerks receive <num value="3">three</num>-eighths of the proceeds, and the remaining <num value="5">five</num>-eighthes are divided among the under clerks.

<p>The Borough of Southwark forms a considerable portion of the suburbs of London, with which it is connected by the bridge so well known by the name of London bridge. It is <num value="1">one</num> of the <pb id="p.434" n="434"> wards of the city of London, by the name of Bridge ward without, but--through the carelessness or inattention of the corporation, the magistrates of the county of Surrey have obtained a concurrent jurisdiction therein. 
<p>It formerly consisted of the parishes of St. George, St. Margaret, St. Mary Magdalen, St. Thomas, and St. Olave. St. Margaret and St. Mary Magdalen have been consolidated, and have had the name of St. Saviour given them on their purchasing the fine conventual church of St. Mary Overy, soon after the dissolution of religious houses. Out of this parish has been taken that of Christchurch, and out of that of St. Olaves, a parish has been created by the name of St. John. It is by far the largest town in the county of Surrey, as appears by the following return of the population, taken in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>.

Here it pursues a crooked course till it arrives opposite Crosby-row, on the west side of which it runs behind the houses, thence across While-street, by the end of Wycomb-place and Castle-street, across Hunter-street and the Bermondsey new road, and behind the houses on the east side of the Kent road, till it arrives at Grange road, where it turns to the west to St. Thomas a Watering; from hence it pursues a northerly course by the end of Swan place, across Townsend-street and Salisbury-street to Dover place in the New Kent road. Across this road and Theobald-street, on the north side of Portland place, to Kent-street, up the middle of which it traverses to Church-street, where it turns to the west, down Blackman-street and Newington causeway, to the Fishmonger's alms-houses, through the middle of which it <pb id="p.435" n="435"> pursues its course to the south end of Elliot's-row, thence across Gibraltar-row and South-street, on the north side of Brook's-street and the south side of Bethlehem hospital, across Durham-place, and northward to the west side of Tower-street, Baron's-buildings and Pleasant-row, on the south side of George-street, and across Blackfriars-road, eastward between Surrey-row and Wellington-street to Gravel-lane, along which it traverses in a northerly direction to Holland-street, and thence by Falcon dock to the river Thames. 
<p>The early history of the borough of Southwark has been amply detailed in a former volume of this work: and its great antiquity is evident from its peculiar situation, opposite a great city, and the certain knowledge we possess that it very early attracted the attention of the Romans, whose remains are constantly discovered where the ground is sufficiently excavated. 
<p>In the reign of Edward the Confessor, about <datestruct value="1053--"><year reg="1053">1053</year></datestruct>, Southwark appears to have been a corporation governed by a bailiff. In <datestruct value="1066--"><year reg="1066">1066</year></datestruct>, when William the <num value="1">First</num> marched to London, after the decisive battle of Hastings, he was attacked by the citizens of London in Southwark, which so irritated him, that he laid the whole of the borough in ashes, and marched to reduce the western counties. 
<p>The most authentic account of the state of Southwark at the time of the Norman invasion, is to be found in the valuable record called the Doomsday Book. In table V. of that portion relating to Sudrea (Surrey), and among the account of the possessions of the bishop of Bayeaux,<NOTE>In Normandy, celebrated for possessing a fine piece of tapestry, exhibiting the Norman invasion.</NOTE>

Edward the <num value="6">Sixth</num>, the city of London obtained a valuable addition to her property and privileges, by the confirmation of her ancient title to the borough of Southwark. By this charter, after reciting various places in the borough and surrounding parishes, which had been given to the citizens, except the house, gardens, and park of the late duke of Suffolk (now the Mint) and the King's Bench, the instrument proceeds thus: 
<p> <QUOTE>And that the said mayor and commonalty, and citizens, and their successors, shall and may, from henceforth and for ever, have, hold, enjoy, and use, as well within the said manor as in the town, borough, parishes, and precincts aforesaid, as well all and singular liberties and franchises aforesaid, as tolls, stallages,<NOTE>A payment for erecting or having a stall.</NOTE> pickages,<NOTE>A payment for breaking the ground in order to erect such stalls.</NOTE> and other our jurisdictions, liberties, franchises, and privileges whatsoever, which any archbishop of Canterbury, and which the said Charles, late duke of Suffolk, or any masters, brethren, or sisters of the late hospital of St. Thomas's, in Southwark, aforesaid; or any abbot of the said late monastery of St. Saviour's, St. Mary Bermondsey, next Southwark aforesaid, or any prior and convent of the late priory of St. Mary Overy, in the said county of Surrey, or any of them; ever had, held, or enjoyed, in the said manors, lands, tenements, and other the premises or places aforesaid, or any of them; or which we have, hold, or enjoy, by any means whatsoever, as fully, freely, and in as ample manner, as we, or our most dear father, Henry the VIII. late king of England, had, held, or enjoyed, or ought to have, hold, and enjoy the same.

<p>By what authority or right this positive and unlimited charter, which was confirmed by Charles II. and received parliamentary sanction, has repeatedly been violated, cannot yet be ascertained; and though legal discussions have been very diffusely circulated in the courts, till it can be proved beyond all doubt that the opinion of a judge is paramount to an ancient authentic charter, the following rights and privileges of the city of London, over and in the borough of Southwark, must exist in opposition to any sheriff, minister, or jurisdiction whatever ;-- <num value="1">1st</num>.-To be invested with all manner of regal rights and prerogatives, in and over the town and borough of Southwark, in as full a manner as if the same were in the king's hands.

<p>In pursuance of the above charter confirmed to the mayor, commonalty, and citizens of London, a court was held about a month after before sir Rowland Hill, knt. then lord mayor of London, and the aldermen of the same city, in Guildhall, when it was enacted,  <QUOTE>That besides the then ancient accustomed number of <num value="5">five</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num> aldermen, there shall be <num value="1">one</num> alderman more elected, to have the rule, charge, and governance, of the said borough and towne; and that <num value="4">four</num> discreet persons or more, being freemen of London, and dwelling within the said citie, or the borough of Southwark, or in other the liberties of the said citie, should from thenceforth, as often as the case should require, be from time to time nominated, appointed, and chosen, by the inhabitants of the said borough, for the time being, sitting in the said borough for that purpose, in such sort and order as the aldermen of London were in those days commonly elected.</QUOTE> <NOTE>Proceedings Court Common Council, July, <num value="4">4th</num> Edward VI.--<BIBL>Stowe, <num value="765">765</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>

<p>In <datestruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></datestruct>, the parliament was exceedingly alarmed by the march <pb id="p.440" n="440"> of general Fairfax with his army, towards London, and they and many of the citizens were much disposed to resist him, if they had had the means; divers officers and other inhabitants of Southwark, however, on <datestruct VALUE="-08-2"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg=2>2nd</day></datestruct>, petitioned the common council who had been summoned, that they might not be compelled to assume arms, nor march forth under the command of any but such as should be approved of by the generality of the borough, and that they might be left to their own defence. These inhabitants not having for some time approved of the proceedings of the citizens against the army, sent privately to the general, that they were willing to surrender the borough to him. Fairfax immediately sent a brigade, under the command of colonel Rainsborough, to take possession thereof; he was admitted into the works about <num value="2">two</num> o'clock in the morning, when finding the gates shut, and the portcullis set down at London bridge, he planted <num value="2">two</num> pieces of ordnance against the gate, and in a short time the great fort was surrendered.<NOTE><BIBL>Whitlock, <num value="265">265</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>A vote of parliament was soon after passed for demolishing the ramparts, bastions, and other works of fortification, which encircled the cities of London, and Westminster, and the borough of Southwark.

<p>A fire which broke out the <datestruct VALUE="1676-05-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>, burnt the town hall and a great part of the borough, in consequence of which an act of parliament was passed, erecting a judicature to determine differences touching houses so burnt and demolished, in the same manner as had been done in London after the great fire of <datestruct value="1666--"><year reg="1666">1666</year></datestruct>. The justices of the courts of King's-bench and Common Pleas, the barons of the Exchequer, the lord mayor and recorder of London, and every alderman who had borne the office of mayor; the steward of Southwark, with the viscount Langford, sir Francis Vincent, and <num value="20">twenty</num> other gentlemen of the county there named, or any <num value="5">five</num> or more of them (<num value="1">one</num> of the justices or barons being <num value="1">one</num>), were thereby constituted a court of record, summarily, and without the formalities used in the courts of law and equity, by verdict, testimony of witnesses on oath, examination of parties, or otherwise, to hear and determine all differences and demands arising between landlords, tenants, lessees, under tenants or occupiers of houses, or buildings, and premises destroyed or injured by the fire, and to make such orders as they should see fit. If the persons interested in the building so burnt, should not, within <num value="2">two</num> years from the <datestruct VALUE="-03-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> day of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct> then next, lay the foundation of the houses to be rebuilt, and should not re-build within the time limited by the court, the court might dispose of the premises to such persons as would rebuild, there being no assigns, and might award what sum should <pb id="p.441" n="441"> be paid to the proprietor; and if he would not accept the same, or through non-age, or any disability, he could not accept it, the court was empowered by warrant directed to the chief bailiff of the said borough, to summon a jury to assess such recompense as they should think fit. If any order should be made by less than <num value="7">seven</num>, the party dissatisfied might tender exceptions to <num value="1">one</num> of the justices or barons, and if he found probable cause of complaint, it might be reviewed by <num value="7">seven</num>, such appeal to be determined within <num value="6">six</num> months after the exceptions. All judgments, orders, &amp;c. were to be entered on parchment in books, to be delivered to the town clerk of London, and kept amongst the records of the city. The powers given, are by the act to continue for <num value="3">three</num> years, from the said <datestruct VALUE="-03-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></datestruct> (<datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>.) If the party ordered to rebuild, do not do it, the person grieved might sue at law or in equity. 
<p>All encroachments and purprestures on the High-street, and most especially between the foot of London-bridge and the Compter-lane, whereby the market was, or should be straightened, or the passage of people obstructed, should be regulated by the court; but the inhabitants of High-street might permit their stall-boards, when the shops, or shop-windows were set open, to turn over and extend into the street <num value="1">one</num> foot, and no more, for the convenience of their shops. The market to continue to be kept in the same place, and at the same times, where it had been anciently, and was then kept, and not to be removed or kept at any other times. 
<p>The court began their sittings <datestruct VALUE="1677-06-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> <month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1677">1677</year></datestruct>, when there were present, the lord mayor (Davies), the chief justice (Raynsford), the chief justice (North), baron Littleton, justice Jones, sir Thomas Aleyn, sir John Frederick, sir Joseph Sheldon, Edward Smyth, James Reading, Peter Rich, Richard How, John Freeman, John Applebe. 
<p>The subsequent meetings were attended chiefly by from <num value="5">five</num> to <num value="9">nine</num>.

<p>In <datestruct value="1761--"><year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>, the following petition was presented to the common council, praying of them to support their right and title to the <pb id="p.442" n="442"> borough of Southwark, against the intermeddling of the sheriffs and county magistracy;-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>Southwark, <datestruct VALUE="1761-02-14"><day reg="14">14</day> <month reg="02">Feb.</month> <year reg="1761">1761</year></datestruct>. 
<p>To the right honourable the lord mayor.-Your lordship being now entered on the high and important office, so honourably conferred on you by almost the unanimous suffrages of <num value="1">one</num> of the fullest assemblies ever held on that occasion, it need not be said that it becomes your duty, as it is doubtless your intention, to be the guardian and protector of all those ancient rights and privileges carefully handed down by their ancestors to the citizens of London. 
<p>It is with concern observed, that there should be so soon an occasion to trouble your lordship with recent instances, in which it is apprehended, these ancient rights have been invaded in the proclamation of his present majesty. 
<p><num value="1">First</num>, in that ancient franchise granted to the city of London in the borough of Southwark, which, without enumerating former grants, was, by the great charter of confirmation, so lately as the <num value="15">15th</num> year of king Charles II. fully confirmed to the mayor, commonalty, and citizens of London. 
<p>By this grant, which has received a parliamentary sanction, the said corporation are invested with all manner of royal rights and prerogatives, in and over the town and borough of Southwark, in as full a manner, as if the same were in the king's hands. In particular, to have all manner of liberties, customs, treasures, waifs, estrays, escheats, fines and forfeitures, view of frankpledge, &amp;c. Also to have all goods, chattels of traitors, felons, fugitives, &amp;c. and the execution of all writs, commands, attachments, warrants, &amp;c. by their sheriffs, and other officers. The serjeants at mace for the city to arrest for debt in the borough, in the same manner as they do in London. 
<p>The city magistrates to have the assay and assize of wine, bread, bear, victuals, and every thing set to sale, together with the punishment and correction of all persons dealing therein. Also to take and arrest all thieves, felons, and other criminals, found in the borough, and to commit them to Newgate, until delivered by due course of law. 
<p>The mayor, recorder, and aldermen, who are justices in London, are also constituted the justices for the borough, where they are to exercise the same jurisdiction as they do in London. And all and singular the inhabitants of the said borough to be under the magistracy and government of the mayor and officers of London, in the same manner as the inhabitants of the said city be. And, lastly, the sheriff of Surrey, and all others, the king's officers and ministers, are expressly prohibited from any ways intermeddling in the said borough. 
<p>It is not intended to shew the impropriety, as well as inconvenience, that the constables and other inhabitants of this city franchise are under, by their being subject to <num value="2">two</num> separate unconnected <pb id="p.443" n="443"> jurisdictions, each of which may assume to command their attendance at different places at the same time; nor yet to expatiate on the hardships of their being summoned to attend out of their borough, the commands of such, as they have at several quarter sessions held by your predecessors, been informed had no sort of authority over them. 
<p>The particular indignity offered to the city of London, now to be pointed out, is that whereas, when the present constables were sworn in, under the authority of the city of London, they had an assurance given them, that county-officers had no jurisdiction over them; nevertheless they were all summoned under large penalties, the <num value="1">first</num> of this month, to attend the county sheriff to proclaim the king through the boroughwick. 
<p>As there is a bailiff appointed by the city, under the lord-mayors, for the government of the borough, (which officer, who is now living, it is known, proclaimed his late majesty) it is submitted to your lordship's judgment, whether such officer was not the proper person to perform this duty, as well as he presides at the elections for members of parliament, or executes the other duties appertaining to that important office? For by what legal power can an officer execute any part of his office in a place the law expressly declares he shall no ways intermeddle; or how can he assume an authority to summon, under great penalties, constables, or any inhabitants of such a place, not only to attend in, but to follow him, to their great trouble and expence, to a considerable distance from their inhabitants, if he is expressly prohibited from exercising any kind of jurisdiction over them? 
<p>It has been said, that, supposing the city of London hath not hitherto exercised an, exclusive jurisdiction in the borough, they cannot, for that reason, maintain such a power; even although it should appear that, by the original grants, they are invested therewith. This objection, it is presumed, is answered by that part of the city charter, which declares they shall lose no privilege for non use, or even abuse. Lord Coke, in his <num value="4">4th</num> institute says,  <Q>There is a most beneficial statute made for the preservation of the liberties and franchises of the city of London, that they shall enjoy their whole liberties, with this clause, <foreign lang=la>Licet usi non fuerunt, vel abusi fuerunt</foreign>, and notwithstanding any statute to the contrary.</Q>  On this principle Black-friars precinct was lately restored to the city freedom, which had, time immemorial, claimed and maintained that exemption. 
<p>Therefore, as there are many citizens that are inhabitants in the borough, who particularly think themselves injured by being subject to <num value="2">two</num> separate jurisdictions, may it not be said, it becomes the city's duty, in support of the citizens rights, to fulfil the intentions of their charters, which so expressly prohibits the county sheriff from any ways intermeddling in this city franchise; more especially if it be a fact, that this officer has, on a legal trial, been proved to have no right to exercise any jurisdiction therein. <pb id="p.444" n="444"> 
<p>The following are part of the encroachments on the city jurisdiction, and the privileges of the inhabitants of the borough of Southwark, referred to in their petition :-- 
<LIST>

<ITEM><num value="1">1st</num>. The licencing public-houses by the county magistrates. 
<ITEM><num value="2">2nd</num>. Their acting as magistrates of the borough, and holding sessions in the town hall. 
<ITEM><num value="3">3rd</num>. Their interfering in the government of the borough fair, granted by royal charter to the city of London. 
<ITEM><num value="4">4th</num>. Their exercising jurisdiction over the borough constables, and taking upon them to swear them into that office a <num value="2">second</num> time, and also swearing in constables by their own authority, upon deaths or removals. 
<ITEM><num value="5">5th</num>. The sheriff of Surrey exercising jurisdiction in the said borough, and summoning the constables and other inhabitants to attend (contrary to the royal charters) the respective sessions held by the county magistrates, at different parts of the county. 
<ITEM><num value="6">6th</num>. The sheriff and marshal court officers arresting for debt in the borough. 
<ITEM><num value="7">7th</num>. The compelling the inhabitants of the borough to contribute towards the county rate, to pay the county coroner, who is prohibited any jurisdiction in the borough, and to repair bridges, gaols, &amp;c. all of which are upheld and repaired by the city of London. 
<ITEM><num value="8">8th</num>. The quartering soldiers in the borough, which, as a franchise and <num value="1">one</num> of the city wards, it is presumed, ought to be exempted from that burden. 
<ITEM><num value="9">9th</num>. The king's ministers and officers of the county of Surrey, taking upon them the power of ordering and governing the borough militia, which, it is also presumed, ought to be solely subject to the lord mayor, as chief magistrate of this ancient city franchise. 
</LIST>
 
<p>In several parts of this work it has been plainly shewn that the borough of Southwark was made an essential part of the city of London, though lying in the county of Surrey, with a jurisdiction as ancient as the <num value="1">first</num> of king Edward III. confirmed, strengthened, enlarged, and fully established by the grant of Edward VI. Nevertheless, we find that the magistracy of the city of London have adopted this ward only as a sinecure for the senior alderman for the time being, and neglected the more essential interest of the inhabitants of the said ward; and the justices of the county of Surrey have not failed to take advantage of their indifference and neglect of their jurisdiction within the said borough of Southwark, and now have so far encroached upon the chartered rights and privileges of the city of London, confirmed by parliament, as to contend with the citizens for their jurisdiction within the said borough, and to appoint constables to license victuallers, and to exercise other powers as justices of the peace for the county of Surrey, in the borough of Southwark, to the great inconvenience and hardship of the inhabitants, who are entitled to the freedom and privileges of the city of London in an equal degree to any of 
<pb id="p.445" n="445">
 their fellow-citizens, whose more fortunate situations in the heart of the city have hitherto rendered their rights undisputed. 
<p>But in opposition to the royal grants made to the city of London in behalf of the borough of Southwark, the county magistrates have illegally assumed and preserve an authority to themselves of appointing constables, licensing victuallers, and exercising other powers, as justices of peace for Surrey. 
<p>Leaving this matter in its present neglected and reprehensible state of encroachment by foreigners, we proceed to state, that of right this borough is under the jurisdiction and protection of the city of London, without the intermeddling of any sheriff, or other officer whatever, agreeably to the charter of Edward VI. and by the corporation it was and still is denominated Bridge Ward without.</QUOTE>

<p>This parish is situated east of the borough High-street; it is bounded on the north by the river Thames, on the east by the parish of St. John, on the north by Bermondsey parish and St. Thomas, and on the west by the parish of St. Saviour's. 
<p>Its particular boundaries are as follows: commencing at the foot of New London-bridge, the boundary proceeds to the High-street, where it turns south to the north side of St. Thomas's hospital, round which it proceeds to the-north side of the New way behind the houses, to the Maze, where it turns south to Maze Poud, which it traverses in a westerly direction to the south side of Guy's Hospital; here it turns south through Queen-street, to the north side of Snows'-fields, which it keeps to the east end of Snows'-fields, at its junction with Bermondsey-street, thence to Tooley-street, down which it proceeds in an easterly direction to Potter's-fields, where it arrives at the Thames.

 <pb id="p.446" n="446"> 
<p>The parish of St. Olave, like many others in the suburbs of London, being greatly increased both in number and inhabitants, the commissioners for erecting <num value="50">fifty</num> new churches within the bills of mortality, purchased the ground, in which the trained bands of Southwark formerly exercised, and from that circumstance called the artillery ground, whereon they erected a parish church, for the district of Horsly-down, and dedicated it to St. John the Evangelist, the inhabitants having obtained an act of parliament for constituting this portion of the parish of St. Olave into a separate parish, and making a provision for its rector. 
<div2 type=section id="c.16.1"><HEAD>St. Olave's Church.</HEAD>
 
<p>Though it cannot be ascertained at what time a church was <num value="1">first</num> situated on this spot, yet it is mentioned as early as the year <datestruct value="1281"><year reg="1281">1281</year></datestruct>. Part of the old church, however, falling down in <datestruct value="1736--"><year reg="1736">1736</year></datestruct>, and the rest being in an unsafe condition, owing to the graves being dug too near the foundation, the parishioners applied to parliament for a power to rebuild it, which being granted, they were enabled to raise <measure value="5000l." type=currency><num value="5000">5000</num>l.</measure> by granting annuities for lives, not exceeding <measure value="400l." type=currency><num value="400">400</num>l.</measure> in the whole; for payment of which a rate was to be made, not exceeding sixpence in the pound; <num value="2">two</num>-thirds to be paid by the landlord, <num value="1">one</num> by the tenant, to cease on the nomination of the annuities. The act contains a very proper restriction that no <num value="1">one</num> shall be buried in the church. 
<p>This church is a rectory, the patronage of which is in the gift of the crown. 
<p>The church is situated on the north side of the street, and with the exception of the south side, is concealed from public observation. The plan is divided into a vestibule at the west end, extending the breadth of the entire building. At the north west angle is the tower. The body of the church shews a nave and side aisles, and a small chancel. The south side has <num value="2">two</num> tier of windows, <num value="5">five</num> in each; the lower have segmental arches and key-stones, the upper are circles; the elevation finishes with a cornice; the vestibule forms an obtuse angle with this portion, and has a doorway covered with an elliptical pediment resting on consoles, over which is a circular window. The elevation is finished with an angular pediment The east front is in <num value="3">three</num> divisions, corresponding with the nave and aisles; in the south aisle is a doorway, as .before, surmounted by a round window. The chancel projects before the aisles, and has a large circular headed window in its eastern front, the elevation finished with a cornice. A clerestory is formed above the aisles, containing a corresponding number of semi-circular windows. The tower rises above the church in <num value="2">two</num> stories; in the <num value="1">first</num> is a round headed window, fronted by a ballustrade; in the <num value="2">second</num> a square pannel containing the clock dial, it is surmounted by a pediment. The elevation is finished with a cornice and ballustrade, every aspect of the elevation is uniform with that described. <pb id="p.447" n="447"> 
<p>The whole of the building which is visible, is faced with Portland stone, and the angles are rusticated, the north side being concealed from observation, is built with brick. The interior is made into a body and side aisles, by <num value="4">four</num> pedestals, of equal height with the pewing, on each side, from which rise an equal number of fluted Ionic columns, surmounted by their entablature, which is received on pilasters at its entrance, into the walls of the church. The entablature is crowned with a low attic, broken at intervals by brackets in the form of consoles, situated above the columns, and finished with a sub-cornice, which breaks over the brackets; the ceiling is a semi-circular vault, made into divisions, corresponding in size with the intercolumniations, by ribs with enriched soffites springing from the cornice over the brackets; each division is pierced laterally to admit the windows of the clerestory, and at the points of intersection are flowers, the spandrils are pannelled. The ceiling of the aisles is horizontal, and is made into square pannels, equal in width with the intercolumniations, by flying cornices received into a cornice, which finishes the side walls on the <num value="1">one</num> side, and the main cornice on the other. The altar occupies a semi-elliptical niche, equal in width with the nave. The wall is made into <num value="3">three</num> divisions by <num value="6">six</num> pilasters, <num value="4">four</num> of which are coupled, and the whole surmounted by the entablature continued from the church; in the central division is a small wainscot screen, occupying the dado of the eastern window, it is surmounted by a broken pediment in the centre of which is the pelican: it is inscribed with the decalogue. On ovals on the side divisions are the Lord's Prayer and the Belief, over which, in niches enclosed in square frontispieces, are full length statues of Moses and Aaron.<NOTE>Although paintings of Moses and Aaron occur in most of the London churches, this, and the church of Allhallow's, Thames, described <BIBL>vol. iii. page <num value="509">509</num></BIBL>, are the only instances of statues of their personages.</NOTE> The ceiling is composed of a half dome, the soffit enriched with <num value="3">three</num> rows of sunk pannels of an octagon form, enclosing flowers, and varying in size to accommodate the form of the cove: between the rows are small square pannels. The walls of the screen and the dome, are painted to imitate veined marble; the enrichments gilt. A gallery is erected at the west end with a ballustraded front, and also in each of the aisles. It is well contrived to avoid interfering with the main columns, behind which the fronts of the side galleries are enriched with cherubim heads, disposed in the form of consoles. The organ is situated in the western gallery; the case is oak, richly carved, and surmounted by the mitre and crown. The wall behind is ornamented with reliefs in plaister of a cherubic choir, musical instruments, &amp;c. The pulpit is situated on the north side of the central aisle, it is poligonal in plan, and sustained on a single pillar, with swelling front: it has no sounding board. The reading desk on the opposite side is in reality a desk, and not a <num value="2">second</num> pulpit, as is ridiculously the fashion in most new churches. The church <pb id="p.448" n="448"> is on the whole <num value="1">one</num> of the best imitations of the school of Wren. It closely resembles, almost to a copy, the church of St. Dionis Back-church, Fenchurch-street.<NOTE><BIBL>Described vol. iii. p. <num value="685">685</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The length of this church is <num value="82">82</num> feet, breadth <num value="59">59</num> feet. 
<p>The font is a neat basin of marble, and is situated on the north side of the church. 
<p>There are no monuments in this church. 
<p>The old church was a square of <num value="69">69</num> feet, <num value="40">40</num> feet high; the tower and turret <num value="95">95</num> feet, in which were <num value="6">six</num> bells.

<p>The bridge-house and some adjoining premises have been let to government for keeping their stores. 
<p>The government is vested in officers appointed by the city, denominated bridgemasters. The keepers of the bridge-house had anciently an interest in mills upon the river Lea, and were accustomed to repair the bridges at Stratford, for which reason the bridge-house arms are still cut on some of those bridges. 
<p>At a common council, <datestruct VALUE="-07-14"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=14>14</day></datestruct>, anno <datestruct value="53"><year reg="53">53</year></datestruct> Henry VIII. it was ordered that the seal of the bridge-house should be changed, because the image of Thomas Becket, archbishop of Canterbury, was engraven therein, and a new seal to be made, devised by Mr. Hall, to whom the old seal was delivered. This was occasioned by a proclamation, commanding the names of the pope and Thomas a Becket to be put out of all books and monuments; which is the reason that they are so often seen blotted out in old chronicles, legends, primers, and service-books printed before those times. 
<p>In <datestruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></datestruct>, some old granaries in Tooley-street, which belonged to the city, were taken down. They were built with chesnut.

There are <num value="2">two</num> entrances to this crypt in White-horse-court, leading from Tooley-street to Southwark-house, formerly the King's Head tavern, and prior to that the sign of the Walnut-tree. Entering by the north entrance, it is <num value="7">7</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches long, by <num value="6">6</num> feet wide, which leads to a large semicircular arched vault, <num value="39">39</num> feet <num value="3">3</num> <pb id="p.452" n="452"> inches long, by <num value="18">18</num> feet wide; on <num value="1">one</num> side is a well, <num value="2">2</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches, by <num value="1">1</num> foot, from which water is at present conveyed to the houses above. Towards the further end is a doorway, <num value="4">4</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches by <num value="3">3</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches, leading to another semicircular vaulted arch, <num value="31">31</num> feet long by <num value="13">13</num> feet <num value="10">10</num> inches wide; from this is a passage <num value="7">7</num> feet by <num value="6">6</num> feet, which leads to the principal apartment of this ancient building, the whole length of which is <num value="40">40</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches by <num value="16">16</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches in width. At the further end are <num value="2">two</num> windows, <num value="2">2</num> feet <num value="6">6</num> inches wide each; and on <num value="1">one</num> side there are likewise <num value="2">two</num> more of the same dimensions, and a passage <num value="4">4</num> feet wide, which leads to another apartment, but which is blocked up with stone and bricks. This ancient apartment (represented above) consists of <num value="4">four</num> groined arches, supported on dwarf columns <num value="4">4</num> feet <num value="10">10</num> inches in diameter. From this is an entrance to another vault of various dimensions, but the length is <num value="27">27</num> feet <num value="4">4</num> inches. Part of this vault is arched as the former, and part groined, over which the stairs leading to the grammar-school are erected. On entering the southern entrance we descend by a gradual slope into the <num value="2">second</num> semicircular apartment already described. The present flooring is of brick, rubbish, and earth, which have accumulated from time to time, so as to bury the pillars to within a short space of the surface, which was latterly proved by digging, on a prospect of converting the crypt into a cemetery for the use of the parish. The height of the roof is unequal from the partial rising of the ground, but is in general from <num value="8">8</num> to <num value="9">9</num> feet.

<p>Below the bridge, on the banks of the Thames, formerly stood the abbot of Battle's house. Nearly adjoining was Battle bridge, so called because it was situated on the ground, and over a watercourse, flowing out of the Thames, pertaining to Battle abbey. 
<p>The walks and gardens on the other side of the way, before the gate of the house, was called the Maze. 
<p>There was also an inn called the Fleur-de-lis, on the site of which were built several small tenements, for the accommodation of strangers and poor people. 
<p>In the reign of queen Anne this parish was much burthened by the resort of great numbers of the inhabitants of the palatinate in Germany, who fled to this country for protection from the tyranny of their rulers.

<p><num value="3000">Three thousand</num> had been sent in August, at the request of the lord lieutenant, and in February following, <num value="800">eight hundred</num> more were sent; but not meeting with a pleasant reception, in <datestruct value="1711--"><year reg="1711">1711</year></datestruct> <num value="232">two hundred and thirty-two</num> families, averaged at <num value="5">five</num> to each (<num value="1000">one thousand</num>, <num value="160">one hundred and sixty</num>) returned, and were crowded into the bridge house in this parish.

<p>The parish of St. Olave having greatly increased in number of houses and inhabitants, the commissioners for erecting <num value="50">fifty</num> new churches within the bills of mortality, purchased a site for a church and cemetery, consisting of a field which was walled in and called the Artillery ground, wherein the train bands of Southwark used to exercise.

<p>The bounds of this parish are as follows: commencing at St. Saviour's dock, it pursues a southerly course, through Russel-street and Church-street, to Artillery-lane and Crucifix-lane, up Bermondsey-street, down Tooley-street to Potter's-fields, and from thence to the Thames. 
<div2 type=section id="c.17.1"><HEAD>St. John's Church.</HEAD>
 
<p>This edifice is situated on the south side of Fair-street, in the centre of a spacious area used as a burial ground. It is a plain and inelegant building of stone; the plan gives a parallellogram; the <num value="2">two</num> longest sides broken in the centre, and receding a small degree behind <num value="2">two</num> small divisions at the extremities; the east front has a semicircular bow in the centre; the basement is occupied by extensive burial vaults. The west front commences with a stylobate broken in the centre by a lintelled doorway covered with a cornice; on each side the door is a small mean window, and above are <num value="3">three</num> lofty round-headed windows; the upright is finished with a cornice, surmounted by a pediment; the raking cornice and tympanum broken in the centre to make way for the tower, which is square in plan, and commences from the cornice with a lofty stylobate crowned with a string course, and perforated in its western front with a circular window; from the string course rise antae, dividing the breadth into <num value="3">three</num> portions, the centre occupied by a round-headed window filled with weather boarding, the side divisions by niches; the whole crowned by an entablature and attic, in the centre of which is a ballustrade; the <num value="4">four</num> aspects of this stage of the building are uniform: within the attic is a cubical pedestal with a clock dial on each face, and crowned with a cornice, from which an unsightly fluted pillar takes its rise, diminished most irregularly to its capital, which is Ionic; the whole is crowned with an acroterium and vane in the shape of a comet, and has strikingly the appearance of the chimney of a gas-light establishment. The flank walls are broken into a recess and projecting ends, for no apparent purpose; in the latter portions are <num value="3">three</num> windows in height, in succession; the centre is parallellogrammatic, the others square, and devoid of architraves, the upright finished with a cornice; in the recessed portion is a lintelled entrance in the centre, between <num value="2">two</num> small windows, and surmounted by a Venetian window of the Ionic order; on each side of which are <num value="2">two</num> windows, the lower square, the upper round-headed, corresponding with the <pb id="p.455" n="455"> west front; the elevation is finished with a cornice of great projection brought out sufficiently to range with the projections; the east front is in <num value="3">three</num> portions; the central is a semicircular bow lighted by <num value="4">four</num> windows in succession, of the same character as in the projections in the flanks; the upright is finished with a cornice in the wall of the church; on each side are other windows of a similar character; the wall rises above the bow in a pediment,--the horizontal cornice of which is omitted, and the tympanum pierced with a porthole window. The roof is covered with slate above the central portion before remarked, and there rises to a high ridge, but it is considerably lower at the extreme eastern division, and in consequence has an extremely unsightly appearance: a permanent flag staff is erected at the east end. The interior is of a character equally mean with the outside, and is injured by projecting piers; at each side marking the divisions before noticed, which obtrude most unnecessarily on the design; it is not divided by pillars or arches, and the walls are finished by a dentillated cornice on which rests the ceiling, which is horizontal and pannelled; in the centre a large square panne;, the corners cut off and concaved; at each end, a circular <num value="1">one</num>. A gallery occupies the <num value="2">two</num> sides and west end; it rests on Doric columns, and the front is composed of the entablature of the order in which the mutules are unwarrantably omitted, surmounted by an attic; on the western portion is inscribed, - <QUOTE>This church was consecrated A. D. <datestruct value="1733"><year reg="1733">1733</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE>  The altar occupies the eastern bow which is ceiled with a hemispherical dome; the soffit ornamented with a choir of cherubs in relief, and a series of pannels: the altar screen is of wood painted white, with gilt enrichments; it is made into divisions by Ionic pilasters; the centre is marked by <num value="2">two</num> insulated fluted columns, over which the entablature is brought forward; the usual inscriptions and <num value="2">two</num> windows occupy the intervals; over the screen in the centre is a painting of no great merit of  <QUOTE> St. John writing the Apocalypse,</QUOTE>  by the rev. Mr Peters. The organ, in a large carved ease, is situated on the western branch of the gallery. The pulpit is circular and very lofty; it is enriched with large cartouches, and the sounding board is of the same form, and sustained on <num value="2">two</num> square pilasters of the Ionic order: below the pulpit are the reading and clerk's desks; the whole are grouped on the south side of the middle aisle. The font is a circular basin of white marble on a balluster, and is situated below the western gallery. 
<p>There are several monuments in this church, but none particularly worthy notice. The principal is in the south wall; it consists of a neat marble tablet with the sword, mace, cap of maintenance, &amp;c. to sir Robert Kite, knt. and alderman, who died <datestruct VALUE="1772-09-1"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=1>1</day>, <year reg=1772>1772</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="61">61</num>.

<p>This is a small parish, extending from the High- street eastward, to the Maze (in St. Olave's), a few houses of which are included within it, as before mentioned; on the west it is bounded by the High-street, and north and south by St. Olave's parish. Stow says, that anciently there were no inhabitants in this district but such as had a dependence on the religious foundation of St. Thomas. When king Edward granted that to the city of London, he, as supreme head of the church of England and Ireland, made this district parochial, appropriating the parish and church of St. Thomas to the mayor and commonalty of the city of London.<NOTE><BIBL>Manning and Bray, vol. iii. p. <num value="614">614</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The bounds of this parish are as follows: commencing at the High-street, it proceeds on the north side of St. Thomas's hospital to Joiners-street; thence behind the houses on the north side of the New-way to the Maze; thence to the Maze-pond by the south side of Guy's hospital to the High-street. 
<div2 type=section id="c.18.1"><HEAD>St. Thomas's Church.</HEAD>
 
<p>St. Thomas's church is situate on the north side of St. Thomas's street; it is a donation in the gift of the governors of St. Thomas's hospital, the church being originally part of the hospital, as indeed it still remains, forming a part of the south side of it, where is a door of entrance; the door for the parishioners being in St. Thomas's street. The number of inhabitants within the precinct increasing, it was made parochial by king Edward VI. and a chapel was erected within the hospital for the use of the patients. The parishioners pay no tithes or church rates, and the vestry is open. The church being old and ruinous, in <datestruct value="1702--"><year reg="1702">1702</year></datestruct> it was rebuilt at the expense of <measure value="3000l." type=currency><num value="3000">3,000</num>l.</measure> granted out of the coal duty, with the further assistance of the governors and others. <pb id="p.457" n="457"> 
<p>The present edifice is a plain building of red brick, with stone dressings of an unassuming character. The plan is an oblong square, with a square tower attached to the south side. The tower is made in height into <num value="3">three</num> stories, divided by string courses. The south and east fronts have entrances enclosed in stone frontispieces, and covered with elliptical pediments resting on consoles; in the tympanum of each is a relief of cherubic heads. Over each door is a circular window; in the <num value="2">second</num> and <num value="3">third</num> stories are round-headed windows; and the elevation is finished with a cornice surmounted by an attic. At the north-west corner is an attached staircase. The west front is built against by the vestry-room, and the north abuts on the church; in such portions as are clear of these incumbrances each aspect of the elevation is alike. The south side of the church, which is seen from the street, has <num value="4">four</num> lofty circular arched windows, the key-stones carved with cherubim; the elevation is finished with an attic over a cornice; in the centre a pediment. The east end is entirely built against; the north side is partly built over the cloister, which surrounds the inner court of the hospital. In that portion of the wall which is clear, are <num value="4">four</num> windows made to correspond with the rest of the buildings: these windows are lintelled on the outside, but are arched in the interior, to correspond with those on the opposite side of the church. The ground floor of the tower forms a porch to the church: on the west side is an entrance to the vestry. 
<p>The interior of the church is exceedingly plain, and not quite uniform, owing to the intrusion of the cloister on the plan. The walls are finished with a cornice enriched with mouldings and mutules of the Doric order, upon which rests a horizontal ceiling of plain plaster without ornament. A gallery is erected over the cloister; the front, dark oak pannelled. A continuation of the same gallery covers the west end of the building. The altar- screen is composed of oak, and consists of a central and side divisions. The former has <num value="2">two</num> Corinthian pilasters, surmounted by their entablature and a segmental pediment; the horizontal cornice broken to let in a pannel painted with a choir of cherubs and the Hebrew name of the Deity. Between the pilasters is the decalogue. The pediment is crowned with an attic, in the centre of which is the royal arms of George I. and over them the crest; on the side pilasters the lion and unicorn; the whole executed in dark oak. The side compartments are pannels inscribed with the paternoster and creed, and covered with pediments surmounted by ill-formed obelisks ending in flames. The pulpit and desks are grouped on the south side of the altar-rails. The former is hexagonal, and rests on a pillar, but is not remarkable for ornament. The font is placed against the north wall, near the west end; it is a plain marble basin, with an oak cover.

<p>In this parish there was an ancient custom, that the principal inhabitants annually met and dined together on the <datestruct VALUE="-05-1"><day reg="1">first</day> day of <month reg="05">May</month></datestruct>, when the <num value="1">one</num> who presided was called the steward. At the meeting in <datestruct value="1698--"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>, Mr. John Panther being in that office, proposed to make a collection for binding out as apprentices, the children of poor persons having a legal settlement; this was readily acceded to, and the minister of the parish, and such gentlemen as had served the office of steward, and should afterwards serve it, were to be the governors. This excellent plan has been followed ever since. The members for the borough are always invited to the feast, and a liberal collection is made. 
<p>The governors meet the <num value="1">first</num> Friday after every quarter day, to consider of the application of the subscription money. Not more than <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>l.</measure> is to be given with a boy, or more than <num value="51">51</num>. with a girl.

<p>By liberal donations and good management of the surplus, several <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> pounds</measure> have been invested in the public funds, which will soon enable the governors to extend the sum given with the apprentices.<NOTE><BIBL>Manning and Bray's Surrey, iii. p. <num value="631">631</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<div2 type=section id="c.18.3"><HEAD>Hospital of St. Thomas.</HEAD>
 
<p>Within the precincts of the priory of St. Mary Overy, there was a building appropriated to the use of the poor, which maintained certain brethren and sisters, of whom Amicius, the archdeacon of Surrey, was the custos. This building was destroyed by fire in <datestruct value="1213--"><year reg="1213">1213</year></datestruct>, and the canons erected a temporary building for the reception of the poor, a small distance from the priory; but Peter de Rupibus, the munificent bishop of Winchester, disliking the situation,  <QUOTE>by reason of the straightness of the place, and the scarcity of water,</QUOTE>  and thinking the foundation, which had been made by the prior of Bermondsey, too confined in its operation, united the <num value="2">two</num> institutions, refounding them for canons regular, and endowing them with <num value="344">344</num>l a year. The new foundation was dedicated to the celebrated Becket, under the title of the Hospital of St. Thomas the <pb id="p.459" n="459"> 
<p>Martyr. This was done on the estate of Amicus, for the sake of purer air, and having plenty of water. These circumstances are so stated in an indulgence for <num value="20">twenty</num> days, granted by that bishop to such as should contribute to the expense of the new hospital,  <QUOTE>the old hospital for maintenance of the poor, long since built, having been destroyed by fire, and utterly reduced to ashes.</QUOTE> <NOTE><BIBL>Book of Muniments, folio <num value="5">5</num>, note.</BIBL></NOTE> From the liberality of this prelate, it was accounted of the foundation of the bishops of Winchester, and they had the patronage of it. 
<p>Between the erection of the new building, and the year <datestruct value="1238"><year reg="1238">1238</year></datestruct>, when this bishop died, the master and brethren had procured a cemetery to be consecrated for their use, but in this they were opposed by the prior and convent of St. Mary Overy, as being prejudicial to their parishes of St. Mary Magdalen and St. Margaret. At length, by the interference of the bishop and others, the convent dropped the prosecution of the matter, and, with consent of the bishop and the vicar of St. Mary Magdalen, they released their claim, allowing the use of the cemetery for all such as died within their own precincts, and such others as should choose sepulture there, but not for the parishioners of St. Mary Magdalen and St. Margaret, unless saving the rights of these churches. They also restrained them from having more than <num value="2">two</num> bells in their belfry, of an <num value="100">hundred</num> weight, and they were to pay to the prior and convent a quit rent of <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> charged on a tenement in Trinity-lane, and to the vicar of St. Mary Magdalen <measure value="12d." type=currency><num value="12">12</num>d.</measure> yearly at Easter. The rector of St. Margaret, however, seems to have been dissatisfied at not receiving some acknowledgment as well as the vicar of St. Mary Magdalen, for the bishop, in the grant of this burial ground, which he made by Alan de Stoke, his commissary, reserved <measure value="12d." type=currency><num value="12">12</num>d.</measure> a year to this rector, in lieu of such oblations and obventions as he would be deprived of by the appointment of this burial ground, and Ralph de Reygate, then rector, for himself and successors, released all right to such oblations and obventions. The bishop appears also to have prevailed on the priory to accept <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>s.</measure> a year, instead of <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> for <measure value="2s." type=currency><num value="2">2</num>s.</measure> is the sum payable to the prior and convent by this instrument. The <measure value="12d." type=currency><num value="12">12</num>d.</measure> to the vicar of St. Mary Magdalen is also here reserved. 
<p>Soon after the fire in <datestruct value="1213--"><year reg="1213">1213</year></datestruct>, viz. in <datestruct value="1215--"><year reg="1215">1215</year></datestruct>, it was agreed between Martin the prior of the convent, and Amicius, archdeacon of Surrey, rector of the hospital of St. Thomas, Southwark, and the brethren of the same, that the convent should permit the brethren and sisters of the old hospital of St. Thomas to pass into the new hospital of St. Thomas in Southwark, founded on the land of the church of Winchester, (<foreign lang=la>in fundo Winton eccl'iae</foreign>) free from all subjection to their church, with all their goods, rents, and lands, saving to the prior and convent the lands of Melewell (or Milkwell, in Camberwell and Lambeth) the site of the old hospital, and the orchard or garden in Trinety-lane, which Ralph Carbonell sold to the old <pb id="p.460" n="460"> hospital, quit of all demands from the canons.

<p>In <datestruct value="1238--"><year reg="1238">1238</year></datestruct>, the master and brethren of the new hospital, granted to Lucas, archdeacon of Surrey, <num value="1">one</num> hall, with a chapel, stable, and other appurtenances, within the precincts of the hospital, for his life, for a mansion or dwelling. He covenants for himself and his successors, that they should not, by virtue of this grant, claim any authority, jurisdiction, property, or succession in the same, to the damage or molestation of the master and brethren. In <datestruct value="1249--"><year reg="1249">1249</year></datestruct>, this Lucas, by the name of Lucas de Rupibus, subdeacon of the pope, released all his rights herein to the master and brethren. <NOTE><BIBL>Muniments, fol. <num value="446">4,46</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The archideaconal jurisdiction had been granted to this house by the archdeacons of Surrey, but it seems as if the claim had sometimes been revived; for in <datestruct value="1417--"><year reg="1417">1417</year></datestruct>, John Forest, then archdeacon, released it from his jurisdiction and confirmed the former grants, so as that neither he nor his official or commissary, should exercise any jurisdiction within the precincts of this hospital, over any persons, regular or secular, or in any causes, civil or criminal, but the brethren and their commissary should have the sole cognizance of all matters, with the proving wills of persons dying within the same, saving the rights and dignity of the archdeacon in the church of Winton, and the usual pension of <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>s.</measure> <hi rend=italics><measure value="4d." type=currency><num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> to</hi> be paid annually at Easter to him and his successors.<NOTE><BIBL>Muniments, fol. <num value="5">5</num>, <num value="6">6</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p>The bishops of Winchester, however, seem to have claimed, and in fact to have often exercised, a jurisdiction in the nomination of the master, though with a salvo to the rights of the brethren, somewhat similar to the <foreign lang=fr>conge d&lsquo;elire</foreign> on the appointment of a bishop, as will appear in several instances mentioned in the list of masters. In <datestruct value="1323--"><year reg="1323">1323</year></datestruct>, there was a visitation by the bishop, when it <pb id="p.461" n="461"> was ordained that the master and brethren of the hospital should observe the rule of St. Augustine, which they professed, in obedience, chastity, abdication of separate property, and that the master should eat with the brethren.<NOTE><BIBL>Muniments, fol. <num value="330">330</num>.</BIBL></NOTE>
 
<p><num value="26">26th</num> Henry VIII. <datestruct value="1535--"><year reg="1535">1535</year></datestruct>, it was surrendered to the king, according to Willis,<NOTE><BIBL>Abbies <num value="11">11</num>, <num value="234">234</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> by the master, Richard Mabbot, clerk, but bishop Burnet says, by Thomas Thirleby.<NOTE><BIBL>Hist. of the Reformation.</BIBL></NOTE>
At this time there were a master and brethren, and <num value="3">three</num> lay sisters. They made <num value="40">40</num> beds for poor infirm people, who also had victuals and firing. The revenues, according to Dugdale and Speed, were <measure value="266l. 17s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="266">266</num>l. <num value="17">17</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure>; but by a MS. valor in the <num value="1">First</num> Fruits office, <measure value="347l. 3s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="347">347</num>l. <num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> or <measure value="309l. 1s. 11d." type=Currency><num value="309">309</num>l. <num value="1">1</num>s. <num value="11">11</num>d.</measure> clear. Tanner supposes the latter to be a <num value="2">second</num> valuation. 
<p>After the dissolution, the hospital was neglected, and the buildings became ruinous; but, in <datestruct value="1552--"><year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct>, Ridley, bishop of London, by a well-timed sermon preached before the young king, awakened the benevolence of his disposition; the king consulted with him how he should commence some great charitable institution, and by his advice, addressed a letter to the mayor and corporation of London, announcing his intention and requiring their advice. After some consultation, at which the bishop assisted, <num value="3">three</num> different institutions were suggested, which at length produced Christ's hospital for education of youth; Bridewell for the poor, and correcting the profligate, and this of St. Thomas, for the lame and diseased. 
<p>The king highly approved of these plans, and steps were immediately taken for establishing such foundations. 
<p>The city purchased St. Thomas's of the king, with the other property mentioned before; and in <datestruct VALUE="1552-07--"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1552">1552</year></datestruct>, began to repair and enlarge it, and so diligent were they in the work, that expending about <measure value="1100l." type=currency><num value="1100">1,100</num>l.</measure> thereon, in the November following, they received into it no less sum than <num value="260">260</num> poor infirm persons. The king was so well pleased with what they had done, that on the <datestruct VALUE="1553-06-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month> <year reg="1553">1553</year></datestruct>, he granted them a charter of incorporation for this foundation. In this year the city published an account, by which it appeared that they had expended on this and Christ's hospital, in repairs and furniture, <measure value="2479l. 10s. 10d." type=Currency><num value="2479">2,479</num>l. <num value="10">10</num>s. <num value="10">10</num>d.</measure> In the British Museum, Sloanian MS. <num value="6277">6277</num>, is an extract from the proceedings at a court held by the governors, <datestruct VALUE="1579-04-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> <month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1579">1579</year></datestruct>, stating that for divers good causes moving this court, and that the rents, as well of those manors, lands, &amp;c. wherewith it pleased our late sovereign lord king Edward VI. moved with compassion of the state of the poor, to endow the mayor, &amp;c. withall, which now belong to the house of St. Thomas's hospital, as of all other lands, &amp;c. which may be given or purchased, to the use of this house, may be truly employed for the use of the poor, according to the <pb id="p.462" n="462"> godly meaning of the late king and other benefactors; and that such manors, lands, &amp;c. as fittist to farm for provision of grain to this house, may be reserved for that purpose, that good grain may be found by our tenants, and that the rents of the residue may by increased in godly sort, according to the time, for that the yearle expenses do exceed the yearly revenue, <foreign lang=la>communibus annis <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">300</num>l.</measure></foreign> a year at least. Therefore, by general consent of the governors, it is ordered that there shall be no lease or grant in reversion, or in possession, till <num value="1">one</num> year, or <num value="2">two</num> at most, of the expiration of old lease, and that but for <num value="21">twenty-one</num> years, or under, and that not to any governor or to his use, nor of more land than in the occupation of the lessee at such time. But building leases may be granted of old decayed houses or pieces of land in London, or the suburbs. 
<p>Orders to be observed.-A minute book of the proceedings of the governors to be kept; the minutes read at the next court, and corrected or confirmed. 
<p>If a lessee shall underlett, the actual occupier to have the option of renewal, after him such person as will give most, and undertake to reside. All estates to be surveyed by the surveyor, sometimes by the treasurer, before letting. Tenants are bound to all repairs. A book is kept for entry of all sums due to the hospital for fines of any leases, wood, &amp;c. 
<p>The beef of the poor is bought by weight without bones, and candles taken in exchange for the tallow. 
<p>For every quarter of wheat delivered at the water-side, the baker delivers to the hospital <num value="35">thirty-five</num> dozen and <num value="13">thirteen</num> loaves of bread, without any vantage, of the goodness of London wheaten bread, each loaf to weigh <num value="16">sixteen</num> ounces. 
<p>The annual amount of the revenues bestowed by king Edward VI. on this hospital, Christ's, and Bridewell, is said to have been <measure value="3266l. 13s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="3266">3,266</num>l. <num value="13">13</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> 
<p>Subsequent donations are entered on tables in the court-room, and on the staircase. 
<p>This hospital suffered greatly in its possessions, though not in its own buildings, by the fires in <datestruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct>, <datestruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></datestruct>, and <datestruct value="1689--"><year reg="1689">1689</year></datestruct>. That in <datestruct value="1676--"><year reg="1676">1676</year></datestruct> stopped as it just came to it. The building being from its age greatly decayed, a subscription was set on foot to rebuild and enlarge it, to which the governors contributed liberally, and amongst them sir Robert Clayton stands conspicuous. 
<p>The <num value="1">first</num> stone of the new building was laid by sir John Fleet, who was lord mayor in <datestruct value="1692--"><year reg="1692">1692</year></datestruct>. 
<p>The whole was executed at different times, and not completed till the year <datestruct value="1732"><year reg="1732">1732</year></datestruct>. 
<p>The hospital now consists of <num value="3">three</num> quadrangles, or square courts. In the front, next the street, is a handsome pair of large iron gates, with a door of the same work on each side, for the convenience of foot-passengers. These are fastened on the sides to stone piers, on each of which is a statue representing <num value="1">one</num> of the <pb id="p.463" n="463"> patients.<NOTE>This gate and the <num value="2">two</num> large houses on either side, were erected by Mr. Guy, at as expense of <measure value="3000l." type=currency><num value="3000">3,000</num>l.</measure></NOTE> These gates open into a very neat square court, encompassed on <num value="3">three</num> sides with a colonnade of Tuscan pillars, surrounded with benches, next the wall, for the accommodation of people to sit and rest themselves. On the south side, under an empty niche, is the following inscription:--

<p>The centre of the principal front, facing the street, is of stone. On the top is a clock, under a small circular pediment, and beneath that, in a niche, the statue of king Edward VI. holding a sceptre in his right hand, and the charter of incorporation in his left. A little lower, in niches on each side, is a man with a crutch, and a sick woman; and, under them, in other niches, a man with a wooden leg, and a woman with her arm in a sling. Over the niches are festoons, and between the last-mentioned figures, the kings arms in relievo: under which is this inscription :--

<div2 type=section id="c.18.4"><HEAD>Guy's Hospital.</HEAD>
 
<p>On the north side of St. Thomas-street, stands this truly excellent foundation, little inferior to the last, but more remarkable, from <pb id="p.466" n="466"> the circumstance of its having been built and endowed by a single individual; it is indeed a monument of private munificence, to which it would be difficult to produce a parallel. It is named after its founder, Thomas Guy. He was the son of a lighterman and coal-dealer in Horsleydown, was born in <datestruct value="1644--"><year reg="1644">1644</year></datestruct>, and was put apprentice to a bookseller and binder, on <datestruct VALUE="1664-09-3"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=3>3</day>, <year reg=1664>1664</year></datestruct>. He began business with a stock of the value of about <measure value="200l." type=currency><num value="200">200</num>l.</measure> in the house which still forms the angle between Cornhill and Lombard-street. English bibles being at that time very indifferently printed, he engaged in a scheme for printing them in Holland, and importing them into this country; but this practice proving detrimental to the university and the king's printer, they employed all possible means to suppress it, and so far succeeded, that Mr. Guy found it his interest to enter into a contract with them, and in consequence enjoyed a very extensive and lucrative trade. Being a single man, he spent a very small portion of his profits. He dined on his counter, with no other tablecloth than a newspaper, and was not more nice about his apparel. But a still more profitable concern than his trade was opened to his active mind during queen Anne's wars, when he is said to have acquired the bulk of his fortune by the purchase of seamen's tickets.  <QUOTE> For the application of this fortune to charitable uses, the public,</QUOTE>  says Highmore, in his History of the Public Charities of London,  <QUOTE>are indebted to a trifling circumstance. He employed a female servant whom he had agreed to marry. Some days previous to the intended ceremony, he had ordered the pavement before his door to be mended up to a particular stone which he had marked, and then left his house on business. The servant in his absence, looking at the workmen, saw a broken stone beyond this mark which they had not repaired, and on pointing to it with that design, they acquainted her that Mr. Guy had not ordered them to go so far. She, however, directed it to be done, adding, with the security incidental to her expectation of soon becoming his wife: </QUOTE> Tell him I bade you, and he will not be angry. <QUOTE> But she too soon learnt how fatal it is for any <num value="1">one</num> in a dependent situation to exceed the limits of their authority; for her master, on his return, was enraged at finding that they had gone beyond his orders, renounced his engagement to his servant, and devoted his ample fortune to public charity.</QUOTE>  
<p>Mr. Guy served in several parliaments for Tamworth, in Staffordshire, where his mother was born, and where he founded almshouses for <num value="14">fourteen</num> men and women, besides bestowing considerable benefactions. The burgesses, however, forgetful of his services, gave their suffrages to an opposing candidate. They soon repented of their ingratitude, and when too late to repair it, sent a deputation to implore his pardon and to intreat his permission to re-elect him for the next parliament; but he rejected the offer on account of his advanced age, and never represented any other place. <pb id="p.467" n="467"> 
<p>Besides the large sums which Mr. Guy expended on his own hospital, and that of St. Thomas, he bequeathed to Christ's hospital a perpetual annuity of <measure value="400l." type=currency><num value="400">400</num>l.</measure> for receiving <num value="4">four</num> children yearly; to his poor relations he left annuities for life to the amount of <measure value="870l." type=currency><num value="870">870</num>l.</measure> and among his younger relations and executors <measure value="75589l." type=currency><num value="75589">75,589</num>l.</measure>; <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num>l.</measure> for discharging poor prisoners within the city of London, and in the counties of Middlesex and Surrey, who could be released for <measure value="5l." type=currency><num value="5">five</num> pounds</measure>; and a perpetual annuity of <measure value="125l." type=currency><num value="125">125</num>l.</measure> for the further support of his alms-houses at Tamworth, and putting out apprentices in that town. 
<p>If, as the Apostle has taught us, charity covereth a multitude of sins, is it not but reasonable to believe that this has much more than atoned for the only foible, parsimony, with which Mr. Guy has been charged? 
<p>Having formed his plan, at the age of <num value="76">76</num>, he procured from the governors of St. Thomas's hospital a lease of a spacious piece of their ground, for a term of <num value="999">999</num> years, at a rent of <measure value="30l." type=currency><num value="30">30</num>l.</measure> per annum. It has been said that the reason of his choosing this situation (certainly not a good <num value="1">one</num>, though much improved lately), was an intention of putting it under the care of the governors of St. Thomas's, though he afterwards altered that design.<NOTE><BIBL>Manning and Bray's Surrey, iii. <num value="672">672</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> Having cleared the ground in <datestruct value="1721--"><year reg="1721">1721</year></datestruct>, he laid the <num value="1">first</num> stone of his new building in the year <datestruct value="1722"><year reg="1722">1722</year></datestruct>. He lived to see it covered in, but died <datestruct VALUE="1724-12-27"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg=27>27</day>, <year reg=1724>1724</year></datestruct>, before it was completely finished. His trustees, however, faithfully executed his design, and very soon procured an act of parliament for establishing the foundation according to the directions of his will. By this act it is provided that the <num value="9">nine</num> executors and <num value="51">fifty-one</num> gentlemen nominated by Mr. Guy, should be a corporation, by the name of the president and governors of the hospital, founded at the sole cost and charges of Thomas Guy, esq.; that they should have perpetual succession, a common seal, and power to alter the same at discretion, should possess the testator's estates, and might purchase other estates, not exceeding <measure value="12000l." type=currency><num value="12000">12,000</num>l.</measure> a year, and to sell, lease, or exchange the same as might be convenient; the president and treasurer to continue for life, or till removed by a general court, or till they resign; a committee of <num value="21">twenty-one</num>(<num value="7">seven</num> of which to be annually changed) to have the whole management of the estate; <num value="7">seven</num> or more, with the president and treasurer, to be a court. By this committee, all officers and servants of the hospital (except the physicians, surgeons, clerk, and chaplain, who are to be elected by a general court), are to be elected, patients admitted, and new governors appointed in case of vacancies, so as the whole number never exceed <num value="60">sixty</num>. The transactions and account to be subject to the inspection and control of governors appointed for that purpose. 
<p>The whole expense of erecting and furnishing this hospital, amounted to the sum of <measure value="18793l." type=currency><num value="18793">18,793</num>l.</measure> <measure value="16s." type=currency><num value="16">16</num>s.</measure> great part of which Mr. Guy <pb id="p.468" n="468"> expended in his life-time; and he left <measure value="219499l." type=currency><num value="219499">219,499</num>l.</measure> to endow it; both together amounting to <measure value="238292l." type=currency><num value="238292">238,292</num>l.</measure> <measure value="16s." type=currency><num value="16">16</num>s.</measure>; a much larger sum than was ever left before in this kingdom, by <num value="1">one</num> single person, to charitable purposes. 
<p>This building consists of <num value="2">two</num> quadrangles, beside the <num value="2">two</num> wings that extend from the front to the street. 
<p>The entrance into the building, which was erected from the designs of Mr. Dance, is by an elegant and noble iron gate, supported by stone piers. These gates open into a square, in the centre of which is a brazen statue of the founder, by Mr. Scheemakers, dressed in a livery gown, and well executed. In the front of the pedestal is this inscription:-- 
<QUOTE rend=center>THOMAS GUY, SOLE FOUNDER OF THIS HOSPITAL IN HIS LIFE-TIME. 
<LB>A. D. MDCCXXII.</QUOTE>
 
<p>On the west side of the pedestal is represented, in basso relievo, the parable of the Good Samaritan; on the south side are Mr. Guy's arms, viz. a chevron charged with <num value="3">three</num> fleur de lis, between <num value="3">three</num> tiger's heads crowned; and on that side of the pedestal facing the east, is our Saviour healing the impotent man. 
<p>The centre of the front is of stone, and consists of a rusticated basement, in which are <num value="3">three</num> arched entrances to the quadrangle, and <num value="2">two</num> windows. This supports <num value="2">two</num> pilasters and <num value="4">four</num> Ionic columns, the intercolumniations containing <num value="3">three</num> windows and <num value="2">two</num> niches, in which are emblematic statues. The attic has <num value="5">five</num> windows, and the tympanum is ornamented by an emblematic relief. This front was new faced about the year <datestruct value="1778"><year reg="1778">1778</year></datestruct>, and is, with the statues, the work of the late Mr. Bacon, who was a native of Southwark. 
<p>Passing through the arches is a long colonnade, on each side of which are the wards for the patients, containing above <num value="400">400</num> beds. Iron bedsteads have been introduced as a preservative against vermin. <num value="2">Two</num> of the wards are appropriated to surgical cases, <num value="1">one</num> for accidents; the remainder are filled according to circumstances. The court room is a handsome apartment: over the president's chair is a portrait of the founder by Dahl. He is represented seated in a chair, having a large flowing wig, a long neckcloth, and black gown. On the ceiling of this apartment is his apotheosis. He is represented seated on a cloud, surrounded with emblematic figures, cherubs suspending a coronet over his head. 
<p>The superstructure of this hospital has <num value="3">three</num> floors besides the garrets, and the same construction runs through the whole building, which is so extensive as to contain <num value="12">twelve</num> wards, in which are <num value="435">435</num> beds, exclusive of those that may be placed in the additional part; and the whole is advantageously disposed for the mutual accommodation of the sick, and those who attend them. 
<p>In the chapel, which is plainly fitted up, is a fine figure of Mr. Guy in statuary marble, by the late Mr. Bacon, in <datestruct value="1779--"><year reg="1779">1779</year></datestruct>, which cost <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num>l.</measure> He is represented in his livery-gown standing, and holding <pb id="p.469" n="469"> out <num value="1">one</num> hand to raise an emaciated figure lying on the ground, and pointing with the other to a <num value="2">second</num> on a bier carrying into the hospital. In the back ground is the hospital. There are some small emblematic medallions on the sides of the pedestal, on which is this inscription:-- 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>Underneath are deposited the remains of Thomas Guy, citizen of London, member of parliament, and the sole founder of this hospital in his life-time. It is peculiar to this beneficent man to have persevered, during a long course of prosperity and industry, in pouring forth to the wants of others all that he had earned by labour, or withheld from self-indulgence. Warm with philanthropy, and exalted by charity, his mind expanded to those noble affections which grow but too rarely from the most elevated pursuits. After administering with extensive bounty to the claims of consanguinity, he established this asylum for that stage of languor and disease to which the charity of others had not reached; he provided a retreat for hopeless insanity, and rivalled the endowment of kings. He died the <datestruct VALUE="1724-12-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1724">1724</year></datestruct>, in the <num value="80">80th</num> year of his age.</QUOTE>
 
<p>As soon as this corporation was established by parliament, the governors immediately set about completing the work, by finishing and furnishing the hospital, and taking in patients, the number of whom, at <num value="1">first</num>, amounted to <num value="42">four hundred and two</num>. The officers and servants belonging to this hospital are chosen by the governors, who have, ever since, carried on this noble charity in such manner as to answer, in the strictest degree, the benevolent intentions of the founder. 
<p>The parish had some old houses, for the residence of poor persons, standing on part of the ground where the new houses on the north side of St. Thomas's street have been built, which they gave up to St. Thomas's hospital when they were improving the street and building the good houses standing near Guy's hospital. In exchange for these, the hospital gave them <num value="3">three</num> small houses in Pipe-makers alley, for the residence of poor persons.

By his lease he was restrained from building on the ground under a penalty; but he immediately paid the penalty, and began setting up a multitude of wretched houses, many of which hardly stood to the end of the term. His lease being expired, the city immediately set about removing these heaps of rubbish, and have let their land to respectable persons, who have erected some very handsome streets. 
<div2 type=section id="c.19.1"><HEAD>St. George's Church.</HEAD>
 
<p>The church which formerly stood in this place was of ancient foundation, and pertained to the abbey of Bermondsey, by the gift of <num value="2">two</num> benefactors, Thomas Arderne (father and son), in the year <datestruct value="1122"><year reg="1122">1122</year></datestruct>; having undergone many repairs, and being ruinous, and on account of its great age, the parishioners applied to parliament, and obtained an act<NOTE>Ibid.</NOTE> to have another erected; in consequence of which the present edifice was begun in <datestruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></datestruct>, and completely finished in <datestruct value="1736--"><year reg="1736">1736</year></datestruct>. 
<p>The architect was John Price.

The plan is a parallellogram, with a square tower at the west, and a chancel at the east end, respectively flanked by vestibules or vestries; the basement being occupied by extensive catacombs a superior height is given to the floor of the church. The walls are built with a dark red brick, with stone dressings, in a heavy Dutch style, and the whole building, notwithstanding its size, has a tasteless aspect. The west front is approached by a lofty flight of steps; the elevation is made in breadth into <num value="3">three</num> divisions. The centre is faced with stone, and bounded by <num value="2">two</num> <num value="3">three</num>-quarter columns of the Ionic order; the intercolumniation is occupied by a large arch resting on piers, the keystone carved with a cherubic head; within the arch a lintelled doorway, and over it a half circular window. The side divisions have also lintelled doorways, and over them lofty round-headed windows; the whole is crowned with the entablature of the order; over the centre is an elliptical pediment, and, above the side divisions, a ballustrade. The tower rises from behind the centre of this front; it is entirely built with stone, and commences with a square tower, having a round-headed window in every aspect, and crowned with a cornice, on the angles of which are vases: to this succeeds a <num value="2">second</num> story, the plan an irregular octagon; the <num value="4">four</num> larger faces have dials surmounted by pedimental cornices; this portion serves as a basement to an octagon temple of the Ionic order, having open arches in the <num value="4">four</num> faces, which correspond with the sides of the square tower, and every angle is guarded by an attached column; to this succeeds a low pedestal of the same form, with portholes in every alternate face, and crowned by an octangular obelisk; the latter is pierced with portholes, and finished with a ball and vane. The flanks of the church are uniform; the elevation commences with a plinth of Portland stone, and the upright is made by a string course into <num value="2">two</num> stories; in the lower are <num value="6">six</num> segmental arched windows, enclosed in stone architraves, and on the upper the like number of lofty roundheaded windows, with similar dressings, the dados having stone pannels; the elevation is finished with a cornice, and the angles are rusticated; the <num value="1">first</num> division from the west is divided from the remainder by a succession of rustic quoins, and is crowned with a ballustrade, the remainder of the design with a parapet. The east end has a chancel in the centre, which projects from the main building; in the extreme wall is a Venetian window, the piers of which are square, with capitals of the Ionic order; above the <pb id="p.472" n="472"> window is a shield, and the elevation is finished with a pediment; the angles between the chancel and the church on each side are occupied by vestibules; these appendages are uniform; the elevation is made into <num value="2">two</num> stories; in the eastern front is a lintelled doorway, with a window above, and in the flanks a window alone; the upright of the walls is finished with a fascia. The southern vestibule forms a porch to the church, and contains the staircase to the gallery on that side; the opposite <num value="1">one</num> is a vestry. The interior is very plain and naked; the ceiling is perfectly horizontal without relief, its face is painted in distemper to imitate the handsome pannelling with which the churches of Wren's building are enriched; in the centre are <num value="2">two</num> concentric circles, the smaller containing an expanded flower, the larger, whose periphery is a wreath of flowers, is inscribed in a square; the angles are filled with chaplets: <num value="2">two</num> other long pannels are added to complete the length of the building; they are divided into minor pannels filled with scrolls of foliage: the whole is encircled with a tolerable imitation of a block cornice. The chancel is separated from the church by an arch, the key-stone carved with a shield, inscribed with the monagram I. H. S.; it springs from square piers with moulded caps, surmounted by architraves and cornices, all of which are painted to imitate yellow marble, and the shafts of the piers are made to appear to be fluted; the cornice alone is applied as a finish to the walls of the chancel; the ceiling is a semicircular vault, to which the cornice acts as an impost; the soffite has <num value="3">three</num> pannels; the centre painted with the Hebrew name of the Deity in an irradiation, and the side ones with angels; the side walls of the chancel are pannelled, and below the east window are the usual inscriptions. The floor of the chancel is elevated on <num value="2">two</num> steps. So far has the love of painting been extended, that a monument in marble has been imitated on the north wall of the chancel. On the opposite side is a counterpart in marble. A gallery crosses the west end of the building; the front is pannelled and rests on fluted Ionic pillars of oak. A continuation of the gallery occupies each side; it is sustained on square pilasters of oak, to each of which, on the side facing the area of the church, is attached a console serving as a bracket to support the gallery fronts. The organ stands in the centre of the western gallery, and on each side of it are additional galleries for the charity children. The pulpit and desks are situated in <num value="1">one</num> group in the centre of the church at a short distance from the altar rails; the former is sustained on <num value="4">four</num> Ionic columns surmounted by their entablature; it is an irregular octagon, and at the smaller sides are fluted columns; the whole is executed in oak and has no sounding board. The font is situated in the south-west angle of the church; it is a circular basin of white marble on a pillar of the same form, and is chastely ornamented. The basement story of the tower forms a porch to the church, and the northern attached vestibule contains a staircase to <pb id="p.473" n="473"> the gallery on that side of the church; the opposite vestibule is a vestry room. 
<p>There are several monuments in this church to private individuals, among the most conspicuous are <num value="2">two</num> in the south gallery. The <num value="1">first</num> is a handsome slab of veined marble to William Toulmin, esq. a magistrate and deputy lieutenant of the county of Surrey. He died <datestruct VALUE="1826-03-14"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg=14>14</day>, <year reg=1826>1826</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="71">71</num>.

<p>In the old church was contained the unhallowed remains of the cruel bishop Bonner, who had for many years been confined in the Marshalsea, where he died miserably, unpitied, and unlamented. Here also was interred John Rushworth, the author of Historical Collections, relating to proceedings in parliament, from <datestruct value="1618--"><year reg="1618">1618</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1640--"><year reg="1640">1640</year></datestruct>. 
<p>Opposite St. George's church formerly stood the magnificent mansion built by Charles Brandon, duke of Suffolk, in the reign of Henry the <num value="8">eighth</num>, called 
<div2 type=section id="c.19.2"><HEAD>Suffolk House.</HEAD>
 
<p>This house was also called, while it was in the duke's possession, the Duke's Place; which place he exchanged with the said king Henry the <num value="8">eighth</num>; and the king, in return, gave him the bishop of Norwich's house in St. Martin's-in-the-fields; on this exchange, which was enacted the <num value="28">twenty-eighth</num> of Henry the <num value="8">eighth</num>,<NOTE><BIBL>Stow.</BIBL></NOTE> it took the name of Southwark-palace, and a Mint was established here for the king's use; whence its present name. 
<p>Edward the <num value="6">sixth</num>, in the <num value="2">second</num> year of his reign, came from Hampton court, and dined in this house, where he knighted John Yorke, <num value="1">one</num> of the sheriffs of London, and returned through the city to Westminster. 
<p>Mary I. gave the mansion to Nicholas Heth, archbishop of York, and to his successors for ever, to be their inn or lodging for their repair to London, as a recompense for York house, near Westminster, which king Henry, her father, had taken from cardinal Wolsey, and the see of York. 
<p>Archbishop Heth sold the premises, and the purchasers pulled it down, sold the lead, stone, iron, &amp;c. and built on the site many small cottages, on which they imposed great rents,  <QUOTE>to the increasing of beggars in that borough.</QUOTE>  The archbishop bought Norwich house above mentioned, on account of its vicinity to the court, and left it to his successors. The purchasers are said to have pulled part of it down; but it <pb id="p.474" n="474"> seems so much was left that Edward Bromfield, esq. lord mayor in <datestruct value="1637--"><year reg="1637">1637</year></datestruct>, made it his residence. He was owner in <datestruct value="1650--"><year reg="1650">1650</year></datestruct>.

This estate devolving to the Lant family, we find that in the <num value="7">7th</num> of queen Anne, an act was passed for the improvement of Suffolk-place, empowering Thomas Lant to let leases for <num value="51">fifty-one</num> years. In <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct> it was advertised to be let, as <num value="17">seventeen</num> aeres, on which were <num value="400">400</num> houses, rental <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num>l.</measure> per annum.

<p>The Mint continued for many years an asylum for debtors and fraudulent persons, who took refuge here with their effects, and set their creditors at defiance, but this and similar privileges were entirely suppressed by parliament in the reign of George I. 
<p>The inhabitants of Whitefriars, Savoy, Salisbury-court, Ramalley, Mitre-court, Fullwood's Rents, Baldwin's-gardens, Montague-close, the Minories, Clink, and Deadman's-place, assumed to themselves a privilege of protection from arrests for debt; against whom a severe, though just statute was made, <num value="8">8</num> and <num value="9">9</num> William III. chap. <num value="27">27</num>,  <QUOTE>whereby any person having monies owing from any in these pretended privileged places, may, upon a legal process taken out, require the sheriffs of London and Middlesex, the head bailiff of the duchy, liberty, or the high sheriff of Surrey, or bailiff of Southwark, or their deputies, to take a <foreign lang=la>posse comitatis</foreign>, and arrest such persons, or take their goods upon execution or extent, and the sheriffs or officers neglecting, to forfeit to the plaintiff <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">100</num>l.</measure>, and every person opposing them, to forfeit <measure value="50l." type=currency><num value="50">50</num>l.</measure> and to be sent to gaol till the next assize, and to suffer such imprisonment, and be set in the pillory, as the court shall think fit; and any person rescuing or aiding therein, forfeits to the plaintiff <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">500</num>l.</measure> and upon non-payment of the forfeitures, the person neglecting, to be transported to some of the plantations for <num value="7">seven</num> years; and returning again within that time to be guilty of felony, without benefit of clergy, and persons harbouring those that have made such rescues, shall be transported as aforesaid, unless they pay the plaintiff the whole debt and costs.</QUOTE>  Yet this place pretends to as much privilege as before, though this act has suppressed all the other places; and these streets are reckoned within the compass of this Mint, viz. Mint-street, Crooked-lane there, Bell's-rents, Exchange-alley, Cheapside, and Lombard-street there; also Cannon-street, Suffolk-street, St. George-street, Queen-street, King-street, Peter-street, Harrow-alley, Anchor-alley, and Duke-street, all in the parish of St. George, Southwark. 
<p>The Mint is at present <num value="1">one</num> of the most filthy and inconvenient districts in the Borough. 
<p>Kent-street is perhaps <num value="1">one</num> of the most dirty avenues in the <pb id="p.475" n="475"> neighbourhood of London, though formerly the principal entrance to the metropolis from Kent and the continent. Through this street came the triumphant Henry the <num value="5">Fifth</num> on his return from France, after his splendid victory of Agincourt. Near the south end, on the west side, was 
<div2 type=section id="c.19.3"><HEAD>The Lock Hospital.</HEAD>
 
<p>This hospital, situated without St. George's bars, in Kent-street, called the Loke, was a lazar house, or hospital for leprous persons, dedicated to the Virgin, and to St. Leonard. The period of its <num value="1">first</num> foundation is not discoverable; yet there is reason to conclude it had existed long anterior to the reign of Edward II., inasmuch as in the <num value="14">fourteenth</num> year of that king there is extant on the patent roll, a writ of protection, not very unlike the briefs of the present date, at which time the revenues of the hospital were insufficient for its support. In this writ, after reciting that the master and brethren of the hospital of the blessed Mary and of St. Leonard for lepers, without Southwark, had not wherewith to support themselves, unless other relief were afforded them by the faithful and devout; and in order to prevent their being oppressed by injuries, and for their more quietly serving God, the king granted his protection for <num value="2">two</num> years, prohibiting all persons, during that period, from doing them any wrong, molestation or damage; and, further, beseeching all his loving subjects (as they should look for favour from God, and thanks from the king) piously and mercifully to aid the said master and brethren by charitable donations, whenever they should ask alms at their hands. 
<p>Strype's Stow, vol. ii. p. <num value="20">20</num>, edit. <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, states, that &lsquo;ohn Pope, by his will, dated <datestruct value="1437--"><year reg="1437">1437</year></datestruct>, gave to the governors of the house of the poor leprous, called Le Lokes, without St. George's bar, in Southwark, <num value="1">one</num> annual rent of <measure value="6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure> sterling, <foreign lang=la>de illis tresdecim solidatis et <num value="4">4</num> denariis</foreign>, of rent due to him, and that descended to him by hereditary right, by the death of Thomas Pope, of Sherman, his father, out of the tenements and shops formerly belonging to sir John Champeneys, in Shetebone (Sherebourn) lane, in the parish of St. Mary, Abchurch, which was situated in length between the garden of Thomas St. Edmond, on the west, and the little lane towards the said church on the east, and extend in breadth to the tenements of John de Herford, and John Joy, and the garden of the said Thomas St. Edmond on the west, unto Shetebone-lane, towards the north, &amp;c. to the reparation and maintenance of the said house of lepers for ever. Those foresaid tenements of the said John Champeneys belonged to the master, brethren, and sisters of the hospital of St. Catherine, near the Tower. 
<p>Over the chapel was fixed a stone, of which Aubrey, in his History of Surrey, vol. v. p. <num value="10">10</num>, gives the following description:

<p>This M. B. is said to be designed for M. Bond, a rich citizen of London, who gave <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">one hundred</num> pounds</measure> towards the building of this chapel. 
<p>This building was removed to make way for the New Road from St. George's church to the Bricklayers'-arms. Near this is a small burying ground belonging to the parish. 
<p>In the Kent road is 
<div2 type=section id="c.19.4"><HEAD>The Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb.</HEAD>
 
<p>This is a truly interesting charity. Its youthful inmates, who had otherwise remained dumb and ignorant as the beasts of the field, are, by its means, taught to make themselves understood, and with readiness to understand others; to read, write, cast accounts, &amp;c., and to become moral and religious characters. They are besides instructed in various mechanical arts, by which, in future life, they may obtain their own subsistence. Examples of their skill in these arts are exhibited at the annual dinner, and may be witnessed by any person visiting the establishment. This institution commenced about <datestruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></datestruct>, but the present building was erected in <datestruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>, and enlarged in <datestruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></datestruct>, so as to accommodate <datestruct value="200"><year reg="200">200</year></datestruct> children. 
<p>At the extent of the bounds of the borough, down the Kent road, is a small brook called St. Thomas-a-Watering. Here the corporation of London generally waited to receive any procession coming to London from France and the continent, and is another proof, if any be required, of the right of the corporation over and within the borough of Southwark. 
<p>At the south-west corner of Blackman-street, in the road to the Obelisk, St. George's Fields, is situated the 
<div2 type=section id="c.19.5"><HEAD>King's Bench Prison,</HEAD>
 
<p>A place of confinement for debtors, and for every <num value="1">one</num> sentenced by the court of King's Bench to suffer imprisonment: but those who can purchase the liberties have the benefit of walking through Blackman-street, and a part of the borough, and in St. George's fields. 
<p>Stow informs us, that <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>the courts of King's Bench and Chancery have oftentimes been removed to other places; and so have likewise the gaols that serve those courts, as in the year<datestruct value="1304"><year reg="1304">1304</year></datestruct>, Edward I. commanded the courts of the King's Bench and the Exchequer, which had remained <num value="7">seven</num> years at York, to be removed to their old piece, at London. And in the year <datestruct value="1387"><year reg="1387">1387</year></datestruct>, the <num value="11">eleventh</num> of Richard II. Robert Tresilian, chief justice, came to the city <pb id="p.477" n="477"> of Coventry, and there sat the space of a month as justice of King's Bench, and caused to be indicted in that court about the number of <num value="2000">two thousand</num> persons of that country, &amp;c. 
<p>It seemeth, therefore, that for that time, the prison or gaol of that court was not far off. Also in the year <datestruct value="1392"><year reg="1392">1392</year></datestruct>, the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> of the same Richard, the archbishop of York being lord chancellor, for good will that he bare to his city, caused the King's Bench and Chancery to be removed from London to York. But before long they were returned to London. 
<p>The prisoners in this prison of the King's Bench were formerly not only restrained by their liberty, but were further punished by reason of the streightness of room, there being more about the middle of queen Elizabeth's reign committed there than before, as well for debt, trespass, as other causes; by reason of which streightening and pestering <num value="1">one</num> another, great annoyances and inconveniences grew among the prisoners, that occasioned the death of many; so that within <num value="6">six</num> years last past (it was now about the year <datestruct value="1579"><year reg="1579">1579</year></datestruct>) very near a <num value="100">hundred</num> persons died; and between Michaelmas and March, about a dozen persons, besides others that had been extremely sick and hardly recovered; and some remained still sick, and in danger of their lives, through a certain contagion, called  <Q>the sickness of the house,</Q>  which many times happened among them, ingendering chiefly, or rather only, of the small or few rooms, in respect of the many persons abiding in them; and there, by want of air, breathing in <num value="1">one</num> another's face as they lay, which could not but breed infection, especially when any infectious person was removed from other prisons thither. And many times it so happened, namely, in the summer season, that through want of air, and to avoid smothering, they were forced in the night time to cry out to the marshal's servants, to raise and open the doors of the ward, whereby to take air in the yard for their refreshing. Whereupon these prisoners, about <datestruct VALUE="1579-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1579">1579</year></datestruct>, put up a petition to the lords of the queen's privy council,  <Q>setting forth all this their lamentable condition; and beseeched them to take some order for the enlarging of the said rooms, for the preservation of their lives that then remained there, as of others that should fortune to be committed thither; and also for building some chapel, or place of common prayer, they being driven to use for that purpose a certain room, through which was a continual recourse. And that they would the rather be moved thereunto, in that the same house or lands were the queen's inheritance, and the marshal there answerable to her highness for a yearly rent therefore, and also being her highnesses principal gaol.</Q>  
<p>For seconding this petition sir Owen Hopton, knight, lieutenant of the Tower, Fleetwood, the recorder, and several aldermen and justices of the peace, sent their letter to the lords testifying the truth of the above said complaint; and moreover assuring their honours that there was not <num value="1">one</num> convenient or several room in the <pb id="p.478" n="478"> whole house wherein they might sit for executing the queen's majesty's commission; but were forced to use a little low room, or parlour, adjoining to the street, where the prisoners daily dined and supped; so that were it not for the discharging their duties that way, and some tender remorse towards the help of some prisoners' hard cases, they could be contented to tarry from thence, as well as some other of their colleagues did for the inconveniency aforesaid.</QUOTE>
 
<p>The prison occupies an extensive area of ground; it consists of <num value="1">one</num> large pile of building, about <num value="120">120</num> yards long. The south, or principal front, has a pediment; under which is the chapel. There are <num value="4">four</num> pumps of spring and river water. Here are <num value="224">224</num> rooms, or apartments, <num value="8">eight</num> of which are called state-rooms, which are much larger than the others. 
<p>Within the walls are a coffee-house and <num value="2">two</num> public-houses; and the shops and stalls for meat, vegetables, and necessaries of almost every description, give the place the appearance of a public market; while the numbers of people walking about, or engaged in various amusements, are little calculated to impress the stranger with an idea of distress, or even of confinement. 
<p>The walls surrounding the prison are about <num value="30">30</num> feet high, and are surmounted by <foreign lang=fr>chevaux de frize</foreign>; but the liberties, or rules, as they are called, comprehend all St. George's-fields, <num value="1">one</num> side of Blackman-street, and part of the Borough High-street, forming an area of about <num value="3">three</num> miles in circumference. These rules are usually purchasable after the following rate, by the prisoners: <num value="5">five</num> guineas for small debts; <num value="8">eight</num> guineas for the <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">first hundred</num> pounds</measure> of debt, and about half that sum for every subsequent <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">hundred</num> pounds</measure>. Dayrules, of which <num value="3">three</num> may be obtained in every term, may also be purchased for <measure value="4s. 2d." type=Currency><num value="4">4</num>s. <num value="2">2</num>d.</measure> the <num value="1">first</num> day, and <measure value="3s. 10d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="10">10</num>d.</measure> for the others. Each description of purchasers must give good security to the governor, or, as he is called, marshal. Those who buy the <num value="1">first</num> mentioned may take up their residence any where within the precincts described; but the day rules only authorize the prisoner to go out on those days for which they are bought. These privileges render the King's Bench the most desirable (if such a word may be thus applied) place of incarceration for debtors, in England; and hence persons so situated frequently remove themselves to it by <foreign lang=la>habeas corpus</foreign> from the most distant prisons in the kingdom. A strict attention to the rules is very seldom enforced: a fact so notorious, that when the late lord Ellenborough, as chief justice of the King's Bench, was applied to for an extension of the rules, his lordship very gravely replied, that he really could perceive no grounds for the application, since to his certain knowledge, the rules already extended to the East Indies! In cases of this kind, however, when discovery takes place, the marshal becomes answerable for the escape of the debtor. 
<div2 type=section id="c.19.6"><HEAD>St. George's Fields.</HEAD>
 
<p>This tract was anciently a broad portion of marsh land, till the <pb id="p.479" n="479"> embankment of the river Thames rendered it tenable. That it was known by the Romans is sufficiently authenticated by the remains of tesselated pavements, coins, bones, &amp;c. and it might have been used as an <foreign lang=la>aestiva</foreign>, or summer camp; for it could not have been any other, the situation having been too damp for a residentiary station; for, even till the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century, Lambeth-marsh was overflowed.

<p>These fields, however, have borne their share of celebrity in the annals of this country; they were very often the scenes of grandeur and cavalcade, and sometimes the rendezvous of rebellion and discord. It was to this place that Wat Tyler's and Jack Cade's rebels resorted to oppose the royal authority; and it was here that the former retired after the arrest of their leader in Smithfield, and were compelled to yield to the allegiance they had violated. Here also the infatuated mob commenced the riots of <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, which threatened the existence of the metropolis, had they not been speedily quelled. 
<p>These fields now form different roads; and from St. George's circus open communications with all the south and south-east counties, and the continent. 
<p>In the centre is an obelisk.

<p>The bill, ordered in consequence of this petition, passed into an act, of which the following are the heads: 
<p>The preamble <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>recites the acts of <num value="29">29</num> Geo. II. and <num value="7">7</num> Geo.

<p>It is likewise hereby lawful for them to raise such roads to any height, making satisfaction; and to arch over, or fill up ditches, water-courses, sewers, pools, and ponds, but so as not to obstruct the course of Pudding-mill stream: they may also erect drains and sewers in and through such ditches, &amp;c. and purchase houses, lands, &amp;c. for the purposes aforesaid; and the said power of purchasing is limited to <num value="10">ten</num> years. 
<p>Bodies politic, corporate, &amp;c. trustees, and other persons, are impowered to sell and convey; and in case of refusal or inability to treat, the justices of Surrey are to issue a precept to the sheriff of Surrey to summon a jury; which jury is to be drawn according to the act of <num value="3">3</num> Geo. <num value="11">11</num>. and the jurors may be challenged: and the said justices are hereby impowered to summon and examine witnesses, and direct views. The jury is to assess the value, and the justices to give final judgment. Previous notice is to be given to the parties interested; and, on payment of the value assessed, the premises are to be conveyed to the city. 
<p>Where a good title cannot be made, or legal conveyance executed, or parties found, the justices are to order the purchase money to be paid into the Bank; subject to the order of the court of Chancery, on motion or petition. Verdicts and judgments are to be entered among the records of the quarter sessions of Surrey. Copies are good evidence. On payment into the Bank, the premises are to vest in the city. Justices, on petition, may invest the money in the public funds. If the money is not tendered, verdicts and judgments are not binding. Purchase-monies of trust estate are to be re-invested in other purchases, to the same uses. Conveyance by femmes covert inrolled are to be effectual; and so all other bargains and sales. Persons not entering their claims within a limited time are to be barred, but at liberty to recover the purchase-money from persons receiving the same. After purchase, tenants are to deliver possession within <num value="6">six</num> months; and, on refusal, justices are to issue a precept to the sheriff to deliver possession. Mortgagees, on tender of principal and interest, are to convey; but on refusal interest is to cease, on payment of principal and interest into the Bank; and upon such payment the premises are to vest in the city. The monies are to be paid or tendered, before any use is made of the premises. The justices are impowered to fine the sheriff, jurors, and witnesses, not doing their duty. The crown is also impowered to alienate its lands, and stocks are to be purchased for answering any stipends. 
<p>The tolls on London and Blackfriars bridge continued by act <num value="7">7</num> Geo.

No buildings are to be erected within <num value="10">ten</num> feet of the said roads.

<p>In <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, another act was passed for the further improvement of St. George's-fields, enabling the city to sell some detached pieces of their lands, mentioned in a schedule annexed to the act, and to invest the purchase money, and a further sum of <measure value="20000l." type=currency><num value="20000">20,000</num>l.</measure> in the purchase of other land there, so as to make their premises more compact. 
<p>Of the benevolent institutions with which the metropolis and its neighbourhood abounds, many are placed in St. George's-fields, a situation chosen not only for the facility it affords to the visits of the medical gentlemen and the governors, but from the circumstance of ground being obtained on reasonable terms, and not too much encumbered with buildings at the time when most of them were established. 
<p>On the south side of St. George's circus are the extensive range of buildings, called 
<div2 type=section id="c.19.7"><HEAD>The School for the Indigent Blind.</HEAD>
 
<p>This excellent institution, adapted from the plan of <num value="1">one</num> at Liverpool, was founded in <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>, and was opened on a small scale in the premises belonging to the Dog and Duck, a place of entertainment in the latter part of the last century, which was suppressed by the magistracy. It was soon found necessary to obtain larger premises, and the city of London being willing to grant a lease of about <pb id="p.483" n="483"> <num value="2">two</num> acres of their land, the offer was accepted, and the present edifice erected in a short space of time. The front is neatly stuccoed, and the interior well fitted up. 
<p>In this interesting institution, the most humane attention is paid to a number of persons from the age of <num value="12">twelve</num>, and upwards, under the unhappy circumstances of blindness and poverty. They manufacture baskets, clothes' lines, sash cords, and various other articles, which are sold at the school, where strangers are permitted (gratis) to view the progress of the pupils, and to examine the nature of the institution. The profit of the articles here manufactured for sale, in aid of the funds of the establishment, is said to amount annually to from <measure value="800l." type=currency><num value="800">800</num>l.</measure> to <measure value="1008l." type=currency><num value="1008">1,008</num>l.</measure> There are about <num value="60">sixty</num> inmates of both sexes.

<div2 type=section id="c.19.8"><HEAD>The Philanthropic Society.</HEAD>
 
<p>This institution was commenced in <datestruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct>, upon a plan suggested by Mr. Robert Young, and patronized by the duke of Leeds, and many other noble personages. It was formed for the prevention of crime, and the reform of criminal poor, by encouragement of industry, and the culture of good morals among those children who were training up to vicious courses and public plunder, the offspring of convicted felons, &amp;c. The society <num value="1">first</num> opened a house at Cambridge-heath, Hackney, but soon afterwards removed to St. George's fields, the city having granted a lease of a piece of ground, on which spacious and commodious buildings were immediately erected. The advantage of opening a chapel for performance of divine service had been so fully proved in the case of other charitable foundations, that in <datestruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></datestruct> the governors built <num value="1">one</num>; but here an opposition arose, which had nearly overset the plan, and that from a quarter from which it was least to be expected; Mr. Brand, the then rector of St. 
<p>George's parish, insisted on having the appointment of the chaplain. 
<p>It is well known that however respectable the character of a clergyman may he, if he has not the talent of addressing a large audience in an impressive manner, his discourse would not answer the purpose of such an institution as this: the governors therefore thought it necessary that they should have the nomination. They were encouraged to apply to parliament for an incorporation, and in the proposed act was a clause empowering them to appoint the chaplain, <num value="1">first</num> giving notice to the rector. The rector opposed the bill to the utmost of his power; and after it had passed the commons, he contended against it in the house of lords; and so indefatigable was he, that at last it was carried by a majority of <num value="1">one</num> vote only. By this means the opening of the chapel was delayed for <num value="15">fifteen</num> months, to the loss of nearly <measure value="2000l." type=currency><num value="2000">2,000</num>l.</measure> to the charity, besides the expense occasioned by the contest. It was at length opened in <datestruct VALUE="1806-11--"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct>.

<p>In this institution upwards of <num value="200">200</num> children are rescued from prison, the retreat of villainy, or the haunts of prostitution. 
<p>For the employment of the boys (who are appropriately classed), buildings are erected, in which, under the direction of master workmen, various trades are carried on for the society's benefit; while the girls are instructed to work at their needle, and in those household offices which may render them serviceable to the community, and enable them to obtain an honest livelihood.

<div2 type=section id="c.19.10"><HEAD>Bethlem Hospital.</HEAD>
 
<p>On the old building in Moorfields being found in such a decayed state as to require re-building, and, after much investigation as to the propriety of reinstating it in its then situation, or of choosing new spot, the latter was determined on; and a part of the Bridgehouse estate in St. George's-fields was selected for the purpose. The city of London in <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct> obtained an act of parliament enabling them to grant <num value="11">eleven</num> acres and <num value="3">three</num> roods in the parish of St. George the martyr (abutting north on the turnpike-road from. Lambeth to Newington, and south on a sewer at the north end of land occupied with the houses in Brook-street, and on the turnpike-road from Westminster-bridge to Vauxhall), to the governors of Bethlem hospital, to build a new <num value="1">one</num> instead of that used at present, for <num value="895">895</num> <pb id="p.485" n="485"> years. On April <num value="181812">18,1812</num>, the lord mayor laid the <num value="1">first</num> stone of the new hospital. On the site of part of this ground was the Dog and Duck public-house, kept by <num value="1">one</num> Hedger, who built the number of small houses previously noticed, and whose conduct while in possession of the Dog and Duck was such that the magistrates very properly closed the gardens and house; it was afterwards occupied by the blind school, but was entirely pulled down in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct> to make way for the new hospital. 
<p>The buildings occupy a considerable space, the principal <num value="1">one</num> shews a front <num value="569">569</num> feet in extent, which consists of a centre and <num value="2">two</num> wings: the former has a portico, raised on a flight of steps, and composed of <num value="6">six</num> columns of the Ionic order, surmounted by their entablature and a pediment, in the tympanum of which is a relief of the royal arms; the height to the apex <num value="60">60</num> feet. The whole is surmounted by an attic, above which rises (rather oddly) another attic, which is crowned with a poverty-struck cupola. The remainder of the central portion of the building is occupied by apartments of the officers of the establishment. The wings are in <num value="3">three</num> stories, besides a rusticated basement, which shew uniformly grated windows: the whole building is unworthy of the advanced state of the arts in the present century, and may be characterized as a huge unsightly pile of brick and mortar, the ugliness of which is increased by the obtrusive display of its vast front; and if the spectator were disposed to silence the dismal ideas which arise in beholding a structure like the present, the designer seems to have determined to prevent him. Behind the principal pile of building are <num value="2">two</num> detached buildings for criminal lunatics; and at the back of the whole are airing grounds for male and female lunatics and convalescent patients; there is no chapel attached to the hospital. The hall contains the statues, by Cibber, formerly on the gates of the old hospital, which were repaired by Bacon in <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>.<NOTE><BIBL>Vide vol iii. p. <num value="414">414</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> Virtue has preserved an anecdote that <num value="1">one</num> of them was copied from Oliver Cromwell's gigantic porter, who became insane.<NOTE><BIBL>Britton and Pugin's Public Buildings of London, vol. i. p. <num value="301">301</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> The basement floor of the hospital is appropriated to dangerous, noisy, and uncleanly patients, who are not allowed sheets, but sleep on straw; and to this portion is attached <num value="2">two</num> keepers.

The basement gallery is paved with stone, and its ceiling arched with brick work; the upper galleries are floored with wood, and the ceiling plated with iron. Great attention has been paid to the ventilation of the edifice, and in cold weather the galleries are warmed by Howden's patent air stoves, <num value="1">one</num> in each wing in every floor; but as the heat diminishes gradually in the upper gallery, there are additional fires in the dining and keeper's room of that story. 
<p>The present building was commenced in <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, from the designs <pb id="p.486" n="486"> and under the direction of James Lewis, esq. architect.

<p>This noble institution was <num value="1">first</num> projected by Mr. Robert Dingly, in the year <datestruct value="1758"><year reg="1758">1758</year></datestruct>, for the reception of penitent prostitutes. It was at <num value="1">first</num> kept in a large house, formerly the London Infirmary, in Prescot-street, Goodman's-fields, and was called the Magdalen Hospital. The utility of this charity was so conspicuous, and so well supported, that the views of the benefactors extended to the building an edifice more enlarged and convenient for the purpose; in consequence of which the spot on which the present edifice stands was made choice of; and on the <datestruct VALUE="-07-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></datestruct>, in the year <datestruct value="1769"><year reg="1769">1769</year></datestruct>, the earl of Hertford, president, with the vice-president and governors, laid the <num value="1">first</num> stone at the altar of the chapel, under which was placed a brass plate, with the following inscription::

<p>This hospital consists of <num value="4">four</num> brick buildings, which inclose a quadrangle, with a basin in the centre. The chapel is an octangular edifice erected at <num value="1">one</num> of the back corners; and, to give the inclosed court an uniformity, a building of a similar front is placed at the opposite corner. 
<p>The unhappy women, for whose benefit this hospital was erected, are received by petition; and there is a distinction in the wards according to the education or behaviour of the persons admitted: the inferior wards consisting of meaner persons, and of those degraded for their misbehaviour. Each person is employed in such kind of work as is suitable to her abilities, and has such part of the benefits arising from her industry as the committee think proper. The articles of their employment are, making their own cloaths, both linen and woollen; knitting and spinning; making lace, artificial flowers, and children's toys; winding silk, drawing patterns, making women and children's shoes, mantuas, stays, coats, &amp;c.; but no part of their labour is to be sold in the house, but at such place as the committee shall think proper to appoint. In their work, as in every other circumstance, the utmost care and tenderness are observed, that this establishment may not be thought a house of correction, or even of hard labour, but a safe retreat from wretched circumstances. 
<p>A probationary ward is instituted for the young women on their admission, and a separation of those of different descriptions and qualifications is established. Each class is entrusted to its particular assistant, and the whole is under the inspection of a matron. This separation, useful on many accounts, is peculiarly so to a numerous class of women, who are much to be pitied, and to whom this charity has been very beneficial; viz.  <QUOTE>young women who have been seduced from their friends under promise of marriage, and have been deserted by their seducers.</QUOTE>  They have never been in public prostitution, but fly to the Magdalen to avoid it. Their relations, in the <num value="1">first</num> moments of resentment, refuse to receive, protect, or <pb id="p.488" n="488"> acknowledge them; they are abandoned by the world, without character, without friends, without money, without resource; and wretched, indeed, is their situation! To such especially this house of refuge opens wide its doors; and, instead of being driven by despair to lay violent hands on themselves, and to super add the crime of self-murder to that guilt which is the cause of their distress, or of being forced by the strong call of hunger into prostitution, they find a safe and quiet retreat in this abode of peace and reflection. 
<p>The method of proceeding for the admission of women into this hospital is as follows: the <num value="1">first</num> Thursday in every month is an admission day; when, sometimes from <num value="20">twenty</num> to <num value="30">thirty</num> petitioners appear, who, without any recommendation whatever, on applying at the door to the clerk, receive a printed form of petition, gratis, which is properly filled up. Each petition is numbered, and a corresponding number is given to the petitioner herself. They are called in singly before the board, and such questions are put to them as may enable the committee to judge of the sincerity of their professions, and to ascertain the truth of their assertions. 
<p>The treatment of the women is of the gentlest kind. They are instructed in the principles of the Christian religion, in reading, and in several kinds of work, and the various branches of household employment, to qualify them for service or other situations wherein they may honestly earn their living. The chaplain attends them daily to promote and encourage their good resolutions, and to exhort them to religion and virtue. 
<p>The time they remain in the house varies, according to circumstances. The greatest pains are taken to find out their relations and friends, to bring about a reconciliation with them, and if they be people of character, to put them under their protection; if, however, the young women are destitute of such friends, they are retained in the house till an opportunity offers of placing them in a reputable service, or of procuring them the means of obtaining an honest livelihood. No young woman, who has behaved well during her stay in the house, is discharged unprovided for. When discharged, they are for the most part under <num value="20">twenty</num> years of age. 
<p>After the continuance of any woman in the house <num value="3">three</num> years, upon the modest and virtuous demeanor and industrious conduct of such woman, or upon application of her parents or friends, or any housekeeper of sufficient credit, if such friends declare they will forgive her past offences, and will provide for her; or if such housekeeper will receive such woman as a servant; in either of these cases the governors discharge them with a discretionary bounty. 
<p>Every woman placed in service from this house, who shall continue <num value="1">one</num> whole year in such service, to the entire approbation of her master and mistress, on its being made appear to the satisfaction of the committee, they give the woman a gratuity as a reward for her past, and an encouragement for her future good conduct. <pb id="p.489" n="489"> 
<p>In short, such is the establishment of this excellent charity, that nothing is omitted that can promote the great ends of preserving life, of rendering that life useful, and of making valuable members of those who would otherwise have been lost to themselves and to the world. 
<p>At the south end of Blackfriar's road, and on the west side, near St. George's-circus, is a well known place of entertainment, called 
<div2 type=section id="c.19.13"><HEAD>The Surrey Theatre.</HEAD>
 
<p>This theatre was originally built in the year <datestruct value="1782"><year reg="1782">1782</year></datestruct>, for the display of equestrian and dramatic entertainments, on a plan similar to what Astley was then pursuing near Westminster-bridge; but it was intended that they should be conducted with greater elegance and with superior attractions. Mr. Charles Dibdin the elder, that  <QUOTE>never-to-be-forgotten</QUOTE>  song writer and musical composer, devised the scheme for the new establishment; and, in conjunction with Mr. Davis, a surgeon of Bury-street, St. James's, Messrs. Grant of Piccadilly, and Mr. Harborne, of Amen-corner, solicitor, they commenced by taking a lease of a plot of ground in St. George's fields, from the late colonel West, of Charlotte-street, Rathbone-place; who, when made acquainted with the scheme, being himself a musical amateur, was admitted as a joint speculator. The new building was begun in February in the above year, and was opened in the November following, under the title of the  <QUOTE>Royal Circus and Equestrian Philharmonic Academy.</QUOTE>  The performances were entirely by children; but through the house not being licensed, in the midst of success they were obliged to close it. On the <datestruct VALUE="1783-03-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1783">1783</year></datestruct>, the Circus was re-opened, in the full expectation of obtaining a license from the Surrey magistrates at the next general quarter sessions, and <num value="1">one</num> was accordingly granted. The proprietors now looked forward for ample remuneration (having expended above <measure value="15000l." type=currency><num value="15000">15,000</num>l.</measure> on the house), when colonel West died, and the whole concern was in a little time thrown into a state of almost inextricable embarrassment. The management was now thrown upon Grimaldi, a Portuguese, and grandfather to the present clown of Covent-garden theatre. 
<p>The season of <datestruct value="1784--"><year reg="1784">1784</year></datestruct> was not productive; and the shares having changed possessors, Delpini, the celebrated <hi rend=italics>buffo</hi>, was appointed manager in <datestruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></datestruct>. He produced a splendid spectacle towards the end of the season, with a real stag-hunt, &amp;c. but  <QUOTE>the tide of misfortune had set with such a rapid stream, that it was not to be stemmed;</QUOTE>  and the proprietors, chagrined by their losses, deserted their property in succession; till at length, lady West, as grand landlady, put an execution in the house for arrears due, and thus became, by due course of law, possessor of the entire concern. 
<p>Afterwards, G. A. Steevens delivered his celebrated lecture on heads, and many pantomimic and local pieces were performed with indifferent success; among the latter may be noticed the <pb id="p.490" n="490">

His efforts were, however, checked in <datestruct VALUE="1805-08--"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>, when the edifice was totally destroyed by conflagration.

It was next tenanted by Messrs. Dunn, Heywood, and Branscomb, by whom the ride (which had been closed by Elliston) was re-opened, and equestrian performances again introduced. But this failed, and the house was tenanted successively by Mr. T. Dibdin, who lost <num value="17000">17,000</num>l, Mr. Watkins Burroughs; Mr. James Amherst, who took the house at a monthly rent of <measure value="180l." type=currency><num value="180">180</num>l.</measure>; Mr. Williams; and Mr. Honeyman, the proprietor of the Surrey coffee-house, who retained it till the latter end of <datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct>. It is now in the possession of Mr. Elliston, jun. who has succeeded in a most extraordinary manner; his performers and performances being of the <num value="1">first</num> order. 
<p>The exterior of the house is plain but neat, and the approaches are very convenient. The auditorium of the theatre, which is nearly square in form, is exceedingly spacious. The upper part of the proscenium is formed on the segment of an ellipsis; it is supported by <num value="2">two</num> gilt fluted composite columns on each side, with intervening stage doors and boxes. The stage doors are richly gilt. The pit measures <num value="36">36</num>ft. <num value="6">6</num>in. from the orchestra to the front of the boxes, and contains eighteen seats, every alternate seat having aback. It will hold about <num value="900">900</num> persons. There is only <num value="1">one</num> full circle of boxes, which consist of <num value="5">five</num> private boxes on each side, each containing <num value="2">two</num> seats; and <num value="15">fifteen</num> open boxes, having <num value="3">three</num> seats in each. The fronts are painted French white, with gold scroll work, and other ornaments. There are side boxes above the lower tier, the fronts of which are ornamented with gilt scroll work, in oblong <pb id="p.491" n="491"> compartments, each alternate division having a lyre in its centre, and the intermediate ones an eagle with extended wings on a cup or vase. The gallery, as customary in minor theatres, is remarkably spacious, and will hold above a <num value="1000">thousand</num> persons. It descends to a level with the side boxes in the centre, but from its principal elevation it is continued along both sides over them. The front decorations are the same as those of the side boxes. Capacious lobbies are attached both to the boxes and pit, and also to the gallery, with a room for refreshment in each. 
<p>The ceiling springs from the <num value="4">four</num> extremities of the front of the side galleries. The centre is painted in imitation of a sky, with genii on the verge and in the angles. At the springing points are circular tablets, on which also are painted cupids or genii, in various attitudes. A handsome chandelier depends from the centre, and there are smaller ones suspended from brackets over the stage doors, which are continued round the boxes. All the lighting is by gas. 
<p>The prices of admission are the same as at the other minor theatres, and half price is taken. The receipts of the house when completely filled, amount to about <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">300</num>l.</measure> The present rent is <measure value="1200l." type=currency><num value="1200">1,200</num>l.</measure> per annum; the taxes are about <measure value="300l." type=currency><num value="300">300</num>l.</measure>; and the insurance <measure value="290l." type=currency><num value="290">290</num>l.</measure> yearly.

<div2 type=section id="c.19.14"><HEAD>The Marshalsea Prison.</HEAD>
 
<p>This is a court of law and a prison, intended at <num value="1">first</num> for the determination of causes and differences among the king's menial servants, and was under the control of the knight marshal of the royal household, and removable at pleasure. Stowe informs us, 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>that in the year <datestruct value="1376"><year reg="1376">1376</year></datestruct>, the <num value="50">50th</num> of Edward III. Henry Percy being marshal, kept his prisoners in the city of London, where having committed <num value="1">one</num> J. Pendergest, of Norwich, contrary to the liberties of the city of London, the citizens, by persuasion of the lord Fitzwalter, their standard bearer, took armour, and ran with great rage to the marshal's inn, broke up the gates, brought out the prisoner, and conveyed him away, intending to have burnt the stocks in the midst of their city, but they <num value="1">first</num> sought for sir Henry Percy, to have punished him, as I have noted in my annals. 
<p>Moreover, about the feast of Easter, next following, John, duke of Lancaster, having caused all the whole navy of England to be gathered together at London, a certain esquire chanced to kill <num value="1">one</num> of the shipmen: which act the other shipmen taking in ill part, they brought their suit into the king's court of Marshalsea, which then, as happened, saith my author, was kept in Southwark; but when they perceived that court to be too favourable to the murderer; and farther, that the king's warrant was also gotten for his pardon; they, in great fury, ran to the house wherein the murderer was imprisoned, broke into it, and brought out the prisoner with his fetters on his legs; they thrust a knife to his heart, and <pb id="p.492" n="492"> stuck him as if he had been a hog. After this they tied a rope to his fetters, and drew him to the gallows, where, when they had hanged him, as though they had done a great act, they caused the trumpets to be sounded before them to the ships, and there, in great triumph, they spent the rest of the day.</QUOTE>
 
<p>This court had particular cognizance of murders, and other offences committed within the king's court; such as striking, which was anciently punishable by the loss of the offending hand. Here also persons guilty of piracies, and other offences on the high seas were committed. For the latter purpose it is still continued, though the offenders are tried and convicted at the Old Bailey, and executed at the Execution Dock, Wapping. 
<p>The dispensation of the law in the Marshalsea, and the King's Palace Court, is by the following judges: the lord steward of the household, the knight marshal, deputy marshal, steward, &amp;c. The causes are conducted by <num value="4">four</num> counsel, and <num value="6">six</num> attornies; here are also <num value="6">six</num> marshalmen, or tipstaffs, and subordinate officers. The attornies are of Clifford's Inn, London, none others being suffered to practice in these courts. The court has jurisdiction <num value="12">twelve</num> miles round Whitehall (exclusive of the city of London) for actions of debt, damages, trespasses, &amp;c. and subject to be removed to a higher court of law, when above <measure value="20l." type=currency><num value="20">20</num>l.</measure> 
<p>Mr. Howard describes the old prison as <QUOTE rend=blockquote><p>an irregular building (rather several buildings) in a spacious yard. There are in the whole near <num value="60">sixty</num> rooms, and yet only <num value="6">six</num> of them left for common side debtors. 
<p>Mr. Allnutt, who was many years since a prisoner here, had, during his confinement, a large estate bequeathed to him. He learned sympathy by his sufferings, and left <measure value="100l." type=currency><num value="100">100</num>l.</measure> a year to release poor debtors from hence. Many are cleared by it every year.</QUOTE>
 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1381"><year reg="1381">1381</year></datestruct>, the Kentish rebels broke down the houses of the Marshalsea and King's-bench, in Southwark; took from thence the prisoners, broke down the house of sir John Immorth, the marshal of the Marshalsea, and King's-bench, &amp;c. In <datestruct value="1387--"><year reg="1387">1387</year></datestruct>, the <num value="11">11th</num> of Richard the <num value="2">Second</num>, after St. Bartholomew's day, the king kept a great council in the castle of Nottingham, and the Marshalsea of the king was then kept at Loughborough upwards of <num value="6">six</num> days. Sir Walter Manny was marshal of the Marshalsea in the <num value="22">22nd</num> year of the reign of Henry VI. William Brandon, esq. in the year <datestruct value="1504"><year reg="1504">1504</year></datestruct>; during his presidency the prisoners of the Marshalsea, at that time removed back to Southwark, broke out, and many of them being taken, were executed; especially such as had been committed for felony or treason. 
<p>A dangerous insurrection in Southwark, in <datestruct value="1593--"><year reg="1593">1593</year></datestruct>, was occasioned by the serving of a warrant from the lord chamberlain, by <num value="1">one</num> of the knights marshal's men, upon a feltmaker's servant, who was committed to the Marshalsea, with others; that had been accused to his lordship by the knights marshal's man, without cause of <pb id="p.493" n="493"> offence. The officer entered the house where the warrant was to be served, with a dagger drawn, alarming the man's wife who sat by the fire with a young infant in her arms; and after having taken the prisoners, committed them to the Marshalsea, where they lay <num value="5">five</num> days without having it in their power to answer the supposed offence. Upon this the servants of the felt-makers made this a common cause, and assembled together out of Bermondsey-street and Blackfriars, with a great number of men, to rescue those that were committed to the Marshalsea. The pretence of their meeting was occasioned by a play on the sabbath; which, besides its profanation, gave opportunity to commit various disorders. 
<p>The lord mayor, sir William Webb, hearing of the tumult, hastened with <num value="1">one</num> of the sheriffs, to the scene of disorder; and having dismissed the multitude by proclamation, seized some of the ringleaders, and committed them to prison, to be farther punished as they deserved; he sent next morning for the deputy and constable of the borough, with others who were present, from whom he found, by the testimony of the inhabitants, that the occasion of the riot had been through the misconduct of the marshal's men; and to add to the provocation, when the populace had assembled, the knight marshal's men having sheltered themselves within the Marshalsea, issued forth with their daggers drawn, and bastinadoes in their hands, beating innocent passengers; and afterwards drew their swords, by which several persons were slain; this had increased the tumult. 
<p>The inhabitants of Southwark also complained  <QUOTE> that the said marshal's men were very unneighbourly and disdainful among them, refusing to pay scot and lot with them, or any other duty to church or commonwealth.</QUOTE>  The lord mayor upon these informations applied to the lord treasurer, that they might be admonished of their behaviour, and receive more discretion in serving their warrants. 
<p>The lord mayor apprehending also great danger in the city, when the apprentices and others who had raised the insurrection should be punished, it having been generally known that the marshal's men gave the occasion, wrote to the lord treasurer, and urged that their punishment should be impartial, as well upon the knight marshal's men, who excited the disorders by their indiscreet and violent behaviour, as upon the rioters; adding, that in case it were not done, notwithstanding the great care that the magistracy had and meant to take to keep good order; and he supposed that the magistrates of this city never had the inhabitants under better regulation, yet they were in doubt, that this mischief could not be thoroughly abated if the measure recommended was not adopted. The lord treasurer attended to the representation, and peace was restored. 
<p>Mr. Bray says,  <QUOTE> government purchased the old county gaol, called The White Lion, for <num value="4000">4,000</num>l and built a new prison, fitted up in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, of which Mr. Nield gives this account: The entrance gate <pb id="p.494" n="494"> fronts the High-street, near St. George's church, and a small area leads to the keeper's house.

<div1 type=chapter id="c.20" n="20"><HEAD>History and Topography of St. Saviour's Parish.</HEAD>
 
<p>The original name of the church of this parish was St. Mary Overy, or over the river. On the dissolution, about Christmas, <datestruct value="1539--"><year reg="1539">1539</year></datestruct>, the inhabitants of the parishes of St. Margaret and St. Mary Magdalen, petitioned the king for a grant of the church which had belonged to the priory here, and being seconded by Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, obtained it by purchase, by which means the conventual church has been preserved to this time. In <datestruct value="1541--"><year reg="1541">1541</year></datestruct>, these <num value="2">two</num> parishes were, by an act of parliament, made into <num value="1">one</num>, by the new name of St. Saviour. The church of St. Margaret was pulled down, and that of St. Mary Magdalen, which stood by the priory church, and was originally a chapel to it, was added to that building, and formed a portion of the south aisle until the late repairs. 
<p>This parish is large, extending from London-bridge east, to Gravel-lane west, and is divided into <num value="2">two</num> liberties; that of the Borough and that of the Clink. Its particular bounds are as follows: commencing at the south foot of new London bridge; thence south to a little below St. Thomas-street, where it turns east by Queen-street to the south side of King-street, thence to High-street, to the north side of Union-street, and after a short distance to the south side of the same street to Little Guildford-street, behind the houses on the south side of Great Suffolk-street, to Gravel-lane to the Falcon dock. 
<div2 type=section id="c.20.1"><HEAD>St. Savior's Church.</HEAD>
 
<p>This magnificent church is built on the cathedral arrangement. The plan is cruciform; it consists of a nave with its aisles, north and south transepts, a choir and aisles, the chapel of our Lady, and, until the last repair, <num value="3">three</num> other chapels; at the intersection of the nave and transepts are <num value="4">four</num> strong piers for the support of a central tower. The walls are built of flint and stone, repaired <pb id="p.495" n="495"> with brick work. The western front retains some of the original features: by the means of facade walls built above the aisles, and curiously faced with squared flints; the elevation assumes a square form, at the angles are buttresses, partly square and partly octangular, which contain staircases. The principal doorway in the centre has a handsome frontispiece; it consists of a pointed arch, the mouldings resting on small columns attached to the jambs, inscribed within a larger arch of a correspondent character, the space between the <num value="2">two</num> being pannelled; the spandrils are decorated with quaterfoils inscribed in circles, and the whole is bounded by a square moulding: the door is oak, richly ornamented with pannels and tracery in relief: above this doorway is a large obtusely arched window, divided by mullions into lights, and subdivided by a transom; the tracery has been very tastelessly modernized; the parapet and gable over this window are modern; the south aisle still retains a neat window of <num value="3">three</num> lights, with original tracery in the head of the arch; the window in the northern aisle is concealed by a dwelling house built against this part of the church. The south aisle is made into <num value="7">seven</num> divisions; the <num value="2">second</num> from the west is occupied by a porch, which, when perfect, formed a beautiful specimen of the architecture of the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century; the entrance is double, it consists of <num value="2">two</num> trefoil arches resting on clustered columns with leaved capitals, and surmounted by a row of niches of different heights to accommodate the arch in which they are formed; in the central the bracket for a statue still remains; the large arch is formed of numerous receding mouldings springing from columns attached to the jambs; the lines are much injured through time and injudicious repairs: the upright is now finished with a modern parapet and coping; in Hollar's time it had a gable ornamented with niches and circles; the remaining divisions of this aisle are marked by buttresses, and all but the last contains pointed windows of <num value="2">two</num> lights with quaterfoils in the heads of the arches; the last division has a window of larger dimensions; it is made by mullions into <num value="3">three</num> lights, and the head of the arch contains circular compartments; it is curious as <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest specimens of the mullioned window, the walls are finished with a modern parapet; the clerestory is faced with brick, and contains <num value="6">six</num> pointed windows, the mullions destroyed, and modern architraves of stone added; the elevation is finished with a parapet and coping. In Hollar's View, the tracery of these windows is represented as perfect, and the parapet as well as that of the aisle, as embattled. The date <datestruct value="1703"><year reg="1703">1703</year></datestruct> is on a tablet above the windows, and marks the period of the alteration. The west wall of the south transept has <num value="3">three</num> lofty windows, each divided into <num value="3">three</num> lights by mullions, and the head of the arch filled with exquisitely formed tracery; the south front of the transept once had a window of large dimensions, and equally elegant in its decorations, the arch of which, part of the jambs, and <num value="4">four</num> of the uprights still remain. Over this window, on a fascia, is inscribed,  <QUOTE>This end <pb id="p.496" n="496"> and the east fronts were repaired, A. D, <datestruct value="1735--"><year reg="1735">1735</year></datestruct>.</QUOTE>  The east wall of the transept corresponds with the western <num value="1">one</num>; the finish of this part of the church is also modern; a porch was formerly situated below the south window. The choir has been nearly rebuilt, between <datestruct VALUE="1822-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>, and <datestruct VALUE="1825-04--"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, and the architecture has been carefully restored by George Gwilt, esq. F. S. A.; the care and attention be stowed by this gentleman in assimilating his additions with the existing remains of the architecture of the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century, are highly creditable to his taste and research; the authorities for his new works are derived from buildings of the period, and as a whole it forms <num value="1">one</num> of the completest restorations in the country. A chapel, which was formerly the parish church of St. Mary Magdalene, was attached to the south aisle of the choir, the walls of which had been injured by the large arches that had been made in its walls at the Reformation to afford a communication between the chapel and the church. 
<p>This chapel shewed the architecture of the <num value="16">sixteenth</num> century; it had <num value="3">three</num> windows and a modern doorway in the south wall, and the east end was concealed by an adjacent house; the interior was divided into a nave and aisles by <num value="3">three</num> arches on each side, resting on clustered columns; the whole building was entirely taken down in <datestruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></datestruct>; the wall of the south aisle of the choir had in consequence to be made good; this has been rebuilt in <num value="5">five</num> divisions which contain lancet-windows, and in the <num value="3">third</num> from the transept is a pointed doorway of a correct and bold character, the oak door which fills the arch, and has an antique appearance; the strong massive flying buttresses have been carefully repaired, and a block cornice copied from an original example, which remained in a division eastward of the destroyed chapel, surmounted by a parapet, added as a finish to the walls ; the clerestory was rebuilt in the same manner, the materials being flint and Bath stone, most curiously bonded together, the form of the cross being introduced wherever it was possible; the larger buttresses have lofty pannels attached to them, which are copied from <num value="1">one</num> existing on the north side of the church, and although of a period more recent than the main building, form a very handsome and appropriate finish to the buttresses: the glazing of the windows in circles and lozenges, in imitation of the earliest specimens, is <num value="1">one</num> instance of the general correctness of the additions. The remainder of the south side of the church, as well as the east end, are greatly concealed by adjacent buildings; the bishop's chapel is a small building formed by a continuation of <num value="1">one</num> of the aisles of the Lady chapel; it displays specimens of the architecture of the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century; it was much injured by the fire in <datestruct value="1668--"><year reg="1668">1668</year></datestruct>, and is now in a dilapidated state, being doomed to destruction to make way for the approach to the new London bridge. The east front of the church is an entirely new design by Mr. Gwilt; it deserves great attention for the elegance of its architecture, and the general correctness of the detail. At the angles are square <pb id="p.497" n="497"> buttresses, the sides relieved with niches; the finish of each is very tasteful, it consists of a pinnacle, formed of an open arcade ranged in an octagon, and crowned with a dwarf spire; between these buttresses is a treble lancet window, and the elevation is finished with a gable in which is a handsome circular window; on the apex is a beautiful foliated cross, forming an appropriate finish to this front of the church. Beneath this is the following inscription:

<p>Having brought the reader from the west front to the east end of the church, by the south side, it will be necessary to proceed in a retrograde direction to arrive at the point from which we started. The north side of the church is greatly concealed by warehouses, which contain extensive vestiges of the ancient monastic buildings; the aisle and clerestory of the choir have been repaired by Mr. Gwilt, and assimilate with the opposite side; a small chapel dedicated to St. John fills the angle between the choir and transept; it is now used as the vestry. The transept has been greatly modernized, and the south wall brought into the body of the building, and supported midway on an arch; the original pointed windows have been deprived of their tracery, and brick instead of stone is the material which was used in the recesses; the north aisle of the nave and the clerestory have been rebuilt or rather faced with brick, in a dull tasteless style, but the mullions of the windows have however been preserved. Near the transept are the remains of a magnificent Norman doorway, encircled with diagonal and other rich mouldings, an almost solitary vestige--of the original Norman church; this doorway formed the communication between the church and the cloisters. The tower which rises from the centre of the church is a bold and massive structure, without heaviness; it is in <num value="2">two</num> principal stories, each of which has <num value="2">two</num> windows in every face, divided into compartments by mullions; in the south front, the <num value="2">two</num> upper windows have been partially destroyed to make way for the clock; an embattled parapet finishes the wall, and at each angle is an octangular turret crowned with a lofty crocketted pinnacle ending in a vane: the tower was substantially repaired, and the pinnacles rebuilt in <datestruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></datestruct>, which date is on the vanes. 
<p>Having surveyed the entire exterior of the church, it is only necessary to notice the arch attached to the west end, which is a vestige of the gate of the close that still retains its ancient appellation, though confounded with the name of a modern proprietor. Entering the west door, the nave is the <num value="1">first</num> object of attention; and <pb id="p.498" n="498"> here it is to be observed, that the organ and its screen encroach considerably upon the limits of the ancient nave, which originally extended to the transept. On each side are <num value="7">seven</num> acutely pointed arches, springing from circular pillars, to which are attached small cylinders; above these arches is a <num value="2">second</num> story of trefoil and pointed arches in blank, a rather unusual mode of constructing the gallery story; over this is the <num value="3">third</num> or clerestory, which being occupied by the windows noticed in the exterior, it is unnecessary to particularize further. The ceiling is oak, vaulted and groined with numerous intersections, forming a tasteful and harmonious design; at the points of intersection are bosses with various scriptural devices and armorial bearings; the arches of the vault spring from corbels representing angels. The aisles are simply vaulted in stone with arches and cross springers. The north transept has a similar ceiling to the nave, and the southern, a modern plaister ceiling put up in lieu of the <num value="1">one</num> which fell down some years ago. The <num value="4">four</num> beautiful arches which sustain the tower, are worthy of the highest admiration; the archivolts of the eastern arch rest on corbels, carved with the heads of a king and queen; and the western arch have in like manner a king and bishop. The choir in its restored state, shews a fine specimen of the architecture of the <num value="13">thirteenth</num> century. On each side are <num value="5">five</num> pointed arches, the archivolts are moulded and spring from circular pillars; the <num value="2">second</num> story like the nave, has pointed arches, forming an arcade, and the <num value="3">third</num>, or clerestory, is rendered highly ornamental by open screens composed of <num value="3">three</num> lancet arches before every window; the roof is an acutely pointed vault, groined with arches and cross springers, with handsome bosses at the intersections. The east wall is occupied by a magnificent altar screen, composed of series of niches which still retain some of their pristine features, although the canopies have been chipped to a plane surface, when the late altar screen was set up. On the removal of that unsightly termination to the choir, the present screen was discovered, and has since been cleaned; it was probably the work of Richard Fox, bishop of Winchester, from <datestruct value="1500--"><year reg="1500">1500</year></datestruct> to l<num value="528">528</num>, whose favourite device, the pelican, exists in the ornamental cornice which finishes the screen, and was still more prominent on the soffite of the old eastern window. Above this screen a lancet window of <num value="3">three</num> arches, fronted by an open screen, forms an appropriate finish, filling up the entire wall to the roof. The aisles are vaulted in the same style as the choir. The Lady Chapel is made in length into <num value="3">three</num>, and in breadth into <num value="4">four</num> aisles, by <num value="6">six</num> groups of clustered columns; the roof is an acutely arched vault, groined in compartments: at the north east extremity are the remains of an altar. The Bishop's Chapel is divided from the present by a pointed arch; it has a modern ceiling of plaister. 
<p>The part now used for divine service, comprehends the ancient choir, and <num value="2">two</num> arches of the nave, the organ with its supporting <pb id="p.499" n="499"> gallery occupying another; the transepts, until late, were used, but they have been walled off from the church for the purpose of repairs, which have never taken place; at present, the whole has a disgraceful appearance, and it is sincerely to be hoped that Mr. Gwilt's plans for restoring the building, will be carried into effect without further delay. The interior of this church shews, at present, a very unusual state for a building of the establishment.

<p>The monuments are very numerous.

This monument consists of an altar tomb, the pedestal enriched with a row of upright niches, with arched heads, enclosing <num value="5">five</num> sweeps. A fascia above is thus inscribed:

<p>The ceiling of the canopy is richly and elegantly groomed and springs from the arches of the canopy, which, having no supporters, are formed into pendants in the front; which, with corresponding ones at the back, sustain the groining.

<p>Stow informs us, from a tradition delivered to him by Linsted, the last prior, and who surrendered the house to king Henry VIII. that there was, long before the conquest, a house of sisters, founded by a maiden lady named Mary, and endowed by her with the profits of a ferry across the Thames; that afterwards it was converted by a noble lady of the name of Swithen into a college of priests, who, in place of the ferry, built the <num value="1">first</num> bridge over the Thames, of timber, and kept it in repair. Mr. Bray, the historian of the county, very justly remarks, that  <QUOTE>it is inconsistent to suppose that the priests would build a bridge, if they were able to do so, by which the profits of their ferry would be destroyed, and they would lose the means of maintaining it, when built.

<p>Bishop Tanner<NOTE><BIBL>Notitia Monastica <hi rend=italics>art.</hi> Southwark.</BIBL></NOTE> observes, that this account of the foundation of the religious house here is not confirmed by any other authority in print or manuscript that had occurred to him, and must depend on the story told to that good old antiquary, Stow; that, according to Matthew of Westminster, canons regular (then newly come into England) were placed here, and by bishop Giffard, according to the Hist.

<p>There seems, however, to be no doubt, that in <datestruct value="1106--"><year reg="1106">1106</year></datestruct> this foundation was renewed for canons regular, by William Pont d&lsquo;Arch and William Dauncey, <num value="2">two</num> Norman knights, and that this bishop, when he obtained quiet possession of his see in <datestruct value="1107--"><year reg="1107">1107</year></datestruct>, assisted them, and built the nave of their church; on which account, perhaps, some have called him the founder.

<p>The priory was again burnt or damaged by fire in the reign of Richard II. and was rebuilt or repaired in that or the succeeding reign. 
<p>It is probable that cardinal Beaufort (son of John of Ghent, duke of Lancaster, son of Edward III.) contributed to the repair of this church, as the arms of the Beauforts are carved in stone on a pillar in the south transept; and what remains of sculpture on each side of them appears to be designed for the strings of a cardinal's hat, which perhaps was placed over them.

is some description of what remained of this house, with a small print of it. It stood near the west end of the church. and was of the form of half a Roman H. The entrance was by a small flight of stone steps, with an ornament in the shape of an esculleys shell over the door; the rooms were lofty, and of a good size, and the fire places were large. Some years ago there were remains of rich mouldings, now destroyed. 
<p>The writer in the above work calls this mansion Monteagle-house, and says it was the residence of the lord of that name, who here received the anonymous letter which led to the discovery of the gunpowder plot. This is certainly a mistake, arising from some resemblance in the names of Montague and Monteagle. The letter was given to lord Monteagle's footman in, the street, but in what street is not said, and his lordship's residence is not named. <NOTE><BIBL>Archaelogia, xii. p. <num value="200">200</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> There is a tradition, that in consequence of this discovery, this close enjoyed certain privileges; it is mentioned in the act of queen Anne for administering justice in privileged places, but the privileges here, if any, must have been derived from its having been a religious house. 
<p>The remains of the priory are not extensive; on the west side of Montague-close is a crypt running north and south, about <num value="100">100</num> feet long, by <num value="25">25</num> feet wide, in <num value="2">two</num> aisles, with octangular columns, the roof groined. Over it is a spacious room, perhaps the dormitory; at the north end of which are the apparent remains of a large window, which has been stopped up: and on each side of the room are seen marks of doorways and small windows. The northern end shews the original open timber-worked roof, with <num value="2">two</num> strong beams resting on stone brackets. On the east side are <num value="5">five</num> narrow-painted windows, and on the west <num value="1">one</num> larger.

<p>In <datestruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></datestruct>, the parliament resolved that the bishop's house here should be used as a prison, and that Mr. William Devenish should be the keeper; and Mr. Willson Ratcliffe was committed thereto during the pleasure of the house. In February following, Devenish was authorised to provide some orthodox and godly ministers to preach in this house for the instruction of the souls of the prisoners, and he was to prohibit any to preach there who were not so qualified, or that were not well affected to the king and parliament.<NOTE><BIBL>Journals of the House of Commons.</BIBL></NOTE>

<p>Vain would be the attempt to determine the extent and arrangement of this palace from its present remains. The site was probably divided into <num value="2">two</num> or more grand courts, the principal of which appears to have had its range of state apartments fronting the river; and part of this range is now almost the only elevation that can be traced. Though its external decorations on the north or river front, have been either destroyed or bricked up, yet in the other, facing the south, are many curious doorways and windows in various styles, from that of the early pointed down to the era of Henry VIII. but wofully mutilated, and concealed by sheds, stables, and warehouses. 
<p>On the site of a considerable part of this palace was erected the extensive oil and mustard-mills of Messrs. Wardle and Jones.

They burnt with great rapidity: and the flames communicating with several other warehouses, great fears were entertained for the safety of the ancient church nearly adjoining; through great exertion, however, the fire was got under, and no lives were lost. 
<p>Ruinous as this alarming fire proved to the valuable property in this neighbourhood, the ever watchful antiquary and the passionate admirers of art, were indebted to it for the discovery of <num value="1">one</num> of the finest specimens of early domestic architecture this country has at any time produced.

<p>The ruins of this venerable palace, as they appeared immediately after the fire, are described in various publications of that year; but they have since been considerably demolished, and little now remains; the great wall, which divided the hall from the other apartments, with a magnificent circular window, was built against in the early part of this year.<NOTE><BIBL>Ma, <datestruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></datestruct>.</BIBL></NOTE>

<p>These and many more orders were to be observed, upon great pain and punishment. 
<p>There were also several patents of confirmation; exclusive of those mentioned above. In the <num value="4">4th</num> of Richard II. these stewhouses, then belonging to sir William Walworth, mayor of London, were farmed by froes, or bawds, of Flanders, and were destroyed by Wat Tyler and other rebels of Kent. <pb id="p.514" n="514"> 
<p>It seems highly probable, that resentment for the personal injury sustained on this occasion might have had its share, as well as loyalty, in producing the action for which Walworth is particularly distinguished. The ordinances respecting these houses were, however, again confirmed by Henry VI., but in <datestruct value="1506--"><year reg="1506">1506</year></datestruct>, as Fabian informs us, they were for some time uninhabited. It was not long before they were again opened, that is, so many as were permitted;  <QUOTE>for whereas before were eighteen houses, from thenceforth were appointed to be used but <num value="12">twelve</num> only.</QUOTE>  These privileged stews had signs painted on the fronts which looked towards the Thames, as the Boar's-head, the Cross-keys, the Gun, the Cardinal's-hat, &amp;c. Stow relates, that the women who frequented them were forbidden the rites of the church, and excluded from Christian burial, unless they were reconciled to it before they died. A plot of ground, called  <QUOTE>The Single Women's Church-yard,</QUOTE>  at some distance from the parish church, was therefore appointed for their interment. In <datestruct value="1546--"><year reg="1546">1546</year></datestruct>, these stews were suppressed by Henry VIII. and it was proclaimed by sound of trumpet that they should be no longer privileged and used as a common brothel, but that the inhabitants were to keep good and honest rules, as in other places of this realm.

<p>The liberty of the Clink is of considerable size, extending from the river to Suffolk-street, and from Winchester-street cast, to Gravel-lane south. This liberty belongs to the see of Winchester, and a court leet is held yearly at Michaelmas, for the election of officers.

<p><FIGURE id="Fig.516"><HEAD>Bear Garden</HEAD></FIGURE> 
<p>In the reign of Henry VIII. the Bankside, Southwark, afterwards the site of several theatres, particularly of the Globe, where most of Shakespeare's plays were produced, was a thinly-built district, the resort of the idle and the dissipated, who repaired thither to indulge in the amusements of hull-baiting, bear-baiting, and various other sports which were there carried on, particularly in the space between St. Mary Overy's (now St. Saviour's) church and Paris-garden, a hamlet nearly opposite Blackfriar's, whence there was a ferry across the Thames. Skelton, a poet of the time of Henry VIII. has the following curious lines upon these diversions:

<p>The annexed engraving, representing the scene of these sports, has been copied, with scrupulous accuracy, from an early plan of the manor of Paris-garden, in the possession of W. Bray, esq. F. S. A.<FIGURE id="Fig.516.1"><HEAD>Bankside, Southwark</HEAD></FIGURE> 
<p>On closely inspecting the engraving, it will be seen that combats are represented as taking place in the interior of the edifice. The bulls and bears are displayed below, ranged opposite to each other in rows. The square enclosures betwixt them are pools of water, in which the animals were washed; and the oblong slips to the left are old pike ponds: Pye or Pike-gardens still exist. 
<p>Whether these  <QUOTE>rough games,</QUOTE>  as a certain author terms them, were then exhibited in the same or similar amphitheatres, to those afterwards engraved in our old plans, or in the open air, the extract does not inform us; nor does Stow's account afford any better idea. He merely tells us, that there were on the west bank  <QUOTE><num value="2">two</num> bear gardens, the old and the new; places wherein were kept beares, bulls, and other beasts to be bayted; as also mastives in several kenels, nourished to hayt them. These beares and other beasts,</QUOTE>  he adds,  <QUOTE>are there kept in plots of ground scaffolded about for the beholders to stand safe.</QUOTE>  
<p>In Aggas's plan, taken <datestruct value="1574--"><year reg="1574">1574</year></datestruct>, and the plan of Braun made about the same time, these plots of ground are engraved, with the addition of <num value="2">two</num> <hi rend=italics>circi</hi> for the accommodation of the spectators, bearing the names of the  <QUOTE>Bowlle Baytyng and the Beare Baytinge.</QUOTE>  In both plans the buildings appear to be completely circular, and were evidently intended as humble imitations of the ancient Roman amphitheatre. They stood in <num value="2">two</num> adjoining fields, separated only by a small strip of land; but some differences are observable in the spots on which they are built. 
<p>In Aggas's plan, which is the earliest, the disjoining slip of land contains only <num value="1">one</num> large pond, common to the <num value="2">two</num> places of exhibition; but in Braun this appears divided into <num value="3">three</num> ponds, besides a similar conveniency near each theatre. The use of these pieces of water is very well explained in Brown's Travels (<datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>), who has given a plate of the  <QUOTE> Elector of Saxony his beare garden at Dresden,</QUOTE>  in which is a large pond, with several bears amusing themselves in it, his account of which is highly curious: 
<p> <QUOTE>In the hunting-house in the old town,</QUOTE>  says he,  <QUOTE>are <num value="15">fifteen</num> bears, very well provided for and looked unto. They have fountains and ponds to wash themselves in, wherein they much delight: and near to the pond are high ragged posts or trees set up for the bears to climb up, and scaffolds made at the top to sun and dry themselves; where they will also sleep, and come and go as the keeper calls them.</QUOTE>  
<p>The ponds and dog-kennels for the bears on the Bankside are clearly marked in the plans alluded to; and the construction of the <pb id="p.518" n="518"> amphitheatres themselves may be tolerably well conceived, notwithstanding the smallness of the scale on which they are drawn. They evidently consisted, withinside, of a lower tier of circular seats for the spectators, at the back of which a sort of screen ran all round, in part open, so as to admit a view from without, evident in Braun's delineation, by the figures who are looking through on the outside. The buildings are unroofed, and in both plans shewn during the time of performance, which in Aggas's view is announced by the display of little flags or streamers on the top. The dogs are tied up in slips near each ready for the sport, and the combatants actually engaged in Braun's plan. <num value="2">Two</num> little houses for retirement are at the head of each theatre. 
<p>The rage for bear-baiting prevailed in the <num value="16">16th</num> century among all orders of people. It was <num value="1">one</num> of the diversions queen Elizabeth partook of during her visit to Kenilworth, in <datestruct value="1576--"><year reg="1576">1576</year></datestruct>, and the French ambassador was entertained by her with an exhibition of the kind at the Hope, on Bankside. An example thus set by royalty, soon spread through every rank, and bear and bull baiting became general amusements in England. Shakespeare has alluded to these sports in many places, and they equally attracted the notice of foreign and domestic historians. Hentzner, a German traveller in England, whose Itinerary was printed in <datestruct value="1598--"><year reg="1598">1598</year></datestruct>, was a spectator of these exhibitions, which he thus circumstantially describes. Speaking of the theatres, he says:-- <QUOTE>There is still another place built in the form of a theatre, which serves for the baiting of bulls and bears; they are fastened behind, and then worried by great English bull-dogs, but not without great risk to the dogs, from the horns of the <num value="1">one</num> and the teeth of the other; and it sometimes happens that they are killed on the spot, but fresh ones are immediately supplied.</QUOTE>  He adds an account of a still more inhuman practice, that of whipping a blind bear to death, with which we shall not disgust our readers. 
<p>Stow, speaking of these amphitheatres, says, they were appropriated for the keeping of  <QUOTE> bears, bulls, and other beasts, to be baited</QUOTE> ; and also mastives, in their several kennels, were there nourished to bait them. These beasts were kept in plots of ground, scaffolded about, for the beholders to stand safe. But though such precautions were used, a terrible accident happened here on Sunday, <datestruct VALUE="1583-01-13"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg=13>13</day>, <year reg=1583>1583</year></datestruct>, by the fall of a scaffold, which had been overloaded. The fanatical writers of the time, forgetting the passage of Scripture touching  <QUOTE>those on whom the tower in Siloah fell,</QUOTE>  represented this disaster as a judgment from heaven, because the exhibition took place on a Sunday, which was a day particularly set apart for the sport. Amongst the rest, Prynne, in his <title>Histriomastix</title>, p. <num value="557">557</num>, fol. gives the following account, but his description is probably greatly overcharged: 
<p> <QUOTE>Upon the <datestruct VALUE="-01-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> <month reg="01">January</month></datestruct>, anno <datestruct value="1583"><year reg="1583">1583</year></datestruct>, being the Lord's day, an infinite number of people, men, women, and children, resorted <pb id="p.519" n="519"> unto Paris-garden to see beare-bayting, playes, and other pastimes; and being altogether mounted aloft upon these scaffolds and galleries, and in the middest of all their jollity and pastime, all the whole building (not <num value="1">one</num> sticke so much as standing) fell down miraculously to the ground, with much horror and confusion. In the fall of it <num value="5">five</num> men and <num value="2">two</num> women were slain outright, and above <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> persons more sore wounded and bruised, whereof many died shortly after; some of them having their braines dashed out, some their heads all to quasht, some their legges broken, some their armes, some their backes, some <num value="1">one</num> hurt, some another; there being nothing heard there but wofull shreekes and cryes, which did even pierce the skies; children bewailing there the death and hurts of their parents, parents of their children, wives of their husbands; and husbands of their wives; so that every--way, from foure of the clocke in the afternoone till <num value="9">nine</num> at night, especially over London-bridge, many were carried in chaires, and led betwixt their friends, and so brought to their houses with sorrowful heavy hearts, like lame cripples. A just, though terrible judgment of God, upon these play-haunters and prophaners of his holy day.</QUOTE>  
<p>The puritans, as observed above, strenuously maintained that this incident was a visitation of Providence; and the lord mayor for that year (sir Thomas Blanke) wrote to the lord treasurer,  <QUOTE>that it gave great reason to acknowledge the hand of God for breach of the Lord's day,</QUOTE>  and therefore begged he would exert himself to suppress the diversions. The accident, however, was forgotten, and the sports carried on as usual; for Stow says, that in his time the bear-gardens on Bankside, for the baiting of bulls and bears, were still much frequented. 
<p>In the reign of James I. the  <QUOTE>Bear-garden was under the protection of royalty, and the mastership of it made a patent place. The celebrated actor Alleyn enjoyed this lucrative post, as keeper of the king's wild beasts, or master of the royal bear-garden, situated on the Bankside, in Southwark.</QUOTE>  The profits of this place are said by his biographer to have been immense, sometimes amounting to <measure value="500l." type=currency><num value="500">500</num>l.</measure> a year; and well account for the great fortune he raised. A little before his death he sold his share and patent to his wife's father, Mr. Hinchtoe, for <measure value="580l." type=currency><num value="580">580</num>l.</measure> 
<p>We have a good account of the  <QUOTE> bear-bating,</QUOTE>  in the reign of Charles II. by <num value="1">one</num> Mons.

Jorevin, vol. iv. p. <num value="549">549</num>.</BIBL></NOTE> and who has given us the following curious detail of a visit he paid to it: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote>We went to see the Bergiardin, by Sodoark,<NOTE>Bear-garden, Southwark.</NOTE> which is a great am hitheatre, where combatsare fought between all sorts of animals, and sometimes men, as we once saw. Commonly, when any fencing masters are desirous of showing their courage and their great <pb id="p.520" n="520"> skill, they issue mutual challenges; and, before they engage, parade the town with drums and trumpets sounding, to inform the public there is a challenge between <num value="2">two</num> brave masters of the science of defence, and that the battle will be fought on such a day. We went to see this combat, which was performed on a stage in the middle of this amphitheatre, where, on the flourishes of trumpets and the beat of drums, the combatants entered, stripped to their shirts. On a signal from the drum they drew their swords, a immediately began the fight, skirmishing a long time without any wounds. They were both very skilful and courageous. The tallest had the advantage over the least: for, according to the English fashion of fencing, they endeavoured rather to cut than push in the French manner, so that by his height he had the advantage of being able to strike his antagonist on the head, against which the little <num value="1">one</num> was on his guard. He had in his turn an advantage over the great <num value="1">one</num> in being able to give him the Jarnac stroke, by cutting him on his right ham, which he left in a manner quite unguarded: so that, all things considered, they were equally matched. Nevertheless, the tall <num value="1">one</num> struck his antagonist on the wrist, which he almost cut off; but this did not prevent him from continuing the fight, after he had been dressed and taken a glass or <num value="2">two</num> of wine to give him courage, when he took ample vengeance for his wound for, a little afterwards, making a feint at the ham, the tall man, stooping in order to parry it, laid his whole head open, when the little <num value="1">one</num> gave him a stroke, which took off a slice of his head and almost all his ear. For my part, I think there is an inhumanity, a barbarity, and cruelty, in permitting men to kill each other for diversion. The surgeons immediately dressed them and bound up their wounds; which being done they resumed the combat, and both being sensible of their respective disadvantages, they therefore were a long time without giving or receiving a wound, which was the cause that the little <num value="1">one</num>, failing to parry so exactly, being tired with this long battle, received a stroke on his wounded wrist, which dividing the sinews, he remained vanquished, and the tall conqueror received the applause of the spectators. For my part, I should have had more pleasure in seeing the battle of the bears and dogs, which was fought the following day on the same theatre.</QUOTE>
 
<p>It does not appear at what time the bear-baiting was destroyed, but it was probably not long after the above period. Strype, in is <num value="1">first</num> edition of Stow, published <datestruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></datestruct>, speaking of Bear-alley on this spot, says,  <QUOTE>Here is a glass-house, and about the midd a new-built court, well inhabited, called Bear-garden-square so called, as being built in the place where the Bear-garden formerly stood, until removed to the other side of the water; which is more convenient for the butchers and such like, who are taken with such rustic sports as the baiting of bears and bulls.</QUOTE>  The theatre was evidently destroyed to build this their new court.<NOTE><BIBL>Lond.

<p>The above wood-cut is a correct representation of this theatre, copied from an engraved view of London, made about the year <datestruct value="1612"><year reg="1612">1612</year></datestruct>. A very rude wood-cut of this edifice appears in Malone's Shakspeare from the long Antwerp view of London, in the Pepysian library at Cambridge; but from the coarseness of the execution, it gives a very inadequate idea. 
<p>The Globe was a public theatre of considerable size, situated on the Bankside, the southern side of the Thames, nearly opposite to Friday-street, Cheapside; and the performances always took place in summer, and by day-light. It is not certain when it was built. Hentzner, the German traveller, who gives an amusing description of London in the time of queen Elizabeth, alludes to it as existing in <datestruct value="1698--"><year reg="1698">1698</year></datestruct>, but it was probably not built long before <datestruct value="1596--"><year reg="1596">1596</year></datestruct>. It was an hexagonal wooden building, partly open to the weather, and partly thatched with reeds, on which a pole with a flag was erected, to give notice that the entertainments were going on. It was called the Globe from its sign, which was a figure of Hercules, or Atlas, supporting the globe, under which was written: <foreign lang=la>Totus mundus agit histrionem</foreign> (all the world acts a play). This theatre was burnt down <datestruct VALUE="1613-06-29"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg=29>29</day>, <year reg=1613>1613</year></datestruct>. The above view represents it previously to the conflagration. The following account of this accident is given by sir Henry Wotton, in a letter dated <datestruct VALUE="1613-07-2"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg=2>2</day>, <year reg=1613>1613</year></datestruct>, Reliq. Wotton, p. <num value="425">425</num>, edit. <datestruct value="1685--"><year reg="1685">1685</year></datestruct>:  <QUOTE>Now to let matters of state sleepe, I will entertain you at the present with what happened this week at the Banks side. The king's players had a new play, called All is True, representing some principal pieces of the reign of Henry the <num value="8">Eighth</num>, which set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and majesty, even to the matting of the stage: the knights of the order with their Georges and Garter, the guards with their embroidered coats, and the like: sufficient, in truth, within a while to make greatness very familiar, if not ridiculous. Now king Henry making <pb id="p.522" n="522"> a masque at the cardinal Wolsey's house, and certain cannons being shot off at his entry, some of the paper, or other stuff, wherwith <num value="1">one</num> of them was stopped, did light on the thatch, where being thought at <num value="1">first</num> but an idle smoak, and their eyes more attentive to the show, it kindled inwardly, and ran round like a train, consuming within less than an hour the whole house to the very ground. This was the fatal period of that virtuous fabrick, wherein yet nothing did perish but wood and straw, and a few forsaken cloaks; only <num value="1">one</num> man had his breeches set on fire, that would perhaps have broiled him if he had not by the benefit of a provident wit put it out with a bottle of ale.</QUOTE>

<p>Taylor, the water poet, commemorates the event in the following lines: 
<QUOTE rend=blockquote><L>As gold is better that in fire's tried, 
<L>So is the Bankside Globe, that late was burn'd; 
<L>For where before it had a thatched hide, 
<L>Now to a stately theatre &lsquo;tis turn'd; 
<L>Which is an emblem that great things are won 
<L>By those that dare through greatest dangers run.</QUOTE>
 
<p>It is also alluded to in some verses by Ben Jonson, entitled,  <QUOTE>An Execration upon Vulcan;</QUOTE>  from which it appears, that he was in the theatre when it was burnt. It was rebuilt in <datestruct value="1614--"><year reg="1614">1614</year></datestruct>, and decorated with more ornament than was bestowed on the former theatre.

<p>This beautifying was of little use; for, in <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>, the building was found to be in so ruinous a state, that it was wholly taken down, and the present hall erected in its place, where the lord mayor, <foreign lang=la>pro forma</foreign>, opens the sessions under the city charter, and adjourns.

<div2 type=section id="c.20.12"><HEAD>The Borough Market.</HEAD>
 
<p>The charter of king Edward VI. anno <num value="4">4</num>, granted to the mayor, commonalty, and citizens of London, a market to be holden in the borough of Southwark, which was confirmed by this act. This was in the street between London-bridge and St. Margaret's-hill; but that place was at length found so inconvenient, that an act was obtained, in <datestruct value="1755--"><year reg="1755">1755</year></datestruct>, <num value="28">28</num> George II. c. <num value="9">9</num>, that from Lady-day, <datestruct value="1756--"><year reg="1756">1756</year></datestruct>, no market should be held in the High-street; this act seems to have stopped there, for in the same year another act was passed, c. <num value="23">23</num>, directing that it should be removed from thence to a place called the Triangle, being on the site of Rochester-yard, belonging to the bishop of Rochester, who, and his successors, were empowered, on a surrender of the whole estate, to grant it in separate leases, whereupon so much thereof, as was necessary for the purpose, was granted to the churchwardens, &amp;c. of St. Saviour's, at a rent of <measure value="14l. 13s. 6d." type=Currency><num value="14">14</num>l. <num value="13">13</num>s. <num value="6">6</num>d.</measure>: no provision, except hay or straw, were to be sold within <num value="1000">1,000</num> yards of the spot, unless by the consent of the churchwardens and overseers; the ground so to be purchased, and--all buildings, stalls, &amp;c. and the rents and profits were to be vested in the churchwardens, overseers, and inhabitants of the parish, and the nett profits, after all expenses paid, were to be applied in diminution of any of the parochial rates or assessments. 
<p>A convenient market-house was accordingly built, and a piece of ground, upwards of <num value="230">230</num> feet in length, was appropriated for the standing of carts bringing fruits, vegetables, &amp;c. The tolls of the market, and the profits arising from the standings, were let from time <pb id="p.527" n="527"> to time. In the advertisement for this purpose, it is stated, that no person bringing vegetables to Winchester stairs, near London bridge, have a right to land them without paying wharfage. 
<p>In <datestruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></datestruct>, part of the market was let for <measure value="53l." type=currency><num value="53">53</num>l.</measure>, the lease expiring in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>; <datestruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></datestruct>, other part for <measure value="84l." type=currency><num value="84">84</num>l.</measure>, lease expiring <datestruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></datestruct>; <datestruct value="1801--"><year reg="1801">1801</year></datestruct>, the market <measure value="1000l." type=currency><num value="1000">1,000</num>l.</measure> 
<p>The leases having expired, a new and commodious market was erected, with a sunk area and spacious lofts. The whole is divided into walks, the roof being supported by cast-iron pillars. In the centre is a spacious room for transacting business, surmounted by a handsome cupola enriched with Corinthian columns, and a good clock. 
<p>In Deadman's-place, on the west side of this market, is a hospital, or college, founded in the reign of Elizabeth, by Thomas Cure, and called

<p>In <datestruct value="1584--"><year reg="1584">1584</year></datestruct>, this college was founded by Thomas Cure, esq. sadler to king Edward VI. queen Mary, and queen Elizabeth, and who several times represented this borough in parliament. The number of poor to be received therein was <num value="16">sixteen</num>. He appointed the chief justice of the Common Pleas for the time being to be president, and gave him the nomination of <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="16">sixteen</num> out of the poor of this parish. <num value="1">One</num> other to be chosen by the churchwardens, or <num value="4">four</num> of the governors within the borough and parish; the remaining <num value="14">fourteen</num> to be of the parish of St. Saviour, within the borough of Southwark; whereof <num value="4">four</num> to be taken out of the Liberty of the Clink and Paris-garden, and the remaining <num value="10">ten</num> within the borough and parish. The electors were to be, <num value="1">1</num>. The parson, vicar, curate, minister, or by whatever name he might be called, that should be incumbent and resident in the parish for the celebration of divine worship, and for the administration of the sacrament; and not he that should <hi rend=italics>bear the name and live absent</hi>; then the churchwardens, <num value="12">twelve</num> of the ancientest and discreetest vestrymen (and sidesmen, if any such) the collectors for the poor, and the constables of the parish within the liberty of Southwark. He gives a long description of the persons who should be eligible, and of the manner of their election and admission, and the government of the college. Each was to receive <measure value="20d." type=currency><num value="20">20</num>d.</measure> per week; they were to choose from among themselves a warden, and sub-warden: prayers to be said every morning and evening. The following fees were to be paid out of the rents: to the lord chief justice of the Common Pleas, president of the college, <num value="1">one</num> pair of gloves, of the price of <measure value="3s. 4d." type=Currency><num value="3">3</num>s. <num value="4">4</num>d.</measure> yearly, on the day of Michaelmas term, at his house or chamber in London, to be presented to him by <num value="1">one</num> of the poor of the college, to be appointed by the governors or paymaster; to the governors yearly <measure value="20s." type=currency><num value="20">20</num>s.</measure> to be spent by them amongst their brethren, the vestrymen, at the time of their accompts of receipts and payments; the <pb id="p.528" n="528"> paymasters <measure value="30s." type=currency><num value="30">30</num>s.</measure>; the clerk to keep the books of accompt, <measure value="1l. 6s. 8d." type=Currency><num value="1">1</num>l. <num value="6">6</num>s. <num value="8">8</num>d.</measure>; the minister resident in St. Saviour, <measure value="10s." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>s.</measure> so long as he shall take pains to instruct the poor at the college in needful points of religion; to <num value="1">one</num> of the constables <measure value="5s." type=currency><num value="5">5</num>s.</measure>; the residue of the rents to repair the buildings, put out the children of these poor people, or to the most needy amongst themselves, baying billets, faggots, or coals; and if a surplus, to buy gowns and other necessaries. 
<p>Mr. Cure's son and Mrs. Appleyard made some addition to the weekly allowance. 
<p>Of these statutes there is a copy in the hands of the college warden, beautifully written on vellum, the capital letters in leaf gold, making a quarto volume, bound in red morocco, the leaves gilt on the edges, the covers ornamented. Unfortunately it has been much injured by dirty fingers, defacings, and erasures; the latter of which, it is remarkable, have been practised where the amount of the annual rent has been mentioned.

<p>About the year <datestruct value="1690"><year reg="1690">1690</year></datestruct>, it was occupied on a small scale by Mr. Halsey. It was enlarged by his nephew, Mr. Ralph Thrale, whose son and successor was Mr. Henry Thrale, much better known by the intimacy that subsisted for many years between him, his wife, and Dr. Johnson.

<p>The number of persons employed in the different departments of this business are about <num value="200">200</num> ; of carriages about <num value="60">60</num>. 
<p>These buildings escaped destruction by lord George Gordon's mob, through the presence of mind of Mr. Perkins, who led away those frantic rioters by a dexterous manoeuvre of lending them a horse to draw some things which they were dragging themselves, and leading them to a public house, where he gave them plenty of porter.

The walls are finished with a modillion cornice surmounted by a low parapet. The east front has a large arch in the centre, partly occupied by a wall, and in other parts by a palladian window; on each side of this are doorways, with pediments surmounted by windows of a similar character with the flanks. The elevation is finished with the continued modillion cornice and a pediment; in the tympanum a circular window. All the angles of the church are rusticated, and the roof is covered with slate. The interior shews an unbroken area, and in consequence has a plain naked appearance; the walls are finished by a cornice, on which rests an horizontal ceiling; it is pannelled, having a large square in the centre, enriched with guillochi, and an expanded flower in the middle; around it are parallelograms and square pannels. A gallery occupies the west, north, and south sides; the front is oak, pannelled and sustained on iron columns; the south and north sides of the gallery were erectedin <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, and the fronts are so well assimilated with the original western gallery, as to appear the work of <num value="1">one</num> period. At the west end are <num value="2">two</num> additional galleries in recesses, formed over the vestry and lobby, which contain seats for the charity children. The altar screen is very plain, it is painted to imitate verd antique, and is divided by antae into compartments, bearing the usual inscriptions, and crowned with an entablature and elliptical pediment; the pulpit and desks are grouped on the south side of the central aisle; the former is hexagonal with pannelled fronts, it has a sounding board and ogee canopy of the same form, resting on <num value="2">two</num> Corinthian columns. The organ is placed in the western gallery, the case is very plain. The font is a neat marble basin. On the front of the <pb id="p.531" n="531"> western gallery is an inscription, stating that the north and south galleries were erected in <datestruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></datestruct>, at the charge of the parishioners. The great east window contains some ornamental stained glass, and a painting of the descending dove; in the side ones are the following coats of arms: north of the altar, the see of Winchester impaled with <hi rend=italics>argent</hi>, a lion rampant sa. crowned or, the whole encircled in the garter, and surmounted with a mitre, being the arms of bishop Morley, who consecrated the church on its erection in <datestruct value="1671--"><year reg="1671">1671</year></datestruct>.

A greyhound sejant <hi rend=italics>ar.</hi> gorged, with a collar gu. ringed or, resting his dexter foot on a buck's head, cabossed of the <num value="2">second</num>, the arms of Marshall. This church was laid open to the street by the removal of a row of houses which stood on the present pathway, between the years <datestruct value="1818--"><year reg=1818>1818</year></datestruct> and <datestruct value="1819--"><year reg=1819>1819</year></datestruct>, and the present iron railing was then erected. Before then the regular approach to the church was by Bennett-street. The churchyard was enlarged by the addition of a large piece of ground south west of the church, which was obtained by pulling down several houses in <datestruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></datestruct>. 
<p>In the church yard is a plain stone to the memory of Thomas Wyon, esq. chief engraver of his majesty's Mint, died <datestruct VALUE="1817-09-22"><month reg="09">Sept.</month> <day reg=22>22</day>, <year reg=1817>1817</year></datestruct>, aged <num value="25">25</num>. This gentleman, as the inscription records,  <QUOTE>was distinguished in his professional pursuit by genius, persevering application, and superior abilities; he rapidly arose to eminence, and the early close of his life has deprived his country of services not more splendid than valuable.</QUOTE>  
<p>In this parish is a charity school for <num value="30">thirty</num> boys and <num value="20">twenty</num> girls, maintained by subscription, a workhouse, and a neat alms-house, in Church-street, founded about the year <datestruct value="1730"><year reg="1730">1730</year></datestruct>, by Charles Hopton, esq. for <num value="26">twenty-six</num> decayed housekeepers, each of whom has an upper and lower room, with <measure value="10l." type=currency><num value="10">10</num>l.</measure> per annum and a chaldron of coals. 
<div2 type=section id="c.21.2"><HEAD>The Protestant Dissenters' Chapel.</HEAD>
 
<p>This building, which stands on the south side of Stamford-street, affords a solitary instance of a Dissenters' meeting-house possessing claims to attention for its architectural character. The principal front, which projects a small degree before the adjacent houses, is composed of a hexastyle portico of the Doric order: The columns are of the most magnificent proportions of Grecian architecture, and the entablature is of a corresponding character; where it enters the walls of the main building, it is received upon antae of slight projection; the whole is crowned with a pediment; there is but <num value="1">one</num> entrance, which has a lintelled frontispiece; the whole design is chaste and grand, and it is only to be regretted that it does not occupy a more commanding situation. The interior of the chapel is very plain; the pulpit is situated opposite the entrance, between <num value="2">two</num> Doric columns, on a recess. This chapel was erected in <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>. The congregation assembling here are independent Dissenters of the Unitarian persuasion. <pb id="p.532" n="532"> 
<p>At the foot of Blackfriars-bridge is a range of buildings, which formerly constituted part of the Albion-mills. This extensive concern was set on foot by a company of spirited and opulent individuals, with a view to counteract the impositions but too frequently practised in the grinding of corn. It was furnished with a steam engine, contrived by Messrs. Boulton and Watt of Birmingham, which turned <num value="10">ten</num> pair of stones, each grinding <num value="9">nine</num> bushels of corn in an hour without intermission, day or night; besides which it gave motion to the various apparatus for hoisting and lowering the corn and flour into and out of the barges, for fanning the corn to keep it free from impurities, and for sifting and dressing the meal, from its <num value="1">first</num> state, till perfectly cleared for the use of the baker. On the <num value="3">3</num>d of <datestruct VALUE="1791-03--"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>, the whole building, with the exception of the corner wing, occupied as the house and offices of the superintendant, was reduced to ashes, together with <num value="4000">4,000</num> sacks of flour which it contained. The front remained for many years unrepaired, but was subsequently formed into a row of handsome private habitations. 
<p>On the opposite side of Albion-place is the house belonging to the British Plate Glass Manufactory. This company, incorporated by act of parliament in <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct>, carry on a flourishing concern here, and at their works at Ravenhead in Lancashire. 
<p>On the west side of Blackfriars-road, very near the bridge, is the building a few years since occupied by the Museum, collected by the late sir Ashton Lever, and removed hither from Leicester-square, when it became the property of Mr. Parkinson. This curious, extensive, and valuable collection here experienced the most mortifying neglect, till in <datestruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></datestruct> it was finally dispersed by public auction, in a sale which lasted <num value="40">forty</num> days. The premises were subsequently occupied by the Surrey Institution. 
<p>In the year <datestruct value="1807"><year reg="1807">1807</year></datestruct>, some gentlemen proposed to form an institution on the Surrey side of the river, on a plan similar to that called the Royal Institution in Albemarle-street. It was intended to have a series of lectures, an extensive library and reading-rooms, a chemical laboratory and philosophical apparatus, and a supplementary library of books to be taken home by subscribers. 
<p>Their <num value="1">first</num> meetings were at the London coffee-house, on Ludgate-hill. Subscribers were to pay <num value="30">thirty</num> guineas, and become joint proprietors. They agreed for the lease of the house near the foot of Blackfriars-bridge, in which Mr. Parkinson had exhibited the Leverian museum. In <datestruct VALUE="1808-12--"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>, they had filled up a spacious room as a library, a theatre for lectures capable of containing <num value="500">500</num> persons, and a laboratory with the necessary apparatus. Dr Adam Clark was chosen principal librarian and secretary, with a salary and apartments in the house; Mr. Accum offered a gratuitous course of lectures on mineralogy, and Mr John Jackson was engaged to deliver a course of lectures on natural philosophy and chemistry. At this time <num value="719">719</num> shares were subscribed for by <num value="458">458</num> proprietors. <pb id="p.533" n="533"> 
<p>In <datestruct VALUE="1809-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1809">1809</year></datestruct>, Dr. Clark resigned his situation, retaining the title of honorary librarian, and Mr. Knight Spencer offered his services as resident secretary, without a salary, on having the apartments of the principal librarian, with the appendages; which offer was accepted. In <datestruct VALUE="1810-05--"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, the library consisted of <num value="5084">5,084</num> volumes, in <num value="19">nineteen</num> classes. 
<p>In <datestruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></datestruct>, this valuable institution was dissolved, the library, &amp;c. being sold by auction: since that time it has been occupied as wine and concert rooms, and is at present opened with a panoramic view of the battle of Navarino. 
<p>The Surrey Chapel, on the east side of Blackfriars-road, is a large octagon building, for the use of protestants of the Methodist persuasion, and was erected by the friends of the worthy but eccentric Rowland Hill, who here preaches to very crowded auditories. The structure is well adapted for the purpose of hearing, and is capable of holding near <num value="5000">5,000</num> persons. The organ, by Elliot, is not more remarkable for the sweetness of its tone than for the extent of its powers; which are so great, that in <num value="1">one</num> of the hymns descriptive of thunder, many of the congregation are said to have fainted. 
<p>The Swan theatre was the most westerly of all the playhouses on the Bankside, and must have stood at no great distance from the Surrey end of Blackfriars-bridge. It was a large house, and flourished only a few years, being suppressed at the commencement of the civil wars, and soon afterwards demolished. 
<p>On the site of Messrs. Pellatt and Green's extensive glass-works, was formerly situated an old house, called Holland's Leaguer. This house was originally the manor-house belonging to the manor of Paris-garden, which adjoins westward that of Southwark, and included the Clink liberty and the parish of Christ-church. It was anciently part of the possessions of Bermondsey abbey, and was for some time  <QUOTE>with a mill and other appurtenances,</QUOTE>  held of that monastery by the knights templars. On the dissolution of monastic establishments it came to the crown, and about the middle of the reign of Elizabeth was exchanged away to lord Hunsdon. Subsequently it fell into the hands of Thomas Cure, esq. (buried in St. Saviour's church) Richard Taverner, &amp;c. About <datestruct value="1655--"><year reg="1655">1655</year></datestruct>, it was known by the name of  <QUOTE>Holland's Leaguer.</QUOTE>  Among the collection of rare plays in the British Museum, is <num value="1">one</num> by Shackerly Marmion, called  <QUOTE>Holland's Leaguer,</QUOTE>  from which we have some clue to the state of this place and neighbourhood in the middle of the <num value="17">seventeenth</num> century. After describing the mistress of this house, an old procuress, called Donna Hollandia, as having been routed from a former residence, and just escaped from Newgate, he makes her seek for a more convenient place where she might carry on her profession, which she ultimately finds in the then untenanted and deserted manor-house of Paris-garden. <pb id="p.534" n="534"> 
<p>After describing the house, which appears to have been moated, the rest of this tract is taken up with a list of the ladies of the mansion, and of its being beleagured or besieged by the police. The old mansion was taken down about the time of forming the road from Blackfriars-bridge to the Obelisk. 
<p>It is worthy of remark that the great sir Christopher Wren had a house next door to the Falcon Inn, from which he could view at a distance the progress made in the building of St. Paul's cathedral.

<p>The meagre notice of London in the Domesday-book would seem to imply that some separate account of this capital was taken, and afterwards lost; and Strype's Stow, vol. i. speaks of a Domesday in Saxon, being a register sometime kept in Guildhall, of the laws of London and of the Portgreves. 
<p>In the earliest account of London that is any wise particular, and now extant, is intituled, <title lang=la> Descriptio nobilissimae Civitatis Londoniae</title>, which was <num value="1">first</num> published entire by Stow in <datestruct value="1591--"><year reg="1591">1591</year></datestruct>, as an appendix to his Survey of London. Strype afterwards corrected it in his edition of Stow's Survey, from a manuscript in the city archives. Hearne re-published it, with observations and notes, at the end of the <num value="8">eighth</num> volume of Leland's Itinerary, from a more correct manuscript on vellum in the Bodleian library. It was again published in the <title lang=la>Historiae Anglicanae Scriptores</title>, by Mr. Sparke, from a fine manuscript of his own, collated with <num value="1">one</num> in the Cottonian library.

<p>P. <num value="59">59</num>. On the north side of St. Anne's-lane, adjoining St. Anne's church, is the school-house of the St. Anne's Society. It is a neat building of brick from the designs of J.

This has been found to act as an effectual stimulus to exertion, as well as an encouragement to good conduct; and the rest are elected by ballot amongst the subscribers at large.

They are thus shielded from the contaminating effects of depraved and <pb id="p.557" n="557"> dissolute habits too prevalent among the poor, and which, it is to be lamented, form a serious but unavoidable evil attendant on common day-schools.

<p>Charles II. by the grace of God, king of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, in the <num value="18">18th</num> year of his reign, aided by the councellors of his realm; when the whole city was nearly destroyed, restored it on a more extensive scale than before, and not as formerly of wood and clay, but partly of brick and partly of marble, and so adorned and improved it, that it rose from its ruins, more beautiful and resplendent; besides the buildings and suburbs of the city being increased to an immense extent; in everlasting remembrance of this, on the spot where the flame of so great desolation <num value="1">first</num> burnt forth, have erected this monument.

<p>In bringing to a conclusion my History of London, Westminster, and Southwark, I should be ungrateful were I not to acknowledge the assistance I have received at the hands of numerous friends and well wishers. 
<p>To E. I. Carlos, esq. I am indebted for the valuable series of architectural surveys of the churches and public buildings of the metropolis, which have graced the preceding volumes. My readers, will, I am certain agree, that the critical taste of this gentleman is not less conspicuous than his extensive knowledge of the architecture of our ancestors. 
<p>To the following gentlemen, I tender my sincere thanks:-- 
<p>To J. Caley, esq. F. R. S., F. S. A,, &amp;c., J. Keech, S. Gregory, and R. Chambers. 
<p>In ALDERSGATE WARD. To J. A. Aubert, esq.; Mr. Stacey, secretary to the City of London Literary and Scientific Institution; and Mr. Sheldrake. 
<p>To the Rev. Dr. S. Hirschell who has obliged me with information respecting the various synagogues in the ward of Aldgate. 
<p>In BASSISHAW WARD. To J. Smith, esq. clerk of the company of Coopers. 
<p>BILLINGSGATE. To the warden and court of assistants of the worshipful company of Watermen. 
<p>To T. King, clerk of the Marine Society; C. Bleaden, and I. Peacock, esqrs.; Mr. Meesom; Mr. Williams, St. Helens; and Mr. W. Manley, clerk of the Friends' Meeting-house, Houndsditch, rendered me every service in their power, in the ward of Bishopsgate. 
<p>BREAD-STREET. To J. Millard, esq. clerk of the worshipful company of Cordwainers. 
<p>J. D. Towse, clerk of the worshipful company of Fishmonges, claims my special thanks for his kindness in allowing the drawing to be made from sir William Walworth's dagger, and for other favours. 
<p>BROAD-STREET. To the clerk of the worshipful company of Merchant Taylors; N. Simpson, secretary of the South-sea company; and to the master, wardens, and court of assistants of the worshipful company of Drapers, I beg to tender thanks. 
<p>To G. G. Young, esq. F. S. A. York herald, and Mr. Hood, ward-clerk, who liberally gave every information required in the ward of Castle Baynard. 
<p>CHEAP. To J. Sutton, esq. and C. W. Hick, esq. I am indebted for permission to view and describe the interior of Mercers'-hall; the clerk of the company, J. Barnes, esq. having declined allowing the author to see the hall; conceiving  <QUOTE>a survey of the metropolis as perfectly useless.</QUOTE>  I beg also to return my thanks to J. Gwilt, esq. F. S. A., and H. Schultes, esq. of the Irish chamber. <pb id="p.562" n="562"> 
<p>COLEMAN-STREET. To the master and clerk of the worshipful company of Braziers, W. Upcott, and C. F. Partington, esqrs. I am indebted for many acts of friendship. 
<p>To C. W. Hick, and J. Ralph, esqrs., to whom I am indebted for liberty to describe the curious crypt of Bow-church, &amp;c. in Cordwainer's ward. 
<p>CORNHILL. To I. P. Adderley, esq. 
<p>CRIPPLEGATE. To G. Crompe, esq.; the rev. R. Watts, librarian of Sion college; H. Knapp, esq. clerk of the worshipful company of Haberdashers; M. Gregory, esq. clerk of the worshipful company of Waxchandlers; and Mr. Spencer, the late governor of the New Prison. 
<p>DOWGATE. To R. Monk, esq. ; J. Luttley, esq. clerk of the worshipful company of Dyers; and the rev. I. W. Bellamy, master of Merchant Taylor's School; I return my best thanks. 
<p>To J. Shaw, esq. architect, the rev. G. A. Hatch, rector of St. Matthew, Friday-street. J. Harms, esq.; R. Auld, esq. secretary of the Scottish Hospital; and M. Field, esq. librarian of the Medical Institution, who assisted me materially in the wards of Farringdon. 
<p>To W. Smith, esq. clerk of the Hudson's Bay company. 
<p>QUEENHITHE. To P. N. Tomlins, esq. clerk of the worshipful company of Painter-stainers. 
<p>G. Crompe, esq. clerk of the worshipful company of Clothworkers; J. Carter. esq.; and the ward clerk, afforded me much information in the ward of Tower street. 
<p>VINTRY. To the clerk of the worshipful company of Cutlers; C. Martin, esq. clerk of the worshipful company of Vintners; and to the rev. F. Muth, minister of the German Catholic chapel; I beg to tender my thanks. 
<p>In the city of WESTMINSTER, I had fewer particulars to gather than in London; there being no places of consequence but what are open to the public: the remainder are generally private edifices, or residences into which I had no business to intrude. 
<p>In SOUTHWARK, I beg to return my thanks to R. Lindsay, esq. and G. Gwilt, esq. F. S. A. for numerous acts of kindness. 
<p>In conclusion, my thanks are due to my engraver, Mr. Berryman, for the talent he has displayed in the wood department. 
<p>The public have, I trust, been gratified with my efforts to produce a concise history and view of the metropolis; a task of no ordinary difficulty, when it is considered that every season adds to it new features. I am aware I have but pursued the same dull path others have trodden before me; but the labour of obtaining and authenticating facts is ever tedious, and often difficult, and as on this point I have been scrupulously particular, I am not without hopes that my industry and research will avail me before the tribunal of public opinion. </TEXT></TEI.2>
