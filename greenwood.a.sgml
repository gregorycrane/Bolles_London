<head> PREFACE.</head>
<p>CROPPING up in the book-field, modest and unpretending as any sprig of sorrel or chickweed that ever
sprouted, this book at least claims an advantage over
other books in the matter of Preface.
<p> Commonly, a Preface is like a finger-post set up in a
toll-road, on which you first pay for the privilege of
travelling, and then are allowed to judge for yourself
whether the way indicated will suit you, or whether it
will be more profitable to turn back, forfeiting the
money you paid at the gate, and striking into another
path in search of "pastures new." The advantage
alluded to as attaching to this book, consists in the fact
that its preface is fully contained in the title imprinted
on the back of it. There is no more to be said about
it. It is simply a collection of personal observation of
experience yielded in the course of two-score or so of as
unsentimental journeys as ever were undertaken by the
most ordinary tramp. The collection is the result, not
of a labour of love purely-although, of course, a liking
for the subject was the prime inducement for entering
on its investigation,-but of down-right, jog-trot
journey-work.
<p>The reader who regards elegance of style in an
author as the first essential is respectfully warned that
herein it is wanting-so completely, in fact, that it is
scarcely worth while to mention it; it would have been
discovered as quickly. If, however, the indulgent
reader will deign to accept scrupulous honesty and
plain, outspoken truth in lieu of varnish and elaboration, he may depend on fair dealing at the hands of his
obedient servant,
<p>THE AUTHOR.

<head>I.
THE HOSPITAL-GATE.</head>
<p>
THE notice-board at the gate notifies to all who
may have come into that inheritance to which
we have Shakspeare's authority for declaring
all flesh has title, that the proper time to attend
to be mulct as far as may be of the said
inheritance is between the hours of eleven and one o'clock
daily. Therefore, as the hospital clock chimed the former
time, I struck out of <placeName>Giltspur Street</placeName>, and approached the
sombre building; not, my lucky stars be thanked, as one
needing aid of surgeon or apothecary, but to see one of
the most melancholy and instructive pictures to be met
in London's length and breadth. Being an intruder, and
not disposed to flaunt my healthfulness to the dull and
sorrowing gaze of those who clustered at the portal, I took
my station in the shadowy lee of a fragrant hay waggon,
and, sitting down on the deserted shaft of it, secured a
fair view of up the street and down the street, and across
the road.
<p> I experienced little difficulty in distinguishing from
among the pedestrians who thronged the pavement they
who had business with Saint Bartholomew; for the notice-
board, among other things, particularly stipulated that
"patients must provide themselves with gallipots and
bottles ;" and, as a rule, the pale ones, and the lame ones,
and they who were led because they could not see, were
so provided. Gracious me! what a leveller of pride is
Death's lieutenant, Sickness ! Here comes Jones, worthy
man, meekly bearing his gallipot, wrapped in paper, it is
<pb n="2" id="p.2">
true, but palpably a gallipot, whereas, if he were unafflicted
and free to perform as usual the diurnal journey out and
home from Islington to the City, he would go dinnerless
rather than be the bearer of his own mutton chop. Likewise comes estimable Mr. Robinson, who, before his
system was shocked beyond the pomps and vanities of
this wicked world, disdained to carry so vulgar an article
as a gingham umbrella (perhaps that is how he caught
his rheumatism, poor man), now exhibits, peeping from
the tail-pocket of his coat, the throat of the quart bottle
that is to contain his "mixture."
<p> The respectable Browns or Joneses, however, are scarcely
fair samples of the patrons of Saint Bartholomew: if their
ailments are not very severe, their "regular" doctor will
set them right for a pound or so, and they can afford to
pay it, Neither is the wan army recruited specially from
the squalid, loud-mouthed poverty of the City; it is the
latter! that obstructs the doorway and invades the narrow
limits of the "parish" surgery, for the most cogent reason that bread and meat may be included in the parochial
M.D.'s prescriptions, and lazy father's bad foot, or sister
Polly's asthma be thus made a source of income rather
than of impoverishment to the entire family. It is chiefly
those whom no amount of hunger would induce to beg a
loaf that demand hospital relief; who would go empty
and thinly clad, and no more dream of applying at a
workhouse for alms than they would dream of assuaging
their distress by a larcenous onslaught on their neighbours' goods. The horny-handed ones are these, and the
horny-handed ones' wives, who while they can work will,
and at whose door, while health holds good, "the wolf,"
or its shadow even, is unknown. It is sickness alone
that gives the grim beast ingress; and there he is allowed
to stay, roaming about the house, and ravaging it, plucking the treasured silk gown from its sacred hiding, the
hard-earned watch from the fob, the Sunday suit from
the clothes - chest, the well-worn wedding-ring even from
the lean finger; and the number of the house where the
wolf is sojourning being 31, neither 30 nor 32 have the
least suspicion of the fact. Nobody is aware of it; least
<pb n="3" id="p.3">
of all any gentleman in the neighbourhood whose business it is to vend advice and healing drugs at a profit.
Not a penny of the wolf's plunderings goes to him. Why
should it ? The healing skill to be found at the hospital
is of a higher order than can be bought for a little money,
and there is no taint of pauperism in partaking of the advantage. The hospital is public property-as proper a
place for a man to visit for relief for his malady as the
<placeName>British Museum</placeName> or the <placeName>National Gallery</placeName> for amusement
and instruction, or the common to play cricket on. So
argue the honest endurers of the wolf at number 31, and,
without doubt, they are perfectly correct.
<p> Whilst, however, I sit philosophising on the waggon-
shaft the human cluster at the gate has grown thicker.
Along the broad steps sit mothers cuddling to their bosoms
sick infants, varying in age from the tiny creature ignorant of a want beyond to the languid little fellow of four
or five whom affliction has once more reduced to babyhood. Why the mothers sit here I do not know. Perhaps
the gentleman appointed to the sick-baby department has
not yet arrived, or, having arrived, is so besieged with
mothers that these considerate ones prefer sitting in the
sun with their darlings till the press has abated and they
can take them in without disturbance. Perhaps, again,
having so nearly reached the terrible place where for their
health's sake the poor little sufferers must be put to pain,
mother's tender heart fails her, and she is obliged to sit
thus on the threshold to consider her little one's long-
suffering, and to contemplate its wasting face, to screw
her courage for the final effort.
<p> No wonder if it is so, since from my post of observation
I can see grown men and women, and tall young men and
maidens, guilty of the same weakness. I am quite convinced that the pulling of teeth is not the most painful
operation to which a hospital patient may be subjected;
and yet, of all who " hang on and off," as the nautical
phrase is, loitering among the deserted cattle-pens, and
looking wistfully and alternately at the grim building
and at the road that tends homeward, the ones with bandaged jaws numbered most. Of course their case is very
<pb n="4" id="p.4">
hard (having had in my time two grinders extracted whose
decay in no way shook their attachment to me; I know
how hard their case is); but what amount of pity could
be spared for them in presence of the terrible things that
everywhere met the eye ? The pains as well as the pleasures of the world can only be measured by comparison.
By the side of a shattered limb toothache becomes a mere
trifle; and, compared with many of the appalling spectacles to be met within a circuit of a hundred yards of
Old Bartholomew any day between the hours of eleven
and two, it becomes less than a trifle-a joke, and a thing
to be laughed at.
<p>Why, within the limit mentioned, I can see a dozen
men who, if the transfer were possible, would accept the
most villainous tooth that ever a mouth was troubled with
in exchange for their ailment, and throw in as a bonus a
good year of their lives, chancing how long they would
live without it. Not the worst-looking cases either, some
of these. Take, for example, that elderly man with his
arm slung to his neck, and accompanied by his two sons,
as pale and as anxious as himself. How wretchedly
cheerful the trio are ! How the eldest of the old fellow's
boys, winking sternly at the younger to be sure and
countenance the dreadful fib he is about to relate, launches
into the particulars of a "case "-a terrible case, compared with which father's is the merest cat-scratch-in
which, thanks to the blessed application of chloroform,
the limb was shorn, the patient dreaming the pleasantest
dreams the while! And the good old boy, to comfort the
young ones, affects the most perfect belief in the story,
and even essays a ghastly little joke on the subject, while
all the time his heart is at freezing-point through thinking
that if the amputation of those blessed fingers should cost
him his life, what a woful thing it will be for Polly (his
wife) and the three little ones. But there is no help
for it; he will surely die unless he submits to the terrible ordeal; so, just a tiny nip of brandy to keep his
courage up, and in he goes, the boys looking after
him almost as people look when the undertaker's man,
twiddling his screwdriver, observes, with professional
<pb n="5" id="p.5">
melancholy, "Would any other member of the family
like," &amp;c.
"Room there, you about the gate! Ring the bell,
boy, will you?" Not the least occasion. The liveried
porter, hearing the hasty wheels, has just peeped out to
see a cab, with a policeman descending from the driving-
seat, and the next moment makes his appearance with a
companion, the two carrying a "stretcher." "Slater off
a roof!" exclaims the policeman, shortly; and, gently
handled by a dozen willing hands, as though he were a
baby, the pallid man, with his great, dirty, labouring
hands, and the slating-nails dropping from his jacket-
pocket and tinkling on the pavement, is borne through
the gate to have his shattered bones set and be brought
to life again, if the ripest skill in the kingdom can
accomplish the doubtful business.
<p>One thing is certain. The shattered slater will not
pine to death in his ward from lack of company. No
trade is better represented in the accident ward than that
of house-building. If I was in the life-assurance line I
think I would almost as soon lease the life of a soldier as
of a house-painter, a bricklayers' labourer, or a slater.
I think I would quite as soon do it, and I do not believe I
should be out of pocket by it. In his battle for bread
the latter risks his life equally with the former, who fights
his country's battles. Where is the difference ? One man
in the ranks with his comrades may catch a bullet in his
carcass; the other, sprawling on a slippery slant, with a
clear descent of forty feet to the street stones, is at the
mercy of a rotten rope or a sudden wind. The soldier,
sword in hand, pitted against another soldier, fights for
his life; the house-painter, a-top of a fifty-round ladder,
may at any minute of his working days be seized with a
vertigo, or the first drunken booby that comes up the
street may stumble against the ladder's foot, and the
poor painter in an instant make a swift descent to certain
death. In one respect the soldier has the advantage; for
whereas at least half his life is spent in consuming his
rations, pipeclaying his leathers, and washing his shirts,
the poor slater begins his battles with his apprenticeship,
<pb n="6" id="p.6">
and continues them till he becomes too old and decrepit
to mount a ladder.
<p> It is wonderful how one grows used to horrors. Shortly
after the commotion (very slight it was) consequent on
the slater's arrival had subsided, there came in succession
two " run-overs" and an Irish person severely wounded
on the head with a drinking-vessel. I was enabled, however, to regard the ugly scene with perfect equanimity,
and even cast about me for something more interesting.
I didn't look in vain. At some distance from the casual
gate there is another, and about this was a group expectant, evidently, from the way in which, every few
seconds, they peered up the archway in which a beadle
kept sentry. I was too far off to hear what they said,
but presently one, who happened to be watching at a
moment when no one else was, made a sudden observation, and then the whole party eagerly turned and looked
too, and it was easy enough to see, by the way in which
all the lips moved, that " Here he comes ! "was uttered
by them all.
<p>Who was "he"? A tall young fellow, with lanky
legs, very thin, and with a delicate, newly-made-looking
face. These were his most remarkable points, as far as I
could judge; but the watchers at the gate saw more than
this plainly, or they would never have made such a fuss
with him. He didn't come out alone. There was with
him a little elderly woman, who held his hand in hers, as
though afraid of losing him the moment they reached the
corner of the street; while, at the same time, one was
made aware, by the little woman's bright, brimming eyes,
that a more cruel thing could scarcely happen. No
sooner, however, did the odd pair approach the group
than a man with grey hair and spectacles, and a little
taller than the little woman, seized the lank young man
by the disengaged hand, and for a moment seemed
inclined to wrestle with the old lady for possession of the
prize. This, however, the old lady appeared to object to,
not unkindly, however, for she first shook hands with the
old fellow in a queer sort of way, and then, turning
broadside on to the slender young man, clutched at his
<pb n="7" id="p.7">
neck, and, pulling his face down to hers (he seemed very
supple, poor fellow!) kissed him, till he with the spectacles exclaimed in an ashamed voice, and quite loud enough
for me to hear, "Come, mother, that'll do-in the street,
you know!
<p> If it had not have happened that the way of the curious
party lay in the direction of my hay-waggon, I might
have been puzzled till my dying day to know what it all
meant. I was, however, spared that infliction, for just
as they were trooping past I heard the little grey-haired
man say,-
<p> "I'm bothered if it isn't, mother ! A year and two
months come the 23rd, and he has grown a foot if a single
inch!"
<p> The year and two months must have been the time the
young fellow had lain at Old Bartholomew's.

SQUALORS' MARKET.</head>
<p> EXACTLY opposite each other stands a church
and a gin-palace. The former is dedicated to
St. Luke, the latter to his head merely, and
stands sentinel at the corner of <placeName>Squalors'
Market</placeName>. Just as it was growing dusk, and the
potman pertaining to the palace was kindling the gorgeous
outside lamps, I passed under his tall ladder and into the
narrow and sinuous thoroughfare.
<p> The business of the evening was yet young. The
naphtha man's white horse, harnessed in the evil-smelling
cart, was still in the highway, and the naphtha man,
carrying his big can and clinking his measures, had still
a goodish many stall-keepers to serve; the secondhand
shoeseller was busily arranging along the kerb, and in
single file, his dissipated regiment of " wellingtons " and
" bluchers," administering a little more blacking to this
one to make its patches seem less patchy, and solicitously
patting and caressing that whose constitution was so
fatally undermined that, for all its blooming appearance,
it would succumb before a day's wear, and part body and
sole; the Hebrew who sold cloth caps and slippers was
idly chatting with the Hebrew who, having nicely
arranged his brummagem jewellery, had nothing else
(but customers) to do; the "unfortunate miner" was,
with his afflicted wife, partaking of a final whet of rum
at the " Black Boy" before taking their stand, their five
sleekly-combed but starving children for the present
larking in the gutter, while from out the horrible courts
<pb n="9" id="p.9">
and alleys-head-quarters of fever and pestilence--came
pouring great stores of cabbages and turnips, and fruit
and shell-fish-the latter looking none the more refreshed
for their night's repose beneath the truckle bedstead, and
the former yet tearful from their long soaking in grimy
tubs in the cellar. Besides these, there likewise streamed
out from the courts and alleys " trotters" and hot penny
puddings, and "ham sandwiches," for the delight of the
most dainty of the thousand, who would presently crowd
every inch of road and footway.
<p> Of the two hundred and twenty houses of which
<placeName>Squalors' Market</placeName> is composed, one in every thirteen is
devoted to the sale of intoxicating liquors, and it must
be borne in mind that in this calculation are not included
several public houses that, skulking in crooked chinks and
under dark archways, although deprived of the manifest
advantages enjoyed by their seventeen brethren in the
open highway, yet by means of a beckoning claw in
shape of a signboard, affixed at the mouth of the court
or alley, "To the <placeName>George and Dragon</placeName>," " Back way to
the <placeName>Chip in Porridge</placeName>," &amp;c., manage to trap many drinkers
of the sly and sneaking sort.
<p> That bread even is less in demand in Squalors' Market
than gin and beer is demonstrated by the fact that but ten
bakers' shops can there find support. The catsmeat
interest is liberally represented, no less than five establishments of that character flourishing in the market.
How is this ? Do the squalid court and alley dwellers,
with their proverbial extravagance, each keep a cat?
or- No; the supposition is too dreadful. Besides, it
should be fairly stated that the five horse-flesh dealers
vend sheep's heads, split and baked, and the livers of
bullocks, and other offal.
<p> The butchers of <placeName>Squalors' Market</placeName> number two less
than the gin and beer sellers, and are, dear reader, by no
means quiet, well-behaved creatures, such as you are
acquainted with. Your butcher wears a hat, generally a
genteel hat, and a blue coat, and a respectable apron;
perhaps, even snowy sleeves and shiny boots, and a nice
bit of linen collar above his neckerchief. You give your
<pb n="10" id="p.10">
orders and he receives them decorously, and wishes you
good morning as you quit his neatly-arranged and
sawdusted shop. Contrasted with him the butcher of
<placeName>Squalors' Market</placeName> is a madman-a raving lunatic. He
unscrews the burners of his gaspipes, and creates great
spouts of flame that roar and waver in the wind in front
of his shamble-like premises, endangering the hats of
short pedestrians and the whiskers of tall ones; far out
from his shop, and attached to roasting-jacks, revolve
monstrous pigs' heads and big joints of yellow veal,
spiked all over like a porcupine with figure-bearing
tickets, that announce the few pence per pound for which
the meat may be bought. He wears on his head a cap
made of the hairy hide of the bison or some other savage
beast; his red arms are bare to the elbows, and he roars
continuously, "Hi-hi! weigh away-weigh away! the
rosy meat at three-and-half! Hi-hi! "-clashing his
broad knife against his steel to keep time. How is it
that my butcher is charging me 9d. per lb. for leg of
mutton, while Mr. Blolam, here, is charging only 4 d. ?
Is my butcher a rogue, or is Mr. Blolam going headlong
to the debtors' prison at the end of his street ? I know
my butcher to be an honest fellow, and to judge from
appearances, Mr. B. is not the man to bring his sleek,
redhanded wife and his glossy children to grief, either by
reckless trading or excessive charity. This being the
case, let the court and alley dwellers thereabout, rather
than regret, rejoice and thank their lucky stars that they
have no money wherewith to trade with Mr. Blolam.
<p>The business of the market grows with the night. First
come the decent folk-men and their wives, with the
chief olive-branch to carry the big basket. Shrewd people
are these early birds with an eye to plump worms. It is
not, however, till it has grown quite dark, and the gas is
lit, and great tongues of naphtha flame start from crazy
lamps, and scorch and lap up the living air greedily, that
the buyers come shoaling in. Then the fruit and vegetable mongers give tongue, and roar the quality and
price of their various wares with a bullying air, and the
brummagem Hebrew jabbers of his rings and brooches;
<pb n="11" id="p.11">
and the secondhand shoeman, having beguiled a gentleman to take off his boot and " try something on," keeps
him standing on one leg in the mud (and so he will be
kept till he consents to buy a pair of shoes); and the
miner and his family, ranged in a row, chant their
necessities.
<p>Strolling through the market out of market hours the
dearth of fishmongers at once struck you. True, there
are fishshops, five or six of them, but the dealings of the
proprietors are almost entirely confined to vending the
article in a dried or fried state, one or two of them dabbling in shrimps and periwinkles. Where, however, is
the fresh fish-the plaice, the soles, the cod-of which,
according to Billingsgate statistics, at least one half of
all that comes to market is consumed by the very poorest
of the London population ? Now, however, when the
business of the market is in full blast, the question no
longer exists. Here is the fresh fish, in broad fiat wicker
baskets, slung round the neck, in solitary "pads," standing in the mud, on little boards or trestles, lit up by a
feeble candle, and on great boards, eight or ten feet
feet long and six broad, standing on substantial legs, and
lit by a great flaring naphtha lamp. The owners of these
broad boards are no mean fish-pedlars, standing dumbly
behind their wares till a customer happens to call. They
are wholesale dealers, fish auctioneers. As many people
stand round the board as would fill the largest fishmonger's shop in the metropolis. Yet, excepting a heap
of copper money-half a peck of it, probably-the board
is quite clear. Surrounding the auctioneer, however (who
is dressed in corduroy trousers and blue guernsey shirt,
the sleeves of which are rolled above the elbows of his
great hairy arms), is a large number of "pads" of
plaice, and, just behind him, is a big tub full of water.
One of his attendants (he generally has two) presently
plunges his arms into one of the "pads," brings out a
couple of fish, souses them into the water-tub, and then
hands them to his master. Without paying the least
attention to the lookers-on the man coolly proceeds to disembowel the fish, to chop through the backbone, to make
<pb n="12" id="p.12">
them handy for the frying-pan, and to thread them on a
willow twig. All this while, and unsolicited, the people
round are bidding "Threeha'pence!" "tuppence !" " two-
un-arf! " " Yours, mum," observes the laconic fishman,
handing the fish to the "two-un-arf," and proceeding
to disembowel and thread two more. It was curious to
observe the various countenances of the bidders and
buyers; the eagerness with which some women scrambled
over the heads and shoulders of their neighbours to get
at their bargains, and with a look that plainly said " the
price of these will astonish my Jack, I'll be bound;"
while others parted with their halfpence regretfully, and
as though conscious of having been a little too hasty in
their bidding. Worst of all, however, were the gaunt
women with their mites of shawls and ample aprons, and
with husband out of work and any number of children,
looking out of their anxious eyes as they watch the
cutting up of the fish, and whether it be thick or thin.
That seems a likely lot! Shall they bid? Better not,
perhaps; wait and see the next lot. So they wait till
ashamed to wait any longer, and take the "next lot"
and chance it.
<p> It is, however, a great consolation to know that these
poor mothers may at the worst depend on ample value
for their precious halfpence. Soles and plaice were the
fish chiefly dealt in by the auctioneers, and the prices
they realised were absolutely ridiculous. Soles, for a
pair of which Mr. Greves would charge half-a-crown,
were disposed of, after a by no means spirited bidding,
for threepence-halfpenny. Touching the cheapness of
plaice, I can't do better than quote an instance to which
I was an eyewitness. A monstrous fellow, broad and
thick as a turbot, was fished out of a "pad," cleaned,
gutted, and made ready for the pan, and, after all, the
price it brought was fourpence. " If you aint got him at
a 'apenny a pound it's furny to me," observed the auctioneer, and a friendly potato salesman's stall adjoining
his, he put the fish in his scales. The potato-man had no
weights of less than a pound, but the fourpenny plaice
asserted its superiority to the seven-pound weight, and
<pb n="13" id="p.13">
only consented to a balance when a large potato was
added and brought to bear against him.
<p> It is a curious fact-and one more proof of the extravagance of poverty-that in nine cases out of ten the fish
purchased was intended for the frying-pan, and not for
the pot. It was easy to ascertain this, as whenever a
bidder wanted a fish to boil, she signified the same at the
time she made her bid. " Thrippence-for bilin !" some
one would exclaim; whereon the auctioneer would arrest
the descent of his big chopping-knife, and deliver the fish
entire. Among the squalid poor the same prejudice
exists as regards mutton. Fish fried, and mutton baked
or roast, if you please; but as to boiling either, except
when ordered by the doctor, the practice is regarded as
<soCalled>namby-pamby,</soCalled> and French.
<p> This universal fish-frying is the key to another mystery common to the neighbourhood. In every " general
shop," in every rag and bone shop, in the high street,
and in the hundred courts and filthy alleys that worm in
and out of it, may be seen solid slabs of a tallowy-looking substance, and marked with a figure 6, 7, or 8, denoting that for as many pence a pound weight of the suspicious-looking slab may be obtained. It is bought in
considerable quantities by the fish-eaters for frying purposes, and is by them supposed to be simply and purely
the fat dripping of roast and baked meats, supplied to
these shops by cooks, whose perquisite it is. This, however, is a delusion. The villainous compound is manufactured. There is a "dripping-maker" near <placeName>Seabright
Street</placeName>, <placeName>Bethnal Green</placeName>, and another in <placeName>Backchurch Lane</placeName>,
<placeName>Whitechapel</placeName>, both flourishing men, and the owners of
many carts and sleek cattle. Mutton suet and boiled rice
are the chief ingredients used in the manufacture of the
slabs, the gravy of bullocks' kidneys being stirred into
the mess when it is half cold, giving to the whole a
mottled and natural appearance.
<p> "Mine uncle" of <placeName>Squalors' Market</placeName>-at least, judging
from the only specimen there to be seen-is a totally different character from that generally represented. The
pawnbroker elsewhere found is a highly respectable person,
<pb n="14" id="p.14">
 smug and decorous of mien and subdued of voice.
His shop is the shop of an ordinary dealer in jewellery
and other articles of value, and he only insinuates his real
business in the most delicate way by means of a neat
plate on his doorpost inscribed with an intimation that
he advances money on plate, jewels, &amp;c., and that he has
a fireproof room for the safe keeping of your property.
The pawnbroker before me, however, is a tall, muscular
man, with great brown hands, dressed in a shaggy pilot
coat with big bone buttons, and wearing his battered hat
well off his expressive countenance. He has none of the
modesty peculiar to the craft about him, neither is his
shop a modest one, or unobtrusive, but a broad-awake
and gas-lit place, as open as any potato-warehouse in the
market. Over the shop-front, in great yellow letters, is
inscribed the word "Pawnbroker," and the proprietor
stands in front of it-off the pavement, indeed, and in the
road-surrounded by an eager mob, and selling from a
basket old odds and ends of wearing apparel, old canvas
for towelling, any rag of any sort or shape that will fetch
even so low a sum as a penny among the squalid bidders.
" Here ye are," says he, with the voice of a Channel pilot,
as he dangles by the strings something made of flannel;
" here's a perricot! How much for the flannel perricot?
'Tant a new un, and 'tant so far gone but the sides may
be turned in the middle, and kiver a body comfortable.
Who ses sixpence ? Tuppence, eh? Thanky; s'pose
you buy taters with your money-it'll fetch more for
'ouse flannels. Goin' for fippence !-fourpence! Sold
agin, and got the money."
<p> Where had I before seen this muscular pawnbroker?
At the dog-show? In the shell-fish department at
Billingsgate? On board a bumboat at Portsmouth?
No; men very like him at each of the places mentioned,
but not he. Now I have it! That " sold again and got
the money," settled the point at once. It is a year ago,
and he wore a blue apron about his waist, and stood outside a sausage and cheap meat shop in this very market,
but the above words were the very ones he uttered as he
tossed a pickled pig's head to the young man behind the
<pb n="15" id="p.15">
counter. Now that this circumstance recurred to my
memory I no longer wondered to find my friend a pawnbroker! He had a hankering for it at the pig's head
period, and kept, besides the sausage-shop, a "leaving-shop," in Brick-lane, St. Luke's.
<p>Does the good reader know the nature of the "leaving"
business? It requires no shop; any back room, cellar,
or hovel will suffice for it, and any rascal possessed of a
few shillings can start in it. It is a business that can
flourish and grow fat in the midst of the most appalling
poverty-that does exist, and flourish, and fatten in a
thousand alleys and "slums" within the great city of
London. It is a simple matter. Being too lazy to work,
and having somehow obtained a pound, I take an apartment in a poverty-stricken locality, hang a few odds and
ends in my window or against my door-post and put up a
ticket announcing that I deal in " ladies and gentlemen's
left-off wearing apparel." Presently some "lady" from
one of the swarming alleys, hard up for bread or gin,
brings me an article of her apparel, or perhaps a pair of
still warm and muddy little boots, and requests me to
become a purchaser. But no, I am too humane for anything of the kind. "Oh, don't sell the little boots,
ma'am," say I; " take them to the pawnbroker's and
pledge them for a trifle." " Shure it's no thrifle at all I
can get on 'em at the parn-office," says my customer,
"because the heels are throd down so." "Well, look
here," says I; " I'll lend you a shilling on the boots, and
what's more, I'll keep 'em for a month, and you can have
them back any time between this and then by paying
fourteen pence for them!" The news spreads like fever,
and the existence of the new "leaving-shop" is thoroughly
knowh within a week. Within a month of setting up I
am doing a roaring trade. Everything too insignificant for
the licensed pawnbroker's round the corner is brought to
me, and I take the goods in pledge, the depositors well
understanding that unless redeemed in a month they are
forfeited. As twopence on the shilling is the long-established
rate of interest demanded at the surrounding "leaving-
shops," of course I can't exact more; however, I do as they
<pb n="16" id="p.16">
do- make up for it on smaller sums. If I lend sixpence on
a jacket, sevenpence halfpenny must be paid me before it
can be ransomed; and if I lend threepence on the Sunday
knives and forks or the Sunday baking-dish, nothing less
than fourpence halfpenny redeems it, though I may have
held it but a few days or even hours. On the whole I do
a very snug business; and, what is more, I can defy all
the Queen's orders and all the Queen's men, for how can
the law step between a man and his simple buyings and
sellings ?</div1><pb n="17" id="p.17">

III.
NEWGATE MARKET.</head>
<p> THEN we will put that down as settled," said
my friend the carcass-butcher; "you will be
at the corner of <placeName>St. Sepulchre's</placeName> at five o'clock
tomorrow morning, and I will meet you."
" Very good," replied I, and so left him.
But I thought it anything but " very good." Had
May or June been the time of year I might not have
entertained any very serious objections to a view of the
rising sun, but the prospect of witnessing the birth of a
mid-November day was quite another thing. However,
my friend talked of five o'clock with a familiarity that
bespoke so intimate an acquaintance with it, that I
was ashamed to demur or to explain that the hour in
question and myself knew so little of each other that a
meeting might possibly be embarrassing-at least to one
of us.
<p> Punctually, however, I arrived at the appointed spot,
at the same moment my friend suddenly emerged from
the darkness and confronted me with a newly-cut pencil
behind his ear, and the brightness of his blue apron already
sullied and smeared with red and white. "Come along,"
said he; "we shall have time to walk round before the
bustle begins."
<p> Crossing the road to the prison corner, we made for the
market, passing on the way a row of butchers' carts,
backed to the kerb, and with the tailboards down. West-end carts they were chiefly, as the golden legends on the
panels attested: the butchering interest of <placeName>Bethnal Green</placeName>
and <placeName>Whitecross Street</placeName> seemed to be unrepresented. My
<pb n="18" id="p.18">
guide, however, explained this by shrugging his shoulders
significantly and observing, " That sort don't need to get
here early; they can buy at any time." I observed that
the vehicles in question were mostly furnished with
portable cushions, and that the horses were generally
clothed with valuable cloths or leather loin-covers. All
alone on the dark highway stood this property, abandoned to the tender mercies of "lurchers" and "market-
snatchers." At least so I imagined, and signified to my
guide that I thought it a very stupid, not to say culpable
system, affording as it did such opportunity for theft.
My guide, however, by a mere gesture, set me right on
this head; he pointed to a figure lurking in the shadow
of the prison wall, holding in one hand a sheaf of cart
whips, and who, holding his other hand level with the
peak of his cap, kept a lynx-eye on the property entrusted
to his charge.
<p>We turned into Warwick Lane. Although the market
traffic had not yet commenced, there was considerable
noise and confusion. Railway vans thundered over the
cobble stones, and railway-van drivers were thundering
at each other, and at the market beadle, and at the
Corporation generally, such uncomplimentary language
as vexed railway-van drivers will. Certainly they were
not without grounds for vexation. <placeName>Whitehart Street</placeName>
and <placeName>Warwick Lane</placeName> are the only carriage-ways into the
market-square; and, when it is considered that the carriages are about seven feet wide, and that the roadway of
Warwick Lane is little more than ten feet, and that of
White Hart Street something less; that the vans contain
over two tons of meat; that the uneven stones, moistened
by November fog, afford to the horses' feet about as easy
footing as would a pavement of buttered rolls; and that
a market beadle (what does he know about horses ?) takes
the bridles into his hands and frantically " backs " van,
carman, and all, or endeavours to urge the perplexed
cattle forward by probing their flanks with his market
cane and uttering small canary chirpings-it is no wonder
that the carmen occasionally exhibit a little ill-temper.
This uproar, however, has its advantages-it relieves a
<pb n="19" id="p.19">
stranger's mind of the horrors that would beset it if, in
the midst of gloom and the jaundiced light that gas and
daybreak make, the vehicles were disburdened quietly
and by stealth. Breathing the air of yesterday's shambles,
the beholder would see long and broad packages, mysteriously shrouded in sackcloth, borne up dark passages
or stacked before the unopened shops, and it would require
some more powerful counteracting influence than the
big, innocent-looking wicker baskets in which the
mutton is packed to assure him that the canvas sacks
contained nothing more dreadful than sides of beef.
This muffled beef-much of it from <placeName>Aberdeen</placeName> and other
remote regions-was almost all in " sides;" that is, the
hind-quarters with the whole of the ribs attached. Economy keeps shoulders of country beef out of the London
market; for, taxed with carriage-dues, such inferior
portions of the ox would not be able to compete with that
which is killed in London. This rule applies also to
mutton, and goes far towards elucidating the mystery
that hangs over metropolitan mutton-chops. There are
scores of taverns in the City where hundred-weights of
chops are cooked daily. I know of a butcher's shop in
Chancery Lane, and of another in Threadneedle Street,
and of another in Cannon Street, which daily exhibit the
loins of as many sheep as go to make an average flock;
but I never saw at either place a twentieth of the number
of legs needful to carry the loins; and as for breasts and
heads, half-a-dozen sheep would be entitled to them all.
Now, as no breed of sheep was ever yet known to yield
more than a certain number of chops, what becomes of
the other portions of these animals ? I used to entertain
the notion that the mutton-chop merchants disposed of
the rest of the sheep to poor-neighbourhood butchers,
but inquiry convinced me I was in error. I have perambulated the byways of the City Friday after Friday
(that being the day on which the little butcher restocks
his shop), but never yet discovered any other mutton
but entire and fresh from the rearward slaughterhouse.
However, my friend the marketman solved the riddle in
a twinkling. He informed me that many tons of saddles
<pb n="20" id="p.20">
of mutton only arrive in the big wicker baskets weekly
from the country.
<p> Early as it was, the market taverns were open, every
one of them. The windows of the "<placeName>Old Coffeepot</placeName>" were
brilliant, and the gaslight within, shed on rows of bottles,
cast seductive, ramhorn rays into the raw, foggy air;
the portals of the " <placeName>Salutation and Cat</placeName>" were ajar; the
" <placeName>Bell</placeName>" was up and doing; the " <placeName>Market House</placeName>" blinked
snugly behind its red curtains; the "<placeName>Dark House</placeName>" was
already deep in its matutinal rum-and-milk; and at
a certain hybrid establishment-half-beerhouse, half-
coffeehouse-known as " <placeName>Mother Okey's,</placeName>" and a house-
of-call for disengaged porters and out-o'-work butcher
lads, the windows were streaming with the exhalations
of the mocha brew. I peeped in at " <placeName>Mother Okey's</placeName>,"
and was surprised, considering how precious is market
space, to find that lady's premises so extensive. Her
forms and tables covered more ground than many of the
leading salesmen can afford. At the tables, deeply scored
with lines necessary to the game of " shove-halfpenny,"
were seated a troop of out-o'-works and porters at breakfast; and, from the prevalence of juicy steaks, I am
inclined to think that many an in-work mechanic fares
worse than an out-o'-work butcher.
<p> Apropos of the scantiness of market space, the rents
exacted by the Corporation for such miserable hovels as
go to make up the market, almost exceeds belief. For
the privilege of hanging a board-about two feet wide
and seven long-beneath the window of a public-house,
and the use of a shed opposite, capable, if converted to
its proper use, of holding a couple of tons of coals, my
informant pays a hundred pounds a year ! and this in the
worst part of the market. "And not dear either, as
prices go here," said he. "Why, if I could move my
premises to the other end-say to within twenty yards
of <orgName>Bonser's</orgName> (the chief firm in the market, in the main
entrance from <placeName>Newgate Street</placeName>), I'd give two hundred a
year for them willingly. Salesmen in that quarter are
giving more for less accommodation than I possess."
The friendly marketman and I then went to breakfast,

<pb n="21" id="p.21">
and when we returned the wholesale marketing was in
full swing.
In the space of half an hour a marvellous change had
taken place. Shops no longer existed, nor wooden walls,
nor benches, nor bulks, nor posts even; neither were
there any taverns. The " <placeName>Bell</placeName>" was choked-dead and
buried-by pig meat, the "<placeName>Dark House</placeName>" gasped for
breath beneath a crush of beef, and " <placeName>Mother Okey's</placeName>" was
overwhelmed with veal and mutton-her very doorway
reduced to a mere crevice between two carcasses. The
monsters who rushed about with filthy nightcaps and
"knots" in their hands, crying "Here I am!" "Who
wants me?" and "Now, my masters!" were nothing
but meat; the hair on their heads was felted with fat,
their vision was impeded by it, their wrinkles " stopped"
with it; their hands were animated steaks, and their
flimsy garments were by its agency rendered impenetrable as tarpaulin. The great sides of beef, now unshrouded, hung naked and rosy on giant hooks; and sheep
that had left their fleecy coats three hundred miles behind
them, were delivered from the big wicker baskets, and
ranged in clustering rows. Then there were the butchers.
West-End aristocrats, with spotless jean coats and Gibus
hats; half-and-half dandy butchers, with blue half-sleeves
and ribbed aprons; and real, practical, working butchers,
in blue coats and market leggings. By mere pinches
or pokes with the finger, they decided on one-hundred
guinea purchases in less time than your cautious reader
or I would take to choose a quarter of lamb; and, making
their way through the wall of flesh to the watch-box
counting-houses behind, paid down their crisp bank-notes
and clinking gold like true British butchers.
So for some hours the wholesale marketing continues,
and not without peril may the uninitiated in market ways
mingle amongst and note these things. When once caught
in the meaty maze, to get out of the way is impossible.
Every man's meat is against him. His ear is rasped by
the jagged vertebrae of an Aberdeen ox, " by leave " as
he is informed by the giant on whose back the offending
joint is borne; and, while he is turning to inquire by
<pb n="22" id="p.22">
whose leave, the sharp, icy paw of a defunct pig wriggles
itself between his neckcloth and the back of his neck.
So situate, he is unable to avail himself of the warning
"Hi " and takes the consequence-a headless sheep
applied battering-ram-wise at the small of his back, and
he hardly knows whether to kick or thank the man with
the meat-truck who, by a mighty rearward push, extricates him from his dilemma. Nor is he less morally than
physically outraged. To him it seems that barefaced,
wholesale thieving is being practised on every side. The
suetty and knotted ruffians before mentioned are the
delinquents. He sees them without the least reserve
march up to a row of "sides," help them on to each
other's backs, and decamp with them through the rush
without let or hindrance; another, turning square out of
the press, seizes a sheep off a hook and runs off; while
a third, before the very eyes of the market beadle, is
plundering a wicker basket of saddles of mutton. Even
if the stranger were made aware of the true state of the
case, it is doubtful if he could be convinced that the
property was perfectly safe in the hands of the market
porters; for it frequently happens that the purchaser's
cart is a long distance from his purchase, which has to be
wriggled and pushed and pulled through a dense and
opposing mob before the said cart can be reached.
The heat of wholesale traffic at last subsided, and, it
being Saturday, the retail buyers came straggling in.
My friend, however, informed me that at least an hour
would elapse before anything worth calling business
would be doing; so I reminded him of a celebrated sheep-slaughterer he had before mentioned, and proposed to
beguile the hour by an inspection of the said slaughterer's
premises. Directed by my friend, I made my way to the
shop of Messrs. Venables and Dixon, near the marketsquare.
<p>In a great wooden box, rude as a rabbit-hutch, sat a
polite gentleman at his ledgers. He couldn't ask me into
the hutch without himself getting out of it, so we chatted
through the air-holes. He told me that the number of
sheep slaughtered by the firm averaged five hundred a
<pb n="23" id="p.23">
week through the year, but that during some parts of
summer as many as a thousand a week " were turned
out." He further informed me that each sheep passed
through four pairs of hands, and that he employed two
such gangs constantly. The two gangs of eight men
could kill, skin, and properly dress a hundred and sixty
sheep in twelve hours, which is little more than four
minutes for each sheep.
<p>"And pray, where may your slaughtering premises be
situated?" I inquired, never dreaming that accommodation for such wholesale killing could be found within
the market precincts,
<p>"There is our slaughter-house, sir," replied Mr.
Wilson, jerking his thumb toward a doorway behind his
hutch, and from which a cloud of opaque vapour was
issuing.
<p>There indeed it was, and this was what I saw on approaching the doorway from which belched the stifling
smoke. I saw a barn no larger than a drawing-room, in
which were eight men gory to the elbows and with their
faces speckled red. But, limited as was the room, the
eight men did not have it all to themselves; there were
likewise in the room at least fifteen sheep-alive, half
dead, dead, and half undressed, and hanging from beams
completely muttonised. By the door there was a great
sweltering pile of fleecy hides, and in an extreme corner
was a hideous wooden tank, with bars across the top, and
along the bars was a row of freshly-slain sheep. As fast
as the dressers lugged one from the crimson bars to the
stone floor, a hot and saturated giant, looking hideous
through the gloom that lurked in the place, plucked
another from the frantic live ones, who were penned
against the wall, and who, having the blood of their
fellows before their eyes and on the floor, causing their
feet to slip, stared about them and uttered sounds such
as I never before heard sheep utter; except one, and that
was in Old Smithfield Market, and I heard somebody say
that had been kept without water till driven mad. I
trust I am not mawkishly sentimental; but when I saw
emerging from that dismal den, foggy with the steam
<pb n="24" id="p.24">
of blood and departing breath, and contrasted the sad,
limp bodies of the poor animals with the rosy carcasses
that came from the country in the wicker hampers-
when I saw the former, borne along on the butcher's
back, wag their heads mournfully, and as though aware
of their ignoble appearance-I could scarcely forbear
wagging my own sympathetically.
<p>Gladly I escaped to the comparatively Arcadian air of
the market, where the retail business had now commenced
in earnest. The leviathans of the market, such as the
Messrs. Bonser, despise petty huckstering, and are close
shut up an hour ago; still there are shops and stalls displaying abundance of meat-some prime and handsome,
and some very, very ugly. Were I made market inspector
for a single day, I should doubtless provoke the law by
sending tons of this fresh-smelling, but skinny, bloodshot meat to be burnt in the knacker's yard at <placeName>King's
Cross</placeName>. But I suppose the inspector knows best, and the
meat is all perfectly sound and wholesome. Whether or
no, it all finds purchasers. The newly-married young
shoemaker, ninth son of a managing mother, brings hither
his little wife, and instructs her how to invest half-a-
crown economically; the family man brings his wife and
an olive-branch to carry the basket, and bids, per stone,
for meat enough to last an entire week; the hard-up
man, his wife's week's charing concluded, brings her all
the way from <placeName>Camden Town</placeName>, and they purchase enormous
joints of veal at an absurdly low figure.
But what I have seen of the retail business of <placeName>Newgate
Market</placeName> disposes me to believe that if you want sound,
nutritious, animal food, you can't do better than patronise
the butcher round the corner. The meat that goes so
wonderfully cheap in the market, the butcher round the
corner would not keep on his premises. But folks like
to dabble in the "wholesale." I do. I'd have my
pen'orth of apples picked from the tree if I could; as I
can't, please serve me from a full bushel basket. There
fore, why should I blame Mrs. Jones for liking to pick
out her nine pounds of " brisket" from as many tons ?</div1><pb n="25" id="p.25">

IV.
A DOG SHOW.</head>
<p>BESIDES cattle shows, and poultry shows, and
fruit and flower shows, and rabbit shows, and
Punch-and-Judy shows, and the annual showing of the <persName>Lord Mayor</persName>, there exist throughout
London, in at least fifty different "slums,"
and corners, and crooked ways of the great City, establish
ments devoted to the "showing" of dogs. By name I
have all along known of the existence of these places-
knew that they had been in vogue since the days when
there were public cockpits at <placeName>Westminster</> and <placeName>St.
George's-in-the-Fields</>, and when hideous bulldogs drew
badgers and aristocratic audiences at <placeName>Hockley-in-the-
Hole</>. With this extent of knowledge of the subject I
should, doubtless, have remained content, had not a
philanthropic soul, yearning to establish a dog-hospital
in a toolshed at <placeName>Canonbury</placeName>, inclined my sympathies dog
gishly, and resolved me to find out what a "dog show"
meant.
<p>The columns of Bell's Life revealed more than a dozen
invitations of the sort I was desirous of complying with.
East, west, north, and south of the metropolis were the
exhibitions to take place; and, in at least nine cases out
of ten, Sunday evening was the time appointed. Of the
advertisements the following is a fair sample :-
" A Treat for the Fancy !-On Sunday evening next a
Show will be held at Mr. Lerinke's, 'Duck,' Bethnal
Green-chair taken at eight o'clock, by Mr. Abrahams,
faced by Billy Cool. Mr. Abrahams will produce his
splendid stud of toy terriers on this occasion. Mr.
Lerinke has a terrier, weight three pounds and a half,
open to kill with any dog in the world at his weight."
<pb n="26" id="p.26">
The programme issued by the landlord of the
"Lurcher," Waterloo Road, and mine host. of the
"Crown," Fiddler's Alley, Haymarket, and half-a-dozen
others, all more or less resembled the above. My ignorance, however, put anything like choice quite out of the
question; and I selected Mr. Lerinke's establishment
simply because it was first on the list.
<p>Passing <placeName>Shoreditch Church</placeName>, just as the good folk were
flocking out therefrom, I took my way up the High
Street till I came to a black, narrow gap in the face of
it, between Church Street and the railway station, and
into it I turned;-through Club Row, where the Sunday
bird, and rabbit, and goat, and guinea-pig fair is held;
past the "<placeName>King of Clubs</placeName>," where every evening, including
the Sabbath, prize-fighting goes on, the fighters being
chaffinches, and goldfinches, and canaries, the weapons
their well-trained voices, and the prizes a " ten-pun'ote "
or a German silver "waterpot," just as the birds' owners
or backers may agree. Past these, through a lane or
so, through a long alley, too narrow so to be called, and
more like an accidental chink-a warp in the foul brickwork-and there was "Duck Street" and the "Duck"
tavern, and the name of Lerinke written over the door.
Following a man who wore a kennelish countenance and
a close-fitting hairy cap, and who hugged something
bulky within the breast of his coat in a manner highly
suggestive of stolen goods, I crossed Mr. Lerinke's
threshold and stood before his bar.
<p>It was not a handsome bar. The wooden front of it
was at least as dirty as the floor, and exhibited symptoms
of long familiarity with hobnailed boots and lazy knees,
while the grimy, battered metal counter was chequered
with a chain-pattern of glazy rings. About the walls in
glasses were preserved specimens of canine monstrosity,
from the span-long terrier to the bulldog in all his full-
blown hideousness. Men and dogs filled the space before
the bar, and behind the bar were Mr. Lerinke and Mrs.
Lerinke, and a barmaid.
<p>I was surprised at Mr. Lerinke's appearance. Knowing that he fought dogs and held stakes for amateur
<pb n="27" id="p.27">
pugilists, and kept a rat-pit, and was frequently in the
pit and up to his eyes in rats, I had expected to see a
brawny fellow, with big muscles, and a way with him
that even a bulldog could not mistake; on the contrary,
I found him a small man, with an everlasting smile and
an oily voice-the sort of man, in fact, you would expect
to find carrying the big banner in a "total abstinence"
procession, or cutting bread and butter at a love-feast,
rather than ruling among savage vermin and hobnobbing
with bulldogs and bulldog-men. I don't know the sort
of breed it is, but there is a dog one occasionally meets in
the street, a brown dog, one part spaniel and seven parts
kennel cur; a dog with lean loins, and an inquiring
nose, and pursed lips, and a bewildered where's-the-next-
meal-to-come-from expression about his eyes; he plods
along the road with a business air, as though, having at
last argued down the proud little bit of spaniel in him,
he was bound on a begging errand to a West End relation.
Now and then, however, he pulls up short and dead-
"skidded," as it were, by that rebellious one-eighth of
respectability-shakes his head miserably, and then forges
along once more. Mr. Lerinke reminded me of this dog
instantly. He looked exactly as it would have looked-
just as beseeching and make-believe pleasant-if you
had offered it meat on a skewer, and wickedly amused
yourself by pricking its nose with the sharp end before
you threw it down. As for Mrs. Lerinke, she looked
contented and happy; and the few small Lerinkes to be
seen about the place seemed soundly booted and breeched,
and well fed. In ordinary cases this would not have been
remarkable, but in this case it was; inasmuch as it was
hard to understand how a manwith his heart so thoroughly
set on dogs should trouble himself much about such trifles
as wives and children. That his heart was set on dogs
was clear. The loving sidelong glances he cast on them
when he thought nobody was looking, the kindly purring
noise he made while tenderly handling baby dogs, and
the way in which he scratched their tiny polls and clucked
to them, were ample proof of it. Conspicuous among the
stuffed specimens on the walls was a murderous-looking
<pb n="28" id="p.28">
bulldog in a handsome mahogany-and-glass case. The
fate of this brute Mr. Lerinke was explaining to a gentleman who wore the head of a Skye terrier out of his
coat-pocket as swells of the lower order occasionally wear
their handkerchiefs. Had the defunct dog been an only
son, the little man could not have exhibited more emotion.
He would not, he said, have taken fifty pounds on the
nail for it; indeed, he had had forty-five pounds ten
offered for it; but it warnt likely ! You might as well
have offered forty-five ten for his biggest kid, or-this
in the lowest whisper-the missus herself. Well, sir, he
was pisoned! He was the best in the world-too good
to live-so the vagabuns pisoned him. On a Sunday
morning it was hearty and well one minute among their
legs in front of this bar, and the next minute, hallo! on
this side of the bar dead as paving-stones! Proosick
acid did it! On a bit of meat!
<p>The gentleman with the Skye terrier was so affected
that he swallowed all his rum at a gulp, and hurried to a
flight of stairs in the corner, and, thinking it probable
that the stairs might lead to the show-room, I followed
I had guessed rightly. When the door was pushed
open there belched out a cloud so warm, so dense, so
redolent of rank tobacco and spirituous liquors that only
that a man came up close behind me laden with a snarling
cur I think I should have retreated. In I went, however, and this is what I saw:-A long, narrow room,
shallow from floor to ceiling as a church vault, and (by
reason of the foul vapour) as gloomy, although there were
several jets of gas burning. At the end of the room the
flooring was raised a foot or so, and on this was the
chairman's chair; and at the other extremity of the room
was the chairman's " facer," proudly nursing a dreadful
brute, with its jaws bound up with thongs of leather, and
which I was confidently informed "was the handsomest
brindled bull for miles round." Round the walls were
more stuffed dogs and pictures of fighting-men and
running-men, and of dogs killing rats, and of dogs and
cocks killing each other. At one side of the room, and
visible now and then through the many pairs of ragged
<pb n="29" id="p.29">
legs that hemmed it in, was a great roaring fire, which
was needful, for the night was very cold, and the draught
came in at the gap at the bottom of the door, and in at
the crazy windows, and in at a great hole in the ceiling
from which the plaster had tumbled down.
<p>Concerning the company. In my rambles round about
the great metropolis I have fallen in with some curious
company. I have passed an evening in a room with a
large number of women and men, and where, had it been
known that I was anything but a thief or a scoundrel at
enmity with the law, I stood an excellent chance of being
thrown out of the window or having my head knocked
against the wall; I have supped with tramps and beggars
in a Kent Street kitchen; but, with few exceptions, I
never before saw congregated so many faces with "hulks"
branded on them, so much brazen blackguardism, so
much bare brutality, as was exhibited by Mr. Lerinke's
guests.
<p>There were, I should say, at least fifty of them; some
with black coats and hats with curly brims, some in caps
and flannel jackets, some with smocks and "ankle-jacks"
-all, or nearly all, bull-necked, heavy-jawed, and with
the hair dressed after a fashion known among its patrons
as the "Newgate-knocker" style-that is, parted in
masses on each side of the head, and turned under unnaturally. Every man possessed at least one dog, and as
he sat at the table the animal was squatted by the side of
his pot or glass, with his arm round it. These, however,
were the "toy" dogs, marvels of shape and size-so
small, some of them, that their weight is reckoned by
ounces, and with limbs but little thicker than the stem of
a tobacco-pipe, with beautifully-formed heads, and eyes
full of intelligence. One could not help reflecting, after
gazing first on the dog, then on its keeper, what a pity it
was that the former should be tied to such a low-bred
companion!
<p>How did these beautiful little creatures come into the
hands of their present owners, is a question little less difficult to answer than another. Of what use are they to their
masters ? One may understand how affection may attach
<pb n="30" id="p.30">
an honest man to an honest dog, or a ruffian to an able-
bodied, ruffianly "brindled bull;" but what gratification
can a big, coarse-minded man enjoy by the possession of
a " toy ?" a thing without bark, or bite, or a single other
quality assimilating with any one he himself possesses.
One would as soon expect to find him keeping white mice
or silkworms. " What is the value of that little clog ? " I
asked of a young man in a tattered jacket and a very dirty
shirt, who was showing " his terrier-weight two pounds
and a quarter-against another. "I don't want to sell
her," the young man replied; "twelve pounds is her
worth-ten I'm offered for her."
<p>Had there been no other than dogs of the "toy" school
in the room the business of the evening would have been,
no doubt, carried on in a much more quiet way. As it
was, however, there were shrill-voiced ratting dogs,
and fighting terriers, and fighting bulldogs, struggling
and straining their leashes to get at each other, with their
red eyes starting from their heads, and their black lips
curled back from their fangs, howling, yelping, barking
shrilly and spitefully, or growling with a deeper rage from
the bottom of their wide, red throats; while their masters,
savages as themselves, roared out horrid blasphemy, and
staked their eyes and limbs on the swaggering lies they
uttered, and struck their great fists on the table to show
they were in earnest in the wagers they offered to lay,
and clapped hands together when the wager was made;
while others, who had come on purpose to make a match
and found a difficulty in "getting on" with any one, sat
apart, stirring up their dogs to show their mettle, or
clenching their muzzles and holding still their writhing
limbs when for business reasons it was desirable that their
tremendous courage should not be made too public.
<p>Apart from the bustle and the uproar sat two or three
of the most miserable objects that could be imagined,-
ragged, thin, and anxious-looking, and each accompanied
by a gaunt, hollow-sided bulldog. I didn't ask their
condition. It was too apparent. Like the poor fellow to
whom some kind Indian acquaintance sent an elephant
which he could not afford to keep, which nobody would
<pb n="31" id="p.31">
buy, and which the authorities would not allow him to
kill, so were each of these wretches afflicted with a bulldog, the only difference in the cases being that a fatal
desire to belong to the " fancy," and not the whim of a
friend, brought the calamity upon them, and that not
sanitary considerations, but infatuation, obliges them to
bear about the dreadful burden. So will they drag on a
miserable existence, half-starved, and cordially hating
each other, till the workhouse-doors, or others still more
inexorable, part the wretched pair and break the spell.</div1><pb n="32" id="p.32">
<div1 type="chapter"><head>V.
THE NIGHT COFFEE-BOOTH AND ITS CUSTOMERS.</head>
<p>IT is often my fate to ride home from Fleet-street by the last Islington omnibus. At
about thirty minutes before midnight this
vehicle arrives at the "Angel," and at that
point it is my custom to alight. I need not
mention that sometimes the night is fine, sometimes
otherwise-very much otherwise-foggy, snowy, rainy,
windy; so that the street lamps rattle and waver, and
even the accustomed policeman holds his hat on; or so
bitterly cold that the night cabmen on the ranks shut
themselves within their carriages and have to be knocked
up before they may be hired.
<p>Hail, blow, shine, or snow, however, there is one
spectacle I rarely miss as I step from the omnibus, and
that is a large hand-barrow laden high with some poles
and some sailcloth, and some forms and a table, and a big
wicker-basket, and a great bright tin boiler with a brass
tap, while from the bows of the barrow there swings a
cylindrical and perforated firegrate and a jolly, glowing
coke-fire. A very decent-looking old fellow pushes at
the shafts; and walking at his side, and lending a friendly
hand at up-hill and stony places, is a tidy, buxom little
woman, with a pippin face, snugly tucked up in a shawl
and a woollen comforter.
<p>The nature of their avocation was evident-they were
the proprietors of a night coffee-stall--a common enough
nocturnal feature of the London highway; still, like most
folks, I had been so accustomed to associate all that
pertained to night life in London with the raffish, the
<pb n="33" id="p.33">
sharkish, the blackguardly, and the idiotic, that to see
such decent people embarked in it seemed not a little
singular and worthy some little inquiry.
<p>So I kept the barrow in sight from under the lee of my
umbrella (it was raining and blowing pretty hard) till it
stopped near a piece of waste ground in front of a tavern,
the gaslights pertaining to which were by this time all
but extinguished, and the barmen busy hustling out into
the rain and the mire the most pertinacious of their customers (who implored "another quartern" with all the
eloquence of paupers at the door of a relieving overseer,
and were, it is but just to add, as gruffly refused), and the
potman was hoisting up the broad shutters. With marvellous expedition the old people relieved the barrow of
its load, rigged up the tent, arranged the forms, lit the
bright swinging lamp, perched the tin boiler on the fire,
and spread the table with a white cloth; the table they
quickly adorned with cups and saucers and a big loaf and
a cake withdrawn from the basket; so that, within a
quarter of an hour, the little cabin was built and invitingly
furnished; and when the old lady had cut up a stack of
bread and butter and another of cake, and the coffee-
boiler began to steam, I experienced much less embarrassment than I had anticipated in crossing the road and
requesting to be served with a cup of coffee.
<p>"Is there anything else I can do for you before I go,
Sam ?" asked the old woman of her husband as I began
to sip his really excellent mocha.
<p>" No, my dear, thanky; I shall be pretty comfortable
now, I think," replied he, looking round the cabin
critically; "good-night, missus, I shall be home soon
after light."
<p>I believe he would have kissed her had I not been
present; but he compromised the matter by adjusting the
comforter about her neck in the most solicitous manner, and
then she, returning his "Good-night," and bidding him
take care of himself, toddled off.
<p>"Your wife does not stay here with you ?" I observed.
I'd be werry sorry to see her," replied the proprietor;
"it might be all right in general, which it is, even with
<pb n="34" id="p.34">
the worst of them-the unfortnight ones-civil, bless you,
sir, as can be; still, now and then we have a orkard
customer, much more orkard than I should like a missus
of mine to be a witness to. Besides, it's better for her to
be abed than a breezin' and a blowin' out here."
<p>Having complimented my coffee-man on his good sense,
and ordered another cup of coffee, which I likewise praised,
we fell into a very interesting conversation, which, however, was unfortunately more than once interrupted by
the occurrence of a customer, and, as coffee-stall customers
were the topic of our conversation, it was convenient to
drop the subject whenever one appeared. Still, those I
had at present seen were of a most ordinary sort, as I took
opportunity to remark to him.
<p>"Well, you see, it's early yet," replied he; "the curious
sort don't drop in till about two, and then they keep
dropping in till about five; then the reg'lar working
trade begins, men and lads who are obliged to be at shop,
and make a quarter before breakfast-time. Ah, I have
often thought what a remarkable book it would make if I
was to write down all the queer customers I serve."
<p>I, myself, could not help reflecting on the exceedingly
remarkable volume my friend was capable of producing
under the circumstances. Still, the notion, in a limited
sense, was not without its attractions, and before I bade
the coffee-man adieu I had arranged a little plan with
him. With a pencil with which I provided him, and on
some leaves torn from my pocket-book, he was, on the
following night, to make note of his customers and what
they were like, together with such brief comments on them
as he thought necessary. In the course of the day following he was to leave his notes at my house. He brought
them. Here they are:-
<p>"Half-past Eleven, at which time we began to put up
the stall.-Had a customer (if you could call him such,
poor fellow) waiting till it was ready. It was the blind
man as you might have seen on the canal-bridge reading
the New Testament, with cockled-up letters, by the touch
of his fingers. He had only took threepence-halfpenny
since tea, which was four o'clock, cold weather being bad
<pb n="35" id="p.35">
for him, on account of people not stopping to listen. The
missus was ready to go when he had finished his cup, so
she see him across the road. 'Cept a cup to a night cabman, and ditto with cake to an unfortnight, and giving the
policeman a light, nothing done till half-past twelve.
<p>"Half-past Twelve.-Never thought to serve two blind
people in one night; but so it was. This time a little boy
about six years old, with his father, who, although it ain't
for me to talk about looks or to judge, was not a nice sort
of person. He seemed out of sorts, and turned over the
bread and butter for the thickest, in a way that made me
speak about it. 'It ain't no more for sitting, I spose,'
said he, taking up the boy and slamming him on to a
form. 'Didn't I sing it properly, father?' presently
asked the little chap. ' As proper as you'll ever sing it,'
snapped out his father. Then turning to me, says he,
'You're jolly pious in this quarter, ain't you?' 'Not
that I ever heard,' says I; 'what makes you ask?'
'Just this,' says he, 'you must know that my little boy,
who is as blind as a stone, and likely to be a burden to me
as long as he lives, has got a tidy voice, that is for the comic
style-" Dark girl dressed in blue," "Mrs. Rummins's
Ball,"-that sort of thing, you know; well, I takes him of
nights, you know, to concert-rooms, 'specially where there
is a bit of a platform and a piano where he can show off,
you know. If the company likes to take pity and club
round, it's optional. I don't ask 'em, not I; I sits down
and smokes my pipe like another man. Well, we goes
to-night to the "North Star" close here, and says I to
the chairman, " Perhaps the company would like to hear a
little blind boy sing a song." "I dessay they would,"
said he, and, after tapping the table, he announced it.
Well, I 'spose because he was blind they thought he was
going to strike up the Old Hundredth, or something in
that line; but he didn't, he sang " Mrs. Rummins's Ball,"
and when he had done, instead of clapping and knocking
as he deserved, they fell to hissing like steam, and in a
minute a waiter comes, and says he, "There's somebody
as wants you in the next street, sir." A pretty canting
lot you must be about here !' and then he flung down the
<pb n="36" id="p.36">
price of what he had had, and, jerking the blind boy off
the form, walked off with him. Four cups to the night
street-sweepers, and a goodish many spilt, if not drank,
with five spoons bit in two for a wager, and a saucer
broke, by three tipsy gents out of the Belvedere, who
handsomely paid a shilling each for damages, making up
the time till half-past one.
<p>" Half-pastOne.-More call for pickled cabbage (which,
you must know, I was asked for till at last I kept) than
anything else, by married men, and them as are single,
and live in quiet lodgings, that they might go in something like sober. I've had as much as a shilling give me
for a pull at the vinegar in the jar before now. At a little
after two I sold my last pen'orth of pickles, and then
begins to come in my very worst sort of customers: they
who, in consequence of having something short of the
price of a lodging, walk about till two, and then come
and dribble and drabble their bits of ha'pence in coffee
and bread and butter just as long as you can put up with
'em. Bless you, if I encouraged it, I shouldn't be able
to get near the coffee-tap. They'll come in, trying to
look as promiscuous as possible, and call for threeaporth
of coffee, and sit down close to the fire; but I'm so used
to 'em, that only by their lingering way of stirring it I
know what their game is. If I don't take any notice of
'cm they are asleep in a jiffy, and when I wakes 'em they
order a slice of bread and butter, and then they're off
again. I wakes'em again, and again they order another
slice, till I'm thankful when their last halfpenny is gone,
and I can say, 'Now, sir, what can I serve you with ?'
' Nothing more, thanky.' ' Then, good morning, sir!'
"But these lodgingless ones ain't all ' sirs,' and that's
the worst of it, the other sort being much more frequent
and harder to get rid of. I've had 'em come and say,
' Mister, I want to sit by your fire till the morning: don't
turn me away-for God's sake don't!' So, for God's sake,
I give 'em shelter, which it's what a man ought to do,
no doubt, specially when he comes to consider that that
very night may be their last in that unlucky lane to
which there seems no turnin', and that, by the help of
<pb n="37" id="p.37">
another day's seeking, they may find the reward for
remaining honest against such heavy odds.
"Half-past Two.-Three unfortnights, two of which
are old customers and sisters, for coffee and cake. ' Don't
you wish he sold rum, Polly?' asked one. ' I wish he
sold laudanum,' replied she, ' and was bound to make me
swallow a quartern of it! I feel as though I was standing
up to my knees in ice.' ' That's a very wrong wish of
yours, aint it, miss ?' says I to her. 'You be hanged,
you old fool !' said she; ' what do you know about it ?
I'd like to see every man in London choking in a ditch
with a stone round his neck.' Just then comes up two
navigating-looking men, with bundles at their backs, and
asks if they were on the right road for Uxbridge. ' You
ain't going to Uxbridge now, are you?' asked the one
that spoke about the laudanum. ' Right away, miss: the
young 'uns and the missuses are there, where we left 'em
to try for work at the new shore up here; but it's no go,
and the sooner we gets back the better.' 'You might
have rode home for eighteenpence,' said Polly. 'That's
the identical sum we set out with, three days gone,' said
the navvy, ruefully. ' Come in, men,' says Polly, ' and
pitch into the bread and butter and coffee; I'll pay.' So
in they came; but I'm proud to say that they used her
like honest chaps, eating a tidy lot, certainly, but not
half, no, nor a quarter, as much as they could; and then
went off shaking hands with her, and thanking her, and
steadfastly denying the sixpence she wanted to press on
them. Cabman brought a drunken gentleman, who swore
dreadfully because I had no new-laid eggs; said he was
well known to Mr. Cox, of Finsbury, and would take
care that the thing was looked into. Polly, the unfortnight, who was not yet gone, asked him to stand coffee;
on which he threw what was in his cup all over her, and
called for the police, who turned 'em all out, and the
gentleman got into his cab, and was drove clear off without paying. The fire-escape man looked in, and I smoked
a pipe with him, while one of the homeless ones, mentioned in half-past one, edged close to the fire and dozed
for half-an-hour.
<pb n="38" id="p.38">
<p>"Half-past Three.-Being market morning, the drovers
begin now to come along, and for the next hour, off and
on, the stall is filled with them and their dogs, which
makes it uncomfortable; and all the more so because
they bring their bread with them, and like their coffee so
very sweet. They're a dreadful rough lot, and their talk
is something awful; but I darn't open mouth, or over
would go my boiler in a twinkling. I'm thankful that I
only have their company two mornings in the week.
"Half-past Four.-Plenty of unfortnights, who have
been a waitin' and a watchin' about for the drovers to go,
now come in and spend their ha'pence, and take it in
turns to warm themselves. If you was to peep in and
see me behind my table, and the stall filled with a dozen
of these customers, mostly pretty, and dressed out so gay,
you might think me lucky; but if you was to hear what
I hear in their talks one to the other of their poverty and
wretchedness, their brutal usage, and their hatred of
themselves and all the rest of the world, I think you
would alter your opinion. So there they stay, taking it
in turns to stand at the fire, till five o'clock strikes. At
that hour they know, as I have before told you, that my
regular morning working customers drop in, and so, without being told, they then clear out.
<p>"You might wish to know what sort of a night's work
this makes. Well, I've sold three gallons of coffee, and I
get two-and-threepence out of that, tenpence out of my
bread and butter, and ninepence out of my cake. That's
three-and-tenpence, and rather over than under the
average; and I leave it to you to say if it's earned a bit
too easy."</div1><pb n="39" id="p.39">
<div1 type="chapter"><head>VI.
CONCERNING MUFFINS.</head>
<p>MY dear," said I to my wife, dutifully saluting
her as she adjusted the top button of my
overcoat, "we will have muffins at tea this
evening."
<p>" But, my love, there are no muffins to be
had yet awhile," replied she.
<p>"My precious, there will be muffins this afternoon:
listen for the tinkling of the bell just before dusk."
She shook her head incredulously, and observed, "We
shall see."
<p>We did see. As I deposited my umbrella and my life-
preserver in the hall that evening I experienced the
happy sensation that invariably attends the man the correctness of whose prognostication is proved. The air was
fragrant of buttered muffins, and in another minute were
revealed to me the luscious discs, blushing a dainty straw
colour in the cheery firelight.
<p>"Did I not tell you so?"
<p>"Truly," replied my wife, regarding me as the head
of a household likes to be regarded; "but how, in the
name of goodness, you came to know that it would be so
is more than I can imagine."
<p>"Your silly little head cannot be expected to know
everything," I replied, with an offhand air of superiority,
and seemingly unconscious of the glance of prideful admiration that was directed to me on account of this last
proof of my profound wisdom. I let the discussion drop,
and gave my attention to that which had originated it.
Perhaps I ought to be ashamed to confess that my
wife's simple and confiding nature had been imposed on.
The fact is, I knew as well that the muffin "season"
<pb n="40" id="p.40">
would commence that day as when the next Good Friday
would fall. I know all about muffin boys, and men, and
bells, and trays, and can give the names and addresses of
the chief muffin merchants, east, west, north, and south.
I attained my muffin knowledge in a purely accidental
way. Possibly the reader may know nothing of the
neighbourhood of Shoreditch, or his knowledge at most
may be restricted to the highway part of it where the
railway station is; there it will be useless for me to specify
by name a certain narrow, tortuous, miry thoroughfare,
with a rutty road and pathway for not more than two
abreast, that leads from the main street to Curtain Road.
Anyhow, that was the street, or lane, or whatever they call
it, it was lately my lot to traverse, and there, keeping my
eyes about me, as is my wont, I was struck by a somewhat singular announcement stuck in a shop-window.
It was a mysterious-looking shop. The name over the
door (which was close shut, and, as might be seen by the
broad mud splashes that crossed the chink of opening,
had remained so for several months) was Toomey, but
of Toomey's trade there was not even a hint. You
naturally turned for the required information to the contents of the shop, and there you saw a great stack of
empty ginger-beer bottles; and for a moment your mind
was at rest-only for a moment, however, for a second
glance disclosed several flour barrels and sacks, that
could not possibly have to do with the ginger-beer trade;
added to this the written announcement, "The. season
commences on Tuesday," was clearly against the bottles, for, as common sense dictated, the call for the exhilarating beverage contained in them becomes fainter as the
summer wanes, and at the present season of the year,
with the wintry wind blowing and the rain falling, could
be in no demand at all.
<p>Happily, in the midst of my perplexity, there sauntered past Mr. Toomey's premises two intelligent-looking
but sparsely-dressed youths of the neighbourhood. Their
industrious eyes at once found out the mysterious notification, and they halted simultaneously to discuss it.
<p>" Oh, 'mences on Toosday, do it," was the observation
<pb n="41" id="p.41">
of one of them, as he screwed up his mouth and reflectively
fingered the lobe of his left ear.
<p>"It do so, aperiently, William," said his companion,
"which it is later by three weeks than last 'ear. How
do it find you, William ? "
<p>"It don't find me werry well," responded William.
<p>"I sees my way to the apron and sleeves; the old 'ooman
will look arter them-it's the bell as floors me. It's been
away since the Darby, which the money as was got on
it went, as you werry well know, to buy a close-brush.
Let us see, June, July, August, Siptember, 'Tober,
'Vember" (this on his fingers), "that's thruppence, and
thruppence as they lent on it, that's just a 'sprat' altogether. I wish I might get a sprat to spare atween this
and Toosday."
<p>As the youth had mentioned two threepences as equivalent to a " sprat," it was pretty clear that the name of the
familiar little fish was "Shoreditch" for sixpence-a sum
the attainment of which by William within the prescribed
period was so utterly hopeless as to be inexpressible in
words. A few steps of a hornpipe, however, seemed to
meet the case, for after its serious performance, William
so far dismissed the subject as to be able to devote his
entire attention to a sugar-tub that stood at a grocer's
door adjacent.
<p>I was no longer at a loss to understand the import of
the placard in the dingy window. Without doubt the
"season" alluded to was that of muffins. What else
could an apron and sleeves in connection with a bell
point to? What the flour-sacks and barrels? But how
was the opening of the season inaugurated ? Was there
a procession of muffineers with green baize banners ? and
did Mr. Toomey himself announce the momentous event
by clang of brazen clapper ? Early in the afternoon of
the Tuesday advertised I once more visited the spot
where William had bewailed his want of a " sprat."
Mr. Toomey's premises had altered wonderfully in appearance. The ginger-beer bottles had disappeared, and
in their place-in the place, indeed, everything else had
previously occupied-were piles and mounds of muffins
<pb n="42" id="p.42">
and crumpets. It was not a lofty shop, but it was very
long and tolerably wide; and yet, with the exception of
a narrow passage, it was chokefull of the ware in question; while at the end was a stack of muffin-trays, all
bright with fresh paint, and reaching from floor to ceiling,
each one bearing on its front ledge the name of Toomey.
There was one thing that rather astonished me: here were
the goods meant without doubt to be buttered and consumed that very afternoon; there were the trays ready
for conveying them away; but where were the vendors ?
Presently, however, directed by a Babel of tongues, I discovered by the side of the muffin merchant's premises a
spacious yard, and in the yard, and pressing about the door
of what I suppose was the bakery, was a mob forty or
fifty strong of decent-looking old men, and boys ranging
in age from ten to sixteen, each attired in a snowy apron
and sleeves, and bearing in his hands a bell and a piece
of green baize. Presently an old fellow came leisurely
towards the gate where I was standing, and observed,
"What's the use of 'em scrouging? There's enough
for all of us, I'll be bound, and they won't get served
before three o'clock, that's a certain thing."
<p>"But why three o'clock ? " I inquired.
<p>"Blest if I know," replied the old fellow; "I only
know it is so, and always was; if you was to go the
round, both this and the t'other side of the water, you
would find just this sort of game-this pushing, and
driving, and scrouging to be first, going on at all the
master muffin bakers."
<p>Then ensued a conversation between myself and the old
muffin man, in which he informed me that the " season"
was regulated by nothing more reliable than the whim
or convenience of half a dozen muffin merchants, established in as many obscure streets in and about the metro-
polis ;-that he, on whose premises we now stood, regarded
the districts of Dalston, Islington, and Highbury as exclusively his;-that Belgravia and the aristocratic parts
of Chelsea were supplied from the insalubrious vicinity of
Strutton Ground;-that the seat of the southern muffin
interest was Kent Street. My informant was particularly
<pb n="43" id="p.43">
 desirous that I should understand that these (he
mentioned their names) were the leviathans of the business, and ruled the "season;" for, said he, "of course
you, as a gentleman, don't want no telling that the
season for a thing is the season, and that the crumpets as
you buy of a 'fectioner in July ain't no more in season
than is green peas at Christmas."
<p>"Pray, is it a profitable business?" I ventured to
inquire.
<p>"Profitable enough to him, I'll wager," replied he,
intimating who "him " was by a jerk of his thumb towards the muffin-shop; " I've known him empty twenty
sacks of flour a week."
<p>"And how many muffins would that make ?"
<p>"How many muffins? " repeated the old man, slowly,
and gazing mazily up the street and down the street, and
up at the gables of the tall old-fashioned houses. " Goodness knows. You could never count 'em. Look here,
your edication will find it out quicker than mine. How
much batter-werry thin batter-will twenty sacks of
flour make ?"
<p>The arithmetical problem thus suddenly put so fairly
staggered me, that I could merely shake my head, and
ejaculate "Ah !"
<p>"Werry well, then," continued he, "half a pint of
batter makes six muffins. Now you've got it. Besides,"
continued he, sinking his voice confidentially, "he's got
two seasons. He's got a ginger-beer season as costs, as
I know from my lad as works here, 70 a year for corks
and twine alone. Bless you, old Toomey's a warm man-never drinks nothing but brandy-and-water "
<p>Seeing that he expected it, I was much impressed with
this last item of intelligence, and for a moment was overwhelmed with silent amazement.
<p>"About being profitable," he broke out again presently, " why, you know, fourpence out of a shilling ain't
bad, and that's what we get. Mind you, he don't change
your stale, and at that figure you can't expect it. But
muffins have been frightful slack these three seasons.
You see the butter's all against us."
<pb n="44" id="p.44">
<p>"The butter? I beg your pardon."
<p>"Oh, no offence, sir; none in the least. It ain't your
fault, but it's none the less true, I assure you. When
one's up t'other's down. You don't catch 'em running ekal
together; no, not one season out of six. Nobody thinks
of eating dry muffins, or muffins with marmalade. So,
you see, with butter at fourteen pence a pound, it's good-bye muffins."
<p>Three o'clock just then struck out from the neighbouring churches, and, with a nod, the old muffin-man turned
on his heel and hurried towards the now open door of the
muffin bakery. In less than a quarter of an hour the
bells gave tongue, and the welcome news that the muffin
season had commenced was spread through the town.

THE HORSE REPOSITORY.</head>
<p>MY grandfather being a man of small means,
and being desirous of purchasing for pleasure
and business purposes a horse, sound of wind
and limb, and yet not of particularly noble
blood, and of a value so low that the highly-
bred hammer of Tattersall could not possibly descend to
" knock it down," experienced considerable difficulty in
suiting himself. He might wait for the annual horse fair
at Barnet; but to select a decent beast from among the
best of unkempt quadrupedal savages assembled, required
an amount of subtle calculation and sagacity peculiar to
purchasers of growing crops and cargoes of cocoanuts in
the husks. There was Smithfield, and had he been a
butcher he would not have had the least hesitation in proceeding there alone to buy an ox or a score of sheep; but,
had any friend suggested that he should visit Smithfield's
chartered and officially-recognised weekly horse sale, the
said friend would have been regarded as a simpleton
unacquainted with metropolitan pitfalls, or as a wicked,
practical joker.
<p>There were several other courses open to my grandfather, all more or less objectionable; and among the
latter the " auction-yard " of Messrs. Betty and Martingale, and Mr. Spavinger's weekly horse sale. Mr. Spavinger's premises were not splendid; they were not even
commodious, nor particularly clean. The entrance was a
low archway, about the mouth of which lounged and leant
any number of seedy, tight-breeched blackguards-shrewd
villains, most of them with a knowledge of horseflesh
<pb n="46" id="p.46">
almost amounting to inspiration, and astute readers of
the human countenance, enabling them at a glance to
tell the simple visitor from the knowing, and so to shape
their behaviour. At the same time, I am ready to believe
that, except when brought in contact with equine nature,
these unlucky dogs are as honest as the majority of us.
They are like the terrier-if that respectable dog will
pardon me-who is of peaceable disposition, just in his
dealings with his own species, and all other animals
except the rat. Only show him a rat, and he at once
abandons his pacific demeanour and becomes a furious,
mouthing little savage, anxious only to rend and tear and
make havoc. So it would seem to be with certain of the
human species, that, being from their childhood thrown
into horse society, and having ample opportunities of
observing that, compared with the intelligence of the
brute, their own low, loose minds appear to little advantage, gradually conceive a violent hatred to Equus, and
resolve to devote their entire lives to persecuting it, and
to convincing the arrogant beast which is master. These
worthies are like the terrier, inasmuch as they eat and
drink with their fellows, and that without sponging or
filching the bread or the beer: if they have wives and
little children, they will dutifully carry home such of their
earnings as are left from their spendings; they will even
turn the mangle should their wives possess such an instrument; or, at least, nurse the baby while she turns it.
So far are they docile, harmless creatures; but show them
a horse-that is, a horse whose owner wishes to dispose of
him-let them but catch scent of one such, and his disquietude will begin. This peculiar species of individual
will nose about here and there till he discovers it, when he
will eagerly offer his services to the seller-he " knows a
gen'leman as wants jist sich a mare," if you'll allow him
to take it round to the gentleman's stables; he will not
take no for answer-he has suggestions to make concerning the animal's appearance, and hints the difference
a little " touching-up "would make; all the while fussing
about his four-legged enemy, pulling open its eyelids
and staring impudently into its eyes, wrenching its jaws
<pb n="47" id="p.47">
asunder and examining its teeth, poking its withers, and
investigating its hoofs. Decline his services flatly as you
may, an uncontrollable itching, a right of further handling of the beast, possesses him; and though he be absolutely driven away, there presently he is again, hovering
about your quadruped like a baffled bobfly.
<p>To return, however, to Mr. Spavinger's horse auction.
Penetrating the gloomy archway, you come to a sort of
open court, paved with those ingenious instruments of
torture " cobble " stones, which, when trod, yielded with
an unpleasant and inodorous oozing. Flanking one side
of the auction-yard was a row of squalid stables, and
flanking the other side was a double or triple row of such
carriages, and carts, and trucks, as were ordered for the
day's sale. The company, with a praiseworthy endeavour
to avoid the slushy pavement, mounted the various vehicles, while Mr. Spavinger, seated in front of an old cab,
rested the catalogue of the goods against the dash-iron,
and knocked them on the driving-box; while his clerks
sat within, and took the purchase-money and gave receipts
through the window.
<p>Bad enough as all this was, it was still possiblethat fair
dealing might have come out of it had the auctioneer been
an honest man and the company bond fide buyers and
sellers. This, however, was far from being the case.
That ancient and mysterious institution known as
"knocking-out" held freer sway at horse and carriage
auctions than any other, and before it the sale became a
sham and the bidding the merest waste of time. " Knocking-out" at carriage and horse sales of the old school
prevails to this day. There is a rough, ignorant man
residing in a squalid street in the London Road, Southwark, who may be regarded as one of the chiefs of the
knockers-out. He, however, does more in the vehicle
and harness than in the horse branch of the business.
His experience of carriages commenced with costermongers' barrows. He builds them and lets them out at
eighteenpence a-week, and at certain seasons of the year
has as many as seventy so engaged. Not only does he
let the barrows, he also stocks them with any sort of fruit
<pb n="48" id="p.48">
with which the market happens to be glutted. Should
contrary winds so retard the ships that bring cargoes of
pineapples that the fruit is damaged before it reaches the
consignee, the barrow-letter is the first at the Monument
Yard sale, ready to buy damaged pines by the cartload to
the extent of a hundred pounds' worth. The same with
oranges and cherries. This fruit is farmed to the costermongers on the simple plan of " thirds "-that is, a fixed
price is set, and the stock weighed or counted out to the
vender before he starts in the morning, and again when
he returns at night, the produce being apportioned, two-
thirds to the costermonger and a third to the proprietor
of the fruit. During a good season the barrow-master's
troop will easily take among them 30 a day; out of this
he takes ten, besides the rent of the barrows and the
original profit on his wholesale purchase of the pineapples
or cherries.
<p>Lucrative as this " game " must be, it is inferior to that
of "knocking-out," which gives much less trouble, is
accompanied by no risks, and continues summer and
winter. It is conducted as follows:-The before-mentioned barrow-letter and a few choice companions meet at
Mr. Spavinger's on a sale day. There are cabs, and
phaetons, and horses and harness to be sold; and the
merry little troop of " knockers-out," although they have
not the slightest intention of retaining a single article,
intend purchasing at least half the goods presently to be
submitted to public competition. The value of the goods
on which the knockers-out have set their heart, say, is
five hundred pounds; the knockers-out, among them, are
not prepared with as many shillings. That, however, is
not of the slightest consequence. If Mr. Spavinger and
the knockers-out are friends, so much the better; if not,
they "work" before his very eyes, and in defiance of
him; they have done it a hundred times and will do it
again. They have done it so many times that the
habitual resorters to the horse and carriage auction know
them, and at the same time know that there is not the
slightest chance of buying a single article " wanted " by
the banded "knockers-out." They may bid if they
<pb n="49" id="p.49">
please, but the confederates will bid against them-will
bid and buy a horse for twenty pounds worth ten. So the
obstinate, honest bidder may compel the rascals to pay
pretty dear for their whistle, bearing in mind one little
circumstance-that when the obstinate bidding has gone
five pounds further than prudence dictates, the knocker-out may suddenly pause, and allow the honest bidder the
privilege of taking the disputed "lot" at half as much
again as it is worth.
<p>The key to the knocker-out's success is a fear on the
part of the legitimate buyer that he may be suddenly
left in the lurch as above described. The only way,
therefore, to obtain what he wants at a moderate rate is
for him to consult the conspirators before the sale begins.
Says the buyer to one of the knockers-out, "Mr. Blinkum,
I want lot 21, sorrel mare."
<p>"You can't have her," replies Mr. Blinkum; "I've
got her down " (whether he has or no, of course).
<p>"I'm going as high as &pound;17 for her," persists the buyer.
<p>"Well," replies Mr. Blinkum, well knowing that she
may be bought by the gang for &pound;14, "if she is knocked
down to me, you shall have her at that price."
So the game goes on till the sale is over, and then the
gang adjourn to the nearest tavern and the "knocking-
out" commences. Say there are six in the gang. Each
one produces his catalogue, with the articles knocked
down to him notified. The case of Mr. Blinkum and the
sorrel mare, however, will illustrate the whole proceeding.
<p>"Lot 21-anybody want it? " asks Mr. B.
Nobody wants it. One of the clique, however, remarks
that, since it was knocked down at 13, Mr. B. could
afford to stump up handsomely for his bargain.
<p>"I'll give you a crown each to go out" (out of the
transaction), remarks Mr. B.
<p>"I shan't take it," observes a conspirator.
<p>"Then take the mare, and give us a crown each,'
retorts Mr. B., " with a pound to me for buying her."
This, however, does not meet the objector's views, and
he finally agrees, as do the others, to "knock-out" on
consideration of receiving seven-and-sixpence, which
Mr. B. pays, and has still left a profit of over two pounds
<pb n="
50" id="p.50">
on his bargain with the private buyer. In all probability
the gang have at least twenty lots to discuss, resulting in
the division of a very pretty spoil.
<p>Thus it is that so universally is that near relative of the
rogue family, Jeremy Diddler, supposed to be the patron
saint of the genus Equus and all that pertains thereto,
that he must have been a bold man who first ventured
to embark in the horse-dealing business with the
steady determination to elevate it to at least the ordinary
standard of commercial respectability, to establish a public
auction differing from that of Messrs. Betty and Martingale, and Mr. Spavinger, inasmuch as a man utterly
unknowing in equine matters might venture in and buy
a horse or a carriage with the certainty that he will not
be chaffed by stable ruffians or fleeced by the common
horse-sale shark; and that, whatever he may pay for his
nag, ho will be made thoroughly acquainted with its'
faults and failings, if it have any-a repository where the
seller may with confidence bestow his property and regard
its careful keeping as guaranteed. No little perseverance
was required to convince the public that the St. Martin's
Lane Repository was only superior to old Mr. Spavinger's
yard as the gambling hells of the Haymarket are superior
to the skittle-ground attached to the " Pig and Whistle; "
while the host of "knockers-out" and "chaunters" and
" copers," hearing of the scheme, set it down as the old
dodge with a new cloak, and imagined that, by washing
their faces and wearing white neckcloths, they could
entirely meet the new rules. They have, however, discovered their mistake long ago, and gone back to Mr.
Spavinger's, while the public are brought to understand
that the purchase of a horse does not necessarily involve
meddling either with edged tools or foul ones, and that by
the exorcise of ordinary discrimination the first essential
to equestrianism may be obtained as easily as a new coat
or a pound of cigars.</div1><pb n="51" id="p.51">

THE BOAT OF ALL-WORK.</head>
<p>IT didn't rain "cats and dogs" nor "pitchforks;" it simply rained very hard, indeed;
likewise it blew very hard; and having doubts
about the stability of the ribs of my umbrella,
I turned into a little archway in the Strand to
wait till the bluster abated a bit. Though narrow, it was
a deep archway-so deep that vision was baulked by the
gloom that crept up from the latter end of it, wherever
that might be. There was shelter for fifty people at least;
and, standing there alone, I could not help thinking what
simpletons the drenched pedestrians were not to do as I
was doing.
<p>"Now, sir, the boat! "
<p>Full tilt against the notion that I had the archway all
to myself, the observation rather startled me; but, finding
that it emanated from no more formidable individual than
a wizened old fellow in an overwhelming tarpaulin coat
and a sou'-wester with ear-lappets, I at once recovered my
self-possession, and addressed the lunatic, " Which boat,
my friend ? what about a boat ?"
<p>"Every quarten 'our, and it's just up, if you're agoin',"
issued from between the monstrous ear-lappets. Then,
seeing that I was still somewhat perplexed, he good-
naturedly explained: "The Perseverance and the Grasshopper, and them-the 'a'penny boats, don't you know ?
Down here takes you to 'em."
Down there ? Absurd! My first impression was the
<pb n="52" id="p.52">
correct one. The poor old gentleman was deranged. Some
ancient waterman, once jolly and young, but ousted from
his occupation by steamboats, and devoting the remnant
of his life to the burking of his enemy's adherents. Gazing
awfully down the murky, vaulted lane into which the
villain had endeavoured to entice me, I pondered for a
moment on my lucky escape, and then, casting up my eyes
thankfully, saw-
<p>Saw that I had been shamefully unjust to the little
man in tarpaulin. This was the road to the halfpenny
steamboat pier; a board at the entrance to the cavern
announced it, and that no mistake might occur, furnished
a painted hand, with a finger pointing spectrally into the
impenetrable gloom. I no longer regarded the old man
as a dangerous enemy, but as a true friend. Thanks to
the weak ribs of my umbrella in the first place, and him
in the second, there was about to be elucidated a mystery
that had troubled me for years.
<p>So many years, indeed, is it since the matter began
to trouble me that I was still so small a boy as to be
unable to look over a bridge without climbing on one
of the recess seats. So elevated, many a time have I
watched the plain, low-squatting steamboats in question,
ever dingy, ever slow, ever freighted with men who wore
shabby jackets and who smoked short pipes, and by
women just so lip-laden, and who wore cast-off coachman's coats in the winter, and silk pocket-handkerchiefs
on their shoulders and inverted bonnets on their heads
in the summer. Strewn about the decks of the boats,
invariably, were big bags of old clothes and boots and
shoes, and pyramids of scaly hampers bursting with soles
and other fish, and baskets full of oranges and all sorts
of nuts.
<p>Of course there was nothing mysterious-nothing remarkable even-in all this; but what was remarkable
(without doubt it would occur to a child sooner than to a
man) was the air of drudgery that pervaded the length
and breadth of the vessel. On working days it is, of
course, the rule to find the bees of the world's hive wearing
business airs as well as business garments, but work is
by no means incompatible with cheerfulness. Moreover,
<pb n="53" id="p.53">
public conveyances are regarded as mediums of pleasure
as well as business, or why does the 'bus-driver wear a
rose at his button-hole, or steamboat captains indulge in
cigars when a pipe of humble birdseye would afford them
as much gratification, and at a much cheaper rate ? Why
is the scraping of fiddles, the twanging of harps, and the
dulcet notes of concertinas allowed on board steamers that
ply between the bridges, if the proprietors are not aware
that idle, aimless pleasure-seekers comprise a fair percentage of their passengers ?
<p>On board the Perseverance and the Grasshopper, however, things are managed very differently. No harp and
violin, no cigar-smoking captain, no busy venders of
"comic broadsheets;" all dull, and dreary, and weary-
looking, as men are when unremuneratively "hard at
it." For all that the " captain" looks like one, he might
be a hardworking lighterman recently pressed into the service; and as he pensively rests his big hairy arms on the
pipe through which he converses with the sooty man who,
buried in the bowels of the vessel, feeds the roaring fire
and tends the engine, you might fancy him pining for a
haul at a pair of stout barge-oars. As for the passengers,
they are either going to market, and fall of anxious
wonder how they will "find things," and how far their
bit of money will go, or else they are returning from
market, and, having made good bargains, full of business
anxiety to get home and realise; or, not seeing their way
very clearly in the matter of their recent purchase, plunged
in a slough of arithmetic, and endeavouring to extricate
themselves by hideous contortions of countenance and by
all sorts of nervous outspreading and handling of their
dirty fingers and thumbs-it being no uncommon thing
when the numbers, by reason of their exceeding ten, become
embarrassing, for a man to borrow a digit or so of his
neighbour, or for himself to mark farthings and fractions
with a bit of chalk on his various knuckles. The good
ship, meanwhile, as though conscious of the dead weight
of work-of the sweating and bone-grinding for bread
ever burdening her-seems to have altogether lost her
spirits and the buoyancy natural to the boat tribe, and to
<pb n="54" id="p.54">
have settled down a hard-working cobbler-(no, not a
cobbler; cobblers whistle at their work and play at skittles
on Mondays)-a hard-working tailor of a steamer, bending
low at its work, and content to fag from morning till night
for the small consideration of a boiler full of water and an
occasional feed of coals.
<p>The melancholy aspect of the business alone at first
occurred to me; its wonderful feature did not strike me
for some time; when it did, this was it. The Perseverance
and the Grasshopper, and one or two other drudges of the
same family, were ever busy, ever humbly wriggling their
way with their heads to the east or to the west; but whither
were they bound ? At what point on the Thames coast
did the fish and fruit mongers take ship, and where did
they disembark? My inquiries on the subject led to
nothing definite. Ilearnt that the "'a'penny" ones owned
but two piers on the river, and that one of them was
"near Hungerford," and the other "just a stone's throw
from London Bridge." So instructed, I have sought
diligently for the places in question, but never could discover them. About London Bridge were steamboat piers
enough; but the cheapest of them had the fare-one
penny-so conspicuously displayed as to make inquiry
mere impertinence; "near Hungerford" my explorations were equally diligent and equally fruitless. Having
so far explained the business, the reader will the better
understand the pleasure it gave me to find myself fairly
on the track of the mysterious vessels.
<p>Adopting the guidance of the spectral finger, I plunged
into the gloomy alley, but, alas! speedily wished myself
in the open Strand again; for, by-and-by, tiring of the
length of the dismal lane, and fearing that I had mistaken the road, I turned off into the first opening that
presented itself, and went blundering on till I found
myself involved in that horrid vaulted maze formed by
the "dark arches" of the Adelphi. There, looming-
through the foul murk that enveloped the dreadful place,
were the carts and waggons in which slept, till ousted by
the police, the tramps and the houseless beggars. In sly
nooks and corners were little heaps of straw and tan
<pb n="55" id="p.55">
where the " regular" dark-arch lodgers slept. Here and
there upon the arch-walls were green brands left by the
river at its last rising, and more than once the squeaking
and scrambling of rats were plainly audible. Thankful
was I presently to arrive at a gap between the arches
where the blessed light of day shone down, and there I
resolved to wait till somebody happened to pass, and of
whom I could inquire a way out of the pretty pickle I
had got into.
<p>I had not to wait long. First came the footsteps and
voices, and then the forms of a troop of men and women
with fish-baskets and fruit-baskets, and crockery such as
is bartered for old clothes from door to door. " Pray,"
asked I of a man who, having but a little load of fish,
could afford to pause for a moment, " Pray, is this the
way to the halfpenny steamboat? "
<p>"Well, this is one way," replied he. "This is the way
we coves comes, 'cos it's a near cut. 'Spectable coves,
like you, comes down Ivy Bridge Lane, side of the clock-shop in the Strand. Howsomever, 'taint worth while to
go back. You keep straight down, and turn to the left,
and you'll get to where they takes the 'a'pence."
Following his injunctions, I finally arrived at a mite of a
public-house propped, as it were, on stilts out of the river
mud, and embowered in some sort of verdant mass that probably was ivy, but it was so enveloped in the substantial
fog peculiar to certain parts of the Thames shore that I
could not see very distinctly. I could just make out the
sign of the house, however. It was the " Fox under the
Hill."
<p>Nearly opposite to the "Fox" was the hutch where
sat the man who took the steamboat halfpence. If the
business stirring that morning might be taken as a fair
sample of halfpenny steamboat trading it might without
hesitation be quoted as "brisk." It quite dazzled the
sight to watch the dirty paw of the cashier within the
hutch ever darting like a nimble, fine-legged spider at
the halfpence pitched with that air of freedom that distinguishes the British costermonger on to the little board
fronting the pigeon-hole. Likewise, if the passengers
<pb n="56" id="p.56">
about to embark in the Endeavour represented a fair
average, the charwomanish aspect of that worthy vessel
at once ceased to be wonderful. Starting on the service
in the most cheery way, and with every plank and spar
about her as lithe and elastic as the sole use of ash and
yew could render them, a score of trips could not fail to
bring her to her knees, spiritless and jaded as the most
elderly "slop hand" in the employ of those celebrated
merchant "clippers"-A 1, and copper-hearted--Noses
and Sons.
<p>As I expected, I found no nonsense on board the
Endeavour. The fittings were painted an appropriate
lead colour; the forms were square, thick-legged, and
substantial; no absurd caution decorated the base of the
funnel concerning the impropriety of smoking abaft it;
while as for any announcement advising you to abstain
from conversation with the man at the wheel it was rendered quite unnecessary by the sullen and melancholy
that characterised the steersman's purple visage. Looking down into the engine-room, you at once saw that the frivolities of rottenstone and polishing rags were despised.
The Endeavour's engine, as the stoker who came up for a
moment's breath of fresh air informed me, was meant for
work, not to be laughed at by old women and bumpkins
from the country, when I mentioned to him the fact that
the day before I had seen on board a penny boat the
engine rods and valves lustrous as plate-glass, and wearing in a handy chink a sprig of sweetwilliam, as a well-
got-up and ponderous swell might wear a flower in his
coat button-hole. The stoker growled a derisive laugh,
and remarked that he expected soon to see the captains of
"they boats a wearing of cocked hats, and the call-boys
with welwet tights and calves."
To return, however, to the passengers. There were
big brawny men, with their garments spangled with the
stale scales of fish, and wearing broadwise deep baskets
likewise scaly, but speckled red by yesterday's strawberries, the owners, as it will happen when there is
"nothing at the gate " (Billingsgate), being driven from
his customary fishy path to invest his market-money at the
<pb n="57" id="p.57">
"garden" (<placeName>Covent Garden</>). There were big, brawny
women, with great baskets, bound for <placeName>Shorter Street</placeName>,
<placeName>Spitalfields</placeName>, the chief mart for all sorts of flawed and
damaged crockery, to be bartered for " old clo'! " " Old
clo' !" made its appearance in tremendous quantities in
casks, and bags, and bundles, from the fashionable bonnet
shapelessly crushed, but still brilliant, to mildewed
castors, boots, and slipshod dancing-shoes. Beside the
blousy and freckled traffickers in these and other sorts of
goods, there were others, scores of them, who surely had
no money to take to market, nothing to buy, nothing to
sell, but who, tattered, torn, and hungry, were bound to
the docks or thereabouts to see if a job might be picked
up. Being hungry, say you, why not avoid the luxury
of riding and tramp it afoot, comforting the belly with a
little bread the while ? Because, after calculations as
profound as those of men who buy and sell money as
though it were taken in nets at sea, or who dabble up to
their chins-up to the very steps, and over and above the
chimney-pots of their Brompton villas-in tallow or palm
oil; because, having pondered on their empty condition,
and on the inability of man to hoist and carry huge
weights when foot-weary as well as empty, they resolve
that to part with the precious halfpenny is to be a gainer;
or, perhaps, having regarded the approaching dissolution of
their patch-fretted boots, it is evident economy to ride in
a steamboat at the rate of a farthing a mile.

<div1 type="chapter"><head>IX.
THE BONES OF LONDON.</head><p>
<p>WHAT becomes of them all ? Assuming that
the weight of an animal's skeleton is a
twentieth of its entire carcase, and that the
weekly consumption of beef, pork, and mutton,
in London, averages 10,000 tons, the question
is a little more puzzling than at first appears. It is a
question, however, that concerns womenfolk rather than
men, and womenfolk answer it. " It is easy enough to
explain what becomes of the nasty things," says the
mistress; "they are Betsy's perquisites." Betsy experiences no difficulty in advancing the inquiry another
stage, and in a way equally lucid and satisfactory as her
mistress.
<p>"They goes to the rag-shop," says Betsy. So they do,
O paragon of all-work! That, beyond dispute, is a
phase of their career, whatever else may happen to them.
They may be hoarded by the thrifty, thrown into the
dust-bin by the improvident; they may come to the dogs,
even; but to the rag-shop they are inevitably carried.
Who cares what becomes of them after that? With
the "picking" of a bone its existence as an article of
utility is popularly supposed to terminate. Nothing of
the kind. Its career is, as it were, but just commenced;
it had not even attained its proper growth till the day
when it ceased to be a sheep's leg-bone and became a
leg-of-mutton bone, and the basket into which Betsy
casts it is not its coffin but its cradle. Don't despise the
unwholesome, mildewed-looking thing should you by
accident encounter it a month after it entertained you at
dinner. You can't afford to despise it. You may meet
<pb n="59" id="p.59">
it again under very different circumstances. In a gorgeous
brown crackling coat it may yet grace your dining-table;
you may be under obligations to it for the exquisite
flavour of your next spring lamb. You will, moreover,
be pleased not to regard this resurrectionist warning as a
low and greasy attempt at funny writing, but as a serious
fact, and one vouched for by chemists and philosophers of
all schools and classes. Bone manure is, of course, at the
bottom of the secret.
<p>However, the preparation of bones for manure was not
the commencement of the business-that is, of the business I saw transacted at the factory I visited. It is
not often a public scribe gets the chance of a subject all
to himself; but, from some unaccountable reason, a
popular description of bone crushing, and dissolving, and
boiling has not hitherto been written. Perhaps the
inodorous nature of the business may have to do with it.
Well, I confess that, as I approached the waterside premises, and was greeted by a remarkably high-flavoured
breeze, and saw looming in the distance the grimy
chimney-shafts and the long row of waggons and carts
waiting their turns to be delivered of their osseous
burdens, I began to feel faint-hearted and inclined to
retreat. I may here state, however, that in this case, as
in many another of a like kind, beyond the unpleasant
smell, there is nothing objectionable. Dr. Wynter informs us that men and women employed among the
apparently pestilential heaps in dust-yards enjoy even
more than ordinarily good health; and that twenty
tradesmen called promiscuously together, compared with
twenty "sewer-flushers" (the reader has doubtless seen
these fellows with high boots and big lanterns who
descend into the bowels of the City through iron-capped
traps in the pavement), the flushers were found to be
sounder and healthier as a body than the shopkeepers.
In the case of this bone-factory at Lambeth, the proprietor for more than twenty years has lived and brought
up a large family in a house at the end of the yard, and
surrounded on all sides by crushing-sheds and boiling-
sheds, and immense ranges of buildings where the raw
<pb n="60" id="p.60">
material is stored. Some years ago, when this factory-
owner was indicted as the perpetrator of a public nuisance,
he triumphantly brought forward a blooming flock of big
and little boys and girls who had breathed the factory
atmosphere from their birth. The workmen about the
premises fare no worse than the resident proprietor. I
have it from the lips of the men themselves-and many
of them have laboured at the mills and the boilers for ten
and fifteen years-that illness is extremely rare amongst
them, and that during the last terrible visit of cholera-
nowhere so destructive as in the low-lying parts of Lambeth and Vauxhall-not a single "hand" at the bone-mills was affected. An ignorant man, however, averse to
scientific explanation, and led by the nose, might be
pardoned for entertaining an opinion at variance with
that to be deduced from the above facts. Entering the
factory-gate, the evidence offered his visual organs might
reasonably lead to agreement with the verdict already
arrived at by his nose. The place is paved with bones,
walled with bones; there are mountains of them to the
right and to the left, and breast-high they hedge avenues
leading to the various departments. One of these departments is devoted to cookery. It is a long, low shed, and
may be called the kitchen of the establishment. The
cooking utensils are a row of immense coppers capable of
containing, I am afraid to say how many gallons, and the
cooks are big, hairy-armed men, in heavy woollen frocks
and coarse sack aprons. Ladles and spoons are dispensed
with, and their place supplied by pitchforks. As I stand
at a respectful distance, and, peering through the rank
mist that fills the kitchen, see the great cauldrons foaming, pitchy black, and their heavy lids heaving and stirring uneasily, I find my faith in the innocuous quality of
the business flagging,-staunch Dr. Wynter even serving
as an imperfect comforter. I am not reassured by the
proprietor; for, says he, "Don't go closer; you may find
the ammonia too much for you." Yet there were the
cooks as contented and as cheerfully busy as bees in a
hive.
<p>Another department was the mill-room, where the
<pb n="61" id="p.61">
bones, after their gelatine had been extracted in the boiling process, were reduced to atoms. Here there was
nothing to offend the nose, for the material divested of
its fatty matter is as innoxious as wood chips; but the ears
suffer dreadfully. The mill is simply an arrangement of
toothed iron rollers, among which the bones are swept by
a man who stands by a sort of slanting stage above, on
which the bones are heaped, and from which he scrapes
them with an iron scraper. Nevertheless, the unfortunate
particles of skeletons, in passing through the revolving
teeth, emit a sound of crushing, and crunching, and
grinding, impossible to anything but bones, and terribly
suggestive of corporal suffering, the extraction of firmly-
bedded molars and incisors not to be forgotten.
<p>The value of bone as a manure, although discovered
more than a hundred years since, has only been taken
full advantage of since about 1815, when bone-mills were
established in Yorkshire. Previous to that, on estates
where bone manure was used, the material was reduced
to handy bits by the application of a hammer, or else it
was strewn in the cart tracks to be crushed by the action
of the wheels. How it is that the chief substance that
enters into the composition of bone is good to fatten the
land is easy of explanation. The principal chemical ingredient in bone is phosphate of lime - fifty-three in a
hundred of its parts are so composed. Vegetable life is
largely dependent on phosphates for its growth and
maintenance: so largely, indeed, that should the soil
become exhausted of that principle, the crops raised
thereon are sickly and weak, and scarcely worth the harvesting. This was the case in Cheshire at the end of the
last century, and was doubtless occasioned by the constant
and long-continued drain of the soil of its phosphorus in
shape of corn and dairy produce. The rich red sandstone loams of the district were worn out--sucked dry,
as farmers say. More by way of experiment than as a
certain remedy, the exhausted pasture land was dressed
with bone manure at the rate of a ton to the acre, and in
less than three years the value of the said land was
doubled, The turnip hungers for phosphates more than
<pb n="62" id="p.62">
any other vegetable. It has so small a seed that the
quantity of phosphates stored round it for the nourishment of the roots and leaves of the young plant is in a
poor soil by no means adequate to the demand; hence
the necessity of concentrating by artificial means the
vital element about the tiny seed, else those other
essentials to turnip life -carbonic acid, water, and
ammonia-may abound to as little purpose as a windmill
without wind. So it comes about that your discarded
mutton bone of to-day nurses and comforts next spring's
vegetation, and the ox eats thereof-the tender grass, the
matured hay, and the juicy turnip-and waxes sturdy
and stout of limb, and fat enough to be brought to market,
and to be bought by Mr. Brisket, your butcher, who sends
you a joint of the beast, and you are afforded an opportunity of renewing acquaintance with an old friend.
<p>In <datestruct value="1839">1839</> Liebig suggested that the efficacy of bone-dust
as a manure might be vastly increased if it were dissolved
in sulphuric acid. A part of the Lambeth manufactory
is set apart for this purpose. Here is sunk a deep pit
containing a great iron tank, in which the mixing takes
place, 15 cwt. of the acid being added to every ton of bone-
dust. The result of the incorporation is a heavy slate-
coloured soft powder, worth from five to eight guineas
per ton As, however, the animal matter still remaining
in the bone-dust is a hindrance to the blending of the
acid with the earthy matter, there is mixed with it a
considerable proportion of bone-ash from which every
particle of gelatinous matter has been extracted, and
which materially assists the sulphuric acid in its action.
Bone-ash is obtained by the complete combustion of bones
in an open furnace, where the oxygen of the air burns
away the organic matter, and leaves the earthy constituents as a white friable mass. If, on the other hand,
the bone-say a shin-bone-be immersed in an acid sufficiently diluted to prevent its injuring the animal membrane, and yet strong enough to dissolve the phosphate of
lime, the remaining matter will still retain the exact
figure and dimensions of the original bone, and yet be
rendered so flexible that it may be tied in a knot.
<pb n="63"id="p.63">
<p>It must not be supposed, however, that all the bones
that pass through the gates of the <placeName>Lambeth</> factory are
either ground or melted as manure. Some of them are
much too valuable to be so used; as, for instance, the leg
bones of the ox. I was shown tons of these with the
knobs at the ends sawn off, some in cisterns sunk in the
floors and still undergoing the bleaching process, and
others stored in great barrels, as beautifully white as
ivory. Large quantities of these are sent to France and
other parts of Europe, and converted into handles for
tooth and shaving-brushes, children's gum-rings, knife
handles, and cheap combs.
<p>A considerable portion of the <placeName>Lambeth</> bone-works is
adapted to the manufacture of soap from the fatty matter
obtained from the bones. Did space permit, much interesting matter might be written concerning the various
processes; of the coppers, broad and deep enough to
drown a dozen men, and of the mysteries of "mottled,"
and "yellow," and "primrose," together with their comparative merits. One little bit of information that I
gleaned concerning soap may be of value to the thrifty
British matron, and she is heartily welcome to it. Beware
of cheap soap, however proper its appearance may be.
<p>"This," said the worthy soapmaker, handling a "bar"
of unexceptional "yellow," "is as good as the article
can be. This "-he took down another sample, seemingly
of equal quality--"is cheaper by at least a third."
<p>"Inferior material, of course." "Nothing of the sort,
sir! The same material exactly, with this difference-
the cheaper sort (people will have cheapness, you know)
contains a compensating amount of water. It is so full
of it that it is a difficult matter to cut the great block into
bars, but the bars are immediately subjected to such a
heat as dries the outer surface and cakes it hard, giving
it the sound and substantial appearance it now wears."

<div1 type="chapter"><head>X.
MR. DODD'S DUST-YARD.</head>
<p>AS the ground was covered with snow, and the
weather so bitterly cold, that had the mercury
in the glass grown six degrees taller freezing
point would still have had the start of it, I
was in doubt whether Mr. Dodd's "eliminators " would be at work. So I intimated to the " yard
foreman," at whose house I called one morning at the
extremity of the year. As, however, that polite person
pronounced that " nothing but rain licked 'em," I buttoned up my great coat, while he lit his pipe and rolled
up the sleeves of his blue guernsey, and we set off.
There are several "yards" connected with the establishment; but the one I wanted was that devoted to
dust, and I found it between the stabling department
and another, set apart for the reception of monstrous
slopcarts and all else pertaining to scavengering. The
dust-yard was, as near as I could guess, about a hundred
and fifty feet wide and seventy broad, one end opening
on to the main street and the other to the <placeName>Regent's Canal</>.
Flanking one side of the yard were a score or so of
upreared dustcarts, and on the other side, extending
almost from the outer gate to the water's brink, were
great mounds of ordinary dustbin muck; and in the
midst of the mounds-literally, so that in many cases
part only of their bodies were visible-were thirty or
forty women and girls. In view of the canal, the surface
covered with big slabs of yellow ice,-with a rasping
north wind blowing continuously through the yard, and
with frost and snow everywhere to be seen, there sat the
<pb n="65" id="p.65">
"hill-women," girls of sixteen and old dames of sixty,
each holding before her a sieve as large as the top of a
small loo-table, in which she dexterously caught the
huge shovelful supplied by the " feeder," all as busy as
bees, and as cheerful.
<p>As a body, the females evinced by their attire little
taste and less premeditation: indeed, in most cases they
presented an appearance of having crawled through a
bundle of rags, trusting entirely to chance as to the part of
it from which their heads might emerge. It is only just,
however, to mention that the above remarks applied chiefly
to elderly parties, ladies who had outlived the frivolities of
youth; but maidens there were much more scrupulous,
wearing the bonnet fully trimmed and fashionably off
their heads, revealing tresses copiously oiled and evenly
parted. Respecting this latter feature, the advantage of
having light hair was plainly manifest; in all such cases
the parting was plainly distinguishable as a dusty lane
between two hedges; whereas with ladies of raven locks
all that was observable was a centre channel, suggestive
of the system of drainage patronised by our forefathers,
and still to be seen in ancient alleys. Most of the ladies
wore coarse, fingerless gloves, and all of them had great
lace-up boots, such as carmen wear, and great sackcloth
aprons, such as few carmen would care to be burdened
with.
<p>Conversing afterwards with a gentleman in the employ
of the firm, said he, "How they exist is marvellous.
They are here these bitter mornings before half London
have left their beds, and they stay here till dark. I
suppose they have some sort of breakfast before they
come, and something more when they get home; they'd
need, for all they get to eat between times is hardly
worth mentioning. Meat is entirely out of the question A lot of them club together, and about twelve
o'clock one makes a fire of breeze and brews an old
kettleful of weak tea, and this, with a slice or two of
bread, or at most a herring, is their dinner, year in and
year out." To look at them, however, such a suspicion
would never enter one's mind. I have been amongst

<pb n="66" id="p.66">
factory-workers and "mill-hands," and market-garden
women, and assistants at City establishments, but I never
yet met a body of female labourers looking so thoroughly healthy and jolly. Every one was fat, every one
was rosy, and laughing and singing as though it were
capital fun to grovel among the refuse of the town out in
the open air-a Siberian air, bleak and withering. The
least likely-looking of the company was a corpulent
lady, aged about fifty, and with her jaws bound round
with a red rag; but even she was not so poorly but that
she puffed away at a hideous little pipe with an appetite,
and which, without taking her hands from the sieve, she
dexterously shifted to the corner of her mouth so as to
admit of her swelling the chorus of a ditty a leather-
lunged young Irishwoman was at the time singing.
I have since ascertained-and I am thankful for tile
discovery-that my impressions as to the healthiness of
these toilers amongst filth and ashes were not erroneous.
I have Dr. Guy's authority for stating that, despite their
constant and immediate contact with the most loathsome
refuse, they are among the healthiest of our working
population. The medical authority in question states
them to be a "healthy, ruddy-complexioned race-the
healthiest set of men I have ever seen. I do not think,
whether in town or country, such another body of men
could be brought together, except by selection. It is
not going too far to assert of them that, if the comparison were limited to the inhabitants of London, or our
large towns, no score of selected tradesmen could be
found to match the same number of dustmen brought
casually together." It would seem from this startling
statement that sanitarians who protest against neglected
dust-heaps do not know what they are talking about,
and that the Board of Health is quite mistaken in prose-
cuting owners of reeking dust-bins. It should, however,
be borne in mind that, during the operation of sifting,
the dust is exposed in an open space. Despite the well-
known power of ashes to absorb every sort of noxious
emanation, if the hill-women pursued their labours in a
covered building the results would doubtless be very
<pb n="67" id="p.67">
different. To return, however, to the dust-yard. I observed that every sifter had near at hand two or three
old baskets, and that each time she called out " sarve,"
and a youth, by tipping into her ready sieve a shovelful
from a "raw" heap "sarved " her, she gave the fresh
supply a handy twist, so as to spread the material over
the entire surface of the sieve, and proceeded to deal
with it in a way that I could not readily understand.
Resting the outer edge of the great sieve against the
heap before her, and its other extreme on her knees, she
dived into it with both her hands, and went through a
series of evolutions that, for rapidity, were unmatched
by any conjurer I ever yet saw. Whatever it was she
plucked from the sieve, was tossed over her left shoulder,
over her right shoulder, and under either arm, and never
failed to find a lodgment in one or other of the baskets.
"What is she picking out ? " inquired I of my guide.
"She's picking out heverything," replied he. "She's
picking 'hard-core,' and 'fine-core,' and rags, and bread,
and bones, and bits of metal, and cabbage-stumps, and
that sort of awful (offal), and bits of iron, and old tin
pots, and old boots and shoes, and paper, and wood, likewise broken glass. After that's done, she can get along
with the breeze and ashes straightfor'ard."
"She retains the scraps you have enumerated as perquisites, I presume ?" I observed.
"Oh no, she don't ! " replied Mr. Scorch, shaking his
head vigorously. "She retains only what's give to her,
and that's the wood. She don't retain nothing else-
leastways, not if I know it."
"Oh, indeed! all claimed by Mr. Dodd, eh ?
"Wrong again, sir; it's all claimed by me, and I'll
tell you how it's worked. Mr. Dodd employs so many
'collectors'-dustmen as you call them. They go about
the parts the governor contracts for, getting ten shillings
a week, besides what they have give them, and being
obliged to bring in so many loads a day. For a certain
sum I undertake to sift every load and get out of it, for
the governor, the breeze, the ashes, the manure, and the
'core' (broken crockery, oyster-shells, broken bottles, &amp;c.,
<pb n="68" id="p.68">
used for the foundation of new roads). All the other
stuff my women find in the dust belongs to me."
"And you find the rubbish worth saving, eh ?"
"Rubbish! worth saving!" ejaculated the foreman.
"Well, I should rather say I did. You see that building over there ?" pointing out an extensive brick edifice,
crowned with a tall chimney. "Well, the rubbish, as
you call it, is so well worth saving that our master went
to a precious many hundred pounds' expense that it
might be made the most of. It's my warehouse, that
building is, where my rag-sorters, and rag-washers, and
rag-driers work, and where I store everything that is
found out here that may be turned into money. Come
and look at it."
<p>He led the way through the great yard, and close to
the edge of the canal I found the building with the tall
shaft he had pointed out in the distance; and, ascending
some steps and pushing open a door, we entered. With
a creak the door banged to, and suddenly I found myself
in the most curious of all the curious places it ever was
my fortune-good or bad-to set foot. There was noneed
for tedious exploration in discovering the wonders. As
soon as your foot crossed the threshold of the building,
there you were in the midst of them.
<p>"Mind the hole " sharply ejaculated my guide, and
not without reason; for there, dimly revealed in the
twilight that filled the place, and within a pace of the
door, was a black gulf, broad, wide, and of unknown
depth, filled within a few feet of the floor's surface with
old shoes and boots !-thousands, tens of thousands of
them; all sorts, all sizes; baby's first little strapped
shoe, hustled into and peeping out at the gaping toe of
the dilapidated "Wellington," the huge " ankle-jack," the
tramp's boot, with the iron-plated heel worn all aslant, the
heavy uppers botched with twine-sown patches (a wayside job, evidently), and mutilated" tongues," now lolling
at rest above the leather thongs, but plainly revealing
the derivation of the patch-pieces; the dainty satin
dancing-shoe cuddled into the russet, lime-burned foot-casing of the burly brickmaker; the still substantial gouty
<pb n="69" id="p.69">
shoe, longer lived than its master; the narrow-waisted,
fashionable abomination, cursed through its life, and at
last joyfully kicked off because of its corn-inducing propensities: here they were, some blue with mildew, some
still bearing traces of a polish, and some half eaten by
rats; here they were, as many shoes and boots at the
very least as there are legs at a gallows show.
"Of what use are they ?" inquired I of Mr. Scorch,
who evidently regarded me as curiously as I regarded
his old boots.
<p>"Jews," responded Mr. Scorch, with a mysterious
wink, "they knows what to do with 'em better than we
do, mister. What do you think of this lot ? "
The "lot" in question consisted of crumpled-up paper
of every texture and colour, about a ton in weight, and
all of it tolerably clean. I thought it a rather valuable
heap, and told him so.
<p>"You are right," said he. "I get half-a-crown a
hundred for it." Mr. Scorch again winked, and in a
very artful way, as he named the tremendous sum; but
when I reflected that the price he received for his waste
paper was fifty shillings a ton, and that of the article
re-made ranged from forty to seventy pounds for the same
quantity, it seemed to me that by looking about him he
might possibly find a better market.
<p>The next article he introduced to my notice bore so
unsightly and valueless an appearance that the affectionate
way in which he patted and poked it considerably sur-
prised me. It was contained in a huge basket, and more
than anything resembled odd corners and chunks of
muddy wood, or broken, half-burnt bricks.
<p>"We find a tidy lot of that, and I wish we found a lot
more," said he. "It's first-rate stuff, that is."
<p>"For burning ?" was my natural observation.
<p>"Oh, no," replied he; "for eating. It's bread-pigs'
wittles !"
<p>"Come down here," said Mr. Scorch, leaping down
into the shoe-gulf, " and I'll show you my wash-house."
Not without a twinge of nervousness I too leaped and
strode after him towards a dark passage. Just, however, as
<pb n="70" id="p.70">
<p>I was about to turn into it I caught sight, through a
dungeon-like doorway, the iron door of which stood ajar,
of a great chamber, dark as night, the floor of it ribbed
with iron bars, like a monstrous gridiron, and cruelly
suggestive of the Inquisition and the days of the rapacious
Jews and the mild barons.
<p>"Ah," said my guide, politely retracing his way to
where I stood; "that's a queer place, isn't it? Get
inside!"
<p>I cannot lay claim to bravery through entering the
horrid place, because, coming up behind, and being eager
to show it, he pressed me forward and sheer on to the
gridiron. The chamber, which still retained the scent of
burning, was partly filled with crates and baskets.
<p>"This," said my guide, "is our furnace: the shaft
you noticed when you were outside belongs to it. Everything we collect we are bound to get rid of, and, of
course, among the rest, you can't help taking a lot of
rubbish, such as worn-out oil-cloth, old bonnet-boxes,
cocoa-nut matting, and that sort of thing, that can't
possibly be worked in for any purpose. Unless we can
find a shoot for it, there is nothing left but to destroy it
by fire. This is how we do it. If you look through the
grating you will see a hole beneath; well, in that hole
we make a roaring coke fire. Now, if you look up you
will see daylight coming through a loophole to the left;
we have to go up stairs to get at that hole, which is fitted
with a sliding-door of iron. There is shot the "light
stuff," as we call it, which falls on the grating here, and
is at once consumed, without putting the fire out, or even
deadening it."
<p>Glad to escape from the furnace, I begged to be taken
to the " wash-house." I cannot say it was a handsome
place, or a place where a fastidious person would care to
sojourn for a long period; but this I am bound to say:
considering the quality of the goods to be operated on,
and the limited space available for the operation, the
rag-washing apparatus was as commodious as possible;
the proprietor having no further interest therein than a
laudable desire to prevent waste. Along one side of the
<pb n="71" id="p.71">
chamber, and facing a window, were two enormous vats,
capable of holding several gallons of water, and before
one of the vats, and with its nose resting on the edge of
it, was a powerful pump. Connecting this vat with the
second was a spout, and the "washing" was managed by
simply trundling a heap of the filthy rags into the first
vat, and keeping them stirred, a man pumping the while,
and the connecting spout in full action, till from inky
blackness the water in the rag-tub gradually became
clean, and then the rags were raked out, and wrung as
dry as possible.
<p>Not dry enough, however, to be sorted or stacked
away. A drying-room is required, and one is provided;
an iron and brick chamber this was, with a floor of oven-
tiles, and entirely fireproof. Round the walls were fixed
close rows of wire "lines," on which to hang the wet
rags; and overhead, suspended from the ceiling, was a
screen of iron wire, on which to lay rags too small to
hang on the lines; while here and there about the gloomy
apartment were several immense braiers, such as are
used by the layers of gas-mains in public thoroughfares.
It was all very curious; but the air of the place seemed
so heavy, everything was so terribly ashy-ashy rags,
ashy bread, and ashy boots and bones-that I was anything but sorry when Mr. Scorch announced that he had
nothing more to show me.
</div1><pb n="72" id="p.72"><div1 type="chapter"><head>XI.THE COUNTY COURT.</head>
<p>THE first and last and only taste of law I ever
indulged in was at a County Court. It is a
long time ago, and I was new in the brain
market when Judas M'Swill, the publisher,
demurred to the liquidation of a little account
of mine. Litigation was never to my mind, and it was
not until I had seriously impaired a pair of double-soled
shoes in "calling again," that I appealed to one of her
Majesty's Commissioners, who promptly cited Judas and
I to appear before him that the matter might be settled.
It was settled. Judas paid the money, and has I hope by
this time recovered the painful extraction. I have spent
the money, and forgotten even what I bought with it, so
we will say no more about it. Indeed, the little affair
would never have been mentioned at all, only, as I was
bound to account in some way for my presence at so
undesirable a place, I saw no particular reason why truth
should suffer.
<p>About the ways of the Court, therefore, or the laws
which regulate its working, I am as ignorant, as I should
wish to remain. I don't even know for certain whether
or no a man who owes a debt, and won't or can't pay it,
may be remitted to prison from time to time for the term
of " forty days," and for all the days of his life; and am
by no means assured of the accuracy of the popular belief
that you may with impunity owe a man threepence-
halfpenny, or threepence threefarthings even-that you
may at once embark in the business founded by <persName>Jeremiah
Diddler</>, and, while you keep your individual defalcations
<pb n="73" id="p.73">
at threepence-threefarthings, may laugh your creditors
to -scorn, and defy them to set the law at you. But
beware of owing the other farthing. That is the other
little coin that breaks the back of the law's patience.
Threepence-threefarthings, if you please; throw in another fourth of a penny, and up goes the County Court
Commissioner.
<p>I certainly might have ascertained more about these
matters if, instead of lingering about the lobby till the
crier cried " Greenfinch v. M'Swill !" I had remained in
the body of the Court and joined the bare-headed motley
crowd that, thick as cattle in a cattle-ship, crowded the
narrow space that fronted the judicial bar. Here again
my ignorance of County Court practice bothers me. Ten
o'clock is the hour at which the doors of the Court are
opened, and at ten o'clock the whole number of plaintiffs
and defendants concerned in the day's business-to the
number of at least three hundred-are bound to attend;
and, packed in the stifling justice-room, hanging about
the stone-paved lobby, or beguiling the time at the public-house next door, and over the way, and round the corner,
wait till their "case" comes on, which may happen at
twelve, two, or four o'clock, according to the programme.
The sum for which County Court litigants may set the
curious machinery of the law in motion is certainly very
low, and they can scarcely, while enjoying the sweet
spectacle, expect first-class accommodation at third-class
fare here any more than elsewhere; but why they should
be condemned to corn-crushing and suffocation before
ever their causes are tried seems, to an ignorant mind,
somewhat inexplicable.
<p>It was a curious mob that crowded that mite of a Court.
There were placid-faced debtors, with whom owing money
was a natural weakness, and one they were perfectly resigned to; and shame-faced debtors, who, perspiring
freely, keep in the rear of bulky people, and who were in
agonies when a move in the business shifted their screen
and exposed their guilty presence to the majority of the
assembly; there were saucy debtors, who from the shadow
of their bonnets regarded their creditors defiantly, and
<pb n="74" id="p.74"> or,
with a wag of the head that plainly expressed, " Much
good you will get by this business, my friend;" and meek,
used-up, listless debtors, on whom the shadow of the
"forty days" had already fallen, who were used to " forty
days," and regarded their advent with dull eyes, significant of spirits whipped to rags by adversity. Of the
genus Creditor the samples were as numerous. There
was the hard-faced, bullet-headed man, looking as pugnacious at least as a " second" at a prize-fight, and who
had come there to "have it out," who looked out constantly for the Judge's eye, and when he caught it smiled
at his Worship in a friendly way, and winked softly, as
much as to say, "My case will be on directly; if it don't
astonish you, never trust me again." There was the
smug-faced " tally" rascal, and his brother, the director
of the Cent.-per-Cent. Loan Office, both to be known by
the pencil behind their ears and the slip of paper in their
hands, and each looking as complacent as might a fox
that, having run down and lamed a rabbit, was content
to lick his lips awhile and contemplate its picking. Then
there was the nervous creditor (as was Greenfinch), whose
debtor was cunning and eelish, and might be expected to
glide through the meshes of the law, leaving the creditor
richer in nothing but experience. Very curious, too, was
it to observe the gulpings, and winkings, and mumbling
of lips indulged in by plaintiff and defendant and witnesses, conning over the neat things they meant to say to
his Worship when come to his awful presence. Ah ! those
gulpings and winkings ! How much good conscience is
swallowed and put to sleep during the process! It is
terrible to think how much; for it may be safely assumed
that in seven cases out of every ten that come before the
Judge of the Debtors' Court, A. will solemnly swear that
white is black and B. that black is white, so that the
real evidence in -the case is of no weight at all; and the
Judge, on the strength of his experience, awards a verdict
to the most modest perjurer of the two.
<p>As a rule, however, when fiscal foemen pass the
threshold of the justice-hall, personal feeling is tacitly
sheathed, and no more formidable weapons displayed than
<pb n="75" id="p.75">
figures, assertions that are more or less facts, and hard
swearing. Decorum is insisted on. Mrs. M'Turvey, who
lent her best shawl to Miss Donovan-a favour which
that person acknowledged by mortgaging the garment for
enough money to enable herself and the bridegroom to
get dreadfully tipsy, and while in that state to fall on and
maltreat the entire Turvey family-much as the outraged
Mrs. M'T. maybe stirred by a recital of her injuries, she
does not allude to the aggressor in stronger terms than as
a "woman" and a "person." The weak-kneed tailor
who summonses Mr. Levy for 10d., the price for making
a pair of the celebrated "Peckham" trousers, is bound,
in deference to his Honour's awful presence, to allude to
his bone-grinder as "that gentleman." If you would see
debtor and creditor au naturel, you must not go beyond
the lobby of the Court. Here the shoemaker meets his
tardy customer, and wishes to know if "things is to go
on, or is he to be paid as a gentleman should;" and the
general dealer meets the out-o'-work carpenter's wife, and
discusses with her the payment of that long bread-and-butter score; and the bland undertaker meets the poor
soul in black crape, that she and he may presently stand
before the justice-seat to argue why an execution should
or should not be levied on the widow's goods. Not that
it must be imagined that County Court law is an instrument whose sole use is to aid the strong Right against
the unfortunate Wrong, or to hamper the feet of those
steeped in misery till nearly drowned. Without its
intervention much roguery would go unchecked, and
simple honesty go lean, while clever chicanery fattened.
It is the disciples of this latter school, especially,
who are anxious for "lobby" settlements. They evade
the Commissioner as the sufferer from toothache evades
the dentist, and, to get off quietly, will pay down their
money rather than have it forcibly extracted by judicial
forceps.
<p>Within the lobby, and lurking about the outer steps,
may any hour of the day be seen dodging and worming
in and about the disputatious throng, restless as ants and
impudent as flies, certain sharp-shanked, seedy sharks,
<pb n="76" id="p.76">
who, having somehow picked up a few scraps of legal
knowledge, set up as public advisers on a small scale.
They don't pretend to fees (they know enough of criminal
law not to risk that). Anything will do, a shilling or six-pence, or-or, indeed, anything but odd half-pence. The
tactics of some of this fraternity are ingenious. Brown
disputing an account with Robinson, endeavours to settle
matters without going into Court. Brown doesn't succeed,
and the disputants part company. Long-eared Shark has
overheard something of the case and the names of the disputants. Two minutes afterwards Shark taps Brown on
the shoulder: "I say now, Mr. Brown," says he, "let me
prevail on you to come to some arrangement with Robinson: save hearing-fees, you know; and from what I know
of the case, it will certainly go against you." That is, of
course, according to his version of the story. You
could put a different complexion on the matter, eh?"
"Well, well, don't mind me; I'm no more Robinson's
man than yours-just a lawyer friend, who doesn't like
to see honest men quarrel." Robinson's lawyer, thinks
the affrighted Brown; and for his credit's sake proceeds to
put the legal gentleman in possession of the facts of the
case, together with the terms he will come to. "And
suppose I bring him to accept?" inquires the Shark,
significantly. Brown has heard of the constitutional
roguery of lawyers, and thinks it nothing very dreadful
to avail himself of the perfidy of Robinson's adviser at the
expense of half a guinea. Straightway is Brown's overture carried to Robinson, who, making sure from the
Shark's knowledge of the case that he is specially retained
by Brown, comes to terms, and the business is completed.
As it is generally understood that County Court Judges
are apt to favour the victims of the "tally" trader's
machinations, and to dislike his representative within the
Court, there is another to be found in the lobby with whom
"terms "-say the expense of the summons and five shillings for the creditor's trouble paid down, and the weekly
payments to go on as usual-may be made. Or perhaps
the debtor's employer will be responsible for the debt,
or one or two of the tally debtor's neighbours will " put
<pb n="77" id="p.77">
their names" by way of security. I saw one of the above-mentioned Sharks who had pinned what seemed to be an
engineer behind a pillar, and, being a little inquisitive to
know the Shark's tactics, I leant against the other side
of the pillar. "Oh, no " exclaimed the engineer, "it
ain't a tally debt-leastways it ain't now; but it was.
Three pun' fourteen the bill was last Whitsuntide, and a
weskit, and a shawl and a pair of military heels for my
missus, was the things. Well, we brought it down to
two pun' fifteen, and then I fell slack. Then he comes
and he says, ' You're a respectable man; why don't you
borrow the money ?' Says I, 'I wouldn't like any of my
people to know as I wanted it; besides, it ain't so easy
to borrow as to talk.' 'Well,' said he, 'borrow it at a
loan-office. I wouldn't press you, but I must make up
a bill by Tuesday. Borrow it at Sloman's, and I'll be
your security. Borrow five pounds, and then you'll have
a little for yourself after you've paid me.' So I agreed.
Let's see ! Two pun' fifteen to him, sixteen and tenpence
stopped for interest and that-well, I got about three
'arf-crowns. Now, you know, it stands this way. The
tallyman, being my security, was obliged to pay the 'rears
of the loan, which it's all 'rears, besides a jolly lot of fines;
and now he summonses me, which of course it's his right,
and I'll pay him if he gives me time. I've got work now,
and I'll pay him five shillings a week, if he'll take it."
"Ah, well," said the Shark, " I'll go and see what I can
do for you." That he did something satisfactory I am
pretty well certain, for, on passing up the street shortly
afterwards, I saw the engineer and the Shark emerging
from a public-house.</div1>

CHRISTMAS EVE IN BRICK LANE.</head>
<p>It is, of course, hard to say, honest poverty is
so prodigiously wary of betraying itself; but,
if certain signs and tokens are trustworthy,
this will not be such a very hard Christmas
with the poorest of our brethren.
<p>Nor is this comfortable conclusion based on tabular
statements and statistics. It is not because the casual
ward of St. Grudgeabone's-in-the-East is not more than
half full, or that, in happy consequence of a dearth of
applicants, the soup-coppers at the charitable kitchen
remain quite full, that I feel authorised to make the
cheering announcement. It is because of the state of the
market-of Poverty Market. I have spent an hour there,
and have seen with my eyes and heard with my ears, and
know all about it.
<p>Of these markets there are more than two dozen, probably; but it makes no difference to me, and under the
circumstances, for they are all alike-alike as oysters in
a barrel. The flavour of one is the flavour of the whole,
and the market-places of the poor may be as fairly sampled
at a single dip. If Dutch plaice are three-halfpence each
in Brick Lane, Bethnal Green, they will be at four for
sixpence in Strutton Ground, Westminster-not a farthing
more or less. If clod of beef is at fivepence in Leather
Lane, a journey to Clare Market, with a view to buying
it at fourpence-halfpenny, will be fruitless. The gin-shop
doors of Whitecross Street; and the Lower Marsh at
Lambeth, and at Brill Row in Somers Town, swing in
unison, as though held by a single string; and behind the
<pb n="79" id="p.79">
doors, and between them and the flashy ginshop bars, it
is uniformly high tide of roaring, turbulent drunkenness,
or dismal low tide and a silent shore-yellow, strewn with
sawdust, like the sands of the beach, and waiting for the
flood. At such times, when you see Mr. Speckles, of
the " Upas Tree," nigh to Liquorpond Street, yawning
in discontented idleness, you may, if you happen to be of
a speculative turn, take small odds that a hundred similar
licensed jaws are elsewhere as dismally ajar.
<p>Or the depth of London poverty may be gauged by a
little observation of the frequenters of either of these
market-places. Wait until the gas is lit, and then (it
should be on a Saturday night or a Christmas Eve) manfully make a plunge, and go with the human tide that
rolls and surges through the narrows of, say, Strutton
Ground, Westminster. Note the bricklayers, and the
masons, and the carpenters-you will know them readily
enough; and if you find amongst them a goodly sprinkling of those who, by the angle of their short pipes and the
cock of their cap-peaks, are evidently breeches-pocket-proud, you may know without further inquiry that
"things are fairish." Likewise, it is a good sign to see
flowers in the bonnets of the women, and a "keeper" as
well as a wedding-ring adorning the marriage finger;
indeed, this latter is a very significant sign, as will be at
once understood when it is explained-I have it from a
credible party, and one who would not "lend his ears,"
or indeed anything else, except in matters that were
reliable-that, "as soon as ever things get shaky, the
'keeper' and father's Sunday silk handkerchief are the
first things put away. One or two may come at brisk
times to admit of going to the play or an unexpected
raffle, and go with the common run of business and without particular notice; but when they drop in three and
four of a morning we know how things are going, and
could tell you almost to a day when we should be pretty
full of Wellington boots, and fancy waistcoats, and summer
shawls and gowns. It's a long chain, if you take the
separate links of it; but, lor ! how soon it's wound up!
If there's a largish family, they'll come at the clock in
<pb n="80" id="p.80">
six weeks; and I tell you, sir, when you see a working
man pledging his clock, you may know that he's pretty
well wound up. Yes, sir, it's getting close to the wedding-ring then. That I look on as the last link in the chain;
and it's curious, too, considering how they go together,
as one may say, that the keeper should be the firstlink
and the wedding-ring the last."
<p>"Especially," said I, "as the value of this last link-I mean the pecuniary value-must be considerably more
than that of many of the other links."
<p>"Well, if you come to that, you know,' said Mr.
Backitt, shaking his head dubiously, "upon my word,
and although they're lumbersome and take up a deal of
room which can be ill spared, I'd rather take in flock beds,
and I've a good mind to say flat-irons, than wedding-rings. The worst of it is, the thinner and more worn the
things are, there's the more fussing over them. They
come cheerful enough sometimes; then they are good
thick rings, without more than a year or so of wear taken
out of them, and it is buxom young women who bring
them, pleasant, and not unwilling to pass a little joke
with one; it is the middle-aged and the old women who
are the teasers. They never think of pulling off the ring
before they get into the box, and there you may see 'em
wetting their bony old knuckles, and trying to screw it
off with their finger in their mouth, and perhaps piping
their eye all the time. You might think the picture was
a funny one by only hearing a description of it, but you'd
be of quite another mind if you came to see it. The sums
they'll ask on the thready old things, too, would frighten
one if he was not well used to it; they never think that
their wedding-ring is of less value than when they bought
it; indeed, I really do believe they think it is more
valuable; and they'll talk in that earnest way, bless you,
that you'll find yourself lending quite the melting price
if you are not careful. I generally get out of serving
'em if I can-turn 'em over to my young man-all a
business fellow, sir, I can tell you, and will prosper. The
old women don't come it over him. 'Now, then! how
much on the old hoop ?' says he, and then slips it on his
<pb n="81" id="p.81">
little finger, and writes off the ticket as coolly as though
he was taking in a dog-collar."
<p>However, to return to my subject at the point where
Mr. Backitt broke in upon it. If, as you elbow your way
through the crowd in Poverty Market, you discover such
signs of prosperity as I have mentioned, you may make
your mind easy that business is slack at the workhouse
bakeries within and without the city, east, west, north,
and south. On the other hand, if the majority of the
men you meet wear their heads deep in their capes; if they
wear their jackets buttoned high and both their hands in
the pockets thereof; if their eyes are downcast, as though
good luck had somehow escaped from them into the
gutter, and they were there looking for it; if such as have
their wives with them allow them to press ahead a pace
or so (the reader may have observed how that sometimes
when a team came on a bit of heavy road the arrangement
of the cattle will be altered, and, until the difficulty is
surmounted, the great brown horse gives precedence to
the little grey one, who, without half his strength, has
six times his capacity for manoeuvring and wriggling out
of ruts); if the said wives have pursed mouths and eyes
eloquent of arithmetic; if their thin shawls hang squarely
at the shoulder parts; if at the greengrocer's a monstrous
quantity of potatoes are shot into their big-bellied market-baskets, you may know that wherever you meet the poor
man in and about London he is "hard up."
<p>If throughout the year there is a season during which
more than any other a poor man is in danger of getting
" hard up," it is most decidedly at Christmas time. He
is so much at the mercy of the weather. If he is a brick-layer or a bricklayer's labourer, or a stonemason, or a
plasterer, or a navvy, or a gardener, or any one of a dozen
other avocations which might be enumerated, a heavy
frost falling in the night debars him from bread-winning
as effectually as though fetters had grown to his wrists
while he slept; and, without being either a gardener or a
bricklayer, it is easy enough to imagine what it must be
to the frostbound father of a numerous family, and Christmas within a few days' stage. How the enthralled man

<pb n="82" id="p.82">
must find himself eagerly listening to his wife's prognostications concerning her corns and a change in the
weather ! How irritated he must feel to hear her grinding
at the same superstition at the end of a fortnight, and the
frost still pinning the earth with the tenacity of a bulldog at the throat of an enemy! How he must be tempted
to kick that provoking cat, who will persist in sitting
with her back to the fire, a sure indication of frost! Nor
is frost the only enemy with whom the poor willing
worker has often to contend against for his Christmas
beef and pudding. Daylight is but nine hours long; and
even though he allow himself no longer midday rest than
suffices for the swallowing of his scanty dinner, "three-quarters " is all the time he can make. Cowardly coughs,
and fevers, and influenzas attack his little children at
their weak and worn boot-soles. The rent collector must
clear his books, by hook or by crook, he says-and his
tenant knows what that means-by the twenty-fourth.
Dr. Bunney sends his lad with a sharp little note,
reminding the already much-perplexed parient that little
Charley, who has commenced cutting his teeth, has not yet
been paid for ! "It never rains but it pours !" says the
poor fellow, as, after consulting his good lady, he returns
written word by Dr. Bunney's lad that Mrs. Ginnypeg is
not very well, and would be glad of a call when Dr.
Bunney is coming her way; and that as regards the
little bill it would be an accommodation if she is allowed
to settle the two together. Poor Mr. Ginnypeg ! It's all
very fine for the carol singers to bawl " Let nothing you
dismay! "
<p>Nevertheless, and all things considered, I should judge
from the signs and tokens already hinted at, that the
poor man has known Christmases which have caused him
much more dismay than the present one. My " market
intelligence " is derived from Brick Lane, Bethnal Green;
and, goodness knows, if there exists a market deserving
the prefix "poverty," this is the one.
<p>I have spent an hour among the fierce gas-jets, and the
clash of butchers' knives and steels, and Babel of " Buy,
buy, buy !" and I am of opinion that Mr. Ginnypeg's
<pb n="83" id="p.83">
prospects of a Christmas dinner are at least "pretty fair."
Mind, I don't by any means wish to convey the idea that
I found Brick Lane overflowing with milk and honey-I
did not expect to find it so; but, as an honest reporter, I
am bound to say that, after all I had recently read of this
plague-parish, I expected to find a leaner and more
drouthy state of things than appeared.
<p>The butchers' shops, from the first-floor windows to the
stall-boards, were hung with ribs, and sirloins, and aitch-bones, and shoulders and legs of mutton fat enough to
excite the admiration of an Esquimaux. At Mr. Fag-
gotty's, the pork and sausage shop, there hung a pig of
such vast dimensions that made it a wonder, the natural
perversity of porcine nature considered, how they ever
managed to drive, or back, or sling him through Mr.
Faggotty's narrow slaughter-house doorway. There were
fat geese, and fat turkeys, and holly-berry devices on
bladders of lard in the cheesemongers' windows, and on
the surface of half-tubs of butter. Good signs every one
of them, and significant of feasting, but not the signs and
tokens I especially allude to, for all that.
<p>It was the absence and not the presence of certain
eatables from Poverty Market that impressed me favourably. Chief of all was the almost entire absence of fish-
of fresh fish, understand (of dried, in the form of haddocks
and bloaters, there was an unusual quantity, which was
satisfactory, inasmuch as it betokened luxuries for tea or
breakfast). Now, any one at all conversant with the
ways of poverty, knows that the quantity of fish it consumes is enormous. And no wonder. For sixpence a
piled-up dish may smoke on the dinner-table; whereas,
if the money was invested in butchers' meat, even of the
coarsest and scraggiest description, a dinner-plate would
contain it, with a fair margin for potatoes. At ordinary
times the most conspicuous feature of Poverty Market is
fish. Every third stall is a fish-stall; tons of plaice, of
soles, and cod are sold in a single market-place in a single
day. When fish fails, there is consternation among poor
mothers, and general cheerfulness among butchers with
mutton-scrags and offal to dispose of.
<pb n="84" id="p.84">
<p>Yet, to be always having fish for dinner, even though
he is fond of it, has about it a smack of poverty under
which the poor man does not rest easy. With his fair
five shillings a day, he will not object to fish for supper
as often as you please; but he'll have beef, or mutton, or
bacon for dinner. In fact, his patronage of fish lasts only
during his " hard up " periods, and by this token to-night
he is not hard up; the few straggling fish-stalls have no
attraction for him or his wife; their sole attention is for
the butchers and the abounding animal fatness about
them.
<p>Another ordinary feature of Poverty Market, now
pleasantly missed, is the stall whereon is sold penny
lots of vegetables for the pot-the three turnips, the
onion, the half carrot, and the leak. These are the ingredients which, with a pound of scrap meat, form the
family "stew." Doubtless there are worse things than
a stew for dinner, but it is not quite the thing for Christmas. If nothing better may be had, why-- But,
thank goodness, something better may be had this
Christmas, and the penny vegetable lots are not wanted.
I counted but four from one end of Brick Lane to the
other, and even they had cheeringly added horseradish to
their business.
<p>Another good sign was that the lemon trade was brisk.
Moses and Isaac, while they despise the great Christian
festival, were not above making a shilling out of it, and
elbowed their way through with their mat baskets over
their shoulder and a double handful of the yellow fruit,
shouting " two a peddy lebbod" as earnestly as though
their lives depended on the sale. Now the lemon and
destitution are not likely to be found together; one can
scarcely imagine a dinnerless family sitting round a
yearning firegrate sucking lemons. No; the lemon is
good, for its peel sake, in the manufacture of apple-pies;
it is desirable as adding pungency to the glass of grog.
Probably it is useful in many other ways; but the two
mentioned are enough for the purpose, and I can only
repeat that when I saw so many lemons about I observed
to myself,  "Here's another good sign."
<pb n="85" id="p.85">
<p>I might go on to a column's length in my enumeration
of good signs. I might speak of the crowded state of the
shops of the grocers at which pudding-clubs were held;
of the prevalence of toy-sellers; of the prodigious quantity
of holly and mistletoe about; of the roaring trade driven
by the man with the newly-invented roasting-jack, and
who exhibited a wooden goose revolving in the most satisfactory manner. I might discuss these things and many
more, but I have no time; it is now nearly ten o'clock,
and when I left Mr. Backitt, in the early part of the
evening, he had said, "Just give me a look in about ten
o'clock. I'll tell you what sort of a Christmas it is with
'em." So I made haste to Mr. Backitt's.
<p>There is no affectation of gentility about Mr. Backitt's
premises-no "offices next door," or boxes with catch-latches in the passage for shame-faced poverty with a
watch to pawn; the space before Mr. Backitt's counter is
nearly as large as that before an ordinary gin-shop bar,
and as free. Like a gin-shop door, that of Mr. Backitt
is kept ajar by a strap, and I give it a push, with the
intention of walking in. But I could not push it far
enough to squeeze in; the shop was crowded chiefly by
women and girls; there was much gossiping chatter, a
frequency of abusive remarks addressed to Mr. Backitt
and his perspiring young man, and a strong odour of gin,
so that the likeness of Mr. Backitt's place of business to
a gin-shop did not cease at the strap-held door.
<p>"Will you allow me to pass, Miss ? " I said to a young
lady of thirteen, who, although already borne down by
bundles, was fiercely demanding another "Pashely shawl
-name of Tigg !"
<p>"No," said she, "I shan't! Give us hold of your
tickets, and I'll give 'em over to Samuel, if you like."
<p>"But I haven't any tickets," said I.
<p>"Oh, you wants to leave," observed the damsel, laughing. " I wish you luck, old boy; they won't take anything in, bless you, while there's so much deliveries. It's
as much as they'll 'part.' There was a poor soul, about
half an hour ago, who wanted her old man's westkit
away from his trousers, and do you think they'd let
<pb n="86" id="p.86">
her have it ? No! Mr. Jackanapes Samuel says, says
he--"
<p>"Shawl, three shillings; Tigg !" at that moment bellowed the young man in question.
<p>"Here!" screamed Miss Tigg, poking up a long
parcel, as an indication where she was to be found; and
having secured the "Pashely," she went off, saying no
more to me.
<p>For full a quarter of an hour I tried hard to catch Mr.
Backitt's eye, but in vain; it was as much, nay, more,
than he could do to count up interest and take money,
and bully the boy up the spout for not throwing down
the parcels with greater expedition. Meanwhile the mob
came swarming in, and the clamour became so deafening
that I was glad to escape, without having Mr. Backitt's
opinion as to " the sort of Christmas it was with 'em," it
is true; but I much doubt if he could have regarded that
till full of redemption-money, and pronounced Christmas,
1863, a very hard one.

THE HIGHWAY PASTOR.</head>
<p>THE Gubbings family, of <placeName>Twister's Alley</placeName>, <placeName>Seven
Dials</placeName>, and of <placeName>Keate Street</>, <placeName>Spitalfields</>, and
of <placeName>Kent Street</>, <placeName>Southwark</>, will not go to
church. Throw open the portals wide as may
be, ring the most inviting peals from belfries,
announce, in large type, that a bishop will preach, and,
in larger type still, that no collection will be made; invite Gubbings specially by calling him "dear brother,"
or, generally, by proclaiming that the attendance of
working men "in their jackets," and with their wives
and families, is particularly solicited-it's all of no use.
The Gubbingses, as a body, look on each endeavour as a
"dodge;" and, though they may give you credit for
extreme artfulness, are-to use their own expressive
language--" not to be had." You may even take possession of Gubbings's theatre on the only evening of the
seven that he can spare it, absolve him from the customary
threepence, and admit him free to pit or gallery, set the
footlights blazing, and fill the orchestra with hymn music;
still Gubbings winks his superiority to your machinations,
and presents you the back of his ragged coat.
<p>Gubbings's present ways suit him; they are hereditary
ways, convenient to meet, and requiring no exertion.
He can lie till ten on Sunday morning, and enjoy till
dinner-time-beyond if he prefers it-the luxuries of an
unwashed and unshaven face, and tobacco unlimited. If
he keeps pigeons he can go out and fly them; if dogs,
take them to the sporting barber's (there is always a
sporting barber in Gubbings's neighbourhood), and get
<pb n="88" id="p.88">
their ears cropped, or their tails bitten off. Maybe he
has his donkey to " clip," or a spoke to put to a wheel of
his barrow; or he keeps a "battling finch" (a goldfinch
pitted to sing against another for money), and, as the
said finch is supposed to improve in tone and steadiness
of voice if shut out from all distracting sights, Gubbings
sets about blinding it by poking its optics with red-hot
needles-cambric needles, five of them with their points
clustered like a diamond, and lashed at the end of a bit
of stick; if he be a humane man he merely scales the
eyes of the poor little battler by scorching them till
covered with a film, which after a time will wear off, and
the tortured goldfinch regains his sight again. These
are a few of the goods in which Gubbings traffics during
church time. If you have anything of a more attractive
character to offer, bring it to his door. He can't run
after you. You are the seller, and you must wait on
him if you want to deal.
<p>Who is to do it? Where is the man so daring as to
set up his tent in the midst of the Gubbings colony, and
offer to the inhabitants new lamps in exchange for the
blear-eyed stenching things that glow snugly in places
unknown tothe sun-goods shunned and cold-shouldered,
and which cannot find acceptors or store-room till heaps
of long-garnered and comfortable evils are swept out
and abandoned? Who is the bold pioneer who will, all
alone, penetrate to the very nucleus of these hotbeds of
crime and ruffianism, and there taking his stand declare
to the beetlebrows, and threatening eyes, and sneering
pipe-laden mouths gathered around, that they are all
wrong, and ought to be ashamed ? Whenever you come
across one such, you see a hero, and, considering the
dearth of heroes in these nail-driving, man-shearing
times, a man worthy of your respect. I, however, by
no means promise that you will invariably find the highway preacher either a person of refined education or
clerically attired. He may-nay, undoubtedly will-be
found wearing a black suit and a white neckerchief; but
ten to one, if the fingers that turn the leaves of the good
book are not corned with the hammer and chisel, or scored
<pb n="89" id="p.89">
and channeled by constant tugging at "wax-ends," or
that the top of the middle finger of his right hand seems
newer and cleaner than any other portion of his digits,
because of its constant thimble sheathing.
<p>Neither are the pills that he administers to the ugly-hearted Gubbings sugar coated. The horny sheathing
that envelops Gubbings's understanding is nearly as
invulnerable as the grimy cuticle that covers his carcase,
which fact may go a long way towards meeting the
charge of rant and bawling directed against highway
pastors generally. Delicately-pointed logic will never
puncture Gubbings's conscience; it will merely tickle it,
and make him laugh. He must be speared-clubbed;
his hard-set sin must be riven from him, as stubborn
rocks are blasted with gunpowder. It's not the least use
smoothing and patting Mr. Gubbings, and offering him a
new life for his old in an affable whisper; he will certainly take it as part of the forcing-him-to-church dodge,
and resist it as such. No; you must meet him on his
own ground; you must-metaphorically, of course-take
the collar of his jacket in both your hands, and, looking
him hard in the face, say (supposing the sabbath question to be the one under discussion), "Now, look here,
my friend. Suppose you were suddenly to find yourself
hungry, and naked, and helpless in the world, and some
one on whom you had not the least claim were to take
you by the hand, and say, ' See; here are seven guineas.
Take six of them, and therewith provide yourself with
food, and lodging, and clothes; the seventh guinea is
mine, and you must not ask it of me.' Don't you think
you would be a great scoundrel to break into the good
man's house and rob him of the remaining guinea?"
"I'd like to ketch anybody I knowed doing sich a
thing," responds Gubbings with a significant scowl.
"Nobody 'ud do it-it's agin natur," murmurs the
audience, wagging their heads till their sparse hirsute
crops so recently browsed on by gaol scissors quiver
again. "I know it is against nature," retorts the loud-voiced preacher; "nevertheless, you do it, and worse,
everyweek of your lives. It is of something a million
<pb n="90" id="p.90">
times more precious than guineas of which the Great
Giver of all things is robbed. Here is his written command, 'Six days shalt thou labour,'" &amp;c., &amp;c. Argument,
of which the above is a weak and tame sample, appeals
direct to Gubbings. Its immediate effect is that he regards
you with the same sort of savage admiration with which
he regards Detective Twitcher, when that admirable
and ferret-like officer gains a clue as fine as a hair,
follows it up, and knots it and weaves it till his man is
netted in a net with meshes strong as cables. Maybe
when Gubbings gets home and to bed, and is lying awake
in the dark, he will turn the matter over in his mind-the object being to find a side of it that suits him; and if
he finds it, if you have not so roundly handled the said
matter that there is still standing room for Gubbings's
rough-shod feet, he will snort defiantly, and, dropping
to sleep, awake yesterday's ruffian refreshed.
<p>Very far, however, from the truth is it that the highway pastor's flocks are invariably Gubbingses. I know
several spots about London where he holds forth as
regularly as the parish parson in the parish church, and
to audiences as sedate and devout as ever church doors
closed on. At the obelisk in the Blackfriars Road, certain
as the tolling of the Sabbath bells, are to be found a
godly cabmaster and a hatblock-maker, and by the time
the hatblock-maker's sister has taken her brother's hat,
and the text has been found, and the windsor chair
mounted, from every one of the six branching roads
comes flocking the congregation, and, making a big
ring round the preacher, listen sorrowfully to his preaching.
<p>It must not be supposed that these highway gatherings
arise from lack of church accommodation. I can positively assert that, in almost every case, in the immediate
vicinity of the highway pastor's rostrum there is at least
one church (frequently three or four) not more than
three parts filled. How is it? The same religion is
preached by the pulpit and the highway pastor, and the
listeners to the former are accommodated with seats. If
they have not a prayer-book, they may borrow one. When
<pb n="91" id="p.91">
the weather is cold the building is comfortably warmed,
and when the weather is hot it is cool and shady; whereas
the highway preacher's flock is liable to sudden storms,
to chill winds, and to an awful grilling in the summer's
sun. Why don't the hot and tired mob pass through
the churches' free portals and hear the gospel at their
ease ? Perhaps it is that among a few of us so strong a
love of liberty exists that even an hour or so in the body
of a church, with an awkward sensation of "hush"
filling the place, and the boots of a cane-bearing beadle
creaking grimly on the muffled floor, is irksome, not to
say unbearable. Perhaps it is that there are a few, not a
whit more sinful than the best of us, but in whom there
is more modesty, who, having so long stayed from church,
are shy of taking their long-accumulated burdens across
its threshold, preferring to get side-winds of gospel comfort, doing penance the while bareheaded in the sun. I
beg pardon of the numerous body of anti-humbugs for
writing such twaddle; but indeed I can't believe that
the highway pastor's congregation are to a man vile
hypocrites, who mouth prayers and hymns in public
solely that people may see. Of this I am sure. More
than once, more than twice or thrice, I have seen round
the preacher's chair blear old eyes lighted with a light
strange to them, and promising as buds in spring, and
careworn, wrinkled faces, with an expression weird
and mysterious as mistletoe mantling the frosty crabtree.
<p>The labours of the highway pastor are not invariably
bounded by daylight. It was observed that when the
evening service was drawing to a close, and twilight was
deepening into darkness, there came sidling up to the
outer edge of the ring a few terribly shy folks, who for
the previous half-hour had been lurking in the neighbourhood reading stale placards, lounging with their pipes
against walls and posts, or gazing with great earnestness
into the shop windows, appearing as if, of all things,
Gospel preaching was the very last they are thinking of.
Yet, as I before observed, no sooner did a good screen of
darkness prevail than with stealthy steps the shy ones
<pb n="92" id="p.92">
approached the attentive circle to glean a few good words
before the pastor closed his book and bade his flock good
night. The condition of these outsiders, as it were, content to kiss the very hem of religion, resolved the highway
pastor to hold meetings in the dark. The result was
successful beyond expectation. In the <placeName>Mile End Road</>,
in <placeName>Rosemary Lane</>, <placeName>Whitechapel</>; in <placeName>Shepherdess Fields</>,
<placeName>Islington</>, and half-a-dozen places in and about London,
on Sabbath nights, and occasionally on other nights in
the week, the preacher mounts his stand and scatters his
good tidings to a congregation whose faces alone are visible through the gloom.</div1>

EIGHT A.M.-THE MORNING POST.</>
<p>IN one shape or another almost every department of public business has produced its Judas
anxious to betray the trust of his employers,
and to "reveal". such of the arts and mysteries of his profession as, by hook or by
crook, he has become acquainted with. Thus we have
had "Secrets of My Office," " Revelations of a Police
Detective," "Tellings of a Telegraph Clerk," " Diary of
a Physician," &amp;c.; but at present the town has not been
favoured by the " Peepings," or "Pennings," or " Peachings" of a postman. We have "rhyming postmen,"
whose poetic flights are bounded only by a handrail, and
whose style is powerful, as might be expected in those
who so constantly "indulge" in the double-rap-turous.
But for a postman-a town postman-to become merely
a poet is a wretched waste of opportunity. It may be
very well for petty, unliveried, suburban carriers, with
long, straggling beats, to rhyme on their letter-packets,
and so beguile the time as they trudge along; to sing-
<p><lb>" A letter I've got for Sarah Jane,
<lb>Who housemaid is at the end of the lane,
<lb>Where the flower-pots stand on the sill in a row.
<lb>And the hollyhocks and the sweetwilliams blow."
<lb>Or-
<lb>Another I've got for the person who dwells
<lb>At the shop round the corner, and bacon he sells.
<lb>The seal he will break, and read it, I ween,
<lb>By the gas-jet just over the sausage machine."
<p>But although this ringing of his mental mettle may
<pb n="94" id="p.94">
pleasantly tickle the ears of the underpaid peripatetic, it
will draw no money into his purse. It is not enough in
these sensational times merely to edify the public--it
must be startled; and difficult indeed would it be to
suggest a more decided startler than " The Peachings of
a Postman." Really, when one thinks on the enormous
sale of that book; when one, in fancy, reads the advertisement in the morning papers, " Notice ! Ninth edition
of Peachings just out " and dwells on the fat checks
arriving almost daily from his publisher, it is a temptation to persuade some friend in the G.P.O. to procure
you a beat suitable for your purpose, and " go in" for
book-building in the regular way, just as a man makes
a trip to the Amazon or to Central Africa.
<p>For my part, I should prefer a beat that was not too
respectable; and for the very obvious reason that, in
highly respectable neighbourhoods the houses are furnished with letter-boxes, and I should have no opportunity, except now and then by a glimpse of an anxious
face lurking behind the window-curtain, of making myself acquainted with the recipients of the momentous
billets. If I might have my choice, I would choose a
quiet, six-roomed-house beat at Kensington or Camden
Town; and I should not care to make more than one
round a day-the first round, at eight a.m. As far as
the purposes of my book were concerned, it would be a
mere waste of shoe-leather to undertake more than that
single delivery. My gathering would consist entirely of
the secrets of the special epistles of social life, and for
these there is but one post-the eight a.m. post; nor is
it at all surprising that it should be so. Take love-letters, for instance. Calf-lovers may look on all hours
of the day as fit for the exchange of epistolary bleatings,
and, possibly, it is as easy to "boo " passionately all over
four sides of note-paper immediately after breakfast, and
when the knife-grinder, and the chair-mender, and the
cauliflower-vender are abroad, or even on a sultry afternoon and after a hearty dinner, as at any other time.
Easier, perhaps. But your earnest lover never takes
pen in hand till the evening. Sitting in his cell, amidst
<pb n="95" id="p.95">
perfect stillness, he forges love-shafts of so exquisite a
sort that the mere rattling of a window-shutter breaking
in on their incompleteness would shatter them at once.
His delight is to hear the lips of his pen kissing the
dainty sheet, to catch its little rustling whispers as it
spells out the loving words. This, if he is making love.
He, however, may be breaking it instead. Well, quiet
and seclusion are equally essential to his purpose. His
malice is as exacting as hottest love, and it gives him joy
to hear the tiny, black, wriggling snakes hiss as his pen
gives them birth, and at every hatching-each one more
deadly than the preceding-the monster pauses to grin
and rub his hands, thinking how they will sting. No
other hand but the writer's must consign such precious
concoctions to the letter-box; indeed, if the eight a.m.
postman is to deliver the adders, out he must go, letting
himself out and in again with his latch-key, for both his
landlady and Jemima have been a-bed this hour and
more. It may be objected that in outward appearance
the honey-pot would be exactly like the adder's nest, and
I should not know one from the other. Maybe; but, as
I before observed, I should not attempt to glean knowledge of the affairs of my customers by consulting their
written names and addresses merely. I should look out
for the face at the window or at the door, and make note
of such trifles as trembling hands and wan cheeks, and
eyes eloquent of joyful content or sad foreboding; for be
sure the adders are expected, and Miss Alicom Payne is
as certain of her honey-pot as she is that there will be
marmalade on the breakfast-table.
<p>The night being so far advanced, Piercy Beamisher's
missive to Miss Payne does not fall into an empty letterbox. Other evening scribes have already made their
deposits, and higgledy-piggledy lie invitations, accepta-letters; and, as it happens, that addressed to Miss Payne
falls plump atop of a shabby flimsy envelope, with the
postage-stamp stuck at the bottom left-hand corner, and
the superscription ill spelt and villanously askew. It is
addressed to " Shandy Gaff, Esq.," and is the sort of
<pb n="96" id="p.96">
letter that any one, let alone an experienced town postman, may see through with half an eye.
<p>"My dear Shandy," writes <persName>Sarah Brown</>, "for dear
indeed you are though not mine in the holy service of
matrimony but which to make use of your own darling
words doesn't make any odds in the eye of Him that sees
all I couldn't but rite though against your wishes and to
the house which you will say is madness and no wonder
for so I am dear though far be the thoughts of blaming
you. But what could I do with my close gone and not
one farthing for the rares of the nuss who has brought
him back poor little boy plump and beautyful as he was
but now a complete Skelington through the feeding
bottle and me with only power to set and cry to hear his
wining through drying it away to go to service as you
asked my love Her bringing him back made a row at the
loging where I am likewise in rears and called such horrible names as would make your art ake to ear I pray
to God that missus may not take this in and time the
postin so that if possible it may come up with the shavin
water I thought you was ill not having been able to
ketch you going in nor coming out for over a week till
this morning when seein you quite unexpected turn the
wrong way from what you used caused the explanashun.
It is all through not seeing you so long dear that I rite
and only but for the poor little fellow I would brave it
and rather die a 100 times So no more at present from
yours for ever and ever, SARAH BRowN."
<p>But the perusal of Sarah's letter opens my eyes to the
difficulties of my position. My manhood chafes at my
scarlet collar, and my impulse is to thwart the rascally
Shandy by delaying the delivery of the note for just one
little hour, when it will be handed to the traitor at
the breakfast-table, and in the presence of the outraged
Mrs. Gaff. "Yours for ever and ever," indeed! poor
wretch. If you could only see the supreme smirk of
contempt that for an instant distorts the handsome face
of the poor little Skelington's father, as he arrives at this
<pb n="97" id="p.97">
part of your message, you would be not a little dismayed
for your future.
<p>And what about your future, <persName>Shandy Gaff</>, Esq., and
clerk at a Thames-street drysaltery, at a salary of a
hundred and twenty pounds per annum ? Beware that
you do not treat miserable Sarah's pledges of eternal
devotion too lightly. Recollect that there are two-nay
three-to the bargain: herself, yourself, and the Skelington. Yours "for ever and ever" she may not be;
but who says that you shall not be hers? You may
shake her off-that you are bound to do if she will not
fall away quietly; but if you only shake her into the
kennel, where her love for you will rot and turn to
pestilence, you may thereby be brought to death as
surely as though she had clung to you during the shaking-off process-clung to you till she had strangled you.
Consider her appeal before you crunch it up and wedge
it between the bars into the fire with the toe of your
boot. If, however, the poor scrawl is already consigned
to the flames, at least spare a minute to watching its
ashes. If you bring your mind's eye well forward you
may make out some queer shapes. You may make out
a draggle-tail, drunken drab, lying wait of evenings
within a score yards of the threshold of your innocent
house-a hiccupping, loud-mouthed woman, who is for
ever demanding a shilling. If she makes her demands
with nothing worse than sulky insolence you are lucky,
because at times she is tearful, and so full of gin and
gratitude as to be uncertain of her standing, and insists
on clutching you by the arm- and resting her blowsy
bonnet on your shoulder. "Don't push me off," she
says; "don't, my love, do such a cruel thing. I know
my touch is worse than mire to you; but I'm still faithful
and will be, s'help me God ! till I die. I haven't come
for your money, dear Shandy-only to tell you how true
I feel towards you. Kiss me, Shandy, my dear." Do
what ? Kiss her-the hideous thing! Well, there's no
help for it, dear Mr. Gaff. To get rid of her, you must
either kiss her or call a policeman; and the latter you
dare not to. One such evening a policeman came without
<pb n="98" id="p.98">
calling. "Come, cut that! " said he to Draggletail.
<p>"If you don't leave go the genelman and be off I'll put
you where I shall find you in the morning." " What do
you mean, you beast? " asked Draggletail fiercely. "He's
my husband; ask him if he is not ? " " Yes, yes; that's
all right, policeman," said you, and at the same time
winked sheepishly at the man in blue and sneakingly
proffered him a shilling, which he took without so much
as thanking, and walked off with the air of a knowing
man of business.
<p>All this you may make out, gay, young Mr. Gaff, in
the tinder of Sarah Brown's consuming letter. Nor is
this all; the chimney draught carries away the front
wall of tinder, and you get a further insight into futurity.
There he is-a sallow, bony youth, with plenty of neck-handkerchief and no shirt collar, and with his greasy-cuffed coat buttoned tight at the breast, and with the
stump of a dirty pipe protruding from his waistcoat
pocket. This is the Skelington. He used to be very shy
and respectful when he wore pinafores, and waited for
you at a convenient corner in Thames-street, with a note
from Draggletail; but since he has come into a tailcoat
and a pipe, and is, to use his own powerful expression "on
his own hands," his tone has altered considerably. Hear
his voice in the crepitation of the paper embers.
<p>"Didn't see me! cert'ny not! I'm too low and hard-up to see, I am. More fool me, not to show myself up
and make myself seen !"
<p>"What is it you want, William? Here on Tuesday
evening, and now again ? "
<p>"What do I warnt? What do you think I warnt?
Thunderin well you knows I warnt everythink. Gallus
nice father you are to bring me and mother to this ere,
and then chuck it in my teeth. I warnt wittles. I don't
warnt kid gloves and meerschaumes, like some puppies
as I know do, and have no more right, nor yet as much
as I have."
<p>"Then, why don't you work for what you want, sir ?"
<p>"Why don't I work ? Cos I aint got nobody to shove
me forward like some puppies that I know, and who I'm
<pb n="99" id="p.99">
the elder of. That's why I don't work. You wouldn't
begrudge them a shilling to buy a bit of grub with if
they come and asked you. I aint a fool, don't you know?
and, what's more, I aint going-"
<p>What the Skelington was not going to do must be
guessed, for at that very moment a puff of air carried
the tinder up the chimney. Why didn't it blow up
the chimney before? There would have been a little
remaining space to have discussed other sorts of letters
than this of Mr. Gaff's.</div1>
<pb n="100" id="p.100"><div1 type="chapter"><head>XV.
THE LEATHER MARKET.</head>
<p>THE supremacy of leather is, and ever was,
maintained by the working Englishman
almost as strenuously as Magna Charta, "An
Englishman's house is his castle," and "God
save the Queen." He regards it with the
same implicit confidence as he regards his beer, and will
no more accept gutta-percha or india-rubber as a substitute for the former than light French wines or lemonade
for the latter. No matter in what shape the material
appears, it elicits an equal amount of respect; and that
the passion is deeply implanted in the Englishman is
evident from the fact that it is one of the earliest to develop itself in the youthful mind. Long before the boy
is out of pinafores and strap shoes he is anxious for a
whip with a real leather thong, or choice is divided
between that and one of those oozy leathern abominations
known as a " sucker; " and if his first cap be furnished
with a real leather peak, in place of a mean affair of
japanned cardboard, he holds his head all the higher.
True, we have degenerated from the ancient custom of
casing our nether limbs in buckskin, but we still show
an affectionate leaning thereto by miscalling our trouser-stuffs doeskin, and swathing our legs knee high in a
refined and dandified preparation of horse or cow skin.
Even the low-minded costermonger, to whom " wellingtons" are objects of contempt and derision, and who laughs
to scorn galligaskins and knickerbockers, evinces the
national tendency for leather by stipulating for "anklejacks" with "tongues" ample enough to overlap the
<pb n="101" id="p.101">
lacings by at least three inches. There is no surer passport to the best room of an inn than a portmanteau of
the orthodox brown colour, and branded "warranted
leather;" if it should happen to bear the additional
recommendation "solid," your high respectability is at
once established. That it has been from time out of
mind a material high in popular esteem is proved by that
ancient but still choice stave the "leather bottel," wherein the champion of bull-hide, after lauding its superiority
to delf and pewter, and even silver, is loth to throw it
aside after it has well served its turn: after its mouth is
so agape with age that its stopple shakes about loosely-after its sides are caved in and bulged out, and it rocks
tipsily, and finally stands all aslant when an attempt is
made to set it up-after its stout stitches have yielded to
a thousand soakings of sack and canary, and the
venerable leather bottle springs a leak; still, as prays
the stave-writer, don't cast it off, don't put it away from
you as a thing utterly useless, but
<p>"Make it fast to the wall with a pin,
'Twill serve to keep hinges and odd things in."
I have been writing hitherto as though it were only
among the lowbred and the vulgar-among costermongers and waiters, and tavern boosers-that leather is
an article to swear by. We all know different. We all know
that within a little year the commercial world-the merchants, and brokers, and bankers-were panic-stricken;
that, indeed, many of them were clean knocked off their
commercial legs through an earthquake in the leather
market. It was not the fault of leather-such an excuse
was never attempted; neither did the staunch fabric fail
because of a " heavy run " on it. It was simply a case of
leather worked to death-of advantage being taken of
leather-worship by certain folks whose only aim was, like
Jeremy Diddler, to hoodwink the worshippers and fleece
them of their money. After all, however, it was probably
but a righteous judgment. People-even golden-eyed,
mammon-hearted people-were fast sinking into leathern
idiotsy. No business transaction was so sure as a transaction
<pb n="102" id="p.102">
 "with leather in it." A man might dabble in
indigo, in sugar, in tallow, and, though he wore the
wealth of a bank as a life-belt, sink and drown; but let
him but dabble in leather, and he was as buoyant as a
cork. You couldn't sink him if you tried. Did a man
wish to negotiate a bill-a tremendous bill, say a ten-thousand pounder-it was cashed, and at a cheap rate, if
the acceptor were only assured that there was " leather
at the bottom of it." The number of bills about with
leather soles at that period was wonderful, almost as
wonderful-as the sequel proved-as the number of bill-
discounters " sold" through trafficking in leather bills.
Have men of leather yet recovered from the effects of
the earthquake ? Consulting the Times lately, it was
found that hides were "dull," an announcement certainly
calculated to convey to the uninitiated in market slang
that they had not yet recovered from the melancholy
effects of the late crash. The leather-market report of
the same date, however, revealed that "butts" were
brisk and that " shoulders " were rising. To settle the
anomaly a visit to the said market was resolved on.
One would naturally suppose that the place set apart
for public dealings in an article of such national importance would have been as well known as Billingsgate, and
certainly as easy of access. Quite the contrary, however,
is the case. You might beat about Bermondsey from
morning till night, constantly led (by your nose) to
imagine that it is just round the corner, and so imagining
till the appearance in the streets of troops of dirty, lumbering, wooden-clouted tanners, carrying their tea-cans and
wallets, and smoking their short pipes, announces that
the business of the day is over. The better plan is to
make inquiries as soon as you arrive in the neighbourhood. "Up the archway 'side of the warehouses at the
end of the street," you are informed, but, on adopting the
said direction, find the archway so very clean and quiet
that you have your doubts whether you are not trespassing and will presently be asked your business there.
Pursuing your way boldly, however, you presently
come to a great square, and then discover that the huge
<pb n="103" id="p.103">
range of building facing the street, and in which the
archway is, is part of the leather stores. Along the
whole face of the immense warehouses on their inner side
-from floor to basement-loopholes and doorways present themselves; and, peeping in, here and there is seen
such a wealth of tanned skins, in piles from floor to ceiling, in stacks from wall to wall, and in great rolls as tall
as a bull is long, and as many of them as represent
hundreds of thousands of bulls. At first sight one might
safely wager that these sturdy pillars of leather were
"butts;" but that they were or ever could be "brisk"
seemed quite out of the question. Whether a slack day
had been unluckily hit on for the visit, I don't know;
but I must say that, as a British-as the British-leather
market, the place was disappointing. Brisk, indeed!
the head-quarters of the New River Water Company present a more lively appearance. There were the open
warehouses, and there were the merchants, and there,
leaning against the railings that enclosed the soddened,
sad-looking green in the middle of the square, were three
or four listless individuals, who might have been
customers-might, indeed, have been well-known men
of leather, who could by their joint weight send up the
market or bring it down, exactly as it suited them. They
might even have been engaged in one of these operations
at the present time, or they might have been <placeName>Fleet
Street</> betting-men who had baffled the police and at last
succeeded in finding a snug spot where their little game
was not likely to be interrupted. So there they lounged,
and about the warehouse-doors lounged the merchants
-clerical-looking men, with sleek hats and speechless
boots; and that was all there was to be seen. It seemed
to me that the newspaper must be wrong, that "butts"
were miserably dull instead of brisk, and that, if
"shoulders" were rising at all, it could only be by way
of a shrug at the flatness of the leather trade.
<p>Through the leather market into the skin market.
Here was another square, with a broad piazza flanking
every side of it. Business was brisk enough here in all
conscience. The square was chokeful of terrible-looking
<pb n="104" id="p.104">
vehicles-terrible because not only the tires and fellows,
but the very spokes of the wheels, were plastered with a
red-brown substance, in which were matted scraps of
hair and fragments of wool, dreadfully suggestive of
slaughter and the shambles; as were the carters with
their streaked hands, their speckled woollen leggings,
and their oozy wooden shoes; as were the carters' whips,
with the brass about their handles all lacquered red; as
were the horses in the terrible carts-animals of high
mettle and with sleek coats, who snorted and shook their
heads as they sniffed the reek of the wet hides, much
liking it.
<p>Worming in and out among the carts was a swarm of
busy men-buyers and sellers, and blue-smocked porters
-while under the piazza were stacks of hides of Spanish,
and Dutch, and English beasts, each to be distinguished
by the length, or the breadth, or the width of the horns
still attached to a bit of skull and hanging about the
fronts of the stacks as though still vicious and daring you
to approach. Besides these were heaps of innocent-
looking calves' skins, and the skins of sheep and lambs,
still so warm-looking and comfortable that one might
imagine them new sheep-coats just come home, rather
than cast-off garments, of no further use but to the fell-
monger and the tanner. In addition to these there were
several piles of hides that had been exported from foreign
parts, and that had been salted that they might come to
market wholesome.
<p>But I wanted to learn something about the business of
the market, who was responsible for its proper working, and how much work was done there, and I must,
therefore, take especial note of the workers in this
busy square. Prowling about the red hides, like so
many jackals, were several little boys, in ragged blue
smocks, and evidently coming of a butchering stock,
but whose business (and they had a business, for every
one of them carried a knife) at the skin market was not
at all clear. Skipping about the roof of the piazza, and
listening attentively to the price of hides as discussed
below, was a gigantic raven, sleek and well-fed, but with
<pb n="105" id="p.105">
a broken wing. What about the raven ? Nobody could
tell me; nobody had time to discuss this or any other
matter with me. So I came away, very ill-satisfied
indeed !
<p>So ill-satisfied that by ten of the market clock on the
following morning I was once more in the hide market.
Its aspect was marvellously different from that of yesterday. The square was blank and empty, save and except
that some market official, with well-polished galligaskins,
lounged about idly, closely attended by the broken-
winged raven, who hopped sedately as the official walked,
and when the latter paused so did the bird, nodding and
winking, and evidentlyon thebest of terms withits reflected
self in its friend's highly-polished leggings. Under the
piazza was nothing but a few piles of skins uncleared from
yesterday's sale, together with sundry hillocks composed
of sheep's feet, and looking at a distance like some newly-
invented material for paying roads. Something else, too,
there was to be seen this morning under the piazza, and
certainly it was the most inexplicable " something" the
skin market had yet presented. I have before alluded to
certain ragged little boys seen prowling through the
market's crowd or dodging amongst the hide heaps
with a manner that certainly betokened a sort of right to
be there, but to what end was far from clear. Now,
however, it was clear enough. There was the same
ragged little flock, each with an ugly-stained knife in his
hand, floundering knee-deep among the great moist skins,
and turning them about and inside out, ever and anon
darting at any hanging red scrap on the fleshy side and
trimming it off. Nor was their attention solely confined
to these flinders of meat, for some of them might be seen
manfully clutching at one of the defunct beast's great
horns, while with their knives they cut the ears off.
Nobody seemed to interfere with the children, not even
the raven, whose perquisites market scraps of all sorts
might reasonably be supposed to be. So far, indeed, from
resenting the operations of the poor little grubbers as an
infringement of his rights, he magnanimously hopped to
a heap at which two boys were engaged, and, just pecking<pb n="106" id="p.106"> a morsel, passed on with a patronising glance, as
though he rather admired their industry.
In the midst of my perplexity there came sauntering
up to where I stood an old fellow, evidently a porter in
the market. Jerking his thumb in the direction the
leggings and their admirer had taken, he observed-
"Artful card that, Sir."
<p>Not knowing whether the remark was intended to apply
to the owner of the leggings or to the raven, I merely
nodded by way of reply.
<p>"The worstest prig out."
<p>Again I nodded.
<p>"Been about here, ah! Lord knows how long. Found
a top of a shed hardly fledged."
Feeling assured now that he was speaking of the raven,
I inquired to whom it belonged.
<p>"Belonged, eh?" replied the porter. "I'd like to
catch any one belonging to him. He'd soon let 'em know.
Why, bless you, when he was quite a little chap, a boy
about here wanted to belong to him. They had a fight
for it. That's how he got his wing broke."
<p>The conversation started, I took the opportunity to
inquire what it was the little boys were cutting off the
hides, when he shortly replied-
<p>"Meat; they gets leaf from the salesmen."
<p>"Ah ! and what is it good for ? for dogs, I suppose ?"
<p>"It's good for wittles," replied the porter, reproachfully. " They cuts off the little bits as is left on when the
beast is skinned, likewise the ears; you may buy two-penny lots, and you may buy threepenny lots. In the
hot weather you may buy penny lots. The hides it's cut
off of is as fresh as a daisy-killed p'raps yesterday, or
the day afore. I had threepen'orth of ears and bits on
Sunday; and werry good it was."
<p>I made inquiries respecting the heaps of sheep's feet,
and was informed that they were going to the boilers:
that there were only three "trotter-boilers " in London,
and that the most famous of the trio was Jimmy Corderoy,
of Wild's Rents, who it was that supplied every " trotter"
seller in the metropolis. Jimmy Corderoy, according to
<pb n="107" id="p.107">
my informant, employs a considerable staff of women,
who, after the trotters have been scalded, take them in
their laps and peel the hair off, preparatory to the final
cooking process. The wholesale price of " trotters" is
four a penny, but I was pleased to hear of Mr. Corderoy
that he was "a genelman as wasn't particular to a
trotter or so, and would quite as frequent throw in a few
as not."
<p>From trotters I endeavoured to lead my friend to the
subject of skins, and all about them; but he declined to
discuss the matter further than to assure me that " they
went up and down, and down and up, like everything
else," and with that bit of information I was obliged to
leave him.</div1><pb n="108" id="p.108">

THE LONDON HORSE MARKET.</>
<p>WHY "Horse" Market? Or, if so, why not
designate the great depot for butchers' meat
in <placeName>Newgate Street</> the beef market, <placeName>Covent
Garden</> the cabbage or grape market, and the
mart for rags in <placeName>Houndsditch</> the dilapidated
waistcoat market ?
<p>It is a singular fact, but (and despite the title of this
paper) there is no London horse market; that is to say,
there is within the City bounds no space specially sot
apart and chartered for the public buying and selling of
that important adjunct of our commerce--that four-
footed friend of ours that attends us constantly in our
every walk of life, in our business journeys and our
pleasure jauntings, to our weddings and to our burying
-the horse. We have markets for leather, and hay, and
corn, and tallow, and spices, and coals, and fish-places
where the very best and the very worst of the crop of
each kind may be bartered for. Pigs are sold openly,
and bought without fear or suspicion; there is but one
bullock and sheep market for Mr. Giblet of <placeName>Bond Street</>
and Mr. Blolam of <placeName>Whitecross Street</>; but if you would
purchase a horse, the last place to be visited is that provided by the Corporation for its public sale. Not that
the Corporation is at fault. A stigma attaches to the
unwarranted and promiscuous sale of horses that a Lord
Mayor even of <persName>Sir Peter Laurie</> power could not " put
down." Why is this ? Is our morality so lax that it
would assuredly break through under the overwhelming
weight of temptation involved in horsedealing ? Is it
impossible to deal with the genus equus with as simple
<pb n="109" id="p.109">
and single a purpose as with oxen, or is there enveloped
in a horsehide some subtle essence that, brought into
contact with money and an irreligious mind, breeds
disease and roguery as naturally as the blending of
certain gases creates flame ? A man possessed of just
enough intelligence to dress a calf or judge of the weight
of an ox by the breadth of its loins may jog to the market
with a hundred pounds in his pocket and be sure of returning with his money's worth, and a profit to boot; but
what would become of the same individual if, with the
same amount, he ventured to Smithfield on a horsebuying
expedition ? He would be mobbed. The eyes of every
"horsey" man in the market would be either staring
with speechless amazement or winking to each other a
mute agreement to "share him amongst 'em." Just
imagine the precious string of spavined, weak-knee'd,
wall-eyed monstrosities the man with the hundred pounds
would bring home. The fact is incontrovertible. Unless
a man be awfully knowing-unless his vision be so acute
that the machinations of the " chaunters " and the subtle
tricks of the " copers" be to him as transparent as glass
-the Friday afternoon gathering at the New Smithfield
is no place for him to negotiate the purchase of a horse.
Hence the establishment of such places as Aldridge's,
where, if the auctioneer says of a horse "warranted
sound," you may take his word.
<p>Let us, however, take a walk to the so-called horse-market this Friday afternoon, and see what sort of
business is going on. First of all, however, we must
find it; for, thank Goodness! things are not now as in
days of yore, when the way to Smithfield could be discovered from any part of London-ay, even by a blind
man-as easily, though not so pleasantly, as he could
discover a bed of roses in a great garden. The obscure
position of the new market, however, is no very formidable obstruction to its being found. From whatever part
of the metropolis you may start you have only to scan the
road carefully, and if you should see, steering northward,
a horse with its tail plaited with straw and its hoofs
polished to preternatural splendour, or a costermonger's
<pb n="110" id="p.110">
barrow laden with old wheels and axletrees, or a lean
goat harnessed to a fat chaise, or a man with currycombs,
and whips, and whipcord, or one laden with fag-ends and
tags of harness, you have only to follow, and you will
finally arrive at the place of sale.
<p>Business-that is, rattling, roaring business-has not
yet commenced, nor will it till the chiming of the market
clock gives assent. This circumstance is, however, not
to be regretted, as it affords an opportunity of inspecting
the goods and their owners before the press begins.
First, as to the goods. A single glance around is at once
convincing that the proper name for the place is not a
horse, but an ass, market. Here, and here only, throughout London and for five miles round it, is it that the
humble donkey is bought and sold. There are more
donkeys than any other animals present; but this I may
state-on the authority of a middle-aged person with a
bison-skin cap and a capacious shawl wisped round his
throat, and who evidently knew what he was talking
about-is not the case all the year round. "It's like
everything else," observed he, "it flucterates. I'll lay
yer a a'penny that if sich a lot of donkeys wos to show
about May they'd be caught up like mackril, six a shillin'.
What's the reason on it? Why the fruit season's the
reason on it. When you aint got nothing to sell, you
don't want nothing to draw it about." The same
authority further informed me that the difference in the
value of a donkey in the spring and in the autumn was
about twelve shillings-an inconsiderable sum as it at
first seemed to me; but when he explained that, at the
best of times, it must be " a right sort of donkey" that
fetched five-and-thirty shillings, the sacrifice on the part
of the vendor in the autumn was manifest.
<p>There were other tokens beside the numerous donkeys
that the costermongers' "season" had come to an end.
Not many barrows, as a rule-these are merely hired;
but plenty of scales, and measures, and pots (the latter
with false bottoms and other cheating contrivances), and
several big drums, instruments of late years adopted by
the " cutting" cherry and apple costers" as a means of
<pb n="111" id="p.111">
gathering children and calling people to their windows to
inspect their tempting wares.
<p>There were present in the market other specimens of
the donkey tribe beside the genus coster. There was the
donkey used to panniers and respectable Brompton and
Clapham society; there was the donkey late the property
of the small laundress whose husband beat carpets; and
the donkey-two, in fact-the cast-offs of some suburban
assinine dairy. Curiously illustrative of that excellent
maxim, "evil communications corrupt good manners,"
was the contrast the various animals presented. The
donkey that had passed its life in the society of men of
whom my bison-capped friend was the type, carried its
ears aslant, leant negligently on three legs, and was a
blackguard donkey from its impudent tail to the tip of
its ruffianly nose; when the butt-end of the whipstock
was brought down on its back with a noise like the banging of a barrel, it merely winked its eyes contemptuously
and backed deliberately against the whelk man's stall,
its close proximity to which had been the original cause
of the chastisement. How different was the behaviour of
the sleek Clapham ass, with its dainty white saddle-cloth
and decently blacked hoofs! So of the neat laundry
donkey, meeker even than its neighbour the chaise-goat,
and only less bashful and seemingly washed out than the
two unfortunates from the milk purveyors. What became
of these two poor old used-up she-asses I should like to
know. That they were not sold-at least that Friday-I
am sure. Nobody seemed inclined to bid for them, or to
think them worth bidding for. Once a big man, in a
smock frock, sauntered up and punched the weakest one
in the ribs, which act its owner construed to indicate a
desire to purchase. " Wot for ? " replied the big man;
<p>"I want a hanimal to work, I does. I ain't in the weal
line myself."
<p>Not only the animals themselves, but everything pertaining to their housing and harnessing could be bought
in the market, and this as regards horses and goats as
well as donkeys. Did you want an odd wheel, or a
spring, or even a single plate of a spring, you could be
<pb n="112" id="p.112">
served in a twinkling. Did you want simply a screw, or a
screw-wrench, or a couple of linchpins, in a dozen different
parts of the market there were tons of such things laid out
on the stones for sale. This man had brought out to sell
not only his beast and cart, but, piled in the latter, the
whole of the building materials of his stable, together
with the fittings, down to the pail and pitchfork. Here
was a speculative little wheelwright, who had essayed the
building of a van, but, having progressed as far as the
body and the tireless wheels, had been brought altogether
to a standstill for ironwork, and was now evidently and
ruinously anxious to get the abortion off his hands. Here
was a failure in the cats'-meat line-barrow (yellow, with
blue cats' heads on the panels), knife and steel, and
weights and scales, going for a mere song. There were
perambulators by the score, goat-chaises by the dozen,
and as for light pony carts and old-fashioned gigs (those
ancient types of gentility), and light spring trucks, you
could scarcely move for them. The cattle all undressed,
and the harness festooning the various rails and posts,
and the empty vehicles standing thickly about, gave one
an impression of all the blackguardism of the City out
for an excursion, and halting to rest, rather than of a
public place.
<p>The muster of horses, my middle-aged friend informed
me, was about the average. As far as I could judge,
there were about 200 of them, making such a pitiful collection as made one quite melancholy to contemplate.
Certainly there were amongst the number several animals
whose bodily condition was satisfactory, and which to the
uninitiated were all that could be desired. But woe
betide the innocent person who purchased one of them !-
at least if there was any meaning in their nervously-
twitching ears and nostrils, or in the fact that while a
strong hand held their halters a clear space was always
kept in the rear of their heels. These, however, were the
few. The many were the listless and dropping-knee'd sort,
whose dull ears had ceased to take alarm or pleasure at
any sound that greeted them, and who carried in their
eyes a droning, weary-to-death look that exposed the
<pb n="113" id="p.113">
vamping and tinkering to which they had been subjected,
if nothing else did. What a scandalous mockery it
seemed to see them, old enough to be the great-great-grandfathers of horses, with their hoofs daintily blacked
and shining-with their scant manes combed out and
made the most of-with their poor old tails done up
jauntily in a plait of clean straw-and their callous hides
French-polished, as it were, and making by its gloss the
stubborn row of ribs beneath the more apparent It
seemed worse to see the light horses served so than the
big lumbering ones, who all their lives have never been
hurried out of a walk, and who, being used to no better
company than coalheavers and mudcarters, might reasonably be supposed to be dull brutes, incapable of comprehending a trouble too great to be buried in a nosebag.
But the slim horses! what a wide field for speculation
they afforded! Take that long-necked bay, blind as a
bat, and with once sensitive nose now round and blunted
against the grindstone of adversity, what does it think of
as it stands on the market stones and hears the braying,
and bellowing, and clatter, going on about him ?-of the
times when it was a joy to exert its nimble limbs that
never tired-to bound, to leap, to gallop with the mere
weight of a man on its strong back, to cleave the dull
wind till its eyes tingled ?-of the time when its fetlocks
came to grief through failing at that tremendous " five-bar," which doomed it to the shafts ? of its easy carriage
life ? of its dreary experience of omnibus life, during
which it " went" at the knees, and at the eyes, and at
several other points the 'bus driver knew not of,
or he might have been more merciful ? of its discharge
from 'bus duty, and of its plunge into that deepest depth
of equine misery, the shafts of a London night-cab?
Now, however, there is an end even to that. As the
night-cabman says, " his sarvices don't kiver his nose-bag; that he moves pretty well while he is 'ot; but let
him stand on the ranks an 'our or so, and you can no
more stir him than cold lead with a wooden spoon."
What's to come next ? The blind bay, aware of his galls
and sprains and unceasing aches, may be picturing to
<pb n="
114" id="p.114">
himself, and with satisfaction, what a forlorn and wretched
creature he must look, and how extremely unlikely it is
that he will ever again be bought and set to work, the
alternative being that the friendly horse butcher will
presently take him in hand, and then an end to the weary
business. Deluded bay! So excellent is the texture of
your well-bred hide, so subtle the skill of the ruffians
into whose hands you have fallen, that neither spavin nor
gall are visible, and to all appearance you are a lean serviceable old horse, and as such will presently be bought,
kept till the veneer wears of and the cobblers' work is
revealed, again sold, tinkered, and botched, and bought
again, till merciful sudden death puts you past repair.
Now the market clock chimes and the sale begins.
<p>What was just now simply a bustling, chattering mob is
now a perfect babel. The horsey rogue with a patched
quadruped to sell eagerly unties the halter from the rails
and yells at the poor, tame beast, and twitches its mouth,
and otherwise drags and cuffs it about that any latent
spark of pluck remaining to the outraged animal may be
roused and exhibited, the horsey one meanwhile exclaiming, " Who-o-o, blood! who-o-o, then! Gently, gently!"
for the edification of some shy, half-resolved purchaser
whom the horsey one has his eye on, and who is anxious
to secure--as are all seekers of their "first horse"-an
animal of spirit.
<p>Hi! hi ! clear the road, the animals are about to be run
to show their mettle. This is one of the most singular
parts of the entire business. An avenue is formed of
about ten yards wide and a hundred long, flanked on
either side by spectators. Within the avenue are the
running horses and asses, and the men who, clutching
them by the halter, at once guide and haul them along.
But these other men in the running lane-where they
come from or who pays them I know not; but you may
meet them week by week going to the market, and you
find them at the market, with no other goods than a long
thonged whip and a capacious mouth for yelling. Distributing themselves among the cattle being shown, their
business seems to be to give tongue in most Bedlamitish
<pb n="115" id="p.115">
fashion, while they slash with their long whips and administer to every animal that passes them one cut or more
as time permits. The lane being a hundred yards long,
and the floggers certainly not more than ten yards apart,
wooden indeed must the beast be that could not be urged
into a trot. Under such usage my blind bay flung out
behind and tossed his head in most gallant style; and even
the two little dairy donkeys were so far frightened from
their propriety as to allow themselves to be hauled and
flogged along at the rate of at least five miles an hour.</div1>
<pb n="116" id="p.116"><div1 type="chapter"><head>XVII.
WATERCRESSES.</head>
<p>THE very best proof that watercress-selling is a
miserable and unprofitable occupation may be
gathered from the fact that, taken as a body,
they who embark in it are either very old or
very young-individuals whose shoulders are
not yet broad enough, nor their muscles sufficiently developed, for a fair stand-up fight with the world
for bread; and they who have fought through all their
life's prime, and with variable success, but who finally,
finding themselves breathless and spent, and unable any
longer to continue the struggle, shrink aside out of the
press, and, meekly going to the wall, seek a crust quietly
and unobtrusively. You seldom or ever see a hale and
hearty man or woman vending watercresses, or if you do,
inquiry, in nine cases out of ten, would disclose the fact
that the seller had a few hours to spare each day from
some regular occupation, or else that, despite a robust
appearance, some accident or malady rendered them
unable to labour.
<p>Why it is I can't tell; but there can be no doubt that
the watercress is universally regarded as the last link in
the chain of independent trade. While a man maintains
his footing on the watercress rail of the social ladder he
may claim to be considered a worthy man trading for a
living. He may be but an inch removed from lucifer-matches, and such-like goods, hawked as an excuse for
begging; but the said inch is well defined and understood, and to cross it is to launch into an altogether new
phase of existence.
<pb n="117" id="p.117">
<p>There is our watercress-man-a disagreeable, surly-looking old curmudgeon as ever carried a basket. I
know how old he is to a day. He is seventy-eight come
the King's (not the Queen's) birthday, and he has been a
watercress-man three-and-twenty years. I know how he
came to take to watercresses. By trade he is a working
jeweller, but at last his sight got so dim that he was glad
to accept the commonest work-none being the alternative-at which he could not earn more than eighteenpence
a day. Consequently he grew "hard up," and shifted
his good lodgings to poorer, and to poorer still, till he
finally took up his abode in a house where a "crease"
man resided. The "crease " man was doing so well that
he could afford to come down to the old working jeweller's
room of evenings and smoke his pipe, and drink his pint
of ale, and stand little treats for supper; while the
jeweller was obliged to stick to his bench, sawing and
filing, and wasting what was left of his precious sight
through his magnifying-glass and the wretched light of
a tallow candle. At last the well-to-do cress-man's son,
who kept a greengrocer's shop at Lambeth, offered his
parent a home in his house, and then says the cress-man
to the jeweller, " Tell you what, Mr. Wicks, if you like
to go in for it, I'll sell you my basket and business for
ten and sixpence, and take it by instalments;" which
offer was accepted.
<p>Mr. Wicks told me all this himself as he sat by my
kitchen fire, and I must say he made his way there in a
highly creditable manner. We hadn't dealt with him
very long when one evening he was called to the gate,
and what was supposed to be a penny handed to him in
lieu of a pen'orth of cresses. In less than five minutes,
however, there came a violent ringing, and we presently
heard the voice of Mr. Wicks growling like a bear, and
complaining as does a man who has received some deep
injury.
<p>"Ain't it enough," asked he, "to keep a poor feller
on his legs from mornin' till night to earn a bit of bread,
but you must make him come back the length of your
precious long street to get his right money ? "
<pb n="118" id="p.118">
I hurried to the gate at this alarming stage of the
<p>proceedings, prepared, I must own, to find our watercress-man attempting to swindle.
<p>"What 'wrong'money have you received, my good
man ?"
<p>"Why, 'arf-a-crown, instead of a penny," replied he,
indignantly.
<p>That transaction was the foundation of a friendship
between Mr. Wicks and myself that has existed upwards
of a month.
<p>Through him I am possessed of information that would
enable me to start to-morrow morning as accomplished a
watercress-man as any in the trade. I am aware, for instance, that, having made my purchase, it is a good thing
variably find a coffee-stall in the vicinity of a watercress
market), to fortify myself for the sloppy and unenviable
job of sousing my goods at the nearest pump. Then I
shall have to untie my unsold stock of yesterday and mix
them with the fresh ones, unless, indeed, the stale ones
are very " white," when I shall find it more profitable
to throw them away and stand the loss. I am to be particularly careful never to buy my cresses by gas or candle
light if I can help it, for it is at such times that the dishonest dealer palms off his ill-coloured stock. I am
aware that he is not personally responsible for the colour
of his cresses; that they were green enough when picked
down in Sussex six hours ago; but it is the nature of the
watercress, when very tightly packed (and they are as
tightly squeezed into the big baskets as the pickers' arms
can squeeze them), that they will " heat" like new hay,
and emit such a steam when they are released by the
consignee that you would think they were on fire.
Whether they really would "fire " in time I don't know;
but this (instructed by Mr. Wicks) I really do know,
that, under such circumstances, the receivers of the big
hampers have them conveyed at once to the market
pump and there subjected to a drenching that, as Mr.
Wicks says, " sends the colour out on 'em like cheap
print."
<pb n="119" id="p.119">
<p>One thing I am surprised to learn-that it may chance,
after all, in taking to watercresses for a livelihood, I may
still be subjected to an unpleasantness attaching to my
present vocation. " Sir," said Mr. Wicks at our very
first interview, "I'll tell you what is the 'licking'"-
(" undoing," he meant; but he seems to have altogether
forgotten how to talk like a jeweller)-" I'll tell you
what is the licking of me, and has been for the past
three months. It's that there hobnoxious bill."
<p>"Not your son, surely," remarked I.
<p>"No," said he; "I mean the Parliament bill-the
repeal of the paper duty."
<p>I should as soon have expected to find Mr. Wicks affected
bythe Church-rate Bill or the Bankruptcy Bill as the document he mentioned. His explanation, however, set the
matter in a perfectly clear light. He had been for
many years in the habit of serving with cresses, as they
came oat to breakfast and tea, the "hands" employed
at a wholesale and manufacturing stationer's in Bunhill-row, St. Luke's. The usual number of workpeople
employed at this establishment at ordinary times exceeds
five hundred. Since, however, the paper-duty abolition
has been pending, the number has been reduced to
nearly a tenth, the watercress-man's receipts dwindling
in the same ratio.
<p>Among other wrinkles for which I am indebted to Mr.
Wicks is one concerning the peculiarities of the green
and brown cress. "Always buy the latter," urged he.
"They will keep in good selling condition, with a little
care and soaking in clean water, for nearly a week;
whereas the green ones will hardly keep through a night,
though stowed in a wet sack and laid in the cellar.
Besides, if they do keep green, they don't smell very
peasant " (make a note of that, good reader, and smell
your cresses before you buy them), " and the stems go so
soft that it takes twice as many as it should to make a
decent bundle." Moreover, Mr. Wicks, after inquiring
if I knew what "brooklime" was when I saw it,
broke up a bundle of watercresses and showed me several
leaves of the weed in question. The said leaves are
<pb n="120" id="p.120">
rather sharper than the watercress, and have a mottled
appearance. People wouldn't buy the cresses if they
knew there was brooklime with them, Mr. Wicks said;
but that it was so harmless that I might, if so inclined,
"eat a bushel "with impunity; and, moreover, that it
was a capital medicine for jaundice.
<p>Having thus far initiated me as to the sort of cresses to
buy, Mr. Wicks magnanimously offered to show me
where and how to buy them. Having, however, some
time ago perused a detailed account of the ways and
means of the watercress-sellers in " London Labour and
the London Poor" (in which the writer had made known to
the public the most minute particulars, even to the fact
that the pace indulged in by the cressman was exactly two
miles an hour), I was enabled to inform Mr. Wicks that I
knew where the cresses were bought wholesale-in
<placeName>Farringdon Market</>." That's one of the places," replied
he; " but there are two others-one at Hackney and one
at <placename>Waterloo Station</>. You get better served at Hackney
than anywhere, because you buy them fresh out of the
water; and, if you don't mind cutting them yourself,
they ain't particular to a handful. The worst of it is, it
is such a precious long way from St. Luke's, where I
live; and if you ain't there very early-by four o'clock,
say-you may stand shivering about the wet grass till
your toes are numbed."
<p>As far as I could understand from Mr. Wicks, the
cress-beds in question are in the vicinity of <placename>Hackney
Marshes</>, and that any morning scores of decrepid men
and women, and tiny, ragged-headed, shoeless children
may be met, hours before daylight, trudging along,
with their baskets and old teatrays, towards the inhospitable region above mentioned, for the sake of buying "first hand, and saving, perhaps, twopence in the
shilling," or, as it would undoubtedly happen in at least
half the cases, a penny in sixpence--the extent of the
stock money. And there they stand shivering in the bleak
morning air, or saunter up and down by the chilly, cheerless stream, till the cress-cutters, walking knee-deep in
the water, have time to give them their " turn." Something<pb n="121" id="p.121">
 pretty it is to read about " cresses from the brook,"
isn't it? Quite refreshing to know that, though the
cress-seller's gains are small, his labour is light and
delightfully healthsome !
<p>"I've been up at Hackney," said Mr. Wicks, " on an
early February morning, when all the water, except the
running streams in which the cresses grew, was frozen
as hard as iron, and when it was so dark that the cutters
had to have lanterns to see by. It's no use taking a
basket for your stock at them times; you must take a bit
of blanket or sack. Then it ain't much use: by the time
you get your cresses home they are all frozen in one
lump, and you have to lay them in the fender before you
can pull 'em apart and tie 'em in bunches. ' Oh, dear! '
says the people, 'what little bunches! why, it is like
eating money! ' 'Pon my word, it is enough to make a
man cut the business, and go into the work'us."
<p>Mr. Wicks was particularly anxious that I should
accompany him one morning to <placeName>Hackney Marshes</>, and
witness the operation above described, starting at a
quarter-past three (two good hours before daybreak);
but, having a bad cold, I was obliged reluctantly to decline. I, however, compromised the matter by agreeing
to accompany him to <placeName>Farringdon Market</> the next time
he went there. The "next time " came in an alarmingly
short period, and at a ridiculously early hour.
<p>Two mornings after that on which the subject was
broached there came a ringing at my bell, and at the
same moment four o'clock came booming through the
murky air in muffled tones, as though the bell in the
bleak belfry spoke through the folds of a " comforter."
I am afraid I did not feel very well disposed towards Mr.
Wicks at that moment. I had to picture in the most
forcible colours what was the old gentleman's age next
birthday, with his white hair and bare throat and chest,
loitering outside in the dark, chilly morning, before I
could bring myself to a sense of what was his due. In
a few minutes, however, I was with him, and trudging
towards " Farringdon."
<p>It was barely half-past four by the market-clock when
<pb n="122" id="p.122">
we arrived, and still quite dark. Nevertheless, the great
square and round wicker baskets had already made their
appearance in the railway cars, and were unshipped and
ranged in a row outside the market railings, at the
Stonecutter Street entrance. The cress-sellers had not
yet arrived, but the buyers had, and in considerable
force; indeed, shock-headed, slovenly, and apathetic,
they lounged about the posts or squatted in dreary threes
and fours upon the market stones, as though, having
nothing better to do, they had lodged there all night.
Never was seen such a wretched lot of buyers. They
were all so very old and so very young, there were so
much rags and grey hair, and rags and wizened codlin'-faced poverty, and rags and bare mites of shoulder-
blades, and tiny, horridly-dirty crimson feet, that it
seemed that any one capable of taking from them the
few halfpence they might have for watercresses, on any
excuse whatever, was worthy of instant arrest and imprisonment.
<p>Presently, laughing and chatting pleasantly, there
came up the dark street the salesfolk. Evidently they
had come up with their cresses by the midnight train,
but had deferred business till fortified by a comfortable
breakfast. What a contrast between them-they were
chiefly women-and the poor wretches waiting to be
served! It would be hard to find a contrast more extreme: the saleswomen warmly clad, ruddy and bright
from the pure Sussex and Kentish air, and with that easy
deportment that marks the well- to-do individual, on the
one hand; while on the other was life in its ugliest
shape-squalid, hopeless, ailing poverty.
<p>The advent of the market women, however, and the
opening of the big basket-lids, and the lighting of candles
(thrust ruthlessly among the cress-stalks) at once roused
the dormant loungers; and with their baskets and cold
rusty tea-trays under their arms, they picked their way
through the wicker avenue, shrewdly eyeing the various
lots, giving here a dig with the fist to see how loosely or
tightly the cresses are packed, or taking up a spray the
better to judge of the colour. There seemed to be two
<pb n="123" id="p.123">
ways of buying the cresses: by the "hand "-that is,
as much as can be grasped by the forefinger and thumb-and by the "lump." By the former process the sales
produced but little excitement. A penny a hand was the
settled price; and either it happened that the hands of
the saleswomen were much of a size, or, what was much
more to the purpose, they were all equally kind-hearted
and tender in their dealings with the ragged ones. The
only grumbling that occurred was when the question of
" blessing" came to be discussed. The " blessing" is a
few cresses thrown in over and above the measured
quantity, and evidently a "hand" bargain was never
completed without it. I think it would conduce considerably to good understanding between the market-
woman and her customers if the number of stalks of
cress making a fair " blessing" could be adjusted. The
wrangling on this point is incessant. "Is that me
blessin' ? Shure, it will take sivin sich to fetch a penny! "
<p>"Can't afford a bigger blessin' on threepen'orth, Kitty.
Put 'em down if you don't like 'em."
<p>Buying "in lump," however, involves considerable
excitement, and just because the spirit of speculation, or,
more properly, gambling, enters into the business. You
may see half-a-dozen dirty faces clustered near the
candle-lit cress-hamper, which is perhaps two-thirds
empty; or there may be a " remnant" of just enough to
pave one side of the basket.
<p>"How much the lot ?" has already been asked, and
answered, with the invariable addition, "Have 'em or
leave 'em."
<p>The owners of the dirty faces are in a painful state of
perplexity about the matter; they hobble off a short
distance and compare opinions.
<p>"I'm afeard they ain't very solid."
<p>"They're Sussex creases, and the big stalks tells up
well in bundling."
<p>"Let us stay a bit, till it grows lighter, and be sure
about the colour."
<p>You may see these important conferences going on in
half a dozen different parts of the market at one time,
<pb n="124" id="p.124">
accompanied by all the lip-biting and chin-stroking and
winking and other facial contortions peculiar to extensive speculators. Mr. Wicks, however, did not go in for
a "lump" of cresses. He bought ten honest handfuls
with a good blessing for tenpence; and I left him going
cheerfully to the pump to wash them, while I went home
to breakfast.

THE SONG-BIRD MARKET.</>
<p>THE London-bred man, escorting his cousin
from Shropshire through the metropolis, pauses
in the middle of handsome New Oxford Street
or Endell Street, the broad and long, and
observes, as he points out the six inches of
glittering watchchain and the bunch of seals pendent
from his friend's fob, "Ah, John! you wouldn't have
found it so easy to step along here with that dangling
before people's eyes twenty years ago. We are in Saint
Giles's, John; on the very ground where one time o' day
existed nothing but thieves' dens and beggars' haunts,
and where a man with a pound in his purse would no
more dare venture after dark than he would, unattended,
perambulate the depths of an Indian tiger jungle. It's
all over now, however. St. Giles is knocked on the head
and dead and buried, and, instead, we have the broad and
handsome thoroughfares you see before you."
<p>Innocent relative of the Shropshire man! St. Giles is
still alive, dwindled by old age certainly, but still in the
flesh, kicking up his heels and crowing lustily. Alive is
St. Giles as when the wife of Henry I., the good Queen
Maud, pitying the many lepers that were shunned and
hounded through her husband's dominions, caused to be
built, " nigh Bleman's ditch, to the west of London," a
sanctuary for the accommodation and maintenance of
forty of the stricken wretches, dedicating the building to
"the Athenian Saint Giles." Where the parish church
now stands then stood the pesthouse, isolated and all alone,
on forest land, bleak and boggy, as is evident from the
prevalence of ditches and brooks or "bournes"-Old-
<pb n="126" id="p.126">
bourne (the modern Holborn), Woe-bourne, West- bourne,
Tye-bourne, &amp;c., &amp;c.
<p>Whatever obligation we may lie under to saints as a
community, we certainly have small cause to be grateful
particularly to Saint Giles. More than two-thirds of a
thousand years has he sojourned amongst us, and ever
has the parish under his special control been a blot and a
plague-spot on the face of the city. When, in 1413, the
gallows standing at " the elms in Smithfield " was thought
too ugly an object to exist so near the city, it was taken
up and transplanted at the north corner of St. Giles's
Hospital wall, between the termination of the High
Street and what was then Hog Lane, and is now Crown
Street. At that period originated the "St. Giles's Bowl." A
bowl of ale was provided by the master of the Leper Hospital,
and the man about to be hanged halted at the great gate
and quaffed his last refreshment. When the gallows was
removed to Tyburn the presentation of the bowl was not
discontinued; it was upheld as long as the Leper Hospital stood, which was till 1547, and then a neighbouring
innkeeper, that so good a custom might not become
extinct, undertook to have ready the ale-bowl whenever
the hangman's cart might halt at his door. It was on
this gallows of St. Giles of the Lepers Lord Cobham was
hanged.
<p>To St. Giles's parish attaches the melancholy celebrity
of originating the Great Plague of 1665, two Frenchmen
residing at the upper end of Drury Lane first dying of
it. Another plague likewise dates from this ill-favoured
locality--viz., the plague of toll-gates. In 1346 King
Edward III. granted a commission to the master of the
Leper Hospital and to John de Holborne, empowering
them to levy tolls at the rate of a penny in the pound on
their value on all cattle, and the merchandise drawn by
the same, to defray the expense of keeping the roads in
proper repair. It would seem, however, that the revenue
derived from this source was insufficient for the purpose,
for so long as two hundred years afterwards Stow writes
-" High Oldburn, leading from the bars towards St.
Giles's, is very full of pits and sloughs, and perilous
<pb n="127" id="p.127">
and noisome to all that repair and pass that way, as
well on foot as on horseback."
<p>The Seven Dials-the core of the evil apple that has
been so repeatedly pared-remains still intact. It was a
villanous place long before the "Dials" were erected,
and was known as " Cock and Pye Fields," and as the
constant resort of all sorts of blackguardism, from duelling to dog-fighting. At length, however, at the latter
end of the seventeenth century, the land was purchased
for building purposes, and, says Evelyn in his " Diary,"
under the date of the 5th of October, 1694, "I went to
see the buildings near Saint Gyles's, where Seven Dials
make a star from a Doric pillar placed in the middle of
a circular area." Then began the most respectable period
of St. Giles's existence. Monmouth Street was built and
christened after the earl of that name, who resided in
Soho Square. Dudley Court contained the mansion of
the Duchess Dudley, and in Lloyd's Court Lord Wharton
and Lord Lisle took up their abodes. Compton Street
was built and christened after Sir Francis Compton, who
there resided. Sir John Brownlow, Sir Lewis Lewkner,
and other celebrities, likewise occupied houses in streets
branching from the Seven Dials.
<p>How the neighbourhood fell from its high estate, how
it passed so completely into the hands of the Irish, history
sayeth not. The thousands of French Protestants who
on the revocation of the edict of Nantes passed over to
this country, and took up their residence in places where
house-rent was cheap, may perhaps account for such
places as Seven Dials growing less respectable, but it
certainly does not dispose of the Irish question. It is,
of course, an extremely foolish idea; but when one sees
nobody but Irish people, never Scotch, never Welsh, the
sole inhabitants of localities given over to filth and squalor,
one is almost brought to entertain the question-is it
the Irish that make wretchedness and depravity, or is
it wretchedness and depravity that make people Irish ?
Let it be how it may, one thing is certain, the Irish
have got hold of Seven Dials beyond redemption. St.
Giles's and the Irish are identical, and I seriously believe
<pb n="128" id="p.128">
it to be the popular impression that the saint in question
as properly belongs to Ireland as does St. Patrick himself, and at present there is little reason to suppose that
the memory of the one will die out a day before the other.
St. Giles die, indeed! Not he. Assailed as he has been
for seven hundred and fifty years by leprosy, by plague,
by fire, oppressed by the weight of the gallows, and
stripped and routed by the officers of the law, and the
Sanitary Commissioners and the Board of Works, he is
as cheerful as ever. He is like an eel, and has been
treated as one-beheaded, and chopped into little bits,
but every bit is still full of life, and leaping.
<p>There is one particular bit of this loathsome eel-a
very little bit it is-lying between Earl Street and Castle
Street, and known as Neale's Passage (Neale was the individual who set up the Doric pillar that Evelyn saw). It
was broad noon when I paused at the mouth of the
passage, and, attracted by the sound of music and rejoicing, looked down. Midway in the grimy thoroughfare
(which contained about twenty tall houses), and reclining
on a costermonger's barrow, were two Irish pipers-real
Irish pipers, such as never in my life before have I seen
in London-with genuine long-tailed coats, and tall,
jauntily-cocked hats, piping an inspiring tune, while
swarming the road and pathway were a great number
of the female sex, some dancers, some lookers-on. Some
of the females were hideous, yellow-tanged, and smoke-dried hags, wearing nightcaps with full and flapping
borders; some were muscular creatures, brawny-limbed,
and middle-aged, with a manly expression of countenance,
and with their hair first twisted into a wisp about as
smooth, and certainly as thick as a hayband, and then
bundled up and secured by a substantial knot behind;
some very little, old, slovenly-bosomed, draggle-tailed
women of sixteen; while others again, were straight-limbed, comely damsels, with teeth defiant of neglect,
and with rosiness of a strength superior to all opposition.
These latter, for the most part, wore handkerchiefs over
their heads and tied under the chin.
<p>From almost every half-glazed, rag-stuffed window
<pb n="129" id="p.129">
in the face of the tall houses protruded a head, sometimes
two heads, more or less hideous, the lips, as a rule, bearing a filthy little pipe. Equally as a rule were the upper
windows garnished with reeking rags, suspended to dry
on the thrust-forth clothes-prop, or with ropes of onions,
or with shreds of dried cod, or some other such dainty,
the outer wall being the only place beyond the reach
of the picking and stealing digits of little children, hungry
as wolves in mid-winter. Some of the down-looking
heads were haggard and wan, and nightcapped, engendering a suspicion that the unseen bodies were lying abed
helplessly; while other lookers-out, bright-eyed and
eager, and strumming on the window-sills the tune the
pipers are playing, looked as if they would willingly have
joined the merry party below if they had aught else to
cover their shoulders than the scrap of blanket or bed-quilt that now adorns them.
<p>Only two of the dancers-there were ten or a dozen
of them-danced at one time, while the rest squatted on
the thresholds of the wide-open doors, or leaned cross-legged against the walls, or sat on the kerb and regained
their spent breath, while at the same time they cooled
their slipshod feet in the gutter. With the exception
of the pipers there were no men present, which went far
to show that it was neither wake, wedding, nor extraordinary merrymaking, but merely an ordinary afternoon's piping by the ordinary St. Giles's pipers, whose
Christian names were familiar in the mouths of the
dancers, who ordered Barney to play "fashter," and
rebuked " Mike Sullivan, bad luck to yez !" for keeping
incorrect time.
<p>Being within a stone's cast of Monmouth Court, it
occurred to me to go and see how fared the prince of
ballad-mongers, the dying-speech merchant-printer, John
Catnach. Narrow is Monmouth Court-scarcely so wide
as an ordinary chamber doorway-and so low at the
arched entrance that the tall policeman who emerged
as I entered, slackened at the knees involuntarily. It
astonished me but little to find the great publisher in
such dismal quarters-great firms seldom court publicity,
<pb n="130" id="p.130">
and, although it had passed from the hands of the original
founder, that the firm-was still great, was evident from
the existence of a board at the entrance, announcing
"Thomas Fortey, late William Ryle, sole successor to
J. Catnach."
<p>Alas! a cruel surprise awaited me. Instead of the
extensive premises, instead of the creaking of the "crane,"
the tick-tack of the packers for exportation, and the
heads of the ledger-clerks visible above the opaque bottom row of counting-house windows, I found the renowned Catnach printing and publishing establishment
to be as dismal-looking a little den as it is possible to
conceive. Of the decline of the dying-speech business I
was already aware, but to find it as completely all over
with halfpenny ballads one was hardly prepared. So it
is, however; at least judging from the samples of
"stock" exhibited behind the grimy little panes with
which is glazed the shop of the successor of the immortal
Catnach. The singing public has kept pace with the
reading public; and two songs, or two and a half, even
though they be of the most pathetic character, printed on
seven inches by five of dirty white tissue-paper, could
hardly hope to realise a halfpenny while five-and-twenty
square feet of politics and police news can be had, hot
from the press, for a penny. No! The singing public
has burst the chains' that bound it to the flimsy half-penny ballad, and will be pacified with nothing less for a
penny than a "Giant Warbler," or a "Doodah Songster," or a " Concert Companion," sixteen pages at least,
and with a coloured illustration. Not to be behind the
times, these Mr. Fortey provides (there is an entire row
of specimens in his window, together with farthing
"Cock Robins," and "Goody Twoshoes," and penny
"Norwood Gipsies "); but if he has, as he must have,
any considerable number of the shabby little ballads by
him, he will do well to take my advice, and refrain from
disposing of them at a sacrifice on the speculation that
they may one day again come into fashion. Why not ?
<p>When I was a very little boy the current cheap literature
of the day consisted of " Varney, the Vampire," " Claude
<pb n="131" id="p.131">
Duval, the Dashing Highwayman," "The Patch of
Gore," &amp;c. Gradually, however, there grew an army
of wholesome periodicals that did battle with the vampires and the dashing highwaymen, and routed the
miscreants, and ruled in their stead. Vampire literature
came to be regarded as a curiosity belonging to a past
and barbarous age, and, whenever an odd volume of the
kind was discovered in the fourpenny box at a bookstall,
was bought as such, to be laughed at and ridiculed.
Will Claude Duval ever more hold his weekly levees?
Will the people ever again consent to assist at the Vampire's "feast of blood?" Ha! ha! preposterous! Wil
tinder-boxes again come into fashion ? Will folks believe
in witchcraft, or the broth of a boiled mouse ever again
be looked on as an infallible remedy for whooping-cough ?
If the question had been asked me ten years ago I should
have replied, "Certainly not; " but when, in the year
1861, I see Women with Yellow Hair, and Blue Dwarfs,
and Modern Jack Shepherds, vigorously rearing their
ugly heads, I decline altogether to hazard an opinion on
the subject.
<p>From Monmouth Court to Monmouth Street, the
atmosphere of which is thickened and soured perpetually by the exhalations emitted from great stores
of mildewed shoe-leather and ancient clothing, passive
and disturbed by renovating processes. The houses in
Monmouth Street are tall and spacious, but from the
last-mentioned cause the uppermost chambers are
as murky as basement floors in salubrious localities.
Below the hazy attics are two and even three floors,
then the shop, and beneath, so deep that a flight of
fifteen wide-apart steps barely reach from the street
pavement to the bottom, are the cellars-mere black
pits-swarming with inhabitants, not chickens nor rabbits, nor.rats or other sort of vermin, but human beings
-babies and grandmothers, and broad-shouldered men,
and hoary-headed men, and little old women, and
matronly dames.
<p>It should be distinctly understood that when I speak
of these underground dwellings (several feet below the
<pb n="132" id="p.132">
sewers) as cellars I apply to them no other than their
proper and recognised appellation. They have just the
ordinary double flap one sees closing the entrance to the
beer-cellar of a public-house, and when one becomes
vacant, " This cellar to let" will be chalked on the said
flap. It would seem that we are indebted to St. Giles
for this amongst other eyesores, for the books pertaining
to the affairs of his parish bear the earliest record of
cellar-dwellers. "To prevent the great influx of poor
people into this parish," says an entry dated 1637,
" ordered that the beadles do present every fortnight, on
the Sunday, the names of all new comers, under-setters,
and persons that have families in cellars, and other
abuses." For more than two hundred years then has
the doctor scrambled down those cellar-steps to let more
life into the world, and the undertaker has grasped the
muddy rail, shouldered out of the deep hole the coffined
dead to lay it nearer the earth's surface than ever it was
-for any length of time-while in life. As I looked
down at broad afternoon there burned (as I suppose ever
has burned) the flickering yellow-flamed candle, and
there, bent by labour and age to the shape of a beast,
squatted the lank-haired tailor (as I suppose he has ever
squatted), plucking the needle from the seam as though
a life depended on each stitch, whilst his wife was suckling the baby, and sewing the buttons to a pair of
trousers, and toasting a herring for the tailor's tea; while
from the far depths of the cellar's gloom came the
hilarious voices of the tailor's many children; and ever
and again their half-naked forms might be dimly distinguished flitting, goblin-like, round the turn-up bedstead, the many hangings of which waved feebly in the
breeze they created.
<p>Through White Lion Street and into Great St.
Andrew's, where the bird market is, and to see which
was the prime object of my visit to St. Giles's. Such a
babel of bird music! In an atmosphere composed
chiefly of pestiferous exhalations and the choking steams
that rose from the rank pans of the Jew fish-fryers,
there they were, with their cages closely packed on each
<pb n="133" id="p.133">
other-starlings, and blackbirds, and thrushes, and
finches of the " chaff," and the " gold," and the " bull"
kind; and English larks, and foreign canaries, fiercely
yelling out their music, as though they had all gone
stark mad. Perhaps they had. I almost hope so. Bird
music is so intimately associated with hedges, and
orchards, and cornfields-the little feathered songsters
have credit for such elevated sentiments-that to discover, after all, that a lark will sing as well in a fried-fish shop as when sailing in the sun over a clover-
meadow would be unpleasant. No! The birds of St.
Andrew's must be insane, every lark and finch of them.
Birds of song were not the only sort vended in St.
Andrew's-street. There were in big wicker-cages Aylesbury ducks and Spanish hens, and bantams, and suspicious-looking cock birds, sleek and small of breast and
spiky of spur, and geese and pigeons of every size and
shape, and ravens, and parrots. Then there were houses
for song-birds, from the threepenny wire-and-deal edifice
to the magnificent pagoda-cage with mandarin-bell, for
genteel canaries. Bird-food, too: " German paste,"
hampers full of snails, and many-legged meal-worms
animating horribly the measure of bran in which they
were kept.
<p>The bird-merchants dealt likewise in rats and dogs.
"Rats bought and sold " was advertised on boards hung
against the door-posts; and, if you peeped within the
stinking little shops, there you saw scores of rats in iron
cages, clambering over each other, and hurrying ceaselessly round and round, nosing at every interstice, in
hopes to find one wide enough to squeeze their bodies
through; while slim-waisted terriers, with jaws agape
and straining at their tethers, fiercely barked their
earnest desire that the vermin might presently be successful. There were other dogs besides the ratters-dogs
for the "lap," great spotted dogs, stupid and flunkey-looking, for the carriage, and great surly hounds with
pink eyes and hanging lips, faithful watch-dogs, and
with sharp teeth for the calves of the midnight burglar.
Every now and then, rising above the mad bird-music
<pb n="134" id="p.134">
and the jabbering of the starlings, and the clucking of the
cocks and hens, and the melancholy cooing of the pigeons,
came the sharp howl of a dog in pain. I wonder what
ailed him ? Outside one of the shops was the picture of a
terrier with a pair of big shears straddled over him, and the
legend, " Dogs trimmed, eightpence," underneath. Was
the poor howling wretch undergoing the trimming torture ? I hurried from the dreadful place, followed by
the fitful yelps, and almost fancying I could hear the
horrid blades snipping off its poor little ears.</div1>
<pb n="135" id="p.135"><div1 type="chapter"><head>XIX.
A LONDONER'S CHRISTMAS.</>
<p>MY name is Job Blunt. Probably you have
heard of me before; if so, you are aware that
am not a sentimental man, nor an admirer
of veneer, and stucco, and french-polish. They
hide the true grain and breed speculation, and
speculation, to me, is detestable. "Downright" is my
motto, and I am entitled to it, for I ask no more than I
offer. I am as plain as an oaken post, and as rough and
as tough, and I hope I may say as stanch. I'm not
ashamed of the nakedness of my hand, and I would'nt
wear gloves if I was worth a thousand a year. I can find
my way about without the aid of spectacles, and am quite
content to follow my nose. It is a sound, homely, sagacious organ, and though, at present, it has not scented
out the way to Tom Tiddler's ground, it has warned me
of several paths promising enough to look at, but which
turned out "no thoroughfare," being barred at the
further end by a workhouse door.
<p>I never take anything " for granted." If I don't see
the way clear before me, I halt till some one is kind
enough to show me a light. If a man doesn't understand
a thing, he had better say so, and lay his case open to
enlightenment.
<p>Christmas is one of the things which I don't understand
a bit. Don't misunderstand me. Why it should be a
season of Christian rejoicing is as plain to me as to any
other poor mortal with a soul to save; but either I am
a dull, unemotional blockhead, or some people are dreadful
<pb n="136" id="p.136">
 hypocrites in their observance of it. There's that old
Jobbling. I am a poor man, and live in a poor neighbourhood, and Jobbling keeps a porkshop round the
corner. Jobbling had a goose club last year, and passing
his shop early on Christmas Eve, I saw the porkman at
high words with a poor woman, who had only paid up
half her subscription-money, and who begged that she
might have out the four shillings she had paid in bacon,
that being, she declared, her only prospect of meat for
her Christmas dinner. Jobbling would not let her have
it; he referred her to the rules of the club, and fiercely
told her that if she stayed there kicking up a row he
would lock her up. Yet at church-time on Christmas
morning I met Jobbling, looking as sleek, and as meek,
and as sanctimonious as though Peace and Goodwill, in
their search for worthy vessels, had lit on the porkman and
filled him to the brim. Or, as though He whose birthday
was celebrated just a year ago had died yesterday, and
the new Prince, born when midnight had tolled and the
merry bells began to peal, was too young to know anything of Mr. Jobbling's sinful ways of the past and many
a previous year, enabling him to pass as a proper man if
he only stuck well to his mask; that is, if it is a mask,
and I am not a heathen. But, for that matter, I have
observed the same behaviour in a dozen other men besides
Mr. Jobbling. One would think that they held their
lives on lease from year to year, from Christmas to Christmas, and that the only way of gaining a renewal of the
lease was by a display of much humility and contrition,
and shaking of hands, and charitable thoughts of distant
enemies on the twenty-fifth of December. The next day,
the new leaseholder steps into the world of weights and
measures and chops and changes with less of the whites
of his eyes apparent than was the case yesterday, and
with the corners of his mouth at their accustomed angles.
For a whole year the lease is stowed away-forgotten,
buried; and this may be the true reason why the day
following Christmas Day is called Boxing Day.
<p>After all, however, and admitting that Mr. Jobbling's
behaviour on a Christmas morning is that of a humbug,
<pb n="137" id="p.137">
it remains a question whether he or they who made him
so are most to blame. Who are they? Who are
responsible for the wishy-washy sentimental nonsense
that fills the heads of the people at Christmas time?
Why, the story-writers: the literary gentlemen who,
regularly as December sets in, take to saturating every
journal and magazine in the three kingdoms with mystery and superstition, and all manner of unearthliness,
a mere sniff at which, to weak minds, is as potent as
chloroform. I've no objection to the writer of fiction;
indeed, I can enjoy as well as any man a crisp, startling, rattling tale of adventure: but the stories of your
Christmas writers are seldom or ever of this sort. They
are artfully written, as though they were either the personal experiences of the writer, or confided to him by
one who never would have divulged the tragic business
that he had a hand in only for the "mysterious influence " of the season. The writer's aim is, not to amuse
his reader, but to make him shudder-to give him the
creeps; he cleverly insinuates "Who knows?" in the
matters of churchyard warnings and visitations from disembodied spirits; it is his delight to make timid people
afraid of shadows, and to mistrust the comfortable fire
because of the " faces " that haunt it.
<p>So far, I can only say that I believe the Christmas-story
writer to be an impostor. I can't say for certain. There
may be faces in the fire; the frost on the windows may
take more fantastic shapes on Christmas morning than
any other; there may be such things as ghosts. When
I see 'em I'll believe in 'em. Perhaps it is only people
that are more F. than R. who have the privilege of seeing such things, and of writing about them after they
have seen 'em. If so, the Christmas-story writer is not
so blameable a person as if he were more R. than F. I
don't understand it; so will let this part of the subject
drop.
<p>What I do understand is what the Christmas-story
writer has got to say about Christmas parties. In this
matter I have no hesitation in saying that he is either
a very ignorant person or a-well, I want a milder expression<pb n="138" id="p.138">
 that will convey my meaning-a deliberate falsifier. I've seen three-and-twenty married Christmases,
to say nothing of the six-and-twenty single ones passed
down home: and I am bound to say that if the whole
number could be squeezed in a press they would not yield
a quarter as much sentiment, and romance, and pathetic
incident-all due to the "mystic influence " of the season
-as may be found in any one of the fifty domestic Christmas stories to be bought to-day at the publisher's shop.
My name is Job Blunt; and, at the risk of being considered rude, I'm bound to express my opinion that the
Christmas parties met in the Christmas stories are never
met out of 'em; they're all bosh.
<p>I believe I'm entitled to this opinion on all sorts of
grounds. I flatter myself that I am not less wide-awake
than most people, and that if any member of any Christmas circle of which I have made one had been seized with
pathos, or sentiment, or anything of that kind, it would
not have escaped me. For that matter, why should
not I feel the "mystic influence" at Christmas time,
since it's so much about? I'm ready! I'm not like an
affected milksop who would shrink from it. Let it fall
on me, or over me, or whatever it is, and when I feel it
I'll up and say so like a man.
<p>If not on me, why not on my family circle? It's a
circle of the regular Christmas-story sort. Boys and
girls, they count nine; and when they stand in a row the
gradual descent from Thomas, who is a porter at a milinary establishment, to little Jess, the youngest, is very
suggestive of a flight of stairs, which I believe is very
often the case with Christmas-story family circles. My
wife is a plump woman enough, and little, since the
Christmas-story writers like plump little mothers of large
families; and she has merry, brown eyes, which, as is
known, they are likewise partial to. My father is an old
man, with thin white hair, and a bent back, and a crutch
stick (it is one of the oddest sticks you ever saw; made
out of the ironwood paddle of a South Sea Islander's
canoe, and carved from top to bottom with ships and
whales, and pictures of cannibal customs; my father has
<pb n="139" id="p.139">
been a seafaring man); he's a good-tempered old chap;
and the young ones, when they know he is expected, are
as pleased as Punch. He always spends Christmas with
us. Then I've got an uncle a soldier, with a wooden leg,
and a silver plate in his skull, both earned fighting in the
China wars; and a nephew a middy in Green's service;
and another nephew a warder at one of the London
prisons. I could go on with the list a goodish while;
but it isn't worth while, my only object being to show
that the Christmas circle gathered in our parlour is one
in which the "mystic influence," if it exists, might not
unreasonably be expected.
<p>Anyhow, we are jolly enough without it. If a man
asks me to a party, I make up my mind to enjoy myself,
relying that nothing on his part will be wanting to make
me comfortable. I abide by the same rule. My Christmas guests may depend on good meat and good liquor,
and as big a fire as they please. They'll find a piece of
holly in the pudding and a bunch of mistletoe hanging
from the centre of the ceiling. They'll find my son Tom,
who, if they are inclined to singing, can accompany any
of them upon the flute. If they are smokers, they'll
find a good supply of the best birdseye and some straw
pipes. But what they won't find, as I said before, unless
they bring it with them, is the " mystic influence."
"It is there, nevertheless," Mr. Jobbling would probably
say. "You ignorant man, it has not a corporeal existence; you can't catch hold of it; it's as subtle as air;
it is air; your house is full of it; you breathe it and are
full of it, you and all your family. Jolly enough ? of
course you are. It is the mystic influence that makes
you jolly, and free of heart, and hand, and speech; it's
that which gives a delicious flavour to the sirloin and
that indescribable odour to the big plum pudding, and
adds hops to the ale, and sets the fire roaring and crackling. What would the old stories and the old songs be with-
out the mystic influence ? What but it links the members
of your merry-making circle so lovingly, and brightens
dull eyes, and sharpens dull memories, and makes you
speak and act as you only can this once a year ?"
<pb n="140" id="p.140">
<p>Speaking from the Christmas-story-book, this is pretty
much what Jobbling would say. He might add, " Now,
you take particular notice, next Christmas, of your own
feelings towards other folks, and of their behaviour towards yourself; and afterwards tell me whether what I
have said on the subject is right or wrong."
It is done already, Mr. Jobbling. I did take particular
notice on the last Christmas that happened, and have
much pleasure in presenting you with the result.
<p>Besides my father and Uncle Haddock-he of the silver
plate and the wooden leg before mentioned-there were
invited the prison warder and his young woman, and my
nephew in Green's service, and a shopmate of mine from
the docks (I am a cooper, you will please to understand),
and his wife and their daughter Rebecca, who, my wife
will have it (it makes me laugh !), is sweet on our Tom.
Eight, without our own flock, are as many as I can find
table-room for. Bear in mind I have nothing to do with
choosing the guests. With the exception of father and
uncle Haddock, my wife invited every one. Since I
wanted to put the mystic business to the test, I was glad
that it came about so.
<p>If any one imagines that I was prejudiced, he is mistaken. "A fair field and no favour" is my constant
maxim, and I didn't depart from it on this occasion.
Between eleven and twelve I went to bed, quite calm and
easy in mind, and prepared to follow the humour the
morning, the Christmas morning, brought one. But it
happened that I was not to wait till the morning for my
first observation of the mystic-influence question; about
twelve o'clock there struck up some music close at hand.
I don't know what else there was, but I could make out
a cornopean, and a flute, and a concertina. It was the
"waits." Now, everybody knows how beautifully the
Christmas-story writers write about the waits, and their
enchanting music. The musicians were just far enough
away to make their performance pleasant and soothing to
any one pleasantly half-asleep. I could make it out to
be " The Last Rose of Summer " they were playing, and
they played it so nicely that I was quite sorry when they
<pb n="141" id="p.141">
had finished. They struck up again, however, and this
time it was "The Light of other Days." Mrs. Blunt
used to sing this when we were courting, and I was
always pleased to hear it in any shape. I am bound to
say that when I heard the waits playing this familiar old
tune, it set me thinking. At the same time, however, I
am equally bound to state that it always did set me
thinking, more or less. I wondered if she, too, was
listening and thinking. I nudged her.
<p>"Hear the waits, Sarah ?"
<p>"Yes."
<p>"Don't you remember- "
<p>"Hush! How can I listen while you talk?"
This made me open my eyes. She is a rare woman for
sleep, and mortally hates being disturbed; and yet here
she was lying awake, listening to the waits! Did the
magic of the music enthral her as the story-writers insist
it does everybody? Was I enthralled ? If I had thought
about it two minutes longer I believe I should have been,
but Sarah presently cut short my wondering as effectually
as though it had been an egg and she had dropped a brick
on it.
<p>"There!" said she; "that's where he's out "
<p>"Where who's out, Sarah ? "
<p>"That flute-player," replied she; "I've got no patience
with the new-fangled twists they put into tunes in these
days. Our Tom plays six times better than that stupid."
And with that she settled her head on the pillow, and in
a minute after began to breathe in a way that convinced
me she was fast asleep.
<p>Next morning Tom awoke us-at least, he woke his
mother by knocking at the door, and she woke me by
calling out, " What do you want, Tom ? "
<p>"These precious boots," replied Tom; " I can't get 'em
on. I've been trying this half hour. Dash the boots !"
and Tom, whose foot I suppose was half in one of the
boots (bought new on the previous evening), gave such
a violent kick against the skirting of the wall that you
might have heard it next door.
<p>Tom had got up early, as he had promised to be over
<pb n="142" id="p.142">
at Rebecca's place at Rotherhithe to breakfast, and then
they were all to come back to dinner together. It wasn't
more than six o'clock, and pitch dark. To be hammered
up in this way put me out a bit.
<p>"Serve you right," said I; " you should be a little less
dandified, my boy, and buy boots that fit you."
<p>"So they did fit me when I tried 'em on," replied Tom,
saucily; " so they would now, if my stockings were like
another fellow's, and not all darned and seamy as these
are !"
<p>"Darned and seamy! you false-speaking boy, you- "
But there, we won't go further into the matter, Tom's
boots and stockings being perfectly private matters, and
of no sort of interest to any one besides himself. I
shouldn't have mentioned them, only, having resolved
to note my waking sensations, I was compelled. Did the
row occasioned by Tom's seamy stockings scare away the
mystic influence, and had Tom's boots gone on easy,
should I have awoke placid and serene ? Perhaps. But
I'm pledged not to speculations, but to facts; and the
fact is, I did not rise in a meek and charitable spirit, but
rather inclined to give Master Tom a word or two of a
sharp sort, if he hadn't contrived to get his boots on and
set off to Rotherhithe before I got down.
<p>So much for my waking on Christmas morning. There
was nothing particularly noteworthy about the breakfast,
except that the youngsters were allowed strong coffee and
an egg each. After that the youngsters went to Sunday-
school, just as they do on Sundays, and the two girls
helped to clear up and cook, likewise just as they do on
Sundays; the only difference being that there was more
than common occasion to put the place to rights, and
consequently more work to do, which I had a hand in by
touching up the picture frames a bit, and giving the
chimney-glass a polish. I tied up the mistletoe, and,
being not quite sure about its being in the centre, called
up the missus (she has got a wonderfully true eye) to
have a look. I didn't tell her what I wanted her for, and
when she came in at the door and saw, she for an instant
looked a little cross; but then she laughed and said-<pb n="143" id="p.143">
<p>"Lor! the idea of your bringing me up from the
kitchen for such nonsense! What an old stupid you
are!"
<p>She'll find out for the first time when she reads this
that such a thought never entered my head till she put it
there.
<p>"You'll get the goose-fluff all over your black satin
waistcoat if you don't mind," said she, and so I did;
and the rum being on the sideboard, we each had a little
drop.
<p>This was about all that happened out of the general
way till the old gentleman came. Grandfather, white-haired old grandfather, with his pockets crammed with
toys for the youngsters, is almost as great a favourite as
the waits with the Christmas-story writer. The father of
the family in the Christmas story usually gives the old
man a welcome in the passage, or at the gate even, the
children swarming over him, and picking his pockets,
and crushing his hat, and well-nigh strangling him out
of gratitude. I knew that, however powerful the mystic
influence might be, there was small chance of this happening, my father being a man very suspicious of fuss.
Besides, the children had not yet returned from Sunday-school. The missus opened the door for him, both the eldest girls greeting him in the passage.
<p>"Here you are, then, grandfather! Why, how well
you are looking ! "
<p>"Yes, thank God ! and I'm feeling well, except from
my old complaint-you know. I wish you a merry
Christmas, my lass; and you, too, my dears. Where's
Job ?"
<p>" Here he is. When you've done kissing the women,
come up, father."
<p>"How are you, my boy ? How well Sally looks! "
<p>"Oh, yes; she's all right, I believe. How precious
cold your hands are, father ! "
<p>"Cold! Blessed if I don't feel like a mouthful of
frost-bite! Outside that precious Camden Town 'bus,
Job-crawl, crawl! It was as much as I could do to
keep from swearing. Thankee. Well, here's health and
<pb n="144" id="p.144">
prosperity to us all! That's as tidy a drop of rum, Job,
as I've tasted since I left the service."
<p>Then we had a little to say about hot Christmases and
cold Christmases; and then he went back to the subject
of his cold ride on the omnibus, and from that we got to
talking about railways, and of steam-boats, and of steamrams, and of the war in America-just exactly as we
should had it been Easter Monday, or Good Friday, or
the most ordinary Tuesday or Wednesday. It was easy
to see the mystic influence had not got over my father.
<p>"The North can't do it, sir!" said he, bringing his
fist down with a bang, as was his way when he argued
about war. " The South will lick 'em into fits, sir; they
might have done it months ago, but for their lady-like
generosity, and sparing this, that, and the other, instead
of putting it to fire and sword. They should 'mow as
they go,' sir, as they did when I was a fighting-man.
That's the way to put a quick finish to a fight, my lad!
Why, look at that time when our little squadron was
hammer and tongs with the Malayan pirates! ' Mow as
you go !' was our motto there, sir; and "So the fierce old man-o'-war's man went on-about as
peaceful and charitable as a mastiff. He kept it going
till Uncle Haddock, and Joe Haddock, the warder; and
Elizabeth, his young woman; and Mr. and Mrs. Cole,
from Rotherhithe, along with their daughter Rebecca
and my Tom (his feet having settled into the boots, he
was all right now), arrived, and the dinner was ready.
It certainly was a capital dinner-as good a dinner as
I ever sat down to. If the mystic influence had anything
to do with it, I'm sure I am very much obliged to it;
but, at the same time, it is only fair to state that it ought
to have been a good dinner. Tenpence-halfpenny is a
long price to give for ribs of beef; and when a man gives
fourteen shillings for a goose, he can hardly be expected
to be astonished. if it turns out plump, and fat, and tender.
Besides, my missus is a cook-a real cook, you understand. She was getting her sixteen pounds a year and
perquisites when I married her, so I think I may make
bold to say that the mystic influence wouldn't be able to
<pb n="145" id="p.145">
put her up to much in preparing a dinner: It was a nice
dinner; everybody said so. Everybody looked so hearty
and happy that it seemed quite a pity to take the dishes
away.
<p>The Christmas-story writer seldom has anything to say
about the afternoon (it's all nonsense to say that there is
no afternoon between a poor man's Christmas dinner-time
and his tea-time; his regular time being twelve, if he
puts it off till two, it isn't a slight compliment), and I
have nothing to say about it either. The ladies went one
way, the young fellows another, and Uncle Haddock and
father and myself shut the door and had a pipe and a
glass, and fell off one after the other into forty winks
round the fire. Likewise, the Christmas-story writer has
nothing to say about the party at tea, and I don't wonder;
I'm sure I am always glad when it's over. The mystic
influence doesn't seem partial to it either, judging from
the rare occasions of its touching it.
<p>Now comes the crowning time. The small fry are put
to bed (they only get disagreeable and lie about, making
pillows of people's new trousers and silk frocks, if you
are foolish enough to allow them to sit up), the candles
lit, the fire stirred, the chairs set round, and the grog
made. Here we are, then; this is the Christmas circle
exactly as the Christmas-story writer pictures it, with
the exception that a jolly big lump of Wallsend coal does
duty for the Christmas log-which is a smoky, ill-looking
concern, and I believe burnt more frequently in stories
than in fire-grates-and that the grog is not in a bowl,
but in tumblers. What next ? There's Mrs. Cole and
my missus talking in half whispers about the remarkable
manner in which little Charley Cole is cutting his eye-teeth; there is Bill Cole and my nephew, the warder,
talking about picking oakum and caulking; Uncle Haddock is swigging his grog, and explaining to father and
myself how that he daren't drink because of the silver
plate in his skull; while Joe Perkins, Elizabeth, and my
eldest girls are giggling together, and observing my Tom
and Rebecca looking so lackadaisical, and holding hands
as though any one wanted to part 'em. Presently Tom

<pb n="146" id="p.146">
discovers the gigglers, and wants to know if somebody is
going to sing.
<p>Then singing commences. Mrs. Cole sings "The
Dashing White Sergeant," followed by that merry little
old song, " When I lived in my Grandmother's Cot," by
my missus; and then " The Wolf," by Joe Perkins, because Elizabeth asked for it. I don't sing; no more does
Uncle Haddock; but my old father does-good old sea
songs. He sings them-" Harry Hawser," and "The
Death of Nelson," and "Hearts of Oak"-with surprising activity for so old a man; getting on his legs and
describing the position of the enemy and the various incidents and catastrophes with his crutch-stick, and with
such energy that after each song the family circle found
itself a good deal spread out, and had to close up again
before the next song commenced. He offended Tom, and
his mother, too, a little, I think. Tom kindly thought
to assist his grandfather with his music; and when the
old gentleman, with a stamp of his foot, roared out,
<p>"'Twas in Trafalgar's Bay! " Tom began to tootle-tootle
on the flute. The old boy stopped at once. "Drat it,
Tom," said he; "if you don't understand the song, don't
make a mock of it ! It was a battle fought with cannon,
my boy-cannon not with pea-shooters ! Put that farden
squeaker down." It was with the greatest difficulty in
the world that Tom could be prevailed on, after that, to
sing "The Young Man from the Country," though he
had had the song-book containing it as long back as
October; but when at last he did, father was good-natured enough to heal the wound he had caused Tom,
by joining in the chorus to his stupid song.
<p>When we had had enough of singing, somebody asked
somebody else the last new conundrum; but, as everybody knew, it was very soon answered. After a few old
riddles, in the last one of which some reference was made
to a strait-waistcoat, Joe Perkins told us a story about a
fighting man who was confined in the prison infirmary
with delirium tremens, and the dreadful work they had
with him. After that, we ceased for a while to be a
circle, and engaged in pairs and threes-Joe Perkins with
<pb n="147" id="p.147">
Elizabeth, Tom with Rebecca, Mrs. Cole and my missus,
Whispering, laughing, and joking, while Cole and I
talked about the docks, and the old soldier and sailor
about their pensions-all perfectly comfortable and jolly.
Then a game at cards was proposed, and one and all engaged in a round and cheerful game at speculation, which
lasted till supper-time, which ended the party.
As a merry party, as one that gave perfect satisfaction
to all concerned in it, I'll back it against any in the
land; but hang me if I could find anything of " mystic
influence" in it from first to last.</div1>
<pb n="148" id="p.148"><div1 type="chapter"><head>XX.
THE GLEANERS OF THE THAMES BANK.</>
<p>A RAGGED, tailless coat, minus the sleeves,
buttoned over a shirtless back, a wonderful
collection of materials and colours fashioned
somewhat to the shape of trousers, and descending as low as the knees, with a pair of
brown mud hose-said hose renewed at every tide, the
new pair more often than not put on over the old-completes the costume of the mud-lark. A cap or old hat
they have-we never saw a "lark " without one or the
other-but the use of which an awfully towzled shock of
hair renders quite superfluous; the article, in fact, is
invariably used as a handy receptacle for the "lots"
(bones), rags, and any other offal that falls in their way
in their wanderings from the stock-basket or kettle, and
saves the toil of dragging the whole of their findings
with them in the operation of collection.
<p>How the larks came by their appellation is a mystery;
certainly no resemblance can be traced between the habits
of the mud-lark, looking as he does like some extremely
dirty amphibious animal, and the glorious little songster
of the cornfields. No field is ever visited by the lark of
the mud species; the only green thing that ever crosses
his vision is the would-be antiquarian, who sometimes
haunts the scene of his labour to purchase for a trifle the
treasures and curiosities found in his peregrinations.
Old Roman coins (shankless brass buttons-those of old
Trinity men's coats preferred, on account of their size
and the puzzling device on one side), ancient pipe-bowls,
<pb n="149" id="p.149">
&amp;c., &amp;c., form the staple articles of trade; it always
happening that the wary lark has the " luck" to turn up
something curious should a party looking at all like a
buyer be in his vicinity.
<p>We recollect a friend who happened to be walking the
river bank near one of these treasure hunters, just in the
nick of time to see him turn up a rare old Apostles'
spoon, very massive, and still bearing faint traces of the
Goldsmiths' mark. He eagerly secured it at the trifling
sum of three and sixpence, and long cherished it as the
gem of his cabinet, till, having occasion to visit a
Sheffield warehouse, he found the same article could be
bought, bran new, for two and threepence per dozen.
Still these are not genuine "larks," but birds of prey-the hawks of the tribe-and may be detected at once, by
their extremely knowing look and comparatively decent
clothing, from the stolid, almost idiotic expression of
countenance, always to be found in the bond fide mudlark. No matter the weather-blazing July or bleak
December-there they are to be found as sure as the retreating tide, the same old faces, in the same squalid
rags, from seven to seventy, raking their daily bread
from the feculent shore of the Thames from Chelsea to
the Pool. Gaunt, old-fashioned children, stalwart,
brawny men, tottering old women, each may be seen
daily battling with the rising river for a crust.
<p>If there is a period when their position seems bearable,
it is on a scorching August afternoon, when the pavement
is hot to the tardy feet and the mind wanders to shady
lanes and bathing places, when dusty errand-boys lean
lazily over bridge parapets and envy the "larks" as they
wade, leg high, in the cool river, and wish their fathers
had 'prenticed them to watermen. But it is not August
all the year round; and if those same boys should look
down on to the shore a few months later (which they
don't, for if they stand still on the bridge for a moment
to look over, the north wind comes rushing up and cuts
their ears off), in spite of the biting air-in spite of the
masses of ice that are piled up here and there, reminding
him of Esquimaux and Captain Ross-in spite of the
<pb n="150" id="p.150">
frost-bitten craft that look like gigantic twelfth-cake
ornaments-there are his envied friends of the summer,
raking and poking, with never an extra rag to protect
their crimson legs and arms. There they are, and there
they will be, while tides rise and fall, and there is a
pennyworth of anything to be found for the seeking on
the river shore.
<p>Great storms and sudden floods are the mud-larks'
harvest times. When the usually black and sluggish
"Fleet ditch," converted by the accumulated water in its
long journey into a swift and roaring river, bursts its
bounds, it crushes and carries away, in its fierce passage
through the dens that abound in Clerkenwell, the floorings of cellars and underground dwellings, engulphing
the squalid furniture of the wretched dwellers. Should
it happen to be night-time, it is then may be seen the
exciting spectacle of clamorous men and women in boats,
surrounding the mouth of the great sewer, watching for
the appearance of their goods as they emerge from over
the top of the massive iron door that guards the entrance.
Legless tables, broken chairs, fragments of bedsteads,
butchers' blocks, and beams from underground slaughterhouses, the stock-in-trade of coopers and basket makers,
tubs and trays, hampers, cradles, bowls, and baskets-all
crushed and broken, and heaped in pell-mell confusion in
the boiling river. " That's mine." " Murther ! stop that
table, good luck to yer !" " There goes me drawers and
all the childer's things, ochone ! " " Stop thief! " " Arter
you with that there cheer," &amp;c., &amp;c., are the ejaculations
heard on every side as the articles recognised shoot out
into the open water, not always to be picked up by the
legitimate owner. Something more awkward than ordinary will occasionally choke the way entirely, and then
nothing will move till poked and eased with boat-hooks and
long poles; then out they whirl again, and what with the
darkness and confusion of tongues, a great part is lost
altogether and gains the middle of the river, floating
quietly down with the tide, and becoming easy prey to
our friends the larks, as it settles ashore miles from its
starting place.
<pb n="151" id="p.151">
<p>Nor is this the only good this ill wind blows the mudlark; for weeks after such an event he will, when he has
the chance (it is not allowed, and the iron gate has been
put as a preventive), drop from the top of the gate into
the slush below with all the unconcern of a ditch rat, and
there he will wade, feeling his way in the pitchy darkness, groping with his feet, as he proceeds, for anything
that may have sunk to the bottom or still rests in the
tenacious mud, following the course of the ugly sewer as
it winds under the principal thoroughfares of the City.
<p>This sewer is all that remains of the clear, rapid brook
that was once dignified with the appellation of the
River Fleet, running between grassy banks and crossed
by wooden bridges in its pleasant course from Highgate through Islington-through rural Clerkenwell-by
the Clerks'-well and the Clerks'-green, near Field-lane,
by the side of the Fleet-market, which extended the
whole length of what is now known as Farringdon-street,
and thus into the Thames. The many places named after
it-Fleet-street, Fleet-market, Fleet-lane, and the old
Fleet debtors' prison-will give an idea of its ancient
importance. From various causes, its limits gradually
narrowed until it became a mere sluggish ditch, occasionally overflowing its banks, thus being for many years a
great source of disease to the citizens. It is now covered
in from end to end; and it is only on the special occasions
already mentioned that it bursts its bounds and asserts
its claim still to the ancient title of river.
<p>Mud-larks are of two kinds: the coal-finder and the
bone-grubber. The coal-finder comes with his basket
at each tide, and generally finds enough for a load; and
as he can readily dispose of them in the very poor neighbourhoods, at the rate of sevenpence a load, he reduces
his earnings, scanty though they be, to a kind of certainty.
Not so the bone-grubber or "lot-picker," as he is technically known. The river bones, black as ebony, are quite
useless for any other purpose than that of being ground
for manure, and consequently are not worth more than
half the article will fetch when fresh and containing
fatty matter for the soap-maker; so that, although bones
<pb n="152" id="p.152">
are his staple commodity, old rags, bits of iron, old rope,
&amp;c., in fact, anything that the marine store-keeper will
buy, may be found in the "lot-grubber's" basket.
<p>Their most favourite resorts are the neighbourhoods of
shipbreakers, to pick up the old copper nails and bolts;
these are among the most valuable of their findings.
They now and then pick up small treasures-old coins,
ancient relics, &amp;c., especially if it happen to be a very
low tide; but taking the average earnings of the bonegrubber, his business may be said to be the most precarious and wretched of any. Certainly their wants are
few: their clothing costs nothing, and their lodgings are
the dry arches of the bridges or in the foundation of new
buildings. The arches under the Adelphi are a favourite
resort, on account of the advantages offered by the dry
floors of the carts and vans which are to be found there.
Sometimes-but this is a treat-a little straw will be left
in them. The luxury of a bed is as little dreamt of as
combs and brushes or soap, and it is only when he
happens (happily for his health) to " sweep " (steal from)
a barge, a practice he is addicted to when opportunity
serves, that he has the advantage for a time of prison
comforts-a warm bath, clean shirt, clean clothes, and a
clean bed. "He didn't so much mind all the fuss," a
mud-lark lately informed us who had spent the previous
six weeks in the salubrious atmosphere of Coldbath fields,
" only when you come to pull off the warm linsey togs,
and put on your own ragged duds before you come out,
it's wery cold and wretched, wery !"
<p>When the grubber's trade is slack on the banks, he
will venture up the mouth of the open sewers; and this
branch, though more lucrative than any other to an experienced hand, is attended with much difficulty and
sometimes peril, as the following story, current among
the fraternity as having happened to an old grubber
some years ago, will testify.
<p>It was a bleak January afternoon, and the grubber's
searching having been unsatisfactory along the shore, he
groped his way into a sewer that emptied itself between
London-bridge and Blackfriars; now through such low-arched<pb n="153" id="p.153">
 passages that he was obliged to go on his hands
and knees, and now through places so narrow that his
sides brushed the slime from the wall, all in the thick,
murky darkness, and feeling with the toes of his naked
feet the useful from the rubbish that lay at the bottom
under the mud. It was bitter out on the river bank, and the
warmth of the place induced him to stop longer than he
should. Evening came on, and with it so dense a fog as
to deprive him of the little light he had from the few
gratings above, or, should he get near the outlet, from
the light of the fires aboard the coal barges at the wharves.
He lost his way; in vain, in his terror, he tried every
opening he could feel up and down, bruising and tearing
himself. He at last came to a standstill, breathless and
exhausted; and to add to the horror of his position, he
felt the semi-liquid mud moving about his legs, and he
knew the tide was setting in. The place he was in was
not more than four feet high, constraining him to keep in
a stooping position, his hands resting on his knees. To
move one way or another would have been useless, and if
it would have helped him he could not have done it-the
dreadful thought that, for aught he knew, the water
would rise to the very roof, benumbed and paralysed
him. Up rose the tide, slow but certain, till it was above
his knees, and laved his hands; his legs shook under him,
and he would undoubtedly have sunk down had not
another enemy besides the rising river at that moment
assailed him. A sudden squeal and a sharp pain at the
back of his neck told him the rats had found him. A
sudden writhe freed him from his tormentor; but as the
water rose (it was now nigh up to his body) they, finding
him helpless and defenceless, attacked him at all points.
His ragged clothes were but a poor protection, and he
had no way of killing them but rubbing their heads
against the roof as they came squealing and scratching
at his throat, and biting his hands through as he pulled
them from him. But worse than all was their attacks on
his naked legs and feet, compelling him to keep up a kind
of dance, hopping from one leg to the other, and scraping
them off as well as he was able.
<pb n="154" id="p.154">
<p>He could distinctly hear the rumbling of the vehicles
along the roads, and the church clocks strike out the
hours, and had screamed himself hoarse in a vain endeavour to make himself heard. The place now became
awfully close, and the stench dreadful, with the sewer
water within a few inches of his face; he was very weak
from loss of blood, and if his tormentors had ceased
their sharp biting for one moment, down he would have
sunk; as it was, pain kept him up.
<p>At this moment a quarter chime rang from the church;
in an instant he recollected the last hour they had struck,
and he knew that in three minutes the water would subside-three minutes, and there was not more than nine
inches of space between him and drowning. If he had
been a mathematician he could have computed his chance
of escape from the rate at which the water had rose during the last hour; but being only an uneducated " lark,"
he did his best to recollect a prayer or two that was
stowed away in his memory years before, and so beguiled
the long, long three minutes, and the great danger was
over. With the turning tide the rats left him, and if he
had not their biting to keep life in him, he had the strong
hope of escape, which sustained him while the water fell,
and the sewer was reduced to its ordinary low-water
level, and then he sank to a sitting posture. He fainted
clean away; and there he would have remained till the
tide rose again, and he had become an easy prey for the
monstrous rats, had not a friendly " lark," who had seen
him enter and knew that he had not come out again,
groped his way in with a light and dragged him out to
the river side.
<p>He had not been twenty yards from the entrance the
whole time; he was frightfully maimed and bitten, and
was taken to the hospital and cured of his wounds and
his "larking" propensities for ever. He took to the
crossing-sweeping-the mere mention of a drain (that is,
a sewer) bringing his fearful night with the rats rather
too vividly back to his memory.</div1>

THE HALFPENNY BARBER.</>
<p>ONE of the most prominent of my early recollections is of a barber and a barber's shop.
Who he was, or where his premises were situated, I have now not the least idea; I only
know that, at my earnest persuasion, my uncle
Peter (who was a seafaring man) took me with him one
day when he went to be shaved, and that, during the
forty years I have since lived, nothing has made such a
terrible impression on me. I know I must have been
very young at the time, because I have a distinct recollection of uncle Peter lifting me over the puddles, and
purchasing on the route a broad sheet of bachelor's buttons in my behalf.
<p>It was a queer little place, that barber's shop. Round
the walls were fixed seats, and the floor was thickly
strewn with red sand, which blinked and winked strangely
in the ruddy glow of the charcoal in the brazier, over
which was kept hot the shaving-water. In the centre of
the room were two chairs, and about the legs of one of
them, and matted in the red sand, were shreds of human
hair-auburn, and black, and grey.
<p>The shop was untenanted when we entered, but uncle
Peter made himself pretty much at home, and seatedme
on one of the side benches, while he himself took possession of the chair that didn't have the hair about its legs.
Presently, and with startling abruptness, the barber made
his entry by a side-door, of the existence of which I had
not previously the least suspicion. He carried a towel
<pb n="156" id="p.156">
in his hand, which trailed behind; and he wore two long
combs in his hair, which stuck out like horns.
<p>Suddenly going behind my uncle, he flung the towel
round his neck, and secured it at the back. I began to
be alarmed. Arming himself with a stout brush, the
barber next advanced to the pot containing the bubbling
water, turned his back for a moment, faced round again,
and then dashed the brush, all reeking with scalding
water, at my poor uncle's mouth, and among his whiskers,
in the most savage way, till the poor fellow looked as
though he were in a violent fit. I slipped from my seat,
and advanced timidly to the spot where these horrors were
being perpetrated, just in time-Heaven above us !-to
see the horrid barber seize my relative by the nose with
one hand, whilst in the other he flourished a gleaming,
wedge-shaped knife ! He tilted my uncle's chin till his
head fell back, and the peculiar little lump in his throat
shone again!
<p>Not a moment was to be lost. I flung myself on my
knees, and offered the assassin the entire contents of the
little pocket in my frock-twopence farthing, and four
pieces of pencil-to spare my uncle's life. He laughed
mockingly. I turned to my relative, and entreated him
to exert himself-to burst his linen bonds and fly !
<p>Nay, I volunteered, despite the dreadful wedge-shaped
knife, to cling to the barber's legs, and hold him, so as
to prevent pursuit. Finally, the barber yielded to my
entreaty, and released uncle Peter, who wiped his mouth,
and came out of the shop unshaven, as he had gone in.
Oh, the rapture of finding ourselves safe in the open air
again ! How I congratulated my uncle on his miraculous escape, and comforted him with my few remaining
bachelor's buttons !
<p>I have laughed over this myself many and many a
time, but it was some years before I could overcome my
deeply-rooted horror of a razor. It was with feelings
quite unnatural to a young man that I first noted the
appearance of down upon my face.
<p>Twice a week, after I had made the alarming discovery, did I stealthily abstract the scissors from my sister's
<pb n="157" id="p.157">
work-box, and, in the secrecy of my chamber, shear my
tender countenance, till my strong young beard, arriving
at maturity, rebelled against such feminine treatment,
and insisted on being mown, and not snipped. Then, to
stave off as long as possible the horrid wedge-backed
thing that was hanging always before my eyes, I purchased pumice-stone, and "flatted" my visage till it
looked as though it had been recently scalded. I bought
new penknives, for the sake of their first edge, till one
day my mother was surprised to find seventeen of those
instruments stowed away in my hat-box. In fact, it was
not till I had committed matrimony that I was shamed
out of my dislike for a razor. By-the-bye, I fancy that,
had my newly-made wife heard the key stealthily turn
in the lock, and had then, by applying her eye to the
keyhole, obtained a fair view of me, pale-faced and haggard-my hand nervously gripping the razor-handle-
it's very likely she would have been tempted to knock at
the door.
<p>At the happy period above alluded to I was also cured
of my prejudice against barbers-not that I had, through
my early life, avoided them as I had the principal tool
of their craft. I don't know how it was, unless I was
guided by the same infatuation that leads people to skate
on wafer-ice, and to crawl to the edge of dangerous
chasms for the morbid pleasure of imagining what a
pretty kettle of fish it would be if the brink were to give
way and precipitate them to the bottom; but so it was.
As a boy-nay, as a grown-up youth-I could never
pass a barber's shop without feeling an itching to peep
in. At that time o' day barbers used to extract teeth.
There was a celebrated barber-dentist in Wormwood
Street, Bishopsgate Street; and many a time, on Wednesday half-holidays, have I strolled to that neighbourhood and gazed on the decayed relics-molar and incisor - till the nerves of my own grinders have vibrated
again.
<p>My curiosity concerning barbers' shops, and things
thereunto appertaining, has led to my discovering some
rather curious facts connected with those individuals who
<pb n="158" id="p.158">
exist by scraping a living from the faces of their fellow-creatures. I've talked with the man whose father it was
who opened the first "three-halfpenny" shop in Lambeth
Butts. I have had an opportunity of reading the handbill
that was issued on that important occasion, and which,
I've no doubt, created a considerable panic amongst
the shavers of the period. The following is a copy
of it:-
<p>"Shaving! Shaving!! Shaving!!! Timothy Weevil
begs to announce that, on Sunday, the seventeenth inst.,
he will, at his hair-dressing and shaving establishment,
Lambeth Butts, reduce his price for shaving from two-pence to three-halfpence, and for hair-cutting from four-pence to threepence. J. W. warrants to do his work with
his usual skill at the reduced prices, and hopes he shall
be none the poorer for the reduction."
<p>T. W., junior, confidently informed me that his father
was no poorer through the adoption of his liberal measure,
but that business increased to such an extent that it was
one man's work to strop razors. But, alas! such piping
times were not to last. Mr. Weevil had set the ball
rolling, and in a short time another shaver pitched his
tent in the Butts, shaving chins at three-halfpence each,
and trusting to the public that he "mightn't be any
poorer for the reduction."
<p>But Timothy was an enterprising man, and not to be
daunted by a little competition; so he caused to be printed,
and at the end of his pole published, an announcement,
that "On and after Sunday morning next, every customer of his should be presented with a glass of gin or
rum."
<p>That was a hit. Every drunkard in the neighbourhood, whom Sunday morning had hitherto found in the
aggravating position of having money to buy gin, and no
gin to be bought till after church-time, flocked to Weevil's.
But the glass was very small, and the barber staunch to
his resolution that for customers only should it be filled.
Many, therefore, were the schemes to procure a double,
or even a treble, dose. Never were men so whimsical as
those drunken customers of Weevil's. They would just
<pb n="159" id="p.159">
have it off the upper lip-never mind the lower-they
thought about cultivating a 'perial. Customer gets his
glass, pays his three-halfpence, and sits down a few
minutes.
<p>"Hi, mister! I likes a clean chin, arter all. Let's
have another scrape."
<p>Another glass, another three-halfpence, and another
pause,
<p>"Well, I d'know! S'pose you just tittywates my
whiskers a bit! "
<p>And so on; leaving little doubt that the public-houses
had only to keep closed all day long for Mr. Weevil
to make his fortune, and his customers to go bald as
pumpkins.
<p>Weevil, junior, reveals to me these little episodes in
his father's life as we sit together in the little parlour
behind his shop at Wapping Wall. The reason I am
there, and the reason the poor fellow is so obligingly communicative, is that, that same morning, I had had the
good fortune to pass his premises just as a broker's man
was unscrewing the tricoloured arm from his door-post.
I had the pleasure of standing over him while he screwed
it on again.
<p>My eyes, wandering from the table whereon still lay
the discharged "distraint for rent," encountered the words
"Shaving One Halfpenny," painted in big red letters, the
full length of his shop-window. I thought I had discovered a solution to the whole business. Here was a
man who had ruined himself through working at a
rate that could not possibly be remunerative. I told
him so.
<p>" Lord bless you, sir," replied he, " shaving for a half-penny ain't the cause of my misfortune-the halfpenny
pays well enough. Why, I know a man who gave three
hundred pounds for a halfpenny business, in Whitecross
Street, St. Luke's, and who don't repent of his bargain
either. It ain't the price, nor it ain't the lack of business
-it's the sort of customers that ruins me."
<p>I was at a loss to know what difference this would make.
Was not one chin as good to operate on as another ?
160
<p>" Certainly not," replied he. " You see, sir, this neighbourhood is just made up of coalheavers and whippers,
and they are the very worst kind of men to shave. In
the first place, taking the throat and the big chin, you
have got about three times the ground to go over to what
you have on an ordinary face; and, in the second, the
grit and coal-dust they carry in their beards never fails
to take the edge clean off a razor at one using. I'
'most as soon go and shave a man sick a-bed as a coal-whipper."
<p>I remarked that shaving a sick man in his bed must be
a very distasteful job-one of the worst that ever fell in
his way.
<p>"With the exception of shaving a dead man ! " said he,
shaking his head gravely. "Ah! nobody knows what
that is but those who have tried it. The beard seems to
have gone dead, too-it loses its crispness, and goes as
soft and as tough as whipcord. It falls before the edge
of the razor, and you glide over it without cutting a hair.
The coldness is the worst, though-it ain't the coldness
of ice, nor of anything but what it is. To find that creeping into your fingers and up your arms !-ugh "
The barber took a turn or two across the little parlour,
whistling. After half an hour's further conversation with
him (in the course of which he munificently offered to cut
and curl me gratis, to the end of my days), I took my
leave of the face-reaper, understanding that he intended
to shift his quarters to a less stony soil.
<p>I was determined to see for myself if it were possible
for a man to make his fortune by shaving his fellow-men
at a halfpenny each; so, having carefully treasured the
address of him whom my friend of Wapping Wall asserted
to be the most flourishing barber in London, I set out on
Saturday evening-as likely to be the busiest time in the
week-and about six o'clock found myself in a dismal
little street in Walworth, and ascending the well-worn
steps of "Flight's Halfpenny Shaving-shop."
<p>As soon as I put my head inside the door (which was
kept on the swing by a strap), I had misgivings as to the
truth of the information derived from Wapping Wall. It
<pb n="161" id="p.161">
was such a little place! Evidently it had, at one time,
been an ordinary front-parlour. The sitting accommodation consisted of three forms, four chairs, and the three
bottom stairs of a flight that led to an upper apartment:
certainly not more than twenty persons could possibly
have found seats.
<p>The secret, however, was that they were always occupied. I sat there for at least an hour (under pretence of
waiting for a party), and I can safely say that no one seat
was ever empty for the space of half a minute.
<p>Mr. Flight's establishment consisted of himself, two
young men, and an apprentice-boy. Only one of the two
young men, however, was available for shaving purposes;
the other one undertook the hair-cutting, and passed from
poll to poll with amazing rapidity. About the centre of
the room were placed five chairs, all in a row; and the
labour of shaving was divided amongst Mr. Flight and
his three helpers in the following very methodical
manner.
<p>As soon as one of the five chairs became vacant, and a
fresh customer sat down, the young man, leaving for an
instant his occupation of stropping, rushed forward,
pinned a cloth round the neck of the unshaven one, and
immediately returned to his corner. Then the "soapboy" (who has just finished lathering the last man) takes  him in hand.
<p>Armed with a dirty soap-bowl and a big brush, he
crosses over to the hob, and plunges the brush into an
indescribable brew that simmers there in a saucepan.
Then, having dabbed it (the brush) two or three times on
the soap, he commences scrubbing away with it at the
man's face, much as though it had been dirty wainscot,
and he was under orders to renovate the paint. Backwards and forwards, and round and round, darting fiercely
at his victim's nostrils, twirling amongst his whiskers,
changing the brush deftly from the right hand to the left,
working about the man's lips and chin with his fingers,
and finishing off by scooping the unnecessary suds from
between the man's lips with his thumb-nail-it was certainly a nasty and a most barbarous exhibition.
<pb n="162" id="p.162">
<p>It seemed to be the boy's special business to keep the
individual whom Mr. Flight intended to operate on next
"moist" till he was wanted; and, being a sharp boy, he
generally managed to keep at least two in reserve-so
that Mr. Flight always found a customer ready napkined
and lathered to his hand. In nine strokes Mr. Flight
finished him. During the time I sat there, I counted at
the rate of thirteen shaven faces pass out every ten
minutes !</div1>
<pb n="163" id="p.163"><div1 type="chapter"><head>XXII.
THE HOUNDSDITCH JEWELLERY MARKET.</>
<p>I HAVE reason considerably to modify the
opinion I lately expressed concerning the
Houndsditch Sunday Fair. A week or two
ago, having, as I imagined, explored it
thoroughly - having perambulated Moses
Square, where the rags and tatters, and secondhand hats
and bonnets, and shoes and stockings, were bartered
andhaggled; and Cutler Streetand Petticoat Lane, famous
for workmen's tools, musical instruments, and military
and marine stores; and Phil's Buildings, where swarm
and chaffer among themselves the real " Ole Clo " men
and women; and the "Exchange," where, collected
from Heaven knows what sources, are constantly exposed
for sale silk gowns, satin gowns, costly laces, and shawls
of Persia and India, tarnished certainly, but still with a
thoroughbred air about them that begot much sympathy
for their unfortunate condition-when I had discovered
all these things, my impression was that I knew all
about the business; and this is what I thought of it:-
That it was, as a business, nasty, and mean, and miserable;
that they who embarked in it were to a man or woman
Jews; and that its character gave the flattest contradiction to the proverbial cunning of the Jew, likewise to
the vaunted value of his organs of vision when directed
mammonward; that the Hebrew was, after all, but a low-
flying and lumbering, albeit an industrious and copiously
perspiring, bird, and content with such fatness as carrion
afforded; satisfied to burrow in muck and grow smugly
sleek on such scraps and offal as the world and his wife
<pb n="164" id="p.164">
overlooked, or, knowing the existence of, despised; with
no lofty aspiration for the rich stream yielded by fair
commerce and enterprise, but meekly eager to churn a
livelihood from the City's scum.
<p>Such, however, is no longer my estimate of the Houndsditch Jew, and, as for his market-place, I may say that,
having explored and scrutinised it foot by foot, you know
of its mysteries very little more than the mariner knows
of the mysteries of the sea. Like the said mariner, you
may observe the turbulent surface and see all round
about you fish pursuing and pursued, with here and
there a curiously-snouted monster, whose business,
beyond the certainty that it is predatory, cannot be made
out. The mariner, unless he be likewise a diver by profession, or becomes, unluckily, one of a wrecked crew,
will never know even for a moment what the sea is like
at heart. So as to the depths of Houndsditch; unless a
man be, as am I, a professional diver, or, just a simple
merchantman bound on an eastward land voyage, he be
treacherously directed from his proper course by an
Israelitish pilot, and finally stranded a sheer hulk on a
Whitechapel shore.
<p>Such, I am bound to confess, might I have been for all
my diving experience, or, at the least, have dived and
found nothing, had I not been carefully directed and instructed by an old cruiser in the intricate Houndsditch waters who now enjoys a pension as a retired police
inspector. It was he who set right my presumptuous
assertion that I knew all about Rag Fair. He inquired,
among other things, "What did you think of the jewellery
rooms? Did you look in at Barnet's? Did you have
any difficulty in getting admittance at Mendez's ? Were
you not astonished at the tremendous display of gems
and precious metals at Moses Levy's ? "
<p>Now, as the reader has been made aware, I had seen
vast quantities of jewel-shaped ware, and, to the extent
of several tons, of studs and pins, and bangles and
bracelets; but the metals of which they were composed
were palpably no more precious than brass or copper.
As to the ownership of the goods, that might have been
claimed by a Levy, or a Mendez, or a Moses, but for
<pb n="165" id="p.165">
certain I could not say. As to the " difficulty of gaining
admission," I had not experienced it; on the contrary,
Levy, and Mendez, and Moses had each in turn laid
violent hands on me with a view of compelling me to
inspect the valuables displayed on their boards and
benches. All this I explained to my friend, but with
no other effect than to convince him that the important
feature of the Sunday fair alluded to by him had altogether escaped me. Recent as were my experiences of the
inodorous rabble that swarmed at the said fair, I should
have been content to have allowed my work to have remained incomplete as it was; but my friend assured me
that the real jewellery exchanges were highly-respectable
places where nobody but rich men-workers in gold,
dealers in silver plate, and diamond-merchants-congregated, or, indeed, had business; and he, moreover, drew
such graphic and curious pictures of these " back-slum"
golcondas that I was fain to take a list of them and promise to go and see.
<p>The list comprised five jewellery marts, all to be
found within easy stone's-throw, supposing the speaker
to stand in Houndsditch between Bevis Marks and Cutler
Street. Two of the five are on the Cutler Street side of
the main thoroughfare, and the remaining three so close
to the Duke Street orange market that the pungent scent
of the refreshing fruit comes in at the open sashes of the
crowded show-rooms in a way to be grateful for. Of the
Cutler Street emporiums I will say nothing; certainly
they were tolerably rich, and it was somewhat astonishing and suggestive of the forty thieves and " Open
Sesame " to find one tapping "three distinct times " at
the battered door of a mangy-looking public-house, so
very mangy and beetle-browed, with its heavy, overhanging portal and blinking little windows, backed by
dingy red curtains-and to find the door gently opened
by a ringletted houri, with her bosom in glittering chains,
and her ears fettered with masses of gold and cornelian-to find yourself gliding stealthily in with a softness that
any one of the celebrated forty might envy, and boldly,
and with the aid of a lodger of long standing, crossing the
space before the bar, and pushing open a door on which
<pb n="166" id="p.166">
was simply inscribed "Parlour,"-to find yourself crossing the threshold, and the door heavily, though softly,
plugging to, and shutting you in-in among a company
beady-eyed and hawk-nosed, some with little black
beards, some with grey beards resting on their shirt
fronts, and all of them chattering like London sparrows
-doing, too, as well as talking. On the common-looking
tables were common iron teatrays inches deep of silver
watches and watch-cases, and naked works that looked
as though the cruel Jews had flayed them. Over these
trays the beady-eyed ones stooped, and plucked, and
poked, and picked, fiercely demanding the price as with
a foreknowledge that it would be preposterous, and to
discuss it a simple waste of time. At least, you might
be led to ascribe such fierceness of bargaining to this
cause, were you unaware of the fact that Jews among
themselves never haggle; they see what comes of it in
their transactions with Christians, and carefully eschew
"the silly custom." "Ow butch?" asks Mr. Levy,
taking up a watch. "Two powd; " and, though he may
receive the information with a wriggle as though he had
been pricked, if he wants the watch, he merely retires
from the way for a moment to screw up his courage, and
comes back with the " two powd" in his hand, which is
tolerably good evidence that "'bating" is never entertained even to the extent of a penny.
<p>The second Cutler Street jewellery mart was as much
like the first as peas in one pod, and, had I seen none
other, would have seemed marvellous. But I had yet to
see that which put them both in the shade, reducing them
to mere pedlar's packs, whereas before they appeared
goodly acres of the estate of that Croesus, Thomas Tiddler.
Number one of the Orange Market gold and silver stores
was fair enough; there were a few hundred more chains
and watches and bracelets than occurred at the other side
of Houndsditch, to saynothing of a sprinkling of diamonds,
and a measure or so of rubies and emeralds. Number
two Orange Market (a shut-up public-house, as was number one) was even more wealthy than the other; but
number three!
<p>Number three is situated to the right of the <placeName>Orange Market</>
<pb n="167" id="p.167">
 coming from St. Mary Axe. My head is so
crammed with Jewish names that I am by no means sure
how the proprietor of number three was called. There,
however, was his name painted over the doorway. of his
tavern, and, to the best of my knowledge, it was the
same as that of one of the rare old masters in the art of
painting. It was about eleven o'clock on the Sunday
morning, and the church bells were summoning good
folks, and good folks were responding to the summons
and wending, their way churchward. As to the jewellery
mart I was about to enter, it, too, might have been a
place of worship, a meeting-house for the Some-of-these-days saints, or at the very least a vestry-room. The
tavern itself was, of course, fast closed, but at the side
there was a spacious private entrance, the step to the
door of which was demurely whitened, while the door
itself was so closely ajar that at first sight it seemed
shut, and all as quiet and as moral as could be. When
you pushed the door, however, it swung easily open, and
within you found the hall nicely matted and covered with
oilcloth, and at the end, or what seemed to be the end, of
the passage was a highly respectable-looking door covered
with dark baize. This you likewise pushed open, and
found a little bit more passage, with an ordinary sitting-room door in one of the walls of it: of this you turned
the handle, and there you were.
<p>Fancy an apartment as long as Fleet Street is broad,
and wide in fair proportion, with a line of tables about
four feet wide on either side down the whole length of it,
with two large windows at one end of it, and at the other
end a snug country posting-house liquor-bar. In the
roof at the liquor-bar end of the room a broad skylight.
Behind the tables and seated on forms, a close row of Jews
of every country and complexion, some dark almost as
Arabs, others freckled and sickly fair; some so old and
shaky that they sat muffled up in cloaks and comforters;
others so young and un-Jewish that it seemed a mere
temptation to rogues to seat them there as dealers. On
the broad tables, on every one of them, and so that they
were completely covered, were vessels of gold and of silver,
cups and vases, and jugs and goblets, gold chains in great
<pb n="168" id="p.168">
coils; while silver chains in heaps, being of small account, kept in the rear along with silver spoons and other
articles in the same inferior metal; bracelets flickering
with rare topazes, lockets glaring with ruddy opals,
crosses and clasps and necklaces rich with great pearls,
and looking chaste as snow; coronets brilliant with clustering emeralds, and earrings ablaze with diamonds.
Besides these there were gems unset, piled in the corners
of the trays like cherrystones, or stowed in common pillboxes. As to watches of gold and of silver, I am quite
certain that had they all been placed in a sack, the
strongest porter from the Orange Market outside would
have been unable to carry it, even though its contents
were the reward of his labour.
<p>The body of the room-capable of holding at least two
hundred people-was chokeful. You could not move
without endangering your own toes or somebody else's,
nor turn your head without the certainty of encountering a great blast of tobacco smoke from somebody's
lips, for-and this seemed to me the most curious part of
the business-the company, although orderly, was not
the most genteel one would wish to meet, and there were
seedy-looking and even shabby-looking men amongst it,
who smoked cigars almost to a man, so that the place was
downright hazy with smoke, and it was a difficult matter
to see from one end to the other. And yet there was the
mixed company handling the contents of the trays as
freely as blackberries, and passing diamonds and pearls
to each other, and struggling with costly rings and necklaces through the press that they might examine them at
a better light than that afforded near the vendor's stall;
and the vendors all the while placid and serene, and
evidently in no fear of being robbed. As for the proprietor of the tavern, he lounged over his bar, and chatted
to his customers, and served them with brandy and other
fiery liquors (the church bells were still ringing); and
everybody, even to the seedy man who stood near the
door with some sort of pickled vegetable in a tub, and
with a row of white saucers inwhich to serve out pen'orths,
seemed so contented, and warm, and comfortable, that the
sight was quite affecting. </div1>

WITH A SET OF TEASPOONS.</>
<p>FAR be it from me to give utterance to a single
word that may be construed into a justifica-
tion of drunkenness. To my eyes no sight is
more deplorable than that of a gin-wrecked
man or woman,-a hideous, blear-eyed wretch,
soaked and sodden, the breath of whose body is a pestilence, and the clammy touch of whose palsied hand is
a thing to loathe; who cumbers the face of the earth as
an unweighted human carcass is sometimes seen cumbering the face of the living ocean-an ugly, shameful
drift, tattered and penniless, too vile for shark's food,
though the fish be of the rapacious bottle-nosed species,
whose lurking-place is behind a pewter-covered bar, and
whose maw, as a rule, is not set against offal. If there is
anything more deplorable, it is the fact that these human
beacons, visibly consuming in the liquid fire that fills
and torments them, are inefficient to warn off the reckless voyager, who, out of selfishness or despair, or, as
has happened many a thousand times, simple, goodnatured weakness and a yearning for jolly-good-fellowship, launches on that enchanted sea beneath whose
surface, so gay and sparkling, lurks blackness, and death,
and such horrible shapes as are never seen but by men
whose heads are shaven and whose arms are confined in
strait-jackets, lest, in their terrible fright, they should
lay murderous hands on themselves to escape therefrom.
The honest man who is at the pains to set up buoys and
landmarks for the salvation of these reckless ones-nay,
who devotes his life to the business of piloting such
<pb n="170" id="p.170">

endangered craft into safe haven, and that without hope
or expectation of "salvage," deserves the gratitude of
his fellow-men as a hero of high degree, for such he is.
Happily, there are many such amongst us; and well
would it be for them, as for us all, if their army were
strong enough to occupy the field to the exclusion of
mistaken meddlers and priggish pretenders, who mistake
water on the brain for the irresistible pressure of a
"mission," impelling them to run a muck against all
vats and beer barrels. Burning with teapot valour, these
doughty ones open shop in all quarters of the town, not
so much for the purpose of plucking brands from the
burning, as of rendering sticks uninflammable by an
abundant saturation in a variety of slops spouted from
a platform in the shape of speechifying, or purveyed in
cups and mugs, to grown sticks, male and female, and
to mere twigs of twelve and fourteen, at a price that
leaves a decent profit for the purchase of glorification
medals.
<p>Pewkers' Hall, in our neighbourhood, is one of these
anti-tippling camps. Its founder and secretary, manager
and treasurer, is the Rev. Dapple Mookow, a minister of
the Alack-a-day Saints persuasion, and the proprietor
of the patent movable corrugated-zinc chapel, a little
way down the road. Pewkers' Hall is not a building of
imposing appearance; indeed, it does not appear at all
until you have penetrated an alley diverging from the
high street, and which is overhung by a notice-board,
inscribed "Pewkers' Hall at the bottom! " Its style of
architecture is of the Rebuke-to-Vanity order, and, exteriorly, the hall is not unlike a watchhouse, being plain
brick and single-storied, with no other window than a
skylight in the roof, and a plain, unpanelled door with
a latch, and painted lead-colour, while upon the door and
the wall in its immediate vicinity are stuck many printed
placards and written notifications relating to the Pewker
interest, past, present, or to come. The Pewkers muster
strong on Saturday nights (that being the night on which
their enemies the drunkards take the field in greatest
force); and it was on a recent Saturday night that,
<pb n="171" id="p.171">
happening to walk that way, I turned into the hall to see
what was going on.
<p>Enrolled Pewkers-such was my first discovery-were
admitted free; but, not being in the enjoyment of that
privilege, an entrance-fee of one penny was demanded
of me at the door; this slight obstacle overcome, however, I was as free to enter as a Pewker born. The
business of the evening had not yet commenced, so I had
time to look about me.
<p>The hall was not so large as it seemed from the outside; nevertheless, it was of fair size, being, to the best
of my guessing, about fifty feet wide by thirty deep from
the street door to the platform, on which was mounted a
table and an armchair; and on the table, to my utter
astonishment, there was neatly and handily arranged two
long pipes, a paper of tobacco, and the sort of wooden
hammer that is seen in the hands of the ordinary cheap
concert-room chairman. The place was as clean as a
soup kitchen. The walls, nay, the very beams overhead, were whitewashed; and the floor, and the tables,
and the forms were as meekly clean as soap and scrubbing-brush could make them. Under the tables were
earthern spittoons, spotless as dinner plates, and filled
with white deal sawdust. In the centre of the room
was a gas stove, brilliant as a well-blacked boot, within
which primly twinkled a ring of sedate and well-regulated gas-jets. Everywhere the hand of the charwoman
-not the ordinary gin-drinking slut, but the abstaining
and conscientious charwoman - was visible; and the
contrast of Pewkers' Hall to the tavern parlour, with its
seductive rubbed mahogany, and its artfully arranged
ledges and nooks, its great coal fire, and its delusive
snugness and coziness, generally rendered complete.
Pictorial art had been called in for the decoration of
the walls. There were George Cruikshank's "Bottle"
plates, and his equally effective " Drunkard's Children."
Had these been all, it would have been well enough;
indeed, Pewker or anti-Pewker, it would have been hard
to find more eloquent and appropriate wall-hanging for
such a place. But it was not all by a frightful deal.
<pb n="172" id="p.172">
<p>
There were pictures-dozens of them-the subjects of
which appeared to be judiciously chosen with a view of
affecting at once the mind and the stomach of the beholder.
There were anatomical pictures, representing the liver of
the drunkard, as well as his various intestinal ducts and
canals during the last stage of gin rot. There was an
elaborate lilac and crimson drawing of the drunkard's
brain as it appeared during an attack of delirium tremens.
There were serio-comic pictures of drunkenness-one of
a man, brandy-nosed and hideously helpless, with the
upper part of his skull sawn off by fiends, while swarms
of tiny imps, with horns and tails, clambered about
him, rifling him completely. One sturdy devil was
perched on the inebriated one's shoulders, and with a
sort of coal scoop dug out the drunkard's brain, handing
it down in bucketfuls to the clambering imps. Some of
the imps, however, were otherwise engaged; they wriggled
in and out of the drunkard's pockets, and stole his money,
and his watch, and his spectacles, and his pocket-comb.
In the background of the picture stood, amicably posed,
the father of lies and deceit (in full uniform and with his
tail-tuft arranged as a trident), a publican, and a madhouse-keeper, holding in one extended hand a strait-jacket and in the other several hundredweight of chains
and manacles. The brain-bearing imps brought their
buckets to the madhouse-keeper; the pickpockets brought
their booty to the publican and poured it into his capacious fob; while the devil stood smilingly looking on,
calmly confident of the hulk when the wreckers had done
their worst with it. There were a dozen other pictures,
all of the same school, and containing, along with the
representative of drunkenness, at least one horned and
tailed devil, and imps, and hell-flames, and toads, and
fire-breathing scorpions and poison-snakes. It was quite
a relief to turn from them and listen to the homely tinkle
of spoons and teacups, and to sniff the grateful aroma of
mocha that now came steaming in from the open kitchendoor in the passage by the side of the platform.
<p>While I was examining the pictures the company were
coming in, so that when I now looked round, the hall was
<pb n="173" id="p.173">
tolerably full. The majority of those present were sad
and meek looking young men, in whom, as was evident
at a glance, the faculty for getting drunk was constitutionally wanting-a fact which detracted considerably
from their claim to be considered heroes of self-denial
in the matter of spirits and malt liquors. There were
a few middle-aged men, and the remainder was made up
of boys of fourteen or sixteen, who carried their heads
defiantly, and whose loins were evidently girded very
tight indeed, for a brush with the demon Alcohol, should
he dare venture to assail them. A tall woman, with a
high-necked frock and the sternest aspect, came round
for orders, and presently brought them, fifteen pints, at
least, on a big tea-tray, and which she carried with an
ease which doubtless acted as a caution to any youthful
Pewker disposed to offer her the least atom of impudence.
Seeing that coffee was to be had as well as tea, I ordered
a cup of it; and, as several gentlemen were smoking, I
smoked as well. Just as I had " lit up," and made myself as comfortable as one may on a ten-inch form without a back, in came the chairman.
To my great surprise, it was the Rev. Dapple Mookow
himself. It was not surprising that the patron, and
secretary, and treasurer should take the chair; but that
he should take a public pipe of birdseye as well! This
he did, however, jovially acknowledging the plaudits of
the auditory by waving the flaming splint with which he
ignited his tobacco. The person with the high-necked
gown brought him a cup of something-a common cup,
blue and brotherly-out of which he sipped, and then
faced about and rapped the table for silence.
<p>"Well, and how are we all ?" inquired Mr. Mookow,
in a motherly tone; " safe and sound, I hope, as when
last we met. Eh, is it so ? Has any brother to tell of
the Devil's tempting him ?"
<p>Nobody answered, though, to judge from the visage of
a lantern-jawed youth of about fifteen, who sat in the row
before mine, the odour of brimstone was in his nostrils,
and he strongly suspected Satan of having designs against
him. However, as it was a statement of facts and not of
<pb n="174" id="p.174">
suspicions that Mr. Mookow asked for, he merely gasped
significantly and held his peace. A general and joyful
clapping of hands ensued on the tacit understanding that
the old man of sin had tampered with no Pewker since
the previous Wednesday. After this Mr. Mookow
delivered a longish address on the advantages of "total
abstinence" and the frightful results of beer-drinking,
which altogether might well have served as text to the
blazing pictures on the wall; and I experienced much
relief when, after bringing both his fists to the table with
a tremendous bang, he consigned the drunkard's soul to
everlasting torment, wiped his perspiring brow with his
handkerchief, and said, in the blandest of voices-
<p>"And now, after business, let us seek pleasure. Let
us show the loathsome drunkard, as we have shown him
before, that we can be merry as well as wise, that we can
bandy the jest of abstinence, and laugh the temperate
laugh, and sing the soul-enlivening song, with as loud a
voice and as hearty as he, hiccuppy with strong drink,
drivels forth his blasphemous legends in praise of blood-poison-in praise of brain-rot-in praise of a shaven head
and a madman's rattling chain ! Brothers, we will have
a song. What shall it be ? "
<p>"Fill up the tea-urn!" "Coffee is my darling!"
<p>"The grog-blossomed nose ! " These and several other
strange and by myself never-before-heard song-titles
were bawled out in different parts of the room. " Fill
up the tea-urn " was, however, decidedly in the majority;
and, teacup in hand, the Rev. Mr. Mookow proceeded to
deliver himself of that stirring teetotal ditty, to the tune
of "Pour out the Rhine wine ":-
<lb>Fill up the tea-urn ! let it brim!
<lb>We'll have no stint in measure;
<lb>In the bubbling flood let the congou swim,
<lb>And set it on the hob to draw at leisure.
<lb>For there's nought can cheer the heart that's low
<lb>Like a steaming cup of the good congou.
<lb>CHORUS.
<lb>Like a steam-ing cup
<lb>Like a steam-ing cup
<lb>Like a steam-ing cup
<lb>O-o-o-f the good con-gou.
<pb n="175" id="p.175">
<lb>Pour out the cheering nut-brown stream,
<lb>With a hand that's firm and steady !
<lb>And an eye that's bright as a glad sunbeam,
<lb>In the cup that's standing milked and sugared ready.
<lb>Just try it once, and you'll find it so-
<lb>A drink divine is the good congou.
<lb>CHORUS.
<lb>A drink divine, &amp;c.
<lb>Spare not the tea-urn! fill again !
<lb>Nor fear to quaff its brewing.
<lb>It brings no pain, like the drunkard's drain,
<lb>Nor rags, nor madness, poverty and ruin.
<lb>Then trumpet its fame where'er you go,
<lb>And friendship pledge in the good congou.
<lb>CHORUS.
<lb>And friendship pledge, &amp;c.
<p>This stave, which Mr. Mookow sang very well, was
deservedly applauded; and the company "friendship
pledged" in the lauded beverage until nothing but
grounds remained in every cup, and some little time was
spent in replenishing. Order at length restored, Master
Shiddlecot (the lantern-jawed one already alluded to) was
called on for a song; a call to which he responded with
considerable alacrity, and commenced a stave which,
from its length and other causes, it is undesirable to give
here in its entirety. One verse will serve :
<lb>Our tea! our tea! our wholesome tea;
<lb>What a cheering sight is a cup of tea,
<lb>A cup-a cup of tea,
<lb>When it's up to the mark and perfectly sound,
<lb>And sweetened with sugar that's not over brown'd,
<lb>A drop of new milk, and the stir of a spoon,
<lb><lb>Completes it-the total abstainer's boon.
<lb>Away with your gin, rum, and ale, and give me
<lb>The cup that's delightful-a beautiful cup of tea!

<p>"Bravo! Mr. Shiddlecot; what shall we have the
pleasure of saying after that very excellent song ?" said
the chairman.
<p>"Well, sir, I don't know any toasts or sentiments,"
replied Mr. Shiddlecot. "But if you are agreeable, I'll
substitute a conundrum. Why is a drunkard pulling a
cat's tail like Mr. Jones's teacup ?"
<pb n="176" id="p.176">

<p>One prolonged giggle at the not unreasonably embarrassed Mr. Jones, and then a dead stillness.
<p>"Come, we give it up, Mr. Shiddlecot," laughed the
chairman. " It's one of your posers, I suppose."
<p>"You give it up ?" replied Mr. Shiddlecot, glancing
proudly triumphant round him. "Then, gentlemen,
the reason why a drunkard pulling a cat's tail is like Mr.
Jones's teacup is, because he's tea's in it! "
Pewkers' Hall was not a handsome edifice, but to be
capable of standing, without the slightest tremor, the
tremendous explosion of laughter that followed Mr.
Shiddlecot's explanation spoke volumes for its great
strength. Several riddles followed, but not one of them
was fit to hold a candle to that of Mr. Shiddlecot; and
after a while Mr. Barker was called on for a stave. This
was one of the elderly gentlemen who sat in the front
row, and was evidently on terms of intimacy with Mr.
Mookow.
<p>"I think I must decline," said Mr. Barker, clearing
his voice ready to begin. "I don't know any songs but
those I make up myself, and I'm sure you must be tired
of hearing them."
<p>"So they must, Barker; so they must," observed a
brisk-looking young fellow, who had come in late, and
who, judging from his countenance, was not always a
Pewker. "That's what I tell them when they call on me."
"Ay, ay; but you won't get out of it, Mr. Jonas,"
was the universal exclamation, and then followed a
rattling of crockery and a cry of " The Fiery Nose! The
Fiery Nose! "
<p>"Well, if I must, I must," said Mr. Jonas, modestly;
"but at present the call is with Mr. Barker."
<p>And, without further ado, Mr. Barker struck up. His
song seemed to have no particular title, and it was
adapted to a " nigger" tune popularly known as " Rosa
May," and ran as follows:-
<lb>Come, brothers, listen unto me, and a story I'll relate,
<lb>How I in time was rescued from a wretched drunkard's fate.
<lb>I used to swill my nightly fill of ale, and beer, and gin,
<lb>Nor for my wife and family cared I a single pin.
<pb n="177" id="p.177">
<lb>My eyes were bleared, a razed beard, likewise a drunkard's nose;
<lb>My children bare and naked were, because I pawned their clothes;
<lb>My wife I bruised, and much ill-used, and, shameful thing to say,
<lb>Distrained the bed from under her my tavern score to pay.
<lb>But, thanks to Mr. Mookow, now all that is set aside;
<lb>Upon my wife and family I now can look with pride.
<lb>The reason's plain, I now abstain, and mean to, never fear-
<lb>I never more intend to be a slave to gin and beer.
<p>There was a generous amount of applause at this by no
means cheerful lay, which had barely subsided when the
call for" The Fiery Nose " broke out most vociferously.
"Come, Mr. Jonas," said the chairman, persuasively,
"they will have it, you see."
<p>"Well, sir, I will, since you wish it," replied Mr.
Jonas. "But it is a painful song for me to sing, it is
indeed; not on account of the tune, that's easy enough;
it's the sentiment that makes it painful."
<p>"Nonsense ! "Tit for Tat " " Give and Take! "
"Serve 'em right! " "Go on, Jonas " These and similar cries seemed to reassure the teetotal poet, and to the
tune of the "Cork Leg," and with voice and action excellent enough to have made his fortune at Canterbury
Hall, he commenced " The Fiery Nose" :-
<lb>A certain man in our town
<lb>A tippler was of great renown.
<lb>Gin, whiskey, or rum, whichever he saw,
<lb>Were welcome to enter his thirsty maw.
<lb>Right toorallooral, &amp;c.
<lb>He drank and he drank till, as you may suppose,
<lb><lb>He presently sported a fiery nose,
<lb>And it grew so hot that it came to this,
<lb>If it touched his liquor, it made it " hiss." Chorus.
<lb>At length came a day, so the story is told,
<lb>The hot-nosed man caught a terrible cold.
<lb>The nose he blew, he'd himself but to blame
<lb>And he blew till it smouldered and burst in a flame. Chorus.
<lb>Though a careful man was this tippling sot,
<lb><lb>His house was insured, but his nose was not.
<lb>So he rushed to the street, with a gasp and a cough,
<lb>And buried his snout in the cool horsetrough. Chorus.
<pb n="178" id="p.178">
<lb>Though the water began to boil in a minute,
<lb>It failed to extinguish the blazing nose in it.
<lb>The flame it increased, and grew broader and higher,
<lb>Till the trough and the pump were one crackling fire. Chorus.
<lb>Now, finding himself in this terrible plight,
<lb>He took to his heels with all his might,
<lb>Till he found a distillery yard, when, pat,
<lb>He soused head-over-heel in a brimming vat. Chorus.
<lb>Alarmed at sight of the terrible flame,
<lb>The distiller himself and his foreman came.
<lb>He heard the tippler's story out,
<lb>Then winked like a man who knows what he's about. Chorus.
<lb>Said he, " Though I cannot extinguish your nose,
<lb><lb>If you'll listen awhile I've a scheme to propose.
<lb>I'll give you two hundred a year if you'll stay,
<lb>And pass all your time in this self-same way." Chorus.
<lb>The man with the fiery nose agreed.
<lb>The distiller his fortune made with speed,
<lb><lb>For whenever he wanted a brewing of gin,
<lb>He'd a vat fill with water and pop the man in. Chorus.
<lb>An hour in soak was quite enough,
<lb>When the liquor became most capital stuff.
<lb>How the man with the fiery nose must grin
<lb>When he hears the fame of his " sparkling gin " Chorus.
<p>The applause was deafening, and an encore unanimously
demanded, when, seeing that Mr. Jonas was about to
comply, I thought it time to bid the Pewkers goodnight.</div1>
<pb n="179" id="p.179"><div1 type="chapter"><head>XXIV.
A JOURNEY TO EPSOM.</>
<p>THE picture of a solitary individual abroad and
astir in Epsom town while it is yet so early
that but a slender slip of sunlight twinkles on
the bed-room windows on one side of the road,
and the pigeons of the place still strut fearlessly upon the pavement, and the policeman has not yet
abandoned that solemn, measured tramp which is his
night tramp, and very different from the free-and-easy,
slack-knee'd step with which he moves through the town
when it is up and alive, is likely to suggest thoughts on
the probable business of the solitary one-especially as
his way tends to the lane which leads to the Downs-of a
not particularly flattering sort. Perhaps he is a "tout,"
or, in other words, a horse spy and a skulker, on his way
to the exercise-ground, there to climb a tree or lie flat on
his face in the grass, timing the pace of the racers and
making note of it. Perhaps he is a hired ruffian with
sharp stones in his pocket to be strewn over the ground
where Blair Athol takes his morning "breather," in the
diabolical hope that one of them may pierce the innocent
foot of that sensitive creature and cripple him everlastingly. Perhaps, again-and I think he does look a leetle
too respectable to be either a tout or a horse-lamer; he is
more F. than R., as the saying is-some restless wretch
of a grocer or pork-butcher, who has pawned his shop
and what there is in it, and his wife's earrings and best
gown, and his own shirt-studs and silver hunting-watch
that he may "get well on " a horse which, though at long
odds, is a "certainty," and of which he has got the
"tip," for the small charge of a guinea, from that
<pb n="180" id="p.180">
wideawake tipster, "Weazle," of the Spouting Life. Perhaps it is "Weazle;" but that is scarcely likely; so
remarkable a character must surely be known to the
police, whereas the early bird in question passes the
representative of the Epsom constabulary without so
much as an exchange of nods.
<p>No, the solitary one is neither a " tout," nor a horselamer, nor a pork-butcher, nor "Weazle;" he is the
reader's very humble servant, the writer, who flatters
himself that at this time, five o'clock in the morning of
the 25th of May, there is not a happier man in Epsom;
and this because he has no sort of business at Epsom
at all. He has nothing to sell, no "flys" to let, no
appointments to keep, and he doesn't care twopence
whether the Derby laurels are carried off by Cambuscan
or the rankest outsider. He has already partaken of a
cup of coffee and a crust, and his breakfast will be ready
at ten o'clock, when he will return to it. Meanwhile, he
has plenty of tobacco and some pipelights, and an umbrella in case it should rain, and he is bound for Epsom
Downs; and if the reader has a mind we will link arms
and leisurely stroll thither together.
<p>Pompeii, on the morning of the day of its devastation,
could not have exhibited more serenity than does Epsom
town as we enter it from the clock-tower end. Absolutely
certain as it is that within six short hours the place, road
and pavement, will be overrun by a reckless host, a
ravening host, hungry as locusts, and as indomitably
bent on devouring every green thing-a parched host,
thirsting for drink as the sands of the desert-an uproarious host, fishing for mischief and helter-skelter
devilry as though mischief was the essential salt of their
lives, and only to be had for the scrambling after once a
year at Epsom. Inevitable as is all this, the Epsomites
slumber in content; the white blinds at the chamber
windows are tranquil as though it were a Sunday morning; and, looking up and down the High-street, the only
out-thrust and anxious head appears under a tumbled
nightcap at an upper window of the <placeName>Spread Eagle Tavern</>, and can belong to no other than a betting-man,
<pb n="
181" id="p.181">
whose " book " is made up to the finest points of wind
and weather, and who really ought to pull through,
considering how handsomely he has backed Providence for
sunshine. A little way up a green lane there is the Epsom
police-station, and there, in anticipation of a tremendously
hard day, two policemen are on duty, one of them in his
shirt-sleeves hanging out a blackbird among the flowering creepers that grow about and above the door, and
the other with a fragrant pipe at full blast, while with a
wisp of bass he secures a refractory hollyhock growing in
the pretty garden in front. I should like to see the cells
at Epsom station-house. I believe they are made of
lattice-work, and painted the cheerfullest green, with a
cool thatched roof covered with stonecrop. If I were
condemned to hard labour there, I should expect it to
consist in shelling green peas or making reed squeakers
for the inspector's children. Perhaps, however, I might
find myself mistaken. If I were a professional evil-doer
on my first visit to Epsom on a Derby Day, and, seeing
the tasty little station-house, laughed to think how easy
it would be to break out of it if by ill-luck a policeman
interrupted me at business at the Grand Stand, I certainly should be very much mistaken; for, knowing the
said Grand Stand from the flagstaff to the cellars, I likewise know of a particularly dingy and secure apartment
there, in which the police stow brawlers and pickpockets
until it is convenient to convey them away in the
evening.
<p>Talking of the Grand Stand, as we top that steep and
dusty hill, up which many thousands of men, Jack-o'-lantern light of heart, have climbed as buoyantly as
though at top were to be found certain rest and luxury
that would last, and down which exactly the same number, to a single one, have toiled as wearily as though it were the flintiest steep, chokeful of despair and amazement, and grateful to their jaunty green gauze veils for
hiding their troubled faces,-mounting this hill, we come
in sight of Mr. Dorling's palace of deal boards, glistening
white in the morning sun, and recalling to the mind
various images, some profane and gay, and some scriptural
<pb n="182" id="p.182">
as well as sepulchral, but withal a well-pitched edifice,
and affording capital observation of the racecourse.
Everyone is satisfied with the management of the building, including, it is generally understood, the manager;
and no wonder, when he is able to accommodate five
thousand visitors, and the ready-money system is rigidly
enforced.
<p>Satisfactory, however, as are the Grand-Stand arrangements, it seems to me that in one department at least
there is room for improvement. I allude to the " betting-ring," which is most unsavourily situated just under the
noses of the best class of Grand-Stand visitors. Being
commonly engaged in raising mammon, a few whiffs of
brimstone of a coarser quality than ordinary might be
tolerated in the nostrils of the " upper ten; " but when
it comes to sulphur of the Saffron Hill sort, when one is
compelled to the reflection that a good percentage of the
costermonger clamour heard below is the selfsame that
gave tongue on the Field Lane ruins on Saturday last,
and that the gentleman in the bran new paletot and
glossy hat, from whose mouth the idea of the patent
expanding trunk might have taken its origin, and who is
so industriously yelping as to the odds he will lay about
this, that, and the other, is the same individual who is to
be seen any day in the neighbourhood above mentioned,
luring numskull butcher-boys and shoemakers' apprentices to stake their half-crowns and shillings, the result
is not pleasing to one's dignity or manhood. Is there no
room in the cellars for these yellow flies? Or, better
still, could they not be accommodated on the roof ? If
they could, it would be better for themselves-better for
everybody. They would no longer offend the organs of
sight, and hearing, and smell, in honest men; and they,
by being enabled to look out far and wide, would be spared
that minute of horrible torture when the racers are lost
behind the hill-when they go down like a doubtful
swimmer in deep and weedy water, who will presently
rise to fling up his arms and drown, or show his confident
face and his lusty shoulders, sure tokens of peril past.
How will it be ? The pulsings of the desperate bettingman's
<pb n="183" id="p.183">heart took the time of his horse's hoofs-hirrup
hirrup ! hirrup !-over the springy turf, when he last saw
him; and if that " hirrup " has increased in speed in the
same degree with the thumping under the wretch's waistcoat, the gallant horse will "land" the stakes to a certainty. But it is doubtful-so horribly doubtful, that
the betting-man's arterial steed will surely gallop itself
out of life unless the other makes great haste. Now for
it ! Now we shall know! No, not yet! Was there ever
such a crawling match ? For less than a little minute the
horses are lost behind the hill, yet there is time enough for
the gambler to review all his business with that horse-that magnificent horse-that infernal horse. "Bless him !
he's sure to win. Confound him why did I lay a penny
on him?" He thinks of what that cautious fellow,
Brown, told him, and curses himself for not taking the
advice; and again, in the thousandth part of a second,
on what Jones put him up to, and reviles himself as an
idiot for thinking for a moment on anything that such a
timid donkey as Brown should say. So he shifts his few
miserable straws from left to right, and tortures himself
with the problem of sink or swim, until-<p>But, really, to discuss the emotions of the man of
"Mammon's acre" is not the purpose of this paper.
Who cares whether he sinks or swims ? Sink he must
some day, and as well to-day as to-morrow. He is like
a pig which, swimming against the tide, inevitably cuts
his throat with his hoofs. It doesn't matter. He didn't
fall into the flood-was not pushed in. He took a deliberate "header," trusting to the "Betting-man's Guide,"
with all the latest dodges and improvements, as a lifebelt. The " Guide " instructed him that the best way to
catch flat fish floating blindly with the stream was to
take the tide the other way and meet them. And a very
profitable game he found it until the " spoony" fry came
to know the snout of the hungry pike, and avoided him.
Then, in desperation, up came the hoofs for one good,
bold dash among the minnows, and his gullet is slit beyond repair. And a good job done. A good job if every
pig of the fiendish breed would follow the example of
<pb n="184" id="p.184">
that ancient herd recorded in Sacred Writ, and gratify
us with a last view of their heels over the shingle of the
seabeach.
<p>Let us turn our backs on the Grand Stand, where the
sweepers are busily sweeping and the upholsterers are
tacking up extra red baize for the great occasion; and on
the high-railed ring, within which a labourer is hard at
work gathering up yesterday's crumpled sandwich-papers
and orange-peel; and on the "course," on which a
dozen men are busy with shovels and brooms and rammers, smoothing out the dents in the turf made by yesterday's racers, and filling up every hole with almost as
much care as a joiner prepares a dining-table for polishing. With these-at least, at present-we have nothing
to do. We have climbed the hill, not on business, but
for pleasure's sake, and for the gratification of an idle
curiosity to know the kind of figure cut by Epsom Downs
early in the morning of the great race. It could scarcely
be called idle curiosity either, since it grew out of much
speculation and laboured puzzling on the singular fact-as proved by observation from the window of our lodging
at the London end of the town-that whereas, since
Monday morning, at least five thousand individuals had
turned into the lane that leads to the hill atop of which
the downs begin, not more than two thousand had come
back again up to a late hour on Tuesday night. What
had become of those other three thousand ? What were
they doing up on the bleak downs ? Where did they
sleep ? and how ?-for although many had gone up with
carts and waggons, and smart caravans with a chimney in
the roof and a knocker on the door, in which it was easy
enough to lie snug and warm; hundreds had tramped it
afoot, carrying neither bag nor baggage, not so much as
a little bundle no bigger than a night-shirt would make.
Neither had they any money; for regularly as, limping
along on their crooked-heel boots, they came to Bonsor's
ham-and-beef shop, with its pillars of brisket and its
rounds in mighty hillocks, and a greater number of
sausage-rolls than would have filled a cornbin, they invariably halted and indulged in a visionary banquet,
<pb n="185" id="p.185">
picking out the crustiest of the new penny loaves, and
helping themselves to fat, and to lean, and to mustard,
and taking a bite at the German sausage, and going
leisurely in for a ham-knuckle, with pickled cabbage;
meanwhile soothing their cruelly-tantalised stomachs
under cover of their trouser-pockets; but never on a
single occasion had I observed them to enter Bonsor's
shop, which I am sure they would have done had they
even so much as the price of a sausage-roll about them.
Penniless, hungry, and so tired that, even after the first
imaginary plateful outside Bonsor's, they might be seen
yawning and blinking as they leant against the brass
window rail, what on earth could take them to Epsom
Downs, and what did they find there that, liking it so
very much, they could not leave it ? This was part of
the riddle it was the purpose of our excursion to solve,
but it proved a tougher business than was anticipated.
It was a perfect hedgehog of a riddle-the closer you
approached it the tighter it curled itself up. There they
were, the hungry and penniless ones, crouched against
the outer canvas of the booths, huddled dogwise under
carts and vans, or lying blankly on the open plain with
their faces to the earth, and their caps for a pillow, and
their ugly heads of hair blending with the grass and bedewed like it. This, as regards some of them-the lazy
ones, or, may be, the midnight arrivals who had manfully
achieved the twenty and odd miles from Whitechapel
Church to Epsom Clock-tower, but had been dead beaten
by the hill, and, spent and pluckless, so soon as they
came to a nice soft bit of turf, had there plunged down,
in much the same spirit as mad folks plunge from a bridge
for a water cure for all their aches and pains.
<p>It seemed so certain that they were lying uncomfortable
that it was a great temptation to wake them; but when
on looking about one saw what they were like when they
were awake, the inclination was immediately checked.
They were perfect images of neglect, and famine, and
dust-especially of dust. Dust was in their hair, their eyes,
and their ears; it came in puffs out of the rents and holes
in their boots when they walked; it lodged on the ledges
<pb n="186" id="p.186">
the cobbles and patches made in their jackets and trousers;
their very skin had the hue of a dusty old felt carpet, and
looked as though, if you attempted to beat it, you would
be instantly smothered. Yesterday's dust and yesterday's
sweat mingled to make their thin hands and faces loathsome, and yesterday's hunger and weariness looked out
at their heavy eyes. Some of them, in groups of fours
and fives, crouched over a spluttering, smoky fire of gorse
and green sticks, were warming their cramped limbs
(for, the reader must know, the wind blows chilly at six
o'clock on a May morning on Epsom Downs); some
meekly skulked close to the big fires the coffee-vendors
had by this time kindled under their kettles; and some,
the youngest, hung about such of the company as chanced
to be engaged in the consumption of victuals, fawning
and looking up for a bit like drovers' dogs at a cattlefair. There was one boy whom I distinctly recollected as
gazing in at Bonsor's window yesterday, and now, with
about an equal prospect of success, he was Bonsorising
a fair-going looking sort of a person with knee-breeches
of velveteen, and a cap made of the skin of some bristly
animal, and who, squatted on the grass with some cold
boiled beef and a loaf, and some beer in a tin bottle, between
his outstretched legs, was calmly discussing his breakfast.
Presently the beefeater took a bite out of a big crust and
then laid it down without the boundary of his legs, and
Bonsor, regarding it as a waif, was down upon it instantly.
Not so quickly, however, as the beefeater was down upon
him. He caught Bonsor in the very act, and gave him
a rap on the knuckles with the buckhorn handle of his
big clasp-knife.
<p>"Hook it, will yer! yer (something) young prig,"
said he, grinning, with his mouth full of boiled beef; as
poor Bonsor gave a howl and a wriggle, and got out of
his way. He wriggled close to where I was standing,
and, presuming on our slight acquaintance, I ventured
to address him-
<p>"Did I not see you yesterday in Epsom town, my
man?"
<p>For an instant Bonsor's boy took in my length and

<pb n="187" id="p.187">
breadth with a glance peculiar to London boys and
robins, and then, not feeling fully assured that I was
not something in the detective line, replied evasively-
<p>"Well, what on it?"
<p>"Nothing to me," I said; "only you seemed to be
looking for something to eat then; and, unless I'm mistaken, that is what you are doing now."
<p>"That is what I am doing," replied Bonsor, once more
furtively taking my measure while he sucked his sore
knuckles. "You don't happen to have a job as would
bring a cove in as much as would fetch a bit of grub and
a drop of coffee-eh, guvnor ? "
<p>"Yes, I have," I replied; "as easy a job as you are
likely to find. Answer me three questions, and I will
give you a shilling. To begin with, what brought you
to Epsom ? "
<p>"Chance of picking up a job or so," replied Bonsor,
promptly, and with his hands behind him, as though I
was questioning him out of the Church Catechism.
<p>"That's what brings all us coves down here; " and he
gave a comprehensive sweep with his chin, indicating
that by "us coves" he meant the sleepers on the grass
and the crouchers over the fires.
<p>"In what way ?"
<p>"Forty ways," replied Bonsor, with difficulty concealing his contempt for my ignorance; "there's the
c'rect card coves-two bob a dozen at the Stand, and a
werry tidy pull for coves with a bit of money to lay out;
and then there's cigar-lights, and dolls to stick in the
hats, and noses and hair, and clean yer boots, and all
sorts of amoosing things for gents what wins. Then
there's the brushing coves, and them as fetches water,
and them as looks arter the empty bottles and the bones.
Lor ! I can't tell you half on 'em."
<p>"And do they all find it worth their while to tramp all
the way from London and back again ?"
<p>"Well, don't yer see, it's all speckerlation, and that's
the beauty on it," replied Bonsor, wagging his head
admiringly. " You never know what's going to turn up
one minnit from another. Why, I knows a man who
<pb n="188" id="p.188">

once had a pound given him for fetching a pail of water.
It's all luck, don't yer know. You might make a crown,
and you mightn't make enough to get a lift home in
a wan."
<p>"Are there many such unlucky ones ?"
<p>"I believe yer. Old uns, don't yer know, what's out
of work and too 'spectable like for noses, and hair, and
dolls, and c'rect cards, is no use unless a feller can run;
so they comes out a brushing. Yes; and when they
gets here," continued Bonsor, his extremely dirty face
lighting up at the absurdity of the thing, "when they
gets here they'll see a cove what comes from their parts
in a pleasure-wan, or something of that, and aint got the
cheek to take out their brush arter all, and trot home,
when it's dark, just the same as they come."
<p>And at this Bonsor, conscious that he had given me
my three answers fair and full, and one over, withdrew
his hands from behind him, and twiddled his finger and
thumb expectantly. The next minute he was negotiating
with a coffee man, while I strolled in among the booths
and gipsy-tents, picturing to myself one of the poor, old,
broken-down fellows, " too 'spectable for noses and hair,"
spending the livelong day lurking behind show-vans and
booths, and nut-targets, and wrathfully watching the
van which brought down Jenkins, the ladies' bootmaker,
who lives just over the way where the old fellow lives.
The tablecloth is spread on a board in the van, and the
old fellow, from his miserable hiding, can see the flash
of knives and forks, and the foaming glasses of bottled
beer; and, if he were not such a proud old donkey, he
might hail Jenkins (who is as good a soul as ever lived),
and, in a twinkling, be eating and drinking to his heart's
content. Not he; he hates Jenkins with the deadliest
hatred, and nothing, or so he thinks, would give him
greater pleasure than to see the stuck-up fellow swallow
too large a bit of meat, and choke himself on the spot.
And so he lurks and watches, with a vague intention
of beginning business when Jenkins has gone, till night
approaches, and Jenkins and everyone else goes, and the
foolish old boy goes too, with his respectable old clothes-
<pb n="189" id="p.189">
brush--the very one with which in better times he has,
often and often, proudly flicked the dust from his Sunday clothes-hanging a dead and profitless weight in his
pocket, as it has hung ever since his old woman wrapped
it in paper for him last night (giving him at the same
time her last threepence that he might not want for a
half-pint of beer and a bit of 'bacca on the road), he
fags homeward in the dust and the deepening dusk,
keeping the wall to be out of the way of the lively mob
who hold the road; fags along for an hour or more, till
it grows quite dark, and the vehicles bowling along past
him, less in number, but faster and more uproariously,
the drivers being drunk to a man; fags along till he
reaches the dark road near to Croydon, by which time
it is past midnight, and the inns are closed, and it is full
five minutes since he heard the clatter of wheels, and,
quite dead beat, he sits down on the grass that skirts
the road "just for a rest," and there he sleeps till the
sunshine wakes him.
<p>As the Bonsor boy observed, " it's all speckerlation."
Speculation fills the Grand Stand and the betting-ring;
speculation and the legend of the man who once upon a
time got 1 for fetching a pail of water incites decent
elderly men, as well as those with whom decency has
long ceased to be a consideration, and ruffianly young
men, and blackguardly boys, to undertake the lengthy
journey. " Speckerlation," then, may be taken as the
answer to the riddle respecting the three thousand who
went up on to the Downs and did not come down again
-that is to say, as far as the brushers, and the water-carriers, and the noses-and-hairs, and the pipelights,
and the c'rect cards, went towards making up the total,
which was not very considerable. Of the remainder,
some were speculators and some were not. Among the
former must, I suppose, be classed the various bands of
Ethiopian "serenaders," many of whom, divested of
their business wool and " long-tail blues," mixed with the
crowd or conversed at the coffee-stalls, their nigger masks
of yesterday (consisting of ivory-black and beer) looking
much the worse for wear and a night's tumbling on
<pb n="190" id="p.190">
straw. And what else than as speculators could you
regard the score or so of professional sparrers and glove-boxers who, in the intervals of racing, delight the aristocracy of the Grand Stand with an exhibition of scientific
nose-punching and eye-blacking? and who, roused at
this early hour, not because they have had sleep enough,
but because their drouthy natures were famishing for
beer, stroll about with their hands in their trousers
pockets, and yawning their great jaws, with countenance
about as amiable as that a bull-dog, who had attacked
the supposititious calf of a wooden-legged man, might be
imagined as wearing.
<p>Then there were the cockshy-men and the Aunt-Sally
men, and the men who were not to be mistaken for
tailors because they carried a thimble in their pocket,
or as persons in the farming interest from the circumstance of their happening to be possessed of two or three
peas. And the target-keepers; and the proprietors of
pulling, and punching, and weighing machines, and
machines at which you will, by-and-by, be invited to
"blow," by way of testing the strength of your lungs;
and the victuallers, licensed and unlicensed; and the
"wheel-of-fortune" keepers, man and woman, attended
by their "jollies" (who, as may be explained to the
innocent reader, are those wonderfully lucky persons
who, coming up quite promiscuously, win and carry away
the sets of china and diamond earrings); and the party
with the performing dogs; and the gentleman who
smashes lumps of granite with his naked fist: and fifty
others, speculators all; not forgetting the busy little
barber who rushes about among them all, with his belt
fuller stuck with sharp-edged weapons than the girdle
of an Ojibbeway, crying out, "Now, then ! now, then!
One at a time! Here's the barber! the barber ! the
bar-BER!" doing a very good trade at a penny a shave,
and being on the best of terms with the fair folks, no
one denying him the loan of their fire for his shaving-pot, or making a rumpus when, in the pushing and
jostling, he happened to nick a bit out of their chins.
And if the reader can imagine the various characters

<pb n=
"191" id="p.191">
sketched engaged in making preparations for the company
who will presently arrive-the booth-keepers sweeping
out and hanging up their banners; the gingerbread-nut
women arranging their spruce stalls, and darting amongst
their great canisters, and joking and laughing amongst
themselves with that jollity which the vending of gingerbread seems invariably to confer; and the owners of the
rifle-targets adjusting their lengths of tubing, like steamboat funnels; and the cockshy-men squatting about and
trimming cockshy-sticks with a spokeshave, or weaving
their rush-baskets to hold the earth into which the shysticks are stuck; and the niggers, grouped in retired
corners, blacking each other's faces, and adjusting their
wigs and paper collars before a looking-glass upheld
against their monstrous hats; and the brushers and
bruisers, and rag and tag generally, aiming aimlessly
at that "bob" which is always to be picked up here-and
he will have a faithful picture of what Epsom Downs are
like early in the morning of the great race.
<p>It is all over-nine hours since by ordinary humdrum
time o' day, ages since according to Epsom Downs time,
between the start for the "great event" and when the
upreared number-board by the judge's chair declared
who the victor was. We didn't see the race. We never
meant to see it. According to our expressed intention,
we came home to breakfast at ten a.m., and remained at
home until midnight. It was nothing to us who the
winner was, though, as it chanced, we knew as soon
almost as anybody in the town, for, at about a quarter
past four o'clock, whilst sitting behind the window-curtain, comfortably discussing a delightful little book-the
"History of Epsom," by a clergyman-kindly lent us
by the landlady, hearing a swift pattering of feet (Epsom
town is curiously still from ten till four on a Derby
Day), we looked out, and spied the grocer's young man
rushing, hatless and breathless, up the street, and when
he came to the cheesemonger's young man, who was at
his shopdoor to hear the news, he cried with deep emotion,
"It's all up, Dick ! That blessed Blair Athol has gone
<pb n="192" id="p.192">
and done it!" And so he had: General Peel coming in
second, and Scottish Chief third. About the positions of
the other horses we need not trouble ourselves.
It's all over. The two hundred thousand who went up
the hill have come down again; the judge has pocketed
his fifty pounds and gone home, and is by this time-or so
we hope, for it is past twelve o'clock-a-bed and calmly
asleep, and the thousands whom his judgment made happy
or miserable have also gone home, some to bed, and some
to celebrate their good luck by getting shockingly tipsy,
and some to mourn over their bad luck and pass the
remainder of the night wearily figuring and planning
how they may find a way out of the bog Blair Athol
has flung them into. The turbulent sea that surged over
the Downs and reached even to the brow of the great
hill has subsided, leaving them blank, save for the booths
and vans, which in the distance loom shapelessly and
black; save for the lights from torches and lanterns
twinkling like glow-worms; and still, save for the
snatches of song and laughter coming from the spot
where the vans and booths are most thickly clustered;
for what has been fun for the sightseers, has been real
hard work for those whom we saw so busily "making
ready" in the morning, and now that their customers
have gone, leaving their money behind 'em, their Derby
holiday commences, and they arrange comfortable parties,
and dance, and sing, and play cards, and eat up what is
known as the " overplush" of ham sandwiches and such
other food as will not keep handsomely through a warm
night. They likewise give a fair share of their patronage
to the " overplush " beer, and about two in the morning
become rather noisy.
<p>Nobody, however, is ever taken up for being drunk
and disorderly on Epsom Downs on the Derby night.
There are policemen on the spot, but they are all snugly
housed at the Grand Stand in a great room, where
there is a jolly fire, and plenty of mattresses, on which
the officers recline with their coats and boots off. Just
for form's sake, they march out in a body two or three
times in the course of the night, but it is only to look

<pb n="193" id="p.193">
in, in a good-humoured way, at the booths where there
is most row, and mildly recommend peace and harmony.
The ugliest customers the police have to deal with are
the gipsies-those free and blithesome individuals who
scorn house-dwelling and prefer to herd in dens no better
than dog-kennels. The gipsies, however, are not troublesome on account of their drunken propensities, but from
their disposition for plunder. Heaven help the unlucky
wretch who, drinking himself past consciousness, lies
down in a corner to sleep and is forgotten by the party
with whom he came from London! Not only will the
gipsies rob and beat him-they will strip him to the
skin, and drive him off, pelting him as he runs. The
watchmen at the Grand Stand, more than once or twice
attracted by the cries of the victim, have found him
without a rag shivering at the door, and kindly lent
him a sack to cover and comfort him, and enable him to
set out on his walk back to London without delay. It
is because of these gipsy ruffians that the booth-keepers
provide themselves with firearms; and, as the night
wanes and the revellers tire, and the twinkling lights
grow fewer, there is heard on every side a tremendous
banging, caused by the booth-keepers discharging their
guns and pistols at their doors to let the gipsies know
what they may expect should they venture in after the
money-box.
<div1 type="chapter"><head>XXV.
THE COSTERS' CARNIVAL.</>
<p>IN a little alley, which offers a convenient and
near " cut" from our street to the main road,
resides our greengrocer. He is a most wonderful man, being at once the most shrewd,
and shiftless, and idle, and everlastingly active
fellow that ever was born. Ours is a new neighbourhood, and we are very glad to patronise Mr. Tibbits and
his perambulating store. Blending with the music of the
morning muffin-bell you may hear his melodious voice
chanting in praise of his cabbages and his plums of
"Arline." At midday he may be seen retailing coals, in
the afternoon toiling to some carpet-ground with a cartload of dirty carpeting, and his early evenings are consumed in moving goods or servants' luggage. After that
he disappears, and is seen no more that night except by
the policeman and such of the public as may happen to
be abroad at midnight. Then he is drunk-not helplessly
so, inasmuch as he is able to keep his legs by hanging
heavily on to the chorus of the last rollicking stave sung
at "The Jolly Sandboys"-but very tipsy indeed, beyond
question.
<p>This was so last night, the night before, any and every
night; yet to-morrow morning, certain as the rising sun,
and even before the sun has risen, Mr. Tibbits will be
again afoot and at work. It is the invariable habit of
this indefatigable one-this cabbage-bawling, carpet-beating, gravel-carting, coal-selling, goods-removing,
servants'-box-conveying, " Jolly Sandboy"-boosing person, who never seeks his own door until that of the public-house
<pb n="195" id="p.195">
 is closed against him-it is this man's custom to
work fifteen hours, to waste five, and take no more than
the little remainder for rest, summer and winter, all the
year round. It must be so. Covent Garden is a " solid"
seven miles from Mr. Tibbits's abode, which makes the
double journey fourteen, to say nothing of market stop-pages and a load to take home. Mr. Tibbits has but one
holiday a year, and that is at Barnet autumn fair time.
It was only within the last few days that I became
acquainted with the fact that he gave himself this holiday.
On the morning of Tuesday week his voice was unheard
in the street, and we thought, to be sure, that the poor
man was ill. Happening, however, that morning to avail
myself of his short-cut alley, I was agreeably surprised
to perceive a German band before his door, which it was
only natural to suppose would scarcely be allowed if
anything very terrible ailed the poor greengrocer. On
arriving opposite his shop my mind was set quite at ease
as regarded apprehensions as to Mr. Tibbits's state of
health, though I could not quite make out the state of
affairs; for there, arrayed in bran-new corduroys and a
starched and snowy shirt, was our worthy greengrocer
himself, adjusting his blue bird's-eye neckerchief by aid
of a bit of looking-glass stuck against the wall. The
cause of his banishment from the little parlour behind
the shop was evident, a gorgeously-bonneted head being
there visible " putting itself to rights" in the glass over
the mantel-shelf. Having arranged the neckerchief to
his satisfaction, Mr. T. donned a waistcoat of elaborate
design and of the pattern known as "the dog's-paw;"
and, with his thumbs hooked in the armholes thereof,
came to the door, with his hair radiant of bear's-grease
and his face beaming with happiness, to view the
musicians; wagging his head like a loyal subject as the
tow-haired vagabonds squeaked and squealed from their
brazen instruments that magnificent anthem, "God bless
the Prince of Wales," after the performance of which he
appeared much relieved, and producing a half-gallon can
from under the shop-counter, and inviting the instrumenta1ists to chink, inquired if they knew something " a
<pb n="196" id="p.196">
little rousier," whereon they stuck up "Annie Laurie,"
but had scarcely proceeded as far as " Maxwelton braes"
when Mr. T. imperiously waved them to silence.
<p>"That's a rare rouser, that is," said he, with mild
sarcasm; "ain't you got sense enough to serve your
customers with wot's in season ? Something in this
style, now;" and clearing his throat, Mr. T. favoured
the astonished Teutons with the first verse of the ancient
stave-
<lb>"Ere older you grow, here's a song you should know,
<lb>I'd advise you to buy and to larn it,
<lb>T'other day 't happened so, with a friend I did go
<lb>To see the famed races of Barnet.
<lb>Sing fol-de-rol fol-de-rol-lay."
<p>It needed not the appearance at this juncture of Mr.Tibbits's cart and horse (the former clean washed and with
three Windsor chairs ranged in it, betokening " a party,"
and the latter with his mane and tail neatly plaited and
tied with cherry-coloured ribbon) to explain the mystery.
The cat was out. Our greengrocer was going to Barnet
Pair. Without doubt this was his holiday of the year.
Christmas was nothing to him, for, as I distinctly recollect, he left word the day before " that if extra fruit or
anything was wanted, he should be open all day;" on
Derby Day he was bawling green-peas and gooseberries;
on the Mondays of Whitsun and Easter he was seen at
a neighbouring fair with his cart, and up to his elbows in
damaged dates, driving a roaring trade. What was there
about Barnet Fair that could attract our hard-working
greengrocer so powerfully ?
<p>I was still puzzling over this problem when I reached
the main road (the Holloway Road, which is the direct
line to Barnet), and a glance revealed the fact that Tibbits
was but one of a thousand bound for the ancient battleground whereon, four hundred years ago, the great Earl
of Warwick was defeated and slain. The highway was
alive with Barnet fair-goers, and to a man they were of
the Tibbits sort; though, as a rule, and if appearances
might be trusted (and surely on such a day they might),
not nearly so well to do. Rattling down the road as it
<pb n="197" id="p.197">
presently did (with three on the cart-seat and the Windsor
chairs all occupied-four gentlemen and two ladies in all,
the former enjoying at once a " chaw" and a smoke out
of their cheroots, and with dahlias decorating the breast
button-holes of their velveteen coats), Mr. T.'s equipage
outshone by many degrees the generality, which were
costermongerish in the extreme. Donkey carts and
donkeys were decidedly the majority; handbarrows with
elongated handles to attach a quadruped between, and
burdened with four and even six hulking men and
women, to say nothing of the big stone bottle and the
bushel-basketful of victuals. Donkey drays, "half-carts," " shallows," and every other sort of vehicular
device peculiar to costermongery, had its representative,
drawn by every known shape in equine nature-donkeys
fat, and sleek, and prizeworthy, and donkeys spavined,
lame, and chapfallen, and looking as though they had
been stabled in a damp cellar till mildew had seized on
their hides; ponies, fast-trotters, glossy-coated, long-tailed, and frisky, and poor wizened things with that
haggard, careworn expression which is the old, ill-used
pony's peculiarity; young fiery horses, which were hard
to hold in, and splay-legged, Roman-nosed, ancient
brutes, which were hard to hold up; "kickers,"
"roarers," " jibbers;" vixens of fierce blood, and who
could do anything but behave themselves, and meek,
languid, washed-out horses, with drooping ears, drooping
eyes, drooping everything, too deeply settled in melancholy to be stirred by whipcord, and who swung one leg
before the other like clockwork horses wound up to their
best, and never blinked an eye, let their drivers batter
their ribs how they might, and curse and swear in a
way calculated to startle them, if anything would. So
that, taken as a whole, the road presented a very lively
picture; and people said it was many years since there
had been such a "Barnet," and generally attributed the
improvement to the abolition of turnpikes. Why should
not I go to Barnet Fair ? True, I had no fast trotter and
light-springed cart, nor even a donkey and barrow; but
the railway was close at hand, and for an insignificant
198 Unsentimental Journeys; or,
sum I might, in a very few minutes, be translated quietly
at my ease to the coveted spot.
<p>I went, and arrived there about noon. My first impression was my last, and still remains-viz., that Barnet
Fair is a disgrace to civilisation. I have witnessed a
Warwickshire "mop " fair; I have some recollection of
"Bartlemy; " I was at Greenwich when, on account of
its increasing abominations, the fair that so long afflicted
that Kentish borough was held for the last time; but
take all these, and skim them for their scum and precipitate them for their dregs, and even then, unless you
throw in a very strong flavouring of the essence of Old
Smithfield on a Friday, and a good armful of Colney
Hatch and Earlswood sprigs, you will fail to make a
brew equal to that of Barnet. It is appalling. Whichever way you turn-to the High Street, where the public-houses are-to the open, where the horse-" dealing" is
in progress-to the booths, and tents, and stalls-brutality, drunkenness, or brazen rascality, stare you in the
face unwinkingly. Plague-spots thought to be long ago
"put down" by the law and obliterated from among the
people, here appear bright and vigorous as of old-card-sharpers, dice-sharpers, manipulators of the " little pea,"
and gentlemen adept at the simple little game known as
"prick the garter." Wheels-of-fortune and other gaming-tables obstructed the paths. "Rooge-it-nor, genelmen;
a French game, genelmen; just brought over; one can
play as well as forty, and forty as well as one. Pop it
down, genelmen, on the black or on the red, and, whatever the amount, it will be instantly kivered! Faint
heart never won fair lady, so pop it down while the injicator is rewolving! Red wins, and four half-crowns to
you, sir; keep horf our gold is all we ask; our silver we
don't wally! " Not in a hole-and-corner way this, but
bold and loud-mouthed as goods hawked by a licensed
hawker.
<p>Disgusting brutality, too, had its representatives in
dozens. There were the tents of the pugilists, where, for
the small charge of twopence, might be seen the edifying
spectacle of one man bruising and battering another;
<pb n="199" id="p.199">
there was the booth of the showman who amused the
public by lying on his back and allowing three half-hundredweights to be stacked on the bridge of his nose;
there was the gentleman who put leaden pellets in his
eyes, and drove rows of pins at a blow into a fleshy part
of his leg; and there was a lean and horrible savage (a
"Chicksaw," the showman said he was, "from the island
of High Barbaree ") who ate live rats. Decidedly, this
was the show of the fair. An iron-wire cage, containing
thirty or forty rats, hung at the door, and beside it stood
the High Barbarian, grinning, and pointing at the rats,
and smacking his blubberous lips significantly. The
sight was more than the people could stand; they rushed
and scrambled up the steps, paying their pennies with
the utmost cheerfulness; and, when the place was full,
the performance was gone through to their entire satisfaction. The High Barbarian really did eat the rats.
He set the cage before him, and, thrusting in his hand,
stirred the animals about till he found one to his liking,
then he ate it as one would eat an apple.
<p>It was among the horses, however, where the chief
business was doing, as may be easily understood when it
is remembered that fully nine-tenths of the thousands
that swarm the town and the fair-ground have in view
the sale, or purchase, or "swop" of a horse, mule, or
donkey. Go to the horse market in Copenhagen Fields
any Friday, and it will be found that the chief difficulty
the market officers encounter in the exercise of their duty
consists in the presence of a score or so of donkey-dealing
ruffians, who set law and order at defiance; a slangy,
low-browed. bull-necked, county-cropped, spindle-legged,
lantern-jawedbig-chinned, long-waisted, tight-breeched
crew, lithe and muscular, carrying a thick ash stick with
a spike at the end of it, and utterly refusing to be " regulated." Let the reader imagine such a crew, multiplied
a hundredfold at the very least, and sprinkle amongst
them a few butchers, a few soldiers, and more than a few
blowsy, flashily-dressed costermonger women, and a
hundred or so decent-looking folk who have come innocently to Barnet to buy a horse; make a mob of these,
<pb n="200" id="p.200">
and distribute amongst it all the riff-raff and rubbish in
the way of horse and donkey flesh to be found within
twenty miles of London, and a feeble realisation of the
picture presented at the end of the High Street, looking
into the space where the horse fair is held, will be the
result. Some such scene as this is presented to the eye;
but who shall describe the bedlam Babel of sound that
arises from the busy, ever-shifting, motley mob ? Fifty
negotiations towards a sale are taking place at one and
the same time, each one accompanied by an amount of
yelling, and bellowing, and whip-slashing, and whistling
which must have been pleasant to the ears of the " Chick-saw" rat-eater, as reminding him of the habits and
customs of his tribe. Such a thing as a "quiet sale" is
unknown at Barnet. The big-chinned one, with the
battered white hat and the thongless whip, suddenly perceives a timid person of milkmanish mould furtively eyeing
a gaunt, wall-eyed quadruped which he (the big-chinned
one) has for sale. Instantly he slips the brute's halter
from the post, and, vaulting on his back, proceeds to
execute several daring feats of horsemanship, not the
least of which is dashing amongst the crowd, which is quite
unprepared for the manoeuvre. A dozen of the horse-dealer's friends are on the alert and strenuously exert
themselves to bring out the "points" of the animal for
the milkman's inspection; they shriek, they make hideous
whistlings on their fingers, they clap their hands, they
take off their hats and drum frantically on the inside with
the butt-ends of their whips; and, when the intended
purchaser is supposed to have arrived at a proper appreciation of the animal's valuable qualities, his rider dismounts as abruptly as he mounted, and, leading the
panting steed up to the milkman, ejaculates, "Four pun'
ten !" Should the milkman buy, you cannot miss the
fact. " Hoi, hoi! sold again! sold again !" is roared by
the partisans of the wall-eyed one's late owner, who
immediately crowd around him to receive the reward of
their meritorious exertions.</div1>
<pb n="201" id="p.201"><div1 type="chapter"><head>XXVI.
ON SATURDAY NIGHT.I.-THE "NAVVY."</>
<p>LOOKING over the palings that skirted the
temporary wooden bridge which crossed the
"cutting," and along the cutting as far as it
had as yet eaten into the hill, the sight presented was not a little curious and interesting.
Within a space of a hundred and twenty yards two hundred and thirty stalwart navvies were high busy. Four
hundred and sixty arms, brown, hairy, and muscular,
were pulling and hauling, and delving and picking, as
though the hill they were assaulting were the domain of
the avaricious Thomas Tiddler, and every man was determined on having just a little bit more before Tom
came raging at them from round the corner. Here, a
dozen shining "picks " attacked a great mass of earth,
which had been tumbled entirely from above; there, six
daring giants were furiously undermining an overhanging
piece of prodigious size, with a backward step, however,
and a sharp, upward glance, after every malicious dig,
lest the enemy should unexpectedly be down on them.
On the sloping bank on each side a hundred spades were
bobbing up and down at a tremendous rate, and as many
weighty clods perpetually flying through the air in their
passage to the "mook" trucks, while now and then
came the sharp and sudden cry of "look oop !" followed
by the dull crash of an earth mass as big as a labourer's
cottage, "crowed" down by the " surface men," whose
business it is to second the efforts of the underminers.
<pb n="202" id="p.202">
Take all this, together with the fantastic costumes of the
spaders and pickers-red smocks, blue smocks, white smocks,
and no smocks at all, but bare brown arms and chests
hairy as the back of a terrier; caps of the woollen "night"
sort-green, pink, and yellow, or elaborately barred and
spotted with these colours and some others; hairy caps,
made of the hide of the cow, the bear, and the badger;
tarpaulin and shiny oilskin caps and caps of cloth, worn
peak astern invariably-all these various shapes and
colours, ever shifting and dodging to and fro, backed by
the blue-black clay of the hill, with the engine tearing,
and rattling, and whistling, and screaming, and lugging
off trucks full laden, or bowling along jauntily over the
smooth rails with a seemingly endless tail of "empties "
-went to make the curious picture that I saw looking
into the railway cutting just as the sober October Saturday afternoon was fading.
<p>Suddenly was heard the clang-clang of a bell, and its
effect on the diggers was magical. Was it Tom Tiddler's
bell carried and rang by that gentleman himself to warn
them of his vengeful coming ? For the moment it seemed
so, for the host of pickers, and shovellers, and crowbar-wielders at once abruptly-as though they worked by gas
power and some one had turned them off at the main-ceased from their labours. They, however, made no
attempt to escape. With a deliberation that contrasted
strangely with their almost wrathful energy of a minute
before, they proceeded to scrape their cloddy boot soles
on their shovel blades, tidily scraping the upper leathers
clean with a bit of slate. Then they loosened their leather
harness-to wit, the straps that preserved the hitch of
their trousers above their mighty calves and the broad
brass-buckled belt by which their loins were begirt.
Then they shook themselves, and with their woollen caps
or the tails of their smocks wiped the moisture from their
brows, and from the nape of their necks, and from the
great bumps in the rear of their ears, where it seemed
specially prone to accumulate. By this time the engine,
brought to a standstill in their midst, and seeming to
regard these preparations for "knocking off" with its
 <pb n="203" id="p.203">
great goggle-eyes full of astonishment, arrived at the
conviction that its services were no longer required, and,
with a prodigious grunt of contempt for such puny and
easily-tired things as navvies, scuttled off, while the diggers, with their rush baskets in their hands and their tin
cans clinking against their shouldered picks and shovels,
strolled away towards a wooden shanty standing in an
adjoining field, and the " cutting," just now busy as a
beehive, was silent and deserted.
<p>It was from the shanty in the field that the bellringing
had arisen. It was Thomas Tiddler's erection. So far
from being offended at the big-limbed navvies for coming
to pick up gold and silver off his estate at the rate of
four shillings and twopence a day, he encouraged them,
and had been at the expense of rearing this wooden
building, and cutting a hole in one side of it through
which each man might receive his share of the gold and
silver decently and without unseemly scrambling. The
business of disbursing two hundred and thirty separate
sums of five-and-twenty shillings, taken at its simplest,
would appear to any one uninitiated in Mr. Tiddler's
methodical ways a rather formidable undertaking; but
taken in connection with the endless complications to
which each five-and-twenty shillings is liable-"quarters,"
and hours, and even half hours lost, picks broke, and
new shovels supplied, with fines for this, that, and the
other, the task becomes appalling. Under Mr. Tiddler's
system, however, all difficulties are smoothed away, and
the business of paying is rendered easier by far even
than giving each man two sixpences for a shilling. Every
man is provided with a tin ticket, which bears a number
corresponding with a similar one put against his name
in the time and pay books. On Saturday the navvy gives
in this ticket inclosed in a little canvas bag, highly
branded with the number. In the course of the day, and
undisturbed in his little office, the pay clerk makes up
the account, and his assistant pops the proper sum into
each bag and secures it with its string. Come pay time,
the navvy army troops past the pay-hole, and as the
clerk calls out the number the bag is deposited on a ledge
<pb n="204" id="p.204">
and is taken up by the owner. The tin ticket also serves
another purpose. If his work is satisfactory, the navvy
finds the ticket in the bag along with his money; if,
however, his services are no longer required, the ticket
is retained, and the navvy trudges off for good and all.
I knew all this beforehand, and idle curiosity led me to
loiter on the little wooden bridge over which the navvies
must one and all pass, with the view of exercising my
sagacity towards discovering the ticketless ones, and
observing how the calamity affected them; but they came
trooping past, every countenance beaming with serenity
and that consciousness of power which the possession of
wealth invariably confers, till I began to fear that my
sagacity was at fault, scarcely daring to hope otherwise.
Presently, however, there came two, both unmistakably
doomed to the "sack," which they carried between
them with much more fortitude than might have been
expected.
<p>"I don't fret, never fear," said one, "I knowed what
was coming since that heavenly ganger, bless his precious
eyes, jacketed me on Thursday."
<p>"Fret! Not much to fret about," replied his companion of the sack. " Why, afflict me with blindness if
I hav'nt worked harder in one beatific fortnight in that
beatific cutting than I worked in three solid months
on the main shore. Come along; I shall be a pot to
your pot."
<p>"Where shall we go ?"
<p>"Oh ! to the old drum, I suppose."
Just then, and as the two sacked ones halted to strike
a pipelight against the pailings, three other navvies
passed, and, bawling after them, the one who had endured the beatific fortnight exclaimed-
<p>"What cheer, Harry? See yer bimeby ?"
<p>"Ay, ay, lad. We'll be up at the old drum, I reckon."
<p>Where was the old drum ? I was tolerably well acquainted with the signs of the taverns of the locality;
but of one known as the "Old Drum" I had not hitherto
heard. Clearly it was a place where navvies spent
their Saturday evenings, and must be worthy of a visit.
<pb n="205" id="p.205">
<p>The British navvy is no ordinary individual. He is not
a mere dirt-shoveller. He is a skilled workman in his
way, and he is paid as good wages as a journeyman
watch-maker; he is a model of strength and physical
endurance; he works harmoniously with his fellow-men,
and is altogether a most cheerful and hearty fellow. How
does he employ his leisure ? What are his means of
recreation and enjoyment? Wherever met he would
be recognised; for the bare suggestion that he might
disguise himself in a black coat, confine his hairy chest
beneath a dandy waistcoat, or encompass his great throat
by an all-round collar and a fashionable tie, is too absurd
to be entertained for a single instant; yet, whoever saw
the navvy at a theatre, a music-hall, or working-man's
institute? Perhaps he is superior to the two former
frivolities, and has no taste for the calm delights the
latter provides. Doubtless the "Old Drum" was the
navvies' clubhouse, the institution to which he, eschewing
all others, resorted, seeking the society of his brother
giants, and passing the evening with them in pleasant
and intelligent discourse, or disporting himself in such
manly amusements as the establishment provided, thereby keeping his muscles in fine working condition. Musing
thus, I quitted the bridge and followed my two Drumward-bound friends, my esteem for the British navvy increasing
each moment, and I resolved as I walked that if persuasion, or even the payment of a moderate fee, could
gain me admittance to the " Old Drum," I would that
evening make myself better acquainted with the navvy
and his ways.
<p>Down the lane and into the High Street, past the
"<placeName>Red Cow</>" and the "<placeName>Load of Hay</>;" past even the
newly-opened beershop, with its doors wide open and the
spick-and-span pots ranged on the counter, and winking
most invitingly in the gaslight; past all these, and then
a halt at a porkshop, which one of my navvies enters and
bargains for a couple of pounds or so of cold boiled leg,
while his mate makes a purchase of a four-pound loaf at
a neighbouring baker's; and then on again the pair of
them, the bread-carrier munching the makeweight piece
<pb n="206" id="p.206">

as he goes. On, past that skulking, dirty pothouse, the
<p>"Balaclava "---
<p>No, not past the "Balaclava," but into it. Can this
be the "Old Drum ?" Surely not. But yet, as I linger
doubtingly, navvies in twos and threes push their way
into the house with a purposeful air; and presently, as I
get a fair view of the interior, I spy the two who have
"got the sack" quite at home on a barrel, with the
bread and pork between them, and which they are attacking with the calm confidence of men sure of victory. At
the extremity of the bar there is a door, and navvy after
navvy enters at it and does not make his appearance
again; and as I wait and watch, the identical three, with
Harry amongst them-whom one of the pork-eaters had
asked, "What cheer?" on the bridge-turn in deliberately, and make straight for theinner door justmentioned.
It seemed that my speculations as to what sort of institution the " Old Drum " was, were a little wide of the
mark; nevertheless, it undoubtedly was the Old Drum
that I had come in search of, and to turn back was not
to be thought of.
<p>The door at the extremity of the bar opened into a
largish room furnished with three great tables and a full
complement of forms. The floor was bare, as were the
yellow-washed walls, as was the ceiling, save for the
coating of gas and tobacco-smoke that begrimed it.
There was a fireplace with no fire in it, though the evening was chilly. The room was capable of containing
fifty or sixty individuals, but at present there were not
more than fifteen assembled. On the tables were fifteen
quart pots, and fifteen foul tobacco pipes sent forth a
blast that made the little ventilator in the corner by the
ceiling spin round with a whir like that of a knife-grinder's wheel. As my sauntering costume is of humble
sort-consisting, indeed, of an old black wideawake and
a coat that was new in the autumn of '61-my entrance
provoked nothing beyond fifteen momentary stares,
and provided an excuse for fifteen pulls at the beer-pots.
This, however, was not my immediate conviction; for
so dead a silence pervaded the company as I took my
<pb n="207" id="p.207">
seat as to give me an uncomfortable impression that I
was intruding, and should presently be addressed as I
once was under somewhat similar circumstances. "Well,
do you see anybody here as you wants?" "No." "Do
you see anybody here as looks as though he wanted
you ?" "I cannot say that I do." "Wery well, then."
Nothing so unpleasant happened, however, on the present
occasion; and, after the lapse of a minute or so, I
was put quite at my ease by two of the party breaking
into conversation.
<p>"How they things do hum "
<p>"They do so."
<p>"Wentilator, ain't it ?"
<p>"Ah, summat o' that."
<p>Certainly this was not much, but it was very much
better than nothing, as showing that my presence was no
check on their freedom of speech. For the next two
minutes the "wentilator" had it all to itself, when,
happily, the entrance of three other navvies, each
carrying his own quart, provided material for fresh
discourse.
<p>"Hallo, here's Dick Found your dawg, Dick ?'
<p>"Bust him, no!"
<p>"That warn't the one, then, as that chap told you of? "
<p>"No, it worn't. Shove up further."
And the parties addressed having "shoved up further,"
and allowed the new comers a seat on their form, silence
reigned once again, and was only disturbed during the
next few minutes by the puffing of tobacco, the sound of
sighs that followed breath-exhausting draughts of beer,
and the click of the replaced pot on the table. Surely it
cannot go on like this, thought I. It's the way with
these big men; they are hard to move, but, once started,
there is no stopping them. A little more beer will float
them, and then we shall have social, scientific, and
political discussion in any quantity. But the door swung
to and fro, and the company increased to the number of
twenty-five, and at least a dozen pots had been replenished, and still the ventilator had the best of it-ten to one,
at least. Lord Palmerston's name had not been once
<pb n="208" id="p.208">

mentioned, " universal suffrage " was not even hinted at,
the American war news was equally neglected; and even
when Franz Muller was brought to table by the speculative observation of "I wonder if it really was that
chap as did it ? " no other reply was elicited beyond one
of "If as how he did, I hope they'll scrag him;" and
then the subject dropped.
<p>More beer. There was no bell in the room, but the
company contrived very well to make the landlord alive
to their wants by banging the empty pots on the tables,
and continuing to bang them till he made his appearance.
By the time every man had drank at least three pots the
general speech became freer-freer, but not free, inasmuch as it was restricted to a topic with which they were
all well acquainted-viz., beer; about betting pots of
beer, and winning them, and losing them, and drinking
them; about drinking seven pots within the hour, with
the story of a sawyer who had won just such wager in
such bare time that he staggered down dead with the last
pot in his hand, and the dregs trickling from it. It was,
as far as I could make out, about these dregs that the
dispute arose; the widow claiming the stakes, and the
other party taking his stand on the unswallowed driblet
to resist the claim. About good beer and bad beer, one
gentleman, in a bison skin cap, stoutly maintaining that
there was no such thing as " bad" beer; one sort might
be better than another, but bad beer there was none-an
argument that was rapturously received, and led to universal swigging and further furious banging on the tables
with exhausted measures. More beer and increased freedom of speech. Some talk about the goodness of the
cabbage and its frightfully high price; an argument as
to the number of miles it was from Yarmouth to Norwich; an animated discussion concerning the comparative
merits of "toe-plates" and "clinkers;" about boots
generally and the use of dubbing; about a kicking case
in which a certain navvy had mortally injured a policeman, and was then lying in gaol awaiting his trial; considering a prisoner's deprivation of beer; on the delights
of a drayman's life. More beer. Some high words and
<pb n="209" id="p.209">
a trifling pass of fisticuffs between Dick and the person
who had misinformed him about his "dawg." Conversation about dogs-about rats-about drains and drainpipes-about cutty-pipes and "colouring" clays-about
soaking one's clay. Tremendous laughter, and more
beer.
<p>Clearly, there was no use in staying any longer. It
was nearly eleven o'clock, and everybody was perfectly
jolly and cotented. What they had come to the "Old
Drum " to seek they had found, and were now at the
heart of it. On the whole, the navvy has disappointed
me. Judging him from his manner of spending his
Saturday night, I would rather be a little lame tailor,
with some brain in my skull, than such a big blockhead.</div1><pb n="210" id="p.210">
<div1 type="chapter"><head>XXVII.
ON SATURDAY NIGHT.
II.-POOR MOTHER!</>
<p>MY meeting with poor mother was accidental.
It was Saturday night, and I was coming
from Highgate. As I came up with her just
as I could guess it, it was half-past eight, and so I told
her. "Heart alive of me, you don't say so ! I'm much
obliged to you, I'm sure! " replied she, and then she
mended her pace so resolutely that, had I not mended
mine also, she would have been ahead and out of sight in
the dark in a very little while. The reason why I mended
my pace was this: it had been a dull and. threatening
evening, and within the last few minutes rain had set in
and was falling faster and faster. Though not fashionably
attired, the female who had asked what o'clock it was, was
decent and respectable looking, and I resolved to offer her
a share of my umbrella.
<p>"I don't know how far we may be going the same
way, ma'am; but as far as that may be you are very
welcome to the shelter of my umbrella, if you like to
accept it."
<p>"Thank you kindly, sir," replied she. "I'm going
all the way to the Lower Road, worse luck ! and if you
would have no objection to this little basket, it would be
a real favour. I'm neither sugar nor salt, as the saying
is. But to tell you the truth, young man, not expecting
a fall of anything, when I set out I put on my best

<pb n="211" id="p.211">
bonnet; and if it gets sopped, and the green runs into the
straw, I should never forgive myself. Not that finery
troubles me only it looks so not to have a decent rag to
come out ill."
<p>I certainly was not aware of the basket when I made
her the offer, but though of the ordinary family marketing sort, it was not full-sized, and the lappets of her
shawl nearly covered it. So I assured her that I had not
the least objection to the basket, and that it only gave
me concern lest it should be fatiguingly heavy.
<p>"There's nothing at all in it, barring the basin for
my butter," replied she, pleasantly.
<p>"But you don't mean to say, ma'am, that you come
all the way from the Lower Road to Highgate to fetch
butter ?" I asked.
<p>"Lord love the man! no," replied my free-spoken,
little old woman. "It's nothing to carry, and, by bringing it with me, I am able to do my errands at once, for
if there is one thing I don't like more than another, it
is running in and out like a dog in a fair on Saturday
night. Where there's eight of 'em, as is the case with
me, sir, and three only able to wash themselves, and
they not always willing, and requiring to be looked after
with the eyes of a hawk, there's enough to do without
running about the streets half the night."
Seeing that I was expected to say something, I remarked "that doubtless a family of eight was a heavy
responsibility."
<p>"Eight Why, there are eleven, and that's speaking
only of those alive," replied the chatty old soul, proudly.
<p>"I've got a boy and a gal married, and a third that, so
she says, has reasons to be in expectation of it. That's
the one that I've been to up the hill with her frock and
things to-night."
<p>"What, her wedding frock ?" I asked.
<p>"Bless the man! no; her starched lilock. Catch her
being married in a lilock. She's got too much of her
sister Ellen about her for that, though it is to be hoped
she'll know better how to take care of it if ever she has
the same luck. So her father told her the last time she
<pb n="212" id="p.212">

came out for a holiday with lavender kid gloves on her
hands, above all things. ' You'll bring your noble nine-pence to nothing, Mary Ann, if you don't watch it pretty
close,' said he. ' Work away while you're able, as the
little hymn says; you'd better have saved your money
and put something on your back, miss.' But it's like
talking to a post-in at one ear and out at the other.
Not that she's at all a bad girl. Six in family to cook
for, and two in a perambulator between dinner and tea
invariably when it is the least fine, Highgate Hill being
not the smallest of hills to push it up and down, and both
of them so fat that their legs bow under them, is no joke
at seven pounds a year, and her washing and ironing
done at home. It's horse work, that's what I call it.
I made the remark only this night in her kitchen, which
-I will give her her due-is so clean that you might
freely take your dinner off the floor boards, and you can
see yourself in her tins, even to her cullinder. ' Mary
Ann,' said I, 'are you aware that this makes three pair
of boots as good as new, besides the kid and spring sides
that Ellen gave you, in a single quarter ?' ' Well, I can't
help it,' said she; ' you shouldn't have got me a place
in such a gravelly part.' ' Well, gravelly or not gravelly,
Mary Ann, your father declares that the next pair shall
be all leather in the uppers, and with tips and sparrow-bills.' Not that he would be seen doing such a thing, for
a better father and one prouder of his gals never stept."
I don't mean to assert that my little old woman spoke
at this length without pause or interruption; but, as my
share in the conversation was limited almost entirely to
such common-place interjections as " Oh ! " "Exactly ! "
and "Indeed!" I have not thought it worth while to
record them. Now, however, that an opportunity presented itself, I thought I might venture to say a good
word for the damsel of gravelly ways.
<p>"There's one consideration, however, ma'am; if the
young person of whom you speak is of no assistance to
you, she has ceased to be a hindrance," said I.
<p>"Boots, boots; nothing but boots," continued she,
heedless of my observation, and evidently taking up the
<pb n="213" id="p.213">
thread of her discourse where she had let it fall slack,
"it's just the bit of victuals, and the rent, and the boots,
and there you are. I'm sure it's a mercy that their father
has a regular seat of work, and is not in and out all his
life, like many others in the tailoring trade. To be sure,
it's piece, and therefore not so brisk sometimes as at
others; but you might set it down all the year round at
a pound, anyhow, which is not so bad in the slop times
we live ill."
<p>"But surely a pound a week is not the whole of your
income," said I, " you have other sources of assistance."
<p>"Sources of---"
<p>"Ay! Amongst the eight at home are there none big
enough to work ? Have you no boys ?"
<p>"Two boys; but only one that sauces," replied poor
mother; " the other one, Bill, is as civil a lad as you'll
find in a day's walk. He's getting a big boy now-much
too big for four-and-sixpence and just the slop of tea in
the evening, finding his own bread and butter, and walking his legs off with that millinery fly-cage thing chafing
holes in the shoulders of his Sunday jacket, because he
must go respectable, bless your soul! and a clean shirt
three times a week. Believe me, sir, I'd as lief he left
as stayed. Two shillings and ninepence for foreparting
and bits on the heels only last week, and this week
leaking again in a manner that went to your heart
when he came home to see his poor sopped feet. 'Why
you'd better be a coal-boy, Bill,' said I, 'or work up
there at the wood-chopper's, than be such a whitened
sepulchre as you are-genteel, and with fancy caps and
falderals in your basket, and all the while tired as any
dog, and with the heels all ground out of those new
worsted stockings.' ' You let me alone, mother,' is the
answer he makes. I ain't a fool, I don't have my tea
in the same room where the machines are working for
nothing. Just you stay till I get an insight; then I'll
talk to him.' So he put on his brother's, while I took
his back and told the nasty, cheating fellow what I
thought of him. ' However you could sit there and take
a poor soul's two-end-ninepence,' said I, 'well knowing
<pb n="214" id="p.214">

that the leather you put was not thicker than brown
paper, and the stitches you might draw out with your
teeth, gets over me.' And there they are, coming to
fifteenpence ever since Thursday; and that idle riff-raff
about the house like a great monkey, and shoeless; and
ours, the most particular of landlords, looking over the
wall and seeing the shelf of the kitchen cupboard in the
act of being sawn up for a rabbit-hutch; and it was
only his presence of mind in calling it a meat-safe, and
pleading dampness of the kitchen shelf as regards victuals
as an excuse for the alteration, that saved a fine row.
Ah ! he's a dear boy. He's a blue hen's chick, if ever
a poor soul was troubled with one."
It was somewhat difficult to follow my little old
woman. The "blue hen's chick," and "the riff-raff,"
and " the great monkey and shoeless," were, I presumed,
identical. To make quite sure, however, I made the
remark that it was a great shame, and that he was old
enough to do better.
<p>"Old enough ? why, let me see, sir-why, let me see,
that boy was three years old in January as the first Exhibition was opened in May, because I remember making
the remark that if the Exhibition had been opened just
three months to the day earlier, itwould have come on Jack's
birthday. Pollyis eighteen, and yes-no, therewas nobody
between Polly and Jack, which makes him sixteen come
the time. That makes Bill fourteen in August, of course.
And the difference between the brothers! The number
of places that eldest one has had is past all belief. Not
a bad boy in the main, you see, sir, but such a spirit.
I'm sure his last place but two was as comfortable a place
as any boy could wish. That was at the fishmonger's
near the Post Office, as you may perhaps know, sir ?
Well, John, he wanted Easter Monday, which, very
naturally, wasn't convenient, and, instead, they set him
cleaning fish, there being a great supper somewhere.
Well, sir, there was nine pounds of fine eels in a tub
standing on the edge of the sink, and what did the rascal
do before he went to his dinner but take up the trap out
of the waste-pipe and tilt the tub on its side, thereby

<pb n="215" id="p.215">
getting the sack on the spot, besides choking the drainage, and costing us, from first to last, seven-and-twenty
shillings."
<p>"That prank cost him something as well, I should
imagine," said I; "a few sore bones, eh ?"
<p>"Lor bless you, no! " replied the confiding old soul;
"we daren't touch him, because, you see, my dear sir;
he's all for the sea. Why, when that boy was only ten
years old, and he lived up here at Crummles's, the confectioner's, and got turned away for some missing sausage-
rolls, he never came home, though the rumpus was in
the morning. Eight o'clock at night, nine o'clock, still
no Jack; and then, come ten, his father went down;
and, behold you! there were the shutters up, and the
girl going for the beer. So he crossed over to her, and
then it came out. You can put them on to fry while I
am gone,' says he, when he went out; but they might as
well have laid raw in the cupboard for all a mouthful of
it that was touched that night; and so you would have
said had you seen his face when he came back and told
me. Ellen and her beau were there at the time, which
accounted for the lamb chops for supper, and Sheffield
himself, who, though in a large way as a haberdasher,
has no more pride about him than you or me, at once got
up and put on his great coat, and out they went, hunting
high and low to find him till a quarter to one o'clock,
when home they came, empty handed. Never shall I
forget that night, and how I paced the room thinking of
a thousand things, and suicide being the idea uppermost;
so that it was only on Sheffield's solemn promise of the
drags as soon as daylight that I could be persuaded to lie
down. Well, sir; and what was the upshot? Why, at
twenty minutes past eight, and just as we had all set
down to a wretched breakfast, a knock came at the door
that sent all our hearts into our mouths, and, lo and
behold you! master Jack. Not downcast and with his
eyes swelled out of his head with crying, as you might
have expected, but bold as brass, and dressed in a blue
guernsey and a blue cloth cap with anchor buttons, which
he had sold his good jacket and the boots off his feet to
buy. There he stood on the mat, before quite a passage
<pb n="216" id="p.216">
full of us, holding on to the door-knob, and saying it
wasn't worth while coming in any further, as he had
merely come to bid us good-bye; and it was only when
he was begged and entreated into the parlour, and I had
got him to swallow a cup of tea and to eat a bit or two of
toast, that he up and confessed that he had firmly made
up his mind to sail all round the world; that he was a
bad boy, and didn't think it likely that he should ever be
better; and that he thought the best thing would be to
cast himself on some desolate island out Australia way.
You laugh, sir! Well, Sheffield, he laughed, till we
came to search his pockets and found a jack-knife with a
bit of string through the handle, and some filthy black
tobacco for chewing, and a bit of Indian ink and a needle,
ready to dot the anchor on his arm; and then we found
that it was no laughing matter. ' If he's bent on it, let
him go,' Sheffield said. But, as I remarked at the time,
when you come to have them of your own, my good sir,
you will alter your tune.' No seafaring boys for me,
thank you. Lor bless us, no! I should get the creeps,
and so would his father, every time the wind blew. Who
he takes after is a puzzle to us, except it is his godfather,
that we called up from his boats at Lambeth Stairs and
got to stand at his christening at the old church for a
shilling. So it is, anyhow; and to this very day he's as
strong after the sea as ever. Just put him out in the
least, or ask him to clean so much as a window or a knife
and fork when it don't suit him, and he flies in a passion,
and these are the first words out of his mouth, 'I aint a
goin' to stand this. Give me my cap, and I'll go at once
and get a ship.' Bless you, you can't think how careful
we are obliged to be."
<p>"Well, you'll pardon my saying so," I ventured to
remark; " but, from what you have told me of your son
John, I think that Mr. Sheffield was quite right when he
said, ' If he's bent on going, let him go.' If I were his
father, the next time he demanded his cap he should not
be kept waiting for it."
<p>"As a stranger, no doubt you would, sir, but when
he is known as well as we know him, he is not at all a
hard boy to manage. Only give him a good word and
<pb n="
217" id="p.217">
he'll turn the mangle like a lamb, or fill your tubs, or
help Louisa home with the clean linen, without so much
as a wry face. His savagest times are when he doesn't
get his victuals to the minute. That's where Mary Ann
puts me out so on Saturday night. I feel it my duty to
see her once a week, and there goes two or three hours
out of the worst night in the whole week. How do I
make it out to be the worst night ? Oh, my good sir, it
is not me that makes it the worst; it is the flock I've got
to struggle with. Life is but a span' I hear sometimes
at chapel, on Sunday nights. I don't know what the
correct measurement of a span may be, but to my mind
it is a week. It is a sinful thing to say; but what's my
life but a week ? I begin it on Monday morning, and I
finish up on Saturday night. It's like the judgment day;
there it is at the end of the long lane that's got no turning, blocking it up so that you can't get a peep beyond it.
The bit of money you get, counting even Bill's four-and-sixpence, and the trifle of money one can earn at nine-pence a dozen, and those chiefly sheets, as I assure you,
and large things that wring your arms off, just carries
you through the lane, and not an inch to spare-not half
an inch-not even so much as an extra half pint of beer,
though standing in that cold wash-house till you felt like
standing in ice. It looks a lot-it certainly does look a
lot, when it's put altogether on the table on Saturday
night; but it's all laid out, as the saying is, before a
farthing is touched; and then there's grumbling and
black looks from Master John, who bought a sprigged
waistcoat while at the fishmonger's, and which naturally
went to make up the deficiency; and there it lays, eating
its head off with interest. And there it must lay-for tonight, at all events, let him look ever so black; for, believe me or believe me not, sir, by the time I've taken in
a bit of something for supper, and settled with the butcher,
and got what I want at Gawler's, and fetched Bill's boots,
if I've got eighteenpence more than will pay for the
baking to-morrow, I shall think myself lucky. Oh ! you
don't turn down here, sir? Well, good-night, young
gentleman, and thank you kindly for my part of the
umbrella."

TWO P.M.-ON BOARD "CITIZEN B.</>
<p>AS a promoter of brotherly love and kindly regard, and general jolly good-fellowship, there
is nothing like water. The poet who penned
that sweet and universally accepted line, "One
touch of nature makes the whole world kin,"
no doubt had water in his eye as he wrote. By " nature,"
he meant the aqueous element. It may be objected that
Shakspeare claims the homage of the "whole world"
for his panacea, and that at this point the water theory
breaks down, inasmuch as regards a large proportion of
the world's inhabitants there exists such a horror of the
"nature" in question that were they not only "touched"
with it, but drenched with it-soused in it-scrubbed
with it till they were nearly clean and totally wretched,
they would exhibit towards the operators no more goodwill than before; probably less, indeed; but the objectors
might be met by the suggestion, that the sentiment was
penned for Britons-for the inhabitants of the "world"
in which the poet lived, and with whose hearts' desires he
was so familiar.
Anyhow, if this is not a true rendering of the poet's
meaning, it well might be. Blood even is not so potent
as water. It maybe "thicker," but, as a cement for
broken brotherhood, is not for a moment to be compared
with simple aqua; for while blood is a stickler for caste
and degree, and so prompt to spill (alack for the empty
pitcher !) that the common herd may view and judge of
its quality, water not more infallibly finds its own level
than it levels such of mankind as trust themselves to

<pb n="219" id="p.219">
its jurisdiction. It may be proved in a dozen cases, great
and small. In the case of the sea, for instance. You
have but to touch the hem of its garment, even the
faggest hem, such as the beach at Brighton or Hastings,
and you are straight translated from your former self
as completely as though you had grasped the tail of an
electric eel. You discover that it is all a mistake about
Britannia ruling the waves; it is the waves that rule
Britannia. Your birthright of freedom-of freedom to
dress as you please, eat what you please, and go where
you please-no longer avails you. Born in the interior,
the sea knows you not, but, having entered her dominions,
you must do as the rest of the sea subjects. There is no
seat for pomp by the side of the sea, and vanity dare not
stretch its wings beyond the drawing-room windows of
the lodging-houses. No matter the terms for which you
enlist in the service of the sea, you must serve beneath
her banner faithfully. It is a brown banner, broad and
ample, but as plainly brown as a Quaker's coat. Its
shadow clothes you. It stirs the air and imparts to it
the balminess and fragrance which the cinnamon stick
imparts to the bowl of healing cordial, and as you quaff
it you are comforted. There is nothing on earth so nice.
Every one you meet says so, from their eyes, at least,
some being new to it, and twinklingly intoxicated, eager
as trouts on a rainy day, and rapturous as early sweethearts; others grown used to it, hummingly contented
as honey-bees, and beaming with brown beneficence to
the very roots of their hair.
<p>You are all alike, all brownly cheerful and sedately
happy; all with warm hearts and none with cold shoulders.
"But," says the reader, "it is possible to have too much
of the brown banner; there are times-times of dead
calm, when it doesn't stir the air in the least, but hangs
dull and wooden as its own staff." Dead calm, indeed!
Sleep is dead calm; so is snow covering the wheatfield;
so is sunset, and a hundred other things, which go to
make the ever new to-morrow. Dull! Eve, advised of a
worldly sensation from which she was debarred, found
the Garden of Eden dull. There came a season, however,
<pb n="220" id="p.220">
when she would have mightily rejoiced to have got back
again, as you, my friend, will rejoice to get back to the
humdrum brown banner, come the sultry autumn time.
On the sea, even more than by the side of it, is the
influence of the Leveller felt. On land there are grades
of sickness; there is "rich man's" gout and "poor
man's" gout; and often, for want of a guinea, a life is
hampered by a heartload of pain; but sickness born of
the sea is of but one quality-between the man in clouted
boots prostrate in the steerage, to the state cabin inhabitant burying his unhappy nose in the softness of the
dainty couch cushion, there is at most but the difference
of a twopenny pannikin.
<p>A great ship setting out to sea reckons, say, five hundred
lives aboard, the cabin-boy counting one and the commander one-not one and a quarter; no, nor a sixteenth;
though, come to share the prize-money, he is lumping
weight against any twenty men in the ship. He is great,
and his greatness continues by grace of the quiet sea till
there is an end to the voyage; but should the sea awake,
and, donning its foamy crown, take the command out of
the commander's hands, then blue serge is on a par with
scarlet and gold lace; and no wave of the great sea's
army will be so polite as it sweeps the troubled deck as
to avoid scarlet and gold that it may chase blue serge to
death. Should the wrecked ship go down, than the dead
level to which the cabin-boy, and the commander, and
Pompey the cook will fall, it is impossible to imagine
anything deader.
<p>From the Atlantic to the Thames, from H.M.S.
Vengeance, Commander Ajax, to Citizen B, Captain
W. Blinker, and we are aboard the Chelsea boat.
Citizen B starts from London Bridge, and calls at
all the piers up the river. It has called at Temple
Pier and taken up the clerkly young gentleman with
the blue bag and the third volume of the last sensation novel. I wonder who the heroine is? Is it a she
wolf in shape of a countess, according to the prevailing
fashion, or is she a garret-angel-a human sewing-machine-stitching herself into an early grave at the rate
<pb n="221" id="p.221">
of threepence-halfpenny a day ? If so, he cannot do
better than put aside his stupid book and look about him.
There, in the flesh, sits the heroine whom he so passionately adores in printer's type. True, she has not yet
arrived at that interesting stage when, "by the hectic
roses on her cheek and the light of brighter worlds in her
eye, insidious disease marks her for its own," so graphically described at page 430; but she is none the less
eligible to become his heart's idol on that account. Just
speak to her, and you'll find with what a sweet, bewitching voice she will answer; or, if you are bashful, as is
likely, or cautious-which, being in the " legal" line,
is still more likely-just for a moment cast your eyes
from your book-pretending to read all the time-and
observe with what tenderness she contemplates that
penny bunch of violets in the flower-girl's basket. Think
of the bliss, when you had married her, and made her
happy, and given her, instead of violets to smell, roses
to wear all the year round; think of the pleasure of
having such a pair of eyes to lovingly greet you when
you returned at eve from your musty office in Pump
Court; think of- But the young fellow thinks of
nothing of the kind. He gets out at Westminster, and
leaves the little needlewoman to cross over to Lambeth
-which completes her penny ride-anxiously debating
within her own mind whether she shall buy the violets
and walk back to London Bridge. Confound that young
fellow's sensation novel! But for that, the genius of
jolly good-fellowship, as represented by the river, might
have induced him to have treated the poor little maid to
a ride all the way to Kew and bought her a bunch of
flowers into the bargain.
<p>But the genius in question has prevailed with every
other soul on board Citizen B. The coalheaver is engaged
in friendly discourse with one who but a quarter of an
hour ago was a stranger. The young gentleman with
the puppy-dog hair and the young lady with the blue
parasol are discussing the dimensions of the "platform"
at Cremorne, whither they are bound. Even the man
at the wheel looks as though he was quite ready to set
<pb n="222" id="p.222">
the laws of his country at defiance, and to "speak" to
any one bold enough to begin a conversation. There
remains but the foreigner and the happy carpenter.
Ignorance of the language of those about him is the sole
and simple reason why the French gentleman is companionless; but observe how eloquent are his spectacles!
But the happy carpenter, he, too, is companionless.
Is he ! He ! he ! that's all you know about it! His wife
is down-stairs in the cabin. They are going to Kew.
It ain't often he loses half a day, but when he does he
likes to enjoy himself. Staying down in that stuffy cabin
isn't enjoyment. Stay ! " What do you say, Tomkins ?
(Tomkins is at this end of the boat; his wife is down in
the stuffy cabin along with the happy carpenter's wife).
Fresh breeze up here, my boy; blow some of the sawdust
out of a fellow. Jerooslem, Tomkins! there's a pair of
balmorals !"</div1><pb n="223" id="p.223">
<div1 type="chapter"><head>XXIX.
TEN P.M.-THE DANCING-SALOON.</>
<p>MAN is essentially a dancing animal. As a savage,
saltation is his chief delight. If he be a fierce,
head-hunting Dyak, he has his " skull" dance
and his "jawbone" dance, as well as many
dances of a peaceful sort, including the great
days of jigging which distinguish sowing and harvest
times. If the savage be a cleft-lipped, ring-nosed Malay,
he twiddles his lean shanks to the music of human marrowbones and cleavers; if a cannibal Fan of gorilla land,
his wife chants a lively ditty in praise of "long pig"
while he polks about the cooking-pot; if a Dahoman,
he dances for blood and rum (his Majesty the King leading the ball); while, should he happen to be a greased
and ochred Indian of North America-a Pawnee, or an
Iroquois, or an Ojibbeway-there is nothing under the
sun he will not dance for. He is at it morning, noon,
and night. He has a rain dance, and a sunshine dance,
and a famine dance, and a feast dance, and a dance for
the sun, and for the moon, and a score or so of the stars.
He dances when his baby is christened, and, should it
live to be a six-foot warrior and die before its father, the
old gentleman will foot it sorrowfully round and round
the mound under which his offspring lies buried. He
detaches the scalp from the head of an enemy and risks
reprisal that he may execute a triumphant double-shuffle
over the prostrate form of the victim, and he has a special
dance on the occasion of his shaking hands all round with
a hostile tribe and " burying the hatchet." He has-at
<pb n="224" id="p.224">


least, his brother the Dacota has-a very nasty dance
called " the dog-dance," in which boiled dog is hung to
a sort of maypole, and snapped at and demolished by
mouthfuls by the dancers, men and women, who join
hands in a merry-go-round, the dog's-meat pole in the
centre. Also, these people have a dance known as the
"poor-dance," which is a highly creditable institution.
It is for the benefit of the poor, and decrepit, and orphaned
of the tribe, and is conducted by the most renowned belles
and " swells" in the village. They choose a convenient
time, and spend an entire day in roaming from place to
place and exhibiting their skill as dancers, and jugglers,
and singers to an admiring public, and attended by a
couple of porters, one carrying the money-box, and the
other ready to burden himself with any " poors-gift" of
blanketing, or maize, or tobacco. Even that wretched
little pigmy the Australian Bushman occasionally breaks
the monotony of his existence, which, as a rule, is given
to three occupations-digging up and cooking roots and
earthworms, chastisinghis "gin" withhis waddy, andlying
on his back smoking tobacco-by engaging in the graceful " carroberry," the soft and delightful "kuri," or the
more vigorous and soul-inspiring " palyertatta," in which
the performers, in a simple suit of gum-leaves, congregate about the forest bonfire, leaping over it and through
it, at the same time brandishing their naked spears and
uttering the most appalling yells, while the women sit
in a circle a little way off, beating time with their hands,
and unanimously raising their voices in imitation of the
musical grunt of the red kangaroo. Civilisation is impotent to weed out this relic of barbarism. The King of
Dahomey dances, so does the Emperor of the French.
Mahtotoppa, the great chief of the Dacotas, danced on
the eve of his great victory over the Sacs and Foxes; the
Duke of Wellington danced on the eve of Waterloo. At
ten p.m. any time this week or next, could the reader see
from here to Old Kalabar, he would doubtless discover a
select party of Egbos performing saltation at the shrine
of a Fetish snake; and if, within the same hour, he took
the trouble to walk as far as <placeName>Bloomsbury</>, and looked in
<pb n="225" id="p.225">
at "<placeName>Widdles's Dancing Saloon</>," he would there find,
with some small differences, a repetition of the same performance.
<p>Small differences, indeed! In what particular, pray,
does the Old Kalabar heathen orgies resemble Widdles's?
What similitude-even the faintest-may be traced between Widdles's patrons and the grease-anointed, face-painted, copper-bangle-wearing Kalabese ? Is the likeness
of man to the gorilla less positive than the likeness of
young Mr. Brussels Prout (with the eyeglass) to a grinning, goggle-eyed native of Kalabar ? Is Widdles's M.C.
(a shirt-cutter by profession, and not depending for his
living on two-and-sixpence per night, be it borne in
mind) to be for a moment compared with a shock-headed,
ring-nosed savage ? Are Mr. Peascod and the master
cabinetmaker and his sister barbarians ? Is their cousin,
the outfitter's daughter from Aldgate, a likely person to
bow in worship to a Fetish snake ?
<p>Well, she is a very fine woman, and I beg ten times
ten thousand pardons if it happens that I am wrong; but
truly and sincerely, I do believe her to be addicted to
fetish worship. There is that in her eyes, in her hair, in
her general appearance and ornamentation, which betrays
her. Likewise I suspect Peascod-I suspect him chiefly
on account of his patent leathers and his teeth; while as
for his sister, she has worshipped the serpent till her hair
begins to fall off, and it has become necessary to sacrifice
the prettiest of pouts and to affect with her lips an expression of severity and determination she has not at all at
heart, by way of concealing the fact that her teeth are
failing her. Poor little Miss Peascod ! The devotion of
a lifetime-at least from maidenhood upwards-has in no
way softened the nature of the insatiable fetish snake
towards her; she has given it all her smiles; she has
exhausted the natural bloom of her cheeks in the monster's
service; she has suffered headache, heartache, and, for
its sake, borne with a cheerful countenance the agony
attendant on the possession of three corns (two hard and
one soft) palpitating in shoes two sizes too small for her.
She has expended the trifle of pin-money her brother

<pb n="226" id="p.226">
allows her for keeping house for him in sashes, and bows,
and jewels, and gigumboles, that she might not discredit
the monster. This evening she has brought the devouring dragon flowers, and for his delectation she sports an
embroidered handkerchief, which it is only merciful to
hope she has merely borrowed for the occasion of that
magnificent person her Aldgate cousin, and not purchased.
<p>It is merciful to hope that this is the case, because if
she has bought it she has wasted her money. The cost
of her flowers was waste, likewise of her bows and
streamers and her elaborate head-dress; likewise-and
this is worse than all-are all her past sacrifices to her
fetish waste. Her headaches, her heartaches, her rosiness, her pin-money, all, all have gone for nothing!
True she has had her " sport for her money," as the saying is, but it is the sport of the angler who catches no
fish. Ambition is the name of Miss Peascod's fetish.
She was taken to Widdles's when quite a little maid (it
was not her brother that escorted her in those times), and
there she found a paradise she had hitherto only dreamt
of. She found glitter, and sparkle, and music, and an
amount of polite attention at the hands of the white-gloved gentlemen assembled that fairlyturned her innocent
head. Individuals who, judged by their waistcoats and
moustaches, might have been barons at the very least,
solicited her for " the next set" with a humility which,
until she grew a little used to it, was really painful.
Clearly she had underrated herself. William was a very
nice young man, to be sure, and possibly gentlemen's
bootmaking was a decentish trade; but when she thought
on William's unfashionable whiskers, and his great hands
breaking through the tender stitches of his unwonted
white kids, and compared both - his hands and his
whiskers-to some that were there; to some, the owners
of which, with fairy lightness (William certainly was
rather flat-footed), had accompanied her through the
mazy dance, and even in one instance at least, and that
not the least aristocratic, inquired if that gentleman

<pb n="227" id="p.227">
(William) was her brother, and when this little episode in
this first of her Arabian nights crossed her memory,
together with the remembrance of the incredulous but
eminently gentlemanly stare with which the viscount, or
whatever he was, received her blushing answer that he
was not her brother but a friend; when, I say, this,
among other matters, reappeared to her that night as she
sat at her looking-glass putting her curls in paper, there
was reflected in it a face with something about it that,
could honest William have seen it, would have stabbed
his heart more cruelly than his keenest awl could. Her
foolish little heart felt itself debased any longer to harbour
so mean a lodger as a bootmaker, and from that time she
became a fetish worshipper, and so she remains. Since
that fatal evening her mind has, of course, been disabused
of many of the delusions which then crept into it. Her
viscounts have proved to be clerks, and her dukes persons
in the tailoring business. Her favourite baron had the
felicity of serving her with a yard of pink tarlatan behind
a draper's counter in Holborn. But her faith in her
fetish is not shaken, and she continues to worship at
Widdles's with touching constancy and devotion. Indeed,
her infatuation increases with her years; and though she
can now find no more agreeable escort than her bachelor
brother; though the M.C. has long ceased to bow and
scrape, and greet her with a familiar nod; though she
occasionally sits for half an hour with no one to speak to
her or bring her negus but Mr. Peascod, she finds at
Widdles's what she can find nowhere else. It is an oasis
in the desert. The glitter and sparkle of music, and
flaunting of sashes and rustling of silks, have become
essential to her very existence-that is, to her existence
as a fetish worshipper. One of these fine nights a brutal
giggle, or the rude shock of a very cold shoulder, will
break the spell, and she will then discover the heartless
wooden idol she has all along been worshipping. I hope
when that melancholy time arrives that her brother, the
master cabinetmaker, will have found the reward for
which he is craving-his fetish; and that Mrs. Peascod
<pb n="228" id="p.228">
will afford her a comfortable asylum in which to terminate her everlasting maidenhood; or, her brother
failing her, that her outfitting cousin from Aldgate may
captivate and marry Mr. Brussels Prout. I should like
to see that young gentleman daring to offer any objection
to Miss Peascod taking up her abode in his house if Mrs.
Prout willed otherwise.</div1><pb n="229" id="p.229">

REFLECTIONS ON BATTERED BREECHES.-
A NEWSPAPER BOY.</>
<p>HE is a "business man," without doubt. While
the heads of his customers were as yet pressing
their several pillows; while the horrible shrieks
of the London and North-Western mail-train
whistle was startling the babyhood of day,
while the omnibuses, now so prim and bright, still reposed in " the yard," spattered and grimy with yesterday's mire, this small radical was up and doing. He
was whistling over Blackfriars Bridge while St. Paul's
was chiming four; and before six o'clock he had borne
the brunt of four battles in as many newspaper-publishing
offices, coming off in each case with flying colours. True,
you may find the result of one of his skirmishes recorded
in a crimson smudge over the latest American war news;
but, don't be alarmed, it was only his nose, and you
should have seen the other chap's eye! "Well, and
served him right. What call had he got to push and
shove people about, and call them 'young feller,' because he wore a four-and-nine and had a pencil stuck
behind his ear, just as though he was wholesale-' Nine
quires, if you please, sir' (just fancy calling the chap
behind the counter 'sir'), as stuck up as though he
wanted the whole lot for his private reading. 'And,
please, sir, rop 'em up in wilit tissue for the genelman,
cos he's left his kid gloves at home on the peana,' says
I. 'Let me have none of your impertinence, young
feller,' says he. 'Well, you don't stand in want of it,
havin' a jolly good stock of your own,' says I
<pb n="230" id="p.230">
'howsomever, p'raps you'll be so perlite as not to scrouge, and
to take your hoofs off my toes, or else somethin' might
happen to that hat.'" That was the way the row began;
in the short space of seven minutes it was all over-the
stuck-up one defeated, the quire of Stars secured, the
wounded nasal organ bathed at the pump, and Battered
Breeches is enlivening dosy Fleet Street with "Sally
come up the middle" as he makes his way to the office
where a supply of " grafts " (B.B.'s playful abbreviation
of Daily Telegraphs) may be obtained.
<p>And did the publisher of that eminently peaceful
newspaper the Star permit this pugilistic encounter
on his premises? Did he not instantly take measures
for the protection of the stuck-up one and the expulsion
of Battered Breeches ? Did the porter take B.B. by his
baggy part and the nape of his neck, and, thrusting him
out, warn him never to show his face in Dorset Street
again? He did not. The obligations he and his employers are under to B. B. forbade any such unceremonious proceeding. For, be it known, Battered Breeches
is one of the chief pillars of the cheap press. Had it not
been for B. B. and his numerous friends, that mighty
engine the penny paper would have stood still long ago;
the requisite " mint sauce " (as that horribly vulgar and
slangy B. B. terms money), so necessary for lubricative
purposes, would have been wanting; and creaking, and
rust, and decay would speedily have ensued. But B. B.,
like the shrewd fellow he always shows himself, took the
matter into his consideration. He was hawking hearthstone at the time at a profit of about sixpence a day, and
one morning, just as he was beginning his rounds, he
happened to call at a house at the moment when the
newspaper boy was delivering a Times.
<p>"I wish I had your billet, young 'un, and you had
mine," said B. B., ruefully contrasting the light bundle
under the boy's arm with his own heavy bag. " How
much profit might there be on that there lot now?"
And the newspaper boy, having leisure and not too much
pride to converse with a hearthstone boy, obligingly sat
down and made a calculation. "There's one and tup
<pb n="231" id="p.231">
pence on this lot," said he; "that's a quarter profit,
don't you see, and a little over."
<p>"Is it a quarter profit on the penny 'uns?" asked
B. B.
<p>"It's always a quarter profit," he was answered.
<p>"And can you get as many as you like ?"
<p>"The more the merrier."
<p>So the newspaper boy went his way, and for more
than an hour B. B. sat in the sun on his hearthstone
bag, in the very brownest of studies. Little did the
despairing father of the first-born "penny daily," as he
that morning contemplated his month-old bantling,
starving and pining to death under his anxious eyes,
dream that at that very moment good luck was hatching
for him. He would not have believed it if he had seen
the hatcher; for, truly, B. B., who at that time had
neither cap nor boots, was not " a likely-looking bird;"
and if he and a gentleman with 500 to lend had simultaneously made their appearance at the office of the
Lightning Conductor, and each offered his services, there
can be little doubt as to which the proprietor would have
chosen. Nevertheless, had he accepted the five hundred,
and for ever lost humble B. B., he would have done a
very foolish thing.
<p>And yet B. B. had but sevenpence in the world. But
after an hour's cogitation he rose up a boy with a purpose; and had his life depended on the sale of his hearthstone he could not have hawked it more earnestly. He
begged, he implored, with tears in his eyes, as neatly he
piled the tempting pen'orth against the area railings, and
added another lump, and another, and yet still one
more, and cried, "Do, please marm!" in such a way
that it was impossible, unless one had a heart ten times
harder than he vowed his hearthstone was, to deny him.
By evening, although he had dined out of his bag, and
afforded himself half a pint of beer at the time, his
sevenpence had increased to eighteenpence.
<p>Six o'clock next morning saw him at the office of the
Lightning Conductor. Eight o'clock saw him at the
railway station, astonishing cads and policemen and
<pb n="232" id="p.232">
alarming nervous omnibus-riders by his tremendous
activity and the power of his lungs. "Penny daily,
sir ! penny daily! War with Roosher and horrible
murder in Pentonwill! Penny daily, sir! Latest
edition!" If he had had long practice as a waiter in
an up-stairs dining-room, or any number of months'
experience at the Model Prison, he could not have
skipped on and off the kerb and up and down the omnibus-steps with greater agility. By half-past eight he
had sold his twenty-five " dailys," and bagged ninepence
clear. What was the result ? Twenty pairs of admiring,
envious eyes had observed his success. The crossing-sweep pondered the matter over his fruitless broom;
the boys who simply "hung about" held council together. The morning following, when B. B. went for
his quire and a half, he found to his dismay four other
young gentlemen of his own stamp, and on the same
errand. Nevertheless, despite his great fear that the
market would be glutted and the scheme ruined, he sold
out, and the other four adventurers sold out, and the
news spread through the town like wildfire (whatever
that may be). Day by day the B. B. brigade grew
stronger and stronger until it became a thousand strong,
and so the penny daily newspaper became a national
institution. I wonder how a man would be received if
he were to wait on the nabobs of the Star, and the
Standard, and the "Graft," and suggest the propriety
of a banquet to Battered Breeches!

portable dictionary of proper names. The ' Encyclopedia Britannica,' the ' English Encyclopaedia,' and
the other great digests of human knowledge, in consequence of their high price, are accessible only to a
few. In such works no special provision is made for
supplying short and comprehensive information regarding individual words, arranged in their alphabetical order, of the kind most likely to be required by
the great mass of general readers. Mr. Beeton to
some extent enters a new field in devoting a Dictionary exclusively to proper names in Geography, History, Biography, Mythology, Bible Knowledge, and
Chronology. In these pages condensation has been in
every way sought after, and we know of no work
which supplies more information at a smaller cost."
