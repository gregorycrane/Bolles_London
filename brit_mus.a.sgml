<head>Contest of the Centaurs and Lapithae.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.069" n="2001.03.0071"><head>The Metopes of the Parthenon, No. 1</head></figure>

<p>THESE Metopes are numbered 1 to 16. " Metope" is
the name given to the interval between two triglyphs,
or ornamental tablets in a Doric frieze. In the emple
of the Parthenon, at Athens, these were filled up with
sculptures in high relief, the subjects of which refer
exclusively to the story of the contest of the Centaurs
and Lapithae. Of these we shall select one or two as
specimens, referring the visitor for the others to the
originals in the Museum, the whole of which are full of
beauties. The story of the contest, which these Metopes represent, is briefly as follows :-The people of
Thessaly were supposed to have been the first in Greece
who practised the art of riding on horseback, in which
they became remarkably expert; and, from the facility
with which they hunted the wild bulls of the Pelion
mountains, they obtained the name of Centauri and
Hippo-Centauri. The ease with which they managed
their horses-the action of the animal appearing to be
totally dependent on the will of the rider-induced the
ignorant peasantry to believe them to be formed partly
of a horse and partly of a man; and this curious idea
was readily adopted and perpetuated by poets, painters,
and sculptors. The tradition runs, that the Centaurs
were invited to the nuptials of Pirithous, king of the
Lapithae, at which Theseus and other Athenian friends
were also present; but during the feast a dispute arose
between the Centaurs and the other parties, which led
to blows, and ultimately to a furious battle, which only
terminated in the former being driven from the territory of Thessaly. They took refuge in Arcadia, but
provoking the anger of Hercules, he completely destroyed the whole race. Such is the general outline
of the mythological history of the Centaurs.
<p>In the sculpture before us an Athenian, or Lapitha,
is fighting with a Centaur, who appears borne to the
ground by the superior strength of his adversary. The
head and right arm of the Athenian are lost, but from
the attitude, we may suppose the right arm to have
been upraised, as in the act of striking.

<head>Contest of the Centaurs and Lapithae.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.070" n="2001.03.0072"><head>The Metopes of the Parthenon, No. 2</head></figure>

<p>THIS Metope represents a combat similar to No. 1, in
which the Athenian again has the advantage.  He
appears to have seized the Centaur by the neck or hair,
his right knee pressing upon the croupe of his opponent, who stretches his left arm backward to disengage himself. A mantle of a considerable depth falls
from the shoulders of the'Athenian. The heads of
both these figures are gone; that of the Centaur
having disappeared between the year <datestruct value="1674--"><year reg="1674">1674</year></datestruct> (when a
drawing was made of it by Jacques Carrey) and <datestruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></datestruct>,
the time when Stuart made a drawing of the whole
subject (see <bibl>Antiquities of Athens, vol. 2. chap. i,
pl. xi</bibl>). As the Turks and modern Greeks use the
remains of antiquity for the commonest building purposes, and otherwise destroy the most beautiful architectural ornaments of Greece, these Metopes might
in a short time have become entirely lost to the world,
had not Lord Elgin obtained permission to transport
them to England, where, having been admired by all
persons of true taste, they were at length purchased
by the government and consigned to the British Museum, whose walls they now adorn.
<p>Although the spoliation of such a noble specimen
of classic elegance and taste as the Parthenon cannot
but be lamented, it must still be a matter of satisfaction to all enlightened nations to know that the best
portions of that building, although torn from their
parent soil, are, by that very act, preserved from the
barbarous ravages of those who, instead of being the
natural protectors of the remains of the ancient art
of their country, have proved themselves its worst
enemies.

Metopes of the Parthenon, No. 12.</HEAD>

<p><figure id="fig.050" n="2001.03.0052"><head>The Metopes of the Parthenon, No. 12</head></figure>

<p>IN this Metope a centaur is represented victorious,
and trampling upon the body of his fallen enemy. His
left arm is outstretched, and hanging over it is the
skin of a lion, a portion of which also flies behind him.
The right arm is broken off near the shoulder, and
the head and legs are gone; but the effect of action
on the body is admirably expressed. There is also an
accurate and remarkable expression of death in the
body of the Athenian.
<p>It may not be improper to say something here of
the elements of these Metopes as they regard art. Mr
Westmacott observed, in one of his lectures at the
Royal Academy, that from their inequalities, both in
composition and treatment, we might reasonably be
permitted to doubt whether they were the design of
the same master; that they were not the productions
of the same hand, he thought sufficiently obvious. In
some will be found the highest qualities of the period
to which they belong; in several may be traced the
hard and severe style of the earlier schools; whilst
others neither conform in character, style, or disposition, with either. Nor need we be surprised at this
inequality. Phidias (under whose control the Temple
of the Parthenon was erected) was an example of
extraordinary genius of his own time; and although
he retained the principles established at AEgina, and
of preceding ages, he must be considered the founder
rather than the follower of a school. He was compelled, in addition to his own immediate disciples, to
call in the assistance of many with whom early habits
or local difficulties and associations interposed to
prevent their immediate adoption of his enlarged
principles; and thus the variation in the style of the
different Metopes may be sufficiently accounted for.

The Panathenaic Frieze.-First Part of No. 17.</HEAD>

<div2 type=object n=1>
<head>Procession in Honour of Minerva.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.061" n="2001.03.0063"><head>The Panathenaic Frieze, First Part of No. 17</head></figure>

<p>ONE of the richest ornaments with which Phidias embellished the outside of the Temple of the Parthenon
was, without doubt, that uninterrupted series of bas-
reliefs which occupied the upper part of the walls
within the colonnade, at the height of the frieze of the
pronaos, or porch, and which was continued entirely
round the building.
<p>The subject represented the sacred procession which
was celebrated every fifth year at Athens in honour of
Minerva, the guardian goddess of the city; and embraced in its composition all the external observances
of this the highest festival of the Athenians,
<p>The blocks of marble of which the frieze was composed were 3 feet 4 inches high; they were placed
about 9 feet within the external row of columns; and
occupied, slab after slab, a space of 524 feet in length.
As a connected subject, this was the most extensive
piece of sculpture ever made in Greece, Of its remains the British Museum  possesses an extent, in
slabs and fragments of marble, of rather more than
249 feet; with a continuation in plaster casts of more
than 76 feet, making a total of nearly 326 feet. The
bas-reliefs which at present compose the frieze, are
placed, as far as they extend, in the same order in
which they were originally seen upon the Parthenon;
but the spectator in the Elgin room has to keep in
mind that that which formerly surrounded an exterior
wall now lines the interior.
<p>We begin with those (Nos. 17 to 25) which were
originally placed on the eastern or principal front of
the Temple.

The Panathenaic Frieze.-Second Part of No. 17.</HEAD>

<head>Procession in Honour of Minerva.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.060" n="2001.03.0062"><head>The Panathenaic Frieze, Second Part of No. 17</head></figure>

<p>THE slabs are arranged in the same manner in which
the spectator viewed them as he approached the Temple by the east, and walked round it by the north,
west and south. At the entrance of the room is a slab
marked No. 17, (which we have been compelled to
divide into two portions, the dimensions of the cards
not allowing the whole to be given in one), on which
are seen eleven female figures, clothed to the feet,
representing the virgins of Attica.  Five of these,
nearest to the door, carry such vessels as were used in
making libations, or drink offerings to the gods; and
three others are sciaphorae, or bearers of umbrellas.
These head the procession from the southern frieze.
<p>In these bas-reliefs are the images of gods or deified
heroes, basket-bearers, bearers of libatory vessels, trains
of females, persons of every age and sex, men on horseback, victims, charioteers, in short, the whole people
represented conveying in solemn pomp to this very
Temple of the Parthenon, the Peplus, or Sacred Veil,
which was to be suspended before the colossal statue
of Minerva situated at this spot. The procession appears to have assembled near the western part of the
outer walls of Athens, and to have thence passed round
the southern side of the Acropolis (the rock on which
the citadel was built) until it arrived opposite the
eastern entrance of the Parthenon, when the bearer of
the Peplus, or Sacred Veil, and the two arrephori (the
superintendents of the embroiderers of the veil) entered the temple, and delivered their sacred burthens
to the archon (the chief magistrate) and to the priestess
of Minerva.

The Panathenaic Frieze.-First Part of No. 18.</HEAD>

<div2 type=object n=1>
<head>Procession in Honour of Minerva.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.059" n="2001.03.0061"><head>The Panathenaic Frieze, First Part of No. 18</head></figure>

<p>THIS portion of the slab 18 (which, from the cause before-mentioned has been divided in our wood-cut,
similarly to No. 17), contains four male figures partly
clothed: two of them have been considered to represent Hierophants (or expounders of mysterious occurrences) exercising their talents in the elucidation of
some mystery connected with the object of the procession; the other two are conjectured to be Mystae,
or Priests, by whom religious doctrines were taught.
Visconti, however, supposed the whole four to represent
personages occupying the highest situations in the
magistracy and priesthood of Athens, charged with
the superintendence and direction of the solemnity.
<p>The low relief of these sculptures (being not above
an inch from the background) will immediately strike
the beholder; but we shall see how this may be
accounted for. The situation intended for this ornament to the temple afforded only a secondary light,
and so far prescribed to Phidias the manner in which
he was to direct the execution of the figures. The
direct light of the sun could never reach it, for, being
placed immediately beneath the soffit, or ceiling of the
portico or colonnade, it received all its light from
between the columns, and by reflection from the pavement below. The frieze could only be seen at an
angle of 42 1/2 degrees; and the flatness of the sculpture
is thus sufficiently accounted for: had the relief been
prominent, the upper parts could not have been seen;
the shade projected by the sculpture would have rendered it dark, and the parts would have been reduced
by their shadows.

<p><figure id="fig.058" n="2001.03.0060"><head>The Panathenaic Frieze, Second Part of No. 18</head></figure>

<p>BY the side of the four figures which we have described in the account of the other portion of this
slab, are placed four sitting figures. On a stool or
chair, with four carved legs, at the extremity of the
slab, is seated a young man, who, with his hands
clasped in each other, is raising his right knee. This
figure is supposed to be Triptolemus, an ancient hero
of Attica, who instructed mankind in the cultivation
of corn, and who was at his death worshipped as a god.
<p>Ceres occupies the seat next to him-her head had
formerly a crown upon it, but it has become decayed,
or been broken off; she is distinguished by holding a
large torch. The neighbouring seats to the left are
occupied by two divinities sitting in contrary directions, but as. the right arm of one is laid familiarly
upon the shoulder of the other, they have been thought
to represent the Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux, the twin
sons of Jupiter and Leda, who were worshipped by
the Athenians, and had temples at Athens.
<p>The variety of attitude, the grace, and the correct
anatomy of these figures are very remarkable. These
qualities run through the whole of these wonderful
sculptures; although there are, in the whole series,
some hundred figures, we shall find it impossible to
point out two in which there is any complete resemblance; and it would be as difficult to find one in
which the action is not appropriate, or in which the
drawing is incorrect.

Panathenaic Frieze.-No. 19. Part I.</HEAD>

<div2 type=object n=1>
<head>Procession in Honour of Minerva.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.057" n="2001.03.0059"><head>The Panathenaic Frieze, First Part of No. 19</head></figure>

<p>WE are again compelled to divide the representation
of this bas-relief. This slab is the longest in the collection, and originally stood immediately above the
eastern gate, forming the centre of the composition.
The person with a beard, and a robe wrapt round the
legs, but which has fallen from the shoulders, has
been conjectured to be Jupiter. His seat is more
ornamented than the others in No. 18, and may more
properly be termed a throne, of which the arms are
supported by small sphinxes.
<p>Close to him sits a goddess, who seems to be removing her veil, and who has been by some considered
to be Juno; but others have supposed, from the figure
of Victory with wings, behind, that she is intended for
Minerva, who appears, not in a warrior's habit, but as
the peaceful goddess of wisdom.
<p>A small part of the figure of Victory is lost, but
in other respects this slab is in a tolerably perfect
state. When we consider the many centuries the
Parthenon has stood exposed to the weather, the
vicissitudes of war, and above all to the barbarity of
the modern inhabitants of Greece, we may reasonably
wonder that so much of these sculptures remain in
the semi-perfect state we see them.
<p>At the siege of Athens in <datestruct value="1687--"><year reg="1687">1687</year></datestruct>, a bomb-shell, fired
from the opposite hill of the "Museum," fell in the
midst of the building, and, exploding, destroyed
nearly half the fabric: but the eastern portico seems
to have been just at the extremity of the circle
subject to its destructive influence, so that it was
only by the shock that the sculptures were injured
without completely bursting them from off the sides
of the building.

<p><figure id="fig.052" n="2001.03.0054"><head>The Panathenaic Frieze, Second Part of No. 19</head></figure>

<p>IN this slab, in the centre of the wood-cut, a priestess
is represented, who Visconti considers to have been
the wife of the reigning Archon, or chief magistrate
of Athens. She is in the act of receiving from two
canephori, or bearers of the mystic baskets, the
articles serving for the rites of sacrifice; these, covered
with a veil, they carry upon their heads.
<p>These canephori were virgins chosen from the
noblest families of Athens; and the contents of the
baskets appear to have been salt and meal.
<p>One of these maidens has a torch in her hand, the
other carries a scroll unrolled, upon which the hymn
is supposed to have been written which the virgins
sang in praise of Minerva, the guardian goddess of the
city, which indeed was named after her, Athena. A
colossal statue of this goddess, by Phidias, was one of
the grandest ornaments of the city, and the pride of
the Athenian people.
<p>To the left of the priestess stands a person, in a
drapery which reaches from the head to the feet, who
is receiving from the hands of a youth a piece of cloth
folded in a square form in numerous thicknesses.
This person is supposed to be the Archon of the
period, and the cloth he is receiving has been conjectured to be the <hi rend=italic>peplus</hi>, or embroidered veil, which
was borne in the procession and consecrated in the
Temple to Minerva. As it was the principal object
of the solemnity, it may naturally be expected to form
a leading feature in the sculpture. The young Athenian who presents the peplus to the Archon has no
garment but the chlamys, or cloak.

Panathenaic Frieze.-No. 19. Part III.</HEAD>

<div2 type=object n=1>

<p><figure id="fig.051" n="2001.03.0053"><head>The Panathenaic Frieze, Third Part of No. 19</head></figure>

<p>IN this portion of the frieze, which is the end of slab
marked 19, we observe two figures seated. The male
figure represents AEsculapius, the God of Physic; and
the female, his daughter Hygeia, the Goddess of Health.
AEsculapius leans upon the end of his staff, and his
daughter is known by the attribute of a small serpent
twined round her left arm, but which from the corrosion of the surface is not easily perceptible. Many
species of serpents were considered to be of great efficacy in curing most of the diseases of the human body,
and hence its adoption as an attribute of Hygeia.
<p>As the peplus forms so important an object in this
slab (of which the figure in this card is but a portion)
we may be expected to afford some slight account of
it. The peplus was the work of young virgins selected
from the best families in Athens, over whom two of
the principal, called Arrephorae, were superintendents. On it was embroidered the battle of the Gods
and Giants; and the names of those Athenians who
had been eminent for military virtues. When the
festival was celebrated (which was every fifth year)
this peplus was brought from the Acropolis, where it
had been worked, down into the city; it was then
displayed and suspended as a sail to a ship, which, on
that day, attended by a numerous and splendid procession, was conducted through the Ceramicus (the
north-western division of Athens) and other principal
parts, till it had made the circuit of the Acropolis (the
rock of the citadel); it was then carried up to the
Parthenon, and there consecrated to Minerva.

<p><figure id="fig.026" n="2001.03.0027"><head>The Panathenaic Frieze, Nos. 37 and 39</head></figure>

<p>IT would exceed the limits of our plan to give a
representation of the whole of these beautiful marbles,
although they are all equally deserving of notice. We
have already given the principal portion of the eastern
frieze, in the description of which we have detailed
the object of the procession which the sculptures represent, and the position and characters of the marbles.
But we have not hitherto presented any specimen of
the power of the artists employed in the execution of
these bas-reliefs, in exhibiting the form, action, and
expression of an animal which forms a principal
feature in the procession-the horse. It is more especially for the excellence of the sculpture which the
representations of that animal displays, that the
marbles of the Elgin Collection have become so famous. The horses are of the most exquisite beauty.
Of a hundred and ten which are introduced, no two
are in the same attitude; each is characterised by a
marked difference of expression. Yet if it were possible to draw a distinction as to the merits of the
various slabs of marble, we might wish to draw particular attention to those marked 37 to 43. We have
presented two of these, which are among the most perfect of the series, on the present card. The horses'
heads are generally large, and their necks thick, a
characteristic of the Grecian horses, particularly those
of Thessaly, to the present time; a distinction which
those persons acquainted with horses will readily
appreciate; and if those who fancy that long necks
and smaller heads would be more graceful and beautiful, will but look at these sculptures, they will feel
inclined to doubt whether such would be an improvement.

<p><figure id="fig.040" n="2001.03.0042"><head>The Panathenaic Frieze, Nos. 41 and 42</head></figure>

<p>THE horsemen represented in these slabs appear to
be Athenian citizens of the second class who served in
the cavalry. Their number during the Peloponnesian
war was 1000. In many of the Greek communities
there was a class distinguished by a name which has
reference to the ability to maintain a horse, or perhaps a couple; one for the rider, and the other for
his servant. The possession of such means would
naturally give rise to a kind of military caste of an
upper order; for where all citizens are bound to military service at their own expense, wealth will determine the rank and the armour of each individual.
<p>The horsemen in this part of the procession are
mostly clothed, though some are without sandals. The
<hi rend=italic>cothurnus</hi>, or top-boot, closely fitted to the leg, may be
observed in several, (see 41, &amp;c.) and in 42 two of the
figures wear helmets.
<p>The bridles of the horses in many of the slabs, as
well as some other ornaments, were originally of
gilded bronze; the holes in the marble, to which the
metal was fastened, being discernible in several.
<p>Flaxman, in his lectures at the Royal Academy,
used to speak of these horses with the greatest enthusiasm. He considered them   the most precious
examples of Grecian power in the sculpture of animals.
<quote>"The horses in the Frieze in the Elgin Collection,"
he said, "appear to live and move, to roll their eyes,
to gallop, prance, and curvet; the veins of their faces
and legs seem distended with circulation; in them are
distinguished the hardness and decision of bony forms,
from the elasticity of tendon, and the softness of flesh.
The beholder is charmed with the deer-like lightness
and elegance of their make, and although the relief is
not above an inch from the background, and they are
so much smaller than nature, we can scarcely suffer
reason to persuade us they are not alive."</quote>

the Museum possesses in marble. But there are in
the Museum plaster casts (numbered 48 to 61) of fourteen slabs still attached to the Temple, forming the
remainder of the western frieze. In this frieze the
procession of the horsemen is not in any order, nor
does it make that crowded appearance which distinguishes the cavalry of the Northern Frieze. The
slabs towards the close seem to represent the last
comers to the procession.  Some are represented
drawing on their buskins, others are adjusting their
bridles, some are preparing to mount their horses, and
others are contending with them in order to prevent
their escape.
<p>In the slab No. 47 two horsemen are represented,
one of whom is riding before the other, and seems to
be in the act of urging his companion forward. The
latter appears to be armed with a cuirass. This slab
is one of exquisite beauty; the figure of the foremost
horseman, and indeed that of his companion also, may
be considered the perfection of elegance in composition
and of truth in drawing. The horses are no less to be
admired. They seem to be in a state of impatient
motion, only restrained by the address of their riders;
in this sculpture the truth of Flaxman's remark is
well exemplified-it is difficult to conceive that they
are formed of an inanimate mass of stone.
<p>Whatever may be the cause which produces it, it is
certain that, in rising from the contemplation of these
sculptures, the observer feels that he has imbibed
some of the grandeur and simplicity of idea which the
artist has pourtrayed in their composition.

<p><figure id="fig.034" n="2001.03.0035"><head>The Panathenaic Frieze, Nos. 81 and 86</head></figure>

<p>THIS is the portion of the Frieze which enriched the
southern side of the Temple. The direction of the
figures which form it is from left to right, and the
numbers being in continuity from the western frieze,
begin with the end of the procession, and extend from
62 to 90, round to the door of entrance into the Elgin
Room. We select two slabs from these, as specimens
of the two peculiarities in which this side differs from
those which we have before described, namely, in
having chariots as part of the procession, and in exhibiting the manner in which the victims were led to
sacrifice.
<p>No. 81. A quadriga, or chariot drawn by four horses,
is very imperfect, but it exhibits much beauty. A
soldier with a helmet and shield stands in the chariot,
whilst the horses are driven by another figure by his
side. It has been supposed that these portions of the
frieze contained representations of the different kinds
of chariots then in use-as the biga, the triga, &amp;c., but
a careful inspection will show that they are all drawn
by four horses, being in fact all quadrigal.
<p>In No. 86 we see a victim being led to the altar.
At the Panathenaic festival each of the colonies of
Athens sent an ox to be sacrificed, and in these slabs,
from 84 to 90, they are represented on their route.
Some are proceeding quietly, others are struggling
with their utmost efforts, but the drawing of the animals, whether the limbs are in repose or thrown into
the strongest action, will always be found correct.

<p>IN No. 85 an ox is struggling with all his efforts to
escape from the bonds in which he is held by the
Athenians, one on either side-a third walks at the
head of the animal. In 87 the ox is proceeding quietly
to the Temple, although guarded by a like number of
figures.
<p>In these sculptures the oxen are acknowledged to
be perfect representations of the finest species of those
animals. The universality of the genius of the Greeks,
indeed, in all that belonged to animal nature is powerfully exemplified in the sculptures of the Elgin frieze.
<p>It was at one time thought that the frieze of the
Parthenon contained portraits of many of the leading
persons of Athens who lived during the Peloponnesian
war, particularly of Pericles, Phidias, Socrates, Alcibiades, Aspasia, &amp;c.; but a careful examination leads
to the belief that, in this respect, individuality of
representation was not intended by the artists. So,
also, those who view this frieze must be reminded
that they are not to consider it as a close representation of national costume. It is true that the priestess,
the canephori, and some others, are represented in the
dresses which they are believed to have used in the
solemnity; and, here and there the <hi rend=italic>cothurnus</hi>, or
buskin, will be seen, as also the <hi rend=italic>Thessalian hat</hi> in one
or two instances; but, generally speaking, the correctness of national dress is disregarded throughout, and harmony of composition alone studied.

<head>Hyperion.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.062" n="2001.03.0064"><head>Statue of Hyperion</head></figure>

<p>THE pediments of the Parthenon were ornamented
with statues which afford some of the finest specimens
of ancient sculpture. The subject of the sculpture on
the east side of the Temple was the Birth of Minerva,
who is fabled to have been born in the head of Jupiter,
having had no mother; and the hour of her birth was,
according to the fable, also that of her maturity. As
all the gods were assembled to witness or assist in this
extraordinary birth, they have been represented in
this pediment, together with other figures which were
adopted by the artists as typical of particular events
connected with the subject.
<p>The <hi rend=italic>angle</hi> of the eastern pediment on the <hi rend=italic>left</hi> of the
spectator was occupied by a figure of Hyperion, or the
sun personified, rising from  the sea. The head,
shoulders, and arms, which last were stretched out to
guide the reins of hiscoursers, were the only parts of
his body seen, the rest being submerged in the waves,
which are indicated on the plinth. The head and
hands of this figure are lost, but the neck, shoulders,
and arms remain to attest the excellence of the sculpture. The smooth surface of the marble of this figure
has been much protected by its position in the pediment, and proves that those parts of the sculptures
of the Parthenon which were invisible to the spectator
who stood below, were as elaborately executed as
those which were immediately in sight. Whether this
was done from a religious feeling, or because the
sculptures were submitted to public examination before they were placed on the building, may be matter
of conjecture.
<p>The length of the plinth is 4 feet, by 2 feet 7 inches
in width.

<head>The Horses of Hyperion.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.042" n="2001.03.0044"><head>The Horses of Hyperion</head></figure>

<p>THE heads of two of the horses of Hyperion are here
represented rising from the sea, beneath which the
car of the sun is supposed to be, to which they are
attached. Much of the surface of these heads has
been destroyed; but their appearance is still that of
life and vigour, and their impatience of restraint is
strongly depicted.
<p>Jacques Carrey, a French artist, was employed from
<datestruct value="1674--"><year reg="1674">1674</year></datestruct> to <datestruct value="1678--"><year reg="1678">1678</year></datestruct>, by the Marquis de Nointel, in making
drawings of the antiquities of Greece, and from a comparison of those by him of this part of the Parthenon,
with the figures before us, Mr. Cockerell, the celebrated architect, was induced to believe that two other
heads in low relief were attached. This will appear
by bringing the front part of the plinth in a line with
that of theHyperion: the waves of Hyperion's plinth,
it will be observed, are continued on the plinth of the
horses; and behind them there was space enough for
two other heads between these and the wall of the
pediment. The car of Hyperion, in most of its representations, is drawn by four horses.
<p>These two horses' heads, together with the head of
the horse of Night, in the same collection, were valued
by Mr. William Richard Hamilton, in his examination
before the committee of the House of Commons on the
occasion of the purchase of the marbles by government, at 2000<hi rend=italic>l</hi>.; but it should be observed that this
gentleman's valuations were considered by the House
to be too high. He valued the whole of the Elgin
marbles at 60,800<hi rend=italic>l</hi>., whereas only the sum of 35,000<hi rend=italic>l</hi>.
was voted for their purchase,

<head>Theseus.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.066" n="2001.03.0068"><head>Front View of the Statue of Theseus</head></figure>

<p>THIS figure is the most perfect of all in the Elgin
collection, wanting only the hands and feet, and part of
the nose. It is half reclined on a rock, which is
covered with a lion's skin, and an extended drapery.
The late Mr. Taylor Combe named it Theseus, and it
is still generally so called, but whether this be the
true designation of the figure has been doubted. Sir
Richard Westmacott in one of his lectures pronounced
at the Royal Academy in the spring of <datestruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></datestruct>, discussed
this question at considerable length, and he gave it as
the opinion of the Chevalier Bronsted, in which he
concurred, that this statue represented, <quote>"not Theseus
the Athenian hero, who was not in existence at the
period of the story which the sculpture represents,
but Cephalus, who was as celebrated for his heroic
virtues as for his beauty, and who was borne off by
Aurora to Olympus. Plato styles him <quote>'the Gateway
of the Beauty of Heaven:'</quote> he was fond of the chase,
and he is described as repairing nightly to the east of
Mount Hymettus (in Attica) to await the earliest appearance of day. Now all this agrees perfectly with
the marble: he sits as he is always described, whether
by the poets, or on vases or coins, leaning on his left
elbow, seated on the skin of some wild animal, and
bearing in his hand a golden spear, and watching the
car of the sun, with Hyperion emerging from the sea,
the first dawn, to start on his course."</quote>
<p>Others again have considered this figure to represent Hercules; not the Theban Hercules, who was not
born at the time of the mythological nativity of
Minerva, but another, who was born on the Ida of
Crete, and who was more ancient even than Jupiter.
We have little to guide us in the adoption of a name
which will probably ever remain conjectural.

<p><figure id="fig.065" n="2001.03.0067"><head>Back View of the Statue of Theseus</head></figure>

<p>WE have already described the object of this figure,
but its merits as a work of art are deserving of a more
particular notice. So universally have artists been
attracted by its excellence that more drawings have
been made from it in the former and present Elgin
Rooms, than from all the other Athenian marbles put
together. It combines ideal beauty with the truth of
nature; and even anatomically speaking, the muscles
are allowed to be invariably true to the attitude. <quote>"I
should say that the back of the Theseus was the finest
thing in the world,"</quote> were the words of Flaxman, one
of our most eminent sculptors, when giving evidence
before a committee of the House of Commons. It is
unquestionably finished in the very perfection of art
<p>The knowledge of anatomy among the early Greeks
was so small that it could have afforded little assistance
to the artist. Yet, although the ancient artists, even
in the time of Phidias and Praxiteles, owed much
more to the study of living than dead bodies, various
circumstances must sometimes have given them anatomical help from early times: the researches of
physicians, the observation of bodies left on the field
of battle, the preparations of sacrifice, or food, and the
practice of dissecting quadrupeds among the philosophers-<quote>"these several sources," says Flaxman, "will
at least account for all the general and simple anatomical forms we see in Grecian works of art before the
time of Phidias."</quote>
<p>One or two bullet marks are observable on this
figure, and the right leg appears to have been mended
at some former time; there are holes remaining,
which would indicate that it had sandals of metal. It
is in length 5 feet 8 inches, by 4 feet in height.

<p><figure id="fig.039" n="2001.03.0041"><head>Ceres and Proserpine</head></figure>

<p>THIS colossal group of two females sitting by each
other on separate seats, is believed to represent Ceres
and her daughter Proserpine, who are here introduced
as personating the distant region of the earth, and
whose worship and mysteries formed so important a
part of the religious system of Attica.
<p>These goddesses are sitting on low square seats,
which are nearly alike in construction, without backs,
but furnished with carpets, folded several times, and
ornamented with mouldings. The figure to the left
of the spectator, considered as Proserpine, is the
smaller of the two, and leans the left arm on the right
shoulder of her mother. The heads and hands of both
figures are lost, but the other parts are in tolerable
preservation. The feet of both, and the knees of the
larger figure in their original position projected considerably beyond the plane of the cornice which was
below them.
<p>The attitude and beauty of proportion in these
figures are no less admirable than the arrangement
and execution of their draperies; which, independent
of the considerations already referred to under Hyperion, show the enthusiasm of the artist in his work.
They are finished with the same unsparing labour at
the back, where none could see them, as in the front
where they were exposed to view.
<p>Mr. West spoke of these and of the other draped
figures of the collection from the Parthenon, as in the
first class of grandeur.
<p>Colonel Leake, instead of Ceres and Proserpine,
called these figures Venus and Peitho (Persuasion).<note type=foot n=1>><bibl>Topography of Athens, p. 255.</bibl></note>

<p><figure id="fig.024" n="2001.03.0025"><head>The Fates</head></figure>

<p>IN the former Elgin Room one of these figures was
separated from the other two; but its adjustment, and
other circumstances, indicated that the three originally
formed one group. They appear together in Carrey's
drawings of this pediment; and they have in consequence been placed together in the new Elgin Room.
<p>We have only been able to delineate the two figures
which are combined, the one lying in the lap of the
other, but the other figure which is separated from
these is equally fine both in composition and execution.
<p>Visconti says, " These three goddesses, in my opinion,
are the Fates. They presided, according to the Greek
mythology, over birth as well as over death; they were
the companions of Ilithyia, the goddess of child-birth,
and they sang the destinies of new-born infants. In
this capacity they appear to be attending on the birth
of Minerva, and they were frequently represented in
ancient art employed in similar offices, particularly in
the Temple at Delphi."
<p>Sir Richard Westmacott, in describing these figures,
observes, that "two of them, Clotho and Lachesis,
appear to have performed their task; whilst Atropos,
reclining in the lap of one of her sisters, is regarding
the termination or end of things personified by Night,
a winged female figure descending with her car into
the ocean." This figure of Night here mentioned was
situated at the extremity of the pediment, to the right
of the spectator, corresponding to the figure of Hyperion, or Day, rising from the sea at the other angle.

<p>THE chariot of Night sinking into the ocean, at the
moment when that of the Sun was rising in the east,
terminated the composition on this side. The centre
of the composition of the eastern pediment had disappeared completely even when Carrey made his
drawings in the latter part of the 17th century; but
the Elgin collection contains the principal figures of
the angles to the right and left of the centre, and
among the finest of them, besides those already given,
is this head of one of the horses of Night. This head
projected over the cornice, thus breaking the line
which might seem too rigidly to confine the composition of the frontispiece.
<p>Wheler and Spon, who supposed the sculptures of
this pediment to represent the contest between Neptune and Minerva for the guardianship of Attica,
fancied this fragment to have been the head of a sea-horse.
<p>It is of the finest possible workmanship, and its sur-
face has been very little injured. We observe in it that
admirable expression of life which great artists only
are capable of bestowing on their imitations of nature.
To use the words of the author of the <bibl>"Memorandum of
the Earl of Elgin's Pursuits in Greece"</bibl>-<quote>"the nostrils
are distended, the ears erect, the veins swollen, one

<p>Mr. Payne Knight valued this horse at 250<hi rend=italic>l</hi>., and a
granite scarabaeus (only remarkable for its age and
size) at 300<hi rend=italic>l</hi>.! We have already mentioned that Mr.
W. R. Hamilton considered this, and the two horses'
heads of Hyperion, to be worth, together, 2000<hi rend=italic>l</hi>.

<p><figure id="fig.025" n="2001.03.0026"><head>Ilissus, or the River God</head></figure>

<p>THE western pediment of the Temple of the Parthenon contained statues similarly to the eastern
pediment. The subject on this side was the contest
of Minerva and Neptune for the guardianship of
Attica; nearly the whole of which was in existence
in <datestruct value="1675--"><year reg="1675">1675</year></datestruct>, when it was copied by Carrey, who has been
elsewhere mentioned. This figure is typical of the
river Ilissus, which waters the eastern plain of Athens;
and as the subject of the composition is the dispute
for the territory of Attica, the river which waters it is
not unaptly introduced. This figure, half reclined,
seems, by a sudden movement, to raise himself with
impetuosity, being overcome with joy at the agreeable
news of the victory of Minerva. The momentary
attitude which this motion occasions is one of the
boldest and most difficult to be expressed that can
possibly be imagined.
<p>He is represented at the instant when the whole
weight of his body is about to be supported by the left
hand and arm, which press strongly on the earth, on
which the right foot also rests. This motion causes
the whole figure to appear animated; it seems to have
a life which is found in very few works of art. The
illusion is still more strengthened by the perfect expression of the skin, which, in several parts of this
statue, owing to its situation and position, has been
better preserved than any of the others; one is almost
tempted to call it perfectly flexible and elastic.
<p>This statue has been considered by Canova, and other
competent judges, to rank next to the Theseus in point
of merit. It is supposed to have been coloured when
originally adapted to this building, as remains of paint
are still discernible on it.

<p>The angles of the aegis, or breast-plate, appear to
have been ornamented with bronze serpents, and its
centre studded with the Medusa's head of the same
material. The holes for fastening those appendages

but this fragment at the period of Lord Elgin's visit

shoulders left, the front part of the body having been
broken: but the back has suffered less injury. It
measures 2 feet 8 inches in height, by 3 feet 5 inches
in width. The chest of Neptune was described by
Homer as being the most imposing part of his form,
and, from what remains in this fragment, we may
judge that the attention of Phidias was particularly directed to this portion of the body. Indeed, throughout
the marbles of the Parthenon, the sculptor appears to
have embodied in his works the most striking characteristics with which the great Greek poet had stamped the divinities of Olympus.

<head>Colossal Statue of Bacchus.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.048" n="2001.03.0050"><head>Colossal Statue of Bacchus</head></figure>

<p>THIS colossal figure was formerly placed upon the
summit of a monument situated on the south side of
the Acropolis of Athens. This edifice, known as the
Choragic Monument of Thrasyllus, was constructed
in the year 320 B.C., and by an inscription still remaining on it, we learn that Thrasyllus of Deceleia
caused the monument to be raised in order to perpetuate the memory of the victory obtained by the Hippothoontic tribe in the choruses of men at the Festival
of Bacchus, while he was Choragus, or leader of the
chorus. (The nature of the duties of a Choragus will
be found sufficiently explained under the No. 359.)
<p>This colossal figure, while it remained on the building, was considered to represent a female. Stuart
considered it to personify the town of which the
Choragus was a native. Dr. Chandler conjectured that
it might have represented Niobe. Others again were
of opinion that the figure might possibly represent
Diana, and the skin of a lion which forms a part of the
dress would agree sufficiently well with the goddess
of hunting. But all these conjectures appeared to be
without foundation when the statue was removed to
London. The artists and connoisseurs soon perceived,
by the form of the chest and the outlines of the body,
that the statue, although in the dress of a woman,
represented a personage of the other sex; and as
Bacchus is fabled to have been clothed in a girl's
dress, from his earliest infancy, by Mercury; as the
lion's skin was worn by him; as the skin is confined
by a broad belt, which is alluded to by ancient poets as
part of his costume; and as he is frequently represented
similarly habited in other ancient sculptures-this
figure has been decided to represent Bacchus, the God
of Joy.

<p><figure id="fig.043" n="2001.03.0045"><head>Statue of Icarus</head></figure>

<p>THIS is a statue of a youth of the size of life. It is
imperfect, having lost the head, both arms from the
elbows, and the ancle of the right leg; but sufficient
remains to exhibit the fine character of the workmanship. A belt passes over the shoulders and under the
left arm, used perhaps to attach the wings to the body.
<p>It is 4 feet 4 inches in height, exclusive of the
plinth. Lawrence, in his work on the Elgin Marbles,
speaks of it as a statue from one of the pediments of
the Parthenon: but whether it originally belonged to
that temple or not, we have no means of knowing.
It was found in the Acropolis, in fragments, which
were gathered together and shipped for England; but
it was not till long after its arrival in the British
Museum that these were set up as a statue.
<p>A comparison of this statue with a bas-relief in the
collection at the Villa Albani leaves no doubt that it
is a statue of Icarus; and it seems not improbable that
it once formed part of a group of Daedalus and
Icarus.
<p>Icarus was the son of Daedalus, an Athenian artificer of great dexterity, who invented the saw, the axe,
sails for ships, &amp;c. Daedalus being confined with his
son by Minos king of Crete, he made wings for both
with wax and feathers; with these wings he effected
his escape to Sardinia, and thence to Cuma; but Icarus,
disregarding the advice of his father, mounted so high
in the air that the sun melted the wax with which the
wings were constructed, and caused him to fall into the
sea, between Mycone and Gyaros, which, from him,
was thence called the Icarian Sea.

<p><figure id="fig.036" n="2001.03.0038"><head>Caryatide from the Temple of Pandrosos</head></figure>

<p>THE Temple of Pandrosos is a small building situated
about 160 feet to the north of the Temple of the Parthenon. It is of the Ionic order, and was built some
time before the Parthenon, the name of the architect,
according to an ancient inscription of the same age
as that of the temple, being Philocles of Acharnae,
of whom, however, we know nothing further; for,
although the edifice itself bears ample testimony to
his excellence, we are not aware of his having been
ever mentioned in the text of any ancient author.
This temple has its northern portico ornamented with
six Ionic columns, but in its southern portico there
were, instead of columns, six female figures, called
Caryatides. We have elsewhere mentioned that Vitruvius supposes that the Athenians endeavoured, by
this device, to perpetuate the infamy of the inhabitants
of Carya, the only Peloponnesian city who sided with
Xerxes in his invasion of Greece. They were condemned to the most servile employments, and the
women of rank and family forced, in this abject condition, to wear their ancient dresses and ornaments.
But this supposition has met with few supporters,
indeed it is generally rejected as absurd. They have
been supposed by others to represent Athenian
virgins, bearing on their heads the sacred vases for the
ceremonies of the sacrifice; and it is probable that the
Greeks derived the idea from Egypt. This Caryatide
(No. 128) is rather more than 7 feet high. It is in a
harder style of sculpture than the draped statues of
the Parthenon, but it is still grand in execution.
<p>In St. Pancras Church, London, there are two projecting parts from the body of the church, at the
extremity of each side of the building, which are
supported by Caryatide figures, similarly to the Grecian Temple of Pandrosos.

<p><figure id="fig.045" n="2001.03.0047"><head>Supposed Representation of the Battle of Marathon</head></figure>

<p>THIS is one of a series of casts from the metopes of
the Temple of Theseus, supposed to represent the
battle of Marathon. The Temple of Theseus was
erected about 467 years B.C., in honour of Theseus
the Athenian hero. Theseus was the son of AEgeus
king of Athens, and was related to Hercules, whom
he held in great esteem and appears to have adopted as
his model through life, which was one series of splendid
exploits, among which were the conquest of the Amazons, the conquest of Thebes, and the defeat of the
Centaurs, a barbarous people of Thessaly, celebrated
for their management of the horse.   He did not
receive divine honours until nearly eight centuries
after his death; several circumstances at last induced
the Athenians to honour him as a demi-god, and
amongst the rest was the report that his spectre had
been seen rushing before the Athenians in the battle
of Marathon, and contributing to the victory. Upon
this the oracle of Delphi was consulted, and the
Athenians were commanded to collect his bones and
keep them sacred. The exact spot where they lay
was unknown, but he was believed to have been buried
in the Isle of Scyros in the AEgean Sea. Cymon, the
son of Miltiades, one day saw an eagle upon a rising
ground in the island, pecking at the earth with her
beak, and tearing it with her talons; and upon digging
on the spot he found the body of a warrior of more
than ordinary size. This he considered to be the
remains of Theseus, and, having embarked the relics
in a galley, he carried them to Athens, where they
were received by the inhabitants with transports.
Games and festivals were instituted, and the temple
from which these casts were taken was erected to his
honour.

<p><figure id="fig.046" n="2001.03.0048"><head>Battle of Marathon</head></figure>

<p>THE original sculptures from which these casts were
taken formed the metopes or spaces between the
triglyphs or projecting ornaments on the frieze of the
Temple of Theseus. The subject which this portion
represents appears to be the battle of Marathon, in
which the Athenians obtained a splendid victory over
the Persians. The figure to the left, habited in a long
robe, which is flying backwards, and thus giving an
appearance of velocity in the movement of the figure,
is conjectured to be the phantom of Theseus, who was
believed by the soldiers to have appeared in the heat
of the battle, leading them forward and assisting in
the destruction of the enemy. The stature of this
figure is greater than that of the other figures introduced, and he is in the act of hurling a large stone
among his opponents. This miraculous apparition on
that memorable occasion was firmly believed by the
Athenians, and was one inducement to their building
a temple. The subject has been differently considered
by other writers. Colonel Leake supposed it to represent the battle of the giants, who were said to have
hurled whole mountains against the gods, and to have
been subdued chiefly through the exertions of Hercules. The immense stones which the combatants
hurl at each other favours this idea.
<p>The height of the frieze is 2 feet 9 inches, and it
was seen at an elevation of about 19 feet, which is
much lower than that of the Temple of the Parthenon.

<p>THE casts from the sculptures on the frieze of the
west end of the Temple of Theseus represented the
combat of the Centaurs and the Lapithae. These are
placed in the new room of the Elgin Collection, at the
end of the eastern wall. The height is the same as
that of the sculptures of the eastern frieze, 2 feet 9
inches. No. 152, which we have selected as a specimen
both of the subject and the style of sculpture, represents the death of Caeneus, who, according to the fable,
had received the gift from Neptune of being invulnerable by weapons. He was at last killed by being
overwhelmed by a large pile of trees, with which he
was pressed into the earth. Some poets feign that he
was then changed into a bird. In the frieze he appears half sunk into the earth, resisting, under a
shield, the weight of a mass of rock which is pressed
upon him by two centaurs.
<p>The Temple of Theseus was situated about 500 yards
to the north-east of the Parthenon. It is a beautiful
specimen of the Doric order, and afforded the model
from which the larger Temple of the Parthenon was
constructed about 30 years after the original was completed.  This building has suffered less from  the
calamities attendant on warfare than the Parthenon,
in consequence of its distance from the Acropolis, or
citadel, on which the fire of the Turks was principally
directed.  Traces of paint are still perceptible on
many of the sculptures of this temple. The practice
of painting the friezes, &amp;c., of Greek Temples appears
to have been very common.

<p><figure id="fig.067" n="2001.03.0069"><head>Contest of Centaurs and Lapithae</head></figure>

<p>THIS cast represents a portion of the subject with
which these friezes were sculptured-the contest of
the Centaurs and Lapithae. A Lapitha, helmeted,
appears to be overthrowing a centaur, against whom
he presses with his shield. The figure to the left has
his attention directed to the group in No. 152, representing the death of Caeneus.
<p>The spectator will not fail to observe that the figures
from the sculptures of the Temple of Theseus in some
parts project nearly six inches from the tablets; a
circumstance very unfavourable to the preservation
of the originals. Several figures, and different portions
of the groups, have disappeared from the building,
from either violence or the effect of weather since the
time when Stuart made his drawings, about the middle
of the last century. The Temple of Theseus is now a
church, dedicated to St. George, for whom the present
Athenians have as high a veneration as their ancestors
had for Theseus. It is owing to this appropriation,
and to the natural dislike of the Greeks to the church
being injured, as well as from the comparatively perfect state in which the temple existed, that the Elgin
collection possesses only casts from, and not the
original marbles of those portions of the friezes and
metopes, which have been described. Other sculptured
metopes, of which Lord Elgin did not take casts, still
remain upon the temple; though it is necessary to
observe that only eighteen out of sixty-eight metopes
which adorned the temple were sculptured. All the
others remain plain and unornamented.

<head>Combat between the Greeks and Persians.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.044" n="2001.03.0046"><head>Combat between the Greeks and Persians</head></figure>

<p>ON the steps which led to the higher part of the
Acropolis stood a small Ionic temple, called that of
Apteral Victory, or Victory without wings, in which
state the goddess was frequently depicted by the Athenians, to intimate that they held her gifts in perpetuity,
and that she could not desert them. The temple itself
has long disappeared, the only remains being some
bas-reliefs of its frieze built into the wall of a gunpowder magazine, the finest block being inverted.
In this condition they remained till Lord Elgin's visit
to Athens, who brought four of them away. These
are now let into the wall on the right and left of the
entrance-door in the new Elgin Room in the British
Museum.
<p>The subject represented on two of them (158 &amp; 159,
of which we have given as a specimen the half of
159) appears to be a combat between the Greeks and
Persians. The bas-reliefs are seventeen inches high.
The Athenians are all on foot; they have helmets and
large circular shields, and wear the chlamys or cloak.
The Persians are habited in long garments, fastened
with zones or belts round their bodies, and the head
covered with a cloth cap. Some of them are mounted
on horseback.
<p>The composition of these works is of great beauty,
but they have received considerable injury.
<p>The two other bas-reliefs, mentioned above, are supposed to represent combats of Athenians against the
Greeks, as the figures are all similar in dress and
character. They are marked 160 and 161. In size
they correspond to the two others, being 17 inches in
height.

<head>Sepulchral Vases.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.047" n="2001.03.0049"><head>Sepulchral Vases</head></figure>

<p>THE custom of placing vases with the dead was of very
ancient date. It is mentioned by Homer and by many
other authors. The character of these vases of course
varied with the rank and wealth of the deceased, and
the relatives who performed the funeral obsequies.
Some are of poor materials, and destitute of ornament;
others are of marble, alabaster, &amp;c., and often richly
decorated with sculptures of great merit, which generally had reference to the life of the deceased, or to
the actions in which he had been engaged. Many
vases found in sepulchres appear to have been those
gained by the deceased person himself as prizes in
gymnastic exercises, or as choragic rewards, &amp;c.,
whence the variety of illustrations observable on them.
The Elgin collection, however, contains no specimen
of these prize-vases. The urns (from which we copy
three as specimens) are simply commemorative of
persons whose history and actions are unknown to us,
though perhaps well known to their contemporaries.
<p>No. 182 is a solid monumental urn, on the front
of which is a bas-relief consisting of three figures, one
of which is a female seated; the others, a male and
female, stand opposite. The inscription presents us
with the names of the persons represented-Archagora,
Pithillis, and Polystratus.
<p>No. 230. A solid sepulchral urn, the bas-relief of
which is very rude in workmanship. It appears to
represent a warrior taking leave of his family. Over
the warrior is the name of Sosippus in Greek letters.
<p>No. 275. The bas-relief on this urn represents two
figures standing with the hands joined; and two other
figures at the sides, apparently attendants, are standing in a pensive or afflicted posture. The names of
the two principal figures are Demostrate and Callisto.

<head>The Sun-Dial of Phaedrus.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.053" n="2001.03.0055"><head>The Sun-Dial of Phaedrus</head></figure>

<p>THIS monument consists of four different dials represented on as many faces; it was found at Athens in
the court of the church of the Virgin, called Panagia
Gorgopiko, to which place it was said to have been
brought from the Acropolis, but this is believed to be
untrue. From its form we might suppose that it had
served to show the hour in one of the cross-ways of
Athens. A short inscription on the exterior of the
face of this dial, to the left of the spectator, preserves
the name of the mathematician who constructed it:
<quote>"Phaedrus, the son of Zoilus, a Paenian, made this."</quote>
<p>The invention of sun-dials is of very ancient date,
and perhaps few instruments have undergone more
important changes and improvements in form, although the principle of their construction has ever
been the same. The sun-dial of Ahaz is mentioned in
the scriptures (<bibl>2 Kings xx.</bibl>, and <bibl>Isaiah xxxviii</bibl>) as existing about 700 years before the Christian era; but as
the division of time is of great importance in carrying
on the business of life, and as the sun must have been
observed to attain certain positions in the heavens,
day after day, with unvarying regularity, thus affording a means of calculating time, it is highly probable
that some manner of sun-dial was invented long
before the existence of such an instrument was recorded.
<p>The Athenians calculated the day to continue from
one sunset to the succeeding sunset, the interval being
divided into equal portions. Sun-dials, however, do
not appear to have been common with the ancients, as
even the wealthy classes were in the habit of sending
boys to the public dials to ascertain the time. We are
almost led to believe, from passages in ancient authors,
that the principal use of these instruments was to
warn people of the approach of the dinner-hour. It
is related that Epicurus, the Grecian philosopher, on
seeing a dial, exclaimed-<quote>"What a fine invention to
hinder us from forgetting to dine!"</quote>

<head>Votive Offerings; From the Pnyx.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.063" n="2001.03.0065"><head>Votive Offerings; From the Pnyx</head></figure>

<p>THE Greeks offered other presents to the gods besides
sacrifices: some to appease their anger, others to conciliate future favour; and a third class, to which the
present votive offerings belong, either as prayers for
the cure of diseases, or as presents of gratitude for
cures received. This class usually consisted of representations of those parts of the human body which
were afflicted with maladies, or had been healed of such.
Besides the temples the Greeks seem occasionally to
have deposited these memorials of their gratitude in
votive rocks, such as that called the Pnyx, situated a
little to the west of the Acropolis of Athens. In this
rock, which is partly artificial, there are several small
cavities, or niches, from which the votive offerings
about to be enumerated were taken.
<p>No. 209. This is a representation in bas-relief of the
female breast, and from the inscription appears to be
the offering of a person named Isias. It measures
7 3/4 inches by 6 inches.
<p>No. 210 is an offering similar to the above, from a
lady named Euthychis. It measures 6 inches by 5 1/2.
<p>No. 211. This also is similar. The inscription literally expresses, <quote>"Onesime her vow to Zeus (Jupiter)

<p><figure id="fig.049" n="2001.03.0051"><head>Amphorae</head></figure>

<p>AMPHORA,in its most ordinary acceptation, means an
earthen vessel used to contain liquids, deriving its
name from being furnished with two handles. It varied
in size and height, according to the purpose for which
it was intended, but generally it may be said to have
been from 6 inches to 3 or 4 feet in height, preserving a due proportion in breadth. The Amphora
generally tapered towards the lower part almost to a
point, so that it could only be kept upright by being
kept in a perforated stand, or inserted in some soft
material, like sand, or fixed in a low tripod, which was
sometimes used.
<p>The Grecian <hi rend=italic>Amphora</hi>, as a <hi rend=italic>measure</hi>, contained
three Roman <hi rend=italic>urnae</hi>, equal to about 10 gallons 5 1/2 pints
of English wine-measure. The Roman Amphora contained two urnae, about 7 gallons 1 pint English,
and the present Venetian Amphora contains about 4
gallons.
<p>The Amphora was also used by the ancients as a
dry measure, and contained, with the Romans, about
three bushels.
<p>The term Amphora is now applied to vessels of
different forms and capacities; but the Romans kept
a model of their Amphora (as a <hi rend=italic>measure</hi>) in the capitol, in the same manner as we formerly kept our
standard weights and measures in the Exchequer, so
that all should be of the same size.
<p>There are four in the Elgin Collection, of which we
present the reader with two, (Nos. 238 and 344,) on
both of which may be observed an inscription stamped
on the neck, either the name of the maker or the place
in which they were manufactured.

<p>THESE <hi rend=italic>stelae</hi>, or columns, were little blocks of stone
sculptured, and generally containing an inscription,
which were set up as memorials, generally of the dead,
being in many respects similar to our tombstones.
They are common all over Greece, and are sometimes
met with without any inscription, but generally ornamented with a patera, or vase. By a decree of Demetrius Phalereus, they were not to be more than three
cubits high (about 5 1/2 feet).
<p>These sepulchral stele were ornamented with
mouldings when square, and when round they are
generally found terminated in a rounded or peaked
top. They were placed on little mounds of earth, and
are mentioned by Homer in the <bibl>Iliad (Book xvi. verse
457</bibl>) as the "fit honours of the dead."
<p>There are in the Elgin Collection a considerable
number of these stele, from which we have selected
three as specimens.
<p>No. 258. This is the upper part of a sepulchral stele,
surmounted with a fleuron, or ornament of leaves of
plants; it is inscribed to the memories of Asclepiodorus the son of Thrason, and of Epicydes the son of
Asclepiodorus, natives of Olynthus in Macedonia.
This fragment is let into the wall of the room.
<p>No. 290. The upper part of a stele, ornamented with
leaves and flowers. It bears the name of Chabrias;
but the second word, which was probably the name of
his town, has four letters only remaining. Below the
inscription two double-lined paterae (cups, or vases) are
represented.
<p>No. 351. A sepulchral stele, the top ornamented with
a fleuron. The inscription bears the names Hippocrates and Baucis. This stele is let into the wall of
the room, as is also the one abovementioned (No. 290).

<head>Casts from the Bas-Reliefs of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.056" n="2001.03.0058"><head>Casts from the Monument of Lysicrates</head></figure>

<p>THE Choragic monument of Lysicrates, known also
by the appellation of the Lantern of Demosthenes
(there is an unfounded story current at Athens that it
was built by the orator for a place of retirement and
study), was built, as we learn from an inscription on
its frieze, about 335 years B.C.
<p>This is a monument erected by Lysicrates, a Choragus, or leader of the chorus in dramatic representations,
in commemoration of having obtained the tripod, or
reward given by the people of Athens to him who had
presented them with the best musical or theatrical
entertainment. This monument is the oldest specimen
now remaining of the Corinthian order, and perhaps
the best. The upper part forms a small room, not
quite six feet in diameter; and the roof, which is in
the form of a low cupola, consists of a single mass.
<p>The figures which decorate the frieze of this monument are sculptured in half-relief, and are 9 1/2 inches
in height. The subject is the story of Bacchus and
the Tyrrhenian pirates, which is told nearly as follows
by the ancients. Bacchus hired a ship belonging to
some Tyrrhenian corsairs, intending to be conveyed
from the island of Icaria to Naxos, but the pirates
directed their course towards the coast of Asia, where
they intended to sell him for a slave. Bacchus, aware
of their meditated treachery, transformed the masts
and oars into snakes, and filled the ship with ivy and
the music of pipes; whilst the corsairs, seized with
frenzy, threw themselves into the sea and were changed
into dolphins.
<p>There is a difference, however, in the story of the
transformation as told upon the present bas-reliefs.
The corsairs are not on ship-board but on land, where
they are punished.

<p><figure id="fig.055" n="2001.03.0057"><head>Casts from the Monument of Lysicrates</head></figure>

<p>THIS is the centre of the composition and of the nine
compartments of which the Museum casts consist.
The peculiar shape of these reliefs is owing to their
having been sculptured for a small circular temple.
In this cast, Bacchus appears seated upon a rock, with
his panther before him; he is represented larger in
size than any of the other figures, a practice which
was often pursued by ancient sculptors to give more
dignity and importance to their principal characters.
It was also adopted by the early actors, who not only
wore large masks on their faces, but increased their
height by means of a high shoe, called <hi rend=italic>cothurnus</hi>, or
buskin. A faun is seated by the side of Bacchus,
bearing the thyrsus (the spear bound with ivy) on his
right shoulder; and on the opposite side is another
faun seated, holding one knee clasped in his hands.
In this series of casts the whole punishment of the
pirates is shown by different attitudes and circumstances. One of them is just knocked down; another
has his hands tied behind him. Others are beaten
and tormented in various manners; and in 352, 353,
and 359, we behold them leaping into the sea, and
becoming metamorphosed into dolphins, the change
beginning at the head. One of the pirates sits upon
a rock by the sea-side, his arms bound behind him
with a cord, which, at the period represented on the
sculpture, has just changed into a serpent of enormous
size, and appears to have seized his shoulder with its
fangs.
<p>The transformation of the Tyrrhenian pirates by
Bacchus was a favourite subject with the painters and
sculptors of Athens.

<p><figure id="fig.054" n="2001.03.0056"><head>Casts from the Monument of Lysicrates</head></figure>

<p>IN this cast, one of the attendants of Bacchus appear
to be in the act of breaking down a branch from
tree, with which to punish one of the pirates, who
escapes only by throwing himself into the sea, where
his transformation into a dolphin immediately com
mences.
<p>It may render these bas-reliefs more interesting i
we add a few remarks on the nature of the duties of
Choragus at Athens.
<p>The Festival of Bacchus, on which occasion the
Temple Lysicrates appears to have been built, was
always celebrated by the Athenians with extraordinary
magnificence; tragedies and comedies were repre
sented in the theatres; and a number of boys and men
were instructed by a person appointed by the Choragus
or chorus-master, to chant hymns in honour of
Bacchus. A Choragus was chosen by each of the ter
tribes of Athens; and when the festival drew near, ar
emulous contention arose among these Choragi, which
sometimes proceeded to great violence, each striving
to excel his competitors, and to obtain the tripod
which was the prize to be gained by that Choragus
who should produce the best hymn and conduct the
chorus in the most approved style. These Chorag
appear to have been at all the expense of hiring and
dressing the chorus, who were oftentimes richly deco.
rated with crowns of gold and other ornaments. But
their expenditure did not end here, for he who wor
the tripod was expected to dedicate it to the deity ir
whose honour the festival had been held; and very
often the prize was preserved in a little edifice of
temple (as in this instance), which was built and the
cost defrayed by the successful competitor. Nor shall
we wonder that the honour of gaining a tripod was so
anxiously and earnestly contended for, since thus won
and dedicated, it became a family honour, and was
appealed to as an authentic testimony of the merits
and virtue of the person who obtained it.

<p><figure id="fig.030" n="2001.03.0031"><head>Contest of the Centaurs and Lapithae</head></figure>

<p>THE bas-reliefs known under this title were discovered
in the year <datestruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></datestruct>, by four gentlemen, in the ruins of a
temple situated at a short distance from Panlizza,
believed to have been the ancient town of Phigaleia, in
Arcadia. This temple, called that of Apollo Epicurius
the Deliverer, because they believed that god to have
relieved their city from the affliction of a pestilence, was
built by Ictinus, the architect of the Parthenon. The
sculptures, which had fallen from the walls, where they
originally formed the frieze, consisted, when found,
of twenty-three slabs, 2 feet 1 1/4 inch high, and of an
average length of 4 feet 5 inches. The Phigaleian
Marbles were purchased, by order of the Prince Regent of England, at Zante, in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, at the expense of
15,000<hi rend=italic>l</hi>., increased by a very unfavourable exchange
to the sum of 19,000<hi rend=italic>l</hi>. They were paid for out of the
Droits of Admiralty, and ordered to be deposited in
the British Museum. They were repaired and placed
in the Museum under the superintendence of Sir
Richard Westmacott.
<p>Two distinct subjects form the composition on these
bas-reliefs; the battle of the Centaurs and Lapithae
(which has been sufficiently explained in treating of
the Metopes of the Parthenon), and the contest of the
Athenians against the Amazons.
<p>We begin with the slab No. 1, the first of the series
of the Battle of the Lapithae and Centaurs. It represents a Centaur overcome and thrown down by two
Lapithae, one of whom, in front, drags the Centaur by
the hair; while the other, placing his right knee on
the Centaur's back, seems preparing to strike a blow,
as if with a sword, but is prevented by a second
Centaur, who arrests the uplifted arm with one hand,
while with the other he seizes the Lapithae's shield.

<p>THESE marbles are placed in the apartment leading
into the Elgin Saloon. In this bas-relief a Centaur
has seized a Lapitha by the head and left arm, and is
tearing the throat of his adversary with his teeth; the
Lapitha, at the same moment, thrusts a sword into
the body of the Centaur. The agony occasioned by the
thrust causes the Centaur to throw out his hind legs,
which beat against a shield held forward by another
Lapitha for his protection. In the foreground below,
a second Centaur is lying dead.
<p>The whole of these sculptures had fallen from the
frieze where they had been originally placed, and
were found shattered into a great number of fragments; but, by the patience and perseverance of those
by whom they were discovered, the minutest portions
were sought for amongst the surrounding rubbish of
the temple, and when the whole were replaced they
rendered the bas-reliefs so complete that no restoration
was necessary to make the subjects intelligible.
<p>The discoverers and proprietors of these marbles
were-C. R. Cockerell, Esq., J. Foster, Esq., M. Charles
Haller de Hallestein, M. Jaques Linkh, and a Prussian
gentleman of the name of Gropius.
<p>In its original position the Phigaleian frieze stood
at the height of twenty feet six inches above the
pavement of the temple, and received its light from
above. The number of bas-reliefs appears to have been
originally twenty-four, but one had disappeared at the
time of the above-mentioned gentlemen's visit to the
temple, and consequently only twenty-three were
brought to England. These are imperfect, but are
not so much defaced as to prevent the recognition of
the subjects.

<head>Contest of the Lapithae and Centaurs.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.032" n="2001.03.0033"><head>Contest of the Lapithae and Centaurs</head></figure>

<p>THIS slab is a continuation of the subject of the contest of the Lapithae and Centaurs, which it will be
remembered took place at the marriage feast of Pirithous king of the Lapithae. On the left of the bas-relief a female is endeavouring to escape from the
attacks of a Centaur, who is pulling her towards him
by the arm and neck: she carries a child in her left
arm, who buries its head in its mother's bosom with
every expression of fear. On the other side, a Centaur,
having deprived an Athenian, or Lapitha, of his
shield, appears to be pressing him to the earth, while
the Lapitha endeavours, by seizing the lion's skin
fastened around the neck of the Centaur, to pull him
to the ground with him.
<p>In these bas-reliefs no weapons (except stones)
appear to be used by the Centaurs, but the Lapithae
seem to have been partly armed, as they nearly all
bear shields, and, from the position of the arms in
certain of the slabs, we may suppose them to have
used swords; in No. 2 the sword is shown, but in the
other slabs they were probably of bronze, as holes
are still perceptible in which they might have been
fastened. The Centaurs have only a lion's skin
fastened by the fore-legs around their necks, while
the rest of the skin takes the form of a floating drapery. The dress of the Lapithae consists of a cloak,
fastened by a brooch, or button, in front, and commonly represented floating behind them. In the
present slab, No. 3, the Lapitha who has been beaten
down on one knee is habited in a cuirass and tunic.

<head>Contest between the Athenians and Amazons.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.031" n="2001.03.0032"><head>Contest between the Athenians and Amazons</head></figure>

<p>THIS slab is the first of the series depicting the contest
of the Athenians and Amazons. An Athenian to the
left is in the act of dragging an Amazon, who has
fallen, by the hair; while on the other side two
Amazons appear, one of whom is protecting the other
with a shield.
<p>The Amazons were a race of warlike women, said
to have established a republic into which no males
were admitted. According to their fabulous history,
they came from Scythia, afterwards dwelt in Pontus,
and in course of time spread themselves over a great
part of Asia Minor; they built numerous cities, and
carried their hostilities into different and distant
countries. Among other opponents they warred with
Theseus the Athenian hero; and this was the contest
which the Greeks so often portrayed both in sculpture and painting. The Amazons are usually supposed
to have undergone the loss of their right breasts, that
they might draw the bow with the greater force; but
they are represented on the Phigaleian frieze, to all
appearance, with both breasts; although generally
one is exposed whilst the other is covered with the
drapery. If these sculptures represent their costume
correctly, it is probable that it was from this custom
that the fable of their having but one breast took its
origin.
<p>In this slab (No. 12) each of the Amazons has a belt
around her waist, and wears tight boots coming up
near to the knee. The shield behind the prostrate
figure to the left is of the description called <hi rend=italic>pultae</hi>,
having a semicircular portion cut out of the upper
edge, by which to view the adversary.

<p><figure id="fig.022" n="2001.03.0023"><head>Contest between the Athenians and Amazons</head></figure>

<p>THIS, which is the longest slab in the collection, is one
of the most interesting on account of its beauty, the
diversity of action which it represents, and the comparatively perfect state in which it appears. On the
left side of the composition an Athenian appears lying
on the ground beneath the horse of an Amazon, whose
arm appears to be upraised in the act of striking her
prostrate foe.  In the centre, a figure with a lion's
skin thrown across his arm is fighting with an Amazon clad in a long robe, and carrying a shield on her
left arm. The Athenian has been supposed to represent Theseus, on account both of his Herculean
stature and the skin of the lion which he wears. To
the right of this group we observe an Athenian in the
act of removing the dead body of an Amazon, whom he
has killed, from her horse, which has fallen beneath
her. The upper part of the body of the Amazon on
horseback has disappeared (with the exception of part
of the arms), but the rest of the composition is very
nearly perfect, and affords a splendid example of the
perfection which the ancients had attained in the art
of design.
<p>In this sculpture there are many varieties of costume: the fallen Athenian wears a helmet of a peculiar
shape; Theseus is clothed only in the lion's skin;
while the Athenian to the right wears the <hi rend=italic>chlamys</hi>, or
short cloak, fastened on the chest with a brooch. The
Amazons are habited in long robes, with boots reaching nearly to the knee, and one appears to have a
close-fitting helmet on her head. This sculpture, as
also No. 17, represents the horses of the Amazons, in
the management of which they were very expert.

<p>THIS is the last of the series of the frieze in the collection, but we have already stated that another slab
(making the 24th) did originally stand on the frieze
of the temple, although it had disappeared when
the others were discovered. The first figure to the
left in this tablet is that of an Amazon supplicating
another, who appears about to give the death-blow to
a fallen Athenian, to spare his life. On the right of
the tablet an Amazon is represented supporting a
companion who seems to be wounded and dying.
<p>We have now given copies of six of these marbles
as specimens of the sculptures, and would recommend

they abound in the greatest beauties of design and
execution.
<p>The following extract from a letter of Mr. C. R.
Cockerell, one of the discoverers of these marbles,
relating to their removal, which took place during his
absence on a voyage to Sicily, will be interesting to all
who feel an interest in the sculptures:-<quote>"How much
I regret," he says, " that I was not of that delightful
party at Phigaleia, which amounted to above fifteen
persons! On the top of Mount Cotylium, whence
there is a grand prospect over all Arcadia, they established themselves for three months, building
round the temple huts covered with boughs of trees,
until they had almost formed a village. They had
frequently fifty or eighty men at work in the temple,
and a band of Arcadian music was constantly playing
to entertain this numerous assemblage: when evening
put an end to work, dances and songs commenced,
lambs were roasted whole on a long wooden spit, and
the whole scene, in such a situation, at such an interesting time, when every day some new and beautiful work of the best age of sculpture was brought
to light, is hardly to be imagined. Apollo must have
wondered at the carousals which disturbed his long
repose, and have thought his glorious days of old were
returned."</quote><note type=foot n=1><bibl>Hughes' Travels in Greece, 8vo., 1830, vol. i. p. 194.</bibl></note>

chorus at some festival.
<p>With respect to the removal of these marbles of
Phigaleia, Mr. Cockerell says, <quote>"The success of our
enterprise astonished every one; and in all the circumstances connected with it, good fortune attended
us. Just at this time Vely Pasha was removed from
his government: we should have been much embarrassed by our agreement with him, which made him
proprietor of half the marbles, but he was now very
glad to sell us his share; and scarcely were the treasures put on board a vessel, ere the officers of the new
Pasha came down to the port with the intention of
seizing the whole; but they were then safe."</quote><note type=foot n=1><bibl>Hughes's Travels in Greece, vol. i. p. 194.</bibl></note>
<p>These marbles, as likewise those of the Elgin Collection, are distinguished by their general excellence
as works of art, and by the unity of their character.
They belong to a period in the history of sculpture
which has been acknowledged by all succeeding ages
as the greatest epoch in the history of the art.
<p>The friend of Grecian learning will here find a lively
comment on what he reads; and as in the best and
scarcest models of antiquity we always discover something new to admire, so here we find fresh beauties
at every visit, and learn how infinite in variety are
simplicity and truth. As specimens of sculpture they
serve as excellent studies to young artists; whose taste
is formed and chastened by the purity of the models
presented to them. Thus the artist and the man of
letters will equally feel a delight in viewing these
monuments of art, both from the excellence of the
sculptures themselves, and the delightful associations
to which they give rise.

<head>Head of a Ram and Figure of a Sphinx.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.005" n="2001.03.0006"><head>Head of a Ram and Figure of a Sphinx</head></figure>

<p>WHAT is commonly called a sphinx is a figure compounded of the head of one animal, and the body of
another, as the body and legs of a lion with the head
of a man or woman. This appears to have been the
most common form in Egypt, but there are others
found there with the body of a lion united to the head
of a ram, and it is from a specimen of this kind of
sphinx that the colossal ram's head in the British
Museum (No. 7) was originally procured. These have
obtained the name of crio-sphinxes, and in Egypt
there is an avenue, leading from Luxor to Carnak,
formed by a row of such sphinxes of colossal dimensions. This ram's head was one of the objects collected
by the French in Egypt, and which afterwards fell
into the hands of the English in consequence of the
capitulation of Alexandria in <datestruct value="1801--"><year reg="1801">1801</year></datestruct>. It is made of an
exceedingly soft sandstone, of a dirty yellow colour,
and on the top of the head there is an irregular oblong
hole, about 7 1/2 inches long and 4 deep. The length of
the face, measured from about the centre of this hole
to the mouth, along the curve of the face, is 3 feet
6 inches. The length of the ear that is entire, or
nearly so, is 1 foot, and the length of the left horn
measured along its outer curve surface, about 4 feet
11 inches. The strict resemblance which this head
presents to the African sheep of the present day, and
the mild and tranquil expression of the face, are very
remarkable.
<p>The sphinx, marked No. 11, is one of several small
specimens which the Museum possesses. It represents the body of a lion, to which is attached the head
of a hawk, having a head-dress similar to those worn
by the early Egyptians. Its length is 41 inches, by
16 1/2 inches in height. It was brought by Belzoni from
the interior of the Temple of Ipsambul in the interior
of Egypt, which was opened by him at the expense of
Mr. Salt, from whose collection it came into the
British Museum.

<head>Sarcophagus.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.008" n="2001.03.0009"><head>Egyptian Sarcophagus</head></figure>

<p>IT is well known that the Egyptians had a peculiar
mode of preserving the bodies of their dead, which
does not appear to have been practised but by a very
few other nations. They embalmed the bodies of their
deceased friends by immersing them in a solution of
nitre for about seventy days, and filling the interior
parts with aromatics; they then wrapped them tightly
in several long rolls of cloth prepared with asphaltum;
and when dry enclosed them in a box of thin wood of
the form of the body, often ornamented with paintings and hieroglyphics; and this again was enclosed
in a similar box. But in the case of deceased kings,
or high official dignitaries, it appears to have been
customary to preserve the mummy (as the embalmed
body is called) in a stone coffin, or sarcophagus, many
specimens of which are in the British Museum. The
most curious, as a work of art, is that marked No. 10.
It fell into the hands of the English, at the capitulation of Alexandria, having been found by the French
in the Court of the Mosque of St. Athanasius in that
city. It is cut in a breccia, similar to what the Italians
call "breccia verde," composed of fragments of granite
and porphyry, of brilliant and varied colours. It
measures in length about 10 feet 3 inches; in width
4 feet 2 inches at the feet, and about 5 feet 4 inches at
the head; and is about 3 feet 9 inches in depth. In
thickness it varies from about 9 to 10 inches.
<p>This sarcophagus is completely covered, both in the
interior and exterior, with a multitude of small sculptured figures, of which there are no. less than 21,700 ;
in many parts 10 to 15 hieroglyphics are carved in a
square inch. It was thought by Dr. Clarke to have
been the sarcophagus which contained the body of
Alexander the Great; but other antiquarians, although
they admit that in the course of the many transitions
from one tomb to another, which the body of Alexander is recorded to have suffered, it is barely possible
that it may have once contained the remains of the
king; yet they adduce many circumstances to disprove
the supposition of its being the original sarcophagus
of the Grecian conqueror.

<head>Egyptian Altar.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.001" n="2001.03.0001"><head>Egyptian Altar</head></figure>

<p>THIS, which is commonly called an Altar, is a four-
sided block of beautiful red granite, diminishing
slightly towards the top, on two faces of which there
are placed single figures, and on the two other faces
two figures placed side by side. These six figures
have the hands slightly outstretched, so that they
appear to touch one another. The height, as it now
stands, is about 5 feet 6 inches. The single figures at
the two ends are similar, being females, each with a
long vest descending nearly to the feet: the head-dress hangs down as usual on each side of the face
over the chest, terminating just above the breasts.
The head is surmounted by a pair of cows' horns, surrounding a disk, whence these figures are supposed
to represent some of the officiating personages in the
worship of Isis, one of the Egyptian deities, who was
frequently worshipped under the form of a cow. The
corresponding figures on the two long sides are
similar: one is a male, in very high relief, with remarkably fine rounded arms and chest; unfortunately,
in one case, the leg that projects in advance of the
other, and the head are gone; and in the other the
head, and the projecting leg, below the knee, are lost.
Next to the male figure, on each of the long sides,
is another male, with the face of a hawk, surmounted
by a high flat cap and a couple of serpents. This
mass of granite and the figures are beautifully polished.
There is a cartouche on each long side over the male
head which has had the high cap, consisting of a dirk,
comb, and beetle. Other hieroglyphics are represented
in our wood-cut.
<p>This block was found by the French, among some
ruins in the palace of Carnak, but they found such
difficulty in the attempt to remove it that they abandoned it; and it was afterwards brought from Egypt
by Belzoni. A drawing was made of it by the French
when it was nearly perfect, and it is probable that
the injuries it has received in their attempts to remove
it might be repaired from that drawing.

<head>A Colossal Head in a Mitre.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.012" n="2001.03.0013"><head>A Colossal Head in a Mitre</head></figure>

<p>THIS stands opposite to the Memnon (No. 19), and was
brought to England by Belzoni in 1818. It was
found at Carnak, on the east side of the Nile, but at
what precise spot we are unable to say. It is of red
granite, polished to a wonderful degree of smoothness,
and well preserved, except the left ear and part of
the chin, which, together with the beard, is broken off.
Though the head is of somewhat larger dimensions
than the Memnon (being 10 feet high from the neck
to the top of the mitre), it was much easier to transport it from its place, as the shoulders are not
attached to the neck, and in consequence the whole
mass is not so heavy as the Memnon.
<p>In the Museum there is a colossal arm (No. 18)
(about 10 feet in length), originally belonging to this
figure, and from which we are enabled to judge of the
position of the statue when entire. From the arm
being straight, and from the fracture on the under
part, apparently once joined to the sides of the figure,
we may conclude that the head formed part of a
colossal standing statue, which could not have been
less in height than 26 feet, or nearly twice the height
of the Achilles in Hyde Park. With the exception of
a small portion of the top, which is broken off, but
still occupying its place, the cap is entire. It is
fastened on in the usual way with standing colossi,
by a bandage on each side, coming down to the chin,
where they met the beard-case, which appears to have
been attached to these bandages. In the front appears
the serpent, the Egyptian emblem of royalty, which,
although mutilated, is sufficiently apparent.
<p>It is probable that this statue was originally used as
a pillar to support a portion of a large building.

<p><figure id="fig.014" n="2001.03.0015"><head>Colossal Statue of Amenoph III</head></figure>

<p>A COLOSSAL statue of Amenoph III. (Memnon) sitting
with his hands extended on his thighs. He wears a
cap, which, after making two triangular flat projections,
against which the ears rest, descends in a lappet on
each side over the breast. This head-dress at the back
assumes a singular rounded form, marked with a
number of radii, all converging towards a centre at
the nape of the neck, where they unite in a kind of
cylindrical ornament (very like the long pig-tails once
in fashion in Europe) which descends behind the back.
The figure, except the thighs, which appear to be
covered with a kind of cloth resembling corduroy, is
nearly destitute of clothing. The chair on which the
figure is seated is adorned with hieroglyphics, and
with a cartouche bearing the praenomen or title of
the king, followed by his proper name, Amenoph, or,
according to the Greek corrupted term, Memnon.
This statue is very similar to the celebrated statue of
Memnon at Thebes, but is not so large. As a work of
art it is not without merit, considering the early period
at which it was executed, though the legs are somewhat too long, and the arms too short. The hands
too are decidedly bad, but the feet are better. The
most favourable view is a side one which shows the
back part of the arms and the roundness of the
shoulders.

<head>Egyptian Family.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.003" n="2001.03.0003"><head>Egyptian Family</head></figure>

<p>IT is generally assumed, that all Egyptian figures are stiff,
ugly, and devoid of grace, which has been, by some, unjustly
attributed to the alleged want of beauty in the inhabitants.
But the opinion of beauty differs so much among various
families of the human race, that we should be careful lest our
prejudices lead us too far from the truth.  For example,
there is no doubt that among white people generally, especially with the vulgar, the ideas of blackness and ugliness are
inseparable; while it is a well-known fact that among the
blacks white people are viewed with equal dislike; the
standard of beauty being formed by the specimens with which
each is most familiar. Among those who pretend to a refined taste, the productions of Grecian art (as exhibited, for
instance, in the Elgin and Townley apartments of the Museum) have been taken as a standard of beauty by which all
other similar productions should be judged. Compared with
these the Egyptian sculptures will certainly be found to be
deficient in the roundness, grace, and elegance of the Greek ;
yet it should be remembered that the Egyptian artists preceded those of Greece, so that the latter were enabled to profit
by the errors, as well as the successful efforts of their predecessors; while the Egyptians had to work out their conceptions of the perfection of sculpture quite unassisted by the
example of any preceding race of artists. From the uniform
style of Egyptian sculpture, as well as from  some curious
Egyptian drawings extant, showing that the human figure
was drawn according to certain rules, it would appear that the
artists of that country had formed a system of their own, by
which, probably, they hoped to rival-perhaps to excel-even
Nature herself; and their failure must be attributed to this very
cause, rather than to their want of beautiful and appropriate
objects of study; for if, instead of attempting to excel Nature,
they had endeavoured to imitate her, their chances of success
would have been greater.
<p>But to the object before us-this curious group was found in
an Egyptian tomb, where, according to the Egyptian fashion,
the wife and husband were often united after death by the
hands of the sculptor: it represents a male and female seated
on a chair with a child between them. The height is about
2 1/2 feet, and the width of the chair 13 1/2 inches. The figures are
painted in some parts very thickly, and the whole appears to
have been covered with a gum or wax to preserve it. The female
holds in her left hand, resting on her lap, a lotus flower, painted
blue. The colour of the flesh is a red, of a brick-dust hue.
<p>Hieroglyphics may be seen on the legs of each figure, on the
base, just before the feet, and a square, formed of six columns,
on either side of the figures. These are represented in the cut.

<p>The column behind contains a double row of well-
cut hieroglyphics arranged in two vertical compartments. The four sides of the plinth are also covered
with hieroglyphics, as are the sides of the chamber
which contains the small sacred figure The chamber
itself is sunk about 1 1/2 inch below the level of the
framework at the base, but only about 1 inch below
at the top: the figure which it contains is a female
with bare breasts, the arms close to the sides, the feet
and legs in the usual constrained attitude of Egyptian
figures, and a high cap on the head. This sculpture
is cut in a black stone, so close-grained that it looks
almost like a piece of iron, or dark-coloured bronze.
It is supposed to represent a priest presenting the
image of one of the Egyptian deities to the people in
the course of a religious procession. The figure of
the priest is of a better style of sculpture than we
generally see in Egyptian statues, being round and
full in the limbs, while the feet are more true to
nature.

<p><figure id="fig.004a" n="2001.03.0004"><head>Lion Headed Egyptian Figure</head></figure>

<p>THIS is a lion-headed figure (a female) of black granite,
very highly polished. The figure is seated, with the
hands resting on the lap. The left hand holds the
<hi rend=italic>crux ansata</hi>, or cross with a handle, a sacred emblem
with the Egyptians, and sometimes called the sacred
<hi rend=italic>Tau</hi>, from its resemblance to the Greek letter <foreign lang=greek>*t</foreign>.
<p>The head is surmounted by a disk, which is either
sculptured on a separate block, or has been broken off
and replaced.
<p>The margin of the vest which clothes the figure
is very clearly marked with a border at the ankles and
wrists. Just below the breast an ornamental margin
or border encircles the body, and is met by a broader
ornamental bandage, which appears like a continuation of the head-dress, and passes over the breasts to
join the border below them. These two long bandages may be considered as passing over the shoulders
and fitting in a similar way to the same border or
margin behind, which will account for their appearing
to come from under the lappets of the head-dress.
The height of the figure, from the top of the disk to
the bottom of the chair on which it is seated is about
6 feet 6 inches. It was dug up by Belzoni at Thebes.
<p>There are several similar figures in the British
Museum-see Nos. 37, 57, 68, 88, &amp;c., and also Nos.
41, 45, 49, 72, 76, 80, and 84, which are standing
figures of the same kind. It was much the practice
of the Egyptians to adorn the human figure with the
head of an animal, most commonly that of the lion,
cat, or ibis.

<p>THE head represented in the wood-cut is placed (without a No.) in front of the picture marked 180, and
appears to be of Graeco-Egyptian sculpture, as it is
considerably divested of the stiffness of the Egyptian
manner, and yet not beautiful enough to be of pure
Greek work. It is in the Egyptian costume, and
bears on the forehead the snake, the Egyptian mark
of royalty and divinity.

<head>Egyptian Painting.</HEAD>
<p>PAINTING, or the representation of objects by colours
on a flat surface, appears to be an art of less antiquity
than that of sculpture. Yet the Egyptians early acquired
the art of painting, as we find by many specimens on
tombs, temples, mummy cases, &amp;c.; and although they
never appear to have attained to any great perfection
in the art, the remains that have come down to us
show a considerable talent in designing, and are
interesting as affording specimens of the manners,
costume, and implements of the ancient inhabitants
of Egypt. The pureness, permanence, and brilliancy
of Egyptian colouring are the only qualities that we
can admire; for they never apparently compounded
colours so as to produce a greater variety from the
simple colours. It has also been frequently remarked
that they did not usually soften them off so as to form
various degrees of light and shade; yet, from the
specimens in the Museum, it will be apparent that
the artists were not totally unaware of the improved
effect to be obtained by softening and blending the
various colours.
<p>In the specimen before us, No. 173, we see a small
figure seated in a chair, cutting out some design on a
wall. The workman wears a thin shirt covering the
whole body, and holds in the left hand a chisel, and
in the right hand a kind of mallet and brush. He is
seated on a chair of that elegant form which we often
observe in other specimens of Egyptian art; the legs
cross one another obliquely, and the seat is covered
with the skin, apparently, of a leopard. Portions of
sculpture appear to be represented on the wall of the
apartment in which the figure is placed. The height
of the figure as seated is about 20 inches. This painting came from the grottoes in the western hills of
Thebes, the interior of which are covered with pictures of a similar description, which the peasants
there break down and sell to travellers.

<head>Egyptian Entertainment.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.015" n="2001.03.0016"><head>Egyptian Entertainment</head></figure>

<p>THIS is a very interesting pictorial fragment representing, apparently, an Egyptian entertainment. It
consists of two compartments; in the upper, beginning
at the left, we observe two figures, seated on elegantly-
formed chairs with cushions, who appear to be receiving some wine from the hands of an attendant,
only indicated by holding a cup which is just on the
margin of the fragment. Proceeding to the right we
see two other figures, almost fac-similes of the first,
who are alike receiving refreshment from an attendant. The sitting figures are clad from head to foot
in a thin drapery, and have their hair arranged in
long plaits falling all round the head to the shoulders.
The person, however, who is standing before them has
no covering except a narrow belt around the loins,
and armlets on the wrists and shoulders; but the hair
is ornamented in a similar manner to that of the more
important figures.  Beyond these are four other
figures, apparently, if we may judge from their dress
and seats, less important personages. Two of them
have the head shaved, and there appears to be a
greater projection in the mouth than is exhibited in
the features of their companions, who wear their hair
arranged in plaits similar to, but scarcely so long as,
those of the first-mentioned parties. These figures
are all inhaling the perfume of the lotus-flower, a
plant still abundant on the banks and waters of the
Nile.
<p>In the lower portion four female musicians are
playing to an awkward <hi rend=italic>danseuse</hi> in the centre, while
another figure on the right seems to be selecting some
fruit or wine from the stand on the extreme right of
the fragment; where the amphorae or wine-jars may
be easily perceived bound together with a ribbon.

<p><figure id="fig.007" n="2001.03.0008"><head>Egyptian Entertainment</head></figure>

<p>THIS picture has two compartments similarly to No. 179.
In the upper part each of the three seated pairs consists of a male and female: the male is distinguished,
as in the other pictures, by his bushy ornamented
head-dress, and his costume. The females, who are
distinguished from the males by the head-dress, the
rest of the vestments, and the fulness of the bosoms,
have each the right arm round the shoulders of the
males.  They are presented with refreshments by
attendants standing before the several groups. In the
lower compartments are eight seated female figures:
on the extreme right there is a seated male figure, and
ossibly there were more than one, but the picture is
here imperfect. On the left side of each compartment is a table well stored with fruit and other eatables; among these we see a goose, which appears to
have been a standing dish in those days. Under each
table are large jars, probably used for containing wine,
in the enjoyment of which the ancient Egyptians did
not stint themselves. Some of the fruit appears to be
grapes, which they cultivated with success. It may
appear rather curious that none of the figures in these
pictures are represented with shoes on, though sandals
appear frequently on ancient Egyptian monuments;
but it has ever been the practice in Egypt to take off
the shoes on entering into an apartment, and as these
figures may be supposed to be in a banqueting-room
we may infer that they have followed the usual custom
of the country. In this picture, as in No. 179, the
lotus-flower appears to be a great favourite with the
company.
<p>These pictures are painted on a ground of very fine
mortar; the colours when first seen were quite fresh,
but since the pictures have been in this country they
have suffered much from the climate, and although
every possible care is taken of them, it is feared they
are daily getting worse.  Faithful copies, however,
we understand, have been made of them, which will
present the appearance of the originals to future
generations.

<head>Egyptian Seal-Rings.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.011" n="2001.03.0012"><head>Egyptian Seal-Rings</head></figure>

<p>THE rings in this case, represented in the cut, are of
a very great antiquity; coeval, indeed, with passages
in the Bible, in which rings similar to these are
mentioned. Signet-rings were used in the earliest
ages to give validity to documents of importance. We
find them mentioned in Genesis xli. 42, as early as
1715 years before the Christian era; and they were
probably in use much earlier. Very great attention
has always been bestowed on these signet-rings in the
East, for as the seal alone is sufficient to authenticate
a document, and as the Orientals never sign their
name, it is of great importance that the seal should
not be lost, and accordingly there are certain regulations, binding the artist who sculptures the seal to
keep a copy of it, and to provide a fac-simile of the
original should it be lost or destroyed. In Egypt the
crime of counterfeiting a seal was punished with the
loss of both hands. The seal-rings were worn sometimes on the fingers (for which most of those in the
cut appear to be designed), but sometimes on the
wrist as a bracelet, or hung by a chain around the
neck. The larger scarabaeus, or beetle-rings, in the
case J were, perhaps, carried in this manner. The
seals in this case are precious stones engraved with
the name of the owner in hieroglyphics. These are
attached to rings of gold, on which they revolve on
pivots. The scarabraeus, or beetle, held in peculiar
esteem by the Egyptians as the representative of
several virtues, forms a distinguished feature in the
shape of many of these rings, and is exhibited in the
central figure in the cut in which the back of the seal
is shown. One of the number has also the beetle
carved on its face.

<head>Model of an Egyptian House.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.010" n="2001.03.0011"><head>Model of an Egyptian House</head></figure>

<p>THE antiquities in this room are principally from the
collection of Mr. Salt, formed during his residence in
Egypt, as Consul-General. They consist of mummies,
idols, sculptured tablets, articles of domestic use, and
other objects illustrating the manners, customs, and
history of the Ancient Egyptians; principally found
in tombs at Thebes, Memphis, Abydos, &amp;c., either enclosed in the mummy-cases or placed around the body,
or found ornamenting the interior of the sepulchre.
<p>These remains are arranged in glass cases around
the room, and in the centre are placed several mummies, partially unrolled and in different states, illustrating the mode in which the bodies were bandaged
and enclosed in pasteboard and wooden coverings.
<p>From this collection we select a few of the more interesting and important articles; and first-the model
of a house in case K.
<p>Although the houses in the Egyptian towns were
frequently of great extent, yet they were seldom more
than two or three stories in height. Those in the
villages, even in the present day, never exceed two
stories, being generally composed of a ground-floor
and a small gallery above it. The house of which the
present is a model was doubtless one of these. It
consists only of a court-yard and three small store-
rooms on the ground-floor, with sliding doors, with a
staircase leading to a room, on the gallery, belonging
to the storekeeper. In the court-yard a woman is
represented making bread.   When the model was
found the store-rooms were full of grain; but being
allowed to remain a short time in the custom-house at
Leghorn, the treasure was discovered by a rat, who in
a few minutes destroyed what had been preserved for
ages undisturbed.
<p>This interesting model was found in a tomb at
Necropolis, and was purchased by the British Museum
for the sum of 84<hi rend=italic>l</hi>.  It is 17 inches square, by 21
inches high.
<p>In our wood-cut we have taken the liberty of introducing some trees and figures, in order to convey a
better idea of the appearance of such a house in its
natural position.

<p><figure id="fig.013" n="2001.03.0014"><head>Mummy Case, or Coffin of Otaineb</head></figure>

<p>WE have already, in noticing the large sarcophagus
in the Egyptian saloon, given a sufficient detail of the
process of embalming the bodies of deceased persons,
and converting them into what we call mummies.
It will be needless, therefore, to repeat here what we
have said respecting this practice; but as the Museum
contains several mummies, we have given the annexed
wood-cut, as an illustration of the painted case in
which the body is put when properly embalmed and
wrapt up.   There are in the centre of the room
several mummies, one of which is almost entirely
divested of the bandages with which it was surrounded,
and shows very clearly the asphaltum, or bituminous
substance, called <hi rend=italic>mum</hi> (wax), whence we have derived
the name <hi rend=italic>mummy</hi>. Another has been less stripped of
its bandages, and exhibits the manner in which the
scarabaei, or sacred beetles, small figures of deities,
and other objects, are frequently placed among the
folds of the cloth. A third is completely covered with
the cloth, as it would appear when first taken from
the pasteboard case in which it is enclosed (one of
which is exhibited in a fourth case, and others,-that
of "OTAINEB" being one-in the four corners of the
room). There are also two or three of the exterior
cases made of the wood of the native sycamore, in
which the pasteboard cases were enclosed. These are
very splendid specimens of this curious branch of
antiquity, as the colours are in the most perfect state,
the figures elaborately drawn, and the whole enriched
with gilding of a peculiar brilliancy.
<p>It appears to have been a common practice in Ancient Egypt for a man to give the bodies of his parents
or ancestors as security for money borrowed; a sacred
pledge, which, if not redeemed, lost him his character,
and with it the privilege of interment; a disgrace
which an Egyptian would endeavour by all means to
avoid.
<p>A very interesting chapter on Mummies will be
found in the second volume of 'Egyptian Antiquities,'
published in the Library of Entertaining Knowledge.

<p>IN this case are placed several small wooden images
as well as others of a similar kind, but sculptured in
various stones, principally in blue porcelain. They
are frequently met with in mummy cases, or found
placed among the bandages on the breast, or at the
feet, of the mummy. They appear to be a representation, on a small scale, of the mummy itself, as the
head-dress is similar to the one generally represented
on mummy cases, and the body is frequently covered
with hieroglyphics ; but it is probable they were used
as a kind of household gods by the ancient Egyptians,
and in that character interred with their possessor on
his decease. The specimens we have engraved are
made of the native sycamore wood, and are painted.
They are probably the kind of wooden gods mentioned
in the Bible--<bibl>Deut. iv. 28</bibl>-as <quote>"the work of men's
hands."</quote>
<p>From unfinished specimens of sculpture which have
been brought to light, and from Egyptian drawings
and paintings, as well as from some obscure remarks
which we find in ancient authors, we learn with
tolerable accuracy the method pursued by the ancient
Egyptian sculptor in delineating and carving the
forms of their gods and other objects. <quote>"They began
by smoothing the surface of the wood or stone, and
drawing a number of parallel lines at equal distances,
at right angles, to which were traced other lines
forming a series of squares, nineteen of which were
always allowed for the height of the human figure.
After the first outlines of the figure had been traced,
it was inspected by a master, who wrote in various
parts of it, in hieratic, such observations and instructions as he wished to be attended to by the artists in
the progress of the work. The sculptor (an artist
distinct from the draughtsman) then proceeded with
his department; and, when he had finished the cutting
out, other artists began to decorate the statue with
gilding, painting, &amp;c. Mr. Wilkinson supposes that
the artists were in some way attached to, and formed
a branch of, the priesthood."</quote>-See notes to <bibl><hi rend=italic>'Pictorial

<head>Etruscan Vase.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.092" n="2001.03.0096"><head>Etruscan Vase</head></figure>

<p>AMONG the manufactories of ancient Etruria, those at
Campania, particularly at Nola, at the foot of Mount
Vesuvius, and at Capua, were celebrated for producing
the finest specimens of vases. It was from these
places that the principal of those adorned with paintings, representing subjects from the history, the
mythology, the religious, civil, and domestic customs
of the ancients, were exported to the neighbouring
countries of Europe, and to Egypt, where they found
a ready sale. The figures on the vases are generally
of a reddish colour, sometimes relieved by white,on a
dark or black ground; but in some of the old Graeco-
Etruscan vases the figures themselves are black, and
the ground a yellowish-red.  It is quite a mistaken
notion to suppose that the Etruscans were only acquainted with three colours (as many authors assert),
namely, black, red, and white; for we find on many
vases an assemblage of several colours, as red, scarlet,
blue, green, yellow-and many varieties in the different
shades of these colours. In two or three of the vases
in the Museum we may observe parts to be richly
adorned with gold, apparently applied with a brush,
or instrument similar to those used in painting the
other portions of the vase. With respect to the forms
of these vases, it will be found that they are all reducible to the evolution of different elliptical curves, which,
gradually falling into one another, give a series of
most graceful and beautiful forms, and present an
endless variety of figures.
<p>The figures on this vase are of a yellowish-red
colour, and are depicted on a black ground. There is
considerable grace in the female figures, and a competent knowledge of form exhibited in the others;
but we are not aware what subject the artist intended
to represent.  It is engraved  in D'Hancarville's
<bibl>'Receuil d'Antiquites, &amp;c.' vol. iii., pl. 94.</bibl>

<p><figure id="fig.107" n="2001.03.0111"><head>Etruscan Vase</head></figure>

<p>WE have no detailed account of the method pursued
by the Etruscans in the manufacture of these vases,
but from detached remarks in various ancient authors,
D'Hancarville<note type=foor n=1><bibl>'Antiquites Etrusques, Grecques, et Romaines,' par M. D'Hancarville, 4 vols. fol., 1765.</bibl></note> has attempted an account of their procedure, which may be briefly summed up as follows:
<quote rend=blockquote>
The clay, which is of a very fine quality, they procured from the banks
of the Vulturnus, a river of Capua, and, placing it in water, they allowed
it to remain until it had become sufficiently pliant to be moulded into any
form. They then, by means of the " potter's wheel," moulded the clay
to the shape required, and while it was still wet a coating of iron ochre
was applied, which, when heated at the last stage of the process, produced
the black colour which generally forms the ground of the vases. The
painter then drew in the outline of the figures; and as lie did not exercise
his art on a plane surface, but on one which was considerably curved,
and was obliged, moreover, to keep the vases upright, as, in the plastic
state in which they were at this period of their manufacture, their own
weight, if placed sideways, would tend to alter their form, we may judge
of the great difficulty he had to encounter in producing a continuous and
even line. The borders and ornaments now appear to have been put in,
and then the vase was placed in a furnace where the colours were burnt
in, and the whole completed.</quote>
<p>In many of these productions, as, for instance, in
the one now before us, there is an elegance of form,
an absence of all harsh and angular transitions, a
graceful flow of line, taste in the ornaments, and a
truth in the representation of natural objects, which
exhibit a very advanced state in the knowledge of the
arts of design, and will render the name of Etruria
ever memorable in the history of art.
<p>The painting on this vase (H 15) appears to represent an offering to some deity, to whom the pillar in
the centre is consecrated. One figure bears a basket
of fruit, another a garland, and others branches of
plants.    Although two of the figures are over the
heads of the others, they are intended to be represented as standing on the same level; but as they
would, if placed on the same line with the others, be
partly hid by the more prominent figures, the artist has
resorted to this method of rendering them visible.

<head>Etruscan Vase.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.106" n="2001.03.0110"><head>Etruscan Vase</head></figure>

<p>MOST of the vases in this collection were found in tombs,
hung up by nails on the walls, or found placed near the
sarcophagus of the deceased person. It is probable
they were used to hold the provisions and liquors
which the ancients were accustomed to present to the
dead; but they doubtless were also sometimes entombed with the deceased (as we have had occasion to
remark in speaking of the vases in the Townley Collection), as memorials of his achievements in the circus,
or as gifts received from intimate friends. We know
that it was customary to present vases to the conquerors in races and other Olympic exercises; and
the honour of having gained one of these prizes was
considered so great, both by the successful party himself and his connexions, that, according to Pausanias,
the inhabitants of the town of Agrigentum, in Sicily,
offered to pay a very considerable sum to a wrestler
who had been decreed the victor in the games, if he
would acknowledge himself to be their fellow-citizen.
<p>The vase now before the reader (H. 29) is in many
respects one of the most beautiful and interesting in
the collection. The earthenware which forms the body
of the vessel, and which is exquisitely adorned with
paintings and ornaments, is supported at the lower
part by small bronze figures of very delicate workmanship, and a bronze ring is fastened to the upper
part, to which is attached two swing handles of the
same material, so that the vase may be carried from
place to place. The whole is in the most chaste and
exquisite taste, and presents one of the best examples
of the skill to which the Etruscans had attained in the
design and execution of this branch of arts and manufactures.
<p>The painting probably represents some domestic
ceremony: the lady holds in her hand a parasol, which
was used by the ancients not only to defend them
from the sun, but was often carried as a mark of
elevated rank. The figures are painted red on a black
ground, and the effect is heightened in several parts,
as on the upper part of the parasol, the mirror, &amp;c.,
with white.

<div2 type=object n=1>
<head>Etruscan Vase.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.093" n="2001.03.0097"><head>Etruscan Vase</head></figure>

<p>IN the first period of the art of painting these vases,
only the outline was drawn, but as it advanced, the
figures were filled up by a thick pigment of a single
colour. But as a series of figures, all of the same
colour, could not be placed one before another, or arranged in what artists call groups, without confounding them together, the artists soon began to use colours
of different intensity, so that the mixture of one figure
with another was in some degree remedied. In some
vases we find white, red, blue, and other colours, apparently of a different kind to those with which the
ground and first outline of the figures are painted.
These colours appear to have been put on alter the
vase had been baked, and to have then been subjected
to the action of heat (which of course the other colours
had now to bear a second time). But, in consequence
of these colours not having been put on the vase
whilst it was moist, they have not become incorporated
with the material of which it is composed (as the other
colours have), and, consequently, they may be rubbed
off with the finger, and are indeed liable to scale, or
chip off by mere exposure to the weather.
<p>In the vase before us (H. 36), we have a very beautiful specimen of the talents of the Etruscans. Whatever the subject may be,-and we cannot pretend to
give a decided opinion, though we have fancied it to
represent the story of Cephalus and Procris,-the
beauty with which the figures are drawn, the expression both in attitude and feature, and the artistical
arrangement of the group, combine to stamp this as a
production of the very highest excellence.
<p>It is assuredly to the Etruscans that we partly owe
the excellence to which Greece, Rome, and other nations afterwards attained in painting and sculpture,
for as the works of Etruria were constantly before
their eyes, they must have imbibed from them that
pure taste which distinguishes their productions, and
which has rendered their works models of art to all
succeeding ages.

<p><figure id="fig.081" n="2001.03.0084"><head>Etruscan Vases</head></figure>

<p>IN the room up stairs, adjoining the New Room of
Egyptian Antiquities, are placed a number of vases.
principally from the collection of Sir W. Hamilton
They are nearly all of that kind which have been denominated Etruscan, and were found principally near
Naples; from whence they were brought to England,
after they had been beautifully engraved, under the
direction of D'Hancarville, the celebrated antiquarian.
We shall present our readers with a few specimens,
which will give them a sufficient idea of the style in
which these vases are made, but we must apprise them
that they will be found of infinite variety, both in
shape and decoration.
<p>Etruria (from whence these vases and many other
beautiful specimens of ancient art have been procured)
is the ancient name for that portion of Italy now
called Tuscany. The country was very early inhabited
by a colony of bold and industrious men from Phoenicia, who were already well practised in navigation
and commerce. The Etruscans attained the height
of their glory at the time of the building of Rome,
when they were celebrated for their excellence in all
the arts of peace and civilised life. In the construction
of articles of comfort and luxury they attained to great
skill, and the plastic arts particularly were carried to
great perfection by them-as the earthenware vases, to
which we now direct attention, will sufficiently testify.
<p>The two vases represented on this card are both
ornamented with elegant borders around the top and
neck, and have subjects connected with the habits of
the ancients painted on their sides. The design on
that marked H. 90 appears to represent an offering
made to the Dioscuri (the twins Castor and Pollux,
sons of Jupiter and Leda). One of these deities stands
by the side of the pillar, while the other is represented
by the black fillet which is tied round it, indicating
his death. The female is gracefully bending her body
in the act of making an offering of fruit.
<p>The subject depicted on the other vase (H. 327)
appears to be a domestic ceremony in honour of some
god whose symbol, apparently a globe, is held by one
of the females.

<p>THE following is Mr. Combe's description of this terra-

erected by the Roman Emperor Trajan, to commemorate his conquest over Decebalus, the leader of the
Dacians [inhabitants of a country beyond Hungary,
containing the present Moldavia, Transylvania, and
Wallachia]. Near the trophy stands a Dacian chief,
as a captive, attended by one of Trajan's guards, and
secured by a chain fastened round his right wrist.
The dress and character of this captive exactly correspond with the costume of the Dacians as represented on Trajan's column. His head has no covering,
his chin is bearded, and his dress consists of a long
cloak and a sort of trowsers which reach to his feet.
The trophy, as usual, is erected on the trunk of a tree,
over which a Dacian cloak is thrown, while a shield

<p><figure id="fig.020" n="2001.03.0021"><head>Warrior Consulting the Oracle of Apollo</head></figure>

<p>THIS is a bas-relief, much restored, representing a
Warrior seated, consulting the oracle of Apollo. Apollo
stands before him, resting his right hand upon a lyre
of a square form, through which is seen a raven, a
bird particularly noticed, as an accompaniment of
Apollo, by AElian in his <bibl>"History of Animals."</bibl>  Mr.
Combe observes, that a lyre, which bears a strong resemblance to this, occurs in the hand of a bronze
figure of Apollo, engraved in the <bibl>"Museum Etruscum
of Gorius," vol. i. plate 33</bibl>.  Its form  is certainly
peculiar.
<p><quote>"Scarcely any important enterprises," says Mr.
Combe, " were undertaken by the ancients until the
oracles of the gods had been consulted; and in no instances were they resorted to with more zeal than at
the commencement, or during the prosecution of a
war.   Alexander the Great consulted the Pythian
oracle before he waged war against the Persians; and
Pyrrhus did not venture to assist the people of Tarentum against the Romans until he had received an
answer, favourable, as he imagined, from the same
oracle."</quote><note type=foot n=1><bibl>Combe, "Description of the Ancient Terra cottas in the British Museum," pp. 27, 28.</bibl></note> Such a ceremony, however, it may be observed, would often be complied with out of regard to
the popular opinion, rather than because those at the
head of affairs attached any real importance to it.
<p>The upper part of the warrior's figure, as well as the
legs of Apollo, which were originally defective in this
bas-relief, were restored by Mr. Nollekens.
<p>The dimensions of the sculpture, are about 10 1/2 inches

<head>A Chariot Race.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.109" n="2001.03.0113"><head>A Chariot-Race</head></figure>

<p>A BAS-RELIEF in terra-cotta, representing a Chariot-
race. The charioteer, in a car drawn by four horses,
is galloping toward the metae or pillars, round which
the horses turned in the contests of the circus. He
wears a helmet, and bands are swathed round the upper parts of his body. The reins, as was usual on the
occasion, pass entirely round him. In Homer's <hi rend=italic>Iliad</hi>,
Nestor directs<note type=foot n=1><quote rend=blockquote>
<lb>"Bear close to this, and warily proceed,
<lb>A little bending to the left-hand steed;
<lb>But urge the right, and give him all the reins,
<lb>While thy strict hand his fellow's head restrains,
<lb>And turns him short; till, doubling as they roll,
<lb>The wheels' round naves appear to brush the goal."
<bibl>POPE'S Homer's Iliad.</bibl></quote></note> that in turning round the goal, the
right-hand horse should be urged on with a loose
rein, whilst the left steed is slightly reined in; and
these instructions appear to be observed by the
charioteer in the bas-relief. Victory was pronounced
in favour of him whose chariot first touched a line,
marked with white chalk, drawn between the first
meta and the left side of the circus.
<p>The Romans, always fond of shows and games, were
singularly attached to those of the circus. Fifteen of
those places of amusement are supposed to have been
in Rome and its environs. Of these, the Circus Maximus was the most extensive, and large remains exist
both of this and of the circus of Caracalla.
<p>The dimensions of this bas-relief are 1 foot 4 inches,
by 1 foot.
<p>The inscription "Anniae Arescusa," on a tablet
above the heads of the horses, records the name of the
artist of this terra-cotta, who appears to have been a
female.

<head>The Caryatide.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.097" n="2001.03.0101"><head>The Caryatide</head></figure>

<p>CARYATIDES, or Caryates, is a name given by architects
to an order of pillars for supporting the entablatures
of buildings, consisting of female figures, clothed in
a robe down to their feet. Vitruvius says they were
originally designed to represent the Caryatidae, the
women of Carya in Peloponnesia, who were reduced to
a state of slavery by the Greeks, because their town had
favoured the Persians; but this account of their origin
is liable to many objections.
<p>The present Caryatide is a female statue, larger than
life, of a composed and dignified appearance, bearing
a modius upon the head. The right hand is extended
gently forward, whilst the left, which is lowered, sustains one of the folds of the robe. The neck is
ornamented with two necklaces of great elegance,
and the wrists have bracelets. The hair, which is
arranged in full curls round the front of the head, is
drawn together at the back of the neck by a ribbon,
and thence descends in five spiral locks. The feet of
the figure, which are bare, rest on sandals.
<p>This statue, which, including its pedestal, is 7 feet
10 inches high, is nearly perfect. The projecting portion of the right arm, the left foot, and a small piece
of the upper part of the modius, are all the restorations
of importance that it has received. It was found near
Rome, with another nearly similar to it, during the
pontificate of Sixtus V., among some ancient ruins in
the Villa Strozzi, situated upon the Appian road, about
a mile and a half beyond the tomb of Caecilia Metella,
commonly called Capo di Bove. It was placed, with
its companion, in the Villa Montalto, from whence it
came into Mr. Townley's possession, through the means
of Mr. Jenkins, a banker at Rome, who, in the year
<datestruct value="1786--"><year reg="1786">1786</year></datestruct>, purchased all the marbles which enriched that
magnificent villa.

<head>A Candelabrum in Marble.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.075" n="2001.03.0077"><head>A Candelabrum in Marble</head></figure>

<p>CANDELABRA were among the richest ornaments of the
temples and houses of the Greeks and Romans. They
were manufactured of all materials, from gold and
silver to wood and terra-cotta; and varied in shape according to the taste and talent of the artist. They
were generally constructed similarly to the present
specimen; a triangular base, which rested upon three
feet, supporting a column surmounted by a broad
but shallow plateau or basin, but this of course varied
in size or depth accordingly, as it was used for a lampstand, or designed for a brazier on which to burn incense or odoriferous woods.  Tarentum and AEgina
were considered by the Romans as the best manufactories of candelabra. Pliny records it to the reproach
of Gegania, an opulent Roman lady, that she had
bought a candelabrum for 50,000 sesterces, a sum equal
to about 403<hi rend=italic>l</hi>. 10<hi rend=italic>s</hi>. of our present money. In Cicero
we have an account of a candelabrum designed for the
temple of Jupiter Capitolinus at Rome, which was of
very large dimensions; it was executed by the most
skilful artists, and was profusely adorned with brilliant
gems. The same writer asserts that there was not a
house in Sicily without these utensils, mostly made in
silver. None, it is probable, now remain in the precious metals, as their intrinsic value alone must have
proved a temptation to destroy them; but we have
many specimens in bronze and marble.
<p>The present candelabrum was found in the ruins of
the villa of Antoninus Pius; it is considerably restored,
but the three figures on the pedestal were taken from
another candelabrum of a similar character, so that the
whole is in uniform taste.
<p>The height of this candelabrum is 4 feet 1 1/8 inch.

<head>Bacchanalian Vase.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.089" n="2001.03.0093"><head>A Baccanalian Vase</head></figure>

<p>FEW remains of antiquity have excited more interest
than vases. Although of course the earliest specimens
must have been rude, yet as refinement increased, they
became more elegant in form, more costly in substance,
and at length came to be frequently adorned with
paintings and carvings of exquisite design. The purposes to which they were applied were more numerous
than can be detailed. Many were used in the different
ceremonies of the temples. They were also carried in
processions, bestowed as rewards and customary presents, and used as offerings to the gods, and for containing the ashes of the dead. The larger vases were
placed in the halls of the great, or used as ornaments.
to their gardens.
<p>The one before us is in marble, of an elegant oval
form, rather more than three feet in height, with large
upright handles; the body is surrounded by a continued bas-relief of exquisite workmanship, representing the celebration of the orgies of Bacchus; and at
the lower part, close to the pedestal, are eight female
figures with wings, whose bodies terminate in the
forms of tritons, each holding a patera in her hand.
<p>This beautiful vase was found, in detached pieces,
by Mr. Gavin Hamilton, at Monte Cagnuolo, the site
of the villa of Antoninus Pius, at the ancient Lanuvium, a small town near Rome, on the Appian Way.
The fragments were carefully joined, and the pieces
wanting restored.  The restorations consist of the
figure of the faun with the spear (or thyrsus), all but
the lower part of the legs and the left arm; the Bacchante next to him, all but the feet; the face of the
figure holding the torch; and the left arm and part of
the leg of the satyr, with a portion of the amphora, or
wine-jar. The pedestal of the vase also is modern.

<head>Venus, or Dione.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.105" n="2001.03.0109"><head>Venus, or Dione</head></figure>

<p>A FEMALE statue, naked to the waist, but from thence covered
with drapery. A portion of the drapery is thrown over the
right arm, whilst the left arm is gracefully uplifted. This
figure consists of two pieces of marble imperceptibly joined
at the lower part of the body within the drapery. It was in
consequence of these two parts being separately exhibited, as
unconnected fragments, that Mr. Townley obtained permission to export them from Rome. Colossal statues were frequently formed of two pieces, but instances of statues, not
colossal, being so constructed are exceeding rare, perhaps the
only other in existence being the Venus at Paris, supposed to
be by Melos.
<p>The execution of this figure is of the highest order of art,
and the marble retains its original polish; but the left arm, the
right hand, and the tip of the nose, have been restored. As
the symbols, whatever they were, have been lost with the
hands, it is scarcely possible to ascertain what personage this
statue was intended to represent. It is manifestly ideal, and
Mr. R. P. Knight thought, from the character of the head,
and the disposition of the hair, that it was either Venus or
Dione. Mr. Combe also considered it a Venus; but Mr.
Townley, for some years, called it Ariadne. Various other
names have at different periods been assigned to it, among
which are those of Hebe and Isis.
<p>It measures 6 feet 11 1/2 inches in height, including the
plinth, which is 4 5/8 inches high; and was found in the ruins of
the maritime baths of the Emperor Claudius, at Ostia, in Italy,
by Mr. Gavin Hamilton, in the year <datestruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></datestruct>; and it is not improbable that it might have been placed, as an appropriate
ornament, in one of the apartments of the baths.
<p>Mr. R. P. Knight considered it as deservedly ranking
among the most precious monuments of Grecian art now
extant, and even ventured to conjecture that it was the identical Venus mentioned by Pliny as the work of Scopas, who
lived in the fifth century before the Christian era.
<p>When Canova saw it in <datestruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></datestruct>, he spoke of it as the finest
female statue he had seen in England.

<head>Colossal Head of Hercules.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.080" n="2001.03.0083"><head>A Colossal Head of Hercules</head></figure>

<p>THE figure to which this head belonged was probably
a copy of the famous statue of Hercules in a state of
repose, by Glycon, which was found in the baths of,
Caracalla at Rome, and known by the name of the
Farnese Hercules, from the palace at Rome in which it
was preserved. It was after this model that the present bust was restored at Rome; for the nose, the
right ear, and a splinter of the right cheek are modern;
yet it differs in a few points from the head of the
Farnese Hercules, as the face is broader, and the hair
of the head and beard is in more distinct masses.
<p>This head is of the finest Greek sculpture, and was
dug up at the foot of Mount Vesuvius, where it had
been buried by the lava from the volcano. It was
presented to the British Museum by Sir William
Hamilton. It measures (including the chest) 2 feet
5 2/8 inches in height.
<p>The history of the Farnese Hercules, which the present bust so much resembles, is this: the city of Perinthus (the metropolis of Thrace) was twice besieged
by Philip of Macedon; the citizens, however, by the
strength of their situation, their own valour, and the
intervention of friends, preserved their liberty. As
their city was dedicated to Hercules, they represented
him, after this success, upon their coins as resting from
his labours. This device is believed to have been the
origin of Glycon's statue, the style of which is apparently of a period somewhat later than the time
of Alexander. The earliest coins of Perinthus bore
the head of Hercules, with the inscription <hi rend=italic>Ton
Kticthn, the founder</hi>.

<head>Sepulchral Cippus.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.029" n="2001.03.0030"><head>Sepulchral Cippus</head></figure>

<p>A CIPPUS is a low column usually bearing an inscription. In form it is sometimes found round, sometimes
square, and sometimes of an irregular figure, frequently without either base or capital.
<p>The uses to which cippi were applied were various.
With distances engraved upon them, they served as
mile-stones, and, from the reverses of ancient coins, it
appears that decrees of the senate were occasionally
inscribed upon them. They were set up as landmarks; and employed, more frequently than for any
other purpose, as sepulchral monuments: the mausoleums and burying-grounds of the Romans being full
of them. The whole of the cippi in the Townley Collection are of this last description. They are mostly
rectangular: one or two are excavated in the upper
part in the form of a basin or cup; and in one instance
the upper part, or roof of the cippus, is perforated to
receive libations. The greater part bear short inscriptions in front. Cippi of the square form, when without inscriptions, have frequently been taken for altars,
on account of the similarity of their ornaments.
<p>The article before us is the capital or upper division
of a votive cippus. It represents two birds in bas-relief drinking from a basin, behind which is a terminal figure of the God of Lampsacus, an old Greek
city, formerly noted for its temple to Venus Meretrix,
and its dissolute inhabitants. The sides of the column
are ornamented with the heads of Bacchus, fauns, &amp;c.

<head>Warrior and his Sons Consulting the Oracle of Apollo.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.019" n="2001.03.0020"><head>Warrior and his Sons Consulting the Oracle of Apollo</head></figure>

<p>A BAS-RELIEF representing a father and two sons, consuiting the oracle of Apollo. They are clothed alike
in Roman military dresses, and each has his right
hand placed upon his breast, to express his awe of the
god. Apollo, whose figure, with the exception of the
right side, is clothed to the feet, is seated on the cortina, or cover of the tripod or three-footed stool, on
which the priestess of the oracle usually sat, delivering
the response of the god, whose sentiments she
was supposed to be privy to. Although the priest
or priestess of the temple from which the oracles
were propounded, was the only important agent
visible to the people, yet in pictorial and poetical descriptions, the god himself is often represented as the
respondent in person. Many artifices were resorted
to by the ancient priesthood to render their oracular
answers to the questions of the people more solemn
and imposing. Statues and other inanimate objects
were sometimes heard to utter articulate sounds, which
were at that time considered by the superstitious populace as miracles resulting from the immediate operation of the deity of the place, although we may
now easily perceive how such sounds might have been
produced by a person slightly acquainted with mechanics and the laws of acoustics. In this terra-cotta,
Latona and Diana, the mother and sister of Apollo,
stand between him and the warriors, the former holding in her left hand the offering which has been made
to the god, and which appears to be frankincense.
<p>This bas-relief appears to have been a votive offering
to Apollo, whose oracles held the next rank to those of
Jupiter; they were delivered in many different parts
of Greece, but the most celebrated of these prophetic
seats were at Delphi and the island of Delos. They
were in general delivered by the priestess of Apollo,
but, as we have said of other oracles, they were supposed to be sometimes delivered by the god himself.
<p>This bas-relief belonged to the late Duke of Bedford,
by whom it was presented to Mr. Townley in <datestruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></datestruct>.
Its dimensions are 2 feet 7 1/3 inches, by 1 foot 7 3/4 inches.

<head>A Female Statue.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.079" n="2001.03.0082"><head>Female Statue</head></figure>

<p>A BEAUTIFUL female statue, executed in the finest style
of Greek art. The figure, with the exception of some
drapery confined between the lower limbs, is almost
entirely unclothed. The hair of the head, which is inclined to the right, is bound by several narrow fillets;
and on the feet are sandals tied round the instep.
<p>The arms of this figure, from below the shoulders,
have been well added by a modern artist, but the disposition of them is probably incorrect. Mr. Combe
states that they were restored under the direction of
Mr. Gavin Hamilton, who conceived that the figure
originally held a mirror in the left hand: but Mr.
R. P. Knight was informed by Nollekens, that Mr.
Townley superintended the restorations. This latter
gentleman considered it to represent Angerona, the
goddess of Silence, because a slight projection remains
upon the chin of something which has been originally
attached to that part, as if the right hand had been
applied towards the mouth. Mr. Combe called this
statue a Venus. He supposed that, in its perfect
state, the right hand was elevated to the chin, and that
the left arm was held across the body a little below the
bosom. It seems more probable that it was originally
intended for a Venus than the goddess of Silence, on
account of its being entirely denuded of drapery.
<p>The head of this statue is joined to the rest of the
figure, having apparently been broken off and rejoined,
for it evidently formed part of the original. The face
has been damaged, and the nose has been restored by
a modern artist; yet, notwithstanding the mutilations
it has undergone, sufficient remains to excite in us
the liveliest admiration at the extreme delicacy and
beauty of the figure.
<p>The height, including the pedestal, is 3 feet 6 1/2 inches.
It was found by Mr. Gavin Hamilton, in an ancient
bath at Ostia, the mouth of the Tiber, in <datestruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct>.

<head>Apotheosis of Homer.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.087" n="2001.03.0090"><head>Apotheosis of Homer</head></figure>

<p>THIS beautiful bas-relief represents the Apotheosis or
Deification of Homer. It is clearly of Roman workmanship, as it was found about the middle of the 17th
century, at Frattocchi, the ancient Bovillae, on the
Appian road, ten miles from Rome, on the site of the
palace of the Emperor Claudius, whose veneration for
the poet and his works is well known; it has been
supposed that this sculpture was executed for him by
the artist whose name appears in the upper part:
Archelaus, the son of Apollonius, of Priene. It was
for many years in the Colonna Palace at Rome; and
was added to the Townley Gallery, in <datestruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></datestruct>, by the
Trustees of the British Museum, at the expense of
one thousand pounds. The dimensions, excluding the
border (which is modern), are as follow: height, 4
feet; width, 2 feet 8 1/4 inches.
<p>Jupiter appears seated on the summit of Mount
Olympus, looking round as if listening to one of the
Muses, who seems to address him upon the subject of
the poet's merits, and supplicates the concession to him
of divine honours. The other Muses are observed
below Jupiter, extending to the third compartment,
where Apollo, clothed in female attire, stands holding
a harp in one hand, and the plectrum (the instrument
used in striking the harp) in the other. The figure
standing on a pedestal has given rise to much conjecture, but it is probable that it represents the author
of an eulogium on the Father of Poetry, to whom a
tripod, before which he stands, has been awarded as a
prize.
<p>In the lowest range of all we have the ceremony of
the Deification. Homer is seated in a chair, and is
crowned with a garland by Earth and Time, who stand
behind him. The Iliad and Odyssey are represented
by two females kneeling on either side the chair. Before the poet are priestesses and attendants preparing
to sacrifice a bull to the new god; to whom also the
youth in front of the altar is in the act of pouring a
libation, or offering of wine.

<head>Laughing Faun.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.102" n="2001.03.0106"><head>Laughing Faun</head></figure>

<p>THIS statue of a Laughing Faun (a name given to a
fabulous people supposed to inhabit the woods, where
they joined the train of Bacchus; they are represented
generally young, with a goat's tail, long ears, and
budding horns), is 3 feet 11 inches high; and was
formerly preserved in the Macarani Palace at Rome,
whence it was procured by Mr. Townley. It is supported by an upright piece of marble, adorned with
foliage, of modern fabrication.
<p>A portion of the body of this figure is covered with
the nebris, or skin of a young deer, the legs of which
are tied across the left shoulder. A syrinx, or Pandean pipe is in the right hand, while the left holds the
pedum, or shepherd's crook.
<p>The arms, from the elbows, and both the legs from
a little below the knees, were restored by Algardi, in
deference to whose name in art, though little deserved,
Mr. Townley allowed them to remain, though well
aware of the fact that they were inconsistent with the
original design of the figure. The left hand appears
indeed to have held the pedum, or short crook, a fragment of which still remains on the upper and original
part of the arm, against which it rests; the right arm,
with the pipe, is purely conjectural, and ill accords
with the high mirth and excitation of the laughing
features. The strain and tension of all the muscles
round the knees, prove that the figure was represented
on tiptoe, looking eagerly at some agreeable object,
which would account for the momentary attitude and
expression given to the countenance.
<p>The nebris, or hind's skin, which forms so remarkable a feature in the present statue, is constantly mentioned in the ancient writers, as appropriate to Bacchus, and worn by the Bacchantes-as in the "Bacchae"
of Euripides; where Pentheus, asking if anything
should be added to his attire, is answered-" the
thyrsus (a spear adorned with ivy or bay-leaves) for
your hand, and the spotted skin of the hind."

<head>Head of Homer.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.073" n="2001.03.0075"><head>Head of Homer</head></figure>

<p>A TERMINAL head of Homer, encircled by a narrow
diadem, or strophium. It represents him in extreme
age, but with a mild and dignified character. It was
found at Baiae, in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, and is rather more than 1 foot
10 inches high. The lower portion of the nose is the
only part that is modern.
<p>In workmanship this bust disputes the palm of excellence with the celebrated head of the poet in the
Farnese Palace at Rome. The bust is identified as
that of Homer by coins bearing his name, and from its
likeness to a terminus of the poet preserved at Naples,
which has his name and three Greek inscriptions in
honour of him inscribed on its front.
<p>The age and country of Homer have been long subjects of dispute. For the former we have only the
choice of conjectures ; but the best accounts place him
from 160 to 200 years after the fall of Troy, which was
about twelve centuries B. C.; the Parian Chronicle
places him about 907 years B. c., under the perpetual
archonship of Diognetus at Athens; and he has been
stated by others to have flourished in the eighth century
B. C. For his country, Aulus Gellius quotes an epigram
from Varro, in which the names of the seven towns that
contended for his birth are comprised in a Greek hexameter. Sannazarius has presented it to us in Latin:
<quote>"Smyrna, Rhodos, Colophon, Salamin, Chios, Argos, Athenae."</quote>
but Smyrna, on the bank of the Meles, is generally
considered to have the fairest claim; though Wood,
who travelled carefully over the scenes of the " Iliad,"
gave the preference to Chios.
<p>Smyrna had a temple consecrated to Homer; and
Ios boasted of his tomb. He has been described as a
poor blind wandering singer, or, as some writers have
it, a beggar; but, although in his later days he might
have become blind, his descriptions of the different
scenes and actions in his poems evince that he could
not have been born so; and when we consider the
reverence in which the poets of the early ages were
held, and the welcome they always found in the houses
of the great, and at all festivals, we may conclude that
his situation in life was not so low as some would have
us suppose.

<p>It was found, with one similar to it, in <datestruct value="1766--"><year reg="1766">1766</year></datestruct>, in the
Villa Verospi, near the Salarian gate of Rome, supposed to have been the site of the magnificent gardens
of Sallust; and it is probable the two statues formed a
part of the decorations of a fountain, the remains of
which were discovered on the same spot.
<p>The head and left shoulders, both feet, and the right
hand, are modern, and it is singular that the two repetitions of this figure which are known to exist, one in
the Villa Borghese, the other in the Colonna Palace,
are both alike destitute of the same portions. Thus it
is impossible to ascertain the original position of the
head and hand. The Italian statues are both without
the ancient plinth, and thus having lost their characteristic symbol, the bow, the action of the figures have
been misconceived by the artists who restored them.
The one in the Villa Borghese holds a shell in her
right hand, and is thence called <quote>"La Venere della
Conchiglia,"</quote> or <quote>"Venus with the Shell;"</quote> and the other,
in the Colonna Palace, is represented with some tali,
or small bones, in her hand, as if in the act of playing
with them.

<head>Quarrel at the Game of Tali.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.021" n="2001.03.0022"><head>Quarrel at the Game of Tali</head></figure>

<p>A STATUE belonging to a group, originally composed
of two boys quarrelling at the game of tali. This
statue was found in the baths of Titus at Rome, during
the pontificate of Urban VIII., and was placed by Cardinal Francisco Barberini, nephew to that pope, in the
Barberini Palace, from whence it came into the possession of Mr. Townley in the year <datestruct value="1768--"><year reg="1768">1768</year></datestruct>, by purchase
from the Princess Dowager Barberini. It is 2 feet
3 3/4 inches in height; length, including the plinth,
2 feet 11 1/4 inches, by 1 foot 8 1/2 inches in width. The
left arm, the wrist of the right arm, both the feet, and
the plinth, except a small portion immediately beneath
the body, are modern. The boy is represented as biting
the arm of his companion, a portion of which may be
seen.
<p>This is supposed to be an ancient copy of a celebrated group in bronze, called the Astragalizontes, or
players with the dice, or animals' bones, which is recorded by Pliny to have been of the workmanship of
Polycletus, a celebrated sculptor of the fourth century
B. C. This bronze stood in the court-yard of the
Emperor Titus, on the very spot where the present
group was discovered.
<p>The game of tali is of very great antiquity, and has
descended to the present time. In Russia, boys, girls,
and sometimes even old men, are often to be seen
playing with the joint-bones of sheep, in a manner
similar to the ancient game of tali, and to the English
variation of &ldquo;Dibbs.&rdquo; It is a very common game with
English schoolboys, and consists in throwing up the
small square joint-bones of sheep, and while they are
moving in the air to pluck up others from the table,
and then to catch the first on the back of the hand.
Four or six is the usual number, and considerable
dexterity is requisite to catch the whole in the manner
prescribed by the rules of the game.

<p><figure id="fig.101" n="2001.03.0105"><head>Statue of a Faun</head></figure>

<p>A STATUE of a Faun, entirely naked, 3 feet 9 inches
high. The head, which is inclined gently forward,
has shaggy hair, pointed ears, and horns. In the right
hand of the figure is a patera, in the left an ewer;
but these, together with the arms, the right leg from
above, and the left from below the knee, are restorations. Upon a stem of marble which supports the
statue, is the following inscription:

<quote rend=blockquote lang=greek>

<lb>*t*i*o*s
<lb>*k*e*r*d*w*n

<p>A repetition of this statue occurs at No. 43, in which
the arms are restorations, as well as a part of the
right and the whole of the left foot, a portion of the
nose, and the plinth on which the figure stands. A
similar inscription is seen on this figure. The one on
No. 33 expresses simply that <quote>"Marcus Cossutius Cerdo
made the statue;"</quote> and the other (43) that <quote>"Marcus
Cossutius Cerdo, the freedman of Marcus, made it."</quote>
Mr. Combe observes upon the name of Cerdo being
written in Greek characters, that this custom was
adopted by the Roman artists in every period of the
ancient empire.
<p>Vitruvius, in the preface to his second book, observes
that it was a Roman citizen, named Cossutius, who
built the temple of the Olympian Jupiter. Whether it
was the same individual as the author of this statue,
can only be matter of conjecture.
<p>Both the statues here described were found in Italy
by Mr. Gavin Hamilton, in the year <datestruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct>1775, near Civita
Lavinia (the ancient town of Lanuvium), in the ruins
of the villa of Antoninus Pius.
<p>D'Hancarville was of opinion that they were intended to exhibit the united characters of Bacchus and
a Faun; and that they were copies from a statue in
bronze by Praxiteles, distinguished on account of its
excellence by the title of "The Renowned." This opinion, however, has been very satisfactorily refuted by
Visconti, in the <bibl>"Museo-Pio-Clementino," vol. vi., p. 10.</bibl>

<head>Head of a Greek Poet.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.072" n="2001.03.0074"><head>Head of Greek Poet</head></figure>

<p>A BRONZE head, formerly called that of Homer. It
is of the size of life, and represents a Greek poet
considerably advanced in years: the beard is short,
the eyes hollow, and the head is crowned with a narrow diadem. The head being inclined forwards, renders it probable that it belonged to a sitting figure,
holding a volume in the hands, the attitude in which
the Greek poets were usually represented. It has
been generally considered to be a portrait of Homer,
whose figure is exhibited sitting in the manner above
described on the coins of Smyrna, Chios, and Colophon;
and a statue of him, in a similar attitude, was placed
by Ptolemy Philopater in the temple which he dedicated to this poet. But we do not recognise in this
head the features usually given to Homer; this difference will be apparent on comparison with the other
busts of the poet in the British Museum and other
collections, as likewise with ancient coins on which his
head is represented. An opinion has been advanced,
and with considerable appearance of justness, that it
may have been intended for Pindar, a bronze statue of
whom was placed before the portico at Athens. Among
the arguments in favour of this opinion, is that the
appearance of age in this head accords with that of
Pindar, who is supposed to have lived to eighty years
of age.
<p>This valuable bronze was brought to England at the
beginning of the 17th century, for the collection of
Thomas, Earl of Arundel. It afterwards came into the
possession of Dr. Mead, at whose sale, in the year <datestruct value="1755--"><year reg="1755">1755</year></datestruct>,
it was purchased by the Earl of Exeter, by whom it
was presented to the British Museum in <datestruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></datestruct>. How
much Lord Arundel esteemed this bronze head, may
be inferred from its introduction into the large picture
of his countess and himself by Vandyke, engraved by
Vostermann. It is in height 11 5/8 inches.

<p><figure id="fig.017" n="2001.03.0018"><head>Greek Funeral Bas-Relief</head></figure>

<p>A GREEK funereal bas-relief, surrounded by a deep
moulding; the sides supported by pilasters. Its dimensions are 3 feet 8 1/2 inches, by 2 feet 1 inch.
<p>A warrior, who has dismounted from his horse,
thoughtfully approaches a trophy which is fixed upon
the stem of a tree: he is clothed in a slight drapery,
which passes partially over his left arm, and he wears
a helmet; in his right hand he bears a spear inverted,
resting upon his shoulder. Opposite to him, on the
other side of the trophy, is a female figure in long drapery; her right arm is uplifted in the act of pouring
a liquid from a vase, while in her left hand she holds
a patera, from which a serpent, coiled round the trunk
of the tree, is feeding. The fore-part of a horse is
introduced behind the warrior, together with the face
of an attendant.
<p>On the upper and lower surfaces of this monument
is an inscription, the first line of which is entirely
obliterated; but the rest contains the names of certain
parties, with those of the cities to which they belonged,
and probably enumerates the names of the persons
who fell in some engagement, which the bas-relief was
intended to commemorate. From the trophy represented, Mr. Combe thought it reasonable to infer that
victory was on the side of those whose names are mentioned on the marble.
<p>This bas-relief was brought to England by Mr.
Topham in the year <datestruct value="1725--"><year reg="1725">1725</year></datestruct>; and was presented to the

<head>Bacchus and Ampelus.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.099" n="2001.03.0103"><head>Bacchus and Ampelus</head></figure>

<p>AMPELUS was the son of a Phrygian Nymph, and grew
up to be very beautiful. Bacchus, became greatly attached to him, and was never happy without his society;
he took an interest in all his boyish amusements, and
even instituted contests between himself and Ampelus,
in which he purposely contrived that the latter should
be the victor. But the youthful Ampelus having, in
a freak, mounted the back of a ferocious bull, he was
carried a considerable way with great impetuosity, and
was at length thrown to the ground with such violence
as to cause his death. Bacchus, mourning for his loss,
found the dead body metamorphosed into a flourishing vine, a tree till that time unknown to him. His
admiration was strongly excited by the view of this
beautiful plant, and it became yet more increased when
he tasted its delicious fruit.
<p>The figure of Ampelus is represented at the period of
his transformation into the vine plant, but before the
metamorphosis has been quite completed: and the
skill of the sculptor has blended together the animal
and vegetable forms with so much ingenuity, that it is
difficult to decide either where one begins or the other
terminates. A panther is at the feet of Ampelus stealing a bunch of grapes. The figure of Bacchus is
youthful, easy, and graceful; the left arm is thrown
over the shoulder of Ampelus, and his countenance
is inclined towards his companion, whom he regards
with great benignity.
<p>This very beautiful and interesting group was found
in the year <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, near La Storta, about eight miles
from Rome, in the road leading to Florence. The
right arm of Bacchus is modern. The height is 4 feet
10 inches, including the plinth, which is 3 5/8 inches.

<head>Statue of Diana.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.096" n="2001.03.0100"><head>Statue of Diana</head></figure>

<p>A STATUE of Diana (the goddess of the chase), in a long
vestment reaching to the feet, over which is a shorter
garment, fastened at the waist by a narrow band. The
right arm is uplifted in the action of hurling a spear;
the left hangs down. The whole of the right arm, and
the left arm from the elbow downwards, being of
modern work, we have a right to doubt whether the
restorer has given the real character of this statue as it
was seen in its more perfect state. The drapery is
evidently blown back by the wind; and Mr. Combe
considered it probable, from an accurate inspection of
the figure, as well as from a comparison with other
similar figures, that this statue of Diana was originally
represented holding a bow in her left hand, and with
the right hand drawing an arrow from a quiver fastened behind her shoulder. Such is the action of the
Diana formerly in the Villa Pamphili, but now in the
Vatican, and such likewise is her action in a well-
known statue belonging to the Florentine collection;
it is also the same in many ancient medals. The bow
and quiver, when the statue was perfect, were doubtless of bronze, and the place occupied by the latter behind the right shoulder is very perceptible, as well as
the holes and the metal by which it was fastened to
the marble. Dallaway conjectured that the figure
might have held a torch in the right hand, but we
think the explanation just recorded is more likely to
be correct. The right leg and both feet are modern,
and the head, although ancient, is made of a separate
piece of marble inserted in a hollow made purposely
to receive it.
<p>This statue is 6 feet in height (including the plinth,
which is 3 1/2 inches high). It was found in the year
<datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, near La Storta, about eight miles from Rome, in
the road leading to Florence, at the same spot where
the group of Bacchus and Ampelus (No. 8) was discovered.

<p>THE room in which the sepulchral urns are placed in
the British Museum, is fitted up, upon a small scale, in
the manner of a Columbarium, or repository for the
dead, to show the mode in which the Romans deposited and preserved their urns, &amp;c., containing the
ashes of their deceased friends and dependants. The
columbaria were arched recesses, in which the urns
containing the ashes of the higher members of the
family were placed; the urns of dependants and servants being let into the thickness of the wall, within
niches, showing only the lids.
<p>No. 4 is an urn, of a rectangular form; the lid, or
pediment, being ornamented in the centre by a wreath
of laurel, with a dolphin at each corner. In front upon
a tablet overhung by a festoon, is this inscription:

of a panther, an eagle, and a deer, are introduced
among the foliage; and beneath the inscription an
infant genius is represented driving a car drawn by
four horses. The pilasters are surmounted by a capital composed of a female head supported by two
birds. The sides are adorned with pine-trees, at the
top of each of which a bird is placed, and another bird
and a snake are at the foot of the trees. In height
this urn is 21 inches, and in width 14 6/8 inches at

<p>Rectangular urns for containing the ashes of the
dead, called cinerary urns, are more numerous than
round ones in our galleries of sculpture. They have
been more sought for than the round ones, on account
of the greater interest they excite from their inscriptions, the greater variety of their ornaments, and the
mythological and historical subjects with which they
are occasionally embellished.  These cinerary urns
appear to have been kept on sale by the sculptors, as
tombstones are with the masons of the present day,
the inscription being filled up when a sale was effected.

<head>Achilles amongst the Daughters of Lycomedes.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.018" n="2001.03.0019"><head>Achilles amongst the Daughters of Lycomedes</head></figure>

<p>A BAS-RELIEF, part of the front of a sarcophagus,
representing Achilles among the daughters of Lycomedes, whom he is quitting to join the Greeks before
Troy. It is 3 feet 8 1/2 inches in length, by 1 foot 11
inches in height.
<p>The story here represented may be told in a few
words:-Thetis, the mother of Achilles, learning, by an
oracle, that the Trojan war would prove fatal to her
son, sent him privately to Lycomedes, king of Scyros,
and for concealment clothed him in female attire. But
as the destruction of Troy was to depend upon the
presence of Achilles, the Greeks, who had learned
where he lay in disguise, deputed Ulysses to discover
him. Ulysses, assuming the dress of a merchant,
arrived at Scyros, and among the toys and articles of
female dress which he offered to the daughters of Lycomedes for purchase, placed some weapons of beautiful
workmanship, which Achilles no sooner saw than lie
handled them with such an air of eagerness as discovered who he was.
<p>Another account says, that while examining the
merchandise, he heard a sudden blast from a trumpet,
and supposing some enemy nigh, he threw off his
female attire, and seized a spear and shield. Thus
detected he was prevailed upon to go to Troy.
<p>This story, however, is not so old as the time of
Homer, who mentions nothing of the concealment of
Achilles, but represents him (see the <bibl>Iliad, Book i.,
line 439</bibl>) as proceeding directly to the Trojan war
from the court of his father.

<p><figure id="fig.071" n="2001.03.0073"><head>Head of Jupiter</head></figure>

<p>IT represents him as middle-aged, with a most beautiful expression of mild and placid benignity in the
features; the hair is arranged in thick matted curls
which fall down to the neck behind, and mingle in
front with the smaller curls of the beard.  It is
manifestly a fragment of a statue of most excellent
sculpture, and of an early period of art, apparently
of the age of Scopas or Polycretus, who flourished
in the fifth century before the Christian era. Mr.
Richard Payne Knight thought that this head might
possibly be a fragment of a statue of Polycretus,
mentioned by Pausanius (a Greek topographical
writer, who flourished about a century after the birth
of Christ), or at least of an ancient copy of it; the
character of the head certainly agrees with the description of the mildness of expression of the figure;
and the style of art may be referred to that period,
which was remarkable for the combination of the ideal
beauty of exquisite forms, which distinguished the
works of Polycretus, with the grandeur and dignity of
the conceptions of Phidias. Polycretus studied under
Argelades, but in the opinion of his contemporaries,
was held superior to his master. He was even in some
instances preferred to Phidias, for although he could
not attain the sublimity of that master, he rivalled or
excelled him in the personation of grace and elegance.
He was remarkable for the care with which he gave
the last finish to his productions.
<p>The surface of the bust is in good preservation, and
the marble, which is Pentelic, that is to say, from
Mount Pentelicus near Athens, is beautifully clear and
white; but the nose has been restored, and a hole
in the left cheek, made by a blow, has been filled up.
<p>It was purchased by Mr. Townley at the Duke of
St. Albans' sale; but he could not learn where it had
been originally discovered. Its height is 1 foot 3 inches.

<p>A TORSO (the name given by artists to those statues of
which the trunk is the only portion remaining,) of a
small but very beautiful statue of Venus. The left
arm is broken off close to the shoulder, the other is
perfect down to the wrist; the legs have been separated a little above the knee, but from what remains
we may judge the right leg to have been slightly
advanced, and the left to have retired proportionately.
The figure, which is of a most delicate form, is in a
stooping position, bending a little to the right side.
Although only 1 foot 1 inch in height, the execution
of this statue is so exquisite; the sculptor has so well
preserved that roundness of form and freedom from
abrupt transitions which characterizes the human
figure when in a state of health and vigour; and the
whole appears so perfectly natural and void of art, that
the admiring spectator finds it difficult to believe that
the marble before him does not expand with the respiration of animated nature.
<p>A labrum (or bathing-vessel) has been recently constructed of wood, on which the statue has been placed;
thus, in some degree taking away from that very imperfect appearance which a torso always presents.
This labrum, with the drapery which hangs from it,
stands about 7 1/2 inches high, making the whole height
of the figure 1 foot and 8 1/2 inches.
<p>It was purchased by Mr. Townley, at Rome, of
Cavaceppi the sculptor, in whose possession it had
remained for many years. We can find no record of
the spot where it was discovered; but it has ever been
considered, and very justly, one of the gems of the
Townley Collection.

<head>Victory Sacrificing a Bull</head>
<p><figure id="fig.108" n="2001.03.0112"><head>Victory Sacrificing a Bull</head></figure>

<p>A GROUP of a winged Victory preparing to sacrifice a
bull. The goddess kneels upon the bull (who is on
the ground) with her left knee, whilst she pulls his
head backwards with her left hand, previous to stabbing him with a short dagger held in her right. The
sculpture of this group is excellent. The height of
the figure of Victory is 2 feet, the plinth about 2 feet
9 inches long.
<p>This, with a similar group of like dimensions, also
in the Townley Collection, in the same room, No. 31,
was found in <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct>, by Mr. Gavin Hamilton, in the
ruins of the Villa of Antoninus Pius, in the spot now
called Monte Cagnuolo, near the ancient Lanuvium, a
mall town on the Appian road, near Rome.
<p>It appears to have been the custom to sacrifice a
bull, on the conquest of any city or kingdom, in honour
of victory.  The subject has been represented on
ancient coins; and statues, similar to the one before us,
have been mentioned by ancient authors. Plutarch,
in his Life of Marcellus, says, it was customary for the
Roman generals in their triumphs (as their processions
into the city on the close of a successful war were
termed) to sacrifice a bull. The same subject is also
represented in two or three bas-reliefs in the British
Museum-see Nos. 24, 26, and 70, in Room I.
<p>This group is very beautifully finished; the elastic
appearance of flesh is well preserved, and there is
much grace in the attitudes of the figures. The drapery also is judiciously adjusted, and by its apparent
motion gives a degree of action to the figure of Victory
which it would otherwise be found deficient in.

<p><figure id="fig.100" n="2001.03.0104"><head>Libera, or the Female Bacchus</head></figure>

<p>A STATUE of Libera, or the female Bacchus, holding a
thyrsus (a staff or spear, bound round with ivy or bay-
leaves) over the right shoulder, and a bunch of grapes
in her left hand. She is clothed in a robe which
reaches to the feet, above which another garment is
fastened by a narrow band passing from the right
shoulder under the left breast.  Her head is surrounded by a wreath of ivy, and her hair, parted above
the forehead, falls in spiral ringlets on the neck. At
her feet is a young panther rising on its hind legs, its
attention evidently excited by the grapes.
<p>This statue, one of the best in the Townley Collection, was found by Mr. Gavin Hamilton, at Roma
Vecchia, a few miles from Rome, on the road to
Frascati; and from that gentleman it passed into the
hands of Mr. Townley.
<p>In the <bibl>"Museo Chiaromonti,"</bibl> published at Rome
in <datestruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></datestruct>, is an engraving of a statue of Bacchus, corresponding very much in its attributes with this of
Libera. The figure of Bacchus is represented naked,
supporting a thyrsus with his left hand, and in his
right holding a bunch of grapes; at his side a tigress
or panther is standing with one paw raised; and his
head is adorned with bunches of grapes. There is
much breadth of effect in this statue; the figure is
tall and graceful, the attitude easy, and the drapery
simple. The unpractised spectator may suppose that
all this may be very easily represented, but the young
artist will know how very difficult it is, even in the
representation of the drapery, to avoid alike a clumsy
coarseness and a trivial frittered appearance in the
folds and arrangement. The name of Libera may
frequently be found applied to Bacchus in the ancient
authors.

brought from Rome in <datestruct value="1785--"><year reg="1785">1785</year></datestruct>; and is probably a portrait, as the features could never have been intended
to represent a model of ideal beauty. A remarkable
feature in this bust, is the arrangement of the hair.
It is divided into a multitude of small plaits which are
all drawn tightly up to the top of the head, and there
twisted into a knot resembling a snail's shell. The
hair appears to have been originally coloured red, as
some of the paint is still visible. This was a practice
not unusual with ancient sculptors. Many specimens
exist in which the hair and eyes are painted, and in
which the drapery and ornaments are composed of
different coloured marbles. Among the Townley Marbles, in Room 12, case No. 8, is a small female head
in white marble, the hair of which is formed of a
distinct and darker marble, and is fitted to the head,
in the manner of a wig. It is marked 26. The relief
produced by the contrast of colours must have greatly
aided the effect of a collection of statues in which the
uniformity of colour is generally found so monotonous.

<head>Figure with a Mask.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.084" n="2001.03.0087"><head>Figure with a Mask</head></figure>

<p>A SMALL statue of a theatrical figure sitting on a
square plinth of a considerable depth. It is 2 feet
high; and in depth from the fore-part of the feet to the
extremity of the plinth, 1 foot 3 1/2 inches. Its dress is
rude, particularly the shoes, which are fastened with
straps; and the feet are placed one upon the other.
The face is covered by a comic mask, the lower part of
which is in the form of a shell.
<p>In the ancient Greek and Roman drama it was
customary for the actors to appear in masks, which
not only covered the face, but in many cases enclosed
the whole head in artificial hair and ornaments. Among
the bas-reliefs in the Townley Collection are many
representations of these masks, particularly in Room
3, Nos. 23 and 25. They varied in form, and were
intended to represent the persons who were introduced
into the piece, so that each character was known as
soon as he came on the stage. The head and countenance being on all sides protected by the covering
of the mask, one aperture only was left for the
emission of the voice, which was thus strengthened
and extended. But it is obvious that the sudden
changes of the countenance, and the fine expression
either of the strong or gentle passions, which give such
pleasure to the spectators, and distinguish our great
actors, could never be so well imitated by masks,
which could only express in all parts the same cast
of countenance ; and the voice alone could but imperfectly notify the changes of passion which were to be
represented to the audience.
<p>This scenic figure was found, with many other
pieces of good sculpture, in the Villa Fonsega on the
Caelian Hill, near Rome, in <datestruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></datestruct>.
<p>There are a few similar figures in various collections
in Italy, two of which are in the Borghese Collection.

<head>Supposed Head of Diomed.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.074" n="2001.03.0076"><head>Head of Diomed</head></figure>

<p>A HEAD full of animation, larger than life, considerably
inclined to the right, and looking upwards. The countenance expresses a mixture of earnestness and anguish. The hair of the head is arranged in bold and
distinct masses; the beard short and almost close to
the face. It formerly received the appellation of a
Titan; but Mr. Combe in his <bibl>"Description of the
Ancient Masks in the British Museum,"</bibl> speaks of it
as a head of one of the Homeric heroes. It is impossible to ascertain the particular person whom it is
intended to represent; but it has been supposed that
it was intended for Diomed (a king of AEtolia, son of
Tydeus and Deipyla, and celebrated as one of the
Grecian heroes in the Trojan war).
<p>This bust was found in <datestruct value="1771--"><year reg="1771">1771</year></datestruct> by Mr. G. Hamilton,
in his great and successful excavations made in that
part of Hadrian's villa now called the Pantinella. As
a specimen of sculpture it has been considered among
the finest monuments of the Macedonian age. Some
fragments were found with it, but whether of this
statue or of a group to which it belonged is uncertain.
A similar head, found in the same excavation, but of
inferior workmanship, is in the Vatican Museum.
<p>The height of this marble is 1 foot 9 1/2 inches. The
nose, a small portion of each lip, part of the lobe of
the right ear, and a tuft of hair on the crown of the
head, together with the bust on which the head is
placed, are modern restorations.

<head>Pigs of Lead.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.076" n="2001.03.0078"><head>Pigs of Lead</head></figure>

<p>THESE pigs, or oblong masses, found in the central
parts of Great Britain, afford undoubted evidence that
the lead-mines of Derbyshire and its neighbourhood
were worked in the Roman time. The inscriptions
also which they bear, usually indicating the Emperor
in whose time the metal was obtained, confirm the
testimony of Pliny, who says, that <quote>"in Britain lead is
found near the surface of the earth in such abundance,
that a law is made to limit the quantity which shall
be taken."</quote> It was, therefore, necessary, in the royal
mines, to mark the lead with the emperor's name. In
a few instances such pigs apparently bear the name of
a private proprietor; but all show that the article was
under fiscal regulation-a regulation which accounts
for the form in which the lead was cast: the inscription, and sometimes a border which surrounds it, always covering the upper area of the piece to its full
extent.
<p>1. The first of these ancient pigs of lead which we
shall notice, is one bearing the name of the Emperor
Domitian ; it is 23 inches in length at the bottom, and
20 on the upper surface, and weighs 154 lbs. It bears
a date which refers to the year 81, A. D., and was discovered in the year <datestruct value="1734--"><year reg="1734">1734</year></datestruct>, a foot and a half under
ground, on Hayshaw Moor, near Ripon in Yorkshire.
It was presented to the Museum in <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, by the executors of Sir W. Ingilby, Bart.
<p>2. The second representation in the engraving bears
an inscription apparently purporting that it was the
property of Lucius Aruconius Verecundus, and that it
is Lutudarian metal, or procured from the Roman
station named Lutudarum, the site of the present town
of Chesterfield. Its greatest length is 20 1/2 inches, by
4 in breadth, and weighs 84 lbs.
<p>3. The last we shall notice (there are two others in
the Museum) is one presented in <datestruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></datestruct> by J. Lloyd,
Esq. Its greatest length is 22 inches, and its weight
191 lbs. It was found at Westbury, 10 miles from
Salup: the inscription is simply, IMP. HADRIANI. AUG.
These pigs were undoubtedly for exportation, and
they prove that the mines were worked by the Britons,
under the inspection of their Roman conquerors.

<head>Roman Soldier in Bronze.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.083" n="2001.03.0086"><head>Roman Soldier in Bronze</head></figure>

<p>THE statue here represented is 22 inches in height,
and seems to be the portrait of some military person
of high dignity. It has been thought, upon comparison with some of the medals of Nero, when young,
to bear a considerable resemblance to that emperor;
but that it really represents him, is very doubtful,
especially as the gorgon's head, by which the military statues of the Roman emperors were uniformly
marked, does not ornament the cuirass, on the upper
part of which, in the centre, we should expect to find
it, were this statue a portrait of an emperor. The
figure stands looking upwards, with one leg resting on
a large stone; the right hand appears to have held a
spear, while the left, which is broken off, may be conceived to have rested on a shield by his side. With
the exception of the left arm the statue is quite perfect, and exhibits some beautiful workmanship; the
cuirass is richly ornamented, and consists of thin
polished laminae; those of a light colour on being
scraped have the appearance of silver; the darker
parts are brittle, and may possibly be a kind of enamel.
<p>The statue was found about the year <datestruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></datestruct>, 12 feet
below the surface of the earth, near Barking-hall, in
Suffolk, on the estate of the Earl of Ashburnham, by

<p><figure id="fig.094" n="2001.03.0098"><head>The Rondinini Faun</head></figure>

<p>THIS figure is represented playing on the cymbals.
The head is turned upwards, the right arm is thrown
slightly backwards after having struck the instruments
and preparatory to another clash, and the left arm is
raised holding one of the cymbals with its face downward. The right leg is advanced, and is supported on
the ball of the foot, whilst the other foot remains on
part of the root of a tree, the trunk of which is made
to support the marble. The figure in its action appears to be moving joyously forward, whilst it enjoys
the sound of the merry cymbals. A pedum, or short
crook, lies upon the plinth.
<p>This statue obtained its distinctive appellation from
its having formed, for a long period, one of the most
remarkable objects in the collection of the Rondinini
Palace in the Corso, at Rome. It is said to have been
sold, some years ago, by the Marchese Rondinini to an
English nobleman, who was, however, prevented from
bringing it to England by the influence of Canova,
which was successfully exerted to prevent its exportation from Italy. But the sculptor having died, and the
Marchese become minister of police, permission for
the removal was given; and, in the month of February,
<datestruct value="1826--"><year reg="1826">1826</year></datestruct>, it was brought to England, by Thomas Shaw,
Esq., of Grosvenor-place, Bath, who sold it the same
year to the British Museum for the price of &pound;300.
<p>The height of the statue, from the base to the upper
part of the cymbal in the left hand, is 6 feet 10 inches.

<head>A Statue of a Discobolus.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.086" n="2001.03.0089"><head>Statue of a Discobolus</head></figure>

<p>A STATUE of a Discobolus (the player with the discus,
in a game similar to that of quoits), who is represented
at that precise moment of time which immediately
precedes the delivery of the discus. It is an ancient
copy in marble, from a celebrated bronze statue, executed by Myron, and is of the size of life.
<p>In the first volume of <bibl>"Specimens of Ancient Sculpture,"</bibl> published by the Dilettanti Society, is the following notice of this statue: <quote>"This is unquestionably
the best of the three ancient copies extant of the Discobolus, or quoit-thrower, of Myron, the statue most
celebrated among the masterpieces of Grecian art, for
its accurate display of technical skill and science in
representing a momentary and violent action of the
human body, for which the artist could have had no
stationary model to assist his memory."</quote> The head of
this statue is, however, different to the account we
have of the original, as well as to the other copies with
which we are acquainted, in both of which the face is
turned back towards the quoit about to be thrown by
the right hand. Mr. Townley thought the head originally belonged to it, but that it had been broken off
and rejoined by an intermediate piece having been
inserted in the neck; but other authorities consider
the head to have belonged to another figure, and to
have been added to this by a modern restorer. Barry,
however, in his lectures, expresses his opinion that
the position of the head in the Townley statue is an
improvement upon the original, as it expresses the
intention of the figure more perfectly.
<p>This statue was found, in <datestruct value="1791--"><year reg="1791">1791</year></datestruct>, in the grounds of the
Conte Fede, at Tiburtina, near Rome, the site of
Hadrian's villa.

which was wanting, was restored by Albacini. It is in

<p>THIS is only 1 foot 11 inches in height, but it is very
beautifully executed. The quiver, on which is thrown
a lion's skin, stands on the ground. and serves as a support to the figure. It was found in <datestruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct>, enclosed within
a large amphora, or vase, filled with earth, at Castello di
Guido, near the ancient Lorium, about 12 miles from
Rome, on the road to Civita Vecchia. This was probably
the site of the villa of Faustina, the wife of Antoninus
Pius, who died here in the 75th year of his age, B. C. 161.
<p>Callistratus describes a statue in bronze, exactly
similar to this in attitude, as a most admired work
of Praxiteles, who flourished in the time of Alexander
the Great. Sir R. Worsley possesses a similar statue
at Appuldescomb, and there is another at Wilton;
neither of these, however, has the lion's skin. But
there are more than a dozen antique statues known,
agreeing with the description of Praxiteles's original,
and although Pausanius only mentions one copy of this
Cupid, namely, one by Menodorus, we may reasonably
conclude that so beautiful a statue would have been
frequently copied by contemporary sculptors.
<p>D'Hancarville in his <bibl>"Recherches sur les Arts de la
Grece,"</bibl> speaking of the copies of Praxiteles's Cupid,
says: <quote>"Of all with which I am acquainted, the best,
without comparison, is that in the Townley Collection.
It is much smaller than the others, and was found
among the ruins of a large building near the lake of
Bracciano. As it was enclosed in an earthen vase, it
has preserved all the polish which it had when it came
from the hands of the artist; but, in order to get it in
the vase, it appears to have been necessary to detach
the wings, and even to break off the feet, which were
found near it, together with the plinth; these, not having
been taken care of like the rest of the statue, have not
preserved the same polish, and are more injured by the
earth in which they were put. The precautions employed to save this statue, the promptitude with which
they were taken not allowing time to choose a larger vase,
incline me to believe that it is among the number of those
which were saved from the zeal of the early Christians,
who, in their ardour for the destruction of idols, entered
the houses, overturned the public monuments, and
broke all the statues of the gods which they could find."</quote>

<head>Statue of Hercules.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.095" n="2001.03.0099"><head>Statue of Hercules</head></figure>

<p>A BRONZE statue of Hercules in which he is represented as having just obtained the golden fruit of the
Hesperides, which he bears in his left hand, the
guardian serpent hanging dead upon a tree behind
him. Part of the ancient club, which was held downwards, remains in the right hand, and betwixt the
wrist and elbow are holes whence the lion's skin was
formerly suspended, some fragments of which are
still preserved in the collection, but in a state too mutilated to be replaced.
<p>The Hesperides, according to Hesiod, were three
sisters, daughters of Night; they had the care
of the tree which bore the golden fruit presented
by Juno to Jupiter on her marriage with him, In
addition to the watchful care of these nymphs, the
tree was guarded by an immense serpent, whose vigilance was never relaxed by sleep. The last labour
imposed upon Hercules by order of Eurystheus<note type=foot n=1>Eurystheus was the son of Sthenelus king of Mycenae. To please
Juno, stepmother to Hercules, he enjoined him to perform several most
hazardous undertakings, hoping he would perish in one of them. But
he surmounted them all, and turned to his glory what was designed for
his ruin. They are generally termed the labours of Hercules.</note>,
was that of carrying away the fruit of the tree, which
he accomplished with the same contempt of danger
that had marked his other exploits, and which seems
to be expressed in the attitude of the present figure.
<p>The height of the statue is 2 feet 6 inches, but including the tree 3 feet 5 3/8 inches. It was found, in
<datestruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></datestruct>, at Gibelet, or Jebel, a small modern town, built
on the site of the ancient Byblos, on the coast of

seems to have been part of an original figure, the
execution as well as the design of which was of the
most refined age of the art. It is quite entire, the
ancient polish of the surface being perfectly preserved
throughout. It was sent from Rome by Mr. Gavin
Hamilton, a gentleman through whose means Mr.
Townley become possessed of many of his most beautiful marbles. Mr. Hamilton was an artist of considerable taste and genius, but he did not long practise his pencil as a profession: devoting the greater
portion of his life to the discovery of ancient monuments.   He made excavations and opened buried
chambers in various places of the Roman states; and
the best collections scattered over Russia, Germany,
Italy, and England, owe many of their principal ornaments to his discoveries. He maintained a correspondence with Mr. Townley (of which a portion may be

<p>A BUST of an unknown female, rather larger than life.
seemingly placed on the petals of a flower. It has
received different appellations-as <quote>"a Grecian lady"</quote>--
<quote>"Isis resting upon the flower of the nymphae lotus"</quote>
-and <quote>"Daphne, enveloped in the laurel."</quote> D'Hancarville supposed it to be sepulchral, designating both the
individual represented and her apotheosis; and Mr.
Townley called it <quote>"Clytie rising from the sunflower."</quote>
But, from the circumstance of the features not being
conformable to the model of ideal beauty, it is probably
no more than the portrait of a lady, executed in the
Roman period of art by a Greek artist.
<p>The features are singularly pleasing, and expressive
of a tender and gentle disposition. The hair, which is
strongly parted above the forehead, is thrown back and
falls in small, graceful ringlets on the neck, A thin
drapery, fastened by studs, covers the right shoulder
and a part of the bosom, leaving the rest, with the left
shoulder, entirely bare. It was purchased at Naples,
in <datestruct value="1772--"><year reg="1772">1772</year></datestruct>, from the Laurenzano family, in whose possession it had been for many years.
<p>Mr. Townley valued this bust above, perhaps, all his
other marbles, and an incident occurred during the
riots in London, in <datestruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></datestruct>, which evinced the estimation
in which he held it. The fury of the mob was especially directed against the Catholic inhabitants, and the
house in Park Street, in which were the principal
portion of Mr. Townley's Collection, having been
marked by these destroyers, he, like others, withdrew
in haste, apprehending their immediate attack. He
had secured his cabinet of gems, and was taking, as he
then feared, a last view of his marbles, when he seized
the bust alluded to, and conveyed it to his carriage.
He used jocosely to call it his wife.

<p><figure id="fig.082" n="2001.03.0085"><head>Statue of the Emperor Hadrian</head></figure>

<p>A STATUE of the Emperor Hadrian in a military dress.
It is in height 7 feet 1 1/4 inch, including the plinth,
which is 4 inches high. It was purchased of Mr. Millingen in <datestruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></datestruct>, but it is not known where it was discovered. The left hand bears a perizonium, or small
sword, sheathed; and a chlamys, or short cloak, falls
from the left shoulder, and is wound about the arm.
The cuirass is in high preservation, and richly ornamented.  On the upper part, near the neck, is the
gorgon's head, which was the usual ornament on the
upper part of an emperor's breastplate.
<p>Hadrian succeeded Trajan in the year <datestruct value="117--"><year reg="117">117</year></datestruct> of the
Christian era, and died atBaiae, in the year <datestruct value="138--"><year reg="138">138</year></datestruct>, in the
63rd year of his age, or according to another authority
(Spartianus), in his 72nd year. He is considered to
have been one of the best of the Roman emperors, and
was distinguished by many great virtues, as well as by
the solidity of his talents. No Roman emperor, perhaps, ever manifested so much ardour in the pursuit
of knowledge as Hadrian. Gibbon observes, that his
life was almost a perpetual journey. He was an enlightened patron of the fine arts, and enriched Italy
with many hundred statues, which he transported from
Greece to Rome; and it is to the good taste of this
emperor (who caused so many fine specimens of
sculpture to be collected in the splendid villa which
he built on the banks of the Tiber), that we are indebted for a great portion of the beautiful statues and
busts which adorn not only the Townley, but other
galleries of ancient marbles. Hadrian was buried, in
the first instance, at Puteoli (Pozzuolo) near Baiae;
but his ashes were afterwards carried to Rome by order
of Antoninus Pius, and deposited in the noble mausoleum which Hadrian had erected there, and which,
though divested of its former magnificence, still exists
under the name of the Castle of St. Angelo.

<head>The Portland Vase.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.085" n="2001.03.0088"><head>The Portland Vase</head></figure>

<p>IN the centre of this room, which is at the head of the
stairs leading into the apartment containing the antique
bronzes and other articles from the collection of Sir
W. Hamilton, is placed one of the gems of the British
Museum. This is the Portland, or, it is sometimes
called, the Barberini Vase, of which we present the
reader with views of two opposite sides. It is of a
circular form, gradually swelling from the base until
the juncture of the lower portions of the handles, when
it rapidly diminishes towards the top; and at the point
where the upper parts of the handles are united to the
body of the vase, it again expands slightly, until, at
the lip of the vessel, it turns over in a graceful curve.
The material is a vitrified paste, or glass, of a very deep
but transparent blue; on which is cemented, on the
lower part of the vase, a composition of many figures
most beautifully executed in a white semi-opaque substance. Of the subject of this composition no satisfactory explanation has ever been given, (see, however,
the <bibl>Penny Magazine, vol. i. p. 249</bibl>, and <bibl>vol. viii. p. 2</bibl>);
but the design, the expression, and the modelling of
the figures, are all in the best style of Grecian art.
The dimensions of this admirable production are but
small; it is about 10 inches in height, by about 6 in
diameter in the broadest part. It was discovered about
the middle of the 10th century, enclosed in a marble
sarcophagus, within a sepulchral chamber of the Emperor Alexander Severus, under the Monte del Grano
near Rome, on the Frascati road. The vase remained
in the palace of the Barberini family at Rome (where
the sarcophagus still is) for more than two centuries;
when it fell into the hands of Sir W. Hamilton, from
whom it was purchased nearly forty years ago by the
Duchess of Portland, for 1000 guineas, and was deposited in the British Museum, in <datestruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></datestruct>, by the Duke
of Portland. A few casts in plaster of Paris were taken
from this vase by Tassie, the celebrated modeller; and
some very beautiful imitations have been fabricated by
the Wedgwoods, in which the colour has been attempted to be preserved, but modern art cannot well
imitate the vitrified appearance of the ancient material.

<p>THE object which first presents itself in this wood-cut
is a Roman steelyard, or Trutina Compana, used for
weighing (see case 38). Great care was taken to enforce a strict uniformity in the weights and measures
used throughout the Roman empire; all weights and
scales had to be proved in the capitol, and standard
measures were preserved there in the same manner
as in the court of Exchequer in England. It is composed of bronze, which in the part supporting the
weight is formed in the shape of a rope, and of the
length of about 2 feet. This is in very perfect preservation. In the same and adjoining cases are several other
specimens of scales, to which we would direct attention.
Articles precisely similar to these ancient instruments,
and known by the name of steelyards, are manufactured
in England at the present day.
<p>Surrounding this steelyard in the cut are represented
several specimens of ancient lamps. They are all of
bronze, and of very elegant forms, but the two lower
ones are remarkable for the sculptures with which they
are adorned.
<p>Fig. 1 (in case 20), is about 4 inches in length; it is
without a handle, and altogether of the simplest form.
<p>The lamp marked as fig. 2 in the cut is more complicated, the handle being formed by the head and legs of
a grotesque animal. The length of this lamp is about
9 inches. It will be found in case 18.
<p>Fig. 3 is 6 inches long, and of a very elegant shape.
This is in the case marked 21.
<p>Fig. 4 is a lamp for two wicks; it is very beautifully
carved, and measures 6 inches in length by about 5 1/2
in height. See case 18.
<p>Fig. 5 is one of similar workmanship, about 8 inches
long, by the same in height. This also is in case 18.
<p>These lamps were not only placed on the stand of a
candelabrum, but were often hung from projecting
branches, which many candelabra are found ornamented
with; and the chains, by which they were suspended,
are still remaining.

<head>Tripod, Basket, and Candelabra.</head>
<p><figure id="fig.016" n="2001.03.0017"><head>Tripod, Basket, and Candelabra</head></figure>

<p>Two of the articles represented in this cut are candelabra, or stands for the support of a lamp. Most of
those which have been found are either of marble,
bronze, or iron, although doubtless they were made
also of the more precious metals. The stands before
us are exceedingly elegant in form although as simple
as possible; they are tall slender shafts of bronze, supported by three legs, and surmounted by a stand for
the lamp. One of them (see case 38) is in the form of
a reed, 4 feet 9 inches in height, perfectly destitute of
ornament; the other is a column, supported by the
legs of an animal, and surmounted with an ornament
in the shape of a vase, sculptured with the leaves of
plants.
<p>Between these two articles in the cut (and in the
same case, 38), is a tripod, or three-legged table of
bronze.  It is of peculiar construction, being contrived to open or shut up at pleasure; each of the legs
is united to the others by two braces, the lower ends
of which are at liberty to play up and down upon the
narrow portion of the legs, while at the upper ends,
and at the point where they cross each other, they are
only allowed to move round upon a pin or hinge., As
the pan at top may be removed at pleasure, it is evident
from the construction, that the legs may either be
pushed close together, or drawn further apart, until
the rings reach the limit of their assigned range, and
thus the tripod may be made to receive a larger or
smaller top, according to the purposes for which it may
be wanted.
<p>Above this table, in the wood-cut, is placed a very
elegant vase or basket with a swing handle, about
11 inches in height. It is composed of bronze, very
delicately engraved with some elegant ornaments.
This is in the adjoining case, 39.
