<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<head>A FEW WORDS TO THE RELIGIOUS PUBLIC.</head>
<p>THE respectable persons who claim for themselves the name of the
Religious Public have succeeded, by digging up a clause in a forgotten
Act of Parliament, in excluding all those hardworkers of London
who take holiday on Sunday, from enjoying walks and rest in the
Parks, Gardens, and 20 acres of Conservatory of the Crystal Palace
at Sydenham.</p><p>
The legitimate successors of Sir Andrew Agnew have carried an
organised agitation from town to town and from parish to parish;
agitators paid and unpaid have held public meetings and hawked
memorials from door to door, against what, by begging the whole
question they call <q> the desecration of the Sabbath.</q>
</p><p>Nothing is more easy than to attract a considerable number of men,
women, and children, to hear a Clergyman declaiming more or less
eloquently on any given subject, or to procure an unlimited number of
signatures for or against any undertaking recommended by respectable
well-meaning people.
</p><p>In the present case the gentlemen who have taken <q>The better
<pb id="p.1" n="1">
observance of the Sabbath</q> under their charge, assume that the
opening of the Crystal Palace on Sunday will be a desecration of that
holy day, the commencement of a new and fatal epoch, in which the
people of England abandoning the pious habits of their forefathers
will fall into the loose and vicious habits of those European States
where Sunday is treated as a mere day of pleasure, which may at will
be turned into a day of work, and the whiz of saws and the echoes
of anvils may be heard mingling with dance, music, and opera
performances.
</p><p>The anti-Crystal Palace cry, based on fallacious assumptions, having
been once raised, has been repeated by well-meaning, but ignorant
simple-minded personages, with so much exaggeration that there are
no doubt many who imagine that the Crystal Palace and Park on
Sundays will be a sort of combination of Vauxhall and the French
Dancing Gardens-that a vast multitude of well-conducted persons
will be induced to neglect their religious duties and to indulge in
dissipation of various kinds, to which if it had not been for this new
Temple of Pleasure they would have been strangers.
</p><p>Want of candour and charity, and the utter ignorance of what is
passing in the every-day world, are equally remarkable in the leaders of
the movement for what is called <q>better observance of the Sabbath.</q>
</p><p>For the purpose of creating a popular party-cry they assume that it
is intended to make the Park at Sydenham a place of vain amusement
and loose festivity; on the one hand, they do not take the least
trouble to ascertain what are the plans and the regulations under which
it is to be thrown open on Sunday afternoon; on the other, they
altogether ignore the thousands of gin-shops, and rum and gin-
gardens, miscalled tea-gardens, which are now open from midday to
midnight of every Sunday.
</p><p>It is a curious fact that all the avowed and anonymous authors of
attacks on the Crystal Palace Company have taken it for granted that
the new palace, like that in Hyde Park, will be nothing more than a
vast bazaar through which crowds may wander from hour to hour
gazing, admiring, and valuing the various articles of luxury and
convenience. Nine-tenths of the people who join in the Anti-Crystal
Palace howl or groan assume that it will be a combination of a fair,
a panorama, and a theatre.</p>
<pb id="p.2" n="2">
<p>The Crystal Palace will certainly include a great bazaar of beautiful
useful and curious articles for exhibition and sale, it will include
galleries of statues, and perhaps of pictures, and models and machines
in motion; but on a Sunday, everything appertaining to commerce,
everything in the nature of a show, will be closed, the looms will
cease to weave, the automatons to sing, the sale departments will be
shut.</p><p>But there will remain for the use and admiration of that great
public, which has no rest and little fresh air except on Sunday, the
Park, the out-door Gardens and fountains, and walks and seats within
the vast Conservatory in which the vegetable productions of many
climates will be displayed.
</p><p>The draper's man or artisan with his wife and little ones, after six
days spent in the atmosphere of his shop, or factory, will be able, regard-
less of storms of rain, snow, or sleet, that rage outside, to walk or sit
down among orange and lemon trees, tea and coffee shrubs, tall
palms, gigantic cacti; he can there point out to his children the
productions of Spain and Italy, of China and Ceylon, of the Pacific, of
India, and of Mexico.
</p><p>The space devoted for Sundays use, will in fact be two great Gardens,
one out of doors, and the other under glass, the one devoted to the
trees and plants of temperate, the other to those of tropical, and
semi-tropical regions. The arrangements of the enclosed portion
comprise eye lessons on the natural history of the earth, its geology,
its vegetable productions, its animals arranged in groups according to
climate, and also the various races of men. Not a museum of articles
ranged in rows for the ignorant to stare at and the learned to study,
but an epitome of an illustrated Book of Nature.*
</p><p>In these Sunday Gardens of the Crystal Palace no intoxicating
liquors will be consumed, no riotous conduct, no indecent language
will be permitted. Every debasing influence will be excluded, and
the utmost pains taken to render it the favourite resort of the families
<NOTE  place="foot">* The world was not made to be inhabited by beasts, but studied and contemplated
by man-it is the debt of our reason we owe unto God, and the homage we pay for not
being beasts. The wisdom of God receives small honour from those vulgar heads that
rudely stare about and with gross rusticity admire His works. Those highly magnify Him
whose judicious inquiry into His acts and deliberate research into His creatures, return the
duty of a devout and learned admiration.-<emph>Sir Thomas Overbury</emph>.</NOTE>
<pb id="p.3" n="3">
whose means do not allow them the benefit of a quiet garden of
their own.
</p><p> The opportunity of exercise in pleasant walks, rest on convenient seats,
refreshment of a wholesome kind at a moderate cost, instruction in
the wonders and beauties of nature,-these, with the music of running
waters and bubbling fountains, will be the class of attractions provided
to invite the presence of that class which is in the habit of seeking on
Sunday some change of scene from the monotonous labours of the
week. Why is a walk in the Gardens of Sydenham more improper
than on Clapham Common or Hampstead Heath, or the Gardens
of Kensington or Kew, or Hampton Court ?
</p><p>Who are the Sunday customers of excursion trains ? Who are the
people who fill suburban tea-gardens-who are the multitude found
towards the close of a summer's Sunday evening, crowding the steam-
boats and the omnibuses, and wearily treading the great entrances
into London ?
</p><p>They are a class of whom the platform orators on Sabbath observ-
ance and their respectable well-to-do friends know nothing-they see
them from afar off as we see bats or mice, and sympathise as little
with their real wants and pains and aches as we do with those lower
animals.
</p><p>A large proportion of the respectable individuals who assume to
themselves sometimes the title of the <soCalled>Religious,</soCalled> and other times of
the <soCalled>Christian</soCalled> Public, are persons who never in their lives knew
what hard-work means; they are well clad, they live in good houses,
they sleep softly, either they have incomes which give them a decent
competence, or are engaged in pursuits which only require regular
attendance for limited hours in snug offices and counting-houses.
They are the class described in one of the Anti-Crystal Palace
pamphlets, as living near to Sydenham and deeply to be pitied because
their Sabbath rest would be disturbed. <q>Merchants and tradesmen,
who having toiled hard all the week in counting-house or shop, look
forward to a real Sabbath in their quiet suburban houses.</q>
</p><p>Such people have good gardens and plenty of exercise, horses and
carriages-the best seat in the omnibus-a railway season ticket, they
go to the sea side, if so inclined, every summer, they take a trip to
Scotland or the Continent, they desire to rest on Sunday, and their
<pb id="p.4" n="4">
rest is to be still. If they walk, they walk in their gardens and
conservatories, or round their fields, and on a Sunday they do not trouble
the baker,-because they have excellent cooks at home.
</p><p> Such wealthy Sabbatarians remind one of the monks of old, who
fasted on the finest vegetables, and on fish of magnificent proportions,
kept alive until the appointed moment in streams running through
their kitchens, such as Beckford described in the Convent of Alcobaca.
</p><p> Contrast with the week-days and Sundays of the banker, the
merchant, the first-class tradesman, and the wives and daughters of the
same, who help to swell the crowds of memorialists for stopping Sunday
trains, and shutting up the <q> Palace and Park of Temperance,</q> with
the condition of a very important, a very numerous, but very unpic-
turesque and unromantic class of men and women.
</p><p> According to the reports of the Early Closing Association, there are
not less than one hundred thousand souls engaged in the shops of the
metropolis.
</p><p> A hundred thousand souls who pass from twelve to fourteen, and
even sixteen, hours on their feet, in one close atmosphere, contaminated
with human breath, thickened with dust, poisoned with gas!
</p><p> Day after day, without change and without relaxation of any kind,
except what is to be snatched at untimely hours of night or morning,
these shop-servers must sleep either in the houses where they work, in
dormitories more or less uncomfortable, or in lodgings close at hand.
These people have no cosy study to retire to; even in their bed-
chambers they are not alone; they have not the advantage of the
evening walk or ride to the suburbs, which has become part of the
system of the more opulent trading classes of London. They have
little chance of the vacation ramble at Margate, Ramsgate, or Brighton,
still less a tour through Switzerland or up the Rhine. A few days'
holiday, and one or two pounds to spare, are the utmost they can
aspire to; and these are the victims whom a section of the religious
public seek to imprison within the circle of the streets of London, and
to debar from any other resource than the public-house; the public-
house which is to be found at the corner of every street from
Kensington to Bow.
</p><p> The vice of the well-to-do religious public lies in their want of
sympathy with the hard-working bread-winners in unpicturesque
<pb id="p.5" n="5">
occupations. A beggar in rags may melt their hearts, and unloose their
purse-strings. A Kaffir, a Krooman, a Hindoo Pariah, a Cuban, or
Carolina slave excites their warmest pity and most lively emotions;
but they hear with wonderful equanimity of the hard labour, the priva-
tions, the actual sufferings of the small tradesmen and hundred
thousand shop-attendants, whom the spread of luxuries dooms to a life
of brick-walls and paved streets.
</p><p>Again, beside the hundred thousand who are banded together for the
boon of closing labour at eight o'clock in winter and ten in summer!
there are the numerous tribe of clerks, obliged to keep up a decent
appearance on small salaries, in very responsible employments,
living in cramped lodgings or miniature cottages, who seldom see
their children except on Sundays. There are tens of thousands of
mechanics, and others following occupations created by the highly
civilised state of society in which we live-engaged in producing those
articles of comfort and luxury which smooth the path of the wealthy.
</p><p>For all these town-working people, what day of rest is there-what
opportunity of exchanging the close air of the city, of seeing grass, and
trees, and flowers-of stretching their limbs and expanding their lungs
-of laying in a stock of health for the ensuing week-except on the
one day set apart for rest, the Sunday ? It is a libel on the goodness
of God to believe that His day was intended as a punishment for the
poor and a luxury for the rich.
</p><p>The agricultural labourer, whose time is passed in the fields, may be
well content on that day <emph>to sit still</emph>; to the townsman the <emph>rest of
exercise</emph> is as essential as the rest from motion to the ploughman or the
postman.
</p><p>It is the small shopkeepers, the shop-assistants male and female, the
mechanics who now fill the river steamboats, the excursion trains, the
parks, the tea-gardens of the metropolis, who would and will fill the
walks and terraces, and sit under the groves and alcoves of the Crystal
Palace, whenever common-sense, and common humanity triumph over
the clamour of ignorant bigotry.
</p><p>But before the London section of the religious public commit them-
selves permanently to the conspiracy for blocking up the first great
example of an Intellectual Temperance Garden open to the Sunday
excursionists, it would be well that they first ascertain what sort of
<pb id="p.6" n="6">
places of rest, refreshment, and amusement are now open to those who
are not able, and not inclined, to confine themselves to the streets of
London on their one day of rest; because facts in the shape of open
gin-gardens, crowded taverns, empty churches, form a very important
part of the case of the gentlemen who claim to enter into competition,
with gardens, fountains and tea, and such-like temperance refreshment,
against the brewers and distillers.
</p><p>It will not do to set up the proprietors of the Crystal Palace
Company as model philanthropists. It is the height of folly to
insinuate or assume that the shareholders are willing to spend three-
quarters of a million in order to educate and improve the people; they
are, in point of fact, the same class of speculators as those who make
canals, docks, railways, and even build churches on their estates, to
improve the value of adjacent building land. But they have been
shrewd enough to see that the improved moral and intellectual tone
of the English Public demands something better than a glass of grog
and a few yards of turf for Sunday relaxation, or than the capering of
a band of half-naked ballet-girls for week-days; and therefore they
have prepared a garden, a museum, where people can be innocently
idle, or earnestly studious, if they please; and they hope to make a
fortune by it. And as long as all conditions of men are paid, from
the beadle to the Archbishop, from the brewer for his liquor to the
Wesleyan for his preaching, there is no reason why they should not
derive a profit from an investment for the use of the Sunday public,
as well as the newspaper proprietor, who on the Sunday prepares a
Monday newspaper, or the pier proprietor, who on the Sunday also takes
toll-pence from the steam-boat traveller on his way to the taverns of
Battersea, Putney, or Richmond.
</p><p>But in an artificial state of society, quite unlike the mode of life in
Pitcairn's Island, we must, if we are to do any good, look round and
see what exists, and then, arguing by comparison, decide whether the
Crystal Palace is not a great step in advance on public amusements
now tolerated, and by taxation sanctioned.
</p><p>With this end I and my friends have done what it would be well if
the religious public would also do-we have shared the Sunday, the
amusements of London and its suburbs, and sketched from life, without
exaggeration, the Sunday scenes I am about to describe. These
<pb id="p.7" n="7">
scenes, or similar, are patronised by full a million souls. They are
unknown to those who tremble, who rave, who write, who petition
against such a desecration of Sunday as the opening the Crystal
Palace.
</p><p> I write no romance. I have painted what I have seen; I give this
as my evidence on the Sunday question. I challenge contradiction.</p>
<pb id="p.8" n="8"></div1>
<div1 type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<head>CHALK FARM AND HAMPSTEAD HILL.</head>
<p> LET US cross the Regent's Park without joining any of our friends
in the pleasant enclosure, or, by the way, without taking advantage of our
subscription to the Zoological Gardens-let us see what people do on a
Sunday who, living within reach of the Regent's Park, are not of that
class who live in terraces or can subscribe guineas to gardens. Pass out
over the Suspension Bridge, turn to the right, and you have before you
the conical hill, green in the spring, and brown and bare before the end
of the summer, with the treading of many hundred thousand feet, which
gives to many smaller children their first idea of a mountain. This is
Chalk Farm or Primrose Hill; on any week day except Monday and
the two holidays of Englishmen, Primrose Hill is almost solitary,
the visitors, few, select, and juvenile. But Sunday sees another sight.
On every fine Sunday at least Primrose Hill becomes a human ant-hill,
all ages, both sexes, take possession of the sward from an early hour,
and there seek rest or amusement according to taste.
</p><p> The same feeling that sends a fashionable party to wander in
Richmond Park, and dine at the Star and Garter, sends Father and
Mother, Dick, Jane, Tom, and Polly, and the baby, to Primrose Hill-
so too while Lord Harry and Sir John are having a quiet game of ecarte
at the Coventry, One-eyed Jack, Red Pat, and Joe the Lumper, are
playing the little odd man on Chalk Farm.
</p><p> Primrose Hill is the commencement of a series of fields, partly
intersected by half-finished streets and clusters of villas, leading on to
Hampstead Heath, across which, from time immemorial, footpaths
<pb id="p.9" n="9">
have been trodden. It is impossible for any one of right feeling to
pass along these fields on a Sunday afternoon without desiring that
they might be preserved perpetually in their present rural state, for
the benefit of the multitude now swarming across it. The view of
London from the brow of these fields, far extending, a wilderness
of streets shrouded in a canopy of mist and smoke, with the long
line of Surrey hills rising beyond, is indeed imposing. There is
quiet in these fields-the speckled cows graze around undisturbed
by the children playing-trees in clumps make such a leafy screen,
that it is possible to imagine oneself miles distant in some rural county.
The influence of the scene is stamped on the countenance of those
who frequent the sylvan scene on the warm days of spring, summer,
and autumn.
</p><p> The greater number are evidently respectable tradesmen and
mechanics with their families, taking this pleasant route to Hampstead
Heath, or sitting on the turf inhaling the purer air and enjoying the
mental contrast between the noisy London in which they live, and the
silent London that lies below them.
</p><p> Those who do not know how softening, how humanising are the
effects of rural walks, on town-toiled men, may gather evidence not to
be despised, as near as Hampstead.
</p><p> It is true that all we meet in such resorts are not quiet and
contemplative, but it is easy to see that, dispersed over a large space,
the conduct of the uneducated is more influenced by good example
than when crammed into hot gin palaces and frowzy tavern parlours.
The true philanthropist will not be diverted from his purpose of general
improvement by the language, the dress, the demeanour, of a few
vagabond groups who perhaps are ruffians because they have not enough
education to be blacklegs. Rough, rude people will go on living, in spite
of the disgust of the genteel-and it is easy after visiting such resorts
as Primrose Hill and Hampstead Heath to satisfy ourselves that we do
not increase, but rather diminish evil influences, by removing a
population that exists whether we see it or not from courts and alleys
to parks and open fields.
</p><p> But although there is much to gratify in the decent, happy expression
of those who wander about refreshing their lungs and their limbs,
between Kensington Gardens and Hampstead Hill, we must not forget
<pb id="p.10" n="10">
that our climate is uncertain and that man is an eating-drinking
animal. Indeed, we cannot if we would, forget it. As we look down
from Haverstock Hill towards Primrose Hill, we see in various
directions the commencement of works in brick and compo; wherever
there is a new street, one corner is formed by a mansion of more
stately elevation than the rest of the row-rich in such architectural
decorations as Mr. Stuccoe loves, with a fine portico, highly ornamented
windows, and not unfrequently a terrace roof with massive balustrades.
These mansions are places kindly provided by the enterprise of
brewers and distillers for the refreshment of suburban wanderers,
and graciously licenced by the magistracy. They are thrown up
on military principles-they command every defile. The wife of the
<soCalled>thirsty soul,</soCalled> however ingenious her geography, cannot escape them
when once she reaches the regions of brick. She has no resource but
to wait outside with the children, or go in to join in the <soCalled> one more
half pint.</soCalled>
</p><p> To the existence of taverns and beer-houses in the outskirts of
London there can be no abstract objection. But when we hear so
much of Crystal Palace desecration, two points occur to us. One is
that the state of our laws offers a premium to the man who tempts
the Sunday wayfarer to alcoholic instead of to temperance drinks; and
the other that when these green fields have disappeared in dusty
streets, the only monuments of the glories of departed scenery will be
found in the terrace roofs of the gin palaces.
</p><p> As a specimen of what is permitted within earshot and eyesight of
a very refined public, I have given a sketch from nature of a Sunday
scene at the foot of Primrose Hill. I had not space for the van loads
which are discharged in Camden Town.
</p><p> The Chalk Farm taverns supply to the class who frequent them
refreshment and amusement answering to that afforded to a different
class at the Trafalgar, Greenwich, and the Star and Garter, Richmond.
The one boasts its company in four-in-hand drags and neat Broughams.
The other attracts a number of clients in gaily painted vans and
costermongers' carts.
</p><p> Enterprising individuals have provided amusements for the fre-
quenters of the district, which certainly enliven the scene if they do not
add much to the intellectual instruction of the partakers and spectators.</p>
<pb id="p.11" n="11">
<p> My frontispiece, sketched from the road, presents a view of the
<soCalled>neat but unpretending</soCalled> facade of the Primrose Tavern, conveniently
situated within a stone's throw of the Hill. If thirsty, you will have
considerable difficulty on a hot Sunday, in making your way to the
bar, where a light lively conversation of gents, on the Sunday spree,
addressed to ladies of the same mind, is unharmoniously diversified by
the cries of unhappy infants, and the remonstrances of prudent wives,
endeavouring to get their husbands home with some remains of a
week's wages.
</p><p> Outside, a gentleman in the most inviting terms, with rapidity which
only Charles Mathews could imitate, offers to ascertain your exact
weight, by <q> the famous machine which obtained the gold medal at the
Great Exhibition;</q> and for the same small charge will enable you to
test the strength of your lungs by following some hundreds in blowing
into a sort of India rubber register.
</p><p> For those whose tastes do not lie in the way of weights and
measures, roundabouts and swings are provided in close vicinity to
a tent of thirsty souls. Thus both parties derive mutual encourage-
ment. The happy smoker in the tent gazes and sips, and sips and
gazes with amusement or admiration on fair forms floating in mid-air,
encouraged to strange feats by the pipe-and-pot applause. If the
roundabout is not your taste, then military ardour may be satisfied in
<q>The Primrose Rifle Grounds,</q> at a penny a shot.
</p><p> Thus, between the popping of rifles, the shouts of heroes, excited
by the more than ordinary gyrations of the swing, the screams of
heroines, and the applause of the sots in the tent, the foot of Primrose
Hill, in spite of the subduing presence of policemen, does not afford
exactly the place for Sabbath meditations, and is a scene likely to
produce no elevating effect on the moral tone of the rising generation.
</p><p> Yet Primrose Hill Tavern is only one among scores of similar
resorts round London on Sunday.</p>

<div1 type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<head>CITY CHURCHES.</head>
<p> IN those days, which people who indulge a sentimental love of the
past call <soCalled> good </soCalled> and <soCalled>old,</soCalled> when Pepys gossiped, Evelyn moralised, and
Wren built; when king and courtiers were witty and profligate, and their
humbler imitators were profligate and not witty, the city was what it now
is not-a place of residence. There the merchant princes of England
lived in stately mansions on the lap of Father Thames, and displayed
a solid and heavy, if not a splendid or elegant hospitality in buildings
now desecrated, by the innovations of commerce, to the custody of sacks
and barrels, jars and bales of goods. It was in such earlier reigns that
the piety of our forefathers supplied the spiritual wants of the city with
numerous churches then really required, appreciated, and used-
now very handsome, very comfortable, but always very empty-snug
sinecures for invalid, idle, or studious incumbents, but a useless
congregation of steeples in a congregationless district. In the neigh-
bourhood of Gracechurch and Lombard Street there is a cluster of
spires within stone's throw of each other. Their several Rectors and
Vicars might stand each on his own watch-tower, and could they
still the roar of traffic in the adjoining streets, might without difficulty
enter into conversation. When these churches* were first built, the
streets in which they stand were inhabited. People employed in
business resided in the City, slept there, eat there, entertained there-
spent their Sundays there-Tyburnia had not then become fashionable
<NOTE place=foot>* Vide Newcourt's Repertorium Londinense.</NOTE>
<pb id="p.13" n="13">
-Belgravia was a marshy swamp. The merchant had no princely
mansion at the west end-his clerk no villa at Camberwell, or cottage
at Islington. At present there are parts of London which, densely
crowded in the day time, are every night, and the whole of Sunday,
almost entirely empty. A single clerk remains in a Bank where fifty
or sixty are daily employed, and where hundreds come to pay, and
thousands to draw out money One or two servants are left in charge
of a solicitor's office where twenty clerks have been employed during the
day, and where clients innumerable have flocked like sheep to the
slaughter. It is therefore what Mr. Thomas Carlyle would call a
<soCalled> sham,</soCalled> and Lord Denman <soCalled>a delusion and a snare,</soCalled> to keep up these
expensive and useless edifices when their day for usefulness has
departed. Had an Ecclesiastical Commission ever been appointed,
which had the slightest intention of doing any practical good, this is
one of the first abuses the Commissioners should have exposed and
destroyed. As it is, we have seen of late in the House of Lords some
bungling legislation on the subject which began with blunders, and has
ended, if not in discomfiture, in delay. Were a thorough investigation
of Charitable Trusts attempted, the tranquillity of this dream-land of
otiose Parsondom must infallibly be disturbed. For report says (but
we must of course charitably remember that Fame is a liar), that in
these small parishes without inhabitants so snugly adjacent on such a
small area, there is a yearly mal-appropriation of some hundreds of
pounds. One daring Radical reformer, not fifty miles from Lombard
Street, informs me that several large bequests intended for the poor, or
for the Church, are expended in paying Church rates, and that even
worse sacrilege than this takes place, when Parson, Churchwardens,
and Vestrymen, who could all eat good dinners at home at their own
expense, go down to Blackwall and Greenwich to devour Whitebait and
imbibe Moselle from funds intended by our generous and confiding
ancestors to feed the hungry, and relieve the suffering. Now for this
lamentable state of affairs I do not blame the clergy themselves. It is
the Bishops- the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and the loud-voiced
Reformers in Church and State who have allowed this nest of abuses
to escape their boasted vigilance. It is no fault of the incumbents
themselves that they do not attract congregations. There is no flock
to come. One out of the six churches in the district of which I have
<pb id="p.14" n="14">
spoken would amply supply the spiritual wants of the neighbourhood,
while the other five might be transplanted with most advantageous
effect to suburbs with large populations and scanty church accommoda-
tion. This course, which should have been taken years ago, will,
perchance, in some distant future be adopted when the abuse has been
ventilated by discussion, and public opinion will no longer tolerate so
gross an absurdity.
</p><p>It would force me into personalities which I am above all things
anxious to avoid, did I attempt to fill up with my pen the sketch made
with my pencil, the accuracy of which may be tested by any of my
readers who may think to visit on Sunday afternoon the Church of
St. Peter le Poor, Old Broad Street, City. As a specimen of an
afternoon congregation it forms no exception to the general rule of City
Churches. But to the small cluster of spires of which I have been
previously speaking, even in the morning no amount of zeal or eloquence
can succeed in attracting a large audience. Many of my readers may
remember the account given by Mr. Carlyle of the church in which he
heard his friend John Sterling preach, and in which his biographer tells
us that he might have amused himself by rifle shooting without peril to
one Christian life. More will call to mind Charles Dickens' description
of the sacred building in which Mr. and Mrs. Dombey were married.
There is something altogether distinct and peculiar about these
churches. There is an air of quiet rich indolent respectability about
them-they do not unnecessarily obtrude themselves. The money-
changers of the adjoining streets, though they do enter the temple
itself, traffic so vehemently around, that the striking of the clocks is
scarcely heard, the ringing of the bells falls faintly on the ear-in fact,
the general disposition which they evince to be retiring gives to them
the appearance of being ashamed of their strange and anomalous
position. This is rather their exterior aspect. When you enter them,
emptiness and uselessness are their most striking characteristics. In
the incumbents themselves there is nothing very distinguishing except,
perhaps, that the habit of reading and preaching to so limited a number
superinduces a careless and rather indolent way of doing both. In the
clerks there is the same diversity as everywhere else-from the young
and dandy to the old deaf and semi-imbecile clerk. Take them all in
all, the clerks of churches are an extraordinary race; and they are as
<pb id="p.15" n="15">
great an ecclesiastical nuisance as they are a phenomenon. Why, when
the officiating clergyman reads one verse of a Psalm, the congregation
cannot audibly respond, without being led (or rather <emph>mis</emph>led) by some
consequential fellow who is either too illiterate or too affected to read
with decency, much less with devotion, I cannot comprehend. Lord
Chesterfield has well observed that it is very unphilosophical to assail
any body of men as a class, and certainly the clergy are not the one
which I should single out for attack. The influence they <emph>might</emph> use
in behalf of the vast body of the working-classes it would be impos-
sible to over-estimate. The good which they actually do, though
far below what it might be, is not inconsiderable. Though some of
them may lay aside the clerical character on every day except
the first of the week-though others may shock us by their love
of pleasure, their levity, their desire to be fashionable, their sub-
servience to the rich and great, their greed and their grasping, yet
who will deny that there are among them many heroic, self-
denying men, toiling for miserable pittances in a self-devoting con-
scientious spirit, doing their duty as if ever <q> under their great
Taskmaster's eye </q>-true helpers of the oppressed and <q> Tribunes of
the People ? </q></p>

<div1 type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<head>FORE-CABIN OF GRAVESEND STEAMER.</head>
<p> <foreign lang=la><q>PER ardua ad alta</q></foreign> would not be an inappropriate motto for a
Gravesend steamer-<emph>i. e.</emph> supposing we translate it <q> through difficulties
to the deep.</q> If not for the steamboat itself, it most certainly would
be for the passengers-and above all, Sunday passengers. After a
trip by one of these vessels it is difficult to understand what are the
attractions which can induce people to voyage so far in such crowded
discomfort. In July and August, when the weather is warmer, then
it is that the captain of steamboat Meteor, or some other steam craft
with an equally good name, is brought before the Lord Mayor or some
other city magistrate, for overcrowding his boat, the number allowed to
him by law being only seven hundred, or within a few of that number.
But in May and June there are usually quite sufficient persons on
board these steamers to make the voyage uncomfortable, if not
dangerous.
</p><p> It is not that Gravesend is the most charming place in the world.
The sands there are scarcely famous-nor sea-bathing very good-and
Rosherville-classic Rosherville even with its noble association with
the name and title of Baron Nathan-is not Paradise itself. And even
were Gravesend the <q> Baiae amaenae </q> of our capital, and the neigh-
bouring gardens, Eden itself, the Sunday steamer visitors have time
for but a brief stay amid these delectable scenes. Is not the
rush here, as well as everywhere else, to be accounted for in this
way, viz., that there are some thousands of persons doomed to labour
hard for their subsistence six days per week, whose lungs require fresh

<pb id="p.17" n="17">
air, whose limbs exercise, whose whole system mental and bodily some
recreation and excitement ? But our rulers in their inscrutable
wisdom close the <q>People's Sunday School</q>* on the heights of
Sydenham-to the undisguised satisfaction of the proprietors of gin-
palaces and tea-gardens. There is joy at Highbury Barn, ovation in
the Grecian Saloon; great is the triumph at the Red House Battersea,
and the Gardens at Cremorne; Jack Straw's Castle fills well, and
the Publicans of Windmill Hill are in raptures.
</p><p> Meanwhile the Crystal Palace with its gates closed stands a monument
of National Righteousness. As at Rome the temple of Janus was shut
when the Republic was at peace, so we shut up the Temple of
Temperance and innocent pleasure, because we are suffering from a
periodical fit of piety. <q>We are a religious people </q>-a statement
which sounds remarkably well from the pulpit or the platform; but
which any one who like myself will look carefully at Sunday scenes
and Sunday amusements, may possibly forget.
</p><p>To all visitors to Gravesend on Sunday, there are all the means and
appliances for intoxication ready to hand. The band on the pier is
silent, but a tap is open at every tenth step. On Windmill Hill, and at
the foot, are eight public houses. On my approach to the hill, I was
invited to try the <soCalled> Real Havannahs.</soCalled> The first object which attracted
my attention was an enormous board, having on it in huge letters this
gratifying announcement:</p>
<p>STRONG GIN.</p>
<p>I was followed by several assiduous waiters, who vied with each other
in their hospitable invitations to the several small inns to which they
belonged, and in continually chaunting the praises of their <soCalled> fine old
Tom,</soCalled> <soCalled> best cream gin,</soCalled> ale and porter of the best qualities and the
cheapest prices. They also pressed me much to ascend their several
house-tops, and take a panoramic view of Gravesend and its suburbs,
by the aid of a telescope. These thoughtful, delicate, and disinterested
<NOTE place=foot>* A name given to the Crystal Palace by a speaker at a large meeting held in Drury Lane
Theatre, and received with a round of deafening cheers.</NOTE>
<pb id="p.18" n="18">
attentions on the part of the waiters, had their intended effect on the
majority of the excursionists, who flocked to the various hostelries
in question, and were, I suspect, obliged, for the good of the house,
to make use of the glasses below, the contents of which cheer and
inebriate, as a return for the use of those above which assisted in a
minute admiration of the surrounding landscape. I looked into several
of their <soCalled>Palaces,</soCalled> where the working-man enjoys such tempting
opportunities for disbursing his superfluous cash, and must confess
that the consumption of beer and spirits proceeded with a steady
rapidity which could not but have gratified the landlords.
</p><p> It next occurred to me, that as many steamboats, as full as the
one in which I had voyaged down, call at Gravesend on Sunday, it
would tax the capabilities of even these eight large public-houses to
accommodate all the tourists from town. The rest, methought, must be
at Rosherville, and to those far-famed gardens I therefore at once took
my way. The gardens lie in a large, irregularly-shaped marl pit, which
has been thus turned to very good account, and the grounds-a certain
cockney regularity in the attempts to imitate the irregularity and wild-
ness of nature notwithstanding-are tastefully and prettily laid out.
Here, as at Cremorne and Highbury Barn, each visitor pays sixpence
as the fee for entrance-but in this case there is no refreshment ticket.
You sink the whole sum for the sake of entering, without any equivalent
but that pleasure. After strolling among flower-beds, through undu-
lating walks adorned with some feeble attempts at ruined aqueducts
and arches, I found a number of persons congregated round a deep
tank with a pole in the centre, and with iron railings round it, in which
two large black bears were the objects of attraction. These monsters
stood erect on their hind legs, and caught in their mouths, with an
expertness which practice had rendered perfect, scraps of buns and
biscuits which were thrown to them. The children among the by-
standers were, of course, in great raptures. As the voracity of bruin
and his mate appeared to know no end, and was therefore growing
monotonous, I wandered on, passed the archery ground, and entered
a very imposing pile of architecture, called<soCalled> the Banquet Hall.</soCalled> Here
were a few persons dining at a table upon which various cold viands
were spread, one or two couple were dining in a hotter and heavier style
at separate tables; and at other tables shrimps were being swallowed
<pb id="p.19" n="19">
and washed down with hot weak tea. In this  <soCalled>gilded saloon </soCalled>(as
Mr. Disraeli would call it if he had to deliver an after-dinner agricul-
tural speech there) the nymphs of Gravesend and the neighbourhood,
with no less a man than Baron Nathan as high-priest of the mysteries,
do honour to Terpsichore on every evening except that of Sunday, on
which day, dancing being prohibited, the spacious building is solely
devoted to gluttony and intoxication. There appeared to be a strong
force of waiters, who had an air so independent, that one would suppose
them the joint-proprietors of the gardens, if one might judge from the
leisurely way in which they executed orders, the easy familiarity of
their manners, and the general jocularity of their demeanour. Having
fortified myself in the Banquet Hall with some dinner, which though
it might be unfair to call it <soCalled>cheap and nasty,</soCalled> was neither very
dear nor very clean, I walked on and explored the other parts of
the gardens. Following a direction given in one of Murray's Hand-
books, that to get a good view of any place you should at first ascend
an eminence, I climbed up to a height called the Tower, from which
there is a really very pretty view of the river, the country round, and
the gardens lying in the pit below. Just below me I saw a grand game
of romps, in which kissing was an interesting feature, going on between
some sailors and servant-maids, who were chasing each other in the
maze, and shrieking with laughter at their futile efforts to get out of it.
If the young ladies had regaled themselves with tea, the gallant
mariners had imbibed something more exhilarating; for they were a
trifle too noisy for tea-totallers, and ever and anon a few of the
favourite oaths which are familiar in the mouth of the British tar as
household words, might be heard loudly ejaculated. Behind the last
hedge of the maze are seated two gipsies, not any such invisible and
preternatural absurdities as the wondrous Thalaba of Cremorne, with
his deep diaphragmatic intonation, but the regular genuine home article
in the way of gipsies; two of exactly the same class, who with dark hair,
dark eyes, dirty brown complexion, old bonnets and ragged shawls, molest
us at Epsom, Henley, and Ascot; and inform all the <soCalled>pretty ladies</soCalled> 
in the carriages that they will enjoy patriarchal longevity. It was
time to be making my way back to the pier, and I therefore followed a
string of persons who seemed to be homeward bound. As the steamer
had been well nigh filled, there appeared to be a doubt whether
<pb id="p.20" n="20">
it could accommodate all the people on the pier-and there conse-
quently took place a vast deal of pushing and crushing, in which
jostling it is marvellous that some women and children were not killed,
though it is certain from their vociferous squalling that some of the
latter were frightened if not hurt. The opportunity was not thrown
away upon some of those very agreeable, though light-fingered gentle-
men, who belong to that famous and much-maligned fraternity-the
swell-mob. Though accustomed to look in at print-shops, and loiter
at book-stalls in London without having my pockets picked, I
suffered, upon this occasion, the loss of a silk handkerchief. A pretty-
looking girl, whom I recognised as one of the corps de ballet of a
theatre, was lamenting most piteously the loss of a new and expensive
parasol, which had a few minutes before been safe enough in her hands;
and her escort, a fast-looking Templar, was doing his utmost to console
her for her loss.
</p><p> The vessel had scarcely got off from the pier when it began to rain,
and a general scramble for both cabins took place. This rush tilted
the vessel, when, as a matter of course, some of the women screamed.
<q>There is nothing so easily frightened as a female,</q> observed a thick-
set snob with a cigar in his mouth, in a manner so contemplative, and
with an air so self-satisfied, that you would have supposed he imagined
the remark a profound generalisation. I went into both cabins-The
after one was very crowded, and tolerably decorous-The state of the
fore-cabin may be seen in the sketch prefixed. Unlike the gin-palace
in Barbican, where the self-acting organ manufactures sacred music for
the edification of the dram-drinkers-the musicians of the Sunday
Gravesend steamer treat their audience to the most popular comic and
sentimental airs. <q>Pop goes the weasel</q> was a favourite; some of the
rather pretty airs of Mr. Russell, and the  <q>Standard Bearer,</q> were
played very much out of time and tune, with a few polkas, waltzes
and galloppes; after which, the man who had lustily blown the
clarionet until he had quite blown himself, went round with the
hat. His first application for a pecuniary acknowledgment of his
musical efforts was to a fat, torpid-looking man, who was half drunk,
and very sleepy, and who, raising up his head from the table said
curtly, <q> Go to 'ell-I can't be civil to everybody.</q> This courteous
reply provoked no apparent indignation or disgust among the select
<pb id="p.21" n="21">
society in which I found myself; a great deal of laughter ensued, and
the discomfited musician moved on, but was scarcely more fortunate in
his next petition; for this was to a saturnine tract distributor, who,
instead of a penny or halfpenny, made a literary contribution in the
shape of a short lucubration with the attractive title of <q> Hell-Flames,
or the Sabbath Breaker's Doom.</q> I begged at once for a copy of
this theological treatise, and when I had perused it, entered into
conversation with the distributor. Our argument was long, and
perhaps on both sides very illogical. It might, perhaps, be thus
briefly analysed:-</p>
<p> <q> How come you here, on Sunday ?</q></p>
<p> <q> To distribute tracts.</q></p>
<p> <q> What do you think will become of these people who are drinking,
smoking, and swearing, all around us ?</q></p>
<p> <q>Unless they immediately repent, I have not a hope of their
salvation.</q></p>
<p> <q>How do you think they should spend Sunday ?</q></p>
<p><q> In church, chapel, family or private prayer and praise,</q></p>
<p><q> What, are they to have no fresh air or change of scene, or amuse-
ment on Sunday, when they are compelled to toil all the week ?</q></p>
<p> <q>All Sunday amusements are wicked and profane.</q></p>
<p> <q>You think that there is no such thing as innocent amusement on
Sundays ? </q>-</p>
<p><q> Certainly not.</q></p>
<p> I did all in my power to convince this earnest, but deluded man, that
rational and innocent amusement on Sunday was feasible, and that the
religious party to which he belonged was doing fearful mischief by
advocating views so gloomy and extreme as to leave all who did not go
three times to church or chapel on Sunday, to the temptations of
public-houses, tea-gardens, and steam-boats.</p>

<div1 type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<head>SUNDAY BEFORE GREENWICH FAIR.</head>
<p> FAIRS have their uses-in country places they afford the inhabitants
a little excitement for the year. It was the serious saying of a
celebrated physician that a mountebank visit to a village would
cure more sickness than a dozen doctors. So in that way Fairs have
their uses, although children do get very sick with too much toffy and
ginger-bread. Fairs in towns have the advantage of collecting all the
rascality and vagabondage into one focus. In this respect Greenwich
Fair is supereminent. The original uses have long passed away, and
the principal fun consists in pretending to tear shawls and coats with
a small circular instrument made for the purpose. To be sure
Greenwich Fair is an excuse for getting drunk, and that truly British
custom ought, in these degenerate lays, to be encouraged.
</p><p> The Fair legally commences on a Monday, but by favour of the
authorities, preparations are permitted on the previous Saturday, and
Sunday is devoted to a sort of undress rehearsal of the more prominent
features of the ensuing week.
</p><p> The shows are not open, but the booths for eating and drinking are,
and the result would astonish some of those good people who from the
recesses of their libraries, contemplate with horror, any other Sunday
amusement for a mechanic than a sermon and a cold dinner, and a view
of the chimney-pots.
</p><p> The pipe-and-pot performance, with the usual chaffing, maudlin, and
blaspheming accompaniments, form the back-ground of the picture in
<pb id="p.23" n="23">
every street, while active gesticulations and loud cries, call attention to
every sort of eatable, from oysters to ginger-bread nuts.
</p><p> We wonder what can be the impression of an intelligent foreigner,
who, having been told that Sunday is a strict day in England,
finds himself in Greenwich on the Sunday before the fair. There
is nothing in his own country like it. <q>Now gents,</q> roars
the ardent proprietor, <q>walk in-walk in,-admission free to the
Hungarian spring-rifle shooting gallery!</q> One penny, only one
penny a shot: and pop-pop goes the spring rifle most invitingly.
<q>Here's your real Baselona filberts-crack and try before you buy-
penny a half pint, and give yer a score for every bad un yer finds !</q>-
<q>Milky coker-nut-fine milky coker-nuts fresh for the Inges !</q> shrieks
a rival, at the same time a deep bass keeps steadily on with <q>Penny a
lot iseters - iseters! </q> The tenders of refreshin' drinks, and oranges
two a penny, are not less persevering, while there is no peace for the
passer-by who does not invest and keep in his hand by way of protec-
tion a bag of <soCalled>spice-nuts,</soCalled> the praises of which shrill female voices are
continually chaunting. Every Public house is full from bar to attic.
Touting tapboys and flashily-made-up TEA-SHOP girls * are active in
the streets as orderlies at a review. The street bears witness as
does the park, to the triumphs of the Publican interest.
</p><p>Well, we must say one thing for the <soCalled>"Religious Public;"</soCalled> there is no
medium about their proceedings, and the only Sunday amusements they
wink at are thoroughly disgusting. They reject Sydenham and
swallow Greenwich Fair without a sigh.
</p><p>Yet, even in the midst of these scenes of riot and low debauchery,
we need not travel far to learn how capable the working-classes
are of enjoying better things than pots and pipes and impromptu
slang.
</p><p> The buildings and grounds of Greenwich Hospital are open on a
Sunday to all comers; a charge of fourpence per head is made for
admission to the Painted Hall, where hang pictures of some of our
most celebrated naval battles, and portraits of our great sea captains.
The collection, almost lost in the bad light, is neither so good

nor so complete as it ought to be, and merits the interest which would
be conferred by a good catalogue with historical and biographical
notes. Nevertheless, it is crowded with humble people whose serious
and earnest demeanour, so different to that of the same individuals
when contaminated by the blackguardism of the Fair, shows the effect of
scenes which excite thought. It was pleasant to hear fathers explaining
the stories of victories to their children, and to note the tearful interest
with which the women looked on the coat in which Nelson was slain.
</p><p>The Painted Hall at Greenwich affords every Sunday sufficient
evidence of the advantage to be derived from a gallery, illustrating
Art and Science.</p></div1><pb id="p.25" n="25">
<div1 type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<head>TATTERSALL'S.</head>
<p> AT Hyde Park Corner, descending the narrow slip that flanks
St. George's Hospital, on the Grosvenor Place front, we reach the
greatest horse mart in the world, and the great Exchange-the Capel
Court-the " Bourse" of betting men. On every Sunday, from three
to six o'clock, a more or less numerous section of the sporting and
horse-loving fraternity, of all ranks from the peer to the brothel-keeper,
from the stock-jobber to the hell-keeper, lounge through the stables
where the horses to be sold on the following Monday are exhibited,
and at the same time select purchases, indulge in criticism or gossip,
or "catch a flat," or add a line to their betting-books. The sale of a
celebrated stud will fill the yard and the stables in the height of the
season, and bring down a crowd of wealthy and high-born to " Tatt's,"
before taking their appetising ride or drive in the Park. In these
reunions all professions are well represented-and both Houses of
Parliament, the Army and Navy, beside a large sprinkling of captains
whose titles rest on their spurs and mustachios--even the Church
contributes a certain number of <soCalled>outsiders,</soCalled> including a Dean !
</p><p>But the great, the certain day for seeing in perfection this one of
the few places of Sunday amusement open gratis, without let or
hindrance from new or musty Act of Parliament, to all Her Majesty's
subjects, is the Sunday before the Derby.
</p><p>On<date value="1853-05-22"> May 22, 1853</date>, it needed no guide or guide-book to direct the
passer-by the gates of Hyde Park the way to the <soCalled> Corner.</soCalled> A stream
pressed constantly down the archway, over which might so appro-
<pb id="p.26" n="26">
priately be written <foreign lang=la> Facilis descensus Averni,</foreign> an extra detachment of
red jacketed cads with horse-cloths on arm, stood ready to take charge
of the steeds of the groomless-small boys hovered about, offering
cigar-lights. Carriages, cabriolets, and street-cabs drove up continually,
and disgorged their contents.
</p><p>The narrow footway was crowded. On reaching the open space
leading to the sale yard and stables on the one hand, and to the
subscription rooms and ring on the other, I found the former crowded
-and what a crowd! I walked through the stables; it was like the
entrance to the pit of the opera on a favourite night. It seemed
wonderful that no one suffered from the heels of horses, indignant at
so much useless handling and ignorant criticism. There were many
idlers and amateur spectators like myself; but the words that reached
my ears, and the prevalence of memorandum books and lead pencils,
showed that this was rather a day of business than a day of pleasure.
Leaving the stables hot with the exertion of crushing through them,
I took my stand in a convenient position, with my back against a pillar
in the yard, and surveyed a fine panorama of one part of Sunday in
London. In my sketch I have neither exaggerated nor grouped for
effect. A tall, pale, aristocratic-looking man, with thin long fingers,
covered with rings, elaborately dressed, was a hell-keeper; a stumpy
man near him, with large reddish whiskers, the son of an earl; close
rubbing against him was a prize-fighter in conversation with a down-
cast looking bird, who bears a good character at the <soCalled>Corner,</soCalled> although
he has been tried more than once for swindling, at the Old Bailey.
</p><p>Every now and then there was a rush and ring formed of eager faces
closely crowding round two individuals making, or trying to make a
great bet. On these occasions familiarity was the order of the day,
and a groom, cad, or a cigar-shopkeeper, might be seen with his head
closely pressing the shoulder of a Right Honourable.
</p><p>Still in the midst of this eager excitement there was no noise or
confusion; the assembly was well-dressed, that is to say few were
seedy, although many were horsy, flashy, hairy, and much bedecked
with rich jewellery. The gentlemen sportsmen gave a sort of tone
to the place, but the more serious business was being carried on
in the subscription ring, from which the <foreign lang=la> oi polloi</foreign> were excluded.
Still from time to time amid such phrases as-<q>" Will any one back
<pb id="p.27" n="27">
Sittingbourne ? </q>-<q>" I want to lay against Rataplan! </q>-<q>" He's as good
as boiled:</q>-<q> All over but the shouting,</q>--there came a loud rude
dialogue like the following: <q>You're a pretty fellow to be showing
your nose here. When do you mean to pay me the money you owe
me on the Chester Cup, you d-d vagabond?</q> <q>I owe you nothing,
Mr. 0., and I beg you'll not make a blackguard of yourself,</q> responded
the defaulter, sneaking away. <q>Blackguard,</q> cried the honourable
creditor; <q>I'd pull your d-d nose for two-pence. Such fellows ought
to be kicked out of the yard.</q> Here a sober Mentor interposed, and
the defaulting <soCalled>flat-catcher</soCalled> disappeared.
</p><p>Leaving the stable-yard, I found a crowd pressing in and out of the
subscription rooms, and a couple of policemen keeping order before
the iron gates which shut out the mob from the exercise ground,
where under the shade of the trees, lounging on benches, a dozen
guardsmen and young peers were whiling an hour in sporting gossip,
surrounded by other subscribers of less aristocratic pretensions. The
business was dull. The winning of the favourite was considered a
dead certainty-groups were continually formed and broken up again
without the transaction of any real bet. Meanwhile with the step of an
ostrich, and the indifferent emotionless expression of a rhinoceros, the
<soCalled>Leviathan</soCalled>  of the ring stalked round and round, ready to lay the odds
against anything, with an equanimity that was almost sublime. Talk
of democracy, I have seen no levelling like Tattersall's yard, and no
sign of equality like the mode in which peers address and accept the
curt replies of this ci-devant journeyman carpenter.
</p><p> While part of these proceedings were going on, the Church bells
were ringing for evening service !</p></div1><pb id="p.28" n="28">
<div1 type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<head>CREMORNE GARDENS ON SUNDAY EVENING.</head>
<p> CREMORNE GARDENS (or <emph>Cre</emph>-morne, as the vulgar invariably pro-
nounce the word, with an emphasis on the first syllable which is quite
violent) present a busy and remarkable scene enough on any evening of
the week; but Sunday is <emph>the</emph> day to visit them, ye who on your
comfortable sofas doze after a heavy cold dinner over a colder and heavier
sermon. True it is that no balloon tempts on this day the admirers of
aeronautic daring-true also that the votaries of Terpsichore must
restrain their passion for the polka, and restrict their energies to a
somewhat solemn circular promenade round</p>
<p>The place where the <emph>band</emph> ought to <emph>blow</emph>.</p>
<p>Undeniable is it also that the steeds of the circus enjoy a Sabbatical
rest, and the strong-minded lady in the glittering tights, balanced
by a ponderous pole, will not this evening make her  <soCalled>terrific ascent</soCalled>
on the rope amid the hissing of squibs, the whizzing of rockets, and
the cheering of the multitude below, some twenty or thirty of whom
the aforesaid adventurous lady would infallibly kill if she and her
pole came down simultaneously among them.
</p><p>But, in spite of all this lack of excitement, the crowd is far denser,
and more heterogeneous, though not a whit more respectable, than on
any other day of the week. I am afraid to say, lest I should seem to
exaggerate, how many thousands of persons have visited this suburban
retreat on a fine Sunday, or how many hundreds of pounds the
<pb id="p.29" n="29">
proprietors have received in sixpences at the door, not to mention the
extra pence for staring at semi-nude Kaffirs, or diving into futurity by
the aid of the Chaldaean seer. From midday almost to midnight flow
in and out people of every age, rank, and condition. The earlier
visitors arrive in crowded steam-boats, the omnibuses carry their
proportion, and the later and more fashionable visitors dash up to the
entrance in Hansom cabs.
</p><p> Having voyaged up in a steamer perilously full, after having been
jostled almost to death, well-nigh poisoned by a <soCalled> boundless contiguity </soCalled>
of home-made cheroots, the ashes of which flew a good deal into my eyes,
as well as those of other people, I sprang out exultingly at the pier at
Battersea, gave up my three-penny ticket, and walked on to the Gardens.
Though not yet seven o'clock, I met a few persons already returning,
but their number bore no proportion to the throng before and behind
me about to enter, or to the multitude inside.
</p><p> The Gardens are prettily situated on the bank of the river, surrounded
by some fine trees, and, without any pretence to high art, nicely laid
out. At the entrance you find some iron railings, and a few gaudy
lamps. Within these is seated, in a small box, a vigilant janitor, who,
in return for the sixpence you deposit, supplies you with a  <soCalled><emph>refreshment</emph>
ticket,</soCalled> as it is ironically termed. By means of this cheque, which
will be honoured at sight, if your taste be tobacco, you may procure two
cigars of the most deleterious kind, or, if taps are your " vanity," a waiter
will bring you a glass of rum, whisky, or gin-and-water. Should your
weakness be brandy, a glass can only be procured by two of these
mysterious cards, or one and an additional sixpence. After receiving
the ticket at the entrance, it is examined by two other <foreign lang=la>portae custodes</foreign>
a few yards in advance, and you are then fairly launched into the
Gardens, the world of Cremorne all before you, and free to take your
choice.
</p><p> The marked contrast to the appearance of the Gardens on a week-
day is the first impression. No music-no dancing-no fireworks-no
poses plastiques-not at an early hour much larking, romping, noise or
laughter. Decorous hard-drinking is the order of the day, or rather of
the evening and night. For every two persons promenading fifty are
sitting round tables, in doors and out of doors, drinking. After
following the walk which leads to the circular promenade, I turned into
<pb id="p.30" n="30">
a spacious saloon used as a theatre, where, on week-days, dramatic
performances take place, and where the Hungarian band plays. It is
used also as a ball-room when rain or cold drives the dancers from the
promenade. On the left side, as you enter in a central position,
stands, with imposing aspect, the tap. Behind the bar several  <soCalled>young
persons </soCalled>of not unprepossessing exterior are handing over to the
waiters glasses of hot and cold spirits and water, small and large
bottles of ale and porter, an occasional glass of punch or sherry-cobler,
and a still more occasional cup of tea. Charged with the freight of
these precious and wholesome beverages, the waiters rush with furious
but safe rapidity to every corner of the gardens. In this room are
fifty or sixty tables, round which are clustered people of every age,
and of both sexes, in parties varying in numbers from twelve or
fourteen to three or four. In this saloon are assembled the noisiest
and least respectable of the <emph>Cre</emph>morne visitors. The tradesman or
artisan who frequents these gardens, and brings his wife and children
to them because the grounds are spacious and pretty and the air fresh,
has nevertheless a well-grounded suspicion that it is not the most
respectable place in the world, nor the company which frequents it the
most select. He therefore drinks outside, at a table under the trees,
in the mixture of twilight and gaslight, and avoids the glare of this
spacious saloon, where sailors, soldiers, second-rate women of the town,
and the noisier class of cheroot-smoking gents carry on contests of
<soCalled>chaff,</soCalled> in which the style is more forcible than elegant. On the
tables I observed that the proportion was about twenty glasses of ale,
or alcohol, to one cup of tea. The herb, which is said to cheer but
not inebriate, is quite at a discount in the saloon. Passing out through
the door which faces the bar, I took a turn on the circular promenade,
where a few couples of young ladies and gentlemen were indulging in
rather solemn and decorous peripatetics. I next crossed and entered
the hotel. The first and strongest impression here was-<emph>drink</emph>. At an
extensive bar stand numbers of very fast-looking men, and still faster
looking young ladies, all drinking. Here intoxication takes a loftier
flight, and brandy is the favourite beverage. I walked into the
adjoining large room with the bow-window. Here I met young Snaggs,
with whom I have a bowing acquaintance. On this occasion he
condescended to shake hands, being evidently under an impression
<pb id="p.31" n="31">
that as he met me at Cremorne I was growing fast, and therefore
worthy of his patronage and regard. Snaggs is a very fat, overgrown,
over-dressed, vulgar-looking, well-meaning young man, who, if his
pranks and proceedings are not swiftly discovered by his relatives, will
go with certain celerity to the dogs. I am told that he is to be
found every Sunday evening at Cremorne, accompanied by a stout
middle-aged woman with girlish bonnet and heavy jewellery. She is
not Snaggs's sister, and does not behave like his wife. I wonder who
she can be ? On Sundays this silly youth is to be seen driving with
her in a Brougham in the park, and from thence he orders his
coachman to take him to Cremorne, where he dines elaborately,
swaggers a good deal, and pays seven shillings a bottle for port.
Snaggs's allowance from his father, who is a respectable banker in a
country town, is three hundred a year; but, by the help of bill-
discounting attorneys, and a very large acquaintance with usurious
Hebrews in Gray's Inn, Clifford's Inn, Lyon's Inn, Staple's Inn, not
to mention even more obscure, dishonest, and exorbitant money-
lenders in small streets and dirty courts and alleys, he has lived at
the rate of a thousand per annum for two years, and his excellent
reversionary prospects are, of course, not at all injured to support his
present vicious and vulgar prosperity. He is intended by his confiding
parent to practise as a solicitor. At present his prospects of passing
are, to say the least of them, remote. He may soon be compelled to
peruse Byles on Bills with some painstaking. As yet he has not
read even that light and popular work. So much for Snaggs. He is
a fair type of the aristocratic and fast Sunday habitues of Cremorne.
</p><p> I hurried away from this promising young man and sat down
at a table in the corner of the room, and as if waiting for some one,
watched with vigilance what was going on around me. At the
adjoining table a very respectable and gentlemanly-looking foreigner
with two ladies, one of whom from her likeness to him, must have been
his sister, and a little girl, with soft blue eyes, and luxuriant ringlets,
were drinking coffee. These gardens are very much frequented on
every day of the week by French and Germans, who guided by their
own national tastes and habits, bring their children with them, and do
not comprehend into what a close proximity with vice and vulgarity
they are driven by their love of public amusement. I trust that on
<pb id="p.32" n="32">
the occasion to which I allude, the child of the party was too unskilled
in our tongue to appreciate some of the choice facetiae which were
giving rise to very boisterous mirth at the opposite table. Here were
seated four young ladies attired in silks and satins, with bonnets half
off their heads, bad bracelets and cheap rings innumerable, who
occasionally helped themselves from two decanters on the table, to
port and sherry, and were asking two fast men conundrums, which had
I estimated their wit by the amount of laughter they produced, I should
have ranked very high as humorous efforts-but which I unfortunately
heard, and certainly cannot repeat. Having no very decided taste for
this sort of thing, I rose, and passing by some more tables, at one
of which sat a barrister and ex-M.P. with young ladies of the ballet,
sucking sherry cobler with straws most industriously, quickly made
my exit.
</p><p>I now strolled over every part of the Gardens-and stronger
than ever grew my impression that the genius loci was DRINK. Tea-
spoons full of gin-and-water administered to children by indulgent
parents seemed quite to have exhilarated the juveniles. Flirtations
were growing more tender and affectionate. A disposition to run about
and romp was exhibiting itself; and kissing was becoming a popular
pastime.
</p><p>In all the sequestered nooks and corners, with seats
<q>For talking age and whispering lovers made,</q>
I watched carefully the character of the liquids which were being
consumed.</p>
<p>They were somewhat in this proportion:-</p>
<list>
<item>No. I. Glasses of Spirits and Water.</item>
<ITEM>II. Bottles of Beer.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Spirits.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. Beer.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. Sherry Cobler.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. Spirits.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. Tea and Shrimps.</ITEM>
</list>
<p>And then ale and alcohol in constant alternation until I reached
No. XIX. or XX., when tea and shrimps were once more to be seen.</p>
<pb id="p.33" n="33">
<p> Passing down the centre walk,-where on one side, on all except
Sunday evenings, cockney sportsmen shoot at diminutive pasteboard
hares and rabbits-passing the bowling alley, also on Sunday closed,
I strolled to the other gate, with the intention of making a speedy exit,
when my eye was attracted by the scene depicted in the sketch of the
entrance to the mystic shrine of the Chaldaean astrologer-the wondrous
Thalaba. Lothario Higg is the gentleman or gent, who is inducing
Miss Susan Smith to enter with him, and strive to penetrate the gloom
of destiny. He invites her with supernatural solemnity, and she
timidly assents. I felt that it would be quite useless to quote
to Higg-</p>
<p><foreign lang=fr> Tu ne quaesieris, scire nefas, quem mihi, quem tibi
Finem Di dederint, Leuconoe, nec Babylonios
Tentaris numeros.</foreign></p>
<p>-so merely muttered the lines to myself, and entered with Lothario and
Susan. In each case some three or four couplets of infamous doggrel
informed the expectant querist that he or she would suffer some slight
calamity, over which he or she would triumph, that a letter full of good
news would at some time or other be received, that matrimony would
soon ensue-and fecundity and longevity were always prominent
predictions. Higg who was apparently a wag, insisted on reading
aloud the answer vouchsafed to the blushing maid. It ran almost
as follows:-</p>
<p> <q>A letter ten days hence, will bring you joy,
Marriage will follow-twins-a girl and boy,
A widow soon <emph>you'll</emph> be-but quick you'll find
Another husband much more to your mind-
Ten children then <emph>you'll</emph> have-who all will do
Well-and <emph>you'll</emph> live until you're eighty-two.</q></p>
<p> Poor Susan looked at Lothario, whom she had never met before that
evening, with prescient pity for his premature fate.</p>
<p> On coming out I encountered Policeman P slowly perambulating the
Garden in a pensive manner. <q>Is this Wizard's Cave always open on
Sunday?</q> I said.
</p><p> <q> Yes, sir.</q>
</p><p> <q> And on every day of the week ?</q>
<pb id="p.34" n="34">
</p><p>
<q> Yes, sir.</q>
</p><p><q> And it has always been here ?</q>
</p><p><q>I've only been on duty here last season and this; but I've heerd
it's always bin here.</q>
</p><p><q>Have you ever been on duty in the country ?</q> I asked.
</p><p><q>Never in the force, sir; but I was a constable in Berks for some
years.</q>
</p><p><q> And you've taken up gipsies for telling fortunes, have you not ?</q>
</p><p><q>Often, sir.</q>
</p><p><q>Thank you,</q> I replied, and feeling that I had no right to indoctrinate
a policeman with discontent, even at such palpable inconsistency and
injustice as this, I made my way for the gate at which I had originally
entered. I here discovered that in the course of another hour
omnibuses would be starting from the door to London. I determined
to wait, from a preference to this mode of conveyance, over the crush
and crowd of the steam-boat with the chance of being drowned in the
dark. I was not perhaps altogether uninfluenced by the remark of
the veteran whip, who once observed that <q>if you are thrown off and
killed, why there you are-but if you're blown up, where are you ?</q>
There certainly is a terrific vagueness about the latter alternative.
</p><p>I now strolled through the two saloons again-lounged on the
promenade-and walked round the Garden-alcohol was even more in
the ascendant-tea and shrimps were no longer to be seen. The
chaffing grew louder-and sometimes more indecent-the romping
more boisterous-and in the quieter nooks and walks there was audible
kissing-I recognised my friends Mr. Higg and Miss Smith-Lothario
was rapidly insinuating himself into the affections of the silly young
girl. He had one arm round her waist, his other hand held a tumbler
of spirits and water, from which she occasionally took a sip-and the
poor girl giggled and looked as happy as if she had really secured
a constant and virtuous lover, who would some fine morning take
her from the slavery of the needle to church, and thence to a
comfortable home.
</p><p>It was now time to secure my seat in the omnibus-and accordingly
I hurried to the door, and, as the night was fine, seated myself outside,
and next to the driver. He was an intelligent, amusing fellow-and
more communicative than these charioteers usually are. During the
<pb id="p.35" n="35">
ten or twelve minutes which we waited for the omnibus to fill, I
ventured an observation on the appearance of his horses, which elicited
the following remarks-<q> Oh, these ere 'osses aint much o' cattle-the
gray mare wont last much longer-and this 'ere bay's wery old-but
he's been a good 'un in his day-and though he can't move a bit now
coz' he's wery stiff at starting, when he gets warm he goes like a
squirrel.-But they aint nothing so bad as the pair I druv this day
week. I druv them four and twenty mile right off without taking 'em
out o' 'arness-three stages, eight mile a piece-with 'eavy Sunday
loads-and, God bless my soul, if the proprietor wer'n't a complaining
next mornun of the appearance of the 'osses. Talk o' cruelty to
hanimals arter that-and I started to work at a quarter past eight in
the mornun, and kep at it without time to get a proper meal of wittals
till one in the mornun.</q>
</p><p>I could not avoid a reflection at the time, which recurs to me very
forcibly again-that the Pietists who pray against excursion trains, and
think a walk anywhere but in their own garden on Sunday a crime,
forget, in their narrow and blind sectarianism, that there are in this
country some hundreds of thousands whose weekly labours preclude
recreation or visiting on the week-day-and whose health and social
nature demand amusement and locomotion. Should these enthusiasts
ever condescend to reason on the subject, it may occur to them that
excursion trains which carry vast numbers at but little cost of human
labour, are preferable to omnibuses which convey but a few by over-
driving horses-and over-working drivers.
</p><p><foreign lang=la>Ecce iterum Crispinus !</foreign> Here's Higg again. I thought I was
destined to never get rid of this man. He was by this time decidedly
exhilarated-and the unfortunate Susan was (I am afraid I must out
with the truth) tipsy. She had hold of Lothario's arm, was hanging
her head on one side in a sleepy and helpless manner, and clamorously
petitioning to go inside. This was not Higg's idea of a lark-and
so, with the aid of the conductor, and a gent on the top, she was raised
to the <soCalled>knife board,</soCalled> where Higg seated himself by her side-and put
his arm round her waist. Her appearance, as she laid her head
on the shoulder of this vulgar brute, and fell fast asleep, I shall
never forget. The girl when I first saw her in the gardens looked
modest and respectable, and the rapid effect the spirits had
<pb id="p.36" n="36">
produced on her, only proved that she was unaccustomed to the
consumption of such poison.
</p><p>The scene excited the honest indignation of my friend Jehu. <q>That
feller aint none o' the best sort,</q> said he, somewhat audibly. <q> He
keeps a small betting-office near Leicester Square. He's down reg'lar
every Sunday night; and I never seed him with the same gal twice.
That young 'un as he's got hold of wont come to much good.
Mark my word.</q>
</p><p>By this time, the four young ladies who had previously displayed
such a knowledge of that portion of the lighter literature of Holy-
well Street which consists of indelicate conundrums, made their
appearance with two fast men, all in a state of jovial and boisterous
semi-intoxication. One of the men suggested that they should all go
in a cab. But Thais, Chloe, Lalage, and Lydia, as I will christen
them (the surnames on their cards probably showing their connection
with the houses of De Vere, Somerville, Gordon, and Montague),
expressed in no measured terms their resolve to go on the  <soCalled>buss,</soCalled> and
nowhere else. They were accordingly lifted up with great difficulty;
and as the omnibus was now crowded to discomfort inside and danger
outside, we started. The scene that ensued no pen or pencil could
describe. They sang songs with a loud chorus; screeched out jests
which were a mixture of blasphemy and obscenity; insulted every
pedestrian on the pavement with indecent jokes or questions. We
stopped at several public-houses. At each beer and brandy-and-
water was handed to the top of the omnibus, copiously consumed by
the young ladies, and liberally paid for by the gents. The Cremorne
omnibuses must be a nuisance and a curse to the people of Chelsea, if
I may judge of the usual style of proceeding on the part of outside
passengers from that Sunday night's entertainments.
</p><p>The shrieking, shouting, swearing and singing, were kept up with
great spirit during the whole trip; and when, infinitely disgusted and
wearied, I got off the vehicle at the top of the Haymarket, the two gents
descended, and in their company the four vestals to whom I have before
alluded arranged their rustling silks before leaving, and floated with airy
grace into divers oyster-shops and supper-rooms, where <emph>every</emph> night,<emph> in
a Christian country</emph> (as they say in Exeter Hall), are held Bacchanalian
orgies which would have done credit to Rome under the empire, and
<pb id="p.37" n="37">
which burlesque the blackguardism of the reigns of Charles II. or
George IV.</p>
<p>As I walked home it occurred to me, not for the first or the last
time, but very forcibly, that it might be possible to afford to the inha-
bitants of our metropolis some opportunity of stretching their limbs,
refreshing their eyes, and regaling mind and body, by innocent gratifi-
cation on Sunday afternoon, without necessarily exposing the virtuous
and the respectable to scenes of debauchery and degradation.</p></div1><pb id="p.38" n="38">
<div1 type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<head>THE NEW CUT, LAMBETH</head>
<p> BETWEEN the Westminster Road, as marked by Astley's Theatre, on
the one side, and the Waterloo Road, marked by the Victoria, lies
the region of the New Cut, Lambeth, in the heart of a colony of
costermongers, roughs, thieves, with here and there a manufactory.
The shops there are all carved out in the primitive style, with open
fronts and bawling-touters, which appears to those who have never seen
it, so picturesque and pleasing in the description of the two London
apprentices in Scott's <q>Fortunes of Nigel.</q> Once all the retail trade
of London was carried on in the same way. The custom still lingers
in the neighbourhood of Leicester Square, although the alley that
gave it scope by its narrowness has been enlarged into a street. But in
Lambeth the <soCalled>chaffing</soCalled> style of trade flourishes every day, but
in thorough perfection on Saturday night and Sunday morning.
</p><p> The street corners of Lower Marsh, which leads to the New Cut,
occur just after passing the South Western Railway arch, and are
flanked by two of the most gorgeous and gigantic gin shops in London,
which are always crowded with a lively multitude on Sunday evening.
On Sunday morning the gin shops are closed, and form the supports and
centres of attraction of a crowd of natives, among whom the kiddy
swell, in glaring neck-tie, flash shooting jacket, greasy hair, with
a knowing curl on each cheek, slouched cap, soft hands guilt-
less of work, and pump-clad feet, is the chief ornament as he
lounges patronizing his admiring friends among the hard-workers of
both sexes.</p>
<pb id="p.39" n="39">
<p> With nothing worth losing in your pocket, you may venture down the
New Cut on a Sunday morning. Police discipline has reduced the
savages to a very decent state. Insult is rare, and injury from the
sober unknown. Supposing that you have arrived from some decent part
of the town, say Russell Square, or one of the quiet squares round
Pentonville, and could be conveyed with eyes closed, and ears stopped,
to the entrance of the New Cut, on recovering the use of your faculties
you would imagine that you had arrived in Bedlam, a vast crowd con-
sisting chiefly of the poorest class of labourers' wives making their
market. The better-minded employers pay their men on Friday or on
Saturday at four o'clock. The latter is the plan adopted by Messrs.
Maudsley and Field, the great engineers. Workmen under such
masters can send their wives to market to the best advantage; but
other employers, especially among small builders, pay late on Saturday
night, and pay at public-houses. Sometimes the master and sometimes
the foreman has an interest in the public-house. In any it is difficult
for a workman, once in, to get out without drinking something.
</p><p> The late drinkers are the Sunday marketers. The shopkeeping
style is suited to the class addressed. The reverential obsequiousness
or airy flutter of the west-end would not do here. The Sunday
morning market combines both business and pleasure-it is a comic
performance in which spectators take a part, and perhaps for rude
ready wit, there is nothing like it out of the land. There is a
great demand for farthings in the New Cut. The profits are small
and the returns are quick. The quality of the articles moderate--the
variety wonderful.
</p><p> At the same moment you hear each at the top of his voice, one
calling-<q> Here's young greens, gereens-jolly greens, best in Lambeth,
all for a half-penny.</q> Another, <q> Best blacking, three cakes a-penny;</q>
a third, <q> Good strong braces ;</q> while butchers in dozens, all red, blue,
and greasy, flop about their bargains, and compete with each other on
the plan of a Dutch auction, and address every woman in the most
endearing terms. <q> Mackerell<q> and <q><emph>rubub</emph>,</q> <q>iseters</q> and <q>cubars,</q>
<q>turmots</q> and </q>piatees,</q> resound amid bits of ballads, fierce and
funny slang, but no fighting. The policeman, awful in his unseen
power, parades from the vantage ground of the church-steps, which
no one cares to dispute with him, and marks as they pass, with a view
<pb id="p.40" n="40">
to prospective identification, the numerous candidates for his future
services.</p>
<p> We must not forget the beggars; in spite of the poverty, or rather
improvidence of the mob, beggars in one shape or another, pick up a
fair living from the tender-heartedness of women.
</p><p>The condition of the Sunday market in the New Cut is a disgrace to
civilized London; but merely to try to put it down would be useless.
Something better must be substituted.
</p><p>It would be worth while to try a covered market about the same
spot.
</p><p> It is remarkable, and not creditable to the Radicals of Lambeth, that
while so furious in reforming every quarter of the globe, and denouncing
the iniquities of every party sect and society out of their own pale, they
have the dirtiest and most neglected parish in England. They have
done nothing for baths, wash-houses, or popular education. They
permit the existence of slums, breeding death and disease, and have
not even the proper spirit to set a good example to the contrasts of the
contented cant party. Gardens and Parks, and Crystal Palaces, will do
no good to those who dwell in dens unwashed, unkempt, untaught.
Lambeth, with its blind alleys and filthy streets, its Radical bone
boilers, and parish orators, is just one of the extremes that meet the
results in the same view as the cant of its contented neighbour-
Clapham.</p></div1><pb id="p.41" n="41">

<head>CHAPTER IX.<head>
<head>STAR AND GARTER, RICHMOND.</head>
<p><q>Oh, Mrs. Fry, why go to Newgate,
Why not go to Carlton Palace, why ?</q></p>
<p> So says and sings a poet who, not a famous moralist, now and then
stumbled on a startling truth that, changing names, will apply as well
now as when he wrote.</p>
<p> We, too, ask why the Religious Public who join the Anti-Sunday
Relaxation onslaught, don't go at once to the top of the tree,
<q> And make a dash against the rich,
Before they touch the poor.</q></p>
<p>They should remember that all great moral reforms have begun with
the wealthier classes. When gentlemen wore swords and used them,
and little rapier matches after the theatre were as common as slanging
matches are now after the breaking up of the Coal Hole, then the
working order did little murders on their own account on slight
provocation. Robbery on a large scale was considered rather spirited
than otherwise-gentlemen of good family, if hard up, took to the road,
and if found out were sometimes tried and hung, and oftener pitied and
sent on a visit to relations in the Plantations-Westminster in those
days gloried in a cock-pit, where mains were fought, and dogs and
bears, and every living quadruped that would fight, did fight. Then
gentlemen and statesmen of European reputation were not ashamed to
tumble under the table of a tavern drunk, and to spend nights and
<pb id="p.42" n="42">
days gambling in the clubs of St. James's. Such conduct was thought
foolish, but no one thought it ungenteel. Then, too, on a close division,
taverns and places of even more questionable resort were swept for
votes by the whippers-in. Jack was as good, or rather as bad, as his
master, and coachmen and footmen drank, swore, and gamed <soCalled>like
lords.</soCalled>
</p><p>Well, those days have past, and although Arcadia has not arrived, or
the Millennium,-although there is a per-centage of vice going on in all
ranks, decency in the higher orders is the order of the day. We have
only one Judge who sets decorum at defiance. Ministers of State, if
they have vices, are not permitted to offend their inferiors with the
contamination of public bad example. The result of the change in
improvement in the character, tastes, and pursuits of our aristocracy, is
to be seen reflected on every class of society, from the mechanic
upwards. It is only in Glasgow and a few other parts of Scotland,
that drunkenness is considered consistent with eminently pious
pretensions.
</p><p>If Sunday excursion trains are to be put down, vans stopped,
omnibus horses to have rest, cab drivers the benefit of leisure without a
strike, and steamers to be still on Sundays, what shall we say to
Richmond and that acme of English hotel scenery, the Star and Garter.
Stop the railway, the steamboat, and the omnibus, and the gardens and
the dining-rooms of the Star and Garter will still be crowded. A famous
cook, brilliant parterres, pleasant views of fine woodland scenery, the
silver Thames and royal houses in the distance, these attract a well-
dressed crowd who are not to be denied by any common obstacles.
Sunday is the great day of liberty for theatrical artists of all classes.
The opera and the ballet, the tragedy and the poses plastiques, the
man that swallows his own backbone, and the lady who ascends the
tight-rope in the midst of fireworks, all like a drive to Richmond, to
Hampton Court, or to Greenwich. They like a sniff of fresh air on
Sundays to mix with the gas and sawdust of the week. Their admirers
are of the same mind, so down come four-in-hand drags, quiet
Broughams, cabriolets, with gigantic horses and minute tigers-landaus
and barouches, beside disguised flys and undisguised Hansoms. You may
see them without venturing within what our pious friend All-Saints
Pankey calls that den of iniquity-Pankey who keeps a small Star-and-
<pb id="p.43" n="43">
Garter establishment in his own kitchen, besides having the run of all
the best City tables. The chariots of the wicked, to speak figuratively,
are ranged in large rows outside the hotel, for coach-house room there
is none. As dinner-hour approaches, the horses of fresh vehicles
dash up more vigorously, and parties who have been strolling through
the delicious Park, or seeking an appetite on the Terrace, enliven the
portals. There is Lord Marrowfat, an ancient, but not venerable peer,
tottering between two pets of the ballet, and close following him is
Tom Slum, with a perfect garden of flowers in the bonnet of the lady
on his arm. Slum is a jobber, and having made a good hit last week,
is <q>coming it rather the cheese,</q> to use his own expression. A group
of foreigners, who have been intensely disgusted with a week of London
sights, are enjoying the fresh and the fashionable bustle and the idea
of a civilised dinner, little thinking of the bill that awaits them. The
waiters, black-coated and white neckclothed, receive the successive
guests with an air of profound devotion, worthy of curates visiting
a bishop, while, on the outside, grooms, hostlers, and strappers,
hiss and swear with energy befitting the day and the place. All
is bustle, luxury, extravagance. Nothing loud, nothing disgusting,
nothing to irritate the finest nerves, unless it be the cigars and the
slang of the return drags. Well, these things exist in spite of Act of
Parliament, in some shape or other, and certainly the wine of the Star
and Garter is more humanising than the serious drinking of the back
parlours of Glasgow, and often as innocent as the dinner-tables of holy
Clapham.
</p><p>But if there is to be a general pulling down of Sunday amusements,
we suggest that the Society which holds its meetings in a particularly
musty room in Salisbury Square should commence its operations with
the visitors of the Star and Garter and the Castle, Richmond, and the
Trafalgar, and such like hotels, Greenwich.</p></div1><pb id="p.44" n="44">

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<head>HUNGERFORD PIER DURING THE HOURS OF DIVINE SERVICE.</head>
<p> SUPPOSE, if it is not impious to do so, dear reader, we turn out of the
Strand for a few minutes, on any fine Sunday, pass through Hungerford
Market, walk nearly half across the Suspension Bridge, and descend to
the pier. Could reverend gentlemen, who write against the opening
of the Crystal Palace, accompany us they would, I fear, in the
Market itself recognise some of the wandering sheep of their flocks.
Here, in the teeth of bills against Sunday trading, a good deal of
commerce of a small kind is going on. The refuse of fruit not sold on
Saturday in Covent Garden is vended here at reduced prices. On all
sides are small heaps of hot and sweating gooseberries, red and
white currants which begin to look dusty and dry, stunted pears
and unripe apples in abundance-almond-nuts in baskets, with three-
cornered pieces of cocoa-nut once white and fresh, but now stale and
dirty. These, and penny ices, which are very popular on hot days,
lure the coppers out of the pockets of servant-maids and apprentice-
boys; and the traffic creates such a stir and a bustle, that with difficulty
we should elbow our way through the pleasure-seeking crowd journeying
to or from the steamboats. But supposing us to have arrived at the
pier, what a scene presents itself! Compared with the noise of the
market this is Chaos itself, with a dash of Babel in it. <q>Confusion
worse confounded</q> assuredly it is. Four or five steamers are lying close
to the pier, puffing and steaming in a most agitated way-across their
decks crowds of (what the Rev. Onesimus Bang would call) <soCalled>sabbath-
breakers</soCalled> are passing to and fro. Small boys are shouting, children
<pb id="p.45" n="45">
crying lustily, <soCalled>gents</soCalled> chaffing. In several small sentry-boxes the
money-takers receive sixpences and threepences, for which they give
small pieces of paper, which you are especially requested to present
open, but which a jocular friend of mine always folds with much care
and industry into the shape of a cocked hat, to the disgust of the
official. The aforesaid humourist has been known to ask the man from
whom he received it, <q>whether the ticket includes refreshment.</q> This
if done when there is a great crush, and the boat is on the point of
starting and leaving a great number on the pier, is calculated to
infuriate the ticket-giver to an indescribable degree, while the by-
standers, who are delayed by the joke in question, are very slow to see
its point. The pushing, squeezing, and crushing is such, that it is
more than a miracle that all the corpulent people in the crowd are not
reduced to a jelly, or at least flattened to a pancake. The children are
so numerous and so noisy, that one sighs for the days of Herod. Not
that there appears to be any necessity for a massacre of the innocents,
for by their cries and sobs they are being speedily suffocated.
</p><p>In this heterogeneous crowd gentism and snobbism are triumphant.
Such a mixture of every variety of bad tobacco never at once, before or
since, offended my nostrils. The light banter which is carried on
savours frequently of personality, and is rendered more piquant by
a little indelicacy, and a more than occasional oath. As I stood
there one day, a gent near me deliberately puffed a large mouthful of
smoke from an infamously bad cheroot into the ears and eyes of
a man standing near him who was almost old enough to be his grand-
father.
</p><p><q>I'll thenk you to keep yer d--d cabbage smoke out o' my eyes,
young feller,</q> observed the old man.
</p><p> <q>Didn't burn yer whiskers though, did I ?</q>  was the retort, which,
inasmuch as the old man had no whiskers, elicited a chorus of laughter
from a small knot of fraternal snobs, who evidently regarded this as a
triumphant sally from the wit of their set. After successfully insulting
the old man, the wag was so encouraged by the applause of his com-
rades, that he began to look around him for fresh victims.
</p><p><q>Hope you don't find my cigar disagreeable,</q> he observed, as he
pushed himself rather nearer to me, and was evidently singling me out
for some fun.
<pb id="p.46" n="46">
</p><p><q>It's very cheap, bad tobacco; but I dare say you'd smell as unplea-
santly without it,</q> I replied, quietly, looking with expressive disgust on
his lank, greasy hair, and shining whiskers.
</p><p>He muttered an oath, and slunk off, rather discomfited; but soon, I
observed, rallied his spirits, and was pinching some servant maids, who
giggled, and thought him very funny. I soon, however, lost sight of
him altogether; for, upon the arrival of the iron steamboat, <emph>Citizen</emph>,
amid cries of <q>Westminster Bridge, Battersee, Chelsee, <emph>Cre</emph>morne !</q>
this accomplished young gentleman and his set got on board, with a
manifest intention of making a day, and perhaps a night of it, at the
Red House, or the Gardens.
</p><p>Though numbers got into this and other boats, the crowd on the pier
never appeared to diminish, as there was a constant influx from the
street. Some were bound for Greenwich and Woolwich; others were
going up the river as far as Kew. The Red House was tolerably
popular; but the majority were, I think, votaries of Cremorne. The
blundering and bungling about the boats was endless. One unfor-
tunate man, who wanted to cross the river, and spend his afternoon in
the vicinity of holy Clapham, made several unsuccessful attempts to
start. At first he got on board the <emph>Dahlia</emph>; on inquiry, he left
this steamer, and returned to the pier. He allowed two Chelsea
boats to pass, and then boarded the Pink; whereupon he was
informed by one of the officials on the pier, in a voice of thunder,
that <q>No flowers goes to <emph>Nine-helms</emph>.</q> What ultimately became of
the unfortunate man, I know not; for the crowd became denser and
noisier.
</p><p><q>Keep yer hands in yer pockuts; here's a nobleman ere as has lost
his ticker</q>! shouted a facetious small boy; and every one crushed to
that direction to see what sort of looking creature the peer in question
was, and with what feelings he endured his loss. As the whole thing
however, was an invention of the imaginative youth, the pardonable
curiosity of the populace was not satisfied; and the press in one
direction only gave rise to a good deal of screaming among the women,
and swearing among the men, who were by it nearly pushed into the
water.
</p><p>There seemed to be no hope of the crowd clearing away. Like the
rustic of old, I waited to see if the stream would cease; but, like Old
<pb id="p.47" n="47">
Father Thames at our feet, the river of human beings poured into the
pier, and from off it very regularly-and as</p>
<p><foreign lang=la><q>Labitur et labetur</q></foreign></p>
<p>seemed the order of the day, I walked back to the Strand, wondering
whether the reverend gentlemen I have before spoken of, when they
preach sermons and write pamphlets against the opening of the Crystal
Palace on Sunday, know the condition of Hungerford pier during the
hours of Divine Service.</p></div1><pb id="p.48" n="48">

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<p> GIN AND SACRED MUSIC.</p>
<p>I HAVE always been a great wanderer in London and its suburbs,
and I have never confined my perambulations. to the fashionable West.
Indeed, I never could precisely appreciate the humour of the question
of the Right Hon. Nicholas Rigby, when he asked, in the House of
Commons, <q>Where <emph>is</emph> Bedford Square?</q> Very <emph>small</emph> jokes elicit
laughter-or <q> roars of laughter in which the worthy speaker joined,</q>
as the reporters say, in the great Senate of England; which fact may
account for the success of the interrogatory sally just mentioned.
Theodore Hook has done his utmost also, to make dinners and tea
parties in Bloomsbury appear ludicrous, if not presumptuous; and with
sundry magazine writers of the present day, it seems to be thought
jocose to say that any one (whom the writer wishes especially to
ridicule) lives in Guilford or Keppel Street, Russell Square. All this
jocularity and sarcasm notwithstanding, I have always had a profound
respect for the City. Though the course of fashion, like that of empire,
takes its way Westward, yet in ancient days wisdom came from the
East, and if we cannot still get myrrh and frankincense, we shall
certainly find gold there.
</p><p>I am very partial to a stroll in the City- either at night or on
Sunday. There is scarcely a finer sight in Europe than the City by
moonlight. Cross London Bridge, and see the pale Thames glittering
like floating quicksilver under the lunar rays, and looking calmly
unconscious of the infinite traffic and gigantic commerce which the
venerable river-god bears on his ample shoulders. See the quaint old
<pb id="p.49" n="49">
Tower with its varied historical associations, the wharfs before so
stirring with commercial activity now all so tranquil, and above all the
tapering church spires pointing up so speakingly to the sky. Pass
on through streets now so cold and calm, a few hours ago crowded by
hurried passengers so full of hope, anxiety, expectancy, and excitement.
All the public buildings which, in the stir and the bustle of the day, one
has no leisure to look at, stand out in bold relief, pale and symmetrical,
their outlines mellowed down by the soft moonlight. And on Sunday,
too, the streets of the City present a contrast to their normal week-day
condition which is very striking. In the churches there is no very
great difference. They are closed and empty during the week. They
are open and empty on Sunday. But in spite of the neglect of the
established sanctuaries manifested by the denizens of the City,
the natural gloom and seriousness inherent in the English character,
prompts sundry irregular theological and devotional outbreaks. Hence,
assemble on Sunday afternoons and evenings in the Smithfield-market
(of all places in the world) a crowd of persons with a taste, if not a
talent, for religious controversy. I have frequently stopped, and listened
to the discussions which were being carried on. Eight or ten small
knots of persons may be seen assembled in different parts of the market.
At first the uninitiated would suppose that a pugilistic encounter, or a
little thimble-rig was the congregating cause. Not so. Approach and
look, and listen. In Group I. you may find a stout argument conducted
with more than the wonted theological acerbity, by a sturdy Protestant
on the one side, and an acute and plausible Roman Catholic on the
other. They are both, to all appearance, Irish labourers; but their
acquaintance with the points of difference between the rival Churches
does as much credit to their knowledge, as the earnestness with which
they display it, does to their zeal. Group II., a rational religionist,
who, if we may judge from accent and physiognomy, is undoubtedly
Yankee, is destroying the miracles seriatim, not like Gibbon, according
to Lord Byron,-</p>
<p><q> Sapping a solemn creed with solemn sneer,</q></p>
<p>but hurling infinite contempt, with some declamatory power, on Lot's
wife and the pillar of salt, and on the passage of the Red Sea. On the
loquacity of Balaam's ass he is especially funny, and not a little
<pb id="p.50" n="50">
blasphemous. He is evidently a wag, and as scoffing is always popular
with a vulgar and uninformed audience, he has triumphed over a
solemn tract-distributor, who was tempted to break a lance with
the American, and who, by his weak advocacy, has done, pro tern.
among that select circle, some harm to the orthodox cause.
</p><p>In Group III., a mad-woman is endeavouring to explain, in a
manner the most incoherent, to a small band of gaping fools, almost as
fit candidates for Bedlam as their teacher, that the appearance of
Louis Napoleon on the stage of European affairs was intimately
connected with the opening of some seal in the Revelations (I forget
which), and that the Crystal Palace at Sydenham was pointedly alluded
to, in the same part of the sacred volume, as a <soCalled>sea of glass.</soCalled> The
women among her hearers sometimes seem affected, if not convinced.
Among the men there is a rather sceptical spirit apparent, and upon
one occasion, after she had been beyond her wont, fervent, I heard one
man, a Gallio in his small way, say to another, Come along, Bill, let's
have a drop o' tea arter this ere. Bill was not loath to accept the con-
vivial challenge, but the tea turned out to be gin, of which I saw them
imbibe<soCalled> two penn'orth</soCalled>  each, in a neighbouring public-house. Some
of these public-houses, and their Sunday habitues, have come under my
notice, as well as the polemical people in the market. The scene depicted
in the sketch is no exaggerated copy of the interior of one of these places
where <q> a drop of tea,</q> as Bill's companion euphemistically phrased
it, may be enjoyed with the accompaniment of a little sacred music on
Sunday evening. The same gloomy turn which induced these people
to discuss theology in Smithfield leads them, it would appear, to make
an unholy alliance between sacred music and the consumption of beer
and spirits.
</p><p>I then entered the public-house into which the men had gone.
I found that I was in a musical gin-palace, and that the music was
of the most orthodox kind. A self-acting organ behind the bar
was playing in a slow and doleful manner, <q>Angels ever bright and
fair,</q> and when this was ended, proceeded after a slight pause
to sound forth the 100th Psalm, in a very lively manner. This organ
was at intervals wound up by the pot-boy. <q>Do you have music
here every Sunday ? </q> I asked.  <q>Yes, sir; but sacred music - only
sacred music, sir,</q> added the boy, with such pride as that with which
<pb id="p.51" n="51">
the vagabond, in Goldsmith's Comedy, declared that his bear danced to
none but the genteelest of tunes, the minuet in Ariadne, or <q> water
parted.</q> This same sacred music, which so excited my curiosity, did
not appear to have the slightest effect on the <foreign lang=fr>habitues</foreign> of the house.
They drank-smoked-laughed-swore, as if there was no music in the
case. The bar-maid, with the mechanical movements of an automaton,
tapped the beer, ale, and spirits, and changed shillings and sixpences,
without seeming to recognise the existence of the organ, which was
under the sole superintendence of the pot-boy, who wound it up on the
principle of a mangle.
</p><p>The sketch of the interior of this  <soCalled>Public </soCalled> is faithful. It will
remind any of my readers, who know what the appearance of a
London gin-shop is, of the tawdry finery and vulgar show that
pervades it. The sacred music is the distinctive feature, and is as
curious and characteristic as the disputations in Smithfield, and proves
the intimate connection so flippantly said to exist between <soCalled> rum and
true religion.</soCalled></p></div1><pb id="p.52" n="52">

<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<head>FARRINGDON-STREET EXTENSION.</head>
<p>NOTWITHSTANDING the laudable efforts of some modern writers to
give the public at large some slight idea of the condition of the poorest,
and most wretched of those who are called the lower orders, there are
numbers of the civilised and respectable portion of the community who
are in almost total ignorance of the state in which many of their fellow-
creatures live and die.
</p><p><q>There are,</q> writes Charles Dickens, in <emph>Master Humphrey's Clock</emph>,
<q>some few people well to do, who remember to have heard it said, that
numbers of men and women-thousands they think it was-get up in
London every day, unknowing where to lay their heads at night; and
that there are quarters of the town where misery and famine always are.
They don't believe it quite-there may be some truth in it, but it is
exaggerated of course.</q>
</p><p> If some of those who, when they take their walks at the West End,
give a beggar a penny with a kind of shuddering doubt as to whether
they are doing right or wrong, would walk through Farringdon Street
Extension on Sunday morning they may see as fine specimens of human
savages as could be found in any of those distant islands in the Pacific,
which afford such a fund of religious anecdote to the Orators of Exeter
Hall. I do not mean that physically they are fine savages-for they
are mostly, as far as one can see through their ragged clothes and
squalid filth, skinny and stunted-but that they are quite in as
brutalised a condition.
</p><p>No country makes philanthropic efforts of so vast and so noble a kind
<pb id="p.53" n="53">
as our own. Were they more domestic and practical we should
have few such sights as Farringdon Street Extension on Sunday
morning. We have no right, however, to boast of our national great-
ness or goodness while such things are to be seen.
</p><p>Our Government, which appears to be so deeply interested in the
welfare of a man the moment he has been found guilty of crime-
appears to ignore his existence previous to that consummation, and
whatever its activity in seeking to punish or reform the criminal,
leaves the innocent unregarded and untaught.</p>
<p>In Reading and other gaols the prisoners are so schooled in theology
that they ought to turn out profound Divines. These boys and girls
running wild, whose grotesque appearance I have attempted to depict
in the sketch, are taught nothing. They will, however, doubtless soon
qualify for some prison or other, where, too late, they may learn the
ingenuous arts-or leave this country to better their worldly prospects in
a Colony.</p>
<p> At any rate here they are at present, to be seen on any Sunday
morning or afternoon, playing pitch and toss, cursing and swearing,
shouting, screaming, splashing each other with dirty water, and throwing
at each other stones and mud to the peril of passers-by. <q>And this,
too, sir,</q> as a stout man once said to me in reference to the non-
arrival of a train at a railway-station-<q>in a Christian country!</q></p></div1>
<div1 type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<head> CONCLUSION.</head>
<p>I HAVE now done my task. I have sketched from actual scenes, and
described what passes on every Summer Sunday in and about London.
I have not, although I could, described and drawn the luxurious
residences of those who have set themselves against the Sydenham
<q>School and Garden of Temperance.</q> That may remain a task for a
future day. Now, looking back upon these sketches and descriptions,
the first thing that strikes me in the pretended Sabbath Observance
cry is its horrible Pharisaical selfishness.
</p><p>To men of the wealthy middle class-and it is from parties chiefly in
that position, as to means, and from simple well-meaning women who
know no better, that the cry arises-an Act of Parliament, enforcing
the absolute cessation of all occupation on Sunday would be no privation,
it would never pass the fence of their pleasure grounds; having
ridden or driven to town every day during the week, having been
heartily wearied by business, having a country-house in a pleasant
situation, with a good garden and enough servants, not being dependent
on the Saturday-night butcher, or the huxter or the baker, for every
Sunday meal, they have no more personal experience of the feelings of
a poor man as to Sunday, than a Hindoo has of a frosty winter.
</p><p>They could, with no great inconvenience, have an extremely comfortable
cold dinner, where cold fish, fowl, game, meat, tart, and salad, would
render any Sunday cooking unnecessary. They do not need the
change or excitement of an excursion by rail. Not being fashionable
men, they do not want to drive in the park. Not being betting men,
<pb id="p.55" n="55">
they do not care to meet our titled and untitled sporting aristocracy
at Hyde-park Corner. Not being politicians, they do not rush down to
any club to hear the last political gossip.
</p><p>They are only too happy to rest, to attend their parish churches, to
instruct their children, to meditate, and allow holier thoughts for that
day to supersede the money-making of the English week-day.
</p><p>Their own gardens and grounds afford them that space which
the occupant of a shopman's barrack, of an artisan's attic, or a court
in Smithfield or St. Giles's, seeks on Windmill Hill or by an excursion
train.
</p><p>To be sure, then, there is no form of religious pretension so easy as
that which consists in glorifying ourselves by inflicting pain on our
fellow creatures.
</p><p>The Sunday-restriction conspiracy is, in fact, only another form of
that feeling which led Philip of Spain to witness with so much content
the burning of his unhappy Jewish, Moorish, and Protesting subjects;
and Louis the Fourteenth to atone for a life of wretched pride and sin
by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and slaughtering his
Protestant subjects.*
</p><p>Thoughts cannot be controlled by public opinion, or even by Acts of
Parliament; we can no more make a man pious by excluding him from
the country, and compelling him to remain during Sunday wherever
his finances compel him to lodge during week-days, than we can
prevent the banker at church or at home from devoting the time,
outwardly given to pious meditations, inwardly to financial calculations;
<NOTE place=foot>* The persecuting spirit which actuates the self-elected religious public is exemplified in
the following extract from a Scotch paper, showing how heads were broken in the name of
Sabbath observance :
<q> SINGULAR AFFRAY AT GARELOCH-HEAD.-On Sunday week the usually quiet watering-
place of Gareloch-head, in Dumbartonshire, was the scene of an extraordinary disturbance,
caused by an attempt on the part of the servants of Sir J. Colquhoun, aided by the police
and others, to resist the landing of the passengers from a Glasgow steamboat called the
Emperor. It appears that great dissatisfaction had been created in the minds of many of
the inhabitants by this steamboat plying to and from Gareloch-head and other watering-
places on Sunday; and Sir J. Colquhoun, sympathising with this feeling, resolved, if
possible, to prevent the disembarkation of the passengers on that day, basing his right to do
so on the ground that the landing-pier was his private property. Accordingly when the
Emperor reached the pier on Sunday forenoon it was found that a strong barricade, composed
of barrels, herring-boxes, and large pieces of wood, surmounted by a heavy gangway,
completely blocked up the passage to the shore, while before and behind it a numerous body of gamekeepers, gillies, and others, including some policemen, were stationed, to repel the
passengers should they attempt to effect a landing. This attempt the passengers were not
slow in making. A rush was made from the steamer, and, notwithstanding the free use of
bludgeons and other weapons by the party on shore, a large body of passengers got a
footing on the pier, took the barricade by storm, threw the materials into the sea, and, having
beaten back their opponents, secured an easy passage to the shore. The scuffle, though,
brief, appears to have been rather fierce, and some hard blows were dealt on both sides.
Having gained their object, the passengers set about enjoying themselves in a harmless way,
and at the end of two hours returned to the steamer, which they were allowed to enter
through the pier, without molestation, and were soon on their way again to Glasgow.</q></NOTE>
<pb id="p.56" n="56">
</p><p>or the merchant from speculations on the probable price of wool
and tallow.
</p><p>The parties who are the real movers of the agitation for ensuring a
better observance of Sunday by legislative penalties on locomotion, are
the direct representatives, and some of them actual sharers in the
movement attempted by Sir Andrew Agnew twenty years ago, for
reviving the Puritanical observance of Sunday-the only real beneficial
result of his agitation was the closing of public-houses from midnight
on Saturday night to midday on Sunday.
</p><p>And now, after a pause of twenty years, the Agnewites make the
Sunday opening of the Crystal Palace the excuse for a renewed
agitation founded on a strange combination of ignorance and cant.
</p><p> Before Sir Andrew Agnew's Sunday Observance Committee the chief
evidence of his favourite witnesses was directed towards showing the
tendency of Sunday public-houses to promote drunkenness, and there
was a good deal of truth in the evidence.
</p><p>When a man has no education, and consequently no mental resources
-when he lives in such confined lodgings as are the lot of the hard-
working in large towns-when he has neither park nor garden, nor
sheltered alcove at command-when he has a cross wife and crying
children (and none of us would be very good-tempered if compelled to
live as many of the poor live), why he finds it very comfortable to retire
to the warm, well-lighted gin-palace, where liquor cheers his heart, and
congenial companions find him agreeable conversation. It is to him
what the club is to the wealthier man; he drinks gin or beer instead of
claret or port; he leans against the counter, or sits on a rude bench,
instead of taking his ease in a snug arm-chair, with this difference, that
in our own, or in our club dining-rooms, we need not drink more than
we desire-there is neither temptation nor public opinion to lead us on

<pb id="p.57" n="57">
to intoxication; while, in the bar or parlour of the gin-palace, the man
who enjoys the fire, the light, and the society, is expected to drink for
the good of the house.
</p><p> As I have before observed, when noblemen and gentlemen were in
the habit of dining and passing their evenings in taverns, Ministers of
State and leaders of society got drunk without reproach. In the same
period it was almost a proverb that the best workmen were drunkards.
Among respectable mechanics at the present day, as well as among
peers and members of parliament, drunkenness is considered a
disgraceful vice; but this change of public opinion was not brought
about by shutting up public-houses, or by penalties, or by restrictive
acts of any kind, but by an improved moral tone, assisted by the spread
of a taste for cheaper non-intoxicating drinks.
</p><p>While tea and coffee, highly taxed, were luxuries confined to the
wealthier classes, beer and gin were the morning and evening drinks of
labouring men. It was not by forcibly closing the gin-palace, but setting
up a coffee-shop next door, that the rising generation was weaned from
the fatal vice of Englishmen.
</p><p>Looking back at the steps, and the means by which England has
advanced from the degraded condition of a universally drunken people
to its present improved state, I cannot restrain my amazement at the
blindness and the ignorance of the opponents of the glass-covered
Gardens of Sydenham, for that is what this  <soCalled>Temple of Pleasure</soCalled>
resolves itself into.
</p><p>One reverend and anonymous pamphlet writer, full of pity for the
merchants of Sydenham, but with no pity for those who have the hard
work during the week, but not the country-house to retire to on a
Sunday, exclaims, <q>Houses of refreshment will spring up around, and
all these will be crammed on Sundays. If beer and spirits cannot be
had in the building itself, means will be found to furnish them here, and
it requires no prophet's eye to see that Sabbath drunkenness will be
added to the accompaniments of the Crystal Palace.</q>
</p><p> No doubt the reverend gentleman, who also threatens that several of
the inhabitants of Sydenham will leave the district if the proposed plan
be carried out, is quite right; there will be beer-shops and as many
public-houses as the magistrates of the county chose to sanction, set up
in the neighbourhood of the Crystal Palace; and those who are not
<pb id="p.58" n="58">
contented with the temperate fare and decent regulations of the People's
Palace may stay outside to drink and blaspheme; but why should they
travel all the way to Sydenham for that purpose ? All those who like
drinking on a Sunday afternoon can do it, and do it to their hearts'
content, in every thoroughfare in London.
</p><p>If the Reverend Messrs. Jowett and Jones, for whose motives I have
the utmost respect, will only take the trouble to inquire as to the real
state of Stockwell and Clapham on a Sunday afternoon, they will find
the public-house trade decidedly brisk. On Sundays every bar and
every tap will be found full; on fine days, everything in the shape of
a garden, an open space, a skittle-ground, a flat roof, a portico, will be
found crowded by men, women, and boys, whose right to a seat depends
on a consumption of beer or spirits. They will find that, whenever a
garden is attached to a public-house, there a charge is made for
admittance, which entitles the payer to refreshments, thus giving a
direct premium to drink.
</p><p> I shall not be surprised to find that the gentlemen who head this
Sabbath observance agitation, are quite ignorant of all this. They
have never witnessed the scenes which I have drawn and described
from life. On Sundays they stay at home; they have good port and
sherry in their cellars, so have no need to go to the public-house for
refreshment, and they do not consider it their duty to inquire how the
millions pass their time.
</p><p>Why, not one of the least remarkable and most painful sights in
London, is the aspect of the public-houses on Sunday afternoon.
Whether we proceed towards Hampstead or Highgate, or to Camber-
well and Peckham, or to Chelsea, Battersea and Wandsworth, and
Putney, or eastward toward Bow, or beyond Paddington, it is the same
sight; everything in the shape of a prospect or a garden, filled by parties
whose admission is paid in drink: men drink, women drink-even girls
of a respectable appearance may be seen with glasses of rum and water
before them at such places as the Globe Gardens, Mile-end, Bow.
</p><p>It certainly is most extraordinary, that with crowded gin-palaces
at the corner of every street, with Cremorne Gardens at Chelsea, the
Rosemary Branch at Peckham, the Grecian Saloon in the City Road,
the Globe Gardens at Mile-end, the Highbury Barn at Highbury, and
thousands of other similar establishments open and crowded every
<pb id="p.59" n="59">
Sunday, places where there is every incentive to drink so long as
drunkenness does not call in the interference of the police; drunken-
ness, too, taxed, sanctioned, and licensed by the State itself; the
advocates for a Puritanical observance of Sunday, should have levelled
their opposition against the Crystal Palace, the first attempt to provide
on a large scale a place to which those who are condemned to reside in
the unwholesome precincts of a great city during the day, can resort
with their wives and families, without encountering temptation to
intoxication, and without exposing the modesty of their female relatives
to contamination from foul language or immodest demeanour of some
of the frequenters of tea-gardens and the like.
</p><p> At present it is difficult to say whether the young wife of the
mechanic or shopman incurs the greater risk in accompanying her
husband to Sunday Gardens, there to acquire a taste for spirituous
liquors, and to have the bloom of modesty brushed off by the coarse
conversation of other frequenters, or in leaving her husband to go
alone, and there, without her restraining influence, be exposed to the
seductions of <soCalled> another glass.</soCalled>
</p><p> A great and enormous improvement has taken place within the last
twenty-five years in the character of our bread-earning population
of all classes; from the mechanic upwards, sobriety and decency of
language have kept pace with improvement in education, in food, and
in clothes. Yet the lamentable fact remains, that our cities increase in
size, and consequently in the influences which injuriously affect health
-while, on the one hand, no adequate provision has been made for
securing decent healthy houses for the poorer classes; on the other, the
chief open spaces for air and exercise, with shelter, are entirely in the
hands of publicans.
</p><p>I am not so sanguine as to imagine that one Crystal Palace can
attract and accommodate, at the price it proposed to charge, anything
like the population which now pours out of London in search of fresh
air and change of scene every fine Sunday; even if the charge were
one penny per person, instead of one shilling, that would not be
possible.
</p><p> But I am sanguine enough to expect that the example of the Crystal
Palace, as a place of wholesome, healthy, well-conducted sober recrea-
tion and rest for those to whom Sunday affords their only hours of
<pb id="p.60" n="60">
leisure, will present a great moral lesson, not only to the inhabitants of
London, but those of all our populous manufacturing districts.
</p><p>That it will inevitably raise the standard of all places of amusement,
and show what may be done toward softening the manners and im-
proving the taste of the millions who will make it their resort. That
it will, in fact, prepare the soil for receiving the seeds which zealous
teachers and pious preachers are prepared to sow.
</p><p>It may be the dream of pious mole-eyed men, that in London, on
Sunday, the whole population divides its time between attending places
of worship and silent serious meditations at their own dwellings, and
that the opening of the Crystal Palace Gardens will be the signal for a
new order of profanity; if so, this work, imperfectly as it has been
executed, will prove, in sober fact, that during the greater part of the
day, London, especially that part of it devoted to trade, is deserted, and
that on foot and by every means of conveyance, the population streams
outwards. If it were not so, if the population which the vast increase
of towns condemns to live a life very different to that of the Israelites,
in tents, were not able to escape from time to time into the country,
we should soon find our towns devastated by pestilence, and sapped by
consumption.
</p><p>The question to be settled, is not whether an imaginary Sunday
observance shall be infringed, but whether it is not an excellent
measure to offer as a counter-attraction to the grog-gardens of the
suburbs, and gin-palaces of the city-a place where no father need be
ashamed to accompany his family, and where, instead of temptation,
instruction of the highest kind, of the most interesting nature, will be
afforded to the youth of either sex.
</p><p>The fact is, that the most ardent propagators of this Anti-Crystal
Palace cry, consist of hypocrites who are always ready to obtain that
cheap character for piety which is to be earned by abusing and
oppressing others-and of sincere ignorant enthusiasts, the direct
descendants of the Puritans who laid so excellent a foundation for the
reactionary debaucheries of Charles II.'s reign.
</p><p>These would, if they could, bring every movement, every transaction
to a stand still on the seventh day; nay, in their eyes, neither
music, nor dancing, nor any other amusement, is commendable on
week-days.
<pb id="p.61" n="61">
<p>They would close every shop and every coffee-house, stop every
cab, every omnibus, every horse, every railway train, suppress every
Sunday and every Monday newspaper, close the parks, and allow no
one to walk, except to and from church, permit no ships to sail or
arrive, and punish severely all who ventured to infringe their notions
of Sabbatical law.
</p><p>Private serious drinking they could not restrain, nor would they, as
we know by the experience of Scotland, some of whose great towns are
equally renowned for drunkenness and strict observance of Sunday.
</p><p>The question is simply, whether we are prepared for the one course
or the other. Are we prepared to drive back our populations into
towns, to leave the luxuries of Sunday rest to the monopoly of those
who have suburban villas, to stop all means of public conveyance, and
make fresh air one of the luxuries of the rich, and the strong, able to
walk long miles ? are we prepared to close the Zoological and Botanical
Gardens, the mis-called tea-gardens, and all the train of resorts for
drinking; or shall we, with the grossest inconsistency, confine ourselves
to forbidding gardens of temperance, like those of the Crystal Palace,
and excursion trains, to which thousands owe their health, while leaving
unchecked the temples of intemperance that flourish at the corner of
every street ?
</p><p>Are we to strain at an excursion train, and swallow the countless
temptations to intoxication ?
</p><p> Shall all the luxuries of Sabbath rest be for the rich, and for the
poor punishment and pain only ?
</p><p>Which will be in the more thankful and prayerful disposition; which
better prepared to keep down evil thoughts and evil tempers; which a
tenderer parent and a more loving husband; the man, who after a week's
work at bench or counter, is condemned to pass the Sunday within the
narrow bounds of his lodgings, looking out on dingy houses, or on rows
of chimney-pots, sallow, sick, and weary, or he who is enabled by
steam-boat or railway-train to get out of the smoke of town with his
family, and at once refresh his limbs, his eyes, his ears, and his lungs,
with exercise, with air, with country scenes and country sounds ?
</p><p>South, speaking of the hypocrites of his day, has well described the
influence of cant and pretence in the following passage:-
</p><p><q>Bodily abstinence, joined with a demure affected countenance, is
<pb id="p.62" n="62">
often called and accounted piety. Suppose a man infinitely ambitious
and equally spiteful and malicious, or who poisons men's ears with
spiteful whispers; yet, if he step forth with a lantern face and a
mournful ditty for the vices of the times-oh, then he is a saint upon
earth !</q>
</p><p> <q>What primitive, self-mortifying vigour there is in forbearing a dinner
that we may have a better stomach for supper.</q>
</p><p>
<q>The world stands in admiration of such men, fools are fond of
them, wise men are afraid of them.</q></p>
<p>THE END.</p>
